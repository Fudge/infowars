[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:14.160 --> 00:16.160]  front lines of the N.O.W.
[00:16.160 --> 00:20.880]  That may be, but I appeal your ruling.
[00:20.880 --> 00:22.520]  The gentleman is not recognized.
[00:22.520 --> 00:25.160]  Just take back over your time and just fire away.
[00:25.160 --> 00:29.640]  Knowing this, will you answer the committee's question as directed or do you refuse to answer
[00:29.640 --> 00:31.760]  the committee's question?
[00:31.760 --> 00:36.680]  Mr. Chairman, as you know, counsel for the FBI has directed me not to answer questions
[00:36.680 --> 00:38.640]  about the ongoing investigation.
[00:38.640 --> 00:42.080]  As you also know, counsel for the FBI is sitting here behind me.
[00:42.080 --> 00:44.560]  May I consult with them?
[00:44.560 --> 00:46.760]  You may consult with your own counsel.
[00:46.760 --> 00:49.200]  But I may not consult with the FBI's counsel?
[00:49.200 --> 00:52.720]  Only with your own counsel.
[00:52.720 --> 00:54.560]  Mr. Chairman, there's no basis for that.
[00:54.560 --> 00:56.520]  He can consult with the FBI counsel.
[00:56.520 --> 00:57.520]  He's an FBI employee.
[00:57.520 --> 01:01.320]  It is not recognized, and the chairman is not being proper.
[01:01.320 --> 01:03.160]  The chairman is being proper.
[01:03.160 --> 01:10.080]  When this can't be directed not to confer with his attorney, the FBI is not his attorney.
[01:10.080 --> 01:11.600]  His attorney is seated behind him.
[01:11.600 --> 01:14.080]  If he's an employee of the FBI, he's already done.
[01:14.080 --> 01:15.080]  He may do so.
[01:15.080 --> 01:17.840]  And his attorney may consult with the FBI attorney?
[01:17.840 --> 01:25.680]  Isn't the privilege that of the FBI and shouldn't the FBI counsel be solicited on that point?
[01:25.680 --> 01:45.520]  Mr. Chairman, my counsel has reiterated that counsel for the FBI has directed that I may
[01:45.520 --> 01:48.400]  not answer that question.
[01:48.400 --> 01:52.680]  Mr. Struck, in a moment we will continue with the hearing, but based on your refusal to
[01:52.680 --> 01:57.000]  answer the question, at the conclusion of the day, we will be recessing the hearing,
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.160]  and you will be subject to recall to allow the committee to consider proceeding with
[02:01.160 --> 02:02.160]  a contempt citation.
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.880]  At the point of order, Mr. Chairman, will the committee also consider contempt for Mr.
[02:05.880 --> 02:09.520]  Bannon, who refused to answer Mr. Gowdy's questions when he was actually under subpoena?
[02:09.520 --> 02:12.840]  That is not a proper point of order in this year.
[02:12.840 --> 02:13.840]  Parliamentary inquiry.
[02:13.840 --> 02:14.840]  Mr. Gowdy, do you remember that?
[02:14.840 --> 02:15.840]  Parliamentary inquiry.
[02:15.840 --> 02:19.440]  The time is controlled by the gentlemen.
[02:19.440 --> 02:27.440]  Firing is happening, that's Congressman Goodlat, and we've got dozens of fiery explosive historical
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.720]  clips coming up today, and we've got several people in there watching the ongoing live
[02:31.720 --> 02:37.640]  hearings, collating it, and we'll have a lot of it for you throughout the transmission.
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.880]  That said, we've got the big events taking place with Trump in Europe, now traveling
[02:42.880 --> 02:47.520]  to the U.K.
[02:47.520 --> 02:55.600]  We have Stormy Daniels obviously being arrested, we have Dianne Feinstein fighting to even get
[02:55.600 --> 03:01.680]  the Democratic nomination, we have Democrats openly calling for Pelosi to step down, realizing
[03:01.680 --> 03:09.960]  that the cryptkeeper nature of their party is not popular, it is quite an amazing time
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.160]  to be alive right now.
[03:14.160 --> 03:20.080]  But that said, I'm going to cover something first when we come back from break, and I
[03:20.080 --> 03:24.560]  hope everybody really pays attention to it, because I know a lot of folks have learned
[03:24.560 --> 03:30.280]  that we're trailblazers, we've got our finger on the touchstone, the zeitgeist, but I've
[03:30.280 --> 03:34.000]  talked to senior people in the administration, I've talked to other folks in the campaign,
[03:34.000 --> 03:41.480]  I've talked to a lot of people about the concerted effort to fundamentally change the architecture
[03:41.480 --> 03:47.000]  of the Internet and ban conservatives, nationalists, libertarians, Christians, gun owners, you
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.720]  name it, from access to most major platforms.
[03:52.720 --> 03:56.840]  And they're bragging how they're doing.
[03:56.840 --> 04:03.680]  And Trump has not yet really responded to this, and really neither has anybody else.
[04:03.680 --> 04:09.040]  So we're tasked here at Info Wars with really blueprinting what they're doing from their
[04:09.040 --> 04:14.680]  own words, but that said, I printed up just the last few months of CNN saying to major
[04:14.680 --> 04:18.440]  publishers don't publish Alex Jones' book and successfully getting them not to publish
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.920]  it, Portress Interference, CNN trying to get me banned off YouTube saying they're lobbying
[04:22.920 --> 04:31.280]  to do it, and now the head of CNN's major operations has gone to a Facebook conference
[04:31.280 --> 04:37.840]  and called for me to be banned, and they assured them that they'll start censoring us more.
[04:37.840 --> 04:41.960]  This is their main rollout, ladies and gentlemen, and now Sasha Barakohan is stalking Info Wars
[04:41.960 --> 04:42.960]  we've confirmed.
[04:42.960 --> 04:43.960]  Stay with us.
[04:43.960 --> 05:00.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are for resistance.
[05:00.600 --> 05:06.560]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by Info Wars

[05:21.320 --> 05:26.480]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which

[06:20.360 --> 06:49.320]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:49.320 --> 07:09.000]  The
[07:09.000 --> 07:10.000]  wait.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.480]  I've read those exact emails and I've heard my producer talk about them telling them that.
[07:15.480 --> 07:22.000]  After about a month of them incessantly calling, I said, don't call here anymore.
[07:22.000 --> 07:29.360]  Sasha Barrett Cohen, the king of fake news, because what they do is they act like they're
[07:29.360 --> 07:34.920]  comedians, but then the media puts out the late night comedy shows like Homeland, all
[07:34.920 --> 07:40.240]  these so-called entertainment shows from the opposition to you name it, are designed to
[07:40.240 --> 07:48.440]  target InfoWars in their own admissions and then they put it out like the things they're
[07:48.440 --> 07:53.280]  saying bigoted hateful racist are things we said.
[07:53.280 --> 07:58.520]  And then they have CNN come out today and call for InfoWars to be banned.
[07:58.520 --> 08:10.800]  CNN officially sent their head of media operations to Facebook and CNN Money has the headline
[08:10.800 --> 08:14.600]  that they're calling for me to be removed from the internet.
[08:14.600 --> 08:16.120]  They want our apps removed.
[08:16.120 --> 08:18.360]  They want us kicked off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[08:18.360 --> 08:21.480]  They don't want us to have access to Google Store, which has already happened.
[08:21.480 --> 08:25.080]  They don't want us to have advertising to any of this.
[08:25.080 --> 08:30.800]  But then they misrepresent things I've said or done as the excuse a few months ago CNN
[08:30.800 --> 08:32.280]  said ban him from YouTube.
[08:32.280 --> 08:34.000]  He says no one died at Parkland.
[08:34.000 --> 08:35.000]  It's all fake.
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.280]  Never said that.
[08:36.280 --> 08:37.440]  You said that.
[08:37.440 --> 08:39.920]  You are fake news.
[08:39.920 --> 08:46.440]  And look at the smiling possum grin of a possum sitting over a nice big pile of dog crap it
[08:46.440 --> 08:48.640]  found that it wants to eat.
[08:48.640 --> 08:55.040]  Facebook touts fight on fake news, but struggles to explain why InfoWars isn't banned.
[08:55.040 --> 08:59.200]  Wow, what an American organization at CNN.
[08:59.200 --> 09:01.320]  We love the American people.
[09:01.320 --> 09:11.040]  We don't hate the American people, member Wolf Blitzer.
[09:11.040 --> 09:12.600]  So Trump calls you fake news.
[09:12.600 --> 09:14.480]  Does that mean you get banned?
[09:14.480 --> 09:15.640]  No.
[09:15.640 --> 09:20.440]  It means everyone tunes out and your ratings go from non-existent to negative.
[09:20.440 --> 09:30.440]  You have to force feed at hotels and restaurants and bus terminals and every schools.
[09:30.440 --> 09:40.040]  When I was in high school, 27 years ago, man, I'm getting old, 27 years ago, they put in
[09:40.040 --> 09:46.600]  TVs when I was a sophomore in Rockwall, Texas, and then I moved down here the next year and
[09:46.600 --> 09:48.240]  they had the TVs in there.
[09:48.240 --> 09:53.480]  In your first period, you would watch 15 minutes of CNN propaganda.
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.640]  And it was all race war, whites are bad, guns are bad.
[09:57.640 --> 10:00.160]  It was incredible.
[10:00.160 --> 10:07.320]  And CNN paid for the entire TV system to be put into the entire school set of projectors
[10:07.320 --> 10:11.600]  in Rockwall, Texas, and then in Austin, Texas, and they learned nationwide to force feed
[10:11.600 --> 10:14.480]  their garbage.
[10:14.480 --> 10:20.080]  So, they are openly saying they want to ban info wars.
[10:20.080 --> 10:21.240]  They're all over the news saying it.
[10:21.240 --> 10:29.560]  They have Sasha Barrett Cohen stalking us dressed up with info war shirts and stickers
[10:29.560 --> 10:31.800]  going around saying horrible racist things.
[10:31.800 --> 10:33.640]  That's in the news today.
[10:33.640 --> 10:39.520]  And so in the movie, he dresses like an info wars listener and then runs around saying
[10:39.520 --> 10:41.640]  racist things.
[10:41.640 --> 10:46.640]  Full defamation on a whole group of people that are pro America and pro free market.
[10:46.640 --> 10:48.120]  This is how they operate.
[10:48.120 --> 10:52.240]  So I'm going to be breaking this down today.
[10:52.240 --> 10:57.760]  We're going to be getting into the incredible hearings that are taking place.
[10:57.760 --> 11:04.520]  GOP lawmakers threatened FBI agent Peter Strock with contempt for refusing to answer questions
[11:04.520 --> 11:05.720]  on Mueller probe.
[11:05.720 --> 11:11.760]  U.S. Marshall served subpoena on FBI lawyer Lisa Page, Congress threatens to hold her
[11:11.760 --> 11:15.080]  in contempt.
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.040]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, today.
[11:19.040 --> 11:24.920]  We've got them in the crosshairs, but that said, it's neck and neck.
[11:24.920 --> 11:28.480]  We are starting to win, but we're far from having the main victory.
[11:28.480 --> 11:34.080]  And if people don't take this very, very seriously, they've got a few aces up their
[11:34.080 --> 11:39.040]  sleeve, the globalists are going to at least bring in a total destabilization as they're
[11:39.040 --> 11:43.840]  already starting to do to try to stop America's return.
[11:43.840 --> 11:46.280]  So this is a total fight.
[11:46.280 --> 11:48.720]  You see CNN trying to collapse our borders.
[11:48.720 --> 11:52.960]  You see the mainstream media and the Democrats rooting against Trump when we pay half of
[11:52.960 --> 11:56.960]  the NATO bill and 20 something other countries pay almost nothing.
[11:56.960 --> 11:59.800]  And they call that traitorous and bad and hurting America.
[11:59.800 --> 12:02.560]  You just see how much they hate America.
[12:02.560 --> 12:05.880]  How much they hate the American people.
[12:05.880 --> 12:12.000]  How they've been for generations, several, 60 years or so, shelling out our infrastructure.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.800]  I mean, look at these headlines.
[12:15.800 --> 12:17.720]  Sarah Palin isn't the only one.
[12:17.720 --> 12:22.480]  Dick Cheney, Bernie Sanders also got duped by Sasha Barakohan.
[12:22.480 --> 12:27.320]  Exclusive Breitbart, Sasha Barakohan posed as disabled veteran, Trump voter with bullet
[12:27.320 --> 12:35.440]  necklace and info or stickers, and then meanwhile, Hillary Clinton calls for info wars to be
[12:35.440 --> 12:36.440]  banned.
[12:36.440 --> 12:40.000]  Homeland blames Alex Jones character for fake news and then says things I never said.
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.040]  And then they use this and CNN articles to go, look, ban info wars, look, everybody
[12:47.040 --> 12:48.040]  hates him.
[12:48.040 --> 12:49.360]  No, you hate me.
[12:49.360 --> 12:52.800]  Fake news is television's favorite new storyline.
[12:52.800 --> 12:53.800]  The Atlantic.
[12:53.800 --> 12:55.040]  And then it talks about info wars.
[12:55.040 --> 13:01.200]  They quote things that they say I said on the TV show, on a fiction show, on Showtime,
[13:01.200 --> 13:05.360]  and then use that as a way to quote ban info wars because Homeland said it.
[13:05.360 --> 13:10.640]  And then weird Democrat voters watch this crap, dozens of shows against me, and then
[13:10.640 --> 13:14.000]  they believe when they see me on the street that I'm really that person.
[13:14.000 --> 13:15.360]  Talk about week-minded.
[13:15.360 --> 13:21.480]  We've got all the Hillary clips calling for me to be banned, and she's still directing
[13:21.480 --> 13:22.480]  this.
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.520]  And it said we've got to get fake news banned by the midterms or the Republicans will stay
[13:27.520 --> 13:28.520]  in power.
[13:28.520 --> 13:31.880]  We've got all the clips coming up, and then they're directly attacking info wars as the
[13:31.880 --> 13:34.160]  case point.
[13:34.160 --> 13:40.240]  They've got all these fake TV shows attacking me with fake news and then saying I need to
[13:40.240 --> 13:45.480]  be removed because I'm fake news so I can't, and this is the key, defend myself while they
[13:45.480 --> 13:47.920]  demonize and attack me.
[13:47.920 --> 13:52.520]  Here it is CNN, Lobby's Facebook to shut down info wars, the new story today.
[13:52.520 --> 13:56.800]  And they're at the conference openly saying it isn't enough to shadow ban them or block
[13:56.800 --> 14:01.800]  their articles, we want it totally banned.
[14:01.800 --> 14:07.520]  Because Jones says Trump is getting ready to come out and go public and expose Mueller
[14:07.520 --> 14:09.280]  for the 9-11 cover-up.
[14:09.280 --> 14:10.560]  Trump's already done that.
[14:10.560 --> 14:12.440]  His people have already done it.
[14:12.440 --> 14:15.640]  And that's a real source as well.
[14:15.640 --> 14:16.640]  Just wait and watch.
[14:16.640 --> 14:18.360]  No, they know I'm real news.
[14:18.360 --> 14:20.480]  That's why they're scared.
[14:20.480 --> 14:21.960]  But they lied about WMDs.
[14:21.960 --> 14:25.720]  They lied about the Martin Luther King bust being taken out of the White House.
[14:25.720 --> 14:29.760]  They lied about Trump not visiting Scalise in the hospital.
[14:29.760 --> 14:31.120]  They're known liars.
[14:31.120 --> 14:35.200]  So if you've been caught making a mistake, do you take it off the air?
[14:35.200 --> 14:41.760]  They've been caught lying so many times you can't even keep track of it.
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.840]  Facebook touts fight on fake news, but struggles to explain why info wars isn't banned.
[14:45.840 --> 14:47.880]  CNN today.
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.160]  And you've got one of the heads of CNN, this is CNN officially, lobbying for another news
[14:53.160 --> 14:55.480]  organization to be shut down.
[14:55.480 --> 14:56.480]  You talk about authoritarian.
[14:56.480 --> 14:59.440]  Hey, here's how you counter it.
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.680]  We've got for Apple and for Android an amazing new free app.
[15:04.680 --> 15:06.360]  It's info wars official.
[15:06.360 --> 15:07.720]  There's hundreds of apps out there.
[15:07.720 --> 15:09.200]  It's info wars official.
[15:09.200 --> 15:14.920]  Live feeds, audio feeds, podcast alerts when live videos go live.
[15:14.920 --> 15:16.280]  This feeds everything.
[15:16.280 --> 15:23.240]  Go to info wars.com forward slash app info wars.com forward slash app right now and download
[15:23.240 --> 15:24.240]  it for free.
[15:24.240 --> 15:27.600]  But even more importantly, this isn't just some app like you collect apps, you're going
[15:27.600 --> 15:28.600]  to use this.
[15:28.600 --> 15:30.520]  Tell everybody you know about it.
[15:30.520 --> 15:31.960]  This is the forbidden info.
[15:31.960 --> 15:33.600]  This is the guy that don't want you to hear.

[20:03.480 --> 20:29.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:29.480 --> 20:43.480]  The 12th day of July, 2018.
[20:43.480 --> 20:51.920]  Imagine if you'd read or heard 10 years ago that in 2018, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic
[20:51.920 --> 20:57.480]  Party in Congressional hearings on television would be calling for conservative and libertarian
[20:57.480 --> 21:00.840]  nationalist and Christian news to be banned.
[21:00.840 --> 21:07.160]  And that mainline Christian country singers just singing about Jesus.
[21:07.160 --> 21:08.160]  This happened last week.
[21:08.160 --> 21:09.160]  We covered it.
[21:09.160 --> 21:16.680]  Would be banned from advertising on Facebook because they were told it was political to
[21:16.680 --> 21:26.120]  say Jesus or that Google and Apple would remove Easter off of their list of holidays
[21:26.120 --> 21:33.480]  on their official calendars that are on your iPhones and androids but have all the Islamic
[21:33.480 --> 21:35.120]  holidays show up.
[21:35.120 --> 21:37.840]  It's all about rubbing your nose in it.
[21:37.840 --> 21:39.600]  They hate flyover country.
[21:39.600 --> 21:42.760]  They hate America.
[21:42.760 --> 21:47.920]  And then imagine if I told you 10 years ago that they would have late night comedy every
[21:47.920 --> 21:59.960]  night and two or three shows on Comedy Central and two shows on HBO and two shows on Showtime
[21:59.960 --> 22:05.560]  modeled after Alex Jones where they didn't misrepresent what I say and do to demonize
[22:05.560 --> 22:06.560]  me.
[22:06.560 --> 22:12.840]  Remember a year and a half ago, Chris Carter came out and said, Alex Jones is an erasist.
[22:12.840 --> 22:19.800]  He's a libertarian and I've created a character that's positive based on him for the show.
[22:19.800 --> 22:23.520]  And what was Chris Carter saying right there?
[22:23.520 --> 22:24.520]  He's in Hollywood.
[22:24.520 --> 22:27.680]  He knew the hit orders had gone out and he wasn't going along with it.
[22:27.680 --> 22:31.760]  Well, all the other shows did but Chris Carter.
[22:31.760 --> 22:40.040]  Everybody else demonized who I am and lied about me except Chris Carter and Matt Rutch.
[22:40.040 --> 22:45.240]  Everybody else is afraid to be associated with us because we hit the barbed wire.
[22:45.240 --> 22:46.640]  We tell the tough stories.
[22:46.640 --> 22:47.640]  We tell the truth.
[22:47.640 --> 22:56.400]  So the enemy then misrepresents, misrepresents who we are and they even admit in Atlantic
[22:56.400 --> 23:01.560]  Monthly TV's favorite storyline from cop shows to you name it.
[23:01.560 --> 23:04.960]  So many I can't even keep track is fake news.
[23:04.960 --> 23:06.320]  And then who do they define as fake news?
[23:06.320 --> 23:12.440]  Here it is, Alex Jones in full wars.
[23:12.440 --> 23:15.200]  And then they misrepresent what we've said done.
[23:15.200 --> 23:22.480]  So people hate me weak minded people that think dramas and comedy shows are real.
[23:22.480 --> 23:24.800]  They had a whole show.
[23:24.800 --> 23:28.640]  The opposition, they just canceled because of low ratings based on misrepresenting what
[23:28.640 --> 23:32.200]  we say and do.
[23:32.200 --> 23:33.960]  They steal your identity.
[23:33.960 --> 23:35.600]  They lie about you.
[23:35.600 --> 23:39.920]  And then they have congressional hearings saying shut down info wars everywhere.
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.520]  They have congressional hearings.
[23:44.520 --> 23:46.320]  I have all the articles right here.
[23:46.320 --> 23:56.960]  They unleash Sasha Baron Cohen dressed up in info wars t-shirts and info war stickers
[23:56.960 --> 24:03.440]  to run around the country saying the most racist, homophobic, hateful things attributed
[24:03.440 --> 24:09.040]  to me defamation on its face but protected because I'm a public figure.
[24:09.040 --> 24:14.440]  Then they file a bunch of fake lawsuits misrepresenting what I've said to put out twisted and false
[24:14.440 --> 24:19.400]  statements against me to then use the lawsuits as prima facie evidence that I should be taken
[24:19.400 --> 24:24.400]  off every internet platform.
[24:24.400 --> 24:26.120]  That's how they're doing it.
[24:26.120 --> 24:27.120]  Look at drudgerport.com.
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.320]  It's got the article right there.
[24:32.320 --> 24:39.600]  Sasha Baron Cohen poses disabled veteran Trump voter with bullet necklace and info war stickers
[24:39.600 --> 24:41.960]  in Palin prank.
[24:41.960 --> 24:48.240]  I confirmed a month ago from one of our military sources, real military officer, real background
[24:48.240 --> 24:53.280]  that they had been approached by Sasha Baron Cohen and I guess they thought they could
[24:53.280 --> 25:00.360]  work with him and found out they were set up but they couldn't get in the building.
[25:00.360 --> 25:06.480]  Six months ago, we got the emails, oh, showtime, we're your friend, we want to show both sides,
[25:06.480 --> 25:08.480]  we want to be fair.
[25:08.480 --> 25:16.880]  Now, it's right at the producer, Nico, and I said, Nico, it shall be some comedy hit
[25:16.880 --> 25:17.880]  piece show.
[25:17.880 --> 25:21.320]  I wasn't thinking Sasha Baron Cohen but that's exactly what it is.
[25:21.320 --> 25:28.920]  Imagine making fun of brain damage and disabled veterans and then they went out, I guess to
[25:28.920 --> 25:38.680]  a military hospital where people are listed as having brain disorders from being in explosions
[25:38.680 --> 25:43.400]  and then tried to have veterans reach out to us.
[25:43.400 --> 25:50.240]  So I'm just now deciphering all of this but let me tell you, it's sick.
[25:50.240 --> 25:52.600]  Who is America?
[25:52.600 --> 25:56.880]  And it all clicked last night that I remember one of our sources told us Cohen was after
[25:56.880 --> 26:03.240]  me a month ago and then I was reading what Palin put out in her text messages, she sent
[26:03.240 --> 26:08.760]  screenshots of how they lied to her and how they said it was about both sides of America
[26:08.760 --> 26:12.440]  and bringing America together and just seeing what both sides are really saying.
[26:12.440 --> 26:16.840]  I was like, whoa, that's exactly what they told us and I'm like, boom.
[26:16.840 --> 26:19.320]  Then I walk in this morning and they go, what, you haven't read Drudge Report?
[26:19.320 --> 26:23.560]  I said, yeah, I did look at it but no, Info Wars.
[26:23.560 --> 26:30.480]  She's dressed up in Info Wars outfits, which is exactly what I was told and I'm gonna go
[26:30.480 --> 26:32.360]  ahead and start spilling the beans.
[26:32.360 --> 26:42.480]  It looks like he was able to try to infiltrate Kanye West to other targets of the globalist,
[26:42.480 --> 26:48.120]  Elon Musk.
[26:48.120 --> 26:51.120]  Sasha Baron Cohen is some type of intelligence operative.
[26:51.120 --> 26:52.120]  There's no doubt.
[26:52.120 --> 26:53.120]  This isn't a comedian.
[26:53.120 --> 26:59.800]  This is a saboteur.
[26:59.800 --> 27:04.440]  And now Sarah Silverman's reaching out to a Trump supporter saying, I love you and that's
[27:04.440 --> 27:08.680]  all they can do is pure deception and then Sarah Palin said they changed your flights
[27:08.680 --> 27:12.480]  that they'd paid for to fly her out for the interview to drop her in the middle of nowhere
[27:12.480 --> 27:17.320]  with no connecting flights for a day just as an act of evil because this is all military
[27:17.320 --> 27:18.320]  attacks.
[27:18.320 --> 27:19.320]  Let me tell you something.
[27:19.320 --> 27:20.320]  You can't talk to leftists.
[27:20.320 --> 27:23.200]  You can't talk to them in your building.
[27:23.200 --> 27:26.280]  There's Spiegel begged to be in here, all this other stuff and I was the last people
[27:26.280 --> 27:31.480]  I let in and I got barbecue for him and I said, would you like some brisket, like some
[27:31.480 --> 27:32.480]  sausage?
[27:32.480 --> 27:37.680]  And the guy laughed and then he said in the newspaper that I said, you wanna suck my sausage.
[27:37.680 --> 27:42.480]  That's there's Spiegel, formerly the most respected publication in Butchland.
[27:42.480 --> 27:45.280]  Total lie, total fraud, total scam.
[27:45.280 --> 27:47.080]  These people will do anything.
[27:47.080 --> 27:57.680]  They have been authorized by their big corporations to push it to the wall.
[27:57.680 --> 28:05.440]  So that's what they do over and over and over again and they're preying on you.
[28:05.440 --> 28:10.760]  So they have entertainment shows and all the rest of them sitting there misrepresenting
[28:10.760 --> 28:11.760]  who we are.
[28:11.760 --> 28:12.760]  Then they file fake lawsuits.
[28:12.760 --> 28:14.640]  Then they go to Congress and call for censorship.
[28:14.640 --> 28:17.160]  Then they have the big tech company, Shadowban, everybody.
[28:17.160 --> 28:20.480]  And then once the president's set, they do it to everyone.
[28:20.480 --> 28:29.120]  And that's in the news with CNN, the London Guardian, all of them today saying we want
[28:29.120 --> 28:32.480]  Alex Jones banned.
[28:32.480 --> 28:37.000]  That's on infowars.com right now with a direct link of one of the major heads of operations
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.280]  at CNN lobbying to have us banned.
[28:39.280 --> 28:43.440]  They said, sir, we already censoring down to nothing.
[28:43.440 --> 28:44.440]  They said, that's not enough.
[28:44.440 --> 28:45.440]  We're only banned completely.
[28:45.440 --> 28:46.440]  Isn't that dangerous?
[28:46.440 --> 29:04.720]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine for the best hot or cold pain relief.

[29:13.360 --> 29:15.880]  that pain is a sunny Bay heating pad.
[29:15.880 --> 29:19.680]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways

[29:22.240 --> 29:27.080]  Sunny Bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work and

[31:56.080 --> 32:00.080]  Pro Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[32:00.080 --> 32:03.920]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:03.920 --> 32:08.440]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania states, but a lot of us on the big island
[32:08.440 --> 32:13.880]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:13.880 --> 32:19.240]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:19.240 --> 32:20.800]  to unhealthy levels.
[32:20.800 --> 32:27.360]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[32:27.360 --> 32:31.320]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[32:31.320 --> 32:32.800]  in the rainwater.
[32:32.800 --> 32:38.040]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter and not only were the heavy
[32:38.040 --> 32:44.120]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.120 --> 32:49.720]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[32:49.720 --> 32:55.040]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:55.040 --> 33:03.400]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:03.400 --> 33:29.960]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:29.960 --> 33:35.320]  Oh, there's showtime shows, there's HBO shows, there's Comedy Central shows, all misrepresenting
[33:35.320 --> 33:37.160]  who I am and what Info Wars does.
[33:37.160 --> 33:40.080]  Oh, we're not important at all.
[33:40.080 --> 33:47.080]  Then they've got every major news program in the country doing hit pieces, Nightline,
[33:47.080 --> 33:54.960]  Dateline NBC, the CNN programs, MSNBC, every day misrepresenting Fox News when Megan Kelly
[33:54.960 --> 33:59.840]  was there editing tapes of me talking about Hillary being personally responsible for tens
[33:59.840 --> 34:05.000]  of thousands of dead children via the air of spring.
[34:05.000 --> 34:11.200]  And then saying, I said, kids are being killed in a pizza parlor.
[34:11.200 --> 34:12.200]  That's how they covered up.
[34:12.200 --> 34:16.160]  It was really going on with the Podesta brothers and the emails and the Alistair Crowley crap
[34:16.160 --> 34:17.240]  that was in the WikiLeaks.
[34:17.240 --> 34:24.560]  They just created a fake story, put it on us and then use their fake story to call for
[34:24.560 --> 34:33.160]  us to be banned before we've ever been found libel or defamatory in court.
[34:33.160 --> 34:42.280]  Total authoritarians with a coordinated demonization program of Trump, Info Wars and others.
[34:42.280 --> 34:45.320]  And now CNN officially calls for Info Wars to be banned.
[34:45.320 --> 34:47.800]  I've got a lot of other news I want to cover here.
[34:47.800 --> 34:52.720]  We have a special guest, Marie Grathwald's daughter who was out at the prayer vigil in
[34:52.720 --> 34:57.040]  San Francisco and got viciously attacked by Antifa.
[34:57.040 --> 35:03.200]  You're talking about three women, three or four men going out there just to have a prayer
[35:03.200 --> 35:06.600]  vigil in San Francisco and to pray for peace.
[35:06.600 --> 35:14.920]  Looks like about 16, 17 men show up with one woman to try to beat them up and they couldn't
[35:14.920 --> 35:17.760]  even get it done and got run off.
[35:17.760 --> 35:24.920]  And the images of them punching women in the face, scum of the earth, she'll be joining
[35:24.920 --> 35:28.080]  us the second half of the next hour.
[35:28.080 --> 35:29.600]  I intend to open the phones up as well.
[35:29.600 --> 35:34.440]  I want to cover a lot of news, but let me tell you something right now.
[35:34.440 --> 35:43.320]  There is nothing bigger out there than the fact that I can't even watch Netflix.
[35:43.320 --> 35:58.000]  I don't care what show it is or what movie now, it's got propaganda in it.
[35:58.000 --> 36:06.800]  I remember reading 30 years ago about the lost city of Z in South America and how they
[36:06.800 --> 36:13.200]  knew they found pyramids all over Central America and they also found them in Peru.
[36:13.200 --> 36:17.080]  So British explorers went there to discover them.
[36:17.080 --> 36:21.120]  They found pyramids all over the world.
[36:21.120 --> 36:23.640]  They believed there were super civilizations.
[36:23.640 --> 36:29.400]  They believed Atlantis might be in South America, the British explorer.
[36:29.400 --> 36:38.240]  So I see it on Netflix, been out for a couple of years and I think let me watch this movie
[36:38.240 --> 36:45.280]  and there's all these crazy stupid white people and they go there and the British Academy
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.000]  of Science says, savages can't build pyramids.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.400]  There are no pyramids in the Americas.
[36:51.400 --> 36:54.360]  They are all evil and dumb and I'm going, what do you mean?
[36:54.360 --> 36:58.880]  They already found a bunch of them and they thought Atlantis was there.
[36:58.880 --> 37:02.200]  They thought they'd find, you know, super palaces of gold and all this stuff.
[37:02.200 --> 37:04.640]  They thought the opposite.
[37:04.640 --> 37:14.640]  So I know the history and then the whole thing is about how one guy's not racist and believes
[37:14.640 --> 37:21.760]  brown people can build things and that's just one example of everything's a lie now.
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.880]  You think you're going to see a historical movie and it's not just a little twisted.
[37:26.880 --> 37:32.360]  It's like a barrel of snakes, man.
[37:32.360 --> 37:37.640]  And I mean, there's hundreds of movies about black sports stars that had to go through
[37:37.640 --> 37:43.360]  racism to win, hundreds of last few years and daytime TV shows and everything.
[37:43.360 --> 37:48.880]  You can't even go to the movies and find something that isn't like this and it's all a giant
[37:48.880 --> 37:50.960]  agenda to make us hate each other.
[37:50.960 --> 37:56.560]  It's insane.
[37:56.560 --> 38:03.000]  Like somebody in 1920 didn't believe there were pyramids in South America.
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.160]  Pyramids have been found in South America 500 years before.
[38:10.160 --> 38:17.280]  But again, this is what they do to people that don't know any history.
[38:17.280 --> 38:19.120]  Those that don't know history, them to repeat it.
[38:19.120 --> 38:22.400]  My people, Paris, for lack of knowledge, this is how they prey on you.
[38:22.400 --> 38:26.880]  Hollywood is completely sold out to the communist Chinese.
[38:26.880 --> 38:29.360]  Michael Savage put a book out about that a few years ago.
[38:29.360 --> 38:33.080]  The publishers wouldn't even deliver it once they got threatened because they didn't realize
[38:33.080 --> 38:34.640]  it until the book was about to come out.
[38:34.640 --> 38:35.720]  Then the chai comms got involved.
[38:35.720 --> 38:37.360]  They wouldn't deliver it to stores.
[38:37.360 --> 38:42.800]  I've now learned that I'm banned off big podcast and things out there because people have been
[38:42.800 --> 38:47.600]  told that the Chinese communists basically control the industry they're involved.
[38:47.600 --> 38:49.560]  So you can't have Alex Jones on hell.
[38:49.560 --> 38:50.560]  I forgot this.
[38:50.560 --> 38:54.000]  I just pulled this for me, it was mainstream news yesterday.
[38:54.000 --> 39:02.720]  Apple products will not let you send until yesterday the emoji, the image of the Taiwanese
[39:02.720 --> 39:07.360]  flag, it makes your phone crash.
[39:07.360 --> 39:15.520]  Remember 12 years ago, John McCain said, if you hack anybody or you download illegal music,
[39:15.520 --> 39:17.120]  we will fry your computer.
[39:17.120 --> 39:19.320]  We will crash it or maybe even fry it.
[39:19.320 --> 39:20.320]  People said that's outrageous.
[39:20.320 --> 39:22.880]  We had that technology.
[39:22.880 --> 39:30.720]  Apple's China friendly censorship caused an iPhone crashing bug wired and it goes on
[39:30.720 --> 39:37.320]  that if you try to send the Taiwanese flag, your iPhone crashes, well what happened five
[39:37.320 --> 39:38.320]  months ago?
[39:38.320 --> 39:41.760]  Apple officially moved to China to be tax exempt, merged with the government and they
[39:41.760 --> 39:45.800]  told Reuters in China, if you are based here, the government runs you.
[39:45.800 --> 39:47.120]  That's just the way it is.
[39:47.120 --> 39:53.000]  And boom, if they can censor a flag in real time, they can do a voice print and ban Alex
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.760]  Jones or President Trump.
[39:54.760 --> 39:58.640]  They can ban words just like you try to type on your iPhone, a cuss word, it won't let
[39:58.640 --> 39:59.640]  you do it.
[39:59.640 --> 40:00.640]  It's beyond that.
[40:00.640 --> 40:01.640]  It's here.
[40:01.640 --> 40:06.840]  And that's the new article 13, article 11 the EU's been trying to pass saying that software
[40:06.840 --> 40:15.840]  by law will be on all devices where you cannot even say or do certain things preemptively.
[40:15.840 --> 40:19.480]  Now, this was such a big blow up for Apple.
[40:19.480 --> 40:20.480]  They had to back off.
[40:20.480 --> 40:22.080]  They said, we apologize.
[40:22.080 --> 40:27.280]  We'll only Geo locate if you're inside China.
[40:27.280 --> 40:28.840]  Let that sink in.
[40:28.840 --> 40:32.640]  You've got all these Hollywood programs saying I'm a racist and misrepresenting who I am
[40:32.640 --> 40:34.720]  defaming me.
[40:34.720 --> 40:38.040]  You've got the very same corporations and calling for me to be shut down so they can
[40:38.040 --> 40:42.760]  lie about me and you and we don't have a way to speak out of resistant and even counter
[40:42.760 --> 40:44.760]  it.
[40:44.760 --> 40:46.720]  We have them suing us trying to shut us down.
[40:46.720 --> 40:49.960]  They're trying to shadow ban and block the president, which they're doing on Twitter for
[40:49.960 --> 40:53.560]  this push notifications.
[40:53.560 --> 40:58.040]  Apple and others have moved to China and are now putting the iCloud data keys to everyone's
[40:58.040 --> 41:04.100]  iPhone on their platform and admitting that Chinese intelligence now runs Apple.
[41:04.100 --> 41:06.400]  Most of the universities are run by the chai comms.
[41:06.400 --> 41:07.400]  Hollywood's owned by it.
[41:07.400 --> 41:11.000]  The UFC is being bought up by it, everything.
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.440]  Now I'm just a loyal American sitting here saying it's wrong for an American citizen
[41:15.440 --> 41:20.080]  not to be able to send the Taiwanese flag to somebody because the chai comms have killed
[41:20.080 --> 41:25.040]  over 100 million of their own people and sell Christians organs because they're Christians
[41:25.040 --> 41:26.040]  on the world market.
[41:26.040 --> 41:27.040]  What?
[41:27.040 --> 41:30.320]  Tell me a 30 year old Christian doesn't have a heartbeat or a soul next, liberals?
[41:30.320 --> 41:31.320]  You're not liberals.
[41:31.320 --> 41:36.200]  You are weak followers that sold out to every form of evil and didn't even get a payoff
[41:36.200 --> 41:38.120]  to do it.
[41:38.120 --> 41:41.000]  I'd like to watch mainstream news and feel like you're on the winning team.
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.120]  Let me tell you something, I'm not here trying to just get along to go along or go along
[41:46.120 --> 41:47.120]  to get along.
[41:47.120 --> 41:48.120]  I'm here to fight the globalist.
[41:48.120 --> 41:49.280]  I'm here to hit the barbed wire.
[41:49.280 --> 41:50.480]  I'm here to expose them.
[41:50.480 --> 41:53.480]  I'm here to never stop, never back down and win.
[41:53.480 --> 41:56.680]  And thank God, Trump's going to Europe and saying we pay half a NATO.
[41:56.680 --> 41:57.680]  That's not fair.
[41:57.680 --> 41:58.680]  Pay a little more.
[41:58.680 --> 42:00.960]  Hey, China, you got a $900 billion deficit on us.
[42:00.960 --> 42:01.960]  Give us 50 billion.
[42:01.960 --> 42:02.960]  They said no.
[42:02.960 --> 42:05.320]  He goes 250, 500 billion.
[42:05.320 --> 42:06.320]  Let's go.
[42:06.320 --> 42:10.480]  The days of everybody laying down are over and all you traders saying the president's
[42:10.480 --> 42:14.240]  a trader, you're the trader and you're going to lose.
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.560]  Now don't forget, we've launched while it's still available and let them censor it.
[42:18.560 --> 42:24.120]  That's just another victory to show who they are on iPhone and Android, Android.
[42:24.120 --> 42:26.880]  The official info wars app works great.

[45:06.400 --> 45:10.400]  and a gift to the info war to fight the globalist and live in a free society.

[46:05.240 --> 46:06.240]  Thanks for holding.
[46:06.240 --> 46:12.840]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now, I remember back when infowars
[46:12.840 --> 46:17.600]  and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the
[46:17.600 --> 46:21.520]  page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.880]  and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your product since
[46:25.880 --> 46:30.720]  the first iteration of survival shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male
[46:30.720 --> 46:36.040]  Vitality, the caveman, the real red pill, micro ZX biting, it's all amazing.
[46:36.040 --> 46:37.040]  Thank you brother.
[46:37.040 --> 46:41.640]  Yeah and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[46:41.640 --> 46:46.040]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more
[46:46.040 --> 46:51.320]  you know God, the more you fear God, the more you chase God and I wanted to say that it's
[46:51.320 --> 47:03.040]  an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[47:03.040 --> 47:13.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:13.600 --> 47:28.640]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.640 --> 47:33.920]  So why do all the major universities that are state funded, badmouth America, call for
[47:33.920 --> 47:41.000]  race war, put down capitalism because the U.S. had half the wealth, 4% of the population
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.560]  in 1955, the globalists wrote up the textbooks, the plan to transfer all the wealth out to
[47:46.560 --> 47:52.360]  China and other countries to use that to set up a world government planetary authoritarianism.
[47:52.360 --> 47:58.320]  2018, Apple is under the Chinese government control, they've now banned sending out the
[47:58.320 --> 48:03.200]  Taiwanese emoji, no one even seems to care and now they say they're going to start censoring
[48:03.200 --> 48:08.000]  you even on your own private text messages criticizing China and they've got your iPhone
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.280]  keys, they've got your photos, they've got the cloud and Apple said that's just the way
[48:13.280 --> 48:16.600]  it is, they think you're habituated to accept it.
[48:16.600 --> 48:21.320]  Just like three days ago, Chertoff, the guy that personally made 30 something million
[48:21.320 --> 48:25.400]  off the naked body machines, his company made two billion, he said, you know what, it's
[48:25.400 --> 48:30.400]  too late, you're habituated, there is no privacy, everything's on the cloud, it's over,
[48:30.400 --> 48:31.400]  you will assimilate.
[48:31.400 --> 48:33.160]  See how that works?
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.400]  Total world government, total surveillance, big tech companies all lining up to move to
[48:37.400 --> 48:43.320]  China, they're going to run it all year and a half ago, the Chinese dictator went to Davos
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.720]  and he said, with Yunker in a statement, he said, we will stop Trump in America, global
[48:47.720 --> 48:51.840]  government will continue, they shook hands and he said, move all your command bases
[48:51.840 --> 48:56.340]  to us, we will let you run anything you want, you'll be liability protected, Yunker said
[48:56.340 --> 49:00.200]  absolutely, we'll start launching laws that shut down the US internet, we'll be exempt
[49:00.200 --> 49:07.160]  with you and they said, absolutely, let's do it and it's public and it's on and Trump
[49:07.160 --> 49:10.160]  is just trying to go over there and say, listen, you're not going to have a one way street
[49:10.160 --> 49:15.080]  anymore where we pay for everything if you're going to side with the Chinese communists,
[49:15.080 --> 49:20.520]  that's really what's happening, they've all broken their deal that they had, China's not
[49:20.520 --> 49:23.960]  supposed to militarily expand outside the South China Sea, they're supposed to be given
[49:23.960 --> 49:28.560]  economic dominance though, the old globalist plan is being broken because it was always
[49:28.560 --> 49:35.280]  planned to be broken, so remember when you watch Homeland or you watch Sasha Bara Cohen's
[49:35.280 --> 49:41.200]  new show on the same channel or when you watch Colbert and all the rest of the shows attacking
[49:41.200 --> 49:46.640]  myself and Trump and saying horrible things, remember, they're the cowards, they're the
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.000]  cowards, they work for the big corporations that want the Chinese market and to be in
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.440]  the Chinese market, you've got to comply with their censorship, you think Sasha Bara
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.320]  Cohen with all his bodyguards, like slave Americans, he sees himself as an elitist,
[50:01.320 --> 50:06.880]  owning guns, no, so he goes out and acts dumb with guns, wearing a make America great again
[50:06.880 --> 50:10.920]  hat, what's he saying, we're not going to make America great again, we're going to blow
[50:10.920 --> 50:18.160]  America's head off because Cohen's smarter than you, he's better than you, he runs you,
[50:18.160 --> 50:24.280]  he owns you and he's going to show you, let's see now Cohen's scared, Hillary's scared
[50:24.280 --> 50:30.360]  and all the rest of these guys are scared because they did all this selling out and
[50:30.360 --> 50:33.320]  all this arrogant garbage, it didn't turn out the way they thought before I get to the
[50:33.320 --> 50:38.880]  congressional clips right through this segment and the next, let me just, if you're TV viewer,
[50:38.880 --> 50:45.960]  pull this up for me crew, CNN lobbies Facebook to shut down info wars and look at the smile
[50:45.960 --> 50:54.080]  of the executive at CNN, man, he's in charge, he's part of the establishment, social media,
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.960]  giant admits it down ranks and basically shadow bands info wars but says a full band would
[50:58.960 --> 51:17.680]  cause lawsuits and tries to explain to CNN, it's just mind boggling how obvious this is,
[51:17.680 --> 51:24.920]  now disgusting and how ridiculous, after failing in its efforts to have YouTube shut down the
[51:24.920 --> 51:31.440]  Alex Jones channel, CNN is now lobbying Facebook to shut down info wars, an article for CNN
[51:31.440 --> 51:38.320]  senior media reporter Oliver Darcy, so he's the head of their media operations explains
[51:38.320 --> 51:45.360]  how he tried to convince Facebook top brass to terminate our Facebook presence, wow, talk
[51:45.360 --> 51:51.240]  about a lawsuit, Facebook invited me to an event today where the company aimed to tout
[51:51.240 --> 51:56.080]  its commitment to fighting fake news and misinformation, I asked them why info wars
[51:56.080 --> 52:00.520]  is still allowed on the platform, I didn't get a good answer, but at the end he says
[52:00.520 --> 52:06.400]  well they admit that they're censoring them down to nothing but that's not enough, CNN,
[52:06.400 --> 52:10.800]  the kings of fake news, the kings of fake WMDs, the kings of there's no Martin Luther King
[52:10.800 --> 52:22.920]  bust, the kings of all the lies they tell, and the fake news they push, and then they
[52:22.920 --> 52:28.240]  have the nerve to then pointed us and say shut us down, what an un-American group of
[52:28.240 --> 52:35.240]  dirtbags, what an un-American group of scum, and I've got the stack of news here where
[52:35.240 --> 52:40.000]  they brag, oh Jones was going to publish a book with a particular publisher called the
[52:40.000 --> 52:45.360]  war for the future, they went out and threatened everybody and said don't do it till the publishers
[52:45.360 --> 52:48.600]  dropped out, which I could self publish and make it even bigger and we're planning to
[52:48.600 --> 52:52.960]  do that, but we, CNN, we wanted to let you try to censor it first and create that allura
[52:52.960 --> 53:01.000]  first dumbasses, but the point is, is that there they are, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones,
[53:01.000 --> 53:08.000]  the game author Neil Strauss partnering on a book, they go on saying shut it down, info
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.440]  wars main YouTube channel is two strikes away from being banned, CNN, and they say we have
[53:12.440 --> 53:16.520]  been talking to YouTube and won it banned and have been, and then they lied about what
[53:16.520 --> 53:23.920]  I was even saying to get it banned, video, dim lawmaker demands Twitter censor info wars,
[53:23.920 --> 53:30.320]  this is in congressional hearings, so I'm going to ask you all, what are you going
[53:30.320 --> 53:35.000]  to do about this, you need to understand we are the avant-garde, the local station you're

[54:26.640 --> 54:32.600]  platforms, and we're here talking about what's really happening, we're here day one exposing
[54:32.600 --> 54:38.640]  the illegal FBI Clinton cabal of hatchet men and women to shut down Trump and to illegally
[54:38.640 --> 54:43.040]  surveil him and try to remove him and they denied all that, it's confirmed, they surveilled
[54:43.040 --> 54:50.960]  him, hell, I was reading Politico yesterday, they had the headline, Mueller listening to
[54:50.960 --> 54:57.680]  Manafort's phone calls and using it to try to block his legal strategy, that's totally
[54:57.680 --> 55:06.560]  illegal, but they put it in the news to set the precedent to do stuff like that.
[55:06.560 --> 55:12.560]  We are in a new world, ladies and gentlemen, we come back, I'm going to play a compilation
[55:12.560 --> 55:16.080]  of Trump talking about CNN being fake news, hey, just because somebody calls you fake
[55:16.080 --> 55:17.080]  news, does it make you fake news?
[55:17.080 --> 55:20.920]  No, the fact that you're known liars that are anti-American scum, that makes you fake
[55:20.920 --> 55:21.920]  news.
[55:21.920 --> 55:28.040]  In fact, we have time to go out with a little Mars attack montage where we equate the aliens
[55:28.040 --> 55:33.800]  saying don't run, we're your friends with CNN, now let's go ahead and go out to break
[55:33.800 --> 55:38.880]  with that right now because it says it all and then please, feel free to, I'm going
[55:38.880 --> 55:44.240]  to retweet this video of CNN being fake news, hope everybody shares it at real Alex Jones
[55:44.240 --> 55:45.840]  right now, here it is.
[55:45.840 --> 55:51.280]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and that is
[55:51.280 --> 55:53.480]  really, really an awful situation.
[55:53.480 --> 56:08.280]  We are not the enemy of the American people, we love the American people.
[56:08.280 --> 56:13.080]  We are not the enemy of the American people, we love the American people, we love the American
[56:13.080 --> 56:17.080]  We love the American people.
[56:17.080 --> 56:19.080]  They came in peace.
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.080]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[56:35.080 --> 56:46.080]  They're trying to tear down our borders. They're trying to cause race war.
[56:46.080 --> 56:49.080]  They're trying to stop us from getting paid our fair share out of NATO.
[56:49.080 --> 56:53.080]  They're trying to screw us over because they were hired and trained by multinationals
[56:53.080 --> 56:57.080]  to capture this country via corporate social takeover in their own words.
[56:57.080 --> 57:01.080]  But now America is awake. Europe is awake. Latin America is awake.
[57:01.080 --> 57:05.080]  Everybody's waking up to the corporate colonization that's going on
[57:05.080 --> 57:10.080]  and the corporate system of neocolonial rule.
[57:10.080 --> 57:13.080]  Everyone knows what's happening now who has a brain.
[57:13.080 --> 57:17.080]  And so the globalists are going to get a lot nastier before they give up.
[57:17.080 --> 57:21.080]  But in the end, they're going to have to give up because the worm is turned.
[57:21.080 --> 57:26.080]  They're on the wrong side of history. There's been a global political realignment to crony capitalism.
[57:26.080 --> 57:28.080]  We'll be back with hour number two. Stay with us.
[57:28.080 --> 57:31.080]  Who's the president of the United States?
[57:31.080 --> 57:34.080]  The U.S. president is Donald Trump.
[57:40.080 --> 57:43.080]  Alexa, who's the president of the United States?
[57:43.080 --> 57:45.080]  Donald J. Trump.
[57:45.080 --> 57:47.080]  Stay with us.
[57:49.080 --> 57:53.080]  This 4th of July is special. Everybody can see it. They can feel it.
[57:53.080 --> 57:58.080]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[57:58.080 --> 58:02.080]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance to the globalists.
[58:02.080 --> 58:05.080]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters
[58:05.080 --> 58:07.080]  to think about Info Wars now more than ever.
[58:07.080 --> 58:12.080]  And what would the world be like if Info Wars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[58:12.080 --> 58:14.080]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported Info Wars?
[58:14.080 --> 58:16.080]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[58:16.080 --> 58:19.080]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[58:19.080 --> 58:24.080]  So please, think about Info Wars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time
[58:24.080 --> 58:26.080]  on this 4th of July that's so historic.
[58:26.080 --> 58:29.080]  We have record sales going on right now.
[58:29.080 --> 58:31.080]  Free shipping on hundreds of different items.
[58:31.080 --> 58:36.080]  More than 20 items are 50% off like Rain Force Plus, X2 is 40% off.
[58:36.080 --> 58:39.080]  Knockout sleep aid 1776.
[58:39.080 --> 58:42.080]  Silver Bullets, $9.95 little silver.
[58:42.080 --> 58:44.080]  And free shipping, you can't beat that.
[58:44.080 --> 58:47.080]  This 4th of July is special and our sales are special to match it.
[58:47.080 --> 58:50.080]  InfoWarsStore.com
[59:17.080 --> 59:21.080]  Because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[59:21.080 --> 59:26.080]  that everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[59:26.080 --> 59:32.080]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[59:32.080 --> 59:38.080]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos,
[59:38.080 --> 59:40.080]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[59:40.080 --> 59:47.080]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[59:47.080 --> 1:00:16.080]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:28.080]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting, World Wide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:39.080]  Alright, I promise, next segment I'm going to get into the highlights of the incredible Strock and other FBI preachers
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:44.080]  that have been Democratic hatchet men, they're not really FBI agents, that have been grilled in Congress today.
[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:47.080]  It's amazing, it's coming up next segment.
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:52.080]  But if you just joined us, they have Sasha Barrett Collins stalking InfoWars.
[1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:58.080]  And I'm exclusively now learning that this has been going on for six months, putting the pieces together.
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:02.080]  And it's all confirmed, Breitbart's got it. He's been going around like an InfoWars listener,
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:07.080]  dressed up in InfoWars t-shirts, bumper stickers. It's not just the stickers on his laptop.
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:11.080]  He's been saying he's an InfoWars supporter and then saying horrible racist stuff.
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:15.080]  You've got CNN calling for us to be banned off Facebook and once that president said it's everybody,
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:20.080]  Facebook says we're already censoring him down to nothing. That's why you got to actually go to InfoWars.com.
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:26.080]  But imagine, just if you say somebody's fake news like CNN executives do, but they're really the fake news,
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:32.080]  does that mean just it happens? It's tortuous interference. It's criminal war against other people's free speech.
[1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:38.080]  It's racketeering on its face. So here's the president really calling out who the fake news is.
[1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:45.080]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...
[1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:47.080]  I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:48.080]  Doesn't that undermine...
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:49.080]  Very fake news, though.
[1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:50.080]  I know, but aren't you...
[1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:53.080]  Good pause. Back it up. Start over again.
[1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:58.080]  Hillary created the term. They ran with it. Then everybody goes, OK, what's real? What's fake?
[1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:03.080]  We think you're the standard of fake news, CNN, along with MSNBC and NPR.
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:08.080]  You're famous for being a bunch of pack of liars. I think everybody's asleep and you rule on America.
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:15.080]  And so then you're like, how dare you call us fake news? You little cockroaches. You are fake news. Here it is.
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:17.080]  Sit down. Sit down. We'll put it there.
[1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:22.080]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...
[1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:24.080]  I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:25.080]  Doesn't that undermine...
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:26.080]  Very fake news, though.
[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:27.080]  I know, but aren't you...
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:30.080]  Go ahead.
[1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:32.080]  Real news, Mr. President. Real news.
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:39.080]  Aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press?
[1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:41.080]  No, criticizing you is not violent First Amendment term.
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:43.080]  You don't like fake news.
[1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:49.080]  And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It's fake. Phony. Fake.
[1:02:49.080 --> 1:02:50.080]  Good pause again, please.
[1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:56.080]  Think about how they always say Trump's violent the First Amendment saying they're lying about him.
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:02:59.080]  Then they're calling for everybody to be shut down and off the air.
[1:02:59.080 --> 1:03:03.080]  Again, they're the ones. They're the authoritarian danger of the First Amendment.
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.080]  They're the enemy.
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:08.080]  And then they say us saying their liars is violent the First Amendment.
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:10.080]  You little lying roach.
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:14.080]  We're just countering you. You dirtbag. You anti-free speech maggot.
[1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:16.080]  Owned by foreign chai comms.
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:18.080]  Go back to this piece of crap.
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:26.080]  A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:27.080]  And they are.
[1:03:27.080 --> 1:03:29.080]  They are the enemy of the people.
[1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:31.080]  Damn right.
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:34.080]  It's a disgrace what took place. It's a disgrace.
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:38.080]  And I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohn.
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:40.080]  Sir, since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:41.080]  Go ahead.
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:42.080]  No, Mr. President-Elect.
[1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:43.080]  Go ahead.
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:44.080]  Go ahead.
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:45.080]  No, not you.
[1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:46.080]  Not you.
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:47.080]  Can you give us a chance?
[1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:48.080]  Your organization is terrible.
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:49.080]  You are attacking our news organization.
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:50.080]  Your organization is terrible.
[1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:51.080]  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:52.080]  Go ahead.
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:53.080]  Quiet.
[1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:54.080]  Quiet.
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:55.080]  Mr. President-Elect.
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:56.080]  Go ahead.
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:03:57.080]  Mr. President-Elect, can you give us a question?
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:03:58.080]  Don't be rude.
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:03:59.080]  You are attacking us.
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:00.080]  Can you give us a question?
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:01.080]  Don't be rude.
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:02.080]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:03.080]  Can you give us a question?
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:04.080]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:05.080]  Can you state-
[1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:06.080]  Can you state-
[1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:07.080]  You are fake news.
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:08.080]  Sir, can you state-
[1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:10.080]  American closest allies were frustrated with you and angry with you, and that you were
[1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:15.080]  angry with them, and that you were leaving here early to go meet for more friendlier talks
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:16.080]  with Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:17.080]  And I'm wondering if you-
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:18.080]  Well, but-
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:24.080]  If you view it the same way, and do you view the U.S. alliance system shifting under your
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:26.080]  presidency in a way-
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:27.080]  Who are you with out of curiosity?
[1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:28.080]  CNN.
[1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:31.080]  I figured, fake news, CNN.
[1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:32.080]  The worst.
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:34.080]  But, you know, I could tell by the-
[1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:36.080]  I have no idea you were CNN after the question.
[1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:39.080]  I was just curious as to who you were with you were CNN.
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:44.080]  I would say that the level of relationship is a 10.
[1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:47.080]  But if you go, as an example, you're CNN.
[1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:52.080]  I mean, it's story after story after story is bad.
[1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:53.080]  I won.
[1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:54.080]  I won.
[1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:26.080]  If you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[1:05:53.080 --> 1:06:21.080]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:22.080]  Welcome back.
[1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:28.080]  I'm Alex Jones, your host in FullWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the most hated, dreaded sites
[1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:33.080]  of the world by communists, by globalists, by pedophiles, by scum, by organized crime,
[1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:40.080]  by megamanks, loved by freedom lovers all over the planet, loved by patriots, loved by Christians,
[1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:44.080]  loved by gun owners, loved by common sense, red-blooded humans.
[1:06:44.080 --> 1:06:48.080]  And I am just very honored that CNN and others are calling for us to be completely banned off
[1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:49.080]  the Internet.
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:52.080]  We covered that last hour.
[1:06:52.080 --> 1:06:57.080]  Sasha Baron Cohen, we learned, tried to lie to us just like Sarah Palin six months ago,
[1:06:57.080 --> 1:07:00.080]  saying, oh, it's a story about Trump people versus other folks.
[1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:02.080]  It's a very fair and balanced program.
[1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:05.080]  And I said, oh, like Homeland that's tailored around lying about me?
[1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:07.080]  I said, go fly a kite.
[1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:13.080]  Well, I reportedly, according to sources, they did do a partial infiltration of InfoWars,
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:16.080]  not the office, but through some of our sources.
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:21.080]  And I may be revealing some of that very, very soon.
[1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:23.080]  Obviously people signed on disclosures.
[1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:28.080]  But if they've been involved in fraud and if Cohen lied to them, we're going to get them some lawyers
[1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:34.080]  and we'll be able to get around all that very easily because Sasha Baron Cohen is a fake news fraud.
[1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:35.080]  He isn't a comedian.
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:38.080]  He goes out and defames people and then hides behind entertainment.
[1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:44.080]  And then they source what he says about me and other shows say about me and then use that to try to take us off the air.
[1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:45.080]  So that's coming up.
[1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:53.080]  But the good news is GOP lawmakers threaten FBI agent Peter Strzok with contempt for refusing to answer questions about Mueller probe.
[1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:58.080]  Same thing with or US Marshall serve subpoena on Mr. Ed.
[1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:03.080]  I mean, FBI lawyer Lisa Page Wilbur.
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:09.080]  Good light says threatening to hold her in contempt.
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:14.080]  So let's go ahead and go to the congressman letting her know how the cow ate the cabbage or I guess how the horse ate the cabbage.
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:15.080]  Here it is.
[1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:16.080]  Order.
[1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:17.080]  That may be.
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:18.080]  But I appeal your ruin.
[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:20.080]  The gentleman is not recognized.
[1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:22.080]  Just take back over your time and smile away.
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:28.080]  Knowing this, will you answer the committee's question as directed or do you refuse to answer the committee's question?
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:36.080]  Mr. Chairman, as you know, counsel for the FBI has directed me not to answer questions about the ongoing investigation.
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:39.080]  As you also know, counsel for the FBI is sitting here behind me.
[1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:41.080]  May I consult with them?
[1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:44.080]  You may consult with your own counsel.
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:46.080]  But I may not consult with the FBI's counsel.
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:48.080]  Only with your own counsel.
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:50.080]  Look at what a weasel that enemy is.
[1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:52.080]  Mr. Chairman, there's no basis for that.
[1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:56.080]  If you want to see the enemy of the country, they always have this.
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:58.080]  They could be black, white, Hispanic.
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:00.080]  They have this arrogance.
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:02.080]  They're going to show America.
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:03.080]  They're the bosses.
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:04.080]  They're in charge.
[1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:06.080]  This is the guy.
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:09.080]  He later testifies that he was never biased in his history at the FBI.
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:10.080]  He's like insurance policy.
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:11.080]  He won't be president.
[1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:12.080]  We're going to stop him.
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:14.080]  Hillary's the president.
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:16.080]  Covered up the Hillary investigation.
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:20.080]  And then he sits there, this arrogant little rat bastard.
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:24.080]  And with his ugly girlfriend.
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:26.080]  And I don't just mean that to be, I mean, spiritually ugly.
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:31.080]  It just shows what a bunch of broke back, stupid rats they are.
[1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:39.080]  And they've all got chips on their shoulders because Peter Strock looks like somebody nobody want to go have a beer with.
[1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:48.080]  His wife or his girlfriend looks like somebody basically, you know, gets her meals out of cat boxes.
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:55.080]  And you just look at these culturally, spiritually dead people and you know why they want to piss on us.
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:58.080]  Because they hate real Americans, folks.
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:00.080]  I mean, these people are trash.
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:08.080]  And the reason I say that is, as a strong, successful person my whole life, I always cared about everybody and didn't feel like I wanted to put people down.
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:14.080]  But when you are a piece of garbage like them, they want to hurt everybody and be on top.
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:16.080]  They're like Eddie Haskell on PCP.
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:18.080]  I'm going to stop.
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:20.080]  Just if you're a radio listener, you can't see it.
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:21.080]  It's probably a good thing.
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:25.080]  Just this lying, anti-American person that hates the American voters, all of them.
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:28.080]  Just look at these little nobody weasels.
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:35.080]  They're the scum that the chai comms and the globalist and the big banks in Hollywood could hire to eff this country over.
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:42.080]  And it feels so good to see them circling hell.
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:44.080]  No, I mean, this is what's been beating us.
[1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:51.080]  It's like the Bible says in Revelation, when they finally captured the devil and put him in a cage for a thousand years, people come and look at him and they say,
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:54.080]  This is the thing that almost destroyed everybody?
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:55.080]  Look at Hillary.
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:56.080]  This.
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:10:57.080]  Look at Weinstein.
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:10:58.080]  Look at Obama.
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:00.080]  These people.
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:04.080]  These are the people holding us back.
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:05.080]  Move, bitch.
[1:11:05.080 --> 1:11:07.080]  Get out the way.
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:08.080]  Move out the way, bitch.
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:10.080]  Get out the way.
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:13.080]  I don't usually use mild and family-friendly stuff.
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:18.080]  But when the shoe fits, I want to go out with the intro of Ludacris Move Bitch.
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:20.080]  It was a theme song with the campaign.
[1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:26.080]  It's just too good to not play.
[1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:32.080]  Moody, moody, moody, moody, moody, moody.
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:33.080]  You see them headlights?
[1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:35.080]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:37.080]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:38.080]  Tell me that.
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:39.080]  Excuse me.
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:40.080]  I'm having a little bit of fun here.
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:41.080]  Go back to that weasel.
[1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:42.080]  Put him back up there.
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:43.080]  I apologize for the family show.
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:44.080]  I'm not doing anymore.
[1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:45.080]  Go ahead.
[1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:48.080]  Only with your own counsel.
[1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:51.080]  Mr. Chairman, there's no basis for that.
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:53.080]  He's all with the FBI counsel.
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:54.080]  He's an FBI employee.
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:55.080]  The gentleman is not recognized.
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:56.080]  Look at that smile.
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:58.080]  And the chairman is not being proper.
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:00.080]  The chairman is being proper.
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:04.080]  But when this can't be directed not to confer with his attorney?
[1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:07.080]  The FBI is not his attorney.
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:09.080]  His attorney is seated behind him.
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:11.080]  He's an employee like criminal.
[1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:12.080]  He's already done.
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:13.080]  He may do so.
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:15.080]  And his attorney may consult with the FBI attorney.
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:16.080]  Pause again.
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:18.080]  Notice why he can confer with the other person's attorney.
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:20.080]  Because they're all in a 43-person cabal against America
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:24.080]  with those pieces of trash to control the blue cities.
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:27.080]  And San Francisco is losing all of its conferences now
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:30.080]  because there's so much feces in vomit and heroin needles.
[1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:31.080]  ABC News 7.
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:34.080]  San Francisco losing lucrative convention industry
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:37.080]  because of streets filled with needles and feces.
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:42.080]  Everywhere you run things, it's little demonic pig creatures
[1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:44.080]  feeding on a bunch of slaves.
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:45.080]  Good God.
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:46.080]  Let me stop right there.
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:48.080]  Let's just go back to these people.
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:50.080]  Just looking at Democrats does this to me.
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:51.080]  Go ahead.
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:55.080]  Isn't the privilege that of the FBI and shouldn't the FBI counsel
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.080]  be solicited on that point?
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:00.080]  Just take that away right now.
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:03.080]  Let's just get this out.
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:04.080]  Let's just get this out.
[1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:06.080]  And then we'll go back here as we got it.
[1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:14.080]  Mr. Chairman, my counsel has reiterated
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:17.080]  that counsel for the FBI has directed
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:20.080]  that I may not answer that question.
[1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:23.080]  Mr. Shruck, in a moment we will continue with the hearing,
[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:26.080]  but based on your refusal to answer the question,
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:29.080]  at the conclusion of the day, we will be recessing the hearing
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:32.080]  and you will be subject to recall to allow the committee
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:35.080]  to consider proceeding with a contempt citation.
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:36.080]  A point of order, Mr. Chairman.
[1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:39.080]  Will the committee also consider contempt for Mr. Bannon,
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:41.080]  who refused to answer Mr. Gowdy's questions
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:43.080]  when he was actually under subpoena?
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:45.080]  That is not a proper point of order in this year.
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:46.080]  Parliamentary inquiry.
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:47.080]  Mr. Gowdy, do you remember that?
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:48.080]  Parliamentary inquiry.
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:50.080]  The time is controlled by the gentlemen.
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:53.080]  Mr. Shruck, the last point when he's looking at the chairman.
[1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:55.080]  He's literally like a demon rat by me.
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:59.080]  I almost had America.
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:00.080]  I'll get you, Americans.
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:01.080]  I'll get you.
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:02.080]  It's I run it.
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:03.080]  I run it.
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:04.080]  I ain't got nothing.
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:05.080]  Not you.
[1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:06.080]  All sold out.
[1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:07.080]  The foreign powers all sold out.
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:08.080]  The chai comms.
[1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:09.080]  Look at him.
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:10.080]  Look at those devil eyes.
[1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:12.080]  It's my country.
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:13.080]  Your mother's in hell.
[1:14:13.080 --> 1:14:14.080]  We control everything.
[1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:16.080]  Yeah, you don't control nothing.
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:17.080]  The spirit is rising.
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:19.080]  You're going down.
[1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:22.080]  Do we have the ludicrous song?
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:25.080]  Radio friendly?
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:28.080]  No, not that.
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:29.080]  I can't help it.
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:30.080]  I apologize.
[1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:31.080]  I got to play it.
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:32.080]  Just get out the way, Shruck.
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:38.080]  Get out the way with your stupid control freak chicken neck girlfriend who thought she beat
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:39.080]  in America.
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:40.080]  America's awake now.
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:41.080]  Move, Hillary.
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:15:07.080]  Get out the way.
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:08.080]  Get out the way.
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:09.080]  Get out the way.
[1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:10.080]  Get out the way.
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:14.400]  Get out the way, get out the way, get out the way
[1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:19.840]  Oh no, the fight's out, I'm about to punch your lights out
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:25.120]  Get the back, back, guard the grill, it's all wrong, we can't stay still
[1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:29.920]  I've been drinking and busting too, and I've been thinking of busting you
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:33.440]  Oh, got your mother's forehead, and if your friends up in
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:34.720]  Oh, wow
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:38.160]  They'll be motionless, causing confusion, destroying the peace
[1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:44.080]  Not into losing, we run in the streets, so bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers
[1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:48.800]  Is there a bumper on your nose, doing a hundred on the highway

[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:25.280]  We employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:30.960]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:34.880]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:38.400]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:42.080]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:47.360]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:52.960]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:20:18.560]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it
[1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:29.360]  Well, Larry Grafwall was a Green Beret highly decorated Vietnam, a Patriot going to college
[1:20:29.360 --> 1:20:34.080]  And the weathermen were actually at his college openly trying to recruit military members at the time
[1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:38.160]  For their whole malice operation and he got into their organization
[1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:41.600]  They were openly, I mean how they were going to take over the schools, create a race war
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:45.200]  Put 50 million people in camps, kill 25 million, we'll play the clip coming up later
[1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:47.120]  And you know the great part about it, we all live forever
[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:50.320]  I'm my great-great-grandparents, my children will be me as long as we go on
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:53.760]  So Larry Grafwall is with us now in the body of Lindsey Grafwall
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:57.200]  And of course her mother's with her as well, that's how this works, this magic of life
[1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:00.400]  And she goes out to prayer vigil, she's been to a bunch of these
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:03.280]  Where sometimes there's 50 or 60 of them, sometimes there's just seven or eight
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:05.440]  Looks like in the video I saw this weekend
[1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:11.120]  And Antifa came in, looks like you've got a transsexual there
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:13.840]  Leading them in their prayer meeting, it's open to everybody
[1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:17.120]  A lot of liberals actually come out there, classical liberals who are for free speech
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:21.200]  And here comes, let's talk about 15 thugs to then mainly attack women
[1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:27.120]  And a transsexual and a Hispanic man
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:30.640]  So, and then of course they fight them off and they leave
[1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:37.680]  So it is interesting to see the tranny beat up four or five of them
[1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:42.000]  So, oh by the way, Facebook bans us, and so does when we use the word tranny
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.400]  Because they say that to word, Twitter voted to say it's mean
[1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:46.320]  I'm not being mean to anybody, that's the term they come up with
[1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:48.480]  I'm using a transsexual or whatever
[1:21:48.480 --> 1:21:50.320]  I don't care what you are, just don't teach it to kids
[1:21:50.320 --> 1:21:52.960]  Whether it be heterosexual or whatever it is, that's a side issue
[1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:56.560]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see all this, I'm describing it for radio listeners
[1:21:56.560 --> 1:22:00.480]  A lot of people email us and they go, why is Jones describing everything on air?
[1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:04.720]  Because we're on almost 270 radio affiliates and it's a huge audience
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:08.240]  And it's bigger while people are listening than all the other streams
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:10.160]  TV stations, everything
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:14.320]  So I'm kind of narrating for folks when things aren't radio friendly
[1:22:14.320 --> 1:22:15.520]  That's what's happening
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:17.600]  We pioneered simulcasting radio on TV
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:19.840]  So that's what we do
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:21.120]  Because it's very confusing
[1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:24.480]  I'm talking about something and not describing it
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:29.600]  So she joins us in the middle of the left saying ban info wars, ban Trump off Twitter
[1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:35.280]  We've got all this craziness going on right now, it's all up on infowars.com
[1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:37.600]  And Lindsay joins us, she goes out there
[1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:40.640]  And again, this happened in Portland a month ago
[1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:42.240]  They beat up a bunch of men, women and children
[1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:44.240]  There's only a few men there in the prayer vigil
[1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:47.600]  So then a few dozen men like Rufio show up
[1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:50.080]  And even though they're 10 to 1, they beat the butts of those guys
[1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:53.920]  And so again, these are all in blue cities
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:55.840]  Where the police stand down and allow this to happen
[1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:58.160]  It's very, very, very shameful
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:01.760]  And I don't know where on earth you get men that are willing to attack women
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:04.560]  I mean, you see the left claiming they love women
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:06.640]  They're going to take care of women and all men are bad
[1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:08.400]  But then it's the left I always see
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:10.320]  And I was trying to get into Trump's inauguration
[1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:13.360]  That was attacking women trying to get in
[1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:15.520]  So there's just something about these cowards
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:18.480]  That, and I guess they thought when they punched the
[1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:21.280]  Large transsexual that it was a woman
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:24.240]  Because then the transsexual proving it's a man
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:25.520]  Beats up a bunch of them
[1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:27.120]  So you can't make this up
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:28.560]  Transsexuals beating them up
[1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:30.800]  One guy beating a bunch of women beating them up
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:34.400]  Lindsay Grathwall, we salute you
[1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:35.520]  We appreciate your courage
[1:23:35.520 --> 1:23:37.040]  Thanks for coming on to tell us what happened
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:38.800]  Thanks, Alex
[1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:39.920]  Thank you for having me on
[1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:41.920]  Yeah, it was crazy
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:45.040]  And that the transsexual she actually
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:46.320]  Her name is Amber Cummings
[1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:49.360]  And she actually threw that event in San Francisco on Saturday
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:54.720]  Yeah, she's actually she's out with us on the street
[1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:57.680]  She was in Portland with me and Joey and Rufio
[1:23:57.680 --> 1:23:59.280]  And all of us up there last month
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:01.120]  Which was really crazy
[1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:04.720]  And I can watch that video clip of Rufio knocking that guy out
[1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:06.560]  Over and over again and it never gets old
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:09.600]  So yeah, we went out there
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:12.880]  We we've been planning a prayer vigil for Tommy Robinson
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:14.640]  For over a month
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:17.840]  And as you see, we had a very small group of people that came out
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:20.640]  But we hadn't even been there for 10 minutes
[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:23.920]  And literally there were already people trying to attack us
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:27.280]  Part of this event is not on video
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:28.640]  Nobody got it on video
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:34.160]  But Amber actually knocked one of the antifa guys in the nose
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:36.080]  And I believe she probably broke his nose
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:37.520]  Because he was pretty bloody
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:41.600]  And that was before he came back with this group that you're showing
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:44.640]  They literally came back about 10 minutes later
[1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:47.120]  And they were obviously there to to fight
[1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:49.760]  And we called the cops
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:52.000]  The cops took about 30 minutes to get there
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:55.360]  Which was, you know, a pretty typical in these blue cities
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:58.320]  But San Francisco has usually been pretty good to us
[1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:01.360]  So we were kind of surprised that it took so long for them to show up
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:04.400]  But this is what happens
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:06.000]  This is what happens in these cities
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:07.840]  You know, you saw it in Portland
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:08.880]  You've seen it in San Francisco
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:09.920]  And we've seen it in Berkeley
[1:25:09.920 --> 1:25:11.680]  It happens in all these cities
[1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:14.000]  And basically they're trying to shut us down
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:16.320]  You know, at any cost
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:18.880]  They don't want us out there, you know, talking
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:20.400]  Anything that we have to say
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:22.640]  Anything that we're out there trying to promote
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:25.920]  This particular event, they said that we were racist
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:27.680]  That Tommy Robinson is racist
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:29.520]  And so that makes us racist
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:34.000]  And that was their whole reason for coming out and trying to stop us
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.800]  You know, it's amazing how
[1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:40.800]  Within very quickly you guys meeting
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:41.600]  They already show up meeting
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:42.960]  They're stalking you, they're watching you
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:44.640]  And even if folks don't want to get in the fights
[1:25:45.200 --> 1:25:46.720]  When you see these events happening
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:48.720]  You should go and wait across the street with your camera
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:50.160]  As if you're neutral
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:51.760]  Show you actually get what happens
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:53.520]  Because they attack folks that have cameras
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:56.160]  So if you can park your car, be ready, catch it on tape
[1:25:56.160 --> 1:25:59.200]  That's what we really need to get the full exchanges
[1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:00.640]  To document exactly what happened
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:02.880]  Yeah, and it's difficult
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:05.040]  Especially when you're in the mix of all of it
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:09.040]  It's difficult to get, you know, the whole thing on video
[1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:10.880]  I mean, I was videoing as well
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:12.560]  And I didn't even, you know
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:14.160]  I didn't even know some of the stuff happened
[1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:15.120]  Until it was all over
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:17.280]  Because it's hard to catch everything on video
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:19.440]  So what you just said is absolutely correct
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:21.040]  If someone, you know, sees it
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:22.400]  And they can get an advantage point
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:24.320]  Where they're across the street and get it on video
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:26.720]  We need to get these kind of things on video
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:28.640]  To show what's going on
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:29.840]  Because this is happening
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:32.960]  And this is happening in cities all over the country
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:34.240]  There are so many videos
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:36.320]  In fact, we showed it in a compilation of the show
[1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:38.160]  But it was my fault, I'll tell the crew
[1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:41.200]  Of just search engines, anti-foot punching women
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:42.640]  Hitting them and heads of bike locks
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:43.680]  Dragging them into crowds
[1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:45.760]  To be beating them over the head with eggs
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:47.040]  Blutting their noses
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:48.320]  There's new ones every few days
[1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:51.200]  Where men walk over and just punch women in the face
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:53.520]  It's like they pick who they think's weak
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:54.640]  Because I've been around anti-foot
[1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:56.480]  They don't, other than sticking up behind me
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:57.440]  And trying to hit me with clubs
[1:26:57.440 --> 1:26:59.360]  So I attack them so they can shoot me
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:01.040]  Because they bring guns out here in Austin
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.080]  They always seem to target who they think is weak
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:07.120]  Yes, they always go after the weakest
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:10.560]  And of course, when in a situation where we have
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:11.600]  Especially in San Francisco
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:14.880]  Where you have a few women and then there's a few men
[1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:17.040]  The men of course are always going to try to be out there
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:17.920]  To protect the women
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:19.280]  So when they go after the women
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:23.360]  Everyone kind of goes over to the woman
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:24.480]  Or whoever is getting attacked
[1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:26.560]  And then that also distracts other people
[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:27.920]  And then other people come in
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:30.560]  I mean, it turns into like, well, as you saw
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:31.600]  You can see it in the video
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:35.360]  It turns into a brawl, you know, a brawl
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:38.560]  And it's amazing that that encounter
[1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:40.960]  Went on for probably a good five minutes
[1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:42.480]  I mean, I don't know, I'm kind of guessing
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:44.880]  And nobody, I mean, people stood around
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:46.640]  You can see in the background
[1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:49.440]  You can see people walking by and just standing around
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:51.520]  And, you know, it's like, you know
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:54.400]  And even though they look like they're four to one to you
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:56.320]  Every time a woman or a man punches one
[1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:58.240]  They run and more gang up
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:00.560]  I mean, these are the archetypal whims
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:02.320]  Who attacks women?
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:03.920]  Everyone knows it's the bad guys
[1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:06.320]  Right, right, and they do
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:08.560]  They always go after the weaker ones, the women
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:10.320]  Or if they find, if they think that, you know
[1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:11.760]  There's a man that's weaker
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:12.880]  They'll go after that man
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:14.880]  For obvious reasons
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:16.160]  I've seen them do it in wheelchairs
[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:17.200]  Let me ask you this
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:19.520]  Don't they know they're summoning the whirlwind though?
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:25.120]  I mean, I think that they should realize by now
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:27.760]  I mean, what's happening is, is that you have people
[1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:30.080]  That are seeing this happen all across the country
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:31.360]  And people are getting angry
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:33.040]  And people are starting to get up and stand up
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:34.160]  Like what you saw in Portland
[1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:36.880]  We had so many patriots out there in Portland
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:39.280]  And as you see, I mean, we, we've
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.040]  We're gonna take it
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:42.640]  We're not gonna take this anymore
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:43.520]  I mean, they were saying
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:45.280]  Which means the Cowards are gonna bring guns next
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:46.640]  They got caught with guns, by the way
[1:28:46.640 --> 1:28:48.000]  That got hushed up in the nose
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.280]  So that's the problem
[1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:52.080]  We'll be right back with Lindsay Rathwall
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:55.440]  Stay with us
[1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:54.640]  Fire your flyswatter
[1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:56.160]  Get your bug assault today
[1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:00.480]  This 4th of July is special
[1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:01.360]  Everybody can see it
[1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:02.400]  They can feel it
[1:30:02.400 --> 1:30:06.000]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:06.800]  To their tyranny
[1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:10.000]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:10.640]  The globalist
[1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:12.320]  That's why this 4th of July
[1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:13.920]  I'm asking all of our great supporters
[1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:16.320]  To think about Info Wars now more than ever
[1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:18.480]  And what would the world be like if Info Wars
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:20.160]  Wasn't there resisting the globalist
[1:30:20.160 --> 1:30:21.600]  What would have happened
[1:30:21.600 --> 1:30:23.200]  If you hadn't supported Info Wars
[1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:25.200]  We would not be having the victories we have today
[1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:27.040]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening
[1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:28.320]  But the enemy is striking back
[1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:30.720]  So please, think about Info Wars
[1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:31.840]  And funding our operation
[1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:33.520]  While you get great products at the same time

[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:15.360]  That stood against the peer pressure
[1:31:15.360 --> 1:31:16.560]  That stood against the threats
[1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:18.400]  That have now changed the world

[1:31:24.400 --> 1:31:26.800]  And now because of their intensifying censorship
[1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:28.000]  It's more important than ever
[1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:30.640]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com

[1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:49.200]  But the bare minimum you can do

[1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:27.360]  And that's why Hillary and Soros and the UN
[1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:28.960]  And the Democrats in Congress all say
[1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:29.760]  They want to shut down
[1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:31.360]  That's what I'm seeing in my today
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:33.440]  Shut InfoWars off in the First Amendment
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:35.840]  They got law firms
[1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:37.760]  University of Georgetown
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:39.440]  Saying we want Jones taken off air
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:42.000]  It's unbelievable
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:42.960]  The lawyers I've got it
[1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:44.160]  So they've never seen anything like it
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:46.800]  Now, Lindsey Grathwall's father
[1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:48.800]  Was a great patriot, a green beret
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:51.920]  They tried to recruit him into the weathermen
[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:54.160]  He got into the highest levels
[1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:56.080]  While they were conducting hundreds of bombings
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:57.680]  And later helped send him to prison
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:33:59.840]  These, of course, were the mentors of
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:02.240]  Barack Hussein Obama
[1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:05.680]  And now we're facing this right now
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:08.720]  And she was there in Portland two weeks ago
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:10.640]  And then in San Francisco this last weekend
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:12.800]  Where they had a much smaller group
[1:34:12.800 --> 1:34:17.120]  And were attacked by vicious antifa
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:19.120]  And again, I would describe these pervigils
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:21.520]  As liberal conservative people that believe in free speech
[1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:24.640]  I mean, after all, a transsexual
[1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:26.240]  Was the person that actually called for the meeting
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:27.040]  For free speech
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:30.720]  And so this is really waking a lot of people up
[1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:33.360]  But she was issuing really a dire warning earlier
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:35.520]  About how they're reaping the whirlwind
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:36.640]  But I think they're meant
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:37.360]  They don't know what they're doing
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:38.400]  They're being sent out with the Democrats
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:39.680]  On record Soros funds them
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:41.840]  To get conservatives mad to come out and be violent
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:44.560]  So it's critical we not be offensively violent
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:46.880]  Like they tried to do in Charlottesville
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:48.400]  By colliding the two groups
[1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:49.680]  Which were ant alt right
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:50.560]  That's not what we are
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:53.920]  But let's play a clip from her dad decades ago
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:55.520]  Talking about her late father
[1:34:55.520 --> 1:34:58.480]  Talking about the weather underground
[1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:00.080]  And things they openly were talking about
[1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:00.560]  Here it is
[1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:04.080]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:05.520]  After we take over the government
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:09.280]  You know, we become responsible then
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:13.280]  For administrating, you know, 250 million people
[1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:16.400]  And there was no answers
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:19.680]  And no one had given any thought to economics
[1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:22.800]  How are you going to cloth and feed these people
[1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:26.560]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:28.640]  That the Cubans and the North Vietnamese
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:30.080]  And the Chinese and the Russians
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:33.360]  Would all want to occupy different portions
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:34.400]  Of the United States
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:38.160]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:41.120]  Would be to protect against what they call the counterrevolution
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:44.960]  And they felt that this counterrevolution
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:48.000]  Could best be guarded against
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:51.680]  By creating and establishing reeducation centers
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:52.560]  In the southwest
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:57.600]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:35:59.920]  Reeducated into the new way of thinking
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:04.160]  And teach them how things were going to be
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:07.360]  I ask, well what is going to happen to those people
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:08.640]  That we can't reeducate
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:11.360]  That are die-hard capitalists
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:15.120]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:18.320]  And when I pursued this further
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:20.480]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate
[1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:24.320]  25 million people in these reeducation centers
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:26.720]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:28.960]  25 million people
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:31.920]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:34.080]  With 25 people
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:37.760]  Most of which have graduate degrees
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:40.080]  From Columbia
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:43.840]  And other well-known educational centers
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:48.160]  And hear them figuring out the logistics
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:51.440]  For the elimination of 25 million people
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:53.280]  And they were dead serious
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:57.040]  Now there is a new bill introduced
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:36:58.640]  It's gotten almost no attention
[1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:02.000]  Epoch Times has reported on an unmasking antifa act
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.800]  In house proposed 15-year prison term
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:06.240]  Under the act anyone wearing a mask
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:08.320]  Who injures, threatens, intimidates or oppresses people
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:11.600]  In the free exercise of enjoyment of any right of privilege
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:13.120]  Will be imprisoned up to 15 years
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:14.880]  Will police blow their privilege
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:18.080]  When they unlawfully arrest or officially oppress
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:19.760]  And they can serve 5 to 10
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:21.440]  I think this is very reasonable
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:23.440]  The bill proposed in the U.S. House Representative
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:25.920]  Known as the Unmasking Antifa Act 2018
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:27.440]  Will seek to criminalize committing
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:29.360]  Certain offenses while in disguise
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:30.560]  I think it's a very good bill
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:32.800]  And it needs to be supported
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:34.480]  It's got a lot of cosponsors
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:37.760]  But we need to move this through the House of Representatives
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:38.400]  Right now
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:40.560]  Lindsey Grathwall
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:41.600]  Give us your take on this
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:43.520]  It's about time
[1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:45.280]  It's about time
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:47.920]  I absolutely, I mean
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:49.920]  This needs to get passed
[1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:52.160]  We need to get more people involved with this
[1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:53.440]  Because it's getting
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.920]  These attacks are getting worse
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:37:57.120]  They are getting
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:37:58.560]  When I was in Portland
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:00.320]  There's bombs being thrown at us
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:02.320]  Which I mean, we've had that happen before in Berkeley
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:03.360]  But these were bigger
[1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:05.760]  In San Francisco
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:07.920]  One of the things that we found out from the cops
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:09.040]  When they finally showed up
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:10.720]  Was that these people that were
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:13.280]  Because there was an Occupy ice protest down
[1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:16.080]  A few blocks down from where we were having the prayer vigil
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:19.440]  And anyways, the cops told us that Antifa actually had
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:23.040]  They described them as machetes
[1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:25.600]  And so my question was
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:27.680]  Well, why can't you arrest them?
[1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:29.360]  Or you know, how is that okay for them
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:30.640]  To be carrying around machetes?
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:32.480]  And they said, well, because it was in a sheath
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:33.920]  That was okay
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:37.520]  So, you know, it's only a matter of time
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:39.920]  And we need to be able to identify these people
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:42.560]  And these people that are committing these crimes
[1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:44.960]  Against others need to be held accountable
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:46.880]  And we can't do that if they're masked up
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:49.280]  I mean, you know, there's many times
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:50.880]  When we're not able to identify these people
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:51.760]  And they get away with it
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:55.600]  And so we absolutely need something in place
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:57.520]  So that these people, at the very least
[1:38:57.520 --> 1:38:59.280]  If they're going to go out there, they're unmasked
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:00.320]  So that we know who they are
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:01.760]  And they can be held accountable
[1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:04.800]  And let's be clear, MS-13 has been working with these folks
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:07.680]  And they, the treadmarks are machete
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:08.480]  This is Austin
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:09.920]  Oh, and Shroyer tried to go to a vigil
[1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:11.520]  For the young woman killed in San Francisco
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:15.200]  By the illegal alien and the virtue signaling jury
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:16.560]  Said that's fine, go ahead and kill her
[1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:17.520]  No jail time
[1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:18.960]  When he went, they said, are you scared, boy?
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:19.680]  You're not going in
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:22.240]  They started hitting with clubs, brandishing firearms
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:24.080]  I mean, this is next level
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:25.680]  And again, Blue City Police, Austin
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:27.520]  The average cop isn't bad here
[1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:28.560]  But they follow their orders
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:31.200]  They were right there watching this trash
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:33.040]  Engage in this activity
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:34.160]  This is unbelievable
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:35.120]  I would never do this
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:37.760]  But if I was there with guys with AK-47s
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:38.960]  Saying you can't come on a park
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:40.400]  The police would stop me and they should
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:44.080]  Right, that's how it should be, right?
[1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:48.080]  I mean, and I don't understand why in these cities
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:49.920]  I mean, especially up in Portland
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.280]  And I've seen it in Berkeley
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:52.800]  Where the cops stand down
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:55.360]  And in some cases, it even seems as though
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:39:58.240]  They're on the side of the Antifa side
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:00.320]  Black block, you know, if they have
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:02.160]  Did you see the documents we got this year
[1:40:02.160 --> 1:40:02.800]  From the brother
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:04.000]  When his other brother got in trouble
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:04.720]  He got the documents
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:06.000]  And it was all confirmed
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.480]  40-something pages of George Soros' son
[1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:11.520]  Running in Blue Cities with the police
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:13.280]  They go attack, they try to cause a riot
[1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:14.720]  The police know where they're going to hit
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:16.400]  They're even allowed to like throw bottles at them
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:17.360]  And stuff, it's all staged
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:19.840]  It's unbelievable
[1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:21.520]  It's unbelievable
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:22.960]  This is happening in America
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:25.120]  In America, of all places, it's unbelievable
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:28.160]  And, you know, these are things that, I mean
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:29.280]  You brought up my father
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:32.080]  I mean, these are things that my father talked about
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:33.600]  Would happen
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:35.440]  That, I mean, this is the ultimate
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:38.160]  I mean, these are the foot soldiers that are out there
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:39.680]  Shutting us down, and it's just
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:42.080]  I don't know, it's for me
[1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:43.840]  Let's be clear, your father was there
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:45.520]  At the weathermen at the ground floor
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:46.640]  And exposed him
[1:40:46.640 --> 1:40:48.160]  Now the weathermen are on top
[1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:50.400]  The Antifa leaders are professors
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:51.920]  And so this is the exact same movement
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:54.320]  Bill Ayers, actually
[1:40:54.320 --> 1:40:55.200]  It is confirmed
[1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:56.080]  He was in April
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:58.400]  He was in Berkeley on April 15th
[1:40:58.400 --> 1:41:00.400]  When that big huge riot happened
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:01.760]  He was not on the street
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:03.040]  Because he's a coward
[1:41:03.040 --> 1:41:05.520]  But he was in, you know, the background
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:08.320]  Helping everybody with signs and all that stuff
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:10.560]  So, yes, these people are very much
[1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:13.360]  I mean, they're running the show
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:14.720]  They're running the show
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:17.200]  And this is what they wanted to do from the beginning
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:18.720]  Is cause this kind of stuff
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:22.720]  Chaos, you know, to eventually take over
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:24.480]  I mean, the government
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:27.200]  I mean, they want to basically take over
[1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:28.400]  The United States government
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:30.000]  That is their ultimate goal
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:34.320]  And right now, it's how
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:36.080]  I mean, what's happening in the cities
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:37.200]  Is just unbelievable to me
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:40.240]  Like I said, it's almost like Twilight Zone stuff
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:41.840]  Because this is stuff when I'm out there
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:43.920]  I'm like, sometimes it's hard for me to believe
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:45.360]  That I'm even in it
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:46.960]  But what's it like to know that your dad
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:48.960]  Was the first person to ever expose the entire plan?
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:52.080]  That's even more crazy to me
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:54.640]  Like, it's really sometimes I just
[1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:56.960]  It's like a dream sometimes
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:58.800]  Well, how proud do you think your dad
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:00.000]  Is of you and heaven right now?
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.040]  I hope, well, I would hope that he's very proud
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:05.200]  I'm sure that he would be upset
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:06.720]  He wouldn't want me in harm's way
[1:42:06.720 --> 1:42:08.000]  That that would be the biggest thing
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.440]  He wouldn't want me out there in harm's way
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:11.200]  But I don't see any other choice
[1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:12.880]  I mean, I feel like
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:16.000]  They are trying to shut us down at every single level
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.200]  And I'll be happy
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:19.200]  We're gonna come back and talk about how we counter strike
[1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:22.720]  But take your dad, notice he said, this is Intel
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:23.840]  They documented and recorded
[1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:25.920]  It was a critical understanding of a larger Chinese plan
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:27.680]  They were funding the Weather Room, we now know
[1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:30.560]  As they said, to foment the collapse of the border
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:31.840]  In the Southwest
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:33.440]  Then there'd be an emergency for the government
[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:34.400]  To build centers
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:36.080]  But it wouldn't move for the illegals, it'd be for us
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:38.080]  The President of the United States
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:42.080]  The U.S. President is going to Trump
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:46.720]  Sorry, globalist, you're in checkmate
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:48.240]  Launch the final attacks

[1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:45.120]  So thank you all for remembering
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:46.720]  InfoWarsstore.com
[1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:48.800]  And remembering that it's not just you
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:49.600]  That's already awake
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:51.280]  But it's other people that aren't awake
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:53.040]  That it's so essential to spread the word
[1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:54.720]  Again, thank you so much for being part
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:47:12.880]  Of the Second American Revolution
[1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:26.960]  No sleep till victory
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:30.640]  We now take you live to the West Coast
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:33.280]  As desperate patriots battle for the First Amendment
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:36.160]  Facing Communist, Antifa, and Chaikom
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:36.880]  But if police
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:41.760]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:44.000]  And the heart of the Resistance
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.320]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[1:47:48.800 --> 1:47:50.640]  The more heat we take, the more attacks
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:52.000]  The more I know I'm over the target
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:56.320]  So God bless the fact that we are over the enemy
[1:47:56.320 --> 1:47:59.120]  And thank God we're dropping bombs on them to truth
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:00.880]  But we do need your support out there, listeners
[1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:05.760]  Now I was just asking our guest here, Ms. Grathwald
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:06.480]  How we support her
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:07.600]  And she goes, well, there's no real way
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:08.400]  I haven't really thought of that
[1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:09.920]  I just worked during the day and I go out and
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:11.680]  You know, all over the West Coast
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:13.200]  And drive for sometimes half a day
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:14.880]  To stand up at prayer vigils
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:16.560]  And watch women and children be hit up at the head
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:18.880]  With bike locks and be punched in the face
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:20.880]  But Lindsay Grathwald on Facebook
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:22.160]  Everybody should follow her there
[1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:24.320]  Facebook's calling for us all to be banned
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:25.360]  Because we're fake news
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:27.520]  We don't, you know, we go out and show Antifa
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:29.200]  Punching women in the face, that's fake news
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:31.360]  Because Antifa are sweet little methods
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:34.560]  So Mike Cernivus joins us at the bottom of the next hour
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:36.320]  To get into the move to ban Antifa
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:37.920]  When they wear masks and commit crimes
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:40.160]  That's all coming up just briefly
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:48.800]  This was developed and is even authorized
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:53.120]  And FDA cleared is the term they like to use
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:55.120]  But it's been through the FDA process
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:48:56.320]  For over-the-counter sale
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:48:59.280]  It's just a little bit less strong
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:02.080]  Than the prescription silver
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:04.240]  That is used in hospitals
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:09.280]  And this silver, which I can't even do justice to
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:15.920]  Is $40 in stores or online or $40 to hospitals
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:16.960]  We private label it
[1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:18.800]  We can sell it for $40 if we want
[1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:22.800]  Because there's a lot of money that went into getting FDA clearance
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:25.360]  This is private label from the big company that has FDA clearance
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:30.240]  And it's got a big giant breakdown
[1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:33.440]  That is so complex with the lawyers and all the rest of it
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:35.280]  That I don't even feel like I could even go over
[1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:36.560]  Let me just say this
[1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:38.080]  It's nano-tech silver
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:39.520]  It is not for internal use
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:42.080]  Because silver is toxic when it's done this nano-level
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:42.720]  But let me tell you
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  For athletes, for people that have cuts
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.880]  Things on their skin, it is the next level
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:53.520]  It is super silver wound dressing gel trademarked
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:57.520]  For first aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:00.000]  First and second to reburn skin irritations
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.560]  It is sold mainly to hospitals
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:05.200]  Some medical grade stores have it
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:06.880]  It's sold on average for $40
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:10.320]  Because believe me, it's expensive for each tube for us
[1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:12.080]  It's a big tube, four ounce
[1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:17.040]  And I actually, I'm on the phone with lawyers and scientists today
[1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:18.640]  Because I want to get this exactly right
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:21.200]  When we say what we can say
[1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:24.640]  I've got an approved breakdown on super silver wound dressing gel
[1:50:26.160 --> 1:50:28.640]  And it's just incredible
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:32.480]  It is the number 2,400
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:36.160]  The stuff that's prescription is 3,200
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:38.800]  And it's nano-tech
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:40.080]  It's from the only company that has it
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:40.960]  It's a big company
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:42.720]  They don't mind if I say their name
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:44.000]  But I'm about to lower the price of it
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:44.880]  So I'm not going to do it
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:47.520]  In the contract we have, there isn't a map pricing
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:50.720]  It's 29.95 out of the gates
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:52.400]  20.95
[1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:54.160]  Super silver
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:55.520]  This is not colloidal silver
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:56.480]  This is not any of that
[1:50:56.480 --> 1:50:58.960]  This is nano-tech small silver
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:01.120]  And I'm going to tell you again
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:02.880]  It is not for internal use
[1:51:04.320 --> 1:51:06.320]  But when all else fails, as you know
[1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:08.400]  A lot of stuff isn't working now on infections
[1:51:08.400 --> 1:51:10.080]  It's another weapon in the arsenal
[1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:11.360]  And I can tell you right now
[1:51:11.360 --> 1:51:13.200]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:15.760]  He still has his license
[1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:17.520]  But he doesn't really practice dentistry anymore
[1:51:18.880 --> 1:51:20.720]  And we were searching out the very best
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:22.800]  Most powerful silvers used by hospitals
[1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:26.960]  And he ended up getting ahold of one of the top companies
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:28.720]  In the world and turned out they're listeners
[1:51:29.680 --> 1:51:32.000]  And so a major scientist owns it
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:33.040]  I'm going to leave it at that
[1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:34.720]  We may even have him in studio and do the whole thing
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:37.920]  But it's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics
[1:51:37.920 --> 1:51:40.160]  And it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves
[1:51:41.040 --> 1:51:42.160]  They use another solution
[1:51:42.160 --> 1:51:45.440]  They've developed a nano-tech to flush the lines at dental offices
[1:51:45.440 --> 1:51:47.280]  Let me just say this is next level
[1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:48.800]  Bacterian viruses don't like this
[1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:51.360]  And I've got a whole big list here in my stack of what is
[1:51:52.080 --> 1:51:52.640]  FDA
[1:51:54.720 --> 1:51:55.200]  What's the term?
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:56.000]  I'm supposed to say approved
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.520]  Because they never approved something
[1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:00.000]  FDA cleared of what it knocks out
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:00.960]  And it's incredible
[1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:04.320]  But for a week I've been trying to get exactly what I can say about it
[1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:06.400]  But it is the nuclear option
[1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:07.760]  Okay, I'm going to say again
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:09.920]  Do not take this internally
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:13.200]  Because it kills bacteria and viruses
[1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:14.080]  Deter than a hammer
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:15.600]  Like boom
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:18.960]  So if it ain't good for them
[1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:19.840]  It ain't good for you
[1:52:20.960 --> 1:52:22.400]  But if it's going to eat your leg off
[1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:23.360]  It's a nuclear option
[1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:26.320]  So this is without a prescription
[1:52:27.040 --> 1:52:30.240]  The strongest FDA cleared is the term
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:32.640]  FDA cleared silver you can get
[1:52:34.720 --> 1:52:37.040]  Like we're coming out with a energy thing
[1:52:37.040 --> 1:52:38.640]  That is like the strongest thing out there
[1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:39.680]  It's going to have warnings on the label
[1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:39.920]  Okay
[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:42.160]  But you want it, you got it
[1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:43.600]  This is without a prescription
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:47.040]  Just a slightly watered down version
[1:52:47.040 --> 1:52:48.560]  Of the top selling prescription
[1:52:49.120 --> 1:52:50.960]  Mega silver
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:54.080]  That is the savior now at the hospital's clinic
[1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:54.560]  You name it
[1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:56.400]  Super silver
[1:52:57.520 --> 1:52:58.480]  Private labeled
[1:52:58.480 --> 1:52:59.360]  Ten dollars off
[1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:00.080]  What it's sold for
[1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:02.080]  In four store dot com
[1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:03.360]  In fourslife dot com
[1:53:03.360 --> 1:53:04.240]  Or triple A
[1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:06.080]  Two five three three one three nine
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:08.080]  And let's just say this
[1:53:08.080 --> 1:53:09.120]  It's amazing
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:10.160]  All right I'm going to stop right there
[1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:12.000]  That's how you fund your operation
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:13.280]  We have a limited run of these
[1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:16.320]  And let's just say it's very expensive for us to get
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:18.560]  Because they went through the FDA approval
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:19.920]  It's been approved for four years
[1:53:19.920 --> 1:53:22.880]  We're now in the FDA cleared list of companies
[1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:25.520]  That can only one other company that sells this
[1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:27.520]  We are the only private labeler of it
[1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:30.160]  And that's because M4 says a lot of friends
[1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:30.960]  A lot of enemies too
[1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:32.480]  This is it
[1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:33.840]  I tasked my father
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:35.200]  Who's gotten stuff approved before
[1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:36.880]  Got an FDA approval before with other stuff
[1:53:36.880 --> 1:53:39.600]  I tasked him I said find me the ultimate silver
[1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:42.320]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using
[1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:44.240]  In the military hospitals you name it
[1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:44.800]  This is it
[1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:48.240]  There's only one other silver stronger in spy prescription
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:49.840]  This is it right here
[1:53:49.840 --> 1:53:51.600]  This stuff is thermonuclear
[1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:53.280]  Nanotech
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:57.360]  Super small particles which go in electromagnetically
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:53:58.480]  Well you know what silver does
[1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:00.160]  It just goes right to the heart of something and just
[1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:01.520]  It's gone
[1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:03.440]  All right this segment the next
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:05.520]  I apologize our guest I'm Lanting
[1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:06.240]  Lindsay Grathwald
[1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:08.080]  You've got the floor to talk about any other great points
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:08.880]  You want to make
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:10.640]  Being attacked out there by Antifa
[1:54:10.640 --> 1:54:11.680]  Where this is going
[1:54:11.680 --> 1:54:13.120]  What you expect to happen next
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:13.520]  Go ahead
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:16.800]  Well I want to talk about we
[1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:18.640]  So I'm sure everyone's aware
[1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:21.280]  There's going to be a march up in Portland on August 4th
[1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:24.080]  With Patriot prayer Joey Gibson
[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:26.480]  And I'm hoping to make it up there myself
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:28.160]  But on August 5th
[1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:31.280]  We are working together with Joey Gibson and Patriot prayer
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:33.840]  Myself and Amber Cummings
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:36.720]  Who is the transsexual woman
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:38.160]  That was out there with us on Saturday
[1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:40.640]  We are having a Nota Marxism event
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:42.640]  That we've been planning now for a couple months
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:44.960]  In Berkeley, California
[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:47.120]  So literally we're going to be having
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:49.360]  You know we're going to go up to Portland
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:50.720]  We're going to do our thing up there
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:53.520]  And then Joey and a bunch of Patriots from up there
[1:54:53.520 --> 1:54:55.840]  We're going to literally caravan back to Berkeley
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:54:56.960]  For the next day
[1:54:56.960 --> 1:54:58.560]  And we're going to go stand in Berkeley
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:01.680]  Part of it is going to be in honor of my father
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:03.280]  We were supposed to have an event
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:04.960]  You know that was going to be totally for my dad
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:05.840]  On August 4th
[1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:08.800]  But we decided that because Joey's having his event
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:11.360]  That we're going to do the one in Portland
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:12.880]  And then we're going to do one in Berkeley
[1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:15.280]  So together Amber and I are working on that
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:16.560]  We have some speakers
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:18.480]  Joey Gibson is going to be coming to speak
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:24.160]  Her Skype just froze up for a moment ladies and gentlemen
[1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:25.760]  Again we're going to give you her Facebook
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:27.440]  And more of this lady needs you to come out
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:28.720]  And support her
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:31.440]  I've been really asked by a lot of Patriots
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:33.280]  In the government not to go to events
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:34.160]  Because there is
[1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:36.160]  Without getting into many details
[1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:40.240]  Well you know they're known as contracts out
[1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:42.320]  But at the same time you just can't sit here
[1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:43.840]  And watch these people do this alone
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:46.000]  We need numbers out there just like Portland
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:47.120]  How do people join you again?
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:49.680]  Join it
[1:55:49.680 --> 1:55:52.080]  Hey you can just come on to my Facebook page
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:53.120]  And you can follow me
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:56.560]  And I put all the information to all the events
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:55:58.960]  That we're doing on my Facebook page
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:00.960]  And we've been talking about this for a while
[1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:04.720]  We tried to do a Patriot weekend last year
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:06.560]  In August in the Bay Area
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:08.080]  And I don't know if you remember Alex
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:08.960]  But it got
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:10.160]  I mean it got crazy
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:12.880]  We actually had to cancel our event in San Francisco
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:17.280]  Because Nancy Pelosi and all the politicians in San Francisco
[1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:18.800]  Yeah and I mean literally
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:20.480]  I mean they put us in a danger
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:21.520]  They set us up
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:22.480]  They put us in a situation
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:24.800]  But that's when Antifa folded nationwide
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:26.800]  And they admitted Trump was right about it being bad
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:28.000]  And when Pelosi had to then say
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:29.520]  And the mayor and police chief say
[1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:30.560]  Antifa is evil
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:32.000]  So your courage turned
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:33.040]  I'm not just saying it
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:34.800]  Your courage turned the tide
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:37.040]  Yep and we were
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:38.480]  I mean it was an ugly weekend
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:40.880]  Because we had the San Francisco thing
[1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:42.400]  And in Berkeley we had the next day
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:43.600]  Which I went to Berkeley
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:45.200]  And there's videos that I mean
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:47.120]  That was just a mess in Berkeley
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:49.280]  There were thousands of Antifa in Berkeley
[1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:51.360]  That day that were beaten up reporters
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:52.720]  They were beaten up you know
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:54.320]  I mean they were beaten up anybody that they thought
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:55.440]  And that's why it backfired
[1:56:55.440 --> 1:56:56.080]  For those that don't remember
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:56:57.680]  Let's come back and talk about that
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:56:58.720]  They went mad dogs
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:00.560]  They had such a big crowd for the first time
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:02.080]  They were attacking black people
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:03.040]  White people
[1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:03.760]  Liberals
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:04.400]  Reporters
[1:57:04.400 --> 1:57:05.120]  Police
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:07.200]  It was like just like crazy mad dogs
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:08.800]  Yeah they did
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:12.400]  And then our politicians here had to come out
[1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:13.840]  And call them what they were
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:17.440]  And they've been here in the San Francisco Bay Area
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:19.360]  They've been what I've been saying
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:21.760]  They've been in hibernation for a little while
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:23.680]  But we did an event not long ago
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:25.680]  We went into Oakland of all places
[1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:28.480]  And there was a coffee shop there called Austin Huerta
[1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:30.880]  And they refused to serve police officers
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:32.480]  So we went down there to protest them
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:33.680]  I was with Will Johnson
[1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:34.640]  I tell you what stay there
[1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:36.720]  Back in two minutes we'll finish up with you
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:38.800]  Mike Cernovich coming up in FullWars.com
[1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:49.440]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:51.600]  And put it together with our own four years
[1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:54.880]  Of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:56.320]  That God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:57:57.600]  To detoxify the body
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:57:59.680]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield
[1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:02.560]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support
[1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:04.000]  It's made in the USA
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.800]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[1:58:06.800 --> 1:58:09.520]  That are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[1:58:09.520 --> 1:58:10.880]  And it supports the info war
[1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:12.960]  It is a classical 360 win
[1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:15.760]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking
[1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:16.640]  For over a year
[1:58:16.640 --> 1:58:19.760]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:22.640]  When it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get
[1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:23.520]  You owe it to yourself
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:24.560]  You owe it to your family
[1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:27.520]  And you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:30.240]  That patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:32.240]  And as focused as you can be
[1:58:32.240 --> 1:58:33.600]  Because we need you
[1:58:33.600 --> 1:58:35.120]  The remnant of America
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:37.440]  To reignite those brush fires the next level
[1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:39.440]  And to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[1:58:39.440 --> 1:58:41.680]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together
[1:58:41.680 --> 1:58:42.720]  We're changing the world
[1:58:42.720 --> 1:58:44.320]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:45.040]  With Z Shield
[1:58:45.040 --> 1:58:46.480]  And in FullWarsLive.com
[1:58:46.480 --> 1:58:50.320]  This 4th of July is special
[1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:51.200]  Everybody can see it
[1:58:51.200 --> 1:58:52.240]  They can feel it
[1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:55.840]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening
[1:58:55.840 --> 1:58:56.640]  To their tyranny
[1:58:56.640 --> 1:58:59.840]  And America yet again is at the heart of the resistance
[1:58:59.840 --> 1:59:00.400]  The globalist
[1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:02.160]  That's why this 4th of July
[1:59:02.160 --> 1:59:04.240]  I'm asking all of our great supporters
[1:59:04.240 --> 1:59:06.160]  To think about info wars now more than ever
[1:59:06.160 --> 1:59:08.320]  And what would the world be like if info wars
[1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:10.000]  Wasn't there resisting the globalist
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:12.960]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported info wars
[1:59:12.960 --> 1:59:14.960]  We would not be having the victories we have today
[1:59:14.960 --> 1:59:16.800]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening
[1:59:16.800 --> 1:59:18.160]  But the enemy is striking back
[1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:20.480]  So please think about info wars
[1:59:20.480 --> 1:59:21.600]  And funding our operation
[1:59:21.600 --> 1:59:23.360]  While you get great products at the same time

[1:59:46.480 --> 1:59:47.680]  InvoorStore.com
[1:59:47.680 --> 2:00:15.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:15.520 --> 2:00:18.720]  Lindsay Grasswall is on Facebook for now
[2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:19.920]  They're trying to censor everybody
[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:23.120]  She's only got 2,072 followers
[2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:24.480]  She's an amazing patriot
[2:00:24.480 --> 2:00:25.920]  Her father was a great American
[2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:26.880]  Lives on with the Stam
[2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:29.680]  And she's out there in California
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:31.680]  In Oregon
[2:00:32.720 --> 2:00:35.280]  In Washington state
[2:00:35.280 --> 2:00:36.480]  Driving on her own dime
[2:00:37.040 --> 2:00:37.920]  And going out there
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:39.760]  And sometimes just seven, eight, nine of them
[2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:42.480]  Being attacked by 1520 Antifa
[2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:44.960]  It's incredible
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:47.040]  So I want men and women to come out
[2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:48.320]  In support of what she's doing
[2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:51.280]  So again, we thought we found a GoFundMe
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:52.320]  Online, I don't know if that's yours
[2:00:52.320 --> 2:00:53.600]  And we did a GoFundMe for one of the guys
[2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:56.080]  That got charged a while back
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:00:57.920]  During that whole riot in San Francisco
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:00:59.440]  Even the Washington Post admits
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:00.240]  Antifa started
[2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:02.720]  There's a Larry Graffold story
[2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:04.640]  You want to raise $8,000?
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:05.280]  Is that you?
[2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:06.800]  We're just searching how to support you
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:07.360]  At GoFundMe
[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:07.760]  Is that you?
[2:01:08.480 --> 2:01:09.040]  It is me
[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:10.560]  I actually created that a while back
[2:01:10.560 --> 2:01:11.280]  Yeah, that is me
[2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:12.560]  Well, that's a shame
[2:01:12.560 --> 2:01:13.200]  That's a shame
[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:15.520]  People need to make your $8,000 goal right now
[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:16.320]  I'm going to make
[2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:17.600]  Even though I'm not made out of money
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:20.000]  But I gave $10,000 a few days ago
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:21.600]  To the just walk away guy
[2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:22.960]  Believe me, we're in a major attack
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:25.200]  But it's the seed money of people taking action
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:29.040]  I'm going to make a $5,000 donation today
[2:01:29.040 --> 2:01:30.000]  Folks, make sure it happens
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:31.440]  Go tell the accounting
[2:01:31.440 --> 2:01:32.800]  $5,000 donation right now
[2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:35.280]  But I want to see it go to $8,000 today
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:37.440]  I want to see Listers come in for the other $3,000
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:39.760]  Wow, thank you so much
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:40.880]  That's really awesome
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:41.520]  Thank you
[2:01:41.520 --> 2:01:42.320]  Are you kidding?
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:44.640]  I mean, I've got my intel sources and stuff saying
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:45.920]  Don't go out to these events
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:46.720]  Because I'm a target
[2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:49.600]  I mean, you're out there fighting the scum of the earth
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:51.360]  So the least I can do is support
[2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:53.920]  To give a woman gas money and funding
[2:01:53.920 --> 2:01:55.360]  And things to get organized
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:57.280]  To go out and challenge scum
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:01:59.280]  My God, if men won't do the job
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:00.240]  We're going to send the women
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:01.680]  I might as well give you the money to do it
[2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:03.680]  Well, I appreciate that
[2:02:03.680 --> 2:02:04.320]  I really do
[2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:05.120]  Because we do
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:06.160]  I mean, I've been this year
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:06.640]  I've been
[2:02:06.640 --> 2:02:09.040]  Thank me, a man giving a woman money to go
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:10.400]  Fight global of scum
[2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:11.840]  I mean, it's actually kind of shameful
[2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:13.440]  That we don't have more men out there
[2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:14.240]  It was a man doing it
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:15.200]  I'd give him the money about it
[2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:16.080]  Okay, well, okay
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:17.040]  Just from my conscience
[2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:17.760]  I'm doing it
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:19.120]  You understand that, right?
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:19.920]  I do
[2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:21.280]  And I appreciate it
[2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:21.840]  I mean, we
[2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:22.560]  I travel
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:23.920]  This year I've been to Oregon
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:25.600]  I think three different times
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:26.800]  I've been to Arizona
[2:02:26.800 --> 2:02:28.160]  I got to speak in Arizona
[2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:29.360]  I flew to New York
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:30.640]  To be in a documentary
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:32.240]  About Antifa
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:33.120]  Why don't you take an action
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.040]  So tell folks what donations can do for you
[2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:37.200]  Oh, it'll help me get
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:38.880]  From one event to another
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:40.480]  I mean, that's that's all I do
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:42.320]  Is, you know, on my free time
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:44.240]  I work 40 hours a week
[2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:45.600]  So I work a regular job
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:46.480]  I have two kids
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:47.600]  You know, I have a family
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:50.080]  So it's like this is like what I do in my
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:51.520]  And by the way, I'm gonna hold you over
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:52.240]  Because I'm interrupting
[2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:53.920]  But biologically as a father
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:55.920]  It's really hard for me now
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:56.960]  To put myself in danger
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:02:57.920]  It's not even fear
[2:02:57.920 --> 2:02:59.440]  It's fear of not being a parent for my kids
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:00.960]  I have less fear as a parent
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:02.400]  But now I have concern about them
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:04.000]  So you're a mother on top of it
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.800]  Facing violent, trashy scum
[2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:08.240]  That attack women with bike locks
[2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:09.200]  That's amazing
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:11.120]  So again, how do people go to the GoFundMe and donate?
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:13.280]  It's on the GoFundMe
[2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:15.280]  It's under my name, Lindsay Grathwall
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:16.880]  You can donate there
[2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:19.440]  I'd appreciate all the help I can get
[2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:21.040]  And Alex, you know what?
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:22.880]  About that, you know, I feel like
[2:03:22.880 --> 2:03:24.480]  I guess I'm a lot like my father
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:26.640]  Like I feel like I cannot sit back
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:27.680]  And watch all this happen
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:28.640]  And not do anything
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:30.640]  I do worry about my children
[2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:32.480]  I worry that something might happen to me
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:35.040]  But my dad put himself in the same situation
[2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:36.880]  You know, and and and
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:38.720]  And I worry about more
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:41.520]  What's going to happen to my kids in a in a country
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:44.880]  That is, you know, taken over by Marxist communists
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:47.520]  When I'm not here anymore to help them
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:48.960]  That is the key
[2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:50.720]  Every time I feel guilty
[2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:51.920]  About what I'm doing
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:53.200]  We're going to lose it all anyways
[2:03:53.200 --> 2:03:54.560]  If we don't go all in
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:55.200]  Exactly
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:03:56.480]  Yep
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:03:57.360]  And that's where I'm at
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:03:58.720]  And that's why I'm doing what I do
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:00.160]  And my family, you know
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:01.920]  My mom sometimes cries
[2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:02.720]  Because she knows
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:04.720]  She knows what my dad went through
[2:04:04.720 --> 2:04:05.920]  She knows what I go through
[2:04:05.920 --> 2:04:07.520]  And she doesn't want that, you know
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:09.200]  Anything bad to happen to me
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:10.720]  But I feel driven
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:12.080]  Like this is this is
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:13.440]  I mean, this is so important
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:14.880]  And I'm doing it for my kid
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:15.680]  The answer
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:16.400]  Your mom's great
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:17.840]  Is she needs to get involved
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:19.120]  Everybody sees people like you
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:20.160]  Targeted and bullied
[2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:21.280]  We have to all get involved
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:22.000]  That's the answer
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:23.840]  We have to
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:25.280]  And we have to stand up
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:26.960]  And we have to tell them no
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:28.800]  I mean, we're not going to allow this to happen
[2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:30.880]  We're not going to allow them to take over
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:32.560]  And we are not going to stand by
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:34.080]  And let them go out
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:35.920]  And shut down our
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:36.720]  Freedomist speech
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:37.120]  You're right
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:37.600]  Stay there
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:39.280]  Let's come back with a few more comments from you
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:40.400]  Ahead of Mike Sarnovich
[2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:40.960]  Stay with us
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:47.280]  Vaporizing globalist
[2:04:49.040 --> 2:04:49.840]  Bringing victory
[2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:51.440]  We are receiving this transmission
[2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:54.000]  You are the resistance
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:57.280]  Living in volcano
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:04:59.920]  May sound more dramatic than it really is
[2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:03.200]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania States
[2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:06.000]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:09.520]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[2:05:09.520 --> 2:05:12.400]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:16.800]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels
[2:05:16.800 --> 2:05:19.760]  To find out, we employed a series of tests
[2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:23.280]  For heavy metals, alkalinity and pH
[2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:25.200]  What we learned was that there was in fact
[2:05:25.200 --> 2:05:28.400]  Unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:32.880]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:36.400]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:40.080]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:44.880]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[2:05:45.440 --> 2:05:48.560]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[2:05:48.560 --> 2:05:50.480]  Can contaminate a rainwater supply
[2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:55.120]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it
[2:05:57.040 --> 2:06:01.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[2:06:01.920 --> 2:06:05.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:44.080]  All right, I've got a raft of clips from the incredible testimony
[2:06:44.080 --> 2:06:47.280]  Of Strock and Orr and others today in Congress
[2:06:47.840 --> 2:06:50.800]  And I've been ranting here because this stuff gets me so wound up
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:53.120]  Lindsay Grathwald, daughter of Larry Grathwald, is our guest
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:54.240]  She goes out in faces
[2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:58.000]  And usually 10, 15, 20 of them get attacked by a whole bunch of them
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:06:59.520]  Then later, patriots come out
[2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:01.680]  But it just shows, even here in Austin
[2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:03.920]  We try to go cover a pro-gun rally now
[2:07:03.920 --> 2:07:06.960]  And we'll be met on the street by guys with guns saying you can't come in
[2:07:07.920 --> 2:07:09.680]  It's just insane
[2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:13.680]  So other points you want to impart to folks, Lindsay?
[2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:18.160]  The main thing, I mean right now, we just really want to get
[2:07:18.160 --> 2:07:22.160]  Anyone that can come out and support us up in Berkeley, California on August 5th
[2:07:22.960 --> 2:07:24.960]  We definitely want to get people out there
[2:07:24.960 --> 2:07:27.360]  Like you said earlier, it's numbers
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:30.160]  We need people out there to support us
[2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:31.920]  Because they come out in droves
[2:07:31.920 --> 2:07:34.640]  And we've seen it multiple times
[2:07:35.600 --> 2:07:37.760]  Portland's probably the most recent one
[2:07:37.760 --> 2:07:39.760]  That was a complete riot
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:42.800]  And we'll be going back up to Portland again too
[2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:47.040]  I mean, I was hoping to hopefully make it up there and I'm planning on it
[2:07:48.160 --> 2:07:51.120]  And then after that, we're just going to keep on pushing
[2:07:51.120 --> 2:07:52.640]  We keep on doing events
[2:07:52.640 --> 2:07:54.080]  We're not going to let them silence us
[2:07:54.080 --> 2:07:56.480]  In fact, the more that they push back at us
[2:07:56.480 --> 2:07:57.760]  The more that we're going to come out
[2:07:57.760 --> 2:07:59.920]  And we're going to keep on having our events
[2:07:59.920 --> 2:08:02.240]  Because we feel like we have to
[2:08:03.200 --> 2:08:05.360]  The minute we stand down and get silent
[2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:07.600]  Is the minute that they win
[2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:08.960]  And we can't let that happen
[2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:10.480]  Because there's way too much at stake
[2:08:11.840 --> 2:08:14.080]  And like I said earlier, it's about my kids
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:15.680]  It's about the future for my kids
[2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:20.160]  I mean, my son has gotten issues
[2:08:20.720 --> 2:08:22.800]  Simply because he's conservative
[2:08:22.800 --> 2:08:24.240]  Like me, he's 11 years old
[2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:27.520]  And that's only going to get worse
[2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:29.840]  If we allow this kind of stuff to happen
[2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:33.360]  Um, so, I mean, August 4th up in Portland
[2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:34.560]  August 5th in Berkeley
[2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:37.280]  Those are two big events that we're going to be having
[2:08:37.280 --> 2:08:38.960]  And I hope that people come out
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:40.640]  I know not everybody can
[2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:42.240]  And I know not everybody wants to
[2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:43.200]  Because they're afraid
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:46.080]  You know, but I want people to understand
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:47.120]  You know, it is scary
[2:08:47.120 --> 2:08:48.320]  I'm, it is scary
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:49.360]  I get scared too
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:52.800]  But we have to stand up for what we believe in
[2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:54.160]  I mean, we have to
[2:08:54.160 --> 2:08:55.280]  Otherwise, we're going to lose it
[2:08:55.280 --> 2:08:57.600]  And to me, that's becoming a reality
[2:08:57.600 --> 2:09:01.040]  Like, I'm seeing all of our, all of our
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:03.920]  The rights that we have
[2:09:03.920 --> 2:09:06.400]  You know, everything is slowly being taken away from us
[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:08.320]  And especially living here in California
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:09.760]  I mean, I'm in California
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:14.320]  And they are, I mean, I live in a, I call it comifornia
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:15.600]  It's a communist state
[2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:19.200]  And that is, it's slowly happening
[2:09:19.200 --> 2:09:21.120]  Around the rest of the country
[2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:23.120]  And eventually, it's going to hit you
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:24.640]  And I tell people all the time
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:27.200]  Don't wait until it comes to your doorstep
[2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:28.320]  You got to get out there
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:29.760]  And you got to fight somehow
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:31.040]  If you don't want to get in the street
[2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:34.160]  Then get involved somehow, some way
[2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:37.440]  You know, to do something that, that, you know
[2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:40.080]  Maybe get, you know, politically get involved
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:42.160]  I don't know how people want to get that
[2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:43.920]  The bottom line is the fight for this country
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:46.400]  With foreign corporations and the Chinese communists
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:47.600]  Admittedly owning Hollywood
[2:09:47.600 --> 2:09:50.080]  This country is fighting for its life right now
[2:09:50.080 --> 2:09:52.080]  And we really appreciate what you're doing
[2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:52.960]  Want to support you
[2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:55.120]  Want to support you, I'm going to make that donation
[2:09:55.120 --> 2:09:56.240]  To your GoFundMe
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:09:57.280]  Everybody should do it right now
[2:09:57.280 --> 2:09:58.960]  They just got to GoFundMe and type in
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:00.800]  The Larry Grafwald story
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:06.240]  Grafwald is G-R-A-T-H-W-O-H-L story
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:07.440]  And we really appreciate you
[2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:09.360]  And God bless you, we appreciate your courage
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:10.160]  Thank you, Alex
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:11.680]  I appreciate you having me on
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:12.160]  Thank you
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:14.400]  And, and listeners, I know I go to you each day
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:16.800]  And say, support our local radio station
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:18.960]  Support info or support this guest
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:20.480]  It's whatever you feel called to support
[2:10:20.480 --> 2:10:21.120]  Just know this
[2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:23.120]  We understand the cost
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:24.880]  We've put ourselves in the line
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:26.880]  Because what's coming is far worse
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:28.000]  Than what we're currently in
[2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:30.720]  So that's what it comes down to
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:33.040]  And I just want to thank you all
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:35.040]  And I appreciate you all for your support
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:37.440]  Now, we've got a bunch of these clips
[2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:39.520]  My God, we, we, I'm going to look at these clips
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:41.120]  We've got hours of clips
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:42.560]  From the congressional hearing today
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:46.480]  With Strach and, uh, Orr being grilled
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:48.960]  And GOP lawmaker, threat and epi-agent
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:51.760]  Peter Strach with contempt for refusing to answer questions
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:54.960]  U.S. Marshals serve subpoena on FBI lawyer Lisa Page
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:10:58.560]  Uh, says that, uh, the threat and the hold are in contempt
[2:10:58.560 --> 2:10:59.680]  I mean, it's, it's all crazy
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:01.760]  But I've got like 20 minutes of Gowdy
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:03.600]  But here's the last few minutes of him
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:06.240]  Grilling these guys
[2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:09.200]  And then we've got Mike Cernovich coming up
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:11.200]  And let's, let's go to some of this now, here it is
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:13.920]  100 million to zero, Agent Strach
[2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:15.520]  That's how bad she should win
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:18.160]  Mr. Gowdy, those personal expressions
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:20.720]  Of my observing the political process
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:22.160]  Of the presidential primaries
[2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:23.440]  Let's start at the beginning
[2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:24.880]  See, I gotta walk out of the room or I'm gonna interrupt
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:29.680]  We have a five-minute, nine-second clip of Strach
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:35.040]  Saying he's never used his bias in a case
[2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:37.680]  When he's saying, I hate Trump, we will stop him
[2:11:37.680 --> 2:11:39.680]  Insurance policy, he'll never get in
[2:11:39.680 --> 2:11:41.120]  Hillary's the president
[2:11:41.120 --> 2:11:43.520]  I mean, we have him, this is perjury again
[2:11:43.520 --> 2:11:49.920]  But he's such a little arrogant piece of crap
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:52.240]  Who just lies with contempt and pleasure
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:53.840]  Start over, sorry
[2:11:54.640 --> 2:11:57.200]  100 million to zero, Agent Strach
[2:11:57.200 --> 2:11:59.040]  That's how bad she should win
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:01.520]  Mr. Gowdy, those personal expressions
[2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:03.440]  Of my observing the political process
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:04.720]  Of the presidential primaries
[2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:06.480]  While you pledged to stop Trump
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:09.040]  On my actions of any investigation
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:11.040]  To include the investigation of Secretary Clinton
[2:12:11.040 --> 2:12:13.360]  You couldn't think or anybody else
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:15.360]  You couldn't think of a single person
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:17.520]  That would not vote for Hillary Clinton for president
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:19.920]  100 million to zero, Agent Strach
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:21.680]  So that was clearly hyperbole
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:22.320]  Which I-
[2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:23.760]  Well, let's say it was hyperbole
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:25.040]  Let's divide it by ten
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:26.160]  It's pause again
[2:12:26.160 --> 2:12:28.720]  This guy is a sycophant who called to the president
[2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:30.160]  Who covered up Russiagate
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:31.760]  Who covered up Cerbergate
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:33.760]  He was the little handled butt boy
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:35.760]  Her groom of the stool
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:38.000]  And now he says he wasn't politically motivated
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.880]  What? Look at the face of the traitor
[2:12:40.880 --> 2:12:43.280]  Look at the face of the scum
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:45.040]  They have to get to betray this nation
[2:12:45.040 --> 2:12:47.840]  Thank God we're on to you, continuum
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:49.280]  Well, it's hyperbole
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:50.960]  Let's divide it by ten
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:52.560]  How about we say it was hyperbole
[2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:53.760]  And divide it by ten
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:55.200]  100 million divided by ten
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:56.960]  I'm pretty sure it's 10 million
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:12:58.400]  Zero divided by ten
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:00.960]  It's still zero
[2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:03.280]  You couldn't think of a single solitary person
[2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:05.120]  That was going to vote for her for president
[2:13:05.120 --> 2:13:06.400]  Before you interviewed her
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:09.360]  And while you were supposed to be investigating her
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:11.840]  Congressman, clearly that's not the truth
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:14.800]  Clearly I could envision millions of Americans
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:16.800]  Were likely and did vote for then-
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:17.920]  Well, you wrote it
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:19.040]  My point, sir
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:19.680]  Did you write it?
[2:13:19.680 --> 2:13:20.880]  Sir, I wrote America
[2:13:20.880 --> 2:13:22.160]  I did write that, sir
[2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:22.560]  Okay
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:23.600]  Were you under duress?
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:25.680]  Political expression, engaging in hyperbole
[2:13:25.680 --> 2:13:26.800]  Were you under duress?
[2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:29.440]  Asked and answered over and over again
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:31.360]  While he was running at political operation
[2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:33.360]  The gentleman from South Carolina controls the time
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:36.400]  All right, we're going to go into one other time period
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:38.880]  May 17th, 2017
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:40.080]  Bob Mueller is appointed
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:42.080]  Your friend, Jim Comey, has been fired
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:44.800]  He's already leaked the memos to his law professor friend
[2:13:44.800 --> 2:13:46.240]  And Mueller a special counsel
[2:13:46.240 --> 2:13:47.280]  And then why about it?
[2:13:47.280 --> 2:13:51.680]  Do you remember how long it took for you to start talking about impeachment
[2:13:51.680 --> 2:13:53.680]  After Bob Mueller was appointed?
[2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:54.800]  I don't, sir
[2:13:54.800 --> 2:13:55.680]  One day
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:13:58.080]  One day
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:00.880]  And you are talking about impeachment
[2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:04.240]  And for anyone who may have missed it the day after his appointment
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:05.200]  Agent Struck
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:07.280]  You did it again
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:09.680]  Five days later
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:13.680]  Now, how many interviews had you done as part of the special counsel team
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:15.680]  Within the first five days of his appointment?
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:19.680]  Sir, again, same answers before I can't get into details
[2:14:19.680 --> 2:14:21.680]  Right, and the answer is also the same, it's zero
[2:14:21.680 --> 2:14:23.680]  No interviews had been done
[2:14:23.680 --> 2:14:25.680]  I don't know if that's true or not
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:27.680]  No interviews had been done
[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:31.680]  By August the 8th, when you're talking about stopping him
[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:33.680]  And how terrifying it would be for him to win
[2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:35.680]  And how you can protect the country
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:37.680]  He's not going to
[2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:43.680]  No interviews had been done before you're talking about impeachment of the president
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:49.680]  But no wonder Bob Mueller kicked you off of the investigation, Agent Struck
[2:14:51.680 --> 2:14:53.680]  My question is
[2:14:55.680 --> 2:14:57.680]  If you were kicked off when you read the text
[2:14:57.680 --> 2:14:59.680]  Shouldn't you have been kicked off when you wrote them?
[2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:01.680]  Not at all
[2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:05.680]  Well, it wasn't the discovery of your text, Mr. Struck
[2:15:05.680 --> 2:15:09.680]  The existence of your bias that got you kicked off
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:11.680]  No, Mr. Gowdy, it wasn't
[2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:13.680]  I do not have bias
[2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:15.680]  My personal opinion
[2:15:15.680 --> 2:15:17.680]  Why did you get kicked off?
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:19.680]  Mr. Gowdy, my understanding of why
[2:15:19.680 --> 2:15:21.680]  Because he got caught
[2:15:21.680 --> 2:15:23.680]  Was that based on understanding of those texts
[2:15:23.680 --> 2:15:25.680]  And the perception that they might create
[2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:27.680]  Well, hang on a second, Agent
[2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:29.680]  We will stop the president, he'll never get elected
[2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:31.680]  We're going to get him
[2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:33.680]  We'll go to break right here
[2:15:33.680 --> 2:15:35.680]  We got more coming up than Mike Cernivus joins us
[2:15:35.680 --> 2:15:37.680]  In pollwars.com, newswars.com
[2:15:37.680 --> 2:15:39.680]  The forbidden sites that help you don't visit the new free app
[2:15:39.680 --> 2:16:03.680]  In pollwars.com for its last app
[2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:05.680]  A lot of people say to me, how did you lose the weight?
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:07.680]  I said, I take Andrew 400 every day
[2:16:07.680 --> 2:16:09.680]  I'm going to take it forever
[2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:11.680]  That was Walt talking about Andrew 400
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:13.680]  Now listen to what Bob has to say
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:15.680]  When you listen to your radio commercials
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:17.680]  You say that's not possible
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:19.680]  But since I've experienced it
[2:16:19.680 --> 2:16:21.680]  Your commercials aren't strong enough
[2:16:21.680 --> 2:16:23.680]  I am 76 and I've had a belly for way too long
[2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:25.680]  My whole body is shrinking
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:27.680]  My energy level has gone up
[2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:29.680]  And I don't think difference is Andrew 400
[2:16:29.680 --> 2:16:31.680]  It's great stuff, I tried other products and nothing happened
[2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:33.680]  Guys, if you'd like to lose stubborn belly fat

[2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:35.680]  And shut up from the sound
[2:20:37.680 --> 2:20:39.680]  The death machine ain't slowing down

[2:20:45.680 --> 2:20:47.680]  For you Peter Shrock
[2:20:47.680 --> 2:20:49.680]  Who is the most arrogant
[2:20:51.680 --> 2:20:53.680]  Creature you could imagine
[2:20:53.680 --> 2:20:55.680]  This is the type of trash that
[2:20:55.680 --> 2:20:57.680]  Looks like a demon
[2:20:57.680 --> 2:20:59.680]  And Mueller that looks like
[2:20:59.680 --> 2:21:01.680]  A mummy
[2:21:01.680 --> 2:21:03.680]  And all the crimes they've committed
[2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:05.680]  And all the dozens of texts
[2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:07.680]  Will stop him
[2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:09.680]  He's a danger
[2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:11.680]  He'll keep you from getting in office
[2:21:11.680 --> 2:21:13.680]  Once he's in office will stop him
[2:21:13.680 --> 2:21:15.680]  And then he gets up
[2:21:15.680 --> 2:21:17.680]  In a five minute statement
[2:21:17.680 --> 2:21:19.680]  I'll be putting his quotes up
[2:21:19.680 --> 2:21:21.680]  From the text messages while he talks
[2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:23.680]  This is like
[2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:25.680]  Somebody saying that they
[2:21:27.680 --> 2:21:29.680]  Like to play football
[2:21:29.680 --> 2:21:31.680]  And then say they've never seen a football game
[2:21:31.680 --> 2:21:33.680]  I mean he's in this a thousand percent
[2:21:33.680 --> 2:21:35.680]  He's a democratic operative
[2:21:35.680 --> 2:21:37.680]  He covers up for Hillary
[2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:39.680]  He's the little special minion that does all this
[2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:41.680]  In all these investigations
[2:21:41.680 --> 2:21:43.680]  And now he's telling you it's preposterous
[2:21:43.680 --> 2:21:45.680]  I did none of this political
[2:21:45.680 --> 2:21:47.680]  My Mueller and Rosenstein
[2:21:47.680 --> 2:21:49.680]  And all of this is completely normal
[2:21:49.680 --> 2:21:51.680]  Let's go to it right now
[2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:53.680]  I testify today with significant regret
[2:21:53.680 --> 2:21:55.680]  I'm sorry to pause again
[2:21:55.680 --> 2:21:57.680]  I've got it on my phone here
[2:21:57.680 --> 2:21:59.680]  A photo of Howdy Doody, I mean
[2:21:59.680 --> 2:22:01.680]  Rosenstein where he looks so satanic
[2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:03.680]  Not just his actions but
[2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:05.680]  The way he looks, I'm going to pull that up but
[2:22:05.680 --> 2:22:07.680]  For TV viewers we're going to be blowing up the faces
[2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:09.680]  Of the FBI people behind him
[2:22:09.680 --> 2:22:11.680]  That walked in with him
[2:22:11.680 --> 2:22:13.680]  Look at these people
[2:22:13.680 --> 2:22:15.680]  They just hire the most weak, stupid followers
[2:22:15.680 --> 2:22:17.680]  All of them look like
[2:22:17.680 --> 2:22:19.680]  You wouldn't let them babysit your children
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:21.680]  All of them look like
[2:22:21.680 --> 2:22:23.680]  Deranged loons from a Hollywood movie
[2:22:23.680 --> 2:22:25.680]  This guy, all of them
[2:22:25.680 --> 2:22:27.680]  I mean I would cast them in a movie
[2:22:27.680 --> 2:22:29.680]  As
[2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:31.680]  Really bad guys
[2:22:31.680 --> 2:22:33.680]  It's not just how they look, it's how they act
[2:22:33.680 --> 2:22:35.680]  But I mean it's ridiculous
[2:22:35.680 --> 2:22:37.680]  They're not square jawed FBI agents
[2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:39.680]  Somebody plugged my phone in, I forgot to do it
[2:22:39.680 --> 2:22:41.680]  There's my plugs over here somewhere
[2:22:41.680 --> 2:22:43.680]  I'm going to plug this baby
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:45.680]  I'm going to pull up the Rosenstein photo
[2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:47.680]  It's like a really cheesy one
[2:22:47.680 --> 2:22:49.680]  Like this from the side going
[2:22:49.680 --> 2:22:51.680]  But again in their
[2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:53.680]  Little delusional world, they're part of the power structure
[2:22:53.680 --> 2:22:55.680]  They feel invincible
[2:22:55.680 --> 2:22:57.680]  They love ruling over America, it gives them this
[2:22:57.680 --> 2:22:59.680]  And selling us out to foreign interest is a bigger thrill
[2:22:59.680 --> 2:23:01.680]  So let's hear him lie to Congress
[2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:03.680]  Lie to you when on its
[2:23:03.680 --> 2:23:05.680]  Face
[2:23:05.680 --> 2:23:07.680]  You found it, good lord, look at that
[2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:09.680]  Look at that, that
[2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:11.680]  Clinton operative
[2:23:11.680 --> 2:23:13.680]  Taking over the Justice Department from Trump
[2:23:13.680 --> 2:23:15.680]  All of it and then look at that
[2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:17.680]  Look at that crazy
[2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:19.680]  Mad dog Robert Mueller
[2:23:19.680 --> 2:23:21.680]  Creature
[2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:23.680]  That's a creature of the Clintons, a Mueller of all of them
[2:23:23.680 --> 2:23:25.680]  And just he
[2:23:25.680 --> 2:23:27.680]  Everyone grovels to him in DC
[2:23:27.680 --> 2:23:29.680]  Oh, you're law enforcement, oh you could arrest me
[2:23:29.680 --> 2:23:31.680]  Oh, you could indict me
[2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:33.680]  And then they're in the news saying we're spying on
[2:23:33.680 --> 2:23:35.680]  Manafort and we know about his defense plans
[2:23:35.680 --> 2:23:37.680]  I'm like, well you're spying on
[2:23:37.680 --> 2:23:39.680]  Manafort in jail and his defense plans
[2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:41.680]  That would be a scandal five years ago
[2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:43.680]  But it's all, it's just the mad dog
[2:23:43.680 --> 2:23:45.680]  Craziness of this guy
[2:23:45.680 --> 2:23:47.680]  That doesn't get, he's already been defeated
[2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:49.680]  So let's hear from his minion
[2:23:49.680 --> 2:23:51.680]  Peter Strock right now, here it is
[2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:53.680]  I testify today
[2:23:53.680 --> 2:23:55.680]  With significant regret
[2:23:55.680 --> 2:23:57.680]  Recognizing that my texts have created
[2:23:57.680 --> 2:23:59.680]  Confusion and caused pain
[2:23:59.680 --> 2:24:01.680]  For people I love
[2:24:01.680 --> 2:24:03.680]  Certain private messages of mine
[2:24:03.680 --> 2:24:05.680]  Have provided ammunition for misguided attacks
[2:24:05.680 --> 2:24:07.680]  Against the FBI
[2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:09.680]  Zoom in on those two guys behind me
[2:24:09.680 --> 2:24:11.680]  That I love deeply and have served proudly
[2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:13.680]  As one hatchet man in the FBI
[2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:15.680]  I'm eager to answer your questions
[2:24:15.680 --> 2:24:17.680]  But let me first address those
[2:24:17.680 --> 2:24:19.680]  Much discussed texts
[2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:21.680]  Like many people
[2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:23.680]  I had and expressed personal
[2:24:23.680 --> 2:24:25.680]  Political opinions during an extraordinary
[2:24:25.680 --> 2:24:27.680]  Presidential election
[2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:29.680]  These guys are all there to keep him comfort
[2:24:29.680 --> 2:24:31.680]  And make sure they do a lot of the time
[2:24:31.680 --> 2:24:33.680]  For the security of our country
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:35.680]  Opinions that were not always expressed in terms
[2:24:35.680 --> 2:24:37.680]  I'm proud of
[2:24:37.680 --> 2:24:39.680]  But having worked in national security
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:41.680]  And proudly served in the US
[2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:43.680]  Those opinions were expressed out of
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:45.680]  Deep patriotism
[2:24:45.680 --> 2:24:47.680]  And an unyielding belief in our great
[2:24:47.680 --> 2:24:49.680]  American democracy
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:51.680]  Zoom in on him
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:53.680]  But despite how it's been characterized
[2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:55.680]  It was not limited to one person
[2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:57.680]  Or to one party
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:24:59.680]  I criticized various countries
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:01.680]  And politicians
[2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:03.680]  Including Secretary Clinton
[2:25:03.680 --> 2:25:05.680]  Senator Sanders
[2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:07.680]  Then candidate Trump
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:09.680]  But let me be clear
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:11.680]  Unequivocally
[2:25:11.680 --> 2:25:13.680]  I guess that's like a
[2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:15.680]  Vampire Ears
[2:25:15.680 --> 2:25:17.680]  Of defending our nation
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:19.680]  That's Vampire Ears
[2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:21.680]  I wonder what he does at the office
[2:25:21.680 --> 2:25:23.680]  There's Sweetie Kay
[2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:25.680]  Who's this one?
[2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:27.680]  That's
[2:25:27.680 --> 2:25:29.680]  Is that Dennis Hastert's son?
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:31.680]  It is not who I am
[2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:33.680]  And it is not something I would ever do
[2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:35.680]  Not who I am
[2:25:35.680 --> 2:25:37.680]  I'm strong
[2:25:37.680 --> 2:25:39.680]  I'm strong
[2:25:39.680 --> 2:25:41.680]  I'm strong
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:43.680]  I'm strong
[2:25:43.680 --> 2:25:45.680]  I'm strong
[2:25:45.680 --> 2:25:47.680]  Hillary's my god
[2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:49.680]  Our force will soon destroy America
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:53.680]  No evidence of bias
[2:25:53.680 --> 2:25:55.680]  In my professional actions
[2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:57.680]  There is however
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:25:59.680]  There's no evidence of bias
[2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:01.680]  We will stop it from being elected
[2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:03.680]  We will have an insurance policy
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:05.680]  He's the president
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:07.680]  There's no bias
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:09.680]  You're trying to sabotage the election
[2:26:09.680 --> 2:26:11.680]  You goddamn traitor
[2:26:11.680 --> 2:26:13.680]  Go back to him
[2:26:13.680 --> 2:26:15.680]  Important piece of evidence
[2:26:15.680 --> 2:26:17.680]  Supporting my integrity
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:19.680]  My integrity
[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:21.680]  And our lack of bias
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:23.680]  I've got the entire fruit basket brigade behind me
[2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:25.680]  In 2016
[2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:27.680]  I was one of a handful of people
[2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:29.680]  Who knew the details of Russian election interference
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:31.680]  And its possible connection
[2:26:31.680 --> 2:26:33.680]  He states that like it's a fact
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:35.680]  This information
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:37.680]  Had the potential to derail
[2:26:37.680 --> 2:26:39.680]  Oh my god we had a good time last night
[2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:41.680]  But the thought of expressing that
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:43.680]  Or explaining that information
[2:26:43.680 --> 2:26:45.680]  Never crossed my mind
[2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:47.680]  That's what FBI agents do
[2:26:47.680 --> 2:26:49.680]  Every single day
[2:26:49.680 --> 2:26:51.680]  And that's why I'm so proud of you
[2:26:51.680 --> 2:26:53.680]  And I'm particularly proud of the work that I
[2:26:53.680 --> 2:26:55.680]  I'm particularly proud that you're the patrion guard
[2:26:55.680 --> 2:26:57.680]  Our patrion guard was that they couldn't fight
[2:26:57.680 --> 2:26:59.680]  Their way out of a paper bag
[2:26:59.680 --> 2:27:01.680]  Honestly
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:03.680]  And independently
[2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:05.680]  And that's exactly what happened
[2:27:05.680 --> 2:27:07.680]  I'm proud of his friend
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:09.680]  This isn't an investigation
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:11.680]  Zoom in on his mouth
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:13.680]  A little goblin one
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:15.680]  Zoom in on his mouth
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:17.680]  He's so proud of his daddy
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:19.680]  My daddy will beat him
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:21.680]  My daddy always wins
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:23.680]  Nuler told me that time
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:25.680]  In the hotel room
[2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:27.680]  When we were meeting about politics
[2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:29.680]  In the summer of 2016
[2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:31.680]  We had an urgent need
[2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:33.680]  To protect the integrity
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:35.680]  Of an American presidential election
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:37.680]  From a hostile foreign power
[2:27:37.680 --> 2:27:39.680]  We can't beat this
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:41.680]  And divide the United States of America
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:43.680]  This is the FBI
[2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:45.680]  This investigation is not politically motivated
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:47.680]  It is not a witch hunt
[2:27:47.680 --> 2:27:49.680]  It is not a hoax
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:51.680]  Yes it's all real
[2:27:51.680 --> 2:27:53.680]  Trump's trying to make America great again
[2:27:53.680 --> 2:27:55.680]  We sold up the Chinese, he's the enemy
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:57.680]  The FBI is looking for the solution
[2:27:57.680 --> 2:27:59.680]  The FBI has directed me not to answer
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:01.680]  I will abide by the FBI's instructions
[2:28:01.680 --> 2:28:03.680]  But let me be clear
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:05.680]  This is not because I don't want to answer your questions
[2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:07.680]  Of course
[2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:09.680]  I were permitted to answer, I would
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:11.680]  The answers would doubtless be disappointing
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:13.680]  To the questioners
[2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:15.680]  And undermine the conspiracy
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:17.680]  Turn him off, all the conspiracy theories
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:19.680]  Questioning known liars like you
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:21.680]  I was just making jokes about these guys
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:23.680]  They just look ridiculous

[2:33:18.200 --> 2:33:23.680]  obedience to god it's alex jones
[2:33:48.200 --> 2:34:03.520]  it's gotten almost no attention I didn't even know a bill had been introduced
[2:34:03.520 --> 2:34:08.600]  a month ago that event if I commit civil rights violations crimes with a mask on
[2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:11.800]  they get 15 years in prison that's pretty normal under aggravated assault type
[2:34:11.800 --> 2:34:16.360]  laws like you rob a bank with his mask it's it's even more time set of 15
[2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:20.040]  years like 30 years and so I saw the story in the epoch times we'll put it up
[2:34:20.040 --> 2:34:23.160]  on screen and they mentioned that Mike Cernovich had been promoting it and so
[2:34:23.160 --> 2:34:27.480]  many times you know Mike's kind of that catalyst there at the that helped take
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:31.960]  something the next level Mike pointed out to us that you know we had Bill
[2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:35.520]  Clinton come into town a few weeks ago so I wanted to get Mike on about this
[2:34:35.520 --> 2:34:39.400]  because and he was getting more aggressive more vicious they're attacking
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:44.680]  more the left trying to cause a civil war and what does he think the next
[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:49.120]  shooting drop is so Mike thanks for coming on with us yeah my pleasure this
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:55.480]  is an important law that treats and Tifa what they are which is they are the
[2:34:55.480 --> 2:35:02.000]  modern KKK they are a modern terrorist hate organization they've said that they
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:06.480]  are pro pedophile they've said that they hate and want to kill all people who
[2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:12.840]  voted for Trump they've announced their intention to destroy America internally
[2:35:12.840 --> 2:35:19.200]  so they are being treated as it should be treated which is as terrorists let's
[2:35:19.200 --> 2:35:24.000]  talk about this bill again it's from epoch times it's on your website as well
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:28.040]  it's on info wars.com but let's let's let's talk about the Pacific bill
[2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:33.360]  unmasking Antifa Act in house proposed a 15-year prison term if you beat people
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:36.680]  up or attack them when they're exercising their free speech I mean that's
[2:35:36.680 --> 2:35:40.560]  exactly what the Klan did for folks that didn't know in the 20s and 30s and 40s
[2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:44.120]  when it was actually powerful was suppressed sharecropper whites and
[2:35:44.120 --> 2:35:47.960]  also blacks from voting or having demonstrations they were an anti free
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:55.120]  speech intimidation arm. Right the law is again flew under the radar ironically
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:00.240]  I only learned about it because unlike liberals I follow everybody and I saw
[2:36:00.240 --> 2:36:05.280]  that a far left-wing activist slash journalist has said I can't believe
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:10.000]  Congress is considering that I go oh thank you thank you for the tip-off I
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:14.920]  actually had no idea so we've had thousands of people yeah Jack Smith
[2:36:14.920 --> 2:36:19.200]  actually had tipped everybody off he has a very obscure account but I like to
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:23.080]  follow those obscure accounts to really to really know what the far left is
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:28.360]  thinking and I was like oh okay let's talk about this a little bit and
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:33.400]  thousands of people have called Congress and have said this is way past due
[2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:38.280]  because the reason they wear masks is so you can't find them so a lot of a
[2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:43.040]  hubble is being made about the fact that all of the charges and the disrupt J20
[2:36:43.040 --> 2:36:47.560]  riots during a inauguration were dismissed and people go oh poor Antifa
[2:36:47.560 --> 2:36:52.480]  they were impressed by the government no no no they had masks on so you couldn't
[2:36:52.480 --> 2:36:57.800]  tell who remember they burned down that a Muslim they burned down a Muslim limo
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:04.080]  driver's car they destroyed a property of people without any regard for the
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:07.640]  safety of others and you couldn't figure out who they were because they were all
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:12.240]  they were all we took us hours to get and they were mainly beating up women
[2:37:12.240 --> 2:37:15.560]  and blocking the entrances so seeing it could say no one was inside the
[2:37:15.560 --> 2:37:20.280]  inauguration yeah exactly the deplorable I mean there's a number of things
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:26.680]  actually just recently for example the Fox News reporter she had to quit
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:30.160]  reporting outside of the Supreme Court she got run out of there and that's
[2:37:30.160 --> 2:37:32.840]  another thing I've tried to videotape outside the Supreme Court police they
[2:37:32.840 --> 2:37:35.720]  have to get a permit but all the left could show up the police just let them
[2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:44.440]  do it right and then they ran off of court so one that's what they do all right
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:47.720]  let's let your skype come back let's let your skype come back for a moment Mike
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:51.680]  Sernovich is our guest Mike clearly they're trying to cause a civil war
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:55.800]  they're saying surround the White House they want to try to block the new
[2:37:55.800 --> 2:37:59.200]  Supreme Court nominee then when I can say that they want a civil war and they're
[2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:03.240]  calling it one even USA Day calls a civil war then make a joke about it but
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:06.600]  where would you say we are right now you're a smart guy what do you think
[2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:12.120]  you're planning ahead of the midterms try to derail things well what they're
[2:38:12.120 --> 2:38:17.000]  doing is they're energizing the the terrorist element of the far left wing
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:21.680]  they're now overtly saying that they are communists and I predict a major
[2:38:21.680 --> 2:38:27.200]  terrorist attack by a far left wing element perhaps a Democrat socialist
[2:38:27.200 --> 2:38:33.520]  perhaps an Antifa element it just really is it's going to happen and what they
[2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:38.320]  don't understand and broadly speaking of course I talked to a lot of liberals and
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:42.040]  one of the most agenda he's a very far left guy but he's still like a very good
[2:38:42.040 --> 2:38:47.200]  human being good good Christian and he goes you know I just want the civil war
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:53.000]  to get off I was like what are you thinking yeah how could you think that
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:58.440]  but that's where they are why do you think while they call for civil war
[2:38:58.440 --> 2:39:04.640]  everywhere when I cover it then they say I'm crazy it's not happening yeah yeah
[2:39:04.640 --> 2:39:08.520]  then they go your conspiracy theorists but you can just go read Twitter that I
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:13.840]  love when they go oh Alex's July 4 tweet about a second civil war is a
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:19.160]  conspiracy theory but if you go on Twitter just type in civil war you can
[2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:22.280]  find tens of thousands of results from people on the left thing they want to
[2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:25.560]  include they said this July 4th we're going to intensify attacks they did I'm
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:30.400]  just saying as a D demarcation line if they're successful you can mark this
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:34.520]  July 4th as when it's going to escalate up so but I'm asking what's the tactic
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:39.760]  then to call for it but when we cover it says not happening well what they're
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:44.280]  doing is they're actually gaslighting you to try to get you banned you know one
[2:39:44.280 --> 2:39:48.280]  of your competitors is like anti-trustee and then is trying to get you banned for
[2:39:48.280 --> 2:39:51.880]  reporting on what the left is saying so what they're doing is they're so
[2:39:51.880 --> 2:39:56.360]  duplicitous that people on the far left say we're gonna intensify our efforts
[2:39:56.360 --> 2:40:00.120]  after July 4th we're really gonna fight hard and then they say oh yeah we're
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:05.520]  communists and we want to abolish eyes but then the New York Times will fact
[2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:08.800]  check it and say actually Democrats don't want to abolish eyes even though a
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:13.760]  survey just came out from a liberal publication saying that 45 percent of
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:18.240]  Democrats want to abolish eyes right so what they do they're gaslighting us
[2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:23.560]  now and saying well I mean even though you can show a screenshot of what they
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:27.480]  said even though you can show a survey we're just gonna say that that isn't
[2:40:27.480 --> 2:40:31.120]  really true and that nobody wants to abolish eyes and then they're gonna say
[2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:35.160]  well Facebook you're fighting fake news why don't you ban our competitor Alex
[2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:40.440]  Jones from your platform right that's where we are what they're doing is they
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:44.640]  did this to me they fact-checked me I did an article in a video where I said
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:48.840]  that the one of the school shooters which by the way we all forgot about
[2:40:48.840 --> 2:40:52.400]  because he didn't use an AR-15 and therefore it didn't work in the agenda
[2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:57.760]  the most recent school shooting the shooter had on an iron cross and he had
[2:40:57.760 --> 2:41:03.160]  on a hammer and sickle and I said those are symbols of the alt-right and in
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:08.000]  Tifa right and then they fact-checked it and the fact checker goes well the
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:12.880]  hammer and sickle is in a symbol of in Tifa but well just go to you could go
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:16.840]  to Google image and type it in Tifa every rally they have there are people
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:22.240]  wearing that Soviet Union stuff and then they wear black and then they wear
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:28.320]  hammer and sickle's pins right so then I got fact-checked and then I got a
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:32.720]  strike against my Facebook page because while you were fact-checked sir and
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:35.640]  then when I go Facebook what are you talking about I can show you a thousand
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:40.520]  images well we've outsourced you know this to fact-checker.org so what fact
[2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:45.080]  checker does now is they just out so I might actually sue fact checker. They outsourced
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:49.240]  the Southern Poverty Law Center. Right and then they go all our hands are tied a
[2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:54.800]  Christian group for example was banned from Amazon Smiles program because the
[2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:59.360]  Southern Poverty Law Center now has VO control I mean there's so much going on
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:05.000]  out. Think what authoritarian's they're all over CNN bragging how they're
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:08.560]  censoring conservatives Christians veterans gun groups and sovereign
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:15.200]  groups you know Taiwanese groups Taiwanese flag is banned on on on Apple to
[2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:19.360]  tweet to be able to text it I mean we're under total attack and they they
[2:42:19.360 --> 2:42:23.000]  announce it but then go oh but you're crazy it's not happening. Yeah I mean
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:27.200]  everywhere you look the Alliance I mean facts the Alliance Defense Fund has been
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:32.680]  banned from Amazon Smiles program that's a fact why because Amazon has delegated
[2:42:32.680 --> 2:42:37.360]  control over the Amazon Smiles program to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Let's
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:40.480]  come back from break and talk about how we change this because it's such a bold

[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:11.800]  coming in here of a compilation of the media attacking info wars all the fake
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:15.480]  TV shows they've got all the programs Sasha Barrett Cohen we now know for six
[2:48:15.480 --> 2:48:19.840]  months been trying to infiltrate us and been trying to like him because he
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:22.400]  couldn't get in the office he got on with like guests and tried to mess with
[2:48:22.400 --> 2:48:26.000]  them I was told about this a month ago but but now I've been given the full
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:33.520]  details so that's all coming up but but but Mike Cernovich striking back how we
[2:48:33.520 --> 2:48:37.680]  win how we take action what Trump should do because I'm not bragging you're not
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:43.040]  bragging but the White House listens to us the campaign listens to us what do you
[2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:47.280]  think we should do to strike back against all of this and and just the
[2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:54.720]  unbrazened untethered attacks that we're seeing against free speech right now
[2:48:54.720 --> 2:48:59.520]  where do you see it going well unfortunately because neither you know
[2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:05.800]  why I like to do election stuff we don't endorse candidates as journalists if we
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:10.800]  if America loses the House of Representatives and Democrats win in
[2:49:10.800 --> 2:49:16.440]  November we're all like dead I don't mean I don't mean I don't mean figuratively
[2:49:16.440 --> 2:49:21.600]  Alex I get death threats there's an active campaign by members of the media
[2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:26.320]  to have me murdered and I imagine you murder had a private security analysis
[2:49:26.320 --> 2:49:33.960]  conducted of me and I've been told by people very very high-level chatter that
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:39.760]  they're hearing that's what your sky's breaking up but yes they they know they
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:43.360]  put out a certain amount of propaganda against somebody mentally ill people
[2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:47.680]  will try to come kill you just like they advertise in the New York Times where
[2:49:47.680 --> 2:49:51.400]  the baseball team was playing to get Scalise shot they were planning to take
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:56.200]  out the leaders that they're definitely doing this yeah that's their game is oh
[2:49:56.200 --> 2:50:01.360]  you know they actually the hate list that's what the SPLC yeah actually LA
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:04.800]  Times journalist was talking about this LA Times journalist fired for death
[2:50:04.800 --> 2:50:08.320]  threat because again you're not even a conservative you're more of a libertarian
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:12.800]  they hate you because you're a likable guy yeah and that's the whole thing is I
[2:50:12.800 --> 2:50:18.080]  haven't even been controversial for like a year if people wanted to criticize me a
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:21.040]  lot of people like me and you're boring you know even do anything and I'm like
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:27.200]  well yeah because I feel the energy and we have to we have to calm it down or
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:32.520]  it's gonna be mass murder by the left in the street and as you know if the left
[2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:35.720]  is in the street murdering people they will kill innocent people they will kill
[2:50:35.720 --> 2:50:40.360]  children so not only Alice did at LA Times reporter get fired for that
[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:46.920]  threatening me a pedophile who had organized a smear campaign against me
[2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:52.440]  when I spoke at Columbia was arrested for trying to have sex with an eight-year-old
[2:50:52.440 --> 2:50:56.280]  this is not a conspiracy theory these are quarter that's on your Twitter at
[2:50:56.280 --> 2:51:00.480]  Cernovich and let's explain this we'll win a physical civil war we don't want to
[2:51:00.480 --> 2:51:05.240]  go down that road so they are just intensifying the threats the bizarre
[2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:09.880]  behavior or the LA Times and others think they can threaten to kill you and
[2:51:09.880 --> 2:51:13.680]  now they're shocked they're getting in trouble so tell us about this reported
[2:51:13.680 --> 2:51:19.840]  pedophile yeah so in November of last year I gave a talk to Columbia media
[2:51:19.840 --> 2:51:25.040]  criticism it was a very you know very rational talk about the double standards
[2:51:25.040 --> 2:51:31.840]  he organized a protest against me well flash forward or fast forward a few
[2:51:31.840 --> 2:51:38.240]  months he's been arrested for soliciting sex with an eight-year-old an eight-year-old
[2:51:38.240 --> 2:51:43.920]  Alex he had pictures of infants he said he was interested in zero plus that's
[2:51:43.920 --> 2:51:49.640]  their code and again people go this is a conspiracy no no no this is official
[2:51:49.640 --> 2:51:52.840]  federal court records I actually uploaded the full complaint that was
[2:51:52.840 --> 2:51:57.680]  show that the thing is they keep busting top Hillary Clinton people that are
[2:51:57.680 --> 2:52:02.760]  involved in in in children quote immigrating to the US saying they want
[2:52:02.760 --> 2:52:06.160]  to have sex with two-year-olds so you've now exposed it it's literally a
[2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:13.400]  pedophile cult yeah and not only that yeah but the complaint is so graphic and
[2:52:13.400 --> 2:52:17.800]  notice none of this ever hits the news though I mean no no busting pedophiles
[2:52:17.800 --> 2:52:24.120]  what ten times what it was yeah exactly all the time and not only that but I'm
[2:52:24.120 --> 2:52:29.920]  gonna I'm gonna send Daria a picture they claim oh he had no connection to
[2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:36.760]  the Clinton campaign but before he took down before he took down his Instagram
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:42.120]  there were pictures of him at the Clinton campaign headquarters not only that
[2:52:42.120 --> 2:52:46.280]  I'm in Hillary garb yeah so that's what I'm saying is let me ask you this is
[2:52:46.280 --> 2:52:51.560]  smart guy the lawyer we we know there's a lot of pedophiles but my god how many
[2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:58.200]  Democrats are because I'm realizing it's a cult not only that Alex I just
[2:52:58.200 --> 2:53:06.200]  reported yesterday at sternovich.com if you go to CERNOVICH.com I obtained court
[2:53:06.200 --> 2:53:10.600]  records involving a pedophile who was highly placed within the bill the
[2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:17.320]  Blasio campaign he was arrested a year ago with thousands of images of children
[2:53:17.320 --> 2:53:22.840]  being raped so I go oh that was a year ago I wonder if he's in jail no no no
[2:53:22.840 --> 2:53:27.200]  official court records again oh conspiracy theory no you mean official
[2:53:27.200 --> 2:53:32.680]  court records nothing has happened in this case so what they did if somebody
[2:53:32.680 --> 2:53:35.640]  is in a lawyer they don't really understand what they're doing what they
[2:53:35.640 --> 2:53:43.760]  did is they let him out on $7,500 bail and nothing has happened no trials no
[2:53:43.760 --> 2:53:49.920]  nothing he just shows up oh clearly it's how they compromise people you've got to
[2:53:49.920 --> 2:53:54.240]  be in the club to be part of it how big is it because we know trumps can fold at
[2:53:54.240 --> 2:53:57.840]  least busting pedophiles that's why they're all panicking yeah there he is
[2:53:57.840 --> 2:54:02.480]  far-left worker for the Clinton campaign running a child charity admitting he
[2:54:02.480 --> 2:54:06.720]  raped children trying to meet with two-year-olds to have sex with him let's
[2:54:06.720 --> 2:54:10.640]  put that back up he's the guy on the far left there I mean let's let's you know
[2:54:10.640 --> 2:54:17.400]  let's name this guy Mike go ahead
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:25.320]  yeah so this can't this can't be denied and then the media fact check that all
[2:54:25.320 --> 2:54:35.400]  of you campaign person he's on Instagram crazy so just in a 35,000 foot view what
[2:54:35.400 --> 2:54:40.000]  what is the normal persons like even they're normal like a normal straight
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:44.880]  persons into women normal gay persons into you know their own what is this
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:48.600]  thing with children because it seems like every time we knock some wall down
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:53.960]  it's a bunch of pedophiles like what is going on there yeah well there's
[2:54:53.960 --> 2:55:00.880]  ritualistic practices that they have and it is um it's fundamentally fundamentally
[2:55:00.880 --> 2:55:05.680]  it's the most demonic thing you can do is to harm a child so that's how they
[2:55:05.680 --> 2:55:10.960]  gain power in the Democrat Party is they prove because ultimately I mean it
[2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:16.520]  can't be denied anymore Trump and the Republicans are the side of God the
[2:55:16.520 --> 2:55:21.680]  Democrats are now the side of pedophiles I mean they're Anthony Wiener the
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:27.240]  Jacob Schwartz Joel Davis these aren't nobody's these are top-level people right
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:31.040]  how many more do we need to see I don't see top-level Republicans other than
[2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:35.640]  Dennis Haster who was by the way he should have been sentenced to death for
[2:55:35.640 --> 2:55:39.200]  what he did and we've got low we've expressed with Epstein and we've got
[2:55:39.200 --> 2:55:42.920]  Hillary and her own workers bringing kids in illegally I mean they Hillary's
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:47.280]  first jobs the lawyer were eight guys that gang raped a 11-year-old girl till
[2:55:47.280 --> 2:55:51.760]  her cervix broke and her guts came out I mean I'm gonna be grossier but I mean
[2:55:51.760 --> 2:55:55.760]  there this child abuse charity had arrested for attempted child rape
[2:55:55.760 --> 2:56:03.800]  unbelievable in 2013 to there was that 2013 report for like 30 seconds where
[2:56:03.800 --> 2:56:08.240]  even I think it was chock-tied as the MEC report people can find it the State
[2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:14.240]  Department covered up pedophilia 2013 this is all like you and all of it's
[2:56:14.240 --> 2:56:18.560]  been caught and so who's the Columbia University student who protested you
[2:56:18.560 --> 2:56:23.600]  because it ties into that yeah he's Joel Davis he was the person who was just
[2:56:23.600 --> 2:56:27.800]  arrested he organized the protest marching into me remember when they held
[2:56:27.800 --> 2:56:32.120]  up that sign no pedobashing and the media goes oh that was a false flag
[2:56:32.120 --> 2:56:36.480]  operation organized by because they can be conspiracy theorists right oh that
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:39.520]  was a certain it's false like but now the guy's been arrested let me ask you
[2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:44.840]  this then when I I've admitted that I had girlfriends that abortions I said I
[2:56:44.840 --> 2:56:48.760]  repent to God I feel bad I haven't done it since I got four children I'm being
[2:56:48.760 --> 2:56:51.960]  honest telling people that have had abortions don't have to get into it don't
[2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:55.240]  have to say it's right say you're wrong repent I was telling that to be honest
[2:56:55.240 --> 2:56:58.600]  but then the left calls in and goes what's wrong with screwing kids if you've
[2:56:58.600 --> 2:57:03.000]  killed them well I didn't know that was happening I was delusional or my
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:07.040]  girlfriends did it I'm not saying it's okay but then their answer is well it's
[2:57:07.040 --> 2:57:12.000]  okay to have sex with kids that's what they're hammering me with well that's
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:16.320]  because that's why they hate us they don't they don't they hate what are your

[3:00:13.800 --> 3:00:18.680]  analyst lawyer during the break and I said how could they defeat us when
[3:00:18.680 --> 3:00:21.960]  humanity's awakening they said well they hold the keys of the kingdom they
[3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:27.680]  have apple transferred to China now banning emojis of Taiwan your phone
[3:00:27.680 --> 3:00:32.440]  crashes they just aren't willing to implement the censorship fully because
[3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:36.200]  they're afraid congress and Trump might call them out and when I've talked to the
[3:00:36.200 --> 3:00:40.240]  White House and the president and his supporters lately I've said please
[3:00:40.240 --> 3:00:43.680]  they're censoring they're doing it do something like well what are they doing
[3:00:43.680 --> 3:00:51.200]  write us a report so I'm in the process of doing that but it's here and so they
[3:00:51.200 --> 3:00:54.440]  are ready to launch on all cylinders ladies and gentlemen they're ready to
[3:00:54.440 --> 3:00:58.520]  try to shut this whole thing down right now and so I wanted Mike Cernovich
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:03.080]  to specifically speak to that and talk to that because they've got the kill
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:07.240]  switch in place they believe we're idiots they're making their move Mike
[3:01:07.240 --> 3:01:14.240]  Cernovich yeah they have now YouTube is given 25 million dollars to multi-billion
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:18.400]  dollar corporations because somebody explained that to me why CNN which is
[3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:24.080]  valued at 10 to 15 billion dollars is getting 25 million from YouTube right
[3:01:24.080 --> 3:01:29.320]  how's that make any sense the SPLC try to take control Spotify and censor music
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:35.520]  the SPLC is taking control of who can raise funds for nonprofits on Amazon
[3:01:35.520 --> 3:01:41.200]  Facebook has outsourced fact-checking to websites that have been caught
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:46.520]  deliberately manufacturing and being dishonest in effort to get people banned
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:53.680]  one of Info Wars competitors is actually lobbying Facebook to ban Info Wars so
[3:01:53.680 --> 3:02:00.840]  everywhere you look the Gestapo the Gestapo is really trying to surround the
[3:02:00.840 --> 3:02:06.560]  Patriots and that is why I have in-person events we have to do more
[3:02:06.560 --> 3:02:11.240]  things what are they afraid of exactly if the internet goes dark we got it get
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:15.520]  Trump what should Trump do to try to stop it though
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:20.400]  well I mean Trump and his people are so out of touch that they're not gonna do
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:24.720]  anything actually even though they're the ones who are losing it so it's
[3:02:24.720 --> 3:02:31.200]  fundamentally upon you and others like myself and the Info Warriors who are
[3:02:31.200 --> 3:02:34.960]  who are watching to take action Trump is just out of touch he's in a bubble
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:40.440]  because you understand the people around Trump they know that if the internet
[3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:45.600]  is censored Trump will lose and they want Trump to lose so Trump is not getting
[3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:52.000]  other than Don Jr. Trump is not getting a proper lay of the land of what is
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:55.760]  happening I mean Trump for example when he did a talk with Charlie Kirk
[3:02:55.760 --> 3:03:00.120]  Trump goes oh yeah I mean and Tifa they're not really hurting anybody but
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:05.920]  John Noelty of Breitbart has documented I think over 300 cases of violence against
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:10.560]  Trump supporters and again the violence is not happening against me you know
[3:03:10.560 --> 3:03:16.480]  marginal oh I'm such a no it shows up and then so CNN openly calling for the
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:20.160]  ban of info wars off the web all Facebook they are counting on us being
[3:03:20.160 --> 3:03:24.520]  country bumpkins they're counting on us being stupid they're smiling like a pig
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:31.120]  over a big bowl of crap thinking we're done yeah we have to do more happy
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:37.120]  hours we have to do more events we have to do more live input like you and I
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:42.120]  for example we had talked about doing a premiere for hoax my documentary on
[3:03:42.120 --> 3:03:45.840]  showing who really the fake news is what you're in you know we've talked about
[3:03:45.840 --> 3:03:50.360]  maybe doing a premiere in Austin you know sell 5,000 tickets or something like
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:55.040]  that and to show people like this doesn't think everywhere I go and I've been
[3:03:55.040 --> 3:03:59.000]  with you at Austin oh how you doing if you read the newspapers you would think
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:04.000]  that I'm a goblin that people hide from and think I'm hiding under their bed but
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:08.480]  those people that are awake think we've already had the victory no we just
[3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:13.480]  started the war now we're out on the field in the real fight absolutely my
[3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:18.000]  it is totally on and and you know the president has been trying to reach out
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:21.560]  to people to find out what's going on he's figured it all out but we've got a
[3:04:21.560 --> 3:04:25.560]  just everybody should write articles messages the president briefs for the
[3:04:25.560 --> 3:04:28.360]  president all of you about what's happening reach out to him everywhere
[3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:33.400]  and we're gonna win stay with us we'll be right back Mike Cernovich thank you so
[3:04:33.400 --> 3:04:39.240]  much we'll be right back after this a quick break with Mike Adams in studio
[3:04:53.320 --> 3:04:58.400]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:02.680]  drama can be found here in Lailania States but a lot of us on the big island
[3:05:02.680 --> 3:05:07.000]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:12.520]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[3:05:12.520 --> 3:05:17.560]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[3:05:17.560 --> 3:05:23.120]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[3:05:23.120 --> 3:05:28.240]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:32.560]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[3:05:32.560 --> 3:05:37.880]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[3:05:37.880 --> 3:05:43.840]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[3:05:43.840 --> 3:05:48.040]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[3:05:48.040 --> 3:06:09.000]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:20.480]  we now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the resistance
[3:06:22.480 --> 3:06:27.720]  you cannot make this stuff up and I tell you all of it I could literally keep you
[3:06:27.720 --> 3:06:33.640]  here all night because the stories are just so unbelievable this is coming to
[3:06:33.640 --> 3:06:42.280]  a theater near you Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments
[3:06:42.280 --> 3:06:46.480]  hatred of media he's been called a freak show and downright dangerous but there's
[3:06:46.480 --> 3:06:50.320]  a lot of controversy around this that work about Alex Jones for example Alex
[3:06:50.320 --> 3:06:54.000]  Jones in Fort Worth not common I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:59.280]  shut up this isn't a game but the fact is that he is an unalloyed racist a man
[3:06:59.280 --> 3:07:03.720]  who's out there pulling the pin on the grenade every day and he has six million
[3:07:03.720 --> 3:07:07.760]  viewers he is somebody who president Trump called after the election to thank
[3:07:07.760 --> 3:07:13.640]  him for his role Trump had gone on his radio show during the campaign
[3:07:13.640 --> 3:07:20.760]  false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year it's now clear
[3:07:20.760 --> 3:07:26.280]  that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences people have free
[3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:29.560]  speech in this country but no matter how hateful and how stupid no matter how
[3:07:29.560 --> 3:07:34.080]  we mean give me a time give him thorazine also I don't like giving people
[3:07:34.080 --> 3:07:39.240]  like Alex Jones a platform if something popped up in a Facebook feed and looked
[3:07:39.240 --> 3:07:45.360]  like a news report people were inclined to believe it and if they were already
[3:07:45.360 --> 3:07:53.880]  targeted psychologically to be receptive to the information provided they were
[3:07:53.880 --> 3:07:58.400]  influencable where are you getting this information from a very reputable source
[3:07:58.400 --> 3:08:05.000]  what the FBI the CIA info wars it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones you know
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:10.000]  he's legit we confirm suspicions at Veritas it's not a shock to you but to
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:14.960]  get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it I mean you
[3:08:14.960 --> 3:08:19.160]  must be a threat if they call you out by name it's also what happens when you
[3:08:19.160 --> 3:08:24.560]  listen to the radio host Alex Jones after just a short time ago and I'm
[3:08:24.560 --> 3:08:28.920]  talking about when this meeting started on Twitter if you clicked on the
[3:08:28.920 --> 3:08:35.840]  hashtag NYC terrorist attack which is quote trending marked with a red button
[3:08:35.840 --> 3:08:41.640]  saying quote live the top tweet links to an info wars story with the headline
[3:08:41.640 --> 3:08:47.320]  and mom I warned a blaseo about New York City a terror he was too busy bashing
[3:08:47.320 --> 3:08:53.880]  Trump I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart
[3:08:53.880 --> 3:09:01.640]  must be to say things like that this is a real-time example of when we talk
[3:09:01.640 --> 3:09:07.440]  about this information being weaponized but Trump doesn't challenge these lies
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:13.400]  he actually went on Jones's show and said your reputation is amazing I will
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:20.660]  not let you down you will be very very impressed I hope he still calls Alex
[3:09:20.660 --> 3:09:26.120]  Jones and talks to him and you know the info wars or worse conspiracy theory
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:32.000]  theories how quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:38.480]  record straight so that the people who saw this know that it's fake news and at
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:42.360]  least at some point time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:45.240]  through legitimate world that's something we're thinking about all the time
[3:09:45.240 --> 3:09:49.320]  because it's it's a bad user experience and we we don't want to be known as a
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:55.800]  platform for that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign
[3:09:55.800 --> 3:10:03.560]  against my campaign to influence voters in the election they did it through
[3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:07.480]  false news sites they did it through these thousand agents they did it through
[3:10:07.480 --> 3:10:10.440]  machine learning which you know kept spewing out this stuff over and over
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:18.480]  again and they began to have some of their allies within the internet world
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:24.560]  like info wars take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous outlandish
[3:10:24.560 --> 3:10:29.120]  absurd lies you can imagine
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:33.600]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her
[3:10:33.600 --> 3:10:38.280]  campaign by changing its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body
[3:10:38.280 --> 3:10:42.920]  count story that's according to website info wars you have RT you have Sputnik
[3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:51.480]  you have roughly and then I think you have them feeding other entities info
[3:10:51.480 --> 3:10:55.120]  wars comes to mind where those are echo chambers it's been widely reported that
[3:10:55.120 --> 3:10:58.800]  that company has been backed by the Kremlin and they gave you 75,000 shares
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:03.520]  that you had to disclose when you went into the Obama administration maybe
[3:11:03.520 --> 3:11:09.280]  you're looking at widely reported information from info wars no I'm not
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:13.880]  political this is the nearer times this is the Wall Street Journal no it's not
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:19.240]  if a Google user types in Clinton body they get car repair shop results instead
[3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:22.440]  of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have
[3:11:22.440 --> 3:11:26.400]  died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades the latest
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:30.360]  story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich who was murdered last month in an
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:35.640]  apparent robbery WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his
[3:11:35.640 --> 3:11:39.840]  source but as made no further comments about the case that murder we should say
[3:11:39.840 --> 3:11:44.520]  remains unsolved the Russians in my opinion and based on the intel and
[3:11:44.520 --> 3:11:49.360]  counter-intel people I've talked to could not have known how best to
[3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:54.560]  weaponize that information unless they had been guided all that stuff exists
[3:11:54.560 --> 3:12:00.320]  you don't see it you don't feel it if you're largely living in reality and in
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:05.960]  a mainstream media world but it's it's it's undermining our democracy and I
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:09.680]  think that the companies themselves they've taken some steps they have a
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:13.480]  lot of responsibility companies like Facebook companies like Facebook Google
[3:12:13.480 --> 3:12:22.400]  etc. right to do what they can to essentially not enhance how quickly
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:27.320]  can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:31.440]  the system self-corrected that's not that shouldn't be the first what you see
[3:12:31.440 --> 3:12:36.600]  anymore should be a USA article the last time I checked but you saw this USA
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:40.880]  today at lunch I did yeah and this and I also saw the system system correct it
[3:12:40.880 --> 3:12:44.680]  that man's breath they didn't call it Fox News by name they didn't call out
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:49.080]  anyone else by name they said when it comes to Alex Jones we need people to
[3:12:49.080 --> 3:12:53.800]  scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video we're not
[3:12:53.800 --> 3:12:57.360]  we're not going to allow that video if it gets 10 million views to be on the
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:00.920]  front of the so-called news carousel
[3:13:10.120 --> 3:13:13.880]  this is Mike Adams jumping into the seat here on an extraordinary day thank
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:18.520]  you for continuing with us in the fourth hour of this broadcast we've got
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:24.280]  coming up 10 quick questions that Peter Strock needs to be asked by Congress
[3:13:24.280 --> 3:13:29.560]  I've got other lists of why we can never let leftists gain power over us again
[3:13:29.560 --> 3:13:35.600]  there is a multifaceted war taking place right now against not just America but
[3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:40.720]  those who are trying to defend against America the attacks are being ramped up
[3:13:40.720 --> 3:13:44.880]  on Infowars on Alex Jones on people like Mike Cernovich who you just heard
[3:13:44.880 --> 3:13:50.840]  from and even people like myself as well we're all under extreme attack and the
[3:13:50.840 --> 3:13:56.360]  the deep state traders and liars are sitting there in Congress and or in
[3:13:56.360 --> 3:14:00.280]  front of Congress and telling us that they aren't biased that they didn't do
[3:14:00.280 --> 3:14:05.280]  anything wrong the very people who I believe need to be indicted who need to
[3:14:05.280 --> 3:14:11.000]  be arrested and held for trial they need to be brought up on charges for
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:15.200]  attempting to overthrow this constitutional republic conspiracy
[3:14:15.200 --> 3:14:20.880]  racketeering the corruption the number of violations of crime the number of
[3:14:20.880 --> 3:14:25.280]  criminal violations they have engaged in is huge destruction of evidence look at
[3:14:25.280 --> 3:14:28.320]  Hillary Clinton destroying the evidence and getting away with it why
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:33.080]  because other people like Peter Strock helped cover it up and then now we learn
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:38.000]  that Peter Strock himself got to be the one to vet which of his texts were
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:43.600]  forwarded to Congress where the FBI under the leadership of James Comey at
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:48.520]  that time believed that it was above the law believe that Congress has no
[3:14:48.520 --> 3:14:53.520]  oversight over the FBI get a grip on reality people we got to take our
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:14:56.880]  country back and the only way we're going to do that is to hold these people
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:15:00.480]  accountable for the crimes that they have committed over and over again and
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:05.880]  they're still lying to our faces every day it is a it is a parade of
[3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:11.440]  criminality corruption and incompetence and the cost that we are going to pay
[3:15:11.440 --> 3:15:16.760]  if we don't get a grip on this is we're gonna lose our country if we don't get a
[3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:23.960]  grip on it so stay with us here folks we got we've got some more a lot coming up
[3:15:23.960 --> 3:15:28.480]  this is Mike Adams here filling in for the fourth hour at info wars stay with
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:33.160]  us we'll be right back after this coming break with much more straight ahead
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:37.680]  we're fighting for everything that matters fighting for our future
[3:15:52.120 --> 3:15:58.800]  you have been lied to my name is Kevin ship I'm a former decorated CIA
[3:15:58.800 --> 3:16:02.520]  officer finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best
[3:16:02.520 --> 3:16:06.720]  ex-mose on the shadow government ever we're in a constitutional crisis and
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:11.360]  our government is now being run ruled by a shadow government we got to get this
[3:16:11.360 --> 3:16:14.480]  out because just cuz you're awake folks doesn't mean other people are this is

[3:20:56.360 --> 3:21:03.000]  now every day that I that I am invited to come in here I'm humbled by what is
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:08.640]  at stake and the fact that we need to lend a voice to the big big questions
[3:21:08.640 --> 3:21:14.800]  here right now there are 10 questions that we need to to ask Peter Strock 10
[3:21:14.800 --> 3:21:19.400]  big questions this this one comes from joe hoft over at the getaway pundit
[3:21:19.400 --> 3:21:23.280]  right now but there's five of these questions that I got to mention here
[3:21:23.280 --> 3:21:28.760]  number one was Jeff sessions involved in spying on the Trump campaign big
[3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:35.040]  question where is Jeff sessions why does he seem to be backing off of his job
[3:21:35.040 --> 3:21:38.880]  why does he almost seem complicit in this I mean I don't have any evidence
[3:21:38.880 --> 3:21:43.320]  that he's a traitor I'm not saying he's a traitor or anything like that but where
[3:21:43.320 --> 3:21:48.240]  are you man Jeff sessions you're the attorney general you are supposed to be
[3:21:48.240 --> 3:21:53.160]  issuing arrest warrants for the traders the deep state operatives who are trying
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:57.040]  to overthrow this country was Jeff sessions involved in the spying on the
[3:21:57.040 --> 3:22:01.880]  Trump campaign one key question and next the next big question this is a
[3:22:01.880 --> 3:22:06.600]  question that should be mentioned to struck or asked of struck where you or
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:12.320]  anyone you are aware of involved in the transfer of us uranium to Russia because
[3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:16.280]  you know what when you look at the uranium one deal and you look at Hilary
[3:22:16.280 --> 3:22:21.440]  Clinton you find that Robert Mueller was involved back then and you find that the
[3:22:21.440 --> 3:22:27.320]  State Department was involved in some of the cover-ups related to you know
[3:22:27.320 --> 3:22:34.280]  uranium supplies that uranium this is a national security interest this is a
[3:22:34.280 --> 3:22:40.960]  rare element that is of course used for nuclear weapons development and then we
[3:22:40.960 --> 3:22:47.400]  find out that Obama funneled $33.6 billion to Iran and gave them the
[3:22:47.400 --> 3:22:51.480]  funding and set them up with the technical know-how to build ballistic missiles
[3:22:51.480 --> 3:22:56.720]  and nuclear weapon delivery systems and that he gave citizenship to a couple of
[3:22:56.720 --> 3:23:00.920]  thousand of Iranian nationals and that he did all this by bypassing the
[3:23:00.920 --> 3:23:06.400]  international banking system and all of the the chokeholds on Iran that were in
[3:23:06.400 --> 3:23:10.640]  place I mean there are some big questions here involving Barack Obama
[3:23:10.640 --> 3:23:15.560]  Robert Mueller Hilary Clinton Peter Strock and he seems to be Peter Strock
[3:23:15.560 --> 3:23:18.920]  seems to be in the middle of all this covering up Hillary Clinton's emails
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:24.400]  covering up his own texts to Lisa Page covering up the crimes of the deep state
[3:23:24.400 --> 3:23:30.800]  while launching this outrageous fake hoax Russia collusion narrative that
[3:23:30.800 --> 3:23:35.400]  itself is tearing this country apart and I will read some of the quotes from
[3:23:35.400 --> 3:23:40.960]  Peter Strock to show you how he is he is in a state of absolute denial about
[3:23:40.960 --> 3:23:46.240]  what is going on well no actually no he knows he's just lying he is lying to you
[3:23:46.240 --> 3:23:52.240]  he's lying to America and he has been lying all day and thank God for Traig
[3:23:52.240 --> 3:23:56.920]  Audi up there asking some tough questions and acting like the prosecutor
[3:23:56.920 --> 3:24:01.640]  that he has been in the past it's time to get tough people it's time to realize
[3:24:01.640 --> 3:24:06.520]  the war is here there is a war for America and if you don't wake up and
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:10.880]  realize that we're fighting a war right now a war to exist in the online space
[3:24:10.880 --> 3:24:17.440]  a war for free speech a war to protect America's borders a war for the basic
[3:24:17.440 --> 3:24:22.360]  rules of law and order because the radical left today wants absolute lawlessness
[3:24:22.360 --> 3:24:26.320]  all across America it's not just sanctuary cities it's not just the
[3:24:26.320 --> 3:24:29.760]  open borders they want to shut down all the prisons and release the violent
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:32.760]  prisoners into the streets of America and probably shut down the police as
[3:24:32.760 --> 3:24:38.360]  well I'll get to that there's more coming here's the next question for Peter
[3:24:38.360 --> 3:24:42.640]  Strock did you sign off on the review of the more than 300,000 emails found on
[3:24:42.640 --> 3:24:50.120]  Weiner's laptop in less than a week of review I mean who who covered up the
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:55.400]  Weiner laptop emails and question number nine out of that list did you see any
[3:24:55.400 --> 3:25:01.680]  evidence of crimes against children in these emails because the inspector general
[3:25:01.680 --> 3:25:06.200]  notes that there were such emails found you know what it seems to me and this is
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:10.880]  this is just an educated guess but I'm willing to bet you that Peter Strock is
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:18.320]  involved in the cover-up of evidence of serious crimes against children evidence
[3:25:18.320 --> 3:25:25.120]  that was held by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin and was probably very well known
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:28.440]  by Hillary Clinton herself now that's just conjecture I don't have proof of
[3:25:28.440 --> 3:25:33.320]  that but you got to start connecting the dots here and realize that there is a
[3:25:33.320 --> 3:25:38.320]  cover-up that is so deep that is so egregious that is so maliciously
[3:25:38.320 --> 3:25:46.520]  anti-American how did we the people how did we allow the FBI under James Comey
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:51.200]  and people like Peter Strock how do we allow the FBI to become a weapon against
[3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:56.200]  this constitutional republic how did this happen and for God's sake how does
[3:25:56.200 --> 3:26:00.840]  Jeff Sessions still sit there and allow this to happen and I know you're
[3:26:00.840 --> 3:26:03.880]  listening to this and in your own mind you might have answers to that you might
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:06.760]  think well Jeff Sessions is a traitor Jeff Sessions has been compromised
[3:26:06.760 --> 3:26:10.760]  honestly we don't know the answer to that yet maybe he'll come around maybe
[3:26:10.760 --> 3:26:16.640]  Trump will fire him and get someone in there like Andrew Napolitano who will
[3:26:16.640 --> 3:26:21.280]  actually assert the law as it is supposed to be done in this country but
[3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:25.440]  but there you go ten big questions that need to be asked I didn't I didn't cover
[3:26:25.440 --> 3:26:29.640]  all ten but let's go to Peter Strock's quotes some of these came out of
[3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:35.160]  testimony today he denies that he's biased against President Trump I mean
[3:26:35.160 --> 3:26:38.400]  even though this is the guy who was caught think about it he was caught
[3:26:38.400 --> 3:26:48.840]  texting Lisa Page and saying that we will stop him wait a minute yeah Peter
[3:26:48.840 --> 3:26:52.280]  Strock wasn't he the one who said that that we will stop him when when Lisa Page
[3:26:52.280 --> 3:26:56.040]  was saying oh my god he's not gonna be president is he is he I mean I'm
[3:26:56.040 --> 3:27:02.160]  paraphrasing and I believe his answer was we will stop him now or we will stop
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:06.200]  them there it was similar I'm paraphrasing is very similar to that who is
[3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:11.960]  the we who is this we that he is talking about what's obvious the we is the
[3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:21.240]  corrupt FBI the we is the corrupt leadership that had already decided to
[3:27:21.240 --> 3:27:26.360]  overthrow the presidency of the United States to overthrow the will of the
[3:27:26.360 --> 3:27:32.920]  voters to interfere with the election they tried this before the election they
[3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:38.720]  had injected spies into the Trump campaign before the election they tried
[3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:44.280]  to create a pretext for seeking a FISA warrant they lied to the judge that
[3:27:44.280 --> 3:27:48.120]  signed off on the FISA warrant they covered their tracks every step of the
[3:27:48.120 --> 3:27:52.920]  way and then they went back after Trump got elected they went back and tried to
[3:27:52.920 --> 3:27:58.600]  create more pretext documentation to justify their actions in a blatant
[3:27:58.600 --> 3:28:01.840]  attempt to try to say that they weren't committing treason that they weren't
[3:28:01.840 --> 3:28:05.880]  interfering with the election and then they blamed it all on Russia so
[3:28:05.880 --> 3:28:09.920]  everything that that Peter Strock was doing and James Comey was doing and
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:15.280]  others you know James Clapper Andrew McCabe it's a long list right the
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:19.920]  Retta Lynch it's a big list all the things that they were doing to actively
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:25.560]  interfere with the election in the United States they blamed Russia for doing
[3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:29.920]  and they just made it up and the fake news media ran with that narrative hook
[3:28:29.920 --> 3:28:35.840]  line and sinker and they've been lying about it ever since to this day this has
[3:28:35.840 --> 3:28:39.200]  not been resolved and I don't know about you but I'm about fed up with it
[3:28:39.200 --> 3:28:43.280]  it's time to arrest these deep state traders charge them with the crimes
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:47.360]  they've committed and take our country back it's time stay with me we'll be

[3:36:08.120 --> 3:36:14.680]  the idea of liberty and freedom is spreading and we have a fighting chance
[3:36:14.680 --> 3:36:19.280]  see this is a good news people we have a fighting chance to actually save this
[3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:23.400]  republic with President Trump in the White House thank God that Hillary
[3:36:23.400 --> 3:36:27.800]  Clinton didn't win that election or can you imagine if we didn't have Neil
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:32.040]  Gorsuch there on the court if Hillary Clinton had named that justice if
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:36.800]  Hillary Clinton had named a second one instead of Brett Kavanaugh I mean can
[3:36:36.800 --> 3:36:42.520]  you imagine the destruction of our Constitution and our liberties I mean the
[3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:47.560]  border would be obliterated already there would be a flood of invading foreign
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:51.280]  nationals just flooding and occupying and taking over our country and Hillary
[3:36:51.280 --> 3:36:55.720]  Clinton would say that that's humanitarian that that's equality while
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:36:59.760]  your country is just flushed down the toilet and turned into a third world
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:05.000]  crap hole as so many of these countries have gone when socialists and radical
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:10.040]  communists are in charge so count your blessings today people count your
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:15.280]  blessings Trump is in the White House info wars is here we are building
[3:37:15.280 --> 3:37:21.960]  platforms we still can express our ideas rooted in reason and logic and
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:28.920]  history and fundamental freedoms we have not become Venezuela not yet got to
[3:37:28.920 --> 3:37:33.360]  keep Alexandria Ocasio Cortez out of the White House you know she's not gonna
[3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:37.200]  have a chance there she would turn America into Venezuela but that has not
[3:37:37.200 --> 3:37:42.280]  happened so count your blessings people because we have a fighting chance and as
[3:37:42.280 --> 3:37:46.680]  long as you support this organization and you support the sharing of
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:51.200]  information we have a fighting chance to take our country back and keep it alive
[3:37:51.200 --> 3:37:55.800]  as a constitutional republic don't forget the new info wars app at info
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:38:01.880]  wars.com slash app it's a brand new app for your mobile devices much improved you
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:06.120]  will never miss another story another video another announcement and you know
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:09.120]  why this app is so important folks I mean I've said the same thing to my own
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:14.080]  audience info wars is being systematically censored at every
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:20.640]  level down ranked by Google through a voodoo algorithm black box okay info
[3:38:20.640 --> 3:38:25.640]  wars is being down ranked by YouTube by Facebook the censorship is full force
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:30.600]  but if you get the app you're bypassing the censorship you see the app is your
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:35.560]  ticket to freedom of information it's your ticket to bypass the sensors don't
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:42.160]  sit around and let Google spoon feed you your news of the day for that matter I
[3:38:42.160 --> 3:38:45.640]  mean don't even let Reddit determine your news of the I mean nothing against
[3:38:45.640 --> 3:38:49.680]  Reddit I'm just saying don't go to Facebook and have a Facebook feed
[3:38:49.680 --> 3:38:54.240]  determine what you are reading that day don't let any centralized source of
[3:38:54.240 --> 3:39:00.960]  information spoon feed you some twisted distorted view of reality get the real
[3:39:00.960 --> 3:39:07.160]  news tomorrow's news today by getting the apps for your favorite publishers you

[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:20.880]  you that's the only way to bypass censorship and it matters so much it's
[3:39:20.880 --> 3:39:24.040]  it's absolutely crucial that you function in this way because the
[3:39:24.040 --> 3:39:29.560]  censorship is full-on now let's go to this you heard about this 91 year old
[3:39:29.560 --> 3:39:38.560]  Mexican-American who was beaten brutally attacked by a person with a brick by a
[3:39:38.560 --> 3:39:43.520]  woman who allegedly conducted the attack and yelled go back to your country
[3:39:43.520 --> 3:39:48.400]  the Washington Post demonstrating their fake news yet again the Washington
[3:39:48.400 --> 3:39:54.520]  Post refused to identify the race of the attacker turns out that that woman is
[3:39:54.520 --> 3:40:01.520]  an African-American woman so that this story doesn't fit the narrative that the
[3:40:01.520 --> 3:40:06.320]  Washington Post is trying to imply the Washington Post is a fake news rag they
[3:40:06.320 --> 3:40:11.560]  fabricate fake sources they they they are not anything that resembles
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:16.080]  journalism anymore this is another example of it so they tried to say they
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:21.360]  tried to imply that this was like some racist Trump supporter who hates
[3:40:21.360 --> 3:40:27.000]  immigrants attacking and beating and and screaming at a Mexican-American that's
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:31.680]  not at all what happened and of course the Washington Post left that out of the
[3:40:31.680 --> 3:40:35.400]  entire thing and now also today there's a there's a video that has come out we
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:41.560]  can't even play the audio but ICE ICE employees ICE agents in Portland Oregon
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:47.000]  are under attack today under vicious attack and there's a black ICE agent an
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:52.520]  African-American working for ICE who is being viciously attacked and this story
[3:40:52.520 --> 3:40:58.520]  is also on the Gateway pundit and this person is being called an f-ing n-word by
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:04.600]  the left-wing protesters an f-ing n-word the this this attack against an
[3:41:04.600 --> 3:41:09.400]  African-American ICE agent slash employee slash officer I don't know what
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:15.160]  terminology you you prefer but the fact that if that a black man who is working
[3:41:15.160 --> 3:41:21.360]  to secure the borders of America that he is attacked with racial slurs with
[3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:27.000]  profanity and racial slurs by these left-wing extremists who by the way
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:31.240]  antifa is a domestic terrorism group right that's obvious at this point I'm
[3:41:31.240 --> 3:41:34.640]  gonna talk about antifa here in a second but the fact that this this black
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:39.440]  man cannot even have a job defending his own nation's borders without being
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:45.480]  called the n-word how insane has the left become now where to them if you're
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:49.560]  black and you wear the uniform of the United States government you are now
[3:41:49.560 --> 3:41:55.280]  an n-word to them that is how racist they have become this remember these are
[3:41:55.280 --> 3:41:59.760]  the people who say that Trump is racist these are the people who say that Trump
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:03.560]  supporters are racist and in fact they say everybody's a racist except them but
[3:42:03.560 --> 3:42:08.400]  they're the ones using the n-word slurs aren't they they're the ones who are
[3:42:08.400 --> 3:42:12.120]  hating not on black people not just on black people but also they hate white
[3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:17.280]  people they hate men they hate heterosexuals they hate Trump supporters
[3:42:17.280 --> 3:42:22.360]  they hate patriots they hate veterans they hate cops is there anybody they
[3:42:22.360 --> 3:42:28.280]  don't hate they hate Kavanaugh they hate every decent person who is trying to do
[3:42:28.280 --> 3:42:33.880]  their job and protect this country against an invasion that the left wants
[3:42:33.880 --> 3:42:38.400]  to see happen in America and that's why we must stop their efforts and that's
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:42.160]  why we need your support stay tuned in here on info wars comm this is Mike
[3:42:42.160 --> 3:42:47.440]  Adams we'll be right back after this break with more news
[3:42:52.560 --> 3:42:57.360]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[3:42:57.360 --> 3:43:01.640]  drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[3:43:01.640 --> 3:43:06.040]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[3:43:06.040 --> 3:43:11.520]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:16.520]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:22.120]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[3:43:22.120 --> 3:43:27.240]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[3:43:27.240 --> 3:43:31.560]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:36.960]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[3:43:36.960 --> 3:43:42.800]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[3:43:42.800 --> 3:43:47.040]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[3:43:47.040 --> 3:43:53.360]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it in

[3:47:41.240 --> 3:47:46.400]  I got to say I there's a lot of really important information in that broadcast
[3:47:46.400 --> 3:47:51.720]  and counterthink airs every 6 p.m. central at info wars dot com by the way so
[3:47:51.720 --> 3:47:56.720]  so check it out I got a lot of great episodes coming up but but for for right
[3:47:56.720 --> 3:48:00.680]  now there's some big news this week about Monsanto which of course has been
[3:48:00.680 --> 3:48:05.760]  acquired by Bayer essentially Monsanto is about to get flooded with thousands of
[3:48:05.760 --> 3:48:10.240]  cancer lawsuits this is a Fox Business article and what has happened is that
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:14.680]  there's a lawsuit in California where a man who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins
[3:48:14.680 --> 3:48:21.400]  lymphoma a form of cancer is suing Monsanto because he was exposed to
[3:48:21.400 --> 3:48:25.360]  roundup for many years and and he and his lawyers believe that the roundup
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:29.640]  exposure caused his cancer and there is significant scientific evidence that
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:34.480]  supports that case but Monsanto has been you know I call them sort of the big
[3:48:34.480 --> 3:48:39.160]  tobacco of chemical agriculture and they you know until recently when Google
[3:48:39.160 --> 3:48:43.200]  now has become the most evil corporation in the world until then
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:47.560]  Monsanto was the most evil corporation in the world now it's kind of a tie like
[3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:51.360]  who's more evil Google or Monsanto I don't know Monsanto poisons your body
[3:48:51.360 --> 3:48:55.440]  and your food Google poisons your brain and steals your liberty so I mean I
[3:48:55.440 --> 3:49:00.440]  don't know maybe it's a tie they're both incredibly evil but Monsanto is
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:03.960]  getting sued in California and there was a decision in the court that allowed
[3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:10.040]  expert testimony now to proceed that would tie exposure to roundup to non-Hodgkins
[3:49:10.040 --> 3:49:14.800]  lymphoma now if this court case I mean even now it's going to open the flood
[3:49:14.800 --> 3:49:18.400]  gates to potentially thousands of lawsuits across the country this is
[3:49:18.400 --> 3:49:22.400]  starting to look a lot like big tobacco and it turns out that Monsanto
[3:49:22.400 --> 3:49:27.640]  intimidated and threatened scientists paid off regulators Monsanto has been
[3:49:27.640 --> 3:49:31.960]  running online smear campaigns for years against any critics of GMOs or
[3:49:31.960 --> 3:49:36.320]  glyphosate you know I'm I think they spend a million dollars a year just to
[3:49:36.320 --> 3:49:40.960]  target myself and one other person the food babe you know that the Monsanto is
[3:49:40.960 --> 3:49:44.640]  a very very evil corporation and it looks like that they are about to get
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:49.320]  hammered hard thousands of lawsuits could come to the surface and they've
[3:49:49.320 --> 3:49:54.200]  been poisoning people for generations this is a company that that made Agent
[3:49:54.200 --> 3:49:59.160]  Orange and I I think they were involved in DDT and I know they contaminated the
[3:49:59.160 --> 3:50:03.080]  world with PCBs and they buried the evidence and they hid the science so
[3:50:03.080 --> 3:50:08.280]  you know what some of this is coming back on them now and it could just there
[3:50:08.280 --> 3:50:12.720]  could be a tidal wave of lawsuits that could make the Monsanto acquisition by
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:17.400]  Bayer a very very costly acquisition and now getting back to today's news when I
[3:50:17.400 --> 3:50:23.920]  see Peter Strock testifying before Congress and saying saying that he was
[3:50:23.920 --> 3:50:29.880]  not in any way biased it just reminds me of Monsanto of Monsanto saying no
[3:50:29.880 --> 3:50:34.040]  glyphosate doesn't cause cancer no GMOs is nothing wrong with them no the
[3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:37.960]  science is great no those rats with all those tumors that can barely drag
[3:50:37.960 --> 3:50:43.320]  themselves across the table because the lab science rats that were fed GMOs and
[3:50:43.320 --> 3:50:48.680]  and roundup no that don't look there that's that couldn't be real I mean
[3:50:48.680 --> 3:50:53.680]  Monsanto and Peter Strock it's like Peter Strock is the Monsanto of the FBI
[3:50:53.680 --> 3:50:59.440]  he's like he's in total denial about the evil that he has become I mean this was
[3:50:59.440 --> 3:51:04.080]  my opinion this is not an official info wars opinion necessarily this is just my
[3:51:04.080 --> 3:51:08.800]  opinion I think Peter Strock is the Monsanto of the deep state let's let's
[3:51:08.800 --> 3:51:14.280]  put it that way and he's just a liar and he he he continues to deepen the lie
[3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:18.880]  every chance he gets and here's a quote from today he says at no time in any of
[3:51:18.880 --> 3:51:23.320]  these texts did those personal beliefs ever enter into the realm of any action
[3:51:23.320 --> 3:51:29.640]  I took he said I think he was responding to Trey Gowdy he says quote
[3:51:29.640 --> 3:51:33.320]  Strock says the suggestion that I'm in some dark chamber somewhere in the FBI
[3:51:33.320 --> 3:51:37.080]  and would somehow cast aside all of these procedures all of these safeguards and
[3:51:37.080 --> 3:51:42.640]  somehow be able to do this is astounding to me he says I simply it simply
[3:51:42.640 --> 3:51:48.280]  couldn't happen but wait isn't he also the guy who texted with Lisa Page about
[3:51:48.280 --> 3:51:53.760]  having an insurance policy in case Trump won the presidency an insurance policy
[3:51:53.760 --> 3:51:58.800]  and that they were working on that insurance policy and that his behaviors
[3:51:58.800 --> 3:52:03.240]  were clearly biased by any standard of logic and reason remember when Bill
[3:52:03.240 --> 3:52:06.880]  Clinton said you know he answered a question was like well that depends on
[3:52:06.880 --> 3:52:12.160]  what the definition of is is right that's the way Peter Strock is starting to
[3:52:12.160 --> 3:52:16.800]  talk now well it depends on you know it is it is my belief that I could not
[3:52:16.800 --> 3:52:20.640]  possibly have been biased in any of these decisions that simply couldn't
[3:52:20.640 --> 3:52:25.480]  happen I guess Peter Strock wants us to believe that that he has like a multiple
[3:52:25.480 --> 3:52:30.840]  personality disorder and that when he's texting Lisa Page he's this this fiery
[3:52:30.840 --> 3:52:37.000]  anti-trump personality I don't know Peter Strock a and then when he goes to
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:42.200]  work at the FBI he's Peter Strock B the reasonable rational person who follows
[3:52:42.200 --> 3:52:46.640]  all the rules perfectly and loves his country and never does anything wrong but
[3:52:46.640 --> 3:52:52.880]  then when he goes home and he's texting his mistress and and then the evil
[3:52:52.880 --> 3:52:57.960]  Peter Strock a comes out and he's like we need an insurance plan stop Trump
[3:52:57.960 --> 3:53:01.800]  we'll stop him and who knows what else he texted that hasn't been released by
[3:53:01.800 --> 3:53:07.360]  the way probably texts like you know try to find somebody to to execute Trump or
[3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:11.000]  something along those lines who knows but are we really to believe that this
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:15.920]  guy has a multiple personality disorder where he doesn't have this this this
[3:53:15.920 --> 3:53:19.880]  hatred in his consciousness when he is applying these decisions and procedures
[3:53:19.880 --> 3:53:25.920]  at the FBI and by the way you know what Peter Strock you're an employee of the
[3:53:25.920 --> 3:53:31.560]  American taxpayer you better answer the questions and a Trey Gowdy and others
[3:53:31.560 --> 3:53:36.560]  Jim Jordan many others are right to put all of you in handcuffs and drag you
[3:53:36.560 --> 3:53:41.080]  before the United States Congress and make you answer these questions or if
[3:53:41.080 --> 3:53:44.880]  you complete the fifth you have that constitutional right you complete the
[3:53:44.880 --> 3:53:50.600]  fifth but if we could ever wake up Jeff Sessions out of his coma the DOJ also
[3:53:50.600 --> 3:53:55.320]  has the right to charge you with treason or sedition or whatever is the
[3:53:55.320 --> 3:53:58.860]  appropriate crime obstruction obstruction of justice destruction of
[3:53:58.860 --> 3:54:04.440]  evidence whatever is appropriate so never forget that we are watching and we
[3:54:04.440 --> 3:54:09.280]  are waiting for justice real justice to be served now as that has happened in
[3:54:09.280 --> 3:54:13.520]  a couple more quick things a daily call of reporting pressure is building on
[3:54:13.520 --> 3:54:18.000]  Democrats to drive off the immigration cliff that refers to this new strategy
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:23.120]  of Democrats which is to become as radical extremists as you can and to
[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:27.840]  say that ice has to be abolished no borders no border control whatever
[3:54:27.840 --> 3:54:32.120]  anybody that shows up they should all just be invited in come on in have a
[3:54:32.120 --> 3:54:35.960]  tidal wave of immigrants no matter if they're carrying you know tuberculosis
[3:54:35.960 --> 3:54:43.240]  or weird retro viral diseases or they're they're trafficking in children or
[3:54:43.240 --> 3:54:46.360]  bringing in murderers and rapists people who are fleeing their own countries
[3:54:46.360 --> 3:54:49.880]  because they're wanted by the authorities there I guess the left wants
[3:54:49.880 --> 3:54:54.320]  all those people in America because they want they want absolute chaos in
[3:54:54.320 --> 3:54:58.400]  society the problem is that middle America doesn't want that I mean the
[3:54:58.400 --> 3:55:03.320]  problem for the Democrats middle America wants a peaceful law abiding society
[3:55:03.320 --> 3:55:07.880]  middle America is opposed to sanctuary cities middle America I mean just
[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:13.000]  reasonable normal people don't want their country overrun with illegals and
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:18.120]  violent alien criminals normal people don't want sanctuary city policies that
[3:55:18.120 --> 3:55:24.200]  protect criminals and it's coming to the point where you look at the mayors of
[3:55:24.200 --> 3:55:28.320]  cities like Portland or Oakland where you look at you know the city council of
[3:55:28.320 --> 3:55:32.840]  Portland seems to be at war with federal immigration policy they try to issue
[3:55:32.840 --> 3:55:39.120]  citations against ICE for having a fence I mean it's unreal these these states
[3:55:39.120 --> 3:55:43.400]  and these specific leaders you know mayors and city council members and
[3:55:43.400 --> 3:55:48.840]  so on if are they really gonna say that they're on the side of Antifa are they
[3:55:48.840 --> 3:55:52.360]  really going to become complicit with terrorists because if that's the
[3:55:52.360 --> 3:55:56.680]  direction they're going then there's going to be a round of you know
[3:55:56.680 --> 3:55:59.560]  investigations I'll I'll just put it that way and some of these people are
[3:55:59.560 --> 3:56:03.360]  going to find themselves you know probably behind bars at some point
[3:56:03.360 --> 3:56:08.360]  through the legal process we just got a couple minutes left here let me leave
[3:56:08.360 --> 3:56:14.080]  you with this I've got an upcoming episode of counterthink called 10
[3:56:14.080 --> 3:56:19.280]  reasons that we can never let the left gain power over us I haven't recorded it
[3:56:19.280 --> 3:56:23.360]  yet I'm going to shortly but I've got the list here I just want to cover a
[3:56:23.360 --> 3:56:28.040]  couple of these before I let you go today that's very important number 10 on
[3:56:28.040 --> 3:56:33.680]  this list is that leftists refuse to coexist in a civil society yeah there's
[3:56:33.680 --> 3:56:37.880]  the whole list right there there's my show they refuse to coexist in a civil
[3:56:37.880 --> 3:56:45.360]  society they do not respect the law they want lawlessness they want chaos they
[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:49.880]  will not comply with the outcome of an election unless they win that election
[3:56:49.880 --> 3:56:53.800]  and they want to try to change the rules twist the rules bend the rules they
[3:56:53.800 --> 3:56:57.560]  want to fight dirty now they want to stack the courts now they want to boost
[3:56:57.560 --> 3:57:01.880]  the Supreme Court to 12 justices so they can do plus three liberals you know
[3:57:01.880 --> 3:57:05.960]  they want to change the rules they are willing to do anything to gain back
[3:57:05.960 --> 3:57:10.560]  power in this country they have lost their minds and we must defeat them at
