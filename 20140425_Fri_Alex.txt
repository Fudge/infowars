[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:30.160]  well the rest of situation just went from orange to red it is now in my mind at a
[00:30.160 --> 00:34.280]  critical juncture I want to get Ray McGovern former CIA analyst on very
[00:34.280 --> 00:38.720]  soon to talk about this I want to get Colonel Schaefer on to give us his take
[00:38.720 --> 00:44.200]  on it but quite frankly I've been studying it very deeply and we've been
[00:44.200 --> 00:48.480]  predicting where this would go and unfortunately it's going that direction
[00:48.480 --> 00:54.400]  because the globalist want it to go in that direction and it's a very serious
[00:54.400 --> 01:01.080]  situation to say the least we're going to be breaking that down today Ukrainian
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.040]  helicopter hit by grenade taking off Ukraine helicopter has been crippled in
[01:06.040 --> 01:10.680]  a grenade attack in Kiev warrants Moscow is engineering a third world war
[01:10.680 --> 01:16.840]  that's the one telegraph headline did you hear that third world war that is the
[01:16.840 --> 01:20.040]  Ukraine foreign minister that's saying that by the way and also their vice
[01:20.040 --> 01:25.640]  el presidente Ukraine foreign minister ready to fight Russia is the headline
[01:25.640 --> 01:31.920]  from the Associated Press Kerry warns Russia of expensive new sanctions
[01:31.920 --> 01:39.520]  Putin warns of consequences as Ukraine steps up offensive Russia wants to start
[01:39.520 --> 01:45.400]  world war three Ukrainian prime minister that's in CNBC I mean I'm reading
[01:45.400 --> 01:48.480]  mainline headlines here remember I told you a month ago this could turn into
[01:48.480 --> 01:53.920]  world war three oh Alex don't be a fearmonger what do the ICBMs have to
[01:53.920 --> 01:58.120]  come into orbit back into orbit or back into the atmosphere and then come in and
[01:58.120 --> 02:04.240]  detonate over cities and airburst for us to be concerned how traders can prepare
[02:04.240 --> 02:12.640]  for a worsening Ukraine crisis CNBC Russia now downgraded by SNP proposes
[02:12.640 --> 02:17.640]  scorched earth retaliation against NATO countries economically Pentagon Russian
[02:17.640 --> 02:24.400]  spy ship tug operating near US more big bear nuke bombers caught trying to go
[02:24.400 --> 02:29.560]  into British and European airspace I mean this is bad and it's what you expect
[02:29.560 --> 02:33.600]  when the globalist want to bring in a new global crisis so that we're all
[02:33.600 --> 02:41.960]  distracted by their activities and it is thoroughly disgusting but this is
[02:41.960 --> 02:49.320]  happening the West went in three months ago when Ukraine voted to not join with
[02:49.320 --> 02:55.760]  the EU and to be sucked by that spider and instead tried to save someone
[02:55.760 --> 03:00.800]  neutral I don't want Ukraine sucked by the Russian spider or the globalist
[03:00.800 --> 03:04.840]  spider but the globalist spider is about let's be not exaggerate about 10 times
[03:04.840 --> 03:11.920]  bigger fatter older more evil and more anti-human I mean the Russian spider is
[03:11.920 --> 03:16.320]  just happy to be in power and control of its own population is trying to breed
[03:16.320 --> 03:21.000]  a larger Ruski population because it realizes that its own system is
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.800]  collapsing the globalist spider is a transhumanist power tripping spider that
[03:26.800 --> 03:33.360]  believes it's God that is attacking anything decent so that's what we're
[03:33.360 --> 03:37.320]  dealing with here and I mean this is a big deal I've got masses of incredible
[03:37.320 --> 03:44.040]  news here and I don't know how I even get into the other news on the stock
[03:44.040 --> 03:49.120]  market and the police state and attacks on internet freedom which we will cover
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.280]  while we've got this Ukraine situation going on but really we've stated the
[03:53.280 --> 03:58.400]  facts the facts are there and it's deteriorating very quickly when we come
[03:58.400 --> 04:07.920]  back I'm gonna try to very calmly walk through the scenario so far and then
[04:07.920 --> 04:11.840]  where the scenario will go in the future or could go in the future and it's
[04:11.840 --> 04:19.800]  going the very worst way so that is all coming up today but we've always known
[04:19.800 --> 04:22.640]  that a large global war is what's supposed to bring in the final world
[04:22.640 --> 04:26.400]  government that's what the globalists have said themselves and now it looks
[04:26.400 --> 04:29.760]  like they're trying to do it they may have some back room deal with Putin and
[04:29.760 --> 04:38.840]  this may be staged my gut tells me it's not and that we're in a world of hurt
[04:40.040 --> 04:46.000]  it's truly out of control the globalist aren't gonna let their system collapse
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  without starting a world war they're gonna double down every time they're in a
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.640]  corner we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen straight ahead big Bundy news
[04:55.640 --> 05:02.000]  as well it's all coming up today why does the United States spend the largest

[09:10.160 --> 09:14.680]  help the government with potentially their biggest problem us so part of it
[09:14.680 --> 09:18.080]  is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their
[09:18.080 --> 09:21.520]  parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole
[09:21.520 --> 09:26.920]  communities if you got a business that you didn't build that somebody else made

[10:45.080 --> 10:59.360]  Alex Jones
[10:59.360 --> 11:14.720]  thank you president Eisenhower for warning us of the dangerous rise of
[11:14.720 --> 11:18.920]  the military industrial complex and later in the speech controlled by a
[11:18.920 --> 11:24.800]  technological elite that is what we're facing is a technocracy in the
[11:24.800 --> 11:29.080]  Bilderberg and Davos groups own words I am your host Alex Jones is someone who
[11:29.080 --> 11:34.680]  wants freedom who's upset and angry but also focused and mobilized in the face
[11:34.680 --> 11:39.600]  of this tyranny and we have reached out to you you have reached out to us we've
[11:39.600 --> 11:42.960]  reached out to millions of others across the world and we're having a real
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.120]  effect that's why we're being attacked by all the White House mouthpieces the
[11:47.120 --> 11:52.720]  globalist mouthpieces and collaborators in the so-called Liberty movement
[11:52.720 --> 11:56.760]  Benedict Arnold to try to bring us down and we are being prepared to be set up
[11:56.760 --> 12:01.680]  right now that is clear that they don't like the message we're putting out in
[12:01.680 --> 12:05.040]  the fact that it's resonating and being duplicated and being augmented and
[12:05.040 --> 12:09.560]  expanded and so there's going to be some more demonization campaigns out there
[12:09.560 --> 12:13.240]  now I'm going to get into the off-the-chart news in Russia off the
[12:13.240 --> 12:19.880]  chart news on the tack on free speech coming up in a moment David Knight has
[12:19.880 --> 12:24.200]  been down here for over a year one of our great reporters and co-host of this
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.840]  radio show and also the nightly news it's very hard to get a house here buy a
[12:29.840 --> 12:33.600]  house here because it has the biggest housing shortage in the country Austin is
[12:33.600 --> 12:39.240]  the major boom city nationwide as people escape California and other areas
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.200]  destroyed by big government and they come here and vote to take our freedom but
[12:44.200 --> 12:47.640]  to hopefully folks from North Carolina and Kansas and Tennessee and a lot of
[12:47.640 --> 12:51.880]  other more libertarian areas will offset the socialists that are moving here a
[12:51.880 --> 12:54.760]  lot of good Californians are moving here as well to escape it but a lot of them
[12:54.760 --> 12:58.080]  are coming here to bring in their tyranny but he's been off the last few
[12:58.080 --> 13:04.520]  days moving and I guess out of one apartment into a house while they still
[13:04.520 --> 13:09.280]  try to buy a house and so he's been listening to talk radio he was listening
[13:09.280 --> 13:16.400]  to our local affiliate 590 a.m. last night because his brother-in-law out of
[13:16.400 --> 13:22.040]  North Carolina called him and said you better go listen to Glenn Beck well it
[13:22.040 --> 13:26.720]  re-hears here locally and so he tuned in last night while we'll pack in the U
[13:26.720 --> 13:30.920]  Hall and he said you know we got to go into the Glenn Beck's archive and find
[13:30.920 --> 13:34.960]  it but he said this is this is really bad we have to do something about this and
[13:34.960 --> 13:38.360]  I said what did he say he said well I'll just come in and tell you but he told me
[13:38.360 --> 13:41.480]  over the phone right before broadcast he's driving up here right now to be on
[13:41.480 --> 13:46.760]  in the next segment or at the bottom of the hour Beck said that we want violent
[13:46.760 --> 13:53.040]  overthrow of the US government info wars by name and that we tried to cover up
[13:53.040 --> 13:58.320]  the Bundy supposed racist comments and that we were there and that basically
[13:58.320 --> 14:04.840]  that was our video or that we knew and try to cover it up our people were there
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.640]  a week and a half ago this was said last weekend none of my reporters were
[14:08.640 --> 14:12.960]  there we covered it yesterday when we saw it in the morning when it had been
[14:12.960 --> 14:18.240]  out less than 12 hours we got Bundy on and I said the way they edited his
[14:18.240 --> 14:21.880]  comments I think sounded you know very offensive and racist but that I understood
[14:21.880 --> 14:24.960]  where he was coming from and he said no I meant they've traded out one form of
[14:24.960 --> 14:30.720]  slavery for the other but to input but to basically say we're racist and we
[14:30.720 --> 14:34.000]  want violence I mean Beck there's a reason you're getting sued right now
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.240]  okay and I don't think you're gonna win and I don't intend anything like that
[14:39.240 --> 14:43.240]  but look what you're doing is torturous interference I know you're obsessed
[14:43.240 --> 14:47.480]  with my show I know you watch it for years and take our guests and spend it I
[14:47.480 --> 14:53.560]  don't care that's fine I just want to defeat tyranny but what I'm trying to
[14:53.560 --> 15:01.480]  get at here is that he's putting out the exact talking points of media matters
[15:01.480 --> 15:06.500]  that on record is the White House is the White House direct conduit from the
[15:06.500 --> 15:12.120]  White House telling them what to do and say MSNBC CNN I understand saying I'm
[15:12.120 --> 15:15.840]  behind the boss in bombing and I'm deeply racist and you know all the rest of
[15:15.840 --> 15:25.760]  it but to have Glenn Beck doing it and I know what this is he knows we're getting
[15:25.760 --> 15:29.240]  on a Philly it's all over the country the show is exploding right now most of
[15:29.240 --> 15:33.120]  stations were on Kerry Glenn Beck and he knows because I've talked to some
[15:33.120 --> 15:38.760]  program directors that there's little comments and things going on from the
[15:38.760 --> 15:44.640]  people in his office not even a syndicator premiere about me and how
[15:44.640 --> 15:50.160]  I'm a bad show to have and this has been going on behind the scenes and then a
[15:50.160 --> 15:54.160]  lot of times I'm on live and Glenn Beck's on at night he doesn't like that
[15:54.160 --> 16:00.300]  he's an egomaniac my show ends up getting picked up on Sunday live while we do
[16:00.300 --> 16:03.360]  that show people get a taste of it then they put us on at night and then
[16:03.360 --> 16:08.120]  invariably we end up going on live and and I mean they literally replace rush
[16:08.120 --> 16:11.440]  lumball with us in areas of the country and get better ratings and I'm not I
[16:11.440 --> 16:15.440]  never had this slot to go up against rush lumball I didn't want this slot I had
[16:15.440 --> 16:20.960]  a nighttime show that GCN made me 17 years ago changed to a daytime slot and
[16:20.960 --> 16:24.400]  I said I think it's a horrible idea I don't want to go up against rush lumball
[16:24.400 --> 16:27.680]  I need to go out for stations at night there's no way stations are gonna dump
[16:27.680 --> 16:32.480]  limbaugh for me and they said you're so good his name was Michael Trudeau and
[16:32.480 --> 16:35.680]  Ted Anderson still runs the network but Michael Trudeau was like I'm gonna put
[16:35.680 --> 16:38.880]  Sean up against him you're gonna take over well I guess he was about 15 years
[16:38.880 --> 16:46.440]  you know early on that but the point is that I I want rush lumball to be on
[16:46.440 --> 16:49.320]  every TV station in the country because his ideas are a lot better than what the
[16:49.320 --> 16:53.640]  control left puts out I want Glenn back to have 50 million listeners I want Glenn
[16:53.640 --> 16:57.040]  back to sell 100 million books I want Glenn back to have long days pleasant
[16:57.040 --> 17:05.520]  nights because I agree with most of what he has to say but man you know it's a
[17:05.520 --> 17:10.160]  big deal when somebody says you're a racist with no proof it's big deal when
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.840]  they say that that you want to overthrow the US government and have
[17:13.840 --> 17:17.240]  violence to you know five six seven eight million people a day I mean that
[17:17.240 --> 17:22.200]  that's really meant to hurt me I mean I don't care when MSNBC says it with half
[17:22.200 --> 17:26.120]  a million viewers and people know they're a pack of liars that's a big deal
[17:26.120 --> 17:30.000]  when Glenn back does that to me and I don't know what he thinks I'm gonna do
[17:30.000 --> 17:40.800]  I mean I I'm not gonna take that line down so I just we've got such bigger
[17:40.800 --> 17:44.920]  issues with Russia huge issues with Obama trying to get the guns trying to
[17:44.920 --> 17:48.960]  bust the borders overrunning the Constitution that I'll probably just
[17:48.960 --> 17:53.160]  let him walk all over me but at a certain level man when people don't want
[17:53.160 --> 17:57.160]  you to be on the air and they want to get you off stations and they'll lie
[17:57.160 --> 18:02.960]  about you to do it and I'm not even in competition with him and Rush Limbaugh
[18:02.960 --> 18:07.080]  has done nothing bad to me he's he said snide things about me a few times when
[18:07.080 --> 18:09.840]  he didn't agree with something somebody wrote on my website and that's fine I
[18:09.840 --> 18:12.600]  don't agree with everything on there but a lot of times he covers our story
[18:12.600 --> 18:15.840]  doesn't really give us credit but I know from behind the scenes some folks that
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.120]  play golf with him that he actually agrees with us more than he disagrees and
[18:19.120 --> 18:23.080]  listens to the show sometimes Limbaugh we're in competition with Rush Limbaugh
[18:23.080 --> 18:29.480]  directly up against him and he doesn't do this kind of crap and I mean this is
[18:29.480 --> 18:34.160]  dangerous folks to have somebody on the air saying that you want to overthrow

[18:37.280 --> 18:48.080]  weeks ago so I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this today but yeah I dare

[18:52.960 --> 18:57.880]  I got a family and I've already put myself in the crosshairs and and this
[18:57.880 --> 19:02.480]  is Benedict Arnold type stuff ladies and gentlemen I mean this is textbook

[24:31.320 --> 24:35.320]  a lot of libertarian and conservative talk show hosts are scared and they're going to
[24:35.320 --> 24:39.960]  join with the globalists in the takeover of this country and they're going to demonize
[24:39.960 --> 24:44.040]  anybody who stands up for freedom in the constitution and they're going to salute
[24:44.040 --> 24:48.760]  the black uniforms as i and others like ron paul are hauled off to prison

[25:01.880 --> 25:07.400]  supports land rights or anybody that doesn't want free speech zones or snipers pointing guns
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.280]  at peaceful protesters with tasers and police dogs if you don't like that you're a domestic
[25:12.280 --> 25:18.600]  terrorist you're an insurgent you're an extremist and yes you're a racist if they can find anybody
[25:18.600 --> 25:27.800]  involved who talks in a hillbilly dialect that's how all this propaganda works and a lot of people
[25:27.800 --> 25:32.920]  get scared by it and a lot of republican leadership wants to continue the land grabs they want to
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.720]  continue the bid rigging they want to continue the no bid contracts they want to continue business
[25:37.720 --> 25:44.280]  as usual well business as usual is collapsing this country and we either change course now
[25:45.720 --> 25:52.440]  or we go off the edge into oblivion now i'm going to talk with night briefly about what he
[25:52.440 --> 25:57.560]  heard back say last night and i guess we're going to dig through the the the video and audio files
[25:57.560 --> 26:01.800]  of it yesterday and post it just to document what we're saying but it doesn't matter a lot of you
[26:01.800 --> 26:06.840]  probably heard it uh saying that we want violence and that we're basically covering up the racism
[26:06.840 --> 26:11.400]  of bundy and that we were out there at the ranch two weeks ago when he said all this when we all
[26:11.400 --> 26:16.360]  now know this was taped saturday and would not buy our reporters and of course we reported on it
[26:16.360 --> 26:21.080]  i mean it's one thing to say bundy could be a hillbilly or maybe racist i don't think that's
[26:21.080 --> 26:25.960]  the case he's certainly a fossil though and i think some of the stuff he said could be taken
[26:25.960 --> 26:31.720]  as offensive i mean like i heard black people out here i'll bring one in the house and got
[26:31.720 --> 26:35.880]  them around here i mean it's i mean it's just literally out the middle of nowhere it'd be like
[26:35.880 --> 26:41.560]  i brought a Yankee in here i saw one of them city slicker i mean these are folks in the desert
[26:41.560 --> 26:46.760]  seven generations so uh i mean i think the bundys are good people overall and i think he just says
[26:46.760 --> 26:53.080]  what he's thinking but compared to a boarding 52 black people compared to all the other evil that's
[26:53.080 --> 26:57.960]  going on around here we're letting them change the subject off of what almost became a new tenement
[26:57.960 --> 27:03.880]  square out there in the desert on to a statement by the way we have the unedited statements of
[27:03.880 --> 27:09.320]  clavin bundy up on info wars dot com where he said everything he said about i want to help
[27:09.320 --> 27:14.600]  black folks in the spanish nobody you know i don't want to hear they don't pay taxes and work hard
[27:15.160 --> 27:19.960]  you know it's wrong they need their liberty and we don't need to reverse the changes that were made
[27:19.960 --> 27:25.880]  during the 60s for liberty we don't need to go back and that's what this big government's doing
[27:25.880 --> 27:31.560]  we got the full video up on info wars dot com and the transcript so now i see what he's saying about
[27:31.560 --> 27:35.720]  it being out of context because when i had him on yesterday because we were trying to cover it up you
[27:35.720 --> 27:41.320]  know that's why we're the first to recover and get a response from him the first the first that we
[27:41.320 --> 27:47.160]  know of it was one of the radio show had him on before us that's all in drugs i guess the second
[27:47.160 --> 27:52.440]  the point is within hours of this breaking in the new york times the day it broke we have him on
[27:52.440 --> 27:56.920]  and her and her and her you know sitting there saying we don't agree with the way this had been
[27:56.920 --> 28:04.280]  spun and making sure this wasn't what he really stood for and then we've already got msnbc cnn and
[28:04.280 --> 28:10.280]  glenn beck and media matters and vanity fair saying that i'm with this guy and that i want
[28:10.280 --> 28:18.760]  violent overthrow that's not what bundy wants and then i'm a racist i mean it's just really really
[28:18.760 --> 28:25.800]  creepy to have this type of stuff going on and now it turns out he was telling the truth people go
[28:25.800 --> 28:31.000]  well he did make the cotton picking point yes he was saying that that was not in the context of the
[28:31.000 --> 28:38.360]  quote and now we have the full quote and turns out he was telling the truth so now that you see it
[28:38.360 --> 28:45.480]  in full context clearly this is like my great-grandfathers i talked to my parents about this last
[28:45.480 --> 28:49.720]  night did not talk like this but i've always run into hillbilly's in the middle of nowhere
[28:49.720 --> 28:58.920]  that do talk like this and they're actually not racist they are literally out of the time machine
[29:00.040 --> 29:03.720]  but there's bad things if you go back in a time machine there's also good things
[29:03.720 --> 29:07.720]  they're saying note of the feds and note of the end of it square because they're so old-fashioned
[29:08.280 --> 29:12.760]  that's the good part of their old-fashionedness is to be straight shooting and to stand up against
[29:12.760 --> 29:19.080]  tyranny but then it's like talking to somebody who got off a time machine from 150 years ago
[29:19.080 --> 29:24.920]  it sounds really weird to modern trendies and metrosexuals and everybody else and quite frankly
[29:24.920 --> 29:34.040]  myself included because he's such a straight shooter and tells you exactly what he's thinking
[29:34.040 --> 29:38.680]  no political correctness but wouldn't you rather that than the new religion of political correctness
[29:38.680 --> 29:43.800]  now we come back the really big news that this is distracting from this bunny thing's becoming
[29:43.800 --> 29:49.480]  like the malaysian airliner russia wants to start world war three ukrainian prime minister

[34:54.520 --> 35:00.680]  this to its children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to its dissidents that
[35:00.680 --> 35:06.360]  kind of society will also eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the
[35:06.360 --> 35:12.520]  quizzlings and the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a suicide cult
[35:13.080 --> 35:20.280]  the scoops are on their way the scoops are on their way i repeat the scoops are on their way

[36:16.680 --> 36:24.760]  to generate electricity for the state and now the state is saying that they're going to halt that
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.480]  origan county put stopped incinerating aborted babies for electricity
[36:30.040 --> 36:35.560]  quote we are outraged they even know that was going on uh and meanwhile speaking of origan
[36:36.920 --> 36:42.760]  cover origan health exchange website to shut down i mean that's how fraudulent uh all of this
[36:42.760 --> 36:50.200]  garbage is via obama care now here's the big news today and it ties in to the attack on free
[36:50.200 --> 36:56.360]  speech as well there's just a war on every front and a bunch of key economic news this news is so
[36:56.360 --> 37:03.080]  big that quite frankly i shouldn't cover anything but this but what i'm going to do is
[37:03.080 --> 37:13.480]  is at the start of the next hour i will focus as professionally as i can and muster all of my
[37:15.800 --> 37:24.920]  oratory skills and try to break down what's happened in ukraine and where i believe it's
[37:24.920 --> 37:29.240]  going now you know so far i've predicted what was going to happen and it's starting to happen
[37:29.240 --> 37:36.680]  it's not hard to predict this is the globalist plan so i'm i'm really looking at what they're
[37:36.680 --> 37:42.040]  doing what they've done in the past and their programs of destabilization and so it's not
[37:42.040 --> 37:50.840]  really even predicting except this is russia and the outcomes are so horrible that i can't
[37:50.840 --> 37:58.040]  believe this is happening and if i was a coward or even if i had more self-preservation in states
[37:58.040 --> 38:03.240]  i would be getting my family out of the united states right now and i'm not saying that that
[38:03.240 --> 38:07.080]  means we're going to have a nuclear war but if there was say a 10 chance that there was going
[38:07.080 --> 38:13.080]  to be a nuclear war would you get your family out of major target sites like the middle of texas
[38:14.120 --> 38:19.000]  or if there was a 10 chance robbers were coming to kill you would you get out of your house that
[38:19.000 --> 38:26.440]  night i'd say there's a 10 chance probably higher that we're going to have a full out nuclear war
[38:26.440 --> 38:31.800]  and people have heard my show for 19 years some of you've been listening that long in austin
[38:32.680 --> 38:39.480]  been syndicated for almost 18 you know i've never talked like that usually nuclear war threats
[38:40.120 --> 38:45.480]  are just stuff the government uses to hype this is a really bad situation it's so horrible
[38:46.360 --> 38:53.000]  that it's beyond having a a a nasty feeling in my in my mind and in my chest in my stomach
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.040]  it's more just a feeling of unbelief disbelief let me let me just read you these headlines okay and
[38:58.040 --> 39:02.280]  then i'm going to get to this at the start of the next hour russia wants to start world war three

[40:03.960 --> 40:11.240]  cruise missiles folks so the russians have moved cruise missiles into the coast they don't need
[40:11.240 --> 40:18.040]  cuba anymore thanks a lot new world order how traders are preparing for a worsening ukraine
[40:18.040 --> 40:24.760]  crisis cnbc we have the twin dangers of the ukraine crisis an article by newt gendrich that
[40:24.760 --> 40:29.880]  basically tells the truth other than demonizing russia to admit she caused world war three that's
[40:29.880 --> 40:39.320]  cnn okay what's the issue here this was triggered when ukraine didn't vote three and a half months
[40:39.320 --> 40:48.920]  ago to go under e you spin a rats and be rolled up and put in the web to be sucked dry they they
[40:48.920 --> 40:53.400]  didn't want to jump in the spider web so they activated the paramilitary groups to blow up
[40:53.400 --> 40:58.120]  government buildings and firebomb everything open nazi's heiling hitler i mean you can't make this
[40:58.120 --> 41:04.120]  stuff up and then to take over the country and i'm not saying that a lot of ukrainians don't
[41:04.120 --> 41:10.920]  have peace with russia and that russia isn't another tyranny the point is that the west started
[41:10.920 --> 41:17.240]  this and i said the russians are going to grab certain areas that they control and need and
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.240]  then the other russians in the east are going to want to join russia they're going to stand up
[41:21.240 --> 41:25.640]  themselves they're not going to want to be ethnically cleansed now civil war is going to
[41:25.640 --> 41:31.400]  break out they're going to send in the ukrainian military nato cia backed the russians are going
[41:31.400 --> 41:36.840]  to fight back the russians are going to roll armor in you have nature responsibility boom nuclear war
[41:37.800 --> 41:41.320]  i mean that's the scenario next hour i'm going to walk through with you and
[41:45.640 --> 41:50.040]  my gut tells me this is not some higher level deal with putin where they're going to just
[41:50.040 --> 41:56.920]  divide the two countries and act like that it was a a fight and the decision has been made to cut
[41:56.920 --> 42:02.680]  the country in two and russia gets to suck eastern ukraine dry and nato and then you get to suck the
[42:02.680 --> 42:09.240]  other side dry the hitler style impact with poland now i think that's in the cards and being discussed
[42:09.240 --> 42:13.240]  diplomatically they always have multiple game plans but that's not where this is going
[42:14.440 --> 42:19.480]  and the hardening of structures the digging in the bunkers here the bunkers in russia
[42:19.480 --> 42:25.080]  the global financial crisis ran corporation two years ago singing on a major theater war maybe a
[42:25.080 --> 42:32.280]  third world war to bring in the world government this could be it five years before joel scousen
[42:32.280 --> 42:39.000]  says it's coming and i think joel's a smart guy but and we'll get him on you know maybe next week
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.560]  maybe sunday i'll be live this sunday i will be in studio live this sunday 4 to 6 p.m we've had
[42:45.560 --> 42:52.280]  family stuff come up and then i've had uh stuff happen you know like easter so i've missed a few
[42:52.280 --> 42:57.320]  of the sunday shows and my grandmother i don't want to get into it she's 89 and she's had a fall
[42:57.320 --> 43:00.280]  about a month ago and we've been taking care of her i don't want to get off into all that but she's
[43:00.280 --> 43:04.680]  stabilized now that's why i've been missing some time when it rains it pours out a bunch of other
[43:04.680 --> 43:09.640]  family stuff going on such but i'm here i'll take a few days off here in there i'll probably take
[43:09.640 --> 43:14.680]  more time off it's just a when it rains it pours a lot of other family stuff i'll tell you about
[43:14.680 --> 43:19.080]  later but very soon but the point is is that all hell's been breaking loose around here
[43:19.080 --> 43:27.000]  but i'll be live this sunday 4 to 6 p.m lord willing now here's the issue there are times
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.560]  in history when more happens in a year that happened the previous 50 many historians have said that
[43:33.400 --> 43:41.080]  we're entering that key flux period right now where on every front technological development
[43:41.080 --> 43:48.840]  cultural changes demographic changes military operations awakenings decadence the good the
[43:48.840 --> 43:54.040]  bad the ugly you're going to see a lot of things happen and you're also during christ he's going
[43:54.040 --> 44:03.160]  to find out who's who benedict arnold was probably the third or after torres washington
[44:03.160 --> 44:10.680]  general green maybe the second greatest general of the six seven-year war from 1775 officially 1776
[44:10.680 --> 44:19.720]  that went on for the next six years or so but it turned out the last two years he thought we
[44:19.720 --> 44:24.440]  were going to lose and and he'd been british the whole time most people fighting were british
[44:24.440 --> 44:29.560]  they were tired having their rights taken they both have been redcoats yours washington all of them
[44:31.480 --> 44:36.600]  and so he was a double agent the whole time the last two years at least because he thought he was
[44:36.600 --> 44:42.200]  going with the winners he didn't all in for what he thought was right he was a pragmatist a sociopath
[44:44.280 --> 44:49.560]  i can officially say after five years six years of when back lying about me and attacking me that
[44:49.560 --> 44:55.880]  he is a benedict arnold there's no doubt that's who he is for whatever reason he may have always
[44:55.880 --> 45:01.480]  been a globalist he may have always been bad news i don't attack him when he said horrible lies about
[45:01.480 --> 45:09.240]  me i mean god he said i have sex with charlie sheen and showers folks i i knew charlie sheen
[45:09.240 --> 45:13.720]  very well before he got back on drugs and melted down i met met him through his brother who's been
[45:13.720 --> 45:19.160]  a longtime listener milio estvez and his dad i'll leave it at that the family were listeners before
[45:19.160 --> 45:24.600]  charlie sheen and i've spent a lot of time at martin sheen's house he's not the big liberal
[45:24.600 --> 45:29.000]  people think he is they kind of manipulate the media who he really is they're really smart people
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.840]  his mother's an amazing lady but that's the kind of stuff and i ignore stuff like that
[45:33.640 --> 45:38.680]  you know you can say that's a joke but then when he's always implying that i want civil war want to
[45:38.680 --> 45:44.520]  kill police and that i'm covering up racism and that the alexione side wants violence he said a
[45:44.520 --> 45:51.000]  week and a half ago enough is enough because you know when he says any civil disobedience like we
[45:51.000 --> 45:57.560]  saw at the bundy ranch is bad and he's against it and he's really showing you who he is when he
[45:57.560 --> 46:03.320]  said three years ago on fox that we played this last week that the government's going to stage
[46:03.320 --> 46:07.400]  terror attacks and blame the liberty movement for it well he had their memos he's right he was
[46:07.400 --> 46:11.720]  listening to me then he was i guess having a moment of thinking oh i'm scared they're going to set me
[46:11.720 --> 46:16.200]  up and blame me i'll expose it well now now he's scared and doesn't want to go the route of telling
[46:16.200 --> 46:21.880]  the truth benedict arnold who was a great general that we wish would have stayed true to the cause
[46:21.880 --> 46:28.600]  has cowarded out and decided to fully join the system so and he doesn't like the fact
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.000]  that we're in a lot of the same affiliates as him and so i'm not against those affiliates i think
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.760]  it's a good show for you to carry but don't penalize me because glenn beck's talking about
[46:36.760 --> 46:42.120]  about me every day now basically okay i'm not attacking anybody in the conservative or liberty
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.720]  movement i'm trying to stop obama and the globalist who use the race card and now beck and i i didn't
[46:47.720 --> 46:52.120]  hear it but my reporter heard it and wrote down notes and i guess you gotta go to subscription
[46:52.120 --> 46:56.280]  thing to get it but somebody'll put it on youtube then we can play it for documentation here but
[46:56.280 --> 47:00.600]  night wrote notes he's got notes right there his brother-in-law called him and heard it in the
[47:00.600 --> 47:04.920]  morning so it rears on our local affiliate 590 so he tuned in last night while he was moving in
[47:04.920 --> 47:09.560]  the u-haul and listened to it wrote notes and it was the classic stuff i've heard what's that
[47:09.560 --> 47:14.440]  type that crazy guy i don't know in full wars yeah that nut yeah god wants to overthrow the
[47:14.440 --> 47:18.040]  u.s. government wants violence yeah well he knew about the money stuff tried to cover it up yet
[47:18.040 --> 47:25.560]  hurt to cover up the racism man that is real defamation okay we have nothing we did absolutely
[47:26.360 --> 47:35.000]  no such thing at any level and so this isn't about beck it's about what's gonna happen
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.520]  when the globalist blow up in new oklahoma city and try to blame us what's gonna happen when they
[47:38.520 --> 47:43.560]  start a new war what's gonna happen when they come after domestic grips and the guys a lot of
[47:43.560 --> 47:49.000]  big hosts are going to say well go ahead and do it and well alex jones has been arrested ron paul
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.400]  just died of a stroke wink wink well i think it's normally out of a stroke he was old and
[47:53.400 --> 47:57.880]  yeah rand paul just was in a car wreck his back's broken alex jones you know tries to try to shoot
[47:57.880 --> 48:03.720]  out with cops and they took him out or he got caught with a bunch of drugs with a you know whatever
[48:04.520 --> 48:08.760]  that's the kind of stuff they do i want you to know that when that happens folks you're looking
[48:08.760 --> 48:15.080]  at an enemy operative okay because now he's crossed the rubicon with me david night you
[48:15.080 --> 48:20.440]  heard this last night and again it's bigger than beck it shows that he's scared he's decided to
[48:20.440 --> 48:24.920]  throw in with the southern prairie law center the exact talking points of the white house run
[48:24.920 --> 48:30.120]  media matters michael savages and doing this he's getting more hardcore we salute him he's not a
[48:30.120 --> 48:34.920]  coward sean hannah he's not being a coward rush limbaugh is not being a coward glenn beck has
[48:34.920 --> 48:41.640]  shown himself to be a really dangerous person and i don't do this on air i have to protect myself
[48:41.640 --> 48:47.400]  in liberty movement david what did you hear last night well alex it was really it really got me
[48:47.400 --> 48:51.240]  upset as you point out they they were saying pretending that they didn't know what info wars
[48:51.240 --> 48:55.080]  was or that they'd never heard of info wars but what he's doing is he's playing a very dangerous
[48:55.080 --> 49:01.080]  game and he's totally mischaracterizing what happened there on saturday the 12th when this
[49:01.080 --> 49:05.720]  thing came out yesterday with the new york times he's essentially doing the alsharpton southern
[49:05.720 --> 49:10.760]  poverty law center talking points the way the new york times edited and distorted and spun
[49:10.760 --> 49:15.480]  bundy's comments and he's doubling down on it taking their talking points but what was also
[49:15.480 --> 49:21.240]  bad was the way he was portraying bundy the people with him and even us as being the aggressors as
[49:21.240 --> 49:26.280]  being the people who are threatening he's trying to pretend that he's gondy he's not gondy he's a
[49:26.280 --> 49:32.280]  quisling what happened there i mean you told me quote yes you said he said the info wars group
[49:32.280 --> 49:36.040]  wants the violent overthrow yes what he was saying was he said they're pushing for this he goes
[49:36.040 --> 49:39.640]  when i heard that it was i knew from the beginning that i didn't want to i want to be on the other
[49:39.640 --> 49:44.280]  side of the story because info wars made this a national story he goes that should be a red flag
[49:44.280 --> 49:49.000]  not a false flag haha but a red flaming drugs i'm giving him the credit drugs made it a national
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.240]  story we broke it he made a national it is a big story and he's saying that you know we're constantly
[49:53.240 --> 49:59.320]  pushing for revolution i think that's not true what happened there is exactly what glenn beck
[49:59.320 --> 50:05.000]  claims he wants to see happen and that is peaceful people peacefully standing up with loaded guns in
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.920]  their face like tenement square now some people i didn't see anybody down there with a gun on them
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.600]  but there were well actually there was a couple of guys that were holding uh rifles but nobody
[50:14.600 --> 50:18.600]  was pointing back up there there was one guy on the bridge they keep showing that picture from
[50:18.600 --> 50:23.960]  multiple angles okay but the point is that now it's been projected on to us and now we weren't
[50:23.960 --> 50:29.880]  there this weekend when he made the uh this the the the black comments and then he you said he said
[50:29.880 --> 50:33.800]  basically we were involved in that he said these guys are embedded there they're everywhere he goes
[50:33.800 --> 50:38.520]  they know that he was making those comments last saturday well that was not even the same saturday
[50:38.520 --> 50:43.880]  he's not he's totally out of the scene he's not wrong he i know his i know his insider people
[50:43.880 --> 50:48.680]  he's got at least four fbi agents with him at all times so-called retired this is fbi
[50:49.480 --> 50:55.480]  just like alsharpn's fbi i will bet my right arm the fbi is feeding all this to glenn beck glenn
[50:55.480 --> 51:01.080]  beck is the fbi so so of course they're attacking us this is the fbi the obama fbi with the global

[1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:41.560]  but we wouldn't just cover this it was glenn beck just saying this but each saying an off
[1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:47.160]  white house talking points media matters talking points that he originated so for anybody that's
[1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:55.080]  trained in in in tracking psyops and stuff now it all click for me why he says i want him arrested
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:01:00.120]  and put in a camp he said that a week and a half ago we played the bizarre clip why he says i want
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:05.160]  violence why he says info wars wants violence is covering up the racism of cliven bunny that we were
[1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:10.040]  there and knew about this within hours of us seeing it we had him on and covered it and said the way
[1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:16.040]  it was spun is terrible we're all about fighting racism here real real racism you know divide and
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:21.320]  conquer and to have him do this david uh bottom line what's your analysis on this because this
[1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:25.160]  is really dangerous well the bottom line is the best thing you could say about glenn beck is that
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:29.560]  he just doesn't know what's going on he's totally uninformed and doesn't care and he's spinning
[1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:33.800]  things i don't think that's what's happening russia's talked about the drive-by media we saw that
[1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:39.000]  happen out there i would say that glenn beck is the comfy couch media you know at best case if
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:43.720]  you're listening to him you don't think that he's an fbi shill the best you can say about him is that
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:48.840]  he's an obama fbi shill that's right the best you can say is he's setting half a continent away he
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:52.440]  doesn't have any reporters out there he's not reading any of the facts he's totally misconstruing
[1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:56.840]  everything i don't think that's what's happening the day after this happened he had seven talking
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:01.800]  points going in and defending harry reid defending the blm ignoring the fact that they were pointing
[1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:08.120]  snipers at unarmed people all week and tazering and police dogging and saying we'll shoot you
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:14.680]  and americans finally stood up and peacefully stood against it but we didn't even have any guns a few
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:19.640]  people did and now we're leading it exactly now i mean i was there saying no violence no violence
[1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:24.840]  over the radio you were there covering it and now he's lying about me so they set me up people go
[1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:29.320]  well he got what he deserved yeah he's used everything he can to assassinate the character
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:33.400]  clavin bundy and assassinate our character and as jessie ventura said i don't know if it was his
[1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:38.280]  original expression first they assassinate your character then they assassinate you that was gondy
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:44.600]  that's what gondy said okay but that's the technique that they use and he wants to compare
[1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:50.040]  himself to gondy he's really acquisaling he is really selling out he's not he's totally handled
[1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:55.480]  yeah oh absolutely what he is as associate he's a sociopath yeah he thinks like doing whatever he
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:03:01.720]  wants makes him a winner not in god's eyes that's right if he had even read his book on agenda 21
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:05.720]  i'm sure he had somebody ghost write it for him he would have understood what was going on there
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:09.400]  as part of many different aspects there's a lot of different aspects there's crony capitalism
[1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:13.880]  there's corruption there's agenda 21 there's an out of control police state he has ignored
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:18.120]  and talked against all those as if he were the new york times or as if he were the southern
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:22.600]  poverty well it's in the blm documents that they wanted bundy's land for the environmental easement
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:27.000]  yes yes where they say we can build on this and we have this as an easement and they go oh we're
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.680]  lying and we said we lied about the bullets well he laughed at bundy on the many night show and
[1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:36.120]  said oh you're going back to the 1860s to try to support your argument when the blm confiscated
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:41.720]  land in texas confiscated that farmers land they went back to the 1803 louisiana purchase
[1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:46.360]  what bundy is doing he's going back to the cops the oldest thing in land is the most powerful
[1:03:46.360 --> 1:03:50.520]  look rick perry says he'll go kick the feds off when they're trying to grab land well what is rick
[1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:55.320]  perry and extremist now of course they did the same thing in devotta to a man who's part of the
[1:03:55.320 --> 1:04:00.600]  shoshone indian tribe you know and as russell means pointed out he said every treaty we've
[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:04.280]  had with the u.s. government they've broken your treaty with the u.s. government is the
[1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:09.800]  constitution and they're breaking it now as his book were white men fear to tread that's exactly
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:13.000]  what's going on here what they've done to the indians and the reservations is what they want
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.680]  to do to everybody and that video is called welcome to the reservation if you guys can find
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:21.400]  that it's like an hour long he died last year an amazing individual again you meet him he's
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:26.920]  totally different than what the media said he was it's incredible how they distort who people are
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:33.000]  and that's what i realized they're distorting who i am yes msnb says i'm msnb says i'm deeply racist
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:38.360]  beck says that now with no proof yes because they want people that don't know who i am to think oh
[1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:42.760]  i don't listen to him he's deeply racist they always play the racist and the terrorist card
[1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:46.840]  and the first person to play the terrorist card was glenn beck he played it three days before
[1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:51.720]  harry reid said well that's the thing is that is that with people like glenn beck on the supposed
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:58.200]  patriot movement who needs the liberals i mean he literally is becoming obama glenn beck becomes obama
[1:05:00.440 --> 1:05:05.320]  the globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding

[1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:15.960]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:31.320]  monday through friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central we're here discussing history
[1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:35.720]  discussing the present the future looking at legislation looking at global trends
[1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:42.600]  giving you the good news the bad news and the quite frankly over the top insane sensational news
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:48.680]  that only reality can bring you i have been radicalized by reality i have been radicalized
[1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:56.360]  by first being on the air in 1995 when almost no one was really using the internet and covering
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:04.600]  government documents dealing with pentagon bases in upstate new york where they were producing goats
[1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:12.200]  that were part spider to create spider-man like body armor out of their milk and i would cover it
[1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:17.160]  off of scientific journals that i would get the library and people would say i was a liar
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:25.080]  and then suddenly scientists and journalists and engineers would hear my show and send me
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:31.640]  trade journals and things of even more insane things now by 96 97 the internet got bigger more
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:39.320]  stuff was on it but i got frustrated by the fact that things like that and hundreds of other things
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:43.800]  were real but people thought i was a crazy conspiracy theorist for talking about it
[1:09:46.360 --> 1:09:51.160]  now everyone knows about goats that are part spider there's been thousands of news articles
[1:09:51.160 --> 1:09:58.360]  about it i mean i've been at dinner parties and told people that 15 20 years ago you could buy
[1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:01.960]  in hong kong glowing rhesus monkeys that glow in the dark
[1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:09.960]  because i was sent trade publications on that back then they cost a half million dollars now
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:15.080]  they cost five thousand dollars last time i saw i'm tempted to buy one but that gives money to
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:20.600]  the abusive practice of cross species engineering do you know what the genetic engineers have said
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:25.880]  on my broadcast about this there's at any time this is going to give rise to super bugs it may
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:32.120]  have already done it and cause zoological diseases to jump into humans and is so deadly dangerous
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:41.800]  it'll make your head spin and i'm only telling you about one one let's be conservative hundred
[1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:48.600]  thousands of what's going on the pharmacological crops i remember reading an ap article back in
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:58.120]  2002 about protogen in texas with open-air crops in kansas and other areas that had live hiv growing
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:03.880]  in the corn and i read it and said is it that frightening it could it could jump into humans
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:11.720]  it could become airborne and they had people in spacesuits out after i reported off the ap
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:18.760]  as i said this could be dangerous out burning it all over kansas and texas and one other state
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:25.080]  and it was in the news local news that guys in spacesuits were out burning it from the federal
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:30.680]  government actual government helicopters landed and burned it so i gotta say the government actually
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:36.920]  does good sometimes i pointed out that dr peonka was at a presentation one of the heads of the
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:42.440]  biology department at ut and said he wants airborne Ebola to be released to call 90 percent of us
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:46.760]  that he and his family are ready to die and i pointed out that he and his undergraduates were
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:54.200]  working on the stuff like that and i quoted some of his undergraduates and that become phd's doctors
[1:11:55.240 --> 1:12:00.200]  them saying we need to get rid of all humans the fbi visited him that was in the austin american
[1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:06.040]  statesman so i don't think the government's our enemy it's just a complex system that has
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:11.720]  corporate and other interests controlling it we need to get control of it now there it is a
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:16.600]  dr doom eric vionker received standing ovation from texas academy of science and then gets a visit
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:29.000]  from the fbi and i said the fbi should visit him the fbi did the fbi is a diverse organization run by
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:33.640]  eric holder right now so that's that's why you see them demonizing gun owners and
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:38.760]  shipping guns into mexico with the atf blend the second amendment but but i'm going to get into
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:45.400]  the ukraine situation it's just that i don't make stuff up is my point
[1:12:48.280 --> 1:12:53.080]  every once in a while i get things wrong and i admit when i get things wrong i wish i was wrong
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:13:01.080]  about all this it's not fun to have white house run cnn msnbc media matters saying i'm deeply racist
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:06.440]  with no proof and then i'm violent and i want to kill cops and i want to war they're saying
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:13.000]  that so cops start thinking i'm a bad guy so when they shut me up nobody comes to my aid i'm being
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:19.720]  shut up but that's part of the mission i mean look i'll say it again one of my grandfathers
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:26.760]  was a fighter pilot crash landed almost died in world war two my other grandfather flew b17s
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:30.920]  for that he flew liberator flying coffins out of north africa once they got him into italy he was
[1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:37.640]  in b17s he got a sunstroke uh in a mission in the next mission or two missions later his whole
[1:13:37.640 --> 1:13:43.480]  crew got blown up and died to give you an example of how how i barely survived and and my point of
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:49.000]  using that analogy is they knew when they were flying into flat clouds that was the factories
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:55.160]  they had to bomb i know when i get enemy attacks that i'm over the target so if i get killed or
[1:13:55.160 --> 1:14:00.760]  set up let's just get one thing straight you didn't have a victory over me new world order i knew
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:08.280]  what i was climbing into i knew the cockpit i was getting into i am steering into the flak the more
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:13.560]  i get the more i know i'm on target so i i i just want everybody to understand that that i'm in this
[1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:18.680]  to win it i'm not in this because i'm a narcissist i'm not in this because i want a big name for
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:25.160]  myself i am in an absolute war that i know is real i've committed my full life to it and i feel
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:29.640]  like i'm not doing a good enough job to fight these tyrants i believe in humanity and i'm
[1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:35.800]  committed and i want to believe in other libertarian talk show host i want to believe in you i want
[1:14:35.800 --> 1:14:42.120]  to beat these people i want a better world i want to uphold my family name i want to be
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:47.000]  honorable i want to look at the facts and try to give you the most reasoned historical morally
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:55.240]  morally based analysis i can and i'm in pure myself i'm worldly myself i'm not perfect folks i'm not
[1:14:55.240 --> 1:15:01.320]  on some ihors i'm not here lecturing you i know we're on the edge of world war three i know the
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:07.800]  globalists are doing reckless things on every front and i think the hand of god fact i know
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:12.760]  is the only reason we haven't already had a nuclear war are a huge bio weapons release
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:21.560]  and i pray every day that we not totally collapse because history shows elites become arrogant
[1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:28.680]  they become megalomaniacal and they destroy civilizations before they didn't have thermal
[1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:36.760]  nuclear weapons and bio weapons i mean the huns thousands of years ago were catapulting
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:43.800]  plague-ridden black plague bodies over chinese fortress walls so i guess bio weapons are ancient
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:50.840]  and aren't new but i mean more sophisticated ones i just want everybody out there to have a good life
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:55.160]  and to have a chance to be empowered i'm not anybody's enemy i don't want a war with the
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:16:00.600]  occupied federal government because i know that's part of the plan i don't want any cops to be killed
[1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:07.560]  and everybody knows i say that every day i'm trying to stop a stage civil war and so the response is
[1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:16.200]  by the southern prairie law center adl media matters cnn msnbc and glenn beck is that i want
[1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:22.520]  to bloody civil war and i'm a racist and that's because ladies and gentlemen they don't like the
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:31.240]  fact that i know who they are they don't like the fact that i see right through their baloney
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:38.360]  now do you agree with me that we're on the edge on so many fronts economic spiritual cultural
[1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:44.920]  biological that that we're not on the edge of a crisis we're already going down into the valley
[1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:51.400]  we're going into the valley of crises into the pit we're marching into hell and i just want to
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:58.920]  turn this around you know these government-run churches tell you it's foregone conclusion
[1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:03.320]  that everything has been predestined well then why is so many times in the bible do the prophets go
[1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:06.920]  and tell the people repent and turn back and they do and they get a hundred year reprieve like none of
[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:16.680]  them or god sent moses to free the israelites i mean or or 1776 i mean do we just have to give
[1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:21.320]  into evil and say the world's over and this is the way it is i mean maybe it is but but i don't like
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:26.280]  people saying we can't do anything or every time someone stands up and says let's try to be good
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:30.120]  everyone says oh you can't do that there's no such thing
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:38.200]  i'm just one little guy who had dyslexia and a learning disability he could hardly spell
[1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:45.960]  who pretty much by myself built a giant independent media operation that reaches

[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:07.800]  they are moving into russian ethnic areas that are clearly going to become autonomous and want to
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:12.840]  join russia that's the natural course russia will then be drawn into this and if the west
[1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:17.720]  decides to asymmetrically attack the russians they will asymmetrically attack it first to test
[1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:25.320]  then if major armor or aircraft are brought in against russian forces
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:34.040]  or against russian populations in eastern ukraine russia will probably attack those forces
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:39.480]  with nuclear weapons that's what russia says they'll do there you are now i don't know
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:45.640]  if that's going to happen i'd give it a 10 chance maybe 15 but that's a real possibility right now

[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:33.320]  folks america isn't america anymore america is seized by the military industrial complex itself
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:39.160]  run by predominantly foreign offshore banks the same ones that got obama care passed bipartisanly
[1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:45.320]  you've got a minority of republican libertarians who are growing who are sane who want to fix things
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:49.560]  so they're being attacked by the republican leadership the democratic leadership you've
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:53.560]  now got glenn beckham you just joined us and it's not about him attacking me it's about a sea change

[1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:23.480]  about the general audience they wanted on record when all hell breaks loose that i'm the reason the
[1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:30.440]  civil war started not obama not glenn beck not the globalist and they're going to go after all
[1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:35.800]  liberty-based groups he wants to be left standing as the new vestigial leader of what's left of
[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:41.720]  libertarians and you know i just said here in the office earlier on air i said you know he
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:46.040]  brags he's got all these fbi agents that work for him former fbi that you know he's got all
[1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:49.480]  people i've talked to people that worked there years ago about how they watch everything we do
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:54.600]  and they're supposed to be us but then demonize us and i was told that by
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:00.440]  high-level people i mean repeatedly at the time that big of a deal i'd be
[1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:05.560]  going into fox studios build another show they say glenn beck is freaking out climbing the walls
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:10.360]  you can't come on now i mean that's fine i'm going over to the view and going over to do
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:14.440]  you know seeing it and i mean it's not that big of a deal but you know glenn beck and his quote

[1:43:55.000 --> 1:44:00.280]  when they fully take over if he wasn't always a spook he was brought in by him in the last four
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:09.320]  years roger ailes was an intelligence to set up fox news that's on record and they broke away from
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:17.080]  him to start their own operation and the word is because roger ailes is too patriotic and
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:26.520]  wouldn't work with obama oh you want all of it i think i'm going to go ahead and load torpedoes
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:31.640]  you know i i i am so focused on the new world order and everything else but i've got a deal
[1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:36.840]  with their attack vessel they got right in front of me i got so much to do around here but i can
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:41.640]  go do the go get all the stuff i've already researched load it up and i'm going to i think
[1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:45.560]  i'm going to do it in fact now that i've announced that i have to i'm going to i think i'm going to
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:52.280]  drop everything on your ass and excuse my french ladies and gentlemen you want it little boy who
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:57.560]  thinks he's so tough and since threatening letters everybody prepare you think that you think you
[1:44:57.560 --> 1:45:07.160]  think a bunch of spooks at your operation scare me you think as you surround yourself with a bunch
[1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:17.560]  of government people you're safe from the truth i don't work for the cia or the fbi i work for my
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:25.000]  conscience now that's the problem with our country is you've got all these people working in government
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  who want to go take over divisions of the economy and run their own operations
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:36.440]  and they don't like the fact that everybody knows i'm for real who's got a gut and who's got instincts
[1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:42.840]  and common sense and a track record and they want to destroy me with the false flag that's coming
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:47.240]  very soon that's going to be blame the liberty movement to kill the tea party well i'm not going
[1:45:47.240 --> 1:45:54.280]  to sell out and mediate when i'm saying i'm not going to back off i want to end abortion i want to
[1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:59.800]  end open borders i want to end the attack on the second amendment i want liberty that's what i want
[1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:08.360]  not helicopters not jets not lounging around in couches with fbi agents all day and i'm done
[1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:17.400]  but here they are folks all of them in your face a nest of globalist spouting obama lines
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:26.680]  so there you go a bunch of guys that think they can play you and your family a bunch of guys that
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:31.960]  think they can create some cult leader that you're going to follow so they can control and lead the
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:36.840]  liberty movement right into the judas goat shoots you know what judas goat is it's a goat train that
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:41.240]  doesn't get slaughtered every year that that is the leader of the goats the leader of the sheep
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:49.400]  that leads them into the slaughter i am not a judas goat
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:56.040]  so there you go i mean the huffington post
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:06.600]  runs i mean and you look into this woman i mean my god does he have to have obama as you know as
[1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:13.720]  his uh as his uh co-host or something for you to configure this out and again if you're an affiliate
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:18.280]  or a new listener i don't in fight i don't talk about anybody in the so-called libertarian conservative
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:22.840]  media but when they're lying about me doing things like this trying to destroy me
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:31.400]  the meme needs to go out with people like glenn beck who needs obama and why does he have so many
[1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:36.280]  obama people working for him and so many justice department people working for him and why is he
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:43.400]  spouting justice department lines and propaganda now hal turner was an fbi asset and i told you it was
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:45.880]  an anonymous got into his email and you know what happened to him
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:57.560]  i'm going to say a prayer god i recognize that this is a key juncture point that the enemy
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:01.400]  realizes that we're growing exponentially as they come after us with their operatives please i've been
[1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:07.800]  a humble servant try to be the best i can and please please protect us and please help us expose the
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:12.600]  enemies within foreign and domestic and please allow me to continue on in my work so that i can
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:17.480]  do a better job and continue to wake others up or if it is your will that they destroy me please let
[1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:22.920]  it be an edifying message to all so that we can learn from it and and in the end defeat these
[1:48:22.920 --> 1:48:28.280]  enemies within these benedict arnold's in the name of your son jesus christ i'm in
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:36.040]  and i just ask you all to pray for this broadcast and to pray that all be revealed
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:42.680]  and that all the veils be torn back from the would be religious cult leader that is the
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:47.560]  cia frontman the fbi frontman the justice department obama frontman that is going back
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:53.080]  and i just pray that that happen and if it's god's will it will
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:49:01.480]  no he likes to invoke god all day when i invoke god i do it very humbly in god's presence
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:16.360]  and i pray that all of you will pray with me that justice be brought against msnbc obama
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:23.800]  eric holder glenbeck and the rest of these people he's now using the race card edits
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:27.560]  bundy praise black folks in hispanics and said they're good hardworking people that pay their
[1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:31.640]  taxes and that it's a new form of slavery of the full video info wars and they knew this was all
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:36.120]  coming out and they put this out now they claim that we were involved that we're racist and that
[1:49:36.120 --> 1:49:40.520]  we want violent overthrow of america so that when the stage attack comes we'll be blamed
[1:49:42.280 --> 1:49:45.720]  i am not going to be part of this and joseph ferrah is going to be joining us to talk about the
[1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:49.800]  real attacks on the media and the government documents that have come out and i'm going to

[1:54:00.600 --> 1:54:14.120]  before you slip into unconsciousness i'd like to have another kiss
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:20.120]  i've always told you when the globalists get ready to drop the hammer here domestically
[1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:24.040]  their operatives and the liberating movement are going to activate to show who they are
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:31.640]  and say do what the government says go along with the takeover this will be extremely destructive
[1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:35.640]  all the things beck's been doing if you look at the comments on his websites are like 90
[1:54:35.640 --> 1:54:40.600]  plus percent negative people are deserting him in droves but it's just like msnbc they don't
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:45.240]  care of it kills their ratings it's a mission they've been ordered to do it
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:52.680]  so he's you know bundy's a racist a horrible person out of context alec shones is a racist
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:58.280]  alec shones wants violence it doesn't matter if it's not true they have to do it and the fact
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:03.560]  that he would do it at this point means that they they intend to drop the hammer on the liberty
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:09.160]  movement very very soon and if we go along with this under cowards and change what we're saying
[1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:14.760]  so they'll be nice to us they win they know we've got the power they want to intimidate us just
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:20.040]  because they've got fbi or cia in front of their name i happen to know a lot of people in the
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:25.560]  government that are liberty lovers and don't like what's happening and so it doesn't matter but you're
[1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:30.520]  not magic and have magic powers it's like at bill berg covering hillary and obama there in 2008
[1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:33.080]  in my film the obama deception the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:36.120]  the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:39.400]  the the lapdog media would govern we're calling them saying they're here they're secret service
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:44.360]  would like take mp5's out and aim them at us they'd have uh state department security marines
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:50.840]  flipping us off and threatening us and they were doing under orders later i had some of them apologize
[1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:55.320]  to me but it was just like little kids talking in their sleeve and you know i can wear a black suit
[1:55:55.320 --> 1:56:01.560]  and a black tie if i want to i mean just because you've got some alphabet agency in front of your
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:08.920]  name it's like saying you work for coca-cola i mean there are so many cia people and defense
[1:56:08.920 --> 1:56:13.560]  intelligence people in gallus it'll make your head spin i grew up there
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:20.920]  and it's just so disgusting to know every move these people are going to make
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:25.400]  and then to see them make the move but the reason they make moves that look stupid if you're awake
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:31.000]  is they're targeting a dumb down public they're counting on you not being informed why would
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:34.440]  they say there's no bullets being butter armored vehicles why would they say there's not a police
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:37.880]  state being set up when it is why would they say there's no drones why would they say there's no
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:43.400]  $5,000 fee on on small businesses on each employee if you don't get obama care or cut them down to
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:49.960]  30 hours or less and that's in the law it's happening why do they say it's not true because
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:55.480]  they think you're that dumb so they tell you i want to kill cops they probably take that out
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:57:00.920]  and play that clip they tell you alex jones wants war alex jones wants civil war when i
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:06.440]  say every day i don't want civil war it turns into he wants civil war will play the clip then
[1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:17.400]  where i want civil war i'm so tired of the betrayal and the treason i'm so tired of the dishonor
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:23.080]  i want to think more of people i want to believe that everything i was told about people wasn't
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:28.520]  true even though it's been proven to be right there's no fema camps ron paul has a thing called
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:34.520]  a money bomb to blow up the government he said that when the first month it's like money bonds
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:41.000]  were going on for six months back when he said that six seven years ago the army needs to be
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:45.880]  used against these people that was a southern poverty law center
[1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:54.600]  media matters lined in i kept saying these are government lines these are hardcore inside lines
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:58:02.600]  first not later he doesn't repeat the lines later he pro generates he gives birth he coins them
[1:58:04.520 --> 1:58:10.440]  he gets the memo first folks and i say he works for obama it's above that
[1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:19.160]  and then i think about how did i get into such a hardcore game how am i some guy from
[1:58:19.160 --> 1:58:23.320]  dallas texas in the middle of this ladies and gentlemen there's no secret room telling me
[1:58:23.320 --> 1:58:29.080]  what to do i don't have any advisors i'm just here real going up against these people that's

[2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:12.600]  conspiracy theorists this is how we'll shut down information and stop the public from learning what
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:18.440]  we're doing it's a 300 page document only i think 29 30 pages counting the cover sheet came out
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:25.480]  and it just it's everything you see msnbc do you see media matters do people say why do you
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:30.840]  get media matters attention than other much traffic it is the white house it's obama so when
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:35.880]  they talk it's a democratic party in the clinton's and it's everything they do and say now from that
[2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:44.440]  original memo 1993 1994 there's another one and so you know this is people actually fighting the tyranny
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:51.800]  versus those that pose as liberty lovers and i don't usually you know ferrah agreed to come on
[2:01:51.800 --> 2:01:56.920]  today on the phone talk about this he's in studio next monday he's here separately shooting film
[2:01:56.920 --> 2:02:00.120]  by the way i told the folks making the film if they want to use our new studio
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:04.120]  it's called the maps on the wall and stuff we haven't shown it yet if they want to use that
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:07.160]  studio and they're before he's on with us they're welcome to and then they said yes they want to
[2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:11.960]  use it so maybe have nico call them call the filmmakers because i'm a bug ferrah and uh you
[2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:18.840]  haven't used that and i've been to ferrah's offices uh in uh virginia it's not a government
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:23.640]  operation it's real journalists and they're doing real research asking real questions and but then
[2:02:23.640 --> 2:02:27.160]  you look at other operations you can tell when they're basically government operations and when
[2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:32.360]  they're spouting white house propaganda and i just don't know why it didn't ever fully click until
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:37.000]  today looking at all the pieces that it was worse than i thought it's beyond being an opportunist
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:42.680]  when we speak about becky poo i'm being set up we're all being set up they're getting ready to
[2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:48.600]  drop the hammer the guns your kids they're gonna take everything and he wants to survive that so
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:56.840]  he's joined with soran we must join with soran well no i i don't think we're gonna be doing that
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:01.320]  and it'll all come out in the wash if good men do the right thing good women do the right thing
[2:03:01.320 --> 2:03:07.320]  evil will not triumph i know that and we're given providence we're given discernment to
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:11.320]  be able to defeat the enemy no weapon formed against us or prosper unless it's part of god's
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:19.000]  plan and so god's in control i'm not worried about it it's just a very sickening uh to see
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:27.240]  all of this going on but uh the headline in in in bright bar was three years before drudge
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:32.760]  judge changed the internet media landscape you know a white house was worried about internet
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:41.800]  was basically the headline i need that one too so uh continuing we um are going to
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:51.400]  read this headline out of the statesman journal that is a nightmare supreme court state can
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:03:56.840]  immunize children in its custody so now when they see ps your kids are not just going to put them
[2:03:56.840 --> 2:04:00.760]  on four or five or six or seven psychotrophics they're now going to shoot them up with the
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:05.000]  hundred plus shots that government wants your kids to have and when they have convulsions and
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  stuff that'll be no big deal they'll just blame the parents the department human services can
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:13.400]  order children in its custody to immunize even the child is temporarily custody and even the
[2:04:13.400 --> 2:04:17.240]  parents object to immunizations on principle according to an oregon supreme court ruling
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:27.560]  issued thursday yeah what's msnb say say your kids belong to the state that is an unbelievable

[2:08:43.080 --> 2:08:49.080]  of what you can call the true alternative media that has become the new dominant media by all
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:55.240]  metrics msnbc has a half million viewers average show we have conservatively three million
[2:08:56.600 --> 2:09:00.040]  that just gives you an example we have millions of visitors a day world and daily has millions of
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:06.680]  visitors a day drudge has 15 million a day but they call themselves the authority at msnbc
[2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:13.800]  and cnn when their audiences go down by about a quarter every year how are they going to counter
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:19.960]  us well here is the new york times fcc and shift backs fast lanes for web traffic that means
[2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:24.840]  the end of net neutrality shutting down the old web only letting you get establishment news

[2:09:59.800 --> 2:10:05.000]  this attack on free speech is happening because the old dinosaur media the state run media is in
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:10.680]  free fall the other perfect storm of state run media and government wanting to control information
[2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:14.600]  the pentagon announced last year that because of the drudge report and other alternative media
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:18.360]  they can't lie anymore remember that press conference by the undersecretary of the defense

[2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:30.840]  very important article it was cover article in our magazine now only got him till the bottom of
[2:10:30.840 --> 2:10:35.320]  the hour maybe a little bit longer but i wanted to build up the backdrop of chinese-style net
[2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:41.000]  censorship that's now being announced they're coming the crooks that have taken over the special
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:47.560]  interest and their minions the socialist progressive social engineers who will carry out any form of
[2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:51.720]  evil because they want control of our lives they're they're announcing an organ they'll
[2:10:51.720 --> 2:10:57.480]  inoculate your kids without permission today their supreme court just ruled that it's all happening

[2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:07.880]  we'll join with the system
[2:11:10.440 --> 2:11:16.360]  not joseph ferrah 1995 was also on a 93 memo clinton administration feared internet's ability
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:22.520]  to democratize news three years before drudge bombshell that's an article out of breitbart
[2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:29.640]  released clinton files on media enemies wnd.com learn what hillary meant by vast right wing
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:34.120]  conspiracy let's move on already covered this days ago but so i'm going to paraphrase it but go
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:39.080]  read the memo it says the new media is here we've got to control info we can't let the public have
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:43.720]  access these are quotes the free information we've got to have the media call anyone that
[2:11:43.720 --> 2:11:48.840]  questions us conspiracy theorist and any media that's not the washington poster new york times
[2:11:48.840 --> 2:11:55.720]  is a conspiracy theory conspiracy theory monica lawinsky conspiracy theory uh that they ship guns
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:11:59.000]  in the mexico blend the second amendment all confirmed conspiracy theory they stood down in
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:06.040]  mengozzi confirmed and who is enemy number one in here joseph ferrah western journalism center
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:14.440]  they founded world net daily that year 1995 96 and they go back to talking about him in 93 and
[2:12:14.440 --> 2:12:18.440]  how they were exposing events foster thing and other things and how they had to be targeted
[2:12:18.440 --> 2:12:25.160]  so this shows the power of the real media now what must they be doing
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:29.720]  it'll be in studio with us next week to talk more about this she's coming to town
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:36.280]  for filmmaking in a separate film but joseph ferrah who literally has gone through everything the
[2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:40.840]  audits the harassment the death threats the drone over his house in the virginia countryside
[2:12:41.960 --> 2:12:48.280]  the all sorts of dirty tricks that's how you know somebody's real and he's and i'm not lying
[2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:53.640]  i see him just understand he's real and he said before you know he said oh vote from you know
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:57.800]  anybody but mccain or obama none of the above you wrote a best-selling book about it he said i was
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:02.200]  wrong during the election he said obama gets in they're coming after everyone now they're
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:05.880]  announcing if you're libertarian you're a terrorist if you're a veteran you're a terrorist and they've
[2:13:05.880 --> 2:13:09.960]  gotten mainline conservatives agreeing with it now because they've been told the hammers dropping
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:14.040]  you better get with the right side if we stand against them they implode i'm going to give you
[2:13:14.040 --> 2:13:20.040]  the floor here so don't pause they're all perseverate joseph ferrah wnd.com we've got to all stick
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:25.320]  together or hang separate as you've been saying as i've been saying what the control left is good
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:29.880]  at but when people fully flip to benedict arnold we have no other choice but to defend ourselves
[2:13:29.880 --> 2:13:34.360]  like i did last hour which i hated doing folks it's really sad to see this and i'm not going to get
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:41.240]  into it with you but break down what these memos mean how big a deal it is and where we're going
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:46.040]  from here and what your gut tells you joseph ferrah well i hate to interrupt you alex because i never
[2:13:46.040 --> 2:13:51.960]  got a build-up like that from anybody so i appreciate it very much but you know one of the
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:57.640]  the interesting things about this report this communication stream of conspiracy commerce
[2:13:57.640 --> 2:14:03.560]  that you were referencing it and it illustrates how you know you've outlined the problem we're
[2:14:03.560 --> 2:14:10.840]  facing right now beautifully i mean they are coming after us they are uh... intending to dismantle
[2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:17.560]  the communication system that we've you know we've we've used so effectively over the years
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:22.280]  but the interesting thing is that going back into the clinton administration days and this
[2:14:22.280 --> 2:14:30.040]  report that you referenced they were doing this alex before there was a drudge before there was
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:37.720]  a world that daily before there was info wars we were working in newsletters back then okay printed
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:44.920]  newsletters and we had the clinton administration so upset and so worried because the internet had
[2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:50.840]  just been invented maybe there were a million people total around the world on the internet
[2:14:50.840 --> 2:14:56.520]  back then and they were already panicked hillary clinton was already talking about the fact that
[2:14:56.520 --> 2:15:03.160]  oh my gosh there are no gatekeepers that's the term she's there are no gatekeepers on the on the
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:08.120]  internet and that's what they want okay that's so the big media are there and by the way just
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:12.360]  interrupt if you're a new listener this is not our opinion or a conspiracy theory like hillary
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:17.800]  puts in your mind just a denial button people can push they release us on the clinton official
[2:15:17.800 --> 2:15:23.640]  presidential library website yeah by the way they released the only part of it i'm i'm on my desk
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:30.360]  because i'm talking to you right now i have a 331 page report wait a minute you got the secret one
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:35.320]  they only released 30 pages oh yeah yeah no i have the whole thing in fact we're we're trying to
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:42.600]  figure out how to republish it the problem with that is there there are so many news articles
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:47.320]  and things like that in this report we got to go and get reprint permission you know i think
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:51.880]  it's fair use because it's a government document that's attacking free speech yeah tell my lawyers
[2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:58.920]  give it to me i'll publish it right now alex you know how it is i mean yeah the the laws are
[2:15:58.920 --> 2:16:05.640]  the laws are there to protect some people not all the people and you know if i do something and you
[2:16:05.640 --> 2:16:11.800]  do something that media matters does suddenly there's a new standard in well yeah they show
[2:16:11.800 --> 2:16:15.880]  exhibits of news articles they won't shut down the answer is blackout 90 percent of each news
[2:16:15.880 --> 2:16:20.520]  article and then release it that should satisfy the lawyers exactly so you know the point i'm
[2:16:20.520 --> 2:16:27.800]  trying to make here is that they knew what the internet meant for them and and they were
[2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:33.400]  conspiring like the soviet union to kill it in its crib that's right to give you another illustration
[2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:42.920]  we've founded world medallion 1997 may have 1997 at that time msnbc.com was far and away
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:48.920]  the biggest website of any kind in the world okay i remember looking at that i remember saying
[2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:55.320]  to myself my wife i didn't tell anybody publicly but i said we're gonna we're gonna pass those guys
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:17:04.920]  some day and within a couple of years if if that msnbc imploded and rightfully so because of the
[2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:12.200]  direction they took which was you know forget about reporting the news uh you know let's let's uh
[2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:19.320]  indoctrinate the public into a statist mentality virtually a Stalinist mentality if you want to
[2:17:19.320 --> 2:17:25.400]  you know get more specific here and look at the the ratings that they had this is a combination of
[2:17:25.400 --> 2:17:34.760]  microsoft and nbc two gigantic you know multinational corporations and look what they've done
[2:17:35.720 --> 2:17:41.720]  they start with the number one website in the world and look at where they've gone now they're
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:48.040]  down down hundreds and hundreds of positions over that time so you know what you're saying is
[2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:53.880]  exactly right but i but i want people to understand that you know this has been going on for a long
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:18:01.400]  time and by the way you know when i when we first started w&d you know i realized oh my gosh these
[2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:09.480]  these people are coming after us right but we're still here uh what is it uh you know 17 years
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:14.680]  but do you agree now that the ultimate counterattack like we're the battle the bulls we're the
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:20.280]  allies and the nazis are about to launch their main assault oh yeah yeah we haven't seen anything
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:29.800]  like this before i mean the the forces are converging on us in such uh you know a symmetrical
[2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:36.200]  and uh the pattern they've been planning this you know and we we've bought them back there's
[2:18:36.200 --> 2:18:41.480]  been setbacks in their plans over the years but they never give up that's the thing about the
[2:18:41.480 --> 2:18:48.040]  left the Stalinist left is they're in this for the long haul and you you might win a battle here
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:53.080]  and there but they just keep coming and that's what we got to be prepared for all the time we
[2:18:53.080 --> 2:19:00.200]  got to we got to continue that way too we and we have to unite you know harry reed said something
[2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:07.160]  i thought with regard to this uh bundy situation in Las Vegas that was very revealing yesterday
[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:13.560]  i don't know if you caught it he said what we need to go up against this little you know rancher
[2:19:13.560 --> 2:19:22.280]  in Nevada is we need a united front you know that terminology right absolutely they're unified
[2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:27.320]  in their will to take over this country that's why i've tried to be unified as well but what
[2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:31.960]  do you do when our supposed own allies turn against us yeah but i don't like to all your
[2:19:31.960 --> 2:19:39.720]  listeners to do uh right now is go google the term united front and see what that means those are
[2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:46.920]  codewords okay he's telling that he's telling the the goose stepping you know troops out there
[2:19:46.920 --> 2:19:54.120]  that this is a battle that we have to win against cliven bundy you know and the the key was a
[2:19:54.120 --> 2:20:00.200]  new york times article where they labeled him unfairly unjustly as a racist took his words
[2:20:00.200 --> 2:20:05.640]  out of context because that's how they get us okay that's how they step that's how they make
[2:20:05.640 --> 2:20:12.920]  sure shawna annity and glenn beck are not going to support cliven bundy that's right not going to
[2:20:12.920 --> 2:20:19.960]  oppose it when they steam roll over uh liberty proponents like cliven bundy and uh and that's
[2:20:19.960 --> 2:20:24.840]  how all hell breaks loose and by the way i want to just back you up uh let's put up the definition
[2:20:24.840 --> 2:20:32.440]  of the united front that's a vi lennon coin term used by the bolsheviks in 1917 1918 we'll put it
[2:20:32.440 --> 2:20:38.600]  back on screen for tv viewers yeah it's not a coincidence they didn't pull that term out of
[2:20:38.600 --> 2:20:44.200]  thin air that has to be ingrained didn't you you know i used to be one of them i used to be uh you
[2:20:44.200 --> 2:20:50.520]  know young young kid but a commie i knew all of this terminology i knew what this was about
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:55.160]  and you know it helps to have that kind of historical perspective when we look at what's
[2:20:55.160 --> 2:21:01.720]  going on today meanwhile it's a bunch of rich insiders using communism as a way to enslave us
[2:21:01.720 --> 2:21:06.120]  while they exempt themselves from all the taxes but people are pointing out how harry reed's getting
[2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:12.520]  so rich uh off of all the different things he's running and and so what you're saying is a lot
[2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:17.320]  of these so-called conservatives get intimidated by what they see happening and then they let the
[2:21:17.320 --> 2:21:22.840]  left dictate things to them i think that's part of it but also i think it's the fact that they know
[2:21:22.840 --> 2:21:27.240]  that there's going to be staged events in this country like oklahoma city that are going to be
[2:21:27.240 --> 2:21:31.720]  blamed on the liberty movement and we just have to be ready for that i mean these people are not
[2:21:31.720 --> 2:21:38.520]  going to stop we have to expose joseph era just how evil they are so that when they do stuff people
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:44.120]  understand that this is a criminal group and i was ignorant until just the last seven eight years
[2:21:44.120 --> 2:21:49.320]  myself i thought it was more of a corruption in a corporate new world order and the rest of it but
[2:21:49.320 --> 2:21:56.600]  now i really realize the left socialist communist or the core of the political ideology that dominates
[2:21:56.600 --> 2:22:00.920]  this and there may be big banks and things funding it because they'll politically take over but at
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:08.280]  the end of the day my enemy really is the grassroots collectivist that hates my guts yeah and don't you
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:12.520]  know you're absolutely still absolutely right about the new world order and all those things
[2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:20.440]  as well that that's a reality and ultimately that's their goal but uh but you know they want they
[2:22:20.440 --> 2:22:26.760]  try to put it in terms that appeal to the average person so they attack racism do you think they
[2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:33.720]  really care about that clive and bundy the races i mean is that would it be news if you were no the
[2:22:33.720 --> 2:22:39.880]  point is to not be your clive and bundy they really care about him what they care about for the people
[2:22:39.880 --> 2:22:45.880]  who might line up and support the support of them they want to make sure that rand paul is
[2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:53.320]  we have to think twice about standing up for clive and bundy that gunbeck has to do that that's
[2:22:53.320 --> 2:22:59.080]  shone handed that's what worries them when alex jones and farrah and drudge and all these people
[2:22:59.080 --> 2:23:06.040]  out there who have some platform uh actually they wait a minute why are you mobilizing this
[2:23:06.040 --> 2:23:12.760]  military campaign against this rancher from nevada that's what and you know and so what
[2:23:12.760 --> 2:23:18.040]  they do is if there's one degree of separation between you and clive and bundy sunday you're
[2:23:18.040 --> 2:23:24.920]  on defense the defensive about uh you know standing up and saying hey what are you guys doing with
[2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:30.120]  with 200 armed troops in the middle of nowhere well let's expand on that we have the full video
[2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:36.600]  at info wars dot com unedited video shows bundy making pro black pro mexican comments and basically
[2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:41.240]  saying what i knew he was going to say when i called him yesterday that no they left one
[2:23:41.240 --> 2:23:47.320]  form of slavery for another but he's saying it sarcastically to get people to talk about it
[2:23:47.320 --> 2:23:52.760]  because he's a straight shooter and then they spend the whole deal and again as if the only thing
[2:23:52.760 --> 2:23:57.560]  that matters even if he was a quote racist they want to paint all property rights or anybody
[2:23:57.560 --> 2:24:02.200]  standing up against tiananmen square style oppression as a racist why don't we just say
[2:24:02.200 --> 2:24:07.080]  the tank man from tiananmen square just say i already was a racist so let's run him over with
[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:16.760]  the tank exactly that is in essence what they are saying is perfect analogy and uh and and we have
[2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:21.880]  to realize wait a minute we're being manipulated here but they're just trying to take the focus
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:27.320]  of what the government is doing to this guy as if they were going after him because he was
[2:24:27.320 --> 2:24:34.600]  a racist you know i mean come on what but uh and and and so uh you know it has they want what they
[2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:39.400]  want to say when i'm plant this feet of doubt wait a minute should i really be getting involved
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:44.120]  with this that's what harry reid wants they want to set the overton window they want to set the
[2:24:44.120 --> 2:24:50.280]  parameters of debate where only what the msnbc says our cnn says the white house talking points
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:55.480]  is the acceptable political discussion they want to demonize him ahead of going after him
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:25:00.040]  and then stamp everyone else with the cliven bundy seal when they go after the next person the
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:06.360]  reason it's such a big deal though these 95 clinton memos is that it shows the authoritarian nature
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:12.280]  of how they wanted to shut you guys down and not let you be known that they were so threatened by
[2:25:12.280 --> 2:25:16.280]  not controlling everything i mean this sounds like something the soviets would come up with
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:21.720]  yeah it really it really was and it continues today the only difference is that from back then
[2:25:21.720 --> 2:25:26.600]  we got this paper trail you know uh we don't have the paper trail yet that's what they're
[2:25:26.600 --> 2:25:32.600]  trying to hide for instance with the you know the abuse of the irs which is something really
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:38.280]  extraordinary now and it's funny to me because at this point you know the media is sort of
[2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:44.760]  backed off uh this this thing even though there's been this email chain that's been leaked out in
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:51.480]  the congressional investigation which virtually is the paper trail that shows wait a minute this
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:56.920]  wasn't just some rogue agents you know and since the maddie who were doing this this was coming
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:02.760]  from the top and that we've got more on that on wnd today but you know sometimes you have to bring
[2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:09.960]  his home personalize it a little bit you know who uh gary aldrich is yes okay you know what he
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:16.200]  he's the head of the patrick henry center been around for a long time he's former fbi agent
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:21.720]  in the white house uh rose the guy that saw them with crack pipes and malin lin on the christmas
[2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:26.440]  tree i've interviewed him that's right and he's got the patrick henry center for individual
[2:26:26.440 --> 2:26:32.040]  freedom but not operating for like 15 years or something you know they took his the tax exempt
[2:26:32.040 --> 2:26:39.400]  status away and the listen to the rationale here that the irs says this is the reason uh
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:46.120]  repeated statements supporting or opposing various candidates by expressing its opinion
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:52.120]  of the respective candidate's character and qualifications now here's a 501 c3 organization
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:27:01.320]  by the way the the specifics they cite was a 2004 column by gary aldrich that was unflattering
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:07.480]  toward john carrey and another one a fundraising letter he very criticized hillary in 2000 for
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:13.160]  those that don't know folks with his tax exemption they buy off speech saying you can't ever have a
[2:27:13.160 --> 2:27:19.160]  view you can't have a anti-abortion group that criticizes a pro-abortion politician that that's
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:25.080]  that's asinine and so the answer is people that you support liberty organizations we don't take
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:30.200]  your money at gunpoint like msnbc with stimulus money or mpr we don't take it like obama doesn't
[2:27:30.200 --> 2:27:35.560]  use it against you we need you to buy our books our videos our products to literally fund us
[2:27:35.560 --> 2:27:40.680]  while we're under hellish attack it really comes down to that folks we are the tip of the spear
[2:27:40.680 --> 2:27:46.680]  world met daily info wars drudge uh let's list some other people patrick henry center who are
[2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:50.680]  some of the others people should support joseph well the western journalism center which i found
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:56.520]  that you know way back uh before wnd is still around under new leadership floyd brown who by the
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:01.640]  way you'll find his fingerprints all over this communication stream of conspiracy commerce
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:07.240]  too because of the things he was doing back then and what was it what were we doing back then
[2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:13.960]  we were trying to find out the truth about the corruption in the federal government
[2:28:13.960 --> 2:28:19.000]  and the clinton administration that was our sin that was what you know put us in the spotlight
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:22.760]  that's what put us under the mic you'd run some of the biggest newspapers in the country and how
[2:28:22.760 --> 2:28:29.480]  dare you try to bring back old-fashioned journalism exactly exactly exactly no they say there's
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:34.360]  they say in there oh my gosh he's investigating vince foster this is the they should be an fbi
[2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:40.840]  investigation of this memo it looks like a criminal uh racketeering meeting you know the
[2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:45.880]  federal government itself conducted three investigations of instant foster as a result
[2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:52.040]  of what we had raised i don't think they ever got to the the bottom of it but the point is if
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:57.000]  there wasn't anything worth investigating why did they have three separate investigations of
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:03.800]  of uh of his death so you know i mean it's it's it's absolutely crazy it's what history is repeating
[2:29:03.800 --> 2:29:09.880]  itself right now uh you know the advantage to being as old as i am is there's nothing new under
[2:29:09.880 --> 2:29:15.880]  the sun we just keep seeing the same tactics uh wheeled out time and time again i know you
[2:29:15.880 --> 2:29:19.480]  got to go but i want to do three minutes on the other side because i've got one big question for
[2:29:19.480 --> 2:29:22.440]  you and i'm gonna ask it now joseph era we're gonna go to break it i want you to come back and
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:27.560]  answer it sure myself you people that have been in this a long time you longer than i we get so
[2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:33.400]  used to the evil we almost become acclimated staring into the abyss as nichi said the danger is not
[2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:39.720]  realizing how epic what you've done is or what drudge has done how epic what info wars has done
[2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:45.480]  and that we really are the only ones standing up against this pure evil this is david against
[2:29:45.480 --> 2:29:54.760]  goliath and people need to energize us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones
[2:29:54.760 --> 2:30:06.120]  and the gcn radio network in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[2:30:06.120 --> 2:30:12.760]  and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what
[2:30:12.760 --> 2:30:18.840]  else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal
[2:30:18.840 --> 2:30:25.480]  government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on
[2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:32.680]  the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas
[2:30:32.680 --> 2:30:38.840]  that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean

[2:33:40.200 --> 2:33:46.440]  but there's a clip from conan the barbarian written by oliver stone the second one's
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:51.000]  really cheesy the first one's really good where a pulse of doom uh it was going around all these
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:57.240]  bad things and a local king played by moxfon sitout calls in conan and he says there comes a
[2:33:57.240 --> 2:34:01.720]  time in your life you don't care about money you don't care about power anymore all you care about
[2:34:01.720 --> 2:34:08.520]  is justice in the future of your children here's everything i've got just go kill pulse of doom
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:16.440]  and my whole life i didn't like bullies my i'm not i'm not some hero folks but i mean i i grew up
[2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:21.000]  going to public school and watch you by sixth grade kids three years older than i was beating up kids
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:25.720]  and i stand up for them and i got beat up a lot but then i learned how to fight back and just from
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:32.760]  you know just just sheer attrition and i mean i take it personal they say my kids belong to them
[2:34:32.760 --> 2:34:37.960]  on msnbc and they say they're coming with forced inoculations in the news today i take it personal
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:42.120]  they're setting up world government i take it personal they want to teach kids two plus two
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:49.880]  equals five that's evil that's all i want i'd do anything to not have the mainline neocons
[2:34:49.880 --> 2:34:54.520]  attack me i'd do anything to not have the msnbc people be so evil and a lot of their viewers
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:35:01.320]  and al sharp in the fbi operative but notice there's good fbi guys exposing evil there's bad ones
[2:35:01.320 --> 2:35:06.280]  it's all good and bad good and evil and joseph era and the final equation i was talking here in the
[2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:11.320]  break and i realized this lately the problem with ron paul the problem world net daily
[2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:17.960]  mat drudge info wars world net daily any of us is we're not narcissists we really do want to fight
[2:35:17.960 --> 2:35:22.600]  the evil we we're not perfect but we really want justice in the future that's what matters
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:27.400]  we're really creeped out and freaked out by it i know you are i've met you in person
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:35.000]  but then we never point out how big we are or how epic it is or that we are literally up against
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:40.920]  this evil takeover i get chills i can't believe i'm in this position my show is unlistenable
[2:35:40.920 --> 2:35:47.560]  half the time i mean literally it's like why me and i know you probably ever think that but at the
[2:35:47.560 --> 2:35:51.800]  same time we just got to be honest with listeners and say listen we're in the ring ladies and gentlemen
[2:35:51.800 --> 2:35:56.680]  with some evil you better financially support us and spread the word about us because as jim
[2:35:56.680 --> 2:36:01.640]  garrison said in the jfk investigation why was he still alive when 200 were killed he said because
[2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:07.160]  i stay in the spotlight what is your comment on that and and i mean how epic this is i mean when
[2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:11.800]  i'm saying these things to you i want the audience to know how real this is do you disagree with what
[2:36:11.800 --> 2:36:17.320]  i'm saying or are you getting chills like i am i'm getting chills i'm getting chills and and here
[2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:23.320]  you know look uh you know i don't want to talk about you know my character i you know but here's
[2:36:23.320 --> 2:36:30.600]  what my motivations are the same as yours do i want to uh get rich and get out and you know
[2:36:30.600 --> 2:36:36.440]  live in a castle and isolate myself as the world goes down the tubes no i've had that opportunity
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:42.600]  alex i've had that opportunity and said no to it uh what i wanted is i want to save this country
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:36:48.680]  i want to you know i want to you know promote liberty i want to you know get us back to the
[2:36:48.680 --> 2:36:54.360]  principles that you know found where this country was founded upon that's real that's what that's
[2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:59.480]  what i want to do and you know and i guess i'll never be able to retire i guess i'll never be
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:05.480]  able to sit back and just you know take it easy and enjoy the fruits of all the hard labor
[2:37:05.480 --> 2:37:10.440]  that i've put out i'm not whining here i'm telling you and i know that you share these
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:18.040]  motivations with me uh you can tell who does and who doesn't very easily i won't go into the criteria
[2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:26.360]  you used but um look why do i come on the ear and stand up for gary oldridge who right now
[2:37:27.320 --> 2:37:32.760]  you know it looks to me like conservatives out there are running as far away from this guy because
[2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:37.720]  he lost his tactics them or didn't that's the susie you stood none of them stand up for decisions
[2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:43.160]  that's the same thing they want to pick us off one at a time alex that's the way that's the way
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:50.280]  they operate that's the way the Stalinist left operates that's why they use the irs to go after
[2:37:50.280 --> 2:37:56.040]  people the most feared agency that gets stopped everyone should stand up and say try to audit me
[2:37:56.040 --> 2:38:01.640]  instead of like like we're gazelles and a lion just grabbed uh gary aldridge so we just let them eat
[2:38:01.640 --> 2:38:06.920]  them right i mean i you know i've known gary aldridge a long time i don't think not like a
[2:38:06.920 --> 2:38:13.240]  you know buddy i go out to dinner with but when i see him under attack i say well i could just
[2:38:13.240 --> 2:38:20.840]  as easily be me and that could just as easily be you know alex jones or mad drudge or if they want
[2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:27.960]  to get you they can get you and that's the that's what they know and that we need to understand
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:32.760]  and what we want to do is one level the playing field we you know they talk about equality
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:38.280]  that's what we want we want to be treated the same equally not to have different standards
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:44.200]  exactly left wingers and right wingers and if we and if we collapse in fear now which you've
[2:38:44.200 --> 2:38:49.960]  not done others haven't done they get everybody don't folks get when you give in to evil and bullies
[2:38:49.960 --> 2:38:56.280]  and tyrants then they get everyone you get prosperity by standing against them a nation
[2:38:56.280 --> 2:39:02.520]  of sheep will be ruled by wolves thomas jefferson i can't wait to have you in studio next week
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:08.280]  joseph ferra final mini question you got another meeting to go to what does your gut tell you my
[2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:13.960]  gut tells me and also the political evidence shows if they were scared of you 20 years ago
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:19.080]  and now look what we've done it's a battle we're holding them back on so many fronts
[2:39:19.080 --> 2:39:25.800]  we're getting ready to beat them not by tyranny but by sheer cultural truth we have our own cultural
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:31.320]  revolution against their malice one we are they know we're beating them that's why they're coming
[2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:38.520]  in with the empire strikes back in game so we've got to have maximum courage maximum honor and and
[2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:43.960]  let the audience know like the alamo falling that defeat became the big victory for texas just like
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:47.880]  a lot of defeats for george washington became victories because they persevered we've got to
[2:39:47.880 --> 2:39:54.360]  have folks ready to know that that that we're in the game big time and we're starting to win
[2:39:54.360 --> 2:39:59.400]  that's why they're doing this do you agree with that statement totally agree couldn't agree on
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:07.480]  more and uh alex uh you know for a long time when i started the world medallion fair years i
[2:40:07.480 --> 2:40:13.640]  thought to myself you know i wonder why nobody else is doing this i wonder why nobody else is
[2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:18.680]  seeing they uh we're having a modest degree of success here why isn't anybody joining the
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:25.560]  prank finally after you know many years there've been info wars there's a bright part of the daily
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:33.640]  callers that you know blend back you know that now we have some other folks out there joining us
[2:40:33.640 --> 2:40:39.800]  and we got to make sure that we don't split hairs with them the other side wants to have a united
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:46.360]  front where's our united front i totally agree when we talk about this every time on the phone or on
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:53.160]  air and sabbage is doing that good for him i mean the attacks and i'm not going to bring it up it's
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:40:57.640]  just beck saying that quote i want a violent revolution and a civil war when i say the opposite
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:41:02.440]  that i'm a racist covering up for bundy i mean maybe you're right maybe he's just doing it out of
[2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:07.400]  fear but it doesn't matter i'm being thrown under the bus here and and and and it's very creepy
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:11.560]  and i'm just glad that you're an honorable person joseph era look forward to seeing you next week
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:16.920]  and i'm glad you're not a coward all right man god bless thank you there goes joseph era of wnd.com
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:23.160]  we already had him coming on about about these clinton files you know target him destroy him bring
[2:41:23.160 --> 2:41:28.360]  him down and you know it's come out a few years ago that i'm on the enemy's list and man they've
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:33.000]  done stuff to me i'm not even going to get into it's just like you tube back it's like
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:41.320]  a seizure with british you too you too i mean i don't deserve this and and and i expect it from
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:51.320]  rachel maddow you know and i'm sick of it i mean these people are evil evil evil we cannot
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:58.120]  compromise with them we cannot negotiate with them because it's all done in bad faith and the
[2:41:58.120 --> 2:42:03.000]  mainline liberals out there are good people i'm not saying go follow george bush and dick cheney
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:07.960]  i'm saying the democratic party right now with obama is taking over everything and trying to end
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:13.160]  the republican party if the democratic party was being extinct that i would be against it we need
[2:42:13.160 --> 2:42:20.040]  three parties four parties not one if if bush would have had his justice department arrest
[2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:26.680]  michael more even though i don't like more his anti-gun i would have run around like a chicken
[2:42:26.680 --> 2:42:36.040]  with my head cut off like i did with denisha suzer when the left is persecuted i stand up against it
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:40.600]  because i'm not about left and right folks i'm about constitution common sense and because
[2:42:40.600 --> 2:42:46.920]  i'm real organically and the system knows i'm real they got everything tapped they are scared of me
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:50.760]  look man i'm just scared you guys are going to win and destroy everything
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:57.160]  i don't want to fight with the new world order i've got to fight you though because i cannot join
[2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:07.000]  with evil i physically can't do it i physically when somebody's choking i go help them we got
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:10.520]  a report we're going to go and overdrive and play that hadn't even air on the news yet where
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:16.920]  john mown saw a naked guy running down the road again on his prozac or whatever and helped him
[2:43:16.920 --> 2:43:21.080]  people thought that was weird they tried to help him he saw a lady's car on fire she was standing
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:24.680]  right next to it he pulled over and said get away from your car people called him a control freak
[2:43:26.600 --> 2:43:31.560]  it's the new virtues caring about nobody well i don't want to live in a family like that i i don't
[2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:36.760]  want to be around people like that i don't i don't understand all this i don't understand dishonorable
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:46.840]  people i saw a video in uh new york with a bunch of black folks on a bus i meant to do a piece
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:51.800]  on it my buddy pat said to me and saw my phone guys i want you to get it and and this thug is
[2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:57.720]  is starting to harass two old black people on canes a man and his wife and suits and i stressed
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:04.440]  on the bus and this big big guy is like threatening him for no reason and then a little black guy gets
[2:44:04.440 --> 2:44:09.240]  up and he's about two thirds the guy's side and was like he's about 45 years old and beats up this
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:15.400]  young thug as soon as he pushes the old man this guy gets up and goes up and beats him up and i just
[2:44:15.400 --> 2:44:20.680]  love that video not the beating up part but how just the good guy absolutely stomps that thugs
[2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:27.160]  button the ground and that's the spirit that's going to save our society because if i see somebody
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:31.000]  pushing an old man for no reason i'm going to stomp their head in the ground and when i'm in the
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  right nobody can it very hard to beat me and it's the same thing for you out there who are good
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:42.840]  you see some i don't want to get in a fight but i see somebody trying to beat up an old man or an
[2:44:42.840 --> 2:44:50.360]  old lady every punch i throw is going to knock your teeth out and break your nose because i'm in
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:55.320]  the right the few fights i wasn't a hundred percent the right i couldn't even fight
[2:44:57.320 --> 2:45:01.560]  and got my butt kicked but every time i was in the right i was unstoppable and i'm not going to
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:05.560]  get into stories but it's it's pretty off the chart and that's what i'm telling you folks what the
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:14.360]  founder of the texas rangers said no man no man who's wrong can stand up against a man who's in the
[2:45:14.360 --> 2:45:20.280]  right who keeps on coming and i'm going to keep on coming to the end i'm not going to stop ever
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:30.600]  you've got my commitment ever i am never backing down i am committed i cannot stop i'm going into
[2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:36.200]  this thing no matter what happens to my family no matter what happens to me no matter what happens
[2:45:36.200 --> 2:45:43.400]  i'm never selling out i'm never giving in i'm never backing down because these people
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:53.240]  we're facing are the ultimate evil let's go to this clip i was talking about with max von
[2:45:53.240 --> 2:46:03.640]  set out from conan the barbarian here it is when the jewels cease to sparkle when the gold loses
[2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:14.440]  its lustre when the throne room becomes a prison and all that is left is a father's love for his
[2:46:14.440 --> 2:46:22.120]  child and that's the short clip it builds up there where he's talking about you know is there a
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:29.400]  dagger such as this for me and i mean it's just the betrayal the culture of scum the culture of
[2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:43.560]  weasels i mean get me away from this that's what it comes down to the big epic battle is here
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:48.600]  ladies and gentlemen and again i'll say it as a listener of this broadcast it spreads the word
[2:46:48.600 --> 2:46:53.160]  that's supportive that's involved we influence congress that's all over the news they're totally
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:57.320]  freaked out they call it the alex jonesification they're like oh you're discredited if you're with
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:03.480]  him because they know folks it's a black arrow what's on this show to the new world order to smog
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:07.400]  the spirit of this broadcast and what we do here
[2:47:09.800 --> 2:47:14.600]  not the fearlessness but a desire to engage the enemy a desire to never back down
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:20.200]  and it's a train wreck a lot of days folks but it's real the enemy knows it's real the spirit of
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:26.280]  this transmission if duplicated if transferred like fire will burn down the new world order
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:28.280]  and restore the republic
[2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:35.000]  we've got john bound's report actually coming up the next segment
[2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:41.000]  with the naked guy running down the road we'll premiere in awesad on it turned out he was on meds
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:45.880]  he'd go off your serotonin reuptake inhibitors is what you do luckily just ran around naked he
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:51.160]  didn't you know hurt anybody uh i haven't seen this video i saw it raw i hope he's blurred this out
[2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:58.040]  okay all right it's done tastefully okay good because i was running around was
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:03.400]  flapping around anyways the whole point is that um
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:11.480]  um i heard what ferris said man i want to see spain i want to see uh
[2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:19.480]  grease i want to see portugal i want to see italy i want to see borah borah i want to go to hawaii
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:25.160]  i mean i just want to spend time with my kids i i just like
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:30.760]  but all i do is fight these people and i'm exhausted a lot of times i'm not even that good at it
[2:48:30.760 --> 2:48:34.120]  i'm like in the arena constantly ladies and gentlemen i'm like stumbling around
[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:41.800]  and just more gladiators just keep coming out of the pit and i mean i don't know all i know is
[2:48:42.440 --> 2:48:44.680]  is that they don't like what we're doing
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:50.600]  i mean if you studied history or even what they say these globalists are bad
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:55.560]  these globalists are evil i said i'd take calls but i won't i'm out of time
