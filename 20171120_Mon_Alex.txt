[00:00.000 --> 00:12.560]  We are on the March, the Empire is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12.560 --> 00:32.520]  Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, volunteered for the MKUltra Mind Control Program.
[00:32.520 --> 00:38.720]  Now I'm not talking about the MKUltra Mind Control Program of Netflix hit show Stranger Things,
[00:38.720 --> 00:48.240]  I'm talking about the real MKUltra Mind Control Program that was carried out on college campuses
[00:48.240 --> 00:55.240]  and other facilities across the country in the late 1960s, from San Francisco, California to Austin,
[00:55.240 --> 01:02.040]  Texas to the Chicago Business School in Chicago, Illinois to Harvard University on the East Coast
[01:02.040 --> 01:09.680]  to MIT. And so you'll hear people say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory that Charlie Manchin was a
[01:09.680 --> 01:14.160]  Satanist or it's a conspiracy theory that Hollywood was into Satanism. That's the headlines,
[01:14.160 --> 01:19.400]  but if you go back to the 60s, there was a law enforcement craze, they called it,
[01:19.400 --> 01:25.000]  that law enforcement was claiming there was all this Satanism. No, there was Satanism,
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.840]  there was massive human sacrifice going on, and it was being done to enter in the new age
[01:30.840 --> 01:39.040]  to have Lucifer exterminate 90% of the world's population and then have humans merge with
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.440]  machines and become the new Godmen. Now I talked about that in my film 10 years ago, Endgame.
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.400]  Suddenly this last week, there were London Guardian, Associated Press, Reuters stories
[01:50.400 --> 01:56.560]  about, oh, this tech head from Google has left to start his new worship, the AI cult,
[01:56.560 --> 02:01.480]  and all these famous people are part of it. Oh, he'll be the leader now. It just came out of
[02:01.480 --> 02:10.280]  nowhere. It's the same plan. It originated in London, England in 1855. It is a long term
[02:10.280 --> 02:16.320]  world government project whose end game is to exterminate the majority of the world population
[02:16.320 --> 02:24.280]  to save the earth. And then they're going to have the enlightened folks move forward,
[02:24.280 --> 02:32.360]  transcend, and I have a stack of it right here. And they just think you're stupid. They
[02:32.360 --> 02:39.480]  just think you're complete and total morons and that you're not going to understand this.
[02:39.480 --> 02:43.840]  This is their religion. This is their program. It's to shut down the family. It's destroy
[02:43.840 --> 02:49.040]  questions. It is to pull down civilization and society just like the French Revolution
[02:49.040 --> 02:58.800]  tried to do. Overthrow decency, overthrow success, overthrow beauty, overthrow honor,
[02:58.800 --> 03:08.760]  desecrated, blaspheming. And every day, there's TV ads saying fathers are bad, masculinity
[03:08.760 --> 03:14.680]  is bad, families are evil. Get rid of them. This is the program. And you've got all these
[03:14.680 --> 03:24.840]  zombie-like acolytes that everybody got to witness this last weekend across the country
[03:24.840 --> 03:32.960]  at more anti-fidemonstrations who can't even talk and just scream and yell and grunt and
[03:32.960 --> 03:43.680]  flip people off. And this is a program. So you hear the same thing out of Charles Manson,
[03:43.680 --> 03:47.240]  the same thing out of Theodore Kaczynski, the same thing out of these guys because they
[03:47.240 --> 03:54.640]  came out of the same colleges. They went to the same college. And Manson was part of a
[03:54.640 --> 04:00.080]  CIA mind control program. He wrote songs with the Beach Boys. He knew most of the big Hollywood
[04:00.080 --> 04:08.520]  stars. He was invited into their houses because he was a bag man for the CIA who was delivering
[04:08.520 --> 04:17.560]  the drugs into the circles to begin the mind control operations. And Hollywood knows this.
[04:17.560 --> 04:22.440]  They've put movies out kind of a modern fiction contemporary, but based back in the 60s and
[04:22.440 --> 04:29.480]  70s in California where it's the FBI that's actually handing out the drugs and the LSD
[04:29.480 --> 04:34.800]  because that's who was actually doing it. But again, it was compartments of the FBI.
[04:34.800 --> 04:41.320]  Jack Parsons in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and all of them having big sex orgies. I mean,
[04:41.320 --> 04:46.240]  this was the end thing to do and they were able to use Satanism and drugs as a program
[04:46.240 --> 04:51.360]  to really take over a lot of civilization and compromise people in human sacrifice.
[04:51.360 --> 04:58.560]  And then it goes into pedophilia. Sharon Tate was married to Roman Polanski. We'll be back.
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.480]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest cutting
[05:03.480 --> 05:11.440]  edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids. One of them is a powerful
[05:11.440 --> 05:17.440]  pro digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[05:17.440 --> 05:24.600]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains
[05:24.600 --> 05:30.760]  in fluorolife advanced restoration. And we also have an every day extremely affordable
[05:30.760 --> 05:37.600]  fluorolife every day maintenance. But all of these are the very cutting edge top of the
[05:37.600 --> 05:44.640]  line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price. That is my goal
[05:44.640 --> 05:50.000]  here is to bring you the very best at the lowest price. When you purchase it and then
[05:50.000 --> 05:55.480]  for store.com, you know, you are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense
[05:55.480 --> 06:05.880]  of our republic and freedom worldwide. The globalist great error is to believe that as
[06:05.880 --> 06:12.920]  they collapse humanity, they end up on top. The truth is, humanity is coming down fast.
[06:12.920 --> 06:37.480]  I'm Alex Jones. Thank you for joining us on this Monday, the 20th day of November, 2017.
[06:37.480 --> 07:01.720]  Now back then, it was really weird and crazy to have somebody on PCP and LSD running around
[07:01.720 --> 07:10.320]  killing beauty queens and coffee baronesses. It was a big, big deal. It was shocking. But
[07:10.320 --> 07:19.400]  nowadays, everybody's crazy. This is the godfather of the Antifa movement. This is the godfather
[07:19.400 --> 07:26.440]  of the modern environmental movement. This is a man that wanted 90% of the world's population
[07:26.440 --> 07:32.040]  to be exterminated by a world government. And a man who wanted to ignite the breakdown
[07:32.040 --> 07:38.040]  of civilization by causing race war, playing different ethnic and religious groups off against
[07:38.040 --> 07:44.880]  each other around the world in a divide and conquer strategy. The truth is, Charlie Manson
[07:44.880 --> 07:51.760]  was inducted into a higher level CIA DARPA mind control program and inserted into the
[07:51.760 --> 07:57.640]  highest levels of rock and roll movies. He knew all the major folks co-wrote songs for
[07:57.640 --> 08:03.480]  the Beach Boys, the list goes on and on and was delivering large amounts of pure weapons
[08:03.480 --> 08:13.200]  grade LSD to campuses all over California. Then the windup toy either went off the rails
[08:13.200 --> 08:19.000]  or was ordered to carry out the murders. We don't know still to this day, but he was CIA
[08:19.000 --> 08:25.440]  100%. They had mind control programs going on right here at the University of Texas in
[08:25.440 --> 08:30.640]  the 60s and at other major universities. Charlie Manson hung around the same university that
[08:30.640 --> 08:37.440]  Theodore Kaczynski, the unabomber, went to and volunteered for the MK Ultra program.
[08:37.440 --> 08:41.560]  It's kind of like volunteering to jump into a hornet's nest because once you're on those
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.160]  drugs, there's no more volunteering. You didn't know what you were getting into. But this
[08:46.160 --> 08:52.520]  is the program. Sex, drugs, luring in the police, luring in the FBI, luring in all
[08:52.520 --> 08:58.800]  the politicians to get dirt on them. What was big and bad and evil in the 1960s to the
[08:58.800 --> 09:04.220]  Puritan America devil worship. But if you could get people to worship the devil to have
[09:04.220 --> 09:13.920]  sex with super hot movie stars, what next it was we need you to kill somebody. And that's
[09:13.920 --> 09:21.320]  what Charlie Manson was about. He was one MK Ultra tentacle that went sideways. And then
[09:21.320 --> 09:26.920]  they used it to create the whole new popular culture where it's so cool to be whacked out
[09:26.920 --> 09:32.720]  of your brain, a shaman who knows everything and can do everything and has got your cult
[09:32.720 --> 09:37.440]  of trendies that go from being hippies to being cold-blooded murders. That's always
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.760]  what it is. First they get you peace and love and nirvana and you can do anything and all
[09:41.760 --> 09:48.600]  of a sudden, but there's a price to pay. There's always a Dracula in the shadows. We can put
[09:48.600 --> 09:52.760]  Sharon Tate up behind me here from one of the horror movies she was in and movies about
[09:52.760 --> 09:57.840]  Satanism and movies about human sacrifice and movies about burning men and movies about
[09:57.840 --> 10:08.440]  the royal Rothschild estates and the estates dying and there's poverty in the village until
[10:08.440 --> 10:15.720]  the owner of the estate is willing to be sacrificed for the good of everyone. I mean this is nothing
[10:15.720 --> 10:24.640]  but French Revolution, Jacobian manipulation. The whole revolution you're seeing is French
[10:24.640 --> 10:35.640]  Revolution part two. They saw we were launching ours in 1776 for the real New Atlantis, for
[10:35.640 --> 10:44.520]  the Francis Bacon, the real Rosicrucian Order, Esoteric Christianity and they created their
[10:44.520 --> 10:50.600]  counterfeit which is just every flavor of rebellion, death, degradation and it's all
[10:50.600 --> 10:55.600]  about psychopathic men being able to have women and others programmed and under their
[10:55.600 --> 11:05.520]  control to do horrible things. And boy Charlie Manson was jealous of the cult above him.
[11:05.520 --> 11:09.680]  He was getting kicked out of that cult. They weren't being nice to him anymore. So what
[11:09.680 --> 11:16.480]  did he do? He went and killed their high priestess. He told people he did too. He went and killed
[11:16.480 --> 11:22.640]  their goddess. He went and killed who they thought was the number one woman in the Hollywood
[11:22.640 --> 11:27.680]  cult of Roman Polanski and others. While he was out of town, they killed her and they
[11:27.680 --> 11:33.200]  killed his baby. They showed him what would happen if Charlie Manson didn't get to stay
[11:33.200 --> 11:38.800]  in the cult. Charlie Manson created a list of people that weren't partying with him anymore
[11:38.800 --> 11:46.160]  and weren't buying his LSD anymore and he went in there and he killed them. And that
[11:46.160 --> 11:56.280]  my friends is the rest of the story of Charlie Little Man Manson. All that stuff he was saying.
[11:56.280 --> 12:03.840]  People were like, wow, this guy is really smart. He's spewing everything that the eugenicists
[12:03.840 --> 12:11.320]  and the globalists have been spewing. That's their religion. Charlie Manson is a whacked
[12:11.320 --> 12:19.400]  out street level con man that they used to go around and control people because he was
[12:19.400 --> 12:27.400]  expendable. He was just one more little power tripping person that thought he was God who
[12:27.400 --> 12:41.840]  wanted to be a cult leader. When all he really was was an icon being created to introduce
[12:41.840 --> 12:46.840]  the second Jacobin revolution inside this country. And see, if you know the group, if
[12:46.840 --> 12:51.320]  you know their religion, if you know their program, overthrow the family, break everything
[12:51.320 --> 12:58.200]  up, then you know why you see the shaving ads out where men are bad. We must stop toxic
[12:58.200 --> 13:03.400]  masculinity. That story is on infowars.com. You know why we're saying you can't say the
[13:03.400 --> 13:08.400]  word mother and father. That's the new word to be banned by Facebook saying it's hurtful.
[13:08.400 --> 13:14.680]  You think I'm joking? They're moving forward with it. Don't be stoic. Don't be a rock.
[13:14.680 --> 13:23.360]  Don't be strong. It actually says in the ad, be weak. It actually says it's time for a
[13:23.360 --> 13:29.920]  new definition of masculinity and we're going to tell you what that definition is. It's
[13:29.920 --> 13:37.200]  a silent ad. You have to go see it at infowars.com. This is their program. This is their operation.
[13:37.200 --> 13:43.000]  Overthrow everything. They've got 25% of the population on psychotropic drugs that are
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.280]  in the hallucinogen class. They've now got weaponized marijuana being put out to the
[13:48.280 --> 13:57.400]  George Soros movement that is hallucinogenic. And I'm not calling for making marijuana illegal.
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.720]  I'm a libertarian. They want to have the dialectic of putting the drugs out and having you use
[14:01.720 --> 14:07.400]  it and putting you in prison. I'm against that. But people need to understand that this
[14:07.400 --> 14:13.360]  is a very, very serious situation and it's part of a larger operation to put you into
[14:13.360 --> 14:20.200]  a near dream state so that you're not really conscious. Row, row, row your boat gently
[14:20.200 --> 14:27.280]  down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily life is but a dream. If I wanted to
[14:27.280 --> 14:34.640]  come on this show and talk to you like they do on NPR to put you into a trance, I could
[14:34.640 --> 14:43.840]  do it. But on purpose, I have a grating voice to get you out of your coma, to shake you
[14:43.840 --> 14:52.240]  free out of it. You know, if I wanted to, I could talk just as sweet and just as pretty
[14:52.240 --> 14:59.040]  as all these fake people, but I don't do that. I let you hear my real voice. And it's everything
[14:59.040 --> 15:04.720]  they hate. It's masculine. It's grating. It's like an alarm in the night. It's like a Marine
[15:04.720 --> 15:10.880]  Corps drill sergeant. But I'm not copying a Marine Corps drill sergeant. Drill sergeants
[15:10.880 --> 15:18.520]  are trying to encompass the classic status of a male instructing people in serious, dangerous
[15:18.520 --> 15:26.360]  things that affect their life so people listen so they understand what's going on. So you've
[15:26.360 --> 15:34.680]  been warned. So if you've got what it takes, you'll listen. If you don't, you were warned.
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.640]  We did our job. Coming up, we got a bunch of clips of Charlie Manson. You'll think you're
[15:39.640 --> 15:45.360]  listening to Al Gore talk, the original SJW and so much more. This is going to be a jam-packed
[15:45.360 --> 15:51.920]  transmission. Newswars.com, prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. It is an act of resistance
[15:51.920 --> 15:57.680]  to the globalist when you hand share those links because we're being totally censored.

[18:00.160 --> 18:04.840]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear
[18:04.840 --> 18:11.240]  the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[18:11.240 --> 18:17.560]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[18:17.560 --> 18:23.120]  of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for
[18:23.120 --> 18:28.840]  quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy
[18:28.840 --> 18:35.200]  our vitality. Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter
[18:35.200 --> 18:42.200]  this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated
[18:42.200 --> 18:48.720]  herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[18:48.720 --> 18:52.880]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our

[18:57.880 --> 19:05.880]  The proper B-vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[19:05.880 --> 19:11.240]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels. With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended
[19:11.240 --> 19:16.360]  amount of B-vitamins we need every day. Up, up, up, up, optimum levels. B-vitamins we
[19:16.360 --> 19:22.560]  need every day. Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[19:22.560 --> 19:28.120]  Up, up, up, up, up, optimal absorption. Being deficient in B-vitamins can cause fatigue,

[20:22.640 --> 20:28.880]  You're listening to InfoWars Live with yours truly, Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining
[20:28.880 --> 20:36.600]  us. Well, Charles Manson is dead and that is the big story around the world. And if
[20:36.600 --> 20:43.480]  you study Charles Manson and the Manson family and what went on there, it was the fact that
[20:43.480 --> 20:52.200]  the entire country at that point had been turned into a CIA mind control laboratory.
[20:52.200 --> 21:04.200]  The universities were being flooded with hallucinogenic drugs. The owners of Time Life and others
[21:04.200 --> 21:15.680]  on the East Coast since the 30s had been taking LSD since it had been discovered in Switzerland.
[21:15.680 --> 21:20.880]  But they were taking a lot of other drugs and these are the most straight-laced, richest
[21:20.880 --> 21:25.400]  people in the country. We go to the history books, they were taking LSD, they've been
[21:25.400 --> 21:33.720]  taking peyote and other witches brews for a long time. But there's a headline right
[21:33.720 --> 21:39.120]  there, the Time and Life of an Acid Trip, How Henry R. Loose and Claire Booth Loose
[21:39.120 --> 21:46.880]  Help Turn America On to LSD. And again, that's the publishers, some of the biggest publishers
[21:46.880 --> 21:54.640]  in U.S. history. So, again, these are old people in suits and ties decades before in
[21:54.640 --> 22:02.800]  the late 30s and of the 40s and 50s taking hallucinogenic drugs, part of cults, part
[22:02.800 --> 22:08.880]  of spiritual cults, and they weren't all devil worshipers. But it was a lot of really heavy
[22:08.880 --> 22:16.080]  stuff. They then developed a plan by the early 60s to flood all the major universities after
[22:16.080 --> 22:21.760]  they tested the drugs on people inside the CIA, inside the military, top generals all
[22:21.760 --> 22:35.080]  took it. They then set out on a plan that had already been set up by the British to
[22:35.080 --> 22:42.440]  set up the world government, then shut down the family, start flooding the population with
[22:42.440 --> 22:48.120]  pharmaceutical drugs, and to come out with pharmaceutical drugs that had you in an LSD
[22:48.120 --> 22:53.880]  state, but you were still somewhat conscious. You weren't seeing hallucinations, but you
[22:53.880 --> 22:58.040]  were in a dream state, but still somewhat conscious in between those two states. And
[22:58.040 --> 23:02.880]  by the way, if you're a radio listener, while I'm talking on the radio, the crew is just
[23:02.880 --> 23:09.080]  typing them what I've said, CIA, flooding the streets with LSD, and we're showing you
[23:09.080 --> 23:13.520]  history channel. We're showing you Associated Press. We're showing you Time Magazine. This
[23:13.520 --> 23:19.920]  is all incontrovertible history. They're San Francisco Chronicle. When the CIA ran an LSD
[23:19.920 --> 23:28.600]  sex house in San Francisco, well, that's just one sex house. And again, ladies and gentlemen,
[23:28.600 --> 23:32.880]  it's really just because the people at the CIA wanted to have whorehouses in every town
[23:32.880 --> 23:38.040]  that were taxpayer paid for that they could enjoy. And a lot of girls were showing up
[23:38.040 --> 23:41.400]  in LA in San Francisco to be movie stars, so they would be there and just pick them
[23:41.400 --> 23:46.320]  off, you know, the Greyhound buses and induct them into CIA operations, use them as sex
[23:46.320 --> 23:54.240]  operatives, you name it. And this is a big story, but Charlie Manson is only just one
[23:54.240 --> 24:00.360]  guy they put into things, and he wrote not just one, but several songs with the Beach
[24:00.360 --> 24:07.560]  Boys and other bands, and he got to know the main Hollywood crew, and he got to learn
[24:07.560 --> 24:11.360]  not just from the CIA and the drugs he was being given, but from all the different cults
[24:11.360 --> 24:17.560]  in Hollywood, how things ran and who really ran the world and what the plan was. So when
[24:17.560 --> 24:23.800]  you hear a guy that probably took LSD over a thousand times, looking completely insane,
[24:23.800 --> 24:29.640]  looking like a cross between a homeless person and a guru, gibbering all this, you say,
[24:29.640 --> 24:38.320]  where does he get it? He got it directly from their battle plan. Yeah, there's the founder
[24:38.320 --> 24:46.800]  of the Beach Boys with Charlie Manson right there. So this was going on. And they had
[24:46.800 --> 24:54.680]  Charlie Manson types who were the gurus over the universities in every city. And again,
[24:54.680 --> 25:01.680]  that was somebody if things went wrong, could be destroyed. And the reason I mention all
[25:01.680 --> 25:04.680]  that is coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play a bunch of clips of Charlie
[25:04.680 --> 25:08.440]  Manson and you're going to go, wait a minute, this is everything the Democrats and Al Gore
[25:08.440 --> 25:16.600]  and Antifa and George Soros says. And then you see Alex Soros and all these parties drugged
[25:16.600 --> 25:20.600]  out of his mind, spewing the same crap and they're carrying some lady in a coffin behind
[25:20.600 --> 25:27.880]  him in one photo, they're spirit cooking. They're doing Alistair Crowley magic, just
[25:27.880 --> 25:35.040]  like Jack Parsons and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory out there in NASA. They literally
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.160]  went and bought the biggest oldest Gothic mansions they could all over the country and
[25:39.160 --> 25:43.600]  had eyes wide shut parties and they got the mayor and they got your daughter and they
[25:43.600 --> 25:49.520]  got your son involved. And that's how they took over. And that's what we're dealing
[25:49.520 --> 25:55.080]  with folks is a bunch of pedophile devil worshipers today, because now it's not sick
[25:55.080 --> 26:00.080]  enough to just, you know, have sex with hot chicks on altars. That's just the entry way
[26:00.080 --> 26:07.000]  into it. It gets much worse, the blood drinking. But that's not enough. You got to ship out
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.600]  factor eight to millions of people with HIV and hepatitis in it and give it to everybody
[26:11.600 --> 26:17.560]  and you got to legalize given blood if you've got HIV in California to spread that that's
[26:17.560 --> 26:22.200]  human sacrifice and you've got to sexualize children in a young age and you've got to
[26:22.200 --> 26:25.720]  give them fluoride and you've got to give them Prozac and you've got to give them Ritalin
[26:25.720 --> 26:34.720]  and you've got to bombard them with GMO. You've got to slowly sacrifice the whole planet.
[26:34.720 --> 26:45.640]  So Charles Manson is a Renfield that blew its gasket and thought it was a Dracula. That's
[26:45.640 --> 26:50.840]  the best thing. We know he worked for the CIA and other groups that was protected and
[26:50.840 --> 26:56.160]  he blew a gasket and thought he was Dracula. He thought he was the big powerful leader.
[26:56.160 --> 27:02.240]  He thought he was in charge. He thought he was the big Lucifer and he was going to launch
[27:02.240 --> 27:08.920]  the big global meltdown and the worldwide extermination and you go out to these Antifa
[27:08.920 --> 27:14.920]  parades and they all men and women look just like him. They're crazed. They got an evil
[27:14.920 --> 27:19.280]  spirit in them and all they want to do is hang you up by your toes and rip your guts
[27:19.280 --> 27:27.600]  out and roll around and hit them on the ground. They can murder a pregnant beauty queen, murder
[27:27.600 --> 27:35.040]  one of the favorite girls of Dracula. Then that kind of makes you Dracula, doesn't it?
[27:35.040 --> 27:39.960]  And that's why he's praised by the lower level minions because they in the psychopathic
[27:39.960 --> 27:43.720]  order want to be Dracula, you see. They want to be the archetypal Dracula of the Prince
[27:43.720 --> 27:50.200]  Charles, the direct line of Dracula. They want to be on the throne and you know what?
[27:50.200 --> 27:59.640]  This little Renfield, he killed one of Dracula's winches. That makes him a big man. We come
[27:59.640 --> 28:12.200]  back. The SJW grandfather, the LSD CIA MK ultra monkey boy, Charles Manson, ladies and

[29:59.480 --> 30:04.040]  America is an information based civil war. That's why now more than ever we've got to
[30:04.040 --> 30:09.000]  hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their
[30:09.000 --> 30:15.240]  bullying. We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[30:15.880 --> 30:21.160]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate
[30:21.160 --> 30:27.800]  is truly the counter culture. The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America,
[30:27.800 --> 30:33.640]  pro-capitalism and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is
[30:33.640 --> 30:39.320]  a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberalists.
[30:39.320 --> 30:43.720]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends and promote freedom worldwide.

[32:56.440 --> 33:12.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:12.360 --> 33:31.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[33:31.880 --> 33:50.680]  radio network. Well Charlie Manson's dead and his death gives us a window
[33:52.840 --> 33:56.840]  and his life gives us a window into how the globalist operate and what their program is.
[33:56.840 --> 34:07.880]  And if you go back to again ancient Japan just with sex and opium they had different
[34:07.880 --> 34:14.440]  schools of assassins where people would volunteer to want to be part of the different societies.
[34:14.440 --> 34:19.560]  One of them was the ninja it's not just in Hollywood movies who would then go kill a high
[34:19.560 --> 34:25.160]  profile target after generally a decade of training after being accepted and then would
[34:25.160 --> 34:32.440]  commit sepicoob after they killed the person they were targeting because then you couldn't
[34:32.440 --> 34:41.960]  tell who carried out the murder. Now that was with opium and sex. Can you imagine what the
[34:41.960 --> 34:48.840]  Luciferians the psychopaths can do with the high tech drugs and now microchips and electroshock
[34:48.840 --> 34:56.280]  and things that are way, way, way, way, way past the things that have been declassified.
[34:56.280 --> 35:03.960]  Then they have hit TV shows like Stranger Things that takes real programs and exactly how they do it
[35:04.600 --> 35:10.280]  telling folks you're doing a drug trial test and nine months later you know they cut your baby
[35:10.280 --> 35:15.080]  out of you and say that there was a miscarriage and then induct your child into mind control from
[35:15.080 --> 35:24.680]  the day it's born. Skinner and a bunch of these other top psychologists and psychiatrists famously
[35:24.680 --> 35:35.000]  would do things like raise their own kids in cages but it was okay because it was called research
[35:35.800 --> 35:42.600]  and all it is is psychopaths and hundreds of different programs being funded to develop new
[35:42.600 --> 35:55.000]  technologies over the mind, over the body and now you see how Pavlovian it is that oh when you
[35:55.000 --> 36:02.840]  get an update from Facebook or Twitter there's a ding on your phone and it's all been Pavlovianly
[36:02.840 --> 36:07.720]  tested the perfect little ding, the perfect little vibration, the perfect colors, the way it's
[36:07.720 --> 36:15.000]  presented to give you a dopamine rush and then the head engineers go on television and tell Ted Talk
[36:16.600 --> 36:23.240]  we're abusing people we're mind controlling them and this is only phase one why would they tell you
[36:23.240 --> 36:29.960]  that it's not because they're so good it's because there's metaphysical rules they follow
[36:29.960 --> 36:38.040]  where they believe they have to tell you what they're doing to you or karmically it comes back
[36:38.040 --> 36:48.040]  on them so they will warn you hi I'm Count Dracula can you invite me into your house you know you
[36:48.040 --> 36:54.760]  really shouldn't invite people in you don't know but would you invite me in well sure you seem like
[36:54.760 --> 37:02.840]  a nice fella what twinkly eyes you have come on in now he can come back any time he wants
[37:03.480 --> 37:07.720]  that's why there's all these articles admitting screen time is mesmerizing you screen time is
[37:07.720 --> 37:14.440]  lowering your IQ screen time is putting you into a mesmerized close to sleep state oh there's all
[37:14.440 --> 37:22.200]  these big mainstream articles five yg five g all this stuff is literally frying it definitely gives
[37:22.200 --> 37:27.080]  you cancer but it's okay we're going to put them in every classroom we're going to put them in your
[37:27.080 --> 37:31.320]  house we're going to put them in all the new appliances in all the new cars where you won't
[37:31.320 --> 37:37.160]  have a choice and we're going to track you in real time we're going to tax you we're going to
[37:37.160 --> 37:46.440]  control you and we're going to oscillate the five g waves the DARPA about 17 years ago in the
[37:46.440 --> 37:52.120]  baltimore sun just had the craziest article interviewing DARPA going yeah we're putting
[37:52.120 --> 37:58.920]  up towers in in in maryland just on the cell towers and that are going to send out some waves
[37:58.920 --> 38:04.600]  some some some some higher waves higher powered waves just testing that could look at calming
[38:04.600 --> 38:10.200]  the public in the future and the article went on DARPA created the internet and they're good people
[38:10.200 --> 38:16.600]  in the advanced laboratories and it's just and that was a test put it in the newspaper you open
[38:16.600 --> 38:24.760]  the newspaper up one time they admitted they put oscillators in the cell towers dick
[38:27.560 --> 38:32.280]  they've got studies out on what you can do with these systems birds will just fall out of trees
[38:32.280 --> 38:38.280]  and won't care if ants eat them they can make you just go to sleep flip the switch everybody just
[38:38.280 --> 38:43.400]  whoa lies down you don't think the pentagon doesn't want those type of weapons and you don't think
[38:43.400 --> 38:48.200]  the globalists that put fluoride in the water and all the rest of stuff to hurt us wouldn't use that
[38:48.200 --> 38:52.360]  and that's they know we know about fluoride now and the adjuvants in the water and they're moving
[38:52.360 --> 38:56.440]  away from that program because they know most of you're filtering your water and they're going to
[38:56.440 --> 39:02.440]  electromagnetic just like dr nick baggages said we should get back on the show very very soon he
[39:02.440 --> 39:09.960]  said forget the chemicals alex that's the child's play because they have to you know get into your
[39:09.960 --> 39:18.120]  body they're going with 5g technology he said this 15 years ago but don't worry la times just
[39:18.120 --> 39:26.120]  says slight increase in tumors no big deal slight my butt
[39:26.120 --> 39:34.280]  3g is so strong that it can look through walls when it's bouncing back at its receiver
[39:35.000 --> 39:42.680]  5g can give you total color through multiple structures and they it's been on helicopters
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.480]  for decades flying around looking through your walls they had particle beams 30 years ago mounted
[39:47.480 --> 39:54.200]  on helicopters flying around frying people they used it in the Panama attack they got everything
[39:54.200 --> 39:57.720]  and there's this whole walled off civilization
[40:03.000 --> 40:08.120]  that now is growing to the point of emerging and when the global government emerges when
[40:08.120 --> 40:12.680]  this emerges that means everybody starts dying see it's been being it's being built
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.240]  siphoning off our resources taking control of us dumbing us down playing us off against each other
[40:17.240 --> 40:24.440]  for decades and decades and decades but now it's going to the point where it's about to be born and
[40:24.440 --> 40:29.000]  just like an alien from the movie alien it's been laid in your stomach it's been feeding off you
[40:29.000 --> 40:36.520]  inside now when it comes out you die we die when it's born we die that's their religion we have to

[41:34.440 --> 41:38.600]  and if you're conscious of the engineering we can stop it together and be aware of it but it's
[41:38.600 --> 41:42.120]  all being rolled out by the tech giants they announced this weekend they're going to have a
[41:42.120 --> 41:47.320]  one-world religion based on worshiping AI and everyone will have to submit to it other religions

[47:33.320 --> 47:40.680]  you so much for joining us okay let me get right back into the news so the scientific elite starting
[47:40.680 --> 47:48.760]  in the 1850s in britain with the main governing system of the world at that time being the british
[47:48.760 --> 48:00.440]  empire made the decision to establish world government true world government not just empire
[48:00.440 --> 48:05.880]  and they decided to use science to do it and always be so ahead of everybody else that they
[48:05.880 --> 48:17.160]  couldn't be defeated not just militarily but culturally where there aren't any families anymore
[48:17.160 --> 48:26.120]  people are programmable that's the final revolution is what the globalist technocrats call it and
[48:26.120 --> 48:33.240]  they've written books they've written white papers they have conferences they had a consensus 160 years
[48:33.240 --> 48:49.000]  ago this plan was publicly launched 170 something years ago and they had a consensus
[48:51.080 --> 48:57.240]  just a decade later and so that's why i'm so frustrated what i'm telling you is what they've
[48:57.240 --> 49:02.520]  said that's why when you hear charlie manson you go that sounds like ted turner or that sounds
[49:02.520 --> 49:07.000]  like bill clinton or that sounds like al gore or that sounds like lord rothschild or that sounds
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.560]  like prince philip or that sounds like prince charles because that's what their religion is
[49:11.560 --> 49:17.240]  your animals you need to die there's too many people but then they grease the skids to make
[49:17.240 --> 49:24.040]  us as dumb down as possible to make that a self-fulfilling prophecy and they drug us and
[49:24.040 --> 49:27.960]  they poison us and they do everything they can paul watson has the article on info wars.com
[49:27.960 --> 49:33.640]  charles manson the eco warrior who wanted to kill humans to save the earth
[49:35.720 --> 49:40.760]  notorious cult leader wanted to wipe out 50 million to stop the polar ice caps melting
[49:40.760 --> 49:47.400]  remember the global warming al gore stuff this was all on the universities then when nobody
[49:47.400 --> 49:53.320]  else had even heard it yet it was a cosmology they were formulating and they were drugging
[49:53.320 --> 49:59.960]  the best minds of the best families coming in into a new age cult they thought of the christ
[49:59.960 --> 50:05.080]  energy and right behind that was a bunch of social engineering psychotics that just like
[50:05.080 --> 50:09.240]  to sacrifice people have sex with the best looking women and be pedophiles
[50:11.720 --> 50:16.120]  but you saw that in roman paulanski's wife when he wasn't off raping little kids
[50:16.120 --> 50:20.840]  charlie manson dropped by the killer
[50:24.600 --> 50:30.360]  because she was their golden girl sharing tape i've researched it they loved her boy
[50:30.360 --> 50:35.640]  the illuminati loved her loved her a lot
[50:35.640 --> 50:47.160]  so that's what this is all about and if you want this type of scum running your life
[50:47.160 --> 50:51.160]  then go ahead and drink the fluoride take the microchips give your kids the smartphones all
[50:51.160 --> 50:58.440]  day because this is their plan they're carrying it out they are executing it a satanic one world
[50:58.440 --> 51:04.120]  government computer run system where it's illegal to be a christian they said that in in five or
[51:04.120 --> 51:09.000]  six publications yesterday they said oh the new ai god it'll be against the law to be superstitious
[51:09.000 --> 51:17.000]  or believe in imaginary gods you're gonna worship our ai or you're gonna die and it's gonna run your
[51:17.000 --> 51:25.640]  life oh but this young tech guy whose family was cia and whose family were us diplomats
[51:25.640 --> 51:31.240]  he just went decades ago and won an award with darpa and then went to work for google
[51:31.240 --> 51:36.840]  that's the that's the guy who's behind the new ai cult same story with zuckerberg i mean it's
[51:36.840 --> 51:41.720]  they're just frontmen to make it look oh our little american whiz kid just came up with this
[51:43.400 --> 51:47.560]  you know they got charlie mansons to pass out the drugs and then they got the zuckerbergs to
[51:47.560 --> 51:52.120]  make it all cool and fun at the university he's like something he came up with when it's all
[51:52.120 --> 51:58.520]  run by these people so there's a lot of these clips and they're posted on info wars dot com
[51:58.520 --> 52:05.560]  and paul watson's powerful article but you've heard all this before from allen gordon everybody
[52:05.560 --> 52:11.880]  else but here it is from charles manson charles manson heraldo revera there's an interview from
[52:11.880 --> 52:17.880]  back in the 80s you can find mansons saying this stuff in court you know in 1970 1971 when he was
[52:17.880 --> 52:22.760]  convicted where was he getting it well he was hanging out the same colleges theodore kasinski
[52:22.760 --> 52:29.160]  and the mk ultra program they admit he was in the mk ultra program folks so here it is charles manson
[52:30.040 --> 52:34.680]  no reality is they did what they did they're responsible for their own actions i'm responsible
[52:34.680 --> 52:40.760]  for my actions ever kill anybody i've come off a close few times come on didn't you come on didn't
[52:40.760 --> 52:45.560]  you man i ain't lying to you if you think i'm lying to you wasting my time in your time okay let's
[52:45.560 --> 52:52.040]  not lie let's pick no reason to stay there's no reason why are you guilty of that i'm guilty of um what
[52:52.040 --> 52:57.640]  am i guilty of i'm guilty of thinking that i had rights in a courtroom that's what i'm guilty of
[52:57.640 --> 53:02.680]  thinking when my father's died in all the mother wars i thought man i just stand in the courtroom
[53:02.680 --> 53:08.600]  and tell the judge it'd be all over 15 20 minutes i'm busy i got some appointments and it started
[53:08.600 --> 53:14.360]  making money and when it started making money whoa they had money takes precedence they're going to
[53:14.360 --> 53:18.600]  put me down on the ground for the money as long as they make the money they don't care who did it
[53:18.600 --> 53:25.480]  who did it's not important and if i had done it it'd be worse than if than if i hadn't it considered
[53:25.480 --> 53:32.200]  i don't understand yeah well consider i tell you like this yeah i i chopped up nine hauls and i'm
[53:32.200 --> 53:36.520]  going to chop up some more of your mother i'm going to kill you as many as i can i'm going to pile
[53:36.520 --> 53:42.440]  you up to the sky i figured about 50 million if i could get about 50 million i might be able to save
[53:42.440 --> 53:47.960]  my trees and my air my water my wildlife do i tell 50 million people well that's that's just a drop
[53:47.960 --> 53:54.040]  in the bucket to what's really coming that's just a drop in the bucket it was really coming
[53:56.520 --> 54:01.560]  and we know bio weapon plague releases you name it you've got electromagnetic systems you can flip
[54:01.560 --> 54:06.120]  the switch people just go to sleep there'll be a bunch of skeletons they got to come in
[54:06.120 --> 54:12.920]  in a few months and clean up they'll just have to secure the nuclear reactors and some of those
[54:12.920 --> 54:17.640]  other facilities and they're gearing up for that they're gearing up for it so just know if we can't
[54:17.640 --> 54:22.520]  stop them and you're seeing a billion die in one week and and nuclear war starts and a bunch of
[54:22.520 --> 54:27.560]  stuff kicks off no they did it all they're in their bunkers and you know what you deserved it
[54:28.360 --> 54:31.320]  because they've been gearing up they've been getting ready and what do you say you said
[54:31.320 --> 54:36.520]  europeans are evil europeans are bad europeans have to be done away with what do the globalists say
[54:36.520 --> 54:42.760]  today that's just dominant globalist europeans wanting to get rid of their competition it's
[54:42.760 --> 54:48.680]  helter skelter they want global race war and they want to put europeans back up against the wall
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.760]  getting a bunch of outside groups trying to kill them so a lot of the europeans will then accept
[54:52.760 --> 54:56.440]  the extermination program that's going to kill everybody who isn't white
[54:56.440 --> 55:03.080]  and you've got the asian groups and folks working with the globalists you know deciding who's
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.000]  going to be on what team you got the chinese developing race specific bio weapons and that's
[55:07.000 --> 55:13.000]  all aimed at us and this is serious business and i've got a bunch of other clips charles

[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.600]  they're gonna have when we play the clip of him wanting a one-world government uh here he is talking
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:17.720]  about man-made global warming in 1987 here's charles manson try to stop the jep non-war
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:26.040]  and i did it and all the things i did i did without breaking the law because your law 1776
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:30.760]  you got jet airplanes going six thousand miles an hour and you're reading books that was written on
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.320]  the back of horses why don't you tell the public what's really going on why don't you tell them
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.720]  the water so bad the fish can't live in it well don't you tell them that the polar caps are melting
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:44.680]  because you're creating so much heat with this machine you see what i'm saying 1987 interview
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:51.960]  he steadfastly refused to admit guilt or show any remorse for his actions you won't face the fact
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:57.400]  that there's a holy war moving upon the planet earth you couldn't see the blood splattered all over
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:03.640]  the walls now you say you want to blame one guy for it i've seen it i witnessed it go by
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:09.400]  i've seen the children what they were trying to do and i was sympathetic with them but you
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:15.800]  might say i'm a devil in this respect that i never broke will or entered into any one circle
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:22.440]  with breaking will in any respect whatsoever i just watched this flow downstream from your words
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.720]  as mr emin's quotes him in this book it's clear that you were guilty of murder and yet he says
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:33.080]  in all his conversations with you he never heard you express remorse have you never felt it
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:38.840]  remorseful what you people have done everything in the world to me doesn't that give me equal
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:44.120]  right i can do anything i want to you people at any time i want to because that's what you've
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.400]  done to me if you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth and throw me in solitude confinement
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.880]  for nothing what do you think's gonna happen when i get out of here what do you think's
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:03:01.640]  gonna happen to you the things that you create in here here that was so there you go if you
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.040]  go out on the street and look at the ante for people or you look at the average leftist at
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.360]  the hillary event that we just set a nice reporter out to cover and they were in her face screaming
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.040]  in her attacking her flipping her off grabbing the microphone they all have that trashiness to
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.840]  that that that stupidity to them that glaze in their eyes there's nothing there they're just kind
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:29.240]  of broadcasting the corrupt spirit of the world they're not themselves and you notice that people
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.720]  like charles manson says i can do whatever i want he's saying he's one of the elite he can kill
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:40.280]  whoever he wants he can stab and murder whoever he wants because he's charles manson
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.440]  and then he points out though well you guys have done a lot more than i've done
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:54.840]  he's talking about the power structure itself but the truth is charles manson learned about
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:00.520]  all this stuff because he was hanging around on those universities where the cia mind control
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:06.440]  programs were going on and he was recruited into it to be one of the bag men and that's come out
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.280]  congressional hearings that's come out in the research they had tons of these guys all over
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:16.760]  the country and all of the world to create this new counterculture that looked cool to get all
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:23.480]  the young people to adopt a program of counterculture that the social engineers have come up with
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:29.400]  and now after the free love and the sex and the partying now it's oh the sex is bad mothers and
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:35.000]  fathers are bad humans are bad here just take this brain chip they're moving us on to the next
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.320]  phase and i've seen government documents some of them are in charlotte israelis deliberate
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:44.920]  dumbing down from the department of education where it actually shows graphics about they first
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.120]  make you a rebellious and then then they turn you into this into that and finally you're a zombie

[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:39.000]  ladies and gentlemen hollywood Babylon has absolutely poisoned our country and poisoned the world
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:47.640]  it has been a weaponized culture system to attack families to attack civilization to attack our
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:55.080]  sovereignty and now it's in a lot of trouble imploding in on itself but Charles Manson is dead
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:00.520]  part of an mk ultra mind control program we're going to be talking about that more coming up at
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:05.720]  the bottom of the hour also google launches colossal censorship a disinformation campaign
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:11.880]  under the dead of night men's shaving company attacks toxic masculinity and new ad
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:19.240]  says being strong being honorable being stoic is bad stop it this is the total demoralization
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:25.560]  and then the big news that i'm going to cover again after our guest leaves us experts were
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.400]  predicting over the weekend a great crash of 2018 will start in the bond market
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:37.160]  today the euro crashed massively with angela merkel's fourth term as chancellor in doubt
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:44.200]  and her plan to flood europe with islamicist as us growth forecaster on the rise i've talked to top
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:49.960]  globalist on air and off air former top globalist and i've been in contact with other over the years
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:55.000]  people that are high up billionaires you name it and they filled me in a lot of things saying that
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.960]  i was basically dead on about what was happening and who had told me like i just see it really isn't
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:09.800]  in the news but you you can follow the trends and the different angles the globalist made a deal
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:16.600]  with euro and with china to deindustrialize the us as a political system of control and implode us
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.560]  and turn us into a third world country just like they've done to south africa
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:27.240]  and trump and others are battling that and so it's not just like hey we're fighting to get the
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.720]  economy up and keep the stock market propped up as a bubble just because that's fun because it is
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.920]  unhealthy long term but we're in a financial war now we have to keep it propped up until the euro
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:42.360]  implodes because it's a cancerous authoritarian system that is opening the borders to carry out
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:48.280]  the cultural genocide against christians and whites and again the minorities coming in aren't
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:56.040]  even the enemy it's the globalist directing at all and they admit it now the reason this all dovetails
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:06.520]  in is because it's a planetary plan and we have simon roche on who is a prominent activist
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:14.520]  and individual who's been exposing the massive white genocide in south africa in zimbabwe uh in
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:19.960]  many of these other african countries where everybody's now basically starving to death and
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:26.040]  they have epic weimar republic inflation because they've driven any infrastructure out
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:33.080]  it's just a thing of conquest so south africans hold black monday protest over white farmer
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:39.640]  murders that's newsweek murders of white farmers spark protested south africa that's cbs news
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:45.880]  epidemic of south african farm murders continues as gunmen shoot elderly victims dead now these
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:51.480]  are groups of a and c connected black communists doing it so the whole black lives matter thing
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.480]  it's like international and you've got a lot of other black groups saying we don't want this this
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:01.000]  is terrible but look at zimbabwe and i'm not the expert like this gentleman zimbabwe where you've
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.080]  got robert maghabi and all the rest of it has basically killed all the white farmers tens of
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:12.120]  thousands they're all gone the few that stayed have all been killed okay so what you see in zimbabwe
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:17.320]  is not going to be south africa and this is directed this is planned and we've got an expert on
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:28.040]  to go over that information for us simon roche is head of the office of hq of the world's largest
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:33.800]  non-state civil defense organization and i'm not gonna i'm gonna pronounce it right uh shulanders
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:39.560]  of south africa once an a and c activist he now works tirelessly to prepare for impending catastrophe
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:45.320]  in the rainbow nation simon lives in johannesburg and it's the proud father of many children and
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.440]  we'll probably have to go 40 after so if he can because i've got him a little bit late because
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.840]  this is so important to break down we can also show how they first disarmed everybody and now
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:58.840]  they're able to kill them and how the government basically goes along with this so it's s u i d l a
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:06.920]  n d e r s and folks it is total breakdown of civilization there uh this is happening and
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.760]  so you're going to see the whole continent now basically collapse libya has been destroyed by
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.280]  the globalists now they're going to bring down south africa using their race-based
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:20.360]  communist narrative uh simon roche you're the expert uh so i i just gave my gestalt snap shot
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:27.000]  from america was that accurate or was that inaccurate no that's just about accurate for a
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.480]  long time we've been uh predicting these things uh we're not high bound by doctrine as many people
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.600]  are you know they're supposed to conform to the narrative of the new south african rainbow nation
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:45.400]  our organization st london's the largest of its kind in the world as you said uh operates on facts
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:51.160]  statistics data true information and it is very much the way that you've described is an ongoing
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:59.240]  decline in south africa particularly or southern africa and it is indisputably driven by globalist
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:06.120]  capital forces that's beyond any sort of doubt we can go to your website to see examples of the
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:11.640]  carnage the murder the death of people that don't know can you describe the the forces in south africa
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:18.360]  well the the south african political scene is dominated by the african national congress
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:25.640]  government of nelson-mandela fame they are now challenged very heavily for their original
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:34.440]  political territory by a linenist stalinist political party called the economic freedom
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:41.480]  fighters whose leader very famously in recent months has said that blacks should invade white farms
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:46.920]  with the spear in the hand he's also the guy who said on the 7th of november last year that
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:54.360]  he's not calling for the slaughter of all whites yet and as a very very influential tribal leader
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:01.160]  in south africa said to me simon in english or european idiom that could mean many things
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:07.640]  in african idiom that means only one thing he's telling his supporters that at some point but
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:14.200]  not now he is going to call upon them to slaughter all of the whites and they should prepare for it
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:19.880]  whether people like that or not that's that's the reality um that we're facing at the moment and it
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:28.040]  gets worse and worse you know the african national congress elix maintains its mccorn tour west seas
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:33.400]  where spear of the nation armed wing so it's probably the only political party in the world
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:39.160]  that besides being the governing force and having a defense force also has its armed wing and the
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:45.000]  head of of the armed wing the mccorn tour west seas where in our largest most populous province
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.600]  said a few months ago that it is now time for young blacks to go to training camps in the bush
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.680]  in south africa to learn to kill whites in a civil war so those are the main parties the
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.520]  extreme left party the the a and c and then of course there's the the minor white population of
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.480]  about eight and a half percent which and we believe that we are going to be on the receiving end of
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:15.560]  this now for those that again haven't studied the different topography in the different areas you've
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:23.160]  got the quasi communist government before and i guess it's just getting more and more radicalized
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:29.080]  by its far left and i read their own plans and their own statements and the people being murdered
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:35.320]  every day now and the riots and the the looting of the infrastructure and it sounds just like
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:41.960]  what anti-fun black lives matter and the sorrows funded groups are doing over here it's it's very
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.760]  similar the similarities are terrific i've just spent six months in the usa going from one end
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:54.280]  to the other over 27 000 miles worth of driving visiting decent respectable bright-eyed fresh
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.200]  face very nice people um to talk with them about this problem and to endeavor to raise funds because
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:07.160]  we we are very very close to a crisis and we need to very urgently get whatever we're going to talk
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.160]  about that we're going to talk about your emergency we're going to about your emergency plan because
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.520]  again some people are just saying hey you should just leave well a lot of people you can't leave
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.600]  a lot of countries won't take you but i mean explain what's happening there when we come back from
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:26.680]  break and the emergency plan because as you said already south africa is one of the highest crime
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.640]  rates in the world it's collapsing the populations are just killing each other in mass uh people
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:36.680]  believe if you rape a baby if you have hiv that it makes you well i mean it's just descending
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:45.160]  back into absolute barbarism and i gotta ask you why not just evacuate and then it's very sad these
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.880]  folks will all just kill each other for whatever reason it's it's very very sad we'll be right back
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.880]  stay with us
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:00.520]  katie armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market

[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:30.200]  simon rush is the head of the office of the hq of the world's largest non-state civil defense
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:37.880]  organization in south africa and in many other countries once communists take over or leftists
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:44.520]  take over they slowly isolate the whites put them basically in controlled areas farm ghettos
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:50.680]  and then start exterminating them that's now accelerated in south africa it's been basically
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:56.200]  complete in zimbabwe tens of thousands of whites killed the leftist media and the west celebrates
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:01.640]  it they teach at major universities it's good and now the second most powerful party in south
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:07.560]  africa is set to take power openly saying they will kill every white left eight percent of the
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:13.400]  population in south africa now you can say we'll just get out of there well a lot of western
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:17.720]  countries won't take people out of south africa in fact that's kind of a un globalist thing is
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:22.920]  they don't want whites going to nations that had whites this is a globalist attack on whites run
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:29.720]  by elite whites uh in in every case so you have to ask yourself flood countries with non whites
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:35.720]  and then say whites get out well you can argue you know obviously africa whites colonize that
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:40.760]  but the issue is globalists are now reverse colonizing using third world populations to flood
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:46.680]  first world nations to drive down wages and then exploit those countries so once the whites are
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.800]  all out of south africa which has already happened in other countries it's going to fully collapse
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:56.280]  that's my view on it talk about your emergency plan simon and just how dire the situation is and
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.520]  tell the folks here in the u.s. and around the world what it's like to be there because i know
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:05.320]  they've taken most your guns in the last decade or so and of course now that's accelerated the
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:13.320]  white genocide yeah absolutely the the best source on this is dr gregory stanton of a genocide watch
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.280]  of washington dc who's written extensively about this and there's nobody in the world who compares
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:25.160]  to him as an expert on genocide and he said that clearly we are heading towards an open genocide
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:30.840]  um i think that the key thing for people to understand elix is is the is the statistics
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:37.400]  rather than the sentiment the opinion you know the reality is that the chances of a white farmer
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:43.560]  in south africa being murdered on his farm are more than double the chances of a policeman in
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:50.200]  this violent society being killed now when a man who kills the soil stands more than twice the chance
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.760]  of a crime fighter in a violent society dying then you know that there's something wrong
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:00.440]  the the statistical likelihood of a white person being murdered by a black person in south africa
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:09.720]  is more than 12 000 higher than any black person in the usa ever stood of being lynched we're not
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:15.000]  condoning lynching we're saying get a sense of perspective the persecution of whites in africa
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.680]  the persecution of whites in africa is larger than persecution statistically that's been done
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:29.560]  to blacks in this country by more than 12 000 that's correct continue well our national emergency
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:34.920]  plan is an entirely peaceful plan we're non insurrectionist non seditionist we're not here
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:42.440]  to cause trouble we're here to look after innocent women children and non able-bodied people and the
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:49.000]  elderly we're here in the event of an open civil war in this country a race-based civil war such
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.280]  as black leaders have been promising us particularly since august of last year when our former judge
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:59.080]  president said that we're staring a race-based civil war in the in the face and so on and so forth
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:06.120]  over over the intervening year um we are here to protect ordinary people to prepare to look
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.240]  after white people in the event of the civil war that we are being promised by black leaders
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:17.640]  it's a national emergency plan it extends over the entire country it has been in place since 2006
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.440]  we are prepared and by the way you know it's going to happen this is happening and how many other
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:27.480]  african countries i can think of four in the last 50 years that it starts the exact same way
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:33.320]  and then all of a sudden everybody's wiped out yeah absolutely that's that's the way it's done
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:38.680]  and the irony of it is that it's not driven by those people they are driven by an ideology that's
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:45.320]  given to them by somebody else you know this is my next point charlie manson just died he pushed
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.400]  this whole kill the white thing because the university taught him why are the big banks
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.800]  why are the mega rich funding this this this ideology and tell us what the ideology is
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:25:02.200]  this the ideology is a form of communism but ultimately what it comes down to is an anti
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.880]  european christian tradition that's fundamentally what it comes down to if you see what's being
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:14.680]  done in the world today it's being directed at christian conservative europeans ultimately
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:20.200]  we are the people for whatever reason it may be whether it's in north america or in europe
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:26.760]  who are on the receiving end of this relentless assault against our culture traditions religion
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:33.320]  history and our dignity and our pride this is a consistent thing well it's because the new global
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:38.920]  systems coming in and it wants to erase any system that won't be absorbed and that's strong and and
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.320]  that's why it's been directed by george soros he admittedly is directing a lot of the south africa
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:50.200]  stuff well elix you know our leader and founder garba the name of gustav miller has been writing
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:55.960]  about this and talking about this for nearly 20 years and for a long time people thought that he was
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.480]  you know or off his tree or however you like to put it that he was crazy but over time it's become
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:06.520]  more and more and more and more and more conspicuous and thank god for that because it validates us
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.400]  and we don't look like the crazies anymore thank god for what's happening in the usa and what's
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:17.240]  happening in europe because now we're in a position to say to people hey don't trust us trust your own
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:23.160]  eyes look look look what's being done and to whom it is being done and who is driving it in the end
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:32.040]  this liberal liberalist post-modernist moral relativist humanist assault on everything that
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:38.440]  is moral absolutist on everything that is firm and that is fixed is now pervasive it's jacobin
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.880]  french revolution it's this very same ideology it's never been cut it's never been uh totally
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:51.720]  defeated it just keeps moving around like a cancer yeah it is like a cancer it is and um at the moment
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:55.720]  it's it's expressing itself something terrible in south africa the rate of rape and murder and
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:00.120]  what have you is just phenomenal you know i saw some of those papers that you had in your hand
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:06.120]  and it said elderly couple shot whatever and i couldn't help but think to myself that's that's
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:10.920]  not a good example you know with all due respect the good examples are the elderly couple that
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:16.680]  had boiling water poured over them or the elderly gentleman who recently got locked up in his in his
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:23.080]  four truck and trust up and then the the truck set on fire and burned to death or the little girl
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:28.840]  who was raped to the the four-year-old girl who was raped by three men survived it and because
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:34.600]  she survived you know this was proven in the post-mortem autopsy she was then bundled up in
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:40.360]  newspaper with gasoline poured over it and then set on fire or the girl who was crucified on her
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:45.320]  parents kitchen table and then raped a three-year-old girl in this instance the three-year-old girl
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:51.080]  raped by four men while crucified to her parents kitchen table after her father had had his his
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:57.400]  throat split and her mother being killed as well you know it is beyond people's imagination what
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:03.480]  we're in at the moment wow well i'm going to talk about how people can shine light on this because
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.720]  just like genocide watch and others whether it's an asian group being killed or an african group
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:12.440]  being killed or people in latin america i mean i'm against any of these genocides but the un even
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.400]  admits that the last decade christians are the number one targeted group and the targeting's
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:23.880]  doubled uh just like we saw the un and the globalist and nato involved in the middle east and syria
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:29.160]  targeting christians they will go out of their way to kill christians uh and it is a program look
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:34.360]  at china the christians are being killed but anybody else peaceful the the buddhist are being
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:39.480]  killed uh will be right back and their organs taken will be right back i'm alex jones this is the

[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:31.160]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:42.440]  soundlanders.org simon rush is our guest i've got so much big breaking news at releases but
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:47.880]  what he's talking about is so important i want to finish up and having back soon but we've got
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:55.880]  this breaking bezos in deep state unite amazon launches cloud service for cia they bezos is the
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:03.800]  cia folks look into his dad all of it never ends and then meanwhile trump to levar ball i should
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:08.840]  have left them all in jail these people are they're caught choplifting that's like 10 years in jail
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:14.040]  in china trump gets them out china admits that the president interceded and the family says we
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:21.640]  don't appreciate you because you're trump i mean it's just the entitlement and the craziness and
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:28.200]  just all the weirdness is so sad to see and then to see countries that the globalist social engineers
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:33.960]  wreck they put communist in then they extract the resources for almost nothing and the africans
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:38.040]  don't get it whether they be white or black because when you've been there 300 years like some of
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.120]  these folks are longer you know you can call yourself an african and again it's not all the
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:45.480]  tribes doing it it's always the ones that get organized and i know there's different factions
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:49.880]  you've got the you've got the zulus and you've got all the other tribes kind of the a and c i don't
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:55.000]  live there i'm an expert but i know that pretty much all that's left is the farmers that are kind
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.520]  of like what you'd call amish in fact a lot of them i guess come from amish from the dutch and
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:05.720]  german derivation and i've read that i guess uh the southlanders organization has some connections
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:10.280]  describe the background of your group because again i've i mean i've researched it but there's a lot
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:14.520]  of different subgroups who are some of the different groups there in africa who are you trying to
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:18.760]  organize together because i mean you're the bread basket of much of africa everybody knows that
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:24.680]  who studied it and then if it's shown once you get overthrown uh and just kicked off your land
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:30.200]  that you've developed that people see and want it always goes out of cultivation and falls apart
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:35.560]  so again why are the communists pushing so hard to get you out i guess because the internationalist
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:40.120]  want to bring down stability so they can exploit the population better they don't want civilization
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:47.000]  well it's that and they're also absolutely devoted to this idea of destroying this this european
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.920]  christian tradition whether people like it or not they only need to look at the evidence not in
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:55.240]  south africa but around the world of what is happening today whose culture is being undermined
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:00.200]  by abortion pornography and gay marriage and what have you in complete contradiction to the
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:05.320]  doctrines the prevailing doctrines i mean it makes no sense no matter how you look at it you can't
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:12.040]  defend this thing forever and ever and ever at some point you've got to believe the very evidence
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:18.360]  that lies before sure the globalists admit this plan so what i'm asking you is uh i mean basically
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:22.600]  the organization you're with the groups who represent aren't you guys i mean i basically like
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:27.400]  amish uh a living in a basic christian tradition farming raising your families
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:34.200]  yes it is a very very uh conservative culture of course people have televisions and modern
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:41.400]  devices and appliances and and that kind of stuff but the fundamental cultural values
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:48.680]  of the people who i represent or who satan is devoted to protecting that is to say particularly
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:55.320]  the africana were people of south africa also other whites because that's how the uh international
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:01.720]  laws under which we are constituted legally work but those africana were people of very very conservative
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:07.560]  i'll i'll illustrate to point to you very briefly alex you know we we hold to a series of of
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:13.400]  prophecies that said this this crisis the prophecies given a hundred years ago will occur at a time
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:20.520]  when a man with a place kale tape that is to say hair resembling a wig will be in power in the
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:29.000]  united states and he will take over the reins of power from a black man and there are various
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.880]  other things i won't go on and on and on about it but the point is that we are devoted to an
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:40.840]  ancient culture and that's intriguing now because i want to hear about this prophecy well this chap
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:49.640]  lived uh he was born in 1864 died in 1926 very pious chap and he made a long series of prophecies
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:54.680]  in which he described that there would be three world wars and he said that the third world war
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:01.640]  would happen in parallel to a civil war in south africa race by civil war between the races but
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:07.320]  ultimately driven by the globalists which we have always seen anybody who can read african
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:11.560]  language is welcome to go on our website there are hundreds of articles that make it very very
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:17.320]  clear that we see our first enemy not as black people or not it's not the black people it is
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:24.840]  this global capitalist new world order he said that the third world war would happen in tandem
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:31.240]  with a crisis in south africa and he said it would be at a time when this man who is a stern man
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:39.880]  who gazes sternly has hair resembling a wig and he takes over the reins of the usa from a black man
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:48.280]  after the black man has confused the identity and the orientation of the united states
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:57.400]  he said that would be at a time when there's a wave of black and brown skinned migrants
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:03.400]  into europe he was very very explicit about it he said following that there would be a global
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:10.520]  financial crisis and he spoke particularly of the fact that that the money in europe would not
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:16.360]  be worth the paper that the pay the cost of the value of the paper would be greater than the the
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:20.520]  amount of money that it denominates by the way i've read about this fellow before and forgot
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.760]  about it and he actually it's on record he said all this he was listened to back then and it was
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:31.960]  all basically coming through the euro is starting to collapse right now yeah well he lost practically
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:37.080]  all of his credibility when he made one of his final prophecies namely that there would be a black
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:41.560]  government in south africa now a hundred years ago everybody thought that he was just plain
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:47.640]  crazy and they wrote him off he said the first black ruler on the throne of south africa would
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:54.040]  be deemed a saint by the world and when he died he would be a lion state in a glass coffin
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:40:00.520]  and at his burial dignitaries he spoke about princes and rulers and so on would come from
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:05.640]  all over the world to pay respects at his grave site now the meaning of that is very very the
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:09.640]  reason i'm listening to stuff like this there's a lot of false promises the bible say who go out
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:12.760]  and put out this info but people like this where it's been proven right over and over again it's
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:18.280]  incredible and i personally haven't had like full-on deals like this but i've had experiences
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.520]  dreams and things that came true exactly later so that's why i know how real this stuff is
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:28.200]  yeah it can be and i think everybody approaches this stuff with some skepticism
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.760]  my father gave me the the book to read at first and i gave it back to him very despicably i
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:39.480]  thought it was absolute nonsense until i began to see that what he prophesied or predicted
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:46.040]  was coming to word for word for word very often in the same words that he used and he did say that
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:52.680]  that a bucket of blood would fall over in zimbabwe and once that bucket of blood fell over in other
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:41:00.120]  words there would be a lot of blood spilt or blood shed he he said it would come into south africa
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:04.120]  so now we don't know whether there's going to be bloodshed in zimbabwe today next week next
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.440]  month next year who knows but these are the things that we're paying attention to because
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:14.120]  so far he's been right and we're on the receiving end of a lot of pain at the moment everybody knows
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:21.960]  somebody who's been murdered or raped or whose child has been raped or who's been disfigured
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:29.560]  i was on a farm recently which has eight neighboring farms and on each of the eight neighboring farms
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:37.560]  somebody had been killed in recent years now that's you know it's severe and it's getting worse
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.720]  and it's what the communists do it's helter skelter uh simon i'm really impressed with the

[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:05.640]  we first talked about this about a year ago when it was just in trade publications but
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:11.720]  this is far-reaching implications i'm explaining why here in just a second also saudi arabia vows
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:17.880]  to take on iran i'm at warnings the region is in dangerous abyss that's out of the express we
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:24.600]  told you months ago war there is looming and may be imminent but the first big thing i want to get to
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:29.480]  charles manson it's so interesting it's it's hard to not because usually i talk about charles
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.240]  manson people don't really make a big deal at it because it's he's not in the news but now whatever
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:36.840]  we talk about with manson will end up getting millions of views you know on facebook and

[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:48.680]  the program he was part of to destabilize and try to trigger a race war for cultural upheaval because
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:52.600]  in the globalists don't want us to be christian and to come together and not be racist they want
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:58.040]  to claim their fighting racism while stirring everyone up to be racist that's really the secret
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:05.960]  plan which isn't a secret anymore so we're going to talk about all that coming up but first expert
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:11.960]  great crash of 2018 will start in the bond market i saw this yesterday did some more research
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:17.960]  it it is a top expert saying that many others are saying it too because it is so overvalued
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:22.360]  then i saw this this morning and i said whoa i better cover this
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:30.200]  euro crash with angela merkel's fourth term and chancellor is in doubt as us growth forecasts
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:37.560]  are on the rise i'm going to break this down here in a moment because it's a key first off the ladies
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:46.680]  and gentlemen we are running specials this week that are amongst the best we ever run and i've been
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:50.840]  running more and more specials as things go on because i've noticed the bigger the specials i
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:55.160]  run the more people buy product but there's kind of a point at which we discount things so much that
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:58.840]  it didn't really funding our operation and i've lately the accountants have shown me i've kind
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:05.480]  of reached that point where hey you're selling the probiotic at five dollars over what it cost
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:10.280]  and then you're doing free shipping alice we're losing a dollar it's on average stop
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:17.320]  and so it really does come down to that uh brain force plus is now back in stock
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:21.560]  we got a small shipment in we should get a lot more towards the end of december but it's about
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:26.840]  to be sold out again 50 percent off and free shipping that's the first big special of black
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:36.040]  friday week we're just gonna have it right through this weekend 50 percent off 5700 reviews by power
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:45.160]  reviews 4.6 stars and we just went out and researched the highest quality brain empowering focus
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:50.200]  empowering energy empowering a healthy way or organic substances that are known to be safe
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:57.320]  and we put it in there and we sell it for 39 dollars when similar compounds are 70 to 80
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:03.160]  but when we sell it for 50 off ladies and gentlemen 50 percent off it is 19 dollars
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:13.960]  and 96 cents i mean that is a great great deal on a really really powerful brain pill brain force
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:19.640]  plus now with 20 more capsules in each bottle which was a big deal for us to do because i mean
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:25.400]  the you know it costs a lot some of the compounds people love it though it is the overall total
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:30.120]  best seller that we show up such a low price it doesn't really fund the operation x2 is one of
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:34.440]  our other top seller supermails a great seller the problem is it's made of a proprietary system cold
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:39.000]  pressed so it's hard to always get it california standards which is impossible to pass basically
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.200]  and then have enough of a cold press so it's sold out half the time we've got that back in
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:50.280]  but we've got a bunch of specials we're going to be running new specials every single day
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:56.600]  we've got pro pure 25 percent off on that water filtration and free shipping brain force plus 25

[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:30.680]  and you help yourself but when i remember to take all this stuff it makes my life so much better
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:35.800]  than i forget then i wonder why i'm sluggish or why i'm you know not as you know stuff in my gut
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:40.760]  isn't you know perfect and it's like oh wait we have these things god gave us through nature
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:44.520]  that we've gone out and sourced and got the very best stuff that works really well and it's here
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:50.200]  and it's very very popular but that's how again we fund this operation so i want to thank you all
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:55.000]  for your support and everything you've been doing because without you we would not
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.920]  be here and we're all facing the same globalist onslaught we're all dealing
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:03.400]  with the same globalist operations and we're all facing down the barrel of that and without
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:10.520]  coming together and without supporting each other and without really focusing on the fact
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:17.720]  that we're under attack we have no future humanity all has red blood we all have one destiny if we
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:23.720]  choose it to live together in peace and experience amazing secrets of the universe and trump's great
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:27.720]  crime is he's bringing people together the globalist want to break the country he first said we have a
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:32.120]  country we have a nation and it's great and here's what made it great and let's come together and
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:37.720]  they can't stand that because they want us alone and divided and pathetic and scared and it's not
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:44.040]  just us reverse engineering their operations against us we don't just have the wiki leaks we
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:49.160]  don't just have all these internal documents and statements and gruber on tv saying thank god you're
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:59.240]  so stupid we have shon parker former head of facebook we have the facebook documents that got leaked
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:06.280]  by high-level executives they say there's no more than 10 executives and maybe 20 or 30 assistants
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:11.080]  that had access to the facebook plan that got released earlier this year
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:15.960]  and got almost no attention it was in the australian newspapers because it got leaked in australia
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:20.680]  and it said we keep them desperate we keep our people poor we want to keep them alone we want
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:25.880]  to make them depressed uh and we we want to make them liberal so that so that they don't have a family
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:29.880]  i mean that is so diabolical
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:37.000]  they they exploit your vulnerability they try to make you more vulnerable and then they get
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.200]  up on tv and they admit it why did parker do that is he a good guy i don't know
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:52.200]  no it's just crazy
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:59.400]  but we're on an express elevator to hell and i don't say to be negative i'm an incredibly
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:06.200]  positive person positive in that we can change things and fix things but i use the analogy of
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:10.040]  if you're drinking a bottle of vodka a day your liver's starting to go out the doctor says hey
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:13.480]  you don't stop your liver's going to fail and you know we're not going to give
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:17.400]  their alcoholics a new liver you're going to die you understand
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:23.160]  and people look at the doctor and they say you're just being a killjoy you're just a
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:29.480]  punk you're a fearmonger and you're later they're in the ground i had several friends
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:34.760]  hell i've had more than that now that i'm this old i just lost more family than
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:40.520]  a liver failure cousin pretty young same age as me
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:51.640]  and it's you know serious issue and it's a good allegory it's a good parallel it's it's it's a
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:57.560]  good example of the new world order is run by really selfish cold-blooded people and they
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:03.640]  think you deserve to be annihilated and destroyed and overtaken because uh you're not wise to this
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:10.680]  i mean i'm telling you decades before they want you to know what their plans are because they're
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:15.560]  so arrogant they write white papers and they have events and you know 20 something years ago i'd
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.320]  have to dig around to find this and found it shocking look ted turner says kill 90 of the
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:23.320]  public and dump everybody down and cut off the resources and he'd say it you know in a
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.760]  autobahn society quarterly or he'd say in a club of rome deal that only went out to members and
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:34.840]  i'd have to go to the ut law department and ask permission to get in because i'd read about it
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:37.960]  in the book and want to know if it was true and i'd go down and like here was the proof like in
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:41.880]  a movie i'd get chills at my back how they're planning to kill everybody and i and how they're
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:45.880]  going to dump us down and i'd look around i'd see the plan being implemented how this is real
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.960]  and then i started warning people and they said this guy's crazy
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:57.720]  i mean you know 19 20 years ago i'd read about human animal chimeras i didn't want to believe
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:04.440]  about it was in major elite publications by elite it just means to them where they communicate
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:09.880]  with each other they just talk about all this stuff like they talk about you like you have less
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:20.520]  value than a grain of salt and they just talk all about it how once they get the computer grid
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.320]  in place to control everybody then they're going to kill everybody but right now there'd be a war
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:29.400]  you'd resist you'd fight back they'd never win a war right now the globalists it would end up
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:33.880]  blowing back on them they've got to get you so drugged out so whacked out so confused with
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:38.680]  robot sentries and computer grids everywhere so that when they flip the switch they've got autonomous
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.400]  robot armies they'll help them carry out the main wipeout so again it's coming and just remember

[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:44.040]  get into all this with him including the word tranny being banned they're they're sending police now
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:50.600]  to college radio stations to illegally arrest people to pull stunts to act like the word tranny
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:57.160]  is illegal facebook decided i'm not kidding go to wikipedia this year zuckerberg decided that
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:03.800]  it is a word you can't use but if someone's using it to describe how someone else misused it then
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:10.360]  it's okay and they've told us in phone calls high-level folks at facebook we told them we were
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:15.080]  recording it and they go that's fine please just paraphrase that's not word for word we go
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:21.000]  we're recording it like they were like robots they didn't they just have canned responses i've got
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  like 20 minutes of it recorded in there i mean i'm and i said listen i'm not if i was against
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.720]  somebody i should have the free speech unless i'm calling for violence but i'm not hating on somebody
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:35.080]  because they want to dress up like a woman or take hormones and be one just like a guy might
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:39.720]  want to take more steroids and become more male uh that you know do what i'm a libertarian man you
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:43.880]  want to drink vodka till you die do it you want to you know want to do things that are healthy do
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:48.280]  things that are bad i don't want to pay for your sex change i don't want to pay for your plastic
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:56.680]  surgery i mean it's plastic surgery i don't want i don't want to pay for you and it's like making this
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:05.240]  new super class so yeah let's play it here it is college calls police on student who said tranny
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:13.240]  on the radio use the term on their program deplorable radio calls the police just like the
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:15.400]  liberal this is up in minnesota just like the liberal schools let
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:24.760]  antifa beat you up and then and then nothing happens and it's look they're choosing words
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:30.040]  they can ban now they want to ban the word mother and father i'm not going to stop using it and if
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:34.760]  i wanted to use it and say he was a bad father he was a bad mother in a pejorative i can but i
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.640]  need to sit here and say oh i'm not against you please don't censor me i'm not against anybody
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:45.320]  and i never have been but it doesn't mean of a bunch of trannies have an event and then dance
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:50.840]  naked in front of kids here in austin literally with nothing but glitter on their genitals i don't
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:57.000]  care if it's heterosexual or whatever you're doing homosexual it's illegal it's wrong and you're
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.880]  really pushing it and you're hiding behind your rights and a lot of pedophiles have picked up your
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:06.120]  banner and are hiding behind it so you need to understand that and and again a lot of big liberal
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:11.000]  activists appointed that out instead of child abuse so let's go ahead and go to this clip this is
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:17.480]  what you get the police coming after you for to pretend like it's a dirty word that's an FCC
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.960]  violation well that's the FCC it's not an FCC violation it's not the cops so here's color
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:26.920]  of law just like oh take the vaccines or we'll arrest you here it is have a group here called
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:32.120]  the queer devil worshipers or a better team shirt it's not like our version of antifa here
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:37.640]  that's more um except by the way hit pause they're not gonna come back and play the whole thing
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.800]  we have a group here called queer devil worshipers and a lot of those groups want to be radical that's
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:46.520]  what they say you by the way they call themselves the queer group or the queer event and then you
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:51.240]  go oh look they're having the queer event and they go oh my gosh you're a band you said queer see
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:57.960]  they're playing these semantical games and it's not right it's dangerous it's authoritarian so so
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:04.040]  i'll back it up and play it again we have a group here called the queer devil worshipers
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:10.600]  or a better team shirt it's not like our version of antifa here that's more um except they're nicer
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:15.880]  they're not nicer they're just more they're like they're nicer they're much more tender they're nicer
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:21.160]  in the violence they well the only reason they're not violent is because there's not enough of them
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:27.960]  and everybody knows everybody here at moran like you you know you can definitely you see one
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:35.400]  right so we're gonna come back we're gonna come back and they use the word tranny created by the
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:40.920]  trannies and now they say you can't you kind of like homosexual they said is mean to gay people
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:44.440]  they said use the word gay we go okay we'll be nice we'll use your word now they go don't use
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:49.240]  mother and father either they're trying to be word police man this is serious authoritarianism
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.760]  it's not about what's happening in your bedroom it's about what you're trying to force on us and
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:57.400]  we're not putting up with it after years of research working with top developers here in
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:04.360]  the united states with the latest cutting-edge science we are rolling out three new digestive
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:11.240]  gut age one of them is a powerful pro digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:19.160]  a meat other proteins better and then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:26.040]  of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration and we also have an everyday extremely
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:34.280]  affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance but all of these are the very cutting-edge top-of-the-line
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:41.800]  probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price that is my goal here is to bring
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:47.880]  you the very best at the lowest price when you purchase it an informer store.com you know you
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:54.040]  are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide
[02:05:54.040 --> 02:06:04.360]  Waging war on corruption, crashing of the lies and disinformation. I'm Alex Jones your host
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:09.720]  we have a giant spectrum of news the european union's euro is crashing people are having
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:15.080]  police called on them for using the word tranny uh claiming it's an illegal word not just a hateful
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:19.960]  word uh all because facebook just this year said it was now hateful no one ever really said that
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:25.400]  before but they decided they first have a debate about a word then their their group decides it's
[02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:30.360]  illegal and next week it'll be more words they tell you what words you can use they're god
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:35.800]  so that's coming up charles manson dead at 83 and so much more in this third hour but first
[02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:41.960]  ladies and gentlemen here's stefan malinu talking about how this is a great 20 minute video he did
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:48.040]  explaining that uh conservatives shouldn't play the reindeer games they shouldn't play the leftist
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:54.360]  games when it comes to running around uh taking any accuser and elevating it as if it's judge jury
[02:06:54.360 --> 02:07:01.960]  and executioner so here is mr infuego himself republicans i just got one question for you
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:10.680]  are you trying to lose are you trying to give away the stored blood and treasure of western
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:17.960]  civilization as a whole is it a calling to lose it is it is it a job is it a career is it a hobby
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:23.160]  whatever it is you pretty much got it done to perfection you've got to send it see it on the
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:36.840]  line send it see it on the line and more has been accused of touching girls inappropriately 40 years ago
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:46.360]  right before an election huh and you see the mainstream media cares so much about all of
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:51.720]  this inappropriate touching that they in 44 minutes they call up all of the republican senators and
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:56.280]  they get all oh what are your comments what do you think i need your comment of this tell me what
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:08:03.960]  you think what are your comments because you see the mainstream media they're appalled they're outraged
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:12.760]  they're horrified at any kind of inappropriate touching teenage girls so this is what they do
[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:19.160]  and this is why you lose but you don't have to stop taking this moral high ground of
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:28.360]  self-congratulatory moral preening as you ride the four horses of appeasement compromise and
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:37.640]  moral self-congratulation into the abyss you took people's votes yet take the money from the taxpayers
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:47.560]  to do your job now start doing your job start winning stop accepting the left's rules because
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:55.160]  the left has no rules the left has the left is like they seek power like water from a high place
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:09:04.360]  seeks a low place they just whatever Joe Biden you can watch these videos that make you feel like
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:11.480]  space aliens are breeding right under your skin Joe Biden is on video grabbing everything aged
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:19.320]  in the single digits as they try to wriggle away like some kid in space alien movies that's pretty
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:25.160]  close this is who the left loves there's no problem with these guys think they care about
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:31.480]  children and the girls they cared about children why would there be a national debt if they cared
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:34.520]  about children why would there be all these unfunded liabilities running into hundreds of
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:43.240]  children's dollars why would they be selling children off to Chinese banksters for 12 extra votes
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:52.360]  if they don't talk about inappropriate touching of the young how about an abortion forcep they just
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:10:01.240]  we'll talk about that another time this is who the left loves they care about these girls
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:09.480]  stack all of this stuff that the left accepts and loves and praises but Roy Moore you see
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:18.600]  he signed a yearbook he signed a yearbook in December of the next year oh and he signed it as
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:27.320]  Ray not Roy oh oh and he signed it da when he was at the time in fact dba deputy district attorney oh
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:33.080]  and also he got the name of the restaurant he was referring to wrong and one of his accusers says
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:38.440]  oh he locked me in a car i couldn't get out the locks with child proof well this was 1977 child
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:49.400]  locks weren't required until the 1980s so that's all proof right they had clinton dead to rights
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:54.840]  he had a major news network holding off an interview with
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:01.800]  we need a brother right who says bill clinton raped her until after the impeachment hearings
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:09.160]  that perfectly happened to cover up this kind of stuff but he signed a yearbook
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:18.600]  understand if you don't fight this it's going to be a reigning rape in 2018
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:28.100]  You're going to be like those sad, paralyzed little baby goats.
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:29.100]  Boo!
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:30.100]  Huh!
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:31.100]  Legs up.
[02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:34.520]  Don't move!
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:35.940]  That's the word that does it.
[02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:36.940]  Rape.
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:39.140]  Inappropriate, sexual, blah, assault.
[02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:45.640]  The Democrats don't care about the stuff because they've praised so many people who've
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:55.960]  done infinitely worse than what more is accused of. They don't care. And so in the Darwinian
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:00.200]  underworld of modern politics, they win.
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:07.680]  That's right. And joining us is Stefan Malinu live and in the flesh on this Monday, the
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:13.280]  20th day of November 2017, to cover the waterfront. And let's just continue the time we have left
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:18.880]  in this short segment. If we were watching this like a football game or like a battle
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:23.280]  between Lord Wellington and Napoleon, I mean, whatever the case would be, where are we at
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:28.720]  this point? And why do the Republican leadership want to be patted on the head by mainstream
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:37.720]  media when it's a dying anachronism that they should be running from? Why? I mean, I think
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:43.160]  it's because they've been mummified up there and they've all been selected previously because
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:48.920]  they were such yes men and because they don't think and because they really are tied into
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:51.440]  the matrix.
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:57.600]  Well it's in general, it's a crime gang in Congress. They do things that are immoral
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:04.560]  and horrible and I have a pretty strong inkling and feeling Alex that we're going to see happen
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:09.400]  to Congress what recently happened to Hollywood in terms of the blowout of sexual harassment
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:14.560]  allegations and probably worse. So they are in for the full Weinstein treatment, I think
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:18.520]  coming up there is rumblings on Twitter that this is all coming because of course they've
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:22.720]  been paying off. What is it, $15 million in slash money tax pay?
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:25.720]  You know, 250 pesos.
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:31.400]  Yeah. And I want to know who these people are. As an American voter, you should really
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:35.360]  want to know who these people are. Who are you voting for? Who has stuff on them? Do you
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:40.960]  think that a Congress person can be independent if they've been subject to this kind of star
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:44.560]  chamber review, if they've been subject to allegations that are paid off in terms of
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:49.440]  sexual harassment or worse? They're not independent, people got stuff on them. Can they vote according
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:53.040]  to their independent conscience if they can be blackmailed with this stuff? I don't know.
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.920]  I doubt it. So we really need to see this kind of stuff and all of these people acted
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:02.400]  in these terrible ways with no idea that people like you and I were going to write up on our
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:07.040]  little ponies of truth and start shooting the flares of illumination into the sky.
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:12.520]  So all of this is old school behavior. It's horse and buggy crap without the alternative
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:16.440]  media to hold their feet to the fire to keep speaking truth to power. These guys would
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:20.240]  have got away with it and imagine how much they would have got away with it if Hillary
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:21.240]  was in power.
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:26.000]  Well, that's some footage I've got coming up just in the next segment. We have Hillary
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.760]  supporters that are book signing, attacking our female reporter, grabbing her mic, hissing,
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:36.680]  screaming, and these are like 40, 50, 60 year old women hissing and going crazy and acting
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:43.480]  like animals. It's like the left has degenerated so much.
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:49.120]  They are terribly lazy. They are like Olympic swimmers who spent their entire life training
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:54.080]  swimming with the current with a jet pack and a motorboat and water skis. I mean, because
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:58.120]  they've had the mainstream media on their side, they've had government schools on their
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:02.240]  side. They've had academia on their side. They've had Hollywood on their side. They
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:06.880]  really haven't had to formulate a really good argument against strong and rigorous intellectual
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:09.480]  opposition for the last 50 odd years.
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:13.440]  The last time someone came up with a good argument against them was Joseph McCarthy.
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:17.840]  And look what happened to him. They had enough control of the media to destroy that man's
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:21.080]  life and to cover up all of the communists who were in the State Department and other
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:25.880]  areas of government. So they're lazy. And the people who've been swimming against the
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:31.240]  current, we've really sharpened our intellectual weapons and we are tan, fit, rest, relaxed
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:35.760]  with Bruce Lee bellies and ready to rock and roll. So we are unfortunately outclassing
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.640]  them enormously. And when you think you're all that and then you run up against a real
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:43.520]  opponent, the inevitable response is a kind of strangled panic.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:48.200]  That's it. I mean, they're like grounding rats. It's what it looks like just flailing
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:53.840]  around, squeaking and pissing themselves.
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:57.680]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals? Are you happy doing laundry with

[02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:53.800]  clear, I'm not a tribalist. George W. Bush twice for me trying to ask questions had me
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:21:01.320]  arrested on his orders once in New York, once here in Austin. I was there told. I don't
[02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:07.000]  like the Republican blue bloods. I want to get rid of them. But leftist ideology, going
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:13.200]  back to the Jacobins and their French Revolution, if you study it, is really the mindset of
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:18.320]  Charlie Manson. His clips about global warming and his clips about world government and his
[02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:23.160]  clips about killing people and how he's an elitist. He was involved in a CIA program.
[02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:26.840]  He was there at the same time as Theodore Kaczynski who was in the MK Ultra program.
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:30.800]  That's LA Times, by the way. They were involved in the occult. They were going to be the ruling
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:36.320]  class. They were involved with all the big, rich, powerful baronesses and heirs. He was
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:39.960]  mad because they were kicking him out of that club when he set up his own little cult. So
[02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:44.040]  he just went and killed a bunch of people to get back at him. We know that. I covered
[02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:48.480]  it last hour when overall the evidence. But when you hear what he's saying all those years
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:54.680]  ago, it's what Antifa is saying today. But they weren't this deranged. They had a lot
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:58.880]  of well-meaning liberals that were well-spoken involved and really were against police brutality
[02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:04.200]  and really were against real racism. And now they just mutated into something a thousand
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:09.800]  times worse than I thought. Race-baiting and culture-dividing and shaving cream companies
[02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:14.800]  saying it's bad to be a man. That article is up on infowars.com with the video. Toxic
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:20.200]  masculinity everywhere. Genocide the whites. It's a good thing. Trump gets the black players
[02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:27.960]  out of prison in China. Their dads, you know, like screw you. It's just a frothing-ness.
[02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:33.660]  So when I coined the term left-right paradigm, I meant they control us within fighting left-right.
[02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:37.960]  We should get out of it and just be pro-human. But now it really is a left-right issue in
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:42.920]  that the globalist went for broke with leftist ideology worldwide because it's collectivist.
[02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:48.760]  And that's what they want. And now it's metastasized, gone rogue in many ways, and has literally
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:54.880]  gone insane. And I don't know where it's going now as they rampage and try to stop recovery,
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:23:00.120]  as the EU implodes. And as this battle has joined, Stefan, I mean, what would you call
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:03.280]  this time historically?
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:09.120]  It is a time of the first potential pushback against the spread of state force and state
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:12.240]  power in the history of the world. Somebody asked me the other day, Alex, it's an interesting
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:17.240]  question. They said, have you ever noticed or known of a country that has turned back
[02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:22.040]  from ever-increasing state power without going through some massive collapse and some massive
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:27.480]  Godforsaken, Venezuela-style hunting pigeons in the town square and rats in the sewer,
[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:32.960]  fundamental decay. And it's really hard to think of one. But we do have this conversation,
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:37.840]  we have this capacity to reach the masses, absent of gatekeepers. We can bypass everyone
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:40.160]  who's supposed to keep the truth from the public.
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:46.080]  So right now, we are facing an ever-increasing escalation of state power. There are the nationalistic
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:51.480]  movements, the anti-EU movements, the anti-massive police state movements that are going on throughout
[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:56.440]  the West, personified with Nigel Farage and with Trump and with other people and so on.
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:01.640]  So there is this pushback never in history. Has it ever been successful? Basically, people
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:06.000]  have had to twiddle their thumbs, cry their tears and break their hearts as society slides
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.480]  off the abyss and then crust their fingers that in a couple of hundred years, we can
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:11.160]  get civilization back.
[02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:15.320]  Now for the first time, we have the capacity to put the brakes on the inevitable tsunami
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:19.880]  of escalating state power. And really, if you have the capacity to do that, that's all
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:22.120]  you should be doing these days.
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:26.920]  So not only do the tyrants have technology to manipulate, we now have technology that
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:31.200]  keeps boomeranging back on them and their plans don't go the way they want more and
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:35.920]  more and now humanity is learning from its mistakes. And most of the so-called minorities
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:41.440]  I talked to are not racist idiots. They know about the manipulation. It's fake polls. It's
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:45.640]  disinfo just like during the election. That's why they're panicking. They know they're losing
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:46.760]  control.
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:53.920]  Well, what people need are simple facts. And what we hope, I think, through providing simple
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:59.480]  facts and reason and evidence to people as a whole, is we can get them to have their
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:03.720]  love overcome their fear. This is going to sound all kinds of hallmarks sort of sile
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:08.240]  squishy, but I think it's really, really important. There are people who, there is the left and
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:12.800]  then there are the people who are the scared of the left. And those are the majority Republicans,
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:16.080]  you know, prior to Trump and the Neva Trumpers and so on. So there are other people on the
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:20.920]  left who openly admit that they'll use any satanic method that they can through their
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:25.600]  Satan Prince Saul Alinsky. They've been very honest about this. They'll use whatever manipulations
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:29.200]  they can. They have no stand. It's just to gain power. So there's the left, the hard
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:30.200]  left.
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:31.200]  They're a power cult.
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:32.200]  They're a power cult.
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:33.200]  They're a power cult.
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:38.160]  Yeah. They're power cults. And so those, the left want our blood. The left want our subjugation.
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:43.040]  And those who are scared of the left are hoping to appease them to buy a decade or two of peace.
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:47.760]  Well, the decade or two was a decade or two ago and that no more appeasement is going
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:53.880]  to work. It's going to all happen within our lifetime. So I want to bring people to love
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:58.640]  freedom more than they fear the abusers, more than they fear the people who can harm you,
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:03.080]  more than they fear the abuse of the media or of social media, more than they fear what
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:07.520]  they can lose from people attacking them unjustly. And we see people, you know, Trump weighted
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:12.360]  through endless accusations of abuse and racism and sexism. We've got Roy Moore who's not
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:17.120]  backing down or backing out of what I think are unfounded allegations against him. We
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:22.400]  have to show people how love can overcome fear, how love of freedom, love of the future,
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:27.200]  love of our civilization, love of our history, love of our children. That is the only power
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:32.080]  that can overcome the fear that will get us all plowed under in the usual socialist expansion
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:33.080]  in history.
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:38.120]  You're absolutely right. You've always got these socialist Jacob and Illuminati expansionists
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:42.360]  who are the opposite of eliminating people to the counterfeit of, of, of, of what you
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:46.800]  call the enlightenment and Francis Bacon and all the rest of it. And they are just dedicated.
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:51.360]  They'll tell you to dominating you. They don't even want a civilization. They want to gouge
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:56.560]  our eyes out, turn our skulls into goblets and then drink up all the wine and sit on
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:00.120]  top of a pile of skulls and not even care that more wine doesn't come because they burn
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:04.320]  down the vineyards. It's the same that we see in Africa killing all the white farmers.
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:10.000]  It's just a power lust to have that minute of power gouging somebody's eyes out, even
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.360]  though you're going to starve to death in two weeks.
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:19.200]  Once somebody has admitted to you, Alex, that they have no principles, then there is no
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:23.400]  end to their escalation of destruction. And we've seen this. We've seen this at the French
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:28.800]  Revolution where you have thousands of priests and nuns dragged out of monasteries and churches
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:35.360]  and chapels and eyes gouged out, throat slit, heads cut off in the streets. We saw this
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:40.160]  in Cambodia where the first thing they did was target anybody with an intelligence above
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:45.160]  100 and arguments above medievalism. They dragged them out into the cities. They forced them
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:49.200]  to become farmers. Everyone starves to death. We saw this in the Ukraine under Stalin and
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:53.680]  the Holodomor. When they collectivized all the farms, gave all of the farm machinery
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:57.920]  to incompetent people, killed off all of the rich incompetent farmers and then millions
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:01.640]  and millions of people starved to death. We saw this in China. Tens of millions of people
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:06.960]  slaughtered. We saw this in North Korea where it's basically one giant open air prison camp.
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:12.600]  There is no end to the escalation of the aggression they will use. This is why we have to not
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:17.760]  just oppose the evil that is coming, but show the light of love and reason and happiness
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:21.880]  and joy. And that is the light by which we must drive back to darkness because there's
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:25.800]  an old saying that has really stuck with me from Nietzsche where he said, when you confront
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:30.040]  monsters, when you face down monsters, be careful that you yourself does not become
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.960]  a monster. We must oppose the evil, but guide ourselves by the good as much as possible.
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:38.880]  Because when you stare into the abyss, a lot of times you become the abyss. We'll be back
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:43.320]  with Stefan Malinu who again is on fire, ladies and gentlemen, will cover a bunch of big breaking
[02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:47.840]  news with him and get into all these words they're trying to ban. Facebook told us you
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:52.160]  use the word tranny, you're banned. But then the left can use it all they want. I mean,
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:56.680]  this is true discrimination. Have you ever lost your power and wanted to simply flip
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:01.880]  a switch to get the lights back on? If so, pay close attention because huge discounts
[02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:07.720]  are now available in solar generators. Perfect for backup power outages and emergencies.
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:13.160]  Portable solar generators provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most. And
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:19.600]  unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no dangerous fumes and produces
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:24.440]  an endless supply of electricity from the sun. It's like having an electric power plant
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:32.240]  running secretly in your own home. Right now, get a $5,000 solar generator for just $995
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:39.680]  while supplies last. Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:29:54.600 --> 02:30:00.920]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:07.320]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:14.880]  or videos or other material from m4store.com, you are funding the revolution. I mean, I
[02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:20.360]  cannot say it any clearer. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at m4store.com.
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:24.120]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:29.160]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it. You cannot beat that
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:33.200]  for children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones. That's my
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:40.800]  dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well. m4warslife.com or AAA-253-3139. And your purchase
[02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:45.120]  of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:48.640]  the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies. And that's who they are, and they
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:55.400]  know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:30:55.400 --> 02:31:00.080]  America is an information-based civil war. That's why now more than ever, we've got to
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:04.960]  hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their
[02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:12.080]  bullying. We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:18.040]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[02:31:18.040 --> 02:31:24.960]  the counterculture. The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism
[02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:30.560]  and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a counterfeit
[02:31:30.560 --> 02:31:36.200]  of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberals who defend free
[02:31:36.200 --> 02:31:41.200]  speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more than 60
[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:46.440]  original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot

[02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:57.200]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[02:31:57.200 --> 02:32:01.920]  is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:07.280]  scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and
[02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:12.840]  water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:17.600]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now,
[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:23.640]  with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:27.840]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things
[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:30.720]  that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bug, the organic
[02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:35.560]  wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm
[02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:39.240]  glad we've got some back in, because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday,
[02:32:39.240 --> 02:32:43.160]  Living Defense, m4warstore.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:48.680]  for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, m4warstore.com. Thank you, Dr.
[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:51.800]  Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this
[02:32:51.800 --> 02:32:57.000]  great product.
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:12.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming
[02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:25.680]  to you live from the front lines of the info war. We can rebuild him better than he was
[02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:32.280]  before. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's first bionic
[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:48.040]  man. Steve Austin will be that man better than he was before. Better, stronger, faster.
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:53.760]  All right, folks, we'll see if we can rebuild the republic and make it better and then everybody
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:59.560]  wants to come here because it's not perfect. You can sure point all day at our wrongs and
[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:02.800]  our problems, but then why does everybody want to get here? Because there was a little
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:07.840]  bit more freedom and a little bit more leave me alone. And suddenly you got all these choices
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:11.920]  and suddenly you got all these doctors and suddenly you got all these vacations and suddenly
[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:17.240]  you got all these new appliances and suddenly you live longer and everybody then points
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:21.080]  at it and says, it's evil. It's evil. Get rid of it. And Obama says, that's right. You
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:26.280]  can't have cars or air conditioning if you're in Africa. How is that not the most racist
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:30.720]  thing we've ever heard? So what you've got is a bunch of kleptocrats who want to use
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:38.880]  the tidal forces of human nature, tribalism, and have a new reverse colonialism, but not
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:44.360]  for the people of the third world invading the West to actually share in the spoils because
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:48.440]  that's the plan is to have people come here and work and live and make things better.
[02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:54.880]  No, to come here to politically conquer it. So Stefan Malin, I've been asking a lot of
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:58.760]  questions and I've got a ton of news here. I want to go over with you, but what else
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:01.960]  is on your radar screen you want to impart to the viewers?
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:08.200]  Yeah, I was thinking about this, you know, calling the police on words that people find
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:12.760]  offensive and so on. And I was just thinking over the break, Alex, you know what I really,
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:16.240]  really want? And I think I speak for a lot of people in this. I want a little bit of
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:20.720]  space. I want a little bit of breathing room. I feel like we're all kind of getting squished
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:24.520]  up together with this political correctness. You know, it's like if I was doing the interview
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:30.280]  and I had the camera right up here, be a little claustrophobic, a little bit of an invasion
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:34.200]  in personal space and I really, really want some space. I want, like if people want to
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:38.120]  change their agenda, just don't force me to pay for it. If people are irresponsible with
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:42.280]  their sexuality, just don't force me to pay for it. If people would rather play video games
[02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:47.120]  and learn some job skill, let them live with the lower wages. Let's have a little bit of
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:54.120]  space. Let's have a little bit of personal privacy for our money, for our thoughts, for
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:57.160]  our opinions. If you disagree with someone in the public square and it really bothers
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:02.800]  you, go engage them. Mind to mind, verbal battle to verbal battle. Don't call the police
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:07.280]  on a word you find upsetting. That is very claustrophobic and that's saying that we
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:11.320]  don't have any personal space anymore. We don't have any privacy for our wallet. We
[02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:16.200]  don't have any privacy for our communications. We don't have any privacy for being offensive.
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:20.560]  And who on earth is to say that the person who is the most offensive now might not be
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:24.440]  the person who gives us the biggest moral breakthrough in the future? Slavery, anti-slavery
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:29.240]  was highly offensive to people when it first came out. Who on earth has the omniscience
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:32.240]  to know that what is offensive now might not be moral tomorrow?
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:36.080]  Well, the old left has said, hey, I may disagree with you, but I'll fight to death for you
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:40.640]  to say it because political speech and unpopular speech is the most protected. And of course
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:45.720]  you're talking about the article, college calls police on students who said, tranny,
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:50.080]  they arrest you if you don't use the G or Z or whatever the new cult words are. How
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:55.640]  about a cult? No longer use mother or father. We have words for you. Use this. It's a revolution.
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:00.720]  They know what they're doing. And so they talk about their local anti-foot group. It's
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:06.200]  Minnesota college and it's called devil worshiping queers. And notice the gay folks can use the
[02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:09.480]  word queer all day. I don't care. But then somebody else says, Hey, they're having their
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:14.480]  queer rally. It's the name of the rally. And I've had strikes on the YouTube for saying
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:18.440]  they had this, you know, the such and such queer rally, which is the name of the rally.
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:22.520]  Then I can't say the name of the rally because they're, it's like a God complex with the
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:28.640]  left. And they're using these little subgroups then to be the little victims to where trannies
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:33.160]  came up with the name training. That's the name they gave themselves. I looked it up
[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:38.840]  and I looked up where it came from this year. Facebook decided it's hateful. They banned
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:45.240]  it. And so now everyone else is saying it's an FCC word when it's not. And it's just like
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:51.600]  incredible that, that, that I had Facebook. So we're going to shut you down and ban you
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:54.240]  on Facebook. We're going to shut, but, but we want to have one of our executives talk
[02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:58.560]  to you. And I couldn't believe it was the head of the quote Facebook brands. So we get
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:02.240]  in the phone call, we go, we're recording this, me, Rob doing us are in there. We haven't
[02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:04.960]  played it yet. And then they don't even listen to us. They go, okay, well, just don't just
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:09.720]  just paraphrase me. And then they go, just don't use that word. And I go, but what if
[02:38:09.720 --> 02:38:14.680]  I'm reading a news headline, they just go, um, I'll call you back in a few days and we're
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:19.280]  going to give you a full list of all the words you can't use. Well, they never called us
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:25.120]  back. So I mean, I'm on a phone call with an executive telling me, don't say tranny,
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:29.440]  tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny. I mean, again, folks, this
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:34.240]  is such a war on words. It's crazy. What do you think?
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:40.480]  Well, this is what happens when you get multiculturalism. Often so often Alex devolves into multi
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:46.360]  legalism or multi rules. You know, multiculturalists kind of sold like, well, you can get a wide
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:50.000]  variety of delectable treats on Main Street because there's going to be lots of different
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:53.880]  kinds of ethnic restaurants. And oh, if you're really into Natasha Atlas, you'll be able
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:58.160]  to appreciate her music even more. And it's all this softy gooey, you know, there'll be
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:02.160]  different songs, different music, different food and so on. And that's great. And that's
[02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:06.280]  how it's kind of sold to you. But what actually happens is you end up with different rules
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:11.400]  for different groups. And they start off as ostracism punishment rules. And then they
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:17.720]  escalate to banning on social media rules. And then they go all the way to legal rules
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:22.840]  in society. And you end up with different rules for different groups. No objective standards.
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:28.640]  You go from multiculturalism to multi legalism, where protected groups have different sentences,
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:32.680]  protected groups have different rules. And you know, the N word can be used by rappers,
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:36.200]  but not by anyone else. And this word can be used by this group. But if this group uses
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:41.440]  it is horrible and opposing, you get this fragmented, broken, total discrimination and
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:46.200]  it breaks society apart. It's total discrimination to it creates new classes, as you just said,
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:54.320]  and they know what they're doing. This incredible balkanization, which results in the self policing
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:59.680]  of people and the the hostile opposition to other groups. Because if you have to self
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:03.560]  police all the time, if you're a white male, say for instance, you're not into any, you're
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:08.120]  not in any protected group. So many white males, I just did this video on masculinity
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:11.720]  as a whole. And so many white males are feeling like, well, I can't say this and I can't
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:15.080]  apply for this job because it says, are you part of a minority or are you a woman when
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:18.680]  you apply for this job? And I know if I don't check that off, I'm never getting to the interview
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:22.040]  phase and I can't say this and everyone's going to attack me for that. And what happens
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:28.160]  is then you see these other groups who seem to be getting away with astonishingly huge
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:33.960]  breaks in these rules. And there's this frustration with your own inhibited state. And then there's
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:38.680]  this mounting resentment against other people who flout these rules with impunity. And this
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:43.600]  is how they set us against each other, create these rules, have them applied exactly. It's
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:48.000]  meant to create right. 100 to these, it's meant to create racial division and fighting
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.400]  each other. It's meant to create racial division. Exactly. The end game is all of us hating
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:57.720]  each other. And it's such a shame because if we all agree to submit to reason and evidence,
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:01.720]  we can have very positive and productive and enjoyable discussions. But we've turning
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:06.640]  into it's like a science conference where you've got tarot cards and voodoo as to whose
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:11.240]  conjecture or hypothesis becomes validated. No, we need reason and evidence because if
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:16.760]  we simply bow to political correctness, we are going to tear ourselves apart as a society.
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:20.640]  And those of us who can see the tears coming are desperately trying to sew them back together.
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:24.280]  But there's lots of people out there with scimitarists just slashing away at the entire
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:28.800]  tapestry and fabric of what holds us together as societies. And we must do everything we
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:32.160]  can to prevent that from happening because what's on the other side of that tapestry
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:38.840]  is a whole lot of blood and bones. 100%. And you notice for a long time, the Hollywood
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:41.920]  elite, the comedians, they were exempt. They could tell the dirty jokes. They could just
[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:46.080]  say the racial jokes. Now they can't either. And they're not liking it. I mean, this is
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:53.400]  such a prison that's been built and it's like a self perpetuating system that just gets
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:57.480]  more loony and more crazy. I mean, I think it's destined to fail.
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:01.840]  Well, we do have some bright sparks in all of this. And this all comes out of the alternative
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:08.320]  media. The left has traditionally used allegations of sexual misconduct to undermine and cripple
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:12.000]  their political opponents. We see that, of course, happening in Alabama. The plus side
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.960]  is since now there's an alternative media to bring up Bill Clinton. They're now on the
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:19.720]  left throwing the Clintons under the bus so that they can retain this weapon of sexual
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:25.120]  allegations against the Republicans or non leftists. And anything which diminishes the
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:28.920]  power of the Clintons in the public sphere, I find it really hard to think of is in any
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:29.920]  way bad.
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:35.080]  All right, Steph Ann Mullen is straight ahead. I'm going to play some of the band radio.
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:40.560]  The police were called on this to create the color of law that they weren't allowed to
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:45.080]  even describe the names of the groups. Because remember, the left's allowed to use all these
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:54.520]  groups. You're not. They said so. We'll be back.

[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:59.280]  America is an information-based civil war. That's why now, more than ever, we've got
[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:04.040]  to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:09.800]  from their bully. We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:16.520]  dictatorship. Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:23.360]  is truly the counterculture. The real punk rock is being a patriot, who's pro-America,
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:28.960]  pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:34.240]  a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberalists.
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:39.800]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more

[02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:04.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:19.400]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Stefan Malanou, is writing Shotgun with us today. Stefan Malanou
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:23.640]  has his new book out that I've read. It's excellent, The Art of the Argument, Art of
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:29.240]  the Argument.com. Be sure and get that and find out more at Free Domain Radio on YouTube,
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:37.680]  while it's still there. Two weeks ago, Congressional hearings, they openly said, oh, we saw Paul
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:41.920]  Watson's article at InfoWars was number one about the attack, saying it was Islamic and
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:46.960]  that the mayor had been warned. This is fake news, and then Twitter, Facebook, Google,
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:54.480]  these extra, like, sir, we saw it at lunch and took it down. And despite all their censorship,
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:58.520]  we've had five billion views altogether. I know because YouTube told us, they said,
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:01.800]  let us monetize all this, but also take most of the other channels down. You let everybody
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:07.920]  use your stuff, but I knew it was just a way to give them the authorization to take all
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:11.880]  my material off. So we don't just have our two, whatever, billion views on our channels.
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:14.760]  We have three billion. That was a couple of years ago. They told us it's like four billion,
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:18.240]  so I'm guessing it's five billion now. It's probably way bigger. They don't like the fact
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:21.440]  we're way bigger in the young turks. I think bigger is like something like PewDiePie, who
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:25.680]  they want to take over because they don't control him, even though he's not even political.
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:29.400]  It's about control. People don't want their Hollywood garbage. They don't want their mainstream
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:35.480]  trap anymore. You can get a few idiots that do, but people want real diversity and ideas.
[02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:39.720]  But we're under censorship. That's why you got to hand share the links to infowars.com
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:44.120]  and the stories and the videos and the live feeds on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube,
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:50.800]  and on other platforms. It's why you are absolutely authorized to grab our feeds and put them
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:57.000]  on your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube, whatever. Just get the information out there.
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:03.560]  Support our local radio stations. Become a sponsor. Support their sponsors. Support us.
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:06.720]  We've got free shipping through this week. I'm extending because of the Black Friday
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:14.280]  sales and it got back in stock. 50% off Brainforce are incredibly popular, new tropic. Brands
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:19.920]  that are similar are $60 to $70. It's a deal at $39. It's $19.95 right now, but it's a
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:23.240]  small shipment. We're not going to get more and probably till the end of the year. So
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:27.960]  Brainforce Plus, 50% off. We've got some other big specials we're running today as well,
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:34.000]  but a lot of these specials can only run for a few days. So Brainforce Plus is the special
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:39.400]  that we've got today and 25% off Pro Pure water filtration systems and several other
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:43.280]  big specials. Don't forget our fluoride free toothpaste. It's got colloidal silver and
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:48.120]  iodine in it. Don't forget we've got our new line of probiotics, fluorolife in the digestive
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:53.360]  enzyme for big carnivores. Carnivore. Check that out at infowarstore.com. And when you
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:58.320]  get excited about what we're doing, we can get more crew, more people. We can expand
[02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:03.200]  and not be destroyed because we're either going to grow under these attacks and believe
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:08.280]  me, they're intense or we're going to implode. And I've decided to grow in the face of it.
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:13.120]  Big fish eat little fish. So whether it's highest quality body armor at the best prices
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:17.680]  or whether it's books and films and non GMO heirloom seeds, thousands of great preparedness
[02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:23.960]  items at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:27.400]  And there's several specials we had last week. They're about to end. I don't have time to
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:35.200]  get into, but, but, but Stefan, we're really right. I mean, we're not just here saying
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:41.720]  all of this. It's really happening. They're going more insane. What is the limit on the
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:47.000]  rotting intellectual fruit that is the power cult that's modern liberalism and the decaying
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:51.760]  Republican establishment? Because as you said, they were just a bunch of lazy ne'er-do-wells
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:56.680]  who thought they were in power as culture kings, imposing their will on everybody, but
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:51:00.960]  then really they're just a bunch of camp followers of a cold-blooded corporate takeover system.
[02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:05.680]  As they realize that they've not in power anymore, those of us that are libertarian
[02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:09.280]  or freedom-based, we're just, maybe we've got them off our back a little bit. We understand
[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:13.520]  it. It's not like feeling powerful because our ideas are being a little bit represented.
[02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:17.520]  It's like a desperate beach head, hoping we can turn the tide against these mentally
[02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:21.680]  ill people. I mean, they're the most depressed. They're the most pathetic. You get Facebook
[02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:28.240]  documents with the executive shade. These liberals are pathetic, servile, deranged, depressed
[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:33.560]  people. Let's keep them more depressed and suck them dry. I mean, it's so cold-blooded,
[02:51:33.560 --> 02:51:38.360]  Hillary calling them losers in their mother's basements and how much she hates her constituents,
[02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:42.600]  but they don't care. They still march on worshiping her, but then Dona Brazil starts
[02:51:42.600 --> 02:51:46.480]  to wake up and others start to wake up that their brand's dying, but I think it's too
[02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:53.680]  little too late. This is where I see things, Alex. We are in a house. The sun is rising.
[02:51:53.680 --> 02:51:58.360]  The vampires are beating down the door, but we still have to invite them in. If we don't
[02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:04.320]  invite them in, poof, they turn into ash from the rising sun. They have missed the opportunity
[02:52:04.320 --> 02:52:07.760]  to crush us. You know, you've been doing this longer than I have. I've been doing it for
[02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:11.880]  about 11 years in a public sphere, many, many years before that in a private sphere. Back
[02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:15.800]  in the day, they tried to smash me down back in the day and continually they try to smash
[02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:20.360]  you down, but it's too late. We have become too big. There are too many interconnected
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:23.960]  people. There are too many networks. There are too many freedom lovers who are supporting
[02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:28.720]  each other. Now if they try and smash people down, all they do is raise the profile. In
[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:33.600]  other words, what I'm saying is the Liberty virus, my friends, has gone airborne. It can
[02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:38.480]  no longer be contained. And that means that it's a wonderful opportunity for everyone
[02:52:38.480 --> 02:52:44.360]  out there. Please do not view the liberation of Western civilization as a spectator sport.
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:48.120]  Do not sit there passively in your chair, thumb in your remote and hoping that other
[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:52.640]  people are going to save the world for you. We have passed the tipping point. The Overton
[02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:58.400]  window has gone so far now that what was impossible before has become commonplace now. What was
[02:52:58.400 --> 02:53:04.000]  radical before has become commonplace now. So I invite and urge everyone, everyone, do
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:09.640]  not have this incredibly powerful moment in time be nothing more than something you look
[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:15.680]  at and are passively hoping that other people will do for you. Get up, get involved, support,
[02:53:15.680 --> 02:53:21.120]  start something, write something. It's a webcam and a microphone. You can do that for 50 bucks.
[02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:27.080]  Really dig deep. Find a way to talk passionately about freedom. Don't let them conquer you.
[02:53:27.080 --> 02:53:33.080]  Don't let them conquer you. And don't let other people save you. You know, there's
[02:53:33.080 --> 02:53:38.640]  an old, it was a poster when I was a kid that was around. And it was a kid looking at his
[02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:43.080]  father after the Second World War. And this was during the Second War. And the kid was
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:48.240]  saying, Daddy, what did you do in the Great War? And the kid, the father was like shameface
[02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:52.200]  and looking down because I don't know. I guess he didn't really, really do much of anything.
[02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:56.480]  This is easier. It's much easier than trench warfare. You know, we know what he's asking
[02:53:56.480 --> 02:54:01.020]  us to snort mustard gas into our lungs or, you know, have shells barrage down on our
[02:54:01.020 --> 02:54:05.520]  heads at least yet. So it's much easier. This is the easiest fight that has ever had
[02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:10.680]  for the greatest stakes in human history. And please, please, I beg people on my knees,
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:15.480]  do not let this opportunity for heroism pass you by. Self-esteem, self-respect is something
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:20.440]  that you really have to fight for. It's like health. It doesn't just happen to you. You
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:25.640]  have to take active steps to have pride in yourself. And there's no greater gift to yourself
[02:54:25.640 --> 02:54:30.880]  than acting in a courageous, moral manner against vicious and immoral people. So everybody
[02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:34.840]  has this opportunity. The barrier to entry has never been lower. The stakes have never
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:40.640]  been higher. And the fight, frankly, has never been more fun. Join in.
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:44.480]  That's right. And again, I don't like to demonize our enemies because that's something that
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:48.560]  means I've got a crutch and I want to feel elitist. I mean, you know, those of us that
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:54.480]  have natural compass know that putting somebody else down doesn't make us bigger, but you
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:55:00.800]  have to recognize that any Hillary event or any Democrat event, these aren't just anti-five
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:07.760]  events. These are gibbering, hateful people that can hardly talk. And they are lunatics.
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:12.640]  And it's getting worse. And it is a mass form of psychosis. And of course, that's been
[02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:16.320]  proven in psychology. You don't just have individual psychosis. Humans are designed
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:19.680]  that usually somebody in the group must know the right way. So they're following a bad
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:24.120]  leader and they won't admit they've been wrong and they won't admit things are serious. It's
[02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:28.560]  like the Germans still thought they were going to win when the Russians were a mile away
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:31.560]  from the right Chancellor and Hitler still thought he was going to win till two days
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:37.400]  before. And it just shows, I kind of got to give it to them though. They won't give up,
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:41.560]  but they're becoming characters of zombies. I mean, here's just 10 seconds of this. We
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:45.320]  can't show a lot of it because of the radio stations and TV stations and most, I mean,
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:50.200]  it's been bleep, but they're flipping everybody off. They're cussing screaming. These are women
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:53.960]  attacking our female reporter, physically grabbing on her, grabbing the mic cussing
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:57.640]  at her for just coming up, trying to talk to him about Bill Clinton. Here it is at a
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:56:02.320]  Hillary book signing. You're not going to get away with this. Now this is Hillary Clinton's
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:11.760]  assignment. Whoa. Boo. I agree. We got to cover all the flipping off because we're on a lot
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:16.200]  of TV stations now and I guess you can't FCC show them flipping everybody off. I didn't
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:18.840]  even know that. I apologize to some of the stations that called us last Friday. I was
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:21.880]  showing some of these women flipping people off and they're like, you can't show that.
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:28.120]  So, but, but it's only picked a few. They're all like this. What happened to them?
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:32.400]  Well, there are people, of course, who use false ethics to gather power and there are
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:36.560]  other people though who have good intentions, who simply have the wrong information. So
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:40.320]  I put Twitter at something this morning, which I'll mention briefly here, Alex, which is,
[02:56:40.320 --> 02:56:44.120]  you know, people care about poor people in the third world. Now in the past, when Western
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:48.280]  companies went to the third world and scraped up a bunch of resources and took them out
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:51.600]  of the third world, people said, well, that's wretched, terrible imperialism. Okay, I understand
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:52.760]  that case.
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:57.640]  But now in the West, a lot of countries in the West are scooping up the smartest people
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:02.000]  from the third world and bringing them into the West. Now, intelligence is one of the
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:06.800]  greatest natural resources along with empathy that the world has. So how is it terrible
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:11.520]  to strip my natural resources from the third world in the past, but now taking the intelligent
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:15.840]  people, the most competent and educated people out of the third world, thus damning those
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:16.840]  countries to ever to change.
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:17.840]  It's a total brain drain.
[02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:21.960]  Stay there. I want to do five more minutes because I noticed this. Even when I was a
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:25.520]  little kid in the country, people were smart, they were cool, they were good looking. Now
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:28.640]  I go to the countryside where a lot of my family's from, and it looks like Beverly
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:33.680]  Hillbillies, and it's just cable TV or satellite TV and people, because it's like the brain's
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:38.240]  left. And it's the same thing with the third world. It just wipes it out. We'll be right
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:47.080]  back. That's a key point you just made.
[02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:54.240]  Power of B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:57:58.160]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need

[03:00:05.160 --> 03:00:12.120]  We are listening to an infowars.com front-line report. It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.120 --> 03:00:15.720]  And Stefan Malinu, I'm going to host a little bit in the next hour. Matt Dubigel of our
[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:21.760]  wonderful 1530 WCKG affiliate that also has an FM station, but very soon is going to be
[03:00:21.760 --> 03:00:25.920]  covering the entire city from a very powerful position on top of a very important building.
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:30.320]  We will announce that in the next month. Stefan Malinu made a really good point. I was thinking
[03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:36.840]  about this this morning. What made the Western expansion across the United States so important
[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:41.800]  was you had dozens of different factions just in the tribes alone. You had the Spanish,
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:44.800]  you had the Russians, you had the British, you had the French, and you had all these
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:51.120]  other groups coming in to the Wild Wild West that was 95% empty. You had the tribes jockeying
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:56.560]  to get different Westerners to fight on their side. It was barbarous, but it was also empowering
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:01:01.760]  for humans. And that's why the invention and things came out of it, because we're meant
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:06.240]  to be trailblazing, we're meant to be pushed. And you read the annals of the people on wagon
[03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:09.880]  trains and all of it, even though they had kids dying and everything, it was invigorating,
[03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:14.240]  it was real. You walk around in a rich neighborhood, you walk around in a poor neighborhood. People
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:18.920]  are like zombies on their smartphones. They look unconscious. They look ugly. Even if
[03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:23.840]  a woman looks like she once had attractive features, they look like zombies. It's the
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:28.320]  television. It's the culture. It's the sedentary lifestyle. It's all of it. And then you look
[03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:33.160]  at the brain drain out of the countryside in America. And you know, I don't care what's
[03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:36.480]  black people, white people, they all look different. They look like they're had their
[03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:40.600]  souls sucked out, unless there's still some of the people still working on the land doing
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:44.400]  it. A lot of them are just kind of on welfare or doing little jobs, living in trailers,
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:49.320]  watching TV all day. They don't have a purpose. And then you see the attack on the ethos,
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:54.960]  the attack on the West, the attack on that because it was a consciousness. It was a culture.
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:01:59.280]  And instead they've given us this. It's total death. We got three minutes left, Steph, on
[03:01:59.280 --> 03:02:04.760]  Malinu, but the globalist brain drain from the third world is just like from the countryside
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:09.080]  to the cities. And the globalist then never even put enough money into the countries like
[03:02:09.080 --> 03:02:13.640]  Apple to let the Chinese have a livable wage like Henry Ford so they can buy the stinking
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:17.600]  iPhone. But as long as they say they're liberal and virtue signal, it's okay when they're
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:22.680]  the most anti-human, cold-blooded people admitting they don't want industrialization
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:29.320]  for the Chinese, for the Africans. They're just scum. They know they're scum. Go ahead.
[03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:33.040]  So the most important thing I think in this area, Alex, is something called the Pareto
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:36.400]  principle, which everyone needs to become familiar with. And the Pareto principle goes
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:42.040]  something like this. The square root of the number of people produces half the value of
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:46.040]  that group. So if you've got nine people, three people are producing half the value.
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:51.240]  If you have 100 people, 10 people, if you have 10,000 people in the company, 100 people
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:55.840]  are producing half the value. Now, if you have a company where smart people start to
[03:02:55.840 --> 03:03:00.560]  leave for whatever reason, then the smartest people leave, it means that the company productivity
[03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:06.960]  goes down enormously. If you get the top 100 people leaving, okay, you still have 9,900
[03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:11.480]  workers in a 10,000 worker company, but half your productivity is gone. This is why people
[03:03:11.480 --> 03:03:14.160]  become rich and other people middle class, other people are poor. There's a bell curve
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:19.960]  of productivity. Think of the third world. Western civilization rests on the brains,
[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:25.760]  hearts, minds, and muscle of maybe 2,000 people. Maybe. Maybe 2,000 people who innovated, who
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:30.360]  reasoned, who took risks, who scientifically, philosophically, economically moved us all
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:34.360]  forward. In the third world, there are a small number of people who can reform the third
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:38.760]  world and make it into a better place. Now, if the West comes along with the giant immigration
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:44.320]  suction machine, hoover those people up from the third world, then if the top 1% of smart
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:47.760]  people from the third world end up in the first world, what happens? The third world
[03:03:47.760 --> 03:03:51.600]  becomes catastrophically worse, and that means the next tier of people are desperate to get
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:55.440]  out and make it to the first world. And then there's a nose down. There's a third tier
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:04:00.000]  of people and we end up with a complete disaster and everyone migrating to Europe, the destruction
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.160]  of the wealth for a state, the undermining of Western civilization, all because the West
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:07.960]  could not resist the temptation of having instant taxpayers hoovered in from the third
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:11.320]  world and gave up on having children of their own.
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:14.920]  Absolutely beautifully said. I could not. I mean, that's it. And it's, it's designed
[03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:20.000]  to melt down and you read the globalist actuaries, they know they're doing this and then plan
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:25.280]  with AI and stuff to then control the implosion, which they're going to use to take over this.
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:28.000]  This has got to be stopped.
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:33.240]  And the only way to stop it is to defend your own culture and reason and speak and not adopt
[03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:38.360]  globalism rejected. Rejecting globalism is accepting life. Accepting globalism is submitting
[03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:45.160]  to death. Powerful. Love the new book, my friend, Stefan Malinu, the art of the deals
[03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:48.400]  out there, but he's got his new book, The Art of the Argument. Find it. Hey, thank you
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:49.400]  so much, my friend.
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:50.400]  Thank you.
[03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:52.840]  We'll be back.
[03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:57.760]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest cutting
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:05:05.720]  edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids. One of them is a powerful
[03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:11.720]  pro digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down, meet other proteins better.
[03:05:11.720 --> 03:05:18.880]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains
[03:05:18.880 --> 03:05:25.040]  in fluorolife advanced restoration. And we also have an every day extremely affordable
[03:05:25.040 --> 03:05:31.880]  fluorolife, everyday maintenance. But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the
[03:05:31.880 --> 03:05:38.920]  line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price. That is my goal
[03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:44.280]  here is to bring you the very best at the lowest price when you purchase it. And then
[03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:50.920]  for store.com, you know, you are also financing the globalist and the defense of our republic
[03:05:50.920 --> 03:05:59.800]  and freedom worldwide.
[03:05:59.800 --> 03:06:07.400]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones
[03:06:07.400 --> 03:06:13.600]  show.
[03:06:13.600 --> 03:06:18.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:06:18.680 --> 03:06:27.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide at WL of 1530 WCKG in Chicago, one
[03:06:27.200 --> 03:06:31.240]  of our great affiliates in the country. Co host here with the fourth hour, he's about
[03:06:31.240 --> 03:06:37.160]  to take over. But I wanted to come back on the broadcast here and just just just introduce
[03:06:37.160 --> 03:06:43.320]  something here with Thanksgiving, accelerating up on us so incredibly quickly. And it's just
[03:06:43.320 --> 03:06:49.720]  that when you study the attack on the West and you study the attack on free market, and
[03:06:49.720 --> 03:06:59.200]  when you study how the globalists
[03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:05.080]  are our engineering society.
[03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:14.160]  And you look at how cold blooded it is. You have their plan. And they knew that America
[03:07:14.160 --> 03:07:23.320]  found its soul and its new ethos in the West in the expansion and in the swashbuckling,
[03:07:23.320 --> 03:07:29.320]  freebooting experiences that happened.
[03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:38.480]  A new culture came out of it from the Native Americans and from the Spanish and from the
[03:07:38.480 --> 03:07:45.120]  French and the British and the Scots and the Irish and the Chinese and everything else.
[03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:51.600]  And that out of that came the most inventions, the most science rugged people strength. And
[03:07:51.600 --> 03:07:58.320]  America was in love with the idea of exploring and innovating and going out and taking a
[03:07:58.320 --> 03:08:10.000]  risk. The globalists want you in a nanny state hooked into a computer desperate and alone.
[03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:14.480]  And I know you know that and it's in the WikiLeaks and it's in the Facebook documents and it's
[03:08:14.480 --> 03:08:23.680]  in everything they do. And it's let's wake up from this nightmare. Let's say no to it.
[03:08:23.680 --> 03:08:29.880]  I mean you never see on the news the type of stuff that's gone on in Indonesia or that's
[03:08:29.880 --> 03:08:34.440]  gone on in Pacific islands or that's gone on in Africa or it's gone on in Latin America
[03:08:34.440 --> 03:08:39.680]  and the carnage and the enslavement and the murdering and the killing and the stealing
[03:08:39.680 --> 03:08:48.280]  and the rich elites that always openly say to anthropologists of course I keep the village
[03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:54.240]  poor hard to keep them in their place. That's the feudal system that they had in Europe
[03:08:54.240 --> 03:09:03.480]  that they had in China that they've had everywhere. And we're trying to get out of that monopoly.
[03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:06.920]  The idea that free markets wasteful because it makes you rich so we should get rid of
[03:09:06.920 --> 03:09:12.320]  it. Well the Soviet Union is even more destructive or China or North Korea. We need to have good
[03:09:12.320 --> 03:09:17.800]  clean living and get cleaner systems and we've done that and we've innovated that.
[03:09:17.800 --> 03:09:26.120]  But this guilt that they put on us has been cooked up by psychological warfare experts
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:32.560]  in their own admissions to attack our culture. I'm not saying our culture is perfect but
[03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:38.960]  they attack it because they're overriding it with something that isn't a culture. It's
[03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:44.560]  a system of guilt and fear of knowledge and fear of words and fear of communication and
[03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:55.480]  fear of real diversity. It's a prison system turning us all into groups in our little sub
[03:09:55.480 --> 03:10:04.560]  area. And it's the final end game of authoritarianism and the entire battle group structure of
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:11.840]  the globalist is they are preparing the way for the new species and cannot wait to dispatch
[03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:19.000]  us in an orderly way. Not through war but through chemical, biological and electromagnetic
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:28.360]  systems. They've got technology where they can hit a button and make everybody's heart
[03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:37.160]  stop. It puts out an electromagnetic wavelength pulse that makes your brain trigger death.
[03:10:37.160 --> 03:10:44.160]  It kills almost everybody. They've had it for 60 years. They've had neutron bombs for
[03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:51.240]  60 years. That's another system. I mean, it's unlimited, ladies and gentlemen. And that's
[03:10:51.240 --> 03:10:57.200]  the power trip. They used our money, our ideas, our ingenuity to build all this super science
[03:10:57.200 --> 03:11:01.000]  and now notice they want to kind of slow technology down. Oh, forget it. That stuff's never going
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:06.920]  to come out. That's because they're warehousing. The SR-71 Blackbird was developed in the late
[03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:13.520]  1940s and it was in service by the mid 1950s, just classified and then wasn't unveiled later
[03:11:13.520 --> 03:11:20.640]  until the 60s. The SR-71 Blackbird admittedly can go about Mach 5, but reportedly it's a
[03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:26.440]  lot faster. It's a space plane. It flies up into space. Now, do you believe an aircraft
[03:11:26.440 --> 03:11:34.040]  in service in 1955 is still the fastest aircraft in the world? The answer is no, it's not.
[03:11:34.040 --> 03:11:39.040]  And that's just the beginning of it, ladies and gentlemen. And so the globalists, the
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:44.840]  elite psychopaths, they are seeing all this and are testing it on us and now really do
[03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:51.160]  have massive life extension. They've got stuff that's AI. It's just not self-aware, but it's
[03:11:51.160 --> 03:11:56.640]  artificially intelligent. And what we know they've got is so advanced that that's why
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:12:02.640]  they act like we don't even exist now. They've got a plan. They're carrying it out and they
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:06.560]  don't want us to be aware of it or to have any culture. And people that are part of it
[03:12:06.560 --> 03:12:11.480]  are scared and are there dutifully following their orders. You watch those Google, Facebook
[03:12:11.480 --> 03:12:16.400]  and Twitter executives in those hearings attacking Info Wars. They were scared of Congress and
[03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:20.640]  they were scared and they were there like little scientists. Yesterday we're doing it.
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:25.080]  Program operational is, we're going to shut them down, don't worry, because they've been
[03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:30.360]  dialed in. They want themselves to be safe. That's why almost none of them have families
[03:12:30.360 --> 03:12:37.840]  because they're saying no one in the EU leadership now has children except for five countries
[03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:41.840]  that are pulling out of it. They all have kids. All the major elites don't have children
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:50.960]  now, ladies and gentlemen, because they've been told you may not get access into the
[03:12:50.960 --> 03:12:56.120]  ARC centers, the below ground facilities in places during this if you've got kids and
[03:12:56.120 --> 03:12:59.120]  we don't want your kids there. They're like, we understand. I mean, we're close, folks.
[03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:02.640]  None of them are having kids because they wouldn't put kids through what's about to
[03:13:02.640 --> 03:13:07.200]  happen. I'm having more. I'm taking everything. I'm putting everything I got on the table.
[03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:10.560]  I'm going to have more children. We're going into this. We're going to win. Putting everything
[03:13:10.560 --> 03:13:14.840]  on the line. I'm not a coward. I'm having more. And I love them more than my life a
[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:18.320]  thousand times. And that's why I love them enough to put them on the table so they have
[03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:22.680]  a future and I'm not going to give up on humanity just because these sick psychopaths have decided
[03:13:22.680 --> 03:13:26.600]  to bring in world government, kill everybody. Because let me tell you something, the words
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:30.600]  out on what you've done. I don't care how much AI you've got, how many droid armies
[03:13:30.600 --> 03:13:36.560]  you've got, how many drone air forces you've got. They got 20,000 predator drones, folks.
[03:13:36.560 --> 03:13:39.960]  That's not for foreign governments. That's for us. That's for our military to take them
[03:13:39.960 --> 03:13:46.920]  out. I said this 20 years ago, reading DARPA documents in the two terminators ago, you
[03:13:46.920 --> 03:13:52.160]  learn it's a crazy woman who uploaded her brain into Skynet and it's what nuked everything
[03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:56.360]  and took over. And they're just telling you what they're doing. They're crazy people that
[03:13:56.360 --> 03:14:00.240]  want to upload themselves into machines. They believe they're God and they want to kill the
[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:04.400]  scourge that's on the planet first because they're projecting their hatred of themselves
[03:14:04.400 --> 03:14:09.360]  onto us and they really believe they're going to get away with this. And I'm here to tell
[03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:16.000]  them, you're not going to get away with your plan, your self-driving cars, all your crud,
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:19.760]  you're bringing out. You're going to get away with a lot of it, but down the road, even
[03:14:19.760 --> 03:14:24.320]  if you're successful in the first 95% of your operation, you're going to be dug out of those
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:31.640]  holes and you're going to be begging to God of those holes. Do you people think your instinct
[03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:35.320]  to kill everybody and your instinct to stab people in the back and your instinct to hate
[03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:40.320]  humanity is going to stop when you're all put yourselves in hell under the ground, gone
[03:14:40.320 --> 03:14:45.600]  into rat holes yourself so you can try to wipe everybody out? Good luck, scum. Good
[03:14:45.600 --> 03:14:52.320]  luck. I'm telling you right now, your new world order is dead. Your EU is dead. Your
[03:14:52.320 --> 03:14:57.600]  whole project's dead. Here's the problem. All the AI, all the corruption, even though
[03:14:57.600 --> 03:15:02.840]  your system's being betrayed, you were just building it. There's going to be bigger wars
[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:06.080]  and there's going to be all sorts of problems. If we try to not destroy ourselves, we still
[03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:11.760]  might. And so we're entering an incredible time to be alive and we need people to be
[03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:17.200]  informed and know what's going on and understand that you can get next year's news today. Not
[03:15:17.200 --> 03:15:22.360]  because we're rocket scientists, because we're following their operations. They operate out
[03:15:22.360 --> 03:15:28.040]  in the open like you're an idiot. We're here simply telling you what their plan is and

[03:15:32.240 --> 03:15:37.440]  These are homicidal psychopathic killers. So remember this Thanksgiving, all the attacks
[03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:42.240]  on the West is because the West isn't out to totally murder you and wants prosperity
[03:15:42.240 --> 03:15:54.000]  in an idea. And they want to kill that idea. Matt Doobie L takes over straight ahead.

[03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:29.280]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex
[03:20:29.280 --> 03:20:38.940]  Jones. We'll be filling in for the great Alex Jones from Chicago from the WCKG studios
[03:20:38.940 --> 03:20:46.160]  on AM 1530 in Chicago and FM 102.3. It was just listening myself to Alex talking with
[03:20:46.160 --> 03:20:51.080]  Stefan Mullenew and I want to talk about some of the things that Stefan was bringing up
[03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:57.080]  with Alex. But before we do, like I do every time I step in, I want to say thanks to the
[03:20:57.080 --> 03:21:03.120]  folks at Infowars. Thanks to Alex for letting me pop in and bring attention to Chicago.
[03:21:03.120 --> 03:21:09.480]  You're not going to hear on the news that the death toll for November is 24 in the month
[03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:16.680]  of November. November 24 people dead in Chicago, most of them due to gun violence. I'm not
[03:21:16.680 --> 03:21:23.080]  a proponent of banning or blocking or inhibiting our Second Amendment rights. In fact, I believe
[03:21:23.080 --> 03:21:29.200]  the solution to that problem, the problem in Chicago that it's Las Vegas every month
[03:21:29.200 --> 03:21:35.880]  in slow motion, Las Vegas every month in slow motion in Chicago. And why is this important
[03:21:35.880 --> 03:21:39.840]  to you if you're not in Chicago? Why do you care? Why do you give a crap if you're not
[03:21:39.840 --> 03:21:45.560]  in Chicago, if you're not in Detroit, if you're not in Missouri, another terrible St. Louis,
[03:21:45.560 --> 03:21:51.520]  another terrible crime-ridden city? A beautiful city, but terribly crime-ridden. It's got
[03:21:51.520 --> 03:21:55.000]  a crime problem. It's got a murder problem. It's got an illegal gun problem. It's got
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:22:00.000]  a gangbanger problem. It's got a drug problem. Why do you care if you're in Omaha? Why do
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:03.920]  you care if you're in the South? Why do you care if you're not in a big city because it's
[03:22:03.920 --> 03:22:09.360]  coming to a theater near you? And I don't mean via the movies. I mean via real life.
[03:22:09.360 --> 03:22:13.400]  So what you see happening in Detroit, what you see happening in Chicago, what you see
[03:22:13.400 --> 03:22:17.760]  happening in New York, just like what you see happening on Twitter sometimes and what
[03:22:17.760 --> 03:22:23.480]  you see happening on Facebook sometimes is a snake preview. How will the people react?
[03:22:23.480 --> 03:22:27.800]  How will the plebs react? What will happen when this happens? So you can lay down and
[03:22:27.800 --> 03:22:36.120]  take it or you can take action. Twenty-four people dead in November for the month of November
[03:22:36.120 --> 03:22:46.120]  24. For the year 2017, we're at 616 dead. Now, I don't know what the total is. Maybe
[03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:52.880]  somebody can do the math since Rahm Emanuel took office in 2011, but more people I believe
[03:22:52.880 --> 03:22:58.200]  have died in Chicago than have died in some wars. It's our home turf here. So I like to
[03:22:58.200 --> 03:23:03.480]  bring attention to that every time I'm on because, as I said, it's coming to a theater
[03:23:03.480 --> 03:23:08.520]  near you. It's coming. It's Las Vegas every month in slow motion here in Chicago. And
[03:23:08.520 --> 03:23:13.520]  if it's allowed to happen in Vegas, if it's allowed to happen in Chicago, it's allowed
[03:23:13.520 --> 03:23:18.320]  to, going to be allowed to happen in your town, USA, even though your police are being
[03:23:18.320 --> 03:23:22.960]  militarized, even though your local police department may have a really shiny, cool tank
[03:23:22.960 --> 03:23:29.240]  and lots of combat gear for the police while they're being underwritten by the feds. My
[03:23:29.240 --> 03:23:34.520]  name is Matt, and I'm not necessarily going to keep having kids, although I'd love to.
[03:23:34.520 --> 03:23:38.320]  I have four kids myself. Alex, if you just missed it in the last break, he was talking
[03:23:38.320 --> 03:23:45.840]  about having more kids. And probably a lot of us Americans need to be doing that. The
[03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:51.600]  other side, the other people are some of them breeding like crazy. And over time, there's
[03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:57.480]  some polls that will show you that radical Islamists are going to be outbreeding Christian
[03:23:57.480 --> 03:24:02.560]  conservative Americans and just level headed people in general over the course of the next
[03:24:02.560 --> 03:24:09.160]  10, 20 and 30 years and beyond. Whether you're going to be having more kids or no kids, many
[03:24:09.160 --> 03:24:14.120]  of us in the United States, hopefully you with people you love are going to be celebrating
[03:24:14.120 --> 03:24:19.920]  Thanksgiving. It's a holiday that is one of my favorites. We celebrate it in my home.
[03:24:19.920 --> 03:24:26.240]  We have about 40 people over people. I love more than anything. It's a good time. It's
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:32.640]  a great time to reflect not only on the things that we have to be thankful for as Americans,
[03:24:32.640 --> 03:24:38.200]  but the things we have to be thankful for as human beings. Some of us practice being
[03:24:38.200 --> 03:24:43.120]  grateful on a daily basis. Some of us forget. Some of us do it in our prayer. Some of us
[03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:47.480]  do it when we wake up in the morning and when we go to bed at night. Thank God for our heart
[03:24:47.480 --> 03:24:53.080]  beating and our lungs breathing and our brain working. Those sort of simple things, the things
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:25:02.240]  that we're able to enjoy, our ability to walk. If you're a woman, the ability to speak, to
[03:25:02.240 --> 03:25:09.640]  not have to be covered up in a sweaty garment as a law, to be able to walk freely, to be
[03:25:09.640 --> 03:25:15.720]  able to drive like everybody else. Some of these things we all take for granted and it's
[03:25:15.720 --> 03:25:19.640]  human nature because you just get into everyday life and you just take it for granted while
[03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:26.600]  I can drive. I'm really grateful for the guy and people that invented the automobile. I
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:31.160]  don't have to take a horse and buggy to wherever I'm going. I don't have to churn the butter
[03:25:31.160 --> 03:25:37.240]  in order for us to eat. Thank you. It's great to be thankful. It's great to be grateful.
[03:25:37.240 --> 03:25:40.480]  And there are studies out there that show the more grateful you are, the more thankful
[03:25:40.480 --> 03:25:47.080]  you are, the better you feel, the better the life around you is. The better things happen
[03:25:47.080 --> 03:25:52.160]  to you. Some people might say it's part of the simulation. It's part of the code in
[03:25:52.160 --> 03:25:56.520]  the simulation that we're experiencing. Others will say that that's just the way it is and
[03:25:56.520 --> 03:26:01.880]  that's the way God works. Either way, no matter what you believe, no matter who you pray to,
[03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:06.160]  no matter what you celebrate, if you're an American and you're celebrating Thanksgiving,
[03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:10.360]  you're likely going to be getting together with many family members, many, many family
[03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:15.880]  members. Not all of them are going to agree with you. Not all of them see things the way
[03:26:15.880 --> 03:26:23.280]  that you see things. And how do you deal with that? How do you handle the Thanksgiving festivities
[03:26:23.280 --> 03:26:27.240]  when you know that that one cousin or that one aunt or that one uncle, or maybe you're
[03:26:27.240 --> 03:26:31.680]  the one cousin and you're the one aunt or you're the one uncle? How do you red pill
[03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:35.520]  the people you love the most, the people that you want to be on your side the most, the
[03:26:35.520 --> 03:26:43.160]  people that you have the best chance of getting in the foxhole next to you if the fit hits
[03:26:43.160 --> 03:26:48.880]  the shan like it could and like it probably will one day when it's going to be very important
[03:26:48.880 --> 03:26:55.280]  to be around people that are like minded on the same team. How do you red pill those people
[03:26:55.280 --> 03:27:03.640]  so that you have a network that you can count on? How do you do it without ruining the holiday?
[03:27:03.640 --> 03:27:08.120]  How do you do it without getting the frying pan? How do you do it so that you're not sitting
[03:27:08.120 --> 03:27:10.840]  in one room and everyone else is sitting in another and everyone's going, well, we're
[03:27:10.840 --> 03:27:14.760]  not going there again. We're not going to so-and-so's house for Thanksgiving or we're
[03:27:14.760 --> 03:27:21.320]  not inviting so-and-so to Thanksgiving. I can't tell you what to do. I can only share
[03:27:21.320 --> 03:27:27.220]  with you what I do and I do this every year when I host Thanksgiving. I'm going to give
[03:27:27.220 --> 03:27:34.120]  you the things that I do in order to red pill my family without coming off as a douche without
[03:27:34.120 --> 03:27:39.320]  everybody leaving going, oh man, we're not going back there. Some of you might think
[03:27:39.320 --> 03:27:44.960]  it's oversimplified, but I'm going to tell you it works like a charm. It works for my
[03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:51.920]  kids. It works for my family. We all have a great time. We are celebrating the gift of
[03:27:51.920 --> 03:27:58.440]  being an American. We're celebrating the gift of being thankful for being free. We have
[03:27:58.440 --> 03:28:04.440]  a bill of rights. We have a constitution and every year everybody leaves happy, happy,
[03:28:04.440 --> 03:28:08.800]  happy, happy as the duck commander guy would say. So we're going to talk about that coming
[03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:13.160]  up in the next segment. We're also going to talk a little bit about this video I saw.
[03:28:13.160 --> 03:28:20.960]  I saw an Info Wars reporter, Millie Weaver, in the trenches. Boy, she's got some guts
[03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:28.040]  and the way she handled herself was pretty phenomenal and the amount of hate and vitriol.
[03:28:28.040 --> 03:28:34.440]  And it was so disgusting to me to see how people treated her, but I was grateful and
[03:28:34.440 --> 03:28:39.320]  thankful for the way that she behaved and how she handled herself. I want to point some
[03:28:39.320 --> 03:28:43.760]  of that out. I'll also point out some of the things I noticed about our president's press
[03:28:43.760 --> 03:28:50.320]  conference last week. His little bottle of water gaff that everybody says is a gaff.
[03:28:50.320 --> 03:28:55.320]  I see it a little bit differently. A commemorative President Trump dollar for only $5? Yes, the

[03:31:53.120 --> 03:31:58.200]  I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding our operation by
[03:31:58.200 --> 03:32:03.800]  purchasing products at InfoWarsTore.com, we would not be here. We don't have corporate

[03:32:12.880 --> 03:32:19.920]  support us symbiotically as we try to retake this country and the planet and heal the population
[03:32:19.920 --> 03:32:24.600]  that's been under globalist engineering. That said, we're running biggest specials
[03:32:24.600 --> 03:32:30.480]  ever every single year during Black Friday and this year is even better than last year.

[03:33:21.760 --> 03:33:28.240]  Well, sort of. I'm defending and doing that stuff on behalf of Alex Jones for the fourth
[03:33:28.240 --> 03:33:35.480]  hour. My name is Matt Dubiel and I'm the big mouth here at WCKG in Chicago, AM 1530, FM
[03:33:35.480 --> 03:33:42.280]  102.3. Today I am personally powered by Brainforce. If you want to try something that is a little
[03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:47.320]  better than coffee, a little bit better than shoving energy drinks down your pipe, I can
[03:33:47.320 --> 03:33:52.720]  say that I've been taking Brainforce for about a month now and it's working. It is working
[03:33:52.720 --> 03:33:58.380]  and it doesn't give you that energy drink buzz with the two o'clock crash. The good
[03:33:58.380 --> 03:34:05.200]  news is, is if you go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com right now for a limited
[03:34:05.200 --> 03:34:12.880]  time only, there's a holiday special 50% off Brainforce plus 50% off Brainforce plus.
[03:34:12.880 --> 03:34:17.280]  Get it. Get it now. Try it. You'll thank me. You'll thank those people over there. All
[03:34:17.280 --> 03:34:21.520]  right. So Thanksgiving is coming up. Thursday is Thanksgiving. At my house, we have everyone
[03:34:21.520 --> 03:34:28.920]  over. My role at Thanksgiving is we cook three turkeys and one of them we deep fry and the
[03:34:28.920 --> 03:34:33.760]  other two we cook traditionally and the family comes over and it's one of the greatest days
[03:34:33.760 --> 03:34:38.480]  of the year. It's one of the things I look forward to all year because I love my family.
[03:34:38.480 --> 03:34:43.800]  We have a big family. My kids are there. I get to show them what family is all about.
[03:34:43.800 --> 03:34:49.600]  A lot of times you and I, we tell people, we tell people they should watch this movie.
[03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:54.720]  We tell people they should watch this video. We tell people, listen to Alex or listen to
[03:34:54.720 --> 03:35:02.920]  this guy, listen to Stefan Molinou, follow so and so. We tell, tell, tell, tell. And
[03:35:02.920 --> 03:35:11.080]  if you're a father, if you've had a father, what you'll notice is your father shows you.
[03:35:11.080 --> 03:35:16.960]  He tells you, but he also shows you. And as children that have been brought up by fathers,
[03:35:16.960 --> 03:35:20.760]  what we end up doing is, is we end up doing what our father showed us. Sometimes we don't
[03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:26.600]  do what he told us to do, but we almost always do what he showed us to do. So I told you
[03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:33.680]  that I would share with you the way to red pill your entire family at Thanksgiving. This
[03:35:33.680 --> 03:35:41.080]  is a foolproof way for you to red pill your entire family to the virtues of doing the
[03:35:41.080 --> 03:35:46.280]  right thing, to the virtues of maybe even being conservative and having the right ideals
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:52.840]  without alienating your family, without having them think that you're just an a-hole and
[03:35:52.840 --> 03:35:57.880]  without ruining the holiday. Here's how you do it. Now and think, imagine, you know, fast
[03:35:57.880 --> 03:36:03.440]  forward it to Thursday, maybe you're going to have football on. And inevitably the conversation
[03:36:03.440 --> 03:36:07.360]  is going to come up between family members about football, like, ah, what do you think
[03:36:07.360 --> 03:36:11.040]  about, you know, the football players and what do you think about the standing and what
[03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:18.320]  do you think about the kneeling and it's a trap. It's a trap because no matter what
[03:36:18.320 --> 03:36:25.320]  you think and no matter what uncle so-and-so thinks, what you both know is you love each
[03:36:25.320 --> 03:36:30.040]  other and it's going to be a good day if you can find some common ground and love each
[03:36:30.040 --> 03:36:37.480]  other. Now I'm not suggesting that you roll over and say that maybe something should happen
[03:36:37.480 --> 03:36:41.600]  that you don't believe in. I'm not suggesting that you advocate for the NFL players if you
[03:36:41.600 --> 03:36:47.360]  don't believe in it. What I'm suggesting is that maybe you show and not tell. And I'm
[03:36:47.360 --> 03:36:52.000]  going to explain exactly what I mean and I'm going to share with you, and this may seem
[03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:56.560]  a little corny, but I'm going to share with you a poem that my dad shared with me and
[03:36:56.560 --> 03:37:01.360]  that I've shared with my children. And I think that as I share this poem with you, it's called
[03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:09.160]  if and you can find it online. It's very old. It's by Rudyard Kipling. Rudyard Kipling
[03:37:09.160 --> 03:37:14.600]  wrote this poem if. And as I tell you about it, as I share it with you, I think you're
[03:37:14.600 --> 03:37:21.080]  going to realize that it very much describes our current president as least as he's showing
[03:37:21.080 --> 03:37:27.000]  himself to us right now. And it definitely describes the way that I was brought up and
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:32.240]  it describes to my children the way that we intend on living our lives. And I'm just
[03:37:32.240 --> 03:37:38.480]  going to start it out because the synopsis of it is if you can keep your head when all
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:44.200]  about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. If you can keep your head when all
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:50.440]  about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. Now imagine play through the last
[03:37:50.440 --> 03:37:56.240]  couple of years and the presidential race, the primary, the current state of politics
[03:37:56.240 --> 03:38:01.600]  as I read and I share this poem with you. Imagine how you're going to display to your
[03:38:01.600 --> 03:38:05.160]  family, how you're going to show, not tell. You're not going to tell everybody about
[03:38:05.160 --> 03:38:09.640]  your politics. You're just going to show them about your values. It goes like this. This
[03:38:09.640 --> 03:38:15.560]  is called if. If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for
[03:38:15.560 --> 03:38:22.320]  their doubting too. If you can wait, not being tired by waiting or being lied about, don't
[03:38:22.320 --> 03:38:29.040]  deal in lies or being hated. Don't give way to hating and yet don't look too good nor
[03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:36.960]  walk too wise. If you can dream and not make dreams your master. If you can think and not
[03:38:36.960 --> 03:38:43.880]  make thoughts your aim. If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters
[03:38:43.880 --> 03:38:51.160]  just the same. If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken twisted by naves to make
[03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:58.680]  a trap for fools or watch the things you gave your life to broken and stoop and build them
[03:38:58.680 --> 03:39:04.360]  up with worn out tools. I'm getting chills when I read this. I get chills when I give
[03:39:04.360 --> 03:39:11.080]  it. I get chills when I read it to my kids. If you can make one heap of all your winnings
[03:39:11.080 --> 03:39:19.080]  and risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss and lose and start again at your beginnings
[03:39:19.080 --> 03:39:26.480]  and never breathe a word about your loss. If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
[03:39:26.480 --> 03:39:32.520]  to serve your turn long after they are gone and so hold on when there is nothing in you
[03:39:32.520 --> 03:39:39.280]  except the will which says to them hold on. If you can talk with crowds and keep your
[03:39:39.280 --> 03:39:47.360]  virtue or walk with kings nor lose the common touch. Think about that. Think about it. If
[03:39:47.360 --> 03:39:55.640]  neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you. If all men count with you but none too much.
[03:39:55.640 --> 03:40:02.120]  If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run. Yours
[03:40:02.120 --> 03:40:12.880]  is the earth and everything that's in it and which is more. You'll be a man. My son.
[03:40:12.880 --> 03:40:21.800]  Read that. Read that to your family. Dads. Sons. Read that. It applies to women. Put
[03:40:21.800 --> 03:40:28.120]  a woe in front of the man. It applies to women. It's all about being who you are. It's all
[03:40:28.120 --> 03:40:35.040]  about fighting through adversity. Read it again and spend some time with it and look
[03:40:35.040 --> 03:40:41.160]  at it and think about the course of events over the last twelve months. The previous
[03:40:41.160 --> 03:40:46.000]  twelve months. Think about the things that we've been through as Americans. Think about
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:52.120]  the things our president has been through as a candidate. Think about the things he pushed
[03:40:52.120 --> 03:40:58.760]  through as a candidate. Think about the barbs and attacks. Think about the things that he
[03:40:58.760 --> 03:41:07.000]  said and how they were twisted around and then read the passages from this poem. If
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:12.600]  he's lived it in front of us. Now I'm not suggesting you be a fanboy for Trump and be
[03:41:12.600 --> 03:41:17.480]  his apologist. I'm not suggesting that you stand in front of your family and tell them
[03:41:17.480 --> 03:41:22.760]  how great the president is if they believe that other people, what other people are saying,
[03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:28.000]  if they're indoctrinated by the CNNs and the MSNBCs and the ESPNs and the New York Times
[03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:37.400]  and pretty much all the media. All I'm suggesting to you is on Thanksgiving just to be that
[03:41:37.400 --> 03:41:42.880]  man or woman that you're here to be. Don't talk about any of that stuff. Show don't
[03:41:42.880 --> 03:41:48.400]  tell. Show how you love everyone. Show that your table is made for everyone. Show that
[03:41:48.400 --> 03:41:55.800]  you have more in common than you do that separates you. And over time, eventually somebody will
[03:41:55.800 --> 03:42:00.640]  ask you what your thoughts are on a certain issue. How do you feel about this issue? How
[03:42:00.640 --> 03:42:05.800]  do you feel about that issue? How do you feel about President Trump or candidate Trump?
[03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:11.480]  And when they see that you've behaved as a man consistently, when they see that you
[03:42:11.480 --> 03:42:17.280]  have shown and not told, you'll find they're going to listen to you and they'll listen
[03:42:17.280 --> 03:42:23.040]  well. And you'll find that you'll have a better chance of maybe not red pilling everybody,
[03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:28.640]  but certainly red pilling your immediate family, your kids, your nieces, your nephews, the
[03:42:28.640 --> 03:42:33.920]  ones closest to you. They'll look at you like you have your act together because you do.
[03:42:33.920 --> 03:42:40.280]  I want to talk about this Millie Weaver video. Millie was in the trenches. And boy, my hat
[03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:44.720]  is literally off to Millie. I also want to talk about a president drinking the Fiji water
[03:42:44.720 --> 03:42:49.440]  and why I think that was masterful. It's Matt Dubial filling in for Alex Jones. Read that
[03:42:49.440 --> 03:42:52.120]  poem if, share it with your family.

[03:43:52.120 --> 03:43:57.040]  America is an information based civil war. That's why now more than ever we've got a
[03:43:57.040 --> 03:44:02.080]  hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their

[03:44:09.160 --> 03:44:15.240]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[03:44:15.240 --> 03:44:22.080]  the counter culture. The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism
[03:44:22.080 --> 03:44:28.200]  and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a counter fit of Thomas
[03:44:28.200 --> 03:44:34.120]  Geverson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech,
[03:44:34.120 --> 03:44:38.880]  meet like-minded friends and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more than 60 original

[03:47:18.240 --> 03:47:25.840]  Jones. We look a little different. It's Matt Dubio
[03:47:25.840 --> 03:47:33.000]  filling in for Alex Jones. I am the big mouth here at WCKG in Chicago and I'm delighted
[03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:42.560]  and thrilled to be sitting in for the fourth hour at infowars.com slash show. I can't
[03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:50.640]  recommend strongly enough to you to go to infowarstore or infowarslife.com and get yourself
[03:47:50.640 --> 03:47:57.480]  brain force 50% off, holiday special. It's my understanding that there is a fantabulous
[03:47:57.480 --> 03:48:06.320]  34 plus maybe at least 34 hour super broadcast coming up on Monday, Cyber Monday. If I read
[03:48:06.320 --> 03:48:16.000]  the tweets, I'm on Twitter too. I'm broadcasting from Chicago here where there are 24 casualties
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:27.560]  in the month of November sadly and we're at 616 deaths so far in 2017. Over 700 car jackings
[03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:36.240]  in Chicago in this year and they're in certain neighborhoods. You're safe if you're in downtown
[03:48:36.240 --> 03:48:43.200]  Chicago. You're safe if you're in certain suburbs. You're safe if you're in the airport
[03:48:43.200 --> 03:48:48.960]  areas and those communities. It's when you head to the west side and the south side where
[03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:54.400]  the carnage is really taking place that there's a lot of problems. People know where to go
[03:48:54.400 --> 03:48:59.200]  and where to stay out of. Unfortunately, the people that live there and the human beings
[03:48:59.200 --> 03:49:06.240]  that are there every day are the ones that end up being caught in the crossfire. We're
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:12.400]  working on spreading this message because the news does not cover these deaths when
[03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:17.800]  they play the 10 o'clock news on channel 2, on channel 5, on channel 7, on channel 9.
[03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:24.360]  We've never had more news channels than ever before and we've never had more news programs
[03:49:24.360 --> 03:49:28.600]  that used to be they just had the 10 o'clock news and now they have like the 5 o'clock
[03:49:28.600 --> 03:49:36.760]  news and the 6 o'clock news and they'll talk about some new BS unicorn Frappuccino that
[03:49:36.760 --> 03:49:42.720]  Starbucks is putting out. They'll talk about, they'll show people waiting in line for the
[03:49:42.720 --> 03:49:50.920]  new iPhone in downtown Chicago and they don't show the names and they don't say the names
[03:49:50.920 --> 03:49:56.200]  and they don't show the faces of the people that are being slaughtered every day as it's
[03:49:56.200 --> 03:50:01.560]  Las Vegas in slow motion every day here in Chicago. They don't talk about those people.
[03:50:01.560 --> 03:50:06.480]  Somebody needs to and we're working on doing that in a bigger way. How do we do that here
[03:50:06.480 --> 03:50:10.640]  and how can you do it? You hear people on InfoWars all the time. Share the links, share
[03:50:10.640 --> 03:50:14.320]  the links, share the links. The other way is for you to support these local stations
[03:50:14.320 --> 03:50:19.480]  that carry these shows. We, for instance, have not only are we carrying the Alex Jones
[03:50:19.480 --> 03:50:24.680]  show here in Chicago but we're also carrying real news with David Knight mornings from
[03:50:24.680 --> 03:50:30.120]  8 a.m. central to 11 a.m. central. It's a great show. It's a great alternative to Glenn
[03:50:30.120 --> 03:50:35.640]  Beck and the other crap that the National Syndicators put out. We carry the War Room
[03:50:35.640 --> 03:50:41.520]  with Owen Schreuer and sometimes Roger Stone when he's in and when he's, you know, whether
[03:50:41.520 --> 03:50:48.200]  he's in or not and Owen and the War Room is another great alternative to the afternoon
[03:50:48.200 --> 03:50:52.920]  programming that you are offered and force fed around the country where they're just
[03:50:52.920 --> 03:50:58.680]  talking about the same crap, Mitch McConnell this and Paul Ryan that over and over again,
[03:50:58.680 --> 03:51:04.120]  the same dopey four conservative talk show. It's really great. If you're a station manager,
[03:51:04.120 --> 03:51:09.480]  you got to consider these shows. If you are a listener in those areas and you're listening
[03:51:09.480 --> 03:51:13.640]  to the radio station carrying Alex Jones right now, send them an email. Send that radio
[03:51:13.640 --> 03:51:17.400]  station an email and tell them that they should really take a look at real news and they should
[03:51:17.400 --> 03:51:22.520]  really take a look at the War Room. We're doing it here in Chicago. Tell them WCKG is
[03:51:22.520 --> 03:51:28.680]  doing it in market three and we're not just going to do it on a.m. 1530. We're building
[03:51:28.680 --> 03:51:37.480]  an FM radio station and it isn't cheap, believe me. I could go broke building this FM radio
[03:51:37.480 --> 03:51:43.560]  station and Alex talked about it a little bit earlier. We're building this FM 102.3 and right
[03:51:43.560 --> 03:51:50.120]  now it just covers a little five mile radius in Elmhurst near the airport and it's eventually
[03:51:50.120 --> 03:51:57.800]  very soon with your help going to be covering parts of the Chicago area where this murdering
[03:51:57.800 --> 03:52:03.720]  is going on and we can help bring light, bring to light to the people that aren't hearing this on
[03:52:03.720 --> 03:52:10.360]  the news. What is actually going on in their backyard? You can help us if you go to WCKG.com
[03:52:10.360 --> 03:52:17.240]  slash support. The video that we had up there of Alex sharing why it's so important to support
[03:52:17.240 --> 03:52:23.000]  local radio stations has been removed by Facebook or YouTube. We're not sure why but we're going
[03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:28.920]  to replace it. But we could use your support because what happens is the advertisers get
[03:52:28.920 --> 03:52:35.480]  pressured from the likes of Media Matters or the likes of other organizations and they leave
[03:52:35.480 --> 03:52:41.240]  and they try and pressure these radio stations like mine into carrying other sports programming
[03:52:41.240 --> 03:52:48.040]  or other network programming that isn't quite what is in line with what we're sharing. It doesn't
[03:52:48.040 --> 03:52:54.200]  quite get the truth out the same way. So we need your help that comes in the form of donations
[03:52:54.200 --> 03:53:01.080]  in form of support, sponsorships support, whatever you can do WCKG.com slash support.
[03:53:01.080 --> 03:53:06.600]  I want to talk about this Millie Weaver video. Millie Weaver speaking of going into the areas
[03:53:06.600 --> 03:53:10.920]  where you know it's dangerous, you know in Chicago we don't go to the south side where
[03:53:10.920 --> 03:53:14.440]  people are getting capped. We don't go to the west side where people are getting capped.
[03:53:15.080 --> 03:53:21.240]  Here Millie Weaver and I'm looking at it with you. You can watch it at infowars.com slash show.
[03:53:21.880 --> 03:53:29.560]  I'm watching Millie Weaver literally going into the trenches here at an event in Texas
[03:53:29.560 --> 03:53:34.520]  where Hillary Clinton was doing a book signing for I don't even know the name of her book.
[03:53:34.520 --> 03:53:37.560]  It's getting to the point where I don't want to even promote it. I know that nobody's buying
[03:53:37.560 --> 03:53:43.160]  the damn book anyway. She's got to give it away. But if you watch this video besides watching it
[03:53:43.160 --> 03:53:47.800]  with me as I share what I witnessed, you're going to want to watch this video later on
[03:53:48.440 --> 03:53:56.600]  tonight or when you have some time. And it really is the title is Clinton Zombies Invade Austin.
[03:53:56.600 --> 03:54:04.680]  And that is the perfect title. I often refer to the masses as the zombie nation.
[03:54:05.640 --> 03:54:12.920]  And the zombie nation is really scary. Back a while ago the CDC, the Center for Disease Control
[03:54:12.920 --> 03:54:19.000]  even had this what to do in the case of a zombie apocalypse. And people laughed about it and they
[03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:24.760]  went oh that's so cute. It's like it's related to the zombie TV shows and the zombie movies.
[03:54:24.760 --> 03:54:30.680]  It's code you guys. They're not talking about the zombies in the TV shows. They're talking about
[03:54:30.680 --> 03:54:37.800]  the zombies that have been indoctrinated and been converted into people that will turn on you.
[03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:45.480]  Watch the zombies turn on Millie Weaver. Now I'm not saying these people were always zombies.
[03:54:45.480 --> 03:54:53.400]  Some of them are wives and daughters and mothers. And somehow over time after they're smiling and
[03:54:53.400 --> 03:54:58.440]  after they're just kind of engaging in conversation and maybe they were at a bake sale earlier,
[03:54:58.440 --> 03:55:04.760]  they get in line at this Hillary Clinton event. And the zombies attack. There's zombies grabbing
[03:55:04.760 --> 03:55:10.520]  Millie's microphone. There's zombies you can see. They don't quite shape shift. And this is where
[03:55:10.520 --> 03:55:16.520]  people are going to go whoa, whoa. Doobie, you had me when you were talking about the if poem.
[03:55:16.520 --> 03:55:21.000]  You had me at Thanksgiving. You had me at leading your family. But then you talked about shape
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:32.280]  shifting. Whoa. Well, not every shape shifter is a literal shape shifter. Okay, watch these people.
[03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:39.320]  Watch them shape shift from daughters and mothers and grandmas. Some of these grandmas pick their
[03:55:39.320 --> 03:55:43.880]  kids up and they take them for the McDonald's Happy Meal after they pick the kid up from daycare.
[03:55:43.880 --> 03:55:49.880]  And then they get in line at the Hillary event and they turn into zombie shape shifters and start
[03:55:49.880 --> 03:55:55.080]  and start grabbing microphones from Millie Weaver. And here's one of the things I love about Millie.
[03:55:55.080 --> 03:55:58.680]  I don't know Millie. I've never met Millie. I don't think, I mean, I've been to InfoWorst,
[03:55:58.680 --> 03:56:02.840]  you know, the, the, the Texas Command Center a couple of times. I don't think Millie was there
[03:56:02.840 --> 03:56:09.080]  back when I was there, but I don't know her. But I can, I've learned so much about her by watching
[03:56:09.080 --> 03:56:14.840]  her. Just like I said, don't tell show. I'm watching Millie Weaver and she's showing. She's
[03:56:14.840 --> 03:56:24.600]  showing big time. She's going through the zombies are attacking brains brains Millie brains Hillary
[03:56:24.600 --> 03:56:33.480]  good Millie bad InfoWorst bad. I can't wait till they use that clip and use it against me later.
[03:56:33.480 --> 03:56:39.640]  But the zombies are attacking and Millie Weaver is just being Millie. She is just
[03:56:39.640 --> 03:56:47.720]  just herself smiling, maintaining her composure, staying assured in her, in her self awareness
[03:56:47.720 --> 03:56:54.360]  that what she's doing is asking questions on public property. And man, oh man, do the zombies
[03:56:54.360 --> 03:56:59.960]  attack reread that poem that I shared with you this if by Rudyard Kimpling. I don't know if
[03:56:59.960 --> 03:57:03.960]  I'm pronouncing his name right. I maybe it's a woman that wrote it. I don't know if Rudyard is
[03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:11.240]  a man or a woman. It doesn't matter because Millie exemplifies just like our president does just like
[03:57:11.240 --> 03:57:17.160]  I see Alex just like I see Rob do just like I see Owen just like I see David Knight. These people
[03:57:17.160 --> 03:57:24.280]  are exemplifying what is embodied in this poem and you can too. It's called if it's worth reading.
[03:57:24.280 --> 03:57:29.160]  It's worth downloading. It's worth printing out. It's worth keeping and I want to share with you
[03:57:29.160 --> 03:57:34.680]  what I witnessed our president doing in his press conference. The press conference last week,
[03:57:34.680 --> 03:57:40.040]  I couldn't find on the internet until it already happened live from Chicago for Alex Jones. It's
