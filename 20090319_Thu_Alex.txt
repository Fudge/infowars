[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:33.480]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones. We are live ladies and gentlemen
[00:33.480 --> 00:42.760]  thank you so much for joining us today. This Thursday the 19th of March 2009 we're gonna be live
[00:42.760 --> 00:48.680]  here for the next four hours. We have a Dr. Chuck Baldwin constitutional party presidential candidate
[00:48.680 --> 00:56.040]  2008 who was basically listed as a terrorist leader by the state police propaganda document
[00:56.040 --> 01:00.600]  put out in Missouri written by the feds and that's what the document does don't let them spin it.
[01:02.120 --> 01:10.600]  Also we've got commander David K. Robin of the American Legion joining us outraged by the fact
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.440]  that they're going to make all veterans pay for their own health care. Now that's CNN ladies and
[01:16.440 --> 01:21.720]  gentlemen and they put a spin on it and say it's good so basically you'll have to get your own
[01:21.720 --> 01:26.920]  insurance when your arms and legs get blown off or you breathe nerve gas or you get shot.
[01:28.120 --> 01:33.480]  You know more than 15,000 troops have died in Iraq they just changed the rules seven years ago
[01:33.480 --> 01:41.320]  because they were building up for the war. We've now passed the what six year mark for being in
[01:41.320 --> 01:45.640]  Iraq but seven years ago they changed the accounting rule kind of like they've changed
[01:46.360 --> 01:51.000]  all the other federal statistics that were always somewhat fraudulent but now even more fraudulent
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.800]  to where if you're not looking for employment anymore and you just dropped out of society
[01:56.360 --> 02:00.280]  which tens of millions have done you just are counted as employed.
[02:00.280 --> 02:06.040]  Isn't that interesting how they cook the numbers there well it's the same thing here you can pull
[02:06.040 --> 02:10.840]  this up you can just google it the government admits it 15,000 plus troops five years in I
[02:10.840 --> 02:18.840]  haven't looked at it in a year have died of their injuries since they left Iraq and I mean they can
[02:18.840 --> 02:26.280]  die on a jet medical aircraft flying them to New York City or to DC or to Virginia or to
[02:26.280 --> 02:34.760]  Romstein in Germany and it doesn't count. So when I say 5,000 died in the Obama deception
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.800]  I'm just going with what they're officially spinning and saying not even counting the
[02:39.800 --> 02:48.200]  1,000 plus dead contractors as well so it's well above that. Continuing we have Stuart Rhodes
[02:48.200 --> 02:52.440]  from Oath Keepers coming on the show this is a group of police and military saying they're
[02:52.440 --> 02:57.800]  going to keep their oaths to not violate the Miller rights and Constitution under criminal
[02:57.800 --> 03:05.240]  orders from either the commander and chief or their direct commanders in the military
[03:05.240 --> 03:11.080]  and police departments police chiefs and others. So that is coming up.
[03:13.320 --> 03:20.280]  We also have author Jeff Grubb author of Corporatism the secret government of the
[03:20.280 --> 03:25.400]  New World Order very interesting professor joining us in the last hour of the show today
[03:25.400 --> 03:30.120]  we scheduled him from last week so that's basically what is coming up.

[09:20.840 --> 09:34.360]  it's so horrifying it's so unbelievable that the government is out of control and is criminal as it is
[09:36.360 --> 09:42.920]  but it's happening it's really going on this is why if you study criminology people that con artists

[10:41.880 --> 10:46.520]  language indicating young people will be forced to undertake mandatory national service programs

[10:52.120 --> 10:56.120]  why would we be wondering if he's going to do it when his chief of staff wrote a book about it

[11:24.680 --> 11:30.760]  world government yes it's all true it's all real can we stop the denial and do something about

[12:46.840 --> 12:54.360]  that's why it's called a duty in subsection b6 the legislation states that a commission was
[12:54.360 --> 13:03.960]  will be set up to investigate whether a workable fair and reasonable mandatory mandatory service
[13:03.960 --> 13:10.920]  requirement for all able young people could be developed that's a quote mandatory now
[13:11.800 --> 13:15.800]  you know in australia and everywhere else this is how they introduce it they go oh it's just a test
[13:15.800 --> 13:20.280]  of the national ID cards of the rail ID act and then they force it down your throats oh don't
[13:20.280 --> 13:24.440]  worry if you don't like it don't worry it's just a test or don't worry we're going to ban most websites
[13:24.440 --> 13:29.080]  in australia that you can visit and have chinese style net censorship that's the government's quote
[13:29.080 --> 13:32.600]  but it's just a test and then a two months later they're saying ah it's going to be permanent
[13:33.320 --> 13:36.760]  so don't worry we're just looking at mandatory service we're just seeing
[13:37.320 --> 13:40.040]  how we can do this in a workable fashion well they've already said how they're going to do it

[24:45.960 --> 24:52.520]  no no plans to do that at this time obama came out two weeks ago and said we're gonna make veterans
[24:52.520 --> 24:56.920]  of all wars including the current one get their own insurance and then pay for their own health
[24:56.920 --> 25:02.280]  care cnn reported at ap everybody and they put the spin on it oh it's good we need to do that oh
[25:02.280 --> 25:06.760]  he's so good because we told you this isn't a socialist and socialism is bad enough because
[25:06.760 --> 25:10.440]  it makes you dependent they're already done with the socialism phase domesticating us
[25:10.440 --> 25:15.400]  the only socialism has taken all our money and given it to the bankers and that's fascism
[25:15.960 --> 25:19.960]  you know they take 9.7 trillion and then a couple hundred billion comes back to the
[25:19.960 --> 25:26.040]  states with strings attached that's their socialism their socialism is saying no health care for the
[25:26.040 --> 25:32.920]  troops their socialism is saying it cities all over cutting health care for police and firemen
[25:32.920 --> 25:40.040]  and city workers that's your socialism you see tyranny is about robbing us that means every
[25:40.040 --> 25:47.880]  stinking one of us except for a few thousand elite comprende we comprehend that here it is
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.360]  obama changes course on veterans health care president obama has reversed course
[25:54.360 --> 25:58.040]  on a plan to have the private health insurance of veterans pay for health care
[25:58.040 --> 26:01.880]  why i'll suppose when robert gibbs issued a statement wednesday saying the proposal had
[26:01.880 --> 26:07.560]  been flooded this is whitehouse dot gov in his briefing room page quote maximize the resources
[26:07.560 --> 26:11.560]  available for veterans as well as keep costs down for veterans administration gibbs said that after
[26:11.560 --> 26:15.400]  consulting with several leaders the president now believes the move could affect the ability of
[26:15.400 --> 26:19.880]  veterans and their families to have access to health care really who would have funk it now
[26:21.320 --> 26:27.160]  they will go ahead and ram this through they're going to go ahead and they've all almost made
[26:27.160 --> 26:31.560]  it impossible for veterans getting anything other than pills any real surgeries you name it
[26:31.560 --> 26:36.840]  and they've got people that only have a real you know proper medical licenses from india in places
[26:36.840 --> 26:40.200]  i'm not saying they don't have some real medical schools over there very smart folks
[26:40.200 --> 26:44.920]  just as smarter smarter than westerners i'm on top scientist point is they have a lot of quack
[26:44.920 --> 26:48.840]  schools over there like mexico does and there's a bunch of quack doctors and come out in the
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.240]  news people don't even have real medical degrees you know cutting off the wrong leg or leaving
[26:53.240 --> 26:59.720]  tools inside people you know russian doctors you name it so that's going on and so they'll
[26:59.720 --> 27:02.760]  just make it very hard for you to get health care and then say you just need to have your own
[27:02.760 --> 27:09.960]  insurance okay that's how this works so as huge opposition mounts when they introduce it
[27:09.960 --> 27:14.360]  they then back off and then they'll be right back in a month with it again and then they'll
[27:14.360 --> 27:17.800]  deny they ever said it again and then they'll come right back with it again and then they'll
[27:17.800 --> 27:21.400]  deny and then they'll about the third or fourth time we'll go ahead and do it they'll just get
[27:21.400 --> 27:26.280]  you're sick of talking about it and get you acclimated every time the outrage grows to a
[27:26.280 --> 27:30.840]  crescendo that's about to spill out and actually hurt the establishment they back off and say we
[27:30.840 --> 27:35.720]  never said that or well we're not going to do that now and they come right back with it after
[27:35.720 --> 27:40.280]  see they don't want you to organize and so as people start organizing against this they go okay
[27:40.280 --> 27:45.400]  we're not doing it now organization falls apart they're right back kind of like the associated
[27:45.400 --> 27:51.240]  press a month and a half ago headline trans texas corridor part of nap a super highway grid is dead
[27:52.760 --> 27:56.600]  text dot says in the department transportation federally say and then three paragraphs down it
[27:56.600 --> 28:01.240]  said actually we're doing the entire program of seizing the roads and putting toll roads on them
[28:01.240 --> 28:07.800]  we're just not going to call it trans texas corridor anymore see how that works i mean
[28:07.800 --> 28:12.520]  this is why the public is fooled because they don't even understand there's a
[28:12.520 --> 28:18.440]  couple dozen tricks the establishment plays and i was flipping through radio this morning xm and

[34:54.680 --> 35:00.120]  a uh upstart uh party it's been around for years that's what the media called it i want to get his
[35:00.120 --> 35:04.840]  take on a lot of things including senator dot admits adding bonus provision to stimulus package
[35:04.840 --> 35:09.160]  while he was the guy bad mouthing it and blaming it on republicans and we're not defending republicans
[35:09.160 --> 35:13.320]  they were a party to it the point is they're all controlled by the same people and then meanwhile
[35:13.320 --> 35:18.280]  dot is now blaming obama administration for bonus amendment well yeah because the bonus amendment
[35:18.280 --> 35:24.200]  mirrors the executive order so when you see obama go we're gonna get these people i am his
[35:24.200 --> 35:29.640]  administration is literally run by the people that engineered the current banking system bush

[37:01.720 --> 37:07.480]  couple of days as you can imagine and this thing is now beginning to get a life of its own uh thank
[37:07.480 --> 37:12.840]  you alex for helping to break this story uh whoever that police officer was in missouri who first
[37:12.840 --> 37:19.880]  contacted you uh he's a real hero i don't know who he is but uh uh he sure did a great service to
[37:19.880 --> 37:24.680]  his country by alerting the public as to what is going on behind the scenes in the police department
[37:24.680 --> 37:32.040]  there in the state of missouri this thing is it is unbelievable i mean to categorize voters of ron paul
[37:32.040 --> 37:38.760]  supporters of ron paul chuck baldwin bob bar as potential uh domestic terrorists not to mention
[37:38.760 --> 37:46.040]  the fact that if anyone uh opposes certain things and i listed that in my column that i put out
[37:46.040 --> 37:52.680]  earlier this week uh if if someone opposes for example the new world order uh if they oppose
[37:52.680 --> 38:00.040]  the united nations gun control the violation of posse comet rfid rfid if they're part of in the
[38:00.040 --> 38:06.360]  fed or the liberty committee or the constitution party uh and they say oh these groups are bad too
[38:06.360 --> 38:10.920]  they have soup kitchens and try to work with the local police talking about your group and others
[38:10.920 --> 38:15.960]  and i mean it's clear and they say but secretly they've got cell groups and they're really terrorist
[38:15.960 --> 38:21.960]  too yeah anybody that opposes any of the above abortion on demand illegal immigration etc is a
[38:21.960 --> 38:26.760]  potential domestic terrorist a potential threat to the police forces there in the state of missouri
[38:26.760 --> 38:34.040]  i mean can you imagine what the what the firestorm would be if instead of bob bar ron paul and myself
[38:34.040 --> 38:40.200]  had the let's say jesse jackson and al sharpton been named uh with the insinuation that people who
[38:40.200 --> 38:44.840]  support these individuals may be considered domestic terrorists i can you imagine what the
[38:44.840 --> 38:49.720]  mainstream press would do is something like that and yet this is exactly what that that report says
[38:49.720 --> 38:56.440]  there in the state of missouri uh we have sent uh the three of us ron myself and bob have co-signed
[38:56.440 --> 39:03.000]  a letter uh to the governor and to the respective parties in missouri demanding that they
[39:03.000 --> 39:10.840]  repudiate uh this report and apologize to the supporters of those who voted for us
[39:10.840 --> 39:14.920]  not so let me stop you this is big news and of course we broke it here i have the original
[39:14.920 --> 39:21.320]  actual report here in my hot little hands right now uh specifically uh what did limbaugh say
[39:21.320 --> 39:27.480]  about it a and then b where is a copy of this letter i would like to publish it right now
[39:27.480 --> 39:33.960]  up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com okay uh the letter uh i have a copy of course in
[39:33.960 --> 39:39.560]  my position as does bob bar and you do me a favor and scan it or email it over and we'll uh post it
[39:39.560 --> 39:44.440]  and put a link over to your site sure sure we can do that and as to what limbaugh said i really
[39:44.440 --> 39:48.600]  don't know exactly what he said i didn't hear i very seldom listen to rush limbaugh but uh i've
[39:48.600 --> 39:52.840]  had several people call and tell me that he did bring it up on his programmers or maybe a caller
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.000]  did and they did talk about it for a few minutes the point is is that it's beginning to spread
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.520]  around the country and it was in newspapers yeah oh absolutely the newspapers and talk radio of
[40:02.520 --> 40:06.680]  course are the ones that are breaking the story right now uh you were the first one to break as
[40:06.680 --> 40:11.480]  far as i know and again i thank you for that but this this is incredible and the thing about it is
[40:11.480 --> 40:17.720]  the law enforcement agencies often share this kind of information uh with each other no sir all
[40:17.720 --> 40:23.560]  50 states have this i actually have it from other states uh just state police have asked me not to
[40:23.560 --> 40:27.400]  publish the copies they've got because they're scared and i've gotten many similar reports i've
[40:27.400 --> 40:32.440]  seen a texas report on the same style letterhead a few years ago it just wasn't this egregious
[40:32.440 --> 40:38.120]  listing ron paul yourself and others correct as far as i know this is the first report
[40:39.080 --> 40:44.120]  such as this that has actually named it names you know that they did this back in the 90s uh
[40:44.120 --> 40:50.280]  when janerino uh was there in the clinton white house and uh but they they did some of the same
[40:50.280 --> 40:55.000]  you know kind of insinuations and broad brushing and so forth but they didn't actually name names
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.640]  but here we are now in 2009 and they've actually named chuck ball and myself bob bar and ron paul
[41:01.640 --> 41:07.080]  and saying the supporters uh of of those of us who ran back last year as as an independent party
[41:07.080 --> 41:13.160]  ticket uh are somehow considered dangerous and a potential domestic terrorist yeah well i need
[41:13.160 --> 41:16.920]  to get ron paul back on i don't like to bug him because he's so busy but last wednesday when we
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.440]  broke this thursday i got calls from listeners saying we call ron paul's office of course it wasn't
[41:22.440 --> 41:27.960]  ron paul he hadn't heard about it yet and they're saying it can't be real and uh so i had to explain
[41:27.960 --> 41:31.640]  to them send him to the site and i said like i'm not going to call ron at home i've got his home
[41:31.640 --> 41:36.920]  number but i said give this to him we don't make stuff up you know that right and they said no no
[41:36.920 --> 41:42.200]  we all know you and like you alex and i said good it's real the state police officers names are
[41:42.200 --> 41:47.560]  there call the number for yourself confirm it's real because i got i got slapped around for three
[41:47.560 --> 41:51.320]  or four days and folks are still saying i made this up chuck it doesn't matter if the state police
[41:51.320 --> 41:56.120]  and in state reps say they talk to the head the state police you know they're still the establishment
[41:56.120 --> 42:02.920]  still trying to deny this well that that's incredible because all anyone has to do is
[42:02.920 --> 42:08.040]  call the toll free number and talk to the state officials they're missouri and they won't deny
[42:08.040 --> 42:13.880]  it one bit in fact they will defend they'll just say that it's been misconstrued and people are
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.840]  recording it out of context yeah no we didn't play recordings of mon air people say that's not real
[42:20.440 --> 42:24.040]  yeah go ahead they don't deny it but they don't deny it is my point i mean they they will readily
[42:24.040 --> 42:31.240]  admit that it's legitimate and for the most part they stand behind it as far as ron paul you're right
[42:31.240 --> 42:36.280]  at first uh you know i'm sure that the people in his office didn't didn't probably believe it as
[42:36.280 --> 42:40.040]  when i first heard the story with somebody you know told me so hey have you heard the story
[42:40.040 --> 42:44.360]  coming out of missouri and i said oh no they didn't they didn't do that i mean that's the first thing
[42:44.360 --> 42:48.360]  you think about but then whenever you start to look at it closely and you realize hey this it's
[42:48.360 --> 42:53.640]  real this does not make believe and then you can begin to do something about it and of course this
[42:53.640 --> 42:59.160]  letter that we have cosigned bob barry ron paul and myself and uh i'm sure by now is on the way
[42:59.720 --> 43:04.600]  to the uh the governor's office there in missouri uh in which we give him three days
[43:04.600 --> 43:11.000]  to uh to come out and repudiate this document to tell you have the letter in front of you
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.880]  uh the in four presidential candidate i do i do have i do have a letter and i'm gonna sit back
[43:15.880 --> 43:23.160]  here will you read that on air place well it's um two it's uh a little over two pages you want
[43:23.160 --> 43:27.400]  me to read it yeah let's read it it's important let's all right first time here exclusive go ahead
[43:27.400 --> 43:35.080]  all right uh dear governor nixon the three of us write you as former presidential candidates as
[43:35.080 --> 43:39.320]  concerned citizens and in the case of ron paul as a sitting member of the u.s. house of representatives
[43:39.320 --> 43:45.320]  and bob bar as a former member 1995 to 2003 we bring to your attention the most disturbing
[43:45.320 --> 43:50.440]  document being circulated by the missouri information analysis center mi ac over the seal of your
[43:50.440 --> 43:54.920]  office and your name is governor respectfully demand that the following described document be
[43:54.920 --> 43:58.840]  immediately removed from any and all websites associated with or maintained by the state of
[43:58.840 --> 44:04.680]  missouri or any agency thereof including the mi ac that the said document no longer be circulated
[44:04.680 --> 44:09.160]  by the state of missouri or any agency thereof or associated therewith that the state of missouri
[44:09.160 --> 44:14.040]  repudiate its references to the three of us as contained therein the document to which we refer
[44:14.040 --> 44:19.560]  is identified as follows and a copy enclosed herewith and of course uh it's the mi c strategic
[44:19.560 --> 44:25.720]  report dated 2209 and it's entitled the modern militia movement forenames appear on the master
[44:25.720 --> 44:35.080]  of this document jeremiah wj nixon governor john m brit director dps james f keithy kernel mshp
[44:35.720 --> 44:42.120]  and van godsey director mi ac the fore said report is imprinted at the bottom of each page thereof
[44:42.120 --> 44:48.840]  with the following designation unclassified law enforcement sensitive close quote it would be
[44:48.840 --> 44:53.320]  difficult governor to recount in any letter of reasonable length the nonsense and inaccurate
[44:53.320 --> 44:58.280]  information contained in this so-called strategic report which concerns purported analysis of the
[44:58.280 --> 45:03.800]  modern militia movement in quotes the report draws links between white supremacist anti immigration
[45:03.800 --> 45:08.840]  persons people opposed to gun control those who do not favor the federal reserve banks and much more
[45:08.840 --> 45:13.240]  where the report nothing more than a nonsensical diatribe pin by some uninformed person we would
[45:13.240 --> 45:17.320]  certainly not take our time writing this letter although we might respectfully suggest you might
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.520]  want to question why such nonsense is of interest to and being disseminated by an agency connected
[45:22.520 --> 45:26.840]  to stave missouri our concern which we believe wants your attention over is found at the top
[45:26.840 --> 45:32.200]  of page four of this document after the heading political paraphernalia as follows quote militia
[45:32.200 --> 45:36.440]  members most commonly associated with third party political groups is out in common for
[45:36.440 --> 45:41.960]  militia members to display constitutional and that's a missed spell because it's constitution not
[45:41.960 --> 45:47.560]  constitutional party campaign for liberty or libertarian material these members are usually
[45:47.560 --> 45:53.640]  supporters of former presidential candidate ron paul chuck Baldwin and bob bar close quote
[45:54.440 --> 45:59.160]  if it is the intent of the state of missouri to link these three excuse me to link three legitimate
[45:59.160 --> 46:02.200]  former candidates for the office of the president of the united states who also happened to be a
[46:02.200 --> 46:06.600]  sitting member of the u.s. house a former member of the u.s. house and a baptist minister then this
[46:06.600 --> 46:11.240]  document clearly does so and this is the basis for our demand that the document be removed
[46:11.240 --> 46:15.240]  it's distribution and the actual implied adoption by the state of missouri stop
[46:15.960 --> 46:19.720]  if it is not the intent of the state of missouri to make such a link or implication by and through
[46:19.720 --> 46:24.440]  the appearance and distribution of this document then we similarly demand the document be removed
[46:24.440 --> 46:28.040]  from any and all websites maintained by our associated with the state of missouri or any
[46:28.040 --> 46:33.080]  agency connected therewith that's a state issue an immediate and unequivocal repudiation of the
[46:33.080 --> 46:38.200]  document and view the fact that there are indeed real criminals present in missouri and many legitimate
[46:38.200 --> 46:42.440]  matters of public safety on which your office the department of public safety to highway patrol
[46:42.440 --> 46:47.720]  and even the miac should focus their attention and resources respectfully assert that spending
[46:47.720 --> 46:52.920]  any time resources or effort on the nonsense contained in or about this mic strategic report
[46:52.920 --> 46:57.560]  constitutes an irresponsible and inappropriate use of official resources we stand ready to
[46:57.560 --> 47:01.320]  discuss this matter with you your convenience however the action respectfully demanded in
[47:01.320 --> 47:05.240]  this letter is requested within three days so you receive this letter in the meantime with
[47:05.240 --> 47:09.400]  common guards we are virtually yours ron paul member of congress republican candidate for
[47:09.400 --> 47:16.200]  president 2008 bar member of congress 1995 2003 libertarian party nominee for president 2008
[47:16.200 --> 47:20.680]  chuck baldlin minister crossword baptist church constitution party nominee for president 2008
[47:22.120 --> 47:30.040]  okay i would just add to that that they start out with a page listing cop killers and then they
[47:30.040 --> 47:35.720]  demonize the militia connecting into that then they connect violent militias which basically
[47:35.720 --> 47:41.800]  don't exist in a constitutional you know the nonviolent ones to basically the majority american
[47:41.800 --> 47:50.680]  people pro second amendment pro sovereignty pro border uh just you name it they basically say
[47:50.680 --> 47:56.840]  people with these bumper stickers are dangerous they may put a hole in you you know that's the
[47:56.840 --> 48:05.480]  totality of it and it's a guilt by association broad brush demonization uh and and it's slander
[48:05.480 --> 48:10.200]  and libel of the highest order and that's why they hold out that's why they can't disagree if they
[48:10.200 --> 48:16.760]  and if my ox if they do not repudiate this forthwith uh i feel confident that there will be legal
[48:16.760 --> 48:22.120]  action uh ensue and i can tell you this too that the constitution party and hopefully the libertarian
[48:22.120 --> 48:28.120]  parties in the state of missouri are likewise sending off similar letters uh with just those
[48:28.120 --> 48:33.320]  exact uh implications in mind in other words represent we know we're rep the letter that
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.720]  we wrote was uh representing the three of us because we were named so that's how this
[48:37.720 --> 48:42.280]  letter tell us how this letter got wrote i mean you got bob bar ron paul and yourself on the phone
[48:42.280 --> 48:45.400]  you know the declaration of independence was supposedly written by a bunch of people but we
[48:45.400 --> 48:50.280]  know it was mainly written by thomas jefferson so i mean who was the thomas jefferson writing this
[48:50.280 --> 48:55.800]  letter of the three of you i think uh it was primarily bob bar okay so bob bar is the thomas
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.200]  jefferson here uh in this but you guys you and ron paul congressman paul and yourself uh dr
[49:00.200 --> 49:07.240]  baldwin agreed with this uh did they in the conversations on the phone talk about uh carrying
[49:07.240 --> 49:11.480]  out legal action themselves if this isn't repudiated because you know i'm glad you guys are doing this
[49:11.480 --> 49:16.920]  you have to this endangers the tens of millions of ron paul bob bar and chuck baldwin supporters
[49:16.920 --> 49:22.760]  and fans uh and and when we've got confirmed reports on video police pulling people over
[49:22.760 --> 49:29.320]  for ron paul bobber stickers in los vegas in places uh so this is dangerous oh absolutely i mean
[49:29.880 --> 49:35.640]  this you know talk about the essence of freedom this is the essence of freedom whenever uh state
[49:35.640 --> 49:41.960]  police agencies begin pulling people over for political opinions and that's exactly what
[49:41.960 --> 49:47.400]  what this is if you support bob bar chuck baldwin ron paul that's a political opinion yeah that's
[49:47.400 --> 49:51.800]  what the report is for those that don't know i'm keeping running because it's key this is given
[49:51.800 --> 49:58.520]  they say my act report is for them when they pull people over this this is too profile this is for
[49:58.520 --> 50:04.200]  harassment go ahead yeah and and so when we start profiling people because of political thought
[50:04.200 --> 50:09.880]  political ideology uh i mean this is what they did in nazi germany what they did in
[50:09.880 --> 50:15.960]  stylings russia mails china the the whole nine yards you know is is your your identification

[54:51.000 --> 54:55.560]  and we'll do a story on it very very exciting to see you guys standing up and finding back but i go
[54:55.560 --> 54:59.720]  back to the question we ran out of time talking to ron paul talking to bob bar are they saying that
[54:59.720 --> 55:06.760]  they may do legal action if this is not a reverse and and and retracted i think i think i could
[55:06.760 --> 55:14.040]  safely say that the sense of of each of us is that this is serious enough that the state of
[55:14.040 --> 55:20.200]  missouri does not respond appropriately uh... that we should consider legal action i i think that
[55:20.200 --> 55:26.520]  is certainly a consideration right now so that was discussed yes that is that is very important
[55:26.520 --> 55:30.520]  news right there good because instead of putting up with the southern property law center
[55:30.520 --> 55:35.720]  and the adl who go after you know groups that are obviously bad and are constantly mixing
[55:35.720 --> 55:41.720]  good people in with it i'm sick of this slander and they've lost lawsuits before uh over this
[55:41.720 --> 55:47.720]  and uh... now the police are putting this out secretly this is outrageous it is outrageous and
[55:47.720 --> 55:52.440]  it threatens the liberty of of every american i hope that your listeners understand that even
[55:52.440 --> 55:58.040]  though they may not have voted for myself or bob or ron paul or perhaps they don't live in missouri
[55:58.040 --> 56:02.120]  that they think what that this doesn't affect them but the fact of the matter is this affects
[56:02.120 --> 56:08.200]  every single american citizen uh... if when police agencies can begin to profile americans on the
[56:08.200 --> 56:15.400]  basis of what they believe we are in serious trouble we don't have freedom if we don't have
[56:15.400 --> 56:22.120]  the freedom to think the freedom to speak the freedom to express our ideas and our convictions
[56:22.120 --> 56:28.760]  publicly when we don't have that freedom without being considered an enemy of the state or domestic
[56:28.760 --> 56:34.360]  terrorist however you want to say it we don't have the most basic fundamental freedoms uh...
[56:34.360 --> 56:40.440]  in this country and that's what's at stake for every american now this is a chilling effect
[56:40.440 --> 56:45.480]  i mean this is a soviet union nazi germany this is classical tyranny to have the police
[56:45.480 --> 56:49.640]  turning into secret police with these reports demonizing the very people that are defending
[56:49.640 --> 56:55.320]  the republic and think about it you know that the people that that they mentioned there you
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.760]  know bob bar the libertarians uh... chuck wallin the constitution party of ron paul the
[57:00.760 --> 57:04.440]  you know if you want to say the constitutional wing of the republican party you know these are
[57:04.440 --> 57:10.440]  the people that for the most part are the most adamant defenders of of the constitution of
[57:10.440 --> 57:16.040]  freedom of the very principles that the law enforcement personnel around the country are
[57:16.040 --> 57:20.600]  sworn to protect let's remember that every law enforcement officer in the country takes an oath
[57:20.600 --> 57:26.040]  to the constitution as does every military officer of course every public official so you know and
[57:26.040 --> 57:31.880]  we are the ones who are promoting uh... the the law that each of these law enforcement personnel
[57:31.880 --> 57:38.520]  have sworn to protect i mean if there's any group of people that they should appreciate it should
[57:38.520 --> 57:43.320]  be the people that are trying to support and defend the constitution that the law enforcement
[57:43.320 --> 57:49.560]  personnel has sworn an oath to absolutely and and they might as well list lewdobbs in here because
[57:49.560 --> 57:55.400]  it the whole document looks like a lewdobb CNN tv show i mean the north american union the spp
[57:55.400 --> 58:01.160]  rfid tracker chips the second amendment i mean they just demonize everything that this country
[58:01.160 --> 58:07.160]  stands for this this absolutely yeah that's a good point this document is treason they should
[58:07.160 --> 58:11.320]  they should have mentioned lewdobbs because how often does he talk about the many of the things
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.960]  that you just listed there chuck ball when i'm gonna talk a little bit more about this for

[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:35.720]  brought last week has just gone huge another story that is massive comes to us from the head of the
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:41.480]  american legion the largest veterans association here in the united states and the website is
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:47.240]  legion.org they really need no introduction we have commander david k reyman on what this he
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:51.880]  met with the president on monday seeing in others reported that they were saying that they wanted
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:56.360]  to basically make the troops have their own insurance and pay for their own medical care
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:02.040]  instead of going to the v.a. so joining us is commander david k reyman head of the american
[1:09:02.040 --> 1:09:07.160]  legion sir thanks for taking time out i appreciate the opportunity this afternoon sir thank you
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:10.360]  you bet give us some background you're meeting with the president and now they look like they're
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:17.160]  backing off well this issue really came to light about three weeks ago hi and while some testimony
[1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:22.520]  was being given in in front of the house veterans affairs committee we didn't expect that it was
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:28.520]  that serious an issue at that point but we did think it was serious enough that a dozen veteran
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:33.960]  service organizations got together and jointly wrote a letter to the president opposing opposing
[1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:39.960]  this idea thinking that maybe it wouldn't go very much farther but then we were all invited
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:45.160]  to a meeting at the white house last monday afternoon and that's when we discovered that
[1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:51.880]  this truly was a serious proposal the administration and at that meeting was was the president himself
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:58.760]  his chief of staff rome manual v a secretary erik shinseki and a and a representative from the
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:05.000]  office of management and budget at that meeting they told us that they had identified five hundred
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:12.680]  forty million dollars that they thought could be recouped back into the v a by billing private
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:20.840]  insurance carriers for treatment of service connected disabilities at that point at and and i
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:25.960]  want i want everybody to understand that the president didn't president never threatened to
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:31.240]  cut off treatment and this was simply a method of how that treatment would be paid for whether
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:35.480]  by the government or by or by private insurance that would certainly start a big precedent
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:41.080]  towards that though it would it would it would start us down a road that we didn't want to go
[1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:48.600]  the the organizations all felt every one of us that the government has a fundamental right
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:54.600]  fundamental responsibility not just to provide that treatment but there shouldn't be any
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:59.400]  there shouldn't be any financial burden borne by the veteran or by the veterans family
[1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:04.280]  for that treatment oh yeah they're gonna raise insurance rates on them if the insurance companies
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:08.760]  learn that ensuring a veteran separately that they're gonna have to pay and come on
[1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:16.360]  and insurance premiums would go up there are annual and lifetime caps maximums on the benefits
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:20.920]  that are paid one of the things we're really concerned about is once that been once that
[1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:26.600]  maximum benefit cap is reached then the entire family loses their health insurance coverage
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:31.640]  for the rest of the year and with the with the state of the military right now many of our many
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:37.640]  of our military people are married many of them are parents and the last thing we need to do is
[1:11:37.640 --> 1:11:42.600]  to have more young children out there uninsured that's just that's just not acceptable and then
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:48.520]  there's the added load of this on the entire insurance system the type of catastrophic injuries
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:53.800]  associated with military service as you just said this would bankrupt the entire family's
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:12:00.040]  cap very quickly very quickly very quickly when you when you start to talk about the state of the
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:05.240]  art prosthesis and we expect state of the art prosthesis for those folks that have that have
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:12.360]  undergone amputations loss of limbs you know those costs are very high and then they and on top of
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:17.400]  those two there's also the effect on the employability of the veteran himself and and with
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:22.280]  the and the effect on the company if this disabled veteran is is running his own small
[1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:27.560]  business they're just they're just way too many dangers here to take a chance on on implementing
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:31.800]  implementing this proposal i didn't think of that we're talking to the commander of the
[1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:37.560]  american legion david k raymond i didn't think of that businesses guaranteed if they knew
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:41.960]  i'm going to take a veteran on with a job who's going to have huge insurance cost on our whole
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:47.240]  plan with small businesses especially uh that would prejudice people against hiring veterans
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:52.280]  it's certainly what it's certainly what we think we think that if the if a veteran walk into the
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:57.160]  business even if he was the most qualified that would be that that might be the deciding factor
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:03.160]  as to who gets the job just to do potential the potential effect on that on the employer's insurance
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:09.160]  costs now you were in the meeting with the uh sorry go ahead never go ahead right now you're
[1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:13.320]  in the meeting with the president he was trying to who was doing the selling the president or
[1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:18.360]  his chief of staff manuel or was it shinseki who was who was who was pushing this in the meeting
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:24.280]  all of the discussion at the meeting the primary the primary discussion came from the president
[1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:29.560]  the chief of staff and manuel carried part of the discussion the v a secretary uh general
[1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:34.920]  shinseki said very little during the meeting he was he was present but there there wasn't much
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:41.320]  discussion coming from the general from the secretary what was his body sorry go ahead
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:47.640]  the thing that did surprise us um and disappointed us frustrated frustrated those of us from the
[1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:53.880]  veterans organizations the president did not wish the discussion and he stopped the discussion
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:59.640]  a couple of times from addressing that fundamental responsibility of the government to to take care
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:05.400]  of not only to provide the treatment but to pay for it the discussion focused strictly on the money
[1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:10.280]  on the financial aspects and where the money was going to come from so i'm getting from what you're
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:16.760]  saying he didn't want to be on record uh seconding the fact that the military has always been promised
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:21.640]  continual health care and when you were saying you support that don't you mr president he was
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:28.760]  noncommittal that's yes uh a couple of the folks in the meeting tried to try to address that issue
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:34.840]  and that discussion came to it came to a halt very quickly at the president's request strictly
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:40.360]  strictly the focus on the money aspect that is outrageous so he was dehumanizing the issue away
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:46.200]  from the troops uh i mean that is outrageous so that clearly gives us a bird's eye view into the
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:53.160]  mind of of where they're trying to take policy um any other little interesting pieces of intelligence
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:15:00.840]  for the meeting sir no not from that one in particular um we did there was there was the
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:06.920]  suggestion made that if the organizations if the organizations did not agree with this if we were
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:13.240]  strongly opposed that if the organizations would make some other suggestions as to where this money
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:19.000]  could be could be either saved or additional sources of income that the administration was
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:25.080]  willing to listen to those that left us a little uneasy left me a little uneasy because i don't
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:30.280]  see it as the responsibility of the veterans organizations to partner with the government
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:35.400]  in in making those kinds of plans i think you're lobbying i mean i'm an organization
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:40.120]  a fraternal organization guardians of the veterans it's in so you and what you're saying i don't
[1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:44.440]  want to put words your mouth is that there was an attempted co-opting going on here a little bit of
[1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:50.920]  stroking to get you to quote help them uh i mean well obama cut you know four or five smart bombs
[1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:56.760]  out of the budget that's your 500 million i think that's i think i think there's some i think that's
[1:15:56.760 --> 1:16:02.120]  an accurate assessment of what was going on uh the what they were asking for was strictly ideas
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:07.160]  based on veterans health care and the v a and there's a couple of them out there uh the american
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:13.320]  legion has advocated for a long time that we don't see why a medicare eligible veteran that's going
[1:16:13.320 --> 1:16:19.640]  to the to the v a medical centers for non-service connected treatment why medicare should not be
[1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:23.880]  able to be billed and and to bring some money back into the v a that way we think there'd be
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:30.440]  new money come into the v a that's currently being spent out on on private doctors if that if that
[1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:36.120]  possibility was allowed for currently medic be the v a cannot bill medicare that's that's a
[1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:40.120]  law it's going to have to require a change in the law yeah and that's government money to begin
[1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:46.120]  with so i don't see the problem with that that we we don't either we've advocated that position for
[1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:51.160]  oh i would say probably somewhere between five and ten years now that's not a that's not a brand
[1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:56.600]  new idea that's more money a long time that's more options for better care for the troops
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:02.520]  yes yes uh any other key points that were going on in this meeting and then we'll go into chapter
[1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:07.080]  two here in the time we have left with the head of the video who's nice enough to join us here
[1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:10.600]  anything else in the meeting that people should be made aware of and was there anything good that
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:16.520]  you agreed with the that the president or chief of staff said only that the president was very
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:21.880]  clear that there would be treatment for these people but there was that there was never any doubt
[1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:27.880]  that treatment for service connected disabilities would happen in the in the v a medical care
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:32.280]  system and it would and it would be very good treatment the president the president vice president
[1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:39.080]  biden and and mrs obama have all been very clear about how much they care about military and the
[1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:44.680]  military and the military family so he wanted us to understand this that there was never any question
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:49.960]  that about whether or not treatment would happen in the v a it would but it would take it away
[1:17:49.960 --> 1:17:56.520]  from their families with the cap that's possible that that possibility exists yes there was there
[1:17:56.520 --> 1:18:03.240]  was some discussion of a test program a pilot program and maybe and maybe two states to see
[1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:09.720]  what the effect would be on premiums and lifetime caps and employability but frankly those of us
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:15.240]  in the organization myself as commander of the american legion i'm not willing to take that risk
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.480]  well we know what they do that have those veterans have that have service connected
[1:18:19.480 --> 1:18:25.480]  disabilities they and their families have sought have sacrificed enough we don't need to run a test
[1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:31.320]  program and run the risk that they would be sacrificing even more to find out things that
[1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:35.560]  that we're pretty sure we're would be going to happen well we know that's a government trick
[1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:40.600]  all over the world to just say it's a test to kind of kill opposition and then they roll it out saying
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:46.920]  oh our tests work great now we're going to do it yes yeah and you and you've seen things you've
[1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:52.760]  seen things studied and studied and studied and again you know the study never seems to get over
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:56.280]  what was his body language or what did he you know he was saying hey i don't want to talk about this
[1:18:56.280 --> 1:19:02.200]  being you know uh a uh you know right or something and i'm not wanting to commit to that but then
[1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:06.440]  saying i won't take their health care away sounds like double speak what was his body i mean how was
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:11.480]  he trying to co-opter you know get you guys what it sounds like to sell out the veterans in a way
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:17.160]  to will help me cut their benefits somehow or help me save this money somehow yeah that was
[1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:25.640]  was i'm not good at reading body language i i i don't dare give an interpretation there because
[1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:31.560]  there's sure the chance that i might be mistaken but he was very he was very clear this was about
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:37.880]  the money and and and you and you as organizations come up with ways to help supply this money
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:42.280]  all right sir we've got a break for a quick break come back with five more minutes with you to talk

[1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:05.080]  anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal reserve note and understand the
[1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:10.440]  risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:14.600]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts
[1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:19.160]  a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for
[1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:23.800]  immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to
[1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:28.920]  ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway
[1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:33.640]  by the fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however an
[1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:38.600]  increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to
[1:21:38.600 --> 1:21:43.480]  achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be
[1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:48.600]  calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven by

[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:24.680]  commander david k reyman the american legion is on with us
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:32.040]  i just can't believe they're trying to nickle and dime veterans treatment when we have a
[1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:37.800]  trillion plus dollar defense budget uh... and they're not worried about trillions to the private
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:42.920]  banks but it's it's it's just amazing your thoughts on that and then the good news that they are
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:49.800]  backing off this plan sir yes sir there was an invitation back into the white house uh yesterday
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:54.360]  the president could not be there he had prior commitments but chief of staff ron emmanuel
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:59.800]  led that meeting to bring the veterans organizations back in with we'd all expressed our opposition
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:04.280]  the american legion put out a very strong press release and we've been talking about it for the
[1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:09.400]  two days expressing our opposition and and involving the citizens and and our membership
[1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:15.800]  around the country at that meeting which only lasted about 15 minutes uh... the chief of staff
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:22.760]  received the opinions of the veterans organizations the opposition and made the made the promise
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:27.640]  that he would consult with the president and be back with an answer yet yesterday afternoon
[1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:33.240]  when that answer came back to us it was that the president was withdrawing that proposal
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:40.360]  we also heard that all coming from second speaker speaker the house below sea and house veterans
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:46.120]  house appropriations chairman chet edwards they both made the statement that this proposal had
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:51.960]  been withdrawn and would not be involved in the budget for this coming fiscal year which was very
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:57.480]  good news but the issue is that there's that they're proposing it it shows the mindset as you said
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:02.200]  what was the i mean i know the outrage was here that we saw on the internet and the phone calls
[1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:08.520]  we got to the radio show uh... i mean to this issue on a scale of one to ten uh... how hot
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:11.960]  uh... how hot did veterans get and veteran supporters over this
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.560]  oh i think uh... the people we were hearing from i would put i would put it up around the eight
[1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:21.480]  one of nine this you know this this really
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:28.840]  when you tell people that have worn the uniform in the united states about this idea
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:33.640]  you get about three two-thirds of the way through the description of what's being discussed here
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:39.000]  and the head starts to shake no right just that quickly because because they understand this fundamental
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:45.880]  responsibility they understand understand the reason that those folks were injured uh... why
[1:26:45.880 --> 1:26:52.200]  they're coming home with that disability and they understand that fundamental responsibility is not
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:57.720]  to be not to be trifled with plus they were promised they were promised they signed contracts saying
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:07.960]  this yes yeah exactly exactly so that's a that's it gets very high on the radar screen when you
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:11.880]  start to talk about it with the with the members of our organization with the veterans around the
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:16.040]  country and and frankly with a large with a large percentage of the population around this country
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:22.040]  even those that even those that have haven't been closely involved with the military does this uh...
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:28.200]  uh... did this put a check do you think in the uh... obama administration's image with veterans who
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:34.520]  are already in a lot of areas not not too pleased with him well it certainly didn't help uh... we
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:40.120]  in the american legion have been very pleased the last couple of years about budgets we're very
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:45.880]  we're very happy with the with the budget request that the president has put in all we've seen is
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:50.200]  the bottom line number there we don't know the details so what we're looking for the details
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:54.920]  we're anxious to see them but we've been very pleased with the bottom line number but yes this
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:28:01.240]  could go all this could go a long way to this could go a long way to her effort what's what
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:06.440]  tends to be a favorable first impression in my mind now that was one of the things that was
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:12.040]  that was said by one of the other representatives in that meeting to the president that this was
[1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:17.720]  not really this this wasn't something he needed this early in his administration because at this
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:25.000]  point things were going reasonably well all right well commander david k reagan of the american
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:29.720]  legion and probably the biggest veterans organization on the u.s but on the planet
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:39.000]  and the website is legion dot o r g legion dot o r g uh... and we appreciate you not being a lap dog
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  so many other uh... groups that represent people have been kind of seduced in to all these hundreds
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:49.640]  of meetings they've been having uh... trying to co-opt everybody and so we're really glad to hear
[1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:53.800]  that uh... you uh... that you and you're saying the other veterans groups that were with you
[1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:59.720]  that none of them were rolling over uh... to this uh... first seduction uh... well i would call it a
[1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:04.920]  corruption uh... into uh... the white house machinery so we commend you commander david k
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:10.520]  reagan for that thank you very much and it was very good to see so many of our of our colleagues
[1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:17.480]  in the in the organizations feeling the same way uh... that wasn't it wasn't an absolute necessity we
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:21.800]  we in the american legion will will form our opinion and will act on it based on it based on
[1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:26.600]  what we think is right all right commander thank you so much for spending time with us and keep up

[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:22.600]  people working for me at the time in 2001 and i would just do the live tv shows and then we've
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:30.440]  got warehouses well not warehouses three portable buildings filled with videotapes rotting of all
[1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:35.880]  these tv shows and all these reports i did locally and this is this video went viral all of the
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:41.960]  internet i was i put it up for free on my server got a four thousand dollar bill for it and had to
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:47.480]  pull it actually crashed our servers then i got a four thousand dollar bill and i learned that i
[1:34:47.480 --> 1:35:01.160]  couldn't put videos out for free um this was back in uh 2001 and it's up on info wars dot com

[1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:27.400]  simulcasting from the show here on out back in 2000 2001 i had two employees and so tapes got
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:31.400]  stacked up they didn't get labeled right they went everywhere hundreds of important tv shows i did
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:38.120]  and it's just gold the information that's in these and we're trying to go through these now to get
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:43.000]  them on the web to you know get them out of prison planet dot tv but mike hanson who did
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:46.200]  camera work for me around the local tv show at the time i've asked him to dig through his stuff
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:51.160]  he's done that uh and because i've been unable to find this particular tape he was able to find it
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:59.960]  uh in uh his store of tv programs i did payoff for anti-gun testimony caught on tape by alex jones
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:09.400]  is the headline up at info wars dot com and the reason the story is important we're going to play
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:17.400]  the video here is that uh choose the preservation of firearms ownership's local director we were
[1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:22.360]  there testifying against shutting down the gun shows ending private sales shutting down
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:27.240]  four eight shooting clubs uh ymca shooting clubs for for for young people and children
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:34.120]  that was the bills and this is when i really woke up to the n r a seven years ago now
[1:36:36.600 --> 1:36:42.200]  i guess eight years ago coming up this was in early 2001
[1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:49.480]  because the n r a was calling us extremists for not wanting to shut down the gun shows and
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:54.440]  things this was in the dallas morning news attacking me and others and then when we caught the bribery
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:36:59.160]  they said get out here the you know they're what looks like bribery being paid off in the house
[1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:02.920]  ethics committee said that he should have been a registered lobbyist that it that it was improper
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:07.640]  but then the investigation stopped there and in a hosa the committee chairman did get reprimanded
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:13.880]  but they get up and they say yeah basically there's dangerous gang members everywhere uh and
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:19.720]  we've you know you need to restrict guns you to restrict gun shows and then they go outside and
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:25.480]  this gun control group sits there and pays them off at least 300 a piece the uh three guys that
[1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:31.320]  testified and then the statesman called me the next day after we put the video out on local tv
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:36.120]  i was live that night and said why don't you like black people and i said what are you talking about
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:40.840]  up well if those were white men being paid and testifying against the second amendment would
[1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:45.480]  you have done your story and i said i wouldn't care if they were green i mean what this is a
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:51.640]  non-issue so the the statesman headline was payments made to backers of gun bills and it
[1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:57.960]  was the cover of the metro and state local section of the aust american statesman and i said i i said
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:02.600]  are you kidding and that was in the article i said are you kidding sir are you joking with me
[1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:06.600]  me and i said you know don't don't don't don't say that your article that's not what this is
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:10.520]  about but no they did it was all this alex jones races because he showed black guys being paid
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:17.080]  um so it's an important article in that respect and and this literally there's hundreds of reports
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:21.560]  just this is important and i'm trying to make enough money to hire a person full-time just to
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:26.840]  go through all my old videos because this is stuff that needs to be seen needs to flood youtube
[1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:31.480]  and everywhere else and we'll use prison planet on tv to do that but i want to thank mike for
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:35.560]  digging through the stuff i'd ask him to do that more he's got his mike hanson archive page
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:40.440]  up on youtube and this video has been out for a few weeks it was just emailed to me this morning

[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:27.160]  shows they get guns at large quantities you know i mean i know all these people i live there where
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:34.760]  all this is going on and i mean you guys might think that there's already a they already have a
[1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:40.680]  they have everything under control but it's not i mean regardless if we pass this law or not um
[1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:46.600]  um i mean things might change but this this right here this bill out through these bills
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:52.200]  this is just the beginning because there's bigger this bigger threats out there and there's bigger
[1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:57.960]  laws that we need to focus on that are being enforced in america but these three these three
[1:43:57.960 --> 1:44:03.800]  these three house bills right here this is just the beginning and i'm off board
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:10.840]  and like i said you guys are thinking most of you guys are looking out from the outside
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:15.960]  because i'm there i'm there every day i've been gone into researching i don't even want to know
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:20.280]  where where these companies are located i don't know that but well then what makes you think that
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:24.600]  they're selling because i give you guys that's that's only who else is going to give they don't
[1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:29.560]  have a factory in the hood where we're making guns you don't think some of those guns might be
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:35.720]  the don't they're not man how how can where are you going to get 200 stolen guns from
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:42.760]  uh from 200 houses per year 10 houses i see nobody nobody said all right nobody thank you
[1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:48.840]  so i'm sorry just just want to clarify i think what i'm hearing you saying that at least one
[1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:52.760]  source of these guns on the street is the gun show yes thank you
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:59.560]  first question i'd like to ask is do we have an epidemic of gun violence because the performance
[1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:05.080]  of the legislation it delays the very well-intended and sincere testimonies of millions of unmarked
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:10.920]  members and others would lead to believe we have an epidemic of gun violence that is not the case
[1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:15.480]  texas in the united states are safer than they have ever been i won't go into details if you
[1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:20.600]  put some of the clipping files here that has information from the national senator of health
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:28.200]  statistics we sent it from the U.S. gun deaths at a lowest the sense of mid 60s will say that we
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:32.920]  do not have an epidemic of gun violence and we might be in a situation where we're having solutions
[1:45:32.920 --> 1:45:40.760]  seeking a problem payments made to backers of gun bills questions arise over cash given to three
[1:45:40.760 --> 1:45:45.960]  witnesses who support gun show background checks proponents of gun owners rights asked lawmakers
[1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:51.800]  friday to investigate cash payments made to three houston men who appeared before a house committee
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:57.000]  this week to support bills that would require instant background checks at gun shows dave smith
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  president of houston based texas for gun safety a known front that is funded by hand control incorporated
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:08.120]  said he gave the three members of young texas against gun violence nina buttz's group is texas
[1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:13.960]  against gun violence about 300 each to cover their expenses and lost wages for the trip
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:20.120]  all three men however said they are currently unemployed so they can't get their lives straight
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:26.600]  that's lie number four right there um it was reimbursement for their jobs but they're unemployed
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:31.240]  otarius kelly 20 one of the witnesses said is ridiculous that someone would raise concerns
[1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:37.240]  about their testimony it's against my morals kelly said an admitted gang member by the way
[1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:43.080]  in the sand in the houston chronicles another story about this in there another witness agreed
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:48.440]  the money that was given to us was not to change our testimony said bruce brown 18 who did not
[1:46:48.440 --> 1:46:52.680]  speak to the committee but submitted a witness form that showed he supported the bills smith
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:57.480]  who gave them in the cash just outside the committee hearing room said young texas against
[1:46:57.480 --> 1:47:02.280]  gun violence is an arm of his group the subsidiary group receives donations from the catholic
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:08.200]  campaign for human development and the alliance for justice those groups encourage young people
[1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:13.800]  to get experience in the political process smith said oh yeah right reimbursing witnesses
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:18.920]  for travel expenses is not unusual said susie woodford of common cause texas a group that
[1:47:18.920 --> 1:47:23.560]  monitors government ethics but she said other witnesses using cash and paying for witnesses
[1:47:23.560 --> 1:47:29.640]  time raises ethical questions it's totally undermines the witnesses credibility woodford said
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:38.040]  i got here i said how will this look it says complaints about the payments began circulating
[1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:43.800]  after austin bay's talk show host alex jones who was at the house criminal jurist prudence committee
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:50.600]  meeting tuesday aired videotape interviews with smith and the young men they told jones the money
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:56.760]  was reimbursement stipends and campaign contributions so three different stories it's like the famous
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:48:02.200]  scene in a movie where are you guys going where what are you doing going to see my mother going
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:08.280]  to get something to eat uh going to the moon it's just making it up head of gun owners alliance has
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:14.040]  asked his thousands of members to seek a house investigation of the payments and have the hearing
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:18.120]  disregarded smith said complaints are being raised because the young men are minorities
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:22.520]  jones a strong supporter of gun owners rights since smith was trying to cover up his dirty
[1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:27.160]  activities by making accusations of racism he's sitting here caught on tape throwing out different
[1:48:27.160 --> 1:48:31.560]  stories and giving out money said jones who mentioned the payments during his testimony against
[1:48:31.560 --> 1:48:36.600]  the proposal to require background checks at gun shows how dare he try to divert attention
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:41.720]  by saying i'm a racist committee members rick green are dripping springs and one henna hosad
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:45.800]  mcgallon said they were uneasy about taking jones seriously because of other inflammatory
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:50.120]  comments he has made henna hosad the chairman of the committee said that although he didn't know
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:54.440]  details about the payments he is not concerned that the witnesses are compensated for testifying
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:58.760]  henna's hosad said lobbyists are compensated for their work to influence policy on behalf of other
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:03.000]  interests maybe these kids were paid for their travel but i don't see anything improper about
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:07.800]  it henna hosad said it is part of the process it is part of open government state law requires
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:12.120]  people who are paid more than one thousand and three months or who spend more than fifty five
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:17.000]  hundred a quarter trying to influence legislation or agency action to register as lobbyist so you
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:22.280]  broke the state election laws bud you're not a lobbyist we checked smith said not reimbursing
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:26.840]  witnesses for lost wages would mean average texas would be left out of legislative debates
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:33.560]  and he said cash made sense all right we're back live at prison planet dot tv simulcasting on the

[1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:19.080]  separate state police officers in two different states my strategic report the modern militia
[1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:22.600]  this is federally written to the fusion centers distributed all over the country this is the
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:26.760]  missouri version with the governor's seal on it that state reps on the talk to the head of the
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:33.160]  state police there the commander it's true they admit it they back it they support it we've interviewed
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:41.560]  and called and played clips of with the state police the captain in charge at my act this is
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:46.120]  real and now limbeck's covered it rush limbaugh's covered it we've confirmed those clips i've
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:51.080]  watched him during breaks it is a huge story and it should be but these and other variants like
[1:54:51.080 --> 1:54:55.240]  them go out everywhere we're joined by david the current state police officer we're going to leave
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:55:01.480]  it at that not even tell you what state he's in and have him tell the story of you know what it's
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:05.400]  like to have these in the department other reports they've had what other officers are saying and
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:09.800]  what it's like to see this have blown up so big we appreciate his courage because they do have
[1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:14.920]  retribution against officers and they talk about that in here if it gets out sir we appreciate you
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:18.920]  upholding your oath to protect and defend the bill of rights and constitution that so many have
[1:55:18.920 --> 1:55:26.040]  fought and died for thank you so much officer you're quite welcome alex okay uh tell us when
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:32.680]  you first got this and what it was like reading it and what other officers are saying but they
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:42.200]  emailed it to all the aerial officers and officers and it's like a training thing you know and when
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:48.360]  i pulled it up on the screen at first i was in disbelief after i read it and i had to read
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:55.400]  a couple of times to understand what are they saying i thought it was a spoof but when i read it
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:56:02.200]  when i ran it passed a few other officers you know and they had the same twist that i had on it that
[1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:07.960]  they were actually saying that some of us were militia members that we belong to a militia group
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:16.120]  just because as myself i have a long ball stick on my car some other officers they believe that gun
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:22.360]  control is not correct and that we shouldn't be marking up bullets ammunition act that they're
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:29.160]  trying to pass through and the same women that this is like a big med take man everybody
[1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:35.080]  you know it just doesn't it didn't appear right and it seemed like this thing was just
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:39.640]  anti-american all the way it really it really made me mad
[1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:46.600]  so the majority of other officers that you talked to in in your state police office they were upset
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:55.160]  by just like you yes they were and i'm telling you i'm talking about officers that are cooling
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:57:01.160]  drinking officers i mean officers that back bush all the way even they were very upset by this
[1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:09.000]  documentation and not this can't be true you know then a few of them looked at the author of the
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:15.560]  article and they say well it's part of a course that this is probably what comes out of this agency
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:21.640]  yeah we decided to go with your cell phone because it doesn't have a good connection and kind of
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:27.080]  distort your voice but it's doing its job too well right now so just i guess maybe speak a
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:31.480]  little bit louder for us uh officer i don't want to give out any details about where you are how
[1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:36.360]  senior you are but we just appreciate again your courage coming on how long ago did you first get
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:42.600]  emailed this you know came out in the 20th of february was it around that time it i got i got it
[1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:49.400]  about a week after the 20th that's when i opened it and it took me that long to digest what was
[1:57:49.400 --> 1:57:57.720]  actually on this document and really interpret what they were trying to tell us well it's a
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:58:03.800]  guilt by association document i mean do you agree they mix white supremacist and cop killers in with
[1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:08.680]  basically every libertarian or conservative or anti-corruption group under the sun and three
[1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:18.600]  popular presidential candidates in a sitting congressman yes i do agree exactly amazing guilt
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:23.960]  by association and then they show american flags and they don't tread on me and that's used by most
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:28.120]  the military is bad if you got that on your car look out for folks with these bumper stickers
[1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:33.000]  um we're gonna come back in one minute sir 70 second break and get into is this profiling uh

[2:00:12.520 --> 2:00:21.720]  he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:28.440]  we are back live now already into hour number three in about 15 minutes we've got uh
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:31.880]  oathkeepers a group for police military and others are saying we're going to uphold the
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:36.440]  constitution bill of rights very well written very well done side because it's a constitutional
[2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:40.440]  lawyer that started it but a lot of police and military have joined and pledged their oath
[2:00:40.440 --> 2:00:43.960]  to protect and defend the constitution bill of rights we've got a gentleman on the line right
[2:00:43.960 --> 2:00:49.080]  now state police officer we'll just call him david that's not his name uh his name has been changed
[2:00:49.080 --> 2:00:53.080]  to protect the innocent those defending the bill of rights the constitution um we're talking about
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:57.480]  the myack strategic report here's the report he sent me got it up on screen right here for you as
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:04.120]  well the story is now huge uh profiling i mean they admit this is sent out to state police it was
[2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:11.240]  sent to your state police um this is going on all over the country that's confirmed we're not going
[2:01:11.240 --> 2:01:18.360]  to get into that though because that can get into where you're at and i mean what is this meant to
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:22.760]  give patrol officers this because they talk about when they pull you over you know if you see these
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:27.480]  bumper stickers if you see this if you see that they start the whole page out with cop killing
[2:01:27.480 --> 2:01:31.240]  i guess to prejudice the police but it doesn't look like it's working too well so is this
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:37.160]  is this profiling and demonizing anybody that disagrees with the government it's actually
[2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:43.560]  uh i believe it is i believe that it is the intent but i don't think it's gonna work i think
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:52.760]  i think the officers in my agency can see through this ruse and they understand that this document
[2:01:52.760 --> 2:01:58.120]  is meant to enslave the american people and i don't think it's gonna work right i think
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:06.760]  them it misses more it's so obvious it's so obvious to lean one way to be a net that encompasses
[2:02:06.760 --> 2:02:12.760]  everybody like i like i said even the even though i don't have that right wing left wing false
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:19.320]  paradigm but even the right wingers in my particular area office see through it clearly
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:24.920]  and they understand what it is so as a profile document as a document meant to teach police
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:33.080]  officers to profile i think they lost well they're certainly losing now congressman ron paul
[2:02:33.080 --> 2:02:40.040]  former congressman bob bar and uh presidential candidates uh are are saying they're gonna sue
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:47.400]  if they don't retract this right and you know you know what i think what they're trying to do
[2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:53.640]  they're trying to train the young officers i mean the really young impressionable officers
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:58.120]  but they don't understand these young officers that are coming into these departments a lot of
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:04.600]  them are really smart and sharp they're coming in with four-year degrees i know a couple of attorneys
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:10.440]  that have just started the department and they can see through this alex i think these people are
[2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:16.440]  running scared now i think you and your office is office and people like you have done such a great
[2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:22.520]  job in forming an american public that people are seeing through these people the american citizens
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:27.240]  are seeing through these people what type of things where the state police officers in your
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:38.520]  office saying when they read this they were in this display they said hey i like guns just like
[2:03:38.520 --> 2:03:46.680]  any other american like guns and i'm not letting nobody take my gun and the ammunition and you know
[2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:53.880]  like the 223 around and the 308 that obama wants to get rid of they say no it's not going to happen
[2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:58.280]  and say when they come to get well i mean the statements are getting really bad they said
[2:03:58.280 --> 2:04:03.400]  they're going to have a hard time getting my weapon from me and i say the same you're not
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:08.840]  getting my weapon unless you pride out of my cold dead hand i'm not giving it up
[2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:15.960]  i mean would you say 90 percent of the police uh the the other state police officers you work
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:19.880]  with or like this or 50 percent and and and you're saying if the statements are getting like
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:23.560]  sounds like you're saying bordering on we're going to resist this
[2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:36.520]  i would say 80 to 90 percent of the officers that i spoke to and that's better like 80 officers
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:44.440]  90 officers are saying no this is not going to work stay there let's recap that when we come back
[2:04:44.440 --> 2:04:48.360]  and get anything else you want to cover and your take on this story getting so big it should get

[2:08:12.920 --> 2:08:17.160]  foreign offshore banks are engaged in a corporate takeover the united states just like they've
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:20.760]  done to hundreds of third world countries that's all that's happening they're announcing i've got
[2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:26.600]  roiders world taxes on everything you do two private banks it's all over the news there's
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:32.120]  a new world order so what happens when the state police and police open up these federally written
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:38.040]  reports saying none of this exists you're a violent cop killer if you talk about it if people
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:41.880]  have these bumper stickers look out and we have out of las vegas the footage of them pulling somebody
[2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:46.040]  over what's that ron paul sticker on your car i guess that's the 10 percent the officer's talking
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:50.520]  about that i guess by this we've got abby newman being pulled over to checkpoint she's got a pocket
[2:08:50.520 --> 2:08:55.000]  constitution and they grab it and say is this legal and on the squad car video they have a
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:00.200]  discussion about if she's allowed to have it when all it is is what this country's founded on what
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:05.880]  they swear in oath to officer specifically you know the new world order is becoming big news now
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:10.600]  i would imagine the officers you say are getting upset i mean are they going wait a minute this
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:15.240]  they're admitting there's a new world order why are they then saying you're a cop killer basically
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:22.600]  if you talk about a new world order i don't know exactly why i think that they're reaching i think
[2:09:22.600 --> 2:09:29.320]  they have during desperation right now they understand that they're being exposed it's like
[2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:34.520]  the obama deception i watched it the other day and i can't even make enough copies i have officers
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:41.640]  coming up to me and saying hey john david i understand that you have this this uh film about
[2:09:41.640 --> 2:09:48.280]  obama and you know and i can't even keep copies i gotta make copies constantly of the obama
[2:09:48.280 --> 2:09:54.840]  deception and by the way i wish i you guys sent out the my bbd so i can make better copies we
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:09:58.120]  have they're shipping right now but imagine we had thousands of orders we got four people back
[2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:04.120]  there you know since monday just packaging packaging so it's it's on the way and one and
[2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:08.760]  another thing out you know um since i've been listening to you i've been listening to you
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:15.160]  probably since the end of 2005 and luckily i have because you have saved me and literally
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:21.480]  hundreds of thousands you got me at the stock market because for your guests you have i sold
[2:10:21.480 --> 2:10:29.000]  my own before the market crashed and all of these things the other officers realized and i tell them
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:35.400]  you know alex jones has saved me money and so that pushes them to you and now the obama deception
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:42.440]  and now this this my document is further pushing people towards your show because your your radio
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:49.160]  show because they know that you're giving out truth why do you think people were in denial
[2:10:49.160 --> 2:10:52.840]  even state reps and people that know i tell the truth when they when they first saw it they
[2:10:52.840 --> 2:10:56.440]  couldn't believe it then they called the state police and they said yeah that's our document we're
[2:10:56.440 --> 2:11:05.640]  proud of it well but it was so over the top you know it's like there's a quickening developing
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:12.760]  right now you you probably can feel it i can feel it they know it's tipping over right now
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:18.840]  and we're getting the right amount of people waking up where it's going to have a deluge
[2:11:18.840 --> 2:11:26.680]  effect on on this country america's are wake up and improve well what happens you know with
[2:11:26.680 --> 2:11:31.160]  tipping points in history is they can tip into evil or tip into good and because we've done the
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:35.080]  groundwork and warn people and because we were right about what was going to happen and what
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:40.040]  was going to develop and people have seen that in hindsight with my 22 films and the work we've
[2:11:40.040 --> 2:11:43.880]  done a bit countless others out there fighting that we have a fighting chance in this but people
[2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:49.080]  need to know the enemy will stage terror attacks the enemy will release bioplagues i mean these
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:55.640]  people are hardcore killers they funded hitler stalin mal lennon pole pot is a big new brzezinski
[2:11:55.640 --> 2:12:01.640]  obama chief advisor brags in two books he wrote about how they i mean these people are sick and
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:06.200]  and so just because people are waking up i don't people think we're out of this this is deep
[2:12:06.200 --> 2:12:11.080]  this is serious and the new world is going to hurt everybody out there you know i i've made
[2:12:11.080 --> 2:12:21.800]  mistakes in the past i had a primitive level i get threatened by the police that have been
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:26.600]  brainwashed and been militarized and then i lash out instead of historically we need to reach out
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:30.280]  to police and military and they are waking up now look ron paul got more contributions from
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:35.400]  the military anybody else and that's how we're going to defeat this as jack mclean says we've
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:39.720]  got to have the police on our side because the truth is we're all on the same side even if we
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:43.320]  decide to fight with each other when we fight with each other the new order wins your comments on
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:53.880]  that officer i agree with you i know what side i'm on and a lot of the police officers i talk to
[2:12:53.880 --> 2:12:58.920]  they know what side they're on and i tell them that you know you're going to have a choice to
[2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:03.000]  make one day you're going to be asked to do some horrible things and you have to think about it
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:08.600]  right now are you going to take people's guns away from them are you going to force people into
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:15.240]  cattle cars remember what hitler did i impressed us upon at least the young officers the old
[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:20.360]  officers they understand what's going on where this country is going and they understand they
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:27.640]  have to wake up and they have to be on the side of america and we took an oath and i remind these
[2:13:27.640 --> 2:13:35.400]  people that this old is for our country we have to defend this constitution this is the best
[2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:42.600]  constitution in the world we have to keep it enforced now basically this report takes the
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:47.480]  constitution the bill of rights everything good and wholesome and then just spray paints white
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:53.960]  supremacist cop killer all over it in an attempt to demonize the very heart of this country it's
[2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:59.480]  it's it's asinine it's a fraud and i am just buoyed by the fact that so many police and
[2:13:59.480 --> 2:14:07.480]  military are waking up not from my information but from the over the top nature of the criminal fed
[2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:15.000]  government's propaganda right and in couple with what obama is doing right now he's doing what
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  you predicted he would do i mean with his gun control he's doing exactly what you're saying
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:26.840]  he's trying to stop us from having to do three rounds from having 308 rounds and this is nuts
[2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:32.920]  it's not going to work well i mean i i'd like to brag and say i'm real smart but i'm really not
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:38.280]  i just go off what the white papers in government and corporations say they're going to do versus
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:44.280]  what they publicly say on the news i mean my job's like reading the tv guide i mean the un on july
[2:14:44.280 --> 2:14:49.960]  7th 2001 at the uniter meeting in new york with thousands in attendance said we're going to take
[2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:56.680]  every civilian owned firearm period single shot black powder we're going to take all of it
[2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:03.560]  so you know that's their goal and so we're just laying it out i mean now the veterans found out
[2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:08.520]  that obama was planning to make them get their own insurance i mean the people are finding out
[2:15:09.080 --> 2:15:14.040]  that that it's a bunch of made-off criminals the state police in your organization i mean are they
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:20.520]  aware of the banker takeover and how that's a scam as well well not quite that's a little too
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:27.400]  esoteric for them i tried to explain to some of them some of them get it some way some portions
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:36.040]  of it but they don't get it total totally you know um that's a little bit of difficult role to hold
[2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:43.160]  but you're saying on the second amendment issue and because of document cop killer
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:47.160]  white supremacist we've got to restrict guns you know they they mix that in they saw through that
[2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:52.280]  right they said clearly through that because like i said a lot of them
[2:15:53.560 --> 2:16:00.360]  almost majority of you know we they have guns they have rifles they go to ranges that we shoot
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:07.000]  and i guess to some of them are called gun nuts you know and they're not going to get
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:12.920]  their gun they're not but they are trying to they are trying to hire a bunch of social worker
[2:16:12.920 --> 2:16:17.240]  mainline liberal types who are anti-gun to be police but once they get into the culture
[2:16:17.800 --> 2:16:22.680]  it is a pro-second amendment pro-self-defense culture it i mean the 10 percent that our
[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:31.480]  brainwash what do they like uh a few of them or or obama supporters and a couple of my nose
[2:16:31.480 --> 2:16:41.880]  mainly because they're white and they get harassed for it um you know it's kind of hard to have a
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:47.480]  cookie cutter for them they run run the gamut you know they could be left and right but
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:56.040]  but well but i mean you're saying that 10 percent though are just buying this i mean they get a
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:00.040]  thing saying basically ron paul supporters or terrorists libertarians or terrorists and they
[2:17:00.040 --> 2:17:08.040]  just they buy that they buy it about 10 but they get harassed you know wake up you know
[2:17:10.680 --> 2:17:15.560]  by you know the other officers they harass you about it come on you guys got to wake up this
[2:17:15.560 --> 2:17:22.760]  one article and actually it sits right on my briefing table in the briefing room and so
[2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:29.640]  people view it every day and make fun of it you know if this is this was i think the coup de
[2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:37.800]  gras for the new world order at least in this little battle but this is is waking a lot of
[2:17:37.800 --> 2:17:43.960]  people up as to what's really going on in this country well i think the police i talked to
[2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:48.040]  are starting to realize too that's it's not going to be a fun job trying to disarm the
[2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:54.200]  american people because 10 percent of gun owners are a lot of them are veterans they're not happy
[2:17:54.200 --> 2:17:59.800]  about life the economy if 10 percent of 140 million gun owners fight back we're talking about
[2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:05.560]  10 million 14 million people i mean do the police ever talk about what it would be like to try to
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:15.560]  go out and confiscate guns no no not specifically i i don't think it's going to come they don't
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:21.480]  think it's going to come to that but i try to put that little thought in their head so they at least
[2:18:21.480 --> 2:18:29.000]  think about it so when that decision does arrive at least they have thought about it well they'll
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:33.240]  keep doing it incrementally and and but uh you know i just hope that officers are supposed to judge
[2:18:33.240 --> 2:18:38.520]  the law as well as the facts have a wide discretion uh because i've you know i've read over the law and
[2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:43.560]  i just i just you know i know most police are pro second amendment because they understand guns
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:47.560]  they're not stupid but then you've got that other type where you can be in the countryside now in
[2:18:47.560 --> 2:18:52.200]  east texas walking across the road to your land to go bird hunt a cop will pull up and say what's
[2:18:52.200 --> 2:18:56.840]  that shotgun for so there's certainly that percentage that 10 percent well i mean i'm
[2:18:56.840 --> 2:19:00.360]  sure you've heard about ron paul supporters that have been harassed and now we know why
[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:03.480]  and well why do you have a ron paul sticker well why are you asking
[2:19:06.360 --> 2:19:11.880]  yes i have heard about ron paul supporters since i am one being harassed and so the
[2:19:11.880 --> 2:19:18.760]  boring and like you said i i want to uh jason bermas said keep a tape recorder with you and i do
[2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:25.080]  keep a tape recorder in my car and and yeah and i do carry a badge and everything but i still

[2:22:13.800 --> 2:22:19.800]  well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best
[2:22:19.800 --> 2:22:25.320]  interest of the american people while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since d1 in this
[2:22:25.320 --> 2:22:30.600]  election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[2:22:30.600 --> 2:22:37.480]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:43.160]  it's not about left or right it's about a one world government this film documents who obama

[2:24:07.240 --> 2:24:16.680]  alex jones on the gcn radio network i fell into a curtain ring of fire i went down down down
[2:24:16.680 --> 2:24:23.320]  and the flames went higher and carton emma has got the story of bolwin paul and bars in letter
[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:27.640]  in opposition to my ac report the missouri officials good job curtain emma on that one
[2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:33.960]  letter up there soon but we need to add in here that they're considering suing that needs to be
[2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:40.280]  in the headline you know they're considering litigation if lies not retracted or demonization
[2:24:40.280 --> 2:24:50.120]  not retracted something like paul uh you know ron paul bob bar bolwin write letter to my
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:55.880]  ac report demonizing uh you know their supporters and it needs to be in the first line i'm doing
[2:24:55.880 --> 2:24:59.080]  editing even here on the air ladies and gentlemen it's insane we're joined for the rest of the
[2:24:59.080 --> 2:25:02.040]  hour and i apologize for getting him on light but we said i have a state police officer on
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:07.000]  but it's a perfect segue into this he steward roads created a great website it's constitutional
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:12.360]  lawyer but masses of military police have been uh saying they pledge to be oathkeepers and not
[2:25:12.360 --> 2:25:18.280]  violate the bill of rights constitution and and and to follow their oath uh and it's it's when i
[2:25:18.280 --> 2:25:21.400]  read it i said this person has a deep knowledge of what's going on because this is how i would
[2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:25.400]  have written it probably better than i would have written it so uh steward roads thanks for
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:29.800]  coming on sir oh you're welcome and you're absolutely right that was a fantastic segue
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:37.560]  that officer is an oathkeeper and that's exactly what we are here for to do is to bring more men
[2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:43.640]  like that out and most of the members of our of our organization don't use their real names
[2:25:43.640 --> 2:25:48.680]  or we don't even want them who they are because just like that gentleman there just did we want
[2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:52.280]  them to be able to continue in their job and continue doing the good work for the american people
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:57.720]  but because the federal government is so out of control and criminal uh i mean that's a sad
[2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:01.560]  testament that these officers don't even really have their own first amendment to say they don't
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:06.040]  appreciate the country being destroyed that's right and standing up and saying you might might
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:10.840]  actually obey the constitution it gets you can't so that's that's the world we live in right now
[2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:15.320]  but uh you've probably been to our site you can see the the four of testimonials we have in from
[2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:19.560]  veterans most the veterans are not afraid to put their name on it because they're you know they're
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:24.040]  uh no longer with their reach of being punished for it and uh they're standing up and saying no
[2:26:24.040 --> 2:26:28.520]  we're not going to do this and and the veterans are very important because the veterans are there
[2:26:28.520 --> 2:26:34.040]  to teach the young bucks how to behave to show them what they're supposed to be doing and so
[2:26:34.040 --> 2:26:38.280]  that's our that's our mission is to remind them of the oath to teach them what it was they swore
[2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:44.040]  it out to defend and then to steal their resolve to do what's right and that officer is correct
[2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:48.600]  you got to do that in advance you got to do it ahead of time so that when you draw your own lines
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:54.360]  in the sand and prepare yourself mentally to do what's right and then you'll do it absolutely
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:00.760]  just amazing testimonials on the site what gave you the idea to create this and how many people
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:05.560]  have come on the site and pledged in just a few weeks it's been up that they're gonna stand by the
[2:27:05.560 --> 2:27:11.560]  constitution bill writes well i was working for uh in congress paul's uh campaign here in Nevada
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:15.480]  i used to work in his dc office and but i was still focused on the campaign but about a year
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:20.360]  and a half ago i had the idea that you know what do we do next and uh if this campaign is not
[2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:26.280]  successful what's our next move and my thought was as well what's what's our focus of effort
[2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:31.960]  beyond the men with the guns if you're going to have an awakening of one million people
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:36.440]  so you're going to have a chance to awaken one million people to be constitutionalist would
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:42.040]  you want to focus on the military and and and those are the men who are supposed to be our guardians
[2:27:42.040 --> 2:27:49.640]  exactly a tyranny of the guardians of the republic that's what they are yes if tyranny if tyranny's
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:53.320]  going to come it's going to come in the form of a uniform the ron pearl revolution's probably
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:58.520]  woken up the even maitre media says probably 20 30 million americans identify now imagine if we
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:03.960]  focused on the police and military game over for the new world order go ahead exactly precisely
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:07.800]  it's like maneuver warfare theory you go to the you go to the rear of the enemy you go to the
[2:28:07.800 --> 2:28:12.200]  heart of their strength it's kind of like in one of the rings of the ring of power they think the
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:16.200]  ring of power is that these guys are going to do whatever they say they think the oath is their
[2:28:16.200 --> 2:28:20.360]  ring of power but it's not true the oath is to the constitution and even more fundamentally
[2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:25.160]  is to the people and so we're going to take that like the mount doom and toss it right you know
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:30.680]  right up their chute oh man that analogy is just pure gold you are something special
[2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:36.440]  let me tell you something i i write for swat magazine and here's what actually got me thinking
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:41.400]  about this is is about a year and a half ago i wrote a column and in response to that column we got
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:47.800]  a letter from a us uh jr yule colonel us army retired and he said the constitution and our
[2:28:47.800 --> 2:28:52.760]  bill of rights are gravely endangered today and this community of military and veterans
[2:28:52.760 --> 2:28:58.200]  and law enforcement is where they will be saved they are to be saved at all and he had the same
[2:28:58.200 --> 2:29:03.080]  insight you did is look if they can't do it without those guys game over it'd be like the end of the
[2:29:03.080 --> 2:29:08.680]  movie b for vendetta that you know the military stands down and there's nothing between the people
[2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:13.880]  and the vultures nothing and that's what our goal is well i mean police are going to lose their
[2:29:13.880 --> 2:29:17.800]  houses they already are they're going to lose their future in this new world order we're going to
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:22.200]  lose their second amendment yeah and it should all be indentured servants for the rest of their
[2:29:22.200 --> 2:29:28.280]  lives that's right yeah the globalists have overplayed their hand i keep telling listeners
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:34.200]  the phony churches on government payroll i told you this a decade ago now it's declassified
[2:29:34.760 --> 2:29:40.680]  are telling you to stand down so there's several rings of power one is the police and the enforcers
[2:29:40.680 --> 2:29:45.480]  the others is the churches got to take those back stay there sir run tell folks how they

[2:34:09.240 --> 2:34:13.960]  and going back to the mordor analogy you have the tower the mountain of power with the all
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:20.120]  seeing eye with its armies moving across the world but right here in its command base right here in
[2:34:20.120 --> 2:34:27.000]  empire us it is distracted looking looking everywhere for the ring it's that's what this
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:33.480]  mayac report is is they're counting on the police and military being urakai or orcs
[2:34:34.120 --> 2:34:40.760]  or black ships from the east they're they're planning on them going along with this evil
[2:34:41.400 --> 2:34:47.240]  and being seduced by the dark side by by by being played and manipulated and maneuvered into war
[2:34:47.240 --> 2:34:51.960]  with the american people as they destroy their own futures as they burn their own beds their own nest
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:34:59.000]  it's going to fail it is going to fail you have to first believe that and know that and reach out
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:04.440]  to the police and military now so they understand and educate them waking up one police officer
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:10.120]  one activity military persons like waking up a thousand regular americans now we have to also
[2:35:10.120 --> 2:35:14.840]  understand that the key here is is there's people like steward roads over there with
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:22.440]  oath dash keepers dot blogspot.com oath dash keepers dot blogspot.com or just google
[2:35:22.440 --> 2:35:26.280]  his name steward roads oath keepers and it'll come up for you we've got it up on screen
[2:35:26.280 --> 2:35:30.760]  right now prism planet dot tv the fact that there is ron paul and alex jones and
[2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:36.280]  steward roads and jesse ventura and thousands of other prominent people fighting not just
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:41.080]  millions waking up and fighting they they killed me and only makes my information grow that much
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:44.360]  faster if i was the only guy doing this though i'd be dead if steward was the only guy doing this
[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:49.480]  they go set him up or something but there's too many of us now they can't target intimidate
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:52.840]  they had the ron paul girl in here last night i didn't know that she was on my show last time
[2:35:52.840 --> 2:35:59.480]  they were waiting for her outside you know amy allen with crowbars stealing nothing just put
[2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:05.080]  her in the hospital breaking bones that is the type of intimidation i've been physically attacked
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:08.520]  and they've told me shut up or you're dead next time but i fought back and fought them off and
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:12.440]  they didn't like getting hurt real i got hurt bad too but they were you know they were surprised
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:17.080]  that i wasn't a sheep and i actually went absolutely ape because i'm not a slave folks
[2:36:17.080 --> 2:36:21.640]  you attack me i attack right back quite frankly the time enjoyed it you know i mean that's just
[2:36:21.640 --> 2:36:26.280]  how i am uh that's living there you know you don't really live until four people are pounding on
[2:36:26.280 --> 2:36:30.680]  you but sad for her she's a little girl they hurt her bad but you can't let that scare you got to
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:35.160]  say oh that means i'm hurting you that means i'm getting close to the crack of doom to dump this
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:39.720]  ring in you have to dare great ladies and gentlemen and you can succeed okay i'm gonna shut up i made
[2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:43.960]  those points it's just that they're also trying to divide our movements trying to demonize trying
[2:36:43.960 --> 2:36:47.320]  to say don't trust this leader don't trust that leader that's the operative that's what coin tell
[2:36:47.320 --> 2:36:51.720]  pro does this person's a mason that that you know that person's a vatican assassin this person works
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:57.000]  for israel it's the information that's key bill of rights constitution liberty second amendment
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:02.360]  national sovereignty cut the size of government kick them out of the states you know a tree by its
[2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:09.480]  fruits so the other attack is to divide us now go ahead and comment on those points to
[2:37:09.480 --> 2:37:15.320]  her roads and let's get into the health keepers we're absolutely right and that's why both keepers
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:21.400]  and that we always stress that this was this was this was a first um contemplated and first plan
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:25.400]  before the election we didn't care who got elected it didn't make a difference who was going to be
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:29.960]  president we saw the growth of executive power and we're talking about active duty military
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:34.840]  and veterans and and these gentlemen don't care who's who's president we're looking at the big
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:40.520]  picture and we're also we stay neutral on uh on politics we stay neutral on the iraq war in fact i'll
[2:37:40.520 --> 2:37:46.120]  be i'll be um speaking at possibly speaking at a big event in june a big pro troops rally in june
[2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:51.880]  i was invited by uh former navy seal captain larry bailey of gathering of eagles so a lot a lot of
[2:37:51.880 --> 2:37:56.360]  the more hardcore conservative groups who might not have listened during bush are starting to wake
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:38:01.240]  up and understand what the what the great danger is and so we're seeing an awakening like the officer
[2:38:01.240 --> 2:38:05.960]  said it's a quickening and it doesn't make a difference each forget about left and right
[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:10.360]  and forget about that kind of stuff like you said before it's about liberty or tyranny that's the
[2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:14.520]  only that's the dividing line and so we go back to the basics we go back to the differential
[2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:19.640]  independence we go back to the bill of right we go back to the constitution those are our all
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:26.280]  those are our common bond absolutely that's all we that's all we care about and you swore
[2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:31.240]  an oath to defend the constitution and you swore an oath more fundamentally to defend the people
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:35.960]  of this country and that's all we care about that's what really matters and their interest their
[2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:40.440]  interest is with the american people too of course well you know what they don't belong to the mordor
[2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:45.480]  in the potomac they belong to us they're our fathers they're our sons they're our sisters
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:52.120]  they're our uncles they are us they don't belong to them they belong to us we're taking that's right
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:57.400]  that's right they don't belong to mordor do they no they don't yeah but then we're taking them back
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:03.560]  they belong to mitis terrace that's the whole thing and you know and that's and that's why
[2:39:03.560 --> 2:39:08.680]  they have to demonize people that's why you saw hr 1955 with a bipartisan assault on the american
[2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:14.440]  people first thing you do is you label someone the enemy you you you make them the other dehumanize
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:20.680]  them and then you you turn the forces against them and so but we're fighting back and uh
[2:39:20.680 --> 2:39:24.840]  depending in your short your show is important that you know what i think what the military and
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:28.840]  police up the biggest and we've confirmed this with state police and military everywhere it's
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:33.160]  even been in the news but we knew about it before it was you know i mean the point is before it was
[2:39:33.160 --> 2:39:37.080]  in the news they're telling them that you know mainline americans are about to start bombing
[2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:41.240]  police stations we've got to do ied training the army is going to be on the streets of america
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:45.480]  they'll be a new world order but it's good and those that are against their bad right they're
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:50.120]  now seeing the whole apparatus that was supposedly to fight al-qaeda has now been swung
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:54.600]  around like a cannon and aimed at the american people and the police and military are going
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:40:01.240]  whoa that's right yeah in fact we just we just now put up on our our site an article on uh on
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:05.960]  how enemy combatant status was first proposed during the clinton administration most folks
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:12.200]  don't realize that but that idea of using tribunals for even american citizens was first proposed
[2:40:12.200 --> 2:40:17.240]  through the clinton years to be used against big van the militias and what clinton didn't do
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:22.680]  was unfortunately put into put into full effect and now obama's got it and it's very likely he'll
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:27.320]  turn around and apply it domestically you know to average to average gun owners that's the big
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:31.240]  that's what we think might be the next spark you know going back to the mortemortor analogy it's just
[2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:37.400]  too good remember when the keeper of the fortress goes insane and says no we're all dead and starts
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:42.840]  pouring oil on himself saying we can't beat him there's nothing we can do and sets himself on fire
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:48.600]  that's that that's the spirit more than just waking up police and military it's the change
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:54.760]  is an inside job it's all of us have to decide victory is ours and when it's not just it's not
[2:40:54.760 --> 2:41:01.160]  just a spirit or an idea it's the truth we have incredible power but we have to prepare ourselves
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:06.920]  steal ourselves as you said like steel to understand this work and just commit and when you commit
[2:41:06.920 --> 2:41:10.440]  and aren't worried if they demonize you set you up kill you whatever they're gonna do you just
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:15.400]  commit it's like a million pound weight goes off of you and you're truly alive and you're now and
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:19.880]  you're now in communion with the founding fathers and every other rebel against tyranny in history
[2:41:20.760 --> 2:41:24.680]  that's right we're all gonna die anyway no one gets out of here alive so what counts is whether
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:29.080]  you leave your children free that's all that matters that's all that matters that's really it
[2:41:29.080 --> 2:41:34.360]  and and take back to your analogy there now they want you to think it's hopeless you know but yeah
[2:41:34.360 --> 2:41:38.040]  it's like if you like you're staring into the you know the into the you're seeing only their
[2:41:38.040 --> 2:41:43.000]  propaganda if only if all you do is is is look at what they want you to see you'll think it's
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:48.040]  hopeless that's right he's staring into the uh crystal and it's only what it's a tv set it's
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:53.080]  only what mordor wants them to see that's exactly right they're like well said break your tv you
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:57.320]  know break that break that stuff and get on the get on the web and and communicate with your
[2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:01.480]  fellow man and here's the thing about oak keepers it's positive that's why people respond to it
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:07.240]  so much it's positive it's not just more negativity they're starting to see the other side but look
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:12.120]  you know like you said we have we have the strength and we have the power and you can't
[2:42:12.120 --> 2:42:16.920]  just assume the military is your enemy you can't just assume police are your enemy they want you
[2:42:16.920 --> 2:42:21.160]  to think that they want to know i have fallen i have fallen into that i mean over the years
[2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:25.640]  i've also got to reach out to them when i see the outrage i was wondering about five years ago
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:29.720]  why does the media show the worst police brutality over and over again why do they focus on it so
[2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:34.520]  much and then i realized they want to split us apart which puts the police more in their gang
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:39.000]  mentality and the people mourn their mentality and that's why they're advertising and i'm actually
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:44.200]  helping them when i put when i make a big deal out of it right well you know you gotta have
[2:42:44.200 --> 2:42:48.440]  the truth like Patrick Henry said you gotta see the truth and you know no no no exactly we put
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:53.240]  the truth out but but but we have to also add understand they're encouraging officers to act
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:57.480]  like this and understand they're not all like this and if we fall in to just hating them and
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:43:01.960]  being threatened by them that's what they want that's right and and that's that's one of the
[2:43:01.960 --> 2:43:06.360]  values having a man like he just had on where he tells you that look not all officers like this and
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:11.000]  and you'd be surprised we have a testimony look on our site by a police officer i'm gonna find
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:14.920]  it here what we're talking and i'll read it to you but he just basically says look the majority
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:20.520]  of the guys in my force agree we won't do these things and and so i'm getting i'm hearing that
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:24.120]  from marines too i got a marine sergeant the other day i talked to on the phone he's like
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:27.800]  i talked to my guys about this stuff all the time and i make sure they know their oath
[2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:31.720]  a lot of the young guys they first get to his unit they think the throat is to the president
[2:43:31.720 --> 2:43:35.480]  and they have to set him straight you know but but but now more and more they're talking about
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:39.880]  this stuff and that was going on you know before we we found those keepers it was going on already
[2:43:39.880 --> 2:43:43.640]  so we're just kind of tapping into what's already happening i'm looking for that right now here we
[2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:49.800]  go uh this officer says um he's a texas police officer because after serving the navy from 90
[2:43:49.800 --> 2:43:54.680]  to 93 on board the uss blue ridge i became a police officer and i'm still on the force
[2:43:55.240 --> 2:43:59.720]  not only will i refuse any unlawful order that bollocks the constitution that will fight the
[2:43:59.720 --> 2:44:04.040]  tyrants that give the orders rest assured that me and my brothers in law enforcement talk about
[2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:09.880]  this subject on a regular basis about 80 percent till the same way i do i asked the rookies that
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:15.320]  when it comes down to nut cutting who's side will you be on founding fathers who made this country
[2:44:15.320 --> 2:44:21.240]  so great or the tyrants that are in power now i took the oath twice and will uphold it twofold
[2:44:21.240 --> 2:44:26.120]  god bless america and you find his name calling carly some some people are willing to put their
[2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:31.240]  names on it other folks understandably or not so but that's the that's the sentiment we're getting
[2:44:31.240 --> 2:44:36.600]  we're getting flooded emails like that saying yeah we're we're we're we're with you you know
[2:44:38.520 --> 2:44:42.680]  well i would add to this that you know getting into the spiritual angle of this standing up for
[2:44:42.680 --> 2:44:49.000]  liberty and goodness you know as as marlithar king said the universe bends towards truth towards
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:55.320]  justice that it's providence and if you don't understand that folks when you decide to fight
[2:44:55.320 --> 2:44:59.400]  evil and and really get your head straight and and you really are fighting evil not being manipulated
[2:44:59.400 --> 2:45:03.400]  into fighting some red herring the establishment gives you they're very good at that it's like
[2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:08.200]  an electrical connection it it's spiritual and then when i said that earlier you literally then
[2:45:08.200 --> 2:45:12.840]  connect in to the founding fathers and everybody else that stood up for goodness you you know you
[2:45:12.840 --> 2:45:17.640]  can you literally connect into the disciples who were fighting the corruption of rome you literally
[2:45:17.640 --> 2:45:23.800]  it's it's like a barrier a dam is removed when you start standing up for freedom because that's
[2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:27.720]  that's all that matters in the world that's always a struggle between good and evil there's
[2:45:27.720 --> 2:45:32.120]  always evil trying to take over there's always evil trying to dominate this is what life is all
[2:45:32.120 --> 2:45:38.040]  about is you know defending liberty and freedom and building things and making life better that's
[2:45:38.040 --> 2:45:43.160]  right and the first thing you gotta do is you gotta not lift your control you you gotta say you
[2:45:43.160 --> 2:45:47.880]  gotta you look at the big picture and realize that that's what that's the value of of the oath
[2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:52.680]  is that everyone has taken that oath in the military you know they did so understand and
[2:45:52.680 --> 2:45:58.520]  they could mean their life and and these men they take it so seriously still i've gotten letters
[2:45:58.520 --> 2:46:03.080]  it's i can't read them i'll start i'll start calling but letters from vietnam veterans and
[2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:09.480]  korean war veterans and and they still take that oath serious to this day and and they understand
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:17.960]  that they have a line going all the way back to you know the men of april 1917 75 even before that
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:23.960]  you know that they understand that the line of men who have fought and bled and died for freedom
[2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:30.120]  and they understand that all those men gave them a sacred trust and now it's it's it's their
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:36.920]  watch that's why our motto is is not on our watch because now it's our turn to make sure
[2:46:36.920 --> 2:46:42.520]  that the light of liberty does not go out because if america falls the world will fall
[2:46:42.520 --> 2:46:47.960]  into an age of darkness and that's the truth and these guys they know it and they're they're
[2:46:47.960 --> 2:46:53.240]  waking up look at north korea look at china look at mexico they're all falling into total
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:46:58.840]  corruption mass murder and open sewage running down the streets that's what evil does it just it
[2:46:58.840 --> 2:47:03.960]  just it and very few nations in history we haven't been perfect here in the u.s but compared to others
[2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:08.520]  it's been amazing four percent of the world's population half the world's wealth until the
[2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:12.840]  bankers took over now they're taking it from us and that was produced here and again that's
[2:47:12.840 --> 2:47:16.360]  what a little bit of liberty we haven't been perfect but it's a lot compared to other countries
[2:47:17.160 --> 2:47:22.600]  either the jewel of liberty as thomas jefferson said must be guarded it is the engine of everything
[2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:28.520]  good that said i mean that said freedom is all that matters and as franklin said those who would
[2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:33.400]  give up freedom for for perceived security will have neither and so you can't give up freedom
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:36.600]  and it's the it's the fundamental what you just said it's the engine of all it's good
[2:47:36.600 --> 2:47:43.080]  it and and so that the the secret is is not to let fear control you and since 9 11 people have been
[2:47:43.080 --> 2:47:48.680]  so afraid they've allowed all the infrastructure but with the talent for a state to be put in place
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:54.600]  and as you know and so now now what we have to do just to stop it you don't stop it in the courts
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:57.160]  and you and apparently you don't stop it in congress either they'll go ahead and do whatever
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:48:02.680]  they want anyway what you do is you stop it at the base level of the people to sing no
[2:48:02.680 --> 2:48:08.360]  and here's an example i was on 93.7 fm for an hour yesterday downtown during south by southwest
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:13.720]  and i walked by three police and they were all fans of the show and wanted to shake my hand
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:21.800]  so you know that's an example that's an example even after all of my you know ranting and raving
[2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:25.640]  you know they've told me hey we don't like what's happening either and we don't like how the media
[2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:31.480]  just totally focuses on the bad cops and so i could see i was i've also been fooled by that spell
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:36.360]  you know as i get older i learn more and more how this sophisticated mind control system works
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:41.080]  all of us you know are waking up together and i agree i mean when i say on there i feel a quickening
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:46.760]  i see a quickening it's like i just you know jumped up a 300 foot cliff into cold icy water
[2:48:46.760 --> 2:48:51.560]  you know i mean it's invigorating it's bracing it's like whoa and then to realize that myself and
[2:48:51.560 --> 2:48:59.480]  others are at the very center of a crossroads that is the future destiny of humanity that's right
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:03.880]  when people look back on this time it's going to dwarf the importance of 1776 i believe
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:09.320]  it might well it might well and that's that's the key is is to break the spell you know they've
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:14.840]  been under a spell and we've been under a spell and it's time to break it absolutely and so what
[2:49:14.840 --> 2:49:19.960]  what we did is we issued a declaration of 10 orders we will not obey and that's what's kind
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:24.040]  of causing that kind of a lot of controversy and firestorm and when i go around the web
[2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:28.280]  but look at different forums are discussing it it's what's happening is exactly what we wanted
[2:49:28.280 --> 2:49:33.560]  to happen we want we wanted veterans and current serving military to have discussions about where
[2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:38.920]  their line is each person has their own i mean every every service member has an obligation
[2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:44.680]  that just not just that they can refuse it uh legal order and awful order they have an obligation to
[2:49:45.880 --> 2:49:50.840]  they have to and so they have to make a decision for themselves where that line is and so
[2:49:50.840 --> 2:49:54.600]  as the officer said a minute ago you have to do it ahead of time so that's our our declaration
[2:49:54.600 --> 2:50:00.760]  of 10 orders we carefully crafted these to tie into american history because the history is repeating
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:05.560]  itself much of the causes of revolution are happening again and also the history of the 20th
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:10.840]  century with it with the death camps and and mass internment and what we see happening today
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:16.440]  it all flows together so do you want to go down to the 10 orders or yeah let's do that in the next
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:19.720]  segment and then if you can stay five minutes to the next hour that our next guest is coming on
[2:50:19.720 --> 2:50:23.080]  i want to invite you back routinely now you're a busy guy but you need to talk to an Anderson
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:26.840]  maybe get a genesis radio show or something you're very very eloquent and when we come back we'll go
[2:50:26.840 --> 2:50:32.520]  over the 10 points but what i like is that you know that huge romp whole revolution at first
[2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:37.400]  people like oh it went nowhere and i said no it's a delayed explosion like in force 10 navarone
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:41.080]  when they bomb the dam and they're like where is it and he just said just just sitting there
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:46.280]  smoking a pipe just wait a moment uh you know that's how and then suddenly it starts breaking boom
[2:50:46.280 --> 2:50:50.840]  and and and now we're seeing that and then people realize they can defeat the enemy in the info war
[2:50:50.840 --> 2:50:55.240]  and now they're just blasting they're picking up arms in the revolution of the mind people are

[2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:14.920]  liberty it's over the top i'm sure you heard sir now steward roads with oath keepers oath dash
[2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:20.120]  keepers dot blogspot.com that the house has passed the forced conscription of the american people
[2:55:20.120 --> 2:55:27.880]  bill and i happen to have the army code that the pentagon has issued saying it will be forced
[2:55:27.880 --> 2:55:34.760]  military service i mean the the hour is late but that's okay this dark is before the dawn
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:39.400]  and so i think i think uh i think it's pretty clear that we're going to stand tall that's why
[2:55:39.400 --> 2:55:44.200]  that's why we bumped up our program we're going to do a you know a regular site but we saw that
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:49.640]  things were happening in fact i called uh kernel half good also of the island national guard and
[2:55:49.640 --> 2:55:54.680]  he lied to me like he lied to you now they have a dedicated mouth facility 80 miles berth of that
[2:55:54.680 --> 2:55:58.760]  town they're going to do the exercise in and he just flat lied to us and so that's one thing that
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:03.880]  got us got us hopping mad and decided to put it up on blog spot first one thing i do want to say
[2:56:03.880 --> 2:56:08.040]  i want to i want to let folks know that i i'd write for swat magazine and i want to make it
[2:56:08.040 --> 2:56:11.480]  clear that that's a magazine and that's you know most people think it's just for law enforcement
[2:56:11.480 --> 2:56:15.400]  it's not and the gentleman who run that magazine are dedicated patriots and they're going to get
[2:56:15.400 --> 2:56:21.320]  both keepers uh free ad space so i encourage folks to check out swat magazine uh run by true
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:27.560]  patriots um so that's my plug for them now yeah give out the website because no that's good we
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:32.840]  have to take the high ground here that's right yeah you betcha and and the mission has always
[2:56:32.840 --> 2:56:36.600]  been that's why they asked me to write that column he said clear wolf write it you know clear wolf
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:41.960]  is correct yes right she's right the enemy the gate column and she has to take it over when she
[2:56:41.960 --> 2:56:45.880]  got kind of burnt out but their mission is is to make sure that there's the separation between
[2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:50.840]  law enforcement and and the people is broken down they don't believe there should be a separation
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:56.680]  and so rich lucible the man in own swat um has has stood up and dedicated that that entire column
[2:56:56.680 --> 2:57:01.320]  every month to the mission of uh defending the bill of right well we knew this would come
[2:57:01.880 --> 2:57:05.480]  when the new world order emerged admitted everything we've been warning people about
[2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:08.600]  that's why i said even if we get laughed at tell people the documents tell them the truth
[2:57:08.600 --> 2:57:11.880]  because when they finally emerge when they make their big move which is now happening
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:16.440]  uh then people would have been warned and then they would wake up but also as the police and
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:21.480]  military are being twisted in their mission now to carry out the globalism that would be
[2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:26.760]  the big wake up call there i think the enemy trying to program them right now is the is is
[2:57:26.760 --> 2:57:32.600]  waking police and military up faster than even the patriots absolutely and of course obama is
[2:57:32.600 --> 2:57:37.080]  is acting like a complete fool what he did with it with the uh with the veterans and forced them to
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:41.560]  to care for okay for their own medical care it's just a huge blunder to show the arrogance
[2:57:41.560 --> 2:57:46.840]  you know the hubris oh yeah and so the the anger and outrage they're blind they can't see
[2:57:47.560 --> 2:57:51.400]  certain things they're almost autistic in some ways all right well we're about to break we only
[2:57:51.400 --> 2:57:55.560]  have like five yeah they're they're they're delusional uh we're about to break but start with
[2:57:55.560 --> 2:58:01.240]  the 10 points you betcha well the 10 points are just what we think are the most likely uh hot points
[2:58:01.240 --> 2:58:07.160]  and tripwires and what we uh think officers should be considering and soldiers as the lines in the
[2:58:07.160 --> 2:58:13.560]  sand they will not cross number one is we will not obey any order to disarm the american people
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:16.840]  and that was like you know that was the cause of the first american revolution and that was the final
[2:58:16.840 --> 2:58:23.400]  part lexington and concord continue number two number two we will not obey orders to conduct
[2:58:23.400 --> 2:58:26.840]  warrantless searches of the american people and there again the rift of assistance warrantless
[2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:31.480]  searches were one of the causes the american revolution and number three is we will not obey
[2:58:31.480 --> 2:58:35.960]  orders to detain american citizens is unlawful enemy combat orders to defend their military

[3:00:10.200 --> 3:00:16.280]  he has spurred so many thoughts in me my instincts uh you know who our ancestors were
[3:00:16.280 --> 3:00:19.720]  everything that i've added quite a bit today i want to have you back up in the next few weeks
[3:00:19.720 --> 3:00:25.080]  for a full hour to talk more about oathkeepers and uh take your phone calls some amazing
[3:00:25.080 --> 3:00:29.560]  individual steward roads there's so many great people that you know are out there prominently
[3:00:29.560 --> 3:00:33.160]  fighting the globalists we just commend them run through the other eight points in the five
[3:00:33.160 --> 3:00:39.240]  minutes we have left sir you betcha um the other ones are we will not obey orders to impose martial
[3:00:39.240 --> 3:00:46.760]  law on a state or state of emergency on a state and five is we will not obey orders to invade
[3:00:46.760 --> 3:00:51.400]  subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty that's the best kind of a reflection on the uh
[3:00:51.400 --> 3:00:54.760]  the initiatives that come out recently where states are standing up and say we're going to
[3:00:54.760 --> 3:00:59.720]  interpose ourselves between the federal government and our own people and that was an issue back in
[3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:04.920]  the 1770s because they would remove governors or legislatures and put in puppets but go ahead
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:09.640]  exactly and number six is you will not obey any order to blockade american cities
[3:01:09.640 --> 3:01:13.800]  with us turning them into giant concentration camps and that was first done to boston at the
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:18.920]  time of the american revolution like you just said boston was put under military uh dictatorship
[3:01:18.920 --> 3:01:24.280]  with general gauge and then when the fighting started the people of boston were told you turning
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:28.280]  your guns would give you safe passes out of the city and they turned their guns in and then they
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:32.200]  were told they could not leave and they were kept there and then it was turned into a concentration
[3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:38.840]  camp until until until the uh militia showed up and can pick the British out of boston so number
[3:01:38.840 --> 3:01:42.920]  seven is we will not obey any order to force american citizens into any form of detention
[3:01:42.920 --> 3:01:48.200]  camps under any pretext and we fight the history an unfortunate history of the japanese internment
[3:01:48.200 --> 3:01:52.360]  here at home and also the history around the world oppressive governments and they make war on their
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:57.400]  own people they put them into camps in part that's done to the women and children in the camp so that
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:02:03.320]  the men who are fighting will turn themselves in on behalf of their children and the schools public
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:07.560]  schools admit they've been drilling to grab kids without asking on fema buses and then tell parents
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:11.800]  to report so their tyranny does the same thing over and over again continue that's right number
[3:02:11.800 --> 3:02:17.000]  eight we will not obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on us soil against
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:22.040]  the american people to keep the peace or to maintain control and as you know these these uh we've
[3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:26.920]  been hearing rumors of this for for decades but we're now hearing the same rumors once again
[3:02:26.920 --> 3:02:31.800]  from very credible sources that the obama administration is even considering bringing
[3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:36.760]  in foreign troops no no no no the agreement's have been signed toronto star canadian mexican
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:41.400]  troops to be used i four troops to be used those are not rumors i have hundreds of mainstream
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:48.040]  articles if you'd like them absolutely the email to me yeah no no go ahead no go ahead go ahead
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:53.000]  no no it's just that no i mean i've had colonel craig robertson others on who have had like their
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:57.080]  nephews at west point and they and you know they send in famous generals to tell them we're going
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:03:01.960]  to use foreign troops but it's a good thing so no that is going on that's not a rumor oh i i know
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:05.960]  i just i just like to i don't like to hit my bad for people well no i mean it's true they're planning
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:10.360]  it the rumor is they may bring them in i see what you're saying go ahead right exactly we will not
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:14.680]  obey any orders to confiscate the property to american people including food and other essential
[3:03:14.680 --> 3:03:19.000]  supplies that's number nine that's in the public executive orders they're planning that so that's
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:23.720]  public though mm-hmm yep we will not obey any orders which are fringe on the right of the people
[3:03:23.720 --> 3:03:28.120]  to free speech peaceably assemble and petition their government for redistributed i mean all
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:34.280]  these are basic they should be common sense you know you know no brainers but unfortunately
[3:03:34.280 --> 3:03:38.120]  as you know you have to remind people of the basics sometimes we can't take it for granted
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:42.680]  that someone's gonna be thinking about this stuff ahead of time we could treat it you know we're
[3:03:42.680 --> 3:03:47.000]  hearing now that a lot of that was caught because those guard troops and those those uh
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:51.160]  those officers hadn't thought about it ahead of time they're kind of like hot flatfooted
[3:03:51.160 --> 3:03:54.760]  when they were told to go do these things and so we want them to think about it in advance
[3:03:54.760 --> 3:03:58.200]  and we we don't think it's going to go down the same way again that's right iowa was a gun
[3:03:58.200 --> 3:04:03.880]  confiscation drill that's admitted and then they sent out 22 mp's and a colonel to the alabama
[3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:08.760]  shooting and now they're looking at charges of posicom and doddish violation that's right that's
[3:04:08.760 --> 3:04:13.240]  a good sign it's a good sign that that within the military there's still people who understand
[3:04:13.240 --> 3:04:18.920]  the the necessary walls separation between civil and military power and and take it serious so
[3:04:18.920 --> 3:04:23.560]  yeah we're very confident we feel very good about this one thing i do want to ask your listeners to

[3:08:27.720 --> 3:08:30.920]  going to go directly to our guest to apologize for reschedule twice last week
[3:08:30.920 --> 3:08:34.200]  so much has been happening he's written an amazing book i've already read most of it
[3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:37.640]  somewhere in here in the office for somebody find me that new world order book
[3:08:37.640 --> 3:08:41.080]  corporatism the secret government of the new world order talking to this professor here in
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:49.240]  just a moment researcher but finishing up with steward roads of oath-keepers.blogspot.com
[3:08:49.240 --> 3:08:53.880]  let me tell you everybody here how they're going to attack what you're doing and it's with fear
[3:08:53.880 --> 3:08:59.800]  again intimidation of police and military that speak out but as more and more speak out
[3:08:59.800 --> 3:09:02.760]  it's kind of like in those famous you know historical things where we have a church full
[3:09:02.760 --> 3:09:06.200]  of people in the revolutionary war and they'll say who stands with us it takes about a minute
[3:09:06.200 --> 3:09:09.880]  and one guy steps forward and then two step forward then everybody steps forward same thing
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:16.040]  with the alamo in 1836 the enemy and i've been about google this it's already out there it's
[3:09:16.040 --> 3:09:20.760]  going to say don't sign up for this it's fed's getting your name in the list and they're going to get
[3:09:20.760 --> 3:09:27.080]  you you have to be i've always said this out in the open resisting the new world order
[3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:33.480]  speaking out involved we are the majority we have to shatter that illusion that we're not
[3:09:33.480 --> 3:09:38.840]  the majority and we have to get past the mind game of fear and so i think it's a great idea
[3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:42.440]  whether it's anonymous you write letters and post things or other people should start other
[3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:48.840]  oath-keeper sites more groups lots of people but it's good in my experience just to go
[3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:53.720]  past the point of return and to commit we're only saying we'll follow our oath you know i mean
[3:09:53.720 --> 3:09:56.840]  that's how i got the city of austin was saying they were going to vote against the patriot act
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:02.040]  repudiation they were going to vote for the patriot act and keep it and i went in there
[3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:05.720]  and i gave them an impassioned the most powerful speech i probably ever get because it was directly
[3:10:05.720 --> 3:10:10.840]  from my soul and i explained to them their children had no future i explained to them all we were doing
[3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:15.960]  had no future this continued that all they were doing was reaffirming the bill of rights
[3:10:15.960 --> 3:10:19.800]  constitution all they were doing was saying they follow their oaths of office for the city council
[3:10:19.800 --> 3:10:26.360]  the police the firemen the workers and that they had to do it and they did vote to overthrow it
[3:10:26.360 --> 3:10:30.360]  and people that were saying they were going to vote against voted for because i mean i poured
[3:10:30.360 --> 3:10:34.840]  everything into literally trying to reach in and grab them you know grab you know just literally
[3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:39.560]  brush up against their souls and i did you know literally bending my will with goodness towards
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:43.640]  them and believe me that's what humanity is all about folks you've got power you don't know you
[3:10:43.640 --> 3:10:48.120]  have it's a survival mechanism with the truth to literally be able to reach out to people
[3:10:48.120 --> 3:10:51.400]  when you're telling the truth it's unstoppable the globalists are going to pull a lot of other
[3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:56.760]  tricks but i wanted to just enclosing uh steward rhodes get your take on that enemy attack angle
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:11:00.760]  and has that already happened well not yet and here's we're going to do we're going to do the
[3:11:00.760 --> 3:11:05.160]  same thing but that's uh constable to this campaign we're going to let the fuse already got an
[3:11:05.160 --> 3:11:10.840]  officer uh in houston who's volunteered to run our facebook operation and we encourage folks to
[3:11:10.840 --> 3:11:15.720]  start up meetup groups i mean in the website we'd like to listen to testimonies to the websites
[3:11:15.720 --> 3:11:19.720]  everyone can go there and read the testimonials and we don't screen anything we post them they
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:25.720]  send them we post them and uh but but as far as for what and by decentralizing but by decentralizing
[3:11:25.720 --> 3:11:32.120]  with meetups it turns the enemy the engine loose we're no intelligence unit no group in the government
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:37.080]  could track or trace or stop what we're doing or try dirty tricks anybody because there's too many
[3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:41.800]  of us and agents that are assigned to try to infiltrate or cause problems will convert over
[3:11:41.800 --> 3:11:46.520]  to our side i'd say 80 percent of the time exactly the other thing we do we do encourage
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:52.680]  active duty to uh stay anonymous unless they're uh short timers are going to get out soon or you
[3:11:52.680 --> 3:11:56.840]  know a few people standing up and then making a convicted statement is fine but for the most part
[3:11:56.840 --> 3:12:01.080]  we do think it's probably wise for most of them just as an anonymous statement well that's their
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:06.040]  decision i'm just saying most of this is anonymous i'm saying we need more i think to go all the way
[3:12:06.040 --> 3:12:09.640]  because that's that's what's going to shatter the illusion of the establishment
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:14.920]  i agree but it's up to them i i i want them to know they can do it anonymously they can go on
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:19.320]  there and any any discussion and dispose the anonymous comment and we'll turn it into an
[3:12:19.320 --> 3:12:25.000]  anonymous post um and the veterans definitely should stand up and be counted for sure yeah i mean
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:29.800]  they'll charge machine gun nests and fly helicopters into hell but you know that they won't stand up
[3:12:29.800 --> 3:12:35.400]  in the country's imploding no they are standing up sir we can we commend you the website again is
[3:12:35.400 --> 3:12:40.520]  oath dash keepers dot blogspot.com or just google oath keepers and folks will find it that way we'll

[3:13:30.680 --> 3:13:35.880]  inspiration there we live in a nation full of men who young men especially were confused being
[3:13:35.880 --> 3:13:41.080]  raised by these fake churches and tv and public schools and they did you know they get to be for
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:44.280]  twenty thirty years old don't know what they're doing don't know who they are i think what you're
[3:13:44.280 --> 3:13:49.960]  doing is helping them learn how to be men you know by the entire nation i would say yeah we've
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:54.520]  never been given our true identity and people are unhappy until they find what the identity is
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:13:58.760]  fight for freedom fight for liberty be informed be involved engage the world you're only alive
[3:13:58.760 --> 3:14:03.640]  watch tell us about yourself tell us about the book okay i think um one of the reasons that you
[3:14:03.640 --> 3:14:08.200]  wanted me to come on was uh i just recently got fired from Purdue University for an incident
[3:14:08.200 --> 3:14:13.160]  that happened with a gun is actually my second incident with um a gun at the university uh
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:18.600]  and well anyway about me out my name is jeffrey grub i uh i'm the author of a corporatism
[3:14:18.600 --> 3:14:25.240]  which is published by progressive press it's on amazon and uh i'm a 38th been an instructor
[3:14:25.240 --> 3:14:30.680]  in philosophy at a number of schools in northern indiana and i was fired from two of them actually
[3:14:30.680 --> 3:14:35.240]  the first time was farce from indiana university for talking about vaccines and the new world
[3:14:35.240 --> 3:14:39.560]  order in 911 in a bioethics class and they sure didn't like that too much and got rid of me real
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:44.200]  quick then i got a i've got a lot of publications and i look pretty good on paper to the university
[3:14:44.200 --> 3:14:47.640]  so i got another job real quick into pretty university system where i've been getting my
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:55.240]  phd i'm actually actually a lecturer at the non phd um teacher at a university and um i recently
[3:14:55.240 --> 3:15:00.200]  had i thought i was teaching at pretty north central up in northern indiana which is a branch
[3:15:00.200 --> 3:15:04.520]  camp at the preview pretty university and i had requested to teach in the prisons because they
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:09.880]  have a little program where they teach in teach prisoners inmates in the prisons and i was on
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:13.240]  my way to i've been doing it for the last 18 months or so and i was on my way to work i think
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:18.280]  was february 24 so rushing around like crazy and you know in a big i'm really busy writing books
[3:15:18.280 --> 3:15:23.000]  taking care of my family working two jobs etc and forgot that i had no you're just like jimmy
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:28.360]  johnson who twice has tried to take his handgun because he gets death threats and stuff on why
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:33.080]  couldn't he you know onto the airplane and he and they open you know they scan the briefcase and
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:37.480]  there's the gun so similar thing happened to you yeah they got these anti you know the nation's
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:41.400]  full of these anti second amendment zones and you know i tell someone i mean i forgot to take
[3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:44.680]  my gun out of my school supplies because i had it on because i was running errands in the morning
[3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:48.760]  before you know during the morning before i went up to teach at the prison and you know of course
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:52.760]  then the media they won't report on you know depleted uranium and the burning of the rainforest
[3:15:52.760 --> 3:15:57.160]  and all this kind of stuff was they wanted to do is report on me a professor well i'm called a
[3:15:57.160 --> 3:16:01.640]  lecturer forgot to take my gun out of my school supplies you know it's in the indian apple star
[3:16:01.640 --> 3:16:05.800]  and the chicago tribune and they get the story all wrong they say you know i was trying to smuggle
[3:16:05.800 --> 3:16:10.200]  the gun and all this crazy stuff and it's just it's just pretty amazing that that's what it just
[3:16:10.200 --> 3:16:13.880]  shows that that's what the media is all about the mainstream media that's what they're going to fail
[3:16:13.880 --> 3:16:18.440]  you know the future is is us is this this voice you know against the new order i think a lot of
[3:16:18.440 --> 3:16:22.520]  these universities are going to you know we're just beginning this economic crisis and it's
[3:16:22.520 --> 3:16:26.200]  you know a lot of universities when this economic crisis really gets going you know later this year
[3:16:26.200 --> 3:16:30.600]  into next year the lot of them are going to fail and i think eventually with american revolution
[3:16:30.600 --> 3:16:34.360]  two starting here we're going to get new universities or the ones that exist are going to be heavily
[3:16:34.360 --> 3:16:39.480]  modified i think our information our voice i think is the future there so i mean i don't you
[3:16:39.480 --> 3:16:43.960]  know that i got fired from my job really i don't care i've been teaching for eight years you know
[3:16:43.960 --> 3:16:47.880]  all summer a lot of classes i'm anxious to take some time off and plus i don't really know where
[3:16:47.880 --> 3:16:51.400]  i fit in these schools anymore i mean these universities they're don't they're not teaching
[3:16:51.400 --> 3:16:55.560]  empirical information i mean it's hard for people to understand this if you're not really in the
[3:16:55.560 --> 3:16:59.080]  university system paying attention what's going on but they're not you know you don't get into
[3:16:59.080 --> 3:17:03.480]  classes sit there and tell your students okay i got this scientific article from this top journal
[3:17:03.480 --> 3:17:07.240]  and this scientific article from this article from this top journal we're going to just debate
[3:17:07.240 --> 3:17:10.280]  these and we're going to get to the bottom of things and we're going to be empirical researchers
[3:17:10.280 --> 3:17:15.640]  that almost never how they teach you the german 200 year old model of not learning how to think
[3:17:15.640 --> 3:17:20.920]  and learning how magical the world is and how things connect it's all just by rote regurgitating
[3:17:21.640 --> 3:17:26.840]  information yeah exactly well they got these agendas like when i was teaching bioethics
[3:17:26.840 --> 3:17:31.480]  to indian university northwest which i was fired from i was teaching they wanted me to teach this
[3:17:31.480 --> 3:17:35.560]  bioethics class and i said okay that sounds great i'd love to but didn't have a whole lot of background
[3:17:35.560 --> 3:17:39.000]  into but i said i'll do it because i could be and it was really eugenics class they wanted to
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:43.320]  teach her yeah yeah they wanted me to teach eugenics which you know it doesn't really by the way
[3:17:43.320 --> 3:17:48.520]  we've never talked before i just knew that because that's what they teach but go ahead yeah no right
[3:17:48.520 --> 3:17:51.720]  well they they wanted me to teach my youth and age and all this stuff and i said you know it's not
[3:17:51.720 --> 3:17:55.720]  really relevant you know i'm wasting the students money not really teaching them relevant information
[3:17:55.720 --> 3:18:00.440]  so what i did is they just on my own got rid of that section of the class and it's brainwashing you
[3:18:00.440 --> 3:18:05.800]  you you pay 30 grand a year or whatever to go be brainwashed and taught a bunch of propaganda instead
[3:18:05.800 --> 3:18:10.920]  of informant go ahead yeah yeah it's it's absolutely unbelievable that people don't just wake up and
[3:18:10.920 --> 3:18:15.320]  say what am i doing here i mean i take a calculus class we really only learn about four concepts
[3:18:15.320 --> 3:18:19.080]  the whole semester and i never use any of this stuff ever that's why i dropped out of college i
[3:18:19.080 --> 3:18:22.920]  was meant and it was like i'd go to math class and it'd be how we've got to get rid of the most
[3:18:22.920 --> 3:18:28.120]  the population guns are bad i'd go to uh you know philosophy class it was all new world order
[3:18:28.120 --> 3:18:32.040]  i'd go to texas history and all be new world order i'd go to u.s history and all be new world
[3:18:32.040 --> 3:18:36.280]  order it didn't matter what class art class it'd be new world order i mean just everywhere it's
[3:18:36.280 --> 3:18:40.600]  brainwashing yeah people don't pick up on this because they do it in a hidden way you know they
[3:18:40.600 --> 3:18:44.440]  won't some classes won't talk about eugenics so what they'll do is talk about global warming
[3:18:44.440 --> 3:18:47.880]  it'll act like everybody's in agreement and you're in it you know you get the two students
[3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:51.320]  in the back who question it and then you know all the rest of the students gang up against them it's
[3:18:51.320 --> 3:18:57.880]  just you people don't know i mean brainwashing in the university this is really reeducation camps
[3:18:57.880 --> 3:19:01.960]  they're reeducation military same thing shaved head sleep deprivation and this is people don't
[3:19:01.960 --> 3:19:06.760]  understand this is all 200 years old it all comes out of germany and england and and before
[3:19:06.760 --> 3:19:10.760]  education wasn't like this but i mean everything you're saying is true just because i've researched
[3:19:10.760 --> 3:19:13.640]  it myself that's what's great about talking to somebody else who's researched this with your
[3:19:13.640 --> 3:19:17.640]  perspective but we're gonna come back it more into your book and i'm gonna try to shut up and get
[3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:21.320]  into your uh the corporatism the secret government of the new world order it's published by webster

[3:19:37.240 --> 3:19:41.080]  being brainwashed the government schools to send them to another reeducation camp and folks when i
[3:19:41.080 --> 3:19:48.200]  see reeducation camp they are reeducation camps i mean reeducation soviet nazi system that is what
[3:19:48.200 --> 3:19:53.640]  is goes on at most universities you got some good professors and and teachers who aren't like that
[3:19:53.640 --> 3:19:59.320]  but overall it is a brainwashing mess and they try to recruit my dad into eugenics when he went to

[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:50.360]  all right let's go back to our guest jeffrey gruff jeffrey continue let's get into your book
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:57.400]  corporatism the secret government of the new world order yeah that book was written from 2003 to 2007
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:25:01.640]  i when 9 11 happened i was deep in my academic studies getting my master's degree and i really
[3:25:01.640 --> 3:25:06.680]  didn't even pay attention i actually tried as best as i could ignore all politics so i would
[3:25:06.680 --> 3:25:09.960]  ignore everything about about the world i thought it was a complete joke i didn't want to pay attention
[3:25:09.960 --> 3:25:16.520]  just wanted to my academic work but then 2003 happened march 20 or i forgot exactly the 19th
[3:25:16.520 --> 3:25:20.520]  when we invaded iraq i was sitting there in applebee's with my father having a happy little
[3:25:20.520 --> 3:25:26.200]  lunch watching people a bag that get blown to bits and that completely shocked me unbelievably and
[3:25:26.200 --> 3:25:30.680]  from that point on i've been distracted my academic work has been distracted all i can
[3:25:30.680 --> 3:25:35.400]  really focus on is what exactly is going on in the world and the book corporatism is my process
[3:25:35.400 --> 3:25:39.480]  of trying to figure out what's going on in the world and i took me four years to write i basically
[3:25:39.480 --> 3:25:44.920]  researched it you know 100 hours a week or more took to getting that book to uh be completed of
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:48.360]  course you're quoted in the book about 30 times alex playlist i've been listening to you ever
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:52.920]  since 2003 and i've you know i've been listening to uh i mean we're ultimately going to get this
[3:25:52.920 --> 3:25:56.440]  information you know i mean you guys report all this stuff i mean nobody it's really hard to find
[3:25:56.440 --> 3:26:02.040]  any other good information so um but the book is uh i think there's only one problem i think
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:05.960]  whether you know like you said the other day about the obama deception you you know after
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:08.600]  you finish something you find out things you wish you added later there's a couple things
[3:26:08.600 --> 3:26:14.440]  i wish i added later but the book basically to sum it up is about how the secret government works
[3:26:14.440 --> 3:26:20.040]  secret government is basically invisible i mean people like rocker feller and stuff um are getting
[3:26:20.040 --> 3:26:25.240]  close to the core of it but uh you know the people we see on tv what i call the visible government
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:29.800]  we're showing these people on tv you know obama you remember the election was happening and
[3:26:29.800 --> 3:26:33.160]  we were basically told who to vote for the public didn't even know who ron paul was until late in
[3:26:33.160 --> 3:26:39.000]  the game they spent billions manufacturing this guy that's prima facia evidence he's new world order
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:43.560]  then all his advisors now the policies now the betrayals i mean you know he comes out and says
[3:26:43.560 --> 3:26:49.080]  i am against these bailouts and these bonuses i'm fighting it and it turns out he specifically
[3:26:49.080 --> 3:26:55.800]  signed an executive order to allow it and had god put it in the law and that's now mainstream news
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:27:00.040]  well i knew that months ago we put it in the obama deception was just released but that's now
[3:27:00.040 --> 3:27:05.240]  mainstream news today yeah he's specific obama specifically doing the neo kind of agenda where
[3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:10.440]  you say one thing and that you're you say purposefully stay exactly the opposite of what you're
[3:27:10.440 --> 3:27:15.240]  implementing so he'll say i'm against the ag in the banks and you know go on the tv and scold them
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:18.920]  and stuff but then you know he's like you say in the bomb you show in the obama deception he's the guy
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:23.400]  behind the whole thing as far as the uh you know the puppet government goes but then behind the
[3:27:23.400 --> 3:27:28.200]  puppet government the books discusses is there's the new world order which is basically corporate
[3:27:28.200 --> 3:27:34.600]  and uh it's basically satanic government is largely invisible and it's bent on setting up a world of
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:39.560]  concentration camps that's the last chapter of the book and basically torturing and uh
[3:27:40.200 --> 3:27:44.600]  killing people for some sort of enjoyment or pleasure that they have it's sort of some sort
[3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:47.880]  of related so that's the you know that's the summation of your research which is true you
[3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:51.720]  could be an atheist and come to that realization you people like i don't believe in that i'm an
[3:27:51.720 --> 3:27:56.600]  atheist or i'm an agnostic point is the globalists believe in it i mean they are into this stuff they
[3:27:56.600 --> 3:28:01.720]  are out of their minds actually actually i used to be an atheist i even published an academic
[3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:06.840]  article in a top philosophy journal called sofia on trying to prove that god didn't exist that
[3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:11.400]  because of that way back deep into the nineties i was so angry with my upbringing and my being
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:15.560]  of a horrible church that was raised and i just became this fiery bitter atheist but
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:20.120]  i read a book in the last few years called beginning sacred design by bonnie gount and
[3:28:20.120 --> 3:28:23.800]  pretty much i can't believe that nobody's talking about this information and the churches aren't
[3:28:23.800 --> 3:28:27.800]  even that's why a lot of time well and we're gonna talk about it now but a lot of top scientists
[3:28:27.800 --> 3:28:32.600]  who have been atheist when they finally look at dna under electron microscopes and the layers
[3:28:32.600 --> 3:28:37.000]  and how there's you know in there they're like my god this is designed i mean this this is didn't
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:41.800]  come out of a cabbage patch it's everywhere look at the solar system it's when you look at the
[3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:45.960]  numbers of the sources from the diameter of the sun moon earth the ratios of all these diameters
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:50.120]  where we had to be in the galaxy where we have to be yeah go through that where we had to be
[3:28:50.120 --> 3:28:55.640]  in the galaxy it's all perfect i mean take take new grains up in ireland that that ancient temples
[3:28:55.640 --> 3:29:01.320]  about 2000 bc it's estimated to have been created the the sun and the ad i think it's the winter
[3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:07.000]  solstice there's one beam of light that channels down the center central column of the middle of
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:11.320]  the temple because these people knew so much about the sun back then so they designed it so
[3:29:11.320 --> 3:29:15.880]  right at the winter solstice the sun you know just at that one day you'd have a beam of light that
[3:29:15.880 --> 3:29:20.360]  went down because the way the temple is oriented to the sky now the thing that happens is that night
[3:29:20.360 --> 3:29:25.960]  the full moon does the exact same thing now what does that tell you that tells you that the sun and
[3:29:25.960 --> 3:29:32.200]  the moon at those specifically those very precise states are traveling exactly the same trajectory
[3:29:32.200 --> 3:29:37.320]  through the sky without any deviation now there's that can't be a coincidence that's unbelievable
[3:29:37.320 --> 3:29:42.280]  and there's i could name 20 of those coincidences when we come back now let's do if you want let's

[3:33:54.840 --> 3:33:58.280]  corporatism the secret government of the new world order but i want to he'll be on hold a few
[3:33:58.280 --> 3:34:04.440]  minutes i want to bring ted anderson up right now because every time the gold goes down and the
[3:34:04.440 --> 3:34:10.120]  graph goes like this you know it's the last five years going up but every time it dips ted buys it
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:15.000]  when it's low and then he doesn't raise the price to the current rate he passes it on to you because
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:20.440]  ted understands psychology for some of these people buy what's high i buy what's low well he passes
[3:34:20.440 --> 3:34:24.440]  that on you're buying it at the low price when it's gone up when up 30 bucks yesterday it's gone up
[3:34:24.440 --> 3:34:29.400]  like 15 today skyrocketing back upwards i don't know what the future holds but i know gold and
[3:34:29.400 --> 3:34:33.640]  silver is real i know they're devaluing the dollar they're openly talking about abandoning the dollar
[3:34:33.640 --> 3:34:40.280]  that happens you know i got articles here in fact i meant to get to 750 billion dollar green investment
[3:34:40.280 --> 3:34:45.720]  could revive economy un says they're calling for a world tax on all fuel and if you think 750
[3:34:45.720 --> 3:34:49.320]  billions big that's just how they're going to start the income tax started at 1 percent
[3:34:50.120 --> 3:34:55.880]  and wasn't widely adopted till the 50s though they passed it in 1913 so i mean this is insane
[3:34:55.880 --> 3:35:00.520]  the stuff i mean here's one in telegraph where they're talking about yesterday issuing their own
[3:35:00.520 --> 3:35:05.240]  global super currency and then another article said oh they're already doing it so ted anderson
[3:35:05.880 --> 3:35:11.160]  you've got silver you've got golden insane deals out of the gates because we always run out of time
[3:35:11.160 --> 3:35:17.080]  give folks the group of coins you're offering today at the insane price of would you buy buy this one
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:22.600]  it was down by 70 dollars yeah i don't know elix is right when the the market dipped there i took
[3:35:22.600 --> 3:35:27.560]  advantage of those low prices and now we have gold trading around 960 which is up again today
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:33.320]  hey that news that the feds going in there buying us treasuries is just driving gold up through the
[3:35:33.320 --> 3:35:38.840]  rough and then of course that means the private bankers are selling themselves treasuries taxpayer
[3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:43.960]  back the foreigners aren't buying enough of it to keep us afloat and they're moving away fast
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:47.080]  if folks don't know what that means won't you tell them to well it just means that we're
[3:35:47.080 --> 3:35:51.560]  going to see inflation i mean you think you've had an assault on your stocks and bonds and your
[3:35:51.560 --> 3:35:58.200]  401k plans and not your ira is now just wait till inflation starts coming everybody knows now
[3:35:58.200 --> 3:36:03.400]  that we're looking at some huge inflation in the future here and now they just said yesterday record
[3:36:03.400 --> 3:36:08.520]  inflation record inflation the last 20 years just came in yeah that's what everybody's pointing at
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:13.080]  right now because when the federal reserve system buys us government treasuries it means it means
[3:36:13.080 --> 3:36:18.120]  they're printing money that's what it means folks and inflation means the the dollars are
[3:36:18.120 --> 3:36:22.920]  worth less so i know this sounds stupid but some people are elementary i want to be simple here
[3:36:23.720 --> 3:36:29.320]  when there's inflation commodities especially those that have true values currency gold and silver
[3:36:29.320 --> 3:36:34.920]  historically only go up it's the most active time in trading for gold and silver that you can
[3:36:34.920 --> 3:36:41.240]  ever hope for i mean back in 1980 gold went from 40 dollars an ounce to 800 dollars an ounce in
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:47.160]  about six years and now we're we're starting at a level at about 300 and if the same movement
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:51.080]  comes along we'll be looking at four or five thousand maybe even six thousand dollar gold
[3:36:51.640 --> 3:36:57.400]  and this is this is this is the answers that our government and the federal reserve system has for us
[3:36:57.400 --> 3:37:01.560]  and and you're right the u.s trying to get away from using the united states currency
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:07.000]  as a world reserve currency that's going to kill us we have to have foreigners buying our debt in
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:12.360]  order to survive this is a slow slide into depression but if the dollar gets dumped which
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:18.440]  is openly being discussed it will be an overnight crash well alex when i was up in the air just at
[3:37:18.440 --> 3:37:24.440]  the very end of the show yesterday i i told you i had some deals in here i have frank still i have
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:29.400]  same price i had him yesterday even though gold is up again so much today i have frank still from
[3:37:29.400 --> 3:37:35.560]  the time when gold was sitting here at its bottom at 218 i've got british sovereigns at 272
[3:37:35.560 --> 3:37:42.760]  silvers up i still have the frank the the franklin halves at 869 a piece or 173 per roll of 20 and
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:48.200]  i have some of the u.s eagles and some of the you know the various different coins that you can
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:51.800]  find in the gold market you have to ask for those because i just don't have enough quantities to go
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:59.880]  out we have 20 dollar gold pieces and tens just you know call 1-800-686-2237 and take advantage
[3:37:59.880 --> 3:38:05.080]  of this the market is going up right now and it'll continue to go up as the fed steps in
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:10.040]  and inflates away of the you know they're trying to they're trying to deficit spend our way you
[3:38:10.040 --> 3:38:14.440]  know our way out of our problems and explain to people what's going on you have gold it
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:20.600]  is it 60 or 70 dollars under what it's currently so that's the thing alex it was what round 890
[3:38:20.600 --> 3:38:25.880]  when it hit its low here last time that's a 70 dollar under buy you made you're passing those
[3:38:25.880 --> 3:38:30.840]  shavings on you cannot beat this deal tell them the coin's dead yeah again the frank coin right
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:39.960]  now is at 218 the sovereign coin right now is a 272 the franklin uh the franklin half is right now
[3:38:39.960 --> 3:38:45.320]  at 869 that's a silver coin i mean people should be buying gold and silver right now inflation is
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:49.720]  going to throw it push this stuff up through the rough and the silver coin is eight dollars
[3:38:49.720 --> 3:38:53.880]  and 80 something cents cannot beat i mean silver dollars you can find them are over 20
[3:38:53.880 --> 3:38:57.880]  dollars a piece ted i know it's they've been trading for more than 20 dollars here for
[3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:01.960]  a almost the last year every now and then you're lucky to get something for 18
[3:39:02.520 --> 3:39:07.480]  you know and here this thing is eight dollars and 69 cents i mean it is really a good buy
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:20.600]  it is 800 686 2237 1800 give them the number folks yeah 1800 686 2237 again it's 1800 686
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:26.040]  2237 man pull your head out of the sand get as much gold and silver as you can at this time
[3:39:26.040 --> 3:39:32.200]  i can't say that enough it's not just 100 1800 686 237 did you hear that state police officer
[3:39:32.200 --> 3:39:37.000]  who broke the myack report here on last hour and he said he said alex you told me go the stock market
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:41.560]  two and a half years ago at the top i did it you told me go to my house two and a half years ago i
[3:39:41.560 --> 3:39:45.480]  did it i've made hundreds of thousands of dollars everybody else you know is losing their butt in
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:50.360]  his uh state police office he's senior uh and he told them all then and they laughed now they're
[3:39:50.360 --> 3:39:55.080]  listening you know told them to get into gold they did did well is gold perfect the globalists
[3:39:55.080 --> 3:40:00.440]  can manipulate things but they can't do it for long and historically there is not a better investment
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:05.640]  than gold and silver you are insane if you don't convert a lot of your liquid cash or stocks and
[3:40:05.640 --> 3:40:10.600]  bonds into gold and silver i can't say it better than that alex at this time if you're sitting
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:16.920]  in annuity stocks bonds mutual funds you have 401k's ira is you should be calling us at 1800
[3:40:16.920 --> 3:40:23.960]  686 2237 the only excuses is that you're out of paper currency you don't have anymore i just
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:29.160]  don't i i can't say it enough the united states dollars under attack and you better do something
[3:40:29.160 --> 3:40:35.560]  about it and if you can't see the tidal wave coming you're going to get drowned 800 686
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:41.800]  237 and when i was first telling folks to get gold it was 280 dollars 267 dollars an ounce and
[3:40:41.800 --> 3:40:46.120]  it's been above a thousand it's going back that way now and Ted's selling it to you at the 8
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:51.080]  890 level so i mean you do the math he's selling at the 890 level you know he has his tiny markup
[3:40:51.080 --> 3:40:58.920]  in there and things he's selling to you at the 890 level when it's when it's uh 960 800 686 2237

[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:42.680]  minutes let's go back to jeffrey grub jeffrey please continue with your research of how the real
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:46.920]  government the shadow government works in your book corporatism the secret government of the new
[3:41:46.920 --> 3:41:52.600]  world order available from progressive press dot com progressive press dot com go ahead
[3:41:53.480 --> 3:41:58.040]  okay and before i end the show alex i gotta read you a samuel adams quote about the second
[3:41:58.040 --> 3:42:03.320]  amendment an al-qaeda quote oh you're gonna mention a terrorist on my show okay go ahead i guess i mean
[3:42:03.880 --> 3:42:09.080]  can i read that right now read the terrorist yes okay this is specifically in reference to um
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:14.120]  you know obama say any you know the all these uh government people saying uh no you can own a gun
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:17.720]  but we just want to restrict it blah blah blah you know they want to put they want to take control
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:21.960]  over it and certify you know it's like a certification you know when you have a certification over
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:25.320]  something like organic food or whatever the government can come in and control it basically
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:30.760]  so it turns right into a privilege you know go ahead yeah so here's samuel adams among the natural
[3:42:30.760 --> 3:42:36.760]  rights of the colonists are these first the right to life secondly a life or to liberty
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:41.400]  thirdly to property together with the right to support and defend them if you were to
[3:42:41.400 --> 3:42:46.280]  defend them in the best manner they can okay the key to that quote is the best manner they can now
[3:42:46.280 --> 3:42:51.800]  what that means is if if it's best for us to defend our property in pursuit of happiness
[3:42:51.800 --> 3:42:57.000]  with an ar-15 which of course uses 223 most of the time then that's what we should that's specifically
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:43:02.120]  what we should use according to this funny this key founding father so when somebody like obama
[3:43:02.120 --> 3:43:07.880]  says that oh no we want to restrict something like 223 ammo they're breaking the law they the people
[3:43:07.880 --> 3:43:13.240]  should act accordingly to what they're doing and basically not cooperate we should perform civil
[3:43:13.240 --> 3:43:18.920]  disobedience against this uh administration in every way that which is what i think is the best
[3:43:18.920 --> 3:43:23.640]  way to uh eliminate these people but that comes from i'm reading out of a book called the second
[3:43:23.640 --> 3:43:28.520]  amendment by david barton that's page 24 and then he's got the site the reference in there exactly
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:34.520]  where isn't no i know that quote i know it well your website by the way is abstract adam dot com
[3:43:34.520 --> 3:43:38.920]  abstract adam dot com please continue yeah that website is mostly just my academic work
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:42.600]  there's probably not a whole lot that um it's probably not what the listeners are thinking
[3:43:42.600 --> 3:43:47.400]  is just basically an academic site but i continue not um let me tell you another story about what
[3:43:47.400 --> 3:43:51.720]  happened at um pretty essential i think you really like this one this is different than the
[3:43:51.720 --> 3:43:55.400]  story of trying to forget and take my gun out of my stuff when i entered the prison that
[3:43:55.400 --> 3:44:01.080]  i was teaching at um but this that happened last summer i was uh teaching ethics class
[3:44:01.080 --> 3:44:04.600]  and you know these ethics classes in college you know it's just a lot of fluff you can get the
[3:44:04.600 --> 3:44:07.720]  concepts over pretty easy so you got to fill it in with interesting concepts in the meantime so
[3:44:07.720 --> 3:44:11.720]  of course i'm bringing up the second amendment all the time but a couple days into the class we
[3:44:11.720 --> 3:44:15.560]  were talking about evolution before that you know i was talking about how it's just the theory and
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:20.200]  you know really that the uh a lot of the the research they say out there that improves evolution
[3:44:20.200 --> 3:44:23.480]  is just a joke you know these four million-year-old bones how do we know those are connected to our
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:29.560]  lineage and you know they say that there is um all this evidence in the junk dna of the retroviruses
[3:44:29.560 --> 3:44:36.040]  to uh show that we've got the exact example i want to be clear about this the way the phony
[3:44:36.040 --> 3:44:41.560]  churches have made the debate i think is unscientific too and not in the bible uh you know claiming
[3:44:41.560 --> 3:44:45.960]  you know things are you know however many years old i mean clearly i believe we have an old earth
[3:44:45.960 --> 3:44:51.400]  you know it bible talks about creations before that regardless of that uh they you know they try
[3:44:51.400 --> 3:44:57.560]  to set all religion or spirituality against science when the science is showing that there
[3:44:57.560 --> 3:45:02.200]  is a master builder but go ahead yeah we can go look at a fossil record it seems like there's
[3:45:02.200 --> 3:45:05.800]  something you know step by step going on through the millions years the problem is it's trying to
[3:45:05.800 --> 3:45:10.520]  say that we come from a ape there that's where they have these are separate arms these are separate
[3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:16.120]  arms of development you know you don't have a fish turning into a human or you don't have a chimpanzee
[3:45:16.120 --> 3:45:21.240]  turning into a human these are separate divergent they have the continual fossil record that doesn't
[3:45:21.240 --> 3:45:28.200]  have you know uh these connections if there's these massive jumps like overnight go ahead
[3:45:29.080 --> 3:45:33.000]  yeah exactly called punctuated equilibrium this gradual evolution that darwin before it
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:36.200]  doesn't really exist in the fossil record that's actually pretty mainstream among
[3:45:36.200 --> 3:45:40.120]  biologists and stuff these days but anyways i was trying to i was discussing that with students
[3:45:40.120 --> 3:45:43.800]  and i was trying to you know be empirical i possibly could bring up both sides of story
[3:45:43.800 --> 3:45:47.560]  and saying you know i don't really know and just the evidence for us coming from chimps is not there
[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:53.560]  so i had a couple students just absolutely i mean they could just feel their anger from the front
[3:45:53.560 --> 3:45:57.880]  of the room they were just expecting you were committing heresy against the eugenicist religion
[3:45:58.440 --> 3:46:02.040]  exactly yeah i was i was trying you know i was basically making it look like humans were
[3:46:02.040 --> 3:46:06.200]  not stupid animals but were actually powerful spiritual creatures by doing that which goes
[3:46:06.200 --> 3:46:11.000]  against that whole eugenics program so then the next class um you know to fill in time we brought
[3:46:11.000 --> 3:46:14.680]  up some controversial issues to bring up to illustrate the concepts and philosophical ethics
[3:46:14.680 --> 3:46:18.520]  and those were the second amendment of course i'm always itching to bring up second minutes my favorite
[3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:23.080]  saying that my favorite thing in the world besides reading it is guns i mean just the freedom that
[3:46:23.080 --> 3:46:27.800]  carrying a gun gives you is thomas jefferson said he just can't it's just second to none that feeling
[3:46:27.800 --> 3:46:34.120]  but anyways um the uh so i started talking i had this incredible handout for the students i've got
[3:46:34.120 --> 3:46:37.320]  it right in front of me here it's called a lesson of the second amendment just incredibly well
[3:46:37.320 --> 3:46:41.880]  documented you know about a hundred foot notes on the thing and so forth and now we were just going
[3:46:41.880 --> 3:46:46.120]  through it and all of a sudden okay that lasted about it you know 40 minutes and then we moved
[3:46:46.120 --> 3:46:49.000]  down to the next concept there's a topic in the class and then all of a sudden there's a bunch of
[3:46:49.000 --> 3:46:53.640]  police outside the classroom door and i'm like okay that's strange what i just kept teaching
[3:46:53.640 --> 3:46:57.720]  but all of a sudden a guy in plainclones motion to me to come out of the room and i get out there
[3:46:57.720 --> 3:47:02.280]  and there's always you know cops out in the hallway they said uh we got a phone call that
[3:47:02.280 --> 3:47:06.120]  you're carrying a gun in your pocket which of course i wasn't because i've been too afraid to
[3:47:06.120 --> 3:47:10.600]  of course carry it's a felony if you use the anti-second so just talking about the second
[3:47:10.600 --> 3:47:16.280]  amendment police came it was uh well it turns out it turns out i found out from other students
[3:47:16.280 --> 3:47:21.160]  that that student brag one of the students that was so angry at me for just simply questioning
[3:47:21.160 --> 3:47:25.480]  and using empirical evidence to question the theory of monkeys coming turning into humans
[3:47:25.480 --> 3:47:30.600]  through um evolution one of them called their mother text their mother and said i had a gun
[3:47:30.600 --> 3:47:35.080]  in my pocket and then the police came so it was basically a student of that because they were just
[3:47:35.080 --> 3:47:41.400]  so angry of well that's what these uh fake intellectuals do is is they try to shut down
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:46.200]  free speech by false reports whatever they can because it just i mean i mean i mean if your
[3:47:46.200 --> 3:47:50.280]  information is so powerful and so true you should want to defend it it's kind of like
[3:47:50.280 --> 3:47:54.120]  you know tens of thousands of people they've grabbed over the years and say they can't have
[3:47:54.120 --> 3:47:58.520]  court trials with the enemy combatants act and and and the military commissions act
[3:47:58.520 --> 3:48:02.920]  i mean if these are really terrorist and we've got proof let's see it but see that they always
[3:48:02.920 --> 3:48:07.720]  want to do everything you do in secret and they don't want to allow any debate well the whole
[3:48:08.280 --> 3:48:13.000]  you know war on terror and you know okay and everything if the people are close there's no
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:17.480]  evidence for anything i mean if i should see a videotape on tv over some below that's strictly
[3:48:17.480 --> 3:48:22.280]  speaking in the scientific sense not evidence that's nothing because i mean well it's turned out
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:27.480]  those videos are old videos re-edited that's been confirmed and fake videos i mean they've
[3:48:27.480 --> 3:48:32.280]  they put they've put the classic morph computer head up you know with the one with him in the room
[3:48:32.280 --> 3:48:37.480]  i mean they put out admitted fake videos yeah i mean the dinosaurs and Jurassic Park sure to
[3:48:37.480 --> 3:48:41.640]  look real i mean but of course they're fake but i mean anybody can make ends with kennedy
[3:48:42.440 --> 3:48:49.480]  exactly yeah good one but the um the i forgot i was gonna say i'm good at that
[3:48:50.360 --> 3:48:54.280]  no no no i mean we're going through they came after you for having supposedly a gun you didn't
[3:48:54.280 --> 3:48:58.200]  have one how did that happen oh yeah we were talking about yeah that nothing of the war on
[3:48:58.200 --> 3:49:02.360]  terror is verified but even americans are trained to just believe whatever they want and you know
[3:49:02.360 --> 3:49:06.120]  not really just go look for evidence that the real if you really want to get real information
[3:49:06.120 --> 3:49:09.640]  about the world that is not about the spiritual domain but about the world you need to use your
[3:49:09.640 --> 3:49:13.720]  senses that's what science is based on but people don't know to do that so then they can put on tv
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:17.320]  all this stuff about how you know there's this boogeyman here this boogeyman there nobody asks
[3:49:17.320 --> 3:49:21.400]  for the verification for the evidence people just believe it and then you get this whole
[3:49:21.400 --> 3:49:25.800]  apparatus of society basically everybody telling each other the why that's out of orwell you know
[3:49:25.800 --> 3:49:29.720]  everybody tells you to lie nobody knows the truth so you see it on tv and then you go to work and
[3:49:29.720 --> 3:49:33.960]  talk about what's on tv and you talk about it at church and you talk about it at so feedback loop
[3:49:34.680 --> 3:49:38.840]  yeah and it's just always lie lie lie lie and then when somebody comes along and says oh hey
[3:49:38.840 --> 3:49:43.160]  diet coke isn't healthy it has aspartame everybody says i can't believe that nobody believes that
[3:49:43.160 --> 3:49:47.720]  you're crazy everybody drinks it it could never be and now they've gotten to the point of when we
[3:49:47.720 --> 3:49:52.840]  prove mercury's in the food and the shots they go okay mercury's good and we prove melamine's in
[3:49:52.840 --> 3:49:57.560]  the formula and they go okay we've always said it's deadly it's good for you mercury melamine
[3:49:57.560 --> 3:50:02.040]  lad it's all good now yeah but the denial is just so unbelievable just like that police officer you
[3:50:02.040 --> 3:50:06.280]  had on last uh an hour or whatever ago i've had the same thing happened to me when i started

[3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:23.000]  quick i'm like 20 coincidences are just getting lucky that's what they say about um all the predictions

[3:55:45.560 --> 3:55:50.040]  word on any other issues you'd like to cover okay that's great because i got something big i want
[3:55:50.040 --> 3:55:55.080]  to say um i want to call into your show for a couple months say this uh you i think you're
[3:55:55.080 --> 3:55:58.840]  out of this alex and probably a lot of listeners are too but i would just want to say that i think
[3:55:58.840 --> 3:56:03.400]  that it's beyond a shadow of doubt to me that the new world order is now using our movement to carry
[3:56:03.400 --> 3:56:07.960]  out their agenda i don't when i you know like i heard um chuck balvin an hour one talking about
[3:56:07.960 --> 3:56:12.680]  rush limbaugh is talking about the missouri issues and stuff and all of a sudden glenn becker their
[3:56:12.680 --> 3:56:18.680]  friend and having ron paul's i mean i don't these these people have been the most unwavering
[3:56:18.680 --> 3:56:24.280]  traders all acting in unison for what decades and now all of a sudden they're disposing of
[3:56:24.280 --> 3:56:27.320]  this information i don't buy it for one second there's a lot of other reasons why i don't buy it
[3:56:27.320 --> 3:56:31.800]  either they're i think that what the new world order is doing this stuff's getting too big you're
[3:56:31.800 --> 3:56:37.080]  getting too big if the everybody's waking up so what they're going to do is basically use the
[3:56:37.080 --> 3:56:41.720]  movement to carry out their ends you know i mean i think we're gonna try they're gonna try to co-op
[3:56:41.720 --> 3:56:46.520]  to get people's confidence but be specific what are you what are you hitting out here well i think
[3:56:46.520 --> 3:56:50.200]  i mean look they're they're gonna try to ban gardening i mean that reminds me of in robin who
[3:56:50.200 --> 3:56:54.600]  when they banned the book robin who they banned like oh you're saying they want to cause a revolution
[3:56:54.600 --> 3:56:58.920]  yeah they want they want rise they want to burn this place down oh i agree with you but we need
[3:56:58.920 --> 3:57:03.240]  to we need to expose that as well because that's what i mean i mean they're gonna they're gonna
[3:57:03.240 --> 3:57:07.960]  put in their own guys to for this revolution and you know they're gonna have them their other guys
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:11.320]  waiting on the other side after they destroy the old world to set up their new world that they're
[3:57:11.320 --> 3:57:16.600]  they want i mean think about their they're doing crazy things they're all this foreclosure and
[3:57:16.600 --> 3:57:22.120]  inflation and homelessness and gun laws and banning gardening it they're people can't pay these
