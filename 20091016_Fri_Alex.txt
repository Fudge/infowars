[00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:09.687]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.687 --> 00:00:11.288]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:12.830]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.012]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.012 --> 00:00:21.095]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:36.814]  Yeah.
[00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:47.270]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this October 16th, Friday edition 2009.
[00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.033]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:57.477]  And yes, we're going to have open phones on any issue or news item or subject or question or comment you have for me.
[00:00:57.477 --> 00:00:59.999]  If you disagree, agree, whatever the case is, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:00.139]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:01.960]  We will get you up and on the air.
[00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:29.736]  Oh boy, I got eight hours sleep last night after coming in and getting three and a half hours sleep from Los Angeles Wednesday night and I am feeling good and that's important because I need all my energy to cover the incredibly important news and information that I have here in front of myself today.
[00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:34.237]  Bob Chapman will be popping in coming up in the third hour with his Once a Week Friday
[00:01:35.297 --> 00:01:42.640]  Information on the economy, the plunging dollar, and now the consensus appears to be set even in the mainstream media.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.842]  The dollar is dying and will expire in the next few years.
[00:01:46.842 --> 00:01:54.304]  A long, slow process of death or will it be a quick transformation and what will be left when the dollar is gone?
[00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:55.585]  The new world order.
[00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:58.586]  The new global SDR currency.
[00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.687]  It is all coming up today with Bob Chapman.
[00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:07.146]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, here is the stack of news I have in front of me.
[00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:12.330]  And no, we're not going to be talking about the Colorado balloon family and what appears to be a hoax.
[00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:15.044]  By the wife swappers.
[00:02:15.044 --> 00:02:16.925]  Yes, they're the stars of that show.
[00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:20.949]  We're not going to be talking about that or Rush Limbaugh dropping the bid for the Rams.
[00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:27.234]  We're going to be talking about issues that actually affect all of us on this planet and are issues in many cases of life and death.
[00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:33.719]  Certainly the life and death of the freedom in this nation and our constitutional republic and freedom worldwide.
[00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:39.498]  Government propaganda to infest network TV shows.
[00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:41.239]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.001]  We have internal Entertainment Industry Foundation memos.
[00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:59.587]  This is nothing new, but it is a massive expansion of propaganda placement, government messages, subliminals, you name it, in TV, in national radio, and in print, as well as the schools.
[00:02:59.587 --> 00:03:00.688]  We'll be going over that.
[00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:16.280]  Also on the environmental front, fresh off signing a bill to make you thumbprint and register to buy ammo in California to set a national and worldwide precedent, Schwarzenegger is set to ban big screen TVs over 40 inches.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.842]  But of course, it's really a carbon tax.
[00:03:18.842 --> 00:03:23.005]  It is beginning, saying it's bad for the environment, uses too much energy.
[00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:26.772]  We'll be breaking that down today.
[00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:31.373]  Members of the European Union Parliament call for compulsory EU lessons in schools.
[00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:38.895]  They're calling for school pupils to be forced to take European Union lessons to counter lies about the European Union government.
[00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:42.176]  Total government brainwashing by the EU of the children.
[00:03:42.176 --> 00:03:44.537]  It's already going on, but now they mean to make it law.
[00:03:45.077 --> 00:03:50.763]  Treasury officials received millions from Goldman Sachs bailout money that Treasury controlled.
[00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.225]  Absolute criminality and conflict of interest.
[00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:54.366]  We'll be covering it.
[00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:57.209]  Big development on the 9-11 truth front.
[00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:06.177]  Danish Prime Minister was told in his Security Council that WTC would collapse five to ten minutes before it collapsed.
[00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:10.195]  Just like Rudolph Giuliani said and then tried to recant.
[00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:16.079]  Just like they said Building 7 would fall before it fell and put out the exact way it did fall 25 minutes before.
[00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.663]  Then it turned out it was Reuters with a false start report with all of the scripting of 9-11.
[00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:23.964]  This is a huge development.
[00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:27.086]  It integrates in with all the other important news.
[00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:29.148]  Well, a high-level corporate executive
[00:04:30.472 --> 00:04:35.095]  Got up and was tired and walked in front of someone out of his seat.
[00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:38.877]  He's being charged under the Patriot Act as a terrorist.
[00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:40.198]  The total tyranny there.
[00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:43.960]  The FBI said he made an ugly face as well.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.983]  He's facing 20 years in federal prison as a terrorist.
[00:04:47.983 --> 00:04:51.725]  I'm not kidding, this is Politico reporting this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.264]  We'll also get into a host of other economic news and a Louisiana couple was refused a marriage license.
[00:05:00.264 --> 00:05:07.989]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:16.754]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks and we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:17.034 --> 00:05:23.322]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:27.388]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:32.755]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:35.077]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:36.838]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:39.360]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.084]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:44.084 --> 00:05:47.786]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.786 --> 00:05:50.929]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:52.810]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.932]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:06:01.224 --> 00:06:07.267]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:13.151]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:19.294]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:21.594]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.594 --> 00:06:24.055]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:37.257]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.257 --> 00:06:38.918]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.918 --> 00:06:40.778]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.778 --> 00:06:47.019]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:55.948]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:57.528]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.528 --> 00:07:00.429]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:03.390]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:05.142]  I think so.
[00:07:22.312 --> 00:07:22.672]  I think so.
[00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:55.340]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:02.007]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[00:08:02.007 --> 00:08:08.654]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:11.617]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:43.337]  My friends, there is an article in Politico today that we have linked up at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com that really crystallizes and highlights everything I'm talking about.
[00:08:43.337 --> 00:08:54.584]  Every week or two, I see articles about a woman or a man, but generally it's women, who will argue with a flight attendant, generally a female flight attendant,
[00:08:56.243 --> 00:08:58.405]  I just noticed this pattern.
[00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:04.629]  And for arguing or yelling back and forth, they are charged under the Patriot Act.
[00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:08.552]  And we've had their lawyers many times over the years here on the show.
[00:09:08.552 --> 00:09:10.513]  This has been going on for about seven years.
[00:09:10.513 --> 00:09:14.416]  It didn't start until about a year after they passed the Patriot Act in October of 2001.
[00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:14.676]  Per state,
[00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:37.006]  Tens of thousands of people are charged per year under Patriot Act provisions for marijuana, for car theft, for child abuse, and the charges are many times stronger, have longer prison sentences.
[00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:39.108]  It's amazing.
[00:09:39.108 --> 00:09:43.292]  But this gentleman in the Politico story,
[00:09:45.994 --> 00:09:49.115]  is a high-powered executive, no criminal record.
[00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:59.018]  David Bass is known in Washington as an accomplished PR executive and TV commentator, a man with impressive rolodex and a fixture of the DC social scene.
[00:09:59.018 --> 00:10:12.562]  Or at least he was until Thursday when word spread through the town that Bass had been charged with a federal felony for loutish behavior on a Continental Airlines flight from Houston to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
[00:10:12.562 --> 00:10:13.602]  An FBI agent
[00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:29.017]  And a couple of flight attendants say in court documents that Bass seemed drunk on the flight, disobeying instructions from crew, climbing over another passenger to get to the overhead luggage bin, making mean faces and generally upsetting everyone in first class.
[00:10:29.017 --> 00:10:31.699]  And I have the affidavit.
[00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:37.363]  And they say he got up in first class while the person was sleeping.
[00:10:37.363 --> 00:10:39.684]  I've done this in coach many times.
[00:10:39.684 --> 00:10:40.725]  You don't want to wake them up.
[00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:41.606]  You squeeze past them.
[00:10:44.255 --> 00:10:48.397]  I squeezed past Wednesday night the guy next to me.
[00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:49.777]  I thought that was nice.
[00:10:49.777 --> 00:10:53.358]  They're charging him with a felony for that.
[00:10:53.358 --> 00:10:57.760]  The stewardess ran up and yelled at him and said, get back in your seat.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.781]  And they said that he seemed non-responsive.
[00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:05.403]  And he said, yes, I had flown from South America.
[00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:08.024]  There had been horrible layovers.
[00:11:08.024 --> 00:11:13.206]  He said that he had taken Benadryl for allergies and he was out of it.
[00:11:14.229 --> 00:11:20.532]  They then said, we're going to charge you under the Patriot Act for being drunk, because any misdemeanor under the Patriot Act is an act of terrorism.
[00:11:20.532 --> 00:11:27.056]  Section 802, any action that endangers human life is a violation of any federal or state law.
[00:11:27.056 --> 00:11:34.460]  And they say in the affidavit, when it landed at Ronald Reagan Airport, they pulled him off.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.680]  He said, look, I'm not drunk.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.762]  I haven't been drinking.
[00:11:37.762 --> 00:11:42.024]  I've been on airplanes or in airports for 30 hours getting back to the United States.
[00:11:45.191 --> 00:11:49.435]  And I was asleep, and I got up to go to the bathroom.
[00:11:49.435 --> 00:11:52.078]  And you can take my blood, I haven't even been drinking.
[00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:54.200]  I'm totally exhausted.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.263]  And they said, we're sorry, we're charging you with a felony.
[00:11:57.263 --> 00:11:58.524]  20 years in prison.
[00:11:58.524 --> 00:12:00.426]  And that's in the article.
[00:12:00.426 --> 00:12:01.066]  20 years!
[00:12:01.066 --> 00:12:02.628]  No criminal record!
[00:12:02.628 --> 00:12:07.873]  And it says, because he got up, not when the no standing signs were on,
[00:12:09.232 --> 00:12:25.695]  He got up, squeezed past the person, they complained, the stewardess ninnied around, flight attendant, I may be arrested for violating hate speech now, ninnied around, and moved the other first class person because they complained that he squeezed past him, and
[00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:28.322]  They admit he didn't even argue with him.
[00:12:28.322 --> 00:12:32.583]  They said he was non-responsive when they talked to him and made a mean face.
[00:12:32.583 --> 00:12:33.944]  That's in the affidavit.
[00:12:33.944 --> 00:12:36.785]  Made a mean face.
[00:12:36.785 --> 00:12:47.770]  So for getting up and stepping in front of the person and for them complaining and then for him making a mean face, he is charged as a terrorist.
[00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.591]  His life is over.
[00:12:49.591 --> 00:12:52.432]  They get convictions for these every week or so.
[00:12:53.553 --> 00:12:58.075]  Over the years, I don't know, I've probably had more, I don't know, more than ten.
[00:12:58.075 --> 00:13:00.016]  I've had a couple on this year.
[00:13:00.016 --> 00:13:01.317]  They're lawyers on.
[00:13:01.317 --> 00:13:06.039]  Where, you know, in some cases they'll yell back, or they'll scream, or they'll cuss.
[00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:09.701]  In one case, the lady dropped her drink.
[00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:11.502]  They said that was throwing the drink.
[00:13:11.502 --> 00:13:13.323]  But, but, but, and they charge him with the same thing.
[00:13:13.323 --> 00:13:18.825]  But this time, it's just making a mean face.
[00:13:18.825 --> 00:13:20.106]  Because they admit he didn't even argue.
[00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.051]  They said he was unresponsive.
[00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:23.572]  He said, yeah, I was on Benadryl.
[00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:28.135]  I woke up to go to the bathroom.
[00:13:28.135 --> 00:13:35.239]  And ladies and gentlemen, I mean, what's crazy about this is I get to the LAX Wednesday night.
[00:13:35.239 --> 00:13:38.121]  My flight's supposed to leave at six.
[00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:38.661]  I get there about 445.
[00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:46.444]  Ventura invited me out to a late lunch, but I couldn't go.
[00:13:46.444 --> 00:13:50.346]  I wanted to get back early, so I'd set an early flight, told them an early time.
[00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:51.206]  I get there.
[00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:52.287]  I'm sitting there at the airport.
[00:13:52.287 --> 00:13:56.229]  It takes off at 1030 at night, which is not that bad of a layover.
[00:13:56.229 --> 00:13:59.670]  They had a bunch of storms and mechanical problems, but we took off at 1030.
[00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.792]  I got home at 230 and got home, you know, past three.
[00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:08.634]  But on the plane, I finally fell asleep about 30 minutes out from Austin.
[00:14:11.127 --> 00:14:20.491]  And I had the tray down in front of me and the empty glass that had some ice in it from some orange juice I'd had.
[00:14:20.491 --> 00:14:27.855]  And I had just gotten the orange juice in a three-hour flight, never talked to the flight attendant after that.
[00:14:27.855 --> 00:14:28.935]  I fell asleep.
[00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:37.299]  The captain had announced they were making the descent, I guess, and suddenly a woman is leaning over me saying, I said, tray up!
[00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:38.280]  Give me your glass!
[00:14:40.888 --> 00:14:49.992]  And because I was sitting next to the window and I was half asleep and I took me a second and I handed it to her and she was glaring at me with hatred.
[00:14:49.992 --> 00:14:52.212]  And anyone who's flown a lot has experienced this.
[00:14:52.212 --> 00:14:55.494]  A lot of times the flight attendants are nice.
[00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:58.735]  It seems though women are either nicer or meaner.
[00:14:58.735 --> 00:15:02.236]  I've never had a male flight attendant be mean.
[00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:04.277]  But maybe that's just statistic because less of them are male.
[00:15:08.644 --> 00:15:11.505]  But I have seen them really blow up at people.
[00:15:11.505 --> 00:15:15.347]  I've seen them really get aggressive.
[00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:18.428]  I've seen them yell at people whose kids are crying.
[00:15:18.428 --> 00:15:27.852]  Flight attendants have gotten in trouble before and charged under the Patriot Act themselves for ordering people to give Benadryl to their children.
[00:15:27.852 --> 00:15:29.592]  They bring them liquid Benadryl.
[00:15:29.592 --> 00:15:32.634]  I guess that's like an inside deal they do because I've seen multiple cases of it.
[00:15:32.634 --> 00:15:36.895]  And order parents to give the crying child Benadryl because they don't want to hear it.
[00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:37.916]  You know, they're getting paid
[00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:42.624]  I guess $12, $14, $15 an hour.
[00:15:42.624 --> 00:15:45.571]  It's not minimum wage, but they're not getting paid a lot.
[00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:49.317]  They fly them all over the country and the world.
[00:15:49.317 --> 00:15:50.057]  They get angry.
[00:15:50.057 --> 00:15:50.777]  They get upset.
[00:15:50.777 --> 00:15:52.178]  They get frustrated.
[00:15:52.178 --> 00:15:54.878]  It's the wrong time of the month, whatever the reasons are.
[00:15:54.878 --> 00:15:56.499]  And they just blow up at people.
[00:15:56.499 --> 00:15:57.679]  They've got an attitude problem.
[00:15:57.679 --> 00:16:00.880]  Look, I don't make you work for American Airlines.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.681]  I don't make you work for Delta or United or whatever the... I don't make you work for Qantas.
[00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:09.402]  I don't make you work for Continental.
[00:16:09.402 --> 00:16:11.923]  I mean, I'm not the one that made you have this job.
[00:16:11.923 --> 00:16:13.603]  I'm not being rude to you.
[00:16:13.603 --> 00:16:14.784]  Why are you being rude to me?
[00:16:14.784 --> 00:16:15.884]  But that's a whole other issue.
[00:16:19.352 --> 00:16:26.799]  If you've seen the movie Anger Management, it's a pretty good movie where the guy's not even arguing and the air marshal gets up and tasers him.
[00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:30.783]  That is based on real cases.
[00:16:30.783 --> 00:16:34.507]  I mean, they routinely taser people for just being screamed at.
[00:16:34.507 --> 00:16:36.529]  If you argue back, they will attack you.
[00:16:48.157 --> 00:16:57.065]  So David Bass is known in Washington as an accomplished PR executive and TV commentator, a man with an impressive Rolodex, and a fixture on the DC social scene.
[00:16:57.065 --> 00:17:02.791]  Bass said he was tired and out of it on allergy medication and doesn't even know what a mean face is.
[00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:14.237]  And he's being charged with climbing over another passenger to get to the overhead luggage bin, making mean faces, and generally upsetting everyone in first class.
[00:17:14.237 --> 00:17:17.199]  And it's not just the flight attendants that are ninnies.
[00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:20.922]  Same thing happened to me Wednesday night.
[00:17:20.922 --> 00:17:23.063]  Everybody's jumping up, cramming through.
[00:17:23.063 --> 00:17:28.628]  I just try to get between a guy and a lady to get my bag when it's my time to go.
[00:17:30.908 --> 00:17:33.792]  And this business guy in a business suit goes, okay.
[00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:36.094]  Cause I reached up to get my heavy bag.
[00:17:36.094 --> 00:17:38.557]  Everything was crammed in it, including cameras and stuff.
[00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:43.043]  And I'm pulling it out and it kind of dropped a little, didn't hit anybody.
[00:17:43.043 --> 00:17:44.485]  And he goes, Oh, okay.
[00:17:44.485 --> 00:17:46.768]  Ooh, it's just a nation of ninnies.
[00:17:48.615 --> 00:17:52.798]  Bass says he was tired, out of it on allergy medication, doesn't even know what a mean face is.
[00:17:52.798 --> 00:17:53.318]  That's in there.
[00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:55.179]  He's charged with making a mean face.
[00:17:55.179 --> 00:18:02.244]  And his friends say that the allegations against him, punishable by as much as 20 years in federal prison, don't sound like Bass at all.
[00:18:02.244 --> 00:18:05.566]  Yeah, he's known as a charming, smooth operator, goes on to say.
[00:18:05.566 --> 00:18:09.028]  It runs contrary to my 20 years of knowing him here.
[00:18:09.028 --> 00:18:16.873]  His behavior described as aggressive and confrontational, said Nick Sweeney, advertising director at the Weekly Standard, where Bass was formerly the deputy publisher.
[00:18:19.073 --> 00:18:20.774]  So he's an insider, folks.
[00:18:20.774 --> 00:18:22.815]  A globalist.
[00:18:22.815 --> 00:18:25.376]  Added Weekly Standard writer Matt Labash.
[00:18:25.376 --> 00:18:29.457]  Bass is proclaiming his innocence because he thinks he is.
[00:18:29.457 --> 00:18:33.519]  Obviously, everybody... See, no one's saying this is in crazy police state.
[00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:34.720]  It's like, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.920]  I didn't mean to make a mean face.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.942]  Please don't put me in federal prison as a terrorist.
[00:18:39.942 --> 00:18:44.984]  Obviously, everybody takes any airplane shenanigans very seriously these days.
[00:18:44.984 --> 00:18:46.785]  Oh, yes, because we've got to arrest somebody.
[00:18:48.237 --> 00:18:55.861]  But threatening a guy with 20 years in jail because you don't like his facial expressions when you deny him service seems a bit extreme.
[00:18:55.861 --> 00:19:02.505]  In an interview with Politico on Thursday, Bass said, the last thing I would ever be is a threat to anyone on a plane.
[00:19:02.505 --> 00:19:04.706]  He said, his PR clients know me as better than this.
[00:19:04.706 --> 00:19:08.969]  My friends would probably say Bass was joking a little more than he should have been.
[00:19:11.553 --> 00:19:19.620]  And indeed, Bass has an established reputation in Washington as a Hale Fellow, well met.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:33.072]  And see, what finally made him mad is, and he said he'd take a blood test he hadn't been drinking, but he woke up and said, I'd like a glass of wine with the dinner, and they said, no, you're drunk, and he said, no, I just woke up, I've been a drill, and they said no, so that's what he's arrested for.
[00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:34.694]  If there's a big event,
[00:19:35.765 --> 00:19:36.526]  And he's not there.
[00:19:36.526 --> 00:19:38.888]  Everybody knows he must be out of town.
[00:19:38.888 --> 00:19:46.173]  And it goes on to talk about how he was flying in from South America and the FBI affidavit says that he made a mean face.
[00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:48.504]  Well, that's the end of it.
[00:19:48.504 --> 00:19:50.806]  He'll be going to federal prison now, won't be seeing him.
[00:19:50.806 --> 00:19:54.931]  So see, all of you that love the system, it's meant for you.
[00:19:54.931 --> 00:20:00.817]  And it's hungry, and it's built lots of federal detention centers, and it needs warm bodies to stick in those beds.
[00:20:00.817 --> 00:20:05.903]  You've heard the Get the Tea commercials, and many people like our commercials, but I did notice something.
[00:20:06.463 --> 00:20:07.903]  What the heck is a toxin?
[00:20:07.903 --> 00:20:09.224]  So here it is.
[00:20:09.224 --> 00:20:15.425]  A toxin is a poisonous substance that is capable of causing disease when introduced into the body.
[00:20:15.425 --> 00:20:18.666]  Formaldehyde, from seat cushions and particle board.
[00:20:18.666 --> 00:20:25.428]  How about carbon monoxide, furnace burning propane, butane, disinfectants, perfume,
[00:20:26.008 --> 00:20:26.989]  Mouthwash?
[00:20:26.989 --> 00:20:27.889]  Glues?
[00:20:27.889 --> 00:20:28.750]  Air fresheners?
[00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.610]  Pesticides?
[00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.952]  Oh my gosh, even sugar is a toxin according to Dr. Lau!
[00:20:32.952 --> 00:20:34.813]  It's a very addictive drug!
[00:20:34.813 --> 00:20:37.075]  It's time to fight back!

[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.782]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.782 --> 00:21:03.623]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.623 --> 00:21:03.964]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.964 --> 00:21:09.009]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:10.631]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:11.372]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.372 --> 00:21:11.792]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:12.893]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.893 --> 00:21:15.857]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:19.741]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.741 --> 00:21:22.604]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:25.486]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.486 --> 00:21:27.067]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.067 --> 00:21:27.367]  Right!

[00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:07.215]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.215 --> 00:22:15.318]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.318 --> 00:22:20.901]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:23.484]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:22:23.484 --> 00:22:28.591]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.591 --> 00:22:33.818]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.818 --> 00:22:37.523]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.144 --> 00:22:39.225]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.225 --> 00:22:43.726]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:22:48.648 --> 00:22:51.629]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.571]  When you're ready to purify your family's drinking water and save money,
[00:23:03.314 --> 00:23:16.013]  When you're ready to remove contaminants like chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, pharmaceutical drugs, and even iron and rust from your water, and save money, when you're ready to enjoy crisp, clean water, and save money, go to purewaterfreedom.com.

[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:47.920]  We're good.
[00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.875]  We're gonna be taking your phone calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:27.935]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:34.022 --> 00:24:35.383]  But let that sink in.
[00:24:35.383 --> 00:24:53.176]  $100,000 fines the first time, $15 million fines the second time, if you sell any of over 100,000 recalled products from the last decade in a computer database at your garage sale, at your resale store, at a bazaar.
[00:24:53.176 --> 00:24:58.200]  Let's say you own a little corner store in your town, and you buy something from a wholesaler.
[00:24:59.025 --> 00:25:04.187]  That you're going to sell a bobblehead doll, a blanket, an electric blanket.
[00:25:04.187 --> 00:25:06.127]  These are the type of things that get recalled.
[00:25:06.127 --> 00:25:08.368]  Maybe it's got lead paint in it.
[00:25:08.368 --> 00:25:16.271]  It's your job to go now and screen all of that if it's on the recall list.
[00:25:16.271 --> 00:25:20.392]  And if you don't, it's a $100,000 fine the first time, $15 million the second.
[00:25:20.392 --> 00:25:20.992]  Go read it!
[00:25:20.992 --> 00:25:25.034]  Associated Press, McClatchy Newspapers, Fox News.
[00:25:25.034 --> 00:25:26.274]  They're now SWAT teaming.
[00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:28.155]  I know I talk about this a lot because it's so important.
[00:25:28.939 --> 00:25:30.280]  This is tyranny.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.222]  They're now SWAT teaming people selling produce.
[00:25:34.222 --> 00:25:40.246]  They send undercover informants to roadside stands in Ohio and Texas and California.
[00:25:40.246 --> 00:25:42.888]  These are just a few of the places we've interviewed people from.
[00:25:42.888 --> 00:25:44.228]  This is in the news!
[00:25:44.228 --> 00:25:46.510]  And the news reports it like it's good!
[00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:57.517]  Oh yes, the undercover state officer, under federal grants, went and repeatedly bought watermelons and eggs in one case, or repeatedly bought
[00:25:58.598 --> 00:26:04.285]  Uh, the, uh, carrots or the beets.
[00:26:04.285 --> 00:26:08.051]  The undercover officer then asked if he could buy more.
[00:26:08.051 --> 00:26:12.697]  They said sure, come to our farm next Saturday.
[00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:14.319]  Then a SWAT team comes to the farm
[00:26:15.553 --> 00:26:20.157]  And it's a homeschooling family with their little kids, their son.
[00:26:20.157 --> 00:26:23.519]  One group I interviewed was in, what, his third tour in Iraq?
[00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:25.121]  It's just some Christian family.
[00:26:25.121 --> 00:26:26.722]  They're raiding the Amish.
[00:26:26.722 --> 00:26:31.406]  I mean, I see these articles every week!
[00:26:31.406 --> 00:26:37.110]  The Amish, farmers, they're harassing people.
[00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:42.214]  There's no law that you have to have animal ID or premises ID, but they create the color of law all over the country.
[00:26:42.214 --> 00:26:43.015]  They do this stunt.
[00:26:43.732 --> 00:26:46.334]  They've done it a bunch in Texas, I've seen it in the newspapers.
[00:26:46.334 --> 00:26:50.498]  They've done it in Kansas.
[00:26:50.498 --> 00:26:52.841]  And they do this as a psych warfare operation.
[00:26:52.841 --> 00:26:53.741]  The feds are paying.
[00:26:53.741 --> 00:26:55.563]  This is on record.
[00:26:55.563 --> 00:27:02.590]  They will take the blue ribbon winner of the calf, or the hog, or the sow, or the chicken.
[00:27:05.478 --> 00:27:13.707]  And then, right before they award them the blue ribbon, they will have security escort them off the stage in front of everyone.
[00:27:13.707 --> 00:27:21.756]  They wait and say, oh, sorry, our rules are, they're at the, you know, the different farm and ranch clubs they have through the schools.
[00:27:22.964 --> 00:27:30.247]  Future Farmers of America and others, and the 4-H Club and the rest of them, because they're all getting grants from the feds too.
[00:27:30.247 --> 00:27:34.348]  It's all run by centralized groups, and the locals just follow the orders.
[00:27:34.348 --> 00:27:41.030]  They then escort them off the stage, take their blue ribbon away and give it to somebody else who did do the premises ID, animal ID.
[00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:41.571]  Why?
[00:27:41.571 --> 00:27:45.092]  Because when you sign those forms, you waive the rights to your property.
[00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:51.603]  Just like they got churches in the fifties, oh, just sign this form and you get your tax exemption.
[00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:53.424]  They had been under the First Amendment.
[00:27:53.424 --> 00:27:59.127]  Congress shall make no law establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:27:59.127 --> 00:28:00.908]  And they thought they were just signing a form.
[00:28:00.908 --> 00:28:05.810]  That took them from being a church under the First Amendment to a charity under federal regulations.
[00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.191]  It's all contract fraud and tricks.
[00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:09.832]  So they do these big staged events
[00:28:10.836 --> 00:28:20.230]  As the girl up there in her Justin boots and her Wranglers and her, you know, red velvet jacket, Louie Mae's up there winning the hog contest.
[00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.474]  She's going to get the $1,000 prize!
[00:28:23.474 --> 00:28:25.337]  And they lead her off with police.
[00:28:26.078 --> 00:28:27.259]  And she's crying.
[00:28:27.259 --> 00:28:32.762]  And everybody gets scared and they make sure they stop bucking the premises ID, animal ID.
[00:28:32.762 --> 00:28:35.403]  Now that's psychological terrorism.
[00:28:35.403 --> 00:28:36.684]  That's psych warfare.
[00:28:36.684 --> 00:28:39.685]  And so all over the country, you argue with the stewardess?
[00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:42.287]  You argue with the flight attendant?
[00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:44.328]  You get up out of your seat?
[00:28:44.328 --> 00:28:46.189]  Somebody complains about you?
[00:28:46.189 --> 00:28:51.952]  You get up because you can't wait, you gotta go urinate?
[00:28:51.952 --> 00:28:55.574]  I've been screamed at before when there's storms and it's two hours after takeoff.
[00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:04.104]  And I get up, and other people, I see other people finally, and one person gets up and goes back to the bathroom, and you go ahead and get up, and they're like, I said don't do that!
[00:29:04.104 --> 00:29:04.805]  No!
[00:29:04.805 --> 00:29:09.508]  Now other flight attendants go, hurry up, go to the back, go to the back, you know, I understand.
[00:29:09.508 --> 00:29:12.631]  But it's all happened to anybody who's been a business flyer.
[00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:14.092]  This is America!
[00:29:14.092 --> 00:29:18.135]  I mean, this guy is in the affidavit as making a mean face!
[00:29:18.135 --> 00:29:22.638]  He's facing 20 years in the federal pen with a terrorism conviction!
[00:29:23.632 --> 00:29:27.114]  They got little girls crying up on the stage!
[00:29:27.114 --> 00:29:29.835]  Because Daddy said, I'm not going to get a premises I.D.
[00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:37.599]  and didn't look at the fine paperwork saying you can't show a hog or a calf.
[00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:39.780]  They're at these events without waiving your rights.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.241]  See, it's all criminal.
[00:29:41.241 --> 00:29:44.402]  Well, take your calls, cover a ton of vitally important news.
[00:29:44.402 --> 00:29:46.043]  Straight ahead, stay with me.
[00:29:51.164 --> 00:29:55.065]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.065 --> 00:30:00.906]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.906 --> 00:30:03.926]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.926 --> 00:30:09.267]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.267 --> 00:30:11.308]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.308 --> 00:30:16.309]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.309 --> 00:30:17.229]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.489 --> 00:30:18.610]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.491]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.491 --> 00:30:21.572]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.572 --> 00:30:23.774]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.774 --> 00:30:25.115]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.115 --> 00:30:26.636]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.636 --> 00:30:31.900]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.483]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.483 --> 00:30:38.966]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.306 --> 00:30:40.527]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.527 --> 00:30:41.427]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.427 --> 00:30:42.527]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.527 --> 00:30:43.468]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.468 --> 00:30:44.568]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.568 --> 00:30:47.610]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.851]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.851 --> 00:30:50.811]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.098 --> 00:31:06.922]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.922 --> 00:31:14.508]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.508 --> 00:31:20.673]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.073 --> 00:31:23.053]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.053 --> 00:31:25.554]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.554 --> 00:31:37.137]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.137 --> 00:31:38.797]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.797 --> 00:31:40.658]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.658 --> 00:31:46.899]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.566 --> 00:31:55.830]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.410]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.611]  The people strike back!
[00:32:00.467 --> 00:32:08.231]  AirAndAqua.com is your one-stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:16.815]  AirAndAqua.com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water, and they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[00:32:16.815 --> 00:32:21.577]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[00:32:21.577 --> 00:32:25.499]  AirAndAqua.com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[00:32:25.499 --> 00:32:29.641]  AirAndAqua.com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[00:32:29.921 --> 00:32:30.301]  We're good.
[00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:28.845]  So, let's boil this down.
[00:33:28.845 --> 00:33:35.229]  They have set up a national police force, the federal government under UN control, publicly
[00:33:36.795 --> 00:33:46.002]  Is federalizing local police departments and putting regular Army and Marine Corps liaison officers in every major police department and many small departments.
[00:33:46.002 --> 00:33:52.186]  Every few weeks I see another news article of another town in Washington State or Oregon or Florida.
[00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:58.779]  Even places like Vermont, where, oh, we're moving the police department into the old armory.
[00:33:58.779 --> 00:34:02.360]  The National Guard is giving it to us on a 10-year federal lease.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.862]  And they're going to be in the office upstairs or next door.
[00:34:05.862 --> 00:34:07.942]  And we're going to have a threat fusion center.
[00:34:07.942 --> 00:34:10.063]  And the Army's going to be there with us.
[00:34:10.063 --> 00:34:17.886]  Or, oh, the local police department just had three Army intelligence officers in, you know, the town of Oregon.
[00:34:17.886 --> 00:34:20.167]  I forget which town it was a few months ago.
[00:34:22.432 --> 00:34:23.292]  It's going to pop in my head in a second.
[00:34:23.292 --> 00:34:25.693]  The point is, it was just in the newspaper, like it's no big deal.
[00:34:25.693 --> 00:34:28.973]  Oh, Army Intelligence is going to be in the local Police Intelligence Bureau.
[00:34:28.973 --> 00:34:32.634]  And they're going to just get to know the locals and help police with intelligence.
[00:34:32.634 --> 00:34:35.655]  I mean, they're not just saying the Army is going to be in the Police Department.
[00:34:35.655 --> 00:34:37.875]  They say it's intelligence.
[00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:40.416]  And I see these stories over and over and over.
[00:34:40.416 --> 00:34:42.016]  It's going on everywhere.
[00:34:42.016 --> 00:34:44.637]  And it's always many times worse than we know.
[00:34:46.533 --> 00:35:00.798]  It's like if you see five or six termites go in a hole on the side of your house, your wooden house, you see five or six termites, if you rip aside the siding, you're probably going to see 10,000 termites.
[00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:07.020]  And we're not seeing six termites, ladies and gentlemen, we're seeing termites climbing all over the walls of the house.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:14.142]  I mean, it's like a house on the outside that's got thousands of termites and big rotholes on the side and part of the roof is sagging.
[00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:17.652]  The house is about to collapse.
[00:35:17.652 --> 00:35:20.233]  There's tyranny crawling all over us.
[00:35:20.233 --> 00:35:21.634]  They're expanding it.
[00:35:21.634 --> 00:35:27.457]  The foreign banks have sucked us dry and are bankrupting everything by design.
[00:35:27.457 --> 00:35:32.140]  They're arresting people for making mean faces on airplanes.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.781]  They're not playing games.
[00:35:37.287 --> 00:35:42.796]  And they're charging people from different events, especially the Republican National Convention last year in Minneapolis-St.
[00:35:42.796 --> 00:35:43.617]  Paul.
[00:35:43.617 --> 00:35:46.802]  They're charging people there with terrorism for protesting.
[00:35:49.079 --> 00:35:56.103]  And so you don't get a misdemeanor charge and spend two days in jail and then have to get a lawyer and get probation.
[00:35:56.103 --> 00:35:56.683]  No.
[00:35:56.683 --> 00:36:17.294]  You go to the federal pen and that's what they intend here is to create a total and complete chilling effect where everyone is scared to death and then they go out and get the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts and InfraGard executives and even small-level companies and the clergy response teams over 50,000 preachers now that we know of recruited
[00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:24.885]  To tell their flocks to submit to government, take inoculations, go to relocation centers, turn in their firearms.
[00:36:24.885 --> 00:36:28.788]  We break it a year and a half before it's mainstream news with the secret documents.
[00:36:28.788 --> 00:36:30.229]  Now it's declassified.
[00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:32.270]  Worse than we said, of course.
[00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:37.974]  If I see 10 termites going up the side of the house, I can only tell you about the 10 termites I'm seeing.
[00:36:37.974 --> 00:36:41.637]  But I've pulled boards off the house repeatedly, and it's far worse
[00:36:43.246 --> 00:36:44.387]  Under the house.
[00:36:44.387 --> 00:36:46.168]  In the eaves of the house.
[00:36:46.168 --> 00:36:47.088]  In the roof of the house.
[00:36:47.088 --> 00:36:49.629]  They are eating everything.
[00:36:49.629 --> 00:36:52.031]  And they don't care if the house collapses.
[00:36:52.031 --> 00:36:58.954]  That's what they want.
[00:36:58.954 --> 00:37:06.358]  Alright, I meant to spend 5 minutes on an article and I've spent 25, but... This is the type of issue that we're dealing with.
[00:37:08.675 --> 00:37:18.221]  In other news, we have the internal secret memos of the EIF, Entertainment Industry Foundation.
[00:37:18.221 --> 00:37:25.525]  And it talks about, you can read it up on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, we have links to it.
[00:37:25.525 --> 00:37:29.108]  And there's also public documents you can read from them.
[00:37:29.108 --> 00:37:31.649]  Because in the past, they would hide this.
[00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:34.371]  It really got going under Bill Clinton.
[00:37:36.926 --> 00:37:53.195]  Instead of partnerships with the government and, oh, we'll give you free military hardware and free government advisors for your TV show and let you use government installations for your TV show or movie, worth millions of dollars, if you let us approve the script and rewrite your script.
[00:37:53.195 --> 00:37:55.456]  I mean, it was going on under Ronald Reagan.
[00:37:55.456 --> 00:37:58.238]  It was going on under George Bush Sr.
[00:37:58.238 --> 00:38:00.219]  It's been going on since the 60s.
[00:38:02.102 --> 00:38:19.510]  But under Bill Clinton, it went into billions of dollars where ABC, NBC, CBS, nightly news programs were having entire news packages funded and shot and written by federal agents or PR firms they hired to put out their message.
[00:38:20.834 --> 00:38:40.000]  And I've got clips in this article, Paul Watson wrote about this, that has all the links, where Rupert Murdoch's admitting at the Davos Forum, yes, I believe global warming's real, I want a global tax, and I've instructed all of my media empire, now bigger than Disney, to go out and to sell people on global carbon taxes.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.062]  And then Fox produced a six-minute video
[00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:46.364]  That's up on the site.
[00:38:46.364 --> 00:38:52.532]  They produced it bragging and showing how they put all these messages in their TV shows.
[00:38:52.532 --> 00:38:54.074]  But the government goes further.
[00:38:54.074 --> 00:38:56.256]  It is paying with your tax money
[00:38:57.421 --> 00:39:17.925]  I mean, you all heard five years ago about Armstrong Williams getting $245,000 in one payment to do just a couple interviews on TV and radio and to tell his conservative audience that Head Start, federalization of public schooling, was conservative and good.
[00:39:17.925 --> 00:39:24.567]  And the media focused on that when the different offices in Congress
[00:39:25.595 --> 00:39:30.460]  And the Government Accountability Office said every time this is done, it is a felony.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.441]  It's illegal.
[00:39:31.441 --> 00:39:37.267]  And told the White House to stop it, and the White House said, we ignore what the legislative branch says.
[00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:38.529]  We do what we want.
[00:39:38.529 --> 00:39:42.533]  When really, the President's supposed to execute what the legislative branch says and does.
[00:39:48.058 --> 00:39:59.722]  And in one year, they spent eight billion dollars, you can pull these headlines up, it's in my films, just on the Head Start program.
[00:39:59.722 --> 00:40:04.944]  They spent propagandizing for it with fake news and news packages.
[00:40:04.944 --> 00:40:12.207]  They spent nine billion on the prescription drug program.
[00:40:12.207 --> 00:40:16.409]  In fake news, do you know what nine billion dollars
[00:40:18.237 --> 00:40:22.920]  Will buy?
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:29.584]  Do you know what nine billion dollars will purchase?
[00:40:29.584 --> 00:40:31.665]  And this is what we know about!
[00:40:31.665 --> 00:40:32.966]  Most of this is secret!
[00:40:32.966 --> 00:40:41.911]  This is the five or six termites you see out on the stoop by your house by one of the front door columns.
[00:40:41.911 --> 00:40:45.113]  Or on the back porch.
[00:40:45.113 --> 00:40:47.054]  Can you imagine what else is going on?
[00:40:48.163 --> 00:40:53.848]  Now, with Barack Obama, they have a list.
[00:40:53.848 --> 00:41:02.637]  They have a list on here, and I don't have the entire four hours today to read this, but it would take hours to read it.
[00:41:02.637 --> 00:41:10.244]  On ABC, this is where they're implanting messages of forced national service, and how the government's good and do what the government says, and you're a terrorist.
[00:41:10.244 --> 00:41:12.006]  That's what it says it's being implanted.
[00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:37.545]  ABC, All My Children, America's Funniest Home Videos, Brothers and Sisters, Castle, Cougar Town, Dancing with the Stars, Desperate Housewives, Extreme Makeover, Home Edition, Flash Forward, General Hospital, Good Morning America, Grey's Anatomy, Hank, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Modern Family, One Light to Live, Private Practice, The Forgotten, The Middle, The View, Ugly Betty,
[00:41:42.455 --> 00:41:43.296]  And it goes on and on.
[00:41:43.296 --> 00:42:09.416]  CBS, Cold Case, Criminal Minds, CSI, Miami, CSI New York, Gary Unmarried, Ghost Whisperer, Number Threes, Threers, Fox, America's Most Wanted, Bones, Brothers, Cops, So You Think You Can Dance, Till Death, NBC, 30 Rock, Access Hollywood, Community, Days of Our Lives, Heroes, Parks and Recreation, The Biggest Loser, The Office Today Show, on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:16.674]  This is just one private PR firm foundation getting money from the federal government.
[00:42:16.674 --> 00:42:31.703]  They then go pay TV networks to implant this in the scripts.
[00:42:31.703 --> 00:42:33.224]  This is what's going on.
[00:42:33.224 --> 00:42:35.445]  You wonder why there's hit pieces against 9-11 Truth?
[00:42:35.445 --> 00:42:39.288]  You wonder why there's hit pieces demonizing people that don't like the private Federal Reserve System?
[00:42:41.127 --> 00:42:46.050]  You wonder why the police pull you over when you have a Ron Paul sticker or get us out of the U.N.
[00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:46.350]  sticker?
[00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:47.591]  We have their training manuals.
[00:42:47.591 --> 00:42:51.173]  They're told to go ahead and take you to jail.
[00:42:51.173 --> 00:42:57.756]  In Law Enforcement Technology magazine, a few years ago, it said if your officer sees it, go ahead and pull him over, take him to jail.
[00:42:57.756 --> 00:42:59.397]  Police chiefs, don't get mad at your officers.
[00:42:59.397 --> 00:43:00.338]  These may be terrorists.
[00:43:02.065 --> 00:43:11.293]  This is total brainwashing, and they're federalizing schools, they're federalizing the school curriculum in the United States and Europe, they're giving them pro-world government messages.
[00:43:11.293 --> 00:43:21.901]  I have Time Magazine and Newsweek for kids that's put in all the major public schools in the country for free, it's just shipped in, over and over again saying, your parents don't know what they're doing.
[00:43:21.901 --> 00:43:24.744]  They belong to the old-fashioned stupid generation.
[00:43:24.744 --> 00:43:26.305]  You're gonna take an implantable chip.
[00:43:26.485 --> 00:43:29.949]  I mean, this has been in two issues that I've seen.
[00:43:29.949 --> 00:43:32.893]  They've got weird articles about chemtrails are good.
[00:43:32.893 --> 00:43:35.716]  Yes, we're spraying you to save the Earth's atmosphere.
[00:43:35.716 --> 00:43:38.840]  Then an adult talks about it, they tell you you're crazy.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.464]  Meanwhile, the White House science czar says that they are chemtrailing.
[00:43:42.464 --> 00:43:44.527]  I mean, folks, I'm living in the twilight zone and so are you.
[00:43:48.922 --> 00:43:58.068]  I remember years ago, one of the local news talk stations, I heard during their newscast something about the Austin Air Force and clean air.
[00:43:58.068 --> 00:44:02.011]  So I called up the news director of the station and I said, was that an advertisement in the news?
[00:44:02.011 --> 00:44:03.732]  And he said, yeah.
[00:44:03.732 --> 00:44:11.017]  So I called the head of the Austin Air Force, it's a federally funded private group that was pushing stronger emissions testing and local carbon taxes.
[00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:16.873]  And he came on the air and bragged and said, yeah, we're getting everybody ready for taxation.
[00:44:16.873 --> 00:44:18.734]  That's what all this is.
[00:44:18.734 --> 00:44:30.643]  And then I read a few months ago on the Austin American Statesman here on air, where a former army intelligence captain is now running the city of Austin's program to prepare everyone for the green carbon taxes and home inspections.
[00:44:30.643 --> 00:44:34.045]  And he said in the news, yeah, this is an intelligence operation.
[00:44:34.045 --> 00:44:39.269]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we got Pentagon embeds in every town and city.
[00:44:39.269 --> 00:44:40.530]  They mean business.
[00:44:44.622 --> 00:44:51.966]  They come in with federal grants to your city, and they say, here's your federal grant, and here's who you're going to hire.
[00:44:51.966 --> 00:44:56.228]  And they hire them, and they show up Pentagon men in suits and ties.
[00:44:56.228 --> 00:44:58.248]  Pentagon men running CNN.
[00:44:58.248 --> 00:45:00.690]  Pentagon men running Fox.
[00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.931]  Pentagon men.
[00:45:02.931 --> 00:45:05.152]  Pentagon men.
[00:45:05.152 --> 00:45:13.676]  Pentagon men.
[00:45:13.676 --> 00:45:14.036]  Everywhere.
[00:45:18.379 --> 00:45:25.265]  So we'll go over more of that later in other news.
[00:45:25.265 --> 00:45:31.091]  Schwarzenegger set to ban big screen TVs over 40 inches and California is saying they use too much power.
[00:45:31.091 --> 00:45:34.754]  This is all part of the new carbon taxes.
[00:45:34.754 --> 00:45:37.797]  MEPs call for compulsory EU legislation in schools.
[00:45:37.797 --> 00:45:44.703]  London Telegraph, members of European Parliament are calling for school pupils to be forced to take European Union lessons to counter lies about Brussels.
[00:45:47.537 --> 00:45:48.077]  Brainwashing.
[00:45:48.077 --> 00:45:50.018]  Political policing.
[00:45:50.018 --> 00:45:53.359]  Treasury officials received millions from Goldman Sachs bonuses.
[00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:54.540]  Bailout money they gave them.
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:55.620]  Totally criminal.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:01.523]  Danish Prime Minister knew WTC collapse would collapse, told by US government 10 minutes before.
[00:46:01.523 --> 00:46:05.364]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:05.364 --> 00:46:12.507]  And then, if you want another example of total government control and how licenses turn a right into a privilege,
[00:46:14.682 --> 00:46:25.428]  Gun laws started after the Civil War and so did marriage licenses because they didn't even want to let black people get married and set up families because they knew families would make blacks strong.
[00:46:25.428 --> 00:46:33.053]  Before, black men were bred to black women in breeding programs on the plantations.
[00:46:33.053 --> 00:46:38.476]  The men were kept almost in loincloths out in shacks and barns.
[00:46:38.476 --> 00:46:42.118]  Women were brought in to be the sub-level slave masters in the houses.
[00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:47.875]  And when you get a marriage license, it's now a eugenics system.
[00:46:47.875 --> 00:46:56.343]  Your blood is taken for 37 years now, at birth, worldwide, in the industrialized world, put in a UN database that's now been declassified.
[00:46:56.343 --> 00:46:59.366]  Interracial couple denied marriage license in Louisiana.
[00:46:59.366 --> 00:47:06.352]  A Louisiana Justice of the Peace said he refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple out of concern for any children the couple might have.
[00:47:06.352 --> 00:47:08.995]  Kenneth Bradwell, Justice of the Peace, in
[00:47:11.553 --> 00:47:25.303]  I'll mispronounce this and the French will get mad at me in Louisiana, but Tanga Fayella Parish says, in his experience, that most interracial marriages do not last long.
[00:47:25.303 --> 00:47:31.347]  See, and under that license, marrying the woman you want is illegal if the government wants to say it is.
[00:47:31.347 --> 00:47:32.387]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:47:32.387 --> 00:47:33.388]  That's a load of bull.
[00:47:33.388 --> 00:47:38.192]  It's also unconstitutional to say, you made a mean face and argued quietly.
[00:47:38.192 --> 00:47:40.193]  We're going to charge you as a terrorist on the airplane.
[00:47:43.238 --> 00:47:45.079]  This is what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:52.863]  We're going to go to break and come back, and I'm going to take calls for the next hour, and then I'm going to talk to Bob Chapman, and then I'm going to get into all this news.
[00:47:52.863 --> 00:47:55.165]  I've got a bunch of video clips, a bunch of audio clips.

[00:48:01.568 --> 00:48:09.893]  We're going to go live for the last two hours of the show today, simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv, the syndicated radio show that the great crew makes possible, and also the listeners make possible.
[00:48:10.964 --> 00:48:17.929]  We're also going to premiere the fifth and final trailer in the third hour today.

[00:51:01.104 --> 00:51:02.866]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:51:02.866 --> 00:51:04.367]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:51:04.367 --> 00:51:05.708]  Say no to chemicals.

[00:52:07.466 --> 00:52:13.352]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:52:13.352 --> 00:52:19.518]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:19.838 --> 00:52:21.818]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:21.818 --> 00:52:24.279]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:24.279 --> 00:52:37.461]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.461 --> 00:52:39.142]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.142 --> 00:52:41.002]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:41.002 --> 00:52:47.223]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:53:14.588 --> 00:53:16.529]  There is a solution that doesn't involve

[00:54:47.583 --> 00:54:49.004]  Hi.
[00:54:49.004 --> 00:54:53.186]  Hey, I got a couple of points I'd like to run by you.
[00:54:53.186 --> 00:55:05.490]  The first is that there's a former United States Congressman from the Youngstown area by the name of James Traffickant, and he used to rage against the corruption of the federal government on the House floor.
[00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:06.590]  We have been fighting.
[00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:15.994]  We've talked to his wife, we've talked to other talk show hosts who've had him on, and anybody who can get Traffickant on with us, we want to get him on the show.
[00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:21.555]  Okay, because he was just recently released from jail, and I'm pretty sure he wants to be heard.
[00:55:21.555 --> 00:55:22.155]  No, I know!
[00:55:22.155 --> 00:55:26.720]  I mean, listen, he goes on little local Youngstown, Ohio radio stations.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.804]  In fact, did we have any luck, uh, Neihardt, uh, with that talk show host?
[00:55:30.804 --> 00:55:34.647]  In fact, come on air!
[00:55:34.647 --> 00:55:37.370]  I'm... Well, it's alright.
[00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:38.531]  Yeah, yeah, we're working on getting him.
[00:55:38.531 --> 00:55:41.094]  I mean, I want you to know, we are working on getting James Traficant, yes.
[00:55:42.872 --> 00:56:05.671]  The second point I want to bring up is that years ago, I remember reading something about this and I can't find primary source material about this and I don't remember seeing it in the 9-11 documentaries, but I remember seeing something about a Patriot missile system being installed on the Sarasota Beach resort that Bush was staying at a couple of days before the attack.
[00:56:05.671 --> 00:56:06.732]  Have you heard anything about that?
[00:56:06.732 --> 00:56:08.013]  I don't remember seeing that, no.
[00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:26.842]  Because there's one site that I found online called Killtown.com, and it mentions it, and I thought I read something years ago in the newspaper about it, but if any of your listeners or any of your staff or anybody can find out any primary source material about that, I think it may be a reality.
[00:56:26.842 --> 00:56:30.966]  Well, have you tried to Google a Patriot system installed by Bush or something?
[00:56:31.623 --> 00:56:36.104]  By his brother because of the martial law that he declared a few days before the attack.
[00:56:36.104 --> 00:56:46.887]  That was in the Associated Press and in the Florida newspapers that he declared martial law September 9th and put the National Guard on alert for a terror attack.
[00:56:46.887 --> 00:56:48.647]  And so that is confirmed.
[00:56:48.647 --> 00:56:55.209]  Okay, yeah, I think part of it was to put a Patriot missile system on top of the beach resort, but I can't find primary source material.
[00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:58.109]  Okay, I will look into that.
[00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:59.070]  That's very important.
[00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:00.650]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:02.551]  Good to hear from you, John.
[00:57:02.551 --> 00:57:05.252]  Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in North Dakota.
[00:57:05.252 --> 00:57:07.152]  Greg, you're on the air.
[00:57:07.152 --> 00:57:07.832]  Good morning.
[00:57:07.832 --> 00:57:10.293]  Nice to talk with you, Alex.
[00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:10.953]  Nice to talk to you, buddy.
[00:57:10.953 --> 00:57:11.854]  What's up?
[00:57:11.854 --> 00:57:17.415]  Yeah, I just want to tell you that I think that you made a really good choice with Jason to do your show at night.
[00:57:17.415 --> 00:57:23.877]  He's very competent, and I just have a few suggestions for you.
[00:57:23.877 --> 00:57:25.858]  That Generation RX, I watched that film.
[00:57:26.818 --> 00:57:27.939]  I was very impressed with it.
[00:57:27.939 --> 00:57:35.769]  I think that a lot of people would be very interested and have a better outlook on the FDA if they were able to view that on your site.
[00:57:36.977 --> 00:57:47.205]  Yeah, well, that's not my film, so I can't put it on PrisonPlanet.TV, but I did buy it in bulk from them, and we do sell it in the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:47.205 --> 00:57:55.352]  But yes, whatever I see that I think's important and informative, I try to buy it, and I try to make it available to the listeners, generally discounted as well.
[00:57:55.352 --> 00:58:03.419]  And Generation RX shows how they're drugging now 20% of our kids, how it's causing them to commit suicide, how they know that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors do this.
[00:58:03.959 --> 00:58:09.382]  Well, I just want to say that I think you should get a Just Say No shirt and underneath that shirt you should put some of the things like
[00:58:26.721 --> 00:58:33.044]  For instance, say no to Obama, say no to the healthcare, say no and maybe just say yes to liberty on the back of it.
[00:58:33.044 --> 00:58:33.865]  Something like that.
[00:58:33.865 --> 00:58:34.845]  Legalize liberty.
[00:58:34.845 --> 00:58:37.406]  I keep meaning to make a t-shirt of that.
[00:58:37.406 --> 00:58:38.087]  Thank you, sir.
[00:58:38.087 --> 00:58:42.609]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:42.609 --> 00:58:45.230]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:48.392]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.401 --> 00:58:54.625]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.625 --> 00:58:56.647]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.647 --> 00:59:05.176]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.176 --> 00:59:10.721]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.721 --> 00:59:12.343]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.563 --> 00:59:19.085]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.085 --> 00:59:30.130]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:30.910]  That's right.
[00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:33.471]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:35.051]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:36.992 --> 00:59:37.452]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:08.326]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.326 --> 01:00:10.087]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.087 --> 01:00:11.668]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.668 --> 01:00:12.589]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:17.412]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.412 --> 01:00:21.474]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.552 --> 01:00:31.055]  We are now into our number two.
[01:00:31.055 --> 01:00:34.097]  Coming up, they start the new green taxes.
[01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:39.141]  Not just taxing television sets, but banning above 40 inchers in California.
[01:00:39.141 --> 01:00:40.742]  That'll go nationwide.
[01:00:40.742 --> 01:00:43.264]  Making a thumbprint to get your ammo.
[01:00:43.264 --> 01:00:49.269]  In Louisiana, the government says that you can't have interracial marriages in one parish.
[01:00:49.269 --> 01:00:52.231]  That's the power of government and it's criminality thinking it's God.
[01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:54.793]  We'll get into the latest developments with the dollar.
[01:00:55.981 --> 01:00:59.543]  The Danish Prime Minister knew WTC would collapse, was told by the U.S.
[01:00:59.543 --> 01:01:00.924]  government.
[01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:04.906]  It is all coming up today and Bob Chapman in the next hour.
[01:01:04.906 --> 01:01:06.888]  We are continuing with your phone calls.
[01:01:06.888 --> 01:01:20.316]  When we go live next hour, simulcasting the radio show at PrisonPlanet.TV, I'm going to premiere the latest trailer, the final trailer of Fall of the Republic, the police state trailer.
[01:01:20.316 --> 01:01:22.757]  That is coming up right now.
[01:01:22.757 --> 01:01:24.598]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:25.519]  Let's talk to
[01:01:26.704 --> 01:01:27.785]  David in Florida.
[01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:29.946]  David, you're on the air.
[01:01:29.946 --> 01:01:30.867]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:01:30.867 --> 01:01:32.027]  It's been a long time.
[01:01:32.027 --> 01:01:45.296]  I've been a listener for many years, and I want to let you know that as the enemy of liberty comes in like a flood, the Creator has risen up a standard to carry on the work of yourself, and Dr. Paul, I'm a student.
[01:01:45.296 --> 01:01:47.617]  There's a couple things I want to hit on, Alex.
[01:01:47.617 --> 01:01:56.203]  First off, this financial regulation bill that was just introduced by Geithner and his bosses, obviously, Goldman-funded.
[01:01:56.696 --> 01:01:57.277]  Yes, we have the
[01:02:14.266 --> 01:02:22.868]  Financial parasitic false economy, the paper economy, waging war against Main Street, against private property, against the individual.
[01:02:22.868 --> 01:02:28.429]  They're using a socialist system to take our wealth and transfer it offshore to themselves.
[01:02:28.429 --> 01:02:42.953]  And now, as I said a year ago, as we said in the Obama deception, as we cover in Fall of the Republic, the new, quote, bailout or financial regulatory system will be run, they admit, by the private Federal Reserve and the very Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and others,
[01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:57.058]  That have run the whole Ponzi scheme into an even bigger scam and they hold the economy hostage saying give us unlimited power or the economy will die as they kill the economy and it's all happening right now.
[01:02:57.058 --> 01:03:08.142]  So either we identify the bankers, have the bankers indicted and arrested and finally bring them to justice or they're able to carry their scam through to their ultimate goal of total world financial dictatorship.
[01:03:09.784 --> 01:03:10.324]  Absolutely.
[01:03:10.324 --> 01:03:24.367]  I've got two other things I want to hit on if you have the time for me, but in Massachusetts we just saw the totalitarian technocracy cemented into law where the barbarism of pillage has been legalized so long as it is in quote, good faith.
[01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:28.867]  You see that two, three, four, five times on each page of that bill.
[01:03:28.867 --> 01:03:30.948]  And it forsakes our warrants system.
[01:03:30.948 --> 01:03:31.988]  What's left of it?
[01:03:31.988 --> 01:03:37.169]  Habeas corpus is gone and by definition it is a bill of attainder because those who do not
[01:03:38.005 --> 01:03:45.907]  uh... agree with what the state authorities say when this emergency is declared will automatically be jailed or property taken.
[01:03:45.907 --> 01:03:48.147]  That's what they say.
[01:03:48.147 --> 01:03:49.047]  That's what they say.
[01:03:49.047 --> 01:04:04.631]  They'll take your house, take everything you got, clap you on irons and all over the country the feds are funding knock and talk where police are showing up from even in states like texas where you never think it would happen they're showing up in dallas and houston saying we'd like to come in your house and inspect your firearms without a warrant
[01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.892]  And they literally push their way past.
[01:04:06.892 --> 01:04:13.334]  They show up in the middle of the day, they case the records of the home, and know that it's a woman at home alone.
[01:04:13.334 --> 01:04:14.974]  It is absolutely criminal.
[01:04:14.974 --> 01:04:18.235]  The government is completely parasitic and out of control.
[01:04:18.235 --> 01:04:20.456]  Absolutely.
[01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:25.937]  Now, lastly, Mr. Jones, I actually sent a letter to you about two, three months ago.
[01:04:25.937 --> 01:04:31.279]  And I know you're very busy, but I had asked if you could make a trip down to my university.
[01:04:31.279 --> 01:04:32.259]  It's actually Embry-Riddle.
[01:04:32.259 --> 01:04:34.240]  I don't know if you've ever heard of it, aeronautical school.
[01:04:34.915 --> 01:04:36.196]  Uh, Florida.
[01:04:36.196 --> 01:04:39.177]  And, uh, I started a club down here, and I would like to try to bring you down.
[01:04:39.177 --> 01:04:44.700]  Sir, I would love to, but I can't even... I mean, I could go speak to crowds of 10,000 people.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.822]  Uh, but I... I mean, I can't.
[01:04:47.822 --> 01:04:59.308]  This is electronic media, and we reach millions every day, and I'm literally working my... I'd love to come visit you, but, I mean, I've been asked by governments to come speak, but I just can't do it.
[01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:05.768]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:10.294]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.294 --> 01:05:12.577]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.577 --> 01:05:14.199]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.199 --> 01:05:15.241]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.461 --> 01:05:23.883]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:06:22.711 --> 01:06:26.313]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.

[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.421]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:35.421 --> 01:08:53.445]  If you're listening to us on this live Friday afternoon worldwide broadcast, as we simulcast on more than 70 AM and FM stations across the country, Global Shortwave, WWCR, theinternetatinfowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[01:08:53.445 --> 01:08:53.685]  Okay.
[01:08:57.526 --> 01:09:07.511]  I want to go over some of the news coming up later in the hour after I take more of your calls, but I also want to just put this out there, because I don't say this often enough.
[01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:11.013]  We told you so.
[01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:18.277]  We told you so, and now you'd better listen to us in the future.
[01:09:18.277 --> 01:09:23.380]  For 14 years, for 12 years syndicated,
[01:09:24.654 --> 01:09:43.125]  I have read United Nations documents, Fortune 100 documents, Bilderberg Group documents, Council on Foreign Relations documents, Pentagon documents, where they were openly saying they were going to set up a world banking system with total control, with carbon taxes over everything you do.
[01:09:44.105 --> 01:10:01.124]  That the state was going to have year-round schooling to take control of the family, that they were going to set up a tattletale spy system, that they were going to put paramilitary police and regular military on the streets, not just of the United States, but of Germany and England and Australia and Canada.
[01:10:01.124 --> 01:10:04.188]  Worldwide in the industrialized West.
[01:10:07.591 --> 01:10:09.632]  This is a global corporate takeover.
[01:10:09.632 --> 01:10:11.453]  It's called globalization.
[01:10:11.453 --> 01:10:12.914]  It's called the New World Order.
[01:10:12.914 --> 01:10:16.476]  It's called global governance.
[01:10:16.476 --> 01:10:19.998]  And you watch Senator Jay Rockefeller's committee meetings on C-SPAN.
[01:10:19.998 --> 01:10:21.739]  You watch Gordon Brown give speeches.
[01:10:21.739 --> 01:10:24.800]  You watch the Davos Switzerland summits.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:30.823]  And everybody on the podium calls for New World Order, global governance.
[01:10:30.823 --> 01:10:33.685]  I've got clip after clip in Fall of the Republic.
[01:10:35.779 --> 01:10:38.340]  There were scores of clips I didn't even put in it.
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.541]  There's too many.
[01:10:40.541 --> 01:10:42.281]  My new film.
[01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:44.342]  It's a joke.
[01:10:44.342 --> 01:10:51.904]  Not only do we have world government forming openly, but it's private, it's corrupt, you have no due process, you have no liberty, you have no freedom.
[01:10:51.904 --> 01:10:57.286]  And what the establishment did all these years, while myself and others were fighting it, was deny it existed.
[01:10:57.286 --> 01:10:59.407]  We go, look, we have a CFR document.
[01:10:59.407 --> 01:11:01.147]  Look, we have a UN document.
[01:11:01.147 --> 01:11:02.548]  Look, we have a State Department document.
[01:11:05.103 --> 01:11:10.972]  And the local radio, the TV, the media, bought and paid for by the government, that's now all declassified in public.
[01:11:10.972 --> 01:11:13.036]  The Pentagon is being paid off.
[01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:15.540]  The Pentagon's paying off the media.
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.503]  So foreign banks can steal trillions.
[01:11:17.503 --> 01:11:18.705]  This is a heist going on!
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:39.365]  They would demonize you and make jokes, or have a TV show about the private Federal Reserve, and next, two Bacabras, and after that, Flying Saucers, to discredit the real fact of the Federal Reserve by mixing it in with space aliens and the rest of it.
[01:11:39.365 --> 01:11:46.947]  So the public wouldn't listen, and now they're announcing open world government on the mainstream television and the end of the dollar,
[01:11:49.107 --> 01:11:56.210]  And they're announcing a new private bank of the world formed around the International Monetary Fund will control it.
[01:11:56.210 --> 01:12:00.773]  The bank steal $23.7 trillion in the first 10 months of the bailout.
[01:12:00.773 --> 01:12:05.855]  It's now been more than a year since the bailout, but we haven't gotten new numbers in two months and a week and a half.
[01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:12.172]  But Bloomberg, AP, and Reuters report $23.7 trillion.
[01:12:12.172 --> 01:12:17.416]  If you follow the graph, it'll be over $28 trillion the next time they give us the number.
[01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:18.496]  Normally, it's every two months.
[01:12:18.496 --> 01:12:22.479]  They're due to give the new numbers any day.
[01:12:22.479 --> 01:12:28.424]  And if it follows the graph, it'll be $28.4 trillion.
[01:12:28.424 --> 01:12:32.667]  But I've got Congress reporting $23.7 trillion in fall of the Republic.
[01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:42.072]  And they admit that the banks are hoarding the money and not loaning it and imploding the economy by design and then giving record bonuses.
[01:12:42.072 --> 01:12:48.433]  I was reading about different private banks in England and Goldman Sachs brokerage firms and JPMorgan Chase and others.
[01:12:48.433 --> 01:13:01.716]  The average bonus in London, England for the brokerage firms for the average for low-level employees, that means secretaries, was $840,000 plus.
[01:13:06.493 --> 01:13:11.035]  Three hundred and something thousand pounds.
[01:13:11.035 --> 01:13:13.936]  It's over four hundred thousand pounds.
[01:13:13.936 --> 01:13:16.197]  You can pull these articles up.
[01:13:16.197 --> 01:13:19.958]  High level people got fifteen million dollar bonuses on average.
[01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:22.239]  I mean, this is in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:13:23.462 --> 01:13:24.644]  of your bailout money.
[01:13:24.644 --> 01:13:28.589]  It's the same numbers at AIG, same stuff, in some cases worse.
[01:13:28.589 --> 01:13:39.262]  And I have mainstream news reporting like it's completely kosher and normal that Goldman Sachs is getting the biggest bonuses in their history, company-wide.
[01:13:42.814 --> 01:13:48.177]  Some of the bank heads are getting billion-dollar-plus bonuses.
[01:13:48.177 --> 01:13:52.119]  Billion-dollar-plus bonuses apiece.
[01:13:52.119 --> 01:13:53.259]  I mean, go read the bonuses.
[01:13:53.259 --> 01:13:58.622]  In fact, in my stack I've got some articles that list them.
[01:13:58.622 --> 01:14:05.745]  I'll go over that later with Bob Chapman when he's on with us next hour from the International Forecaster covering the economy and what's happening with the dollar.
[01:14:05.745 --> 01:14:06.626]  And I sit here
[01:14:10.444 --> 01:14:15.806]  And I have people all over the street and everywhere I go say, oh Alex, you know, you were right, the conspiracy theory is coming true.
[01:14:15.806 --> 01:14:18.707]  It wasn't a conspiracy theory.
[01:14:18.707 --> 01:14:30.951]  When you read what the Club of Rome and the international organizations are saying, like the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the CFR, when you read what they say they're going to do, they're going to do it.
[01:14:32.967 --> 01:14:46.259]  Homeland Security in 2003 when they first became a cabinet position, I watched Ridge on C-SPAN say that they're going to have checkpoints on the street and the malls and that all of America will be like a giant airport.
[01:14:47.574 --> 01:14:49.975]  That's how I knew this would happen, and now it's happening.
[01:14:49.975 --> 01:14:55.939]  The Pentagon said, before 9-11, they were going to use terrorism to deploy troops in the streets of America.
[01:14:55.939 --> 01:14:58.680]  And that they were going to set up Homeland Security.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.281]  I read that from documents in 1993.
[01:15:00.281 --> 01:15:06.905]  And they would set up a NORTHCOM, like CENTCOM, and SOUTHCOM, and AFRICOM.
[01:15:09.266 --> 01:15:10.707]  And now they've done it.
[01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:14.309]  I mean, all I do is tell you what they're saying.
[01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:18.932]  I mean, the White House science czar has written ten books we know about, one of them
[01:15:24.054 --> 01:15:31.757]  1,054 pages long, John P. Holdren Ecoscience, where they say we need to put stuff in the water to sterilize the people.
[01:15:31.757 --> 01:15:33.357]  We need to have year-round school.
[01:15:33.357 --> 01:15:34.938]  We need to take the kids away from the parents.
[01:15:34.938 --> 01:15:37.319]  That's the only way the state will be able to totally take over.
[01:15:37.319 --> 01:15:38.879]  I mean, it's all here.
[01:15:38.879 --> 01:15:45.602]  I'm holding in my hand a 1,054 page book, and I read most of it.
[01:15:45.602 --> 01:15:47.642]  I scanned through the whole stinking thing.
[01:15:47.642 --> 01:15:52.684]  We scanned online at PrisonPlanet.com hundreds of pages of the stinking thing.
[01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:58.770]  Since then, listeners have found university sites that have it for free, the entire thing.
[01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:02.611]  Just Google Ecoscience e-book, you can read the stinking thing for free!
[01:16:02.611 --> 01:16:11.874]  Don't you sit there and tell me I'm making this up when this is right here in my hand!
[01:16:11.874 --> 01:16:14.034]  You can't afford it!
[01:16:14.034 --> 01:16:18.196]  I'm talking to neocons and fake liberals tuning in.
[01:16:18.196 --> 01:16:23.037]  We're all in serious danger and we need every able-bodied man, woman, and child to wake up.
[01:16:26.263 --> 01:16:36.409]  And to realize what's going on, and to get up off your butts, and realize the type of serious, hardcore, emergency situation we're in.
[01:16:36.409 --> 01:16:38.131]  Do you know what world government means?
[01:16:38.131 --> 01:16:43.114]  They openly state in every globalist document, they brag on NPR a decade ago, I'd hear them.
[01:16:43.114 --> 01:16:52.440]  Oh yes, under globalization we will lower the standard of living of the people of the United States because we have too big a carbon footprint and it'll be good for us and we'll help the third world raising them up.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.482]  Lowering us, raising... They're not going to raise.
[01:16:55.482 --> 01:16:59.004]  You read the internal documents, not the public PR stuff.
[01:16:59.004 --> 01:17:02.106]  And they talk about how they're going to wreck the third world by design.
[01:17:02.106 --> 01:17:05.088]  The Royal Commission on Population, published by the British government.
[01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:06.649]  Go read the stinking thing.
[01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:07.129]  It's public.
[01:17:10.123 --> 01:17:13.825]  And you read what the carbon bill that passed the House does.
[01:17:13.825 --> 01:17:22.028]  It gives 35 federal agencies unlimited carte blanche power to do whatever they want.
[01:17:22.028 --> 01:17:28.351]  Just like they've got bills introduced where the Attorney General can ban any and all guns under fiat executive power.
[01:17:28.351 --> 01:17:32.373]  It gives him godlike dictator status.
[01:17:32.373 --> 01:17:33.173]  Go read the bills!
[01:17:33.173 --> 01:17:35.094]  We've given you the bill numbers.
[01:17:35.094 --> 01:17:36.535]  Guns of America has them listed.
[01:17:39.451 --> 01:17:42.632]  GunOwners.org.
[01:17:42.632 --> 01:17:43.873]  Just Google the term.
[01:17:43.873 --> 01:17:48.555]  Bill would allow Attorney General to ban any gun he wishes.
[01:17:48.555 --> 01:17:52.056]  Schwarzenegger two weeks ago lied and said, I'm not going to sign that bill to kill opposition.
[01:17:52.056 --> 01:17:53.637]  Then he signed it.
[01:17:53.637 --> 01:17:55.138]  This is a military tactic.
[01:17:55.138 --> 01:18:00.240]  They say, we're not introducing amnesty legislation, but we're not going to let you see the legislation three years ago.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.561]  Then Senator Sessions leaked it, and the thing was worse than amnesty.
[01:18:03.561 --> 01:18:06.342]  He legalized illegal alien felons.
[01:18:06.342 --> 01:18:07.823]  Allowed them to bring their whole families here.
[01:18:09.127 --> 01:18:18.936]  They tell you, oh, we're going to spend the bank or bailout bill to get the mortgages going, then Saturday after they pass it, they say, oh, we're not going to use any of it for that, and we're not going to tell you where the money went.
[01:18:18.936 --> 01:18:21.098]  Oh, we're not planning a global government.
[01:18:21.098 --> 01:18:29.706]  Oh, don't worry, the derivatives, you know, they're not going to hurt the economy in 99 when they got rid of the Glass-Steagall.
[01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:34.890]  The Glass-Steagall, I mean, this is a military system where they deny.
[01:18:35.934 --> 01:18:42.815]  Even as the tanks rammed the Waco church and set the place on fire and shot everybody coming out, we have the FLIR footage from the fixed-wing aircraft.
[01:18:42.815 --> 01:18:44.836]  The FBI released it.
[01:18:44.836 --> 01:18:52.357]  They were broadcasting, this is not an assault, come out with your hands up, and they would shoot the people as they ran out the back.
[01:18:52.357 --> 01:18:59.119]  The feds strung barbed wire all up around the front and only left one area for them to get out of the Constantino wire.
[01:18:59.119 --> 01:19:00.519]  And they shot them as they came out.
[01:19:01.638 --> 01:19:03.419]  Broadcasting, this is not an assault.
[01:19:03.419 --> 01:19:04.279]  This is not an assault.
[01:19:04.279 --> 01:19:05.620]  Repeat, this is not an assault.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:13.284]  Come out with your hands up while FBI snipers and infantry soldiers of the Delta Force, that's in the congressional report, were there.
[01:19:15.342 --> 01:19:24.708]  And you can see the Christmas tree flashes off the ends of their guns in the infantry maneuver as they sit behind the Bradley fighting vehicles, firing from their concealed positions, shooting people!
[01:19:24.708 --> 01:19:26.709]  Saying this is not an assault!
[01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:29.311]  No, this is a New World Order assault!
[01:19:29.311 --> 01:19:33.094]  And everybody keeps debating whether it's real or not!
[01:19:33.094 --> 01:19:34.555]  The dollar's plunging!
[01:19:34.555 --> 01:19:36.676]  World government's being announced!
[01:19:36.676 --> 01:19:40.739]  It's real!
[01:19:40.739 --> 01:19:41.219]  It's real!
[01:19:43.373 --> 01:19:47.234]  We're gonna come back, take your phone calls, and get into all this other news.
[01:19:47.234 --> 01:19:48.555]  The global carbon taxes.
[01:19:48.555 --> 01:19:52.116]  They're gonna tax everything you eat, everything you do, everything in your home.
[01:19:52.116 --> 01:19:55.337]  They're gonna ban above 40-inch TVs starting in California.
[01:19:55.337 --> 01:19:56.878]  That's mainstream news.
[01:19:56.878 --> 01:19:58.639]  It's all happening.
[01:19:58.639 --> 01:19:59.639]  Total control.
[01:19:59.639 --> 01:20:00.019]  Worse than 1984.
[01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:13.350]  Simple.
[01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.912]  PureBulk.com.

[01:20:42.193 --> 01:20:42.473]  I don't know.
[01:21:03.109 --> 01:21:06.171]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[01:21:06.171 --> 01:21:08.472]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[01:21:08.472 --> 01:21:12.574]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutroversal Foods.
[01:21:12.574 --> 01:21:19.258]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.

[01:22:00.851 --> 01:22:01.912]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:01.912 --> 01:22:06.856]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:22:06.856 --> 01:22:14.922]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:22:14.922 --> 01:22:20.506]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:22:20.506 --> 01:22:27.491]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:22:27.691 --> 01:22:28.192]  We're good to go!
[01:22:49.513 --> 01:22:52.939]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.

[01:23:47.723 --> 01:23:49.985]  We like to call that Choose for Charity.

[01:23:52.366 --> 01:23:53.307]  1-800-226-5970 or orderchoose.com.
[01:23:53.307 --> 01:23:53.727]  Thanks!
[01:24:14.024 --> 01:24:15.026]  Here's Reuters.
[01:24:15.026 --> 01:24:16.747]  Today Soros says U.S.
[01:24:16.747 --> 01:24:18.730]  economy will drag on world growth.
[01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:20.772]  See, America has to fall.
[01:24:20.772 --> 01:24:23.014]  Billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros.
[01:24:23.991 --> 01:24:27.152]  He's a criminal, convicted criminal, but he's a philanthropist.
[01:24:27.152 --> 01:24:33.973]  Said Thursday, the world's current currency arrangements are fraught with danger and the world needs a global regulation.
[01:24:33.973 --> 01:24:38.934]  See, they're all calling for the new Bank of the World, and so are the criminals running the Federal Reserve.
[01:24:38.934 --> 01:24:45.576]  Soros, who runs hedge funds from Soros Fund Management, and has made a reputation with bond currency bets, said the U.S.
[01:24:45.576 --> 01:24:51.577]  dollar ought to be falling in value against the Chinese currency to allow the United States to contain its current account deficit.
[01:24:54.042 --> 01:25:00.536]  That's the type of news we have here and I was just mailed by a listener a Houston Post article from
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:09.807]  May 5th, 1970, flu shots defended, but growing number of elderly refused vaccine.
[01:25:09.807 --> 01:25:16.253]  Even then, always trying to force it, saying you're crazy, saying you're bad if you won't take the shot.
[01:25:16.253 --> 01:25:23.479]  We're going to show that when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, simulcasting the radio show online at PrisonPlanet.tv next hour.
[01:25:23.479 --> 01:25:26.022]  Let's continue with your phone calls here.
[01:25:26.022 --> 01:25:27.863]  In the first hour, I covered how
[01:25:28.829 --> 01:25:36.991]  Every week or so I see news articles where if you even argue with a stewardess, with a flight attendant, you get arrested and charged under the Patriot Act.
[01:25:36.991 --> 01:25:46.494]  And a big political operative consultant, with no criminal record, flying in from South America into D.C., argued with a stewardess quietly.
[01:25:46.494 --> 01:25:55.317]  They said he made an ugly face at her, and questioned her, and that's all it says, and he's being charged under the Patriot Act.
[01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:56.657]  Ah yes, gotta fight that Al Qaeda.
[01:25:58.192 --> 01:25:59.436]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:25:59.436 --> 01:26:02.984]  Sergey in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:26:02.984 --> 01:26:04.268]  Thank you Alex for taking my call.
[01:26:05.522 --> 01:26:07.183]  I have a question.
[01:26:07.183 --> 01:26:09.405]  What do you think the future of Russia is?
[01:26:09.405 --> 01:26:13.489]  And is Russia in opposition to the New World Order?
[01:26:13.489 --> 01:26:15.331]  And what is the role for it?
[01:26:15.331 --> 01:26:16.512]  No.
[01:26:16.512 --> 01:26:22.818]  Russia is somewhat against the Anglo-American, British, US-dominated New World Order.
[01:26:22.818 --> 01:26:29.424]  But the banks that were based here are now moving to a more global role, sucking us dry to fund setting up their larger system.
[01:26:29.864 --> 01:26:30.004]  I think?
[01:26:51.150 --> 01:26:54.233]  Raise their birth numbers because they're dying like the West.
[01:26:54.233 --> 01:26:56.375]  They have a 1.3 for every two adults.
[01:26:56.375 --> 01:26:58.497]  They only have 1.3 children.
[01:26:58.497 --> 01:27:03.441]  And so they're bucking the New World Order, but only for their own personal power.
[01:27:03.441 --> 01:27:08.065]  And Putin did kick out six top oligarchs that were working for the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
[01:27:08.065 --> 01:27:09.106]  That's in the Times of London.
[01:27:10.307 --> 01:27:18.113]  But, you know, just because Iran and Russia aren't with the big powerful New World Order doesn't mean they're not as crooked as a barrel of snakes.
[01:27:18.113 --> 01:27:21.655]  But, yes, they want their own New World Order.
[01:27:21.655 --> 01:27:30.421]  In fact, you can Google that headline, Russia wants its own New World Order, and you'll see hundreds of statements by Putin and Medvedev and others where they're saying this.
[01:27:30.421 --> 01:27:31.141]  But, yes,
[01:27:32.322 --> 01:27:34.004]  It isn't just on the surface.
[01:27:34.004 --> 01:27:40.149]  The New World Order is not all-powerful yet, the globalist-controlled one, and Russia is not fully under their control.
[01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.930]  That's why the U.S.
[01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:48.877]  launched a sneak attack on Russia in Georgia on 888, along with NATO and Israel, trying to start World War III, but it didn't work.
[01:27:48.877 --> 01:27:52.040]  And so it's very, very serious what's happening.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.284]  I was watching a... I was actually reading a lot about the history of Russia.
[01:27:56.284 --> 01:27:57.245]  I was raised in Russia.
[01:27:58.284 --> 01:27:59.205]  You know what's interesting?
[01:27:59.205 --> 01:28:05.951]  When I moved to the U.S., I realized that many things that you're talking about have happened in Russia in the last 70 years.
[01:28:05.951 --> 01:28:16.340]  Like, they have managed control of age of population and increase of... It's been around 130, 540 million people in the last 70 years.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.361]  It's been sitting there.
[01:28:23.219 --> 01:28:24.020]  It's just interesting.
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:26.462]  So many things are crossing my mind.
[01:28:26.462 --> 01:28:31.986]  I find answers in what you're talking about, what has happened there for the last 70 years.
[01:28:31.986 --> 01:28:44.114]  And I personally saw when the Great Wall fell down, I saw a huge design of globalization and things that were implemented in Russia kind of spilling out in the rest of the world.
[01:28:44.114 --> 01:28:44.635]  What do you think?
[01:28:45.768 --> 01:28:56.276]  Yes, a deal was made to bring Russia fully under the New World Order and not use it as a bipolar system so they could build up a police state here in the name of fighting Russia.
[01:28:56.276 --> 01:29:02.862]  Once the police state was built, and once we were socialized, then Russia could be imploded and taken over by the oligarchs.
[01:29:02.862 --> 01:29:10.107]  But it does appear that the Russians have kicked out many of the oligarchs and are in control of their own system.
[01:29:10.107 --> 01:29:10.628]  What do you think?
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.762]  I think it might be a double game.
[01:29:17.762 --> 01:29:26.244]  It's very hard to tell because they've been very, very creative in playing this double or triple game in the last seven years.
[01:29:26.244 --> 01:29:28.805]  Very, very sophisticated.
[01:29:28.805 --> 01:29:31.026]  Well, the Russians are the best at playing chess.
[01:29:31.026 --> 01:29:33.047]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:33.047 --> 01:29:33.847]  Absolutely.
[01:29:33.847 --> 01:29:36.668]  Very sophisticated New World Order game.
[01:29:36.668 --> 01:29:37.448]  I study this stuff.
[01:29:39.033 --> 01:29:47.300]  Literally 18 hours a day, and I learn more every day, but you never know what's going on at the very top echelons.
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:51.444]  You can just see the agenda unfolding at ground level.
[01:29:51.444 --> 01:29:52.825]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.825 --> 01:29:54.427]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.427 --> 01:29:58.050]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.291 --> 01:30:04.293]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.293 --> 01:30:09.638]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.638 --> 01:30:11.679]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:16.683]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.683 --> 01:30:17.584]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.864 --> 01:30:18.985]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.985 --> 01:30:20.867]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.867 --> 01:30:21.947]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.947 --> 01:30:24.149]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:25.490]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:27.012]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:27.012 --> 01:30:32.276]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.276 --> 01:30:35.859]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.859 --> 01:30:39.342]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.682 --> 01:30:40.903]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.903 --> 01:30:41.804]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.804 --> 01:30:42.905]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.905 --> 01:30:43.845]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.845 --> 01:30:44.926]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.926 --> 01:30:47.989]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.989 --> 01:30:50.170]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:51.191]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.293 --> 01:31:05.600]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.683]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:31:07.683 --> 01:31:10.126]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.126 --> 01:31:12.409]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.409 --> 01:31:14.031]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:14.031 --> 01:31:15.053]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.293 --> 01:31:23.719]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.719 --> 01:31:31.164]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:31:31.164 --> 01:31:36.828]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:31:37.188 --> 01:31:43.210]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.210 --> 01:31:47.372]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.372 --> 01:31:53.234]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[01:31:53.234 --> 01:31:58.136]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:32:01.331 --> 01:32:02.632]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.632 --> 01:32:08.215]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:08.215 --> 01:32:13.237]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:13.237 --> 01:32:18.820]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:23.503]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:24.022 --> 01:32:31.147]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:31.147 --> 01:32:32.268]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:32.268 --> 01:32:38.953]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:42.155]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:42.155 --> 01:32:45.317]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:45.317 --> 01:32:45.517]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:54.076 --> 01:32:57.998]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:57.998 --> 01:33:11.743]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:11.743 --> 01:33:15.225]  There's a man going around taking names.
[01:33:15.225 --> 01:33:18.626]  They told us that NAFNGAP would be wonderful.
[01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:20.567]  They told us Iraq had WMDs.
[01:33:22.537 --> 01:33:28.463]  They told us that there wasn't healthcare rationing in the bills, but it's there.
[01:33:28.463 --> 01:33:29.984]  Crooks!
[01:33:29.984 --> 01:33:31.366]  Criminals!
[01:33:31.366 --> 01:33:37.612]  Nine times out of ten, more than 90% of the time get control of nations.
[01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.494]  We have a word for it.
[01:33:39.494 --> 01:33:40.735]  It's called tyranny.
[01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:51.878]  I'm going to do a news blitz right now, and then I'm going to go to your phone calls for everybody that is holding 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:51.878 --> 01:33:56.760]  I want to go over some economic numbers here in a moment.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:01.582]  We'll cover that more in the next hour and get into some of the other important news in my stack.
[01:34:01.582 --> 01:34:06.584]  But before I do that, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[01:34:06.584 --> 01:34:08.665]  One of them is the Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:34:08.665 --> 01:34:12.987]  It looks like a water cooler with a little computer readout on the front that doesn't have a water bottle on top.
[01:34:13.527 --> 01:34:18.049]  It grabs humidity out of the air and produces up to seven and a half gallons a day.
[01:34:18.049 --> 01:34:28.655]  And they've got a deal 20% off on their best-selling unit, the Ecola Blue 28 machine, running until next Monday at 5 p.m.
[01:34:28.655 --> 01:34:29.776]  You can give them a call at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:34:29.776 --> 01:34:31.136]  They can answer all of your questions.
[01:34:35.199 --> 01:34:38.402]  1-800-691-6043 or go to acolablue.com.
[01:34:38.402 --> 01:34:43.066]  That's www.ecoloblue.com.
[01:34:43.066 --> 01:34:46.428]  Check them out today.
[01:34:46.428 --> 01:34:48.130]  Also, with this entire police state,
[01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:52.711]  iPhones can shoot video.
[01:34:52.711 --> 01:34:55.413]  iPods Nano can shoot video.
[01:34:55.413 --> 01:34:59.877]  We got a sponsor that has great little pens that shoot video and audio.
[01:34:59.877 --> 01:35:01.298]  You just press one button.
[01:35:01.298 --> 01:35:03.000]  They're great because it's just one button to hit.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.584]  With an iPhone, you got to click through it and find it and go with it or they'll tell you to turn it off on an airplane.
[01:35:09.525 --> 01:35:27.398]  I suggest you go to Diginet.net and everybody start carrying these little pen cameras so if the stewardess comes and yells at you, and you even speak to her back, you get charged with the Patriot Act, that's in Politico today, where they're charging people every week that we know of with 20 years in prison if you argue in any way.
[01:35:27.398 --> 01:35:29.120]  And you don't have any record of what really happened.
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:30.921]  Same with the police.
[01:35:30.921 --> 01:35:40.485]  You are insane if you don't go to Diginet.net and buy their video sunglasses that have a tiny camera with a little memory chip in it.
[01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:44.186]  They've got Diginet.net pins and they've got the best prices out there.
[01:35:44.186 --> 01:35:45.807]  Diginet.net.
[01:35:45.807 --> 01:35:49.989]  That's Diginet.net or check out the banner on InfoWars.com.
[01:35:49.989 --> 01:35:51.029]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T.
[01:35:53.131 --> 01:35:56.076]  They've got a whole line of great products.
[01:35:56.076 --> 01:35:58.219]  Check them out at diginet.net.
[01:35:58.219 --> 01:36:01.224]  Do not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:01.224 --> 01:36:03.308]  Okay.
[01:36:03.308 --> 01:36:06.614]  We've got to fight Big Brother with Big Brother, my friends, and that is what we're doing.
[01:36:08.976 --> 01:36:11.980]  I want to hear from listeners about this.
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:23.653]  And again, I'm going to cover it more in the next hour, but we have a story at PrisonPlanet.com that's kind of a boil-down of the mainstream articles that are linked up on Drudge and other areas of EIF, Entertainment Industry Foundation.
[01:36:24.534 --> 01:36:28.515]  Billions of dollars from the federal government to implant messages.
[01:36:28.515 --> 01:36:32.297]  I call it propaganda placement when it's the government doing it, not product placement.
[01:36:32.297 --> 01:36:35.138]  I coined that term propaganda placement.
[01:36:35.138 --> 01:36:40.520]  ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, all affiliated broadcasting cable properties as well.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.060]  This is from the group.
[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:44.461]  This has been going on for a long time, but it's much worse now.
[01:36:44.461 --> 01:36:49.763]  Implanting messages about how great the president is, a new era of responsibility in the new government.
[01:36:50.303 --> 01:36:57.566]  Orchestrated depression, how we must have national compulsory service, the youth brigades, all of it.
[01:36:57.566 --> 01:37:00.867]  So we need to go over this more.
[01:37:00.867 --> 01:37:08.591]  If you want to read the article about the TV media consultant executive, big Washington insider,
[01:37:09.676 --> 01:37:12.479]  Tied in big with the neocons and the liberals.
[01:37:12.479 --> 01:37:22.330]  David Bass, a known Washington accomplished PR executive and TV commentator, a man with an impressive rolodex, charged under the Patriot Act for arguing with a stewardess quietly.
[01:37:22.330 --> 01:37:24.032]  They said he made an ugly face.
[01:37:24.032 --> 01:37:27.456]  That is in the affidavit why he's been indicted.
[01:37:27.456 --> 01:37:30.079]  So we have that report.
[01:37:31.909 --> 01:37:32.629]  Here for you.
[01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:35.391]  Also, woman disabled by flu shot reaction.
[01:37:35.391 --> 01:37:37.672]  Fox News out of D.C.
[01:37:37.672 --> 01:37:41.054]  They're now admitting, the doctors are admitting that it caused a neurological disorder.
[01:37:41.054 --> 01:37:45.556]  She's now partially paralyzed and having convulsions every 10 minutes.
[01:37:45.556 --> 01:37:50.078]  Cover that more next hour.
[01:37:50.078 --> 01:37:55.641]  But some of the other news I want to get to that is here in my stack today.
[01:37:57.086 --> 01:38:03.836]  Is this article Danish Prime Minister knew WTC attack would collapse?
[01:38:10.246 --> 01:38:13.029]  It's a top story on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:38:13.029 --> 01:38:17.633]  Danish Prime Minister knew WTC would collapse.
[01:38:17.633 --> 01:38:30.184]  During a recent interview on Danish television, the former Prime Minister of Denmark admitted that he received a message five to ten minutes before telling him that the South Tower of the World Trade Center was going to collapse.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:43.023]  Prompting questions as to why the victims and rescue personnel inside the building didn't get the same warning.
[01:38:43.023 --> 01:38:59.049]  Paul Nurup Rasmussen told Denmark's largest broadcast network television, the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, that before he walked into his office to hold a security meeting on the morning of 9-11, he got advanced knowledge of the South Tower's imminent collapse.
[01:38:59.049 --> 01:39:03.471]  And we've talked to folks that translated this from Danish, they've confirmed it's an exact translation.
[01:39:04.718 --> 01:39:06.459]  That we have in the video.
[01:39:06.459 --> 01:39:09.181]  I am told that the first tower has completely collapsed.
[01:39:09.181 --> 01:39:18.546]  I received a message 5-10 minutes before it physically happened saying there was impending danger the tower would collapse so I knew disaster was coming said Rasmussen.
[01:39:18.546 --> 01:39:23.209]  Rasmussen added that the imminent collapse of the building was confirmed as soon as he entered his office.
[01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:28.932]  The Danish Prime Minister was not the only high-level official to receive advance of knowledge that the World Trade Center was going to collapse.
[01:39:29.392 --> 01:39:45.744]  During an interview on 9-11 with ABC's Peter Jennings, the New York Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani stated, and we have his video clip under it, I went down to the scene and we set up the headquarters at 75 Berkeley Street, which was right there with the police commissioner and the fire commissioner, the head of emergency management.
[01:39:45.744 --> 01:39:53.070]  And we were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse, and it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building.
[01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:57.792]  So we were trapped in the building for five or ten minutes and finally found an exit and got out.
[01:39:57.792 --> 01:40:00.413]  Walked north and took a lot of people with us.
[01:40:00.413 --> 01:40:17.742]  In the eight years since the attack, Giuliani has failed to explain, first he denied he said it, how and why he received advanced knowledge of the unprecedented event and why that event warning was not passed on to those inside the towers who had been told to remain in the office via loudspeakers
[01:40:18.542 --> 01:40:23.367]  Run by building 7, the emergency city center, after the first plane struck at 8.46 AM.
[01:40:23.367 --> 01:40:23.767]  Some people...
[01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:39.432]  It's not clear how many returned to their offices after announcements on the building's emergency loudspeaker system that said it was safe to stay in the South Tower, reports USA Today.
[01:40:39.432 --> 01:40:45.773]  After the sub-headline, announcements caused deaths, adding that some that sounded like an order to return, not an option.
[01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:48.534]  Yes, they said, go to your chairs, or you'll get in trouble.
[01:40:48.534 --> 01:40:51.975]  This was all run by Building 7 with the CIA Command Base in it.
[01:40:51.975 --> 01:40:54.175]  That tower later fell at 5.25 p.m.
[01:40:54.175 --> 01:40:54.915]  Eastern Standard Time.
[01:40:58.595 --> 01:40:58.835]  I think?
[01:41:20.185 --> 01:41:28.390]  The same building giving the orders early in the day to stay at their desk, that it had fallen from fire into its own footprint, and completely collapsed.
[01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:30.851]  And they gave the cover story because of fire.
[01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:46.259]  Then they had bizarre operatives, who's no one been able to identify, clearly reading scripts, separately all over the news, at ground zero, as the towers fell, saying, yes, it fell from structural damage, the heat melted the steel.
[01:41:46.259 --> 01:41:48.901]  Not saying who they were, out putting the official story out.
[01:41:50.370 --> 01:42:03.381]  When BBC was first caught doing this, no one noticed for about two years after, or three years after 9-11, that they'd done these not live newscasts, but the archives were put out by BBC, so people went through them and watched them.
[01:42:03.381 --> 01:42:07.465]  They said, oh, we've lost the tapes, we didn't really report that, those were fake newscasts.
[01:42:07.465 --> 01:42:12.989]  Then they said, okay, we accidentally reported after it had fallen that had the timestamp wrong.
[01:42:12.989 --> 01:42:15.912]  They said, no, we just messed up, it did fall early.
[01:42:17.557 --> 01:42:27.725]  Then BBC made a documentary about it and said, actually, Reuters sent us an internal news feed saying it had fallen.
[01:42:27.725 --> 01:42:32.129]  This was just like with JFK in Australia, New Zealand, and Thailand.
[01:42:32.129 --> 01:42:45.280]  Newspapers reported in some cases an hour before he was even announced on the news, before he'd even been captured, that Lee Harvey Oswald had shot JFK in Dallas.
[01:42:46.514 --> 01:42:47.176]  In 1963.
[01:42:47.176 --> 01:42:56.292]  That is absolute 100% smoking gun fact.
[01:42:56.292 --> 01:42:57.454]  That it was an inside job.
[01:43:00.171 --> 01:43:09.936]  Giuliani also announced on the same TV show on ABC and CBS that it was a good thing they were doing a terror attack drill on the World Trade Center complex that day.
[01:43:09.936 --> 01:43:14.138]  So they had moved the night before the command center.
[01:43:14.138 --> 01:43:16.119]  The city emergency command center was in the building.
[01:43:16.119 --> 01:43:19.120]  The FBI, the CIA, Defense Intelligence and others as well.
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:26.303]  It was a huge government complex leased from Silverstein with all of his intelligence background.
[01:43:26.303 --> 01:43:27.484]  They said that they had
[01:43:29.426 --> 01:43:36.409]  Moved in an anti-terror drill to a mobile command center out on the pier the night before.
[01:43:36.409 --> 01:43:44.712]  Mr. Kennedy, the head spokesman for FEMA, that day also on ABC News said, yes, we were told to be there September 10th for the attack.
[01:43:44.712 --> 01:43:47.553]  He then lied and said he'd messed up the day, he was incorrect.
[01:43:47.553 --> 01:43:52.655]  But then later in testimony he had to admit that indeed they were running tripod to terror attack drill.
[01:43:56.718 --> 01:44:03.925]  Just like on the 7-7 bombing, the government was running a drill of the exact same trains and exact same bus being bombed at the exact same time.
[01:44:03.925 --> 01:44:05.747]  Who do we know this from?
[01:44:05.747 --> 01:44:16.018]  The former head spokesman of Scotland Yard, who was the private consultancy firm, Visor Consultancy, went on BBC, TV, radio and ITN on 7-7.
[01:44:17.978 --> 01:44:22.539]  In 2005, for the London bombings, within hours of it, and said, it's incredible.
[01:44:22.539 --> 01:44:27.041]  We were running a drill of the exact same locations being attacked at the exact same time.
[01:44:27.041 --> 01:44:31.462]  An actuary, by an insurance actuary expert, was done.
[01:44:31.462 --> 01:44:34.803]  It was one out of 23 tractogillian.
[01:44:34.803 --> 01:44:40.685]  Tractogillian is trillions of times more than all the grains of sand in the world.
[01:44:40.685 --> 01:44:43.386]  Nearing infinity.
[01:44:43.386 --> 01:44:45.767]  Theoretically, it is infinity.
[01:44:49.744 --> 01:44:51.625]  Now, you don't question 9-11?
[01:44:51.625 --> 01:44:58.108]  That's why six of the ten 9-11 commissioners have come out saying it was, quote, a cover-up, a takeover, a lie.
[01:44:58.108 --> 01:45:06.932]  Farmer, the head lawyer, says it's a criminal cover-up and a book coming out that the Pentagon was lying, the White House was lying, and there should be a criminal investigation.
[01:45:06.932 --> 01:45:15.016]  Now, don't sit there and call me a tinfoil hat wearer when I just gave you all that information.
[01:45:15.016 --> 01:45:16.697]  Now, I'm going to play this just for record.
[01:45:19.807 --> 01:45:22.529]  Now this is subtitled Dutch, but it's short.
[01:45:22.529 --> 01:45:25.973]  I'm going to play the Danish Prime Minister at the time.
[01:45:25.973 --> 01:45:31.277]  This is him now on television, saying that they were told the towers were going to fall before they fell.
[01:45:31.277 --> 01:45:34.961]  Then we're going to play Giuliani clip after that.
[01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:35.381]  Here it is.
[01:45:35.381 --> 01:45:44.049]  At the same time, the current Prime Minister Paul Nyrup Rasmussen enters the State Department to hold a security council meeting.
[01:45:45.715 --> 01:45:53.462]  Somewhat at the moment I enter the prime minister's office, I find out that the first tower has now completely collapsed.
[01:45:53.462 --> 01:46:06.152]  I get a message, I think, five, five, five, five, ten minutes before it physically happens, that now there is an overhanging risk that the towers will collapse.
[01:46:06.152 --> 01:46:12.698]  So I knew the disaster was on its way, and then I finally confirmed it at the moment I enter, I think, the house.
[01:46:14.898 --> 01:46:19.616]  Alright, here's Rudolph Giuliani on ABC News saying basically the same thing.
[01:46:21.297 --> 01:46:22.357]  And it's just amazing.
[01:46:22.357 --> 01:46:24.458]  Peter Giuliani is with us at the moment.
[01:46:24.458 --> 01:46:25.458]  Mr. Mayor, can you hear me?
[01:46:25.458 --> 01:46:26.178]  I can, Peter.
[01:46:26.178 --> 01:46:32.940]  Mr. Mayor, I saw you several times on the street today, and it looked like you were deeply sharing the horror that all of us feel.
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:39.802]  But I'd really appreciate, aside from, on top of your sentiments about all this, give us some sense of what's going on.
[01:46:39.802 --> 01:46:42.863]  What's going on now is a massive rescue effort.
[01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:49.565]  We have thousands of police officers and firefighters in all of Manhattan trying to rescue as many people as we possibly can.
[01:46:50.751 --> 01:46:56.014]  There are still a lot of people there that are injured, hurt, dazed, and we're trying to get them out.
[01:46:56.014 --> 01:47:01.016]  And we're mobilizing all of our fire, police, and emergency resources to do that.
[01:47:01.016 --> 01:47:08.920]  The governor has alerted the National Guard, and they're being deployed to come and relieve us early to late this afternoon.
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:15.123]  And the urban search and rescue teams are coming here from around the country to also assist us.
[01:47:15.123 --> 01:47:18.825]  But until then, which means until probably 2, 3, 4 o'clock this afternoon,
[01:47:19.648 --> 01:47:30.459]  Our police department, our fire department, and our emergency people are being stretched to the limit, and I'm sure we've also lost a significant number of them.
[01:47:30.459 --> 01:47:36.404]  You're reluctant, I assume, to put any other name attached to the casualties except significant.
[01:47:36.404 --> 01:47:40.328]  Do you believe it's hundreds or thousands?
[01:47:40.328 --> 01:47:43.091]  I really don't want to say right now, Peter.
[01:47:43.091 --> 01:47:44.052]  I think it's going to be
[01:47:45.446 --> 01:47:46.947]  A horrible number.
[01:47:46.947 --> 01:47:49.188]  I saw people jumping out of the World Trade Center.
[01:47:49.188 --> 01:47:57.591]  I saw some of the firefighters who I know going into the building, so... And we were in a building in which we were trapped for about 10-15 minutes.
[01:47:57.591 --> 01:48:01.733]  Are you talking about the... Did you go immediately to the Office of Emergency Management?
[01:48:01.733 --> 01:48:10.416]  I went down to the scene and we set up headquarters at 75 Barclay Street, which was right there with the police commissioner, the fire commissioner, the head of emergency management.
[01:48:10.416 --> 01:48:11.677]  And we were operating out of there.
[01:48:12.412 --> 01:48:15.973]  When we were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse.
[01:48:15.973 --> 01:48:18.694]  And it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building.
[01:48:18.694 --> 01:48:26.677]  So we were trapped in the building for 10-15 minutes and finally found an exit and got out, walked north, and took a lot of people with us.
[01:48:26.677 --> 01:48:35.300]  My question is, the Office of Emergency Management headquarters into which you put enormous effort for coordination in a disaster like this, has it been damaged?
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:36.301]  Is it still operating?
[01:48:36.301 --> 01:48:37.101]  It's gone?
[01:48:37.101 --> 01:48:40.082]  It's been damaged, I don't know how badly.
[01:48:41.011 --> 01:48:49.758]  And right now, that whole area of Manhattan, including the police department, which is another area we would operate from, City Hall, is another area we would operate from, have been closed off.
[01:48:49.758 --> 01:48:55.602]  So we've moved to a secure location in Midtown Manhattan, where we're operating city government.
[01:48:55.602 --> 01:49:02.007]  Is it fair to say, do you think, that all of your drills for dealing with terrorism and disaster are going according to plan?
[01:49:02.007 --> 01:49:08.012]  Or has this been of such magnitude that we've just all been caught totally off balance?
[01:49:08.012 --> 01:49:10.013]  Oh, there's no question we were all caught totally off balance.
[01:49:10.013 --> 01:49:10.174]  No one
[01:49:11.249 --> 01:49:19.797]  No one could possibly expect large airplanes to crash into the World Trade Center the way this happened.
[01:49:19.797 --> 01:49:31.026]  I think having said that, as I watched what the police officers and the firefighters were doing, I think they're going to save the maximum number of lives you could possibly save in a situation like this.
[01:49:31.026 --> 01:49:37.973]  I mean, the emergency efforts that they've been going through over the last two, two and a half hours are nothing short of
[01:49:39.196 --> 01:49:39.997]  Inspiring.
[01:49:39.997 --> 01:49:43.099]  And when the National Guard comes in, what did you say to take over?
[01:49:43.099 --> 01:49:49.685]  I wanted to play it in the full unedited clip because people always say that, you know, we're editing this.
[01:49:49.685 --> 01:49:52.907]  But there it is from the live feed that morning, that day.
[01:49:52.907 --> 01:50:01.655]  And we've got clip after clip after clip of firemen and police on video.
[01:50:01.655 --> 01:50:04.017]  And they're in my film Terror Storm.
[01:50:04.017 --> 01:50:06.318]  They're in the film Truth Rising on 9-11.
[01:50:08.956 --> 01:50:09.717]  Covering 9-11.
[01:50:09.717 --> 01:50:18.563]  And the police and firemen are saying, we've been told to get back, they're going to blow up Building 7.
[01:50:18.563 --> 01:50:19.704]  They're going to bring it down.
[01:50:19.704 --> 01:50:24.587]  And I've interviewed those police officers and firemen and medical workers on this show.
[01:50:24.587 --> 01:50:28.130]  I've gone to New York and interviewed them.
[01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:29.271]  I've had them on the radio.
[01:50:31.403 --> 01:50:34.625]  And the 9-11 truth debunkers say, oh, you're saying they did the attacks.
[01:50:34.625 --> 01:50:35.746]  That's how they spin it.
[01:50:35.746 --> 01:50:37.327]  No, they were told to get back.
[01:50:37.327 --> 01:50:39.769]  You can't ignore these videos.
[01:50:39.769 --> 01:50:42.190]  It's live on CNN and Fox saying, get back.
[01:50:42.190 --> 01:50:43.892]  They say they're going to blow it up.
[01:50:43.892 --> 01:50:45.833]  Run for your lives.
[01:50:45.833 --> 01:50:47.994]  We're not supposed to question this.
[01:50:47.994 --> 01:50:56.040]  The government's done all these medical experiments on veterans and troops and on foster kids, killing them with biologicals, radiologicals in the past.
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:58.522]  They wouldn't kill 3,000 people on 9-11.
[01:50:58.522 --> 01:50:59.482]  They radiated more than 4,000 kids.
[01:51:01.121 --> 01:51:07.847]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:51:07.847 --> 01:51:09.508]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:51:09.508 --> 01:51:14.092]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:51:14.092 --> 01:51:21.778]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:51:21.778 --> 01:51:24.240]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:26.641]  And has no dangerous second-hand smoke.
[01:51:26.641 --> 01:51:28.582]  So it's safe for the people around you.
[01:51:28.582 --> 01:51:32.884]  And will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.
[01:51:32.884 --> 01:51:36.586]  So, get rid of the ashtrays, the smell, and the smoke.

[01:52:01.667 --> 01:52:07.711]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.711 --> 01:52:13.596]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.596 --> 01:52:19.740]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:22.042]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.042 --> 01:52:24.504]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:37.694]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.694 --> 01:52:39.375]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.375 --> 01:52:41.237]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.237 --> 01:52:47.462]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:48.132 --> 01:52:51.933]  Friends, this is Big Jim Farmer, urging you to go to ejseed.com and purchase the Big Seed Bank.
[01:52:51.933 --> 01:52:56.394]  It contains 35 varieties of heirloom seeds that will provide you and your family delicious vegetables for years.
[01:52:56.394 --> 01:52:56.934]  These seeds have
[01:53:16.019 --> 01:53:16.880]  No GMOs.
[01:53:40.486 --> 01:53:40.846]  I think so.
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:33.022]  This is it!
[01:54:33.022 --> 01:54:34.864]  Fall of the Republic premieres!
[01:54:36.286 --> 01:54:41.789]  Next Wednesday, October 21st in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:41.789 --> 01:54:46.951]  The Obama Deception has been attacked by George Soros and all his publications.
[01:54:46.951 --> 01:54:49.532]  It's been attacked by the New Republic.
[01:54:49.532 --> 01:54:50.953]  It's been attacked by Salon.
[01:54:51.693 --> 01:54:57.358]  And they admit it's been devastating, this New World Order frontman who's meant to bankrupt our economy and bring in world government.
[01:54:57.358 --> 01:55:02.403]  Well, Fall of the Republic goes even further and shows you who the real enemy is, the foreign offshore banks.
[01:55:02.403 --> 01:55:05.225]  Pre-order it at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:05.225 --> 01:55:11.010]  I now want to go back to... It's not really a pre-order now, it's going to be shipping out next week, so get in line, folks.
[01:55:11.010 --> 01:55:12.752]  It ships out in the order they're received.
[01:55:12.752 --> 01:55:16.235]  Let's go back to your phone calls, and Bob Chapman's coming up at the 8 after.
[01:55:16.235 --> 01:55:17.636]  Let's talk to Paul in Oregon.
[01:55:17.636 --> 01:55:18.597]  Paul, good to hear from you.
[01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:24.212]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:55:24.212 --> 01:55:28.454]  My kids brought home a waiver yesterday from school.
[01:55:28.454 --> 01:55:36.398]  And the school is wanting the kids to use a new kind of hand sanitizer called benzalconium chloride.
[01:55:36.398 --> 01:55:47.223]  And when I looked this up, first thing I find is an article from 2000 where three doctors got together and they're calling for a worldwide ban of this substance.
[01:55:48.331 --> 01:55:52.973]  Um, my wife also looked it up and found that it was actually, uh, developed by the U.S.
[01:55:52.973 --> 01:55:59.835]  military to clean surfaces, not for people.
[01:55:59.835 --> 01:56:01.495]  This is huge news!
[01:56:01.495 --> 01:56:05.216]  What's the name of the toxic sanitizer?
[01:56:05.216 --> 01:56:12.479]  Benzalkonium Chloride, in the form of the DEB Instant Foam Hand Sanitizer.
[01:56:12.479 --> 01:56:16.680]  And they want the kids to use it for several times a day, and when you read it up on it,
[01:56:17.088 --> 01:56:20.970]  It stays on your skin for up to two hours, activating on your skin.
[01:56:20.970 --> 01:56:26.473]  Well, number one, this is a very complex, sophisticated, key issue you just brought up.
[01:56:26.473 --> 01:56:32.237]  Number one, the federal government buys all this crap and then has to dump it somewhere, so they dump it on the schools.
[01:56:32.237 --> 01:56:41.642]  Number two, nurses, over 70% now in major states, like New York, it was 65% a week ago, are refusing any of the flu shots.
[01:56:42.708 --> 01:56:43.008]  We're good
[01:57:04.847 --> 01:57:17.212]  In the future, and in future outbreaks and staged events and fear-mongering for forced quarantine, and they've got the executive orders on the books to enforce it unconstitutionally if they want.
[01:57:17.212 --> 01:57:21.154]  But, look how they have fluoride water for kids.
[01:57:21.154 --> 01:57:24.255]  Look at how they try to give kids in public school the fluoride tablets.
[01:57:24.255 --> 01:57:28.617]  Just Google, fluoride doubles bone cancer in children.
[01:57:28.617 --> 01:57:30.598]  Look, I mean, it's a fact.
[01:57:30.598 --> 01:57:31.598]  They know what they're doing.
[01:57:31.598 --> 01:57:32.859]  The school teachers don't know.
[01:57:34.062 --> 01:57:39.125]  And yes, if you don't want to take the flu shot, and they try to lie and say it's the law, then you demand the waiver.
[01:57:39.125 --> 01:57:43.568]  Then they give you the waiver and say, okay, you gotta wear a mask, you gotta use this stuff on you.
[01:57:43.568 --> 01:57:51.813]  You need to scan that and fax that, email it to Aaron at InfoWars.com, send it to Paul Watson's email, to Kurt.
[01:57:51.813 --> 01:57:56.797]  Write a blurb about the school, where this is happening, your take on it.
[01:57:56.797 --> 01:58:03.281]  You can call yourself John Doe if you want, but scan it in, send it to us, please, because I want to get this up.
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:05.901]  Okay, what was that again?
[01:58:05.901 --> 01:58:06.401]  What was that?
[01:58:06.401 --> 01:58:08.023]  Aaron at Infowars?
[01:58:08.023 --> 01:58:10.404]  Aaron at Infowars.
[01:58:10.404 --> 01:58:11.645]  But he's about to go out of town actually.
[01:58:11.645 --> 01:58:14.848]  I'm sending him to do an interview for a film.
[01:58:14.848 --> 01:58:19.211]  I'm gonna put you on hold and give you an email to check.
[01:58:19.211 --> 01:58:21.893]  We're gonna do that right now.
[01:58:21.893 --> 01:58:23.915]  Anything else, sir?
[01:58:23.915 --> 01:58:24.475]  One more thing.
[01:58:24.475 --> 01:58:29.459]  My grandfather has a copy of the congressional record from when Bush was in office.
[01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:33.063]  Uh, they are planning on confiscating the gold.
[01:58:33.063 --> 01:58:38.889]  People are going to be buying up gold right now, and then they're going to, just like they did in, I think, the 20s or 30s.
[01:58:38.889 --> 01:58:39.690]  Stay there.
[01:58:39.690 --> 01:58:43.314]  Stay there.
[01:58:43.314 --> 01:58:45.836]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.836 --> 01:58:48.139]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.759 --> 01:58:55.003]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:55.003 --> 01:58:57.005]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:57.005 --> 01:59:05.534]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.534 --> 01:59:11.079]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:11.079 --> 01:59:12.701]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.921 --> 01:59:19.443]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.443 --> 01:59:30.488]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.488 --> 01:59:31.268]  That's right.
[01:59:31.268 --> 01:59:33.829]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.829 --> 01:59:35.409]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.810]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.841 --> 02:00:08.602]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.602 --> 02:00:10.363]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.363 --> 02:00:11.944]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.944 --> 02:00:13.504]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.504 --> 02:00:17.686]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.686 --> 02:00:27.671]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.671 --> 02:00:32.694]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com is waiting in the wings
[02:00:36.559 --> 02:00:39.440]  Join us live in the next segment.
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.440]  We're going to break down what's happening in the economy.
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:47.481]  They've gone from discussing killing the dollar to now beginning the murder of the currency.
[02:00:47.481 --> 02:00:50.922]  It's being run by DC and London.
[02:00:50.922 --> 02:00:51.622]  That's coming up.
[02:00:51.622 --> 02:00:57.804]  We're going to continue with your phone calls throughout this hour with Annie, Chris, Mike, Norman and others.
[02:00:57.804 --> 02:00:58.904]  Paul in Oregon
[02:01:00.452 --> 02:01:05.316]  I'm saying what it is is my wife found something on the internet that said it had been created by the military as an industrial cleaner and then I found
[02:01:31.198 --> 02:01:45.551]  I found an article on the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology website from 2000 where doctors got together and they're trying to call for a worldwide ban on this substance.
[02:01:45.551 --> 02:01:46.852]  So it's a toxin?
[02:01:46.852 --> 02:01:47.873]  What's the name of this again?
[02:01:47.873 --> 02:01:49.534]  It sounds horrid.
[02:01:49.534 --> 02:01:53.037]  It's called benzalkonium chloride.
[02:01:53.037 --> 02:01:54.899]  Benzalkonium chloride.
[02:01:55.779 --> 02:01:57.739]  Man, that is serious.
[02:01:57.739 --> 02:02:11.843]  Do me a favor, send the links or write a two paragraph blurb making those points with the links to that medical journal and we'll get that up because if that's happening in your area of Oregon, where are you in Oregon?
[02:02:11.843 --> 02:02:14.123]  Gresham.
[02:02:14.123 --> 02:02:14.783]  Tell us the town.
[02:02:14.783 --> 02:02:18.184]  You don't have to say your name or the school, but what's the town?
[02:02:18.184 --> 02:02:19.584]  It's in Gresham, Oregon.
[02:02:19.584 --> 02:02:21.885]  It's in the Gresham Barlow School District.
[02:02:21.885 --> 02:02:23.085]  The school is Hogan Theaters.
[02:02:23.755 --> 02:02:27.576]  I'm sure the other schools in the district are going to do the same thing.
[02:02:27.576 --> 02:02:29.137]  Unbelievable.
[02:02:29.137 --> 02:02:40.281]  I also wanted to make the point that they've been, even though we signed a form saying we did not want our children getting fluoride, they've been giving our children fluoride anyway.
[02:02:40.281 --> 02:02:42.662]  What, the fluoride tablets?
[02:02:42.662 --> 02:02:44.722]  Yeah, the tablets, yeah.
[02:02:44.722 --> 02:02:46.303]  Have you told your children not to take it?
[02:02:46.303 --> 02:02:48.204]  It's on your teeth.
[02:02:48.204 --> 02:02:49.024]  The kind you ingest.
[02:02:53.737 --> 02:02:55.199]  The school's giving him fluoride.
[02:02:55.199 --> 02:03:07.271]  Well, you go into the stores and it's fluoride water for kids, and it doesn't matter how many toxicologists, how many scientists, how many doctors I have on, the studies show it has a doubly bad effect, on average, on children.
[02:03:08.089 --> 02:03:09.510]  That it does on adults.
[02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:11.071]  It is so toxic.
[02:03:11.071 --> 02:03:13.033]  We've gotten a tour of the Austin Water Treatment.
[02:03:13.033 --> 02:03:17.777]  They admit hundreds of chemicals are put in the water under the name of fluoride.
[02:03:17.777 --> 02:03:22.181]  The chemicals they ship in come from fertilizer manufacturing plants.
[02:03:22.181 --> 02:03:24.342]  It's the toxic waste byproduct.
[02:03:24.342 --> 02:03:25.363]  And they just dump it in the water.
[02:03:25.363 --> 02:03:27.425]  Now on your issue of gold confiscation,
[02:03:28.772 --> 02:03:30.273]  They can steal your house.
[02:03:30.273 --> 02:03:31.354]  They can steal your children.
[02:03:31.354 --> 02:03:35.337]  But you don't not have children because the government might steal them.
[02:03:35.337 --> 02:03:37.339]  You fight the tyranny.
[02:03:37.339 --> 02:03:40.141]  But yes, they did have gold confiscation in 1933.
[02:03:40.141 --> 02:03:45.905]  My grandmother remembers in Dallas when the orders went out for people to turn in their gold currency for paper.
[02:03:45.905 --> 02:03:49.248]  Then the government literally shipped it all to Europe.
[02:03:49.248 --> 02:03:51.990]  A massive gold finger level heist.
[02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:53.031]  And yes, the government
[02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:54.680]  Okay.
[02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:25.582]  What's that email I need to send this to again?
[02:04:25.582 --> 02:04:26.562]  I'm sorry.
[02:04:26.562 --> 02:04:30.945]  I'm going to put you on hold and we're going to send it to you right now.
[02:04:30.945 --> 02:04:36.669]  We're going to come back with Bob Chapman getting into the economy and a bunch of other police state news with Bob as well.
[02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:39.991]  And we're going to be taking your phone calls, as I said, at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:39.991 --> 02:04:42.052]  And at the bottom of the hour, we're going to premiere The Fifth.
[02:04:46.218 --> 02:04:52.084]  And final trailer, the Police State trailer from the Police State section of Fall of the Republic.
[02:04:52.084 --> 02:04:56.829]  Fall of the Republic comes to the InfoWars next Wednesday, October 21st.
[02:04:56.829 --> 02:04:58.771]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:00.768 --> 02:05:04.149]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:07.770]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.770 --> 02:05:12.332]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.332 --> 02:05:17.934]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.234 --> 02:05:22.998]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.998 --> 02:05:26.621]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.

[02:06:35.686 --> 02:06:37.448]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.448 --> 02:06:39.971]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.

[02:07:01.121 --> 02:07:04.124]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.124 --> 02:07:09.469]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.469 --> 02:07:11.511]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.511 --> 02:07:16.516]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.516 --> 02:07:17.437]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.677 --> 02:07:18.798]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.798 --> 02:07:20.699]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:21.760]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:23.961]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.961 --> 02:07:25.302]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.302 --> 02:07:26.843]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.843 --> 02:07:32.106]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.106 --> 02:07:35.689]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.689 --> 02:07:39.151]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.511 --> 02:07:40.732]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.732 --> 02:07:41.633]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.633 --> 02:07:42.733]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.733 --> 02:07:43.674]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.674 --> 02:07:44.755]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.755 --> 02:07:47.817]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.817 --> 02:07:49.918]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[02:07:55.342 --> 02:07:58.965]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:58.965 --> 02:08:06.610]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.610 --> 02:08:08.912]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:20.148 --> 02:08:21.329]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:21.329 --> 02:08:25.714]  We are live on this Friday, the 16th day of October 2009 edition.
[02:08:25.714 --> 02:08:31.880]  We're now eight and a half minutes into the third hour of another hour coming up.
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.782]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:33.782 --> 02:08:34.462]  to 3 p.m.
[02:08:34.462 --> 02:08:35.323]  Central Time.
[02:08:35.323 --> 02:08:36.184]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:08:38.564 --> 02:08:44.665]  And we are joined by Bob Chapman, the founder of the International Forecaster.
[02:08:44.665 --> 02:08:45.966]  He worked in Army Intelligence.
[02:08:45.966 --> 02:08:49.507]  He then had one of the biggest newsletters in history until he retired.
[02:08:49.507 --> 02:08:56.668]  He came back out of retirement to restart his financial newsletter, and his predictions are some of the most accurate and stunning out there.
[02:08:56.668 --> 02:08:59.169]  He was one of the biggest private gold and silver brokers ever.
[02:08:59.989 --> 02:09:05.173]  He helped publish Gary Allen's None Dare Call a Conspiracy in the early 1970s.
[02:09:05.173 --> 02:09:09.717]  He is a real icon in the fight against the globalists for the last 45 years.
[02:09:09.717 --> 02:09:12.559]  And today is his 74th?
[02:09:12.559 --> 02:09:15.521]  Or is it 75th birthday?
[02:09:15.521 --> 02:09:17.643]  How old are you today, Bob?
[02:09:17.643 --> 02:09:22.827]  I'm 74 and I'm happy to report that I'm healthy and everything works.
[02:09:22.827 --> 02:09:23.948]  That's awesome.
[02:09:23.948 --> 02:09:28.892]  Look, I don't want to toot your horn here, but I want people to pay attention to what you're saying.
[02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:37.074]  Everything you've talked about years before and you call it when it's going to happen is now happening.
[02:09:37.074 --> 02:09:45.739]  You called two years ago on this show that late 2009-2010 early was when they'd start really killing the dollar.
[02:09:45.739 --> 02:09:47.580]  You called the stock market going back up.
[02:09:48.502 --> 02:09:54.785]  Two years ago, you said it would go down in a year, then it would go back up in 2009, that it would then go down again.
[02:09:54.785 --> 02:09:58.466]  You called that gold, by the fall, would run up well above a thousand.
[02:09:58.466 --> 02:10:09.771]  I mean, I want the crystal ball you've got, but also on top of all this, Bob Chapman, I want listeners, not our mainline listeners, but the show's growing by leaps and bounds.
[02:10:09.771 --> 02:10:12.272]  All these new listeners on all these new AM and FM stations, understand,
[02:10:13.052 --> 02:10:14.814]  We're just going off the documents.
[02:10:14.814 --> 02:10:21.521]  The Club of Rome, the Bank of England, all these, the Private Federal Reserve have said they're setting up a Bank of the World, we'll pay carbon taxes too.
[02:10:21.521 --> 02:10:23.303]  They are the ones killing the dollar.
[02:10:23.303 --> 02:10:25.625]  They are the ones that have stolen tens of trillions.
[02:10:25.625 --> 02:10:34.834]  They are the ones setting up a police state to stop the American and British and other people from taking our government back and bringing these made-off slash, uh, skillings slash
[02:10:36.015 --> 02:10:38.276]  Uh, Ken Lay types to justice.
[02:10:38.276 --> 02:10:53.642]  So either these guys take over the world through their Ponzi scheme fraud, that's the New World Order, it's tyranny, set up their Bank of the World, which they're now calling for, banks, the private banks to have the regulatory power over all businesses, that's even on Napolitano's Fox News show.
[02:10:53.642 --> 02:10:55.743]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:10:55.743 --> 02:11:00.465]  I want people to realize the magnitude of, we're not saying the New World Order's coming now.
[02:11:01.555 --> 02:11:04.543]  It's now here, and it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[02:11:04.543 --> 02:11:08.092]  So I want to lay out what their master plan is, who they are.
[02:11:09.474 --> 02:11:15.497]  What their economic warfare operation is, and what the death of the dollar is going to look like.
[02:11:15.497 --> 02:11:23.441]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury, former Wall Street Journal editor, the father of Reaganomics, he said he believes it's irreversible.
[02:11:23.441 --> 02:11:25.482]  He now agrees it's by design.
[02:11:25.482 --> 02:11:29.464]  Two years ago he knew they were doing it, but couldn't come to that realization.
[02:11:29.464 --> 02:11:32.505]  They're now openly, Soros is openly bragging.
[02:11:32.505 --> 02:11:36.948]  I mean, this is so incredible, and I want people to realize we are now here.
[02:11:38.028 --> 02:11:44.389]  The hell is now going to begin while they're simultaneously telling us we have a jobless recovery and everything's wonderful.
[02:11:44.389 --> 02:11:46.110]  Bob Chapman.
[02:11:46.110 --> 02:11:48.130]  Everything is not wonderful.
[02:11:48.130 --> 02:11:51.451]  And we're not going to get a recovery.
[02:11:51.451 --> 02:11:53.411]  And it's as simple as that.
[02:11:53.411 --> 02:12:03.813]  If you remember back in January, I said that I thought that by the end of the year, the people in Washington and Wall Street would be talking about
[02:12:04.326 --> 02:12:06.767]  Another stimulus plan, and now they are.
[02:12:06.767 --> 02:12:08.867]  They're talking in terms of $200 billion.
[02:12:08.867 --> 02:12:11.567]  I projected $2 trillion.
[02:12:11.567 --> 02:12:15.328]  And that's what they need to make this thing continue to hum.
[02:12:15.328 --> 02:12:22.950]  And so, let's see what they come up with, but I think there's a good chance there's going to be another stimulus program.
[02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:28.831]  It'll be larger than the one that they did, which is $787 billion.
[02:12:28.831 --> 02:12:31.712]  We'll say $800 billion.
[02:12:31.712 --> 02:12:34.032]  It just really hasn't done hardly anything.
[02:12:34.577 --> 02:12:35.838]  Two reasons.
[02:12:35.838 --> 02:12:39.500]  They're not really creating anything, they're just throwing money at the problem.
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:43.702]  And number two, the layout of the plan was done extremely poorly.
[02:12:43.702 --> 02:12:57.670]  It was done politically, and now they're very afraid that the stimulus plan is not going to carry the economy in a positive mode into the election, and they're scrambling to get more money.
[02:12:57.670 --> 02:12:59.971]  The key to all of this is money.
[02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:03.930]  The key is the control of the production of money.
[02:13:03.930 --> 02:13:10.452]  And that's done by the Federal Reserve, the private corporation, and it's also done by the Bank of England.
[02:13:10.452 --> 02:13:16.914]  And yes, as Alex said, they are now expediting into a world currency.
[02:13:16.914 --> 02:13:28.077]  Whether it'll be an SDR, Special Depository Receipt, which is issued by the IMF, or whether it'll be a basket of currencies, say the G20,
[02:13:29.553 --> 02:13:32.915]  Uh, with a small gold backing of 10 to 15%.
[02:13:32.915 --> 02:13:44.663]  We don't know yet, but that's where they're headed, so that they can have an international trading unit, and they intend to follow that by having an international one-world currency.
[02:13:45.089 --> 02:13:53.253]  Now Bob, for new listeners that don't understand, they're not going to see some gold or purple or blue money day one.
[02:13:53.253 --> 02:14:11.581]  We'll still have our regional currencies, euro, dollar, dollarized Canada and Mexico, but they've announced the G20, the new bank of the world, will set currency values which will allow the insiders to even engage in bigger Ponzi schemes and manipulations.
[02:14:11.581 --> 02:14:12.182]  They will set
[02:14:12.942 --> 02:14:13.302]  I think so.
[02:14:36.903 --> 02:14:40.025]  Well, it's the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are the two keys.
[02:14:40.025 --> 02:14:41.486]  But I look at this from a psycho-political aspect.
[02:14:41.486 --> 02:14:43.588]  They are going to go into inflation, higher inflation.
[02:15:06.187 --> 02:15:11.851]  Real inflation right now is 6.11%.
[02:15:11.851 --> 02:15:15.993]  And those are John Williams' figures, incidentally.
[02:15:15.993 --> 02:15:18.615]  You can look at it at 6.01% as well.
[02:15:18.615 --> 02:15:24.118]  There's two ways of getting to the conclusion of the product.
[02:15:24.118 --> 02:15:26.800]  And so that's going to increase.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:30.022]  We'll probably see over the next year and a half, while they're preparing
[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:34.602]  This international trading unit, they call.
[02:15:34.602 --> 02:15:56.994]  And this evolutionary process will continue to cause inflation until they decide to pull the plug and go to deflation and go to the international unit and to see the dollar go to 40 on the USDX.
[02:15:56.994 --> 02:15:57.914]  Today it's around 75-75.
[02:16:00.228 --> 02:16:06.691]  So you can see that we're not all that far away, and it's come down from 124.
[02:16:06.691 --> 02:16:09.092]  And so what are we looking at?
[02:16:09.092 --> 02:16:22.299]  We're looking at probably another 40% to 50% change in the value of the dollar, the value of the dollar versus six major currencies.
[02:16:22.299 --> 02:16:24.240]  And that's, they're weighted against each other.
[02:16:24.767 --> 02:16:29.749]  And so this is where we're headed in the immediate future.
[02:16:29.749 --> 02:16:38.193]  Alex and I and Paul Craig Roberts were on together and we both said two to three years.
[02:16:38.193 --> 02:16:41.894]  Well, I think we're down to one and a half to two right now.
[02:16:41.894 --> 02:16:44.235]  And that's when I think they're going to stick it in.
[02:16:44.235 --> 02:16:46.456]  And so what does that put us?
[02:16:46.456 --> 02:16:49.197]  Mid 2011 to the end of 2011, somewhere in there.
[02:16:51.243 --> 02:16:53.324]  Let me break this down for people.
[02:16:53.324 --> 02:16:57.127]  Let me throw a question in here.
[02:16:57.127 --> 02:17:17.381]  The method to the madness, having big Bilderberg Group, big New World Order owned, Reuters, Financial Times of London, Wall Street Journal come out and take the shock off so there isn't a big panic and start announcing we've got to devalue the dollar, it's going to happen incrementally,
[02:17:18.683 --> 02:17:22.838]  Uh, National Post reported, New York Post reported yesterday that
[02:17:25.486 --> 02:17:38.830]  You know, the dollar is no longer the world reserve currency, saying that China, India, Russia, Europe and others still have the majority dollars, but now the majority of their new purchases are euros and another basket.
[02:17:38.830 --> 02:17:52.775]  And so it seems they're just acclimating everyone, so Americans just accept the devaluation of the currency, rising prices, while we have depression in the real economy, so losing your job, lower wages, while
[02:17:53.715 --> 02:17:59.120]  The economy falls apart.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:04.144]  So that's worse than the Great Depression, where it was a depression in prices and a depression in wages.
[02:18:04.144 --> 02:18:08.307]  We're talking about hyper-stag inflation here.
[02:18:08.307 --> 02:18:11.970]  And so I guess, why are they now announcing, okay, we are getting rid of the dollar?
[02:18:11.970 --> 02:18:13.011]  Is that just to get everybody ready?
[02:18:13.011 --> 02:18:15.093]  Yes, it is.
[02:18:15.093 --> 02:18:17.655]  And I think the piece that was done by Fisk
[02:18:18.464 --> 02:18:32.754]  This past week, which dealt with secret meetings among those who didn't want the dollar anymore, such as Russia, China, India, the Arab states, Brazil, Venezuela, Iran.
[02:18:32.754 --> 02:18:37.778]  That was deliberately leaked by him, that he was told to do that.
[02:18:37.778 --> 02:18:39.459]  And that was conditioning.
[02:18:40.286 --> 02:18:42.248]  They're going to ease it down.
[02:18:42.248 --> 02:18:43.889]  It's going down.
[02:18:43.889 --> 02:18:46.031]  They'll do the dialectics with it.
[02:18:46.031 --> 02:18:51.895]  You know, one step forward, two steps back, three steps forward, one step back.
[02:18:51.895 --> 02:18:54.397]  And that's the way they're going to take it down.
[02:18:54.397 --> 02:19:02.184]  And it'll encompass probably about a year and a half before it hits bottom, whether it's at 40 or 55 on the USDX.
[02:19:02.184 --> 02:19:06.347]  And in the meantime, the gold and silver are just going to go bonkers.
[02:19:06.972 --> 02:19:20.496]  Gold and silver have already broken out, and we're headed probably, the first major stop will be around $1,650 to $1,700, and then it'll go higher after that.
[02:19:20.496 --> 02:19:23.757]  And I don't expect any confiscation.
[02:19:23.757 --> 02:19:25.878]  Less than 3% of Americans own gold.
[02:19:26.583 --> 02:19:28.264]  They wouldn't waste their time.
[02:19:28.264 --> 02:19:33.707]  They can go over and take over the GLD, which is the exchange-traded fund.
[02:19:33.707 --> 02:19:43.872]  They supposedly have 1,058 tons of gold, and there's some other entities that can be grabbed as well, and they can have all the gold that they want doing that.
[02:19:45.543 --> 02:19:48.948]  Yeah, back in 1933, money was gold and silver.
[02:19:48.948 --> 02:19:50.751]  The government says, we're going to give you this paper.
[02:19:50.751 --> 02:19:52.473]  Give us that.
[02:19:52.473 --> 02:19:55.618]  Then they doubled the price of gold a year later, once the people didn't have it.
[02:19:55.618 --> 02:19:58.222]  Of course, my great-grandpa didn't turn his in.
[02:19:58.222 --> 02:19:59.043]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:59.043 --> 02:19:59.904]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:20:01.226 --> 02:20:05.708]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[02:20:05.708 --> 02:20:09.971]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[02:20:09.971 --> 02:20:20.816]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is handpicked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[02:20:20.816 --> 02:20:22.537]  These key ingredients not only supply
[02:20:26.610 --> 02:20:27.290]  We're good to go.
[02:20:52.438 --> 02:20:52.959]  We're good.
[02:21:00.871 --> 02:21:03.052]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.052 --> 02:21:03.912]  Spy on me?
[02:21:03.912 --> 02:21:04.232]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.232 --> 02:21:09.273]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.273 --> 02:21:10.894]  You should use StartPage instead.
[02:21:10.894 --> 02:21:11.654]  StartPage?
[02:21:11.654 --> 02:21:13.154]  Yeah, StartPage.com.
[02:21:13.154 --> 02:21:16.115]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:16.115 --> 02:21:19.996]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:19.996 --> 02:21:23.117]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:23.117 --> 02:21:25.738]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:25.738 --> 02:21:27.338]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:27.338 --> 02:21:27.638]  Right!
[02:21:27.638 --> 02:21:30.619]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[02:21:30.939 --> 02:21:32.880]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:36.741]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:21:36.741 --> 02:21:40.522]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one week StartPage challenge.
[02:21:40.522 --> 02:21:45.663]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[02:21:45.663 --> 02:21:49.064]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the big brother habit.
[02:21:49.064 --> 02:21:50.824]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[02:21:50.824 --> 02:21:55.106]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[02:21:55.106 --> 02:21:56.706]  That's StartPage.com.
[02:22:01.277 --> 02:22:03.320]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:06.285]  In no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[02:22:06.285 --> 02:22:08.830]  Certainly not in my 17 years in the industry.
[02:22:08.830 --> 02:22:10.793]  Nearly 100 banks have been shuttered this year.
[02:22:11.252 --> 02:22:14.413]  As many as 200 more banks are suspect by year's end.
[02:22:14.413 --> 02:22:16.854]  The FDIC is operating in the red.
[02:22:16.854 --> 02:22:17.935]  Who pays for that?
[02:22:17.935 --> 02:22:19.115]  Is your money safe?
[02:22:19.115 --> 02:22:23.177]  The dollar's lost over 95% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:22:23.177 --> 02:22:26.539]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:22:26.539 --> 02:22:27.819]  Ours is not immune.
[02:22:27.819 --> 02:22:30.000]  The time is now to be proactive.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.321]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[02:22:32.321 --> 02:22:33.502]  CDs, annuities, 401ks,
[02:22:35.094 --> 02:22:37.256]  IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[02:22:37.256 --> 02:22:41.099]  So decide, do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[02:22:41.099 --> 02:22:42.280]  The choice is yours.
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:43.441]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[02:22:43.441 --> 02:22:44.282]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[02:22:44.282 --> 02:22:45.303]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[02:22:45.303 --> 02:22:46.264]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[02:23:01.021 --> 02:23:05.623]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[02:23:05.623 --> 02:23:13.425]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[02:23:13.425 --> 02:23:28.210]  The revolutionary Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[02:23:44.977 --> 02:23:46.678]  Just call the Berkey Guy at 1-877-886-3653 now to order.

[02:24:17.782 --> 02:24:20.624]  We've been right about everything.
[02:24:20.624 --> 02:24:22.025]  On every issue.
[02:24:22.025 --> 02:24:23.806]  Because we know the club was agenda.
[02:24:23.806 --> 02:24:24.787]  It's all written down.
[02:24:25.947 --> 02:24:31.171]  We're like reading a TV guide and telling you what's on television tonight, and you're saying, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:24:31.171 --> 02:24:32.412]  We have the government textbooks.
[02:24:32.412 --> 02:24:33.853]  We have the government documents.
[02:24:33.853 --> 02:24:35.234]  We have their own admissions.
[02:24:35.234 --> 02:24:38.276]  Private corporate banks are robbing everyone right now.
[02:24:38.276 --> 02:24:40.057]  They're destroying our future.
[02:24:40.057 --> 02:24:43.120]  And they're setting up a police state to make sure we can't resist them.
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:43.980]  It's illegitimate.
[02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:44.781]  It's criminal.
[02:24:44.781 --> 02:24:46.222]  We've got to come to realization.
[02:24:46.222 --> 02:24:48.924]  Stop debating left and right, Republican, Democrat.
[02:24:48.924 --> 02:24:52.346]  Stop debating balloon hoaxes and the latest O.J.
[02:24:52.346 --> 02:24:53.908]  Simpson and Michael Jackson crap.
[02:24:54.838 --> 02:25:03.082]  We've got to stop caring so much about Brett Favre and start caring about the real issues, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:03.082 --> 02:25:04.303]  I mean, take Jesse Ventura.
[02:25:04.303 --> 02:25:05.464]  He likes Brett Favre, too.
[02:25:05.464 --> 02:25:10.686]  We talked a little bit about football while I was out there shooting his TV show with him this week on Wednesday.
[02:25:10.686 --> 02:25:13.948]  But, you know, he still cares about the other issues of liberty and freedom.
[02:25:13.948 --> 02:25:15.109]  I'm not telling people to
[02:25:16.161 --> 02:25:33.635]  To not spend some of their time in leisure and fun and watching the Yankees or the Dodgers, but you still... I mean, Charlie Sheen, I'm good friends with Charlie Sheen, he still watches football and baseball, but he also spends some time dealing with issues of liberty and freedom.
[02:25:33.635 --> 02:25:38.738]  Ron Paul likes baseball, but he still spends some time fighting tyranny.
[02:25:38.738 --> 02:25:41.040]  And we have total criminals taking over.
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:45.444]  I made the decision to basically have almost no leisure, unless it's with my children, playing with them.
[02:25:46.451 --> 02:25:50.634]  I play football in the backyard with my kids, but that's about it, because they need that.
[02:25:50.634 --> 02:25:51.915]  We've got to get our priorities straight.
[02:25:51.915 --> 02:25:56.238]  Bob, this is a short segment, but a long segment coming up.
[02:25:56.238 --> 02:26:03.783]  I want to explain to people this illusion, and I want you to get into it with them, but also what dollar collapse is going to look like, how this is going to affect the average person.
[02:26:03.783 --> 02:26:09.747]  And then also the record bonuses for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, AIG, and others, the ones that change the laws.
[02:26:10.967 --> 02:26:21.334]  With the revolving door of politicians and regulators that are now further raping us with our tax money for bonuses who are now going to set up the new bank of the world that they, the criminals, are going to control.
[02:26:21.334 --> 02:26:24.876]  But Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:26:24.876 --> 02:26:25.977]  People want to check out more.
[02:26:27.645 --> 02:26:30.028]  Gold isn't going up in price.
[02:26:30.028 --> 02:26:38.457]  The dollar is dropping in value and people know it's going, so they're rushing into the safe haven of something that's a real commodity and has true value.
[02:26:38.457 --> 02:26:41.240]  How does that ratio work with the stock market?
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:43.022]  I know it's not as pure.
[02:26:43.022 --> 02:26:44.644]  Dollar goes down, gold goes up.
[02:26:45.365 --> 02:26:50.168]  Well, the move that you've seen in the Dow Jones from the low of 6,600 to 10,000 has been propelled by
[02:27:14.676 --> 02:27:15.877]  Two basic reasons.
[02:27:15.877 --> 02:27:18.098]  Short covering in a big way.
[02:27:18.098 --> 02:27:21.480]  People who bet the market was going to go down and were wrong.
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:29.165]  And secondly, the enormous amount of money that was put into the hands of banking and brokerage firms and insurance companies.
[02:27:29.165 --> 02:27:31.486]  I mean, we're talking trillions of dollars.
[02:27:31.486 --> 02:27:32.387]  What do they do with it?
[02:27:32.387 --> 02:27:36.009]  Well, the Fed said, look, get in the market, run the thing up.
[02:27:36.009 --> 02:27:38.751]  We have to have some stability in here.
[02:27:38.751 --> 02:27:43.694]  We have to convince the public that we're capable of making the market become $10,000 again.
[02:27:44.775 --> 02:27:51.397]  And making those pension and profit sharing plans go from minus 50% back to even again.
[02:27:51.397 --> 02:27:53.218]  And so that's what they've done.
[02:27:53.218 --> 02:27:58.500]  But the flip side of that is inflation starting to heat up big time.
[02:27:58.500 --> 02:28:00.841]  Look at the PPI since May.
[02:28:00.841 --> 02:28:05.162]  All you had to do was watch that and you know that costs are going to go up.
[02:28:05.162 --> 02:28:13.805]  Now either the producers of goods and services are going to eat the additional cost or they're going to pass it on.
[02:28:14.229 --> 02:28:16.510]  Well, most of them are going to pass it on.
[02:28:16.510 --> 02:28:27.792]  And also, to answer your question about the falling of the dollar, how is it going to affect Americans, everything they buy from a foreign country is going to get more expensive.
[02:28:27.792 --> 02:28:36.455]  So that t-shirt that came from China, and you bought it at retail for a dollar, might cost $1.35 or $1.50.
[02:28:36.455 --> 02:28:39.936]  And so that's one of the main ways it's going to hit.
[02:28:39.936 --> 02:28:41.496]  It's going to be very inflationary.
[02:28:42.362 --> 02:28:44.743]  And that will go on for a time.
[02:28:44.743 --> 02:28:46.683]  How high will inflation go?
[02:28:46.683 --> 02:28:50.124]  A minimum of 14 to 15 percent.
[02:28:50.124 --> 02:28:51.644]  Perhaps a lot, lot more.
[02:28:51.644 --> 02:28:54.605]  We don't know what they've got in store for us yet.
[02:28:54.605 --> 02:28:56.125]  Well, Bob, what's the real number?
[02:28:56.125 --> 02:29:00.666]  I mean, unemployment, every other private group says 20 percent or more.
[02:29:00.666 --> 02:29:02.467]  The government says 9.5 percent.
[02:29:02.467 --> 02:29:04.487]  What's the real number there?
[02:29:04.487 --> 02:29:07.728]  Well, the only people I know that figure out what the dollar...
[02:29:09.953 --> 02:29:13.955]  The increase in money and credit is John Williams and myself.
[02:29:13.955 --> 02:29:18.778]  And he's got 21.4% and I've got 21.3%.
[02:29:18.778 --> 02:29:25.281]  So I'll bow to his professional expertise because he's better at it than I am.
[02:29:25.281 --> 02:29:27.182]  And so, yes, that's what we've got.
[02:29:27.182 --> 02:29:33.245]  So anything that some politician or businessman says that the unemployment is more than 20%, that's true.
[02:29:36.656 --> 02:29:39.738]  So unemployment's more like 20.
[02:29:39.738 --> 02:29:43.821]  Inflation's... Where's inflation at, Dave?
[02:29:43.821 --> 02:29:50.646]  Real inflation is 6.11%, using a formula before Bill Clinton went to office in the 1980s.
[02:29:50.646 --> 02:29:51.767]  Alright, stay there.
[02:29:51.767 --> 02:29:53.168]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.168 --> 02:29:55.690]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.690 --> 02:29:58.372]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.930 --> 02:30:05.171]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.171 --> 02:30:07.171]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.171 --> 02:30:15.693]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.693 --> 02:30:21.235]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.235 --> 02:30:22.855]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:23.095 --> 02:30:29.621]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.621 --> 02:30:40.672]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.672 --> 02:30:41.452]  That's right.
[02:30:41.452 --> 02:30:44.015]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:30:44.015 --> 02:30:45.576]  Order today by calling 1-800-691.
[02:30:48.158 --> 02:31:06.150]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:08.231]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:31:08.231 --> 02:31:10.673]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.673 --> 02:31:12.954]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.954 --> 02:31:14.575]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.575 --> 02:31:15.616]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.836 --> 02:31:24.260]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:31:24.260 --> 02:31:31.723]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:31:37.745 --> 02:31:43.768]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:32:01.718 --> 02:32:06.880]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:10.381]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[02:32:10.381 --> 02:32:16.103]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[02:32:16.103 --> 02:32:18.664]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[02:32:18.664 --> 02:32:23.205]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[02:32:23.205 --> 02:32:25.926]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[02:32:26.386 --> 02:32:32.112]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[02:32:32.112 --> 02:32:34.374]  That's NoGerms.info.
[02:32:34.374 --> 02:32:42.943]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[02:32:42.943 --> 02:32:43.944]  Don't pick your nose.
[02:32:44.304 --> 02:32:48.866]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[02:32:48.866 --> 02:32:53.988]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[02:32:53.988 --> 02:32:55.729]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[02:32:55.729 --> 02:32:57.950]  That's NoGerms.info.
[02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:59.671]  Be well and stay well.
[02:32:59.671 --> 02:33:00.411]  Best MZ!
[02:33:17.199 --> 02:33:20.281]  I have a family.
[02:33:20.281 --> 02:33:24.123]  My parents live here.
[02:33:24.123 --> 02:33:25.503]  I have three children.
[02:33:45.815 --> 02:33:50.117]  I love this country.
[02:33:50.117 --> 02:33:57.260]  I had two relations on my mother's side of the family that came over on the Mayflower.
[02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:03.562]  My family was all over the Revolutionary War in 1776 and in the founding of Texas.
[02:34:03.562 --> 02:34:05.963]  I mean, I really bleed red, white, and blue.
[02:34:05.963 --> 02:34:08.084]  I know we've been the greatest country in history.
[02:34:08.084 --> 02:34:09.324]  I know we're special.
[02:34:09.324 --> 02:34:11.105]  Our Bill of Rights and Constitution is wonderful.
[02:34:15.519 --> 02:34:26.707]  And I'm so sick of watching offshore banks with slick PR firms, who know how to lie to the public, gutting the country, openly announcing at Davos they're setting up a world government.
[02:34:26.707 --> 02:34:33.692]  George Soros and all these guys laughing, saying, I'm having a great crisis, we're finally going to bring down the US and set up world government.
[02:34:33.692 --> 02:34:39.196]  The Pentagon totally works for them.
[02:34:39.196 --> 02:34:42.459]  They're openly setting up a police state to rob all of us.
[02:34:45.971 --> 02:34:51.056]  And I've still got to argue with people about whether I'm a conspiracy theorist or not.
[02:34:51.056 --> 02:34:58.483]  I mean, Bob Chapman, does it ever make your head spin to have the thousands of government documents, statements, reports that we cover, that we link to?
[02:34:58.483 --> 02:35:01.506]  More news today about deaths from the swine flu vaccine.
[02:35:01.506 --> 02:35:02.687]  People getting paralyzed.
[02:35:02.687 --> 02:35:04.328]  Medical doctors say yes.
[02:35:05.531 --> 02:35:07.352]  It's causing neurological problems.
[02:35:07.352 --> 02:35:09.393]  They had to stop it in 76.
[02:35:09.393 --> 02:35:12.815]  For a year, they denied deaths were happening in 76.
[02:35:12.815 --> 02:35:16.477]  And people finally said, hell no, and they admitted it.
[02:35:16.477 --> 02:35:18.938]  I mean, how many times do we have to be lied to?
[02:35:18.938 --> 02:35:21.440]  How many times do we have to be right?
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:26.062]  Again, I'm not trying to toot our horn here today, but I want to make a big deal out of this, because it is a big deal.
[02:35:26.062 --> 02:35:27.583]  We have the track record.
[02:35:27.583 --> 02:35:28.944]  We have been right.
[02:35:28.944 --> 02:35:30.024]  We do our homework.
[02:35:30.024 --> 02:35:31.485]  We bust our ass.
[02:35:31.485 --> 02:35:32.646]  I mean, Bob, I remember you.
[02:35:34.215 --> 02:35:40.965]  However many years ago it was, you can remind me, and I'm reading your forecast or having you on, and I've been interviewing you for like eight years.
[02:35:40.965 --> 02:35:47.954]  I remember you when the stock market hit $14,000 saying, get out now.
[02:35:47.954 --> 02:35:49.236]  And you can remind me of the date in a moment.
[02:35:51.954 --> 02:35:59.719]  When the stock market went way down last year, you said it's going to run back up in the summer and fall, and then I forget when you said it was going to plunge down again.
[02:35:59.719 --> 02:36:01.501]  Let's hear your forecast now.
[02:36:01.501 --> 02:36:10.047]  And I remember you calling all these things accurately, and you've pointed out, because you're not an egomaniac and neither are other economists we have on,
[02:36:12.253 --> 02:36:20.436]  You've pointed out that Bob Chapman's about 95% accurate and that the mainstream media is over 80% inaccurate on the financial shows.
[02:36:20.436 --> 02:36:22.997]  They're not inaccurate because they're stupid.
[02:36:22.997 --> 02:36:25.578]  They're just as smart as Bob Chapman.
[02:36:25.578 --> 02:36:30.240]  In fact, in their own personal lives, it's come out that their portfolios are the opposite of what they're saying.
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:34.962]  In many cases, what they tell their viewers, Kramer and others,
[02:36:36.431 --> 02:36:38.812]  That they know what they're doing.
[02:36:38.812 --> 02:36:39.973]  They know they're lying.
[02:36:39.973 --> 02:36:40.954]  They know they're spinning.
[02:36:40.954 --> 02:36:43.595]  They know they're manipulating.
[02:36:43.595 --> 02:36:50.599]  So, you're just telling the truth because that's what you do.
[02:36:50.599 --> 02:36:52.220]  That's your business model.
[02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:53.721]  That's your political model.
[02:36:53.721 --> 02:36:56.502]  They work for the system, so they lie.
[02:36:56.502 --> 02:36:58.764]  Explain to people your predictions, and they're all in the newsletters.
[02:36:58.764 --> 02:37:02.886]  Go over all the things you called, and then where we are right now, and where you see us going.
[02:37:04.465 --> 02:37:19.997]  Well, I can go back to, I called the top of the real estate market in October of 1989, and I sold my house in Malibu that month, as a matter of fact, and I said, you know, it's over and they're going to get out considerably.
[02:37:19.997 --> 02:37:31.786]  Well, that happened, and the elitists had an opportunity between 1990 and 1992 to straighten the entire economy out by having
[02:37:32.310 --> 02:37:33.751]  A strong recession.
[02:37:33.751 --> 02:37:35.713]  They refused to do that.
[02:37:35.713 --> 02:37:44.199]  Japan, at the same time, was in a terrible fix, and that went on for 20 years.
[02:37:44.199 --> 02:37:47.782]  And we called the top of the market there at $42,000.
[02:37:47.782 --> 02:37:54.728]  It eventually went down to about $5,000, and now it's trading a little bit higher.
[02:37:54.728 --> 02:38:00.352]  But that was some of the things in the old days that, if you want to call them that, I called.
[02:38:01.536 --> 02:38:06.739]  We even called a rally in gold in 1984-5, and then again in 1986.
[02:38:06.739 --> 02:38:18.045]  I think one of the best things I ever called was the increase in interest rates in 1992, where we said the 30-year would go to $8.16, and we hit it right on the head.
[02:38:25.345 --> 02:38:33.709]  Then, of course, the dot-com boom came during the late 90s, and I just stood aside and said, I'm not going to go into that madness.
[02:38:33.709 --> 02:38:42.373]  And in April, the second week of 2000, we called a top on the stock market.
[02:38:42.373 --> 02:38:53.879]  And then in June, we went in big time into the gold and silver shares and coins, because we felt this was the beginning of another bull market, and the first phase was just completed.
[02:38:54.420 --> 02:39:01.243]  We went from $2.52 an ounce on gold to $1,070 intraday.
[02:39:01.243 --> 02:39:04.604]  And so we made that call.
[02:39:04.604 --> 02:39:12.908]  We called the 9-11 type of event in November before it happened, within 33 days.
[02:39:12.908 --> 02:39:16.309]  We called Iraq and Iran the conflicts.
[02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:19.851]  We called the top of the stock market at $14,000.
[02:39:19.851 --> 02:39:21.091]  We said it would go to either $7,200 or $6,600.
[02:39:23.365 --> 02:39:28.428]  It went to $6,600 and we thought it would go back to $8,500 and it did.
[02:39:28.428 --> 02:39:30.669]  In fact, it went to $10,000.
[02:39:30.669 --> 02:39:35.751]  We didn't pick the top on that, but we were essentially and fundamentally correct.
[02:39:35.751 --> 02:39:38.092]  Now, I think we're looking at a return.
[02:39:38.092 --> 02:39:47.117]  I can't tell you the length of time right now, but we're looking at a return of the Dow downward.
[02:39:47.117 --> 02:39:51.799]  The time frame, hard to say, but at the moment it looks like we should see
[02:39:52.617 --> 02:39:57.840]  A correction down to $7,800 to $8,800, down somewhere in that area.
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:01.601]  Gold and silver are going to keep right on going up.
[02:40:01.601 --> 02:40:06.124]  Silver will break out finally from its all-high, probably by the end of the year.
[02:40:06.124 --> 02:40:09.385]  And gold, of course, is broken out.
[02:40:09.385 --> 02:40:12.006]  Probably next stop is $1,250, and then $1,650, and then $2,500 to $3,000.
[02:40:12.006 --> 02:40:13.907]  And that $2,500 only reflects official inflation.
[02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:26.521]  Since 1980, real inflation would put gold at $6,700.
[02:40:26.521 --> 02:40:31.142]  And so these are the general predictions.
[02:40:31.142 --> 02:40:40.183]  Incidentally, real estate is going to continue to go down because of the types of loans that are still out there and the loss of jobs.
[02:40:40.183 --> 02:40:49.645]  The fact that for a year, the government has been writing subprime loans again, and that won't possibly bottom out until 2013.
[02:40:51.271 --> 02:40:51.431]  Okay.
[02:41:16.159 --> 02:41:36.190]  I want to take some calls before you leave us and we got Chris Pinto next hour getting into some information dealing with Dan Brown's book and they're saying it's inaccurate they've made the definitive films on the real secret societies the Illuminati and how they operate whole separate area we're going to be discussing coming up the next hour but while we've got you Bob
[02:41:37.330 --> 02:41:39.973]  I'm shaken up by this.
[02:41:39.973 --> 02:41:44.757]  It's one thing to know they're going to kill the dollar and know it a decade ago and to see their plans.
[02:41:44.757 --> 02:41:53.325]  It's another thing to now be here in that zone where they're getting ready to stage new wars, new terror attacks, they're setting up incredible police states.
[02:41:53.325 --> 02:42:01.713]  I've got mainstream news articles where high-level media executives with no criminal record, known for being pure gentlemen,
[02:42:03.849 --> 02:42:13.537]  Get up in first class and walk in front of someone who's asleep and the stewardess yells at them and then has them arrested under the Patriot Act and they're charged for making an ugly face.
[02:42:13.537 --> 02:42:16.459]  That's in the FBI affidavit.
[02:42:16.459 --> 02:42:24.026]  I see these articles every week now where people argue with a stewardess so they're going to prison under the Patriot Act.
[02:42:24.026 --> 02:42:26.268]  I see where they're charging marijuana dealers with it.
[02:42:26.268 --> 02:42:27.308]  I mean, people with a half ounce.
[02:42:29.595 --> 02:42:34.038]  I mean, they're arresting people selling eggs on street corners in the countryside.
[02:42:34.038 --> 02:42:35.879]  I mean, they're SWAT teaming Amish.
[02:42:35.879 --> 02:42:39.702]  I mean, it's entering a vortex of evil.
[02:42:39.702 --> 02:42:42.944]  $100,000 fines for garage sales.
[02:42:42.944 --> 02:42:45.366]  I mean, I can't even believe how insane.
[02:42:45.366 --> 02:42:56.093]  They just came out and admitted what I knew 14 years ago, but now completely declassified that most TV is run by the Pentagon and the White House and the entire scripts
[02:42:57.276 --> 02:42:58.036]  Are you kidding?
[02:43:15.327 --> 02:43:16.988]  As if the pie can't grow.
[02:43:16.988 --> 02:43:19.830]  As if we're, I mean, global taxes are being announced.
[02:43:19.830 --> 02:43:23.693]  Schwarzenegger's saying you gotta thumbprint to buy guns.
[02:43:23.693 --> 02:43:27.436]  He's now saying they're gonna ban 40-inch TVs because they're bad for the environment.
[02:43:27.436 --> 02:43:28.457]  They use too much energy.
[02:43:28.457 --> 02:43:32.680]  I mean, all the carbon taxes, all the control, worse than the Soviet Union.
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:36.662]  When I say that, I mean, it is!
[02:43:36.662 --> 02:43:39.785]  I mean, I just, Bob, it's off the charts, but before we do that,
[02:43:40.948 --> 02:43:46.891]  What will this look like as they incrementally, like you said, knock the dollar down, then bring it up a little bit.
[02:43:46.891 --> 02:43:48.352]  Knock it down, bring it up a little bit.
[02:43:48.352 --> 02:43:49.833]  Knock it down, bring it up a little bit.
[02:43:49.833 --> 02:43:51.354]  Because that's the graph.
[02:43:51.354 --> 02:44:00.999]  And as the world now shifts with new purchases to majority, Euros and Yens and Yons and other currencies.
[02:44:00.999 --> 02:44:02.780]  They've now left the dollar.
[02:44:02.780 --> 02:44:04.741]  That's the headlines in all the financial papers.
[02:44:04.741 --> 02:44:05.681]  So they've begun.
[02:44:05.681 --> 02:44:06.562]  It's like the HAL 9000
[02:44:08.903 --> 02:44:19.234]  Uh, in, uh, 2001 Space Odyssey, where he's going, I'm afraid, Dave, and the astronauts turning the computer's memory off, and it's, I mean, they're, they're, they're turning it off.
[02:44:19.234 --> 02:44:27.562]  He's gone down about 10 of the memory cubes, he's got about 50 left, and, you know, the, the, the HAL 9000, which is America, is going,
[02:44:28.243 --> 02:44:29.204]  Daisy!
[02:44:29.204 --> 02:44:30.805]  Daisy!
[02:44:30.805 --> 02:44:31.966]  I mean, this is happening!
[02:44:31.966 --> 02:44:34.549]  And there's no way to stop these criminal bankers!
[02:44:34.549 --> 02:44:44.497]  They're gonna get their world government, they're gonna rape everybody more, we're gonna pay our taxes directly to them, and no matter how big their frauds are, the police just, yes sir!
[02:44:44.497 --> 02:44:45.137]  Salute them!
[02:44:45.137 --> 02:44:49.581]  I mean, Bob, this is getting bad!
[02:44:49.581 --> 02:44:53.845]  Well, I think law enforcement had better wake up, because if they keep on doing what they're doing,
[02:44:55.438 --> 02:44:57.440]  There is going to be a backlash.
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:44:59.082]  There's absolutely no question.
[02:44:59.082 --> 02:45:01.584]  Desperate people do desperate things.
[02:45:01.584 --> 02:45:03.526]  And we have desperate people in America.
[02:45:03.526 --> 02:45:07.009]  We have 30 million people, or whatever it is, unemployed.
[02:45:07.009 --> 02:45:10.713]  And I think the checks are going to stop very shortly.
[02:45:11.471 --> 02:45:12.872]  In a big way.
[02:45:12.872 --> 02:45:16.574]  Checks are already bouncing from the state to people in California.
[02:45:16.574 --> 02:45:24.418]  And we've got some bizarre Hitler Youth guy going, I'll take your guns, I ban TV!
[02:45:24.418 --> 02:45:26.799]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:26.799 --> 02:45:29.581]  Well, you're right about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:45:29.581 --> 02:45:31.782]  Oh, that makes me sick.
[02:45:31.782 --> 02:45:36.765]  And they're going to continue to do this and finally it'll snap.
[02:45:36.765 --> 02:45:38.466]  And then we'll see who's going to win.
[02:45:39.253 --> 02:45:42.874]  The Pentagon's not going to win because the military's not going to follow them.
[02:45:42.874 --> 02:45:56.717]  And I think we're going to have to join the military in helping them to combat the travesty of corruption and dictatorial government that's in Washington and Wall Street.
[02:45:56.717 --> 02:45:58.217]  And that's what we're going to have to deal with.
[02:45:58.217 --> 02:46:00.278]  These are the people who are dangerous.
[02:46:00.278 --> 02:46:01.118]  The crooks in the $3,000 suits.
[02:46:02.924 --> 02:46:06.386]  I mean, I got an article here that Paul Craig Roberts did yesterday.
[02:46:06.386 --> 02:46:07.987]  It's only two pages.
[02:46:07.987 --> 02:46:11.228]  The rich have stolen the economy, and he's right.
[02:46:11.228 --> 02:46:14.450]  It's a fabulous, very short, but fabulous article.
[02:46:14.450 --> 02:46:32.499]  Well, Professor Black, who's one of the top regulators of SNL exposing all that, and Professor Black's top game, and he said, this is by an order of magnitude the greatest fraud, the greatest scam in world history, and they're just getting started!
[02:46:34.833 --> 02:46:42.839]  That's right, and they don't even know what to do with the billions and billions of dollars that they're stealing from everybody.
[02:46:42.839 --> 02:46:58.070]  There's a new magazine coming out by the Financial Times, where to put all of that great amount of money that you rich people are pulling in by doing what you're doing on Wall Street, etc.
[02:46:58.070 --> 02:47:02.573]  And we have fragmented into a society
[02:47:03.317 --> 02:47:12.630]  Where the middle class has been reduced to 5 or 10 percent, you have a rich cadre at the top and everybody else is wallowing.
[02:47:13.114 --> 02:47:40.889]  But isn't that like, it's the winter time and you're cold, so instead of going and getting some firewood, you just light the drapes on fire, and, you know, this is the elite, this'll, I'll get lots of warmth if I burn the house down, and, you know, there's just masses of troops in black uniforms marching, beating their batons on their breastplates when you try to go protest the G20, and then the elite are just burning the house down going, boy, it's warm, you know, roasting hot dogs in their own inhalation.
[02:47:42.534 --> 02:47:47.498]  Well it's interesting, the Romans did the same thing and that's where they got that from.
[02:47:47.498 --> 02:47:51.501]  Bagging their spears up against their shields.
[02:47:51.501 --> 02:47:55.083]  And today they've got billy clubs to do that.
[02:47:55.083 --> 02:48:00.127]  And I see that they have all kinds of armor on.
[02:48:00.127 --> 02:48:06.332]  Well let me tell you something, there's ways to take people down even if they've got armor on.
[02:48:06.332 --> 02:48:08.894]  But where we're headed here is
[02:48:10.425 --> 02:48:15.707]  Ultimately to violence and ultimately to revolution.
[02:48:15.707 --> 02:48:22.110]  The elitists think that they're going to be able to control the situation.
[02:48:22.110 --> 02:48:27.051]  And I think, and I know you do Alex, that they're not going to be able to.
[02:48:27.051 --> 02:48:28.052]  And we are going to win.
[02:48:28.052 --> 02:48:32.413]  It's just, what kind of a price are we going to have to pay?
[02:48:32.413 --> 02:48:38.916]  The price is being paid because in the last 50 years particularly, no one wanted to pay attention.
[02:48:39.482 --> 02:48:42.504]  Well, some people are starting, and that's terrific.
[02:48:42.504 --> 02:48:48.127]  We are winning the battle on the airwaves, that's for sure, and even in print now.
[02:48:48.127 --> 02:48:51.248]  And we've discussed this in a program before.
[02:48:51.248 --> 02:48:53.870]  The people who are running things, they're in trouble.
[02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:56.751]  They've had to expedite their program.
[02:48:56.751 --> 02:49:07.377]  I would have never thought we would have saw last week a planted article by Fisk that we don't need the dollar anymore, and there's some nations plotting against it.
[02:49:08.154 --> 02:49:10.455]  Well, they should pull out against it.
[02:49:10.455 --> 02:49:12.195]  The United States is bankrupt.
[02:49:12.195 --> 02:49:13.315]  Well, that's total spin.
[02:49:13.315 --> 02:49:15.556]  Dr. Roberts made the point yesterday.
[02:49:15.556 --> 02:49:19.377]  The Russians, the Chinese, the Arabs are saying, we're your biggest investors.
[02:49:19.377 --> 02:49:21.537]  Please stop devaluing it.
[02:49:21.537 --> 02:49:23.098]  It's lost 10% in the last year.
[02:49:23.098 --> 02:49:24.318]  We're losing money.
[02:49:24.318 --> 02:49:26.498]  And then the Federal Reserve is out there.
[02:49:26.498 --> 02:49:28.439]  They're the ones setting up the New Bank of the World.
[02:49:28.439 --> 02:49:30.399]  They're the ones killing America.
[02:49:30.399 --> 02:49:33.100]  Then they blame it on the Arabs.
[02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:33.600]  That's right.
[02:49:34.577 --> 02:49:35.938]  And they're just recipients.
[02:49:35.938 --> 02:49:46.447]  They're selling things to us, in this case, oil and petrochemical products, and the Chinese, all the kinds of products, and so on and so forth.
[02:49:46.447 --> 02:49:48.949]  And we're robbing the world!
[02:49:48.949 --> 02:49:50.410]  Bob, let me ask you this.
[02:49:50.410 --> 02:49:56.715]  We're going to come back and get into final comments from you on the economy, but would you be buying gold right now and silver?
[02:49:56.715 --> 02:50:00.118]  I mean, is that the investment, or what are some other investments?
[02:50:00.118 --> 02:50:03.321]  You know, Alex, it is the only place to be.
[02:50:04.304 --> 02:50:09.748]  You can go to currencies, but they can all devalue against the dollar, and they have been for the last six years.
[02:50:09.748 --> 02:50:12.110]  So why bother to go there?
[02:50:12.110 --> 02:50:21.117]  You go to gold and silver coins if you want gold and silver shares, and that's the only place where you can protect your wealth.
[02:50:24.139 --> 02:50:34.902]  Absolutely, and to explain what you just said, Dr. Roberts, former head of the Treasury, said this, the former head of policy yesterday, that the implosion of the dollar is going to suck down other systems as well.
[02:50:34.902 --> 02:50:39.684]  But we're going to be the center, the center of the black hole here.
[02:50:39.684 --> 02:50:42.625]  Do you agree with that?
[02:50:42.625 --> 02:50:48.507]  62.8% of the foreign reserves of all countries are in dollars.
[02:50:48.507 --> 02:50:51.488]  Incidentally, that just dropped from 64.5 at the beginning of the year.
[02:50:52.788 --> 02:50:56.034]  And they're now, the majority of new currency they're buying is not dollars.
[02:50:56.034 --> 02:50:56.956]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:56.956 --> 02:50:58.740]  The shift has been made.
[02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:00.884]  They're putting the final nails in the dollar.
[02:51:02.056 --> 02:51:09.581]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:51:09.581 --> 02:51:14.083]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:51:14.083 --> 02:51:19.247]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:51:19.247 --> 02:51:26.711]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:51:26.711 --> 02:51:31.074]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[02:51:31.374 --> 02:51:37.396]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:51:37.396 --> 02:51:44.338]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[02:52:01.818 --> 02:52:07.862]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.862 --> 02:52:13.747]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:52:13.747 --> 02:52:19.911]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:20.231 --> 02:52:22.191]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:22.191 --> 02:52:24.672]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:24.672 --> 02:52:37.854]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.854 --> 02:52:39.535]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.535 --> 02:52:41.375]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.375 --> 02:52:47.616]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.554 --> 02:52:58.136]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.136 --> 02:52:59.338]  The people strike back!
[02:53:01.229 --> 02:53:02.110]  You worry.
[02:53:02.110 --> 02:53:04.191]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:53:04.191 --> 02:53:06.833]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:53:06.833 --> 02:53:08.954]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:53:08.954 --> 02:53:10.556]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:53:10.556 --> 02:53:14.158]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:53:14.158 --> 02:53:19.402]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:53:19.402 --> 02:53:22.704]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:53:23.373 --> 02:53:25.053]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:53:25.053 --> 02:53:27.954]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:53:27.954 --> 02:53:31.395]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:53:31.395 --> 02:53:40.036]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:53:40.036 --> 02:53:44.877]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[02:53:54.708 --> 02:53:58.110]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:53:58.110 --> 02:54:00.150]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:54:23.205 --> 02:54:23.791]  Yeah.
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:40.540]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:44.322]  I want to bring Ted Anderson on briefly, then hold Bob five more minutes over.
[02:54:44.322 --> 02:54:47.663]  Talk about some more financial news, maybe jam a few calls in.
[02:54:47.663 --> 02:54:49.323]  Ted Anderson's here.
[02:54:49.323 --> 02:54:52.004]  He bought gold at $950 and sold it to you when it was $1,000.
[02:54:52.004 --> 02:55:00.047]  And now that gold's up at $1,060 right now, he's running out of the gold he bought at the $1,000 level.
[02:55:00.047 --> 02:55:01.847]  That is, he bought this gold when the market was $1,000.
[02:55:01.847 --> 02:55:04.988]  He bought the silver, he's almost out of it.
[02:55:04.988 --> 02:55:06.209]  I just bought a bag of it last week.
[02:55:07.119 --> 02:55:08.439]  Well, I can tell you what I have.
[02:55:08.439 --> 02:55:09.020]  I have Franks at $238.
[02:55:34.830 --> 02:55:37.814]  Got British Sovereigns at $2.93.
[02:55:37.814 --> 02:55:41.559]  Lakota Coins are at $22.30 still.
[02:55:41.559 --> 02:55:44.763]  Walking Liberties, man, you're not going to find those anywhere else at this price. $8.69.
[02:55:48.372 --> 02:55:49.753]  You're right, the market is going up.
[02:55:49.753 --> 02:55:50.813]  Man, I'm just depressed.
[02:55:50.813 --> 02:55:55.956]  I've been reading economic news, and then I come on to get on the air with you and I hear Bob talking.
[02:55:55.956 --> 02:56:05.381]  I mean, I was just reading an article that says that the dollar, since TARP, the supply of money has increased 2 to 1 from what we had just a couple years ago.
[02:56:06.175 --> 02:56:12.421]  The only thing that's stopping us from having complete, out-and-out, blasted inflation is just the velocity.
[02:56:12.421 --> 02:56:13.982]  It's just crazy, Alex.
[02:56:13.982 --> 02:56:19.748]  It just makes me, you know, I mean, I've got kids that are going to be entering the job force here in just a couple years.
[02:56:19.748 --> 02:56:20.889]  I don't have a grandchild.
[02:56:21.389 --> 02:56:23.771]  And this is the kind of world we're leaving for him.
[02:56:23.771 --> 02:56:25.212]  It just drives me nuts.
[02:56:25.212 --> 02:56:25.813]  Exactly.
[02:56:25.813 --> 02:56:31.377]  I'm not happy that we've been proven completely right and that Bob, six months ago, said in the fall it would go above 1,050.
[02:56:31.377 --> 02:56:33.679]  That's what he said on air.
[02:56:33.679 --> 02:56:34.960]  I pulled up his newsletter earlier.
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:38.443]  And I'm not pleased to be right.
[02:56:38.443 --> 02:56:44.468]  But at least it's a silver lining in this big rain cloud that at least the listeners can get a great deal.
[02:56:44.468 --> 02:56:47.911]  Bob Shemin, how good a deal is that, that Ted Anderson's offering?
[02:56:49.279 --> 02:56:56.366]  It's a very good deal, but just as important is the fact you get diversification there.
[02:56:56.366 --> 02:57:04.594]  You've got all of these different kinds of coins in a fifth of an ounce or a quarter of an ounce approximately, and then you've got the silver.
[02:57:04.594 --> 02:57:07.096]  Beautiful, beautiful for barter.
[02:57:07.096 --> 02:57:10.840]  And so I like the smaller coins myself.
[02:57:10.840 --> 02:57:13.282]  Ted, are you able to get any fractional
[02:57:14.069 --> 02:57:16.932]  uh... gold eagles and silver eagles series?
[02:57:16.932 --> 02:57:18.773]  No, you know, they're not even making them this year.
[02:57:18.773 --> 02:57:19.934]  It's real tough.
[02:57:19.934 --> 02:57:24.077]  I have some from that I picked up a while ago.
[02:57:24.077 --> 02:57:28.060]  Yeah, a lot of mints have cut back in production while there's even more drive.
[02:57:28.060 --> 02:57:30.462]  Let me give people the number and the brokers will be there until tonight.
[02:57:30.462 --> 02:57:31.883]  This deal's good until midnight tonight.
[02:57:31.883 --> 02:57:33.224]  800-686-2237 800-686-2237 MidasResources.com again 800-686-2237
[02:57:43.293 --> 02:57:46.217]  People are insane if they don't take advantage of this deal.
[02:57:57.882 --> 02:58:05.232]  I mean, Bob, I'm reading your literature and it's like I'm scratching my head as to figure out why people would not move into gold and silver.
[02:58:05.232 --> 02:58:11.801]  I mean, it just, you know, if you take a look at the entire... Well, because it's more than tripled in value the last seven years.
[02:58:11.801 --> 02:58:13.904]  People don't like something that's almost quadrupling.
[02:58:14.164 --> 02:58:15.746]  They like losing money.
[02:58:15.746 --> 02:58:18.788]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:18.788 --> 02:58:21.651]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:21.651 --> 02:58:23.092]  Call right now.
[02:58:23.092 --> 02:58:25.895]  Midas Resources, the parent company of the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:25.895 --> 02:58:26.936]  It's where I've shopped around.
[02:58:26.936 --> 02:58:28.598]  It's where I buy my gold and silver.
[02:58:28.598 --> 02:58:31.821]  The deal Ted just gave you, I certify, is awesome.
[02:58:31.821 --> 02:58:33.502]  I think you should get involved.
[02:58:33.502 --> 02:58:34.563]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:34.563 --> 02:58:36.005]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:58:36.005 --> 02:58:38.867]  We're gonna come back with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:58:42.152 --> 02:58:47.814]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.814 --> 02:58:51.036]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.036 --> 02:58:54.437]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.437 --> 02:58:58.039]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:58.039 --> 02:59:02.620]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.620 --> 02:59:04.041]  These emergency backup systems
[02:59:04.281 --> 02:59:07.163]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:59:07.163 --> 02:59:13.269]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.269 --> 02:59:16.892]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.892 --> 02:59:21.716]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.716 --> 02:59:28.281]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.281 --> 02:59:30.243]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.

[02:59:40.648 --> 02:59:41.188]  Don't wait.
[02:59:41.188 --> 02:59:41.809]  Call today.
[02:59:41.809 --> 02:59:42.849]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.849 --> 02:59:44.130]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:05.894 --> 03:00:25.618]  Bob Chapman for another five minutes and Chris Pinto, documentary filmmaker, is going to be joining us.
[03:00:25.618 --> 03:00:29.019]  Bob, again, what will it look like as the dollar dies?
[03:00:29.019 --> 03:00:31.680]  Sure, stuff's going to cost more from overseas.
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:33.220]  We don't really have a lot of industry left.
[03:00:34.474 --> 03:00:43.117]  If we have a depression, which we're going into here, we're not agrarian, we're not rural anymore, we're almost 90%, 89% urban.
[03:00:43.117 --> 03:00:44.957]  Most people in the country aren't self-sufficient.
[03:00:44.957 --> 03:00:55.500]  I mean, globalization was meant to wreck everything, to consolidate it, but are the globalists doing too good a job wrecking their own system?
[03:00:55.500 --> 03:01:01.862]  You might say that they are, but they expected that, and they're probably going to lose
[03:01:02.997 --> 03:01:05.618]  Probably two-thirds or more of their wealth.
[03:01:05.618 --> 03:01:10.419]  They're willing to accept that in order to execute their world government.
[03:01:10.419 --> 03:01:13.000]  And they hold a lot of gold, incidentally.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:16.720]  And so I think gold's going to come back into the picture monetarily.
[03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:27.203]  And there's been talk of that in relation to this new international trading unit that's going to be formed over, I would say, the next year and a half.
[03:01:27.203 --> 03:01:30.884]  And so I think that
[03:01:31.918 --> 03:01:54.749]  What it's going to do for the American and the world public, although I think America and Europe are going to suffer and England are going to suffer the most, because they have had the higher standard of living that other people haven't had, in all areas they do to some extent leverage their buying of property.
[03:01:55.322 --> 03:02:04.266]  Whereas, in the remainder of the world, most of the people pay cash for their property, especially residential property.
[03:02:04.266 --> 03:02:06.887]  And most Americans don't know that.
[03:02:06.887 --> 03:02:20.392]  And so, I think that we're going to, over the next year and a half to two, maybe as long as three years, we're going to move up to unemployment between 35 and 50 percent.
[03:02:20.392 --> 03:02:22.293]  And that's going to serve as a catalyst.
[03:02:23.477 --> 03:02:26.598]  Uh, for very bad times.
[03:02:26.598 --> 03:02:29.319]  And that's what's going to bring on violence.
[03:02:29.319 --> 03:02:31.220]  And that's why I talk about law enforcement.
[03:02:31.220 --> 03:02:33.261]  You better be on the right side.
[03:02:33.261 --> 03:02:36.962]  Because if you shoot an American citizen, you're going to die.
[03:02:36.962 --> 03:02:37.642]  Guaranteed.
[03:02:37.642 --> 03:02:39.163]  There's no way you can win.
[03:02:39.989 --> 03:02:41.189]  Not with 450 million weapons?
[03:02:41.189 --> 03:02:47.811]  Well, that's the thing, is the American people have been cowed, but once violence starts, there's nobody more vicious in history.
[03:02:47.811 --> 03:02:51.552]  I mean, foreign historians have written about this, and that old instinct's there.
[03:02:51.552 --> 03:02:55.653]  It's just going to be rampaging, and I'm not happy about that.
[03:02:55.653 --> 03:03:03.015]  I'm upset, because the globalists want to sit offshore and orchestrate all this from afar, while the police and military take the brunt of it.
[03:03:03.015 --> 03:03:04.555]  Let's talk to Ruth in Louisiana.
[03:03:04.555 --> 03:03:05.696]  Take a call for Bob Chapman.
[03:03:05.696 --> 03:03:06.296]  Ruth, go ahead.
[03:03:08.741 --> 03:03:17.849]  I wanted to make sure, and I'm trying to convince a friend, of taking her stocks.
[03:03:20.088 --> 03:03:28.616]  Well, let me say this, ma'am.
[03:03:28.616 --> 03:03:40.948]  I'm not going to tell you what I would do, but she certainly should diversify, and she should look at what's been performing, but I wouldn't put everything... I know Bob is himself all engulfed in what he said, but I wouldn't put
[03:03:41.668 --> 03:03:44.109]  Well, I think people should get out of the market.
[03:03:44.109 --> 03:03:46.450]  And if they don't want to be totally in golden silver coins or in shares,
[03:04:01.635 --> 03:04:14.839]  They can go to the strongest currencies in the world right now, and you can buy, well, the best place to go is Canadian treasuries and Swiss franc treasuries, if you don't want to be totally in gold.
[03:04:14.839 --> 03:04:22.661]  So an index of things, we're talking about foreign currencies, Swiss, Canadian, we're talking about gold, silver.
[03:04:22.661 --> 03:04:24.442]  But only in the form of bonds.
[03:04:25.715 --> 03:04:26.816]  Only in the form of bonds.
[03:04:26.816 --> 03:04:28.997]  You don't want to get involved in the currency market.
[03:04:28.997 --> 03:04:31.899]  You don't want to... Because the bonds are like cash.
[03:04:31.899 --> 03:04:34.461]  The bonds are like gold.
[03:04:34.461 --> 03:04:36.303]  That's right.
[03:04:36.303 --> 03:04:39.585]  It's not as good as gold, but it's second best.
[03:04:39.585 --> 03:04:42.447]  Does that answer your question, Ruth?
[03:04:42.447 --> 03:04:45.209]  You mean just bonds only and gold and silver?
[03:04:45.209 --> 03:04:47.731]  Or all A's?
[03:04:47.731 --> 03:04:50.393]  Or is that not a good bet?
[03:04:50.393 --> 03:04:53.555]  Well, every situation is different.
[03:04:53.555 --> 03:04:54.936]  What you should do is email me.
[03:04:55.526 --> 03:04:57.167]  Yep, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:04:57.167 --> 03:04:57.888]  Thank you, Ruth.
[03:04:57.888 --> 03:04:58.548]  And thank you, Bob.
[03:04:58.548 --> 03:04:59.669]  We'll see you next Friday.
[03:04:59.669 --> 03:05:01.751]  Happy birthday, Big 74!
[03:05:01.751 --> 03:05:04.753]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.753 --> 03:05:10.098]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.098 --> 03:05:15.042]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:05:15.382 --> 03:05:17.143]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.143 --> 03:05:18.323]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.323 --> 03:05:19.444]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.444 --> 03:05:21.325]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.325 --> 03:05:22.405]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.405 --> 03:05:24.606]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.606 --> 03:05:25.947]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.947 --> 03:05:27.468]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.468 --> 03:05:32.750]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.750 --> 03:05:35.872]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.312 --> 03:05:40.135]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.135 --> 03:05:41.376]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.376 --> 03:05:42.277]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.277 --> 03:05:43.377]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.377 --> 03:05:44.298]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.298 --> 03:05:45.399]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.399 --> 03:05:48.461]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.461 --> 03:05:50.222]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.222 --> 03:05:51.143]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.754 --> 03:06:06.061]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.061 --> 03:06:10.587]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.587 --> 03:06:12.870]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:14.492]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.492 --> 03:06:15.514]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.754 --> 03:06:24.179]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:06:24.179 --> 03:06:31.643]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[03:06:37.667 --> 03:06:43.250]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:47.832]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[03:06:54.794 --> 03:06:55.295]  866-762-9238.

[03:07:01.673 --> 03:07:02.413]  We're good to go.
[03:07:22.244 --> 03:07:22.684]  We're good to go!
[03:07:47.060 --> 03:07:47.661]  We're good to go.
[03:08:02.481 --> 03:08:05.263]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.263 --> 03:08:08.086]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:35.535 --> 03:08:37.677]  You know, I get emails a couple times a week.
[03:08:37.677 --> 03:08:43.362]  I see comments in the stories on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:08:43.362 --> 03:08:56.153]  We'll have an article about doctors admitting the flu shots paralyzing and killing people and there'll be a comment in there, Alex Jones says that a European death cult is running things.
[03:08:59.591 --> 03:09:03.332]  No, Alex Jones doesn't say that.
[03:09:03.332 --> 03:09:15.935]  Whether it's German elites, British elites, elites in the U.S., elites out of Israel, whether it's elites out of Japan, elites out of Russia, I just do the hard research.
[03:09:15.935 --> 03:09:17.216]  I read books they've written.
[03:09:17.216 --> 03:09:19.496]  I study what they're into.
[03:09:19.496 --> 03:09:25.258]  David Rockefeller, Ted Turner, just you name them.
[03:09:28.948 --> 03:09:54.382]  All these people, Tony Blair, Barack Obama, the Bushes from Skull and Bones, all those people, Francois Mitterrand, the head of the French arts, writes books about how he loves slave trade and slave children he rapes, and then he doesn't get in trouble, and then they're defending Polanski.
[03:09:56.448 --> 03:10:02.152]  The point is, is that I came into all this as kind of a libertarian Ron Paul type guy.
[03:10:02.152 --> 03:10:05.155]  Like a mainline Ron Paul person you'd see today.
[03:10:05.155 --> 03:10:13.862]  Now that was seen as radical 14 years ago, but today it's not.
[03:10:13.862 --> 03:10:18.085]  But I'm still seen as a radical just because I've gone further down the rabbit hole.
[03:10:18.085 --> 03:10:21.528]  But I was in my hotel room watching
[03:10:23.007 --> 03:10:35.195]  History Channel, Wednesday morning, before the TV crew of Jesse Ventura came and picked me up, and I was watching a show about the Masons, and watching a show about the Knights Templar, and they admitted Washington, D.C.
[03:10:35.195 --> 03:10:43.341]  is a big pentagram and a big square, and the Washington Monument is a phallus to energize power, and they had the Masons on there admitting it.
[03:10:43.341 --> 03:10:46.443]  I guess it's now time for all that to just come out.
[03:10:46.443 --> 03:10:52.407]  And I remember years ago, the three documentary films that we, by the way, sell discounted at InfoWars.com,
[03:10:53.649 --> 03:11:00.715]  America's Beginnings, The New Atlantis, Secret Mysteries, and we sell all three of their new films.
[03:11:00.715 --> 03:11:02.976]  One of them is very new, but they all go in order.
[03:11:02.976 --> 03:11:05.999]  I mean, these are incredibly high quality films.
[03:11:05.999 --> 03:11:13.745]  But the point is, is that they are coming out now with a lot of this.
[03:11:13.745 --> 03:11:20.070]  And all I'm doing is going, well Skull & Bones is a Germanic death cult, according to their own members that have leaked info.
[03:11:21.195 --> 03:11:23.256]  And one of the rituals has been videotaped.
[03:11:23.256 --> 03:11:34.038]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove, I videotaped a ritual where a thousand old men were grinding their teeth and hyperventilating, watching the mock human sacrifice of a child.
[03:11:34.038 --> 03:11:38.139]  And like atheists are like, oh Alex is crazy, he believes the devil's gonna get us.
[03:11:38.139 --> 03:11:42.080]  Look, whether you believe the devil or not, these people do, is the point.
[03:11:42.080 --> 03:11:44.641]  There are crazy people who believe in this stuff.
[03:11:44.641 --> 03:11:48.762]  Whether you believe in it or not, the crazies believe it and follow it, is what I'm saying.
[03:11:50.842 --> 03:12:05.978]  And you look at Maury Strong, the head of the UN Biological Diversity Forum, and when he had the big Davos, Switzerland meetings, and the meetings in 92 at the Rio de Janeiro UN Summit.
[03:12:05.978 --> 03:12:10.163]  He said, we must destroy industrial society for Mother Nature and Gaia.
[03:12:11.181 --> 03:12:13.363]  And they're all into the occult.
[03:12:13.363 --> 03:12:15.164]  They're into a mystery religion.
[03:12:15.164 --> 03:12:16.846]  They're symbols of the pyramid.
[03:12:16.846 --> 03:12:21.570]  And all these others, and they all sing, I mean, this is real!
[03:12:21.570 --> 03:12:23.211]  These people run things!
[03:12:23.211 --> 03:12:25.513]  Look at every major world capital!
[03:12:25.513 --> 03:12:32.058]  It's obelisk, and it's always the goddess over a war memorial for thousands of dead.
[03:12:32.058 --> 03:12:33.500]  That's the sacrifice to her.
[03:12:33.500 --> 03:12:39.865]  And this is in the literature, but I go to a city, I now know a lot of their language, and it's gang sign everywhere!
[03:12:42.048 --> 03:12:43.849]  And I'm not saying it's Masons.
[03:12:43.849 --> 03:12:47.511]  Masons are a low-level grid of all this.
[03:12:47.511 --> 03:12:55.856]  When you talk about Masons, or you talk about Catholics, or you talk about Protestants, you talk about Jews, when you get to the top of it, I mean, look at the Supreme Court building in Israel.
[03:12:55.856 --> 03:13:00.518]  Giant pyramids, all-seeing eyes, Masonic stuff everywhere.
[03:13:00.518 --> 03:13:01.379]  It's all the same!
[03:13:02.728 --> 03:13:04.149]  And it isn't Masonic.
[03:13:04.149 --> 03:13:09.393]  Masonic is one branch or brotherhood of this system.
[03:13:09.393 --> 03:13:11.255]  That's not saying our Founding Fathers were bad.
[03:13:11.255 --> 03:13:13.357]  A lot of them, more than half, were Masons.
[03:13:13.357 --> 03:13:17.720]  But George Washington wrote about bad groups in control of Masonry.
[03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:25.426]  And it goes back to the mystery schools in Egypt and the sacred symbols.
[03:13:25.426 --> 03:13:27.468]  And to them, it's white magic and black magic.
[03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:32.641]  So George Washington was a Christian, but he was also into all of this.
[03:13:32.641 --> 03:13:34.302]  And so was Solomon.
[03:13:34.302 --> 03:13:35.842]  I'm not here judging these people.
[03:13:35.842 --> 03:13:37.263]  I believe Solomon was good.
[03:13:37.263 --> 03:13:39.324]  I believe George Washington was good.
[03:13:39.324 --> 03:13:41.324]  It's a very complex issue.
[03:13:41.324 --> 03:13:45.506]  The mason down the street from you is not drinking blood out of goblets.
[03:13:45.506 --> 03:13:55.189]  But at the higher levels, you find out it's Lucifer, Albert Pike, and many other top masons whose paintings hang in all their lodges.
[03:13:59.119 --> 03:14:01.820]  They state it is Lucifer they worship.
[03:14:01.820 --> 03:14:03.981]  And so we need to talk about this.
[03:14:03.981 --> 03:14:06.441]  We need to understand this.
[03:14:06.441 --> 03:14:08.162]  We need to know this.
[03:14:08.162 --> 03:14:13.203]  And the stuff Dan Brown puts out is purposefully distorted and twisted.
[03:14:13.203 --> 03:14:14.724]  It's disinfo to the world.
[03:14:14.724 --> 03:14:19.465]  So they're revealing their mystery religion, but still deceiving.
[03:14:19.465 --> 03:14:26.628]  And Chris Pinto, of course, put films out that a lot of the stuff that Dan Brown picked up on, but has distorted it.
[03:14:26.628 --> 03:14:27.208]  And so we've got
[03:14:28.488 --> 03:14:38.071]  Uh, Christian J. Pinto, who has, uh, with David E. Bay, produced the award-winning documentary, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1.
[03:14:38.071 --> 03:14:45.254]  The New Atlantis was honored with the ScreenCraft Award for Best Documentary Feature at the New York Independent Film Festival in 2006.
[03:14:45.254 --> 03:14:48.795]  Also winning Best Historical Documentary at the Los Angeles International Film Festival.
[03:14:48.795 --> 03:14:49.255]  That's big!
[03:14:50.199 --> 03:15:01.866]  The Pinto Bay Company, Antiquities Research Firm, has also released Volume 2, Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., which has become the official selection of the upcoming New York-Los Angeles Film Festivals.
[03:15:01.866 --> 03:15:07.369]  And they've recently released a new film we're covering, The Phoenix, dealing with the dollar.
[03:15:07.369 --> 03:15:09.250]  We'll talk about that as well.
[03:15:10.489 --> 03:15:16.231]  Now, people will hear his occult interpretation from the experts, and they may have a different interpretation.
[03:15:16.231 --> 03:15:22.633]  That's because in true mystery schools, it's like Inuit or Eskimo art.
[03:15:22.633 --> 03:15:27.534]  You look at a totem pole from different angles, it's different animals.
[03:15:27.534 --> 03:15:35.337]  All their symbols have at least three meanings and three faces, sometimes as many as twelve, and that goes into sacred geometry.
[03:15:35.337 --> 03:15:36.917]  But, joining us is Chris Pinto.
[03:15:36.917 --> 03:15:39.138]  Chris, thank you for coming on Eye of the Phoenix.
[03:15:40.399 --> 03:15:41.819]  Well, thank you for having me Alex.
[03:15:41.819 --> 03:15:43.200]  It's great to be on the show again.
[03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:12.512]  What did you think of that little five minute rant as I laid that out?
[03:16:12.512 --> 03:16:13.472]  I thought it was great.
[03:16:13.472 --> 03:16:16.035]  I thought you're making some great points there.
[03:16:16.035 --> 03:16:17.876]  We deal with this all the time.
[03:16:17.876 --> 03:16:26.984]  People who are uninformed of what these societies are doing, they often think when you tell them about their symbolism and whatnot, they'll say, oh, well, I don't believe in all of that.
[03:16:27.544 --> 03:16:29.866]  As though it's not going to affect them.
[03:16:29.866 --> 03:16:35.551]  And one of the things I tell people is that it doesn't matter if you believe in it or not.
[03:16:35.551 --> 03:16:47.020]  The six million Jews who were killed in concentration camps during World War II, they may not have believed in Hitler's occultism, but they were definitely impacted by it.
[03:16:47.020 --> 03:16:52.004]  Their lives were changed dramatically because of what Hitler and the Nazis believed and what they were into.
[03:16:52.004 --> 03:16:55.667]  And they were totally into the mystery schools and occultism.
[03:16:56.698 --> 03:17:03.660]  And they were into the same kinds of practices that you expose out there in the Bohemian Grove in Northern California.
[03:17:03.660 --> 03:17:10.042]  And I had friends who have lived up there that I knew when I lived out in California.
[03:17:10.042 --> 03:17:15.563]  And they talked about how there are sometimes protests outside the Bohemian Grove.
[03:17:15.563 --> 03:17:16.884]  And there are all kinds of things.
[03:17:16.884 --> 03:17:18.344]  People are concerned about it.
[03:17:18.804 --> 03:17:22.046]  In that part of the world, but it never makes the mainstream news.
[03:17:22.046 --> 03:17:23.727]  Nobody ever talks about it.
[03:17:23.727 --> 03:17:30.552]  Of course, because you've got people like, you know, George W. Bush and his dad going out there, and Newt Gingrich and others.
[03:17:30.552 --> 03:17:35.255]  And so nobody wants to, you know, blow the whistle on these guys at a mainstream level.
[03:17:35.255 --> 03:17:37.396]  But they are deeply involved in
[03:17:38.908 --> 03:17:55.736]  You know, deep, dark occultism, even the name Bohemian Grove is specifically a reference to things that in the Old Testament in the Bible, you know, when God is reproving the children of Israel for going into the groves and so on and worshipping idols and
[03:17:55.796 --> 03:18:02.141]  Well, the Grove is also the occult name of a conclave of warlocks and witches.
[03:18:02.141 --> 03:18:07.725]  It's also the name of a great meeting of occultists in many of their histories.
[03:18:07.725 --> 03:18:09.986]  Take Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor.
[03:18:09.986 --> 03:18:20.574]  He wrote a book, Men and Power as a Political Retrospective, where he said we have our own groves where we do rituals, but my favorite place to do them is Bohemian Grove, where we set world policy for world government.
[03:18:20.794 --> 03:18:22.755]  This is written by him.
[03:18:22.755 --> 03:18:24.837]  This is a global network.
[03:18:24.837 --> 03:18:30.441]  And at the top of the German groups, Jewish groups, British groups, it doesn't matter.
[03:18:30.441 --> 03:18:32.662]  The Japanese are into this stuff.
[03:18:32.662 --> 03:18:34.043]  The Aztecs were into this stuff.
[03:18:34.043 --> 03:18:37.806]  It is the same basic religion.
[03:18:37.806 --> 03:18:38.446]  Yeah, it is.
[03:18:38.446 --> 03:18:44.630]  And as you said, it goes throughout all the major cultures of the world and a number of the minor cultures of the world.
[03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:47.012]  And that's what they're trying to draw upon.
[03:18:47.012 --> 03:18:48.273]  The whole concept of
[03:18:48.993 --> 03:18:59.925]  You know, the religious tolerance movement, where they're trying to say that all religions are one and the same, really what they're doing is they're applying the ancient mystery principles.
[03:18:59.925 --> 03:19:05.471]  If you study, for example, Eliphas Levi, Levi who we talk about in our films.
[03:19:06.031 --> 03:19:09.554]  Probably the most influential occultist of the last 200 years.
[03:19:09.554 --> 03:19:18.202]  Influenced Albert Pike, Madame Blavatsky, Lester Crowley, Manly P. Hall, and then the whole Scottish Rite Freemasonry.
[03:19:18.202 --> 03:19:27.190]  Many Masons don't realize that Albert Pike incorporated, you know, whole chapters of Levi's writings into his book, Morals and Dogma.
[03:19:27.190 --> 03:19:31.935]  Well, Levi was a full-on Luciferian Satan.
[03:19:32.695 --> 03:19:38.316]  He's the guy who designed the Baphomet image with the goat-headed God with the flame above his head.
[03:19:38.316 --> 03:19:43.758]  Let's talk about him when we get back and the newest film, Eye of the Phoenix.
[03:19:43.758 --> 03:19:45.038]  Chris Pinto is our guest.
[03:19:45.038 --> 03:19:50.359]  Again, you can get all three of these amazing films at InfoWars.com while you're ordering, pre-ordering.
[03:19:50.359 --> 03:19:52.000]  It ships next week.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:55.820]  Fall of the Republic premieres October 21st at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:19:55.820 --> 03:19:57.621]  We'll be right back with Chris Pinto.
[03:20:01.815 --> 03:20:03.576]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:20:03.576 --> 03:20:05.097]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:20:05.097 --> 03:20:06.417]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:20:06.417 --> 03:20:08.358]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:20:08.358 --> 03:20:17.163]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:20:17.163 --> 03:20:22.585]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:20:22.585 --> 03:20:24.186]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:20:24.386 --> 03:20:31.869]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[03:20:31.869 --> 03:20:36.031]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[03:20:36.031 --> 03:20:38.772]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[03:20:38.772 --> 03:20:43.754]  Liquid Zeolite comes with a money-back guarantee, but it's only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[03:20:52.858 --> 03:20:55.300]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:20:55.300 --> 03:20:58.443]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:21:15.532 --> 03:21:22.117]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:22.117 --> 03:21:24.098]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:24.098 --> 03:21:26.600]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:26.600 --> 03:21:37.568]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:21:38.169 --> 03:21:39.830]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.830 --> 03:21:41.691]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:41.691 --> 03:21:48.614]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.614 --> 03:21:56.878]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.878 --> 03:21:58.439]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.439 --> 03:21:59.620]  The people strike back.
[03:22:01.502 --> 03:22:02.303]  Gold.
[03:22:02.303 --> 03:22:03.824]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[03:22:03.824 --> 03:22:10.110]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[03:22:10.110 --> 03:22:14.294]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:22:14.294 --> 03:22:16.236]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:22:16.236 --> 03:22:16.416]  Mint,
[03:22:16.756 --> 03:22:18.637]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[03:22:18.637 --> 03:22:26.740]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[03:22:26.740 --> 03:22:35.803]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[03:22:42.585 --> 03:22:43.045]  I think so.
[03:23:01.934 --> 03:23:03.695]  Food security from eFoodsDirect.
[03:23:03.695 --> 03:23:06.257]  The most valuable protection your family can have.
[03:23:06.257 --> 03:23:07.738]  It's a scary world we live in.
[03:23:07.738 --> 03:23:12.121]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[03:23:12.121 --> 03:23:15.803]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[03:23:15.803 --> 03:23:23.609]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[03:23:23.609 --> 03:23:27.571]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[03:23:27.571 --> 03:23:31.794]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoodsDirect.
[03:23:31.874 --> 03:23:32.134]  I think so.
[03:24:16.943 --> 03:24:18.364]  Chris Pinto is our guest.
[03:24:18.364 --> 03:24:21.705]  The elite of the planet worship Lucifer.
[03:24:21.705 --> 03:24:23.626]  And that's a fact.
[03:24:23.626 --> 03:24:29.188]  And they're now revealing a lot of this, even on mainstream television, but twisting it.
[03:24:29.188 --> 03:24:31.448]  Let's go back to Chris Pinto, the filmmaker.
[03:24:31.448 --> 03:24:37.891]  Chris, get into this individual who you're saying in the last 200 years is one of the main progenitors of the rise of the Luciferian religion.
[03:24:39.193 --> 03:24:52.703]  Eliphas Levi, he's probably the most influential guy and his symbols, his information, in fact the famous quote from Albert Pike where he says, Lucifer, is it he who bears the light?
[03:24:52.703 --> 03:24:53.584]  Doubt it not.
[03:24:53.584 --> 03:24:54.985]  He's quoting Eliphas Levi.
[03:24:55.626 --> 03:25:04.913]  If you look up any kind of satanic website anywhere, not that I recommend them, but they often use that inverted pentagram with the goat head on it, okay?
[03:25:04.913 --> 03:25:08.276]  Levi was the one who designed that originally.
[03:25:08.276 --> 03:25:18.824]  Also, the Baphomet image of the goat-headed god with the flame above his head sitting cross-legged, that's a very common satanic symbol, also designed by Eliphas Levi.
[03:25:19.584 --> 03:25:39.239]  Well, Levi was somebody who, when you get on the other side of the revolutionary era, as the American and French revolutions had happened, a lot of these guys that were into the occult, who, in the mystery schools, they just kept things secret, and they handed down all of their information through the oral tradition, once the revolutions broke out.
[03:25:40.019 --> 03:25:54.330]  And it was no longer, you know, people were no longer being arrested if they were involved in occultism or witchcraft and this kind of thing because of the ideas of religious freedom that were being promoted and now legalized.
[03:25:54.330 --> 03:26:07.581]  A lot of these guys who, you know, were in the inner chambers of some secret conclave somewhere, they come out and they start publishing and writing what had been believed by these occult groups for centuries.
[03:26:08.181 --> 03:26:10.803]  And Levi was one of the first to do it.
[03:26:10.803 --> 03:26:21.850]  And he goes now, and the reason that he's so often imitated by the leaders now, you read the writings of Madame Blavatsky, her Secret Doctrine, she quotes Levi extensively.
[03:26:21.850 --> 03:26:30.335]  Albert Pike, same thing, infusing Levi's ideas into the Scottish Rite rituals that American presidents and judges and congressmen and so on
[03:26:30.795 --> 03:26:41.247]  If you're a Scottish Rite Mason, you are going through rituals and ceremonies that have the writings and the ideas of Levi and Albert Pike interwoven in them.
[03:26:41.247 --> 03:26:43.289]  It's inescapable.
[03:26:43.289 --> 03:26:48.295]  So there's a change in masonry in the last 200 years influenced by Levi?
[03:26:49.395 --> 03:26:52.858]  Oh yeah, dramatically, especially when you get into Scottish Rite Masonry.
[03:26:52.858 --> 03:26:56.841]  That's his big influence because Pike took so much of his work.
[03:26:56.841 --> 03:27:05.507]  I mean, Pike says in his writings, Albert Pike, and you know, we've been there, we show you the inside of the Masonic House at the Temple in Washington, D.C.
[03:27:05.507 --> 03:27:07.569]  We got permission to go in there and film.
[03:27:07.569 --> 03:27:16.356]  We interviewed Dr. Brent Morris, who's like the head of, oh, he's the managing editor for the Scottish Rite Journal, which is like the leading Masonic magazine.
[03:27:17.132 --> 03:27:26.218]  Uh, but they have an Albert Pike room down below with all, with the death mask of Albert Pike and his pipes and all of his books and everything.
[03:27:26.218 --> 03:27:29.020]  They have Pike buried in the wall there in the temple.
[03:27:29.020 --> 03:27:40.568]  Uh, they have, when you walk in, the first thing you see is a big grand hall and at the end of the hall there's like a staircase leading up to an altar and there's a bust on the altar and it's Albert Pike.
[03:27:41.680 --> 03:27:52.623]  The reason I say these things is because sometimes the masons will try to marginalize him and say he's not that important because he has all of these quotes pertaining to Lucifer.
[03:27:52.623 --> 03:28:02.325]  And it was Pike who said, Pike said that the entire purpose of masonry is a continual progression toward the light.
[03:28:03.408 --> 03:28:04.491]  Okay, and that's the big thing.
[03:28:04.491 --> 03:28:07.337]  They're always talking about light and going toward the light.
[03:28:07.337 --> 03:28:12.247]  And then Pike says in his writings, Lucifer, is it he who bears the light?
[03:28:12.247 --> 03:28:12.889]  Doubt it not.
[03:28:13.978 --> 03:28:22.845]  So, what they're leading their members toward, whether they know it or not, is ultimately toward the full-on worship of Lucifer.
[03:28:22.845 --> 03:28:27.829]  And by the way, George Washington, as you know, before he died, spoke out against this, as a lot of other senior Masons did.
[03:28:27.829 --> 03:28:31.492]  But you talk to low-level Masons, they're like, oh, my ritual has nothing to do with this.
[03:28:31.492 --> 03:28:34.414]  You can show them morals and dogma, Albert Pike.
[03:28:34.414 --> 03:28:36.416]  You can show them Manly P. Hall.
[03:28:36.416 --> 03:28:40.739]  These are the big grand Masons of the last 200 years, and they just won't look at it.
[03:28:40.739 --> 03:28:41.500]  They're in denial.
[03:28:42.659 --> 03:28:49.808]  Yeah, they are, and what they've done is they used to give everybody Alex, they would give them Pike's book, Morals and Dogma.
[03:28:49.808 --> 03:28:53.653]  Then they stopped doing that, I think, because it was just too controversial.
[03:28:53.653 --> 03:28:59.481]  Now they give the Masons another book called A Bridge to Light, okay, which is like a smaller book.
[03:29:00.361 --> 03:29:03.104]  And it's edited by some other modern mason.
[03:29:03.104 --> 03:29:10.730]  But what they've done, the entire book, even A Bridge to Light, is just like the Cliff Notes of Albert Pike's writings.
[03:29:10.730 --> 03:29:13.772]  It's an abbreviation of his writings.
[03:29:13.772 --> 03:29:23.180]  And I think that that is done possibly to deceive some of these masons so that they don't think that they're being directly involved with Pike's Luciferianism.
[03:29:23.180 --> 03:29:24.441]  But there's no way around it.
[03:29:24.441 --> 03:29:26.763]  He is interwoven in Scottish Rite masonry.
[03:29:27.672 --> 03:29:43.741]  Um, and I've been to lodges, you know, I've visited lodges out in California, and so on, where you walk inside, I had, uh, I confronted some masons out in California, out there, and, uh, they, they tried to get me to, you know, well, come down to the lodge and, and just visit us one day, and you'll see.
[03:29:43.741 --> 03:29:45.402]  Uh, and so I... Well, stay there.
[03:29:45.402 --> 03:29:48.984]  I want to hear about what happened with this confrontation with Chris Pinto.
[03:29:48.984 --> 03:29:51.846]  Straight ahead.
[03:29:51.846 --> 03:29:53.247]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.247 --> 03:29:54.748]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.766 --> 03:30:01.310]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.310 --> 03:30:05.552]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.552 --> 03:30:07.554]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.554 --> 03:30:16.079]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:16.079 --> 03:30:21.643]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.643 --> 03:30:23.264]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.484 --> 03:30:30.006]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:30.006 --> 03:30:41.051]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:41.051 --> 03:30:41.811]  That's right.
[03:30:41.811 --> 03:30:44.392]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:30:44.392 --> 03:30:45.972]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[03:30:47.913 --> 03:30:48.534]  We're good to go.
[03:31:02.073 --> 03:31:07.255]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:31:07.255 --> 03:31:10.757]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:31:10.757 --> 03:31:16.479]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:31:16.479 --> 03:31:19.041]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:31:19.041 --> 03:31:23.583]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:31:23.583 --> 03:31:26.304]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:31:26.744 --> 03:31:32.466]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:31:32.466 --> 03:31:34.727]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:31:34.727 --> 03:31:43.291]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:31:43.291 --> 03:31:49.233]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:31:49.233 --> 03:31:54.115]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:31:54.355 --> 03:31:56.096]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:31:56.096 --> 03:31:58.296]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:31:58.296 --> 03:32:00.037]  Be well and stay well.
[03:32:00.037 --> 03:32:01.437]  Best MZ.
[03:32:01.437 --> 03:32:03.138]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:32:03.138 --> 03:32:04.878]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:32:04.878 --> 03:32:07.559]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:32:07.559 --> 03:32:12.701]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:32:12.701 --> 03:32:15.882]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[03:32:15.882 --> 03:32:19.343]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[03:32:19.781 --> 03:32:32.344]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[03:32:32.344 --> 03:32:34.345]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[03:32:34.345 --> 03:32:36.065]  I use one every day.
[03:32:36.065 --> 03:32:38.526]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[03:32:38.826 --> 03:32:40.487]  No one knows what it's like to be the Batman
[03:33:09.338 --> 03:33:23.026]  I promised to do this when we were live on PrisonPlanet.tv and we're going to go back to our guest.
[03:33:23.026 --> 03:33:24.086]  I was mailed the Houston Post
[03:33:34.735 --> 03:33:37.236]  They don't even have this newspaper anymore, I don't think.
[03:33:37.236 --> 03:33:43.260]  Flu shots defended, but growing number of elderly refusing vaccine.
[03:33:43.260 --> 03:33:46.101]  This is from May 5th, 1970.
[03:33:46.101 --> 03:33:52.145]  And then they had the big swine flu fear-mongering, broke out on a military base, killed some people.
[03:33:52.145 --> 03:33:57.468]  And that, then they forced that inoculation on America, and a bunch of people died, so they had to stop.
[03:33:57.468 --> 03:34:01.370]  Growing number of elderly refusing vaccine, believing it causes health problems.
[03:34:03.038 --> 03:34:08.183]  Next week, I'm going to leave this on my desk, maybe even Sunday, I'm going to read this on air.
[03:34:08.183 --> 03:34:17.731]  Houston health officials were faced Thursday night with more physician cancellations for swine flu vaccine and a growing number of elderly persons refusing to take their shots.
[03:34:17.731 --> 03:34:25.338]  The Texas Department of Health Resources announced earlier in Austin that the statewide flu vaccine program would resume Monday, trying to force it on people.
[03:34:25.338 --> 03:34:26.059]  They're never stopping.
[03:34:26.886 --> 03:34:31.688]  It has been suspended following the deaths of several persons who have been given the vaccine.
[03:34:31.688 --> 03:34:34.589]  Federal scientists ruled out the vaccine as the cause of deaths.
[03:34:34.589 --> 03:34:36.489]  But then a few years later, they admitted it.
[03:34:36.489 --> 03:34:39.930]  And we now have this happening again right now.
[03:34:39.930 --> 03:34:45.372]  And meanwhile, I have these articles where German military is refusing to take it.
[03:34:45.372 --> 03:34:53.435]  We've got swine flu fears grow as NHS staff, National Health Service staff in England, shun the vaccine.
[03:34:53.435 --> 03:34:56.016]  Going back to Chris Pinto,
[03:34:57.188 --> 03:35:03.452]  Maker of the amazing trilogy of documentary films, the latest, Eye of the Phoenix.
[03:35:03.452 --> 03:35:09.457]  We have all three of the films together in a discount three-pack at infowars.com while you're there pre-ordering.
[03:35:09.457 --> 03:35:12.499]  Comes out next week, Fall of the Republic.
[03:35:12.499 --> 03:35:16.702]  Going back to Chris Pinto, continue making your points.
[03:35:16.702 --> 03:35:26.249]  You were talking about confronting the Masons, going down to their facility, and then we're going to play a Mason outside a Shriner event, talking about Sweet Lucifer.
[03:35:26.249 --> 03:35:26.609]  Go ahead.
[03:35:27.996 --> 03:35:38.104]  Yeah, well, the point I was making really is about Pike, because one of the first things that you encounter whenever you confront Freemasons, they try to marginalize Albert Pike.
[03:35:38.104 --> 03:35:45.249]  But I was out in California, and these Masons invited me down to the lodge, and I said, OK, I'll come down for a day and let them show me around.
[03:35:45.249 --> 03:35:52.835]  But as soon as I got there, I walked in, and they have their ceremonial hall, and these big double doors and whatnot.
[03:35:52.835 --> 03:35:57.479]  And right out front, there's this gigantic bronze bust of Albert Pike.
[03:35:58.311 --> 03:36:02.980]  And I just looked at him kind of innocently and I said, hey guys, what's the deal with Pike?
[03:36:02.980 --> 03:36:05.023]  Why is he so influential?
[03:36:05.023 --> 03:36:09.251]  And he said, well, he designed all the rituals and ceremonies of the Scottish Rite.
[03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:14.273]  Uh, and so he's, uh, this is why I say he's interwoven in masonry.
[03:36:14.273 --> 03:36:20.818]  The masons have fought for years to keep his statue there in Washington, D.C., and we show you the statue.
[03:36:20.818 --> 03:36:30.386]  Uh, in fact, when we were filming it for Riddles in Stone, Part 2 of the series, we were confronted by a police officer who turned out to be a mason.
[03:36:31.749 --> 03:36:34.231]  And he was concerned why we were filming it.
[03:36:34.231 --> 03:36:37.352]  And thankfully my guide there in Washington, D.C.
[03:36:37.352 --> 03:36:39.713]  was also a Washington, D.C.
[03:36:39.713 --> 03:36:40.433]  police officer.
[03:36:40.433 --> 03:36:41.654]  Great guy.
[03:36:41.654 --> 03:36:43.975]  And he sort of interceded for me.
[03:36:43.975 --> 03:36:47.037]  But then we got into a big conversation with him.
[03:36:47.037 --> 03:36:49.358]  He was trying to support and promote Albert Pike.
[03:36:49.358 --> 03:36:50.998]  The reason people in D.C.
[03:36:50.998 --> 03:36:56.281]  want that statue taken down is because Pike is one of the original founders of the Ku Klux Klan.
[03:36:56.281 --> 03:36:57.161]  Yeah, the founder.
[03:36:57.161 --> 03:36:57.962]  The founder.
[03:36:57.962 --> 03:36:58.822]  Confederate General.
[03:36:58.822 --> 03:37:00.043]  Now let's expand on that.
[03:37:01.144 --> 03:37:08.109]  Here's a police officer, and I've been to the park, we videoed it as well for an upcoming film, close to the Supreme Court.
[03:37:08.109 --> 03:37:16.094]  It's a public park, and this mason who's for freedom of speech, he's coming over trying to keep you from filming it.
[03:37:16.094 --> 03:37:19.056]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:37:19.056 --> 03:37:25.280]  The masonry of George Washington clearly is very different from the masonry we have today.
[03:37:26.670 --> 03:37:33.816]  Yeah, that's what, uh, you know, Washington was because what was happening from what I've been able to gather from the history there.
[03:37:34.543 --> 03:37:57.160]  is you had the uh... the radical radicalized form of masonry over in europe involved with the french revolution and these guys were bloodthirsty uh... jacobins oh yeah the jacobins were bloodthirsty and they were into they were into just slaughtering people uh... and raping children and serious devil worship hellfire club type stuff or even worse and go ahead
[03:37:57.972 --> 03:37:59.373]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[03:37:59.373 --> 03:38:03.656]  They were just extremely radical, and Washington opposed them.
[03:38:03.656 --> 03:38:20.409]  He did not agree with what they were doing, and one of them, one of their ambassadors, Citizen Jenea, we talk about him in Part 2, but Jenea came over, and a lot of people don't realize, these guys stirred up all kinds of, they were trying to have another revolution.
[03:38:20.409 --> 03:38:21.990]  Yeah, let's be clear, Washington
[03:38:22.791 --> 03:38:25.293]  Had people burning his effigy all over the country.
[03:38:25.293 --> 03:38:31.657]  The French masons came in and tried to have... They wanted to change the days to 10 days a week.
[03:38:31.657 --> 03:38:34.199]  They wanted to break up families.
[03:38:34.199 --> 03:38:39.243]  It's the same crap called liberalism today where it's unbelievable.
[03:38:39.243 --> 03:38:40.664]  People don't know what happened in France.
[03:38:41.894 --> 03:38:45.296]  No, and they don't realize how... You had different people.
[03:38:45.296 --> 03:38:46.837]  You had some people like Jefferson.
[03:38:46.837 --> 03:38:49.698]  Jefferson supported the French Revolution.
[03:38:49.698 --> 03:38:51.139]  Washington did not.
[03:38:51.139 --> 03:38:53.740]  There was a division among them.
[03:38:53.740 --> 03:38:57.982]  Jefferson had some pretty dark comments when he heard about all the bloodletting.
[03:38:57.982 --> 03:39:05.466]  He said, well, it's better that every nation be reduced to a single Adam and Eve than that the French Revolution fail.
[03:39:05.466 --> 03:39:07.947]  So he tried to justify the bloodletting.
[03:39:07.947 --> 03:39:10.729]  But other founders, like Washington,
[03:39:11.329 --> 03:39:13.550]  Simply did not approve of it.
[03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:30.275]  And at one point, this guy, Citizen J'Nai, stirred up a crowd in Philadelphia, and they tried to, because Washington would not support the French Revolution, and they tried to drag Washington out of his house to try and get him, to try and force him to support the French Revolution.
[03:39:30.275 --> 03:39:37.897]  And we give the quote from John Adams in the film, but these are parts of American history that have been lost, and they're not taught in our school book.
[03:39:38.797 --> 03:39:40.218]  But they are documented.
[03:39:40.218 --> 03:39:43.739]  You can find the letters in the Library of Congress.
[03:39:43.739 --> 03:39:49.760]  But these guys were radicals, and this was the whole reason for the Alien and Sedition Act.
[03:39:49.760 --> 03:39:54.462]  It was to put these guys down, because they were trying to subvert the country.
[03:39:54.462 --> 03:40:05.825]  And it's the reason why Washington, in his farewell address, had said to the American people that we ought not to seek revolution as the continual
[03:40:06.941 --> 03:40:10.643]  Uh, you know, solution to whatever problems we're facing with the government.
[03:40:10.643 --> 03:40:26.229]  That, that, that we couldn't have this ongoing series of... Because in truth, the Luciferians wanted a violent revolution to destroy everything in their way, the family religion, to make themselves the gods of a totally tyrannical world government based in the United States.
[03:40:26.229 --> 03:40:27.550]  And that's what your series exposes.
[03:40:28.041 --> 03:40:29.042]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:40:29.042 --> 03:40:29.803]  That's what they wanted.
[03:40:29.803 --> 03:40:33.587]  They wanted total chaos, the breaking down of every boundary.
[03:40:33.587 --> 03:40:45.921]  And it's why there are quotes, there are great quotes from Washington where he says, you know, that any nation that casts off the rules of order and right that heaven itself has ordained
[03:40:46.301 --> 03:40:46.642]  That's right.
[03:41:01.237 --> 03:41:04.678]  And they tried it in France and killed close to 20% of the population.
[03:41:04.678 --> 03:41:05.578]  That isn't known.
[03:41:05.578 --> 03:41:06.899]  The Red Terror.
[03:41:06.899 --> 03:41:11.780]  Lenin said it was part two of what happened in France.
[03:41:11.780 --> 03:41:13.400]  The whole Communist Revolution.
[03:41:13.400 --> 03:41:15.061]  The Red Star.
[03:41:15.061 --> 03:41:17.101]  These people mean business.
[03:41:17.101 --> 03:41:22.503]  Yeah, Hitler had said that his Nazi Revolution was the exact counterpart of the French Revolution.
[03:41:22.503 --> 03:41:29.325]  It was in the French Revolution that they had launched the first depopulation program, where they literally broke out a map
[03:41:29.853 --> 03:41:43.603]  And went down to the different towns and regions in France and were determined that they were going to depopulate France so that the people who survived would be able to find work and get food and so on.
[03:41:43.603 --> 03:41:46.225]  And they had planned to kill like 9 million people.
[03:41:46.225 --> 03:41:52.350]  And then what happened was they were slaughtering people and they only killed about 300,000 or so.
[03:41:52.350 --> 03:41:55.372]  But the bodies kept piling up and they didn't know what to do with them.
[03:41:56.512 --> 03:42:09.543]  And I believe, it's one of my theories, that when Hitler came up with his final solution program, part of what the Nazis were doing was trying to find a fast, efficient way to kill people and dispose of the body.
[03:42:09.543 --> 03:42:18.750]  Well, they said they were going to take over the planet and region by region depopulate, putting things in the water to sterilize it first, taking children and they would die of a medical problem.
[03:42:18.750 --> 03:42:20.611]  This has all been declassified.
[03:42:20.611 --> 03:42:22.313]  That is what eco-science
[03:42:23.769 --> 03:42:26.452]  That's what I want to bring up today then, because we're talking about history.
[03:42:26.452 --> 03:42:44.350]  When you look at the environmentalists, the eugenicists, the Maury Strongs, I know this is coming and you're moving through history in your series, when you look at eco-science and the eugenicists, when you look at the 1996 UN Biological Diversity Assessment, we have this in my film Road to Tyranny, you can get this at the UN website,
[03:42:46.795 --> 03:42:49.497]  Oh, put that on screen, that devil snake thing.
[03:42:49.497 --> 03:42:55.482]  We're playing some of the video for radio listeners at PrisonPlanet.tv from one of his films, one of the latest films.
[03:42:55.482 --> 03:42:56.283]  But the issue is...
[03:42:57.406 --> 03:43:06.952]  The eugenicist and the UN document 1996 says the ancient world kept down population with wars, famine, and human sacrifice.
[03:43:06.952 --> 03:43:13.257]  We must reinstitute human sacrifice in the capitals and make the bloodletting be part of society.
[03:43:13.257 --> 03:43:18.280]  I mean, this is official UN law says they want temples and blood sacrifice.
[03:43:18.280 --> 03:43:20.221]  Now, that sounds insane.
[03:43:20.221 --> 03:43:22.543]  I'm not the insane one saying it.
[03:43:22.543 --> 03:43:24.464]  This is official UN policy.
[03:43:24.464 --> 03:43:27.326]  Can you talk about the modern people we're dealing with?
[03:43:28.627 --> 03:43:40.837]  Yeah, I mean, I, you know, because we constantly get questions from people who will ask about, you know, the reality of concentration camps and depopulation programs and things like that, and are these things real and whatnot.
[03:43:40.837 --> 03:43:43.560]  And one of the things that I point to, I'll just say, you know, look at what
[03:43:44.201 --> 03:43:49.582]  That's conservative if you count Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Lenin, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, and others.
[03:43:49.582 --> 03:43:50.083]  It's over 200 mil.
[03:44:11.178 --> 03:44:16.982]  Yeah, and when you've got, and again that is, again I usually go with the conservative numbers to try and convince people.
[03:44:16.982 --> 03:44:21.085]  Well that's it, they always get control of a country though and just start killing!
[03:44:21.085 --> 03:44:22.085]  Exactly.
[03:44:22.085 --> 03:44:25.768]  And I say to people, I say, why do you think they're doing this?
[03:44:25.768 --> 03:44:30.531]  You know, if there's no depopulation program, why are they killing 200 million people?
[03:44:31.427 --> 03:44:34.229]  They're doing it because it's part of an agenda.
[03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:36.391]  And it is, it's a global agenda.
[03:44:36.391 --> 03:44:54.464]  I mean, I can't necessarily make all the connections in every country, but in some of the big ways, especially when you trace it from these radical groups, and these things are admitted, like going back to France for a minute, the French Revolution, all of this is admitted by Dr. James Billington in his book, Fire in the Minds of Men.
[03:44:55.124 --> 03:44:56.806]  Uh, that we quote in the series.
[03:44:56.806 --> 03:45:01.251]  Billington is not a conspiracy writer, he's the Librarian of Congress.
[03:45:01.251 --> 03:45:08.598]  He's as official and historian as you can get, and his book is quoted by President George W. Bush in 2005.
[03:45:08.598 --> 03:45:16.026]  And Bush admitted in his presidential speech, he says, we have lit a fire as well, a fire in the minds of men.
[03:45:16.738 --> 03:45:23.184]  You know, it warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress.
[03:45:23.184 --> 03:45:26.227]  Think about those words from the President of the United States.
[03:45:26.227 --> 03:45:30.731]  You fight with the progress of this fire that we've set up, you're going to get burned.
[03:45:30.731 --> 03:45:31.532]  That's what he's saying.
[03:45:32.382 --> 03:45:38.048]  He says, one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.
[03:45:38.048 --> 03:45:41.552]  But instead, when you really look at the light they're bringing, it's a dark light.
[03:45:41.552 --> 03:45:42.133]  It's evil.
[03:45:42.133 --> 03:45:42.653]  It kills.
[03:45:42.653 --> 03:45:43.895]  It destroys.
[03:45:43.895 --> 03:45:50.642]  They openly state in all of these books and publications that they're going to eradicate the family and make us all slaves.
[03:45:50.642 --> 03:45:52.043]  But that's the freedom.
[03:45:52.043 --> 03:45:53.284]  It's the freedom for the elite.
[03:45:54.005 --> 03:45:58.287]  To kill the unwashed, to kill the uninitiated, the profane.
[03:45:58.287 --> 03:46:00.989]  We are animals to be slaughtered at their pleasure.
[03:46:00.989 --> 03:46:08.753]  It's a giant party land, a giant world of raping, murder, death, slaughter for them and their black uniforms as they march forward.
[03:46:09.671 --> 03:46:12.272]  Exactly, and you hit the nail right on the head.
[03:46:12.272 --> 03:46:25.537]  The way that they sell this to the population, it's just what Lenin did, what Hitler did, what communism has done in every country, is they go in and they pretend that they are going to represent the interests of the people.
[03:46:25.537 --> 03:46:29.018]  That's why they call it the People's Republic of China.
[03:46:29.018 --> 03:46:32.880]  Supposedly it's for the people, but it's not for the people at all, it's for the elitists.
[03:46:33.540 --> 03:46:41.708]  It's for the few, and they're going to turn the people into cattle, and then start massacring those that don't go along with their programs.
[03:46:41.708 --> 03:46:48.954]  And notice now, there's no criticism of regimes that kill and torture their people, unless it's Iran and they want to attack them.
[03:46:48.954 --> 03:46:49.735]  China's good!
[03:46:49.735 --> 03:46:53.798]  They light up the Empire State's building for the Chinese Communist holiday.
[03:46:53.798 --> 03:46:55.140]  I mean, this is in our face.
[03:46:56.246 --> 03:47:07.795]  Yeah, in fact, there's a group called Voice of the Martyrs that documents how Christians who are in China are persecuted, even to this day.
[03:47:07.795 --> 03:47:18.563]  And there are still stories coming out of these just horrible tortures that happen to people who speak out against the government or speak out against the injustice that is done there.
[03:47:18.563 --> 03:47:20.745]  And yet we never hear anything about this.
[03:47:22.754 --> 03:47:25.497]  So it's, but it's an ongoing issue.
[03:47:25.497 --> 03:47:28.180]  This is what the New World Order is about.
[03:47:28.180 --> 03:47:29.462]  I want to play a clip.
[03:47:29.462 --> 03:47:31.364]  This is about two years old.
[03:47:31.364 --> 03:47:36.569]  And if you can really get a Mason to talk to you, a high-level one, they'll explain, oh, I love God.
[03:47:36.569 --> 03:47:38.271]  I love Jesus.
[03:47:38.271 --> 03:47:40.274]  And Jesus and Lucifer are twin brothers.
[03:47:43.004 --> 03:47:45.006]  And he just starts talking about, I do love God.
[03:47:45.006 --> 03:47:46.527]  I love Lucifer.
[03:47:46.527 --> 03:47:47.507]  Sweet Lucifer.
[03:47:47.507 --> 03:47:51.710]  And the guy is in seething with... I mean, he's really having a religious moment.
[03:47:51.710 --> 03:47:56.274]  You know, like a Christian saying hallelujah and shaking he's all Lucifer.
[03:47:56.274 --> 03:47:58.335]  Let's go ahead and play the Lucifer lover.
[03:47:58.335 --> 03:47:59.936]  Here it is.
[03:47:59.936 --> 03:48:01.838]  Lucifer, what is your problem?
[03:48:01.838 --> 03:48:02.898]  Just that, sir.
[03:48:02.898 --> 03:48:03.679]  Start it back over.
[03:48:03.679 --> 03:48:06.781]  Start it over because the first second didn't play.
[03:48:06.781 --> 03:48:07.061]  Back up.
[03:48:07.061 --> 03:48:08.002]  He says, I am Lucifer.
[03:48:08.002 --> 03:48:09.583]  You know, they kind of cut it quick.
[03:48:09.583 --> 03:48:10.724]  He goes, I am Lucifer.
[03:48:10.724 --> 03:48:11.445]  What's your problem?
[03:48:11.445 --> 03:48:11.725]  Here it is.
[03:48:13.729 --> 03:48:15.630]  Lucifer, what is your problem?
[03:48:15.630 --> 03:48:16.371]  Just that, sir.
[03:48:16.371 --> 03:48:17.712]  Okay.
[03:48:17.712 --> 03:48:19.173]  I'm a Christian, sir.
[03:48:19.173 --> 03:48:22.076]  I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent.
[03:48:22.076 --> 03:48:24.497]  How can you say anything about it about me?
[03:48:24.497 --> 03:48:25.718]  Sir, you need to be born again.
[03:48:25.718 --> 03:48:27.640]  I am born again.
[03:48:27.640 --> 03:48:29.521]  Did you just say that you're Lucifer?
[03:48:29.521 --> 03:48:30.242]  I am Lucifer.
[03:48:30.242 --> 03:48:31.983]  Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[03:48:31.983 --> 03:48:36.427]  Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's out to help people.
[03:48:36.747 --> 03:48:38.168]  Lucifer is?
[03:48:38.168 --> 03:48:38.568]  Yeah.
[03:48:38.568 --> 03:48:39.209]  Say that again.
[03:48:39.209 --> 03:48:42.510]  Lucifer is a pure, holy... Virtuous!
[03:48:42.510 --> 03:48:43.471]  Virtuous.
[03:48:43.471 --> 03:48:45.592]  Now, see the Lucifer that God created?
[03:48:45.592 --> 03:48:46.453]  That's the same one.
[03:48:46.453 --> 03:48:47.273]  Oh, man, this is great.
[03:48:47.273 --> 03:48:48.954]  I'm going to put this on the internet.
[03:48:48.954 --> 03:48:49.334]  Amen.
[03:48:49.334 --> 03:48:51.015]  Oh, God bless you, brother.
[03:48:51.015 --> 03:48:56.158]  Because that's exactly what the Shriners and Masons teach, is that Lucifer, Lucifer is light.
[03:48:56.158 --> 03:48:56.779]  No.
[03:48:56.779 --> 03:48:58.260]  And what about those hospitals?
[03:48:58.940 --> 03:49:00.521]  You know what, sir?
[03:49:00.521 --> 03:49:05.522]  Jesus said, many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, we did not do these good deeds in your name.
[03:49:05.522 --> 03:49:07.823]  And you'll say, away from me, you workers of iniquity.
[03:49:07.823 --> 03:49:10.104]  I never knew you.
[03:49:10.104 --> 03:49:11.204]  Jesus said it?
[03:49:11.204 --> 03:49:11.905]  In Matthew chapter 5.
[03:49:14.165 --> 03:49:15.165]  Mercy.
[03:49:15.165 --> 03:49:15.605]  No.
[03:49:15.605 --> 03:49:16.766]  That's hard to believe.
[03:49:16.766 --> 03:49:19.706]  So, you're a Christian and you don't know that.
[03:49:19.706 --> 03:49:21.727]  No, I really am.
[03:49:21.727 --> 03:49:23.527]  Because I'm pure and virtuous.
[03:49:23.527 --> 03:49:25.207]  You're pure and virtuous, okay.
[03:49:25.207 --> 03:49:28.128]  In other words, you're perfect without Jesus, right?
[03:49:28.128 --> 03:49:29.448]  No, no, no.
[03:49:29.448 --> 03:49:30.608]  Okay, tell me about Jesus.
[03:49:30.608 --> 03:49:32.609]  Who is Jesus?
[03:49:32.609 --> 03:49:33.949]  He's my leader.
[03:49:33.949 --> 03:49:34.909]  Is He the Son of God?
[03:49:34.909 --> 03:49:35.570]  Yes, He is.
[03:49:35.570 --> 03:49:37.350]  Is He the only worshipful master?
[03:49:38.254 --> 03:49:38.774]  Yes.
[03:49:38.774 --> 03:49:40.956]  Have you ever been called a worshipful master?
[03:49:40.956 --> 03:49:43.158]  No, because I've just been too busy.
[03:49:43.158 --> 03:49:44.219]  I've been working.
[03:49:44.219 --> 03:49:44.639]  Working?
[03:49:44.639 --> 03:49:45.960]  Working to help people.
[03:49:45.960 --> 03:49:46.961]  What kind of work?
[03:49:46.961 --> 03:49:49.763]  Get out of here.
[03:49:49.763 --> 03:49:58.689]  See, this is what a mason confesses, is that Lucifer is light.
[03:49:58.689 --> 03:50:03.133]  Chris Pinto, I mean, and these lunatics are running everything.
[03:50:04.181 --> 03:50:33.648]  Yeah, people don't realize, Alex, that that doctrine that he's describing there, even though he sounds a little wacky, this is what the guys who are, you know, the inner core of the United Nations, this is what the guys who, you know, we're controlling and manipulating FDR's administration, which we show in Eye of the Phoenix, this is what the Theosophists, the Theosophical Society, and on the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, the inner core, they all do the same thing.
[03:50:34.248 --> 03:50:38.310]  And Madame Blavatsky talked about it in her book, The Secret Doctrine.
[03:50:38.310 --> 03:50:41.812]  And she called it Demon Es Deus Inversus.
[03:50:41.812 --> 03:50:44.273]  The Devil is God Inverted.
[03:50:44.273 --> 03:50:47.694]  And this is what Dan Brown is promoting in this new book.
[03:50:47.694 --> 03:50:50.936]  You know, I meant to get into that, and we're not going to have time to take calls, I apologize.
[03:50:50.936 --> 03:50:56.098]  But in the final segment, we'll get into Dan Brown, and we clearly got to get you back on Chris Pinto.
[03:50:56.098 --> 03:50:59.379]  We carry the whole trilogy discounted at InfoWars.com.
[03:50:59.379 --> 03:51:00.380]  You definitely want to see it.
[03:51:03.086 --> 03:51:06.468]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:51:06.468 --> 03:51:10.371]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:51:10.371 --> 03:51:14.093]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:51:14.093 --> 03:51:21.118]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[03:51:24.224 --> 03:51:24.844]  We're good to go.
[03:51:52.839 --> 03:51:58.000]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:51:58.000 --> 03:52:03.321]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[03:52:03.321 --> 03:52:09.122]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:09.122 --> 03:52:16.124]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:16.707 --> 03:52:23.291]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:23.291 --> 03:52:25.273]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:25.273 --> 03:52:27.774]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:27.774 --> 03:52:38.742]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:39.344 --> 03:52:41.006]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:41.006 --> 03:52:42.867]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:42.867 --> 03:52:49.793]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.793 --> 03:52:58.060]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:58.060 --> 03:52:59.622]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:59.622 --> 03:53:00.823]  The people strike back.
[03:53:03.066 --> 03:53:07.348]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[03:53:07.348 --> 03:53:10.629]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[03:53:10.629 --> 03:53:18.412]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[03:53:18.692 --> 03:53:20.914]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[03:53:20.914 --> 03:53:23.297]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[03:53:23.297 --> 03:53:30.103]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[03:53:30.103 --> 03:53:36.310]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[03:53:36.310 --> 03:53:38.892]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[03:53:38.892 --> 03:53:39.753]  Utopia Silver
[03:53:41.303 --> 03:53:42.003]  Either you're with us,
[03:54:04.352 --> 03:54:06.273]  Well, you were with the terrorists.
[03:54:06.273 --> 03:54:15.879]  One of the things that if you talk to our generals, they are desperate for is a civilian counterpart to our military forces.
[03:54:15.879 --> 03:54:22.382]  Homeland Security is enlisting some unlikely new recruits to fight terrorism and help with other emergencies.
[03:54:22.382 --> 03:54:23.463]  The Girl Scouts.
[03:54:23.463 --> 03:54:29.506]  The Department of Homeland Security calling on firefighters to take on a new role in the war on terror.
[03:54:29.506 --> 03:54:32.088]  The idea, to be the eyes for the U.S.
[03:54:32.088 --> 03:54:33.669]  government when they're inside a home.
[03:54:34.289 --> 03:54:43.834]  To force their unpopular agenda upon the planet, the controllers are racing to complete the construction of their police state control grid.
[03:54:43.834 --> 03:54:48.396]  So number one, they can come in, the federal government can come in and inspect your house and send you the bill.
[03:54:48.396 --> 03:54:51.478]  We're setting up a global warming Gestapo.
[03:54:51.478 --> 03:54:59.822]  The more things spin out of control, the harder the hammer is going to come down by the federal government to keep everyone in control.
[03:55:01.618 --> 03:55:04.862]  If you put all these signs together, it doesn't look good at all.
[03:55:04.862 --> 03:55:09.628]  To the extent we are a democracy, we're sort of a hair breaths away from a police state.
[03:55:09.628 --> 03:55:19.620]  Borrowing from tactics used in the past by communist, fascist and other totalitarian regimes, every form of classical textbook tyranny is now being implemented in the West.
[03:55:21.277 --> 03:55:24.879]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[03:55:24.879 --> 03:55:26.039]  That's not the whole trailer.
[03:55:26.039 --> 03:55:28.821]  It just went up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:55:28.821 --> 03:55:31.202]  The fifth and final trailer for Fall of the Republic.
[03:55:31.202 --> 03:55:33.003]  Pre-order it today, folks.
[03:55:33.003 --> 03:55:37.385]  It's shipping out next week on DVD and premiering at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[03:55:37.385 --> 03:55:43.809]  You know, I forgot that I was contacted by the directors of these great films I've had on many times about Dan Brown and his book.
[03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:52.122]  That comes right out with how great the whole Luciferian system is, how it's the Bible is the secret law symbol, how...
[03:55:53.496 --> 03:55:58.460]  The Devil is God inverted, yin-yang, and how it's all good.
[03:55:58.460 --> 03:56:00.763]  They're just coming right out with it.
[03:56:00.763 --> 03:56:03.965]  And look, Chris, we got off into the history of it.
[03:56:03.965 --> 03:56:04.746]  It's such a big subject.
[03:56:04.746 --> 03:56:08.329]  I gotta have you back in the next few weeks to just do Dan Brown.
[03:56:08.329 --> 03:56:10.872]  And you guys have written a counter to it.
[03:56:10.872 --> 03:56:16.437]  But just briefly, in the few minutes we've got left, take us out with You've Reviewed It.
[03:56:16.437 --> 03:56:17.698]  Tell us what's really going on with it.
[03:56:18.496 --> 03:56:21.997]  Well, here's how we got in touch with the book.
[03:56:21.997 --> 03:56:30.560]  Actually, a couple of weeks before the book was released, we had gotten a call from ABC's Nightline News.
[03:56:30.560 --> 03:56:38.183]  And they contacted us and they requested a copy of Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., which is Part 2.
[03:56:38.183 --> 03:56:39.463]  And we said, alright, why do you want it?
[03:56:39.463 --> 03:56:46.746]  And they said, well, we want to review it in conjunction with a story that we're doing on Dan Brown's new book, The Lost Symbol.
[03:56:47.506 --> 03:56:52.727]  Okay, now we hadn't read the book at that point, but so they're requesting a copy of one of our films in the series.
[03:56:52.727 --> 03:57:10.352]  Then we find an article from the Associated Press where Dan Brown is saying, in the interview, or the Associated Press is saying, that his new book is based in part on an, quote, unfair anti-Masonic video, okay, that had been released.
[03:57:11.008 --> 03:57:16.412]  And so this led us to wonder, I mean, is this why Nightline is trying to get a copy of Riddleton Stone?
[03:57:16.412 --> 03:57:20.216]  Was that the unfair anti-Masonic video, so-called?
[03:57:20.216 --> 03:57:32.906]  And of course we know when we released that that the Freemasons were not happy about it, because we're interviewing a lot of their leaders, like some of their top leaders and apologists, who try to go out and refute these conspiracy theories.
[03:57:33.506 --> 03:57:42.550]  And, uh, you know, we're getting stories that Dan Brown was kind of working with these guys, and he's trying to present their viewpoint in his book.
[03:57:42.550 --> 03:57:45.811]  But he's talking about all the things that we talk about in the series.
[03:57:45.811 --> 03:58:00.137]  He talks about Sir Francis Bacon, and the New Atlantis, and he's talking about the architecture of Washington, D.C., and the Hermetic symbolism, and getting into all of the philosophies that we're... And by the way, Patriots have been talking about this for a hundred years.
[03:58:01.343 --> 03:58:04.833]  Now they're just coming out with all of it, going, yeah, it's a big pentagram.
[03:58:04.833 --> 03:58:07.862]  I saw this in a documentary on History Channel this week.
[03:58:08.775 --> 03:58:17.000]  Uh, look, we're going to go ahead and set you up for part two next week if you can do it, Chris Pinto, because I want to just do Dan Brown and why they're now coming out with it.
[03:58:17.000 --> 03:58:18.782]  Are they trying to put the capstone on the pyramid?
[03:58:18.782 --> 03:58:21.263]  It's their time for the revelation of the method.
[03:58:21.263 --> 03:58:28.268]  Folks, get the trilogy at infowars.com and the Secure Online Shopping Cart and the new film, Fall of the Republic, coming out.
[03:58:28.268 --> 03:58:30.289]  Uh, Mr. Pinto, thank you for spending time with us.
[03:58:30.289 --> 03:58:31.270]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:58:32.335 --> 03:58:33.136]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:33.136 --> 03:58:35.737]  Retransmission jam-packed with key info starts now.
[03:58:35.737 --> 03:58:37.999]  I'll be back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:37.999 --> 03:58:43.282]  Until then, God bless you all.
[03:58:43.282 --> 03:58:44.703]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.434 --> 03:58:54.815]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.815 --> 03:58:58.436]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.436 --> 03:59:02.998]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.998 --> 03:59:08.600]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.880 --> 03:59:13.663]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.663 --> 03:59:17.285]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.285 --> 03:59:22.107]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.107 --> 03:59:28.671]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.671 --> 03:59:30.612]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.092 --> 03:59:34.294]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[03:59:34.294 --> 03:59:38.798]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[03:59:38.798 --> 03:59:40.519]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
