[04:12.320 --> 04:16.520]  fell and put out the exact way it did fall 25 minutes before then it turned out
[04:16.520 --> 04:22.760]  it was Reuters with a false start report with all of the scripting of 9-11 this

[08:07.200 --> 08:27.840]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.880]  my friends there is an article in Politico today that we have linked up at
[08:32.880 --> 08:40.080]  prismplanet.com and info wars dot com that really crystallizes and highlights
[08:40.080 --> 08:47.120]  everything I'm talking about every week or two I see articles about a woman or
[08:47.120 --> 08:53.400]  a man but generally it's women who will argue with a flight attendant generally
[08:53.400 --> 09:01.320]  a female flight attendant I just noticed this pattern and for arguing or yelling
[09:01.320 --> 09:05.120]  back and forth they are charged under the Patriot Act and we've had their
[09:05.120 --> 09:09.360]  lawyers many times over the years here on the show this has been going on for
[09:09.360 --> 09:12.840]  about seven years it didn't start till about a year after they passed the
[09:12.840 --> 09:21.000]  Patriot Act in October 2001 per state tens of thousands of people are charged
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.880]  per year under Patriot Act provisions for marijuana for car theft for child
[09:26.880 --> 09:36.120]  abuse and the charges are many times stronger have longer prison sentences
[09:36.120 --> 09:46.800]  it's amazing but this gentleman in the Politico story is a high-powered
[09:46.800 --> 09:50.840]  executive no criminal record David Bass is known in Washington as a
[09:50.840 --> 09:54.960]  accomplished PR executive and TV commentator a man with impressive
[09:54.960 --> 10:00.120]  Rolodex and a fixture of the DC social scene or at least he was until
[10:00.120 --> 10:04.680]  Thursday when word spread through the town that Bass had been charged with a
[10:04.680 --> 10:09.240]  federal felony for loudish behavior on a continental Airlines flight from
[10:09.240 --> 10:15.080]  Houston to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport an FBI agent and a
[10:15.080 --> 10:19.640]  couple of flight attendants saying court documents that Bass seemed drunk on
[10:19.640 --> 10:24.040]  the flight disobeying instructions from crew climbing over another passenger to
[10:24.040 --> 10:27.600]  get to the overhead luggage bin making mean faces and generally upsetting
[10:27.600 --> 10:34.440]  everyone in first class and I have the affidavit and they say he got up in
[10:34.440 --> 10:38.960]  first class while the person was sleeping I've done this and coach many
[10:38.960 --> 10:44.880]  times you don't want to wake them up you squeeze past them I squeeze past
[10:44.880 --> 10:50.360]  Wednesday night the guy next to me I thought that was nice they're charging
[10:50.360 --> 10:55.520]  with a felony for that the stewardess ran up and yell at him and said get back
[10:55.520 --> 11:00.640]  in your seat and they said that he seemed non responsive and he said yes I had
[11:00.640 --> 11:09.200]  flown from South America there have been horrible layovers he said that he had
[11:09.200 --> 11:14.960]  taken Benadryl for allergies and he was out of it they then said we're going to
[11:14.960 --> 11:18.240]  charge you under the Patriot Act for being drunk because any misdemeanor
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.280]  under the Patriot Act is an act of terrorism section 802 any action in
[11:22.280 --> 11:27.960]  dangerous human life is a violation of any federal state law and they say in
[11:27.960 --> 11:33.440]  the affidavit they when it landed at Ronald Reagan Airport they pulled him
[11:33.440 --> 11:38.760]  off he said look I'm not drunk I haven't been drinking I've been on airplanes or
[11:38.760 --> 11:46.760]  in airports for 30 hours getting back to the United States and I was asleep and
[11:46.760 --> 11:50.960]  I got up to go to the bathroom and you could take my blood I haven't even
[11:50.960 --> 11:55.640]  been drinking I'm totally exhausted and they said we're sorry we're charging you
[11:55.640 --> 12:01.320]  with a felony 20 years in prison and that's in the article 20 years no
[12:01.320 --> 12:07.440]  criminal record and it says because he got up not when the no standing signs
[12:07.440 --> 12:12.560]  were on he got up squeeze past the person they complained the stewardess
[12:12.560 --> 12:17.240]  ninnyed around flight attendant I may be arrested for violating hate speech now
[12:17.240 --> 12:22.040]  ninnyed around and move the other first-class person because they complained
[12:22.040 --> 12:28.400]  that he squeezed past them and they admit he didn't even argue with them they
[12:28.400 --> 12:32.400]  said he was non-responsive when they talked to him and made a mean face
[12:32.400 --> 12:39.040]  that's in the affidavit made a mean face so forgetting up and and and stepping
[12:39.040 --> 12:43.280]  in front of the person and for them complaining and then for him making a
[12:43.280 --> 12:50.880]  mean face he is charged as a terrorist his life is over they get convictions for
[12:50.880 --> 12:55.880]  these every week or so over the years I don't have probably had more I don't know
[12:55.880 --> 13:02.040]  more than 10 I've had a couple on this year their lawyers on where you know in
[13:02.040 --> 13:06.640]  some cases they'll yell back or they'll scream or they'll cuss in one case the
[13:06.640 --> 13:12.120]  lady dropped her drink they said that was throwing the drink but but but then
[13:12.120 --> 13:18.800]  they charge him with the same thing but this time it's just making a mean face
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.240]  because they admit he didn't even argue they said he was unresponsive he said
[13:22.240 --> 13:28.760]  yeah I was on Benadryl I woke up to go to the bathroom and ladies and gentlemen
[13:28.760 --> 13:35.680]  I mean what's crazy about this is I get to the LAX Wednesday night my flight
[13:35.680 --> 13:41.320]  supposed to leave at 6 I get there about 445
[13:42.760 --> 13:46.800]  Ventura invited me out to a late lunch but I couldn't go I had I wanted to get
[13:46.800 --> 13:51.160]  back early so I'd set an early flight told them an early time I get there I'm
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.040]  sitting there at the airport it takes off at 10 30 at night which is not that bad
[13:55.040 --> 13:59.400]  of a layover that a bunch of storms and mechanical problems but we took off at
[13:59.400 --> 14:05.760]  10 30 I got home at 2 30 and got home you know past three but on the plane I
[14:05.760 --> 14:12.760]  finally fell asleep about 30 minutes out from Austin and I had the tray down in
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.080]  front of me and the empty glass that had some ice in it from some orange juice I'd
[14:17.080 --> 14:24.640]  had and I had just gotten the orange juice in the three-hour flight never
[14:24.640 --> 14:29.520]  talked to the to the flight attendant after that I fell asleep the captain had
[14:29.520 --> 14:33.080]  announced they were making the descent I guess and suddenly a woman is leaning
[14:33.080 --> 14:41.860]  over me saying I said tray up give me your glass and I was sitting next to the
[14:41.860 --> 14:47.640]  window and I was half asleep and I took me a second I handed it to her she was
[14:47.640 --> 14:52.040]  glaring at me with hatred and anyone who's flown a lot has experienced this a
[14:52.040 --> 14:57.120]  lot of times the flight attendants are nice it seems though women are either
[14:57.120 --> 15:02.480]  nicer or meaner I've never had a male flight attendant be mean but maybe
[15:02.480 --> 15:06.160]  that's just a statistic because less of them are male
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.380]  but I have had seen them really blow up at people I've seen them really get
[15:12.380 --> 15:18.960]  aggressive I've seen them yell at people whose kids are crying flight attendants
[15:18.960 --> 15:23.680]  have gotten in trouble before and charged under the Patriot Act themselves for
[15:23.680 --> 15:28.720]  ordering people to give Benadryl to their children they bring them liquid
[15:28.720 --> 15:31.800]  Benadryl I guess that's like an inside deal they do because I've seen multiple
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.960]  cases of it and order parents to give the crying child Benadryl because they
[15:35.960 --> 15:42.360]  don't want to hear it you know they're getting paid I guess 12 14 15 bucks an
[15:42.360 --> 15:47.520]  hour it's not minimum wage but they're not getting paid a lot they fly them all
[15:47.520 --> 15:51.080]  over the country in the world they get angry they get upset they get
[15:51.080 --> 15:55.240]  frustrated it's the wrong time of the month whatever the reasons are and they
[15:55.240 --> 15:59.000]  just blow up at people they've got an attitude problem look I don't make you
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.080]  work for American Airlines I don't make you work for Delta or United or whatever
[16:04.080 --> 16:09.000]  the I don't make you work for Qantas I don't make you work for continental I
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.720]  mean I'm not the one that made you have this job I'm not being rude to you why
[16:13.720 --> 16:19.800]  are you being rude to me but that's a whole other issue if you've seen the
[16:19.800 --> 16:23.840]  movie anger management it's it's a pretty good movie where where the guys
[16:23.840 --> 16:27.560]  aren't even arguing and the air marshal gets up and tasering that is based on
[16:27.560 --> 16:34.120]  real cases I mean they routinely taser people for for just being screamed at
[16:34.120 --> 16:50.080]  if you argue back they will attack you so David Bass is known in Washington as
[16:50.080 --> 16:53.840]  an accomplished PR executive and TV commentator a man with impressive
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.720]  Rolodex and a fixture on the DC social scene Bass said he was tired and out of
[16:58.720 --> 17:05.560]  it on allergy medication it doesn't even know what a mean face is and he's
[17:05.560 --> 17:08.480]  being charged with climbing over another passenger to get to the overhead
[17:08.480 --> 17:13.320]  luggage bin making mean faces and generally upsetting everyone in first
[17:13.320 --> 17:17.560]  class and it's not just the flight attendants that are ninnies same thing
[17:17.560 --> 17:23.280]  happened to me Wednesday night everybody's jumping up cramming through I
[17:23.280 --> 17:28.600]  just try to get between a guy and a lady to get my bag when it's my time to go
[17:28.600 --> 17:34.720]  and this business kind of business suit goes okay because I reached up to get
[17:34.720 --> 17:38.720]  my heavy bag everything was crammed in including cameras and stuff and I'm
[17:38.720 --> 17:43.480]  pulling it out and it kind of dropped a little didn't hit anybody and he goes oh
[17:43.480 --> 17:50.200]  okay it's just a nation of ninnies Bass says he was tired out of it on
[17:50.200 --> 17:53.400]  allergy medication doesn't even know what a mean face is that's in there he's
[17:53.400 --> 17:57.200]  charged with making a mean face and its friends say that the allegations against
[17:57.200 --> 18:01.280]  him punishable by as much as 20 years in federal prison don't sound like bass at
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.840]  all yeah he's known as a charming smooth operator goes on to say it runs
[18:05.840 --> 18:10.640]  contrary to my 20 years of knowing him here his behavior described as aggressive
[18:10.640 --> 18:14.040]  and confrontational said Nick Sweeney advertising director at the weekly
[18:14.040 --> 18:19.880]  standard where bass was formerly the deputy publisher so he's an insider
[18:19.880 --> 18:27.560]  folks a globalist added weekly standard writer Matt Labash bass is proclaiming
[18:27.560 --> 18:31.840]  his innocence because he thinks he is obviously everybody sees you know what's
[18:31.840 --> 18:35.120]  saying this is in crazy police state it's like oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to
[18:35.120 --> 18:40.360]  make a mean face please don't put me in federal prison as a terrorist obviously
[18:40.360 --> 18:44.880]  everybody takes any airplane shenanigans very seriously these days oh
[18:44.880 --> 18:49.920]  yes because we've got to arrest somebody but threatening a guy with 20 years in
[18:49.920 --> 18:53.320]  jail because you don't like his facial expressions when you deny him service
[18:53.320 --> 18:59.240]  seems a bit extreme in an interview with politico on Thursday bass said the last
[18:59.240 --> 19:03.160]  thing I would ever be is a threat to anyone on a plane he said his PR
[19:03.160 --> 19:06.720]  clients know me is better than this my friends would probably say bass was
[19:06.720 --> 19:13.600]  joking a little more than he should have been and indeed bass has an established
[19:13.600 --> 19:20.720]  reputation in Washington as a hail fellow well met and see what what finally
[19:20.720 --> 19:24.920]  made him mad is and he said he took a blood test he hadn't been drinking but
[19:24.920 --> 19:28.240]  he woke up and said I'd like a glass of wine with the dinner and they said no
[19:28.240 --> 19:32.200]  you're drunk and he said no I just woke up I took Benadryl and they said no so
[19:32.200 --> 19:36.480]  that's what he's arrested for if there's a big event and he's not there
[19:36.480 --> 19:40.320]  everybody knows he must be out of town and it goes on talk about I was flying
[19:40.320 --> 19:46.320]  in from South America and the FBI after David says that you made a mean face and
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.120]  well that's the end of it you'll be going to federal prison now won't be
[19:50.120 --> 19:54.680]  seeing him so see all of you that love the system it's it's meant for you and
[19:54.680 --> 19:58.320]  it's hungry and it's built lots of federal detention centers and it needs

[25:30.500 --> 25:36.540]  SWAT teaming people selling produce they send undercover informants to roadside
[25:36.540 --> 25:41.820]  stands in Ohio and Texas and California these are just a few of the places we've
[25:41.820 --> 25:45.460]  interviewed people from this is in the news and the news reports it like it's
[25:45.460 --> 25:52.780]  good oh yes the undercover state officer under federal grants went and
[25:52.780 --> 26:00.780]  repeatedly bought watermelons and eggs in one case or repeatedly bought the
[26:00.780 --> 26:07.020]  carrots or the beats the undercover officer then asked if he could buy more
[26:07.020 --> 26:13.980]  they said sure come to our farm next Saturday then a SWAT team comes to the
[26:13.980 --> 26:20.420]  farm and it's a homeschooling family with their little kids their son one group
[26:20.420 --> 26:24.820]  I interviewed was in what is third tour in Iraq it's just some Christian family
[26:24.820 --> 26:31.940]  they're raiding the Amish I mean I see these articles every week the Amish
[26:31.940 --> 26:39.220]  farmers are harassing people there's no law that you have to have animal ID or
[26:39.220 --> 26:42.580]  premises ID but they create the color of law all over the country they do this
[26:42.580 --> 26:46.580]  stunt they've done it a bunch in Texas I've seen in the newspapers they've done
[26:46.580 --> 26:53.300]  it in Kansas where and they do this as a psych warfare operation the feds are
[26:53.300 --> 26:59.620]  paying this is this is on record they will take the blue ribbon winner of the
[26:59.620 --> 27:07.260]  calf or the hog or the sound or the chicken and then right before they award
[27:07.260 --> 27:13.180]  them the blue ribbon they will have security escort them off the stage in
[27:13.180 --> 27:19.740]  front of everyone they wait and say oh sorry our rules are there at the and you
[27:19.740 --> 27:23.700]  know the different farm and ranch clubs after the schools future farmers of
[27:23.700 --> 27:28.180]  America and others in the 4-H club and the rest of them because they're all
[27:28.180 --> 27:33.020]  getting grants from the feds to solve run by centralized groups and the locals
[27:33.020 --> 27:37.060]  just follow the orders they then escort them off the stage take their blue ribbon
[27:37.060 --> 27:41.140]  away and give it to somebody else who did do the premises ID animal ID why
[27:41.140 --> 27:46.980]  because when you sign those forms you waive the rights to your property just
[27:46.980 --> 27:50.500]  like they got churches in the 50s oh just sign this form and you get your tax
[27:50.500 --> 27:54.500]  exemption they had been under the First Amendment Congress so make no law
[27:54.500 --> 27:59.300]  establishment of religion or for having the free exercise thereof and they
[27:59.300 --> 28:02.420]  thought they were just signing a form that took them from being a church under
[28:02.420 --> 28:06.780]  the First Amendment to a charity under federal regulations it's all contract
[28:06.780 --> 28:11.660]  fraud and tricks so they do these big-stage events as the girl up there
[28:11.660 --> 28:16.340]  and her Justin Boots and her Wranglers and her you know red red velvet jacket
[28:16.340 --> 28:21.620]  Louis Mays up there winning the hog contest she's gonna get the thousand
[28:21.620 --> 28:27.700]  dollar prize and they lead her off with police and she's crying and everybody
[28:27.700 --> 28:32.860]  gets scared and they make sure they stop bucking the premises ID animal ID now
[28:32.860 --> 28:37.480]  that's psychological terrorism that's psych warfare and so all over the
[28:37.480 --> 28:42.580]  country you argue with the sturdice you argue with the flight attendant you get
[28:42.580 --> 28:47.340]  up out of your seat somebody complains about you you get up because you can't

[29:25.620 --> 29:30.260]  stage because because daddy said I'm not gonna get a premises ID and didn't look
[29:30.260 --> 29:38.020]  at the fine paperwork saying you can't show a hog or a calf there at these

[33:32.020 --> 33:38.620]  government under UN control publicly is federalizing local police departments
[33:38.620 --> 33:42.020]  and putting regular army and Marine Corps liaison officers in every major
[33:42.020 --> 33:47.580]  police department and many small departments every few weeks I see another
[33:47.580 --> 33:52.220]  news article of another town in Washington state or Oregon or Florida
[33:52.220 --> 33:57.260]  even places like Vermont where oh we're moving the police department into the
[33:57.260 --> 34:02.140]  old armory the National Guard is giving it to us on a 10-year federal lease and
[34:02.140 --> 34:06.380]  they're gonna be in the office upstairs or next door and we're gonna have a
[34:06.380 --> 34:11.540]  threat fusion center and the army is gonna be there with us or oh the local
[34:11.540 --> 34:16.220]  police department just had three army intelligence officers in you know the
[34:16.220 --> 34:23.060]  town of Oregon which town it was a few months ago it's gonna pop my head in a
[34:23.060 --> 34:26.100]  second the point is it was just in the newspaper like it's no big deal oh army
[34:26.100 --> 34:29.820]  intelligence is gonna be in the local police intelligence bureau and they're
[34:29.820 --> 34:32.860]  gonna just get to know the locals and help police with intelligence I mean
[34:32.860 --> 34:35.740]  they're not just saying the army is gonna be in the police department they
[34:35.740 --> 34:40.540]  say it's intelligence and I see these stories over and over and over it's
[34:40.540 --> 34:46.900]  going on everywhere and it's always many times worse than we know it's like if
[34:46.900 --> 34:51.700]  you see five or six termites go in a hole on the side of your house your
[34:51.700 --> 34:57.340]  wooden house you see five or six termites if you rip aside the siding
[34:57.340 --> 35:02.380]  you're probably gonna see 10,000 termites and we're not seeing six termites
[35:02.380 --> 35:05.780]  ladies and gentlemen we're seeing termites climbing all over the walls of
[35:05.780 --> 35:10.060]  the house I mean it's like a house on the outside that's got thousands of
[35:10.060 --> 35:15.820]  termites and big rotholes in the side and part of the roof is sagging the
[35:15.820 --> 35:20.380]  house is about to collapse there's tyranny crawling all over us they're
[35:20.380 --> 35:23.980]  expanding it the foreign banks have sucked us dry and are bankrupting
[35:23.980 --> 35:31.420]  everything by design they're arresting people for making mean faces on airplanes
[35:31.420 --> 35:39.460]  they're not playing games and they're charging people from different events
[35:39.460 --> 35:42.540]  especially the Republican National Convention last year in Minneapolis
[35:42.540 --> 35:49.380]  St. Paul they're charging people there with terrorism for protesting and so
[35:49.380 --> 35:54.020]  you don't get a misdemeanor charge and spend two days in jail and then have to
[35:54.020 --> 35:59.980]  get a lawyer and get probation no you go to the federal pen and that's what they
[35:59.980 --> 36:04.860]  intend here is to create a total and complete chilling effect where everyone
[36:04.860 --> 36:07.620]  is scared to death and then they go out and get the girl scouts and the boy
[36:07.620 --> 36:12.060]  scouts and infregard executives and even small-level companies and the clergy
[36:12.060 --> 36:19.500]  response teams over 50,000 preachers now that we know of recruited to tell their
[36:19.500 --> 36:23.220]  flocks to submit to government take onoculations go to relocation centers
[36:23.220 --> 36:27.100]  turn in their firearms we break it a year and a half before its mainstream
[36:27.100 --> 36:31.420]  news with the secret documents now it's declassified worse than we said of course
[36:31.420 --> 36:36.060]  I see ten termites going up the side of the house I can only tell you about the
[36:36.060 --> 36:40.820]  ten termites I'm seeing but I've pulled boards off the house repeatedly and it's
[36:40.820 --> 36:46.940]  far worse under the house in the eaves of the house in the roof of the house
[36:46.940 --> 36:51.620]  there's they are eating everything and they don't care if the house collapses
[36:51.620 --> 37:00.660]  that's what they want all right I meant to spend five minutes on an article and
[37:00.660 --> 37:08.980]  I've spent 25 but this is the type of issue that we're dealing with in other
[37:08.980 --> 37:14.700]  news we have the internal secret memos of the EIF entertainment industry
[37:14.700 --> 37:20.860]  foundation and it talks about you can read it up on info wars dot com or
[37:20.860 --> 37:27.300]  present on it dot com we have links to it and there's also public documents you
[37:27.300 --> 37:32.500]  can read from them because in the past they would hide this it really got
[37:32.500 --> 37:38.660]  going under Bill Clinton instead of partnerships with the government and
[37:38.660 --> 37:42.180]  oh we'll give you free military hardware and free milk government advisors for
[37:42.180 --> 37:46.500]  your TV show and let you use government installations for your TV show or movie
[37:46.500 --> 37:50.540]  worth millions of dollars if you let us approve the script and rewrite your
[37:50.540 --> 37:56.580]  script and then it was going on under Ronald Reagan was going on under George
[37:56.580 --> 38:04.020]  Bush senior it's been going on since the 60s but under Bill Clinton it went into
[38:04.020 --> 38:10.580]  billions of dollars where ABC NBC CBS nightly news programs were having entire
[38:10.580 --> 38:18.260]  news packages funded and shot and written by federal agents or PR firms they
[38:18.260 --> 38:23.420]  hired to put out their message and I've got clips in this article Paul Watson
[38:23.420 --> 38:27.540]  wrote about this that has all the links where Rupert Murdoch's admitting at the
[38:27.540 --> 38:31.740]  Davos forum yes I believe global warming is real I want a global tax and I've
[38:31.740 --> 38:38.060]  instructed all of my media empire now bigger than Disney to go out and to sell
[38:38.060 --> 38:45.700]  people on global carbon taxes and then Fox produced a six minute video that's
[38:45.700 --> 38:50.140]  up on the site they produced it bragging and showing how they put all these
[38:50.140 --> 38:54.940]  messages in their TV shows but the government goes further it is paying
[38:54.940 --> 38:59.540]  with your tax money I mean you all heard five years ago about Armstrong
[38:59.540 --> 39:07.060]  Williams getting 245 thousand dollars in one payment to do just a couple
[39:07.060 --> 39:12.460]  interviews on TV and radio and to tell his conservative audience that head start
[39:12.460 --> 39:18.380]  federalization of public schooling was conservative and good and the media
[39:18.380 --> 39:25.740]  focused on that when it when the different offices in Congress and the
[39:25.740 --> 39:30.100]  government accountability office said every time this is done it is a felony
[39:30.100 --> 39:34.220]  it's illegal and told the White House to stop it and the White House said we
[39:34.220 --> 39:39.060]  ignore what the legislative branch says we do what we want when really the
[39:39.060 --> 39:48.540]  president supposed to execute what the legislative branch says and does and in
[39:48.540 --> 39:53.700]  one year they spent eight billion dollars you can pull these headlines up it's in
[39:53.700 --> 40:02.220]  my films just on the head start program they spent propagandizing for it with
[40:02.220 --> 40:10.060]  with fake news and news packages they spent nine billion on the prescription
[40:10.060 --> 40:22.980]  drug program in fake news do you know what nine billion dollars will buy do
[40:22.980 --> 40:31.020]  you know what nine billion dollars will purchase and and and this is what we
[40:31.020 --> 40:35.580]  know about most of this is secret this is the five or six termites you see out
[40:35.580 --> 40:42.300]  on the stoop by your house by one of the front door columns or on the back
[40:42.300 --> 40:50.140]  porch can you imagine what else is going on now with a Barack Obama they have a
[40:50.140 --> 40:59.620]  list they have a list on here and I don't have the entire four hours today to
[40:59.620 --> 41:04.140]  read this but it would take hours to read it on ABC this is where they're
[41:04.140 --> 41:08.340]  implanting messages of forced national service and how the government's good
[41:08.340 --> 41:10.660]  and do what the government says or you're a terrorist that that's what this

[44:01.420 --> 44:05.580]  in the news and he said yeah so I called the head of the Austin Air Force it's a

[54:49.700 --> 54:54.780]  a couple of points I'd like to run by you the first is that there's a former
[54:54.780 --> 54:58.780]  United States congressman from the Youngstown area by the name of James
[54:58.780 --> 55:04.740]  Trafficant and he used the rage against the corruption of the federal government
[55:04.740 --> 55:08.660]  on we have been fighting we have been we've talked to his wife we've we've
[55:08.660 --> 55:13.020]  we've talked to other talk show hosts who've had him on and anybody who can get
[55:13.020 --> 55:17.580]  traffic hand on with us we want to get him on the show okay because he was just
[55:17.580 --> 55:21.740]  recently released from jail and I'm pretty sure he wants to be heard no I
[55:21.740 --> 55:26.660]  know I mean listen he goes on little local Youngstown Ohio radio stations
[55:26.660 --> 55:31.700]  fact that we have any luck Nihart with that talk show host that come on air
[55:31.700 --> 55:38.700]  to the I'm well it's all right yeah yeah we're working on getting and I mean I
[55:38.700 --> 55:41.980]  want you to know we are working on getting James Trafficant yes wonderful
[55:41.980 --> 55:46.540]  hey the second point I want to bring up is that years ago I remember reading
[55:46.540 --> 55:51.100]  something about this and I'm I can't find primary source material about this
[55:51.100 --> 55:54.940]  and I don't remember seeing it in that 9-11 documentaries but I remember
[55:54.940 --> 55:59.500]  seeing something about a Patriot missile system being installed on the
[55:59.500 --> 56:03.060]  Sarasota Beach resort that Bush was staying at a couple of days before the
[56:03.060 --> 56:10.660]  attack I don't remember seeing that no because there's one site that I found
[56:10.660 --> 56:17.100]  online called killtown.com and it mentions it and I thought I read
[56:17.100 --> 56:20.500]  something years ago in the newspaper about it but if any of your listeners
[56:20.500 --> 56:24.420]  or any of your staff or anybody can find out any primary source material about
[56:24.420 --> 56:30.140]  that I think it well if you try to Google a Patriot system installed it by
[56:30.140 --> 56:34.340]  Bush or something by his brother because of the martial law that he declared a
[56:34.340 --> 56:38.420]  few days ago that was that was that was in the associated press and in the
[56:38.420 --> 56:42.940]  Florida newspapers that he declared martial law September 9th and put the
[56:42.940 --> 56:48.820]  National Guard on alert for a terror attack and so that is confirmed okay
[56:48.820 --> 56:52.180]  yeah I think part of it was to put a Patriot missile system on top of the
[56:52.180 --> 56:57.900]  beach resort but I can't find primary source material okay I will look into
[56:57.900 --> 57:01.900]  that that's very important I appreciate your call good to hear from you John
[57:01.900 --> 57:07.300]  let's go ahead and talk to Greg in North Dakota Greg you're on the air good
[57:07.300 --> 57:11.060]  morning nice to talk with you talk with you Alex nice talk to you buddy what's
[57:11.060 --> 57:14.220]  up yeah I just want to tell you that I think that you made a really good
[57:14.220 --> 57:21.340]  choice with Jason to do your show at night he's very competent and I have a
[57:21.340 --> 57:27.220]  few suggestions for you that generation RX I watched that film and I was very
[57:27.220 --> 57:31.100]  impressed with it I think that the a lot of people would be very interested in
[57:31.100 --> 57:35.420]  have a better outlook on the FDA if they were to able to view that on your
[57:35.420 --> 57:40.940]  site yeah well that's not my film so I can't put it on prisonplanet.tv but I
[57:40.940 --> 57:45.220]  do I did buy it and bulk from them and we do sell it in the online video book
[57:45.220 --> 57:49.500]  store at infowars.com but yes whatever I see that I think is important and
[57:49.500 --> 57:53.580]  informative I try to buy it and I try to make it available to the listeners
[57:53.580 --> 57:57.220]  generally discounted as well and generation RX shows how they're drugging
[57:57.220 --> 58:01.580]  now 20% of our kids how it's causing them to commit suicide how they know that
[58:01.580 --> 58:05.540]  the serotonin reuptake inhibitors do this how the Ritalin type drugs screw up
[58:05.540 --> 58:10.060]  their hearts and brains and it's a very important film for anybody who's got
[58:10.060 --> 58:14.940]  children because the system is going to push drugs on your children and we have
[58:14.940 --> 58:19.700]  to fight back against this anything else Greg well I just want to say that I
[58:19.700 --> 58:24.620]  think you should get a just say no shirt and underneath that shirt you should
[58:24.620 --> 58:29.500]  put some of the things like for instance say no to Obama say no to the
[58:29.500 --> 58:32.940]  health care you know and maybe just say yes to liberty on the back of it
[58:32.940 --> 58:36.460]  something like that legalized liberty liberty I keep making meaning to make a

[1:01:30.940 --> 1:01:34.860]  been a long time I've been a listener for many years and I won't let you know
[1:01:34.860 --> 1:01:40.780]  that as the enemy of liberty comes in like a flood the creator has risen up a
[1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:45.500]  standard to carry on the work of yourself and dr. Paul I'm a student there's a
[1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:50.100]  couple things I want to hit on Alex first off this financial regulation bill
[1:01:50.100 --> 1:01:56.220]  that was just introduced by Geithner and his bosses obviously Goldman funded
[1:01:56.220 --> 1:02:00.180]  blink fiend just wrote an editorial so these guys really want this thing it's
[1:02:00.180 --> 1:02:06.100]  going to create a new carte blanche regular regulatory authority with
[1:02:06.100 --> 1:02:09.940]  unlimited contracts unlimited pay the price of financial power so to speak
[1:02:09.940 --> 1:02:17.100]  would you agree yes we have the financial parasitic false economy the paper
[1:02:17.100 --> 1:02:22.260]  economy waging war against Main Street against private property against the
[1:02:22.260 --> 1:02:27.300]  individual they're using a socialist system to take our wealth and transfer it
[1:02:27.300 --> 1:02:31.180]  offshore to themselves and now as I said a year ago as we said the Obama
[1:02:31.180 --> 1:02:35.220]  deception as we cover and fall the republic the new quote bailout or
[1:02:35.220 --> 1:02:39.780]  financial regulatory system will be run they admit by the private Federal
[1:02:39.780 --> 1:02:44.180]  Reserve and the very Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase and others that have run
[1:02:44.180 --> 1:02:49.020]  the whole Ponzi scheme into an even bigger scam and they hold the economy
[1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:54.460]  hostage saying give us unlimited power or the economy will die as they kill the
[1:02:54.460 --> 1:02:59.580]  economy and it's all happening right now so either we identify the bankers have
[1:02:59.580 --> 1:03:03.140]  the bankers indicted and arrested and finally bring them to justice or they're
[1:03:03.140 --> 1:03:06.820]  able to carry their scam through to their ultimate goal of total world
[1:03:06.820 --> 1:03:12.140]  financial dictatorship absolutely I've got two two other things I want to head
[1:03:12.140 --> 1:03:16.740]  on if you have a time for me but in Massachusetts we just saw the totalitarian
[1:03:16.740 --> 1:03:21.820]  technology cemented into law where the barbarism of pillage has been legalized
[1:03:21.820 --> 1:03:26.940]  so long as it is in quote good faith you see that two three four five times on
[1:03:26.940 --> 1:03:31.620]  each page of that bill it is for sakes our warrant system what's left of it
[1:03:31.620 --> 1:03:35.900]  the Bayes corpus is gone and by definition it is a bill of attaining
[1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:41.620]  there because those who do not agree with what the state authority say when
[1:03:41.620 --> 1:03:44.660]  this emergency is declared will automatically be jailed the property
[1:03:44.660 --> 1:03:49.540]  taken that's what they say you know that's what they say they'll take your
[1:03:49.540 --> 1:03:53.460]  house take everything you got and clap your hands and all over the country the
[1:03:53.460 --> 1:03:57.100]  feds are funding knock and talk where police are showing up from even in
[1:03:57.100 --> 1:04:00.340]  states like Texas where you never think it would happen they're showing up in
[1:04:00.340 --> 1:04:03.020]  Dallas and Houston saying we like to come in your house and inspect your
[1:04:03.020 --> 1:04:07.140]  firearms without a warrant and they literally push their way past they show
[1:04:07.140 --> 1:04:11.260]  up in the middle of the day they case the records of the home and know that
[1:04:11.260 --> 1:04:15.620]  it's a woman at home alone it is absolutely criminal the government is
[1:04:15.620 --> 1:04:22.060]  completely parasitic and out of control absolutely now lastly up mr. Jones I

[1:09:31.700 --> 1:09:37.060]  Foreign Relations documents Pentagon documents where they were openly saying
[1:09:37.060 --> 1:09:41.460]  they were going to set up a world banking system with total control with carbon
[1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:45.540]  taxes over everything you do that the state was going to have year-round
[1:09:45.540 --> 1:09:49.060]  schooling to take control of the family that they were going to set up a
[1:09:49.060 --> 1:09:53.980]  tattletale spy system that they were going to put paramilitary police and
[1:09:53.980 --> 1:09:58.940]  regular military on the streets not just of the United States but of Germany and
[1:09:58.940 --> 1:10:07.700]  England and Australia and Canada worldwide in the industrialized West this
[1:10:07.700 --> 1:10:11.900]  is a global corporate takeover it's called globalization it's called the
[1:10:11.900 --> 1:10:17.620]  new world order it's called global governance and you watch senator J
[1:10:17.620 --> 1:10:21.220]  Rockefeller's committee meetings on C-span you watch Gordon Brown give
[1:10:21.220 --> 1:10:26.860]  speeches you watch the Davos Switzerland summits and everybody on the podium calls
[1:10:26.860 --> 1:10:33.140]  for new world order global governance I've got clip after clip and follow the
[1:10:33.140 --> 1:10:39.580]  Republic there were scores of clips I didn't even put in it there's too many
[1:10:39.580 --> 1:10:46.620]  my new film it's a joke not only do we have world government forming openly but
[1:10:46.620 --> 1:10:50.780]  it's private it's corrupt you have no due process you have no liberty you have
[1:10:50.780 --> 1:10:54.980]  no freedom and what the establishment did all these years while myself and
[1:10:54.980 --> 1:10:58.940]  others were fighting it was denied existed we go look we have a CFR document
[1:10:58.940 --> 1:11:05.580]  look we have a UN document but we have a State Department document and the local
[1:11:05.580 --> 1:11:08.940]  radio the TV the media bought and paid for by the government that's now all
[1:11:08.940 --> 1:11:13.980]  declassified in public the Pentagon is being paid off the Pentagon's paying off
[1:11:13.980 --> 1:11:20.740]  the media so foreign banks can still trillions this is a heist going on they
[1:11:20.740 --> 1:11:25.700]  would demonize you and make jokes or have a TV show about the private fellow
[1:11:25.700 --> 1:11:31.820]  reserve and next to Bacabras and after that flying saucers to discredit the
[1:11:31.820 --> 1:11:38.140]  real fact of the Federal Reserve by mixing it in with space aliens and the
[1:11:38.140 --> 1:11:43.380]  rest of it so the public wouldn't listen and now they're announcing open
[1:11:43.380 --> 1:11:48.540]  world government on the mainstream television and the end of the dollar and
[1:11:48.540 --> 1:11:51.900]  they're announcing a new private bank of the world formed around the
[1:11:51.900 --> 1:11:59.020]  international monetary fund will control it the bank steal 23.7 trillion in the
[1:11:59.020 --> 1:12:02.500]  first 10 months of the bailout it's now been more than a year since the bailout
[1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:08.740]  but we haven't gotten new numbers in up two months and a week and a half but
[1:12:08.740 --> 1:12:13.820]  Bloomberg AP and Reuters report 23.7 trillion if you follow the graph it'll
[1:12:13.820 --> 1:12:18.020]  be over 28 trillion the next time they give us the number normally it's every
[1:12:18.020 --> 1:12:23.180]  two months they're due to give the new numbers any day and if it follows the
[1:12:23.180 --> 1:12:31.820]  graph it'll be 28.4 trillion but I've got Congress reporting 23.7 trillion in
[1:12:31.820 --> 1:12:37.100]  fall the Republic and they admit that the banks are hoarding the money and not
[1:12:37.100 --> 1:12:42.140]  loaning it and imploding the economy by design and then giving record bonuses I
[1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:45.500]  was reading about different private banks in England and Goldman Sachs
[1:12:45.500 --> 1:12:53.780]  brokerage firms and JP Morgan Chase and others the average bonus in London England
[1:12:53.780 --> 1:13:00.100]  for the brokerage firms for the average for low-level employees that means
[1:13:00.100 --> 1:13:05.620]  secretaries was 840 plus thousand dollars
[1:13:05.620 --> 1:13:15.540]  300 something thousand pounds over 400,000 pounds you can pull these articles up
[1:13:15.540 --> 1:13:21.500]  high-level people got 15 million dollar bonuses on average I mean this is in the
[1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:26.620]  Wall Street Journal of your bailout money it's the same numbers at AIG same
[1:13:26.620 --> 1:13:30.500]  stuff in some cases worse and I have mainstream news reporting like it's
[1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:35.860]  completely kosher and normal that Goldman Sachs is getting the biggest
[1:13:35.860 --> 1:13:44.740]  bonuses in their history company wide some of the bank heads are getting
[1:13:44.740 --> 1:13:52.620]  billion dollar plus bonuses billion dollar plus bonuses a piece I mean go
[1:13:52.620 --> 1:13:58.820]  read the bonuses in my stack I've got some articles that list them I'll go
[1:13:58.820 --> 1:14:01.580]  over that later with Bob Chapman when he's on with us next hour from the
[1:14:01.580 --> 1:14:04.220]  international forecaster covering the economy and what's happening with the
[1:14:04.220 --> 1:14:12.380]  dollar and I sit here and I have people all over the street and everywhere I go
[1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:15.860]  say oh Alex you know you were right the conspiracy theories coming true it
[1:14:15.860 --> 1:14:20.980]  wasn't a conspiracy theory when you read what the Club of Rome and the
[1:14:20.980 --> 1:14:24.980]  international organizations are saying like the Royal Institute of
[1:14:24.980 --> 1:14:28.780]  International Affairs the CFR when you read what they say they're going to
[1:14:28.780 --> 1:14:35.420]  do they're going to do it Homeland Security in 2003 when they first became
[1:14:35.420 --> 1:14:40.660]  a cabinet position I watched Ridge on C-Span say that they're gonna have
[1:14:40.660 --> 1:14:44.860]  checkpoints on the street and the malls and then all of America will be like a
[1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:50.020]  giant airport that's how I knew this would happen and now it's happening the
[1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:54.780]  Pentagon said before 9-11 they were gonna use terrorism to deploy troops in the
[1:14:54.780 --> 1:14:58.900]  streets of America and that they were gonna set up Homeland Security I read
[1:14:58.900 --> 1:15:04.020]  that from documents in 1993 and they would set up a North comm like sent com
[1:15:04.020 --> 1:15:12.700]  and South com and African and now they've done it I mean all I do is tell
[1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:17.180]  you what they're saying I mean the White House science are has written 10 books
[1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:27.900]  we know about one of them 1054 pages long John P. Holdren eco science where
[1:15:27.900 --> 1:15:32.060]  they say we need to put stuff in the water to sterilize the people we need to
[1:15:32.060 --> 1:15:35.060]  have year-round school we need to take the kids away from the parents that's
[1:15:35.060 --> 1:15:38.660]  the only the state will be able to totally take over I mean it's all here
[1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:46.220]  I'm holding in my hand a 1054 page book and I read most of it I scanned through
[1:15:46.220 --> 1:15:51.460]  the whole stinking thing we scanned online at prisonplanet.com hundreds of
[1:15:51.460 --> 1:15:56.380]  pages of the stinking thing since then listeners have found university sites
[1:15:56.380 --> 1:16:01.020]  that have it for free the entire thing just Google eco science ebook you can
[1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:05.660]  read the stinking thing for free don't you sit there and tell me I'm making this
[1:16:05.660 --> 1:16:14.540]  up when this is right here in my hand you can't afford it I'm talking to
[1:16:14.540 --> 1:16:20.220]  neocons and fake liberals tuning in we're all in serious danger we need every
[1:16:20.220 --> 1:16:28.700]  able-bodied man woman a child to wake up and to realize what's going on and to
[1:16:28.700 --> 1:16:34.060]  get up off your butts and realize the type of serious hardcore emergency
[1:16:34.060 --> 1:16:38.900]  situation we're in do you know what world government means they openly state
[1:16:38.900 --> 1:16:43.380]  in every globalist document they brag on NPR a decade ago I'd hear them oh yes
[1:16:43.380 --> 1:16:46.500]  under globalization we will lower the standard of living of the people of the
[1:16:46.500 --> 1:16:50.180]  United States because we have too big a carbon footprint and we know it'll be
[1:16:50.180 --> 1:16:54.180]  good for us and we'll help the third world raising them up lowering us raising
[1:16:54.180 --> 1:16:57.780]  that they're not gonna raise you read the internal documents not the public PR
[1:16:57.780 --> 1:17:01.820]  stuff and they talk about how they're gonna wreck the third world by design
[1:17:01.820 --> 1:17:05.180]  the Royal Commission on Population published by the British government go
[1:17:05.180 --> 1:17:12.340]  read the stinking thing it's public and you read what the carbon bill that past
[1:17:12.340 --> 1:17:19.620]  the house does it gives 35 federal agencies unlimited carte blanche power
[1:17:19.620 --> 1:17:23.660]  to do whatever they want just like they've got bills introduced where the
[1:17:23.660 --> 1:17:28.620]  attorney general can ban any and all guns under fiat executive power it gives
[1:17:28.620 --> 1:17:34.180]  him godlike dictator status don't read the bills we give you the bill numbers
[1:17:34.180 --> 1:17:44.140]  guns of America has them listed owners dot org just Google the term bill would
[1:17:44.140 --> 1:17:49.540]  allow attorney general to ban any gun he wishes Swartz and anger two weeks ago

[1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:57.980]  this is a military tactic they say we're not introducing amnesty legislation but
[1:17:57.980 --> 1:18:00.660]  we're not gonna let you see the legislation three years ago the senator
[1:18:00.660 --> 1:18:04.620]  sessions leaked it and the thing was worse than amnesty legalized illegal

[1:22:02.220 --> 1:22:05.300]  of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the
[1:22:05.300 --> 1:22:09.340]  risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no
[1:22:09.340 --> 1:22:12.740]  surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash
[1:22:12.740 --> 1:22:16.140]  depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system
[1:22:16.140 --> 1:22:19.820]  means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate
[1:22:19.820 --> 1:22:23.460]  withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government
[1:22:23.460 --> 1:22:27.460]  is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[1:22:27.460 --> 1:22:31.300]  a current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to
[1:22:31.300 --> 1:22:34.900]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[1:22:34.900 --> 1:22:39.140]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve
[1:22:39.140 --> 1:22:43.380]  strength and stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments
[1:22:43.380 --> 1:22:47.900]  to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently
[1:22:47.900 --> 1:22:53.060]  have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for

[1:24:18.820 --> 1:24:24.100]  America has to fall billionaire investor in philanthropist George Soros he's a
[1:24:24.100 --> 1:24:28.100]  criminal convicted criminal but he's a philanthropist said Thursday the world's
[1:24:28.100 --> 1:24:31.940]  current currency arrangements are fraught with danger and the world needs a
[1:24:31.940 --> 1:24:36.140]  global regulation see they're all calling for the new bank of the world and so
[1:24:36.140 --> 1:24:40.660]  are the criminals running the Federal Reserve Soros who runs hedge funds from
[1:24:40.660 --> 1:24:45.300]  Soros fund management and has made the reputation with bond currency bets so the
[1:24:45.300 --> 1:24:48.780]  U.S. dollar ought to be falling in value against the Chinese currency to allow the
[1:24:48.780 --> 1:24:54.780]  United States to contain its current account deficit that's the type of news
[1:24:54.780 --> 1:25:02.740]  we have here and I was just mailed by a listener a Houston post article from May
[1:25:02.740 --> 1:25:07.940]  5th 1970 flu shots defended but growing number of elderly were fused
[1:25:07.940 --> 1:25:13.820]  vaccine even then always trying to force it saying you're crazy saying you're
[1:25:13.820 --> 1:25:18.180]  bad if you won't take the shot we're gonna show that we go live at prison
[1:25:18.180 --> 1:25:22.900]  planet dot TV summer casting the radio show online at prison planet TV next
[1:25:22.900 --> 1:25:27.700]  hour let's continue with your phone calls here in the first hour I covered
[1:25:27.700 --> 1:25:31.580]  how every week or so I see news articles where if you even argue with a
[1:25:31.580 --> 1:25:35.180]  stewardess with a flight attendant you get arrested and charged under the
[1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:41.580]  Patriot Act and a big political operative consultant with no criminal record
[1:25:41.580 --> 1:25:46.580]  flying in from South America into DC argued with a stewardess quietly they
[1:25:46.580 --> 1:25:52.740]  said he made an ugly face center and questioned her and that's all it says
[1:25:52.740 --> 1:25:56.220]  and he's being charged under the Patriot Act oh yes got to fight that
[1:25:56.220 --> 1:26:01.420]  al-Qaeda let's go back to the calls sir Jay in Florida thanks for holding her
[1:26:01.420 --> 1:26:07.700]  on the air thank you guys for taking my call I have a question what do you think
[1:26:07.700 --> 1:26:13.820]  the future of Russia is and is Russia in opposition to new world order and what
[1:26:13.820 --> 1:26:19.740]  is the role for it no Russia Russia is is somewhat against the Anglo-American
[1:26:19.740 --> 1:26:24.260]  British US dominated new world order but the banks that were based here are now
[1:26:24.260 --> 1:26:28.940]  moving to a more global role sucking us dry to fund setting up their larger
[1:26:28.940 --> 1:26:33.180]  system and moving a lot of their operations to Europe China and India
[1:26:33.180 --> 1:26:37.100]  Russia just wants to have its own stake that their government openly talks
[1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:40.780]  about the world government about the new world order they tell their public not
[1:26:40.780 --> 1:26:44.460]  to take the flu shots that it's meant to sterilize them so it's just all over
[1:26:44.460 --> 1:26:50.140]  Russian TV and Putin has breeding campaigns for the young people to try
[1:26:50.140 --> 1:26:54.460]  to raise their birth numbers because they're dying like the West they have a
[1:26:54.460 --> 1:26:59.860]  1.3 for every two adults they only have 1.3 children and so they're bucking the
[1:26:59.860 --> 1:27:05.020]  new world order but only for their own personal power and Putin did kick out six
[1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:08.300]  top oligarchs that were working for the Rothschilds and Rockefellers that's in
[1:27:08.300 --> 1:27:13.580]  the times of London but just because I ran in Russia aren't with the big
[1:27:13.580 --> 1:27:17.140]  powerful new world order doesn't mean they're not as crooked as a barrel of
[1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:22.340]  snakes but yes they want their own new world order but you can Google that
[1:27:22.340 --> 1:27:25.740]  headline Russia wants its own new world order and you'll see hundreds of
[1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:30.540]  statements by Putin and Medvedev and others where they're saying this but
[1:27:30.540 --> 1:27:35.820]  but yes it isn't just on the surface the new world order is not all powerful yet
[1:27:35.820 --> 1:27:40.100]  the the globalist controlled one and Russia is not fully under their control
[1:27:40.100 --> 1:27:44.700]  that's why the US launched a sneak attack on Russia in Georgia on 888 along
[1:27:44.700 --> 1:27:49.180]  with NATO and Israel trying to start World War 3 but it didn't work and so
[1:27:49.180 --> 1:27:54.220]  it's very very serious what's happening I was watching they I was actually
[1:27:54.220 --> 1:27:58.460]  reading a lot about the history of Russia I was raised in Russia and you know
[1:27:58.460 --> 1:28:02.140]  what's interesting when I moved to US I realized that many things that you
[1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:06.620]  talking about has happened in Russia in the last 70 years like they have
[1:28:06.620 --> 1:28:15.220]  managed control of age of population and increase of it's been it's been around
[1:28:15.220 --> 1:28:23.260]  130 540 million people in the last 70 years it's been sitting there and it's
[1:28:23.260 --> 1:28:27.940]  just interesting so many things are crossing my mind I find answers in what
[1:28:27.940 --> 1:28:33.060]  you're talking about what has happened there for the last 70 years and I
[1:28:33.060 --> 1:28:39.620]  personally saw when the Great Wall fell down I saw a huge design of globalization
[1:28:39.620 --> 1:28:43.620]  and things that were implemented in Russia kind of spilling out in the rest
[1:28:43.620 --> 1:28:48.140]  of the world what do you think yes a deal was made to bring Russia fully into
[1:28:48.140 --> 1:28:53.500]  the new world order and not use it as a bipolar system so they could build a
[1:28:53.500 --> 1:28:57.380]  police state here the name of fighting Russia once the police state was built
[1:28:57.380 --> 1:29:02.300]  and once we were socialized then Russia could be imploded and taken over by the
[1:29:02.300 --> 1:29:06.060]  oligarchs but it does appear that the Russians have kicked out many of the
[1:29:06.060 --> 1:29:13.940]  oligarchs and are in control of their own system what do you think I think it's
[1:29:13.940 --> 1:29:20.620]  it might be a double game I it's very hard to tell because they've been very
[1:29:20.620 --> 1:29:24.780]  very creative in playing this double or triple game in the last seven very
[1:29:24.780 --> 1:29:30.420]  slick very very sophisticated well the Russians are the best at playing chess
[1:29:30.420 --> 1:29:36.260]  I appreciate your call absolutely very sophisticated new world order game it's

[1:38:51.380 --> 1:38:54.980]  walked into his office to hold a security meeting in the morning of 911 he
[1:38:54.980 --> 1:38:59.380]  got advanced knowledge of the South Tower's imminent collapse and we've
[1:38:59.380 --> 1:39:02.780]  talked to folks that translated this from Danish they've confirmed it's an exact
[1:39:02.780 --> 1:39:08.500]  translation that we have in the video I am told the first tower has completely
[1:39:08.500 --> 1:39:12.260]  collapsed I received a message five ten minutes before it physically happened
[1:39:12.260 --> 1:39:16.500]  saying there was impending danger the tower would collapse so I knew disaster
[1:39:16.500 --> 1:39:20.180]  was coming said Rasmussen Rasmussen added that the imminent collapse of the
[1:39:20.180 --> 1:39:23.780]  building was confirmed as soon as he entered his office the Danish Prime
[1:39:23.780 --> 1:39:26.980]  Minister was not the only high-level official to receive advanced knowledge
[1:39:26.980 --> 1:39:30.860]  that the World Trade Center was going to collapse during an interview on 911
[1:39:30.860 --> 1:39:35.780]  with ABC's Peter Jennings the New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani stated and we have
[1:39:35.780 --> 1:39:39.500]  this video clip under it I went down to the scene and we set up the headquarters
[1:39:39.500 --> 1:39:43.180]  at 75 Berkeley Street which was right there with the police commissioner and
[1:39:43.180 --> 1:39:46.020]  the fire commissioner the head of emergency management and we were
[1:39:46.020 --> 1:39:49.420]  operating out of there we were told that the World Trade Center was going to
[1:39:49.420 --> 1:39:53.100]  collapse and it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building
[1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:56.620]  so we were trapped in the building for five or ten minutes and finally found
[1:39:56.620 --> 1:40:00.740]  that exit got out walked north and took a lot of people with us and the eight
[1:40:00.740 --> 1:40:04.980]  years since the attack Giuliani has failed to explain first he denied he said
[1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:09.980]  how and why he received advanced knowledge of the unprecedented event and
[1:40:09.980 --> 1:40:15.060]  why that event warning was not passed on to those inside the towers who had been
[1:40:15.060 --> 1:40:19.860]  told to remain in the office via loudspeakers run by building seven the
[1:40:19.860 --> 1:40:26.700]  emergency city center after the first plane struck at 846 a.m
[1:40:27.660 --> 1:40:32.460]  some people it's not clear how many returned to their offices after
[1:40:32.460 --> 1:40:36.140]  announcements on the building's emergency loudspeaker system that said it was
[1:40:36.140 --> 1:40:40.420]  safe to stay in the South Tower reports USA today after the sub headline
[1:40:40.420 --> 1:40:44.300]  announcements caused deaths adding that some that sounded like an order to
[1:40:44.300 --> 1:40:48.180]  return not an option yes they said go to your chairs or you'll get in trouble
[1:40:48.180 --> 1:40:52.380]  this was all run by building seven with the CIA command base in it that tower
[1:40:52.380 --> 1:41:01.340]  later fell at 5 25 p.m. Eastern Standard Time percent Eastern Time that fell and
[1:41:01.340 --> 1:41:07.980]  what did BBC world and BBC 24 report simultaneously 25 minutes before it
[1:41:07.980 --> 1:41:15.620]  fell they reported simultaneously on two channels off the teleprompter with
[1:41:15.620 --> 1:41:18.500]  building seven in the background that the Solomon Brothers building building
[1:41:18.500 --> 1:41:23.100]  seven the same building giving the orders early in the day to stay at their
[1:41:23.100 --> 1:41:27.460]  desk that it had fallen from fire into its own footprint and completely
[1:41:27.460 --> 1:41:32.300]  collapsed then they gave the cover story because of fire then they had bizarre
[1:41:32.300 --> 1:41:36.100]  operatives who's no one been able to identify clearly reading scripts
[1:41:36.100 --> 1:41:43.140]  separately all over the news at ground zero as the towers fell saying yes it
[1:41:43.140 --> 1:41:46.980]  fell from structural damage the heat melted the steel not saying who they
[1:41:46.980 --> 1:41:53.100]  were outputting the official story out when BBC was first caught doing this no
[1:41:53.100 --> 1:41:58.260]  one noticed for about two years after or three years after 9-11 that they done
[1:41:58.260 --> 1:42:01.460]  these not live newscast but the archives were put out by BBC so people went
[1:42:01.460 --> 1:42:05.340]  through them and watched them they said oh we've lost the tapes we didn't really
[1:42:05.340 --> 1:42:10.900]  report that those were fake newscast and they said okay we actually reported
[1:42:10.900 --> 1:42:14.540]  after it had fallen that had the time stamp wrong they said no we just messed
[1:42:14.540 --> 1:42:20.020]  up it did fall early then BBC made a documentary about it and said actually
[1:42:20.020 --> 1:42:28.300]  Reuters sent us an internal news feed saying it had fallen this was just like
[1:42:28.300 --> 1:42:33.420]  with JFK in Australia New Zealand and Thailand newspapers reported in some
[1:42:33.420 --> 1:42:38.860]  cases an hour before he was even announced on the news before he'd even
[1:42:38.860 --> 1:42:50.380]  been captured that Lee Harvey Oswald had shot JFK in Dallas in 1963 that is
[1:42:50.380 --> 1:42:59.460]  absolute 100% smoking gun fact that it was an inside job
[1:42:59.460 --> 1:43:05.620]  Giuliani also announced on the same TV show on ABC and CBS that it was a good
[1:43:05.620 --> 1:43:08.980]  thing they were doing a terror attack drill on the World Trade Center complex
[1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:14.460]  that day so they had moved the night before the command center the city
[1:43:14.460 --> 1:43:17.580]  emergency command center was in the building the FBI the CIA defense
[1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:21.900]  intelligence and others as well it was a huge government complex leased from
[1:43:21.900 --> 1:43:27.140]  Silverstein with all of his intelligence background they said that they
[1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:34.220]  had moved in an anti-terror drill to come to a mobile command center out on
[1:43:34.220 --> 1:43:39.540]  the pier the night before Mr. Kennedy the head spokesman for FEMA that day
[1:43:39.540 --> 1:43:44.220]  also on ABC News said yes we were told to be there September 10th for the attack
[1:43:44.220 --> 1:43:48.180]  he then lied and said he'd messed up the day he was incorrect but then later in
[1:43:48.180 --> 1:43:52.220]  testimony had to admit that indeed they were running tripod to terror attack
[1:43:52.220 --> 1:43:59.900]  drill just like on the 7-7 bombing the government was running a drill of the
[1:43:59.900 --> 1:44:04.020]  exact same trains and exact same bus being bombed at the exact same time who
[1:44:04.020 --> 1:44:08.260]  do we know this from the former head spokesman of Scotland Yard who was the
[1:44:08.260 --> 1:44:15.420]  private consultancy firm visor consultancy went on BBC TV radio and ITN on
[1:44:15.420 --> 1:44:21.500]  7-7 in 2005 for the London bombings within hours of it and said it's
[1:44:21.500 --> 1:44:25.580]  incredible we were running a drill of the exact same locations being attacked
[1:44:25.580 --> 1:44:31.660]  at the exact same time an actuary by an insurance actuary expert was done it was
[1:44:31.660 --> 1:44:37.580]  one out of 23 truck to Gillian truck to Gillian is trillions of times more than
[1:44:37.580 --> 1:44:44.860]  all the grains of sand in the world nearing infinity theoretically it is
[1:44:44.860 --> 1:44:53.700]  infinity now you don't question 9-11 that's why six of the 10 9-11 commissioners
[1:44:53.700 --> 1:44:58.780]  have come out saying it was quote a cover-up a takeover a lie farmer the
[1:44:58.780 --> 1:45:02.700]  head lawyer says it's a criminal cover-up in a book coming out that the
[1:45:02.700 --> 1:45:05.660]  Pentagon was lying the White House was lying and there should be a criminal
[1:45:05.660 --> 1:45:10.020]  investigation now don't sit there and call me a tinfoil hat wearer when I
[1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:19.900]  just gave you all that information now I'm gonna play this just for record now
[1:45:19.900 --> 1:45:24.780]  this is subtitled Dutch but it's short I'm gonna play the Danish Prime Minister
[1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:28.900]  at the time this is him now on television saying that they were told the
[1:45:28.900 --> 1:45:34.020]  towers we're gonna fall before they fell then we're gonna play Giuliani clip
[1:45:34.020 --> 1:45:37.300]  after that here it is
[1:45:37.300 --> 1:45:58.940]  post-90s
[1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:05.940]  10 minutes before, it's physically happening that now there is a risk of the tunnel collapsing.
[1:46:05.940 --> 1:46:09.940]  So I knew the catastrophe was on the way and it was so incredibly powerful.
[1:46:09.940 --> 1:46:28.940]  Here's Rudolf Giuliani on ABC News saying basically the same thing and it's just amazing.
[1:46:28.940 --> 1:46:39.940]  It looked like you were deeply sharing the horror that all of us feel, but I'd really appreciate, aside from on top of your sentiments about all this, give us some sense of what's going on.
[1:46:39.940 --> 1:46:49.940]  What's going on now is a massive rescue effort. We have thousands of police officers and fire fighters in all of Manhattan trying to rescue as many people as we possibly can.
[1:46:49.940 --> 1:47:00.940]  There are still a lot of people there that are injured, hurt, dazed and we're trying to get them out and we're mobilizing all of our fire, police and emergency resources to do that.
[1:47:00.940 --> 1:47:08.940]  The governor has alerted the National Guard and they're being deployed to come and relieve us early till later this afternoon.
[1:47:08.940 --> 1:47:24.940]  The urban search and rescue teams are coming here from around the country to also assist us, but until then, which means until probably 2, 3, 4 o'clock this afternoon, our police department, our fire department and our emergency people are being stretched to the limit.
[1:47:24.940 --> 1:47:29.940]  I'm sure we've also lost a significant number of them.
[1:47:29.940 --> 1:47:37.940]  You're reluctant, I assume, to put any other name attached to the casualties, except significant. Do you believe it's hundreds or thousands?
[1:47:37.940 --> 1:47:48.940]  I really don't want to say right now, Peter. I think it's going to be a horrible number. I saw people jumping out of the World Trade Center.
[1:47:48.940 --> 1:47:56.940]  I saw some of the firefighters who I know going into the building and we were in a building in which we were trapped for about 10, 15 minutes.
[1:47:56.940 --> 1:48:00.940]  Did you go immediately to the Office of Emergency Management?
[1:48:00.940 --> 1:48:09.940]  I went down to the scene and we set up a headquarters at 75 Barkley Street, which was right there with the Police Commissioner, the Fire Commissioner, the Head of Emergency Management.
[1:48:09.940 --> 1:48:18.940]  And we were operating out of there when we were told that the World Trade Center was going to collapse and it did collapse before we could actually get out of the building.
[1:48:18.940 --> 1:48:26.940]  So we were trapped in the building for 10, 15 minutes and finally found an exit and got out, walked north and took a lot of people with us.
[1:48:26.940 --> 1:48:33.940]  The question is, the Office of Emergency Management headquarters, into which you put enormous effort for coordination in a disaster like this.
[1:48:33.940 --> 1:48:36.940]  Has it been damaged? Is it still operating? It's gone?
[1:48:36.940 --> 1:48:49.940]  It's been damaged. I don't know how badly. And right now, that whole area of Manhattan, including the Police Department, which is another area we would operate from, City Hall, is another area we would operate from, has been closed off.
[1:48:49.940 --> 1:48:54.940]  So we've moved to a secure location in Midtown Manhattan where we're operating City Government.
[1:48:54.940 --> 1:49:01.940]  Is it fair to say, do you think that all of your drills for dealing with terrorism and disaster are going according to plan?
[1:49:01.940 --> 1:49:07.940]  Or has this been of such a magnitude that we've just all been caught totally off balance?
[1:49:07.940 --> 1:49:19.940]  There's no question we were all caught totally off balance. No one could possibly expect large airplanes to crash into the World Trade Center the way this happened.
[1:49:19.940 --> 1:49:30.940]  I think, having said that, as I watched what the police officers and the firefighters were doing, I think they're going to save the maximum number of lives you could possibly save in a situation like this.
[1:49:30.940 --> 1:49:39.940]  I mean, the emergency efforts that they've been going through over the last two, two and a half hours are nothing short of inspiring.
[1:49:39.940 --> 1:49:42.940]  And when the National Guard comes in, you say to take over?
[1:49:42.940 --> 1:49:52.940]  I wanted to play it in the full unedited clip, as people always say that we're editing this, but there it is from the live feed that morning that day.
[1:49:52.940 --> 1:50:00.940]  And we've got clip after clip after clip of firemen and police on video.
[1:50:00.940 --> 1:50:11.940]  And they're in my film Terror Storm. They're in the film Truth Rising on 9-11 covering 9-11.
[1:50:11.940 --> 1:50:17.940]  When the police and firemen are saying, we've been told to get back, they're going to blow up Building 7.
[1:50:17.940 --> 1:50:23.940]  They're going to bring it down. And I've interviewed those police officers and firemen and medical workers on this show.
[1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:30.940]  I've gone to New York and interviewed them. I've had them on the radio.
[1:50:30.940 --> 1:50:36.940]  And the 9-11 truth debunkers say, oh, you're saying they did the attacks. That's how they spin it. No, they were told to get back.
[1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:41.940]  You can't ignore these videos. It's live on CNN and Fox and Get Back.
[1:50:41.940 --> 1:50:47.940]  They say they're going to blow it up. Run for your lives. We're not supposed to question this.
[1:50:47.940 --> 1:50:55.940]  The government's done all these medical experiments on veterans and troops and on foster kids killing them with biologicals, radiologicals in the past.
[1:50:55.940 --> 1:51:07.940]  They wouldn't kill 3,000 people on 9-11. They radiated more than 4,000 kids.

[1:52:06.940 --> 1:52:12.940]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:52:12.940 --> 1:52:19.940]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:52:19.940 --> 1:52:23.940]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:23.940 --> 1:52:28.940]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist,
[1:52:28.940 --> 1:52:36.940]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:52:36.940 --> 1:52:40.940]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:52:40.940 --> 1:52:47.940]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.

[1:54:40.940 --> 1:54:45.940]  The Obama deception has been attacked by George Soros and all his publications.
[1:54:45.940 --> 1:54:50.940]  It's been attacked by the New Republic. It's been attacked by Salon.
[1:54:50.940 --> 1:54:57.940]  And they admit it's been devastating. This New World Order frontman who's meant to bankrupt our economy and bring in world government will fall.
[1:54:57.940 --> 1:55:04.940]  The Republic goes even further and shows you who the real enemy is. The foreign offshore banks pre-order it at infowars.com.

[1:55:09.940 --> 1:55:15.940]  So get in line folks. It ships out in order to receive. Let's go back to your phone calls and Bob Chapman's coming up at the gate after.
[1:55:15.940 --> 1:55:19.940]  Let's talk to Paul in Oregon. Paul, good to hear from you.
[1:55:19.940 --> 1:55:27.940]  Thank you for having me on. My kids brought home a waiver yesterday from school.
[1:55:27.940 --> 1:55:35.940]  And the school is wanting the kids to use a new kind of hand sanitizer called benzoconium chloride.
[1:55:35.940 --> 1:55:47.940]  And when I looked this up, first thing I find is an article from 2000 where three doctors got together and they're calling for a worldwide ban of this substance.
[1:55:47.940 --> 1:55:58.940]  My wife also looked it up and found that it was actually developed by the U.S. military to clean surfaces, not for people.
[1:55:58.940 --> 1:56:04.940]  This is huge news. What's the name of the toxic sanitizer?
[1:56:04.940 --> 1:56:20.940]  Benzoconium chloride in the dead instant foam hand sanitizer. And they want the kids to use it for several times a day. And when you read it up on it, it stays on your skin for up to two hours activating on your skin.
[1:56:20.940 --> 1:56:25.940]  Well, number one, this is a very complex, sophisticated, key issue you just brought up.
[1:56:25.940 --> 1:56:31.940]  Number one, the federal government buys all this crap and then has to dump it somewhere so they dump it on the schools.
[1:56:31.940 --> 1:56:43.940]  Number two, nurses over 70% now in major states, like New York, it was 65% a week ago, are refusing any of the flu shots that we were just talking about.
[1:56:43.940 --> 1:56:52.940]  So they're making them use stuff like this and wear masks like wearing a yellow star in Nazi Germany, like, you know, they've done something bad and they're evil.
[1:56:52.940 --> 1:57:08.940]  Also, expanding out from there. So they're trying to force inoculations, set the precedent on the public, treats you like an outcast if you don't, to train everyone in the future and in future outbreaks and staged events and fear mongering.
[1:57:08.940 --> 1:57:16.940]  Four force quarantine and they've got the executive orders on the books to enforce it unconstitutionally if they want.
[1:57:16.940 --> 1:57:23.940]  But look how they have fluoride water for kids. Look at how they try to give kids in public school the fluoride tablets.
[1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:33.940]  Just Google fluoride doubles bone cancer in children. Look, I mean, it's a fact. They know what they're doing. The school teachers don't know.
[1:57:33.940 --> 1:57:38.940]  And yes, if you don't want to take the flu shot and they try to lie and say it's the law, then you demand the waiver.
[1:57:38.940 --> 1:57:42.940]  Then they give you the waiver and say, okay, you got to wear a mask. You got to use this stuff on you.
[1:57:42.940 --> 1:57:54.940]  You need to scan that and fax that email it to Aaron and info wars dot com. Send it to Paul Watson's email to Kurt write a blurb about what the school where this is happening.
[1:57:54.940 --> 1:58:03.940]  Your take on it. You can call yourself John Doe if you want, but scan it in. Send it to us, please, because I want to get this up.
[1:58:03.940 --> 1:58:13.940]  Aaron and info wars. But he's about to go out of town. Actually, I'm sending him to do an interview for a film.
[1:58:13.940 --> 1:58:17.940]  I'm going to put you on hold and I'm going to put you on hold and give you an email to check.
[1:58:17.940 --> 1:58:22.940]  We're going to do that right now. Anything else, sir?
[1:58:22.940 --> 1:58:29.940]  One more thing. My grandfather has a copy of the congressional record from when Bush was in office.
[1:58:29.940 --> 1:58:34.940]  They are planning on confiscating the goal. People are going to be buying up blurb right now.
[1:58:34.940 --> 1:58:42.940]  And then they're going to just like they did in, I think the twenties or thirties. Stay there. Stay there.
[1:58:42.940 --> 1:58:49.940]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCN live dot com today.
[1:58:49.940 --> 1:58:54.940]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:58:54.940 --> 1:58:59.940]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[1:58:59.940 --> 1:59:04.940]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:59:04.940 --> 1:59:10.940]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[1:59:10.940 --> 1:59:12.940]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:18.940]  The Acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[1:59:18.940 --> 1:59:25.940]  The Acola blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state of the art carbon filtration,
[1:59:25.940 --> 1:59:29.940]  reverse osmosis and ultra violent light sterilization techniques.
[1:59:29.940 --> 1:59:37.940]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe. Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[1:59:37.940 --> 1:59:49.940]  That's 1-800-691-6043 or visit Acola blue on the web at www.ecolovle.com today. That's Acola blue.com.
[2:00:07.940 --> 2:00:12.940]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:12.940 --> 2:00:26.940]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:26.940 --> 2:00:35.940]  Bob Chapman of theInternationalVorecaster.com is waiting in the wings
[2:00:35.940 --> 2:00:39.940]  to join us live in the next segment.
[2:00:39.940 --> 2:00:41.940]  We're going to break down what's happening in the economy.
[2:00:41.940 --> 2:00:46.940]  They've gone from discussing killing the dollar to now beginning the murder of the currency.
[2:00:46.940 --> 2:00:49.940]  It's being run by DC and London.
[2:00:49.940 --> 2:00:56.940]  That's coming up. We're going to continue with your phone calls throughout this hour with Annie, Chris, Mike, Norman and others.
[2:00:56.940 --> 2:01:02.940]  Paul in Oregon said that they sent, I guess, a vaccine waiver form home.
[2:01:02.940 --> 2:01:06.940]  They're trying to inoculate his children in the government training camp, the public school.
[2:01:06.940 --> 2:01:11.940]  And they're asking them to use a sanitizer that's not meant to be used on the skin.
[2:01:11.940 --> 2:01:15.940]  You're saying that's in the insert for this?
[2:01:15.940 --> 2:01:28.940]  I'm saying what it is, is my wife found something on the internet that said it had been created by the military for an industrial cleaner.
[2:01:28.940 --> 2:01:44.940]  And then I found an article on the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology website from 2000 where doctors got together and they're trying to, they have been called for a worldwide ban on this substance.
[2:01:44.940 --> 2:01:48.940]  So it's a toxic, what's the name of this again? It sounds horrid.
[2:01:48.940 --> 2:01:54.940]  It's called Benzalconium chloride. Benzalconium chloride.
[2:01:54.940 --> 2:02:10.940]  Man, that is serious. Do me a favor, send the links or write a two paragraph blurb making those points with the links to that medical journal and we'll get that up because if that's happening in your area of Oregon, where are you in Oregon?
[2:02:10.940 --> 2:02:12.940]  Gresham.
[2:02:12.940 --> 2:02:16.940]  Tell us the town. I mean, you don't have to say your name or the school, but what's the town?
[2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:26.940]  It's in Gresham, Oregon. It's in the Gresham Bible School District. The school is Hogan-Cedars and I'm sure the other schools in the district are going to do the same thing.
[2:02:26.940 --> 2:02:28.940]  Unbelievable. Look, it's all-
[2:02:28.940 --> 2:02:38.940]  Also, I wanted to make the point that they've been, even though we signed a form saying we did not want our children getting fluoride, they've been giving our children fluoride anyway.
[2:02:38.940 --> 2:02:41.940]  What, the fluoride tablets or?
[2:02:41.940 --> 2:02:43.940]  Yeah, the tablets, yeah.
[2:02:43.940 --> 2:02:46.940]  Have you told your children not to take it?
[2:02:46.940 --> 2:02:52.940]  I'm not the kind that sits on your teeth, but the kind you ingest.
[2:02:52.940 --> 2:03:08.940]  The school's giving them fluoride. Well, you go into the stores and it's fluoride water for kids and it doesn't matter how many toxicologists, how many scientists, how many doctors I have on, the studies show it has a doubly bad effect on average on children than it does on adults.
[2:03:08.940 --> 2:03:16.940]  It is so toxic. We've got Natura, the Austin water treatment, and they admit hundreds of chemicals are put in the water under the name of fluoride.
[2:03:16.940 --> 2:03:24.940]  The chemicals they ship in come from fertilizer manufacturing plants. It's the toxic waste byproduct, and they just dump it in the water.
[2:03:24.940 --> 2:03:34.940]  Now, on your issue of gold confiscation, they can steal your house. They can steal your children, but you don't not have children because the government might steal them.
[2:03:34.940 --> 2:03:39.940]  You fight the tyranny. But yes, they did have gold confiscation in 1933.
[2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:45.940]  My grandmother remembers in Dallas when the orders went out for people to turn in their gold currency for paper.
[2:03:45.940 --> 2:03:50.940]  Then the government literally shipped it all to Europe, a massive gold finger level heist.
[2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:56.940]  And yes, the government could announce again, turn your gold and we're going to give you paper for it.
[2:03:56.940 --> 2:04:02.940]  But most people just ignored that. I mean, they're just going to devalue the currency you have in the bank even worse.
[2:04:02.940 --> 2:04:06.940]  So that's the whole point. That's not a reason not to buy gold. That's the reason you want it.
[2:04:06.940 --> 2:04:13.940]  That's because at least you're holding on to it. They can erase the money in your bank account or seize it. It's all made up fiat.
[2:04:13.940 --> 2:04:18.940]  Gold's exploding in value. I don't think they're going to get away with it this time.
[2:04:18.940 --> 2:04:21.940]  But we'll ask Bob Chapman about that, okay?
[2:04:21.940 --> 2:04:22.940]  Okay.
[2:04:22.940 --> 2:04:25.940]  What's my email? I need to send this to you again. I'm sorry.
[2:04:25.940 --> 2:04:30.940]  I'm going to put you on hold, and we're going to send it to you right now.
[2:04:30.940 --> 2:04:36.940]  We're going to come back with Bob Chapman, get into the economy, and a bunch of other police state news with Bob as well.
[2:04:36.940 --> 2:04:42.940]  And we're going to be taking your phone calls, as I said, at 1-800-259-9231.
[2:04:42.940 --> 2:04:51.940]  And at the bottom of the hour, we're going to premiere the fifth and final trailer, the police state trailer from the police state section of fall of the republic.
[2:04:51.940 --> 2:04:59.940]  All the republic comes to the info war next Wednesday, October 21st. Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:04:59.940 --> 2:05:03.940]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:05:03.940 --> 2:05:06.940]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:05:06.940 --> 2:05:11.940]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:05:11.940 --> 2:05:16.940]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:05:16.940 --> 2:05:22.940]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[2:05:22.940 --> 2:05:25.940]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:05:25.940 --> 2:05:30.940]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:05:30.940 --> 2:05:37.940]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:05:37.940 --> 2:05:39.940]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:05:39.940 --> 2:05:47.940]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:05:47.940 --> 2:05:59.940]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[2:06:17.940 --> 2:06:23.940]  What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[2:06:23.940 --> 2:06:27.940]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class. It doesn't matter.
[2:06:27.940 --> 2:06:33.940]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy, and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[2:06:33.940 --> 2:06:37.940]  You know the government isn't looking out for you. You need to look out for yourself.
[2:06:37.940 --> 2:06:39.940]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:06:39.940 --> 2:06:44.940]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[2:06:44.940 --> 2:06:50.940]  Here's what you do.net and start today. Again, it is. Here's what you do.net.
[2:06:50.940 --> 2:06:55.940]  That's Here's What You Do.net. One last time. It's Here's What You Do.net.
[2:07:00.940 --> 2:07:03.940]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:07:03.940 --> 2:07:08.940]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:07:08.940 --> 2:07:15.940]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[2:07:15.940 --> 2:07:20.940]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:07:20.940 --> 2:07:25.940]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:25.940 --> 2:07:31.940]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:07:31.940 --> 2:07:34.940]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:34.940 --> 2:07:40.940]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[2:07:40.940 --> 2:07:43.940]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:07:43.940 --> 2:07:54.940]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:07:54.940 --> 2:07:58.940]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:07:58.940 --> 2:08:08.940]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:19.940 --> 2:08:26.940]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We are live on this Friday, the 16th day of October 2009 edition.
[2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:31.940]  We're now eight and a half minutes into the third hour of another hour coming up.
[2:08:31.940 --> 2:08:37.940]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., simple time. That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[2:08:37.940 --> 2:08:43.940]  And we are joined by Bob Chapman, the founder of the International Forecaster.
[2:08:43.940 --> 2:08:48.940]  He worked in Army Intelligence. He then had one of the biggest newsletters in history until he retired.
[2:08:48.940 --> 2:08:52.940]  He came back out of retirement to restart his financial newsletter.
[2:08:52.940 --> 2:08:56.940]  And his predictions are some of the most accurate and stunning out there.
[2:08:56.940 --> 2:08:59.940]  He was one of the biggest private gold and silver brokers ever.
[2:08:59.940 --> 2:09:04.940]  He helped publish Gary Allen's Dundare Call of Conspiracy in the early 1970s.
[2:09:04.940 --> 2:09:09.940]  He is a real icon in the fight against the globalist for the last 45 years.
[2:09:09.940 --> 2:09:16.940]  And today is his 74th or is it 75th birthday? How old are you today, Bob?
[2:09:16.940 --> 2:09:21.940]  I'm 74 and I'm happy to report that I'm healthy and everything works.
[2:09:21.940 --> 2:09:28.940]  That's awesome. Look, I don't want to toot your horn here, but I want people to pay attention to what you're saying.
[2:09:28.940 --> 2:09:36.940]  Everything you've talked about years before and you call it when it's going to happen is now happening.
[2:09:36.940 --> 2:09:44.940]  You called two years ago on this show that late 2009, 2010 early was when they start really killing the dollar.
[2:09:44.940 --> 2:09:47.940]  You called the stock market going back up.
[2:09:47.940 --> 2:09:53.940]  Two years ago, you said it would go down in a year, then it would go back up in 2009 that would then go down again.
[2:09:53.940 --> 2:09:58.940]  You called that gold by the fall would run up well above a thousand.
[2:09:58.940 --> 2:10:04.940]  I mean, I want the crystal ball you've got, but but but but also on top of all this, Bob Chapman,
[2:10:04.940 --> 2:10:08.940]  I want listeners, not our mainline listeners, but the shows growing by leaps and bounds.
[2:10:08.940 --> 2:10:13.940]  All these new listeners and all these new AM and FM stations understand we're just going off the documents.
[2:10:13.940 --> 2:10:18.940]  The Club of Rome, the Bank of England, all these, the private Federal Reserve have said they're setting up a bank of the world.
[2:10:18.940 --> 2:10:22.940]  We'll pay carbon taxes to they are the ones killing the dollar.
[2:10:22.940 --> 2:10:24.940]  They are the ones that have stolen tens of trillions.
[2:10:24.940 --> 2:10:34.940]  They are the one setting up a police state to stop the American and British and other people from taking our government back and bringing these made off slash skillings slash.
[2:10:34.940 --> 2:10:44.940]  Can lay types to justice. So either these guys take over the world through their Ponzi scheme fraud. That's the new world order. It's tyranny set up their bank of the world,
[2:10:44.940 --> 2:10:49.940]  which they're now calling for banks, the private banks to have the regulatory power over all businesses.
[2:10:49.940 --> 2:10:52.940]  That's even on the Politano's Fox News show.
[2:10:52.940 --> 2:10:54.940]  I mean, this is really happening.
[2:10:54.940 --> 2:10:59.940]  I want people to realize the magnitude of we're not saying the new world order is coming now.
[2:10:59.940 --> 2:11:10.940]  We're, it's now here and it's going to get worse and worse and worse. So I want to lay out what their master plan is, who they are, what their economic warfare operation is,
[2:11:10.940 --> 2:11:14.940]  and what the death of the dollar is going to look like.
[2:11:14.940 --> 2:11:22.940]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury, former Wall Street Journal editor of the father, Reaganomics, he said he believes it's irreversible.
[2:11:22.940 --> 2:11:24.940]  He now agrees it's by design.
[2:11:24.940 --> 2:11:31.940]  Two years ago, he knew they were doing it but couldn't come to that realization. They're now openly, Soros is openly bragging.
[2:11:31.940 --> 2:11:36.940]  I mean, this is so incredible and I want people to realize we are now here.
[2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:43.940]  The hell is now going to begin while they're simultaneously telling us we have a jobless recovery and everything's wonderful.
[2:11:43.940 --> 2:11:44.940]  Bob Chapman.
[2:11:44.940 --> 2:11:54.940]  Everything is not wonderful and we're not going to get a job, a recovery and it's as simple as that. If you remember back in January,
[2:11:54.940 --> 2:12:05.940]  I said that I thought that by the end of the year, the people in Washington and Wall Street would be talking about another stimulus plan and now they are.
[2:12:05.940 --> 2:12:14.940]  They're talking in terms of $200 billion. I projected $2 trillion and that's what they need to make this thing continue to hum.
[2:12:14.940 --> 2:12:22.940]  And so let's see what they come up with, but I think there's a good chance there's going to be another stimulus program.
[2:12:22.940 --> 2:12:30.940]  It'll be larger than the one that they did, which is $787 billion, we'll say $800 billion.
[2:12:30.940 --> 2:12:38.940]  It just really hasn't done hardly anything. Two reasons. They're not really creating anything. They're just throwing money at the problem.
[2:12:38.940 --> 2:12:54.940]  And number two, the layout of the plan was done extremely poorly. It was done politically and now they're very afraid that the stimulus plan is not going to carry the economy in a positive mode into the election
[2:12:54.940 --> 2:12:56.940]  and they're scrambling to get more money.
[2:12:56.940 --> 2:13:09.940]  The key to all of this is money. The key is the control of the production of money and that's done by the Federal Reserve, the private corporation, and it's also done by the Bank of England.
[2:13:09.940 --> 2:13:15.940]  And yes, as Alec said, they are now expediting into a world currency.
[2:13:15.940 --> 2:13:33.940]  Whether it'll be an SDR, special depository receipt, which is issued by the IMF, or whether it'll be a basket of currencies, say the G20, with a small goal backing of 10% to 15%, we don't know yet.
[2:13:33.940 --> 2:13:44.940]  But that's where they're headed so that they can have an international trading unit and they intend to follow that by having an international one-world currency.
[2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:52.940]  Now, Bob, for new listeners that don't understand, they're not going to see some gold or purple or blue money day one.
[2:13:52.940 --> 2:14:01.940]  We'll still have our regional currencies, euro, dollar, dollarized Canada and Mexico, but they've announced the G20.
[2:14:01.940 --> 2:14:10.940]  The new Bank of the World will set currency values, which will allow the insiders to even engage in bigger Ponzi schemes and manipulations.
[2:14:10.940 --> 2:14:19.940]  They will set interest rates globally, and that's why instead of G20 meeting once a year, they're meeting every two, three months now in private.
[2:14:19.940 --> 2:14:38.940]  And they're saying in the publications, mainline publications, Financial Times and others, that it's going to be a basket of SDR, bank-to-bank fiat currency, that it's going to be a basket of the YIN and the YON and the Indian money and the European Union money, the euro.
[2:14:38.940 --> 2:14:42.940]  But the media is also spending it saying the Arabs are killing the dollar.
[2:14:42.940 --> 2:14:51.940]  Is it not the policies of the private Federal Reserve pumping tens of trillions of these out into the economy that is killing the dollar?
[2:14:51.940 --> 2:14:55.940]  Well, it's the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are the two keys.
[2:14:55.940 --> 2:15:01.940]  But I look at this from a psychopolitical aspect.
[2:15:01.940 --> 2:15:05.940]  They are going to go into inflation, higher inflation.
[2:15:05.940 --> 2:15:11.940]  Real inflation right now is 6.11 percent.
[2:15:11.940 --> 2:15:15.940]  And those are John Williams' figures, incidentally.
[2:15:15.940 --> 2:15:18.940]  You can look at it at 6.01 as well.
[2:15:18.940 --> 2:15:23.940]  There's two ways of getting to the conclusion of the product.
[2:15:23.940 --> 2:15:26.940]  And so that's going to increase.
[2:15:26.940 --> 2:15:34.940]  We'll probably see over the next year and a half while they're preparing this international trading unit, they call.
[2:15:34.940 --> 2:15:49.940]  And this evolutionary process will continue to cause inflation until they decide to pull the plug and go to deflation and go to the international unit.
[2:15:49.940 --> 2:15:59.940]  And to see the dollar go to 40 on the USDX, today it's around 75-75.
[2:15:59.940 --> 2:16:05.940]  So you can see that we're not all that far away and it's come down from 124.
[2:16:05.940 --> 2:16:08.940]  And so what are we looking at?
[2:16:08.940 --> 2:16:21.940]  We're looking at probably another 40 percent to 50 percent change in the value of the dollar versus six major currencies.
[2:16:21.940 --> 2:16:23.940]  And that's their weighted against each other.
[2:16:23.940 --> 2:16:28.940]  And so this is where we're headed in the immediate future.
[2:16:28.940 --> 2:16:37.940]  Alex and I and Paul Craig Roberts were on together and we both said two to three years.
[2:16:37.940 --> 2:16:40.940]  Well, I think we're down to one and a half to two right now.
[2:16:40.940 --> 2:16:43.940]  And that's when I think they're going to stick it in.
[2:16:43.940 --> 2:16:45.940]  And so what does that put us?
[2:16:45.940 --> 2:16:50.940]  Mid-2011 to the end of 2011, somewhere in there.
[2:16:50.940 --> 2:16:52.940]  Let me break this down for Pete.
[2:16:52.940 --> 2:16:56.940]  Let me throw a question in here.
[2:16:56.940 --> 2:17:09.940]  The method to the madness, having big Bilderberg group, big New World Order owned Reuters Financial Times of London Wall Street Journal come out and take the shock off.
[2:17:09.940 --> 2:17:15.940]  So there isn't a big panic and start announcing we've got to devalue the dollar.
[2:17:15.940 --> 2:17:18.940]  It's going to happen incrementally.
[2:17:18.940 --> 2:17:32.940]  National Post reported New York Post reported yesterday that, you know, the dollar is no longer the World Reserve currency saying that China, India, Russia, Europe and other still have the majority dollars.
[2:17:32.940 --> 2:17:37.940]  But now the majority of their new purchases are euros and another basket.
[2:17:37.940 --> 2:17:40.940]  And so it seems they're just acclimating everyone.
[2:17:40.940 --> 2:17:48.940]  So Americans just accept the devaluation of the currency, rising prices while we have depression in the real economy.
[2:17:48.940 --> 2:17:58.940]  So losing your job, lower wages while the economy falls apart.
[2:17:58.940 --> 2:18:03.940]  So that's worse than the Great Depression, where it was a depression in prices and a depression in wages.
[2:18:03.940 --> 2:18:11.940]  We're talking about hyper-stag inflation here. And so I guess, why are they now announcing, okay, we are getting rid of the dollar?
[2:18:11.940 --> 2:18:13.940]  Is that just to get everybody ready?
[2:18:13.940 --> 2:18:14.940]  Yes, it is.
[2:18:14.940 --> 2:18:31.940]  And I think the piece that was done by Fisk this past week, which dealt with secret meetings among those who didn't want the dollar anymore, such as Russia, China, India, the Arab states, Brazil, Venezuela, Iran.
[2:18:31.940 --> 2:18:36.940]  That was deliberately leaked by him, that he was told to do that.
[2:18:36.940 --> 2:18:41.940]  And that was conditioning. They're going to ease it down.
[2:18:41.940 --> 2:18:45.940]  It's going down. They'll do the dialectics with it.
[2:18:45.940 --> 2:18:50.940]  You know, one step forward, two steps back, three steps forward, one step back.
[2:18:50.940 --> 2:18:53.940]  And that's the way they're going to take it down.
[2:18:53.940 --> 2:19:01.940]  And it'll encompass probably about a year and a half before it hits bottom, whether it's at 40 or 55 on the USDX.
[2:19:01.940 --> 2:19:06.940]  And in the meantime, the gold and silver are just going to go bonkers.
[2:19:06.940 --> 2:19:17.940]  Gold and silver have already, well, gold has already broken out, and we're headed probably the first major stop will be around $1,650 to $1,700.
[2:19:17.940 --> 2:19:23.940]  And then it'll go higher after that. And I don't expect any confiscation.
[2:19:23.940 --> 2:19:27.940]  Listen, 3% of Americans own gold. They wouldn't waste their time.
[2:19:27.940 --> 2:19:33.940]  They can go over and take over the GLD, which is the exchange-traded fund.
[2:19:33.940 --> 2:19:40.940]  They supposedly have 1,058 tons of gold, and there's some other entities that can be grabbed as well.
[2:19:40.940 --> 2:19:44.940]  And they can have all the gold that they want doing that.
[2:19:44.940 --> 2:19:51.940]  Yeah, back in 1933, money was gold and silver. The government says, we're going to give you this paper. Give us that.
[2:19:51.940 --> 2:19:55.940]  Then they doubled the price of gold a year later once the people didn't have it.
[2:19:55.940 --> 2:20:00.940]  Of course, my great-grandpa didn't turn his end. We'll be right back. Bob Chapman's our guest.

[2:24:19.940 --> 2:24:25.940]  On every issue, because we know the globalist agenda, it's all written down.
[2:24:25.940 --> 2:24:30.940]  We're like reading a TV guide and telling you what's on television tonight and you're saying, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[2:24:30.940 --> 2:24:34.940]  We have the government textbooks, we have the government documents, we have their own admissions,
[2:24:34.940 --> 2:24:39.940]  private corporate banks are robbing everyone right now, they're destroying our future
[2:24:39.940 --> 2:24:42.940]  and they're setting up a police state to make sure we can't resist them.
[2:24:42.940 --> 2:24:48.940]  It's illegitimate, it's criminal, we've got to come to realization, stop debating left and right Republican Democrat,
[2:24:48.940 --> 2:24:54.940]  stop debating balloon hoaxes and the latest O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson crap.
[2:24:54.940 --> 2:25:02.940]  We've got to stop caring so much about Brett Favre and start caring about the real issues, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:25:02.940 --> 2:25:05.940]  I mean, take Jesse Ventura, he likes Brett Favre too.
[2:25:05.940 --> 2:25:10.940]  We talked a little bit about football while I was out there shooting his TV show with him this week on Wednesday,
[2:25:10.940 --> 2:25:13.940]  but he still cares about the other issues of liberty and freedom.
[2:25:13.940 --> 2:25:23.940]  I'm not telling people to not spend some of their time in leisure and fun and watching the Yankees or the Dodgers,
[2:25:23.940 --> 2:25:30.940]  but Charlie Sheen, I'm good friends with Charlie Sheen, he still watches football and baseball,
[2:25:30.940 --> 2:25:33.940]  but he also spends some time dealing with issues of liberty and freedom.
[2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:40.940]  Ron Paul likes baseball, but he still spends some time fighting tyranny and we have total criminals taking over.
[2:25:40.940 --> 2:25:45.940]  I made the decision to basically have almost no leisure unless it's with my children playing with them.
[2:25:45.940 --> 2:25:49.940]  I play football in the backyard of my kids, but that's about it because they need that.
[2:25:49.940 --> 2:25:51.940]  We've got to get our priority straight.
[2:25:51.940 --> 2:25:54.940]  Bob, this is a short segment, but long segment coming up.
[2:25:54.940 --> 2:25:58.940]  I want to explain to people this illusion and I want you to get into it with them,
[2:25:58.940 --> 2:26:03.940]  but also what dollar collapse is going to look like, how this is going to affect the average person.
[2:26:03.940 --> 2:26:12.940]  Also, the record bonuses for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, AIG and others, the ones that change the laws with the revolving door of politicians and regulators
[2:26:12.940 --> 2:26:20.940]  that are now further raping us with our tax money for bonuses who are now going to set up the new bank of the world that they, the criminals, are going to control.
[2:26:20.940 --> 2:26:26.940]  But Bob, Chapman of theInternationalForecaster.com, people want to check out more.
[2:26:26.940 --> 2:26:29.940]  Gold isn't going up in price.
[2:26:29.940 --> 2:26:33.940]  The dollar is dropping in value and people know it's going.
[2:26:33.940 --> 2:26:37.940]  So they're rushing into the safe haven of something that's a real commodity and has true value.
[2:26:37.940 --> 2:26:40.940]  How does that ratio work with the stock market?
[2:26:40.940 --> 2:26:46.940]  I know it's not as pure dollar goes down, gold goes up as it is with gold with the stock market.
[2:26:46.940 --> 2:26:55.940]  But if the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are dollar denominated, is there not a ratio with the economy's plunging, the dollar's plunging,
[2:26:55.940 --> 2:27:04.940]  the industries are shutting down, but the stock market goes up, is there not a ratio there with people also flooding into stocks instead of dollars?
[2:27:04.940 --> 2:27:17.940]  Well, the more that you've seen in the Dow Jones from the low of 6,600 to 10,000 has been propelled by two basic reasons, short covering in a big way.
[2:27:17.940 --> 2:27:20.940]  People who bet the market was going to go down and were wrong.
[2:27:20.940 --> 2:27:28.940]  And secondly, the enormous amount of money that was put into the hands of banking and brokerage firms and insurance companies.
[2:27:28.940 --> 2:27:30.940]  I mean, we're talking trillions of dollars.
[2:27:30.940 --> 2:27:31.940]  What do they do with it?
[2:27:31.940 --> 2:27:34.940]  Well, the Fed said, look, get in the market, run the thing up.
[2:27:34.940 --> 2:27:37.940]  We have to have some stability in here.
[2:27:37.940 --> 2:27:49.940]  We have to convince the public that we're capable of making the market become 10,000 again and making those pension and profit sharing plans go from minus 50% back to even again.
[2:27:49.940 --> 2:27:51.940]  And so that's what they've done.
[2:27:51.940 --> 2:27:57.940]  But the flip side of that is inflation starting to heat up big time.
[2:27:57.940 --> 2:27:59.940]  Look at the PPI since May.
[2:27:59.940 --> 2:28:01.940]  All you had to do was watch that.
[2:28:01.940 --> 2:28:04.940]  You know that costs are going to go up.
[2:28:04.940 --> 2:28:13.940]  Now, either the producers of goods and services are going to eat the additional cost, or they're going to pass it on.
[2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:15.940]  Well, most of them are going to pass it on.
[2:28:15.940 --> 2:28:26.940]  And also, to answer your question about the falling of the dollar, how is it going to affect Americans, everything they buy from a foreign country is going to get more expensive.
[2:28:26.940 --> 2:28:35.940]  So that t-shirt that came from China, and you bought it at retail for a dollar, might cost a dollar 35 or a dollar 50.
[2:28:35.940 --> 2:28:39.940]  And so that's one of the main ways that it's going to hit.
[2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:41.940]  It's going to be very inflationary.
[2:28:41.940 --> 2:28:44.940]  And that will go on for a time.
[2:28:44.940 --> 2:28:46.940]  So how high will inflation go?
[2:28:46.940 --> 2:28:49.940]  A minimum of 14 to 15%.
[2:28:49.940 --> 2:28:51.940]  Perhaps a lot, lot more.
[2:28:51.940 --> 2:28:54.940]  We don't know what they've got in store for us yet.
[2:28:54.940 --> 2:28:56.940]  Well, Bob, what's the real number?
[2:28:56.940 --> 2:29:00.940]  I mean, unemployment, every other private group says 20% or more.
[2:29:00.940 --> 2:29:02.940]  The government says 9.5%.
[2:29:02.940 --> 2:29:04.940]  What's the real number there?
[2:29:04.940 --> 2:29:13.940]  Well, the only people I know that figure out what the dollar, the increase in money and credit is, is John Williams and myself.
[2:29:13.940 --> 2:29:15.940]  And he's got 21.4%.
[2:29:15.940 --> 2:29:17.940]  And I got 21.3%.
[2:29:17.940 --> 2:29:24.940]  So I'll bow to his professional expertise because he's better at it than I am.
[2:29:24.940 --> 2:29:26.940]  And so, yes, that's what we've got.
[2:29:26.940 --> 2:29:35.940]  So anything that some politician or businessman says that the unemployment's more than 20%, that's true.
[2:29:35.940 --> 2:29:39.940]  So unemployment's more like 20.
[2:29:39.940 --> 2:29:41.940]  Inflations.
[2:29:41.940 --> 2:29:43.940]  Where's inflation at there?
[2:29:43.940 --> 2:29:50.940]  Well, inflation is 6.11% using a formula before Bill Clinton went to office in the 1980s.
[2:29:50.940 --> 2:29:51.940]  Ah, stay there.
[2:29:51.940 --> 2:29:54.940]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.940 --> 2:30:00.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.940 --> 2:30:04.940]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:30:04.940 --> 2:30:06.940]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:30:06.940 --> 2:30:10.940]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[2:30:10.940 --> 2:30:14.940]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:30:14.940 --> 2:30:20.940]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[2:30:20.940 --> 2:30:22.940]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[2:30:22.940 --> 2:30:28.940]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[2:30:28.940 --> 2:30:33.940]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[2:30:33.940 --> 2:30:39.940]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[2:30:39.940 --> 2:30:42.940]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe.

[2:31:58.940 --> 2:32:05.940]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[2:32:05.940 --> 2:32:09.940]  I'm not. Don't trust it. But then I don't want to get the disease either.
[2:32:09.940 --> 2:32:15.940]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[2:32:15.940 --> 2:32:22.940]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant. There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[2:32:22.940 --> 2:32:25.940]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[2:32:25.940 --> 2:32:31.940]  You can find out all about it and order it online at nogerms.info.
[2:32:31.940 --> 2:32:33.940]  That's nogerms.info.
[2:32:33.940 --> 2:32:38.940]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well.
[2:32:38.940 --> 2:32:43.940]  When they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid, don't pick your nose.
[2:32:43.940 --> 2:32:48.940]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[2:32:48.940 --> 2:32:53.940]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[2:32:53.940 --> 2:32:57.940]  Go to nogerms.info. That's nogerms.info.
[2:32:57.940 --> 2:33:23.940]  Be well and stay well. Best MZ.
[2:33:27.940 --> 2:33:45.940]  I have a family. My parents live here. I have three children.
[2:33:45.940 --> 2:33:56.940]  I love this country. I had two relations on my mother's side of the family that came over on the Mayflower.
[2:33:56.940 --> 2:34:02.940]  My family was all over the Revolutionary War in 1776 and in the founding of Texas.
[2:34:02.940 --> 2:34:07.940]  I mean, I really bleed red, white, and blue. I know we've been the greatest country in history.
[2:34:07.940 --> 2:34:14.940]  I know we're special. Our Bill of Rights and Constitution is wonderful.
[2:34:14.940 --> 2:34:21.940]  And I'm so sick of watching offshore banks with slick PR firms who know how to lie to the public,
[2:34:21.940 --> 2:34:26.940]  gutting the country, openly announcing at Davos they're setting up a world government.
[2:34:26.940 --> 2:34:30.940]  George Soros and all these guys laughing saying, I'm having a great crisis.
[2:34:30.940 --> 2:34:33.940]  We're finally going to bring down the U.S. and set up world government.
[2:34:33.940 --> 2:34:38.940]  The Pentagon totally works for them.
[2:34:38.940 --> 2:34:45.940]  They're openly setting up a police state to rob all of us.
[2:34:45.940 --> 2:34:50.940]  And I've still got to argue with people about whether I'm a conspiracy theorist or not.
[2:34:50.940 --> 2:34:54.940]  I mean, Bob Chapman, does it ever make your head spin to have the thousands of government documents,
[2:34:54.940 --> 2:34:57.940]  statements, reports that we cover, that we link to?
[2:34:57.940 --> 2:35:00.940]  More news today about deaths from the swine flu vaccine.
[2:35:00.940 --> 2:35:06.940]  People getting paralyzed. Medical doctors say, yes, it's causing neurological problems.
[2:35:06.940 --> 2:35:08.940]  They had to stop it in 76.
[2:35:08.940 --> 2:35:11.940]  For a year, they denied deaths were happening in 76.
[2:35:11.940 --> 2:35:15.940]  And people finally said, hell no, and they admitted it.
[2:35:15.940 --> 2:35:18.940]  I mean, how many times do we have to be lied to?
[2:35:18.940 --> 2:35:20.940]  How many times do we have to be right?
[2:35:20.940 --> 2:35:22.940]  And again, I'm not trying to toot our horn here today,
[2:35:22.940 --> 2:35:25.940]  but I want to make a big deal out of this because it is a big deal.
[2:35:25.940 --> 2:35:28.940]  We have the track record. We have been right.
[2:35:28.940 --> 2:35:30.940]  We do our homework. We bust our ass.
[2:35:30.940 --> 2:35:35.940]  I mean, Bob, I remember you however many years ago it was, you can remind me.
[2:35:35.940 --> 2:35:37.940]  I'm reading your forecaster having you on.
[2:35:37.940 --> 2:35:39.940]  I've been interviewing you for like eight years.
[2:35:39.940 --> 2:35:46.940]  I remember you when the stock market hit 14,000 saying, get out now.
[2:35:46.940 --> 2:35:48.940]  And you can remind me of the date in a moment.
[2:35:48.940 --> 2:35:52.940]  And then when the stock market went way down last year,
[2:35:52.940 --> 2:35:56.940]  you said it's going to run back up in the summer and fall.
[2:35:56.940 --> 2:35:58.940]  And then I forget what you said was going to plunge down again.
[2:35:58.940 --> 2:36:00.940]  Let's hear your forecast now.
[2:36:00.940 --> 2:36:04.940]  And I remember you calling all these things accurately.
[2:36:04.940 --> 2:36:07.940]  And you've pointed out because you're not an egomaniac
[2:36:07.940 --> 2:36:10.940]  and either other economists we have on.
[2:36:10.940 --> 2:36:14.940]  You've pointed out that Bob Chapman is about 95% accurate
[2:36:14.940 --> 2:36:18.940]  and that the mainstream media is over 80% inaccurate on the financial shows.
[2:36:18.940 --> 2:36:21.940]  They're not inaccurate because they're stupid.
[2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:23.940]  They're just as smart as Bob Chapman.
[2:36:23.940 --> 2:36:25.940]  In fact, in their own personal lives,
[2:36:25.940 --> 2:36:28.940]  it's come out that their portfolios are the opposite of what they're saying.
[2:36:28.940 --> 2:36:34.940]  In many cases, what they tell their viewers, Kramer and others,
[2:36:34.940 --> 2:36:37.940]  that they know what they're doing.
[2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:39.940]  They know they're lying. They know they're spinning.
[2:36:39.940 --> 2:36:42.940]  They know they're just manipulating.
[2:36:42.940 --> 2:36:48.940]  So you're just telling the truth because that's what you do.
[2:36:48.940 --> 2:36:52.940]  That's your business model. That's your political model.
[2:36:52.940 --> 2:36:54.940]  They work for the system, so they lie.
[2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:57.940]  I mean, this, explain to people your predictions and they're all in the newsletters.
[2:36:57.940 --> 2:37:00.940]  Go over all the things you called and then where we are right now
[2:37:00.940 --> 2:37:03.940]  and where you see us going.
[2:37:03.940 --> 2:37:11.940]  Well, I can go back to, I called the top of the real estate market in October of 1989.
[2:37:11.940 --> 2:37:15.940]  And I sold my house in Malibu that month, as a matter of fact.
[2:37:15.940 --> 2:37:19.940]  And I said, you know, it's over and they're going to get out considerably.
[2:37:19.940 --> 2:37:21.940]  Well, that happened.
[2:37:21.940 --> 2:37:27.940]  And the Alitas had an opportunity between 1990 and 92
[2:37:27.940 --> 2:37:33.940]  to straighten the entire economy out by having a strong recession.
[2:37:33.940 --> 2:37:35.940]  They refused to do that.
[2:37:35.940 --> 2:37:43.940]  And at the same time, it was in a terrible fix and that went on for 20 years.
[2:37:43.940 --> 2:37:47.940]  And we called the top of the market there at 42,000.
[2:37:47.940 --> 2:37:54.940]  It eventually went down to about 5,000 and now it's trading a little bit higher.
[2:37:54.940 --> 2:38:00.940]  But that was some of the things in the old days that, if you want to call them, that I called.
[2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:08.940]  We even called the rally in gold in 1984-5 and then again in 1986.
[2:38:08.940 --> 2:38:15.940]  I think one of the best things I ever called was the increase in interest rates in 1992,
[2:38:15.940 --> 2:38:24.940]  where we said the 30-year would go to 8-1-16 and we hit it right on the head.
[2:38:24.940 --> 2:38:28.940]  Then, of course, the dot-com boom came during the late 90s.
[2:38:28.940 --> 2:38:32.940]  And I just stood aside and said, I'm not going to go into that madness.
[2:38:32.940 --> 2:38:41.940]  And in April, the second week of 2000, we called the top on the stock market.
[2:38:41.940 --> 2:38:47.940]  And then in June, we went in big time into the gold and silver shares and coins
[2:38:47.940 --> 2:38:50.940]  because we felt this was the beginning of another bull market.
[2:38:50.940 --> 2:38:53.940]  And the first phase was just completed.
[2:38:53.940 --> 2:39:00.940]  We went from 252 an ounce on gold to 1,070 intraday.
[2:39:00.940 --> 2:39:03.940]  And so we made that call.
[2:39:03.940 --> 2:39:11.940]  We called the 9-11 type of event in November before it happened within 33 days.
[2:39:11.940 --> 2:39:15.940]  We called Iraq and Iran the conflicts.
[2:39:15.940 --> 2:39:18.940]  We called the top of the stock market at 14,000.
[2:39:18.940 --> 2:39:22.940]  We said it would go to either 7,200 or 6,600.
[2:39:22.940 --> 2:39:24.940]  It went to 6,600.
[2:39:24.940 --> 2:39:26.940]  And we thought it would go back to 8,500.
[2:39:26.940 --> 2:39:27.940]  And it did.
[2:39:27.940 --> 2:39:29.940]  In fact, it went to 10,000.
[2:39:29.940 --> 2:39:34.940]  We didn't pick the top on that, but we were essentially and fundamentally correct.
[2:39:34.940 --> 2:39:37.940]  Now, I think we're looking at a return.
[2:39:37.940 --> 2:39:45.940]  I can't tell you the length of time right now, but we're looking at a return of the Dow downward.
[2:39:45.940 --> 2:39:48.940]  The timeframe, hard to say.
[2:39:48.940 --> 2:39:56.940]  But at the moment, it looks like we should see a correction down to 78 to 8,800 somewhere in that area.
[2:39:56.940 --> 2:40:00.940]  Gold and silver are going to keep right on going up.
[2:40:00.940 --> 2:40:05.940]  Silver will break out finally from its old high, probably by the end of the year.
[2:40:05.940 --> 2:40:08.940]  And gold, of course, is broken out.
[2:40:08.940 --> 2:40:11.940]  Probably next stop is 12,250.
[2:40:11.940 --> 2:40:12.940]  And then 16,50.
[2:40:12.940 --> 2:40:15.940]  And then 2,500 to 3,000.
[2:40:15.940 --> 2:40:22.940]  And that 2,500 only reflects official inflation since 1980.
[2:40:22.940 --> 2:40:26.940]  Real inflation would put gold at $6,700.
[2:40:26.940 --> 2:40:30.940]  And so these are the general predictions.
[2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:38.940]  Incidentally, real estate is going to continue to go down because of the types of loans that are still out there and the loss of jobs.
[2:40:38.940 --> 2:40:44.940]  The fact that for a year the government has been writing subprime loans again.
[2:40:44.940 --> 2:40:50.940]  And that won't possibly bottom out until 2013.
[2:40:50.940 --> 2:40:54.940]  And goodness knows how long it's going to bump along the bottom.
[2:40:54.940 --> 2:40:56.940]  And so that's what we're looking at.
[2:40:56.940 --> 2:41:02.940]  We're also looking at probably a sideways movement on unemployment for several months.
[2:41:02.940 --> 2:41:06.940]  And then it's going to get worse again unless they dump in and they'll need $2 trillion.
[2:41:06.940 --> 2:41:09.940]  And if they don't put in $2 trillion, it isn't going to work again.
[2:41:09.940 --> 2:41:13.940]  And so these are some of the things that I'm looking forward on.
[2:41:13.940 --> 2:41:17.940]  Okay, I want to take some calls before you leave us.
[2:41:17.940 --> 2:41:25.940]  We got Chris Pinto next hour getting into some information dealing with Dan Brown's book and they're saying it's inaccurate.
[2:41:25.940 --> 2:41:29.940]  They've made the definitive films on the real secret societies, the Illuminati.
[2:41:29.940 --> 2:41:32.940]  And now they operate whole separate area.
[2:41:32.940 --> 2:41:34.940]  We're going to be discussing coming up the next hour.
[2:41:34.940 --> 2:41:38.940]  But while we've got you, Bob, I'm shaken up by this.
[2:41:38.940 --> 2:41:43.940]  It's one thing to know they're going to kill the dollar and know it a decade ago and see their plans.
[2:41:43.940 --> 2:41:50.940]  It's another thing to now be here in that zone where they're getting ready to stage new wars, new terror attacks.
[2:41:50.940 --> 2:41:52.940]  They're setting up incredible police states.
[2:41:52.940 --> 2:42:04.940]  I've got mainstream news articles where high level media executives with no criminal record known for being pure gentlemen get up in first class
[2:42:04.940 --> 2:42:10.940]  and walk in front of someone who's asleep and the stewardess yells at them and then has them arrested under the Patriot Act
[2:42:10.940 --> 2:42:12.940]  and they're charged for making an ugly face.
[2:42:12.940 --> 2:42:15.940]  That's in the FBI affidavit.
[2:42:15.940 --> 2:42:23.940]  I see these articles every week now where people argue with the stewardess so they're going to prison under the Patriot Act.
[2:42:23.940 --> 2:42:25.940]  I see where they're charging marijuana dealers with it.
[2:42:25.940 --> 2:42:27.940]  I mean, people with a half ounce.
[2:42:27.940 --> 2:42:33.940]  I mean, they're arresting people selling eggs on street corners in the countryside.
[2:42:33.940 --> 2:42:35.940]  I mean, they're SWAT teaming Amish.
[2:42:35.940 --> 2:42:41.940]  I mean, it's entering a vortex of evil, $100,000 fines for garage sales.
[2:42:41.940 --> 2:42:48.940]  I mean, I can't even believe how insane they just came out and admitted what I knew 14 years ago,
[2:42:48.940 --> 2:42:58.940]  but now completely declassified that most TV is run by the Pentagon and the White House and then the entire scripts are funded and written.
[2:42:58.940 --> 2:43:06.940]  I mean, we already knew it watching TV, but to be anti-family, pro-death, all these shows where they're unplugging old people,
[2:43:06.940 --> 2:43:13.940]  the heroes are killing people on the shows, they're convincing old women not to have cancer surgery to save money for young people.
[2:43:13.940 --> 2:43:16.940]  I mean, as if the pie can't grow.
[2:43:16.940 --> 2:43:19.940]  I mean, global taxes are being announced.
[2:43:19.940 --> 2:43:23.940]  Schwarzenegger's saying you got a thumbprint to buy guns.
[2:43:23.940 --> 2:43:26.940]  He's now saying they're going to ban 40-inch TVs because they're bad for the environment.
[2:43:26.940 --> 2:43:28.940]  They use too much energy.
[2:43:28.940 --> 2:43:32.940]  I mean, all the carbon taxes, all the control, worse than the Soviet Union.
[2:43:32.940 --> 2:43:34.940]  When I say that, I mean, it is.
[2:43:34.940 --> 2:43:44.940]  I mean, Bob, it's off the charts, but before we do that, what will this look like as they incrementally, like you said, knock the dollar down,
[2:43:44.940 --> 2:43:50.940]  then bring it up a little bit, knock it down, bring it up a little bit, knock it down, bring it up a little bit because that's the graph.
[2:43:50.940 --> 2:44:00.940]  And as the world now shifts with new purchases to majority, euros, and yens, and yons, and other currencies,
[2:44:00.940 --> 2:44:02.940]  they've now left the dollar.
[2:44:02.940 --> 2:44:04.940]  That's the headlines in all the financial papers.
[2:44:04.940 --> 2:44:05.940]  So they've begun.
[2:44:05.940 --> 2:44:15.940]  It's like the Hal 9000 in 2001 Space Odyssey where he's going, I'm afraid, Dave, and the astronauts turning the computer's memory off.
[2:44:15.940 --> 2:44:21.940]  I mean, they're turning it off. He's gone down about 10 of the memory cubes.
[2:44:21.940 --> 2:44:23.940]  He's got about 50 left.
[2:44:23.940 --> 2:44:29.940]  The Hal 9000, which is America, is going daisy, daisy.
[2:44:29.940 --> 2:44:31.940]  I mean, this is happening.
[2:44:31.940 --> 2:44:33.940]  And there's no way to stop these criminal bankers.
[2:44:33.940 --> 2:44:35.940]  They're going to get their world government.
[2:44:35.940 --> 2:44:37.940]  They're going to rape everybody more.
[2:44:37.940 --> 2:44:39.940]  We're going to pay our taxes directly to them.
[2:44:39.940 --> 2:44:44.940]  And no matter how big their frauds are, the police just, yes, sir, salute them.
[2:44:44.940 --> 2:44:48.940]  I mean, Bob, this is getting bad.
[2:44:48.940 --> 2:44:56.940]  Well, I think Lauren Forsman had better wake up because if they keep on doing what they're doing, there is going to be a backlash.
[2:44:56.940 --> 2:44:58.940]  There's absolutely no question.
[2:44:58.940 --> 2:45:00.940]  Desperate people do desperate things.
[2:45:00.940 --> 2:45:02.940]  And we have desperate people in America.
[2:45:02.940 --> 2:45:05.940]  We have 30 million people or whatever it is unemployed.
[2:45:05.940 --> 2:45:11.940]  And I think the checks are going to stop very shortly in a big way.
[2:45:11.940 --> 2:45:15.940]  Checks are already bouncing from the state to people in California.
[2:45:15.940 --> 2:45:21.940]  And we've got some bizarre Hitler youth guy going, I take your guns.
[2:45:21.940 --> 2:45:23.940]  I ban TV.
[2:45:23.940 --> 2:45:25.940]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[2:45:25.940 --> 2:45:27.940]  Well, you're right about Donald Trump.
[2:45:27.940 --> 2:45:33.940]  And they're going to continue to do this.
[2:45:33.940 --> 2:45:35.940]  And finally, it'll snap.
[2:45:35.940 --> 2:45:37.940]  And then we see who's going to win.
[2:45:37.940 --> 2:45:41.940]  The Pentagon is not going to win because the military is not going to follow them.
[2:45:41.940 --> 2:45:55.940]  And I think we're going to have to join the military in helping them to combat the travesty of corruption and dictatorial government that's in Washington and Wall Street.
[2:45:55.940 --> 2:45:57.940]  And that's what we're going to have to deal with.
[2:45:57.940 --> 2:46:01.940]  These are the people who are dangerous, the crooks and the $3,000 suits.
[2:46:01.940 --> 2:46:05.940]  I mean, I got an article here that Paul Craig Roberts did yesterday.
[2:46:05.940 --> 2:46:07.940]  It's only two pages.
[2:46:07.940 --> 2:46:10.940]  The rich have stolen the economy and he's right.
[2:46:10.940 --> 2:46:13.940]  It's a fabulous, very short, but fabulous article.
[2:46:13.940 --> 2:46:21.940]  Well, Professor Black, Professor Black, who's one of the top regulators of SNL exposing all that.
[2:46:21.940 --> 2:46:24.940]  And Professor Black's top, top game.
[2:46:24.940 --> 2:46:30.940]  And he said, this is by an order of magnitude the greatest fraud, the greatest scam in world history.
[2:46:30.940 --> 2:46:33.940]  And they're just getting started.
[2:46:33.940 --> 2:46:35.940]  That's right. And they just keep...
[2:46:35.940 --> 2:46:42.940]  They don't even know what to do with the billions and billions of dollars that they're stealing from everybody.
[2:46:42.940 --> 2:46:56.940]  There's a new magazine coming up at the Financial Times where to put all of that great amount of money that you rich people are pulling in by doing what you're doing in Wall Street, et cetera.
[2:46:56.940 --> 2:47:07.940]  And we have fragmented into a society where the middle class has been reduced to 5 or 10 percent.
[2:47:07.940 --> 2:47:12.940]  You have a rich cadre at the top and everybody else is wallowing.
[2:47:12.940 --> 2:47:15.940]  But isn't that like it's the wintertime and you're cold?
[2:47:15.940 --> 2:47:20.940]  So instead of going and getting some firewood, you just light the drapes on fire and, you know, this is the elite.
[2:47:20.940 --> 2:47:32.940]  I'll get lots of warmth if I burn the house down. And, you know, they're just masses of troops in black uniforms marching, beating their batons on their breastplates when you try to go protest the G20.
[2:47:32.940 --> 2:47:41.940]  And then the elite are just burning the house down going, boy, it's warm, you know, roasting hot dogs in their own inhalation.
[2:47:41.940 --> 2:47:46.940]  Well, it's interesting. The Romans did the same thing. And that's where they got that from.
[2:47:46.940 --> 2:47:54.940]  Begging their spears up against their shields. And today they've got billy clubs to do that.
[2:47:54.940 --> 2:48:01.940]  And I see that they have all kinds of armor on. Well, let me tell you something.
[2:48:01.940 --> 2:48:05.940]  There's ways to take people down even if they get armor on.
[2:48:05.940 --> 2:48:20.940]  But where we're headed here is ultimately to violence and ultimately to revolution. And the elitists think that they're going to be able to control the situation.
[2:48:20.940 --> 2:48:27.940]  And I think, and I know you do, Alex, that they're not going to be able to. And we are going to win.
[2:48:27.940 --> 2:48:30.940]  It's just what kind of a price are we going to have to pay?
[2:48:30.940 --> 2:48:38.940]  And the price is being paid because in the last 50 years particularly, no one wanted to pay attention.
[2:48:38.940 --> 2:48:46.940]  Well, some people are starting and that's terrific. We are winning the battle on the airwaves, that's for sure, and even in print now.
[2:48:46.940 --> 2:48:53.940]  And we've discussed this in the program before. The people who are running things, they're in trouble.
[2:48:53.940 --> 2:49:04.940]  They had to expedite their program. I would have never thought we would have saw last week a planted article by FIS that we don't need the dollar anymore.
[2:49:04.940 --> 2:49:11.940]  And there's some nations plotting against it. Well, they should plot against it. The United States is bankrupt.
[2:49:11.940 --> 2:49:18.940]  Well, that's total spend. Dr. Roberts made the point yesterday. The Russians, the Chinese, the Arabs are saying, we're your biggest investors.
[2:49:18.940 --> 2:49:23.940]  Please stop devaluing it. It's lost 10 percent in the last year. We're losing money.
[2:49:23.940 --> 2:49:29.940]  And then the Federal Reserve is out there. They're the ones setting up the new bank of the world. They're the ones killing America.
[2:49:29.940 --> 2:49:32.940]  Then they blame it on the Arabs.
[2:49:32.940 --> 2:49:45.940]  That's right. And they're just recipients. They're selling things to us. In this case, oil and petrochemical products and the Chinese, all the kinds of products and so on and so forth.
[2:49:45.940 --> 2:49:48.940]  And we're robbing the world.
[2:49:48.940 --> 2:49:53.940]  Let me ask you this. We're going to come back and get into final comments from you on the economy.
[2:49:53.940 --> 2:49:59.940]  But would you be buying gold right now in silver? I mean, is that the investment or what are some other investments?
[2:49:59.940 --> 2:50:07.940]  You know, Alex, it is the only place to be. You can go to currencies, but they're going to all devalue against the dollar.
[2:50:07.940 --> 2:50:11.940]  And they have been for the last six years. So why bother to go there?
[2:50:11.940 --> 2:50:16.940]  You go to gold and silver coins if you want gold and silver shares.
[2:50:16.940 --> 2:50:23.940]  And that's the only place where you can protect your wealth.
[2:50:23.940 --> 2:50:34.940]  Absolutely. And to explain what you just said, Dr. Roberts, former head of the Treasury said this, former head of policy yesterday, that the implosion of the dollar is going to suck down other systems as well.
[2:50:34.940 --> 2:50:41.940]  But we're going to be the center, the center of the black hole here. You agree with that?
[2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:47.940]  62.8% of the foreign reserves of all countries are in dollars.
[2:50:47.940 --> 2:50:52.940]  And, incidentally, that just dropped from 64.5 at the beginning of the year.
[2:50:52.940 --> 2:50:55.940]  And they're now the majority of new currency they're buying is not dollars.
[2:50:55.940 --> 2:51:01.940]  We'll be right back. The shift has been made. They're putting the final nails in the dollar.
[2:51:01.940 --> 2:51:08.940]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[2:51:08.940 --> 2:51:13.940]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[2:51:13.940 --> 2:51:18.940]  Alcovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[2:51:18.940 --> 2:51:25.940]  Using plasma pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[2:51:25.940 --> 2:51:31.940]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[2:51:31.940 --> 2:51:36.940]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[2:51:36.940 --> 2:51:43.940]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[2:51:43.940 --> 2:51:49.940]  Order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alcovision.com.

[2:51:55.940 --> 2:52:20.940]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:52:20.940 --> 2:52:25.940]  It's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:52:25.940 --> 2:52:37.940]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:52:37.940 --> 2:52:41.940]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:52:41.940 --> 2:52:48.940]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.
[2:52:48.940 --> 2:53:00.940]  This is the copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or downloaded in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[2:53:00.940 --> 2:53:08.940]  You worry. You see the signs and worry about the future. You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages. How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[2:53:08.940 --> 2:53:13.940]  Your answer may be at hand. Author Linda Runyon lived off the land isolated from civilization.
[2:53:13.940 --> 2:53:22.940]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth. Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[2:53:22.940 --> 2:53:30.940]  The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere. It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[2:53:30.940 --> 2:53:39.940]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.
[2:53:39.940 --> 2:53:48.940]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it. Go to Linda's website ofthefield.com and take advantage of special offers.
[2:53:48.940 --> 2:54:10.940]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour toll-free order line at 888-51 Eat Free. That number again, 888-51 Eat Free. A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[2:54:18.940 --> 2:54:34.940]  Knock out the waiting wall. Ain't no sin. Got the feet of fortune. Deal me.
[2:54:34.940 --> 2:54:48.940]  Bob Chapman is our guest. I want to bring Ted Anderson on briefly and then hold Bob five more minutes over to talk about some more financial news.
[2:54:48.940 --> 2:55:04.940]  He bought gold at $950 and sold it to you when it was $1,000 and now that gold's up at $1,060 right now, he's running out of the gold he bought at the $1,000 level. That is, he bought this gold when the market was $1,000. He bought the silver he's almost out of it.
[2:55:04.940 --> 2:55:14.940]  I just bought a bag of it last week. The silver half dollars, those are almost gone. He bought a hoard of it when the silver was at the $12 level. So that's what's priced into the market.
[2:55:14.940 --> 2:55:22.940]  I got to tell him Alex Jones said she'd get this deal or it's the higher price. That's still a great deal. This is like having a time machine to go back.
[2:55:22.940 --> 2:55:30.940]  Ted, briefly give folks the coins you've got that are super discounted and then we're going to ask Bob straight up if he thinks that's a good deal. Ted Anderson.
[2:55:30.940 --> 2:55:44.940]  I can tell you what I have. I have Frank said 238. Got British sovereigns at 293. Lakota coins are it's $22.30 still. Walking Liberty is man, you're not going to find those anywhere else at this price.
[2:55:44.940 --> 2:55:55.940]  $8.69. You're right. The market is going up, man. I'm just depressed. I've been reading economic news and then I come on to get on the air with you and I hear Bob talking.
[2:55:55.940 --> 2:56:05.940]  I mean, I just, I was just reading an article that says that the dollar since tarp, the supply of money has increased two to one from what we had just a couple of years ago.
[2:56:05.940 --> 2:56:19.940]  The only thing that's stopping us from having complete out now blasted inflation is just the velocity. It's just crazy. Alex, it just makes me, you know, I mean, I've got kids that are going to be entering the job force here in just a couple of years.
[2:56:19.940 --> 2:56:24.940]  I don't have a grandchild and this is the kind of world we're leaving for them. It just drives me nuts.
[2:56:24.940 --> 2:56:33.940]  Exactly. I'm not happy that we've been proven completely right and that Bob six months ago said in the fall it would go above 1,050. That's what he said on air.
[2:56:33.940 --> 2:56:43.940]  I pulled up his newsletter earlier and I'm not pleased to be right, but at least it's a silver lining in this big rain cloud that at least the listeners can get a great deal.
[2:56:43.940 --> 2:56:48.940]  Bob, how good a deal is that that that Ted Anderson's offering?
[2:56:48.940 --> 2:57:03.940]  Well, it's a very good deal, but more important, just as important is the fact you get diversification there. You've got all of these different kinds of coins in a fifth of an ounce or a quarter of an ounce approximately, and then you've got the silver.
[2:57:03.940 --> 2:57:16.940]  Beautiful. Beautiful for barter. And so I like the smaller coins myself. Ted, are you able to get any of the fractional gold eagle and silver eagle theories?
[2:57:16.940 --> 2:57:23.940]  Now, you know, they're not even making them this year. It's real tough. I have some from that I that I picked up a while ago.
[2:57:23.940 --> 2:57:31.940]  Yeah, a lot of minutes have cut back in production while there's even more drive. Let me give people the number and the brokers will be there tonight. This deal is good till midnight tonight.
[2:57:31.940 --> 2:57:45.940]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237-modestresources.com. Again, 800-686-2237. People are insane if they don't take advantage of this deal.
[2:57:45.940 --> 2:57:53.940]  Well, I'll throw one more at them, Alex. If you buy one of those francs for me, I'll buy a full year subscription to the International Forecaster for you.
[2:57:53.940 --> 2:58:04.940]  If you haven't had a chance, I mean, I just got to, I mean, Bob, I'm reading your literature and it's like I'm scratching my head as to figure out why people would not move into gold and silver.
[2:58:04.940 --> 2:58:13.940]  I mean, it just, you know, if you take a look at the entire because it's more than tripled in value the last seven years, people don't like something that's almost quadrupling.
[2:58:13.940 --> 2:58:22.940]  They like losing money. 800-686-2237-800-686-2237. Call right now.
[2:58:22.940 --> 2:58:27.940]  Midas Resources, the parent company of the GCN Radio Network. It's where I've shopped around. It's where I buy my gold and silver.
[2:58:27.940 --> 2:58:34.940]  The deal Ted just gave you, I certify, is awesome. I think you should get involved. 800-686-2237.
[2:58:34.940 --> 2:58:39.940]  Thank you, Ted. We're going to come back with Bob Chapman at theinternationalforecaster.com.
[2:58:39.940 --> 2:58:50.940]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade. We are the GCN Radio Network.
[2:58:50.940 --> 2:58:57.940]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:58:57.940 --> 2:59:06.940]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois. These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:59:06.940 --> 2:59:12.940]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[2:59:12.940 --> 2:59:20.940]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:59:20.940 --> 2:59:27.940]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:59:27.940 --> 2:59:37.940]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:59:37.940 --> 2:59:50.940]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[2:59:50.940 --> 3:00:00.940]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:20.940 --> 3:00:33.940]  Bob, again, what will it look like as the dollar dies? Sure, stuff's going to cost more from overseas. We don't really have a lot of industry left.
[3:00:33.940 --> 3:00:42.940]  If we have a depression which we're going into here, we're not agrarian, we're not rural anymore, we're almost 90%, 89% urban.
[3:00:42.940 --> 3:00:53.940]  Most people in the country aren't self-sufficient. Globalization was meant to wreck everything to consolidate it, but are the globalists doing too good a job wrecking their own system?
[3:00:53.940 --> 3:01:04.940]  You might say that they are, but they expected that. They're probably going to lose probably two-thirds or more of their wealth.
[3:01:04.940 --> 3:01:12.940]  They're willing to accept that in order to execute their world government. They hold a lot of gold, incidentally.
[3:01:12.940 --> 3:01:26.940]  I think gold's going to come back into the picture monetarily. There's been talk of that in relation to this new international trading unit that's going to be formed over, I would say, the next year and a half.
[3:01:26.940 --> 3:01:39.940]  I think that what it's going to do for the American and the world public, although I think America and Europe are going to suffer, and England and England are going to suffer the most,
[3:01:39.940 --> 3:01:48.940]  because they have had the higher standard of living that other people haven't had.
[3:01:48.940 --> 3:02:05.940]  In all areas they do, to some extent, leverage their buying of property, whereas in the remainder of the world, most of the people pay cash for their property, especially residential property, and most Americans don't know that.
[3:02:05.940 --> 3:02:19.940]  I think that we're going to, over the next year and a half to two, maybe as long as three years, we're going to move up to unemployment between 35% and 50%.
[3:02:19.940 --> 3:02:28.940]  That's going to serve as a catalyst for very bad times. That's what's going to bring on violence.
[3:02:28.940 --> 3:02:37.940]  That's why I talk about law enforcement. You better be on the right side, because if you shoot in American citizens, you're going to die, guaranteed.
[3:02:37.940 --> 3:02:40.940]  There's no way you can win, not with 450 million weapons.
[3:02:40.940 --> 3:02:47.940]  Well, that's the thing is the American people have been cowed, but once violence starts, there's nobody more vicious in history.
[3:02:47.940 --> 3:02:52.940]  Foreign historians have written about this, and that old instincts there, it's just going to be rampaging.
[3:02:52.940 --> 3:03:02.940]  I'm not happy about that. I'm upset because the globalists want to set off shore and orchestrate all this from afar while the police and military take the brunt of it.
[3:03:02.940 --> 3:03:05.940]  Let's talk to Ruth in Louisiana. Take a call from Bob Chapman.
[3:03:05.940 --> 3:03:07.940]  Ruth, go ahead.
[3:03:07.940 --> 3:03:27.940]  I wanted to make sure, and I'm trying to convince a friend of taking her stocks and bringing it into gold and silver shares or IRAs and that sort of thing. Is that a safe bet?
[3:03:27.940 --> 3:03:37.940]  Let's say this, ma'am. I'm not going to tell you what I would do, but she certainly should diversify, and she should look at what's been performing, but I wouldn't put everything.
[3:03:37.940 --> 3:03:42.940]  I know Bob is himself all in gold when he said, but I wouldn't put everything in one thing.
[3:03:42.940 --> 3:03:52.940]  But yes, if you, I mean, if she didn't invest in gold seven years ago when I said it, she would have three and a half times her wealth when everything else is flat or down. Bob Chapman?
[3:03:52.940 --> 3:04:05.940]  Well, I think people should get out of the market. And if they don't want to be totally in golden silver coins or in shares, they can go to the strongest currencies in the world right now.
[3:04:05.940 --> 3:04:14.940]  And you can buy, well, the best place to go is Canadian Treasuries and Swiss Frank Treasuries if you don't want to be totally in gold.
[3:04:14.940 --> 3:04:22.940]  So an index of things. We're talking about foreign currencies, Swiss, Canadian, we're talking about gold, silver.
[3:04:22.940 --> 3:04:29.940]  Only in the form of bonds. Only in the form of bonds. You don't want to get involved in the currency market. You don't want to.
[3:04:29.940 --> 3:04:33.940]  Because the bonds are like cash. The bonds are like gold.
[3:04:33.940 --> 3:04:39.940]  That's right. It's not as good as gold, but it's second best.
[3:04:39.940 --> 3:04:41.940]  Does that answer your question, Ruth?
[3:04:41.940 --> 3:04:49.940]  Like, you mean just bonds only in golden silver? Or OAs? Or is that not a good bet?
[3:04:49.940 --> 3:04:54.940]  Well, every situation is different. What you should do is email me.
[3:04:54.940 --> 3:05:01.940]  Yep, theinternationalforecaster.com. Thank you, Ruth. And thank you, Bob. We'll see you next Friday. Happy birthday, Big 74.
[3:05:01.940 --> 3:05:09.940]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:05:09.940 --> 3:05:14.940]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:05:14.940 --> 3:05:21.940]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[3:05:21.940 --> 3:05:26.940]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:05:26.940 --> 3:05:31.940]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:05:31.940 --> 3:05:35.940]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:05:35.940 --> 3:05:41.940]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:05:41.940 --> 3:05:44.940]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:44.940 --> 3:05:55.940]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:05:55.940 --> 3:05:59.940]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:05:59.940 --> 3:06:05.940]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:06:05.940 --> 3:06:09.940]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[3:06:09.940 --> 3:06:14.940]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:06:14.940 --> 3:06:20.940]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years

[3:08:21.940 --> 3:08:42.940]  I get emails a couple of times a week. I see comments in the stories on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[3:08:42.940 --> 3:08:47.940]  We'll have an article about doctors admitting the flu shots paralyzing and killing people.
[3:08:47.940 --> 3:08:58.940]  There'll be a comment in there. Alex Jones says that a European death cult is running things.
[3:08:58.940 --> 3:09:10.940]  Now, Alex Jones doesn't say that. Whether it's German elites, British elites, elites in the US, elites out of Israel,
[3:09:10.940 --> 3:09:15.940]  whether it's elites out of Japan, elites out of Russia, I just do the hard research.
[3:09:15.940 --> 3:09:28.940]  I read books they've written. I study what they're into. David Rockefeller, Ted Turner, just you name them.
[3:09:28.940 --> 3:09:45.940]  All these people, Tony Blair, Barack Obama, the Bushes from Skull and Bones, all those people, Francois Mitterrand, the head of the French arts,
[3:09:45.940 --> 3:09:55.940]  writes books about how he loves slave trade and slave children he rapes, and then he doesn't get in trouble, and then they're defending Polanski.
[3:09:55.940 --> 3:10:04.940]  The point is, is that I came into all this as kind of a libertarian Ron Paul type guy, like a mainline Ron Paul person you'd see today.
[3:10:04.940 --> 3:10:16.940]  Now, that was seen as radical 14 years ago, but today it's not, but I'm still seen as a radical just because I've gone further down the rabbit hole.
[3:10:16.940 --> 3:10:28.940]  But I was in my hotel room watching History Channel Wednesday morning before the TV crew with Jesse Ventura came and picked me up.
[3:10:28.940 --> 3:10:36.940]  And I was watching a show about the Masons and watching a show about the Knights Templar, and they admitted Washington DC is a big pentagram and a big square,
[3:10:36.940 --> 3:10:42.940]  and the Washington Monument is a phallus to energize power, and they had the Masons on there admitting it.
[3:10:42.940 --> 3:10:52.940]  I guess it's now time for all that to just come out. And I remember years ago, the three documentary films that we, by the way, sell discounted at infowars.com,
[3:10:52.940 --> 3:11:02.940]  America's Beginnings, The New Atlantis, Secret Mysteries, and we sell all three of their new films. One of them is very new, but they all go in order.
[3:11:02.940 --> 3:11:12.940]  I mean, these are incredibly high quality films, but the point is, is that they are coming out now with a lot of this.
[3:11:12.940 --> 3:11:20.940]  And all I'm doing is going, Well Skull and Bones is a Germanic death cult, according to their own members that have leaked info.
[3:11:20.940 --> 3:11:30.940]  And one of the rituals has been videotaped. I snuck into Bohemian Grove. I videotaped a ritual where a thousand old men were grinding their teeth and hyperventilating,
[3:11:30.940 --> 3:11:37.940]  watching the mock human sacrifice of a child. And like atheists are like, Oh, Alex is crazy. He believes the devil's going to get us.
[3:11:37.940 --> 3:11:43.940]  Look, whether you believe the devil or not, these people do is the point. There are crazy people who believe in this stuff.
[3:11:43.940 --> 3:11:49.940]  Whether you believe in it or not, the crazies believe it and follow it's what I'm saying.
[3:11:49.940 --> 3:12:02.940]  And you look at Maury Strong, the head of the UN Biological Diversity Forum, and when he had the big Davos Switzerland meetings and the meetings in 92 at the
[3:12:02.940 --> 3:12:10.940]  Rio de Janeiro UN summit, he said, we must destroy industrial society for mother nature and Gaia.
[3:12:10.940 --> 3:12:14.940]  And they're all into the occult. They're into a mystery religion.
[3:12:14.940 --> 3:12:22.940]  They're symbols of the pyramid and all these others and they all sing high. I mean, this is real. These people run things.
[3:12:22.940 --> 3:12:31.940]  Look at every major world capital. It's obelisk and it's always the goddess over a war memorial for thousands of dead.
[3:12:31.940 --> 3:12:35.940]  That's the sacrifice to her. And this is in the literature, but I go to a city.
[3:12:35.940 --> 3:12:41.940]  I now know a lot of their language and it's gang sign everywhere.
[3:12:41.940 --> 3:12:46.940]  And I'm not saying it's Masons. Masons are a low level grid of all this.
[3:12:46.940 --> 3:12:51.940]  When you talk about Masons or you talk about Catholics, you talk about Protestants, you talk about Jews.
[3:12:51.940 --> 3:12:59.940]  When you get to the top of it, I mean, look at the Supreme Court building in Israel, giant pyramids, all seeing eyes, Masonic stuff everywhere.
[3:12:59.940 --> 3:13:03.940]  It's all the same. And it isn't Masonic.
[3:13:03.940 --> 3:13:12.940]  Masonic is one branch or brotherhood of this system. That's not saying our founding fathers were bad. A lot of them more than half are Masons.
[3:13:12.940 --> 3:13:16.940]  But George Washington wrote about bad groups in control of Masonry.
[3:13:16.940 --> 3:13:24.940]  And it goes back to the mystery schools in Egypt and the sacred symbols.
[3:13:24.940 --> 3:13:27.940]  And to them, it's white magic and black magic.
[3:13:27.940 --> 3:13:33.940]  So George Washington was a Christian, but he was also into all of this. And so was Solomon.
[3:13:33.940 --> 3:13:38.940]  I'm not here judging these people. I believe Solomon was good. I believe George Washington was good.
[3:13:38.940 --> 3:13:44.940]  It's a very complex issue that, you know, the Mason down the street from you is not drinking blood out of goblets.
[3:13:44.940 --> 3:13:56.940]  But at the higher levels, this is you find out it's Lucifer, Albert Pike, and many other top Masons whose paintings hang in all their lodges.
[3:13:56.940 --> 3:14:05.940]  They state it is Lucifer they worship. And so we need to talk about this. We need to understand this.
[3:14:05.940 --> 3:14:12.940]  We need to know this. And the stuff Dan Brown puts out is purposefully distorted and twisted.
[3:14:12.940 --> 3:14:17.940]  It's this info to the world. So they're revealing their mystery religion, but still deceiving.
[3:14:17.940 --> 3:14:25.940]  And Chris Pinto, of course, put films out that a lot of the stuff that Dan Brown picked up on, but has distorted it.
[3:14:25.940 --> 3:14:35.940]  And so we've got Christian J. Pinto, who has, with David E. Bay, produced the award-winning documentary,
[3:14:35.940 --> 3:14:41.940]  Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1, The New Atlantis, was honored with the ScreenCraft Award for Best Documentary Feature
[3:14:41.940 --> 3:14:47.940]  at the New York Independent Film Festival in 2006, also winning Best Historical Documentary at the Los Angeles International Film Festival.
[3:14:47.940 --> 3:14:54.940]  That's big. The Pinto Bay Company antiquities research firm has also released Volume 2, Riddles and Stone,
[3:14:54.940 --> 3:15:00.940]  the Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., which has become the official selection of the upcoming New York, Los Angeles film festivals.
[3:15:00.940 --> 3:15:09.940]  And they've recently released a new film we're covering, The Phoenix, Dealing with the Dollar. We'll talk about that as well.
[3:15:09.940 --> 3:15:15.940]  Now, people will hear his occult interpretation from the experts, and they may have a different interpretation.
[3:15:15.940 --> 3:15:21.940]  That's because in true mystery schools, it's like a Nuit or Eskimo art.
[3:15:21.940 --> 3:15:25.940]  You look at a totem pole from different angles, it's different animals.
[3:15:25.940 --> 3:15:33.940]  All their symbols have at least three meanings and three faces. Sometimes this many is 12, and that goes into sacred geometry.
[3:15:33.940 --> 3:15:37.940]  But joining us is Chris Pinto. Chris, thank you for coming on.
[3:15:37.940 --> 3:15:45.940]  Eye of the Phoenix is the third film. We have a reduced price, by the way, at infowars.com.
[3:15:45.940 --> 3:15:50.940]  We want to get all three of the films together. You save a lot, but Eye of the Phoenix is the next one.
[3:15:50.940 --> 3:16:02.940]  Maybe we should pop one of the films in for prismplanet.tv viewers and play a few random areas in the background while Chris is talking so people can see the quality of these films.
[3:16:02.940 --> 3:16:05.940]  It's just amazing. Chris Pinto, thanks for being here.
[3:16:05.940 --> 3:16:08.940]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex. It's great to be on the show again.
[3:16:08.940 --> 3:16:11.940]  What did you think of that little five-minute rant as I laid that out?
[3:16:11.940 --> 3:16:16.940]  I thought it was great. You're making some great points there. We deal with this all the time.
[3:16:16.940 --> 3:16:24.940]  People who are uninformed of what these societies are doing, they often think when you tell them about their symbolism and whatnot, they'll say,
[3:16:24.940 --> 3:16:28.940]  oh, well, I don't believe in all of that, as though it's not going to affect them.
[3:16:28.940 --> 3:16:34.940]  And one of the things I tell people is it doesn't matter if you believe in it or not.
[3:16:34.940 --> 3:16:45.940]  The six million Jews who were killed in concentration camps during World War II, they may not have believed in Hitler's occultism, but they were definitely impacted by it.
[3:16:45.940 --> 3:16:51.940]  Their lives were changed dramatically because of what Hitler and the Nazis believed in what they were into.
[3:16:51.940 --> 3:16:55.940]  And they were totally into the mystery schools' anticultism.
[3:16:55.940 --> 3:17:02.940]  And they were into the same kinds of practices that you expose out there in the Bohemian Grove in Northern California.
[3:17:02.940 --> 3:17:09.940]  And I had friends who have lived up there that I knew when I lived out in California.
[3:17:09.940 --> 3:17:15.940]  They talked about how there are sometimes protests outside the Bohemian Grove.
[3:17:15.940 --> 3:17:21.940]  And there are all kinds of things. People are concerned about it in that part of the world, but it never makes the mainstream news.
[3:17:21.940 --> 3:17:29.940]  Nobody ever talks about it, of course, because you've got people like George W. Bush and his dad going out there and Newt Gingrich and others.
[3:17:29.940 --> 3:17:34.940]  And so nobody wants to blow the whistle on these guys at a mainstream level.
[3:17:34.940 --> 3:17:40.940]  But they are deeply involved in deep, dark occultism.
[3:17:40.940 --> 3:17:48.940]  Even the name Bohemian Grove is specifically a reference to things in the Old Testament and the Bible.
[3:17:48.940 --> 3:17:55.940]  When God is reproving the children of Israel for going into the groves and so on and worshiping idols.
[3:17:55.940 --> 3:18:01.940]  Well, the Grove is also the occult name of a conclave of warlocks and witches.
[3:18:01.940 --> 3:18:06.940]  It's also the name of a great meeting of occultists in many of their histories.
[3:18:06.940 --> 3:18:09.940]  Take Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor.
[3:18:09.940 --> 3:18:15.940]  He wrote a book, Men in Power is a Political Retrospective, where he said we have our own groves where we do rituals.
[3:18:15.940 --> 3:18:20.940]  But my favorite place to do them is Bohemian Grove, where we set world policy for world government.
[3:18:20.940 --> 3:18:24.940]  This is written by him. This is a global network.
[3:18:24.940 --> 3:18:29.940]  And at the top of the German groups, Jewish groups, British groups, it doesn't matter.
[3:18:29.940 --> 3:18:36.940]  The Japanese are into this stuff. The Aztecs were into this. It is the same basic religion.
[3:18:36.940 --> 3:18:43.940]  Yeah, it is. And as you said, it goes throughout all the major cultures of the world and a number of the minor cultures of the world.
[3:18:43.940 --> 3:18:46.940]  And that's what they're trying to draw upon.
[3:18:46.940 --> 3:18:53.940]  The whole concept of the religious tolerance movement, where they're trying to say that all religions are one and the same.
[3:18:53.940 --> 3:18:59.940]  Really, what they're doing is they're applying the ancient mystery principles.
[3:18:59.940 --> 3:19:05.940]  If you study, for example, the life of Levi, Levi who we talk about in our films.
[3:19:05.940 --> 3:19:11.940]  Probably the most influential occultist of the last 200 years. Influenced Albert Pike, Madame Blavatsky,
[3:19:11.940 --> 3:19:17.940]  Alester Crowley, Manly P. Hall, and then the whole Scottish right-free masonry.
[3:19:17.940 --> 3:19:26.940]  Many masons don't realize that Albert Pike incorporated whole chapters of Levi's writings into his book Morals and Dogma.
[3:19:26.940 --> 3:19:31.940]  Well, Levi was a full-on Luciferian statement.
[3:19:31.940 --> 3:19:37.940]  He's the guy who designs a Baphomet image with a goat-headed god with a flame above his head.
[3:19:37.940 --> 3:19:42.940]  Let's talk about him when we get back. And the newest film, Eye of the Phoenix.
[3:19:42.940 --> 3:19:50.940]  Chris Pinto is our guest. Again, you can get all three of these amazing films at infowars.com while you're ordering pre-ordering at ships next week.
[3:19:50.940 --> 3:20:16.940]  Follow the Republic premieres October 21st at prismplanet.tv. We'll be right back with Chris Pinto.
[3:20:16.940 --> 3:20:23.940]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.

[3:21:01.940 --> 3:21:07.940]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:07.940 --> 3:21:14.940]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[3:21:14.940 --> 3:21:21.940]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[3:21:21.940 --> 3:21:25.940]  While Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:21:25.940 --> 3:21:36.940]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:21:36.940 --> 3:21:40.940]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:21:40.940 --> 3:21:47.940]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:21:47.940 --> 3:21:55.940]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[3:22:13.940 --> 3:22:25.940]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high the stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[3:24:16.940 --> 3:24:21.940]  Chris Pinto is our guest, the elite of the planet, worship Lucifer.
[3:24:21.940 --> 3:24:23.940]  And that's a fact.
[3:24:23.940 --> 3:24:28.940]  And they're now revealing a lot of this even on mainstream television, but twisting it.
[3:24:28.940 --> 3:24:31.940]  Let's go back to Chris Pinto, the filmmaker.
[3:24:31.940 --> 3:24:38.940]  Chris, get into this individual who you're saying the last 200 years is one of the main progenitors of the rise of the Luciferian religion.
[3:24:38.940 --> 3:24:46.940]  Aliface Levi, he's probably the most influential guy and his symbols, his information.
[3:24:46.940 --> 3:24:53.940]  In fact, the famous quote from Albert Pike where he says, Lucifer, is it he who bears the light, doubt it not.
[3:24:53.940 --> 3:24:55.940]  He's quoting Aliface Levi.
[3:24:55.940 --> 3:25:04.940]  If you look up any kind of satanic website anywhere, not that I recommend them, but they often use that inverted pentagram with the goat head on it.
[3:25:04.940 --> 3:25:08.940]  Levi was the one who designed that originally.
[3:25:08.940 --> 3:25:14.940]  Also, the buffamette image of the goat headed God with the flame above his head sitting cross-legged.
[3:25:14.940 --> 3:25:19.940]  That's a very common satanic symbol also designed by Aliface Levi.
[3:25:19.940 --> 3:25:27.940]  Levi was somebody who, when you get on the other side of the revolutionary era, as the American and French revolutions had happened,
[3:25:27.940 --> 3:25:33.940]  a lot of these guys that were into the occult who in the mystery schools, they just kept things secret.
[3:25:33.940 --> 3:25:39.940]  They handed down all of their information through the oral tradition once the revolutions broke out.
[3:25:39.940 --> 3:25:47.940]  People were no longer being arrested if they were involved in occultism or witchcraft and this kind of thing
[3:25:47.940 --> 3:25:53.940]  because of the ideas of religious freedom that were being promoted and now legalized.
[3:25:53.940 --> 3:26:03.940]  A lot of these guys who were in the inner chambers of some secret conclave somewhere, they come out and they start publishing and writing
[3:26:03.940 --> 3:26:07.940]  what had been believed by these occult groups for centuries.
[3:26:07.940 --> 3:26:10.940]  Levi was one of the first to do it.
[3:26:10.940 --> 3:26:18.940]  He goes now, and the reason that he's so often imitated by the leaders now, you read the writings of Madame Blavatsky, her secret doctrine.
[3:26:18.940 --> 3:26:28.940]  She quotes Levi extensively. Albert Pike, same thing, infusing Levi's ideas into the Scottish Rite rituals that American presidents and judges
[3:26:28.940 --> 3:26:37.940]  and congressmen and so on. If you're a Scottish Rite Mason, you are going through rituals and ceremonies that have the writings and the ideas
[3:26:37.940 --> 3:26:40.940]  of Levi and Albert Pike interwoven in them.
[3:26:40.940 --> 3:26:48.940]  So there's a change in masonry in the last 200 years influenced by Levi.
[3:26:48.940 --> 3:26:56.940]  Oh yeah, dramatically, especially when you get into Scottish Rite Masonry. That's his big influence because Pike took so much of his work.
[3:26:56.940 --> 3:27:04.940]  I mean, Pike says in his writings, Albert Pike, and we've been there, we show you the inside of the Masonic House of the Temple in Washington, D.C.
[3:27:04.940 --> 3:27:10.940]  We got permission to go in there and film. We interviewed Dr. Brent Morris, who's the head of...
[3:27:10.940 --> 3:27:16.940]  Oh, he's the managing editor for the Scottish Rite Journal, which is like the leading Masonic magazine.
[3:27:16.940 --> 3:27:25.940]  But they have an Albert Pike room down below with the death mask of Albert Pike and his pipes and all of his books and everything.
[3:27:25.940 --> 3:27:29.940]  They have Pike buried in the wall, there in the temple.
[3:27:29.940 --> 3:27:37.940]  They have, when you walk in, the first thing you see is a big grand hall and at the end of the hall there's like a staircase leading up to an altar
[3:27:37.940 --> 3:27:40.940]  and there's a bust on the altar and it's Albert Pike.
[3:27:40.940 --> 3:27:47.940]  The reason I say these things is because sometimes the masons will try to marginalize him and say he's not that important
[3:27:47.940 --> 3:27:51.940]  because he has all these quotes pertaining to Lucifer.
[3:27:51.940 --> 3:28:02.940]  And it was Pike who said, Pike said that the entire purpose of Masonry is a continual progression toward the light.
[3:28:02.940 --> 3:28:06.940]  Okay, and that's the big thing. They're always talking about light and going toward the light.
[3:28:06.940 --> 3:28:11.940]  And then Pike says in his writings, Lucifer, is it he who bears the light?
[3:28:11.940 --> 3:28:12.940]  Doubt it not.
[3:28:12.940 --> 3:28:17.940]  So what they're leading their members toward, whether they know it or not,
[3:28:17.940 --> 3:28:21.940]  is ultimately toward the full-on worship of Lucifer.
[3:28:21.940 --> 3:28:26.940]  And by the way, George Washington, as you know before he died, spoke out against a lot of other senior masons did,
[3:28:26.940 --> 3:28:30.940]  but you talk to low-level masons, they're like, oh, my ritual is another thing to do with this.
[3:28:30.940 --> 3:28:35.940]  You can show them Morals and Dogma, Albert Pike, you can show them Manly Peahall.
[3:28:35.940 --> 3:28:41.940]  These are the big grand masons the last 200 years and they just won't look at it. They're in denial.
[3:28:41.940 --> 3:28:48.940]  Yeah, they are. And what they've done is they used to give everybody, Alex, they would give them Pike's book, Morals and Dogma.
[3:28:48.940 --> 3:28:52.940]  Then they stopped doing that, I think, because it was just too controversial.
[3:28:52.940 --> 3:28:59.940]  Now they give the masons another book called A Bridge to Light, which is like a smaller book.
[3:28:59.940 --> 3:29:02.940]  And it's edited by some other modern Mason.
[3:29:02.940 --> 3:29:09.940]  But what they've done, the entire book, even A Bridge to Light, is just like the cliff notes of Albert Pike's writings.
[3:29:09.940 --> 3:29:12.940]  It's an abbreviation of his writings.
[3:29:12.940 --> 3:29:22.940]  And I think that that is done possibly to deceive some of these masons so that they don't think that they're being directly involved with Pike's Luciferianism.
[3:29:22.940 --> 3:29:26.940]  But there's no way around it. He is interwoven in Scottish Rite Masonry.
[3:29:26.940 --> 3:29:33.940]  And I've been to lodges, you know, I've visited lodges out in California and so on where you walk inside.
[3:29:33.940 --> 3:29:44.940]  Right ahead, I confronted the masons out in California out there and they tried to get me to, you know, we'll come down to the lodge and just visit us one day and you'll see.
[3:29:44.940 --> 3:29:51.940]  Well, stay there. I want to hear about what happened with this confrontation with Chris Pinto straight ahead.
[3:29:51.940 --> 3:30:00.940]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[3:30:06.940 --> 3:30:15.940]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:15.940 --> 3:30:20.940]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[3:30:20.940 --> 3:30:22.940]  Now, what are you going to do about it?

[3:33:21.940 --> 3:33:26.940]  I promised to do this when we were live on Prison Planet Dot TV that we're going to go back to our guest.
[3:33:26.940 --> 3:33:36.940]  I was mailed the Houston Post. They don't even have this newspaper anymore, I don't think.
[3:33:36.940 --> 3:33:46.940]  Blue Shots Defended But Growing Number of Elderly Refusing Vaccine. This is from May 5th, 1970.
[3:33:46.940 --> 3:33:51.940]  And then they had the big swine flu fear mongering broke out on the military base, killed some people.
[3:33:51.940 --> 3:33:56.940]  And then they forced that inoculation on America and a bunch of people died so they had to stop.
[3:33:56.940 --> 3:34:02.940]  Growing Number of Elderly Refusing Vaccine Believing It Causes Health Problems.
[3:34:02.940 --> 3:34:07.940]  Next week, I'm going to leave this on my desk. Maybe even Sunday, I'm going to read this on air.
[3:34:07.940 --> 3:34:13.940]  Houston health officials were faced Thursday night with more physician cancellations for swine flu vaccine.
[3:34:13.940 --> 3:34:16.940]  A growing number of elderly persons refusing to take their shots.
[3:34:16.940 --> 3:34:23.940]  The Texas Department of Health resources announced earlier in Austin that statewide flu vaccine program would resume Monday,
[3:34:23.940 --> 3:34:25.940]  trying to force it on people. They're never stopping.
[3:34:25.940 --> 3:34:30.940]  It has been suspended following the deaths of several persons who have been given the vaccine.
[3:34:30.940 --> 3:34:33.940]  Federal scientists ruled out the vaccine is the cause of deaths.
[3:34:33.940 --> 3:34:38.940]  But then a few years later, they admitted it. And we now have this happening again right now.
[3:34:38.940 --> 3:34:43.940]  And meanwhile, I have these articles where German military is refusing to take it.
[3:34:43.940 --> 3:34:51.940]  We've got swine flu fears grow as NHS staff, National Health Service staff in England, shun the vaccine.
[3:34:51.940 --> 3:35:01.940]  Going back to Chris Pinto, maker of the amazing trilogy of documentary films, The Latest Eye of the Phoenix.
[3:35:01.940 --> 3:35:08.940]  We have all three of the films together in a discount three pack at infowars.com while you're there.
[3:35:08.940 --> 3:35:11.940]  Pre-ordering comes out next week, fall of the Republic.
[3:35:11.940 --> 3:35:15.940]  Going back to Chris Pinto, continue making your points.
[3:35:15.940 --> 3:35:20.940]  You were talking about confronting the Masons going down to their facility.
[3:35:20.940 --> 3:35:25.940]  And then we're going to play a Mason outside a Shriner event talking about sweet Lucifer.
[3:35:25.940 --> 3:35:26.940]  Go ahead.
[3:35:26.940 --> 3:35:33.940]  Yeah, well, the point I was making really is about Pike because one of the first things that you encounter,
[3:35:33.940 --> 3:35:37.940]  whenever you confront free Masons, they try to marginalize Albert Pike.
[3:35:37.940 --> 3:35:41.940]  But I was out in California and these Masons invited me down at a lodge and I said,
[3:35:41.940 --> 3:35:44.940]  okay, I'll come down for a day and let them show me around.
[3:35:44.940 --> 3:35:52.940]  But as soon as I got there, I walked in and they had their ceremonial hall and these big double doors and whatnot.
[3:35:52.940 --> 3:35:57.940]  Right out front, there's this gigantic bronze bust of Albert Pike.
[3:35:57.940 --> 3:36:02.940]  And I just looked at him kind of innocently and I said, hey guys, what's the deal with Pike?
[3:36:02.940 --> 3:36:04.940]  Why is he so influential?
[3:36:04.940 --> 3:36:09.940]  And he said, well, he designed all the rituals and ceremonies of the Scottish Rite.
[3:36:09.940 --> 3:36:14.940]  And so this is why I say he's interwoven in Masonry.
[3:36:14.940 --> 3:36:19.940]  The Masons have fought for years to keep his statue there in Washington, D.C.
[3:36:19.940 --> 3:36:25.940]  And I tell you the statue, in fact, when we were filming it for Riddles and Stone, part two in the series,
[3:36:25.940 --> 3:36:30.940]  we were confronted by a police officer who turned out to be a Mason.
[3:36:30.940 --> 3:36:33.940]  And he was concerned why we were filming it.
[3:36:33.940 --> 3:36:40.940]  And thankfully, my guide there in Washington, D.C. was also a Washington, D.C. police officer, great guy.
[3:36:40.940 --> 3:36:43.940]  And he sort of interceded for me.
[3:36:43.940 --> 3:36:48.940]  But then we got into a big conversation with him and he was trying to support and promote Albert Pike.
[3:36:48.940 --> 3:36:55.940]  The reason people in D.C. want that statue taken down is because Pike is one of the original founders of the Ku Klux Klan.
[3:36:55.940 --> 3:36:58.940]  Yeah, the founder, the founder, Confederate General.
[3:36:58.940 --> 3:37:00.940]  Now let's expand on that.
[3:37:00.940 --> 3:37:02.940]  Here's a police officer and I've been to the park.
[3:37:02.940 --> 3:37:07.940]  We videoed it as well for an upcoming film close to the Supreme Court.
[3:37:07.940 --> 3:37:15.940]  It's a public park and this Mason who's for freedom of speech, he's coming over trying to keep you from filming it.
[3:37:15.940 --> 3:37:18.940]  It's just unbelievable.
[3:37:18.940 --> 3:37:25.940]  The Masonry of George Washington clearly is very different from the Masonry we have today.
[3:37:25.940 --> 3:37:33.940]  Yeah, that's what Washington was because what was happening from what I've been able to gather from the history there
[3:37:33.940 --> 3:37:40.940]  is you had the radicalized form of Masonry over in Europe involved with the French Revolution.
[3:37:40.940 --> 3:37:42.940]  And these guys were blood thirsty.
[3:37:42.940 --> 3:37:49.940]  The Jacobins. Oh yeah, the Jacobins were blood thirsty and they were into just slaughtering people.
[3:37:49.940 --> 3:37:55.940]  And raping children in serious devil worship, hellfire club type stuff, even worse.
[3:37:55.940 --> 3:37:57.940]  And go ahead.
[3:37:57.940 --> 3:38:02.940]  Yeah, that's exactly it. They were just extremely radical and Washington opposed them.
[3:38:02.940 --> 3:38:08.940]  He did not agree with what they were doing and one of them, one of their ambassadors,
[3:38:08.940 --> 3:38:16.940]  a citizen, Jenae, we talk about him in part two, but Jenae came over and a lot of people don't realize these guys stirred up
[3:38:16.940 --> 3:38:19.940]  all kinds of, they were trying to have another revolution.
[3:38:19.940 --> 3:38:20.940]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[3:38:20.940 --> 3:38:24.940]  Washington had people burning his effigy all over the country.
[3:38:24.940 --> 3:38:30.940]  The French Masons came in and tried to have, they wanted to change the days to 10 days a week.
[3:38:30.940 --> 3:38:32.940]  They wanted to break up families.
[3:38:32.940 --> 3:38:38.940]  It's the same crap called liberalism today where it's unbelievable.
[3:38:38.940 --> 3:38:40.940]  People don't know what happened in France.
[3:38:40.940 --> 3:38:44.940]  No, and they don't realize how, you had different people.
[3:38:44.940 --> 3:38:46.940]  You had some people like Jefferson.
[3:38:46.940 --> 3:38:48.940]  Jefferson supported the French Revolution.
[3:38:48.940 --> 3:38:50.940]  Washington did not.
[3:38:50.940 --> 3:38:52.940]  There was a division among them.
[3:38:52.940 --> 3:38:56.940]  Jefferson had some pretty dark comments when he heard about all the bloodletting.
[3:38:56.940 --> 3:39:04.940]  He said, well, it's better that every nation be reduced to a single Adam and Eve than that the French Revolution failed.
[3:39:04.940 --> 3:39:12.940]  So he tried to justify the bloodletting, but other founders like Washington simply did not approve of it.
[3:39:12.940 --> 3:39:19.940]  And at one point, this guy, citizen Jenae, stirred up a crowd in Philadelphia and they tried to, because Washington would not support
[3:39:19.940 --> 3:39:29.940]  the French Revolution and they tried to drag Washington out of his house to try and get him to try and force him to support the French Revolution.
[3:39:29.940 --> 3:39:37.940]  And we give the quote from John Adams in the film, but these are parts of American history that have been lost and they're not taught in our schoolbook.
[3:39:37.940 --> 3:39:39.940]  But they are, they're documented.
[3:39:39.940 --> 3:39:42.940]  You can find the letters in the Library of Congress.
[3:39:42.940 --> 3:39:48.940]  But these guys were radicals and this was the whole reason for the Alien and Sedition Act.
[3:39:48.940 --> 3:39:53.940]  It was to put these guys down because they were trying to subvert the country.
[3:39:53.940 --> 3:40:09.940]  And it's the reason why Washington, in his farewell address, had said to the American people that we ought not to seek revolution as the continual solution to whatever problems we're facing with the government.
[3:40:09.940 --> 3:40:12.940]  That we couldn't have this ongoing series.
[3:40:12.940 --> 3:40:25.940]  Because in truth, the Luciferians wanted a violent revolution to destroy everything in their way, the family, religion, to make themselves the gods of a totally tyrannical world government based in the United States.
[3:40:25.940 --> 3:40:27.940]  And that's what your series exposes.
[3:40:27.940 --> 3:40:28.940]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:40:28.940 --> 3:40:29.940]  That's what they wanted.
[3:40:29.940 --> 3:40:33.940]  They wanted total chaos, the breaking down of every boundary.
[3:40:33.940 --> 3:40:47.940]  And it's why there are great quotes from Washington where he says that any nation that casts off the rules of order and right that heaven itself has ordained cannot be expected to prosper.
[3:40:47.940 --> 3:41:00.940]  And the reason he's saying that is because he's responding to what was going on in France at the time, that they wanted to destroy everything, the family unit, the calendar, any kind of law and order.
[3:41:00.940 --> 3:41:03.940]  And they tried it in France and killed close to 20% of the population.
[3:41:03.940 --> 3:41:04.940]  That isn't known.
[3:41:04.940 --> 3:41:13.940]  The Red Terror, Lenin said it was part two of what happened in France, the whole communist revolution, the Red Star.
[3:41:13.940 --> 3:41:15.940]  These people mean business.
[3:41:15.940 --> 3:41:21.940]  Yeah, Hitler had said that his Nazi revolution was the exact counterpart of the French Revolution.
[3:41:21.940 --> 3:41:42.940]  It was in the French Revolution that they had launched the first depopulation program where they literally broke out a map and went down to the different towns and regions in France and were determined that they were going to depopulate France so that the people who survived would be able to find work and get food and so on.
[3:41:42.940 --> 3:41:51.940]  And they had planned to kill like 9 million people. And then what happened was they were slaughtering people and they only killed about 300,000 or so.
[3:41:51.940 --> 3:41:55.940]  But the bodies kept piling up and they didn't know what to do with them.
[3:41:55.940 --> 3:42:08.940]  And I believe it's one of my theories that when Hitler came up with his final solution program, part of what the Nazis were doing was trying to find a fast, efficient way to kill people and dispose of the body.
[3:42:08.940 --> 3:42:17.940]  Well, they said they were going to take over the planet and region by region depopulate, putting things in the water to sterilize it first, taking children and they would die of a medical problem.
[3:42:17.940 --> 3:42:25.940]  This has all been declassified. That is what ecoscience, that's what I want to bring up today then because we're talking about history.
[3:42:25.940 --> 3:42:40.940]  When you look at the environmentalists, the eugenicists, the Maurice Strongs, I know this is coming and you're moving through history in your series. When you look at ecoscience and the eugenicists, when you look at the 1996 UN biological diversity assessment.
[3:42:40.940 --> 3:42:45.940]  We have this in my film, Road to Tyranny. You can get this at the UN website.
[3:42:45.940 --> 3:42:55.940]  We'll put that on screen, that devil snake thing. We're playing some of the video for radio listeners at presentplanet.tv from one of his films, one of the latest films.
[3:42:55.940 --> 3:43:06.940]  But the issue is, the eugenicist and the UN document in 1996 says, the ancient world kept down population with wars, famine and human sacrifice.
[3:43:06.940 --> 3:43:17.940]  We must re-institute human sacrifice in the capitals and make the bloodletting be part of society. I mean, this is official UN law, says they want temples and blood sacrifice.
[3:43:17.940 --> 3:43:27.940]  Now, that sounds insane. I'm not the insane one saying this is official UN policy. Can you talk about the modern people we're dealing with?
[3:43:27.940 --> 3:43:39.940]  Yeah, I mean, we constantly get questions from people who will ask about the reality of concentration camps and depopulation programs and things like that, and are these things real and whatnot.
[3:43:39.940 --> 3:43:55.940]  And one of the things that I point to, I'll just say, look at what UN representatives and guys who have written books on this, what they talk about, they admit that some 170 to 200 million people were slaughtered
[3:43:55.940 --> 3:43:59.940]  by corrupt governments just in the 20th century.
[3:43:59.940 --> 3:44:10.940]  That's conservative, if you count Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Lenin, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro and others, it's over 200 million.
[3:44:10.940 --> 3:44:16.940]  Yeah, and when you've got, and again, that is, again, I usually go with the conservative numbers to try and convince people.
[3:44:16.940 --> 3:44:20.940]  Well, that's it. They always get control of a country, though, and just start killing.
[3:44:20.940 --> 3:44:30.940]  Exactly. And I say to people, I say, why do you think they're doing this? You know, if there's no depopulation program, why are they killing 200 million people?
[3:44:30.940 --> 3:44:35.940]  They're doing it because it's part of an agenda, and it is. It's a global agenda.
[3:44:35.940 --> 3:44:44.940]  I mean, I can't necessarily make all the connections in every country, but in some of the big ways, especially when you trace it from these radical groups.
[3:44:44.940 --> 3:44:52.940]  And these things are admitted, like going back to France for a minute, the French Revolution, all of this is admitted by Dr. James Billington in his book,
[3:44:52.940 --> 3:44:55.940]  Fire in the Minds of Men, that we quote in the series.
[3:44:55.940 --> 3:45:00.940]  Billington is not a conspiracy writer. He's the librarian of Congress.
[3:45:00.940 --> 3:45:08.940]  He's as official and historian as you can get, and his book is quoted by President George W. Bush in 2005.
[3:45:08.940 --> 3:45:15.940]  And Bush admitted in his presidential speech, he says, we have lit a fire as well, a fire in the minds of men.
[3:45:15.940 --> 3:45:21.940]  You know, it warms those who feel its power. It burns those who fight its progress.
[3:45:21.940 --> 3:45:28.940]  Think about those words from the President of the United States. You fight with the progress of this fire that we've set up.
[3:45:28.940 --> 3:45:37.940]  You're going to get burned. That's what he's saying. He says, one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.
[3:45:37.940 --> 3:45:43.940]  But instead, when you really look at the light they're bringing, it's a dark light. It's evil. It kills. It destroys.
[3:45:43.940 --> 3:45:50.940]  They openly state in all of these books and publications that they're going to eradicate the family and make us all slaves.
[3:45:50.940 --> 3:45:57.940]  But that's the freedom. It's the freedom for the elite to kill the unwashed, to kill the uninitiated, the profane.
[3:45:57.940 --> 3:46:00.940]  We are animals to be slaughtered at their pleasure.
[3:46:00.940 --> 3:46:08.940]  It's a giant party land, a giant world of raping, murder, death, slaughter for them and their black uniforms as they march forward.
[3:46:08.940 --> 3:46:14.940]  Exactly. And you hit the nail right on the head the way that they sell this to the population.
[3:46:14.940 --> 3:46:24.940]  It's just what Lenin did, what Hitler did, what communism has done in every country is they go in and they pretend that they are going to represent the interest of the people.
[3:46:24.940 --> 3:46:29.940]  That's why they call it the People's Republic of China. You know, supposedly it's for the people.
[3:46:29.940 --> 3:46:32.940]  But it's not for the people at all. It's for the elitists.
[3:46:32.940 --> 3:46:40.940]  It's for the few and they're going to turn the people into cattle and then start massacring those that don't go along with their programs.
[3:46:40.940 --> 3:46:47.940]  And notice now, there's no criticism of regimes that kill and torture their people unless it's Iran and they want to attack them.
[3:46:47.940 --> 3:46:52.940]  China's good. They light up the Empire State Building for the Chinese Communist holiday.
[3:46:52.940 --> 3:46:54.940]  I mean, this is in our face.
[3:46:54.940 --> 3:47:06.940]  Yeah. In fact, there's a group called Voice of the Martyrs that documents how Christians who are in China are persecuted even to this day.
[3:47:06.940 --> 3:47:17.940]  And there are still stories coming out of these just horrible tortures that happen to people who speak out against the government or speak out against the injustice that is done there.
[3:47:17.940 --> 3:47:27.940]  And yet we never hear anything about this. But it's an ongoing issue. This is what the New World Order is about.
[3:47:27.940 --> 3:47:30.940]  I want to play a clip. This is about two years old.
[3:47:30.940 --> 3:47:37.940]  And if you can really get a Mason to talk to you, a high level one, they'll explain, oh, I love God. I love Jesus.
[3:47:37.940 --> 3:47:41.940]  And Jesus and Lucifer are twin brothers.
[3:47:41.940 --> 3:47:45.940]  And he just starts talking about, I do love God. I love Lucifer.
[3:47:45.940 --> 3:47:51.940]  Sweet Lucifer. And the guy is in seething with, I mean, he's really having a religious moment.
[3:47:51.940 --> 3:47:55.940]  And like a Christian saying, hallelujah and shaking, he's all Lucifer.
[3:47:55.940 --> 3:47:58.940]  Let's go ahead and play the Lucifer lover. Here it is.
[3:47:58.940 --> 3:48:01.940]  Lucifer, what is your problem?
[3:48:01.940 --> 3:48:02.940]  Just that, sir.
[3:48:02.940 --> 3:48:05.940]  Start it back over. Start over because the first second didn't play.
[3:48:05.940 --> 3:48:11.940]  He says, I am Lucifer. They kind of cut it quick. He goes, I am Lucifer. What's your problem? Here it is.
[3:48:11.940 --> 3:48:14.940]  Lucifer, what is your problem?
[3:48:14.940 --> 3:48:18.940]  Just that, sir. I'm a Christian, sir.
[3:48:18.940 --> 3:48:23.940]  I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent. How can you say anything to buy it about me?
[3:48:23.940 --> 3:48:25.940]  Sir, you need to be born again.
[3:48:25.940 --> 3:48:26.940]  I am born again.
[3:48:26.940 --> 3:48:28.940]  Now, did you just say that you're Lucifer?
[3:48:28.940 --> 3:48:29.940]  I am Lucifer.
[3:48:29.940 --> 3:48:31.940]  Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[3:48:31.940 --> 3:48:35.940]  Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's out to help people.
[3:48:35.940 --> 3:48:36.940]  Lucifer is?
[3:48:36.940 --> 3:48:37.940]  Yeah.
[3:48:37.940 --> 3:48:40.940]  Lucifer, say that again. Lucifer is a pure, holy.
[3:48:40.940 --> 3:48:41.940]  Virtuous.
[3:48:41.940 --> 3:48:44.940]  Virtuous. Now, is he the Lucifer that God created?
[3:48:44.940 --> 3:48:45.940]  That's the same one.
[3:48:45.940 --> 3:48:48.940]  Oh, man, this is great. I'm going to put this on the Internet.
[3:48:48.940 --> 3:48:50.940]  Oh, God bless you, brother.
[3:48:50.940 --> 3:48:55.940]  Because that's exactly what the Shriners and Masons teach, is that Lucifer is like.
[3:48:55.940 --> 3:48:56.940]  No.
[3:48:56.940 --> 3:48:58.940]  What about those hospitals?
[3:48:58.940 --> 3:48:59.940]  You know what, sir?
[3:48:59.940 --> 3:49:04.940]  Jesus said, many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, we do not do these good deeds in your name.
[3:49:04.940 --> 3:49:08.940]  And you'll say away from me, workers of iniquity, I never knew you.
[3:49:08.940 --> 3:49:10.940]  Jesus said?
[3:49:10.940 --> 3:49:12.940]  In Matthew chapter 5.
[3:49:12.940 --> 3:49:14.940]  Mercy.
[3:49:14.940 --> 3:49:15.940]  No.
[3:49:15.940 --> 3:49:16.940]  That's hard to believe.
[3:49:16.940 --> 3:49:18.940]  So, you're a Christian and you don't know that.
[3:49:18.940 --> 3:49:19.940]  Actually.
[3:49:19.940 --> 3:49:21.940]  No, I really am.
[3:49:21.940 --> 3:49:22.940]  You are.
[3:49:22.940 --> 3:49:23.940]  Because I'm pure and virtuous.
[3:49:23.940 --> 3:49:24.940]  You're pure and virtuous.
[3:49:24.940 --> 3:49:25.940]  Okay, yeah.
[3:49:25.940 --> 3:49:27.940]  In other words, you're perfect without Jesus, right?
[3:49:27.940 --> 3:49:28.940]  No, no, no.
[3:49:28.940 --> 3:49:29.940]  No.
[3:49:29.940 --> 3:49:30.940]  Okay, tell me about Jesus.
[3:49:30.940 --> 3:49:31.940]  Who is Jesus?
[3:49:31.940 --> 3:49:33.940]  He's my leader.
[3:49:33.940 --> 3:49:34.940]  Is he the Son of God?
[3:49:34.940 --> 3:49:35.940]  Yes, he is.
[3:49:35.940 --> 3:49:37.940]  Is he the only worshipful master?
[3:49:37.940 --> 3:49:38.940]  Yes.
[3:49:38.940 --> 3:49:40.940]  Have you ever been called worshipful master?
[3:49:40.940 --> 3:49:42.940]  No, because I've just been too busy.
[3:49:42.940 --> 3:49:43.940]  I've been working.
[3:49:43.940 --> 3:49:44.940]  Working.
[3:49:44.940 --> 3:49:45.940]  Working to help people.
[3:49:45.940 --> 3:49:46.940]  What kind of work?
[3:49:46.940 --> 3:49:48.940]  Get out of here.
[3:49:48.940 --> 3:49:58.940]  See, this is what Mason confesses, is that Lucifer is light.
[3:49:58.940 --> 3:50:03.940]  Chris Pinto, I mean, and these lunatics are running everything.
[3:50:03.940 --> 3:50:07.940]  Yeah, people don't realize, Alex, that that doctrine that he's describing there,
[3:50:07.940 --> 3:50:12.940]  he's, even though he sounds a little wacky, this is what the guys who are, you know,
[3:50:12.940 --> 3:50:17.940]  the inner core of the United Nations, this is what the guys who, you know,
[3:50:17.940 --> 3:50:23.940]  we're controlling and manipulating FDR's administration, which we show in Eye of the Phoenix.
[3:50:23.940 --> 3:50:30.940]  This is what the Theosophists, the Theosophical Society, and the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians,
[3:50:30.940 --> 3:50:33.940]  the inner core, they all do the same thing.
[3:50:33.940 --> 3:50:37.940]  And Madame Blavatsky talked about it in her book, The Secret Doctrine,
[3:50:37.940 --> 3:50:43.940]  and she called it Demon F. Deus Inversus, The Devil Is God Inverted.
[3:50:43.940 --> 3:50:46.940]  And this is what Dan Brown is promoting in this new book.
[3:50:46.940 --> 3:50:49.940]  You know, I meant to get into that, and we're not going to have time to take calls,
[3:50:49.940 --> 3:50:52.940]  I apologize, but in the final segment, we'll get into Dan Brown,
[3:50:52.940 --> 3:50:55.940]  and we'll clearly got to get you back on, Chris Pinto.
[3:50:55.940 --> 3:50:58.940]  We carry the whole trilogy, discounted at infowars.com.
[3:50:58.940 --> 3:51:02.940]  You definitely want to see it.
[3:51:02.940 --> 3:51:05.940]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[3:51:05.940 --> 3:51:09.940]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[3:51:09.940 --> 3:51:15.940]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride at less than 2 cents per gallon?
[3:51:15.940 --> 3:51:18.940]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water,
[3:51:18.940 --> 3:51:22.940]  remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[3:51:22.940 --> 3:51:25.940]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water,
[3:51:25.940 --> 3:51:28.940]  making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[3:52:02.940 --> 3:52:08.940]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.940 --> 3:52:15.940]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[3:52:15.940 --> 3:52:22.940]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:22.940 --> 3:52:27.940]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:27.940 --> 3:52:31.940]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:52:31.940 --> 3:52:38.940]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.940 --> 3:52:42.940]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:52:42.940 --> 3:52:49.940]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:49.940 --> 3:52:54.940]  This is a short copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com,

[3:54:00.940 --> 3:54:05.940]  Either you're with us, or you're with the terrorists.
[3:54:05.940 --> 3:54:15.940]  One of the things that if you talk to our generals, they are desperate for, is a civilian counterpart to our military forces.
[3:54:15.940 --> 3:54:21.940]  Homeland security is enlisting some unlikely new recruits to fight terrorism and help with other emergencies.
[3:54:21.940 --> 3:54:22.940]  The Girl Scouts.
[3:54:22.940 --> 3:54:28.940]  The Department of Homeland Security calling on firefighters to take on a new role in the war on terror.
[3:54:28.940 --> 3:54:33.940]  The idea to be the eyes for the U.S. government when they're inside a home.
[3:54:33.940 --> 3:54:42.940]  To force their unpopular agenda upon the planet, the controllers are racing to complete the construction of their police state control grid.
[3:54:42.940 --> 3:54:47.940]  So number one, they can come in, the federal government can come in and inspect your house and send you the bill.
[3:54:47.940 --> 3:54:51.940]  We're setting up a global warming Gestapo.
[3:54:51.940 --> 3:55:00.940]  The more things spin out of control, the harder the hammer is going to come down by the federal government to keep everyone in control.
[3:55:00.940 --> 3:55:04.940]  If you put all these signs together, it doesn't look good at all.
[3:55:04.940 --> 3:55:08.940]  To the extent we are a democracy, we're sort of a hair breath away from a police state.
[3:55:08.940 --> 3:55:14.940]  Borrowing from tactics used in the past by communist, fascist and other totalitarian regimes.
[3:55:14.940 --> 3:55:20.940]  Every form of classical textbook tyranny is now being implemented in the West.
[3:55:20.940 --> 3:55:23.940]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[3:55:23.940 --> 3:55:25.940]  That's not the whole trailer.
[3:55:25.940 --> 3:55:28.940]  It just went up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[3:55:28.940 --> 3:55:30.940]  The fifth and final trailer for the Republic.
[3:55:30.940 --> 3:55:32.940]  Pre-order it today, folks.
[3:55:32.940 --> 3:55:36.940]  It's shipping out next week on DVD and premiering at prismplanet.tv for members.
[3:55:36.940 --> 3:55:47.940]  You know, I forgot that I was contacted by the directors of these great films I've had on many times about Dan Brown and his book that comes right out with how great the whole Luciferian system is.
[3:55:47.940 --> 3:55:50.940]  How it's the Bible is the secret law symbol.
[3:55:50.940 --> 3:55:54.940]  How the devil is God inverted.
[3:55:54.940 --> 3:55:57.940]  Yin Yang and how it's all good.
[3:55:57.940 --> 3:55:59.940]  They're just coming right out with it.
[3:55:59.940 --> 3:56:03.940]  And look, Chris, we got off into the history of it.
[3:56:03.940 --> 3:56:04.940]  It's such a big subject.
[3:56:04.940 --> 3:56:07.940]  We'll have you back in the next few weeks to just do Dan Brown.
[3:56:07.940 --> 3:56:09.940]  And you guys have written a counter to it.
[3:56:09.940 --> 3:56:15.940]  But just briefly, in a few minutes we've got left, take us out with, you've reviewed it.
[3:56:15.940 --> 3:56:17.940]  Tell us what's really going on with it.
[3:56:17.940 --> 3:56:21.940]  Well, here's how we got in touch with the book.
[3:56:21.940 --> 3:56:29.940]  Actually, a couple of weeks before the book was released, we had gotten a call from ABC's Nightline News.
[3:56:29.940 --> 3:56:37.940]  And they contacted us and they requested a copy of Riddles and Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, DC, which is part two.
[3:56:37.940 --> 3:56:38.940]  And we said, all right, why do you want it?
[3:56:38.940 --> 3:56:46.940]  And they said, well, we want to review it in conjunction with a story that we're doing on Dan Brown's new book, The Law Symbol.
[3:56:46.940 --> 3:56:51.940]  Okay, now we hadn't read the book at that point, but so they're requesting a copy of one of our films in the series.
[3:56:51.940 --> 3:57:07.940]  Then we find an article from the Associated Press where Dan Brown is saying in the interview or the Associated Press is saying that his new book is based in part on an, quote, unfair, anti-masonic video.
[3:57:07.940 --> 3:57:09.940]  Okay, that had been released.
[3:57:09.940 --> 3:57:15.940]  And so this led us to wonder, I mean, is this why Nightline is trying to get a copy of Riddles and Stone?
[3:57:15.940 --> 3:57:27.940]  And why is, was that the unfair anti-masonic video so-called? And of course, we know when we released that that the Freemasons were not happy about it because we're interviewing a lot of their leaders,
[3:57:27.940 --> 3:57:33.940]  but like some of their top leaders and apologists who try to go out and refute these conspiracy theories.
[3:57:33.940 --> 3:57:42.940]  And we're getting stories that Dan Brown was kind of working with these guys and he's trying to present their viewpoint in his book.
[3:57:42.940 --> 3:57:49.940]  He's talking about all of the things that we talk about in the series. He talks about Sir Francis Bacon and the new Atlantis.
[3:57:49.940 --> 3:57:57.940]  He's talking about the architecture of Washington, D.C. and the hermetic symbolism and getting into all of the philosophies that we're...
[3:57:57.940 --> 3:58:04.940]  And by the way, Patriots have been talking about this for a hundred years. Now they're just coming out with all of it going, yeah, it's a big pentagram.
[3:58:04.940 --> 3:58:12.940]  That's all that's in a documentary on History Channel this week. Look, we're going to go ahead and set you up for part two next week if you can do it, Chris Pinto,
[3:58:12.940 --> 3:58:18.940]  because I want to just do Dan Brown and why they're now coming out with it. Are they trying to put the capstone on the pyramid?
[3:58:18.940 --> 3:58:27.940]  It's their time for the revelation of the method. Folks, get the trilogy at infowars.com and the scurriline shopping cart and the new film, Fall of the Republic, coming out.
[3:58:27.940 --> 3:58:30.940]  Mr. Pinto, thank you for spending time with us.
[3:58:30.940 --> 3:58:32.940]  Thank you, Alex.

[3:59:06.940 --> 3:59:12.940]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity for free.
[3:59:12.940 --> 3:59:16.940]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[3:59:16.940 --> 3:59:21.940]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[3:59:21.940 --> 3:59:27.940]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
