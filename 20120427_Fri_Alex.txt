[00:00.000 --> 00:14.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.280 --> 00:42.000]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are
[00:42.000 --> 00:51.360]  live thank you so much for joining us it is Friday the 27th day of April 2012 and we're
[00:51.360 --> 00:58.760]  going to be live here for the next three hours and we're going to have open phones a doctor
[00:58.760 --> 01:02.520]  of chemistry who's been a guest on the nightly news a few times I think once they're on the
[01:02.520 --> 01:07.160]  radio who's running for city council here in Austin is going to be joining us in the last 40
[01:07.160 --> 01:14.640]  minutes of the third hour today her name is Laura Presley it says here on my sheet she's
[01:14.640 --> 01:21.440]  counsel woman Laura Presley that's positive thinking she's running for city council here in
[01:21.440 --> 01:26.640]  Austin Texas I've seen some of the info wars dot com reporter contest entries that are excellent
[01:26.640 --> 01:33.320]  and they say I'll be coming to Austin now and my report they talk about positive thinking but I
[01:33.320 --> 01:37.140]  really don't believe in that system where they say you just say something and it happens you
[01:37.140 --> 01:43.680]  have to say something and then put it into action and then there's a very good chance it will happen
[01:43.680 --> 01:51.320]  especially if you've got right on your side okay big radio transmission obviously lined up for
[01:51.320 --> 01:55.800]  you today you know I'm always intending to do a science section every day because there's so
[01:55.800 --> 02:00.600]  much science news and I get bogged down in the negative information and then there's always a
[02:00.600 --> 02:05.600]  strange news section and I find intriguing just to illustrate how truth is stranger than fiction
[02:05.600 --> 02:12.960]  reality is stranger than any imagination of fiction any pipe dream even hallucinogen base
[02:12.960 --> 02:20.440]  that you can imagine and boy today there was so much weird news that I said to myself I have
[02:20.440 --> 02:26.280]  got to cover news of the weird so at the bottom of this hour I'm gonna spend about five minutes
[02:26.280 --> 02:33.600]  just hitting unbelievably bizarro news here's just one of them hawk snatches supermodels dog
[02:33.600 --> 02:41.520]  from her home and another one it attacks so at least dogs are small the hawks are hungry and I used
[02:41.520 --> 02:47.080]  to always joke with my wife we had a really small Chihuahua that was a rescue Chihuahua named Conan
[02:47.080 --> 02:51.320]  and he got out one day and the neighbor wanted to save him and chased him down the road into the
[02:51.320 --> 02:55.360]  street he got run over but chose how the road to hell is paved with good intentions he was running
[02:55.360 --> 02:59.440]  away from her and she went down her little street to the major highway and ran him out in the highway
[02:59.440 --> 03:05.360]  but side issue I would always joke that Conan could be picked up by an owl or a hawk because
[03:05.360 --> 03:09.160]  I've read about that really happening well here it is there's one of the stories we'll be covering
[03:09.160 --> 03:14.840]  and yes ladies and gentlemen I don't normally cover fluff stories but we need occasionally to
[03:14.840 --> 03:19.720]  you know divert off into something interesting to get the mind stimulated I think that about
[03:19.720 --> 03:25.720]  myself is why I'm saying that because we've also got to cover some of the positive things going on
[03:25.720 --> 03:32.200]  in the world and I've asked my crew to create on prison planet and an and info wars good news
[03:32.200 --> 03:40.440]  section news of the weird I want to add a news of the weird and a good news section to both of
[03:40.440 --> 03:45.200]  the sites and maybe there'll be special sections down at the bottom that you know they don't even
[03:45.200 --> 03:51.000]  look like the other sections or maybe links to pages where that's going on because we've to
[03:51.000 --> 03:59.520]  know evil we've got to recognize what good is now speaking of evil and good Labor Department
[03:59.520 --> 04:06.880]  withdrawals child labor law rule after massive public attention via the Drudge report of the
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.720]  Daily Caller story about that and and and the Labor Department says for now we won't implement
[04:12.720 --> 04:19.080]  the rule until Obama gets reelected and of course in Mitt Romney's basically an Obama clone I mean
[04:19.080 --> 04:25.840]  exact same policies on record you know a tree can tell you it grows oranges but if it grows you
[04:25.840 --> 04:31.840]  know rotten possums then you know it's not really an orange tree and that's like Romney says he's
[04:31.840 --> 04:39.320]  gonna do all these good things but history in producing nice oranges or apples it's producing
[04:39.320 --> 04:50.080]  feted scruffulous bulbous stink balls if you look gun control open borders carbon taxes abortion
[04:50.080 --> 04:56.760]  don't need to keep going here banker run the big news is coming up though executive order to ban
[04:56.760 --> 05:05.840]  guns wait to hear about that when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the

[09:23.680 --> 09:28.920]  in austin and i covered this yesterday kvue even reported i'm very excited you tease
[09:28.920 --> 09:35.840]  taking fluoride out of the water because their own chemistry department said yeah the majority
[09:35.840 --> 09:39.720]  of government side to say it's causing cancer and brain damage and it's terrible it actually
[09:39.720 --> 09:51.520]  attacks blacks and women a lot more than anglo or asian men and this is another big victory
[09:51.520 --> 09:56.320]  you've got big towns and cities all over the world now removing it so this is a major victory
[09:56.320 --> 10:02.320]  point they're pulling between all a out of most of the plastics all over the place people
[10:02.320 --> 10:07.200]  are demanding real organic foods very exciting she's going to be in studio whether she's
[10:07.200 --> 10:17.720]  running for city council here in austin texas shall we look forward to that that said we've
[10:17.720 --> 10:27.120]  got some bad news here city wants executive order to ban concealed carry in tamba during
[10:27.120 --> 10:34.800]  rnc just period you're concealed carry in tampa will be banned they're asking the governor
[10:34.800 --> 10:41.560]  for an executive order now let me explain where executive orders come from the congress
[10:41.560 --> 10:46.280]  by law in the first congress is actually the second congress has had a continental congress
[10:46.280 --> 10:51.440]  before that they had a continental president actually before washington but the point is
[10:51.440 --> 10:59.960]  so technically is the second president at the first of the republic what 1789 you go
[10:59.960 --> 11:07.480]  back to the history books the point is that all of this is extremely extremely important
[11:07.480 --> 11:14.880]  to understand that it was the allotment for the president's house in new york it wasn't
[11:14.880 --> 11:20.960]  in the middle of the woods in virginia yet on the petomic that washington was never in
[11:20.960 --> 11:26.700]  the white house they got built after he already left office but my point here is i always
[11:26.700 --> 11:33.240]  digress into factoids is that executive orders were the amount of money congress gave the
[11:33.240 --> 11:40.160]  president and he could do executive orders on who he wanted to hire in the white house
[11:40.160 --> 11:47.560]  and the first executive orders are for plates and cutlery and glasses for state dinners
[11:47.560 --> 11:56.120]  in new york at the president's lodges which were later partially destroyed when the british
[11:56.120 --> 12:02.000]  pulled in with ships later and blew it up but that's a side issue that was after of
[12:02.000 --> 12:09.560]  course he left office was already dead that was in the war of 1812 but i digress yet again
[12:09.560 --> 12:16.760]  executive orders were mrs. washington wants these colored drapes the president has six
[12:16.760 --> 12:24.920]  assistants the secretary of state's office in the government building needs desk and
[12:24.920 --> 12:29.040]  five chairs i mean you can go read them they're in the library of congress it's online you
[12:29.040 --> 12:33.760]  can read hundreds of washington letters you can read his first executive orders right
[12:33.760 --> 12:40.840]  through they're into the 13 thousands almost the 14 thousands now and the first multi thousand
[12:40.840 --> 12:49.520]  were all presidents up until the 50s deciding oh we don't want this cutlery anymore we want
[12:49.520 --> 12:57.840]  some new stuff or the floor is collapsing in the east room executive order we ask congress
[12:57.840 --> 13:05.120]  for apportionment to fix the white house i mean if they can just say executive order
[13:05.120 --> 13:11.000]  we attack libya even though congress says no executive order obama shuts down power plants
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.400]  not owned by g and your power prices roughly double in many areas they're more than doubling
[13:15.400 --> 13:22.320]  here in austin they admit so they could pay g and others more money just open criminality
[13:22.320 --> 13:28.280]  bagala one of clinton's had people famously said the new york times stroke of the pen law
[13:28.280 --> 13:35.480]  the land kind of cool yeah hitler by the time he was full fewer by 1940 it took him about
[13:35.480 --> 13:41.120]  seven years to really become a full dictator it was i'm the furor forget chancellor forget
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.240]  president they had a upper and lower you know chancellor and a president he's just called
[13:45.240 --> 13:52.760]  a furor baby which means leader Stalin you know he still had a kind of a fake doom on
[13:52.760 --> 13:56.600]  some yeah oh yeah you guys vote how i want sure kind of like roman senators for a long
[13:56.600 --> 14:08.360]  time after julia cesar in what 40 something bc the senate was what do they call it vestigial
[14:08.360 --> 14:23.120]  ceremonial a figurehead a relic a rubber stamp a echo chamber
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.440]  and so now the nra's reporting that obama's talking about banning importation and banning
[14:29.440 --> 14:33.920]  simiano via an executive or the washington times report on that months ago the nra's
[14:33.920 --> 14:39.800]  pretty milked out so they got the intel probably worse that he's going to use executive orders
[14:39.800 --> 14:44.400]  and why not last year we broke the news was given to me by local gun dealers we broke
[14:44.400 --> 14:51.520]  it that the atm is giving rules kind of like all the labor department has a rule that your
[14:51.520 --> 14:59.440]  child can't do any farm chores oh there's a rule that if you sell more than two rivals
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.040]  you're going to put an atm suspicious report on somebody well there's already an instant
[15:04.040 --> 15:08.640]  check through the fbi when you're buying those one or two or ten rifles or handguns but anything
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.800]  semi auto you'll call us and file a report so they have an excuse to start investigating
[15:13.800 --> 15:18.960]  claiming there was a report so they can also fake statistics and claim all these suspicious
[15:18.960 --> 15:23.800]  reports are coming in and they told the gun dealer said we've never done this before it's
[15:23.800 --> 15:28.360]  always law and they said do what you say we're going to arrest you and see that's about setting
[15:28.360 --> 15:33.760]  the precedent that when they say jump you say how high I've got some other big news
[15:33.760 --> 15:43.040]  to him about to mention but on the executive order now they're asking the governor to ban
[15:43.040 --> 15:49.520]  all of the concealed carry permits of the state when you come to the city limits of
[15:49.520 --> 15:56.280]  Tampa for the RNC well the governor can't do that the governor can only do executive
[15:56.280 --> 16:01.800]  orders within the power of his office you can go read the state law of Florida it's
[16:01.800 --> 16:08.680]  the same as the federal law yes if the president already has Congress and a law and it's within
[16:08.680 --> 16:14.360]  the executive purview which they've expanded and expanded he can within that purview have
[16:14.360 --> 16:22.440]  an executive order once a president's been given the war power once they've declared
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.160]  war he becomes the commander in chief and now he can give orders as the commander in
[16:27.160 --> 16:31.160]  chief but not unless they've declared war that's why they never declare war he just
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.960]  operates as that without it that's called dictatorship but the office has been turned
[16:35.960 --> 16:41.720]  into a dictatorship now he admits oh yeah yeah I can't wait till my second term because
[16:41.720 --> 16:47.320]  I'm completely ignoring Congress and the question is will Congress at that point just sit there
[16:47.320 --> 16:50.960]  on their back I mean how many constitutional law scholars have I had on I want to get Bruce
[16:50.960 --> 16:55.920]  Fine back on about this by the way next week just executive orders in general one of the
[16:55.920 --> 17:03.440]  top advisors to Congress constitutional lawyer Ron Paul's chief of policy chief policy advisor
[17:03.440 --> 17:09.600]  by the way Ron Paul was in town last night there was over 4,000 people there and Info Wars was
[17:09.600 --> 17:16.800]  the only media that we know of to get one question one question because he was behind he had to leave
[17:16.800 --> 17:21.360]  Richard Reeves got one question in it dealt with false flags Ron Paul also spoke on false
[17:21.360 --> 17:26.960]  flags in his speech we're going to air that coming up in the middle of the next hour Ron Paul
[17:27.760 --> 17:37.680]  excerpt of his speech and we're going to on top of that also have the question that Richard Reeves
[17:37.680 --> 17:42.800]  was able to get him get to Congress from Ron Paul that's coming up by the way to night on the
[17:42.800 --> 17:48.960]  nightly news Aaron Dykes is doing it and there's an hour plus speech I gave that folks think was
[17:48.960 --> 17:53.600]  even better than Dallas in Orlando and has had a lot of video and documents and it's pretty much
[17:53.600 --> 17:58.720]  almost a film of when I was visiting big 810 a.m. we're number one by the way on the radio up against
[17:58.720 --> 18:05.280]  Rush Limbaugh so that's going to air tonight after the news we were going to try to rush and
[18:07.520 --> 18:12.320]  get the whole Ron Paul speech up on the nightly news tonight but I'd rather add documentation
[18:12.320 --> 18:16.320]  to everything he's saying because everybody can put Ron Paul speeches up and they're probably
[18:16.320 --> 18:20.640]  already being uploaded that's fine that's great we're going to air it next Monday or Tuesday on
[18:20.640 --> 18:26.240]  the nightly news with articles and documents and clips backing up everything he's saying I like to
[18:26.240 --> 18:33.440]  do that there'll be some excerpts tonight but but on the news but the full speech the questions the
[18:33.440 --> 18:41.440]  crowd all of a time lapse photography everything a big extravagance on Monday or Tuesday I would
[18:41.440 --> 18:44.160]  be able to
[18:49.440 --> 18:53.440]  again air it tonight if our crew wasn't so skeleton that's why we're trying to hire more
[18:53.440 --> 18:59.680]  video editors and other camera person and reporters that takes money that's why I promote

[24:18.880 --> 24:29.440]  back past back in 1913 they rushed it through the house yesterday in the evening syspa let congress
[24:29.440 --> 24:34.320]  know you will not let them trash the fourth amendment and they've got inventors of the
[24:34.320 --> 24:40.560]  internet coming out and no i don't mean al gore they've got top scientists government people
[24:40.560 --> 24:47.920]  former head of cyber security all out scientists writing letters to congress saying this is the
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.480]  fourth amendment this surveils everything in lifetime they've already been doing it is the
[24:52.480 --> 24:57.920]  point and they say that we've already been doing it like that's okay it's like jeffrey domers like
[24:57.920 --> 25:03.360]  well i just you you just caught me grabbing another 15 year old off the street i mean i did it to 10
[25:03.360 --> 25:09.600]  others well somehow there's this idea that we've already been illegally because it is illegal
[25:09.600 --> 25:14.240]  spying on you without warrants and now we just want to put it into law and we want to put it
[25:14.240 --> 25:18.400]  into law we can torture people we want to put it into law we can take your bank account without
[25:18.400 --> 25:24.320]  due process and take your passport i mean it's all happening because they're sitting on top
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.440]  over a thousand trillion in derivatives and they know it can't ever be paid back they know you don't
[25:29.440 --> 25:37.600]  owe it they know it's the bankers and they created on purpose to sign us on to it you notice europe
[25:37.600 --> 25:43.520]  raised taxes cut benefits is now in a full board depression i got stacks of news on it and the bankers
[25:43.520 --> 25:50.400]  are like oopsie that's exactly what they wanted to do you don't think they don't know when they
[25:50.400 --> 25:54.240]  pass carbon taxes last year in california and are now implementing over the next three years 20
[25:54.240 --> 26:01.360]  plus percent was like 22 carbon taxes and everyone is just fleeing as fast as they can it's a gorgeous
[26:01.360 --> 26:09.520]  great state beautiful i love central and northern i like san diego you know down in the south beautiful
[26:09.520 --> 26:16.960]  it's it's it's like soviet russia or something they're giving kids shots without parental consent
[26:16.960 --> 26:22.080]  11 year olds they're taking 11 year olds for abortions and they tell parents shut up
[26:24.720 --> 26:28.880]  in california is the model for the country that's why it's such good news they may the people there
[26:28.880 --> 26:35.680]  demand labeling of gmo because it has been the bellwether we can reverse that thanks for the work
[26:35.680 --> 26:45.920]  of dr mercola and others but my point is syspa is so much worse than even sopa and it makes my head
[26:45.920 --> 26:53.520]  spin and well we've gone over it and over it i mean it did so many horrible things it it is
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.720]  unspeakable once again congress has ignored the will of the people yeah the polls are over 90
[26:58.720 --> 27:02.320]  percent against it for weeks it has been obvious that millions of americans are steadfastly opposed
[27:02.320 --> 27:07.280]  to syspa the so-called cyber security legislation passed by the house last night that will allow
[27:07.280 --> 27:11.440]  the government to surveil americans and deny them fourth amendment protection while on the internet
[27:11.440 --> 27:16.400]  which is everything now see they get you addicted then they take it away congressional leaders and
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.040]  members have come up with all kinds of lame excuses in order to push the bill through including the
[27:21.040 --> 27:28.000]  absurd claim made by the house majority leader that syspa will create jobs yeah it it it makes everybody
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.440]  at least the last version i read a week ago they're always changing it and we got to look
[27:35.440 --> 27:42.000]  into this it it makes anybody in it who has over a hundred customers get a federal certification
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.360]  and and the certification means you'll constantly be upgraded go to training and learn how to put
[27:47.360 --> 27:51.280]  equipment and snooper hubs into everything and then they'll just come and raid whole network
[27:51.280 --> 27:57.040]  saying you don't have the systems in place you're like oh that won't happen really in 1996 they had
[27:57.040 --> 28:03.120]  the telecommunications act saying under law the other regulations a blank check law that you had to
[28:03.120 --> 28:09.520]  have satellite tracker triangulation via cell towers down to three feet with cell phones gps
[28:09.520 --> 28:18.080]  triangulator the phone itself is not gps is gps triangulator and it had to be able to be accessed
[28:18.080 --> 28:25.440]  remotely and turned on even when off to where you can't tell to listen to you and now all the tech
[28:25.440 --> 28:32.320]  has it the cia director admits it the digital cable boxes the computers everything and they admit it
[28:34.320 --> 28:39.840]  the smart boxes aren't just smart meters they're admittedly designed to dial in and grab all your
[28:39.840 --> 28:46.880]  wireless transmissions the the uh i was in the washington post last year the uh they're going to
[28:46.880 --> 28:53.200]  start having wireless service on top of the postal service vehicles but it'll double as a snooper
[28:53.200 --> 28:59.760]  grabbing all the data in this bill they're saying they can pass around your your your your
[28:59.760 --> 29:06.560]  medical stuff your insurance your everything it says that that they can spy on congress
[29:06.560 --> 29:11.840]  and give their tax returns to any agency they want and listen to them that's in the bill
[29:12.400 --> 29:18.880]  that was it i mean it's so it's the bureaucracy run by foreign banks engage in a coup d'etat
[29:18.880 --> 29:24.000]  and the average congressperson is blackmailed or so corrupt they don't care those that do
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.360]  are the minority and uh here it is get the article by curt we can still beat it in the senate
[29:30.240 --> 29:35.120]  and i know rand paul's gonna try to block it but they even break senate rules to try to stop him
[29:35.120 --> 29:40.720]  from blocking it get it out it's at info wars dot com syspa let congress know you will not let
[29:40.720 --> 29:45.760]  them trash the fourth amendment at least this stuff's getting out in the open though now at least

[34:24.240 --> 34:29.520]  in front of us including news of the weird that's coming up here in just a moment there is some
[34:29.520 --> 34:34.240]  good news that i mentioned at the very start labor department withdrawals farm child labor rule
[34:34.240 --> 34:40.000]  rule after daily caller drudge report dot com and also info wars dot com made it go viral
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.160]  you made it go viral but they're saying they're going to suspend the rule for now
[34:44.720 --> 34:50.960]  their rule and that brings me back into our top story at info wars dot com before i get to
[34:50.960 --> 34:58.080]  news of the weird to show the point that we are definitely seeing the twilight zoning of the planet
[34:58.080 --> 35:07.840]  earth city wants executive order to ban concealed carry in template during rnc and already went
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.560]  over at the start of the show but if you just tuned in this is very important the first executive
[35:12.560 --> 35:18.320]  orders were for the linen and plates for mrs washington with the money congress gave them to
[35:18.320 --> 35:24.400]  set up the presidential facility and to have heads of state and others and ambassadors in for dinner
[35:24.400 --> 35:32.800]  and the reason we have a congress and the reason we have state legislatures is because they make
[35:32.800 --> 35:37.600]  the laws and there's a check in balance of the courts saying whether it's constitutional or not
[35:38.320 --> 35:44.160]  and then you have the president or the governor that executes the will of the legislature which
[35:44.160 --> 35:49.360]  is the will of the people the will of the congress that is the will of the people in the constitution
[35:49.360 --> 35:55.760]  and we form this government we form this union we the people create this system and if it ever
[35:55.760 --> 36:02.480]  becomes destructive of our liberties it is not just our right it is our duty to overthrow it
[36:03.520 --> 36:08.800]  that's called treason and they arrested the hitari militia for talking about that is directly
[36:08.800 --> 36:13.040]  out of the declaration of independence so if you want to arrest that go ahead and
[36:13.600 --> 36:16.880]  lock up of course they've had news and in the philadelphia daily news
[36:16.880 --> 36:22.240]  said and the bbc had the headline too is the declaration of independence illegal
[36:22.800 --> 36:26.960]  and they had the feds and people in there and lawyers saying yeah it's terrorism
[36:28.080 --> 36:33.360]  you're saying if a government's oppressive you got a right to overthrow it man that's terrorism
[36:33.360 --> 36:38.320]  and now you notice obama said last week war on terror is over al qaeda is our friend it means the
[36:38.320 --> 36:44.560]  banker's friend overthrowing all these countries but the tsa is in boston and houston and dallas
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.800]  i'm just mentioning around where i live and i heard they're coming to austin just like they
[36:48.800 --> 36:56.400]  had the army a month ago out at the kite festival i almost pulled in the kite festival i'm driving
[36:56.400 --> 37:01.120]  along with david mustain my wife and his wife and we're like oh there's the kite festival
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.280]  isn't it you want to go there okay we may not have time and little did i know about i pulled over
[37:05.280 --> 37:13.200]  there was the national guard searching people who it's fun isn't it i don't have to travel anymore
[37:13.200 --> 37:18.560]  to drive up to a checkpoint or you know it's a lot of fun isn't it black boxes in the car
[37:18.560 --> 37:22.880]  dragging his face scanning cameras everywhere government caught shipping narcotics in almost
[37:22.880 --> 37:30.800]  every day and meanwhile you got an executive order isn't that just precious
[37:35.040 --> 37:42.320]  just have an executive order isn't that just special isn't that just cute isn't that
[37:42.320 --> 37:51.440]  just wonderful and sweet to have an executive order in the new america
[37:57.520 --> 38:02.400]  an executive order not by the president to shut down power plants that aren't paying money and
[38:02.400 --> 38:08.000]  aren't part of their mafia system no no not the executive orders to launch wars in libya
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.040]  and even when congress says they don't have approval it's totally illegal or executive
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.600]  orders or just go become the head of the un security council violating article one section
[38:17.600 --> 38:21.680]  nine totally illegal you know he didn't even need executive orders now he just says i'm writing a
[38:21.680 --> 38:30.240]  letter saying the un gave me authority and it just gets worse and worse each new president that gets
[38:30.240 --> 38:39.920]  in no now we have tampa going to the governor and saying we want you to ban
[38:43.040 --> 38:47.200]  the hundreds of thousands of people in the state of florida that have a concealed carry
[38:47.920 --> 38:51.200]  and we want you to ban them from being inside tampa with their firearms
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.920]  now there's a big problem there you know how they create a concealed carry see they can't legally
[38:57.920 --> 39:00.800]  and lawfully they've got some city laws that do this but they're unconstitutional that's
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.800]  why they're getting overturned tell you that you can't carry a shotgun or handgun openly
[39:07.600 --> 39:13.200]  because in ancient times everyone could carry a weapon openly if they were a free man
[39:14.320 --> 39:18.720]  if you weren't a slave you know back in ancient europe where the serfs were basically slaves
[39:18.720 --> 39:22.000]  weren't any black slaves they were just white slaves never hear about that in the media though
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.760]  because that kind of kills the whole race war thing if people learned that most whites that
[39:25.760 --> 39:29.760]  came to this country were indentured servants signed on for seven to ten years slave ten years
[39:31.520 --> 39:35.760]  many cases were even worse off than the black slaves look it up because they weren't even
[39:35.760 --> 39:43.200]  property they were just chattel but the issue here is that
[39:43.200 --> 39:56.480]  you could always have armaments open because a free man who was not a criminal had their arms
[39:56.480 --> 40:01.760]  open swords muskets wherever the case was what's always been illegal under common law
[40:01.760 --> 40:09.680]  is concealed weapons under the laws of chivalry all of it a dagger later a musket a grenade a
[40:09.680 --> 40:25.520]  granado you do not conceal you never conceal a weapon so that's how they said we'll give you a
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.480]  permit to have a gun to create the perception that you've got to have a permit to have a gun
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.360]  you only got to have a permit because it's illegal a permit a license is an authorization a letter of
[40:35.360 --> 40:41.680]  mark to do something that is illegal that's why when they start licensing travel or licensing
[40:41.680 --> 40:46.240]  having a passport or licensing owning a home or having a business they've made it illegal and they
[40:46.240 --> 40:53.600]  can revoke it this is ancient common law they're overthrowing and so that's why one of the great
[40:53.600 --> 41:00.480]  greatest modern civil rights human rights movements out there unenable unalienable god
[41:00.480 --> 41:06.560]  given right exercises people carrying ak-47s m16s you know that are semi-auto handguns rifles
[41:06.560 --> 41:12.560]  shotguns openly i remember it more than a decade ago the new black panther party marched around
[41:12.560 --> 41:16.880]  houston with loaded shotguns and even though i didn't agree with their thing of get whitey i said i
[41:16.880 --> 41:22.080]  admired their courage and they actually created the precedent for conservative and libertarian
[41:22.080 --> 41:32.480]  and patriot groups of all races and colors to start carrying ar-15s mac 90s m1 grands range rifles
[41:32.480 --> 41:38.560]  handguns in public and at first the police would try to arrest people they lose the lawsuits then
[41:38.560 --> 41:43.120]  they try to intimidate people and now police all over the country are standing down and understand
[41:43.120 --> 41:46.800]  it and the media doesn't know how to deal with it because they've been running sitcoms and dramas
[41:46.800 --> 41:51.280]  where they show the image of all guns being illegal all the sitcoms and dramas and cop shows are
[41:51.280 --> 41:58.240]  based in new york you know in these tv shows they pull them over they go you got a gun that's 10 years
[41:58.240 --> 42:03.360]  in jail and then when some carpet cleaner is in your house and sees a case of guns they run out
[42:03.360 --> 42:07.360]  and call the police you're like why you call the police guns guns i'm like you're not from texas
[42:07.360 --> 42:14.640]  are you listen mr don't you know they see a gun on a cop they feel good they see one of
[42:14.640 --> 42:22.640]  a fellow slave it's like because they're a tv head so we're openly with our guns out in public
[42:22.640 --> 42:31.040]  it's totally freaking the system out totally they don't know what to do anymore with this
[42:33.760 --> 42:35.680]  so all of that is now unfolding
[42:38.400 --> 42:42.880]  and so they're coming in and saying they want to revoke a privilege now it's a law
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.120]  that you can have this concealed carry in florida i remember when they introduced it more than a
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.400]  decade ago their crime went down 24% within one year i remember that was in the big uh
[42:52.400 --> 42:59.760]  florida national papers 20 20 plus percent 24 25 i think it was 24 you can look it up but let's see
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.080]  if they get away with this just saying well or or they're now declaring that the secret services
[43:04.080 --> 43:12.480]  hold towns national security events where oh the feds say you can't do this
[43:14.400 --> 43:20.240]  because i saw some new articles where the feds are trying to pass a national law against talking
[43:20.240 --> 43:26.480]  on cell phones period even if it's hands-free which studies show is very safe texting is five times
[43:26.480 --> 43:33.840]  more dangerous than even talking on your phone handheld five times and let me tell you it is an
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.080]  epidemic something asked me not about that it's reckless driving don't need a law cop sees you
[43:38.080 --> 43:42.800]  recklessly driving on your cell phone sees you doing it you should go to jail for reckless driving
[43:43.760 --> 43:51.040]  isn't that a felony last time i checked see the old law the old common law the constant it's got it
[43:51.040 --> 44:00.800]  all and what's the cop what's the cop doing what is the police officer doing he is hired by the
[44:00.800 --> 44:06.960]  state that's by the legislature and empowered under citizens arrest powers to then be trained
[44:06.960 --> 44:10.960]  the public made the decision to give citizens arrest powers to this person already has them
[44:10.960 --> 44:18.320]  and especially train them that's where police came from see but they're trying to take
[44:18.320 --> 44:28.080]  your citizens arrest power away and they're telling police oh let's write new laws that just go after
[44:28.080 --> 44:33.200]  everybody not about what they actually do but what they do is a pre-crime and make everyone guilty
[44:33.200 --> 44:38.960]  and then have the cell phones for value that are you moving at a speed down the road do we know
[44:38.960 --> 44:48.560]  that you're using the phone then you get automatic tickets that is the next phase in all of this
[44:53.760 --> 45:00.800]  okay continuing here this is a big deal to understand the history of this city wants executive order
[45:00.800 --> 45:06.160]  to ban concealed carry and Tampa during r and c turning a right into a privilege that can be revoked
[45:06.160 --> 45:12.320]  by bureaucrats Tampa city council wants governor rick scott to pass an executive order banning
[45:12.320 --> 45:17.200]  concealed carry to coincide with protests republican national convention later this year
[45:17.200 --> 45:22.320]  yeah some of the reports are they're asking for a statewide man not just uh they're in Tampa i gotta
[45:22.320 --> 45:28.720]  love that because because the r and c is coming the thousands of protesters expected at the
[45:28.720 --> 45:34.480]  democratic republican national conventions can come armed with a lot more than signs and slogans
[45:34.480 --> 45:40.800]  state law in florida and north carolina allows concealed weapons including guns oh my gosh reports
[45:40.800 --> 45:49.440]  the Sacramento b including guns they have a gun the Tampa city council wants scott to issue
[45:49.440 --> 45:54.880]  an executive order preventing people with concealed weapons permits from carrying guns
[45:54.880 --> 45:59.760]  the executive order is required because according to Florida law local officials not servants are
[45:59.760 --> 46:06.320]  prohibited from preemptive and preemptive actions against state gun statutes yeah of course they've
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.560]  had cities try to do it but you can't this move represents you another effort to turn a right
[46:10.560 --> 46:14.400]  into a privilege and creates the pretext that fundamental liberties can be revoked by local
[46:14.400 --> 46:20.560]  bureaucrats when the mood takes them yeah the Dallas morning news and and the observer Dallas
[46:20.560 --> 46:32.400]  observer are reporting for 110 dollars for five days the school book um depository building
[46:33.360 --> 46:38.160]  that's a propaganda center for the lie that one guy killed jfk with 90 plus percent of
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.960]  americans and major polls don't believe it anyone who doesn't believe the official story is not
[46:42.960 --> 46:48.400]  allowed in the daily plaza the city park is being leased for 110 dollars for five days so the
[46:48.400 --> 46:53.600]  international media they admit in the news they say so that the kooks can't be in front of the
[46:53.600 --> 47:01.520]  media the 90 plus percent of the citizens again this is the new no free speech zone system so i'll
[47:01.520 --> 47:05.120]  be there not this don't remember the 50th coming up in over a year i'll be there i'm calling for
[47:05.120 --> 47:09.360]  tens of thousands to be there for the first amendment this will backfire on them but they're
[47:09.360 --> 47:15.760]  really trying all of this now we're going to go to break and come back with your calls but let me
[47:15.760 --> 47:23.200]  get into news of the bizarro now i'm gonna start doing this every single day here's a report out of

[47:42.240 --> 47:46.160]  out there because nobody defends themselves the animals aren't scared of the humans the humans
[47:46.160 --> 47:49.200]  are scared of the animals kind of like your government supposed to be afraid of you not
[47:49.200 --> 47:52.480]  the other way around there is liberty where the government is afraid of the people there is tyranny
[47:52.480 --> 47:57.200]  where the people are afraid of the government let me continue daily mail giant cannibal shrimp
[47:57.200 --> 48:02.400]  more than a foot long invade waters off gulf coast and they believe it's because natural barriers
[48:02.400 --> 48:06.720]  and other predators have been killed by the core exit in the leak for the first time a big increase

[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:10.080]  we've been standing at the circle in glens falls we've passed out over 13 000 copies of your dvds
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:16.560]  alex we've gone to our local tv public access we've got your dvd showing printer every single
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:23.760]  evening we've got your dvds in containers and a lot of businesses and i'm challenging your listeners
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:32.400]  to have your listening audience double in the next two months you know that's a good idea i think
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:38.800]  info wars puts out the most hardcore message not perfect but it's hardcore to wake people up and look
[1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:43.440]  at how many people know about the new world order now or the federal reserve we've come a long way
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:48.960]  and now people are really ready to be awakened some folks are like oh things are still bad you know
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:53.280]  they ought to wake up on their own no no no now's the time that's why they're trying to come in and
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:58.320]  censor the web now that's why they're they've passed syspa in the house the globalists are
[1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:03.440]  taking the velvet glove off because they know we're waking up i've been at this for a long time i'm
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:08.160]  a vietnam vet and i've got our oldest daughter's been in a wheelchair thanks to age and orange so
[1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:15.760]  i'm motivated every single day but i like you say i have never seen people more open and the time
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:21.520]  is ripe and all i'm doing is saying alex your people people you need to get off your lazy
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:26.960]  dust i know a lot of you people are doing a lot but by goodness if each one of you's just burn
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:34.000]  10 copies of alex's tapes and you gave it to somebody my god it'd be 10 listen i want to
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.560]  i want to tell you right now i totally agree with you i feel like i'm not doing enough or when i
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:44.000]  cover some funny story i get mad later saying i should have been more serious or you know when
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.480]  i play a reporter contest with a girl shooting a machine gun you know later i think man this stuff
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:54.000]  so hardcore i need to be more serious but i think at a certain level it's good that i'm just human
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:59.600]  you're just human and we have a mix of things because because a we've got to be hardcore but
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:04.080]  at the same time we've got to cover some other issues as well or it just becomes too depressing
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:08.560]  but we've also got to focus on the positive victories we've had but yeah what are people
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:13.920]  thinking i get calls and emails and see comments every day thanking me and that's great but folks
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:21.840]  i'm not i'm here to get you moving the power is in you the people and i cannot tell you what what
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:26.960]  uh people like you out there have been able to do over the years uh what type of response have you
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:33.280]  seen after your years of work fantastic alex we when we first started standing at the circle three
[1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:38.000]  years ago people were giving us the finger and all kinds of stuff but now they're tooting horns
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.720]  or we got people stopping by regularly to get the we call it the flavor of the week it's the
[1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:48.640]  different titles you've got and i'm telling you it is it's exciting and i think that's why people
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:53.520]  might get depressed you're on the defensive all the time get on the offensive and find out how
[1:03:53.520 --> 1:04:00.160]  much fun it is we've got your info war signs popping up all over the sides of barns and uh
[1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:04.880]  tree trunks you you go around there once stay there stay there this is too important i don't
[1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:09.360]  want to interrupt you i want to come back tell folks about your case where you're at what you've
[1:04:09.360 --> 1:04:15.520]  done as a blueprint for victory but that's it i always explain this there's fight or flight
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:19.920]  i'm not going to run because it doesn't feel good in my gut i'm going to fight
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:25.440]  and people that feel depressed it's because just sitting at home polishing your guns up getting
[1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:32.800]  ready to blast the first federale or un blue top that comes around that's not fulfilling sure you've
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:37.600]  got to get ready to defend yourself that's part of your plan but 90 percent of it has got to be
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:43.520]  about offense offense offense offense we got to go straight at them stay there we're going to come
[1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:48.800]  back to dave let him finish up and and and recap everything without me stuttering and interrupting
[1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:53.200]  and then we're going to get as i stutter because i'm just so just ready to go i mean i want to
[1:04:53.200 --> 1:04:58.320]  stomp some globalists in the info war and then we'll go to gordon rick ed charlie and others

[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:30.320]  but governor can declare a civil emergency unless the legislature can comes in and overrides him
[1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:34.880]  that's how most state constitutions are but if he power grabs too much he's in trouble that's
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:39.600]  like rick perry lying and saying executive order you've got to take the Gardasil shot that caused
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:44.880]  nine hundred dollars for the three shots upwards of three hundred dollars or more per shot they're

[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:23.840]  into info wars and i had thought internally this was going to happen they're already seen a lot of
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:30.320]  info war signs and and people and things over the years and calls to talk radio but now it's like
[1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:36.160]  boom and of course years ago i went to ut and spoke to with no promotion 1200 people they turned
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:41.520]  away reportedly around a thousand there's ron paul speaking to four thousand i bet in fact i'm
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:46.080]  going to talk to a student group later in the year i bet if i announced a month out i could get 10
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:50.880]  thousand people at ut what what do you think see i haven't even done stunts like that to show people
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:57.600]  the power of info wars easily let's you know what guys put that get a student group to sponsor us i

[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:12.640]  of ron paul right at full we'll uh we'll put 10 000 in there i mean like five years ago the uh
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:16.480]  1200 they turned away a thousand i didn't even promote it they're like hey brave new books

[1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:27.840]  just invited them down to speak with me okay enough about that the point is is that it's time to
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:36.400]  exercise our power your power give us a report dave you're saying you're a vietnam veteran
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:40.320]  and you said your daughter's in a wheelchair thanks to age and orange and i like how the fact
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:45.120]  that you're not taking that laying down you're exposing it to save other people from the gmo
[1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:49.040]  the shots all of it tell people in the next three four minutes you've got the floor about
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:53.440]  yourself and what you've done because what you were telling me earlier is a roadmap to victory
[1:13:55.120 --> 1:13:59.920]  well the thing is alexa it just takes one person it takes yourself it takes a person just be
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:06.320]  motivated just have enough love for your country a love for this this great nation a love for your
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:12.480]  liberty your freedom and and go on the offensive this this is not the time to be embarrassed about
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:17.760]  talking to a stranger and so we've just kind of a group of us have gathered and and like i said
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:23.920]  we've passed out over 13 000 of your dvds we've got info wars signs showing up all over the
[1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:31.200]  the area we recycle these uh long signs that politicians have we grab them up and the the
[1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:37.040]  elections over and we recycle when we put a different message on them like uh info wars.com
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:43.120]  we go to the uh like a office supply store we get stamps and uh it's amazing the number of
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:49.920]  things you could find to put info wars.com on whether it's a frn or uh uh you know disc you
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:56.720]  know envelope but we just are going on the offensive and it's so much fun and if if you're
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:02.800]  homebound develop an email list we have close to 500 names now on our email list and it's being
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:07.200]  picked up and it's even going international and matter of fact one of the the story yesterday
[1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:13.520]  that you had about the russian troops that went out on our emails or we call it so all i'm doing
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:18.240]  is is saying folks come on we don't have a lot of time and i know if we put a little bit of effort
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:24.400]  into this we could have alex's program his his listenership double within the next month or two
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:29.360]  and uh i guess i guess that's all i'm trying to say alex it's it's a call to action we ain't
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:35.040]  we ain't got a lot of time and again i i was personally involved with with the agent orange
[1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:40.880]  cover up the class action lawsuit and it just broke my heart when we found that the chemical
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:47.520]  companies provided us letters that they had sent to the government saying do not use agent orange
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:53.440]  it will cause mutation and they still went ahead and used listen my uncle on both sides of their
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:58.960]  family and my family their family no history abert effects no history of problems comes back for
[1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:04.800]  me in a helicopter pilot in vietnam flying through that stuff and all the hell he saw their first

[1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:26.640]  happened to a bunch of people he knew as well as in the and and monsanto knew what they were doing
[1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:30.800]  and that's the thing that's like bayer knew for 11 years they were shipping out factor eight with

[1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:48.080]  it's it's uh it's uh funny to them and we don't i think it's funny we're what we're gonna do to the
[1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:52.960]  new world order because let me tell you something folks they're launching a giant offensive against
[1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:59.520]  us for censorship secret arrest shutting down the farms because they're scared it's time to stop

[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:23.760]  we got to defend ourselves when they come for us okay when they shut the economy off and let us
[1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:28.960]  fight it out but the point is you better reach out to the police and locals today instead of having
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:35.680]  to fight them tomorrow i mean this is a life and death emergency made a situation it's all real
[1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:42.160]  it's all happening open world governments being announced they're imploding europe uh take greece

[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:10.160]  and we've got to hit them hard what did the age and orange do to your daughter
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:16.640]  oh she's had spina bifida all her life we were told she would not live more than 48 hours uh
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:23.920]  but she's almost 40 years old it was a miracle beautiful but uh it it has kind of helped really
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:29.360]  open my eyes to the fact that not only did my government intentionally and purposely lie
[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:35.840]  but it gives me motivation alex every day to say hey i've got it i've got to inform other people
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:40.720]  about the gmo's i gotta inform others about the chemtrails do you know what was in what was
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:45.040]  declassified last year dot a dug rocky was on he sent me the documents i went and looked library
[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:52.320]  congress it's there do you know what they did with the age and orange no they added synthetic
[1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:58.800]  neurotoxin basically cobra toxin to it and it was it was actually a chemical weapon against
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:02.880]  the vietcong and in the documents they knew it would kill our troops and give them neurological
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:08.640]  disorders so it wasn't just dioxin uh and and and the birth defects they knew that it would cause
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:12.320]  that's why most people after a few kids that gets better because you can sweat it out get a lot of
[1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:18.000]  it out of you but my god if you have a kid within a few years of it look out uh but you mentioned

[1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:22.080]  about three minutes along then we'll get the rest of your calls okay so you're talking about the
[1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:25.920]  derogatory term they use and everything i know there were a lot of cases where they just line
[1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:31.840]  people up and shoot them as the war got more desperate and again we have the troops using du
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:38.320]  today which kills the enemy but then kills them years later but it turned out they knowingly
[1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:45.440]  mixed neurotoxin in with the agent orange in much of the spring so that's another reason it hurt the
[1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:50.640]  troops so bad and they knew this would do it they tell our troops oh you can march in hours after
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:56.400]  we've sprayed it and it just shows the people running things what henry kissinger right he wrote
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:05.600]  it it's on record he said the military are dumb animals cannon fodder to do and to be tools i'm
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:09.680]  paraphrasing it to be tools of our state craft believes the exact quote guys look up the henry
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:14.160]  kissinger dumb animals the military are dumb animals quote for me see i'm not here doing that
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:19.440]  i'm here talking to you straight not going oh sure support the military thank you for the wars
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:25.440]  better support the military support the wars for the bankers that run us by the way john bound and
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:29.040]  the guys last night after they went and uh talked to ron paul and covered the big rally in austin
[1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:38.560]  last night they went to uh double dave's local restaurant and they're at double dave's pizza
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:46.320]  and they had the nfl draft on we're trying to find the clip but they all saw it and they said
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:50.320]  it's time for the draft and had the military march out a message of get ready for the draft and
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:53.760]  they admit they've been getting the selective service ready and all this but it's like every
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:58.240]  event's the military at it just to get you used to the military being everywhere and now they admit
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:03.360]  it's for martial law but but briefly tell your story about refusing to shoot somebody was it in
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:08.240]  the case where you already had them there and you were supposed to uh execute them or a massacre
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:11.920]  or was it because i know i was in a combat situation somebody's shooting at me i'm gonna kill
[1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:18.000]  them regardless uh what happened in your case no alex it was the the orders of the day that if
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:24.080]  there was any uh vietnamese that came into a particular area just go ahead and shoot and
[1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:30.880]  this particular fella did not look threatening and i dropped my knee and took the safety off
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:35.600]  and i started to squeeze the trigger and i'm thinking no wait a minute and don't i i don't
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:41.520]  know why i don't know why i didn't pull the trigger but the man just stood there and stood there
[1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:46.800]  and then he turned around and left and i thank god to this day that i didn't kill that man but
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:53.120]  i would die for my country in a minute but my country is no longer the country that our founding
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:27:03.520]  fathers created no it's not alex here here's here's here's something that's even worse when i was
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:10.160]  on 24th medical evacuation hospital that was like an intensive care area miss mrs nixon was scheduled
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:16.720]  to come through and at the foot of my bed the sergeant in charge was talking about you get this
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:21.520]  place cleaned up you get these guys out of here you mop this blood off you get those bloody aprons
[1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:27.040]  off you you change the sheets you change the pillowcases you take care of this mess and you bring
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:33.920]  in the guys from the other section across so they moved you out and who were really hurting
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:40.480]  everybody just to make a show for her i was the only one to stay because my fever head broke and
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:46.800]  my my hand was well bandaged and under the blanket she couldn't see nothing but alex you've got to be
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:52.400]  in a in an intensive care area and these guys that are waking up from their operations with
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:57.520]  their heads bandaged and and opening their eyes for the first time and not being able to see and
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:04.960]  thinking that they're totally blind and the screams i don't know why people have a thing about war
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:10.240]  that's because they haven't been in it yet all these cowards think it's sexy
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:16.560]  she went through i wanted to spit in her face to create a scene but i realized it wasn't her fault
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:22.880]  but alex yes they did that they moved all these guys out that were in terrible shape there's a
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:26.880]  story of hindrick himmler who actually went out to see people getting shot and threw up and couldn't
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:31.440]  handle it yeah they don't want them to actually see what's really going on go ahead and they don't
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:39.040]  want the american people to know they don't i i just and that's what motivates me alex we we need
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:44.640]  to have everybody needs to maybe have something personal happen to them to get them off their butt
[1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:50.080]  and and do something look at all the new orders done to you send you to a bogus war age and orange

[1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:40.000]  in woodward and Bernstein's the final days chapter 14 this is what Henry Kissinger had to say
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:49.200]  military men are dumb stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy he went on to say
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:55.920]  intelligence is not all that important in the exercise of power and is often in point or fact
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:04.480]  useless no you're a cancer Henry Kissinger just because you can lie to people and do
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:09.840]  evil things doesn't mean you're dominant it means that good humans who want to work together
[1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:16.240]  and build a civilization are blind to your cancer i'm not though i want you cut out

[1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:51.920]  for the killing of 30 and he writes books bragging about it yeah i didn't kill 30 but i sure funded
[1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:57.200]  him to do it which makes it okay because pole pot did it everybody's like oh how smart you had him
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:08.640]  kill everybody oh yeah that's really great 30 the population you had him kill wow that whole

[1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:33.040]  your mind grab somebody and just rip their head around the other direction you'll break their neck
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:38.000]  they don't get to the hospital quick they're dead does that am i proud of the fact i can kill
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:44.560]  somebody am i proud of the fact i can flip that governor off right now and kill people no no i
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:50.400]  know to control that and keep that under wraps only break in case of emergency you people have this
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:57.280]  killer side and you think it's beautiful and it's wonderful it's so good no it's not good it's a
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:02.080]  and it's always these cowards these blobs like Henry Kissinger who had just have a little bit of
[1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:07.040]  killer instinct but a bunch of pervert instinct and they run around doing perverted stuff and
[1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:13.040]  perverted doesn't just mean the tsa grow up in your kids it means gmo splicing technologies
[1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:18.880]  creating all this death and destruction just wrecking things to show off because they get off
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:28.000]  on it that that is aberrant that is perverted you are perverts you are perversion in creation
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:33.200]  your cancer and i've said this a hundred times i'll say it again if and i'm going to ron paul
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:42.320]  your phone calls if cancer had consciousness in your body let's say bone cancer metastasizing in
[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:48.400]  your bone marrow it would say man i'm taking over i'm growing through all these cells i'm programming
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:52.800]  everything i'm going to send a bunch of little cells out low to the body and i'm going to take
[1:36:52.800 --> 1:37:00.480]  this over and then this tissue is going to be me the problem is if you study anthropology sociology
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:06.480]  civilization history all of it you guys are cancer and you start taking over you're like well we can
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:14.800]  do whatever we want because you are malfunctioning you are screwed up you are perverts cancer is a
[1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:23.760]  pervert it is a perversion it is a malfunctioning ugly piece of garbage that seeks to make everything
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:31.520]  like it is but the soul is what is truly pure if it chooses to be and if it flows out of that
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:40.000]  system so they can try to make us ugly physically they can try to twist our dna and deform us but
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.800]  it's our heart and our soul the globalists want to tell us all day that humanity is ugly because
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:50.640]  they want us to think we're like them they're ugly inside so they want to make everything
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:38:00.160]  ugly on the outside because it makes them feel better let me say something i have already in my
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:07.200]  gut in my spirit in my heart in my ancestral genetic instincts in everything i am humanity is
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:12.880]  going to survive you are going to be defeated and i declare victory against the new world order
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:17.200]  here on air in the name of jesus christ and does that mean i'm perfect does that mean i have all
[1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:22.720]  the answers does that mean i'm a perfect vessel absolutely not but it means this my heart knows
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:27.920]  where it is and that's why you seek with pharma and the chemicals the biologicals to ruin our
[1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:33.760]  psyches so you can then program us but god won't let our free will be taken it doesn't count it's
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:39.600]  cheating so it doesn't work you lose you fail and this is what happens it's only when humanity is
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:46.000]  attacked by this ultimate threat of dehumanization the total computerized takeover grid the automation
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:53.440]  grid only now will the basic instinct and the and the spirit of humanity and the image of
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:39:00.800]  the creator activate and now humanity is activating the power systems are powering up the resistance
[1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:08.560]  core is forming the giant that is free humanity is beginning to rise and the new order knows that
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:14.880]  and they're afraid they're afraid they are cowards and that's why they seek to take on more and more
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:18.880]  power like what was the quote john last night you had on the nightly news you guys brought me a great
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:25.600]  quote that was a powerful quote usually john digs up those quotes when you get a chance put that
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:30.800]  on screen i want to read that but basically it is the week that seek to abuse it is the week
[1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:37.600]  that seek to dominate it is the week and i am sick and tired of the strong standing back and
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:43.920]  letting armies of the week get into giant gangs and overrun us it's time to defeat these people
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:54.320]  they are pathetic they are ridiculously pathetic and weak and evil it's it's the mouse that roared
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:40:02.400]  and intimidated the lion into submission and it makes me want to throw up it is an honor
[1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:07.280]  to fight the new world order it is an honor to be demonized it will be an honor to be destroyed if
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:17.680]  that's what they do i fear not those that can kill the body but he can kill the soul and i i fear
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:21.600]  being killed them having them lie about me and destroy my name for my family and things but
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:25.840]  that doesn't matter they have no future if we don't beat them and i know in the final equation my
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:30.400]  work has already been completed in many ways and that even though i don't get credit for much of
[1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:35.280]  the work we've done that's the best part because they can't then destroy my name and destroy the
[1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:44.880]  information i have transmitted the lord works in mysterious ways and all the designs of the system
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:50.560]  that's one dimensional or two dimensional three dimensional at most cannot contend with the larger
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:53.600]  plan for the universe all right i want to get to this ron paul report
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:41:07.600]  we sent our reporters darin mcbrane john bound and of course we also sent rob jacobson and
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:16.960]  richard reeves down to the ron paul event yesterday that had over four thousand people at it wonderful
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:21.360]  crowd he gave a powerful speech we're going to be airing all that on the nightly news coming up
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:26.480]  so seven o'clock weeknights at prism planet dot tv but
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:32.240]  the question that richard reeves was able to get to him the only media because they were
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:36.960]  going to have some media they canceled it because ron paul was behind on his break neck hell bent
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:42.080]  tur to get the word out and expose the globalist that's what ron paul's doing he's already won
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:46.160]  when it comes to the hearts and minds i had said question number one why haven't you started
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:53.280]  impeachment calls for obama launching wars without congressional um authorization that violates this
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:57.120]  article not article that was the question i wanted and then what are you planning to do
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:01.200]  that you're winning the delegates what is the strategy we want to hear that those are the big
[1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:07.520]  questions for me but it works out that uh richard who was able to ask a question went with something
[1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:14.080]  else because ron paul talked about false flag that being one of his biggest fears in the speech
[1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:19.520]  we're about to show some of that and then richard as he's getting in the suburban was able to ask
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:27.040]  that question of ron paul and so it ended up working actually perfectly uh that um
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:34.000]  that richard just you know in the moment was able to get that uh question out and and for those
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:37.360]  you know that just joined us or we're going to watch this later and you're like is that even
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:45.120]  true what richard asking yes government secretly prepares to evacuate chicago during nato's summit
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:51.520]  standby shelters ready for residents now that was leaked to cbs news but uh here's my article and
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:57.120]  again we'll put it up on screen for people government secretly prepares to evacuate chicago
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:05.280]  during nato's summit standby shelters ready for residents steve watson paul joseph watson
[1:43:05.280 --> 1:43:10.800]  uh article and then you can see right there the cbs link uh click on that for folks right there
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:17.280]  so they can uh see that as well so that is in context and i don't blame ron paul for not
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:22.400]  knowing about it because it it just broke that day so there was no way uh he could probably
[1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:27.120]  know about that but he still said i am concerned about false flags and said that in his speech so
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:33.600]  here is part of his speech and richard reeves uh question and then we'll post the full video tonight
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:38.400]  at prismplanet.tv but for radio listeners here's the audio if you're watching at prismplanet.tv
[1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:42.480]  you can also see it you can go and watch the free link at info wars dot com right now but
[1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:51.440]  here is excerpts of ron paul in austin last night they do the same thing with foreign policy they
[1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:56.560]  come along and they don't talk about non-intervention and mining our own business they oh you guys are
[1:43:56.560 --> 1:44:02.880]  a bunch of isolation is you don't want to talk to anybody but guess what the very people who tell
[1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:07.040]  us that we're the isolationists are the ones who are always looking around for another enemy to
[1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:16.000]  slay and put on sanctions to start another war they're the ones who don't want to trade with
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:21.120]  cuba we're the ones that think that it's time to engage in the world and to talk to people and
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:29.360]  trade with people so they will try to paint us as uncaring but let me tell you people who care
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:38.320]  will care about liberty and this this will never translate into an absolute majority but i am i'm
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:44.480]  certain that our numbers are growing by leaps and bounds these prairie fires of freedom are being
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:52.640]  spread and there's nothing but good news out there precariously so because we don't know exactly we
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:45:00.720]  may have something happen there may be a false flag incident where some some ship goes down
[1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:04.560]  and you'd be used for the excuse to accelerate the next war and
[1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:21.520]  um we have to learn to distinguish war propaganda from the truth
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:28.400]  dr paul today's headline story on info wars dot com is about how the government's plan is secretly
[1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:32.720]  evacuated chicago during the upcoming nato summit in may do you have any comments about that i haven't
[1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:38.880]  seen that but uh i don't know exactly what's behind all that but uh that kind of no those kind of
[1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:44.240]  those kind of statements concerned me but they're potentially another false flag event i'm always
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:54.720]  worried about we got to get going okay so we were able to get that question in to ron paul and now
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:46:00.000]  we're having info wars reporters that are part of the contest all over the country uh getting questions
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  into ron paul we had one yesterday we aired where he got into a 21 in more detail there every he said
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:10.240]  i'm an info wars reporter they just bring him backstage ron paul goes one question and he was
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:14.960]  able to get it in so one way or another we're getting our questions through ron paul so great
[1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:21.200]  job to my crew on that and a great job on that question from richard reeves and again we will

[1:47:29.200 --> 1:47:33.840]  and sending out their email list that's how we're reaching more people because i don't want to be
[1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:38.640]  all in in this fight and then have it fail and uh we don't have a choice but but thank you you
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:44.640]  heard ron paul and earlier he said it's exploding liberty is exploding that's why the globalists
[1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:51.520]  are rushing us right now their offensive is a desperate defensive operation do you understand
[1:47:51.520 --> 1:48:01.200]  that yes good i um but i want to also say also uh i like to uh uh bring up a couple of ideas especially
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:06.000]  if you're listeners in yourself okay everything i'm in the papers i'm reading it you hear it on on
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  the news on the internet you've heard about the twitter and the raves that are going on
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:16.400]  have you heard of them uh yeah tell folks about that well what is it you know they they they
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:22.400]  usually tweet out a message to get a rave get thousands of people in one area yeah they say
[1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:27.040]  hey let's go to this area and then everybody listens down to their own music and dances around
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:32.160]  and yeah why don't people do that for liberty instead of just mindlessly going out and dancing
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:40.960]  around acting like morons right is that your idea well no my idea would be for all the info warriors
[1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:47.440]  out there and maybe you know with all the people they know uh sort of freedom wave a rave get out
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:51.200]  there and get the people out in the areas you know let the news know i mean get the information i
[1:48:51.200 --> 1:48:57.200]  totally agree start announcing freedom raves and then maybe everybody just drinks lemonade or something
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:00.560]  adamant has a good time and meets like-minded people you don't want to have anything illegal
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:04.880]  so the globalists can come in they'll probably send people in but if you do them as flash mobs
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:08.400]  i would say have a freedom rave right in front of the county courthouse you know or
[1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:13.520]  right in front of the capital hey well we storm the capital twice we just marched in there ready
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:18.880]  to be arrested we're the people we're marching in to get in your face no more of this can we get a
[1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:24.240]  permit now they have a thing where i announce an event somebody gets a permit to be there in front
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:27.920]  of me to claim it's their event and then you know claim that i'm crashing their event or something
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:34.160]  you know i mean but yeah but the point is we've just all got to take action it is so important
[1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:39.280]  to do that and i agree with anything else yeah one more thing i just want to also say that you
[1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:43.120]  know during these elections and everything you always see these signs you know all the candidates
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:46.960]  are out there every quarter you go to just hundreds of signs and there's really a nice
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:51.520]  sort but you go by and you're always looking at them why can't we just like have the info waters put
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:55.920]  signs up there with info wars dot com in the middle of all these in a different color so
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:00.800]  they stand out people look at i agree with you and when the elections over grab them up i mean the
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:05.040]  globalists already grab up patriot signs and destroy them i'm not saying do that or or plaster
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:09.760]  pieces of paper stapled over it with a message don't don't founding fathers would do that we
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:14.160]  should not do that we should be very limp-wristed but no we can just take the signs when they're
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:18.880]  done fold them back over staple them back info wars dot com and i think info wars dot com
[1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:24.320]  i'm always even hesitant to say that's the side i'm like well ron paul or other sites but no it

[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:32.320]  i mean i've read all the documents i've sourced them i've shown you i mean these are really nasty
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:40.800]  people and they they get off on running other people's lives they enjoy it you've all run into
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:47.920]  that type of person who wants to run your life all i want is to be free and it's the other people

[1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:21.360]  new order comes fully into place absolutely uh you were talking last week about having to have
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:28.640]  a permit from the tsa to have a job i'm a yacht captain we've had to have permits for since 2008 to
[1:56:28.640 --> 1:56:35.200]  work under our uh coast guard licenses from the tsa uh they call them tweaks uh transportation
[1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:42.560]  works identity cards yeah they call them uh tsa inspectors and and and now they're gonna be over
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:47.200]  all jobs they've started in in infrastructure protection like you said and now they're gonna
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:50.960]  start being everywhere including i guess you're gonna try to come here and it's not happening

[1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:01.200]  submission it's like i'm gonna rape you i'm i'm sorry go ahead right but i mean that's like i said
[1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:06.800]  that they made uh captains get these things uh in 2008 so it's uh four years ago they actually had
[1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:12.480]  north north of grum and uh defense contractor was actually running the program uh which is
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:17.440]  ridiculous because the coast guard is part of the homeland security so they've actually got you know
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:22.400]  we have to have extensive background checks and uh yeah but you can't have the old coast guard giving
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:28.160]  you a background check to be in those secure ports it has to be the political police who they admit
[1:57:28.160 --> 1:57:35.280]  are going to pull people's contracts and stuff they have a bill in the map bill where they can pass
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:40.000]  your private info around to anybody they want and spy on congress i mean it's totally criminal

[1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:00.880]  gonna chop it up and in the real satanic rituals they take hours to kill the babies and you know
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:05.520]  why because they got power they got the power to kill a baby and they got the will to kill a baby

[2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:03.280]  thing or another and it is just horrible and i want the police to know this we've actually got a police
[2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:08.960]  officer on hold to see what jk in missouri as i say i want you to and most police know this
[2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:12.400]  the way the troops are being treated is exactly how you're going to be treated
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:19.120]  and it's important to understand that anything else sir yes uh they also warned me that i gotta

[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:11.440]  need other veterans in the area to join you and go with you next time and if they do threaten to
[2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:16.880]  take your bed benefits which is a terroristic threat how can these so-called uh va police threaten
[2:12:16.880 --> 2:12:23.200]  that to you i don't believe you can withdraw those those are in your contract it that is so
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:29.440]  incredible that they would try to terrorize you man uh what is your youtube how do people
[2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:37.360]  contact you and what is your website my youtube is our thorn two revelations of truth and they can

[2:12:45.360 --> 2:12:52.720]  i cannot lose my va benefits and i know they can take it away from me well how do they do that
[2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:58.480]  though i don't think they can i think it's very hard to do that i don't know they they said they
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:04.320]  could take them away from me man i wouldn't want to you know spiritually just imagining those guys
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:10.080]  threatening a veteran like yourself who obviously isn't doing well in health on a cane just i would
[2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:16.080]  i just even hearing it makes me cringe in fear of what god would do to me i mean i just oh just the
[2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:21.920]  fear of the exercise of that type of wicked power over somebody and the and the embarrassment
[2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:26.400]  and they're saying because you handed out some bible tracks in one of my films
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:34.400]  i hand down several your police state three and they went around and collected all of the dvds
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:39.600]  from all the veterans and uh before i laughed oh they're not even allowed to have those you
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:46.880]  know kelly rushing in lionport uh in lion county kentucky it was in the newspaper he called me i
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:50.640]  didn't believe it this is like eight years ago because it sounded so crazy he sounded credible
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:54.560]  but i didn't i'm gonna go to the police officer in a minute stay there jk they i told the guys
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:57.440]  make sure he stays and says they can hear radios and stuff in the background so we have to go
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:14:00.720]  any minute i want to get his take on this and see why he called because most police aren't like
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:06.560]  what we're hearing here but the va has their own special people and i it was in the newspaper that
[2:14:06.560 --> 2:14:14.000]  he gave state police long play vhs tapes with a ron paul speech called neocon 44 minutes long
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  and my film 911 the road to tyranny and they said the the it was anti police so they took it as a
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:27.680]  threat and so they charged him with terroristic threats and i even called the judge and even
[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:33.040]  i he admitted it and it went to trial but the jury found him not guilty he was facing two counts
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:39.440]  three years apiece six years in prison for i mean in america and so they went and took the dvds
[2:14:39.440 --> 2:14:47.200]  wow anything else alex here's the kicker they said you don't want a homeland security to pull up
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:54.080]  in front of your apartment do you oh wow then they threatened then they threatened a veteran
[2:14:54.080 --> 2:15:03.440]  on a cane how old are you 63 have a grown man crying here on air terrorized by filth and oh you

[2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:23.760]  information for you i know for a fact that the nuclear power plant a nuclear power plant in
[2:16:23.760 --> 2:16:31.840]  central illinois has been running their hazmat emergency water response and was told to be
[2:16:31.840 --> 2:16:41.280]  on standby for chicago i also know for a fact that there is a uh nasa guard outfit right now
[2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:48.160]  that's got every mass unit in illinois training and i know that nasa guard unit's only approximately
[2:16:48.160 --> 2:16:52.320]  90 miles from chicago i also know there's a bunch of police officers in which i've had
[2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:59.360]  talked with that all of a sudden had mandated hazmat training and they're all from illinois
[2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:06.720]  and you don't think something's gonna happen i might want to think again well because we're
[2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:12.880]  talking about it it may not but that's the question we posed to ron paul and the the uh
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:20.240]  red cross has confirmed cbs is reporting it's not just info wars dot com that they do have
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:26.080]  total evacuation on standby and i talked to another emergency manager over the border
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:32.560]  a few years ago and i called him again last night they have confirmed that they've been
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:37.760]  told and i'm not saying this is going to happen to be ready for one million to be buried right
[2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:42.240]  across the border in their county alone in indiana and of course that original interviews two years
[2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:46.480]  old but they've been told to prepare for it again so i think they just do this every time
[2:17:46.480 --> 2:17:52.560]  to test the takeover but they could bootleg a false flag what do you think well i'm i'm
[2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:56.480]  almost sure something's gonna happen i'm almost positive something's gonna happen
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:18:04.400]  yeah you don't sell 400 million rounds of 40 caliber hollow points 250 million rounds of
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:09.840]  two two threes and not expect something to happen and it just doesn't happen that way
[2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:16.240]  and i know for a fact most of the officers that i work with you send in russian troops or blue
[2:18:16.240 --> 2:18:23.120]  helmets god help them god help them well you know they may just try it i mean whoever thought they'd
[2:18:23.120 --> 2:18:28.240]  say they're gonna ban kids doing chores on farms whoever thought they'd obama would launch wars
[2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:32.640]  and tell congress to take a hike i mean this is really scary this is a real attempt to take over
[2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:40.720]  of the country why is that man being a beach well because listen they think they've got at least
[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:46.400]  half the public totally braindead watching tv that's why this is all happening and uh
[2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:53.200]  it does go to hell in a hand basket the people that have prepared will make it through it and
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:57.840]  i pray to god that it doesn't happen but i also pray to god that if it does happen do it now
[2:18:57.840 --> 2:19:04.160]  i'm young enough to help rebuild i also pray to god that if it does happen that we can get our

[2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:08.480]  gets scared by them they get into it even more it really gets me angry and then you have a but
[2:25:08.480 --> 2:25:11.920]  but then you have that horrible story you have another police officer calling in who says he's

[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:24.640]  us exposing this they may not be able to do it remember that Larry Silverstein bought the Sears
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:32.160]  Tower they've now changed the name same guy that bought the world trade centers a month before or

[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:41.600]  have double insurance on it all of this needs to be looked into and certainly you've got all these
[2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:46.560]  official memos that the White House has put out that their advisors have put out saying it'd be
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:50.480]  great if we had a terror attack that'd make you look like a hero they think we're so stupid the
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:57.840]  Democratic Party has these memos out and Ron Paul said last night his greatest concern because
[2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:04.080]  we're starting to wake people up is a false flag we played that clip last hour this is the news
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:11.600]  we're talking about this is the issues this is real this is real they announced last week war
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:17.520]  on terrorists over with al-qaeda tsa is going to be everywhere they tell us you're the terrorist

[2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:05.440]  she is a doctor of chemistry and she's a great activist helping to fight to get poisonous fluoride
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:10.640]  other chemicals out of her water and she's running for city council and getting some momentum i see
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:15.120]  her signs up all over town laura presley who's been a guest on the nightly news a few times
[2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:19.520]  and she's with fluoride free austin running for city council others can do this in your area around
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:22.960]  the country and we're going to break it a moment we come back what are you going to be covering why
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:27.280]  are you running for city council and we'll also get into the good news that ut is going to provide
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:31.600]  fluoride free water fountains yes hi alex thank you thanks for having me here you bet good to
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:36.720]  have you with us thank you um yeah i'm running for the austin city council and i got really mad
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:41.200]  fluoride was one of the big issues that got me really really furious about the city council
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:46.160]  wouldn't put a warning on water bills for children and if you just look even now new hampshire has
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:53.600]  has mandated the save new hampshire's mandated warnings on um fluoridated uh um water bills
[2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:58.160]  for for infants and so we asked the city council to do this they didn't do it i've also spoken out
[2:27:58.160 --> 2:28:02.640]  against the tsa scanners and i got really mad so i decided to do something about it i listened to you
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:07.120]  decided to do something about it and run for city council well you're a smart sharp lady you might
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:10.880]  get in there of the electronic voting machines don't stop you but regardless you're gonna really
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:15.360]  have a bully pulpit now when they laugh at you and laugh at other doctors and chemists
[2:28:15.360 --> 2:28:20.320]  and professors you bring in but but but as you pointed out uh ut admits oh yeah the government
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:24.480]  says lower the amount of fluoride that it's poisonous to kids the american medical association
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:29.520]  says stop giving it little kids but the city council's still laughing at people yeah they're
[2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:33.440]  you know there's there's the good reason people do things and and the real reason and i think the
[2:28:33.440 --> 2:28:37.520]  real reason that they do not get fluoride out is they are can you know follow the money they're
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:44.400]  very concerned about some um uh grants that they get from the centers for disease control they give
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:48.880]  austin city council about seven million dollars worth of grants and i think they are really worried
[2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:53.760]  about losing that money if they get fluoride out there's several council members that know the truth
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:58.240]  they know what's going on and they still won't take action so i'm here to provide that leadership
[2:28:58.240 --> 2:29:03.200]  and stick my neck out and make this happen well good because the feds take our money send 30
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:07.600]  something cents back and then try to tell us that we've got to have fluoride because they love us so
[2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:12.000]  much when we come back though because you're a chemist break down what's really in the so-called
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:17.440]  fluoride and what's going on with it and all the new information coming out and what happened with
[2:29:17.440 --> 2:29:21.920]  ut and then we need to talk about how people get behind your candidacy but as we go to break

[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:29.520]  fluoride i was on thyroid medication for about eight years and my my symptoms kept going up and
[2:35:29.520 --> 2:35:34.160]  down and i really couldn't my symptoms really weren't stable so i got really frustrated with
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:39.040]  taking medication so i did a lot of research on you know what is causing my thyroid issues
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:44.240]  because i didn't have any genetic predispositions no family members had any fluoride or thyroid
[2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:49.600]  issues so i did a lot of research and lo and behold found out through you and a lot of other
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:55.360]  uh dr. mccola and also mike adams how bad fluoride is for your thyroid your thyroid
[2:35:55.360 --> 2:35:59.360]  wants iodine we give it we give it fluoride instead so it uptakes that and doesn't work
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:04.000]  correctly it seems very very simple and if you look at the periodic table fluoride and iodine
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:08.080]  are in the same column and so that means they have their electronic structure is very similar
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:12.480]  so what your thyroid does it uptakes the fluoride instead of the iodine because that's what you're
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:18.720]  giving it majority in your diet the water and the tea and soups and rice when we cook all that
[2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:23.200]  the fluoride stays in in those comp in those foods and you're a chemist so all that made sense all of
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:27.280]  it made very sense you know incredible sense to me so i looked at the data and went oh this is
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:32.560]  what's going on with me so i stopped ingesting fluoride i stopped completely drinking any water
[2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:37.520]  or any fluids with fluoride in it foods i stopped drinking tea and only drank purified water that
[2:36:37.520 --> 2:36:43.920]  had no fluoride in it six months my symptoms were gone i'd been on medication for eight years and
[2:36:43.920 --> 2:36:49.600]  within six months all of my symptoms were gone my allergies were improved my migraines were improved
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:54.080]  i was on uh thyroid medicine allergy medicine migraine medication i'm completely off of that
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:37:00.400]  i'm 50 years old and i'm on no drug you're 50 you don't look 50 i'm 50 years old and on no medications
[2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:05.440]  isn't that wonderful i don't you know i used to i one year i remember is cautious about eight years
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:10.720]  ago i maxed out my major medical for health issues when we drink really pure water we worry
[2:37:10.720 --> 2:37:15.520]  about organic food but where's our organic water but they know i mean as you know i've had the medical
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:20.080]  doctors on and brain surgeons it doesn't just hit your thyroid it's in all your organs your
[2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:27.600]  also it magnifies as you know all the other drugs and toxins it's a uh adjuvant basically yes and
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:32.480]  even your intestines fluoride is a disinfectant so you kill all the good bacteria and all the
[2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:37.520]  good flora that's in your stomach to help you digest and and process these nutrients of foods
[2:37:37.520 --> 2:37:41.680]  and we're missing that also so when you take fluoride out of your diet you will see a huge
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:45.600]  improvement in your health when's the last time people went to the doctor and they said i have i
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:51.040]  have thyroid issues i have migraine issues i have swelling issues and the doctor says stop drinking the
[2:37:51.040 --> 2:37:55.120]  tap water and then come back to me in a month and i'll tell you whether you need a drug or not
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:38:00.480]  and then it's not just the tap water they spray it on the crops which the last year it's a pesticide
[2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:06.320]  last year finally under pressure the fda had to admit oh my gosh stop using this face it out but
[2:38:06.320 --> 2:38:11.120]  not quick enough because it bio accumulates and then i mean just it just goes on and on
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:17.360]  and it's in products it's we are just inundated with it we are inundated with it and if we take
[2:38:17.360 --> 2:38:22.800]  it out of our diet our bodies work the way it's they're supposed to so that was a huge revelation
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:26.880]  to me and i got recruited by fluoride free austin because of my chemistry background and my health
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:31.760]  improvement um experiences and i wanted to bring that knowledge to the city council so here i am
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:36.160]  presenting this data chemical data to the city council and i think oh a couple weeks will present
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:40.960]  the data i'll be back at work they'll make the right decision two years later they're still not
[2:38:40.960 --> 2:38:46.240]  doing it and it just got me furious and we even backed up we said let's back up let's put a warning
[2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:51.440]  on the water bill for infants and we said you know what that's a slam dunk the city council should
[2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:57.120]  do that pretty easily we got really good feedback from my opponent who i'm running against in the
[2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:01.760]  city council race and he gave us you know very high confidence is yes we'll get this water this
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:06.000]  warning on the water bill and it didn't happen and i got really furious and while i'm sitting there
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.880]  testifying to the city council on all these issues these health issues i see other groups coming up
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:15.840]  presenting information to them um property rights issues on and on and they still wouldn't make the
[2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:19.680]  right decision so i said i need to run and make a difference because i've had it we're gonna talk
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:24.000]  about that now other people should run bare minimum you win by running just to educate people but
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:29.840]  expanding on this tell folks because i've read depending on what so-called fluoride the city's
[2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:34.880]  buying there could be hundreds of things it's just raw waste and and you know even the top
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:39.200]  dentist in canada he's been out in the news in the last few years uh we've interviewed him once
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:44.160]  he's saying i a decade ago got got canada florida because i thought it was just a little sodium
[2:39:44.160 --> 2:39:49.360]  fluoride this is toxic waste explain what they're putting in the water so what they're putting is
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:56.400]  is a commercial grade hydrofluorosilic acid and um it's a very strong chemical fluoride is if you
[2:39:56.400 --> 2:40:03.760]  look at the material safety data sheet for this um it's it's h2sif6 is what it is and they even
[2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:08.240]  warned that you know ingesting this can cause a lot of health issues so they're putting this in
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:13.520]  our water it's not pharmaceutical grade it is commercial grade it's a byproduct of the fertilizer
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:18.240]  industry and you know my big issue is if you know i wouldn't want even commercial grade sodium
[2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:24.160]  fluoride in my water because there's no dosage control there is it's a medicine you can't go to a
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:28.480]  pharmacy and purchase it you can only get it with a person and they now admit it's causing the teeth
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:32.880]  to get fluorosis and even the american dental association says don't give it to kids under
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:38.160]  five yes absolutely so you know what there's no dose of control that it's not pharmaceutical grade
[2:40:38.160 --> 2:40:42.080]  i don't want it in my water and a lot of people don't lulac the league of united latin american
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:46.800]  citizens last summer came out with a resolution that said stop medicating our population you're
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:50.640]  doing it because of low income families well you know what the hispanic and latino community are
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:58.320]  saying thanks but no thanks we got it we are our people are subject to diabetes kidney disease
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:03.280]  and these are these are health issues that are really aggravated with fluoride in the water and
[2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:07.840]  we say no we said you know let people make their own decision don't make it where i can't have a choice
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:15.360]  we're putting the bizarre quotes by the mayor basically uh you're responding to the public
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:19.760]  out there who is the worst on the city council in austin when it comes to laughing at people
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:25.120]  making jokes about this i would there's multiple ones and i would i would say the mayor is the
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:30.960]  most disrespectful and also my opponent texts while people are presenting pouring their heart out
[2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:36.880]  to to both and both of them are really disrespectful to citizens and you know what really bothers me
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:42.960]  about the city council is you will go and present to them information for three minutes you get done
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:47.360]  there's no responses as if you are in a vacuum they don't even respond to no back when we
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:51.760]  got the city council to throw out the patriot act we didn't have the votes till i spoke
[2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:57.520]  and it is one of the most uh more eloquent speeches i've given but the mayor goes i'm not
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:42:02.560]  going to sit here while you give your speech i'm going to be back there and he gets up and walks off
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:08.720]  the dais and but i was able to reach out to the the one swing vote and get them to vote to
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:13.360]  nullify the patriot act here in town and it was more ceremonial than anything but it just shows
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:18.880]  the extreme arrogance and that was another mayor before this guy but he really is a joke talk about
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:25.200]  somebody on a power trip uh lee leffingwell is a is a joke not just to texas but the entire country
[2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:31.680]  he's a true shame to the human race now uh doc uh we're talking to laura presley who's running for
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:35.200]  city council here in austin texas we'll tell you how to get involved in that in a moment
[2:42:35.200 --> 2:42:39.840]  hopefully this will spur others running their area let's get into ut though we had a big victory
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:44.000]  there and i was reading the statesman where they admitted it's much worse for women and blacks for
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:47.840]  whatever reason the chemistry shows and that now they're going to provide water fountains that
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:53.120]  don't have fluoride nicer restaurants are now advertising if they don't have it it's catching on
[2:42:53.120 --> 2:42:58.160]  it is catching on and ut i testified to the ut student government it's a group of students
[2:42:58.160 --> 2:43:03.360]  undergrad and graduate students um representatives on to the student government and many of us from
[2:43:03.360 --> 2:43:07.760]  fluoride free awesome presented the data and this is where it should happen alex people should look
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:13.520]  at this information make a good discernment of whether does it make sense does it make not sense
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:18.800]  and make a decision and they made a decision very quickly and it was just it was so shockingly
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:23.760]  different than the city council that they don't look at the data and they pull up old information
[2:43:23.760 --> 2:43:29.760]  and and just ignore us but this was really excellent you had technical students you had business
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:34.640]  students you had you know liberal arts students all looking at the information and they made a
[2:43:34.640 --> 2:43:41.520]  decision you know what we should have several fountains in ut austin that offer no fluoride
[2:43:41.520 --> 2:43:46.560]  because you have sensitive groups women are sensitive to hypothyroidism you have hispanics
[2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:51.920]  and african-americans that are very sensitive to diabetes and kidney kidney diseases and those
[2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:57.280]  people are who we're and this is the beginning of them seeing the real science and then demanding
[2:43:57.920 --> 2:44:02.000]  water fountains that don't have poison in it just like the elite don't drink fluoride water
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  they don't eat gmo at the monsanto facilities it's associated press their scientists demand
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:14.320]  non-monsanto food in the cafeteria so it's begun i mean but talk about all the other cities what's
[2:44:14.320 --> 2:44:19.440]  going on whole cities are throwing it out right and i'll tell you one thing rick perry his his
[2:44:19.440 --> 2:44:24.800]  facility his home there is all fluoride free and all reverse osmosis so he knows not to drink it
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:29.360]  here in here in here in austin yeah there's some great progress that's being made like i mentioned
[2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:34.960]  earlier new ham sure is is amazing they they're their house and their senate passed a fluoride
[2:44:34.960 --> 2:44:40.000]  statement that's going to be required in their consumer reports for their public water supplies
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  and i'm going to read it your public water supply is fluoridated according to centers for
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:48.960]  disease control and prevention if your child under the age of six months is exclusively consuming
[2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:53.360]  infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water there may be an increased chance of dental
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:58.720]  fluorosis consult your child's health care provider for more information it's a little water down
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:03.520]  so to speak but at least it gets the information out there at least you can get the councils to do
[2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:07.760]  one thing and admit the fluorosis not the iq reduction the brain damage the cancer which
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:11.680]  is also admitted but at least something at least something at least it's the first the door is
[2:45:11.680 --> 2:45:15.680]  opening this is a huge victory yeah the camel's nose is under the tent but i mean look at one of
[2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:21.440]  the biggest counties uh a million people in in florida the county right by tampa uh you've got uh
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:27.280]  calgary it's happening everywhere it's happening in a lot of places and we want austin to be the
[2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:32.640]  next place college station very close to us where a and m is they got the water uh got fluoridation
[2:45:32.640 --> 2:45:38.560]  out of their water why can't logovista outside austin several several it's happening we can beat
[2:45:38.560 --> 2:45:45.440]  them just like we beat not allowing uh uh farm children to do chores you know again and they'll
[2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:49.120]  be back but we've got to fight them again that's the thing we don't give up and fluoride free
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:53.120]  austin's not going to give up and by getting me on this on the council there's like i said there
[2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:58.320]  are several members of that city council already that know the difference they just need a leader
[2:45:58.320 --> 2:46:03.760]  to step up stick their neck out they're afraid so you know you govern you know it's interesting i think
[2:46:03.760 --> 2:46:08.720]  politicians and your your representatives are governed sometimes the corruption is comes in
[2:46:08.720 --> 2:46:15.040]  two ways either financial corruption or fear and fear they work off of fear in a lot of ways
[2:46:15.040 --> 2:46:19.040]  i don't work off of fear i have friends that tell me you don't have the fear chip and i don't you
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:22.720]  don't have the fear chip in your brain i don't have it in my brain we just do what's right
[2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:27.040]  let's tell the truth and i hear you're also a shooter i was in there talking to my buddy about
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:32.720]  how uh women are such great olympic shots because they're calm and uh and and you're like hey i'm
[2:46:32.720 --> 2:46:37.840]  i'm like anne oakley that's what i've been called i like revolvers better than the semi-automatics
[2:46:37.840 --> 2:46:42.800]  i like it better well a revolver is a very elegant firearm and it also in a in a in a jam when
[2:46:42.800 --> 2:46:47.120]  you're all nervous and really need it you know i think you got a revolver right over here i bet you
[2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:51.840]  do so uh yeah we're just you know you do i can't do it with seven shots look at this little seven
[2:46:51.840 --> 2:46:57.200]  shot three fifty seven but uh we've got some semi-autos too i got a couple guns two or three but
[2:46:57.200 --> 2:47:02.480]  to be to be sarcastic i want to talk about how folks get involved in your campaign but
[2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:07.120]  what else is on that big list you've got there i've always said it's time to start suing them
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:13.200]  for medicating things that we know gives a seven-fold increase in cancer in boys that's been known
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:19.680]  for decades that's a fact uh that is also toxic i mean it's but but they're also on a defensive
[2:47:19.680 --> 2:47:24.880]  offense they're saying hey let's put lithium in too let's put statins in we're suddenly you know
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:29.120]  the white house science are like let's put stuff in the water to sterilize people suddenly they're
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:34.160]  like you know what we are putting stuff in your water sit down and shut up yeah i think um you
[2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:39.520]  know with with regard to austin we're gonna try the the council approach again get me on the council
[2:47:39.520 --> 2:47:43.760]  there's a couple other members running for city council that if we could get us on there you know
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:48.640]  we do have a chance a high strong probability of getting fluoride out uh if that doesn't work
[2:47:48.640 --> 2:47:52.960]  there are lawsuit options and fluoride free awesome is pursuing that and there are different
[2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:57.920]  creative ways to do that i know that california the california lawsuit just got thrown out of
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:03.040]  court by the federal judge and she said that just because the fda hasn't approved this um
[2:48:03.040 --> 2:48:08.480]  fluoride as a medication you can't sue let me tell you how to get them you get you get a sample
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:12.480]  you find out what company they've got you buy some because you know they they keep all that secret
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:17.040]  you test it when it's got to lead the the mercury and the radioactivize the tub senate you got them
[2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:21.920]  you don't go after the fluoride you go after the impurity of what they're using and none of them are
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:27.040]  pure right i'm telling you that's the achilles heel that's that's i agree there are a lot of
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:31.840]  approaches and those are very creative approaches that haven't been done yet so yeah you don't go
[2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:37.440]  the route they want with all their propaganda you go really is uh uranium is that good too
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:42.800]  yeah because the stuff's not it's over you find the uranium in there and it's in there it's over
[2:48:42.800 --> 2:48:48.160]  yeah it's commercial grade it's not pharmaceutical grade oh where they lime that mines that where they
[2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:53.440]  mine that limestone i get tired in the third hour where they mine that that's got the radioactive
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:57.760]  isotopes is that a lot of stuff got a lot of heavy metals in it i mean i worked in this i worked in
[2:48:57.760 --> 2:49:02.640]  the semiconductor industry for 17 years we wouldn't use that stuff for our chips okay why are we using
[2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:09.600]  it for our bodies amazing tell folks how they get involved in the campaign yes um so we are the
[2:49:09.600 --> 2:49:15.280]  election day is may 12th early voting in austin starts april 30th through may 8th and so we want
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:19.760]  people if you can't vote on on may 12th get out in early voting there's a bunch of early voting
[2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:25.440]  events coming up in the next couple weeks but we need volunteers and i need donations our opponent
[2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:30.800]  is very wealthy he's got a lot of he's really tied into the developer in the subsidy system here in

[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:27.600]  little sneaky vote nobody knew was coming so a lot of the house wasn't there and then if they try to
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:32.320]  implement it will file lawsuits congress wants to know what's at the new nsa base they've been told

[2:54:38.880 --> 2:54:43.200]  don't matter by the bureaucracy this is a lawless group we're having victories against them trying
[2:54:43.200 --> 2:54:48.080]  to say your kids can't do chores if you know if they work on a farm we're having victories that's
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:52.160]  why they're rushing ahead we're having victories victories on fluoride ron paul talks about the
[2:54:52.160 --> 2:54:58.640]  huge awakening taking place and on fluoride that is one of the most important places between all
[2:54:58.640 --> 2:55:04.080]  a's getting pulled out everywhere when we take action we can win and that's why it's important
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:10.480]  for all of you to realize this is not hopeless doc again you're a ron paul supporter all the ron paul
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:14.320]  people should get behind you because they've stolen the election from ron paul he did win
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:19.600]  the first primaries he's won by injecting real issues whether win lose or draw you win but it's
[2:55:19.600 --> 2:55:25.120]  time for all the ron paul people to run themselves it's time to take this country back they can't
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:30.320]  stop us all i'm not an immoral person and and i've said on air the globalist poses patriots
[2:55:30.880 --> 2:55:35.520]  like mit romney's going to do and get elected what if we i'm not saying this is good but what
[2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:41.360]  have we played along i'm not saying do this as sleeper ops and acted like globalists to get in
[2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:45.520]  and then did what they did i mean it is getting to that point i'm not saying we should do that but
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:50.560]  but side issue we've got about three or four minutes left uh other points you'd like to make
[2:55:50.560 --> 2:55:55.040]  again how do people get involved with you locally okay so yes we need volunteers we
[2:55:55.040 --> 2:55:59.360]  need blockwalkers over the next week so please email us through our contact page at pressley
[2:55:59.360 --> 2:56:03.760]  for austin dot com and the other big issues with the city council fluoride is a big issue
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:09.280]  all right tsa is a big issue the subsidies that this council is giving to apple corporation
[2:56:09.280 --> 2:56:13.680]  eight point six million dollars to create 300 jobs a year for the next 10 years
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:17.040]  alex we could do this with our small businesses in town i have a small business
[2:56:17.040 --> 2:56:22.000]  i don't get a subsidy you don't get as i hear oh i'm i'm trash i'm trash you don't get a subsidy
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:26.800]  so don't you imagine nine million dollars could create 300 jobs a year in austin pretty easily
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:31.600]  without giving it to apple is apple going to put suicide nets up around their offices i don't know
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:34.800]  are they going to bring slaves you know they have suicide nets at their other offices oh
[2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:40.880]  in china they have so many suicides yeah i'm not kidding i hear you i hear you no um i wonder if
[2:56:40.880 --> 2:56:47.600]  the city will pay for the suicide nets this al gore's gotta get every dime he can so my opponent
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:51.920]  votes for all these subsidies and he actually made a comment that the city needs to mitigate the
[2:56:51.920 --> 2:56:57.440]  risk for these corporations coming into austin bringing jobs and i say no you don't mitigate my
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:01.040]  risk as a small business and i don't think we should be subsidizing these large corporations
[2:57:01.040 --> 2:57:06.400]  it's ridiculous so that's another big area that we're different from this from our opponent and
[2:57:06.400 --> 2:57:11.760]  but i need people for block walking this week in austin and donate to our campaign we've got
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:17.040]  several ads going on and uh we've got other stuff coming up in the next your campaign's got quite a
[2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:23.360]  bit of momentum you could win we have we have more yard signs than the opponent by far probably 10x
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:27.840]  and we've got large signs we've got ads on um i'm gonna tell you your your competitor rush
[2:57:27.840 --> 2:57:33.120]  limbaugh we put some ads on his show you mean locally no i'm i'm on 590 locally locally and we
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:37.760]  did but i'm not i'm on 590 i'm not in competition with rush limbaugh we're hitting we're hitting
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:42.000]  the conservatives because this really resonates with conservatives stop giving our money out
[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:47.040]  hold it hold the city council accountable for the bad decisions financial decisions they're
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:51.280]  making they're raising our electric rates they could be cutting costs instead of just spending
[2:57:51.280 --> 2:57:55.120]  and taxing let's just be clear i'm not in competition with limbaugh everywhere i'm put on
[2:57:55.120 --> 2:58:00.240]  up against him we're we're getting better ratings than i know that so so my point is rush is fading
[2:58:00.240 --> 2:58:06.080]  off into a prozac induced or or is it oxy cotton induced uh haze and and we hope he wakes up and
[2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:10.240]  becomes a real patriot and fights the new world order and stops denying it now that it's uh open
[2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:15.120]  and plain view well good job on your work and i hope people get behind you doc thanks for coming
