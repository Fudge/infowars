[00:00.000 --> 00:09.740]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.740 --> 00:11.240]  You want answers?
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.880]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.880 --> 00:28.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:28.840 --> 00:33.040]  Which is Friday, the 26th day of February 2010.
[00:33.040 --> 00:37.800]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:37.800 --> 00:41.320]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:41.320 --> 00:46.360]  I'll be back live this Sunday, by the way, just a program note, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard
[00:46.360 --> 00:47.360]  Time.
[00:47.360 --> 00:55.200]  Okay, I want to run through the stacks of incredibly important news, at least go through
[00:55.200 --> 00:59.720]  the headlines and break them down in more detail.
[00:59.720 --> 01:05.800]  Then coming up, we have Nigel Farage, a member of the European Union Parliament, hailing
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.300]  from England.
[01:07.300 --> 01:12.800]  He, of course, chewed out Herman von Rumpi, the traitorous snake, who openly admits they're
[01:12.800 --> 01:18.520]  setting up world government through the EU and is sanguating or sucking the blood out
[01:18.520 --> 01:21.560]  of European nations to fund it.
[01:21.560 --> 01:24.760]  The same pernicious group runs the United States.
[01:24.760 --> 01:28.200]  He is scheduled to be joining us in the next hour.
[01:28.200 --> 01:32.160]  Then we've got Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, who pops in every Friday with
[01:32.160 --> 01:33.680]  us in the third hour.
[01:33.680 --> 01:41.880]  And then John Young of Crypto.org, shot down without a court order by Microsoft, a website
[01:41.880 --> 01:42.880]  gone.
[01:42.880 --> 01:50.160]  Really, it's a type of predecessor, something like WikiLeaks, also under attack for anyone
[01:50.160 --> 02:04.840]  denying that we're dealing with Internet censorship, expanding on a routine increment.
[02:04.840 --> 02:07.880]  So that is coming up today.
[02:07.880 --> 02:13.440]  In news, Obama says bipartisan health deal may not be possible.
[02:13.440 --> 02:16.040]  And of course, they first said that his health bill was invincible.
[02:16.040 --> 02:17.040]  No one could stop it.
[02:17.040 --> 02:18.160]  Now it's in deep trouble.
[02:18.160 --> 02:19.920]  Now he says, again, it's invincible.
[02:19.920 --> 02:21.520]  He will be assimilated.
[02:21.520 --> 02:24.120]  They're going to pass it next week.
[02:24.120 --> 02:26.120]  But let's hope and pray that is not the case.
[02:26.120 --> 02:28.920]  It looks like it may not pass.
[02:28.920 --> 02:36.000]  Of course, they played possum for a few months because there was massive resistance cresting
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  against it.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.480]  And so they played possum until everybody kind of dissipated their energy.
[02:43.480 --> 02:45.040]  And then now they're back.
[02:45.040 --> 02:48.360]  And they're back with the climate bill that already passed the House, what, six months
[02:48.360 --> 02:49.360]  ago.
[02:49.360 --> 02:57.200]  But in the U.S. Senate, open world government, open home inspections, you don't fix what
[02:57.200 --> 02:59.720]  the feds say they want repaired.
[02:59.720 --> 03:04.080]  And their new zoning laws arbitrary gives a blank check of power to the government.
[03:04.080 --> 03:06.160]  You'll be turned out of your house within five days.
[03:06.160 --> 03:07.800]  The home will be taken.
[03:07.800 --> 03:14.960]  No judge, no jury, no court, 35 federal agencies with Godlike power, taxes on everything, water,
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.960]  power, light bulbs.
[03:16.960 --> 03:24.320]  Just meat, just unlimited blank check to ravenously take over society.
[03:24.320 --> 03:28.560]  Everyone had better get follow the Republic out to their friends and family and neighbors.
[03:28.560 --> 03:31.920]  So they realize what this environmentalism really is.
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.200]  It's about a bunch of crooks running your life and sucking you dry and deciding who
[03:36.200 --> 03:42.560]  can have a business and who can.
[03:42.560 --> 03:54.640]  Now, again, everyone needs to get fall of the Republic.
[03:54.640 --> 04:00.560]  It details their entire agenda, the whole thing in two hours and 25 minutes.
[04:00.560 --> 04:07.080]  You don't have to buy the DVD at info wars.com and support us.
[04:07.080 --> 04:09.320]  You can go to YouTube.
[04:09.320 --> 04:11.080]  There's hundreds of versions of it up there.
[04:11.080 --> 04:13.120]  There's a director's channel.
[04:13.120 --> 04:16.520]  Change the channels, the name of the channel that has it in pretty good quality up there
[04:16.520 --> 04:17.520]  for free.
[04:17.520 --> 04:24.120]  I suggest you keep hammering that link out to everyone you know, because if you think
[04:24.120 --> 04:31.720]  the economy is bad now under globalization and NAFTA and GATT, this is only the beginning.
[04:31.720 --> 04:35.160]  And Reed says he's bullish on climate bill.
[04:35.160 --> 04:37.280]  He says they can ram it through in the next few weeks.
[04:37.280 --> 04:42.000]  They know they're losing approval rating numbers every day.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.960]  And so they want their entire agenda through.
[04:44.960 --> 04:53.520]  They are a group of revolutionary crooks, viperous, lecherous, vermin, enemies of everything
[04:53.520 --> 04:55.560]  good.
[04:55.560 --> 05:00.080]  The grandchildren of Joe Stalin will be right back.
[05:00.080 --> 05:04.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:04.720 --> 05:09.080]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:09.080 --> 05:13.400]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:13.400 --> 05:14.720]  allows you to have.
[05:14.720 --> 05:15.720]  It's true.
[05:15.720 --> 05:20.400]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[05:20.400 --> 05:24.760]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[05:24.760 --> 05:28.760]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:28.760 --> 05:32.240]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[05:32.240 --> 05:35.960]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[05:35.960 --> 05:40.720]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[05:40.720 --> 05:44.480]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[05:44.480 --> 05:45.880]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[05:45.880 --> 05:50.120]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[05:50.120 --> 05:51.840]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[05:51.840 --> 06:02.080]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[06:02.080 --> 06:06.080]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[06:06.080 --> 06:09.240]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[06:09.240 --> 06:13.600]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[06:13.600 --> 06:14.600]  at home.
[06:14.600 --> 06:19.240]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are
[06:19.240 --> 06:20.240]  calling the shots.
[06:20.240 --> 06:25.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[06:25.560 --> 06:31.600]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent
[06:31.600 --> 06:35.720]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[06:35.720 --> 06:40.080]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[06:40.080 --> 06:42.240]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[06:42.240 --> 06:47.600]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[06:47.600 --> 06:49.440]  a fall of the Republic.
[06:49.440 --> 06:53.880]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[06:53.880 --> 06:59.280]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:59.280 --> 07:02.400]  Hi everyone, Andy Anderson here.
[07:02.400 --> 07:06.120]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other
[07:06.120 --> 07:07.120]  nasties?
[07:07.120 --> 07:10.800]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknob, shopping carts,
[07:10.800 --> 07:12.640]  and handrails we touch every day.
[07:12.640 --> 07:16.960]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[07:16.960 --> 07:18.920]  No more protection till you use it again.
[07:18.920 --> 07:20.160]  Pure Works to the rescue.
[07:20.160 --> 07:24.600]  Our FDA compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[07:24.600 --> 07:29.600]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours, Pure Works disinfecting spray is EPA certified
[07:29.600 --> 07:35.280]  to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills
[07:35.280 --> 07:40.040]  C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, moles and fungus too, so even
[07:40.040 --> 07:41.480]  safe around pets and children.
[07:41.480 --> 07:44.640]  You'll love how your skin feels with Pure Works soft and supple.
[07:44.640 --> 07:45.640]  No more dry skin.
[07:45.640 --> 07:50.520]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ free hours later.
[07:50.520 --> 07:56.680]  Call now toll free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on Pure Works and get Pure Works on
[07:56.680 --> 07:57.680]  your hands.
[07:57.680 --> 07:58.680]  That's 888-245-0300.
[07:58.680 --> 08:03.680]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[08:03.680 --> 08:08.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:08.280 --> 08:09.280]  It is Friday.
[08:09.280 --> 08:13.880]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:13.880 --> 08:21.960]  The political tried and trusted tactic of a unpopular establishment, when their agenda
[08:21.960 --> 08:27.400]  is in trouble to roll over and play possum for a few months, they've done that and they
[08:27.400 --> 08:34.560]  said they're trying to pass the healthcare power grab, the giant tax, which then gives
[08:34.560 --> 08:40.720]  liability protection to the big Asia Moes and insurance companies, father stocks have
[08:40.720 --> 08:45.240]  all been shooting up on word that it may pass.
[08:45.240 --> 08:49.200]  And of course raises your taxes and cuts Medicare and Medicaid, just like the banker
[08:49.200 --> 08:54.480]  bailout wasn't for getting the mortgage market going again.
[08:54.480 --> 08:59.000]  One day after they passed the October 3rd, 2008, they did a bait and switch and said,
[08:59.000 --> 09:00.560]  oh, we're not going to spend it on that.
[09:00.560 --> 09:04.920]  We're not going to tell you what we're going to spend it on.
[09:04.920 --> 09:12.120]  When I get up here and I say that this is a group of lawless treasonous treacherous scum.
[09:12.120 --> 09:13.960]  We are not exaggerating.
[09:13.960 --> 09:14.960]  We are not joking.
[09:14.960 --> 09:22.440]  This is an absolutely rogue government stealing everything they can get their hands on.
[09:22.440 --> 09:26.400]  And I know you know that as listeners, but we better get the word out to the general
[09:26.400 --> 09:27.400]  public.
[09:27.400 --> 09:29.440]  Sure.
[09:29.440 --> 09:34.840]  The government has the lowest approval rating, according to Rasmussen, another major poll
[09:34.840 --> 09:37.240]  is across the board.
[09:37.240 --> 09:42.080]  In some polls, the government has as low as an 8% across the board approval rating, the
[09:42.080 --> 09:47.480]  lowest in history, but they don't care.
[09:47.480 --> 09:49.440]  They're going for broke.
[09:49.440 --> 09:51.440]  They've got Homeland Security.
[09:51.440 --> 09:54.240]  They've got Northcom and the Pentagon standing by.
[09:54.240 --> 09:55.920]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[09:55.920 --> 10:03.560]  They are squeezing everyone into oblivion and they're just getting started.
[10:03.560 --> 10:10.240]  Harry Reid, the little slime ball, says he's bullish on climate bill.
[10:10.240 --> 10:13.960]  That's out of Mother Jones.
[10:13.960 --> 10:14.960]  And it continues.
[10:14.960 --> 10:18.760]  Does John Kerry have good reason to be so optimistic about a climate bill?
[10:18.760 --> 10:22.920]  The Washington Post reports that he's getting strong signals that Senate Majority Leader
[10:22.920 --> 10:30.000]  Harry Reid wants a bill ASAP indicating that senators might be closer to a deal on the climate
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.400]  and energy than many people around Washington have assumed.
[10:34.400 --> 10:38.840]  They don't care if for a month DC has been buried by record snow.
[10:38.840 --> 10:46.600]  They don't care if India, China, the United States, England, Latin America, just the whole
[10:46.600 --> 10:52.600]  planet is having some of the coldest temperatures in a half century.
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.480]  It doesn't matter if the UN has been disgraced and had to admit that the earth hasn't been
[10:57.480 --> 11:02.440]  warming since 1995 and has been cooling since 2000.
[11:02.440 --> 11:08.000]  They say that's because of the warming and we're going forward with everything.
[11:08.000 --> 11:16.720]  And the Austin City Council says we're going to get started with taxes 2.6 billion in three
[11:16.720 --> 11:17.720]  years.
[11:17.720 --> 11:23.360]  We're going to double your power in gas bill.
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.960]  And a big Chinese company, they're saying the second biggest solar maker in China is
[11:27.960 --> 11:31.360]  coming to Austin to help run it all and help set it up.
[11:31.360 --> 11:32.360]  That's right.
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.840]  The city of Austin says they're going to give them tax incentives.
[11:34.840 --> 11:38.640]  No property taxes, no nothing to move here.
[11:38.640 --> 11:43.320]  And then Austin is going to hand them the money with Al Gore and others as the investors
[11:43.320 --> 11:48.040]  to build the giant solar farms to run Austin.
[11:48.040 --> 11:50.040]  Yes.
[11:50.040 --> 11:55.840]  You see, it isn't just that they tax the tried and true cheap energy sources.
[11:55.840 --> 12:03.240]  They then take your money and give it to themselves in boondoggles.
[12:03.240 --> 12:12.240]  Microcosm of the town I live in, 75 million a year, spent on all road repair and construction
[12:12.240 --> 12:20.000]  and maintenance, 150 million spent on the buses that 1% of Austin uses.
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.000]  But see, that's a special sweetheart contract with their little pals, the private company
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.160]  that runs it.
[12:27.160 --> 12:28.520]  And so that's the way it is.
[12:28.520 --> 12:32.720]  And they say that they're going to try to up it to 300 million in the next five years
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.000]  and that they want another 100 million a year program for rail.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.200]  That's only three rail lines that no one will be able to get to.
[12:43.200 --> 12:49.960]  Because the United States modern cities are set up in a sprawling format based on highways.
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.440]  And that's just where the globalists want us.
[12:53.440 --> 12:58.680]  They've got us dependent on the cars and on the fuel and they're going to jack up the
[12:58.680 --> 13:05.440]  prices on that and slap taxes on it and then put trains in that no one literally will ride.
[13:05.440 --> 13:11.080]  Most of the buses are completely empty and just laugh and hire more cops and set up more
[13:11.080 --> 13:12.640]  warrantless checkpoints.
[13:12.640 --> 13:16.920]  Darwin Veddiker, the local gun show operator in Texas, called me up two days ago and said,
[13:16.920 --> 13:21.960]  Alex, I just drove through on a major road in San Antonio, a warrantless checkpoint,
[13:21.960 --> 13:22.960]  searching cars.
[13:22.960 --> 13:25.600]  He goes, I thought that was illegal.
[13:25.600 --> 13:32.640]  It is, but they got the guns and they got your money and they're going to take even
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.240]  more of it because they want you bankrupt.
[13:37.240 --> 13:42.040]  And the illegal aliens are all above the law and get all the welfare they want and can't
[13:42.040 --> 13:47.240]  be arrested for any basic crime or drunk driving or even robbery, or they're released
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.160]  if they do get arrested and the cops are chastised because they're here to drive down the wages
[13:52.160 --> 13:54.480]  and bankrupt things even more.
[13:54.480 --> 14:00.160]  The bankers like us bankrupt and they're just running up the tab, running up the bill,
[14:00.160 --> 14:05.760]  all made up fiat currency, but you're going to pay it and a jackboot's going to shake
[14:05.760 --> 14:13.240]  that out of you because this is government by mafia or mafia.
[14:13.240 --> 14:16.640]  Until I'm angry and I'm upset, yeah, we're having big victories against them.
[14:16.640 --> 14:18.560]  We've discredited the crooks.
[14:18.560 --> 14:22.920]  They're in trouble, but you're going to have to fight and fight and fight and go to your
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.760]  city councils and your state houses and call them to talk radio and put out newsletters
[14:27.760 --> 14:33.440]  and put up websites and make your own films and get my films and make copies of them.
[14:33.440 --> 14:39.160]  If every American would sit down and watch fall of the Republic professionally produced
[14:39.160 --> 14:43.800]  covers the entire globalist agenda from their own words, how the heart of their takeover
[14:43.800 --> 14:47.200]  is the global fake environmental movement.
[14:47.200 --> 14:56.840]  If every American would see this, there's no way they could get their agenda through.
[14:56.840 --> 15:05.440]  A couple days ago, my children were over at a friend's house and they'd been water coloring
[15:05.440 --> 15:11.400]  and they went over to the sink when they were told to wash up their paints and the little
[15:11.400 --> 15:15.960]  kids were telling them that they'd committed a crime using water because they learned that
[15:15.960 --> 15:16.960]  in school.
[15:16.960 --> 15:25.200]  It's just everywhere, everywhere, just total brainwashing.
[15:25.200 --> 15:27.680]  Everything will be illegal, everything will be controlled.
[15:27.680 --> 15:38.880]  When you watch those Audi ads about the green police of it's so much fun, the green police.
[15:38.880 --> 15:43.080]  When you see that them swarming homes, arresting people for the wrong light bulbs or accidentally
[15:43.080 --> 15:48.800]  throwing a Duracell battery in the trash or for being in a hot tub, that is all going
[15:48.800 --> 15:49.800]  to be illegal.
[15:49.800 --> 15:51.280]  You think I'm joking?
[15:51.280 --> 15:52.640]  It's in the New York Times.
[15:52.640 --> 15:55.800]  That's all over the news, they're training kids to come home and write mock tickets from
[15:55.800 --> 16:00.200]  public school that really reports on their parents about taking a hot bath or leaving
[16:00.200 --> 16:02.680]  the water running while they brush their teeth.
[16:02.680 --> 16:08.080]  I told you a few months ago in France, the government said we had 154 husbands or wives
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.680]  killed in 2008.
[16:09.680 --> 16:11.680]  This was in 2009.
[16:11.680 --> 16:17.720]  They started reporting it and so if anyone has ever seen raising their voice, they will
[16:17.720 --> 16:18.720]  be arrested.
[16:18.720 --> 16:24.960]  And if you raise your voice at your child and they run out in the street, Bobby, Bill,
[16:24.960 --> 16:30.880]  David, Jack, whatever your son or daughter's name is, don't be in the street.
[16:30.880 --> 16:33.280]  I told you not to.
[16:33.280 --> 16:37.520]  Ah, CPS is coming.
[16:37.520 --> 16:41.560]  And now it's in the BBC and the New York Times reporting it like it's good.
[16:41.560 --> 16:42.880]  Does America need this?
[16:42.880 --> 16:44.640]  Does England need this?
[16:44.640 --> 16:50.680]  If a husband, it's only men, is seen raising his voice to his wife, that is abuse and the
[16:50.680 --> 16:57.880]  children will be taken and the husband will wear a tracking bracelet on their leg.
[16:57.880 --> 17:02.120]  And when you have a baby, there will be cameras put in every room of your home and you will
[17:02.120 --> 17:03.560]  be watched.
[17:03.560 --> 17:10.760]  And if you do one thing ever, if that toddler ever climbs up on a chair and falls off, your
[17:10.760 --> 17:15.960]  child is going to a dirty orphanage where the pedophile government's going to have
[17:15.960 --> 17:18.600]  their way with them.
[17:18.600 --> 17:23.840]  You think I'm joking around about the scum and the trash and the unmitigated evil filth
[17:23.840 --> 17:27.920]  that infest government and how they're taking over society.
[17:27.920 --> 17:31.880]  Let's go out to break with the Green Police brainwashing.
[17:31.880 --> 17:36.160]  This guy comes in and asks for plastic bags and the cops slam his head in the counter and
[17:36.160 --> 17:37.160]  take him to jail.
[17:37.160 --> 17:42.640]  We're the, but it's all a friendly, we're the Green Police, la, la, la, la, la.
[17:42.640 --> 17:43.640]  Paper plastic.
[17:43.640 --> 17:44.640]  Plastic.
[17:44.640 --> 17:45.640]  That's the magic word.
[17:45.640 --> 17:46.640]  Green police.
[17:46.640 --> 17:50.640]  You picked the wrong day to mess with the ecosystem, plastic boy.
[17:50.640 --> 17:51.640]  Battery.
[17:51.640 --> 17:52.640]  Battery.
[17:52.640 --> 17:53.640]  Let's go.
[17:53.640 --> 17:54.640]  Take that out.
[17:54.640 --> 17:55.640]  Come on.
[17:55.640 --> 17:56.640]  It's a Soviet together.
[17:56.640 --> 17:57.640]  Sure.
[17:57.640 --> 18:04.640]  We can't wait to punch you in pants and shoot you in the back of the head with a parasite
[18:04.640 --> 18:05.640]  scum.
[18:05.640 --> 18:06.640]  Two Soviet bulbs.
[18:06.640 --> 18:11.240]  Tragedy strikes tonight where a man has just been arrested for possession of an incandescent
[18:11.240 --> 18:12.240]  light bulb.
[18:12.240 --> 18:14.320]  What do you guys think about plastic bottles now?
[18:14.320 --> 18:16.320]  The water setting is at 105.
[18:16.320 --> 18:23.320]  You got a TDI here?
[18:23.320 --> 18:24.320]  Clean diesel.
[18:24.320 --> 18:25.320]  You're good to go, sir.
[18:25.320 --> 18:26.320]  Think of the brainwashing.
[18:26.320 --> 18:27.320]  Think of the magnitude of the evil.
[18:27.320 --> 18:28.320]  We're going to tell you if you can have a bath.
[18:28.320 --> 18:29.320]  We're going to tell you what you can do.
[18:29.320 --> 18:40.960]  We're going to spy on you.
[18:40.960 --> 18:46.120]  Every control freak in the world will be turned loose to run your life.
[18:46.120 --> 18:51.520]  All the narcissistic, lazy scum that couldn't get a job, couldn't build a business, who
[18:51.520 --> 18:56.560]  think entrepreneurs are bad, who hate anyone that has two pennies to rub together.
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.640]  All being given uniforms and weapons, though they're training them for this in all the
[19:01.640 --> 19:03.440]  colleges right now.
[19:03.440 --> 19:04.920]  It's already happening everywhere.
[19:04.920 --> 19:09.240]  This ad is not a joke and the San Francisco mayor came out and admitted a company he works
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.000]  with and San Francisco produced it and that this is what they want.
[19:13.000 --> 19:14.840]  This is what they're going to do.
[19:14.840 --> 19:16.680]  This is who they are.
[19:16.680 --> 19:23.320]  You're going to be their slaves now and all the lazy trash is going to be given weapons
[19:23.320 --> 19:28.920]  and power over you, the producers, and they're going to suck off you and never stop because
[19:28.920 --> 19:33.920]  they're greedy, degenerate, filthy trash.
[19:33.920 --> 19:40.200]  If you won't wake up and get angry and understand what's happening historically, then you deserve
[19:40.200 --> 19:46.760]  the raping they're going to give you and their parasite hordes of lazy, power-tripping control
[19:46.760 --> 19:49.360]  freak scum.
[19:49.360 --> 19:52.000]  We're going to break down all the news straight ahead.
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.720]  The healthcare takeover, the environmental takeover, and secret UN documents now mainstream
[19:57.720 --> 19:58.720]  news.
[19:58.720 --> 20:00.600]  Stay with us.
[20:00.600 --> 20:05.920]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[20:05.920 --> 20:06.920]  company?
[20:06.920 --> 20:07.920]  Don't.
[20:07.920 --> 20:10.760]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[20:10.760 --> 20:11.760]  Why pay?
[20:11.760 --> 20:16.920]  When you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author
[20:16.920 --> 20:22.920]  Herb K's number one debt secret, the how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt
[20:22.920 --> 20:23.920]  companies.
[20:23.920 --> 20:27.120]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[20:27.120 --> 20:28.120]  Here's Herb K.

[20:32.280 --> 20:34.360]  to do it yourself for free.
[20:34.360 --> 20:35.640]  Herb K was right.
[20:35.640 --> 20:38.840]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[20:38.840 --> 20:40.280]  What have you got to lose?
[20:40.280 --> 20:43.920]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[20:43.920 --> 20:52.360]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now, call 888-352-7726.
[20:52.360 --> 20:53.360]  That's 888-352-7726.
[20:53.360 --> 20:54.360]  888-352-7726.
[20:54.360 --> 21:02.760]  Hi, this is Peter Crotch, novel with Midas Resources.
[21:02.760 --> 21:06.360]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result
[21:06.360 --> 21:07.520]  of the spending policy.
[21:07.520 --> 21:11.280]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive
[21:11.280 --> 21:14.200]  for AIG, large banking, or investment institution.
[21:14.200 --> 21:16.800]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[21:16.800 --> 21:19.360]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for bailout.
[21:19.360 --> 21:22.720]  Having your hard earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is
[21:22.720 --> 21:24.480]  a lose-lose proposition.
[21:24.480 --> 21:27.720]  Lose on your capital investment, and when you cash out, you're paid in the dollar that
[21:27.720 --> 21:29.280]  is losing value every day.
[21:29.280 --> 21:32.920]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no
[21:32.920 --> 21:35.600]  matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[21:35.600 --> 21:39.000]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.000]  can help.
[21:40.000 --> 21:46.000]  Today, Peter Crotch, NABL 800-686-2237, extension 108, and I'll take the time to personally
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.400]  put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[21:49.400 --> 21:52.880]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[21:52.880 --> 21:55.400]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[21:55.400 --> 22:02.120]  Call Peter Crotch, NABL 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[22:02.120 --> 22:06.160]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone, but this is our
[22:06.160 --> 22:09.000]  last chance to not relive history.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[22:13.360 --> 22:14.360]  at home.
[22:14.360 --> 22:19.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[22:19.000 --> 22:20.000]  calling the shots.
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.360]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[22:25.360 --> 22:30.840]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[22:30.840 --> 22:35.480]  held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[22:35.480 --> 22:37.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[22:37.920 --> 22:42.040]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[22:42.040 --> 22:47.440]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[22:47.440 --> 22:49.280]  a fall of the Republic.
[22:49.280 --> 22:53.720]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[23:58.600 --> 24:26.040]  We love you.
[24:26.040 --> 24:29.040]  And now I can talk about this.
[24:29.040 --> 24:33.480]  I know about this a little while back, but you told me I could talk about it yesterday.
[24:33.480 --> 24:41.600]  We're going to have the world premiere of his new album here on air.
[24:41.600 --> 24:47.760]  And guess who does spoken word throughout the album?
[24:47.760 --> 24:52.000]  Shooter Jennings, son of Waylon Jennings, a very successful musician and his own writer
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.880]  is Willie Nelson, you name it.
[24:55.880 --> 24:57.640]  Stephen King.
[24:57.640 --> 25:03.440]  Stephen King is a big fan of shooter Jennings.
[25:03.440 --> 25:06.120]  And guess what else I found out?
[25:06.120 --> 25:09.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[25:09.200 --> 25:13.040]  Stephen King likes my radio show and what we're doing here.
[25:13.040 --> 25:20.760]  And it's a Stephen King anti-New World Order rant at the beginning of each of the 14 tracks.
[25:20.760 --> 25:32.200]  One word by Stephen King on the New World Order premiering here Monday.
[25:32.200 --> 25:38.320]  And King's working on some projects right now, but there is a good chance we're going
[25:38.320 --> 25:44.840]  to get him on the air in the future live with Shooter who knows might even happen Monday.
[25:44.840 --> 25:49.080]  I mean, that is so exciting.
[25:49.080 --> 25:51.080]  Stephen King.
[25:51.080 --> 25:54.240]  No one's books have been made into more movies.
[25:54.240 --> 25:58.520]  And of course, you know, he wrote The Running Man, what was it in the late seventies and
[25:58.520 --> 26:02.560]  they made it into a movie in 86, 85.
[26:02.560 --> 26:06.720]  The Running Man, who loves you and who do you love?
[26:06.720 --> 26:10.960]  Connray kids remember November is recruitment month.
[26:10.960 --> 26:14.240]  Report a family member and get a double bonus credit.
[26:14.240 --> 26:19.720]  Everyone caught outside after dark without their proper pass will be permanently detained.
[26:19.720 --> 26:27.240]  The Running Man and every other big movie, total expert on the New World Order Stephen
[26:27.240 --> 26:28.240]  King.
[26:28.240 --> 26:32.000]  I mean, just everybody knows.
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.720]  I got contacted yesterday by another huge movie star and I'm going to be hooking up
[26:37.720 --> 26:38.720]  with them.
[26:38.720 --> 26:42.280]  They're coming here during South by Southwest, they contacted me and I'm going to try to
[26:42.280 --> 26:50.360]  get them on the show in the next few weeks, maybe even in studio.
[26:50.360 --> 26:52.080]  And again, why is that important?
[26:52.080 --> 26:56.400]  Because this is a culture drunk on entertainment, drunk on media icons.
[26:56.400 --> 27:02.840]  And when these big stars and writers and people come out against the New World Order, it just
[27:02.840 --> 27:05.000]  shows how we are the majority.
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.720]  And that's the last domino to fall.
[27:10.720 --> 27:13.040]  And yes, it's very successful.
[27:13.040 --> 27:18.880]  It's very effective to have all these big movie stars and icon writers and others coming
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.040]  out against the New World Order, as if you couldn't read all of King's books and already
[27:23.040 --> 27:28.720]  know that a secret government group releases the flu to depopulate the planet.
[27:28.720 --> 27:31.640]  What he wrote that 20 years ago.
[27:31.640 --> 27:32.640]  I read that book.
[27:32.640 --> 27:33.640]  I've read so many of them.
[27:33.640 --> 27:34.640]  I forget the name.
[27:34.640 --> 27:40.440]  What's the what's the one where they released the like this evil guy?
[27:40.440 --> 27:44.280]  He's basically the devil, but he releases flu to kill the majority.
[27:44.280 --> 27:45.280]  The stand.
[27:45.280 --> 27:46.280]  Yeah.
[27:46.280 --> 27:50.360]  I mean, this guy, but you can just already know Stephen King knew about this when I was
[27:50.360 --> 27:52.920]  in diapers.
[27:52.920 --> 28:01.440]  So we can't say Alex Jones woke Stephen King up.
[28:01.440 --> 28:11.400]  But but every time we get more successful, it just makes the government and the mainstream
[28:11.400 --> 28:15.920]  media and the jealous alternative haters go that much more crazy.
[28:15.920 --> 28:20.560]  I don't know why you guys get so upset and so jealous about me and make up new lies more
[28:20.560 --> 28:23.880]  ridiculous in the last every day.
[28:23.880 --> 28:30.280]  Some of you out there because we're literally waking the planet up and if you're little
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.360]  parasites that just want to be stars, you ought to be happy.
[28:33.360 --> 28:36.760]  There wouldn't even this movement wouldn't be one half as big as it is right now, but
[28:36.760 --> 28:44.520]  wasn't for all the work I've done and all the work my listeners have done.
[28:44.520 --> 28:46.880]  See I have a real goal to bring down the new world order.
[28:46.880 --> 28:52.040]  I don't want to pay 2.6 billion in Austin the next three years on carbon taxes.
[28:52.040 --> 28:53.720]  I'm upset about being a slave.
[28:53.720 --> 28:57.240]  I don't want to lose my granddaddy's rifle I've got.
[28:57.240 --> 28:58.400]  That's why I do what I do.
[28:58.400 --> 29:00.840]  That's why I can go four hours and not take one call.
[29:00.840 --> 29:04.680]  I can do 10 hours because I have real passion.
[29:04.680 --> 29:13.400]  I really care about what I'm doing and so I get the stardom you so crave and you don't
[29:13.400 --> 29:19.560]  get it because you're not in this for the right reasons and let me tell you my rising
[29:19.560 --> 29:25.240]  star as people call it is actually a burden and I don't like it, but I do like the by
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.160]  product of it meaning I'm having success against the new world order.
[29:29.160 --> 29:33.880]  I'm walking point ladies and gentlemen and we're making all the right connections that
[29:33.880 --> 29:39.080]  can bring down this new world order and they know it and the establishment media has identified
[29:39.080 --> 29:46.840]  me as the numero uno enemy of the new world order program because I got their number and
[29:46.840 --> 29:51.080]  I'm not backing down I keep on a cuff.
[29:51.080 --> 29:52.360]  We're on the march.
[29:52.360 --> 30:02.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.040]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[30:06.040 --> 30:10.880]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[30:10.880 --> 30:14.880]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[30:14.880 --> 30:19.480]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[30:19.480 --> 30:24.720]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[30:24.720 --> 30:31.600]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[30:31.600 --> 30:35.040]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[30:35.040 --> 30:40.640]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[30:40.640 --> 30:45.880]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple.
[30:45.880 --> 30:52.160]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[30:52.160 --> 31:02.280]  Lungs Generator that's www.silverlungs.com.
[31:02.280 --> 31:05.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[31:05.600 --> 31:09.160]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[31:09.160 --> 31:13.520]  As we're finishing off this agenda we'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[31:13.520 --> 31:14.520]  at home.
[31:14.520 --> 31:19.680]  We've turned immense influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[31:19.680 --> 31:20.680]  shots.
[31:20.680 --> 31:25.520]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[31:25.520 --> 31:31.560]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent
[31:31.560 --> 31:35.680]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[31:35.680 --> 31:40.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[31:40.160 --> 31:42.200]  saying who do we make the checkout to?
[31:42.200 --> 31:48.120]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[31:48.120 --> 31:49.400]  of the Republic.
[31:49.400 --> 31:53.880]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[31:53.880 --> 32:00.880]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[32:00.880 --> 32:05.320]  Is garlic the absolute best defense against the threat of bacterial and viral pandemics?
[32:05.320 --> 32:06.320]  No.
[32:06.320 --> 32:08.880]  The answer is Alley C from your Alleystore.com.
[32:08.880 --> 32:13.160]  Alley C was developed by a British chemist who found a way to stabilize the allicin and
[32:13.160 --> 32:17.640]  garlic and incorporate it into his flagship product Alley C. It's the strongest and safest
[32:17.640 --> 32:19.160]  antibiotic known to man.
[32:19.160 --> 32:21.640]  Alley C makes garlic supplements obsolete.
[32:21.640 --> 32:24.480]  Get Alley C today from yourAlleystore.com.
[32:24.480 --> 32:28.200]  That's yourALLIstore.com, yourAlleystore.com.
[32:28.200 --> 32:29.960]  No home should be without Alley C.
[32:29.960 --> 32:31.480]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[32:31.480 --> 32:35.240]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[32:35.240 --> 32:36.240]  IRAs?
[32:36.240 --> 32:40.760]  It's been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold
[32:40.760 --> 32:41.920]  for your retirement.
[32:41.920 --> 32:45.440]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[32:45.440 --> 32:50.400]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[32:50.400 --> 32:56.280]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237.
[32:56.280 --> 32:59.960]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[32:59.960 --> 33:11.800]  Yeah, Stephen King on the team.
[33:11.800 --> 33:12.800]  This is the end.
[33:12.800 --> 33:13.800]  This is the end.
[33:13.800 --> 33:14.800]  My only friend.
[33:14.800 --> 33:15.800]  The end.
[33:15.800 --> 33:16.800]  Of our elaborate plans.
[33:16.800 --> 33:17.800]  The end.
[33:17.800 --> 33:18.800]  Of our elaborate plans.
[33:18.800 --> 33:43.920]  The end of everything that stands the end, no safety or surprise the end, I'll never
[33:43.920 --> 33:48.600]  look into your eyes again.
[33:48.600 --> 33:54.400]  Peter Rowland of Gilead finally scales the black tower.
[33:54.400 --> 34:10.000]  He is transported back to ten years before riding through a desert to carry out his
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.240]  journey yet again.
[34:14.240 --> 34:30.520]  As for every ending, there is a new beginning.
[34:30.520 --> 34:38.040]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time, we are live.
[34:38.040 --> 34:42.560]  Thank you for joining us.
[34:42.560 --> 34:51.440]  Don't forget, listeners, the new free iPhone app, five-star rating over 205-star ratings,
[34:51.440 --> 34:55.160]  five-star free app.
[34:55.160 --> 34:57.520]  Most of the free apps have got one and a half stars.
[34:57.520 --> 34:58.840]  It's five stars.
[34:58.840 --> 35:02.600]  It's free.
[35:02.600 --> 35:08.320]  And it's available right now for free download at infowars.com.
[35:08.320 --> 35:13.000]  I know 20,000 of you downloaded it in the last two weeks, that is nothing.
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.200]  We need everybody out there who has friends and family that have iPhones to email them
[35:17.200 --> 35:20.960]  the link to the iPhone store where it's free.
[35:20.960 --> 35:24.040]  And say, hey, I sent you this free link to this radio show.
[35:24.040 --> 35:26.280]  It's got key information you need to know about.
[35:26.280 --> 35:29.520]  That's just another little way to reach people.
[35:29.520 --> 35:35.040]  And sure, in a year from now, we'll have 300, 400, 500,000 people that have downloaded it.
[35:35.040 --> 35:42.600]  We need to have that a month, not in a year.
[35:42.600 --> 35:47.000]  Because the last domino to fall, the new world order illusion, is that those of us that know
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.160]  this system is a fraud and parasitic are a minority.
[35:52.160 --> 35:55.320]  We are not a minority.
[35:55.320 --> 35:59.880]  We are the majority.
[35:59.880 --> 36:02.200]  And there's a revolution going on in Hollywood.
[36:02.200 --> 36:09.280]  You heard Michael Braverman, TV producer in Hollywood, Jesse Ventura's manager.
[36:09.280 --> 36:13.600]  You heard him without me even prompting him on the show a few months ago.
[36:13.600 --> 36:18.080]  Say that he can't believe all the top Hollywood stars that have called him, but are afraid
[36:18.080 --> 36:19.920]  to come out against the new world order.
[36:19.920 --> 36:21.520]  They're sick of the left, right paradigm.
[36:21.520 --> 36:23.560]  They don't want to be known as leftists.
[36:23.560 --> 36:25.200]  They don't want to be known as right wingers.
[36:25.200 --> 36:28.000]  They don't choose those two labels.
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.400]  They are pro-liberty, anti-new world order.
[36:33.400 --> 36:39.920]  But that the kingpins in Hollywood, like Steven Spielberg, will try to blackball them or crush
[36:39.920 --> 36:42.160]  them, no matter how big they are.
[36:42.160 --> 36:50.400]  If they come out and say, we're not part of this false paradigm, it is the majority of
[36:50.400 --> 37:04.320]  top writers who know about the new world order.
[37:04.320 --> 37:08.040]  It is the majority of people in Hollywood.
[37:08.040 --> 37:09.960]  You say, well, why is that important?
[37:09.960 --> 37:16.680]  Because the media has made that God and made that the arbiter of style and culture and
[37:16.680 --> 37:25.120]  our rudder, and they've used a false image of Hollywood to sell dehumanization and torture
[37:25.120 --> 37:30.120]  porn and tyranny and mindlessness.
[37:30.120 --> 37:36.120]  They've steered rap and hip hop into mindless devil tree.
[37:36.120 --> 37:40.920]  They've steered rock and roll in that direction and the entire culture and the people within
[37:40.920 --> 37:47.120]  those cultures don't like it and don't want to be part of it.
[37:47.120 --> 37:53.000]  And so the manifestation of the revolution against tyranny going on in the highest levels
[37:53.000 --> 38:03.400]  of the culture system shows this new world order is in deep, deep, deep crisis.
[38:03.400 --> 38:15.120]  I'm having one of those senior moments with who's the writer who wrote Jurassic Park and
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.840]  all the rest of my, I read the book, Michael Crichton, I read his book two years ago and
[38:20.840 --> 38:21.840]  then Googled him.
[38:21.840 --> 38:32.960]  I mean, I knew he was well from going back to some of his earliest science fiction works
[38:32.960 --> 38:38.840]  and he wrote a book about state of fear about phony environmentalist trillionaires secretly
[38:38.840 --> 38:42.720]  trying to bring in a world government and staging environmental catastrophes to push
[38:42.720 --> 38:43.720]  it through.
[38:43.720 --> 38:48.920]  And then he died of what was it, lung cancer.
[38:48.920 --> 38:49.920]  Michael Crichton.
[38:49.920 --> 39:01.680]  So I read more of his books, Total Anti-New World Order.
[39:01.680 --> 39:07.120]  When I pick up science fiction now, the top writers, it's all anti-new world order.
[39:07.120 --> 39:14.680]  When I have time to read it, it's just everywhere.
[39:14.680 --> 39:18.560]  But on the nightly news, they make us feel like we're the minority.
[39:18.560 --> 39:20.200]  They tell us we're all alone.
[39:20.200 --> 39:26.960]  They tell us we don't have any power when we do have incredible power.
[39:26.960 --> 39:35.280]  All right, here's the big breaking news today.
[39:35.280 --> 39:36.280]  Read bullish on climate bill.
[39:36.280 --> 39:39.760]  They say they're going to try to pass it in the next month.
[39:39.760 --> 39:42.760]  Obama's bipartisan health deal may not be possible.
[39:42.760 --> 39:46.880]  He says he's going to try to ram it through next week.
[39:46.880 --> 39:48.280]  Call Congress.
[39:48.280 --> 39:49.600]  Call your House and Senate members.
[39:49.600 --> 39:52.200]  You tell them, do not do it.
[39:52.200 --> 40:00.640]  Or you don't care who is running against the incumbent.
[40:00.640 --> 40:01.640]  You're going to support them.
[40:01.640 --> 40:02.640]  I mean, go ahead.
[40:02.640 --> 40:11.160]  Vote for Deborah Medina, even if she threw 9-11 truth under the bus and said we were despicable.
[40:11.160 --> 40:15.520]  Rick Perry's got to go.
[40:15.520 --> 40:20.920]  But regardless, you run for city council, county commissioner, state house.
[40:20.920 --> 40:25.320]  Even if you don't win, you'll get up there in the debates and at the conferences and
[40:25.320 --> 40:28.000]  at the meetings and be able to speak the truth.
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.320]  Just get out there and take action.
[40:29.320 --> 40:33.420]  I get hundreds of calls and emails every day saying, Alex, I've got a secret plan.
[40:33.420 --> 40:37.320]  If you just do this, if you just do that, if we just launch this program, if you just
[40:37.320 --> 40:39.600]  travel the country, this would fix it.
[40:39.600 --> 40:43.720]  No, there is no silver bullet in Alex Jones.
[40:43.720 --> 40:48.000]  There's no silver bullet in Bob Smith.
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.360]  John Doe.
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.640]  That's the spirit of resistance and liberty, putting your body against the machinery of
[40:54.640 --> 40:57.080]  the tyrants.
[40:57.080 --> 41:04.880]  Little things done over and over again creates almost a harmonic shaking of the foundations
[41:04.880 --> 41:10.280]  of this control grid.
[41:10.280 --> 41:18.120]  We are being collectively baptized in tyranny now.
[41:18.120 --> 41:21.880]  Because they openly say, yes, we're listing everything you do on your phones without warrants.
[41:21.880 --> 41:23.720]  Yes, we're setting up warrantless checkpoints.
[41:23.720 --> 41:25.840]  Yes, we're shutting down gun shows without a law.
[41:25.840 --> 41:27.520]  Yes, we're taking your blood without warrants.
[41:27.520 --> 41:31.840]  Yes, we're taking your baby's blood at birth, repenting on bio weapon laboratory research.
[41:31.840 --> 41:36.560]  Yes, yes, we're going to arrest you for tiny environmental infractions.
[41:36.560 --> 41:38.680]  Yes, we're going to bankrupt you.
[41:38.680 --> 41:40.360]  Yes, we're going to launch new wars.
[41:40.360 --> 41:42.840]  Yes, we're going to put you through naked body scanners.
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.200]  Yes, we're going to arrest you for videotaping the police out on the open that's totally
[41:47.200 --> 41:48.200]  illegal.
[41:48.200 --> 41:49.840]  Yes, we're going to have federal courts ruled.
[41:49.840 --> 41:53.360]  There's no fourth amendment.
[41:53.360 --> 41:58.080]  They're just throwing down the gauntlet in your face and it's an attempt to buffalo
[41:58.080 --> 42:00.600]  you, to break your will.
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.400]  Don't let them do it.
[42:04.400 --> 42:09.440]  Even if they get part of their big agenda through that'll only make people more angry,
[42:09.440 --> 42:11.840]  more upset.
[42:11.840 --> 42:16.840]  But instead of backing off the new world order as their approval rating drops to 8 percent
[42:16.840 --> 42:27.240]  for government, the lowest ever by a mile, plunging.
[42:27.240 --> 42:28.240]  What do they do?
[42:28.240 --> 42:34.600]  They go all in and say, all right, we are tyrants.
[42:34.600 --> 42:41.280]  What are you going to do about it?
[42:41.280 --> 42:44.160]  What are you going to do about it?
[42:44.160 --> 42:51.600]  We're the conquerors and none of you are going to stand up here and fight us.
[42:51.600 --> 42:53.480]  None of you got what it takes.
[42:53.480 --> 42:59.080]  Well, you do have what it takes and they know it and they're getting more and more scared
[42:59.080 --> 43:01.440]  by the minute.
[43:01.440 --> 43:06.200]  They realize the sleeping giant is rising.
[43:06.200 --> 43:15.920]  They realize the human desire for liberty and freedom is pulsing with power, is burning
[43:15.920 --> 43:20.640]  in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[43:20.640 --> 43:27.520]  And I have come to light those fires of liberty in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[43:27.520 --> 43:35.840]  I have sworn on the altar of God Almighty, eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny
[43:35.840 --> 43:43.120]  over the minds of men.
[43:43.120 --> 43:56.920]  Prisonplanet.com headline, Prisonplanet.com headline, leaked UN documents reveal plan
[43:56.920 --> 43:59.440]  for green world order.
[43:59.440 --> 44:08.520]  That's a quote by 2012, the numerology, the numerology obsessed cultists are obsessed
[44:08.520 --> 44:17.240]  with that date and that date will come and it will pass and they will fail.
[44:17.240 --> 44:23.680]  Massive 45 trillion transfer of wealth to fund the creation of global governance.
[44:23.680 --> 44:26.680]  We have the internal UN report.
[44:26.680 --> 44:29.520]  It's in the AP, Fox News has got it.
[44:29.520 --> 44:38.320]  We break down the full spectrum analysis at prisonplanet.com, Paul Joseph Watson.
[44:38.320 --> 44:44.160]  Leaked policy documents reveal that the United Nations plans to create a green world order
[44:44.160 --> 44:50.960]  by 2012, which will be enforced by a structure of global governance and funded by a gargantuan
[44:50.960 --> 44:58.800]  45 trillion transfer of wealth from richer countries as the globalist insidious plan
[44:58.800 --> 45:06.640]  to centralize power, crush sovereignty while devastating the economy is exposed once again.
[45:06.640 --> 45:13.600]  As we warned at the time, the failure of Copenhagen in December did not spell the end of the
[45:13.600 --> 45:20.640]  global warming heist, but merely a roadblock in the UN's agenda to create a world government
[45:20.640 --> 45:31.480]  funded by taxes paid by you on the very substance you exhale carbon dioxide.
[45:31.480 --> 45:38.120]  Today carbon dioxide tomorrow the world.
[45:38.120 --> 45:45.360]  Using the justification of the vehemently debunked hoax that carbon dioxide is a deadly threat
[45:45.360 --> 45:53.760]  to the planet, the UN is already working to resurrect the failed Copenhagen agreement
[45:53.760 --> 46:01.480]  with a series of new Copenhagen process negotiations set to take place in April, May and June,
[46:01.480 --> 46:04.440]  culminating in Mexico City.
[46:04.440 --> 46:10.560]  Leaked planning documents, PDF obtained by Fox News, lift the lid off the UN's plan to
[46:10.560 --> 46:17.240]  impose global governance by the time of their 2012 World Summit on sustainable development
[46:17.240 --> 46:24.000]  in Rio, which will mark the 20th anniversary since the notorious Earth Summit held in the
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.840]  same city.
[46:26.840 --> 46:34.720]  The new Rio Summit will end according to UN documents obtained by Fox News with a focused
[46:34.720 --> 46:40.720]  political document, presumably laid out the framework and international commitments to
[46:40.720 --> 46:42.920]  a new green world order.
[46:42.920 --> 46:47.680]  Now, that's in the document, we have a copy, we go live at PrismPlanet.TV, I'll show it
[46:47.680 --> 46:51.440]  to the TV viewers, but it's up on PrismPlanet.com.
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.440]  The climateologist of NASA is saying a book published three months, and one of the head
[46:55.440 --> 47:09.920]  climatologists of NASA is saying a book published three months ago, the exact same words, we've
[47:09.920 --> 47:12.640]  got to get this information out to everybody.
[47:12.640 --> 47:17.600]  No one can stop you if you do it person to person with fall of the republic.
[47:17.600 --> 47:23.360]  And with this article, no one can stop you from getting the DVD and making copies of
[47:23.360 --> 47:25.440]  it and telling people to watch it.
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.640]  And you don't have to buy the DVD at infowars.com, you can Google fall of the republic.
[47:30.640 --> 47:35.600]  And the number one link is a YouTube channel with a million 300,000 views, just one of
[47:35.600 --> 47:37.440]  hundreds of postings of it.
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.960]  And you can get it out to everybody you know if you just have the simple will to warn them
[47:41.960 --> 47:43.960]  and explain what's happening.
[47:43.960 --> 47:48.400]  And go to your local school board and you tell them stop brainwashing children with
[47:48.400 --> 47:53.840]  this debunked sickening fraud.
[47:53.840 --> 47:58.880]  We have to route these people out and dig them out of their rat holes everywhere.
[47:58.880 --> 48:06.560]  They're a group of scallywag scum.
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.000]  Just exactly what the environmental order will look like and the extent of the immense
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.640]  financial commitments needed to produce under discussion this week at a special session in
[48:15.640 --> 48:21.640]  Bali, Indonesia of the United Nations Environment Program 58 Nation Governing Council Global
[48:21.640 --> 48:24.760]  Ministerial Environmental Forum.
[48:24.760 --> 48:28.040]  We already know we saw the Copenhagen Treaty, we know what it is.
[48:28.040 --> 48:36.920]  Taxes on everything, cars, air travel, food, water, which oversees in a total 2% GDP tax,
[48:36.920 --> 48:39.520]  which oversees the UNAP's operations.
[48:39.520 --> 48:44.560]  We heard Gordon Brown last week say it's going to be a global tax paid in a new global treaty
[48:44.560 --> 48:47.680]  of the banks who are openly our government now.
[48:47.680 --> 48:49.840]  Congress even admits the banks run us.
[48:49.840 --> 48:54.680]  They met in secret, they're hammering it out three weeks ago in Australia.
[48:54.680 --> 48:58.680]  The document outlines the globalist mission to enact a, quote, radical transformation
[48:58.680 --> 49:04.200]  of the world economic and social order by putting, quote, a new treaty in place as the
[49:04.200 --> 49:05.200]  capstone.
[49:05.200 --> 49:07.800]  Got to love those new world order quotes.
[49:07.800 --> 49:15.720]  This is from the document, a new treaty in place as the capstone of the green world order.
[49:15.720 --> 49:20.920]  The capstone of the pyramid is the environmental control grid, the capstone of their green
[49:20.920 --> 49:25.240]  world order, which is really blood red.
[49:25.240 --> 49:32.280]  Oh, these parasitic vampires want to totally lock us down, they're going to fail.
[49:32.280 --> 49:35.360]  The document outlines the globalist mission to enact a radical transformation of the world
[49:35.360 --> 49:41.360]  economic and social order by putting a new treaty in place as the capstone, I'm quoting.
[49:41.360 --> 49:45.440]  This is a quote, radical transformation of the world economic and social order by putting
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.720]  a new treaty in place as the capstone of the green world order, total social engineering.
[49:51.720 --> 49:57.720]  The system will be managed by, quote, an additional governing structure composed of exactly those
[49:57.720 --> 50:00.000]  insiders.
[50:00.000 --> 50:05.600]  Moving towards a green economy would also provide an opportunity to reexamine national
[50:05.600 --> 50:07.520]  and global governance structures.
[50:07.520 --> 50:08.520]  That's a quote.
[50:08.520 --> 50:11.880]  And consider whether such structures allow the international community to respond to
[50:11.880 --> 50:17.040]  current and future environmental development challenges and to capitalize on emerging opportunities.
[50:17.040 --> 50:26.080]  Just any new lies they want to make up, states the white paper, emphasis on the imposition
[50:26.080 --> 50:32.880]  of new global governance structures will be achieved with the help of, quote, vast wealth
[50:32.880 --> 50:42.880]  transfers, vast wealth transfers, alert, alert, criminal tyranny of the most devastating type
[50:42.880 --> 50:49.280]  of eugenics cult has seized control of the nation, alert, alert, the planet is falling
[50:49.280 --> 50:55.480]  into the sway of murdering psychopaths whose religious belief is in human sacrifice, mass
[50:55.480 --> 51:02.000]  war and death, alert, alert, warning, warning, they've breached the walls, they're inside.
[51:02.000 --> 51:07.400]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[51:07.400 --> 51:09.800]  Do you care as much about your air and water?

[51:31.480 --> 51:35.680]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[51:35.680 --> 51:39.920]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[51:39.920 --> 51:40.920]  to serve as debt.
[51:40.920 --> 51:44.440]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[51:44.440 --> 51:47.720]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[51:47.720 --> 51:52.040]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book, explains our monetary system.
[51:52.040 --> 51:55.280]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[51:55.280 --> 51:56.680]  It's time to understand the system.
[51:56.680 --> 52:03.720]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[52:03.720 --> 52:07.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[52:07.480 --> 52:10.640]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[52:10.640 --> 52:15.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.000]  at home.
[52:16.000 --> 52:21.120]  We've termed menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[52:21.120 --> 52:22.120]  shots.
[52:22.120 --> 52:26.840]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[52:26.840 --> 52:32.400]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[52:32.400 --> 52:37.080]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[52:37.080 --> 52:39.520]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[52:39.520 --> 52:43.640]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[52:43.640 --> 52:49.480]  They seem like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[52:49.480 --> 52:50.480]  of the Republic.

[53:03.720 --> 53:07.040]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading without the drugs?
[53:07.040 --> 53:08.880]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[53:08.880 --> 53:12.920]  Would it not be nice to have your heart beat regularly again to have a sex life again?

[54:01.200 --> 54:08.680]  When we had a president we'd see a giant global political figure, the man that would be the
[54:08.680 --> 54:14.240]  political leader for 500 million people, the man that would represent all of us on the
[54:14.240 --> 54:19.360]  world stage, the man whose job was so important that of course you're paid more than President
[54:19.360 --> 54:20.360]  Obama.
[54:20.360 --> 54:26.440]  Well, I'm afraid what we got was you and I'm sorry but after that performance earlier
[54:26.440 --> 54:34.640]  that you gave and I don't want to be rude but you know really you have the charisma
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.800]  of a damp rag and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk and the question that I want
[54:39.800 --> 54:46.120]  to ask, the question that I want to ask that we're all going to ask is who are you?
[54:46.120 --> 54:51.120]  I'd never heard of you, nobody in Europe had ever heard of you.
[54:51.120 --> 54:59.640]  I would like to ask you President, who voted for you and what mechanism, oh I know democracy
[54:59.640 --> 55:06.040]  is not popular with you lot and what mechanism do the peoples of Europe have to remove you?
[55:06.040 --> 55:14.320]  Is this European democracy, well I sense though that you're competent and capable and dangerous
[55:14.320 --> 55:20.200]  and I have no doubt that it's your intention to be the quiet assassin of European democracy
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.520]  and of the European nation states, you appear to have a loathing for the very concept of
[55:25.520 --> 55:31.160]  the existence of nation states, perhaps that's because you come from Belgium, which of course
[55:31.160 --> 55:39.600]  is pretty much a non-country, but since you took over we've seen Greece reduced to nothing
[55:39.600 --> 55:45.880]  more than a protectorate, sir you have no legitimacy in this job at all and I can say
[55:45.880 --> 55:51.200]  with confidence that I can speak on behalf of the majority of the British people in saying
[55:51.200 --> 55:59.200]  we don't know you, we don't want you and the sooner you're put out to grasp the better.
[55:59.200 --> 56:09.360]  Well as you said Mr President you wouldn't like to be rude and I prefer to go ahead
[56:09.360 --> 56:10.920]  with the statement.
[56:10.920 --> 56:16.440]  That's Nigel Farage joining us with an exclusive European Union Member of Parliament from
[56:16.440 --> 56:23.240]  England coming up in the next segment, he's in Europe right now, UK's European Member
[56:23.240 --> 56:29.360]  of Parliament Nigel Farage faces reprimand after calling Herman von Rumpi wet rag that
[56:29.360 --> 56:35.160]  is the London Telegraph, here's the London Guardian, Nigel Farage rampage of rudeness.
[56:35.160 --> 56:39.800]  Well we have all the internal documents, it's all over the news in Europe that the EU intends
[56:39.800 --> 56:43.680]  to bankrupt the nations and bring them fully under its control.
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.760]  Herman von Rumpi is unelected, oh don't be rude to this scumbag, don't call out this
[56:48.760 --> 56:54.080]  filth that calls for global government and global taxes through the carbon tax, the tip
[56:54.080 --> 57:00.720]  of the green world government pyramid that they talk about in this United Nations document
[57:00.720 --> 57:08.160]  just out today, prisonplanet.com, a $45 trillion wealth transfer from what's left of Europe
[57:08.160 --> 57:16.640]  in the United States middle class to Herman von Rumpi and the bankers that control him.
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.680]  Give me a document cam shot, we're live at prisonplanet.tv, here is the UN document I
[57:20.680 --> 57:24.800]  was covering, we'll talk about this with Nigel Farage and a lot more, then when he leaves
[57:24.800 --> 57:30.240]  us in about 35 minutes into the next hour, I will go through this document in detail
[57:30.240 --> 57:31.240]  today.
[57:31.240 --> 57:35.480]  Then Bob Chapman's joining us, then we got Jong Young of Cryptoam that got shut down
[57:35.480 --> 57:41.120]  without a court order, without anything, via Microsoft when he published their secret
[57:41.120 --> 57:46.480]  document of how they're spying on everyone without warrants for the police.
[57:46.480 --> 57:52.400]  So that is coming up as well as the establishment is very frightened of people exposing them,
[57:52.400 --> 57:58.280]  their hubris is draining out of their pig-like bodies and they're now girding themselves
[57:58.280 --> 58:02.400]  for battle with the internet in free speech.
[58:02.400 --> 58:07.880]  So that is coming up, but the uproar was so huge they've now restored Cryptoam because
[58:07.880 --> 58:11.960]  of the black eye it was giving Microsoft, so that is coming up.
[58:11.960 --> 58:18.200]  But after this quick break, Nigel Farage, member of the European Union parliament who
[58:18.200 --> 58:24.600]  will stand up and speak to trash and scum like they deserve to be spoken to, will be
[58:24.600 --> 58:27.720]  joining us live, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:27.720 --> 58:35.800]  And then next Monday, the exclusive new album from Shooter Jennings and Stephen King against
[58:35.800 --> 58:37.000]  the New World Order.
[58:37.000 --> 58:42.000]  You will hear Stephen King, spoken word for the first time ever here on this show.
[58:42.000 --> 58:47.920]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[58:47.920 --> 58:53.360]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[58:53.360 --> 58:57.080]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[58:57.080 --> 59:00.240]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[59:00.240 --> 59:04.560]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[59:04.560 --> 59:05.560]  at home.
[59:05.560 --> 59:10.720]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[59:10.720 --> 59:11.720]  shots.
[59:11.720 --> 59:16.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[59:16.560 --> 59:22.040]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[59:22.040 --> 59:26.760]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[59:26.760 --> 59:31.040]  Jim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[59:31.040 --> 59:33.200]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[59:33.200 --> 59:38.600]  Today, it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[59:38.600 --> 59:40.440]  a fall of the Republic.
[59:40.440 --> 59:46.520]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[59:46.520 --> 59:54.760]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[59:54.760 --> 1:00:06.560]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:11.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:12.360]  You want answers?
[1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:14.560]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:14.560 --> 1:00:23.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:27.080]  He is a member of the European Union Parliament, hailing from England.
[1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:32.640]  He's back in England now and of course, he's the former United Kingdom Independence Party
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:33.640]  head.
[1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:38.400]  He's stepped down for that to run for another office and we are joined by him.
[1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:44.120]  He's all over the U.S., British and European news, scouring Herman von Rumpi, the guy that
[1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:49.400]  openly calls for world government, a $45 trillion to begin with, wealth transfer from
[1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:54.560]  Europe, England, the U.S. and Canada, Australia to the U.N., Gordon Brown last week called
[1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:58.800]  for a global government through a banking constitution where the banks take full control
[1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:02.160]  of the nations and the taxes are paid directly to them.
[1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:04.160]  He joins us for the next 30 minutes.
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:08.040]  Nigel Farage, rampage of rudeness as the Guardian headline.
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:14.280]  Nigel Farage faces reprimandant for calling Herman von Rumpi wet rag, London Telegraph.
[1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:18.720]  I would call him even more, a horrible sickening criminal parasite.
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:20.160]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:21.160]  Thank you very much.
[1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:26.440]  And yes, I think given that what people like van Rumpi are doing is robbing us of our democracy
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:30.720]  and robbing us of our ability to determine our own futures, I think I was quite moderate
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:31.720]  really.
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:32.720]  I think you were.
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:36.520]  I mean, this guy wants to take $45 trillion from us and give it to himself.
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:37.520]  He's unelected.
[1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:39.760]  The whole climate thing has been proven to be a fraud.
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:42.800]  I mean, he's heading up a criminal enterprise.
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:48.680]  It is extraordinary and of course, he's not been put there by any democratic means.
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:54.680]  He can't be removed by any democratic means, and he was talking openly on Rumpi this week
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:57.680]  in Brussels about the move towards world government.
[1:01:57.680 --> 1:01:58.680]  Nothing has been anymore.
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:00.680]  They're not even pretending anymore.
[1:02:00.680 --> 1:02:03.680]  This is what some of these people are pushing for.
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:04.680]  Yes.
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:08.200]  Paul Watson at Prison Planet two days ago with another article with multiple quotes
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:14.040]  of him saying global governance, global government, I mean, and it's undemocratic.
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:17.400]  The Financial Times of London admits it's undemocratic.
[1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:19.680]  London's already under it, even though you haven't voted to be part of it.
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:21.080]  I mean, when does this end?
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:25.400]  Well, you know, some things in life have to get worse before they can get better.
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:30.840]  I think the fact that they're being totally open now about their ambitions shows that
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:33.680]  they think it's in the bag, shows they think they've done the deal.
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:34.680]  They're the winners.
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:35.680]  It's all over.
[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:41.400]  And of course, when people get as arrogant as that, then you know the old saying that
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:46.880]  pride comes before a fool, it will come, but you know, it's difficult to see in the
[1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:49.760]  depths of a time like this exactly what the catalyst will be.
[1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:54.240]  But I just know from my travels, from talking to you guys across your side of the pond,
[1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:59.480]  and I just know there is a growing awareness, a growing feeling amongst tens of millions
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:00.480]  of people.
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:05.160]  They're beginning to wake up to what's being done to them, and it can't go on.
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:06.400]  Well said.
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:10.880]  Let's talk about the punishment you're going to undergo.
[1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:12.360]  What can they do to you?
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:19.480]  Well, yes, I have got to report to the headmaster's study at midday on Tuesday.
[1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:25.520]  It's also reminiscent of being sort of caught smoking at school, isn't it, who sends off
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:28.640]  to take your six of the best wax or whatever it may be.
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:34.080]  I'm going to his office at midday at his request, obviously.
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:40.080]  I think that over the last couple of days, this has escalated into a diplomatic crisis
[1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:45.480]  because the prime minister of Belgium, the non-country as I called it, the prime minister
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:52.160]  of Belgium is demanding an apology and demanding that this doesn't ever happen again.
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:54.880]  So I think they're going to ask me to apologize.
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:59.660]  They don't want you to continue to point out the obvious that especially Belgium and other
[1:03:59.660 --> 1:04:03.480]  nations are fully controlled now by the unelected EU.
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:08.200]  You have the unelected von Rumpi telling you an elected member of the parliament to shut
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:09.200]  up.
[1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:10.200]  Absolutely.
[1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:12.840]  I mean, that analysis is entirely right.
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:16.960]  I am guessing that I'll go and see them next week.
[1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:18.800]  I'll be told to apologize.
[1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:21.280]  I'm going to point blank reviews.
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:22.920]  I have nothing to apologize for.
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:26.560]  I mean, telling the truth should not be something for which I have to apologize or confess.
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:30.560]  I mean, crikey, we're back to the days of Stalin and the show trials, aren't we?
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:34.040]  And I'm guessing they're going to suspend me from the parliament or something like that.
[1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:35.040]  Well, let them do it.
[1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:36.040]  I don't care.
[1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:42.120]  That'll only draw more attention to this viperous, viperous little demonic creature.
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:46.760]  I mean, von Rumpi, just his whole demeanor, not just his actions is like a chari.
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:52.680]  I mean, they, they, they look like something out of Oliver Twist or something classic,
[1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:53.680]  classic villains.
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:54.680]  Stay there.
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:58.840]  Nigel Farage, a UK member of the European Union parliament will be right back in three
[1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:02.040]  short minutes.
[1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:07.320]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:10.040]  The main event is the, the wholesale destruction of the world.
[1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:15.040]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:19.880]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[1:06:00.440 --> 1:06:05.520]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:09.880]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:10.880]  do you want?
[1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:12.880]  My answer would be all I can get.
[1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:17.880]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:19.120]  How much do you want?
[1:06:19.120 --> 1:06:20.120]  When do you want it?
[1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:23.280]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:25.400]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:26.720]  Will there be any food?
[1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:28.200]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:32.320]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:33.480]  and be immunized?
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:37.280]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:40.880]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:42.120]  How much will you need?
[1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:43.120]  We don't know.
[1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:44.120]  How much do you want?
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:45.120]  All you can get.
[1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:46.120]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:49.320]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:08.480]  country?

[1:07:56.120 --> 1:08:01.080]  real estate needs you might have at HomeGain.com, your real estate connection.
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:07.320]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G-20 in the
[1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:10.160]  middle of the financial crisis.
[1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:16.080]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our
[1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:17.080]  planet.
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:23.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.480]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:31.560]  The Bilderberg Group documents from their founding meeting in 1954, covered by the BBC
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:35.560]  a few years ago, reported they wanted to set up the European Union.
[1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:40.000]  They said Hitler had failed to take over militarily, that the European Union would be established
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.200]  and then economically take over the planet.
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:47.800]  Now they admit the European Union unelected, the separate group of bureaucrats that control
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:53.640]  the nations are now telling the elected members like Nigel Farage from the UK, part of the
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:59.080]  European Union parliament, that he can't criticize Herman von Rumpi and he joins us
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:06.400]  now, he's being called in next Tuesday to be chastised, recap that Mr. Farage and you're
[1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:12.320]  saying you're not going to apologize to von Rumpi or to anyone else and you expect to
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:18.640]  be suspended and how does that work, how long will you be out of the parliament?
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:23.240]  Difficult to tell, the parliament hasn't really, the European parliament hasn't ever really
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:28.200]  had to deal with anyone like me, you've had the odd person that's made a protest because
[1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:32.840]  they wanted to get a particular story aired at a moment in time, but what they've never
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:38.160]  had in the European parliament, they've not had a leader of a group in the parliament who
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:45.440]  is utterly, implacably opposed in principle to robbing nation states of their democracy.
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:51.560]  So in the past, miscreants have been fined to a three days pay and the odd person has
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:56.920]  been suspended for two or three days, but they've never really had anybody who persistently
[1:09:56.920 --> 1:10:01.200]  has done this and as I say I was called in back in December and told that my behavior
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:08.360]  was unacceptable, I called Rumpi and the foreign minister, Baron Ash, I called them political
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:14.600]  pigmars, which I thought was again a very gentle description really, but I was told
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:18.440]  that, oh no, no, no, you know, you must never talk like that again, so I just don't know
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:22.880]  what they're going to do, but I would suspect that they'll suspend me for a week or something
[1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:26.640]  like that.
[1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:30.720]  Expanding on this, for those that don't know, listening in the US and around the world,
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:35.000]  when you talk about the bureaucrats being unelected, absorbing England, even though
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.480]  your nation's never been able to vote on this, Lord Monkton and many others yourself have
[1:10:39.480 --> 1:10:45.520]  talked about as much as 80% of your laws are not even British laws, they're just bureaucracy
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:46.520]  handed down.
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:51.960]  Obama's now saying he doesn't care if the US Senate won't ratify and won't go along
[1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:57.080]  with the failed treaty and won't pass this bill, he's just going to order the bureaucracy
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:10:58.080]  to do it.
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:02.480]  There's no rule by unelected bureaucracies, but break down the EU model for those that
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:03.480]  don't understand.
[1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:08.080]  Yeah, the way the EU works is there is a thing called the European Commission, and there
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:16.320]  are 27 people, each is appointed, not elected, but appointed by their own member state, and
[1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:22.280]  either in country, and each of them has a job title and a brief, say you have someone
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:27.560]  in charge of health and someone in charge of EU expansion, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:37.120]  They have beneath them 30,000 bureaucrats, and the European Commission has the sole right
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:44.960]  within the European Union to propose legislation, and the sole right to repeal a mend or change
[1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:45.960]  legislation.
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:50.440]  So what happens is the Commission comes up with a law, it gives it to the parliament,
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:54.560]  the parliament messes around with it, the parliament can delay it a little bit, and then in the
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:12:00.800]  end it gets rubber-stamped further down the line by more civil servants, so everything,
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:05.880]  the way in which our laws are actually drawn up in the European Commission, the whole process
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:09.040]  is done entirely in secret.
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:14.960]  The relationship, of course, because with those commissioners and big business is distinctly
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:21.840]  unhealthy, and it is a remarkable thing to think that it is the bureaucrats that make
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:27.960]  law and the parliamentarians that just fiddle around with the implication, and that in essence
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:29.640]  is a model of this system.
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:35.720]  We cannot vote for commissioners, we cannot remove commissioners, it is the absolute destruction
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:39.880]  of democracy and the victory of bureaucracy.
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:44.920]  So here's a cheap analogy, tell me if you agree, they're hanging England and the rest
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:55.240]  of the former sovereign nations at a Hangman's gallows, but you get to decide the color of
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:57.160]  the rope that is put around your neck.
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:03.920]  You get to decide what color a bullet is painted that's put in a handgun and fired into your
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:04.920]  head.
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:05.920]  Yeah, that's quite a cool point, buddy, really.
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:13.920]  But yeah, I mean, the nation states are disappearing, and of course, already it's not working.
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:17.680]  I mean, the last time I came on your show, I talked to you about Greece, if you remember,
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:21.720]  and how Greece was signed up to the single currency, and things weren't working.
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:26.560]  Well, now this week, we've had a general strike in Greece, we've had the police using tear
[1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:32.480]  gas, rubber bullets, all this kind of thing, and a war of words beginning to break out
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:37.840]  between Greek politicians and German politicians, so even as they've kind of put the finishing
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:43.640]  touches with this recent treaty they got through, as they've got their new president in Van
[1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:48.800]  Rompuy, as they've got their foreign minister in Ashton, even if, as it appears, that they've
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:54.440]  succeeded, actually the cracks and contradictions within the system are showing that actually
[1:13:54.440 --> 1:13:57.280]  this empire isn't going to last very long.
[1:13:57.280 --> 1:14:03.560]  The inherent tyranny is there for all to see, and I see polls in Europe, every time a country
[1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:07.520]  like France or others gets to vote on some new EU expansion, they don't normally let
[1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:11.480]  nations even have a vote like England and others, they vote to get out.
[1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:16.200]  They don't want it, and I've seen it in Reuters, I've seen reports out of Spain and Greece where
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:21.360]  government officials are saying big banks just like Iceland engineered this collapse,
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:27.080]  the EU has set it up so that Greece will fully become bankrupt and be completely absorbed
[1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:33.280]  into this system, and you alluded to that when you were chastising and calling Van Rompuy
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:37.480]  out on the carpet a few days ago, here is a quick clip of that.
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:43.480]  I said, though, that you're competent and capable and dangerous, and I have no doubt
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:49.480]  that it's your intention to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the European
[1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:50.880]  nation-states.
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:56.160]  You appear to have a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation-states,
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:02.160]  perhaps that's because you come from Belgium, which of course is pretty much a non-country.
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:08.720]  So in layman's words, you're not exaggerating, this is even in the newspapers all over Europe,
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:17.080]  the EU is this predatory bureaucracy globally setting up carbon taxes, 45 trillion.
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:21.560]  You even have fissures within the EU with some of the moral people.
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:27.400]  The 47-member health board with Wolfgang Wodard came on the show and said they found
[1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:34.680]  out that the EU and the UN were literally getting money from Big Pharma to all of their
[1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:37.640]  heads bribes to lie about the swine flu.
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:43.880]  So it's just all a giant global corporate system, corporations coming in, banks coming
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:49.280]  in, and using this government-holding company to literally engage in piracy.
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:54.280]  Yeah, it all fits together, doesn't it, and in gloves, you know, the big businesses,
[1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:59.720]  the bureaucrats will have a sole right to make laws, it all fits together, they're all
[1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:02.080]  very happy with the world they're creating.
[1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:10.680]  But the optimistic thing, the optimistic thing is whatever happens to Greece, at some
[1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:17.040]  point in time, there's going to be a revolution where the Greeks fight and insist to get back
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:20.000]  their own country and their ability to run it.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:26.040]  And stuff, tyranny, you know, it can be an awful thing, it can last for years, but in
[1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:32.000]  the end, all these things break up, and I just, I'm hopeful, I'm hopeful that people
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:38.720]  are waking up to this, and I just don't think that having a single currency for countries
[1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:43.680]  as different as Germany and Greece, it can't work, it just can't work.
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:48.720]  So I'm, you know, they appear to have all the cards at the moment, but we're winning
[1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:52.760]  the battle of public opinion, and that's just what we got today.
[1:16:52.760 --> 1:16:59.920]  Philosophers have said it many different ways, but to paraphrase it, adversity makes men,
[1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:07.100]  and you know, easy times makes, makes weak, weak passive people, and because our ancestors
[1:17:07.100 --> 1:17:13.280]  fought so hard in England, the birthplace of the Magna Carta in 1776 and 1789 here in
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:17.840]  the United States, which was the light of liberty for the world, the model against feudalism
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:23.360]  and all the forms of tyranny and slavery, people got fat and decadent, now the pendulum
[1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:28.760]  swung towards tyranny, and it's creating that awakening and that rediscovery of freedom,
[1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:34.540]  and you calling him out, not letting him be the quiet assassin, is devastating them, and
[1:17:34.540 --> 1:17:36.040]  they look very afraid of you.
[1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:41.840]  Yeah, they are, they're terrified, you know, they really are scared because they know that
[1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:46.840]  I'm articulating a view that is already held by tens of millions of people across the European
[1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:52.040]  countries, and their real fear, of course, is if we have a proper big debate about these
[1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:56.040]  issues, then the numbers who support me will double or treble from where they are now,
[1:17:56.040 --> 1:18:02.040]  so they are scared, very, very scared, and it's remarkable when you think about it that
[1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:07.760]  in that parliament this week, you know, there was the president, there were all the commissioners,
[1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:12.120]  the leaders of the European socialist groups and all the rest of it, and here's just little
[1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:16.240]  me, and yet they're absolutely scared with this.
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:21.320]  So I'm going to go on scaring them, even if I have to have a short holiday away from
[1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:25.880]  the parliament because they suspend me.
[1:18:25.880 --> 1:18:29.400]  Let's talk about his global government comments, because he's really out in the open, you said
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:32.840]  this week, and I saw it in the news, he's just spouting off about what they're going
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:37.600]  to do with our lives and how they rule us, specifically what was von Rumpy saying about
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:38.600]  the global government?
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:45.120]  Well, Rumpy spoke, and he firstly talked about the need, not just for a single currency
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:50.640]  in Europe, but for a full economic government of Europe, and that wasn't particularly surprising.
[1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:56.400]  He said similar things to that before, but what he said was that he was very encouraged
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:02.040]  by moves that he'd seen through the G20 and elsewhere, which presumably means the United
[1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:03.040]  Nations.
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:08.480]  He was very encouraged to say that we were now starting to deal with global problems on
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:14.680]  a global governmental basis, and by that of course he means climate change taxes, by that
[1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:23.600]  of course he means attitudes towards ultimately tax and spend, so I mean this guy, I've never
[1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:31.400]  heard anybody inside those EU institutions ever openly talk about world government, talk
[1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:32.880]  about global solutions to problems.
[1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:37.480]  It's one of those things that's been talked about in the corridors, it is now out in the
[1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:41.960]  open, and it just shows you how mad and dangerous these people are, doesn't it?
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:46.360]  They're making their move, Nigel Farage, a UK member of the European Union Parliament,
[1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:50.880]  will be with us on the other side, will give you his party's website, they control the
[1:19:50.880 --> 1:19:55.320]  right and the left in England, this is the only real party that has a chance, and his
[1:19:55.320 --> 1:20:02.880]  winning seats everywhere and really starting to scare the system will be right by.
[1:20:02.880 --> 1:20:06.480]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water

[1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:06.600]  On the average Americans work between 45-50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:08.880]  retire and live out their golden years.
[1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:14.040]  Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:17.040]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:21.360]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:25.280]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:29.040]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book The Creature
[1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:30.360]  from Jekyll Island.
[1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:34.440]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[1:22:34.440 --> 1:22:35.440]  power.
[1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:39.320]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.480]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:35.840]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, and investment advisors won't talk about
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:36.840]  gold IRAs?
[1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:41.240]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:42.920]  of gold for your retirement.
[1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:46.440]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:51.400]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:57.280]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:05.440]  Nigel Farage is our guest.
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:07.120]  We've got five more minutes left for him.
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:10.600]  He's got a book coming out in three weeks, he'll be back with us.
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:16.760]  Von Rumpi deserves to be pulled down, deserves to be insulted, to demystify this unelected
[1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:17.760]  scallywag.
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:23.040]  But, I mean, was it your tactic to add some insults so it made even more news, so people
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:27.520]  would actually look at the facts you laid out about him trying to assassinate sovereignty,
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:32.320]  A, B, the next time you get to addressing him, hopefully you would just bring up the
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:36.480]  heat, I mean, I know you have before that he's unelected, he wants global government,
[1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:38.560]  and that his whole carbon system is a fraud.
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:42.920]  But I know other members of your party in the parliament are also now exposing him.
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:47.840]  Yeah, I mean, Mike, to be honest with you, this was the first time he'd appeared before
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:53.760]  the European Parliament, and my plan going in was to basically say, who are you?
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:57.360]  No one's ever heard of you, you know, how can you have power?
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:02.480]  How can you have a salary that is bigger than the President of the United States of America?
[1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:05.280]  How can you have these 30 staff working for you?
[1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:10.280]  How can you have an incredible tax scheme where you only pay 17% income tax?
[1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:14.880]  How can you have a five million euro pool of money which you can dip into as and when
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:15.880]  you like?
[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:23.080]  So that was my plan, was to say that, but I listened to his speech, and it was so boring,
[1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:29.600]  it was so dull, it was limp, it was lifeless, it was just so ghastly, but that's where
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:34.280]  I suddenly thought, well, what I'm going to have to say is, sir, you have all the charisma
[1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:35.440]  of a damn rag.
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:41.400]  And let's be clear, many countries in Europe have over a 50% income tax, France even higher,
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:46.600]  but the EU made their own jurisdiction where their ministers and bureaucrats pay 17% are
[1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:48.520]  lower so they're exempt from taxes.
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:53.680]  I mean, this is classic textbook tyranny, Nigel Farage, plug the UK Independence Party
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:26:00.360]  website, your strategy across the world to get people to unseat these globalist controlled
[1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:01.360]  puppets.
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:08.280]  Yeah, I mean, listen, find out what we're doing, go to UKIP.org, UKIP.org, and you find
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:09.640]  what we're up to.
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:14.240]  We are a party that started with nothing, a few of us in a pub in London, and we've
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:19.720]  taken that on, and last year we came second across the entire UK in the direct elections
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:24.640]  to the European Parliament, and my message to everybody the world over is do not under
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:29.920]  any circumstances vote for people who will give away your liberties and rights, do not
[1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:34.800]  vote for people who are supporting the growth of global government, if it means going for
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:39.760]  new candidates, if it means going for new parties, do it, don't think it's hopeless
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:44.080]  it isn't, we're proving it can be done, and when you're doing it, remember that in the
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:48.120]  end, good will always triumph over tyranny.
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:52.800]  And you and many others are the model for others to believe they can have success.
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:57.840]  We've got almost 40 states, it's at 37, 38 now, moving to declare 10th and 9th amendment
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:03.280]  power over the federal government, itself seized by foreign banks and government institutions,
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:09.440]  and so there is a massive awakening worldwide, and all over the planet, the third world three
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:13.920]  months ago wouldn't sign on at Copenhagen, they know the scam, I mean we've really got
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:14.920]  the people.
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:19.920]  Yeah, the scales are falling, I mean they really are aren't they, people do not believe
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:24.920]  or trust their political classes, they're right not to trust them, and we're now seeing
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:30.560]  that moving into active real politics, and hey, to a large extent what I was able to
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:35.240]  do this week to the president of the European parliament is living proof that if something's
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:39.360]  wrong, you've got to get out there, hold your chin up and do things differently and fight
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:43.280]  hard, that's what we've done, we're making progress, I want others to do so right across
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:44.280]  the world.
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:50.120]  And you hadn't been politically active, you just saw this and stood up yourself just
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:54.640]  a few years ago, and look at all the success, you as the progenitor of this, have...
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:58.720]  I was in business, I don't come from one of these ruling class families or anything
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:04.000]  like that, I was just an ordinary bloke who just felt that something was horribly wrong,
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:09.120]  and I felt if there was nobody out there that was prepared to stand up and say the right
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:13.760]  things, I jolly well do it, and in doing so I've met some good people on the way, people
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:18.520]  like Lord Monkton, people like Godfrey Bloom, who you've had on your show, and you know
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:22.800]  there are others out there who felt like me, so it's been an extraordinary journey, but
[1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:26.880]  it's only what we're not finished yet, we're going to beat the seven foes.
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:29.640]  We are, if we have the will to stand up and fight, and you're a great example, in the
[1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:34.040]  last minute we've got left, an individual website, or how do we support you individual,
[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:37.840]  you have a lot of listeners in England, and give out the UK Independence Party website
[1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:38.840]  one more time.
[1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:45.440]  Yeah, just simply go to UKIP.org, and you'll see me, you'll see Lord Monkton, if you dig
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:50.400]  deeper, you'll see our thoughts on our failing education system in Britain, you'll see our
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:55.040]  thoughts on our failing public health care system, you know, we're a party that believes
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:59.360]  in less government, that believes in small government, that believes in liberty, freedom
[1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:01.680]  of the individual, and they're the things we fight for.
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:05.600]  If you look at UKIP.org, you'll see links to all sorts of other things, you'll see links
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:08.880]  to our own websites, but that's the first place to look.
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:14.440]  And in closing, I saw another BBC article yesterday about the government secretly bringing
[1:29:14.440 --> 1:29:20.000]  in foreigners, and I saw that six, seven years ago with Tony Blair, I mean this is a lawless
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  government.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:28.560]  Yeah, I'm afraid, you know, we are a relatively small country geographically, and our population
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:35.880]  is going up at such a rapid rate, we're projected to go up to 70 million by 2020, where we were
[1:29:35.880 --> 1:29:41.480]  quite happily settled at 58 million when Mr. Blair came to power in 1997.
[1:29:41.480 --> 1:29:46.120]  We haven't got the roads, we haven't got the schools, we haven't got the hospitals.
[1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:49.440]  Nigel Farage, we're out of time.
[1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:52.720]  Thank you so much, Godspeed, for supporting him.
[1:29:52.720 --> 1:30:01.840]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.840 --> 1:30:05.800]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Cola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:08.720]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:10.760]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:14.960]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:18.480]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with the Cola Blue, you'll know what's
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:19.480]  in your cup.
[1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:21.560]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:42.160]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including
[1:30:42.160 --> 1:30:45.760]  reverse osmosis, carbon filters and ultraviolet lights.

[1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:06.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:10.680]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:31:10.680 --> 1:31:15.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:16.320]  allows you to have.
[1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:17.320]  It's true.
[1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:22.020]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:31:22.020 --> 1:31:26.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:30.360]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:33.840]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:37.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:42.320]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:31:42.320 --> 1:31:46.080]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:47.440]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:51.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:31:51.680 --> 1:31:53.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.720]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:32:04.720 --> 1:32:09.480]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:10.480]  do you want?
[1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:12.480]  My answer would be all I can get.
[1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:17.520]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:32:17.520 --> 1:32:18.520]  How much do you want?
[1:32:18.520 --> 1:32:19.840]  When do you want it?
[1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:21.800]  Now or after the battle starts?
[1:32:21.800 --> 1:32:22.920]  When will you need it?
[1:32:22.920 --> 1:32:25.040]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:26.400]  Will there be any food?
[1:32:26.400 --> 1:32:27.840]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:31.960]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:32:31.960 --> 1:32:33.120]  and be immunized?
[1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:36.920]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:32:36.920 --> 1:32:40.480]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:41.720]  How much will you need?
[1:32:41.720 --> 1:32:42.720]  We don't know.
[1:32:42.720 --> 1:32:43.720]  How much do you want?
[1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:44.720]  All you can get.
[1:32:44.720 --> 1:32:45.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:48.920]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:32:48.920 --> 1:32:56.280]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:32:56.280 --> 1:33:08.320]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:12.800]  Next hour, we've got Bob Chapman for your phone calls on the economy and a lot of other
[1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:13.800]  issues.
[1:33:13.800 --> 1:33:15.720]  Any topic you want to bring up, you can comment on it.
[1:33:15.720 --> 1:33:18.360]  He's a well-rounded, very informed fellow, as you know.
[1:33:18.360 --> 1:33:24.440]  Then we have the creator of CryptoM.org, really the forerunner of sites like WikiLeaks who
[1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:32.120]  got shut down outside of government by Microsoft for putting up documents, which they admitted
[1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:36.960]  they're internal documents, how they spy on everybody with no warrants for law enforcement
[1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:40.960]  and let law enforcement into your computer anytime they want with no warrants.
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:43.440]  That is coming up in the last hour today.
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:49.520]  Now, I want to open the phones up now specifically on the fact that they want to try to pass in
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:54.400]  the Senate in the next few weeks, the greenhouse gas tax takeover of all levels of society.
[1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:57.920]  The same thing is happening in Europe, outside of the governments.
[1:33:57.920 --> 1:33:59.720]  They're just doing it.
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:04.520]  We also need to get into Shell, has global government vice president to push climate
[1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:06.720]  change propaganda.
[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:13.560]  Their climate change officer, their vice president is called a global government, not even governance,
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:16.760]  global government vice chairman, a vice president.
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:20.880]  I mean, this is the magnitude of what we're facing here.
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:22.800]  Do you realize the level?
[1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:27.680]  I want to get your take on it, how we can stop this, states are filing suit, companies
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:30.520]  are filing suit, attorney generals are filing suit.
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:38.120]  There's a Roxanne Decakick, I think you pronounce it, EVP, global government relations, Shell
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:39.120]  International.
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:42.400]  I mean, it's the corporations that set up the global government.
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:43.400]  It's an empire.
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:46.960]  They just build a global government, pay off your politicians to sign over your rights.
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:51.000]  If they can't get the Congress or the parliament to do it, they just come into the bureaucracy.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:53.720]  It's total lawless corporate takeover.
[1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:57.320]  That's what the new order is, is a global corporate takeover.
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:02.760]  They want socialism to take your wealth and give it to themselves and make you dependent.
[1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:08.560]  Let's play 30 second clip from a Dutch Royal Shell video press release.
[1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:10.560]  Here it is.
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:14.800]  Shell, working for a new energy future.
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:20.240]  Climate change, energy and economic recovery are a hugely complex issue and it will take
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:23.760]  more than governments alone to solve the problem.
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:30.000]  Industry needs to provide expertise and government needs to step up with solid regulatory frameworks
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.800]  that signal where we need to invest to provide good solutions.
[1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:39.160]  Shell, encouraging dialogue on the energy challenge.
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:42.000]  All the major oil companies have run TV ads.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.160]  I saw that months ago on CNN.
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:46.400]  I saw that.
[1:35:46.400 --> 1:35:50.320]  They just put global government under her like it's no big deal.
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:55.440]  They're just introducing it to you and then they have Time Magazine, Newsweek, The New
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:36:01.280]  York Times and scores of other publications in the last month attacking Alex Jones.
[1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:09.040]  This talk show host by name saying, I am insane, Psychology Today had a cover story.
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:10.040]  Featured story.
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:11.040]  I am insane.
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:12.520]  None of this exists.
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:16.080]  The New York Times a few months ago had an article about that film New World Order saying
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:23.440]  I was having basically a full schizophrenic event at a hotel believing there were men
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:25.880]  with black sunglasses and elites meeting.
[1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:32.040]  It was on record they were meeting there, but they think their readers are so stupid.
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:36.640]  They have such disdain for you that they sit there and openly announce world government
[1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:37.640]  everywhere.
[1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:42.480]  New York Times had an article written by Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the UN calling
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:47.560]  for global government, global taxes on everything, and then separately the New York Times writes
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:48.880]  it doesn't exist.
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:55.080]  I am a raving maniac lunatic.
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:36:56.680]  That's what they think of you.
[1:36:56.680 --> 1:36:58.880]  That's who they think you are.
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:03.160]  Well, here is the latest internal UN document.
[1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:09.440]  It's in the AP Fox News is covering it as well.
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:16.880]  Fox News a little bit schizophrenic and I guess he thinks it's a different audience.
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:22.480]  Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program talks about $45 trillion wealth transfer
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:27.000]  to the private banks for global government, global governance.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:30.680]  I read part of this article by Paul Watson detailing this earlier.
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:34.560]  I'm going to read more of it coming up, but first I want to go to your phone calls.
[1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:37.000]  Now listen, this isn't a game.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  This isn't a drill.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  This isn't a joke.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:44.880]  We don't have time to suck our thumbs or play tiddlywinks or play games here.
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:51.320]  Now is the time for the people of the world to be warned about what's happening.
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:54.000]  The people are ready to hear the truth now.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.400]  They're hearing global government being announced everywhere.
[1:37:56.400 --> 1:37:59.920]  People need to know, though, who runs the global government because as the back of this
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:07.480]  DVD says in game, blueprint for global enslavement for the new world order, a world government
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:10.560]  is just the beginning.
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:14.720]  Find out where this road leads from their own documents, their own words.
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:21.920]  A bare minimum of an 80% world population reduction by 2024.
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:26.160]  They are not going to get that without mass extermination and they try to implement their
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:27.160]  goals.
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:29.440]  They've gotten about 85% of what they want through.
[1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:34.320]  There are a few years behind.
[1:38:34.320 --> 1:38:35.320]  It's just so incredible.
[1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:37.200]  They're poisoning our water supply.
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:41.240]  When kangaroos drink fluoridated water, the humans drink, they die.
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:44.160]  That's ABC News, Australia.
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:47.000]  When cows drink fluoridated water, they die.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  When horses do.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  I mean, this is a fact.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.680]  You can just go to YouTube and type in farm animals dying from fluoride water and it's
[1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:57.880]  farmers on the news going, yeah, the city brought in water, municipal water told us to
[1:38:57.880 --> 1:39:03.160]  use that and my cows are all dying and I took it to the vet and they said, fluoride.
[1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:06.880]  This kills animals.
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:08.220]  They're killing you.
[1:39:08.220 --> 1:39:11.360]  That's only one thing they're doing.
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:16.160]  It's a fact that pull up the kangaroos dying from fluoride article.
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:17.160]  ABC News.
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:18.160]  I'll put it on screen folks.
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:19.160]  Don't believe us.
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:24.480]  And then when we posted a link to that article on prisonplanet.com, scores of comments were
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:29.640]  linking to other news articles across Europe and the US where they'll have a drought in
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:34.480]  Colorado or California and two of the cases they linked to YouTube videos and six months
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:38.720]  into cows drinking fluoridated water because they, because the wells dry up and they pipe
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:40.560]  in municipal.
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:45.000]  Their hair falls out and they start dying.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.840]  Almost every woman I know above the age of 35 has their hair fallen out, has thyroid problems.
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:53.440]  I'll be sitting in restaurants hearing women going, yeah, the doctor says, even though
[1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:56.760]  I don't eat anything, I'm getting fat and my hair is falling out from something they
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:39:58.080]  don't know.
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:02.300]  Fluoride hits your thyroid, ladies, okay.
[1:40:02.300 --> 1:40:03.720]  You're being murdered.
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:05.640]  It reduces your fertility.
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:07.040]  It attacks all your organs.
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:10.120]  It precipitates in all the bones.
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:12.500]  End game, blueprint for global enslavement.

[1:40:55.880 --> 1:40:58.080]  I mean, I was going to sit down for two hours and watch something.
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:00.760]  I want the DVD and supporting made it, but I don't care.
[1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:04.840]  Let's send everybody to know the links, warn them they're ready to hear the truth.
[1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:06.560]  This is so diabolical.
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:07.560]  This is so evil.
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:08.720]  What's happening?
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:11.240]  We need to warn people.
[1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:13.680]  We don't have any future if we don't stop this.
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:19.000]  Did you find the kangaroo article, kangaroos dying, fluoride in Australia, kangaroos poisoned
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  by fluoride.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:26.760]  ABC News, Australia, just randomly for people go to YouTube and type in farm animals getting
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:30.080]  sick from fluoride and you'll see local newscast.
[1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:36.640]  You will see I had 25 horses and 19 are dead now and took them to the vet and he said the
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:39.880]  fluoride was killing them.
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:43.680]  But see, it's like all these thousands of kids got sick, hundreds died in China from
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:44.680]  melamine.
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:46.880]  It turns out our kids are drinking melamine over 90%.
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:49.720]  That's associated press of the formula has melamine in it.
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:55.240]  And so the FDA food and recommendations said, you know what, melamine is no longer bad
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:56.240]  for you.
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:04.200]  They wave a magic wand, abracadabra, hotuka nanzuka, bababa gagaga, tatupa mamupa.
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:11.840]  And they wave the thing, the magic wand and now melamine is good.
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:16.400]  It doesn't matter if it attacks your liver, your kidneys, every other organ.
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:17.640]  Doesn't matter.
[1:42:17.640 --> 1:42:18.720]  It's good.
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:19.720]  It's wonderful.
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:20.720]  It's fabulous.
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:21.720]  Whoa.
[1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:23.400]  And it comes out, mercury isn't the vaccine.
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:27.400]  So they just put newscast on saying mercury is now good for your children's brains.
[1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:28.400]  I've played that over a hundred times.
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:30.080]  I'm not going to play it again.
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:34.720]  Just search engine the term news says mercury now good for children.
[1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:39.440]  You'll get newscast all over the country telling you, look, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:41.440]  Mercury's not good for you.
[1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:45.640]  Sodium fluoride and the other derivatives that are in it aren't good for you.
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:48.320]  Look, I know that may sound radical to some of you.
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:52.040]  Some of you heard the news say mercury's good and you may think it's a conspiracy theory
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:53.040]  that it's bad.
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:54.040]  Okay.
[1:42:54.040 --> 1:42:57.000]  Thousands of studies on mercury.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:59.960]  That's how brainwashed some of you are that you believe mercury is good for you because
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:02.480]  the news wouldn't lie to you.
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:04.520]  It's like we are living in Alice in Wonderland.
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:06.960]  We are living in a matrix of fruit cakes.
[1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:08.920]  Folks, I am sane.
[1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:10.040]  I read the documents.
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:11.040]  I do the research.
[1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:12.040]  It's all I do.
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:13.040]  It's real.
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:16.760]  And some lizards are like, no, Alex, we know mercury and fluoride are bad.
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:18.240]  Well, your neighbors sure don't folks.
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:21.040]  They think it's good.
[1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:24.640]  I went to the health food store and suddenly a bunch of the products said mercury on it
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:27.440]  because they said, well, the news, you know, the government announces mercury's good.
[1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:32.600]  It's now a vitamin.
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:33.600]  Andrew in Missouri.
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:34.600]  You're on the air.
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:35.600]  Go ahead.
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:36.600]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:37.600]  How you doing?
[1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:38.600]  Good.
[1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:39.600]  Glad to finally talk to you here.
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:43.320]  I just wanted to start off by saying that the New World Order is real and it's about
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:49.520]  time the American people start standing up, opening their eyes and realizing the hypocrisy
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:50.520]  and what's going on out there.
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:54.240]  But then they'd have to believe crazy stuff like melamine isn't good for their children.
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:43:55.920]  Yeah, it's a little ridiculous.
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:43:57.720]  The lines they're feeding us these days.
[1:43:57.720 --> 1:44:02.200]  Basically, I just wanted to touch on, I had a couple of questions for you.
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:09.200]  Start off, what is the best way for someone like myself, 22 years old, to get involved
[1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:12.400]  with spreading the word?
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:16.400]  The best thing to do is put up 50 flyers around your town and say, I'm meeting this
[1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:23.520]  Sunday or whatever day you pick at the local library for concerned citizens and the name
[1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:24.720]  of your town.
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:29.520]  And just say, I wanted to get people who are concerned about anything here together to
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:33.240]  talk about what's happening, make a copy of in-game, give it to each of the 20 people
[1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:39.120]  or whatever show up and say, we need to pick an issue, okay?
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:40.840]  Our town is a sanctuary city.
[1:44:40.840 --> 1:44:44.520]  We get arrested if we have one beer and drive, illegals can drunk drive, don't have to have
[1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:46.280]  insurance or a driver's license.
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:49.800]  We need to go to our city council and stop being a sanctuary city.
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:44:56.280]  Or we need to go as a group and educate our sheriff or our police chief about the new
[1:44:56.280 --> 1:44:57.600]  world order.
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:03.200]  Or we need to expose this phony environmental group that wants to stop a cold powered plant
[1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:07.320]  from going in our town that'll give us jobs, but then China's getting all the new plants.
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:11.920]  Or I mean, just you guys decide and a list of one to 10, what the most important issues
[1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:17.520]  are, pick a name for your group that sounds mainstream but patriotic and have your own
[1:45:17.520 --> 1:45:23.040]  grassroots organization and more and more people will get involved and then pull your
[1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:30.040]  resources, vote six months in when you've got 400 members or whatever, vote for who
[1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:36.880]  you want to make talk show host and everybody will give the 400 people $10 a month and that
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:40.720]  will pay for you to say have a two, three hour radio show on the local talk station.
[1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:44.880]  You go on the show and you talk about issues, you say come join our group, maybe even to
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:45.880]  fund the group.
[1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:48.280]  You start selling particular books and videos.
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:51.800]  You got to fund your operation that usually revolutionaries rob banks.
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:52.800]  We don't do that.
[1:45:52.800 --> 1:45:56.120]  We're counter revolutionaries against the globalist revolution.
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:45:59.800]  You pick some books and videos you want to sell.
[1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:06.360]  You start a bookstore to fund your operation and then a year into it or even less, you
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:14.080]  guys decide who wants to run for office, for mayor or city council or school board or water
[1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:19.680]  district or county commissioners and you simply take over the system.
[1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:24.280]  Second question I just wanted to touch on here briefly.
[1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:29.520]  It's well documented that governments use fear as a weapon against people.
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:34.040]  Lately I've just been discovering all pretty new to the whole thing that's going on.
[1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:38.480]  I've been listening to a lot of the stuff that you've done, doing a lot of my own research.
[1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:45.880]  I'm just concerned that some of the things that we're being told is part of that fear.
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:48.160]  Do you understand where I'm coming from?
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:53.440]  Yes, I understand, Andrew, and I appreciate your call, but I mean we can overanalyze things
[1:46:53.440 --> 1:46:57.200]  all day and just, I don't know if I want to get involved and there's trolls on the internet
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:02.160]  and people fighting and the government's putting out fear.
[1:47:02.160 --> 1:47:06.480]  I mean, yeah, the government admits they're spying on you without warrants now, so you'll
[1:47:06.480 --> 1:47:10.120]  get scared and shut up and hide in your house and just watch television.
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:14.120]  You've got to throw caution to the wind because there's a greater danger in letting this tyranny
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:16.840]  come to fruition.
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:24.560]  The danger is in not taking action or wanting a silver bullet to fix things.
[1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:28.560]  Resistance and action and right purpose is unstoppable.
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:33.680]  Look, I never intended to have a big syndicated radio show, have the most viral films on the
[1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:38.000]  internet, have the one and two, the top two biggest alternative news sites.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.280]  I never intended that.
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:46.960]  I was angry about gun grabbing and land grabbing in Austin, Texas and big government and so
[1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:54.120]  I went and got an access TV show and here we are 14 plus years later.
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:58.720]  Look what I've been able to do, I mean, you just have to journey a thousand miles starts
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:47:59.720]  with a single step.
[1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:00.720]  Let's go to another caller.
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:01.720]  Let's talk to Matt in Illinois.
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:02.720]  Matt, you're on the air.
[1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:09.760]  Yeah, Alex, I trade index futures, I trade the euro, I trade a lot of things that we've
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:12.800]  talked about with what the new world order are going to do, like what Lindsey Williams
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:15.040]  talked about the other day.
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:22.320]  And if the elite really dropped the dollar 30% from here, they can't help but bump the
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:26.840]  euro, the euro up like 50% or 30% because of the way the euro and the dollar.
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:27.840]  Wait a minute.
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:29.960]  We saw the euro go down two weeks ago and then the dollar went down.
[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:30.960]  Right.
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:36.080]  But if you look at what the G20's meeting for is coordinated, but yeah, no, their currency
[1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:38.760]  traders themselves and they know what's going to happen beforehand.
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:41.720]  So they like to manipulate things up and down to make profit.
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:43.280]  I don't know if Williams is right.
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:47.000]  I believe that he talked to this guy and this elitist believes this and most of what the
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:48.680]  guy said has come true.
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:54.520]  Some pretty stunning predictions that did come true, fuels at 50 bucks a barrel and
[1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:56.080]  then it goes up to 150.
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:48:57.840]  So we've got to pay some attention to it.
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:03.160]  Well, the thing is, whenever one currency plunges, the yen, the New Zealand dollar,
[1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:08.800]  the Australian dollar, it automatically creates this effect where money starts automatically
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:10.120]  fleeing to other currencies.
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:15.200]  So it's very hard to destroy one currency without the other eight major currencies.
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:20.000]  Because the stronger currencies can buy whatever is weaker at the time and then make profits
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  with it.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  I understand.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:25.380]  The problem with the euro right here is the euro right now, it's still, the euro is actually
[1:49:25.380 --> 1:49:31.000]  falling a lot, but it's still so overvalued in terms of the European economy has a major
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:32.320]  export problem.
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:38.160]  They don't export Portugal, Greece, Spain, they're falling, they do export taxes and
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:39.160]  tyranny.
[1:49:39.160 --> 1:49:44.360]  Yeah, but their products, they've been killed, the New World Order has pumped up their currency
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:45.760]  for 10 years in Europe.
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:50.960]  A lot of it, I think for racial reasons, just because frankly, money's been flowing, there's
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:54.560]  a lot of investors, even in America, who buy euros all day.
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:58.400]  I know a lot of wealthy people, 401Ks, who just sit there and just buy European stocks
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:03.160]  and European, for no reason other than it's Europe and they like buying European things.
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:06.360]  But the problem is, that's why they can't export anything.
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:11.240]  If the euro just rises 5, 10% from here, Portugal, Greece, Ireland.
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:12.760]  We've got 50 seconds left.
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:14.840]  What are you saying is going to happen?
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:18.480]  I'm saying they're in their zeal to kill the dollar.
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:23.240]  They're going to end up hurting exports more out of Europe because the euro will just naturally
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:24.840]  rise a bit.
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:30.280]  And then Portugal, Ireland, these other countries are going to blow up just like Greece right
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:31.840]  in their face is what I'm saying.
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:37.240]  Yeah, because if their currency rises, then people aren't going to be able to buy their
[1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:40.200]  goods and so that'll hurt their exports, they don't care.
[1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:43.840]  They're going into the end game where they want to wreck society.
[1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:45.600]  They want to bankrupt people.
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:48.520]  They want to destroy industrial society.
[1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.760]  That's the wild card in all of this.
[1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:52.280]  But hey, we're all going to see.
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:53.800]  We're going to see if Williams is right.
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:56.440]  You know, I'm not saying he's necessarily 100% right.
[1:50:56.440 --> 1:50:57.440]  We're going to find out together.
[1:50:57.440 --> 1:51:00.760]  We'll be right back with more of your calls, more news straight ahead.

[1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:17.120]  almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?

[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:03.840]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:07.800]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[1:53:07.800 --> 1:53:09.400]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:13.480]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:14.480]  or gold?
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:17.840]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[1:53:17.840 --> 1:53:20.000]  possible that could even happen again.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:24.520]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:25.520]  seeds.

[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:20.960]  Tons of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:23.640]  We're having vagaries against the globalists, but we have to keep fighting.
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:24.640]  They never give up.
[1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:25.800]  We can never give up.
[1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:28.600]  The price is too high.
[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:30.100]  What we will pay is too dear.
[1:54:30.100 --> 1:54:31.720]  Look what we've already gone through.
[1:54:31.720 --> 1:54:34.280]  America sees turning to an engine of evil.
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:36.160]  It's only going to get worse.
[1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:38.120]  Let's talk to Brian in Ohio.
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:40.120]  Brian, you're on the year worldwide.
[1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:41.120]  Hey, Alex.
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:42.120]  Can you hear me?
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:43.120]  Yes, sir.
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:44.120]  Okay.
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:50.480]  I was just wondering, after listening to your break down of the Joseph Stack situation,
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:54.400]  I do believe that they want to push us into a revolution, but why do they want to do that
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:54:58.440]  since we obviously outnumber them like we do?
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:02.360]  You know, the Joseph Stack situation, the evidence really points towards false flagging
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:03.360]  before the show ends today.
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:05.120]  I want to get back into that in the last 20 minutes.
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:10.400]  All the new developments on that front, because they can look that peacefully we're beating
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:18.160]  them on every front, the flu, the healthcare, the carbon taxes, and as long as it's peaceful,
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:22.440]  they're going to end up losing because they're so unelected, so criminal, so ridiculously
[1:55:22.440 --> 1:55:23.440]  corrupt.
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:26.320]  And so how do you blow up an oil well fire?
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:27.320]  You can't put out.
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:28.960]  You use explosives to knock it out.
[1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:31.720]  They want to get an explosive revolution going.
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:35.320]  They've got operatives everywhere pushing for it, saying, why isn't Alex Jones calling
[1:55:35.320 --> 1:55:36.320]  for armed rebellion?
[1:55:36.320 --> 1:55:37.760]  He's a wimp.
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:41.280]  And you know, all these FBI guys, it comes out who are calling for violence.
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:46.880]  It turns out our FBI, like Hal Turner and others, I mean, so many cases in Europe and
[1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:52.480]  Australia and England and the U.S. and Canada, it always comes out decades later that these
[1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:53.480]  are operatives.
[1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:55.920]  I mean, that's in some of my first films, we expose that.
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:00.800]  And so they want violence so they can pain us as the bad guys and the whole stick thing.
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:07.160]  Again, we're a week into this now, we can several days, what happened eight days ago
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:10.200]  and it is leaning heavily towards stage now.
[1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:12.840]  We've gone over all that evidence previously again, I'll cover it at the end of the show
[1:56:12.840 --> 1:56:13.840]  today.
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:14.840]  What do you say?
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:19.680]  I don't know, that's just I wanted your opinion on it because it seems like just heard you
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:26.040]  break the numbers down before what 250 million or 260 million gun owners, at least 150 million
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:27.840]  gun owners, 400 million guns.
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:28.840]  Okay.
[1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:33.040]  Well, I mean, even at 1% that's still a guerrilla war that they can't even think to win.
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:37.400]  And that's why they're putting surveillance and tracking and control in.
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:43.840]  And that's why they want to have it early before everybody wakes up because they intend
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:49.600]  to try to look, look, our criminal government has financed hundreds of overthrows worldwide.
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:54.040]  When they have their druthers, they put dictators in over Latin American, Middle East, Central
[1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:58.360]  Asian, Southeast Asian, European, Eastern European countries.
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:56:59.920]  They like dictatorship.
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:04.600]  They want dictatorship of this global corporate structure worldwide.
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:06.720]  They are going to use violence.
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:10.080]  And so they want to have it now rather than later.
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:17.840]  All right, I see, well, I don't mind to keep it as a, a soft counter-revolution like we're
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:22.280]  doing now because just with the amount of people I've woken up in Ohio, it's amazing.
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:23.280]  Exactly.
[1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:25.400]  Counter-revolution of info.
[1:57:25.400 --> 1:57:26.400]  We're out in the open.
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:27.500]  We're honorable.
[1:57:27.500 --> 1:57:28.500]  We're good.
[1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:31.600]  Anybody meets you at a gun show and says, let's go build pot bombs.
[1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:35.800]  That guy's a copper and informant and they'll talk to a thousand people before they find
[1:57:35.800 --> 1:57:37.040]  one mentally ill person.
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:38.040]  Yeah, let's do it.
[1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:42.200]  I mean, most of these busts I see is they'll go to bars and they have their operatives
[1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:45.880]  as bartenders and people going, yeah, we ought to do something to the government.
[1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:47.560]  We ought to shoot some people or something.
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:51.520]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me and I get in their face,
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:54.760]  follow them out to the parking lot and it's an unmarked police car.
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:58:00.480]  I mean, it's just, there's no end to the scum and the criminals and the trash that these
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:02.280]  people have hired.
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:05.880]  And so they're always wanting to have busts of people that were planning violence to create
[1:58:05.880 --> 1:58:08.480]  that illusion and most of the cops aren't corrupt.
[1:58:08.480 --> 1:58:11.440]  So the low level cops here, my gosh, they just stopped a guy that wanted to bomb the
[1:58:11.440 --> 1:58:12.600]  police station.
[1:58:12.600 --> 1:58:15.200]  My goodness gracious, there are terrorists everywhere.
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:19.040]  I guess we do need to train to take on the American people.
[1:58:19.040 --> 1:58:23.600]  I guess these in the fetters are bad.
[1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:27.240]  You know, and we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:32.040]  break, we'll take a few more calls and then Bob Chapman, the international forecaster will

[1:59:55.160 --> 2:00:06.880]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:11.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:11.680 --> 2:00:12.680]  You want answers?
[2:00:12.680 --> 2:00:14.880]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:14.880 --> 2:00:19.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:23.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:26.720]  We are into hour number three.
[2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:29.560]  I am feeling good right now, I gotta tell you.
[2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:35.400]  All these reports of people waking up all over the world, folks calling out Herman von
[2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:43.200]  Rumpi in the EU, parliament is an unelected pig that he is, a tyrant.
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:49.800]  Finding out that Stephen King is a listener and a fan.
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:54.520]  And we're gonna have exclusive spoken word first time you'll ever hear it in the world
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:59.960]  with Shooter Jennings' new album on Monday with Stephen King.
[2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:01.560]  You're gonna hear that on this show.
[2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:04.200]  We might even get Stephen King.
[2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:07.080]  Shooter sent me the new thing two weeks ago, I wanted to premiere it here.
[2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:08.080]  He's a big musician.
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:14.400]  He plays the crowd's like 20,000, and we're wailing Jennings' son, Shooter Jennings.
[2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:17.960]  And he said, he was calling Rob, he says, Alex heard it, and I was like, oh, I forgot,
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:22.920]  I want to, it was his great album, sounds like a, it's, it's amazing.
[2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:27.360]  And I'm like, dude, you didn't tell me that Stephen King does spoken word for this whole
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:28.360]  thing.
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:32.000]  It's 14 tracks with like two minute clips of Stephen King talking about the new world
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  order.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:36.760]  And I called Jennings up and he goes, yeah, that's why I wanted you to hear it.
[2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:38.240]  King's a fan of mine.
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:39.800]  And I said, is he, is he like me?
[2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:42.400]  He goes, yeah, no, yeah, he's totally, he's been into this forever.
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:45.360]  No, he listens to the show, blow me away.
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:53.200]  So he's King's very, very busy and very, very private, but get him on the show.
[2:01:53.200 --> 2:01:55.280]  But wait, this spoken word is him on the show.
[2:01:55.280 --> 2:01:59.520]  I mean, this is going to be premiered here next Monday.
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:05.120]  My problem is there's 14 clips and we've got the head guy from black genocide who exposes
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:09.480]  how there's more black people aborted every year in the U S and there are born.
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:13.920]  We've got him coming on, but he's on the hour before Shooter's on.
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:18.160]  We called the black genocide guy to, to get him to come on a 12, 13 set of, set of one.
[2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:20.240]  So I have an hour and a half with Shooter.
[2:02:20.240 --> 2:02:22.440]  So cause I'm in it cause it's like a 14 track things.
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:25.280]  I can play the whole thing.
[2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:31.840]  I mean, if I, if I want, and when I got that news, I'm like, my gosh, I mean, you're going
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:35.040]  to get to hear Stephen King go off on the new world order.
[2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:41.280]  I mean, this is just, I'm like a kid in a candy shop here.
[2:02:41.280 --> 2:02:42.280]  I mean, I mean, I really am.
[2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:47.400]  And then we got the email and we called and it's confirmed a big Hollywood star, total
[2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:50.960]  anti new world order wants to hook up with me.
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:55.480]  It's out by Southwest and we'll probably get him on the show.
[2:02:55.480 --> 2:02:59.320]  And I mean, we're just hitting on all cylinders folks.
[2:02:59.320 --> 2:03:04.120]  I mean, it's just, we're reaching so many people or having such a big effect and all
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:10.040]  the glory goes to Yahweh, all the glory goes to my Lord and savior, whatever name you call
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:14.920]  him, Jesus Christ, Yahweh, Jehovah, we know who we're talking about, the God of life,
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:20.960]  the God of wholesomeness, the God of honor and creation and beauty and innocence.
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:32.480]  And I am just so filled with God's spirit that it is, it's bizarre to still be fleshly
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:40.800]  and still have all this evil in me, but at my core is good.
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:48.640]  And I don't know how to describe it, the discernment and people think I'm articulate and charismatic.
[2:03:48.640 --> 2:03:55.160]  I can't even give you one 1000th of the understanding I have and what I see and just, I know we
[2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:56.720]  can defeat this new world order together.
[2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:59.880]  I know the new order will be built, it will come into fruition.
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:05.160]  And from the moment it is finally in complete control, it will start disintegrating and it
[2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:07.320]  is going to wreck the planet.
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:15.440]  It is going to be a hellish war, but it's a war of the mind and the soul and the heart.
[2:04:15.440 --> 2:04:20.640]  And I just realized whatever happens to me and my family, I was on the right side.
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:25.720]  That's why the enemy, mainstream media, alternative, all of it always tries to pull me down, always
[2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:29.840]  tries to lie, always tries to say, I'm not real because they don't want you to look into
[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:34.240]  the mirror of Alex Jones and see yourself and know that you're real and that you have
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:35.240]  power.
[2:04:35.240 --> 2:04:37.720]  They want to pull down that idea that there's anything good in the world.
[2:04:37.720 --> 2:04:38.720]  That's what Satan does.
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:42.120]  No, there is good in the world.
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:45.840]  And even those of you that are turned over to evil and weakness, you can pull away from
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:46.840]  it.
[2:04:46.840 --> 2:04:50.320]  If you can still even hear me, if you haven't hardened your heart, it's not too late to
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:55.320]  turn around like Saul of Tarsus, the coming Paul will be right back, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:04:55.320 --> 2:05:02.240]  on the other side of this quick break with Bob Chapman.
[2:05:02.240 --> 2:05:06.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:11.200]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:15.520]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:16.840]  allows you to have.
[2:05:16.840 --> 2:05:17.840]  It's true.
[2:05:17.840 --> 2:05:22.560]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:05:22.560 --> 2:05:26.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:05:26.880 --> 2:05:30.880]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:34.360]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:38.080]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:42.800]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:46.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:48.000]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:53.960]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.

[2:06:01.320 --> 2:06:07.840]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:06:07.840 --> 2:06:12.520]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:16.680]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[2:06:16.680 --> 2:06:21.320]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[2:06:21.320 --> 2:06:26.560]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:32.840]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:37.160]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:42.480]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:06:42.480 --> 2:06:47.720]  Be easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:54.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:07:03.440]  Lungs Generator, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:07.160]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:10.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:14.680]  These are finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:07:14.680 --> 2:07:15.680]  at home.
[2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:20.840]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[2:07:20.840 --> 2:07:21.840]  shots.
[2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:26.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:32.720]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:36.800]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:41.360]  Jim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[2:07:41.360 --> 2:07:43.320]  saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:07:43.320 --> 2:07:49.200]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:50.200]  of the Republic.
[2:07:50.200 --> 2:07:56.640]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[2:07:56.640 --> 2:08:03.640]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:08:03.640 --> 2:08:19.520]  We are now into hour number three, cryptome.org around for many, many years, I know more than
[2:08:19.520 --> 2:08:20.840]  a decade.
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:27.480]  The progenitor of sites like WikiLeaks that post secret government documents got an internal
[2:08:27.480 --> 2:08:32.880]  manual from Microsoft on how without warrants they just basically spy on everybody.
[2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:38.880]  It made international news three days ago when the site was taken down by network solutions
[2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:39.880]  and shut down.
[2:08:39.880 --> 2:08:42.440]  They wouldn't even allow them to transfer it.
[2:08:42.440 --> 2:08:44.120]  All hell broke loose.
[2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:46.640]  The internet community, the hacker community got really upset.
[2:08:46.640 --> 2:08:51.060]  Now they've got a message up there that it's been partially turned back on.
[2:08:51.060 --> 2:08:52.360]  That's coming up next hour.
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:59.240]  For the next 52 minutes or so, Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com joins us.
[2:08:59.240 --> 2:09:03.080]  He really doesn't need any introduction, one of the biggest private gold and silver brokers
[2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:08.480]  at a time, very successful stock trader, had one of the biggest newsletters ever until
[2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:09.480]  he retired.
[2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:12.480]  He came back at theinternationalforecaster.com.
[2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:17.880]  Of course, I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and I've got so much I want to talk about
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:23.440]  with Bob Chapman today on the economy where he sees the dollar going gold.
[2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:27.880]  He predicted six months ago that J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, tried to bring down
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:29.360]  Greece and Spain.
[2:09:29.360 --> 2:09:32.840]  It's now in the news that they're engineering this, even in Reuters.
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:36.000]  Herman von Rump is running around declaring world government.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:42.080]  Fox News and AP yesterday published a secret U.N. document calling for global governance,
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:45.960]  a $45 trillion wealth transfer to private banks.
[2:09:45.960 --> 2:09:51.200]  Gordon Brown publicly, as you know, last week, the head of England, unelected prime minister,
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:57.640]  said that world government is here, a new constitution of the G20 of private banks that
[2:09:57.640 --> 2:09:59.080]  you will pay your taxes to.
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:03.440]  Herman von Rump also said that in European Union parliament earlier this week, Nigel
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:08.120]  Farage, European Union parliament member from England, got in his face about it.
[2:10:08.120 --> 2:10:10.560]  He's now being censured.
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:13.360]  Nigel Farage rampage of rudeness.
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:14.360]  Yes.
[2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:19.320]  So we're going to talk about this with Bob Chapman and a lot more today.
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:21.000]  Bob, good to have you here with us.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:22.280]  Well, thank you.
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:24.320]  It's wonderful to be here again.
[2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:29.000]  And I caught the end of the last hour and it was eloquent and from the heart.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.360]  And I applaud you for it.
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:34.560]  You never know why you do what you do in life.
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:42.720]  And I can't help but think that there's designs for everybody, the place that they play in
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:45.360]  the time that they're here on earth.
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:53.280]  And I could never really understand myself why, as a newsletter writer, I was so successful.
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:56.480]  And all I can say is his hands on my shoulder.
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:00.960]  Otherwise, I just don't know how I could have done it.
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:04.360]  Well they say the universe bends towards justice.
[2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:06.960]  And it will just stand up against evil.
[2:11:06.960 --> 2:11:07.960]  God will do the rest.
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:10.280]  But it's the simple commitment.
[2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:15.080]  It's like a spiritual decision that you make and that everything else flows from that.
[2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:22.280]  Because if you make the right decision in your heart and soul, then you will be guided.
[2:11:22.280 --> 2:11:28.200]  Do you agree with that statement?
[2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:30.800]  That's the explanation.
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:32.800]  That's the reason.
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:35.680]  Bob, there's so much going on.
[2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:42.280]  Let's break down what the global bankers are doing right now, what is transpiring, where
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:43.280]  the economy is going.
[2:11:43.280 --> 2:11:48.320]  The most important info, all the economic numbers, as you know, pouring in that this
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:54.000]  depression is now deepening, as you said, two years ago it would do.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  It's incredible.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:03.040]  Well, I think some of the things you touched on in the introduction to the hour are very
[2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:05.160]  salient and important.
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:11.560]  I think what is going on is that, and I talked about this four or five months ago on the
[2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:21.920]  program, I think they are starting to begin the beginning of the phasing in of allowing
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:29.320]  deflation within the world economy, never mind the United States, to start getting stronger.
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:36.920]  They did that for the last nine months or so, reducing what used to be called M3 from
[2:12:36.920 --> 2:12:44.200]  a plus 17.4% down to three or four or five percent.
[2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:52.000]  That's very important because they're pulling the cookies out of the table and the kids
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:59.440]  can't have them anymore, and as they say in Wall Street, removing the punch bowl.
[2:12:59.440 --> 2:13:04.440]  In layman's terms, over $50 trillion globally that private central banks have stolen from
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:08.880]  their governments that have been given to them, and now they're just cutting the money
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:13.040]  off of the people and hoarding it all for themselves.
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:20.560]  I think that's a fair statement, and that's borne out by the drop in loans to small companies,
[2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:25.360]  medium-sized companies and individuals of about 20% to 7%.
[2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:33.480]  The money that they have on deposit with the Fed, the loans they get from the Fed are back
[2:13:33.480 --> 2:13:40.080]  at the Fed getting more money than what they paid for them, and so that's a taxpayer subsidy,
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:46.840]  and that money could get monetized during this process over the next couple of years.
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:51.680]  If you remember, I said, I thought perhaps by the end of the year or certainly by the
[2:13:51.680 --> 2:14:01.880]  end of next year that there could be a large meeting of countries like the Smithsonian meaning
[2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:09.000]  of the 70s and the Plaza Accord of 85 and the Louvre Accord of 87, and they would revalue
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:10.920]  and devalue currencies.
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:13.400]  They would have a debt settlement.
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:18.640]  They would try to form an international trading unit, and I will.
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:21.000]  You said all of that a year ago.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:24.520]  You said that months ago, and now three weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago, Australian
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:30.520]  headline, 24 top central bankers meet in secret, I guess to make the real decisions, and they'll
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:34.120]  have public rollouts later next month in Canada.
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:38.040]  I mean, are you saying it looks like they've now made their decision?
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:45.440]  Right, and I think the tip off was about nine months ago when maybe almost a year ago when
[2:14:45.440 --> 2:14:56.880]  we saw the European central bank in particular lead the way from a plus 11.3 M4, which is
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:05.080]  the same as M3, down from 12.8% to virtually zero, and in fact, it's below zero right
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:13.080]  now, a wee bit, and that was followed by the United States and Great Britain.
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:17.840]  What they're doing is they're removing a lot of capital from the system, and the only
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:19.840]  reason you would do that is twofold.
[2:15:19.840 --> 2:15:24.440]  Number one, if you thought there was going to be hyperinflation, you'd do that, or you
[2:15:24.440 --> 2:15:26.240]  want to bring the system down.
[2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:31.960]  I think they're in the process of taking the system down, and one of the things I've
[2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:40.280]  noticed here, and I'll get into how they are going to proceed, one of the things I noticed
[2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:47.880]  is the method that they've taken by taking out Greece as an example, anybody who has
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:54.080]  written about or is a politician in Europe or a businessman in Europe knows that Greece
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:15:59.640]  incidentally should have never been in the Eurozone.
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:06.000]  There was only 14 members, and then they expanded it to 16 out of the 27 nations within the
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:09.560]  European Union, so not everybody belongs to the Eurozone.
[2:16:09.560 --> 2:16:17.600]  A lot of people don't know that, and so I think they have now plucked Greece out as
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:24.600]  an example, because I mentioned in my last issue, which came out on Wednesday, there's
[2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:29.680]  16 countries that are bankrupt, and I think they're going to herd them all toward the
[2:16:29.680 --> 2:16:35.400]  edge, and then I think they're going to have this meeting I speak of, and I don't know
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:40.320]  exactly when it's going to be, but it could be anywhere between October and the end of
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:41.320]  next year.
[2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:48.400]  And the reason I say October is if they were smart, what they would do would be to have
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:56.360]  a financial crisis in October so that they could shut down markets at least temporarily,
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:17:02.360]  and not have an election in November in the United States, and the reason why is all the
[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:08.440]  people who are in the House and the Senate who have been paid off by these aluminists
[2:17:08.440 --> 2:17:13.280]  behind the throne, so to speak, they're all going to get kicked out of office, because
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:14.280]  you've seen the polls.
[2:17:14.280 --> 2:17:15.280]  I mean, they're dreadful.
[2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:22.200]  I mean, the people want everybody out practically, and so if they were smart, they wouldn't have
[2:17:22.200 --> 2:17:26.160]  an election that would be temporarily put off probably for two years.
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:29.400]  All right, I want you to keep walking through this, Bob, but let me throw some things in
[2:17:29.400 --> 2:17:34.600]  here that back up what you said seven, eight months ago, that embassies were getting rid
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:38.840]  of their dollar stocks and moving to other currencies and gold.
[2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:41.560]  We see that being set up.
[2:17:41.560 --> 2:17:46.760]  Citibank over the weekend, and it was confirmed on Monday, we went to Citibank's website.
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:53.440]  The feds told them to get ready to hold funds for seven days so they can then devalue and
[2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:56.320]  hold your money throughout that period.
[2:17:56.320 --> 2:18:01.080]  And now all the other big banks are announcing that the same thing is being prepared.
[2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:06.760]  And suddenly, Von Rupey Brown, and all these key globalists, and of all of them, the real
[2:18:06.760 --> 2:18:09.880]  leader of the New World Order right now is Gordon Brown, because England's the kingpinness
[2:18:09.880 --> 2:18:11.720]  for those that don't know.
[2:18:11.720 --> 2:18:16.320]  He said last Friday in a speech, the New World Order is here, global government is here.
[2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:19.280]  We're going to have a global constitution by the banks.
[2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:20.400]  We're taking over the planet.
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:22.760]  We played that on Monday.
[2:18:22.760 --> 2:18:28.200]  So they clearly, again, bring in the crises, offer the next big solution.
[2:18:28.200 --> 2:18:29.200]  And I agree with you.
[2:18:29.200 --> 2:18:30.920]  They're certainly looking at doing this.
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:36.000]  I want to walk through how you think they will do it, but first, is there any way to
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:37.240]  stop them?
[2:18:37.240 --> 2:18:46.200]  And your comments on why they're crowing about this?
[2:18:46.200 --> 2:18:47.320]  Bob's line just dropped.
[2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:48.400]  That happens sometimes.
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:50.120]  He's outside the United States.
[2:18:50.120 --> 2:18:51.720]  He'll call right back in.
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:18:52.720]  Hello?
[2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:54.480]  Bob, are you back?
[2:18:54.480 --> 2:18:55.480]  I can hear you.
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:18:57.520]  Yeah, you're a line dropper.
[2:18:57.520 --> 2:18:59.760]  Our connection to Genesis, they're in Minnesota.
[2:18:59.760 --> 2:19:00.760]  You're outside the country.
[2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:01.760]  I'm in Austin.
[2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:02.760]  Did you hear my question?
[2:19:02.760 --> 2:19:03.760]  Yes, I did.
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:04.760]  Okay.
[2:19:04.760 --> 2:19:05.760]  Go ahead.
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:13.680]  And the solution is by getting rid of 95% of the incumbents in Congress, even if they're
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:15.800]  marginally good, get them out.
[2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:20.440]  And the reason why is they, the new group hasn't been paid off yet.
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:25.920]  And if we can get to the new group and get one year out of them, out of the two or more
[2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:30.720]  years that they're there, if we can get one year out of them, we can get rid of the fed.
[2:19:30.720 --> 2:19:36.360]  If we can get rid of executive orders, the president's working group on financial markets,
[2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:37.360]  which is under that.
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:39.000]  All right, Bob, stay there.
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:42.200]  We're going to come back and let you have free reign really rolls that are being interrupted
[2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:44.360]  by cutouts and breaks.
[2:19:44.360 --> 2:19:49.920]  Because what you're saying is, even if politicians aren't perfect, but they're running against
[2:19:49.920 --> 2:19:55.400]  incumbents, it'll take time to train the new criminals that are being put in and slow down
[2:19:55.400 --> 2:19:56.800]  the whole system.
[2:19:56.800 --> 2:19:57.800]  Stay there.
[2:19:57.800 --> 2:20:01.640]  Try to head a breakdown, his plan, try to stop these people, and what's going to look
[2:20:01.640 --> 2:20:02.800]  like if we don't stop them?
[2:20:02.800 --> 2:20:08.080]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:09.080]  company?
[2:20:09.080 --> 2:20:10.080]  Don't.
[2:20:10.080 --> 2:20:13.000]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  Why pay?

[2:22:11.080 --> 2:22:15.440]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:16.440]  at home.
[2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:21.080]  We've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:22:21.080 --> 2:22:22.080]  calling the shots.
[2:22:22.080 --> 2:22:27.280]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:32.880]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[2:22:32.880 --> 2:22:37.600]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:22:37.600 --> 2:22:41.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[2:22:41.920 --> 2:22:44.120]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:50.000]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  of the Republic.

[2:23:07.040 --> 2:23:08.360]  begins in the colon?
[2:23:08.360 --> 2:23:13.440]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection
[2:23:13.440 --> 2:23:16.400]  if allowed our bodies are capable of healing themselves?
[2:23:16.400 --> 2:23:20.680]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat but also a healthy digestive system

[2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:12.760]  That fightin' spirit is gettin' fired up.
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:17.040]  You have found it, tip of the spear in the fight against the New World Order.
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:24.320]  Thank you for joining us.
[2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:25.600]  Let's go ahead and go back to Bob Chapman.
[2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:31.040]  Okay Bob, recap, go back to what you were saying, run through ways to stop these people
[2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:33.520]  and if we don't stop them, what they're planning to do, go ahead.
[2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:41.320]  And I thought your comment was very, very good and that is the criminal training school.
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:46.440]  And so it'll take them six months to a year to get a hold of these people and financially
[2:24:46.440 --> 2:24:49.200]  throttle them with money.
[2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:56.120]  And so we've got that window of opportunity if we can execute getting rid of them.
[2:24:56.120 --> 2:25:02.320]  And those things that I spoke about and probably many others are on the agenda, the reversal
[2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:09.920]  of legislation such as the extension of the Patriots and things of that sort.
[2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:12.760]  And there's a lot of things to be done.
[2:25:12.760 --> 2:25:21.800]  But that's why I said if the Illuminates were smart, they would pull this business of tipping
[2:25:21.800 --> 2:25:27.960]  over these 16 countries into bankruptcy in October, but they won't do that because I
[2:25:27.960 --> 2:25:34.320]  don't think it fits into their timetable, although they fully realize what we have been
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:39.840]  able to accomplish through talk radio and in the internet in informing the people and
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:44.680]  that's why they really want to do that is get rid of the people in Congress because
[2:25:44.680 --> 2:25:48.280]  they know they're not responding to the wishes at all.
[2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:56.280]  And so sometime thereafter and probably over the next year and a quarter or so, that event
[2:25:56.280 --> 2:26:02.240]  will take place where they decide that they're going to have that meeting and they're going
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:03.880]  to tip them all into bankruptcy.
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:10.280]  And the reason they're doing it that way is that all the countries can tell the people
[2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:19.520]  of their countries, look, Iceland went under, Latvia went under, Greece and Italy went under
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:21.160]  and the United States went under.
[2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:23.880]  So don't look at us like we're different.
[2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:28.960]  I mean, we just do what we were told to do by the other central banks.
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:34.040]  And if we don't do what the central banks tell us, it will be an even worse global
[2:26:34.040 --> 2:26:35.040]  depression.
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:39.760]  Aren't we lucky these bankers happen to loan us our own money back that they got in the
[2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:41.760]  bank or bailout worldwide.
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:45.760]  Isn't it just so sweet of them and they're moving to internet censorship, they're moving
[2:26:45.760 --> 2:26:50.080]  to pass the carbon tax, they're moving to get the healthcare takeover, they're racing
[2:26:50.080 --> 2:26:54.480]  to the finish line because they know people are waking up to them.
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:27:01.680]  And they're not going to get them passed, but more importantly in that particular movement
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:07.880]  of taking these countries into bankruptcy is misery loves company.
[2:27:07.880 --> 2:27:12.880]  And they can, through disinformation and propaganda, be funneled of people who will
[2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:16.720]  then think, gee, everybody's doing it so it's okay.
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:18.040]  And that's what their plan is.
[2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:22.680]  Well, it's financial terrorism, just like we heard back in October 2008.
[2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:25.860]  You must have the banker bailout, which is really a banker takeover.
[2:27:25.860 --> 2:27:28.200]  We must have this global constitution of the banks.
[2:27:28.200 --> 2:27:29.720]  We're lucky they're here to save us.
[2:27:29.720 --> 2:27:30.960]  I'm Glenn Beck.
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:31.960]  We've got to have it.
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:36.080]  You can trust me, just like I told you in 2008, we need the banker bailout.
[2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:38.240]  And anybody that's against it wants depression.
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:39.320]  I'm Glenn Beck.
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:41.320]  You can trust me.
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:47.560]  Well, with his background, I don't know about that, but I mean, look for him to do that.
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:50.800]  I'm saying look for him at that key point to pull a Judas Iscariot.
[2:27:50.800 --> 2:27:55.040]  Well, I think he's in that process already.
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:28:00.600]  I read a background around him and this guy has had a very interesting and somewhat negative
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:03.800]  life thus far.
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:07.200]  And I didn't know it was as bad as it was.
[2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:14.160]  But when I hear to talk about the losers in society, we're talking about things that will
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:19.960]  make American citizens winners, to get rid of the garbage that's running not only our
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:25.920]  country but our world and expose them for what they are and bring them to trial civilly
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:29.640]  as well as criminally for the things that they've done.
[2:28:29.640 --> 2:28:34.320]  And so that's the path I think things are going to take.
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:41.400]  And I think we'll have a short period of higher inflation leading into next year.
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:47.320]  How high I can't anticipate at this time, I can't really anticipate all of the timing.
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:50.000]  I'm guessing as best I can.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:54.440]  But that's what I think that they're up to because they could have taken Greece under
[2:28:54.440 --> 2:28:55.440]  10 years ago.
[2:28:55.440 --> 2:29:05.680]  I mean, it's always been a cauldron of criminality, the government, big business, and they really
[2:29:05.680 --> 2:29:12.080]  don't have much that they export with the exception of the shipping business and some
[2:29:12.080 --> 2:29:14.720]  olive oil and some other things.
[2:29:14.720 --> 2:29:19.320]  And so it was easy for them to choose them.
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:27.280]  And I think in the case of Iceland, the negotiations, the people from Iceland walked out on them
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:33.280]  yesterday, the British and the Dutch want them to guarantee the money that was lost
[2:29:33.280 --> 2:29:36.640]  in the banks and they're going to have a referendum and I think the people are going to turn it
[2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:37.920]  down anyway.
[2:29:37.920 --> 2:29:42.680]  Let's talk about that on the other side because Iceland is an example of people saying no,
[2:29:42.680 --> 2:29:45.160]  this could be a model here in the United States.
[2:29:45.160 --> 2:29:48.360]  For those that don't know what happened in Iceland, we'll break it down on the other
[2:29:48.360 --> 2:29:49.360]  side.
[2:29:49.360 --> 2:29:52.960]  Stay with us.
[2:29:52.960 --> 2:29:56.640]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[2:30:06.360 --> 2:30:07.360]  type of system.
[2:30:07.360 --> 2:30:10.320]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[2:30:10.320 --> 2:30:15.440]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[2:31:01.480 --> 2:31:05.800]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:31:05.800 --> 2:31:10.160]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:11.160]  do you want?
[2:31:11.160 --> 2:31:13.160]  My answer would be all I can get.
[2:31:13.160 --> 2:31:18.160]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[2:31:18.160 --> 2:31:19.400]  How much do you want?
[2:31:19.400 --> 2:31:20.400]  When do you want it?
[2:31:20.400 --> 2:31:22.480]  Now or after the battle starts?
[2:31:22.480 --> 2:31:23.600]  When will you need it?
[2:31:23.600 --> 2:31:25.720]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:31:25.720 --> 2:31:27.080]  Will there be any food?
[2:31:27.080 --> 2:31:28.540]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:31:28.540 --> 2:31:32.680]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:31:32.680 --> 2:31:33.840]  and be immunized?
[2:31:33.840 --> 2:31:37.640]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:31:37.640 --> 2:31:41.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:31:41.200 --> 2:31:42.440]  How much will you need?
[2:31:42.440 --> 2:31:43.440]  We don't know.
[2:31:43.440 --> 2:31:44.440]  How much do you want?
[2:31:44.440 --> 2:31:45.440]  All you can get.
[2:31:45.440 --> 2:31:46.440]  I'm Alex Jones.

[2:34:03.920 --> 2:34:08.440]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible,
[2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:11.920]  one of them is eFoodsDirect.com, the best storeable foods company out there, I bought
[2:34:11.920 --> 2:34:17.280]  storeable foods from a few other places and it had MSG in it or was made outside the country
[2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:21.680]  or was 10 years old and so I did research and found out eFoodsDirect.com, the J. Michael
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:26.160]  Stevens group is the oldest, the biggest, the best, non-GMO, non-hybrid, they've got

[2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:42.920]  controlled, 10 years in non-climate controlled, like in my garage the last 10 years, really
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:44.840]  longer if they say 10 years.

[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.920]  All right, going back to Bob Chapman, Bob, I want to get to calls, but you were getting
[2:35:41.920 --> 2:35:47.480]  into how they're using this crisis they created to get world government, Gordon Brown, Von
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:51.760]  Rumpi, these bankers, as you know, they're all over the news bragging, we got even more
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:57.800]  power out of the banking crisis, aha, the world's our oyster, the world is mine, like
[2:35:57.800 --> 2:36:03.440]  Tony Montana looking at a blimp, flying by saying the world is yours and that music pumping
[2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:05.080]  in the background.
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:11.040]  And they're saying in all their press releases out of the crisis, world government, carbon
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:15.560]  taxes on everything, we have this new secret UN document, I want to read some quotes from
[2:36:15.560 --> 2:36:16.560]  in a moment.
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:23.600]  I mean, they're out in the open doing this and you're now saying that you're moving
[2:36:23.600 --> 2:36:30.400]  up your timeline, this could happen this year even, if we don't succeed in having grand
[2:36:30.400 --> 2:36:34.840]  juries and bankers or exposed these made off type people, where do we go from here?
[2:36:34.840 --> 2:36:39.440]  Well, I think it's going to get pretty nasty because they're going to go right along with
[2:36:39.440 --> 2:36:40.440]  their program.
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:46.120]  They'll have people in the house in the Senate in the United States, many of them who have
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:54.040]  been there before who were totally paid off and everything that the bankers and Wall
[2:36:54.040 --> 2:37:00.960]  Street and other powerful people behind government want to happen will happen and will be enslaved
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:02.600]  for generations.
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:08.000]  It'll be the beginning of the end.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:18.560]  Like Argentina, which is getting worse again, and they're really in for real trouble again.
[2:37:18.560 --> 2:37:25.240]  It's only been 10 years since their last default and devaluation and it's going to happen again.
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:27.280]  And it's a leadership in the country.
[2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:32.560]  They just did the new group, the president and then his wife became president.
[2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:35.240]  They just looting the country.
[2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:43.240]  It's terrible and you know, Buenos Aires is not the way it used to be.
[2:37:43.240 --> 2:37:48.440]  There's a terrible lot of crime and it's in your face.
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:55.320]  Ted Anderson went down there with his wife a few months ago and he said it was like,
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:37:57.280]  it was like Blade Runner.
[2:37:57.280 --> 2:38:02.680]  He just said good looking, these were not drunk homeless people, good looking families
[2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:08.400]  with kids in doorways, literally living out of bags just everywhere.
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:11.720]  And that's true and the crime is everywhere.
[2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:17.680]  The attitude of the police is Gestapo like and you know, it's serious.
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:23.280]  I mean, I've been there a couple of times here in the last couple of years and it's
[2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:24.280]  a shame.
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:31.800]  It's a beautiful city and it's just a terrible shame, but they're in for trouble again.
[2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:34.800]  And that's not even in the group of 16.
[2:38:34.800 --> 2:38:42.200]  And in fact, even in the group of 16, I didn't include Japan and let's go over the 16 nations.
[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:44.000]  You say you're going belly up.
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  Okay.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:49.600]  We've got the United States, the United Kingdom.
[2:38:49.600 --> 2:38:57.960]  We have Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain.
[2:38:57.960 --> 2:39:03.400]  We have Kazakhstan, which is lots of natural resources.
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:15.000]  And we've got the Ukraine and Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania and Poland.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:19.400]  And then we can throw in Japan and Argentina as well.
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:25.720]  And there will be some nations that will suffer, but not nearly as much as others.
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:34.000]  I think Australia and Canada and Switzerland and Norway will do reasonably well under the
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:35.960]  circumstances.
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:41.520]  And I think a number of countries, even though they're going to have a tremendous drop in
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:48.560]  exports from their country to others, I think Asia will do reasonably well as will Latin
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:49.560]  America.
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:56.200]  One of the reasons why is most of them did not have leveraged loans or leveraged real
[2:39:56.200 --> 2:39:57.700]  estate.
[2:39:57.700 --> 2:40:03.160]  You go to most of those countries, people build their houses for cash.
[2:40:03.160 --> 2:40:09.000]  And so you don't have this leverage like America and to an extent Canada.
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  All right.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  Let's go back.
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:14.800]  So we have this predatory banking group imploding the world in their own documents by design
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:19.920]  to consolidate power, going into the next phase of looting and control, bragging, laughing
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:21.000]  to themselves.
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:26.920]  Let's go back to Iceland in a nutshell what happened there and their population saying
[2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:30.240]  no.
[2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:41.080]  The use of fractional banking as high as 70 times deposits by the banks when eight to
[2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:48.280]  ten is normal under fractional banking and the collapse of the system, mainly because
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:54.280]  they made a lot of bad decisions, but particularly with CDOs and collateralized debt obligation
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:59.920]  bonds, which came from America, which contain mortgages.
[2:40:59.920 --> 2:41:05.640]  And so the bank has put the country down, we'll just say simply because of incompetence.
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:06.640]  We know it's different.
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:13.560]  But anyway, it was the first example of a test by the international bankers.
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:23.160]  And now the Netherlands and England want the depositors who are in the banks that had
[2:41:23.160 --> 2:41:28.360]  branches from Iceland into those countries, they want to pay back.
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:31.600]  And let's be clear.
[2:41:31.600 --> 2:41:39.080]  They're using anti-terror laws in the last year through England and the Dutch to seize
[2:41:39.080 --> 2:41:45.400]  people's bank accounts, to supposedly pay the national debt, which was all made up and
[2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:51.800]  Max Kaiser was in Iceland and others have that we've had on members of their parliament
[2:41:51.800 --> 2:41:59.840]  with Goldman Sachs people there two years ago bragging at multiple guests.
[2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:05.440]  And I mean, talk about how they're just bragging that they set them up and it comes out in
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:10.920]  the McClatchy newspapers, a five-part series last year, we had the author on, with internal
[2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:16.160]  Goldman Sachs documents, how they engineered the whole thing to consolidate power and destroy
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:17.160]  their competition.
[2:42:17.160 --> 2:42:20.800]  I mean, these are financial terrorists.
[2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:22.200]  And that's what Max calls them.
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:24.240]  And Max does a very good job.
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:31.320]  I carry his tapes like I carry yours in my publication every week because I want to get
[2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:39.400]  the word out by people like yourself and Max that I can't do because I don't have the time
[2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:41.440]  and it's wonderful information.
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:44.920]  So it goes in there.
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:51.440]  And so they want the people of Iceland, and there's not very many of them, to pay this
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:55.240]  money back and the negotiations are broken down.
[2:42:55.240 --> 2:42:57.880]  There's a referendum coming in Iceland.
[2:42:57.880 --> 2:42:59.880]  Do we pay these people a don't we?
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:02.000]  And they're going to say, no, we didn't do it.
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:03.280]  The bank has did it.
[2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:04.880]  Why should we pay for it?
[2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:09.360]  And even a month ago, the Times of London and other publications reported, the bankers
[2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:14.920]  are now saying, okay, we didn't know this before, but it turns out our own bank assets
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:17.920]  in your country will pay back almost all of this.
[2:43:17.920 --> 2:43:20.680]  See, the banks were never even in trouble.
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:22.040]  The offshore banks.
[2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:27.000]  And so now, so they won't have a defeat if the people say no, they're like, oh, guess
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  what?
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  We already had the money.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:30.560]  It's all just a fraud.
[2:43:30.560 --> 2:43:39.960]  Well, what they want to do besides make sure all of the gang of banksters have the money
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:45.320]  that they need and the power that they need on the other flip side of that is they want
[2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:48.600]  to bring on austerity.
[2:43:48.600 --> 2:43:54.600]  And that will happen in the starting already, but it'll happen in a big way after this large
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:44:02.280]  meeting that I think is going to happen, a revaluation, devaluation, default, et cetera.
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:08.600]  In fact, they're putting tremendous pressure on Japan right now to purchase more treasury
[2:44:08.600 --> 2:44:11.680]  securities to make up for what China's not buying.
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:17.360]  Well, Bob, I mean, I saw headlines last week with top Harvard professor advises Fed for
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:20.560]  national austerity, everything must go to the bankers.
[2:44:20.560 --> 2:44:23.960]  It looks like they're getting us ready for shock therapy.
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:25.040]  That's right.
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:28.520]  And that austerity is on its way.
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:35.960]  And that's why I think that they're going to finally get into deflationary, deflationary
[2:44:35.960 --> 2:44:37.400]  depression.
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:42.320]  And that's horrible because that means that once it gets underway, there's no stopping
[2:44:42.320 --> 2:44:43.320]  it.
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:45.040]  It could last 30, 40 or 50 years.
[2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:51.880]  I mean, last time we had it, it lasted 10 years during the 1930s and we had another war.
[2:44:51.880 --> 2:44:53.560]  And that got us out of it.
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:45:01.240]  But this time, I think, with all of the austerity and the financial changes we'll call them,
[2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:03.120]  we're going to have another war.
[2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:05.600]  And if you look at history, it's all there.
[2:45:05.600 --> 2:45:11.320]  They will do the same thing over again, only this time we're going to bag them.
[2:45:11.320 --> 2:45:13.160]  And they've got their police state grid in place.
[2:45:13.160 --> 2:45:17.200]  They think it's going to help them carry this out when the people say no.
[2:45:17.200 --> 2:45:22.120]  Here's a infoawards.net, Steve Watson, article, prominent investor.
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:24.320]  Pound could collapse within weeks.
[2:45:24.320 --> 2:45:27.880]  British currency is on the brink, according to billionaire financier.
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:32.320]  Billionaire financier Jim Rogers has predicted the British pound could completely collapse
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:37.400]  within weeks, sending shock waves throughout the global economy and heralding the beginning
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:38.400]  of a downturn.
[2:45:38.400 --> 2:45:43.200]  Human sorrows are running around cheerleading all this now because they want it.
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:52.200]  Well, that's because they're currently long dollar, short the euro, and they're long gold.
[2:45:52.200 --> 2:45:56.880]  And in Jimmy's case, long commodities as well.
[2:45:56.880 --> 2:46:00.520]  And I do have that piece in tomorrow's issue, incidentally.
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:06.920]  And Jimmy came out later today and said, I never said that.
[2:46:06.920 --> 2:46:12.200]  But we have the video, but I mean, we have, I mean, what is he thinking about?
[2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:15.520]  I mean, he has the stain.
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:16.760]  He has the stain for the public.
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:18.760]  It's like Lindbeck says global warming isn't real.
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:22.240]  And then when he talks to a liberal publication, USA Today, oh, I believe it.
[2:46:22.240 --> 2:46:23.240]  It's all real.
[2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:24.240]  It's great.
[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:25.240]  It's good.
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:26.240]  I mean, we need it.
[2:46:26.240 --> 2:46:31.680]  I mean, we need, we need these carbon taxes, Bob, I want to go to some phone calls here.
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:34.000]  And I'm sure they'll be all over the map, but that's fine.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.400]  Let's talk to Shanky in Georgia.
[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:37.400]  We're on the air.
[2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:38.400]  Go ahead.
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:39.400]  Hey, Alex, Bob.
[2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:40.400]  Thanks for having me on.
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:46.800]  Alex, thanks for being positive and delivering such a great message for all this and Bob
[2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:52.840]  and Max and Webster and, I mean, everybody you've got on is just so solid.
[2:46:52.840 --> 2:46:57.280]  And then all the guys that you've got doing the writing and posting is really wonderful.
[2:46:57.280 --> 2:46:58.280]  It's very informative.
[2:46:58.280 --> 2:47:00.280]  I really appreciate it.
[2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:04.960]  Hitting up on something Bob just was talking about Max Kaiser was yesterday on a video.
[2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:09.960]  If you Google Max Kaiser on Inside Story, Greek depth crisis, he says the same thing
[2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:15.400]  about Greeks as Bob just said about, why the heck don't these people just fight back?
[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:16.400]  Why do they accept it?
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:20.880]  Why do they just sit on their butts and, you know, accept these austerity measures?
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:27.120]  But my main question for Bob is, and you've kind of discussed it, but Bob, where is all
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:28.120]  the money going?
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:32.400]  I mean, it's so plain and sawvious that we're being robbed by our tax dollars being taken
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:33.400]  from us left and right.
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:37.760]  What they do is they engineer crises, they mass all the bailout money, then shut the
[2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:40.240]  economy off and then buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:42.240]  Very simple, Bob.
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:43.240]  Exactly.
[2:47:43.240 --> 2:47:47.960]  And the money in the case of the Loggerbacks in the United States and in some median-sized
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:55.240]  banks is sitting over at the Federal Reserve in the form of a digit on a computer.
[2:47:55.240 --> 2:47:57.440]  And that's what they're doing with the money.
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:47:59.480]  Yeah, for just fake digits.
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:02.520]  I mean, for just made-up digits, they get the whole world.
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:09.440]  Well, that's what they think, but we're informing the public of the world, Alex, not just down
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:10.440]  the street here.
[2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:15.560]  I mean, you should see the emails I get from everywhere.
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:17.320]  We understand what you're saying.
[2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:18.520]  We know this is going on.
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:24.480]  We're passing the word through our country, whether it's Malaysia was yesterday, Germany
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:27.680]  was the day before, it's everywhere.
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:32.160]  The public is waking up and they're not going to get away with it.
[2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:33.160]  I agree.
[2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:34.160]  Shanking anything else?
[2:48:34.160 --> 2:48:35.160]  Yeah.
[2:48:35.160 --> 2:48:41.480]  I agree with the total deflationary thing that Bob's mentioned and that we've got to just
[2:48:41.480 --> 2:48:42.480]  deflate everything.
[2:48:42.480 --> 2:48:47.200]  I was a little bit more hopeful that we would be able to deflate to a point where we could
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:51.360]  afford to manufacture in this country again and come out of this mess.
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:55.640]  But as Dr. Roberts says, we're already so industrialized, that's not going to work.
[2:48:55.640 --> 2:48:59.680]  Yeah, but if you set up tariffs, Alex, it'll work.
[2:48:59.680 --> 2:49:06.160]  It'll take a while, but it won't be worthwhile for a transnational conglomerate from the
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:09.160]  United States to make something in China and send it back to the government.
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:13.800]  But that's why they're going to selectively enforce the carbon taxes, so we're not allowed
[2:49:13.800 --> 2:49:17.040]  to and then China and India and Mexico don't have to.
[2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:20.680]  They're not going to get them passed.
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:21.960]  I have decreed it.
[2:49:21.960 --> 2:49:24.480]  No, I'm guessing that they won't get them passed.
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:27.000]  I mean, everything is upside down in Washington.
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.600]  They're running around like a bunch of chickens that get their heads cut off.
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:33.600]  And they're buried in the biggest snow in 50 years, literally buried.
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:37.280]  The government's so corrupt, most of their snow plows are broken down with lazy bureaucrats
[2:49:37.280 --> 2:49:38.800]  standing around.
[2:49:38.800 --> 2:49:39.800]  These people are crazy.
[2:49:39.800 --> 2:49:42.760]  I mean, they, I mean, crazy like a fox, but they're going to lose.
[2:49:42.760 --> 2:49:44.880]  Shanky, I appreciate your call.
[2:49:44.880 --> 2:49:45.880]  Bob, go ahead.
[2:49:45.880 --> 2:49:49.960]  Alex, I did the Lord works in strange ways.
[2:49:49.960 --> 2:49:51.720]  It's ridiculous.
[2:49:51.720 --> 2:49:52.720]  And think about climate.
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:56.360]  They now admit everything's alive, but they're still going to go ahead with it.
[2:49:56.360 --> 2:50:02.520]  Well, the public is, is realizing what they're up to again.
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:05.520]  We got to keep on doing what we're doing and we're going to win.
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:10.120]  We're on the path and we have the momentum and they don't.
[2:50:10.120 --> 2:50:15.080]  Well, I know a lot of people prayed to God to, uh, and the globalists are trying to play
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:19.040]  God with all their weather control machines that Bill Gates has patented and using.
[2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:25.840]  We all prayed to God that people that that the population be informed about global warming
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:30.040]  being a fraud and look at the snowstorms hitting the whole planet, Bob.
[2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:35.200]  Well, I, I try to call Al Gore today and he wouldn't answer the phone.
[2:50:35.200 --> 2:50:39.040]  I just asked him about global warming.
[2:50:39.040 --> 2:50:40.040]  Stay there, Bob.
[2:50:40.040 --> 2:50:42.640]  We're going to come back and talk to Adam, Kip, Jimmy, Matt, Kyle and others.
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:43.640]  I'll see you, Bob.
[2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:45.160]  Can stay five minutes to the next hour.
[2:50:45.160 --> 2:50:49.920]  Then we've got the founder and head webmaster at krypton.org coming up.
[2:50:49.920 --> 2:50:55.040]  They got shut down outside the law government didn't like what they were doing.
[2:50:55.040 --> 2:50:57.760]  Microsoft gave the order will be right back.
[2:50:57.760 --> 2:51:02.880]  Stay with us.
[2:51:02.880 --> 2:51:06.160]  Money talks and it sounds just like Jim Kramer.
[2:51:06.160 --> 2:51:12.960]  I'm Kramer, money talks and sometimes it shouts when the results speak for themselves.
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:19.320]  Investors worldwide follow Jim Kramer's advice on TV in books and on websites like the street.com.
[2:51:19.320 --> 2:51:23.800]  And whether the markets up, down or sideways, Jim's always hunting down a bull market.

[2:51:27.400 --> 2:51:29.520]  Okay, here's how it works.

[2:51:33.960 --> 2:51:34.960]  I had a time.
[2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:38.000]  It's like, if you can read, you can read my mind.

[2:51:43.600 --> 2:51:47.000]  And I'll share it with you at getkramer.com.

[2:52:04.080 --> 2:52:07.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:10.960]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:10.960 --> 2:52:15.320]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:16.320]  at home.
[2:52:16.320 --> 2:52:21.480]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[2:52:21.480 --> 2:52:22.480]  shots.
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:27.320]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:27.320 --> 2:52:32.800]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[2:52:32.800 --> 2:52:37.480]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:37.480 --> 2:52:39.880]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:52:39.880 --> 2:52:43.960]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:52:43.960 --> 2:52:45.800]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:51.240]  And right now, in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:55.680]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[2:52:55.680 --> 2:53:04.880]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:53:04.880 --> 2:53:11.160]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across a nation are preparing for the worst.
[2:53:11.160 --> 2:53:13.360]  The world is changing fast.
[2:53:13.360 --> 2:53:15.600]  Are you fully prepared?
[2:53:15.600 --> 2:53:18.840]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[2:53:18.840 --> 2:53:27.320]  At www.patriotfood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned
[2:53:27.320 --> 2:53:29.600]  meat for half price.
[2:53:29.600 --> 2:53:37.880]  And at survivalistseeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over
[2:53:37.880 --> 2:53:41.080]  10,000 heirloom seeds.
[2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:46.120]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[2:53:46.120 --> 2:53:50.520]  www.patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[2:53:50.520 --> 2:53:53.320]  Food insurance just in case.
[2:53:53.320 --> 2:54:05.640]  Owned by me, Big John Lufstem, host of Don't Tread on Me Radio Show.
[2:54:05.640 --> 2:54:09.080]  Bob will be with us under five minutes of the next hour.
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:14.440]  leaked UN documents reveal plan for green world order by 2012.
[2:54:14.440 --> 2:54:21.000]  Here's the actual UN document and that's the actual Jimmy Vaughn plan.
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:24.160]  Another great patriot.
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:29.440]  Now add Stephen King to the list.
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:36.480]  But reading this, it says green world order, the capstone of which will be carbon taxes,
[2:54:36.480 --> 2:54:45.080]  focus, political document calling for a radical redistribution of 45 trillion transfer of
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:48.120]  wealth from richer nations.
[2:54:48.120 --> 2:54:51.720]  These are quotes from this internal UN plan.
[2:54:51.720 --> 2:54:56.760]  This is like having the document of people planning to rob the bank down the street and
[2:54:56.760 --> 2:55:00.680]  no one gets in trouble.
[2:55:00.680 --> 2:55:02.280]  Just incredible.
[2:55:02.280 --> 2:55:04.600]  Let's go to Adam in Texas here on the air with Bob Chapman.
[2:55:04.600 --> 2:55:05.600]  Go ahead.
[2:55:05.600 --> 2:55:06.600]  Hey there, Alex.
[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:09.760]  Mr. Chapman, it's a privilege to speak with both of you.
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:13.720]  I'm going to be off the map here, and I apologize for that, but I'll be brief.
[2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:18.760]  Time is of the essence here in Texas, and I'll be the first to say there's a treasure
[2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:24.160]  thing that Ms. Medina did, certainly I think took advantage of your platform just a bit.
[2:55:24.160 --> 2:55:28.520]  Now, it's really ticked off about that, but I kind of went through a progression and I'd
[2:55:28.520 --> 2:55:33.960]  like to get your thoughts on this and maybe appeal to your sense of perspective and purpose
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:34.960]  and all this mess.
[2:55:34.960 --> 2:55:38.880]  Mr. Chapman said, you know, the best thing we can do at this point is, you know, bring
[2:55:38.880 --> 2:55:42.800]  people back home that are in political office right now, and I think that's where we need
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:43.800]  to start here in Texas.
[2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:48.760]  So if you go through the progression, that's what Mrs. Medina did was certainly a blow
[2:55:48.760 --> 2:55:49.760]  to my heart.
[2:55:49.760 --> 2:55:53.200]  Like I said, it was very ticked off, but I'm just curious, you know, what's the other
[2:55:53.200 --> 2:55:54.200]  option?
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:55.200]  I mean...
[2:55:55.200 --> 2:55:57.200]  Well, let me say something here, and then we'll get Bob's take on it.
[2:55:57.200 --> 2:55:58.200]  Okay.
[2:55:58.200 --> 2:56:02.040]  For those that just tuned in, other parts of the country and the world, a contested primary
[2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:06.880]  for the Republican Party nomination for governor in Texas, Debra Medina comes out, goes on
[2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:11.040]  Glenn Beck, says people have a right to question 9-11.
[2:56:11.040 --> 2:56:15.800]  She loses about five, six points in the polls, does a bunch of other interviews saying it's
[2:56:15.800 --> 2:56:18.640]  healthy, it's good to question, people have a right.
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:22.160]  Then she went on Dallas radio and said it was, you know, and agreed that it was despicable
[2:56:22.160 --> 2:56:25.400]  and horrible and that 9-11 truth is a cult.
[2:56:25.400 --> 2:56:29.320]  It's, and then of course I told you her people would misrepresent and unfortunately some
[2:56:29.320 --> 2:56:33.920]  of them did, that I was saying she's bad because she's not a 9-11 truth.
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:37.480]  And I said over and over again, that's not the issue, but that's how deception works,
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:40.520]  which makes me more concerned, frankly, about her campaign.
[2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:46.440]  I know, I said we need a response and we're four days into this, no response to 9-11 truth
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:48.240]  about how we're suddenly despicable.
[2:56:48.240 --> 2:56:55.320]  It's the flip-flop from we're healthy and good, that's a quote, to we're now despicable,
[2:56:55.320 --> 2:56:59.400]  but certainly I said yesterday, I said today, go ahead and vote for Medina.
[2:56:59.400 --> 2:57:01.120]  I don't think she's a bad person.
[2:57:01.120 --> 2:57:06.120]  I agree with a lot of things she's saying, but I, I have a right to be hurt and to say
[2:57:06.120 --> 2:57:09.040]  that's wrong and will you flip-flop on other things?
[2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:10.040]  Bob Chapman.
[2:57:10.040 --> 2:57:12.840]  I think you've covered it.
[2:57:12.840 --> 2:57:19.920]  I think it is the way you've said it is and, and she's not everything that you'd wanted
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:22.520]  to be, but she's certainly better than the other two.
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:28.400]  Yeah, I just don't like this lesser of two evil things when somebody says, I'm a rock.
[2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:31.120]  When I say something, that's the way it is.
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:38.520]  And it was the enjoyment of, are they just, you know, despicable cult of dangerous scum?
[2:57:38.520 --> 2:57:41.960]  Absolutely, absolutely Mark Davis.
[2:57:41.960 --> 2:57:43.200]  I agree.
[2:57:43.200 --> 2:57:48.400]  It's ridiculous that I would even imagine to be involved with those people.
[2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:51.520]  And then I'm like, my God, what a betrayal.
[2:57:51.520 --> 2:57:56.360]  99% of the emails and calls we've gotten are people totally agree, but I've moved on.
[2:57:56.360 --> 2:57:58.240]  I just said yesterday, go ahead and vote for us.
[2:57:58.240 --> 2:58:00.000]  Did they go ahead and vote for her?
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:02.360]  But now I don't have a good feeling.
[2:58:02.360 --> 2:58:05.640]  I mean, I'll tell you that, but we know what Kay Bailey and Perry are.
[2:58:05.640 --> 2:58:07.360]  I mean, we know they're devils.
[2:58:07.360 --> 2:58:13.920]  And with your logic, that's really my logic of even if somebody's new and it takes a
[2:58:13.920 --> 2:58:18.200]  while for them to politically break them, that will give us some time.
[2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:21.040]  And maybe it'll turn out if she was elected governor that was the real deal.
[2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:26.400]  The thing is, the Beck situation lost her, depending on the poll, five to 10 points she
[2:58:26.400 --> 2:58:30.320]  would have gained and five to eight points she had through different polls.
[2:58:30.320 --> 2:58:37.080]  So she lost any way you slice it, 10 points with her Beck thing, not because of 9 11 truth,
[2:58:37.080 --> 2:58:40.040]  but the flip flopping that day coming out.
[2:58:40.040 --> 2:58:42.040]  I mean, it's, it's bad news.

[2:59:55.600 --> 3:00:10.600]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:10.600 --> 3:00:19.400]  Our number four, final hour, founder of krypton.org coming up.
[3:00:19.400 --> 3:00:22.720]  Big defenders of the First Amendment on the Internet tied into the Electronic Frontiers
[3:00:22.720 --> 3:00:23.720]  Foundation.
[3:00:23.720 --> 3:00:27.800]  Let's talk to Kip in Illinois, you're only here with Bob Chapman, go ahead.
[3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:34.040]  It's great to talk to you and Bob and I support everything you guys are doing and I commend
[3:00:34.040 --> 3:00:38.360]  Nigel for standing up and speaking out against Von Humphrey.
[3:00:38.360 --> 3:00:46.320]  Yeah, that's what I meant, but I picked up the paper this morning and I was reading
[3:00:46.320 --> 3:00:47.320]  it.
[3:00:47.320 --> 3:00:51.800]  One of our representatives is proposing a bill to criminally charge people for using
[3:00:51.800 --> 3:00:57.480]  radio scanners and monitor police and emergency frequencies and they claim, oh, it's just
[3:00:57.480 --> 3:01:02.680]  to monitor the bad guys, none of the media or anybody who listens at home will be affected
[3:01:02.680 --> 3:01:06.920]  by it, but it was just something that blew my mind to see that in my own paper.
[3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:09.920]  Well, your phone's breaking up a little bit, but I appreciate your call.
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:12.080]  Did you understand what he was saying, Bob?
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:20.760]  Perfectly, and I agree with him and for several years when I lived in the Los Angeles area,
[3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:27.360]  I used to monitor the calls as well because we had the Watts Riots in 1964 and that's
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:33.480]  when it started because you want to know what's going on, particularly if it's in your neighborhood
[3:01:33.480 --> 3:01:39.120]  and we know all the police calls and everything and there was nothing that we did other than
[3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:48.480]  listen to try to protect ourselves and I think that sort of thing is wrong to have legislation
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:51.800]  that keeps you from listening to what the police are talking about.
[3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:52.800]  Well, it's worse than that.
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:57.400]  I mean, Oklahoma passed a law where you can't put burglar bars on your house because the
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:02:00.560]  government, I guess, wants the criminals to get in so they can get in.
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:03.320]  You can't even fortify your house with more than three locks on the door.
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:08.160]  I mean, imagine criminals running government and what they would do and that's everything
[3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:09.160]  they're doing.
[3:02:09.160 --> 3:02:10.160]  Let's jam in one more.
[3:02:10.160 --> 3:02:13.200]  We're going to plug in an actual forecaster for folks out there.
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:15.440]  Let's talk to Jimmy in Arizona.
[3:02:15.440 --> 3:02:16.440]  You're on the air.
[3:02:16.440 --> 3:02:17.440]  That's a great show.
[3:02:17.440 --> 3:02:22.640]  Hey, Bob, I was wondering if you could comment on the allegations that came out earlier this
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:26.440]  week that Alex Jones is a phony who can't handle his money.
[3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:28.480]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[3:02:28.480 --> 3:02:32.600]  You guys are pathetic and the more Hollywood stars we get on, the more and we play the
[3:02:32.600 --> 3:02:36.320]  Stephen King stuff next week will just get more jealous and make up whatever you want
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:37.320]  about me.
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:38.320]  I love it.
[3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:39.320]  Okay.
[3:02:39.320 --> 3:02:41.400]  Keep sending me any five listeners you've got.
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:42.400]  I love it.
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:44.080]  I appreciate your call, Jimmy.
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:46.160]  Bob, you've talked about this before.
[3:02:46.160 --> 3:02:51.040]  When somebody's number one, which you've been number one in your field, I mean, it's almost
[3:02:51.040 --> 3:02:52.040]  like a soap opera.
[3:02:52.040 --> 3:02:54.880]  The new lies that get told the next week, hadn't it?
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:55.880]  That's right.
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:02:58.880]  They want to knock you down no matter who you are.
[3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:03.760]  They want to be first and they can't be and they're jealous.
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:09.960]  It's a terrible thing and I've seen it over and over in my lifetime and it makes me very
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:14.280]  unhappy that human nature can be that way.
[3:03:14.280 --> 3:03:21.320]  You would think if people are doing something right and helping other people that it would
[3:03:21.320 --> 3:03:23.000]  be looked on kindly.
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:28.360]  Unfortunately, there are those people out there who are malcontents and that's okay.
[3:03:28.360 --> 3:03:30.040]  God made us all different.
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:32.240]  Well, Bob, I made mistakes early on.
[3:03:32.240 --> 3:03:39.160]  I was way too trusting and parasites, grifters, people with fake names, crooks, tried all
[3:03:39.160 --> 3:03:41.240]  sorts of stuff and I discovered it and it was good.
[3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:47.800]  It was a growing experience for me and we're just excited we're having such success and
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:52.520]  we're going to move forward and continue to wake everybody up and that's just the end
[3:03:52.520 --> 3:03:53.520]  of it.
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:56.480]  That's the end of it.
[3:03:56.480 --> 3:04:01.760]  All the fraud, all of it, I trust in God and every time I get persecuted, suddenly it's
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:04.240]  as if the streets are paved in gold for me.
[3:04:04.240 --> 3:04:08.240]  All these other doors open and I just trust in God 110%.
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:13.200]  Bob, tell folks about the International Forecaster, go to internationalforecaster.com and you
[3:04:13.200 --> 3:04:17.600]  have that number where they can call and get a free copy, a sample hard copy.
[3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:29.800]  I certainly do, that's 877-479-8178, toll free, 877-479-8178, free copy either by email,
[3:04:29.800 --> 3:04:37.320]  a hard copy, a current copy and if you want to, you can go to the site, theinternationalforecaster.com.
[3:04:37.320 --> 3:04:44.480]  Absolutely, theinternationalforecaster.com and my website's infowars.com.
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:46.640]  Bob, always look forward to seeing you.
[3:04:46.640 --> 3:04:49.520]  We'll see you here live again with us, God willing.
[3:04:49.520 --> 3:04:51.880]  Next Friday, Godspeed, my friend.
[3:04:51.880 --> 3:04:54.200]  Thank you and thank you all for listening.
[3:04:54.200 --> 3:04:57.800]  We're going to defend the First Amendment on the Internet, straight ahead, right here
[3:04:57.800 --> 3:05:02.440]  on GCN.
[3:05:02.440 --> 3:05:07.080]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[3:05:07.080 --> 3:05:11.440]  Number 1, New Climate Legislation Could Easily Double or Triple Your Electric Bill.
[3:05:11.440 --> 3:05:16.080]  Number 2, Our New Energy SAR Wants to Control How Much Power Your Electric Company Allows
[3:05:16.080 --> 3:05:17.080]  You to Have.
[3:05:17.080 --> 3:05:18.080]  It's True.
[3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:22.760]  Total Government Control of Electricity in the Name of Smart Grid Technology is Coming.
[3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:27.080]  Number 3, In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:05:27.080 --> 3:05:31.080]  And now, New Socialist Legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:05:31.080 --> 3:05:34.560]  Number 4, Dangerous Weather is Always a Threat to Local Grids.
[3:05:34.560 --> 3:05:38.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[3:05:38.280 --> 3:05:43.080]  Number 5, A Solar Power Generator Provides Powerful Backup Insurance and Peace of Mind.
[3:05:43.080 --> 3:05:46.840]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:05:46.840 --> 3:05:48.200]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[3:05:48.200 --> 3:05:52.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[3:05:52.440 --> 3:05:54.080]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[3:06:02.920 --> 3:06:05.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:06:05.920 --> 3:06:10.280]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[3:06:10.280 --> 3:06:11.280]  do you want?
[3:06:11.280 --> 3:06:13.280]  My answer would be all I can get.
[3:06:13.280 --> 3:06:18.320]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[3:06:18.320 --> 3:06:19.560]  How much do you want?
[3:06:19.560 --> 3:06:20.640]  When do you want it?
[3:06:20.640 --> 3:06:22.600]  Now or after the battle starts.
[3:06:22.600 --> 3:06:23.720]  When will you need it?
[3:06:23.720 --> 3:06:25.840]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:06:25.840 --> 3:06:27.160]  Will there be any food?
[3:06:27.160 --> 3:06:28.640]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:06:28.640 --> 3:06:32.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:06:32.760 --> 3:06:33.920]  and be immunized?
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:37.720]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:06:37.720 --> 3:06:41.160]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:06:41.160 --> 3:06:42.520]  How much will you need?
[3:06:42.520 --> 3:06:43.520]  We don't know.
[3:06:43.520 --> 3:06:44.520]  How much do you want?
[3:06:44.520 --> 3:06:45.520]  All you can get.
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:46.520]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:06:46.520 --> 3:06:49.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:06:49.760 --> 3:06:57.240]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:06:57.240 --> 3:07:03.440]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:07:03.440 --> 3:07:08.240]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high
[3:07:08.240 --> 3:07:13.120]  energy and fibrin health? Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic
[3:07:13.120 --> 3:07:16.720]  waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[3:07:16.720 --> 3:07:21.280]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high
[3:07:21.280 --> 3:07:23.200]  pH environment.
[3:07:23.200 --> 3:07:28.320]  Alchovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[3:07:28.320 --> 3:07:33.200]  Using alchovision pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get
[3:07:33.200 --> 3:07:36.560]  rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[3:07:36.560 --> 3:07:41.160]  Only put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[3:07:41.160 --> 3:07:45.720]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[3:07:45.720 --> 3:07:51.560]  Order your bottle of alchovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alchovision.com.
[3:07:51.560 --> 3:08:07.640]  Or by calling 269-409-1776, 269-409-1776 today.
[3:08:07.640 --> 3:08:12.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:15.560]  You want answers? Well so does he.
[3:08:15.560 --> 3:08:25.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:25.080 --> 3:08:30.400]  John Young is the founder of Cryptone. New York based architect is better known as one
[3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:34.240]  of the next most ardent foes of government secrecy.
[3:08:34.240 --> 3:08:39.040]  William Arkin, Washington Post columnist and NBC News Military Analyst calls Cryptone the
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:41.400]  Google of National Security.
[3:08:41.400 --> 3:08:46.200]  There are high resolution satellite photos of the President Bush's Crawford Ranch, technical
[3:08:46.200 --> 3:08:49.840]  documents detailing how the national security agency spies on computer traffic.
[3:08:49.840 --> 3:08:52.800]  Even the home addresses and telephone numbers of government officials, including former
[3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:56.520]  director of national intelligence John Negroponte.
[3:08:56.520 --> 3:09:01.520]  This is truly an amazing hodge podge of information and fascinating background to a man whose
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:05.840]  single-minded focus is government security, Cryptone.org.
[3:09:05.840 --> 3:09:14.560]  Now, it's all over the Washington Post, AP, PC World, CNET News, Microsoft Relent's Cryptone
[3:09:14.560 --> 3:09:22.240]  Returns, Microsoft Action hits Cryptone website, shut it down, Microsoft backs down over online
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:24.840]  spy guide. This just happened yesterday.
[3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:29.480]  Microsoft drops Cryptone spy document fight, Microsoft brings down whistleblower site after
[3:09:29.480 --> 3:09:39.600]  spy guide leak. Whistleblower website is back online, IT business on and on and on with
[3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:45.080]  Microsoft and how they spy on people without warrants.
[3:09:45.080 --> 3:09:50.160]  This is the progenitor of WikiLeaks. This is a guy involved in helping set up the Electronic
[3:09:50.160 --> 3:09:55.000]  Frontiers Foundation so much an icon in defending the free web.
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:10:00.960]  The front lines of the info war and we need to support Cryptone.org. Good to have you
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:03.400]  on with us, John Young. Thank you for coming on.
[3:10:03.400 --> 3:10:05.080]  It's a pleasure, Alex.
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:09.520]  You know you're over the target when you're getting the flak. You have certainly gotten
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:13.720]  the dragon to come out of his nest and give it a bunch of attention it didn't want. They
[3:10:13.720 --> 3:10:15.040]  miscalculated.
[3:10:15.040 --> 3:10:20.320]  Break down your site, the history, the fights you've been through, the raids, all of it,
[3:10:20.320 --> 3:10:25.360]  this current attack and now this big defeat. You have the floor.
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:31.160]  We set up the site in 1996 to publish documents that the government doesn't want published.
[3:10:31.160 --> 3:10:35.960]  That's its only purpose. And so we sit and wait for the documents to show up and people
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:40.760]  send the stuff and have been sending us stuff. We now got about 54,000 files on the site
[3:10:40.760 --> 3:10:48.800]  that have some controversial, some not so much, but they're all based on reducing the
[3:10:48.800 --> 3:10:53.320]  amount of secrecy by government and through government the secrecy of corporations who
[3:10:53.320 --> 3:10:57.800]  do work with government. And so that brings us to the Microsoft case. It's happened more
[3:10:57.800 --> 3:11:02.040]  recently. One of the things that's happened since 9-1-1 is that spying on Americans has
[3:11:02.040 --> 3:11:08.600]  become very big business. And corporations now are doing it covertly, Microsoft among
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:13.920]  them, but all the giant people online are now assisting government to spy on citizens
[3:11:13.920 --> 3:11:20.760]  through their customer data. Someone, an anonymous person, gave us what we call the
[3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:27.360]  Microsoft's by-guide. It's actually a global criminal assistance guide to law enforcement
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:34.320]  to help law enforcement to write subpoenas for Microsoft's data on its customers. And
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:39.880]  it holds the law enforcement people's hands. It may not be technically adept to tell them
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:44.400]  what to ask for and also how to explain what they're getting from Microsoft about their
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:48.760]  customers. And so we published that. We thought that was a good document for the public to
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:57.760]  see. And so a day or two later, we got a notice from our provider, Network Solutions, another
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:03.080]  giant firm who also spies on its customers saying that Microsoft had filed a notice under
[3:12:03.080 --> 3:12:10.120]  DMCA alleging copyright infringement of this document. We sent back and said this document
[3:12:10.120 --> 3:12:14.280]  needs to be seen by the public. Copyright should not be used to hide this document. It's nothing
[3:12:14.280 --> 3:12:18.720]  about copyright. The copyright is being used to hide information about what's being done
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:25.680]  to Microsoft's customers. So Network Solutions says, well, then file a counter claim. So
[3:12:25.680 --> 3:12:29.680]  we did. And they immediately shut our site. As soon as they got the claim, they shut it
[3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:34.920]  down, locked the domain where we couldn't transfer it anywhere else. And that's the
[3:12:34.920 --> 3:12:38.560]  first time that's ever happened. But it was done through this law called the Digital
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:45.960]  Millennium Copyright Act, which gives corporations the right to shut down sites just by filing
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:51.760]  a notice. And there's no appeal to it. So we want to test that. We hope that Microsoft
[3:12:51.760 --> 3:12:56.800]  wouldn't take us to court. They've since backed off because other people on the Internet
[3:12:56.800 --> 3:13:01.920]  picked it up, started publishing the same document, including a number of news organizations.
[3:13:01.920 --> 3:13:08.440]  And so very quickly, the document became very well known throughout the U.S. and throughout
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:14.760]  the world. Even though we were down, it was already out. And since then, yesterday, Microsoft
[3:13:14.760 --> 3:13:19.320]  sent a notice to Network Solutions saying, we're lifting our complaint. Please restore
[3:13:19.320 --> 3:13:21.600]  the site. And that's what happened.
[3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:28.120]  Which shows that's a fraudulent complaint. You now have damageable action. Yeah, in fact,
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:33.280]  a prison plant had made the first point that I've seen about it, saying that Network Solutions
[3:13:33.280 --> 3:13:38.880]  actually used authority as a domain manager for thousands of sites to actually lock our
[3:13:38.880 --> 3:13:45.280]  domain down. Typically, that role is separate from offering ISP services. And so they used
[3:13:45.280 --> 3:13:49.720]  two powers. One is they shut down our site, which is what any ISP can do. But they also
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:54.600]  then use their domain management power to lock the name, the domain name, where I couldn't
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:13:58.120]  transfer it to another site. I'd already set up an anticipation of this happening.
[3:13:58.120 --> 3:14:01.440]  Which is outside of that digital millennium law.
[3:14:01.440 --> 3:14:05.120]  Well, that's what's happened is that corporations now are abusing this law because all they
[3:14:05.120 --> 3:14:09.240]  need to do is send an email to an ISP to get action. They don't need to go to court. They
[3:14:09.240 --> 3:14:13.480]  don't need to go to expensive lawyers. They just do it. It happens. That's the way the
[3:14:13.480 --> 3:14:17.840]  thing has been set up, but it's being abused now. They're actually claiming copyright
[3:14:17.840 --> 3:14:24.000]  open stuff that has no right to be copyrighted. So it's a sham now, and it needs to be changed.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:29.720]  Well, let's expand on that. What? Four or five months ago, this secret UN treaty on copyright
[3:14:29.720 --> 3:14:34.000]  came out. It's basically an expansion of this. That's what Italy's saying. You've got to
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:39.400]  have a license to post video. They want you to have a license to be a blogger. We've got
[3:14:39.400 --> 3:14:44.960]  Australia saying they want Chinese style net censorship. Anyone complains, then your website's
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:49.640]  put on a list that's banned in Australia. We have Time Magazine Newsweek. The New York
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:14:56.240]  Times calling for a kindler, gentler gatekeeper internet. We have cybersecurity openly taking
[3:14:56.240 --> 3:15:02.240]  over the entire grid, the physical transfer lines of the web. I mean, they're definitely
[3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:08.760]  coming against the web right now. That's right. Very much so. It's a worldwide initiative.
[3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:11.960]  And one of the things that we find interesting is not just government. It is these commercial
[3:15:11.960 --> 3:15:17.080]  firms who also are working with government to control the internet and shut down freedom
[3:15:17.080 --> 3:15:20.560]  of speech, shut down the more unruly side of the internet.
[3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:23.640]  Well, that's internet, too. That's what they've been saying for seven years. Internet, two
[3:15:23.640 --> 3:15:28.920]  meetings that are public. We have the transcripts is that corporations in this new world order,
[3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:34.400]  they're given the government power. That's right. That's right. And so it's not just
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:42.240]  government. It's these firms who also want to dominate the internet. And so this guy
[3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:45.480]  that we published, we've now published about 36 of these, what we call spying guys. These
[3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:52.800]  are arrangements that these corporations have with ISPs to hand over data on customers
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:57.320]  without the customers knowing it's being done. Some of the companies make it public, but
[3:15:57.320 --> 3:16:01.080]  others hide it, like Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, the whole system still hide it because they
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:05.520]  don't want the customers to know they're doing this. It's also a very lucrative business.
[3:16:05.520 --> 3:16:10.520]  And so the internet is a gigantic spying machine right now. And it's very lucrative business
[3:16:10.520 --> 3:16:15.440]  to spy on it. We put up a site listing all the companies who sell spying services to
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:19.880]  government and to corporations. There are these subcontractors who write these programs
[3:16:19.880 --> 3:16:25.640]  to do the spying and the program data analysis. So Microsoft is just at the top of the heap.
[3:16:25.640 --> 3:16:30.200]  There's a whole range of smaller companies providing the service around the world.
[3:16:30.200 --> 3:16:34.640]  Well, I mean, Bill Gates two weeks ago said China's doing a great thing with its censorship
[3:16:34.640 --> 3:16:39.120]  and he doesn't see a problem with it. Microsoft, according to my research, helped build the
[3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:46.120]  architecture of censorship for China. Absolutely. That's right. That's what they're doing. Well,
[3:16:46.120 --> 3:16:53.800]  look at our... Well, look at our government. When it has its druthers in a third world
[3:16:53.800 --> 3:16:59.840]  country or first world, they set up a dictatorship. And they've made deals with big corporations
[3:16:59.840 --> 3:17:06.400]  as a cartel to slice it up and control it. And then the revolving door in cybersecurity
[3:17:06.400 --> 3:17:11.200]  and homeland security, the same in the other nations, rotates through these private corporations.
[3:17:11.200 --> 3:17:16.080]  The government gives them giant contracts to spy and steal data. I mean, it goes back
[3:17:16.080 --> 3:17:22.560]  to the 1996 Telecommunications Act where they paid the phone companies to put in the spying
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:26.840]  rooms and all the facilities. And for my research, that's all the cybersecurity act
[3:17:26.840 --> 3:17:37.120]  is, is putting in the next wave of these snooping grids over the entire Internet. That's correct.
[3:17:37.120 --> 3:17:41.440]  So where do you go from here? Because we need to punish Microsoft. We need to point out
[3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:48.880]  the tyranny that's being engaged in here. Well, I'll just say is that I'm one of a number
[3:17:48.880 --> 3:17:53.840]  of people who are working on this. The Electronic Freedom Frontier Foundation is one of the people
[3:17:53.840 --> 3:18:00.200]  taking the lead on filing suit against these corporations. Whenever they attack an individual,
[3:18:00.200 --> 3:18:04.960]  they go to court and win most of their cases because these folks don't want to be challenged
[3:18:04.960 --> 3:18:09.960]  in court. They want to do this covertly without going to court. And so EFF is doing it, but
[3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:14.560]  a number of others are doing it as well. As you mentioned, I think WikiLeaks, who's also
[3:18:14.560 --> 3:18:19.880]  publishing information that is being hidden from the public, Iceland is about to set up
[3:18:19.880 --> 3:18:24.240]  a regime we hope where freedom of information will finally come into its own and people
[3:18:24.240 --> 3:18:27.880]  will be able to publish more through Iceland. They cannot publish even in Freedom Loving
[3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:33.520]  America for this very reason. Because right now the Internet is becoming a major manipulation
[3:18:33.520 --> 3:18:38.240]  device. People worldwide and the companies that are running it, you know, the government
[3:18:38.240 --> 3:18:42.440]  doesn't run the Internet. These companies do. And they're competing in bed with the
[3:18:42.440 --> 3:18:45.800]  government on this. And because it's a very lucrative business to have.
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:52.680]  Well, I mean, let's go back to 2002, a USA Today article. I think the headline was scoff
[3:18:52.680 --> 3:18:58.440]  laws get caught ordering pizza. Guys, pull that up for me. And in it, it talks about
[3:18:58.440 --> 3:19:05.600]  how the big pizza companies, the big three get 25% of fines and fees. And when you call
[3:19:05.600 --> 3:19:09.200]  to order a pizza, they know it's your real name and real address. And so they run it
[3:19:09.200 --> 3:19:14.800]  through a database of warrants. And instead of a pizza, you get a SWAT team. I don't think
[3:19:14.800 --> 3:19:20.920]  the public realizes how far along this is nor nor do they understand that this fascination
[3:19:20.920 --> 3:19:27.840]  with the Internet is deliberate and that there's never been such an easy way to spy on the
[3:19:27.840 --> 3:19:32.080]  public as the Internet. Now, the phone couldn't do it. TV couldn't do it. Telephone couldn't
[3:19:32.080 --> 3:19:38.040]  do it. Nothing is as pervasive because the excitement that people find in going to the
[3:19:38.040 --> 3:19:42.800]  Internet, Googling, seeming like all this stuff is free. But in fact, it's what's happening
[3:19:42.800 --> 3:19:46.680]  in the background that they don't know about. And so that's the intent of the Internet is
[3:19:46.680 --> 3:19:51.000]  to make it a magical device for people to come to it. Don't even stop to think about
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:55.680]  what's happening in the background. So the globalists get a database and a psychological
[3:19:55.680 --> 3:20:01.280]  algorithm on each individual in the country and can gauge things with predictive programs.
[3:20:01.280 --> 3:20:06.240]  We'll talk about it when we come back. This is Alex Jones. And I want to tell you about
[3:20:06.240 --> 3:20:11.400]  the coloblue atmospheric water generator that produces pure drinking water right from the

[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:19.440]  the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing
[3:22:19.440 --> 3:22:24.480]  off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've
[3:22:24.480 --> 3:22:29.440]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[3:22:29.440 --> 3:22:35.680]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For
[3:22:35.680 --> 3:22:41.040]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[3:22:41.040 --> 3:22:46.240]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[3:22:46.240 --> 3:22:50.280]  Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying,
[3:22:50.280 --> 3:22:55.080]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:23:02.160]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:16.360]  The establishment intended to get you addicted to the Internet, we've always pointed that
[3:24:16.360 --> 3:24:22.120]  out, and then used it as the worldwide wiretap. The NSA 30 years ago called it as they developed
[3:24:22.120 --> 3:24:29.560]  the world-wide wiretap, but we can use it against them if people are aware of this.
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:32.960]  The fact is they're accelerating their program of control now because they're really getting
[3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:35.760]  concerned. Do you agree with that statement, John Young?
[3:24:35.760 --> 3:24:40.160]  I do. Now, you got into something very deep, which
[3:24:40.160 --> 3:24:45.320]  they admit, but isn't popularly known, that, in fact, I have an article, cell phones show
[3:24:45.320 --> 3:24:51.440]  human movement predictable 93% of the time. Just off tracking our cell phones in England
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:59.640]  and the U.S. where we move, they learn what we do as an individual. This is literally what
[3:24:59.640 --> 3:25:03.760]  Isaac Asimov wrote about in his Foundation series, where a mathematician comes up with
[3:25:03.760 --> 3:25:09.840]  computers that can predict mass movements of people 99% of the time.
[3:25:09.840 --> 3:25:12.960]  Correct. Your comments, sir?
[3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:18.440]  Well, for example, in the case of Google, everything you search for becomes part of
[3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:22.200]  the data, and they can track you just like the cell phone is tracked. They can tell
[3:25:22.200 --> 3:25:27.400]  where you're going, what your pace are, what your health interest is, what your sex interest
[3:25:27.400 --> 3:25:33.280]  is, what your business interest is, what were you banked. So just using Google alone, and
[3:25:33.280 --> 3:25:37.800]  there are dozens of these sites like that that are gathering this data, and so that
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:46.400]  the cell phone attracts you to, you know, physically, and the internet tracks you digitally.
[3:25:46.400 --> 3:25:51.600]  If you use any of the internet-related services, like the telephone and others that are coming
[3:25:51.600 --> 3:25:55.840]  online are very popular. They even use that to also track your telephone calls until
[3:25:55.840 --> 3:26:02.240]  you're calling. And by the way, the government has admitted that they spy on these social
[3:26:02.240 --> 3:26:08.560]  media sites like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. So they've already admitted that. What they
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:13.080]  won't tell us is, well, what are they doing with the data? Now, the key to all this is
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:17.160]  they always justify this, is we're doing this to fight the criminals and the terrorists.
[3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:21.320]  The thing is they overreach. They use that as just an opening gambit, and they expand
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:27.040]  it to watch people who are not criminals or are not terrorists. And so that's what we
[3:26:27.040 --> 3:26:31.080]  have to make a distinction is that they always argue that we're doing this to protect the
[3:26:31.080 --> 3:26:35.440]  public. The thing is that they don't need to spy on us this much to protect the public.
[3:26:35.440 --> 3:26:36.440]  They overreach.
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:42.920]  Well, more than that, we got the Homeland Security documents, the whole Homeland Security
[3:26:42.920 --> 3:26:47.280]  system set up for the American people. They admit that internally. Governor Ridge admitted
[3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:53.880]  the terror alerts were fake for political gain. This whole thing is aimed at the people.
[3:26:53.880 --> 3:26:59.880]  Yes. As you, as you well know from the years you've been working with this, it's the biggest
[3:26:59.880 --> 3:27:04.600]  threat to government or their own citizens in all countries. They never say that, but
[3:27:04.600 --> 3:27:13.560]  that's the biggest threat. And so that is the reason that they hide behind the term national
[3:27:13.560 --> 3:27:18.360]  security. That's just a device to get more, more money to actually protect government
[3:27:18.360 --> 3:27:24.720]  from its own citizens. I know this is a bitter pill to swallow, but I think we had to get
[3:27:24.720 --> 3:27:29.920]  serious about how this actually works and not buy into some of the, all the spin that's
[3:27:29.920 --> 3:27:32.640]  put out about external enemies.
[3:27:32.640 --> 3:27:40.000]  Well, we know that the NSA grid, the government in every case has to run drills of the exact
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:44.400]  attack they're going to run when they stage terror so that other people in government
[3:27:44.400 --> 3:27:49.560]  who aren't part of the inside job don't bust their operation. And in every case, civil
[3:27:49.560 --> 3:27:55.240]  admins, everybody else hears Al Qaeda working for the CIA on the day of 9 11 and she's gagged.
[3:27:55.240 --> 3:27:59.880]  So in every case where they know the underwear bombers getting on the plane, they're going
[3:27:59.880 --> 3:28:04.880]  to stop him. The CIA tells the State Department, help him get on the plane.
[3:28:04.880 --> 3:28:05.880]  Yep.
[3:28:05.880 --> 3:28:15.320]  The other aspect of it that I find intriguing is one of the things we have to do with this
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:20.720]  being stigmatized, called a conspiracy nut. They use all these meaning terms to anyone
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:25.000]  who broke too much. You just got to look past that. Those are just standard techniques
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:30.800]  to suppress your views. You've got to keep digging, keep looking, stop trusting authority
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:36.600]  and keep digging on your own. That's what we advocate. We run our site as a library,
[3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:42.840]  not as a blog, not as elite site. It's actually a library of information. 90% of our documents
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:46.560]  are not controversial, but they're highly informative about how government works. And
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:51.200]  you just got to do a lot of education work and not be seduced by headline stuff.
[3:28:51.200 --> 3:28:55.600]  Yeah. Cryptom.org is so great because you're just reading the documents and you make your
[3:28:55.600 --> 3:29:02.040]  own decision about them. That's right. That's the key. Make your own decision. Like operation.
[3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:06.840]  That is scary to people and authority. Like operation Northwoods. When we come back in
[3:29:06.840 --> 3:29:10.080]  the final segment we've got with you, we want to talk about how we support Cryptom.org.
[3:29:10.080 --> 3:29:15.000]  But also, I mean, I remember Google four years ago saying they're going to use cameras and
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:20.520]  microphones to watch you in your house with computers, a recording keyword. Now we learn
[3:29:20.520 --> 3:29:27.480]  all over the country, not just in Philadelphia, but they have school people going on PBS and
[3:29:27.480 --> 3:29:34.440]  just calmly showing the news how they watch kids in the school, out of the school. So
[3:29:34.440 --> 3:29:39.920]  like we're cattle, they're just domesticating us, introducing this to everyone. Cryptom.org
[3:29:39.920 --> 3:29:44.800]  is the key website. Check it out. Support it. We see Cryptom. We see WikiLeaks. We see
[3:29:44.800 --> 3:29:50.160]  infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, all being censored all over the world in different ways.
[3:29:50.160 --> 3:29:53.840]  Why is that? We'll be back.
[3:29:53.840 --> 3:30:02.560]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:02.560 --> 3:30:06.480]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[3:30:06.480 --> 3:30:10.360]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air. No, this isn't science
[3:30:10.360 --> 3:30:14.360]  fiction. It's very real. I know because I use one every day in my own home and it's available
[3:30:14.360 --> 3:30:18.680]  right now to you. Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Akola Blue,
[3:30:18.680 --> 3:30:22.600]  you'll know what's in your cup. Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants. Get

[3:31:05.120 --> 3:31:09.640]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[3:31:09.640 --> 3:31:15.160]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[3:31:15.160 --> 3:31:19.920]  from underneath the Americans at home. They've turned a tremendous influence on our President
[3:31:19.920 --> 3:31:24.920]  and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[3:31:24.920 --> 3:31:30.680]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[3:31:30.680 --> 3:31:36.240]  of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[3:31:36.240 --> 3:31:40.880]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and our arsonists, they're
[3:31:40.880 --> 3:31:45.040]  asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:31:45.040 --> 3:31:50.880]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:31:50.880 --> 3:31:57.160]  of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're

[3:33:27.080 --> 3:33:33.400]  You bet supporters thought I was lying that he was in USA today. But we don't lie here.
[3:33:33.400 --> 3:33:44.720]  Sometimes we get stuff wrong. Okay. Let's go back to John Young of Crypto.org. I was
[3:33:44.720 --> 3:33:48.600]  talking about spy cams there and the fact that they're just, yes, we're watching your
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:53.960]  kids at home through the cameras. What's the big deal? And now if we think your husband's
[3:33:53.960 --> 3:33:57.520]  history means he might hit you. Now if he's ever even hit you, you're going to wear ankle
[3:33:57.520 --> 3:34:02.080]  bracelets. It's all this predictive pre-crime. And they're putting brain scanners in airports
[3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:07.320]  saying it can tell if you're angry. A bunch of quackery to sell tyranny. Worse than the
[3:34:07.320 --> 3:34:11.840]  lie detector that's been discredited. Comments on that, sir?
[3:34:11.840 --> 3:34:18.080]  Well, I think that one of the things that's hard to grasp is how much of high technology
[3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:25.000]  is being used against the public interest. Even as it's spun out, being on for our protection
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:30.600]  and for our pleasure, how much of it is being used to track us, for example. Most visual
[3:34:30.600 --> 3:34:36.960]  cameras can be intercepted. Even though they're being run by your computer, they emit electromagnetic
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:42.200]  magnetic waves that can be intercepted by someone in the next room or across the street.
[3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:46.200]  And so one of the devil's things about these wonderful inventions of high technology is
[3:34:46.200 --> 3:34:53.680]  that they all leak information about you to someone who has the right equipment.
[3:34:53.680 --> 3:34:57.880]  Are you worried, because I've seen a lot of cases of this, the internet's perfect to,
[3:34:57.880 --> 3:35:02.000]  to frame people. Government doesn't have to bury a pipe bomb on your back 40 like they
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:08.360]  do in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. Now they just claim you visited some illegal porn sites
[3:35:08.360 --> 3:35:13.400]  or they claim you were investigating how to build bombs. I've seen a lot of evidence
[3:35:13.400 --> 3:35:18.520]  of them framing people. That's correct. They can make a compelling
[3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:25.440]  case and we actually read court transcripts of testimony of the prosecutions that convert
[3:35:25.440 --> 3:35:31.400]  witnesses and watch them fudge the truth about what they're getting by electronic means,
[3:35:31.400 --> 3:35:36.040]  but they put on very impressive shows. In fact, some of the best people that are putting
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:40.840]  on these shows are themselves, not technologists, who don't understand the technology, but they
[3:35:40.840 --> 3:35:46.880]  know what jurors like to hear. So they, these are actually people who, who blow smoke at
[3:35:46.880 --> 3:35:51.280]  that jury because we've seen testimony by the actual technicians who pretty admit
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:58.440]  how many mistakes they make. But the FBI never admits to making mistakes.
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:04.000]  And they went over 90% of their cases. Well, the good news here is Microsoft backed up,
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:08.200]  this gave them a big black eye. Why did they think that they could shut you down and get
[3:36:08.200 --> 3:36:13.160]  away with it? There's a good question. I'm going to have
[3:36:13.160 --> 3:36:16.800]  to work on that one, Alex, because we did not expect it to happen and we're going to
[3:36:16.800 --> 3:36:21.000]  try to find out how to take advantage of that unexpected. They may have done it just for
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:26.280]  PR purposes in order to not have to go to court and explain how more extensive it is than
[3:36:26.280 --> 3:36:30.160]  just our one little case. We happen to know they sent out thousands of these notices
[3:36:30.160 --> 3:36:34.760]  per week like we got and get away with it. And they never had to defend it in court.
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:39.160]  They just blocked people into obeying. So I think they thought this bluff would work
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:44.640]  and we decided to pass that and let them to take us to court. We was hoping to go to court.
[3:36:44.640 --> 3:36:47.520]  Yeah, we've, we've had some of these and I don't usually make a big deal out of it.
[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:55.080]  I just file in federal court against it. We had our YouTube channel taken down and I just
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:37:00.880]  went and did the federal filing and then it went back up because it is a bluff. It is
[3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:05.920]  a fraud. I mean, we're allowed to play a one minute clip of Michael Reagan saying murder
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:10.440]  9-11 truthers. I will give you weapons. I will give you bullets. I will give you money.
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:15.120]  Kill Mark Dice. We're allowed to play a clip of him and say, look at this criminal saying
[3:37:15.120 --> 3:37:20.520]  murder us. And that's fair use and that's the end of it.
[3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:31.080]  Yep. And so again, the best of power of, of having a platform to speak as a business and
[3:37:31.080 --> 3:37:35.680]  impressive sounding business that you could just bluff people and they threaten people
[3:37:35.680 --> 3:37:41.680]  with lawsuits, but they, since it's so expensive, they sell them and follow through.
[3:37:41.680 --> 3:37:46.440]  Absolutely. Well, I tell you, sir, we just commend the work you've done in the three,
[3:37:46.440 --> 3:37:52.080]  four minutes we've got left with you. Any other key points that you want to get across
[3:37:52.080 --> 3:37:55.800]  to the audience? And well, I have one more question before we plug krypton.org. I have
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:38:01.920]  people support it. So you agree with me. I mean, I mean, obviously you're doing the research
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:06.200]  so you already know the facts. I mean, they're openly floating the idea of shutting down
[3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:11.120]  freedom on the web and having a few thousand websites you can visit under internet to the
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:19.400]  cyber security act that passed the house says that ISPs down to a hundred service customers,
[3:38:19.400 --> 3:38:23.640]  tiny ISPs will take all the orders from the feds and install their hardware and software
[3:38:23.640 --> 3:38:29.160]  that they're going to recruit the youth and the college students into this new grand army.
[3:38:29.160 --> 3:38:32.840]  It's like a new drug war they're launching or something to court defend the internet.
[3:38:32.840 --> 3:38:37.380]  CNN runs fear pieces about how the internet's going to be attacked. Clearly the preparatory
[3:38:37.380 --> 3:38:43.640]  phase for them launching a false flag. What's your take on that? Well, it's coming in. And
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:48.680]  at the risk of being my favorite term, they conspiracy nut. I think you, that you cannot
[3:38:48.680 --> 3:38:53.560]  be paranoid enough about what the government is doing. And they always make fun of it to
[3:38:53.560 --> 3:38:58.520]  try to delete it. But I say that we're not nearly suspicious enough. I don't think that
[3:38:58.520 --> 3:39:03.200]  the underwear bomber was as innocent as it sounds. And I think that more that will come
[3:39:03.200 --> 3:39:07.920]  out. I think there are false flag operations going on. And if you watch how these agencies
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:12.080]  and governments work around the world over the last thousand years, these are not unusual
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:20.560]  or your proper operations. They actually provoked incidents in order to justify increase of
[3:39:20.560 --> 3:39:24.680]  their own authority. You're a fellow Texan. I just learned we're proud. Another great
[3:39:24.680 --> 3:39:30.040]  Texans out there. Well, I'm missing a lot. We're still down there, but I'm not grew up
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:35.680]  in Odessa. How much of your time do you spend on this versus architecture? It's about 50
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:40.040]  50, depending on what's going on a little slow in the field right now. And so it varies,
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:44.280]  but I've been doing this kind of work ever since I got out of college. What got you into
[3:39:44.280 --> 3:39:50.040]  this? Well, I started doing this, what we call public service work right after college
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:54.640]  as a way to supplement professional work, which we saw was going to be very narrow and
[3:39:54.640 --> 3:40:01.160]  very tailored toward our customers. And so we decided to continue doing public service
[3:40:01.160 --> 3:40:06.960]  work on our own, unpaid and so we're still doing it. And that was, that's now some 40
[3:40:06.960 --> 3:40:11.880]  years later. So we've been doing a long time long before Krypton came along. How do we
[3:40:11.880 --> 3:40:17.120]  support krypton.org? Well, one is read it, use it as a resource. That's what it's there
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:24.120]  for. And we happen to offer some DVDs of the collection, but it's strictly, if you want
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:28.200]  it for your own, it's wide open side. Everything that's on the DVD is on the side. And so
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:36.200]  it's no access charges. And so we get some money through the DVDs, but basically it's
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:40.600]  paid for by our architectural firm. But it's good to have a hard copy. So everybody should
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:46.920]  buy these DVDs. I know a lot of people are mirroring and copying and posting doppelgangers
[3:40:46.920 --> 3:40:52.280]  of your site everywhere. And I think this has been a crushing defeat for Microsoft, though.
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:57.400]  I think this is it's safe to say, do you agree this is blown up in their face? Yeah, I don't
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:03.320]  think they expected this. In fact, they said that they did not expect it to happen. That
[3:41:03.320 --> 3:41:07.920]  is, they didn't expect the big backlash. That's right. All right. Well, John Young, we really
[3:41:07.920 --> 3:41:12.320]  appreciate you spending time with us from krypton.org. And we'll talk to you again and
[3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:16.760]  thank you for defending freedom. Thank you, Alex. It's always a pleasure. All right.
[3:41:16.760 --> 3:41:22.760]  Take care. There he goes. Oh, man. All in a day's work here is we fight tyranny on every
[3:41:22.760 --> 3:41:30.120]  front. All right. I want to go over some important news here. Look, I don't want to attack Glenn
[3:41:30.120 --> 3:41:38.920]  Beck. I don't want to be in a fight with Claire channel, but I have my first amendment and
[3:41:38.920 --> 3:41:47.640]  Glenn Beck is constantly attacking us and is duplicitous. Okay. And I'm sick of double
[3:41:47.640 --> 3:42:00.720]  talkers. Now, Al Gore, Barack Obama are discredited punks. And we're still attacking them and
[3:42:00.720 --> 3:42:06.920]  exposing them as new world order fronts yesterday with the whole birther thing. The whole first
[3:42:06.920 --> 3:42:13.280]  hour attacking Obama and his healthcare takeover and his cyber security and his, his environment
[3:42:13.280 --> 3:42:18.360]  takeover. So people say, why don't you spend more time on Barack Obama? We do. My last
[3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:25.080]  two films fall the republic and Obama deception exposing him and who runs him. But Glenn Beck
[3:42:25.080 --> 3:42:31.560]  is placed at a key juncture to when Ron Paul's about to win. He comes out and attack him
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:36.640]  when other candidates that are pro liberty. He comes out. He runs these operations and
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:42.080]  I've seen him say, militias are bad. I've seen him say, we need to use the army against Ron
[3:42:42.080 --> 3:42:45.600]  Paul supporters. I've seen him say the banker bailout is good. And then say you didn't say
[3:42:45.600 --> 3:42:54.120]  that till he got called on it. It's the line. They intend to keep the income tax and then
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:42:58.480]  give you a value added and sales tax on top of it, but he's pushing that value added and
[3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:04.280]  sales tax. So as the guy, he tears the country with O'Reilly, a guy who believes in global
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:08.000]  warming, Sarah Palin says she believes in it. And I get emails going, no, she does it.
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:15.440]  No, he doesn't. He was in USA today, put it up on screen. USA weekend. They're big weekend
[3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:23.240]  magazine. Who's that on the cover there? Who is that man? And it's a positive article.
[3:43:23.240 --> 3:43:27.640]  In fact, what's the actual headline that doesn't have it? It was something like, you know,
[3:43:27.640 --> 3:43:38.280]  judge a book via his cover. He's a great guy. He's so wonderful. He's wonder bar. We all
[3:43:38.280 --> 3:43:44.680]  live in America. America is wonder bar. I mean, this guy is a joke. And he goes on to
[3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:50.400]  say, I believe in global warming. I've got a greenhouse. I'll do anything for the environment.
[3:43:50.400 --> 3:43:56.240]  But those light bulbs, I don't like how they look. I just, it's such a problem. And so he
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:44:00.840]  gets you emotionally invested in him, saying a lot of the right things. And at key points,
[3:44:00.840 --> 3:44:07.480]  flip flops, and the people are like, can't compute. That's why I got so mad at Deborah
[3:44:07.480 --> 3:44:11.280]  Medina. She comes out, says, well, people have a right to question the government on
[3:44:11.280 --> 3:44:15.960]  9 11 truth. And then she puts out a statement kind of, well, I don't think, you know, anybody
[3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:19.560]  else did it with those Arabs. And I'm like, well, whatever, you know, let her kind of
[3:44:19.560 --> 3:44:24.920]  be flip floppy. Oh, come on, Deborah. And I still defend her and do everything I can.
[3:44:24.920 --> 3:44:30.680]  And then Mark Davis and Dallas. And that's a big show. It fills in for rush limbaugh.
[3:44:30.680 --> 3:44:36.880]  These people are an evil cult of dangerous cult of scum and despicable. She's like, absolutely.
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:44.720]  I agree with you. I get mad at that when I invested somebody and believe in them. And
[3:44:44.720 --> 3:44:50.880]  then I can't then take who I am in my integrity, especially when it's clear cut in front of
[3:44:50.880 --> 3:44:54.280]  me. We all make mistakes. We're not thinking. And then we're four days in. She never apologized
[3:44:54.280 --> 3:45:01.280]  for it. Now, I guess we'll go the lesser of two evils. We're out here and I've seen countless
[3:45:01.280 --> 3:45:04.960]  emails from the Medina campaign from their people to my listeners going that they send
[3:45:04.960 --> 3:45:09.600]  her part of the transcript of what she said on Davis. Don't leave you the top to make.
[3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:15.280]  And that's deceptive. And they say, we're not attacking 9 11 truth. Yes, you did see
[3:45:15.280 --> 3:45:19.440]  that. That's even worse. But then I kind of get into the dirtiness and I go, I guess
[3:45:19.440 --> 3:45:25.080]  she's better than Perry or Hutchinson. It's all right. I, I'm just not going to vote.
[3:45:25.080 --> 3:45:34.040]  I was planning to go vote on election day. I just, it was like with the 2004 election.
[3:45:34.040 --> 3:45:38.840]  I went and voted, but not for president. I mean, Kerry Bush, I knew the outcome was already
[3:45:38.840 --> 3:45:44.040]  set. I didn't vote. If memory serves with McCain and Obama, because I knew it was already
[3:45:44.040 --> 3:45:56.480]  set. We have 8% turnout for county and city on a national average. It's 8.2. And we have
[3:45:56.480 --> 3:46:00.080]  what is it? Almost 50%. It was even higher in the last election for the president, this
[3:46:00.080 --> 3:46:09.640]  big pageant when the real powers local. And so I don't think I can make myself go get
[3:46:09.640 --> 3:46:14.520]  even vote. I just, I, I, for either of the three, you know, that's my personal, I get
[3:46:14.520 --> 3:46:22.120]  my vote. Don't I? I'm allowed to have my vote or maybe not to that 1% out there. The few
[3:46:22.120 --> 3:46:27.400]  emails I've gotten saying, you know, you just need to roll over to what she did four days
[3:46:27.400 --> 3:46:36.240]  later, nothing, but duplicitous emails from their people to my listeners. They send us
[3:46:36.240 --> 3:46:42.840]  sending them part of what she said on the show and saying it's not true or, um, it's
[3:46:42.840 --> 3:46:48.400]  just Glenn Beck, any of these people, I just can't handle it anymore. You know, Israel
[3:46:48.400 --> 3:46:53.400]  did target Jim traffic. Can't they did put him in prison. They did set him up. So I had
[3:46:53.400 --> 3:46:58.160]  him on and we kept going back to Israel. You know, that's something I've tried to be more
[3:46:58.160 --> 3:47:02.640]  mainstream and just cover the bigger issues. But when Israel needs to be criticized on
[3:47:02.640 --> 3:47:08.720]  organs or wars or manipulating our politics, I'm doing that. I mean, have you noticed?
[3:47:08.720 --> 3:47:13.000]  We're just trying to tell the truth here. That's all I've got is the truth. Now, let
[3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:20.640]  me get into this big headline here. I just had my Glenn Beck article here in front of
[3:47:20.640 --> 3:47:26.620]  me. Here it is. And it's up on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers. We got this out for
[3:47:26.620 --> 3:47:31.240]  everybody on Monday, our audience. And I got a lot of hate emails saying you're lying.
[3:47:31.240 --> 3:47:37.240]  It's not in the USA today. I mean, you talk about delusional. It's delusional because
[3:47:37.240 --> 3:47:40.560]  people invest in Beck and they don't want to admit they've been conned or that they've
[3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:47.360]  been wronged. Beck's failure to retract global warming advocacy provokes online firestorm.
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:51.920]  This is all over world net daily, all over newsmax everywhere. More conservatives are
[3:47:51.920 --> 3:47:57.120]  waking up to the fact that Beck was a show for the bankers and the elite. And it's not
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:48:02.400]  just that he says global warming is real. He says it isn't real on his TV show and radio
[3:48:02.400 --> 3:48:08.600]  show. And then a week later says it is real. He does it over and over. It's the flip flopping.
[3:48:08.600 --> 3:48:17.240]  It's the lying. Glenn Beck has failed to respond to a firestorm of reaction to his comments.
[3:48:17.240 --> 3:48:20.740]  The word is I've gotten calls. He did say, well, I do think some of it's real. Glenn
[3:48:20.740 --> 3:48:24.760]  Beck has failed to respond to a firestorm of reaction to his comments made February 21st
[3:48:24.760 --> 3:48:27.920]  interview with USA Today weekend magazine. Yeah, they're all emailing him and calling
[3:48:27.920 --> 3:48:32.240]  him and going, say it. So Beck's, you know, he'll just play joke sounds in the background.
[3:48:32.240 --> 3:48:37.120]  I was told Glenn Beck has failed to respond to firestorm of reaction to his comments made
[3:48:37.120 --> 3:48:40.880]  during a February 21st interview with USA Today weekend magazine, which he openly and
[3:48:40.880 --> 3:48:46.600]  completely reversed his position on climate change by revealing that he believed in manmade
[3:48:46.600 --> 3:48:52.680]  global warming. As we reported earlier this week, Beck appeared to stab his conservative
[3:48:52.680 --> 3:48:59.240]  audience in the back when he told USA weekend magazine that manmade climate change was occurring
[3:48:59.240 --> 3:49:05.020]  in an article entitled don't judge Beck by his cover. And again, this isn't stabbing
[3:49:05.020 --> 3:49:09.200]  his right wing audience in the back. We're going past that paradigm. Most of the liberals
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:17.360]  I know know it's a fraud. In the article Beck tells interviewer Dennis McCafferty, you'd
[3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:22.120]  be an idiot not to notice the temperature change. He also says there's a legit case
[3:49:22.120 --> 3:49:26.560]  for global warming has at least in part been caused by mankind writes McCafferty under
[3:49:26.560 --> 3:49:31.440]  the sub headline. He believes in global warming. The blogosphere is on fire with reaction to
[3:49:31.440 --> 3:49:37.200]  McCafferty's USA weekend piece. According to world net daily, Chelsea Shilling, who pointed
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:42.200]  out that the posters on the prominent conservative forum for Republic were furious at back for
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:47.320]  seemingly performing a huge flip flop on the issue. Seems like the rose colored glasses
[3:49:47.320 --> 3:49:53.720]  are beginning to fall off those who used to view Mr. Beck with good approval, wrote one.
[3:49:53.720 --> 3:49:57.920]  But see, maybe I'm not supposed to say he flip flop. Does that be mean? I'm still saying,
[3:49:57.920 --> 3:50:02.320]  Oh, thank you, Beck, for your flip flopping. Flip flopping's not bad. It's good. As long
[3:50:02.320 --> 3:50:06.920]  as someone who says they're a constitutionalist does it. It's bad when Obama does it. What's
[3:50:06.920 --> 3:50:13.600]  good when Beck does it or Deborah Medina seems like the rose colored glasses are beginning
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:18.440]  to fall off those who used to view Mr. Beck with good approval, wrote one. Okay, final
[3:50:18.440 --> 3:50:24.480]  straw for Beck with me added another. When an unflattering quote comes out about someone
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:29.000]  else or anyone, they all say I was misquoted. Everyone does it. The people who were actually
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:33.560]  misquoted take legal action to the retraction. Correction isn't printed. In fact, that's
[3:50:33.560 --> 3:50:38.520]  why newspapers print retractions or corrections. If Beck doesn't sue USA weekend, then it tells
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:47.680]  me his pretensions ring hollow, writes another, and it goes on. This story is key because
[3:50:47.680 --> 3:50:52.840]  people need to know that Glenn Beck is going to support the next banker bailout takeover
[3:50:52.840 --> 3:51:04.080]  in the next year and a half. Mark my words. You have been warned. Let's get ready to rumble.

[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:22.800]  underneath Americans at home. We have turned an endless influence on our president in Congress
[3:52:22.800 --> 3:52:28.200]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[3:52:28.200 --> 3:52:33.440]  citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[3:52:33.440 --> 3:52:39.080]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes, constructing
[3:52:39.080 --> 3:52:43.120]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more
[3:52:43.120 --> 3:52:47.240]  matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like
[3:52:47.240 --> 3:52:53.800]  nobody does care. And right now in Washington D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:54:12.680 --> 3:54:16.440]  I want to finish up with Glenn Beck, but I want to remind you, Nigel Farage, a member
[3:54:16.440 --> 3:54:21.120]  of the European Union Parliament who destroyed the head of the European Union president live
[3:54:21.120 --> 3:54:25.320]  on international television. He joined us in the second hour. Bob Chapman and then Pip
[3:54:25.320 --> 3:54:28.960]  Tom, as you just heard. In the first hour, I broke down a host of key issues, including
[3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:35.120]  the secret UN document for global government that Fox News and AP are covering. Before
[3:54:35.120 --> 3:54:40.520]  we finish up with Beck, because I've been told he had responded. I'm just now reading
[3:54:40.520 --> 3:54:44.520]  Watson's article. He has responded, saying, well, I did say it, but I said a lot of other
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:50.640]  stuff and the guy didn't cover it all. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. We're
[3:54:50.640 --> 3:54:54.040]  discovering this here together as we read it. A few of the sponsors that made today's
[3:54:54.040 --> 3:54:57.960]  radio show possible that are awesome, that I believe in. I think you should support and
[3:54:57.960 --> 3:55:02.000]  check out a colorblue.com. It's an atmospheric water generator. They got a bunch of different
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:05.680]  units. They got units that will serve 500 people or 10 people. The smaller units do
[3:55:05.680 --> 3:55:09.400]  seven gallons a day and ride on up. It looks like a water cooler without a water bottle
[3:55:09.400 --> 3:55:13.680]  on top, grabs water out of the air, puts it through seven filters in their baseline unit.
[3:55:13.680 --> 3:55:18.760]  That's kind of overkill, but they've got some of like 12 filters in it. You can't get cleaner
[3:55:18.760 --> 3:55:25.480]  water. A colorblue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com. It's the only way to get 100% of the fluoride
[3:55:25.480 --> 3:55:35.400]  out of the water, 800-69-1-6043, 800-69-1-6043, or a colorblue.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:55:35.400 --> 3:55:39.960]  So I want to thank MySolarBackup.com, the best little solar unit. Get a bunch of these

[3:56:08.200 --> 3:56:09.200]  usual.
[3:56:09.200 --> 3:56:17.680]  Okay, following this outcry, Beck responded by accusing Mercafity of interviewing four
[3:56:17.680 --> 3:56:25.160]  of the 10 things attributed to him in the article, of inventing four of the 10 things attributed
[3:56:25.160 --> 3:56:29.600]  to him in the article. But since then, Beck made no mention whatsoever of it. We can only
[3:56:29.600 --> 3:56:34.720]  assume his global warming comments wasn't one of them. So I mean, he better soon, he
[3:56:34.720 --> 3:56:41.400]  better do something. No, the guy can't help but constantly deceive. It goes on here. But
[3:56:41.400 --> 3:56:46.880]  the calls I'm getting, and I haven't listened all week, is that he's saying that it was
[3:56:46.880 --> 3:56:50.040]  twisted or something. And then he says it another from what I've heard. Again, I haven't
[3:56:50.040 --> 3:56:57.880]  confirmed this. Well, WorldNet Daily says he hasn't retracted it. So I don't know. Since
[3:56:57.880 --> 3:57:02.240]  Beck changes his tune every time the wind blows, he was for the bailout before he was
[3:57:02.240 --> 3:57:06.240]  against it, we can only assume that the increased suspicion from conservatives over his global
[3:57:06.240 --> 3:57:12.360]  warming comments will force Beck to backpedal and issue some form of retraction. However,
[3:57:12.360 --> 3:57:16.240]  for some, this will only confirm the fact that Beck is a shill and a performing circus
[3:57:16.240 --> 3:57:22.200]  clown who he admits to be, and he also cries on cue. I would just add he does say he's
[3:57:22.200 --> 3:57:23.200]  a circus clown.
[3:57:23.200 --> 3:57:26.840]  While hoodwinking millions of conservatives into supporting policies which represent
[3:57:26.840 --> 3:57:32.240]  the antithesis of true conservatism, like a national sales tax, an idea also embraced
[3:57:32.240 --> 3:57:36.600]  by Nancy Pelosi, while attacking people who espouse real conservative principles without
[3:57:36.600 --> 3:57:40.600]  consistently flip-flopping, like Congressman Ron Paul and his supporters, who he has smeared
[3:57:40.600 --> 3:57:43.840]  as potential terrorist. And we have links to all of that in the article. Every claim
[3:57:43.840 --> 3:57:47.040]  we make, we link to.
[3:57:47.040 --> 3:57:55.760]  Again, the whole point here is it's on record that Sarah Palin believes in global warming.
[3:57:55.760 --> 3:58:01.200]  Notice John McCain who she supports, and people don't believe that. Go look it up for yourself.
[3:58:01.200 --> 3:58:05.880]  I wish Glenn Beck was for real, like Judge Napolitano, who's the same today and tomorrow,
[3:58:05.880 --> 3:58:10.120]  yesterday to day tomorrow. I wish he was like Ron Paul. I wish. I would love to just totally
[3:58:10.120 --> 3:58:17.520]  get behind him, totally supporting. And nobody's perfect, but Beck is a actor and very dangerous.
[3:58:17.520 --> 3:58:24.320]  Great job to the crew. Amazing broadcast week. We're going to have an exclusive with shooter
[3:58:24.320 --> 3:58:30.760]  Jennings and, yes, ladies and gentlemen, Stephen King with spoken word here on the show about
[3:58:30.760 --> 3:58:38.560]  the New World Order on Monday. I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. live. L-I-V-E-E. Great
[3:58:38.560 --> 3:58:55.600]  job. Don't forget the free Apple iPhone apps and not everybody, you know, God bless.
