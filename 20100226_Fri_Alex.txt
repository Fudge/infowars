[00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:09.690]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.292]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:12.833]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:17.036]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:21.078]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.510]  It is Friday, the 26th day of February 2010.
[00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.631]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:41.353]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:43.833]  I'll be back live this Sunday, by the way, just a program note.
[00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.554]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:46.894]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:54.736]  Okay, I want to run through the stacks of incredibly important news.
[00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:57.157]  At least go through the headlines and break them down in more detail.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.566]  Then, coming up, we have Nigel Farage, a member of the European Union Parliament, hailing from England.
[00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:20.099]  He, of course, chewed out Herman Van Rompuy, the traitorous snake who openly admits they're setting up world government through the EU and is sanguinating or sucking the blood out of European nations to fund it.
[00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.695]  The same pernicious group runs the United States.
[00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:28.097]  He is scheduled to be joining us in the next hour.
[00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:33.580]  Then we've got Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, who pops in every Friday with us in the third hour.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.084]  And then John Young of Cryptome.org, shot down without a court order.
[00:01:39.904 --> 00:01:43.085]  By Microsoft, the website gone.
[00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:49.648]  Really, it's a type of predecessor to something like WikiLeaks, also under attack.
[00:01:49.648 --> 00:02:04.773]  For anyone denying that we're dealing with Internet censorship, expanding on a routine increment.
[00:02:04.773 --> 00:02:06.414]  So that is coming up today.
[00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:13.350]  In news, Obama says bipartisan health deal may not be possible.
[00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.091]  And of course, they first said that his health bill was invincible, no one could stop it, now it's in deep trouble.
[00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:24.033]  Now he says again, it's invincible, you will be assimilated, they're going to pass it next week.
[00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.093]  But let's hope and pray that is not the case.
[00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:28.214]  It looks like it may not pass.
[00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:36.436]  Of course, they played possum for a few months because there was massive resistance cresting against it.
[00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:44.907]  And so they played possum until everybody kind of dissipated their energy and then now they're back.
[00:02:44.907 --> 00:02:49.213]  And they're back with the climate bill that already passed the House, what, six months ago.
[00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:50.494]  It's in the U.S.
[00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:50.815]  Senate.
[00:02:53.593 --> 00:02:56.374]  Open world government, open home inspections.
[00:02:56.374 --> 00:03:01.316]  You don't fix what the feds say they want repaired and their new zoning laws.
[00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:03.977]  Arbitrary, gives a blank check of power to the government.
[00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:07.738]  You'll be turned out of your house within five days, the home will be taken.
[00:03:07.738 --> 00:03:09.919]  No judge, no jury, no court.
[00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.800]  35 federal agencies with god-like power.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.200]  Taxes on everything.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.781]  Water, power, light bulbs.
[00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.742]  Just meat.
[00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:23.852]  Unlimited blank check to ravenously take over society.
[00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:32.414]  Everyone had better get Fall of the Republic out to their friends and family and neighbors so they realize what this environmentalism really is.
[00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:44.836]  It's about a bunch of crooks running your life and sucking you dry, deciding who can have a business and who can't.
[00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:44.976]  Now,
[00:03:49.477 --> 00:03:54.579]  Again, everyone needs to get Fall of the Republic.
[00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.482]  It details their entire agenda, the whole thing, in two hours and 25 minutes.
[00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:04.384]  You don't have to buy the DVD at Infowars.com and support us.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.181]  You can go to YouTube.
[00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:10.941]  There's hundreds of versions of it up there.
[00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:17.563]  There's a director's channel, Change Da Channel's the name of the channel, that has it in pretty good quality up there for free.
[00:04:17.563 --> 00:04:23.244]  I suggest you keep hammering that link out to everyone you know.
[00:04:23.244 --> 00:04:31.626]  Because if you think the economy's bad now, under globalization and NAFTA and GATT, this is only the beginning.
[00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:34.147]  And Reid says he's bullish on Climate Bill.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.242]  He says they can ram it through in the next few weeks.
[00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:44.950]  They know they're losing approval rating numbers every day, and so they want their entire agenda through.
[00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.253]  They are a group of revolutionary crooks.
[00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:52.197]  Viperous, lecherous vermin.
[00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:55.260]  Enemies of everything good.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.243]  The grandchildren of Joe Stalin.
[00:04:58.243 --> 00:04:58.864]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:04.554]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:05.475]  Number one.
[00:05:05.475 --> 00:05:08.897]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:09.758]  Number two.
[00:05:09.758 --> 00:05:14.641]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:15.381]  It's true.
[00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:20.265]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:21.085]  Number three.
[00:05:21.085 --> 00:05:24.667]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:28.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.371]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.133]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:35.816]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:36.597]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.597 --> 00:05:40.761]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:45.525]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:49.972]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.972 --> 00:05:51.775]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.775 --> 00:05:54.019]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:56.363]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:01.923 --> 00:06:05.965]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:09.187]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.187 --> 00:06:13.989]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:17.851]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:20.372]  And they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:25.935]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:28.837]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:06:28.837 --> 00:06:35.680]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.042]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.042 --> 00:06:39.622]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.622 --> 00:06:42.084]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.084 --> 00:06:44.205]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:45.746]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[00:06:46.446 --> 00:06:49.352]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.352 --> 00:06:58.468]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:00.478 --> 00:07:01.299]  Hi, everyone.
[00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:02.360]  Andy Anderson here.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.766]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:12.553]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[00:07:12.553 --> 00:07:16.918]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[00:07:16.918 --> 00:07:18.600]  No more protection till you use it again.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.100]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.481]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:26.682]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[00:07:26.682 --> 00:07:38.704]  PureWorks disinfecting spray is EPA certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria.
[00:07:38.704 --> 00:07:39.745]  Moles and fungus too.
[00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:41.305]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[00:07:41.405 --> 00:07:44.566]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:45.747]  No more dry skin.
[00:07:45.747 --> 00:07:50.348]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[00:07:50.348 --> 00:07:57.511]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[00:07:57.511 --> 00:07:58.391]  That's 888-245-0300.
[00:07:58.391 --> 00:08:03.693]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.693 --> 00:08:06.474]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.361]  It is Friday.
[00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:13.824]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:13.824 --> 00:08:25.252]  The political tried and trusted tactic of a unpopular establishment when their agenda is in trouble to roll over and play possum for a few months.
[00:08:25.252 --> 00:08:36.761]  They've done that and they say they're trying to pass the health care power grab, the giant tax, which then gives liability protection to the big
[00:08:38.138 --> 00:08:45.103]  HMOs and insurance companies, if other stocks have all been shooting up, on word that it may pass.
[00:08:45.103 --> 00:08:54.410]  And of course, raises your taxes and cuts Medicare and Medicaid, just like the banker bailout wasn't for getting the mortgage market going again.
[00:08:54.410 --> 00:09:00.475]  One day after they passed it, October 3rd, 2008, they did a bait and switch and said, oh, we're not going to spend it on that.
[00:09:00.475 --> 00:09:02.877]  We're not going to tell you what we're going to spend it on.
[00:09:04.824 --> 00:09:13.891]  When I get up here and I say that this is a group of lawless, treasonous, treacherous scum, we are not exaggerating.
[00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:14.911]  We are not joking.
[00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:22.377]  This is an absolutely rogue government stealing everything they can get their hands on.
[00:09:22.377 --> 00:09:27.361]  And I know you know that as listeners, but we better get the word out to the general public.
[00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:27.581]  Sure.
[00:09:29.414 --> 00:09:35.862]  The government has the lowest approval rating, according to Rasmussen and other major polls across the board.
[00:09:35.862 --> 00:09:42.071]  In some polls, the government has as low as an 8% across-the-board approval rating.
[00:09:42.071 --> 00:09:45.755]  The lowest in history.
[00:09:45.755 --> 00:09:46.456]  But they don't care.
[00:09:47.383 --> 00:09:49.265]  They're going for broke.
[00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:51.326]  They've got Homeland Security.
[00:09:51.326 --> 00:09:53.908]  They've got NORTHCOM and the Pentagon standing by.
[00:09:53.908 --> 00:09:55.910]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.132]  They are squeezing everyone into oblivion.
[00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:03.556]  And they're just getting started.
[00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:10.181]  Harry Reid, the little slimeball, says he's bullish on climate bill.
[00:10:10.181 --> 00:10:11.202]  That's out of Mother Jones.
[00:10:13.888 --> 00:10:14.769]  And it continues.
[00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:18.751]  Does John Kerry have good reason to be so optimistic about a climate bill?
[00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:34.342]  The Washington Post reports that he's getting strong signals that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wants a bill ASAP, indicating that senators might be closer to a deal on climate and energy than many people around Washington have assumed.
[00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.323]  They don't care if for a month D.C.
[00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:38.785]  has been buried by record snow.
[00:10:38.785 --> 00:10:42.768]  They don't care if India, China, the United States, England,
[00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:52.526]  Latin America, just the whole planet is having some of the coldest temperatures in a half century.
[00:10:52.526 --> 00:11:00.772]  It doesn't matter if the UN's been disgraced and had to admit that the earth hasn't been warming since 1995 and has been cooling since 2000.
[00:11:00.772 --> 00:11:07.977]  They say that's because of the warming and we're going forward with everything.
[00:11:07.977 --> 00:11:12.601]  And the Austin City Council says we're going to get started with taxes 2.6
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.522]  Billion in three years!
[00:11:17.522 --> 00:11:20.364]  We're going to double your power and gas bill!
[00:11:20.364 --> 00:11:21.404]  Ha ha ha!
[00:11:23.286 --> 00:11:31.208]  And a big Chinese company, they're saying, the second biggest solar maker in China, is coming to Austin to help run it all and help set it up.
[00:11:31.208 --> 00:11:38.530]  That's right, the city of Austin says they're going to give them tax incentives, no property taxes, no nothing, to move here.
[00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:47.733]  And then Austin is going to hand them the money, with Al Gore and others as the investors, to build the giant solar farms to run Austin!
[00:11:47.733 --> 00:11:49.973]  Yes!
[00:11:49.973 --> 00:11:51.254]  You see, it isn't just that they
[00:11:52.304 --> 00:11:55.766]  Tax the tried and true cheap energy sources.
[00:11:55.766 --> 00:12:03.230]  They then take your money and give it to themselves in boondoggles.
[00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.412]  Microcosm of the town I live in.
[00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:12.816]  75 million a year spent on all road repair and construction and maintenance.
[00:12:14.257 --> 00:12:20.039]  150 million spent on the buses that 1% of Austin uses.
[00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:27.060]  But see, that's a special sweetheart contract with their little pals, the private company that runs it.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.421]  And so that's the way it is.
[00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:37.823]  And they say that they're going to try to up it to 300 million in the next five years and that they want another 100 million a year program for rail.
[00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:41.104]  That's only three rail lines that no one will even be able to get to.
[00:12:42.947 --> 00:12:50.833]  Because the United States, modern cities, are set up in a sprawling format based on highways.
[00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:53.315]  And that's just where the globalists want us.
[00:12:53.315 --> 00:13:01.841]  They've got us dependent on the cars and on the fuel and they're gonna jack up the prices on that and slap taxes on it.
[00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:05.243]  And then put trains in that no one literally will ride.
[00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:09.486]  Most of the buses are completely empty and just laugh and hire more cops.
[00:13:10.427 --> 00:13:12.548]  Set up more warrantless checkpoints.
[00:13:12.548 --> 00:13:23.815]  Darwin Bedecker, the local gun show operator in Texas, called me up two days ago and said, Alex, I just drove through on a major road in San Antonio, a warrantless checkpoint searching cars.
[00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:25.576]  He goes, I thought that was illegal.
[00:13:25.576 --> 00:13:36.103]  It is, but they got the guns and they got your money and they're gonna take even more of it because they want you bankrupt.
[00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:54.462]  And the illegal aliens are all above the law and get all the welfare they want and can't be arrested for any basic crime or drunk driving or even robbery or they're released if they do get arrested and the cops are chastised because they're here to drive down the wages and bankrupt things even more.
[00:13:54.462 --> 00:14:06.530]  The bankers like us bankrupt and they're just running up the tab, running up the bill, all made up fiat currency but you're gonna pay it and a jackboot's gonna shake it out of you.
[00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.131]  Because this is government by mafia, for mafia.
[00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:15.033]  You can tell I'm angry and I'm upset.
[00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:16.594]  Yeah, we're having big victories against them.
[00:14:16.594 --> 00:14:18.475]  We've discredited the crooks.
[00:14:18.475 --> 00:14:19.515]  They're in trouble.
[00:14:19.515 --> 00:14:32.081]  But you're going to have to fight and fight and fight and go to your city councils and your state houses and call them to talk radio and put out newsletters and put up websites and make your own films and get my films and make copies of them.
[00:14:33.402 --> 00:14:52.231]  If every American would sit down and watch Fall of the Republic, professionally produced, covers the entire globalist agenda from their own words, how the heart of their takeover is the global fake environmental movement, if every American would see this, there's no way they could get their agenda through.
[00:14:52.231 --> 00:14:58.534]  A couple days ago, my children
[00:15:01.138 --> 00:15:17.314]  We're over at a friend's house and they'd been water coloring and they went over to the sink when they were told to wash up their paints and the little kids were telling them that they'd committed a crime using water because they learned that in school.
[00:15:17.314 --> 00:15:18.676]  It's just everywhere.
[00:15:21.107 --> 00:15:24.729]  Everywhere, just total brainwashing.
[00:15:24.729 --> 00:15:27.551]  Everything will be illegal, everything will be controlled.
[00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:33.835]  When you watch those Audi ads about the Green Police, oh it's so much fun, the Green Police.
[00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:49.780]  When you see that, them swarming homes, arresting people for the wrong light bulbs, for accidentally throwing a Duracell battery in the trash, or for being in a hot tub, that is all going to be illegal.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.201]  You think I'm joking?
[00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.542]  It's in the New York Times.
[00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:53.183]  It's all over the news.
[00:15:53.183 --> 00:16:01.791]  They're training kids to come home and write mock tickets from public school that really reports on their parents about taking a hot bath or leaving the water running while they brush their teeth.
[00:16:02.737 --> 00:16:08.879]  I told you a few months ago in France, the government said we had 154 husbands or wives killed in 2008.
[00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:11.620]  This was in 2009.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.941]  They started reporting it.
[00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:19.323]  And so, if anyone is ever seen raising their voice, they will be arrested.
[00:16:19.323 --> 00:16:30.927]  And if you raise your voice at your child when they run out in the street, Bobby, Bill, David, Jack, whatever your son or daughter's name is, don't be in the street!
[00:16:30.927 --> 00:16:31.807]  I told you not to!
[00:16:34.016 --> 00:16:37.438]  Ah, CPS is coming!
[00:16:37.438 --> 00:16:41.480]  And now it's in the BBC and the New York Times, reporting it like it's good!
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.781]  Does America need this?
[00:16:42.781 --> 00:16:44.542]  Does England need this?
[00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:55.548]  If a husband, it's only men, is seen raising his voice to his wife, that is abuse and the children will be taken and the husband will wear a tracking bracelet on their leg.
[00:16:57.779 --> 00:17:03.481]  And when you have a baby, there will be cameras put in every room of your home and you will be watched.
[00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:16.907]  And if you do one thing ever, if that toddler ever climbs up on a chair and falls off, your child is going to a dirty orphanage where the pedophile government's gonna have their way with him.
[00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:27.788]  You think I'm joking around about the scum and the trash and the unmitigated evil filth that infest government and how they're taking over society?
[00:17:27.788 --> 00:17:31.769]  Let's go out to break with the Green Police brainwashing.
[00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:37.212]  This guy comes in and asks for plastic bags and the cops slam his head in the counter and take him to jail.
[00:17:38.152 --> 00:17:39.433]  But it's all friendly.
[00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:40.774]  We're the Green Police.
[00:17:40.774 --> 00:17:42.536]  La la la.
[00:17:42.536 --> 00:17:43.657]  Paper, plastic.
[00:17:43.657 --> 00:17:44.017]  Plastic.
[00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:45.258]  That's the magic word.
[00:17:45.258 --> 00:17:46.860]  Green Police.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:52.044]  You picked the wrong day to mess with the ecosystem, plastic boy.
[00:17:52.044 --> 00:17:52.845]  Battery!
[00:17:52.845 --> 00:17:53.405]  Let's go!
[00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.147]  Take the house!
[00:17:55.147 --> 00:17:57.349]  It's a Soviet takeover!
[00:17:57.349 --> 00:18:04.575]  We can't wait to punch you in pits and shoot you in the back of the head with a parasite scum!
[00:18:04.575 --> 00:18:05.796]  Did you install these bulbs?
[00:18:06.288 --> 00:18:06.828]  Yeah.
[00:18:06.828 --> 00:18:12.033]  Tragedy strikes tonight where a man has just been arrested for possession of an incandescent light bulb.
[00:18:12.033 --> 00:18:14.275]  What do you guys think about plastic bottles now?
[00:18:14.275 --> 00:18:15.376]  The water setting is at 105.
[00:18:15.376 --> 00:18:23.684]  You got a TDI here?
[00:18:23.684 --> 00:18:24.184]  Clean diesel.
[00:18:24.184 --> 00:18:27.628]  You're good to go, sir.
[00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:28.989]  Think of the brand washing.
[00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.351]  Think of the magnitude of the evil.
[00:18:33.351 --> 00:18:34.851]  We're going to tell you if you can have a bath.
[00:18:34.851 --> 00:18:38.493]  We're going to tell you what you can do.
[00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.773]  We're going to spy on you.
[00:18:40.773 --> 00:18:46.015]  Every control freak in the world will be turned loose to run your life.
[00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:56.498]  All the narcissistic, lazy scum that couldn't get a job, couldn't build a business, who think entrepreneurs are bad, who hate anyone that has two pennies to rub together.
[00:18:56.498 --> 00:18:58.519]  All being given uniforms and weapons.
[00:18:59.659 --> 00:19:03.342]  Oh, they're training them for this in all the colleges right now.
[00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:04.843]  It's already happening everywhere.
[00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:06.504]  This ad is not a joke.
[00:19:06.504 --> 00:19:12.909]  And the San Francisco mayor came out and admitted a company he works with in San Francisco produced it, and that this is what they want.
[00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:14.730]  This is what they're going to do.
[00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.451]  This is who they are.
[00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:18.413]  You're going to be their slaves now.
[00:19:19.073 --> 00:19:33.803]  And all the lazy trash is going to be given weapons and power over you, the producers, and they're going to suck off you and never stop because they're greedy, degenerate, filthy trash.
[00:19:33.803 --> 00:19:38.006]  And if you won't wake up and get angry and understand what's happening historically,
[00:19:38.806 --> 00:19:42.529]  Then you deserve the raping they're gonna give you.
[00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:48.453]  And their parasite hordes of lazy, power-tripping, control-freak scum.
[00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:51.935]  And we're gonna break down all the news straight ahead.
[00:19:51.935 --> 00:19:58.419]  The healthcare takeover, the environmental takeover, and secret UN documents, now mainstream news.
[00:19:58.419 --> 00:19:58.940]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:04.090]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.392]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:20:06.392 --> 00:20:07.253]  Don't!
[00:20:07.253 --> 00:20:10.696]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:20:10.696 --> 00:20:17.823]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:20:17.803 --> 00:20:19.785]  's number one debt secret.
[00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:23.449]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:20:23.849 --> 00:20:26.990]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:34.353]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:20:34.353 --> 00:20:35.554]  Herb K was right.
[00:20:35.554 --> 00:20:38.715]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:40.095]  What have you got to lose?
[00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:43.797]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:20:43.797 --> 00:20:47.738]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:20:47.738 --> 00:20:48.018]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:52.461]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:02.714]  Hi, this is Peter Krachnobyl with Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.714 --> 00:21:07.475]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:14.096]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[00:21:14.096 --> 00:21:16.597]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:21:16.597 --> 00:21:19.177]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:24.339]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is a lose-lose proposition.
[00:21:24.339 --> 00:21:25.679]  Lose on your capital investment,
[00:21:25.839 --> 00:21:29.221]  And when you cash out, you're paid in the dollar that is losing value every day.
[00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:35.564]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:21:35.564 --> 00:21:39.647]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:21:39.647 --> 00:21:44.129]  Call me today, Peter Krashen, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:21:44.129 --> 00:21:49.252]  And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:21:49.252 --> 00:21:49.492]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.493 --> 00:21:53.936]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:53.936 --> 00:21:55.578]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:55.578 --> 00:21:56.679]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:22:11.132 --> 00:22:13.793]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.793 --> 00:22:20.194]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:20.194 --> 00:22:25.376]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.376 --> 00:22:35.358]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.498 --> 00:22:37.840]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.422]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.422 --> 00:22:41.884]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.884 --> 00:22:44.007]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:44.007 --> 00:22:49.172]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:58.521]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:23:51.275 --> 00:23:51.735]  We love you!
[00:24:15.122 --> 00:24:25.847]  Hey, before I forget to talk about this, Shooter Jennings is on the radio show Monday.
[00:24:25.847 --> 00:24:29.128]  And now I can talk about this.
[00:24:29.128 --> 00:24:33.170]  I knew about this a little while back, but he told me I could talk about it yesterday.
[00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:39.233]  We're gonna have the world premiere of his new album here on air.
[00:24:41.454 --> 00:24:47.738]  And guess who does spoken word throughout the album?
[00:24:47.738 --> 00:24:55.823]  Shooter Jennings, son of Waylon Jennings, a very successful musician in his own right, tours with Willie Nelson, you name it.
[00:24:55.823 --> 00:24:57.584]  Stephen King!
[00:24:57.584 --> 00:25:03.368]  Stephen King is a big fan of Shooter Jennings.
[00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:05.930]  And guess what else I found out?
[00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.310]  Yeah!
[00:25:08.476 --> 00:25:09.177]  Absolutely.
[00:25:09.177 --> 00:25:12.939]  Stephen King likes my radio show and what we're doing here.
[00:25:12.939 --> 00:25:20.344]  And it's a Stephen King anti-New World Order rant at the beginning of each of the 14 tracks.
[00:25:20.344 --> 00:25:28.329]  Spoken word by Stephen King on the New World Order.
[00:25:28.329 --> 00:25:30.911]  Premiering here Monday.
[00:25:35.356 --> 00:25:42.922]  King's working on some projects right now, but there is a good chance we're going to get him on the air in the future, live, with Shooter.
[00:25:42.922 --> 00:25:43.362]  Who knows?
[00:25:43.362 --> 00:25:46.005]  Might even happen Monday.
[00:25:46.005 --> 00:25:48.507]  I mean, that is so exciting.
[00:25:48.507 --> 00:25:51.049]  Stephen King!
[00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:54.071]  No one's books have been made into more movies.
[00:25:54.071 --> 00:25:56.573]  And, of course, he wrote The Running Man.
[00:25:56.573 --> 00:25:59.455]  What, was it in the late 70s and they made it into a movie in 86, 85?
[00:26:02.489 --> 00:26:03.550]  The Running Man!
[00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.031]  Who loves you?
[00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:06.672]  And who do you love?
[00:26:06.672 --> 00:26:10.614]  Cadre kids, remember, November is recruitment month.
[00:26:10.614 --> 00:26:13.916]  Report a family member and get a double bonus credit.
[00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:20.960]  Anyone caught outside after dark without their proper pass will be permanently detained.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.661]  The Running Man!
[00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:24.763]  And every other big movie.
[00:26:24.763 --> 00:26:29.546]  Total expert on the New World Order, Stephen King.
[00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:31.227]  I mean, just everybody knows.
[00:26:32.165 --> 00:26:38.089]  I got contacted yesterday by another huge movie star, and I'm going to be hooking up with them.
[00:26:38.089 --> 00:26:39.850]  They're coming here during South by Southwest.
[00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:46.735]  They contacted me, and I'm going to try to get them on the show in the next few weeks, maybe even in studio.
[00:26:46.735 --> 00:26:51.778]  And again, why is that important?
[00:26:51.778 --> 00:27:00.925]  Because this is a culture drunk on entertainment, drunk on media icons, and when these big stars and writers and people come out against the New World Order,
[00:27:02.566 --> 00:27:10.628]  It just shows how we are the majority, and that's the last domino to fall.
[00:27:10.628 --> 00:27:23.530]  And yes, it's very successful, it's very effective to have all these big movie stars and icon writers and others coming out against the New World Order, as if you couldn't read all of King's books and already know that.
[00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:28.612]  A secret government group releases the flu to depopulate the planet.
[00:27:28.612 --> 00:27:30.212]  What, he wrote that 20 years ago?
[00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:32.310]  I read that book.
[00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.911]  I've read so many of them, I forget the name.
[00:27:33.911 --> 00:27:40.294]  What's the, uh... What's the one where they release the... like this evil guy?
[00:27:40.294 --> 00:27:45.697]  He's basically the devil, but he releases flu to kill the majority... The Stand, yeah.
[00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:52.881]  I mean, this guy... I mean, you could just already know Stephen King knew about this when I was in diapers!
[00:27:52.881 --> 00:27:55.062]  So we can't say Alex Jones woke Stephen King up.
[00:28:01.286 --> 00:28:16.114]  But every time we get more successful, it just makes the government and the mainstream media and the jealous alternative haters go that much more crazy.
[00:28:16.114 --> 00:28:23.778]  I don't know why you guys get so upset and so jealous about me and make up new lies more ridiculous than the last every day.
[00:28:23.778 --> 00:28:24.538]  Some of you out there.
[00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:34.229]  Because we're literally waking the planet up and if you're little parasites that just want to be stars, you ought to be happy.
[00:28:34.229 --> 00:28:39.076]  This movement wouldn't be one half as big as it is right now if it wasn't for all the work I've done.
[00:28:39.076 --> 00:28:41.199]  And all the work my listeners have done.
[00:28:44.434 --> 00:28:46.955]  See, I have a real goal to bring down the New World Order.
[00:28:46.955 --> 00:28:52.098]  I don't want to pay $2.6 billion in Austin the next three years on carbon taxes.
[00:28:52.098 --> 00:28:53.819]  I'm upset about being a slave.
[00:28:53.819 --> 00:28:57.081]  I don't want to lose my granddaddy's rifle I've got.
[00:28:57.081 --> 00:28:58.261]  That's why I do what I do.
[00:28:58.261 --> 00:29:00.943]  That's why I can go four hours and not take one call.
[00:29:00.943 --> 00:29:04.805]  I can do ten hours because I have real passion.
[00:29:04.805 --> 00:29:06.366]  I really care about what I'm doing.
[00:29:07.375 --> 00:29:12.798]  And so I get the stardom you so crave.
[00:29:12.798 --> 00:29:16.660]  And you don't get it because you're not in this for the right reasons.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:24.385]  And let me tell you, my rising star, as people call it, is actually a burden and I don't like it.
[00:29:24.385 --> 00:29:28.127]  But I do like the byproduct of it, meaning I'm having success against the New World Order.
[00:29:29.252 --> 00:29:31.893]  I'm walking point, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:31.893 --> 00:29:35.735]  And we're making all the right connections that can bring down this New World Order.
[00:29:35.735 --> 00:29:37.095]  And they know it.
[00:29:37.095 --> 00:29:44.118]  And the establishment media has identified me as the numero uno enemy of the New World Order program.
[00:29:44.118 --> 00:29:46.719]  Cause I got their number.
[00:29:46.719 --> 00:29:48.280]  And I'm not backing down.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.941]  I keep on a-coming.
[00:29:50.941 --> 00:29:52.342]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.342 --> 00:29:54.883]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.883 --> 00:29:57.564]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:05.969]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:05.969 --> 00:30:14.831]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:19.472]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:19.472 --> 00:30:30.274]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:30.914 --> 00:30:40.418]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:40.418 --> 00:30:45.860]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:53.344]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:53.344 --> 00:30:56.085]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:31:01.895 --> 00:31:05.920]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.143]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.143 --> 00:31:10.565]  Is it finishing off this agenda?
[00:31:11.272 --> 00:31:13.953]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:13.953 --> 00:31:20.334]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.334 --> 00:31:25.536]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.536 --> 00:31:35.518]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.638 --> 00:31:37.979]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:39.580]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.021]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.021 --> 00:31:44.162]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.162 --> 00:31:49.305]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.305 --> 00:31:58.409]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:00.814 --> 00:32:05.437]  Is garlic the absolute best defense against the threat of bacterial and viral pandemics?
[00:32:05.437 --> 00:32:05.878]  No.
[00:32:05.878 --> 00:32:08.920]  The answer is Ali-C from youralistore.com.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:16.325]  Ali-C was developed by a British chemist who found a way to stabilize the allicin in garlic and incorporated into his flagship product Ali-C.
[00:32:16.325 --> 00:32:18.046]  It's the strongest and safest antibiotic
[00:32:24.274 --> 00:32:31.398]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:32:31.398 --> 00:32:35.961]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:32:35.961 --> 00:32:41.785]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:32:41.785 --> 00:32:45.187]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:32:45.407 --> 00:32:48.129]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:32:48.129 --> 00:32:53.193]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:32:53.193 --> 00:32:53.473]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:32:53.473 --> 00:32:54.234]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:54.234 --> 00:32:55.174]  Yeah, Stephen King on the team!
[00:32:55.174 --> 00:32:55.355]  Ha ha ha!
[00:32:55.355 --> 00:32:55.775]  This is the end.
[00:33:15.478 --> 00:33:21.184]  This is the end, my only friend.
[00:33:21.184 --> 00:33:27.230]  The end of our elaborate plans.
[00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:33.217]  The end of everything that stands.
[00:33:33.217 --> 00:33:36.260]  The end, no save.
[00:33:48.358 --> 00:34:06.065]  After Roland of Gilead finally scales the Black Tower, he is transported back to ten years before, riding through a desert.
[00:34:09.061 --> 00:34:13.983]  To carry out his journey yet again.
[00:34:13.983 --> 00:34:23.068]  Because for every ending, there is a new beginning.
[00:34:23.068 --> 00:34:31.993]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:34:31.993 --> 00:34:32.753]  to 3 p.m.
[00:34:32.753 --> 00:34:35.855]  Central Standard Time, we are live.
[00:34:37.898 --> 00:34:42.380]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.162]  Don't forget, listeners, the new free iPhone app.
[00:34:46.162 --> 00:34:48.443]  Five-star rating.
[00:34:48.443 --> 00:34:51.265]  Over 200 five-star ratings.
[00:34:51.265 --> 00:34:54.947]  Five-star free app.
[00:34:54.947 --> 00:34:57.388]  Most of the free apps have got one and a half stars.
[00:34:57.388 --> 00:34:58.709]  It's five stars.
[00:34:58.709 --> 00:35:02.491]  It's free.
[00:35:02.491 --> 00:35:06.733]  And it's available right now for free download at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:08.342 --> 00:35:10.724]  I know 20,000 of you downloaded it in the last two weeks.
[00:35:10.724 --> 00:35:12.926]  That is nothing.
[00:35:12.926 --> 00:35:23.954]  We need everybody out there who has friends and family that have iPhones to email them the link to the iPhone store where it's free and say, hey, I sent you this free link to this radio show.
[00:35:23.954 --> 00:35:26.136]  It's got key information you need to know about.
[00:35:26.136 --> 00:35:29.398]  That's just another little way to reach people.
[00:35:29.398 --> 00:35:34.983]  And sure, in a year from now, we'll have 300, 400, 500,000 people that have downloaded it.
[00:35:34.983 --> 00:35:36.184]  We need to have that in a month.
[00:35:37.128 --> 00:35:42.351]  Not in a year.
[00:35:42.351 --> 00:35:52.076]  Because the last domino to fall in the New World Order illusion is that those of us that know this system is a fraud and parasitic are a minority.
[00:35:52.076 --> 00:35:55.237]  We are not a minority.
[00:35:55.237 --> 00:35:59.760]  We are the majority.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.101]  And there's a revolution going on in Hollywood.
[00:36:02.101 --> 00:36:06.003]  You heard Michael Braverman, TV producer in Hollywood,
[00:36:07.912 --> 00:36:19.784]  Jesse Ventura's manager, you heard him without me even prompting him on the show a few months ago, say that he can't believe all the top Hollywood stars that have called him but are afraid to come out against the New World Order.
[00:36:19.784 --> 00:36:21.486]  They're sick of the left-right paradigm.
[00:36:21.486 --> 00:36:23.487]  They don't want to be known as leftists.
[00:36:23.487 --> 00:36:25.149]  They don't want to be known as right-wingers.
[00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:27.932]  They don't choose those two labels.
[00:36:27.932 --> 00:36:31.696]  They are pro-liberty, anti-New World Order.
[00:36:33.271 --> 00:36:48.440]  But that the kingpins in Hollywood, like Steven Spielberg, will try to blackball them or crush them, no matter how big they are, if they come out and say, we're not part of this false paradigm.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:37:00.827]  It is the majority of top writers who know about the New World Order.
[00:37:04.272 --> 00:37:08.014]  It is the majority of people in Hollywood.
[00:37:08.014 --> 00:37:09.735]  You say, well, why is that important?
[00:37:09.735 --> 00:37:18.559]  Because the media has made that God and made that the arbiter of style and culture and our rudder.
[00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:29.025]  And they've used a false image of Hollywood to sell dehumanization and torture porn and tyranny and mindlessness.
[00:37:30.049 --> 00:37:35.994]  They've steered rap and hip-hop into mindless deviltry.
[00:37:35.994 --> 00:37:45.383]  They've steered rock and roll in that direction and the entire culture and the people within those cultures don't like it and don't want to be part of it.
[00:37:47.017 --> 00:38:00.322]  And so the manifestation of the revolution against tyranny going on in the highest levels of the culture system shows this new world order is in deep, deep, deep crisis.
[00:38:00.322 --> 00:38:10.986]  I'm having one of those senior moments.
[00:38:10.986 --> 00:38:13.767]  Who's the writer who wrote Jurassic Park and
[00:38:15.066 --> 00:38:32.889]  All the rest of my, I read the book, Michael Crichton, I read his book two years ago, and then Googled him, I mean, I knew who he was well from going back to some of his earliest science fiction works.
[00:38:32.889 --> 00:38:43.171]  And he wrote a book about state of fear, about phony environmentalist trillionaires, secretly trying to bring in a world government and staging environmental catastrophes to push it through.
[00:38:43.936 --> 00:38:48.700]  And then he died of, what was it, lung cancer?
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.041]  Michael Crichton.
[00:38:50.041 --> 00:38:51.162]  So I read more of his books.
[00:38:51.162 --> 00:39:01.590]  Total anti-New World Order.
[00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:07.034]  When I pick up science fiction now, the top writers, it's all anti-New World Order.
[00:39:07.034 --> 00:39:09.656]  When I have time to read it.
[00:39:09.656 --> 00:39:10.397]  It's just everywhere.
[00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:18.522]  But on the nightly news, they make us feel like we're the minority.
[00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.983]  They tell us we're all alone.
[00:39:20.983 --> 00:39:30.089]  They tell us we don't have any power, when we do have incredible power.
[00:39:30.089 --> 00:39:35.093]  Alright, here's the big breaking news today.
[00:39:35.093 --> 00:39:36.474]  Reid Bullish on climate bill.
[00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:38.195]  He said they're going to try to pass it in the next month.
[00:39:39.767 --> 00:39:42.709]  Obama's bipartisan health deal may not be possible.
[00:39:42.709 --> 00:39:46.672]  He says he's going to try to ram it through next week.
[00:39:46.672 --> 00:39:48.093]  Call Congress.
[00:39:48.093 --> 00:39:49.514]  Call your House and Senate members.
[00:39:49.514 --> 00:39:52.175]  You tell them, do not do it.
[00:39:52.175 --> 00:40:01.702]  Or you don't care who is running against the incumbent, you're going to support them.
[00:40:01.702 --> 00:40:07.826]  I mean, go ahead, vote for Debra Medina, even if she threw 9-11 Truth under the bus and said we were despicable.
[00:40:11.112 --> 00:40:15.416]  Rick Perry's gotta go.
[00:40:15.416 --> 00:40:20.822]  But regardless, you run for City Council, County Commissioner, State House.
[00:40:20.822 --> 00:40:23.425]  Even if you don't win, you'll get up there in the debates and at the
[00:40:24.434 --> 00:40:27.798]  Conferences and at the meetings and be able to speak the truth!
[00:40:27.798 --> 00:40:29.319]  Just get out there and take action.
[00:40:29.319 --> 00:40:33.363]  I get hundreds of calls and emails every day saying, Alex, I've got a secret plan.
[00:40:33.363 --> 00:40:39.450]  If you just do this, if you just do that, if we just launch this program, if you just travel the country, this would fix it.
[00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:40.070]  No!
[00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:43.594]  There is no silver bullet in Alex Jones.
[00:40:43.594 --> 00:40:46.097]  There's no silver bullet in Bob Smith.
[00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:56.798]  John Doe, it's the spirit of resistance and liberty putting your body against the machinery of the tyrants.
[00:40:56.798 --> 00:41:10.230]  Little things done over and over again creates almost a harmonic shaking of the foundations of this control grid.
[00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.653]  We are being collectively baptized in tyranny now.
[00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:22.113]  As they openly say, yes, we're listening to everything you do on your phones without warrants.
[00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:23.794]  Yes, we're setting up warrantless checkpoints.
[00:41:23.794 --> 00:41:25.935]  Yes, we're shutting down gun shows without a law.
[00:41:25.935 --> 00:41:27.596]  Yes, we're taking your blood without warrants.
[00:41:27.596 --> 00:41:32.480]  Yes, we're taking your baby's blood at birth for Pentagon Bioweapon Laboratory research.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.923]  Yes, yes, we're going to arrest you for tiny environmental infractions.
[00:41:36.923 --> 00:41:38.764]  Yes, we're going to bankrupt you.
[00:41:38.764 --> 00:41:40.605]  Yes, we're going to launch new wars.
[00:41:40.605 --> 00:41:43.127]  Yes, we're going to put you through naked body scanners.
[00:41:43.127 --> 00:41:46.609]  Yes, we're going to arrest you for videotaping the police out in the open.
[00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:47.410]  That's totally legal.
[00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:53.273]  Yes, we're going to have federal courts rule there's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:41:53.273 --> 00:42:00.336]  They're just throwing down the gauntlet in your face, and it's an attempt to buffalo you, to break your will.
[00:42:00.336 --> 00:42:04.238]  Don't let them do it!
[00:42:04.238 --> 00:42:11.762]  Even if they get part of their big agenda through, that'll only make people more angry, more upset.
[00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:16.224]  But instead of backing off the New World Order as their approval rating drops to 8% for government,
[00:42:18.874 --> 00:42:24.278]  The lowest ever by a mile.
[00:42:24.278 --> 00:42:27.140]  Plunging!
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.000]  What do they do?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.465]  They go all in and say, alright, we are tyrants.
[00:42:34.465 --> 00:42:41.150]  What are you gonna do about it?
[00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.972]  What are you gonna do about it?
[00:42:43.972 --> 00:42:45.593]  We're the conquerors!
[00:42:47.009 --> 00:42:51.451]  And none of you are gonna stand up here and fight us.
[00:42:51.451 --> 00:42:53.711]  None of you got what it takes.
[00:42:53.711 --> 00:42:56.852]  Well, you do have what it takes, and they know it.
[00:42:56.852 --> 00:43:01.414]  And they're getting more and more scared by the minute.
[00:43:01.414 --> 00:43:06.195]  They realize the sleeping giant is rising.
[00:43:06.195 --> 00:43:10.857]  They realize the human desire for liberty and freedom.
[00:43:12.455 --> 00:43:15.196]  Is pulsing with power.
[00:43:15.196 --> 00:43:20.598]  Is burning in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:27.780]  And I have come to light those fires of liberty in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:37.803]  I have sworn on the altar of God Almighty eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny over the minds of men.
[00:43:42.827 --> 00:43:46.429]  PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[00:43:46.429 --> 00:43:53.713]  PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[00:43:53.713 --> 00:43:59.316]  Leaked UN documents reveal plan for Green World Order.
[00:43:59.316 --> 00:44:01.217]  That's a quote.
[00:44:01.217 --> 00:44:02.718]  By 2012.
[00:44:02.718 --> 00:44:09.282]  The numerology-obsessed cultists are obsessed with that date.
[00:44:10.572 --> 00:44:16.675]  And that date will come, and it will pass, and they will fail!
[00:44:16.675 --> 00:44:23.618]  Massive 45 trillion transfer of wealth to fund the creation of global governance.
[00:44:23.618 --> 00:44:26.600]  We have the internal UN report.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.441]  It's in the AP, Fox News has got it.
[00:44:29.441 --> 00:44:34.143]  We break down the full spectrum analysis at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:44:34.143 --> 00:44:35.824]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:44:38.126 --> 00:45:04.913]  Leaked policy documents reveal that the United Nations plans to create a Green World Order by 2012, which will be enforced by a structure of global governance and funded by a gargantuan $45 trillion transfer of wealth from richer countries, as the globalist, insidious plan to centralize power, crush sovereignty, while devastating the economy is exposed once again.
[00:45:06.557 --> 00:45:31.214]  As we warned at the time, the failure of Copenhagen in December did not spell the end of the global warming heist, but merely a roadblock in the UN's agenda to create a world government funded by taxes paid by you on the very substance you exhale, carbon dioxide.
[00:45:31.214 --> 00:45:33.716]  Today carbon dioxide, tomorrow the world.
[00:45:37.797 --> 00:46:03.000]  Using the justification of the vehemently debunked hoax that carbon dioxide is a deadly threat to the planet, the UN is already working to resurrect the failed Copenhagen Agreement with a series of new Copenhagen process negotiations set to take place in April, May, and June, culminating in Mexico City.
[00:46:04.224 --> 00:46:26.809]  Leaked planning documents, PDF obtained by Fox News, lift the lid off the UN's plan to impose global governance by the time of their 2012 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Rio, which will mark the 20th anniversary since the notorious Earth Summit held in the same city.
[00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:28.349]  The New Rio Summit
[00:46:30.407 --> 00:46:44.857]  Now, that's in the document.
[00:46:44.857 --> 00:46:45.878]  We have a copy.
[00:46:45.878 --> 00:46:47.319]  We go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:46:47.319 --> 00:46:50.041]  I'll show it to the TV viewers, but it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:54.944]  The head climatologist of NASA saying a book published three months.
[00:46:54.944 --> 00:46:56.345]  One of the heads climatologist of
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.808]  NASA say in a book published three months ago, the exact same words.
[00:47:09.808 --> 00:47:12.614]  We've got to get this information out to everybody.
[00:47:12.614 --> 00:47:16.922]  No one can stop you if you do it person to person with Fall of the Republic.
[00:47:17.526 --> 00:47:25.328]  And with this article, no one can stop you from getting the DVD and making copies of it and telling people to watch it.
[00:47:25.328 --> 00:47:28.088]  And you don't have to buy the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:47:28.088 --> 00:47:30.529]  You can Google, Follow the Republic.
[00:47:30.529 --> 00:47:37.351]  And the number one link is a YouTube channel with a million three hundred thousand views, just one of hundreds of postings of it.
[00:47:37.351 --> 00:47:43.212]  And you can get it out to everybody you know if you just have the simple will to warn them and explain what's happening!
[00:47:43.852 --> 00:47:53.797]  And go to your local school board and you tell them stop brainwashing children with this debunked, sickening fraud!
[00:47:53.797 --> 00:47:58.740]  We have to rout these people out and dig them out of their rat holes everywhere!
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.822]  They're a group of scallywag scum!
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:24.710]  Just exactly what the environmental order will look like and the extent of the immense financial commitments needed to produce it are under discussion this week at a special session in Bali, Indonesia of the United Nations Environment Program 58 Nation Governing Council Global Ministerial Environmental Forum.
[00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:27.691]  We already know, we saw the Copenhagen Treaty, we know what it is.
[00:48:27.691 --> 00:48:29.372]  Taxes on everything.
[00:48:29.372 --> 00:48:31.453]  Cars, air travel, food, water.
[00:48:32.774 --> 00:48:39.459]  Which oversees, in a total 2% GDP tax, which oversees the UNAP's operations.
[00:48:39.459 --> 00:48:47.384]  We heard Gordon Brown last week say, it's going to be a global tax paid in a new global treaty of the banks, who are openly our government now.
[00:48:47.384 --> 00:48:49.766]  Congress even admits the banks run us.
[00:48:49.766 --> 00:48:54.610]  They met in secret, they're hammering it out three weeks ago in Australia.
[00:48:54.610 --> 00:49:00.374]  The document outlines the globalist mission to enact a quote, radical transformation of the world economic and social order.
[00:49:01.653 --> 00:49:06.014]  By putting, quote, a new treaty in place as the capstone.
[00:49:06.014 --> 00:49:07.715]  Gotta love those New World Order quotes.
[00:49:07.715 --> 00:49:10.296]  See, this is from the document.
[00:49:10.296 --> 00:49:15.698]  A new treaty in place as the capstone of the Green World Order.
[00:49:15.698 --> 00:49:19.199]  The capstone of the pyramid is the environmental control grid.
[00:49:19.199 --> 00:49:27.362]  The capstone of the Green World Order, which is really blood red.
[00:49:27.362 --> 00:49:30.083]  Oh, these parasitic vampires want to totally lock us down.
[00:49:30.083 --> 00:49:30.823]  They're gonna fail.
[00:49:32.287 --> 00:49:38.993]  The document outlines the globalist mission to enact a radical transformation of the world economic and social order by putting a new treaty in place as the capstone.
[00:49:38.993 --> 00:49:41.295]  I'm quoting.
[00:49:41.295 --> 00:49:41.936]  This is a quote.
[00:49:41.936 --> 00:49:49.342]  Radical transformation of the world economic and social order by putting a new treaty in place as the capstone of the green world order.
[00:49:49.342 --> 00:49:51.704]  Total social engineering.
[00:49:51.704 --> 00:49:58.170]  The system will be managed by, quote, an additional governing structure composed of exactly those insiders.
[00:49:59.727 --> 00:50:07.408]  Moving towards a green economy would also provide an opportunity to re-examine national and global governance structures.
[00:50:07.408 --> 00:50:08.228]  That's a quote.
[00:50:08.228 --> 00:50:16.910]  And consider whether such structures allow the international community to respond to current and future environmental development challenges and to capitalize on emerging opportunities.
[00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:19.110]  Just any new lies they want to make up.
[00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:21.251]  States the white paper.
[00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:28.172]  Emphasis on the imposition of new global governance structures
[00:50:29.445 --> 00:50:35.186]  Will be achieved with the help of, quote, vast wealth transfers.
[00:50:35.186 --> 00:50:37.947]  Vast wealth transfers.
[00:50:37.947 --> 00:50:38.867]  Alert!
[00:50:38.867 --> 00:50:40.588]  Alert!
[00:50:40.588 --> 00:50:46.389]  Criminal tyranny of the most devastating type, a eugenics cult, has seized control of the nation.
[00:50:46.389 --> 00:50:47.289]  Alert!
[00:50:47.289 --> 00:50:48.210]  Alert!
[00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:53.251]  The planet is falling into the sway of murdering psychopaths whose religious belief
[00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:54.171]  I think?
[00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:13.089]  I think so.
[00:51:31.397 --> 00:51:40.721]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:40.721 --> 00:51:47.764]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:47.764 --> 00:51:51.706]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:51:51.906 --> 00:51:52.847]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:51:52.847 --> 00:51:56.549]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:03.333]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:52:03.333 --> 00:52:07.335]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:07.335 --> 00:52:10.597]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:10.597 --> 00:52:11.998]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:12.722 --> 00:52:15.383]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:15.383 --> 00:52:21.784]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:21.784 --> 00:52:27.326]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:27.326 --> 00:52:36.948]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:37.068 --> 00:52:39.429]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:39.429 --> 00:52:41.009]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:41.009 --> 00:52:43.470]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:45.591]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:50.733]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:08.791]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[00:53:08.791 --> 00:53:11.312]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?
[00:53:11.312 --> 00:53:12.852]  To have a sex life again?

[00:54:03.012 --> 00:54:07.633]  When we had a president, we'd see a giant global political figure.
[00:54:07.633 --> 00:54:11.934]  The man that would be the political leader for 500 million people.
[00:54:11.934 --> 00:54:15.135]  The man that would represent all of us on the world stage.
[00:54:15.135 --> 00:54:20.396]  The man whose job was so important that of course you're paid more than President Obama.
[00:54:20.396 --> 00:54:22.137]  Well I'm afraid what we got was you.
[00:54:24.272 --> 00:54:38.765]  And I'm sorry, but after that performance earlier that you gave, and I don't want to be rude, but you know, really, you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.
[00:54:38.765 --> 00:54:45.370]  And the question that I want to ask, the question that I want to ask, that we're all going to ask is, who are you?
[00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:48.153]  I'd never heard of you.
[00:54:48.153 --> 00:54:50.015]  Nobody in Europe had ever heard of you.
[00:54:51.247 --> 00:54:56.469]  I would like to ask you, President, who voted for you?
[00:54:56.469 --> 00:54:58.430]  And what mechanism?
[00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:01.851]  Oh, I know democracy is not popular with you lot.
[00:55:01.851 --> 00:55:06.032]  And what mechanism do the peoples of Europe have to remove you?
[00:55:06.032 --> 00:55:08.273]  Is this European democracy?
[00:55:08.273 --> 00:55:14.435]  Well, I sense that you're competent and capable and dangerous.
[00:55:14.435 --> 00:55:16.196]  And I have no doubt that it's your intention.
[00:55:16.696 --> 00:55:22.618]  To be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the European nation states.
[00:55:22.618 --> 00:55:27.960]  You appear to have a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation states.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:33.002]  Perhaps that's because you come from Belgium, which of course is pretty much a non-country.
[00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:41.849]  But since you took over, we've seen Greece reduced to nothing more than a protectorate.
[00:55:41.849 --> 00:55:57.123]  Sir, you have no legitimacy in this job at all, and I can say with confidence that I can speak on behalf of the majority of the British people in saying, we don't know you, we don't want you, and the sooner you're put out to grass, the better.
[00:55:59.747 --> 00:56:03.788]  Well, as you said, Mr. President, you wouldn't like to be rude.
[00:56:03.788 --> 00:56:10.750]  And I, well, I prefer to go ahead with the statement.
[00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:18.672]  That's Nigel Farage joining us with an exclusive European Union Member of Parliament from England coming up in the next segment.
[00:56:18.672 --> 00:56:19.972]  He's in Europe right now.
[00:56:19.972 --> 00:56:20.052]  UK's
[00:56:22.699 --> 00:56:29.124]  European Member of Parliament Nigel Farage faces reprimand after calling Herman Van Rompuy wet rag.
[00:56:29.124 --> 00:56:30.565]  That is the London Telegraph.
[00:56:30.565 --> 00:56:31.626]  Here's the London Guardian.
[00:56:31.626 --> 00:56:33.968]  Nigel Farage, rampage of rudeness.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.081]  Well, we have all the internal documents.
[00:56:37.081 --> 00:56:43.423]  It's all over the news in Europe that the EU intends to bankrupt the nations and bring them fully under its control.
[00:56:43.423 --> 00:56:45.383]  Herman Van Rompuy is unelected.
[00:56:45.383 --> 00:56:47.824]  Oh, don't be rude to this scumbag!
[00:56:47.824 --> 00:57:00.448]  Don't call out this filth that calls for global government and global taxes through the carbon tax, the tip of the green world government pyramid that they talk about in this United Nations document.
[00:57:00.828 --> 00:57:13.825]  Just out today, PrisonPlanet.com, a $45 trillion wealth transfer from what's left of Europe and the United States' middle class to Herman Von Ruppe and the bankers that control him!
[00:57:16.513 --> 00:57:17.814]  Give me a document cam shot.
[00:57:17.814 --> 00:57:19.555]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:19.555 --> 00:57:21.656]  Here is the UN document I was covering.
[00:57:21.656 --> 00:57:24.258]  We'll talk about this with Nigel Farage and a lot more.
[00:57:24.258 --> 00:57:31.182]  Then when he leaves us in about 35 minutes into the next hour, I will go through this document in detail today.
[00:57:31.182 --> 00:57:32.423]  Then Bob Chapman's joining us.
[00:57:32.423 --> 00:57:45.591]  Then we got John Young of Cryptome that got shut down without a court order, without anything, via Microsoft when he published their secret document of how they're spying on everyone without warrants for the police.
[00:57:46.411 --> 00:57:52.336]  So that is coming up as well as the establishment is very frightened of people exposing them.
[00:57:52.336 --> 00:58:02.324]  Their hubris is draining out of their pig-like bodies and they're now girding themselves for battle with the internet and free speech.
[00:58:02.324 --> 00:58:03.545]  So that is coming up.
[00:58:03.545 --> 00:58:07.608]  But the uproar was so huge they've now restored Kryptome.
[00:58:07.608 --> 00:58:10.631]  Because of the black eye it was giving Microsoft.
[00:58:10.631 --> 00:58:11.892]  So that is coming up.
[00:58:11.892 --> 00:58:14.114]  But after this quick break, Nigel Farage.
[00:58:15.689 --> 00:58:27.613]  Member of the European Union, Pardell, who will stand up and speak to trash and scum like they deserve to be spoken to, will be joining us live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:27.613 --> 00:58:36.896]  And then, next Monday, the exclusive new album from Shooter Jennings and Stephen King, Against the New World Order.
[00:58:36.896 --> 00:58:40.977]  You will hear Stephen King, spoken word for the first time ever, here on this show.
[00:58:42.186 --> 00:58:47.813]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:47.813 --> 00:58:51.037]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:52.941 --> 00:58:56.945]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:56.945 --> 00:59:00.189]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:59:00.189 --> 00:59:04.994]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:04.994 --> 00:59:11.401]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:11.401 --> 00:59:13.644]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:14.164 --> 00:59:14.464]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:14.464 --> 00:59:14.965]  Bernanke?
[00:59:14.965 --> 00:59:15.585]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:16.305]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:16.305 --> 00:59:18.427]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:33.055 --> 00:59:35.196]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:35.196 --> 00:59:40.337]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:59:40.337 --> 00:59:54.742]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:54.742 --> 00:59:57.123]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.123 --> 00:59:59.904]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:11.316]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:12.898]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.898 --> 01:00:14.460]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.644]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.644 --> 01:00:23.590]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:26.933]  He is a member of the European Union Parliament, hailing from England.
[01:00:26.933 --> 01:00:28.154]  He's back in England now.
[01:00:29.657 --> 01:00:33.138]  And of course, he's the former United Kingdom Independence Party head.
[01:00:33.138 --> 01:00:36.599]  He stepped down for that to run for another office.
[01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:38.240]  And we are joined by him.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.941]  He's all over the U.S., British, European news.
[01:00:41.941 --> 01:00:50.564]  Scouring Herman Van Rompuy, the guy that openly calls for world government, a $45 trillion to begin with, wealth transfer from Europe, England, the U.S.
[01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:52.905]  and Canada, Australia to the U.N.
[01:00:53.465 --> 01:01:02.128]  Gordon Brown last week called for a global government through a banking constitution where the banks take full control of the nations and the taxes are paid directly to them.
[01:01:02.128 --> 01:01:04.129]  He joins us for the next 30 minutes.
[01:01:04.129 --> 01:01:08.051]  Nigel Farage, Rampage of Rudeness is the Guardian headline.
[01:01:08.051 --> 01:01:12.212]  Nigel Farage faces reprimand for calling Herman Van Rompuy wet rag.
[01:01:12.212 --> 01:01:14.393]  London Telegraph.
[01:01:14.393 --> 01:01:18.575]  I would call him even more a horrible, sickening, criminal parasite.
[01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:19.575]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[01:01:19.975 --> 01:01:20.975]  Thank you very much.
[01:01:20.975 --> 01:01:31.080]  And yes, I think given that what people like Van Rompuy are doing is robbing us of our democracy and robbing us of our ability to determine our own futures, I think I was quite moderate, really.
[01:01:31.966 --> 01:01:32.667]  I think you were.
[01:01:32.667 --> 01:01:36.429]  I mean, this guy wants to take 45 trillion from us and give it to himself.
[01:01:36.429 --> 01:01:37.510]  He's unelected.
[01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:39.712]  The whole climate thing has been proven to be a fraud.
[01:01:39.712 --> 01:01:43.114]  I mean, he's heading up a criminal enterprise.
[01:01:43.114 --> 01:01:44.775]  It is extraordinary.
[01:01:44.775 --> 01:01:48.858]  And of course, you know, he's not being put there by any democratic means.
[01:01:48.858 --> 01:01:49.899]  He can't be removed.
[01:01:50.439 --> 01:01:52.201]  By any democratic means.
[01:01:52.201 --> 01:01:58.106]  And he was talking openly on Rumpy this week in Brussels about the move towards world government.
[01:01:58.106 --> 01:01:59.146]  Nothing hidden anymore.
[01:01:59.146 --> 01:02:01.428]  They're not even pretending anymore.
[01:02:01.428 --> 01:02:03.210]  This is what some of these people are pushing for.
[01:02:04.369 --> 01:02:11.711]  Yes, Paul Watson at Prison Planet two days ago wrote another article with multiple quotes of him saying global governance, global government.
[01:02:11.711 --> 01:02:14.072]  I mean, and it's undemocratic.
[01:02:14.072 --> 01:02:17.173]  The Financial Times of London admits it's undemocratic.
[01:02:17.173 --> 01:02:19.614]  England's already under it even though you haven't voted to be part of it.
[01:02:19.614 --> 01:02:20.474]  I mean, when does this end?
[01:02:21.544 --> 01:02:25.649]  Well, you know, some things in life have to get worse before they can get better.
[01:02:25.649 --> 01:02:33.860]  I think the fact that they're being totally open now about their ambitions shows that they think it's in the bag, shows they think they've done the deal.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:34.761]  They're the winners.
[01:02:34.761 --> 01:02:35.582]  It's all over.
[01:02:35.582 --> 01:02:37.244]  And of course, when people get
[01:02:37.965 --> 01:02:40.247]  As arrogant as that.
[01:02:40.247 --> 01:02:42.948]  Then you know the old saying that pride comes before a fall?
[01:02:42.948 --> 01:02:44.069]  It will come!
[01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:49.673]  But, you know, it's difficult to see in the depths of a time like this exactly what the catalyst will be.
[01:02:49.673 --> 01:03:00.340]  But I just know from my travels, from talking to you guys across your side of the pond, I just know there is a growing awareness, a growing feeling amongst tens of millions of people.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.082]  They're beginning to wake up to what's being done to them and it can't go on.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.241]  Well said.
[01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:10.724]  Let's talk about the punishments you're going to undergo.
[01:03:10.724 --> 01:03:12.585]  What can they do to you?
[01:03:12.585 --> 01:03:18.570]  Well, yes, I have got to report to the headmaster's study at midday on Tuesday.
[01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:24.314]  It's also reminiscent of being caught smoking at school, isn't it?
[01:03:24.314 --> 01:03:28.837]  Sent off to take your six of the best whacks or whatever it may be.
[01:03:28.837 --> 01:03:30.298]  I'm going to his office at midday.
[01:03:31.691 --> 01:03:33.232]  At his request, obviously.
[01:03:33.232 --> 01:03:51.190]  I think that over the last couple of days, this has escalated into a diplomatic crisis because the Prime Minister of Belgium, the non-country as I called it, the Prime Minister of Belgium is demanding an apology and demanding that this doesn't ever happen again.
[01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:54.810]  So I think they're going to ask me to apologize.
[01:03:54.810 --> 01:04:03.415]  They don't want you to continue to point out the obvious, that especially Belgium and other nations are fully controlled now by the unelected EU.
[01:04:03.415 --> 01:04:08.779]  You have the unelected Van Rompuy telling you, an elected member of the Parliament, to shut up.
[01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:09.779]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:10.500]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.961]  I mean, that analysis is entirely right.
[01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:17.004]  I am guessing that I'll go and see them next week.
[01:04:17.004 --> 01:04:18.905]  I'll be told to apologize.
[01:04:18.905 --> 01:04:20.266]  I'm going to point-blank refuse.
[01:04:21.343 --> 01:04:22.725]  I have nothing to apologise for.
[01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:26.591]  I mean, telling the truth should not be something for which I have to apologise or confess.
[01:04:26.591 --> 01:04:30.836]  I mean, crikey, we're back to the days of Stalin and the show trials, aren't we?
[01:04:30.836 --> 01:04:34.021]  And I'm guessing they're going to suspend me from the Parliament or something like that.
[01:04:34.021 --> 01:04:34.802]  Well, let them do it.
[01:04:34.802 --> 01:04:35.303]  I don't care.
[01:04:36.052 --> 01:04:42.197]  That'll only draw more attention to this viperous, viperous little demonic creature.
[01:04:42.197 --> 01:04:46.760]  I mean, Von Ruppe, just his whole demeanor, not just his actions, is like Pachari.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:52.585]  I mean, they look like something out of Oliver Twist or something.
[01:04:52.585 --> 01:04:53.365]  Classic villain.
[01:04:53.365 --> 01:04:57.889]  Stay there, Nigel Farage, UK member of the European Union Parliament.
[01:04:57.889 --> 01:04:59.470]  We'll be right back in three short minutes.
[01:05:01.963 --> 01:05:07.290]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:10.054]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:05:10.054 --> 01:05:14.420]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:05:16.783 --> 01:05:19.845]  Order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.
[01:05:19.845 --> 01:05:24.849]  We also have some specials when you get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.

[01:05:36.018 --> 01:05:37.860]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:39.021]  Everybody needs to get it.

[01:05:53.451 --> 01:05:56.694]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:02.469 --> 01:06:05.491]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:05.491 --> 01:06:10.814]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:10.814 --> 01:06:12.855]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:12.855 --> 01:06:17.858]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:17.858 --> 01:06:19.039]  How much do you want?
[01:06:19.039 --> 01:06:20.179]  When do you want it?
[01:06:20.179 --> 01:06:22.060]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.121]  When will you need it?
[01:06:23.121 --> 01:06:25.322]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:25.322 --> 01:06:26.663]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:26.663 --> 01:06:28.204]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:28.204 --> 01:06:28.404]  If there
[01:06:28.404 --> 01:06:30.726]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:06:30.726 --> 01:06:33.449]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:33.449 --> 01:06:37.032]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:37.032 --> 01:06:40.856]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:40.856 --> 01:06:42.097]  How much will you need?
[01:06:42.097 --> 01:06:42.998]  We don't know.
[01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:44.099]  How much do you want?
[01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:45.040]  All you can get.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:45.841]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:46.101 --> 01:06:49.164]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:49.164 --> 01:06:51.406]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:51.406 --> 01:06:52.367]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:01.823 --> 01:07:02.983]  What's your home worth?
[01:07:02.983 --> 01:07:05.104]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:08.145]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:07:08.145 --> 01:07:15.847]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:10.100]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:11.961]  The Climate Conference in Copenhagen
[01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:17.033]  Here's another step towards the global management of our planet.
[01:08:17.033 --> 01:08:22.435]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:22.435 --> 01:08:24.716]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:26.385 --> 01:08:35.488]  The Bilderberg Group documents from their founding meeting in 1954, covered by the BBC a few years ago, reported they wanted to set up the European Union.
[01:08:35.488 --> 01:08:43.131]  They said Hitler had failed to take over militarily, that the European Union would be established and then economically take over the planet.
[01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:48.393]  Now they admit the European Union, unelected, this separate group of bureaucrats that control the nations,
[01:08:49.193 --> 01:08:59.481]  Are now telling the elected members like Nigel Farage from the UK, part of the European Union Parliament, that he can't criticize Herman Van Rompuy and he joins us now.
[01:08:59.481 --> 01:09:04.564]  He's being called in next Tuesday to be chastised.
[01:09:04.564 --> 01:09:15.912]  Recap that, Mr. Farage, and you're saying you're not going to apologize to Van Rompuy or to anyone else and you expect to be suspended and how does that work?
[01:09:15.912 --> 01:09:17.874]  How long will you be out of the Parliament?
[01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:21.529]  It's difficult to tell.
[01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:25.771]  The European Parliament hasn't ever really had to deal with anyone like me.
[01:09:25.771 --> 01:09:32.193]  You've had the odd person that's made a protest because they wanted to get a particular story aired at a moment in time.
[01:09:32.193 --> 01:09:42.157]  But what they've never had in the European Parliament, they've not had a leader of a group in the Parliament who is utterly, implacably opposed in principle
[01:09:42.697 --> 01:09:45.378]  To robbing nation-states of their democracy.
[01:09:45.378 --> 01:09:58.362]  So, in the past, miscreants have been fined two or three days' pay, and the odd person has been suspended for two or three days, but they've never really had anybody who persistently has done this.
[01:09:58.362 --> 01:10:03.604]  I was called in back in December and told that my behaviour was unacceptable.
[01:10:03.604 --> 01:10:08.906]  I called Rumpi and the Foreign Minister, Baroness Ashton, I called them political pygmies.
[01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:14.032]  Which I thought was, again, a very gentle description, really.
[01:10:14.032 --> 01:10:15.674]  But I was told that, oh, no, no, no.
[01:10:15.674 --> 01:10:17.276]  You know, you must never talk like that again.
[01:10:17.276 --> 01:10:19.438]  So I just don't know what they're going to do.
[01:10:19.438 --> 01:10:23.383]  But I would suspect that they'll suspend me for a week or something like that.
[01:10:26.042 --> 01:10:29.483]  Expanding on this, for those that don't know, listening in the U.S.
[01:10:29.483 --> 01:10:46.388]  and around the world, when you talk about the bureaucrats being unelected, absorbing England even though your nation's never been able to vote on this, Lord Monckton and many others yourself have talked about as much as 80% of your laws are not even British laws, they're just bureaucracy handed down.
[01:10:46.388 --> 01:10:48.849]  Obama's now saying he doesn't care if the U.S.
[01:10:48.849 --> 01:10:49.969]  Senate won't ratify
[01:10:50.629 --> 01:10:55.631]  Uh, and won't go along, uh, with the failed treaty, uh, and won't pass this bill.
[01:10:55.631 --> 01:10:57.571]  He's just going to order the bureaucracy to do it.
[01:10:57.571 --> 01:11:03.133]  So this is rule by unelected bureaucracies, but break down the EU model for those that don't understand.
[01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:09.875]  Yeah, the way the EU works is there is a thing called the European Commission, and there are 27 people.
[01:11:09.875 --> 01:11:14.877]  Each is appointed, not elected, but appointed by their own member state.
[01:11:16.059 --> 01:11:17.960]  And by their own country.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.062]  And each of them has a job title and a brief.
[01:11:21.062 --> 01:11:27.526]  So you have, you know, someone in charge of health and someone in charge of EU expansion, etc, etc.
[01:11:27.526 --> 01:11:44.897]  They have beneath them 30,000 bureaucrats and the European Commission has the sole right within the European Union to propose legislation and the sole right to repeal, amend or change legislation.
[01:11:45.623 --> 01:11:58.686]  So, what happens is, the Commission comes up with a law, it gives it to the Parliament, the Parliament messes around with it, the Parliament can delay it a little bit, and then in the end it gets rubber-stamped further down the line by more civil servants.
[01:11:58.686 --> 01:12:08.989]  So everything, the way in which our laws are actually drawn up in the European Commission, the whole process is done entirely in secret.
[01:12:08.989 --> 01:12:11.910]  The relationship, of course, with those Commissioners
[01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:15.611]  And big business is distinctly unhealthy.
[01:12:15.611 --> 01:12:26.693]  And it is a remarkable thing to think that it is the bureaucrats that make law and the parliamentarians that just fiddle around with the implication.
[01:12:26.693 --> 01:12:29.593]  And that, in essence, is the model of this system.
[01:12:29.593 --> 01:12:31.434]  We cannot vote for commissioners.
[01:12:31.434 --> 01:12:33.454]  We cannot remove commissioners.
[01:12:33.454 --> 01:12:38.575]  It is the absolute destruction of democracy and the victory of bureaucracy.
[01:12:39.824 --> 01:12:41.966]  So, here's a cheap analogy.
[01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:43.186]  Tell me if you agree.
[01:12:43.186 --> 01:12:57.096]  They're hanging England and the rest of the former sovereign nations at a hangman's gallows, but you get to decide the color of the rope that is put around your neck.
[01:12:57.096 --> 01:13:04.161]  You get to decide what color a bullet is painted that's put in a handgun and fired into your head.
[01:13:05.402 --> 01:13:09.003]  I don't know where I'm putting you, really.
[01:13:09.003 --> 01:13:11.785]  But yeah, the nation states are disappearing.
[01:13:11.785 --> 01:13:14.285]  And of course, already it's not working.
[01:13:14.285 --> 01:13:21.608]  The last time I came on your show I talked to you about Greece, if you remember, and how Greece was signed up to the single currency and things weren't working.
[01:13:21.608 --> 01:13:28.511]  Well now, this week, we've had a general strike in Greece, we've had the police using tear gas, rubber bullets, all this kind of thing.
[01:13:29.376 --> 01:13:35.317]  And a war of words beginning to break out between Greek politicians and German politicians.
[01:13:35.317 --> 01:13:56.802]  So even as they've kind of put the finishing touches with this recent treaty they got through, as they've got their new president in Van Rompuy, they've got their foreign minister in Ashton, even as it appears that they've succeeded, actually the cracks and contradictions within the system are showing that actually this empire isn't going to last very long.
[01:13:57.236 --> 01:14:06.938]  The inherent tyranny is there for all to see and I see polls in Europe every time a country like France or others gets to vote on some new EU expansion.
[01:14:06.938 --> 01:14:10.219]  They don't normally let nations even have a vote like England and others.
[01:14:10.219 --> 01:14:11.419]  They vote to get out.
[01:14:11.419 --> 01:14:14.380]  They don't want it and I've seen it in Reuters.
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:17.461]  I've seen reports out of Spain and Greece where government officials are saying,
[01:14:17.981 --> 01:14:21.305]  Big banks, just like Iceland, engineered this collapse.
[01:14:21.305 --> 01:14:27.993]  The EU has set it up so that Greece will fully become bankrupt and be completely absorbed into this system.
[01:14:27.993 --> 01:14:35.402]  And you alluded to that when you were chastising and calling Van Rompuy out on the carpet a few days ago.
[01:14:35.402 --> 01:14:36.944]  Here is a quick clip of that.
[01:14:38.635 --> 01:14:50.842]  I sense though that you're competent and capable and dangerous and I have no doubt that it's your intention to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the European nation states.
[01:14:50.842 --> 01:14:56.186]  You appear to have a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation states.
[01:14:56.186 --> 01:15:01.189]  Perhaps that's because you come from Belgium, which of course is pretty much a non-country.
[01:15:03.768 --> 01:15:06.090]  In layman's words, I mean, you're not exaggerating.
[01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:08.672]  This is even in the newspapers all over Europe.
[01:15:08.672 --> 01:15:16.958]  The EU is this predatory bureaucracy, globally setting up carbon taxes, $45 trillion.
[01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:23.882]  You even have fissures within the EU with some of the moral people, the 47-member health board, with
[01:15:24.983 --> 01:15:37.572]  Wolfgang Wodar came on the show and said they found out that the EU and the UN were literally getting money from Big Pharma to all of their heads, bribes, to lie about the swine flu.
[01:15:37.572 --> 01:15:49.200]  So it's just all a giant global corporate system, corporations coming in, banks coming in, and using this government holding company to literally engage in piracy.
[01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:51.386]  Yeah, it all fits together, doesn't it?
[01:15:51.386 --> 01:15:58.633]  Hand in glove, you know, the big businesses, the bureaucrats that have the sole right to make laws, you know, it all fits together.
[01:15:58.633 --> 01:16:01.956]  They're all very happy with the world they're creating.
[01:16:01.956 --> 01:16:11.927]  But the optimistic thing, the optimistic thing is, you know, whatever happens to Greece, you know, at some point in time,
[01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:19.856]  There's going to be a revolution where the Greeks fight and insist to get back their own country and their ability to run it.
[01:16:19.856 --> 01:16:23.279]  This stuff, tyranny, you know, it can be an awful thing.
[01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:25.801]  It can last for years.
[01:16:25.801 --> 01:16:28.143]  But in the end, all these things break up.
[01:16:28.143 --> 01:16:30.444]  And I just, I'm hopeful.
[01:16:30.444 --> 01:16:33.987]  I'm hopeful that people are waking up to this.
[01:16:33.987 --> 01:16:41.833]  And I just don't think that having a single currency for countries as different as Germany and Greece, it can't work.
[01:16:42.393 --> 01:16:45.337]  It just can't work.
[01:16:45.337 --> 01:16:50.864]  They appear to have all the cards at the moment, but we're winning the battle of public opinion and that's just what we've got to do.
[01:16:52.185 --> 01:17:05.954]  Philosophers have said it many different ways, but to paraphrase it, adversity makes men, and easy times makes weak passive people.
[01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:19.864]  And because our ancestors fought so hard in England, the birthplace of the Magna Carta, and in 1776 and 1789 here in the United States, which was the light of liberty for the world, the model against feudalism and all the forms of tyranny and slavery,
[01:17:20.868 --> 01:17:28.699]  People got fat and decadent, now the pendulum swung towards tyranny and it's creating that awakening and that rediscovery of freedom.
[01:17:28.699 --> 01:17:35.749]  And you calling him out, not letting him be the quiet assassin, is devastating them and they look very afraid of you.
[01:17:36.209 --> 01:17:36.650]  Yeah, they are.
[01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:38.171]  They're terrified.
[01:17:38.171 --> 01:17:47.759]  You know, they really are scared because they know that I'm articulating a view that is already held by tens of millions of people across the European countries.
[01:17:47.759 --> 01:17:56.107]  And their real fear, of course, is if we have a proper big debate about these issues, then the numbers who support me will double or treble from where they are now.
[01:17:56.107 --> 01:17:57.568]  So they are scared.
[01:17:57.568 --> 01:17:59.270]  Very, very scared.
[01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.372]  And it's remarkable when you think about it that
[01:18:01.952 --> 01:18:16.180]  But in that Parliament this week, you know, there was the President, there were all the Commissioners, the leaders of the European Socialist groups and all the rest of it, and here's just little me, and yet they're absolutely scared witless.
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:23.284]  So I'm going to go on scaring them, even if I have to have a short holiday away from the Parliament because they suspend me.
[01:18:25.736 --> 01:18:29.137]  Let's talk about his global government comments, because he's really out in the open.
[01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:34.979]  You said this week, and I saw it in the news, he's just spouting off about what they're going to do with our lives and how they rule us.
[01:18:34.979 --> 01:18:38.960]  Specifically, what was Van Rompuy saying about the global government?
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.721]  Van Rompuy spoke, and he firstly talked about the need
[01:18:43.687 --> 01:18:48.551]  Not just for a single currency in Europe, but for a full economic government of Europe.
[01:18:48.551 --> 01:18:50.612]  And that wasn't particularly surprising.
[01:18:50.612 --> 01:18:53.254]  He said similar things to that before.
[01:18:53.254 --> 01:19:02.921]  But what he said was that he was very encouraged by moves that he'd seen through the G20 and elsewhere, which presumably means the United Nations.
[01:19:02.921 --> 01:19:10.566]  He was very encouraged to see that we were now starting to deal with global problems on a global governmental basis.
[01:19:10.566 --> 01:19:11.887]  And by that, of course, he means
[01:19:12.637 --> 01:19:20.861]  Climate change taxes, by that of course he means, you know, attitudes towards ultimately tax and spend.
[01:19:20.861 --> 01:19:33.308]  I mean, this guy, you know, I've never heard, I've never heard anybody inside those EU institutions ever openly talk about world government, talk about global solutions to problems.
[01:19:33.308 --> 01:19:36.129]  It's one of those things that's been talked about in the corridors.
[01:19:36.129 --> 01:19:40.892]  It is now out in the open and it just shows you how mad and dangerous these people are, doesn't it?
[01:19:41.857 --> 01:19:42.958]  They're making their move.
[01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:47.761]  Nigel Farage, UK member of the European Union Parliament, will be with us on the other side.
[01:19:47.761 --> 01:19:50.203]  We'll give you his party's website.
[01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:52.445]  They control the right and the left in England.
[01:19:52.445 --> 01:20:00.351]  This is the only real party that has a chance and is winning seats everywhere and really starting to scare the system.
[01:20:00.351 --> 01:20:00.951]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:02.819 --> 01:20:07.440]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[01:22:02.213 --> 01:22:08.877]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:08.877 --> 01:22:17.003]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:17.003 --> 01:22:25.168]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:25.168 --> 01:22:29.931]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:30.251 --> 01:22:35.475]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:35.475 --> 01:22:39.838]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:39.838 --> 01:22:40.919]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:40.919 --> 01:22:45.423]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:22:50.326 --> 01:22:53.328]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:22:58.733 --> 01:23:06.159]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:23:06.159 --> 01:23:14.326]  I designed our top selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:23:14.326 --> 01:23:17.068]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most
[01:23:20.092 --> 01:23:32.377]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:23:32.377 --> 01:23:36.939]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:23:36.939 --> 01:23:42.761]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:23:42.761 --> 01:23:46.083]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:23:46.383 --> 01:23:49.104]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:49.104 --> 01:23:54.165]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:23:54.165 --> 01:23:57.005]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:57.005 --> 01:23:58.766]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:58.766 --> 01:24:05.547]  Nigel Farage is our guest.
[01:24:05.547 --> 01:24:07.187]  We've got five more minutes left with him.
[01:24:07.187 --> 01:24:08.428]  He's got a book coming out in three weeks.
[01:24:08.428 --> 01:24:09.168]  He'll be back with us.
[01:24:10.615 --> 01:24:18.378]  Von Rumpy deserves to be pulled down, deserves to be insulted, to demystify this unelected scallywag.
[01:24:18.378 --> 01:24:26.901]  But, I mean, was it your tactic to add some insults so it made even more news, so people would actually look at the facts you laid out about him trying to assassinate sovereignty?
[01:24:26.901 --> 01:24:27.441]  A. B.
[01:24:29.422 --> 01:24:38.507]  The next time you get to address him, hopefully you would just bring up that he, I mean I know you have before, that he's unelected, he wants global government, and that his whole carbon system is a fraud.
[01:24:38.507 --> 01:24:42.750]  But I know other members of your party in the parliament are also now exposing him.
[01:24:43.266 --> 01:24:49.309]  Yeah, I mean, to be honest with you, this was the first time he'd appeared before the European Parliament.
[01:24:49.309 --> 01:24:53.271]  And my plan going in was to basically say, who are you?
[01:24:53.271 --> 01:24:54.952]  No one's ever heard of you.
[01:24:54.952 --> 01:24:57.273]  You know, how can you have power?
[01:24:57.273 --> 01:25:02.416]  How can you have a salary that is bigger than the President of the United States of America?
[01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:05.198]  How can you have these 30 staff working for you?
[01:25:05.198 --> 01:25:08.639]  How can you have an incredible tax scheme where you only pay 17% income tax?
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:15.343]  How could you have a five million euro pool of money which you can dip into as and when you like?
[01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:19.385]  So that was my plan, was to say that.
[01:25:19.385 --> 01:25:35.194]  But I listened to his speech and it was so boring, it was so dull, it was limp, it was lifeless, it was just so ghastly that that's where I suddenly thought, well, what I'm going to have to say is, sir, you have all the charisma of a damn brag.
[01:25:35.974 --> 01:25:48.559]  And let's be clear, many countries in Europe have over a 50% income tax, France even higher, but the EU made their own jurisdiction where their ministers and bureaucrats pay 17% or lower, so they're exempt from taxes.
[01:25:48.559 --> 01:25:50.900]  I mean, this is classic textbook tyranny.
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:26:00.744]  Nigel Farage, plug the UK Independence Party website, your strategy across the world to get people to unseat these globalist controlled puppets.
[01:26:01.468 --> 01:26:09.553]  Yeah, I mean, listeners, find out what we're doing, go to UKIP.org, UKIP.org, and you'll find what we're up to.
[01:26:09.553 --> 01:26:11.815]  We are a party that started with nothing.
[01:26:11.815 --> 01:26:21.201]  A few of us in a pub in London, and we've taken that on, and last year we came second across the entire UK in the direct elections to the European Parliament.
[01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:29.146]  And my message to everybody the world over is do not, under any circumstances, vote for people who will give away your libertism rights
[01:26:29.546 --> 01:26:33.891]  Do not vote for people who are supporting the growth of global government.
[01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:38.716]  If it means going for new candidates, if it means going for new parties, do it.
[01:26:38.716 --> 01:26:39.917]  Don't think it's hopeless.
[01:26:39.917 --> 01:26:40.718]  It isn't.
[01:26:40.718 --> 01:26:42.240]  We're proving it can be done.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:47.005]  And when you're doing it, remember that in the end, good will always triumph over tyranny.
[01:26:47.998 --> 01:26:52.700]  And you and many others are the model for others to believe they can have success.
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:59.542]  We've got almost 40 states, it's at 37, 38 now, moving to declare 10th and 9th Amendment power over the federal government.
[01:26:59.542 --> 01:27:03.223]  It's self-seized by foreign banks and government institutions.
[01:27:03.223 --> 01:27:08.325]  And so there is a massive awakening worldwide and all over the planet.
[01:27:08.325 --> 01:27:11.846]  The third world, three months ago, wouldn't sign on at Copenhagen.
[01:27:11.846 --> 01:27:13.026]  They know the scam.
[01:27:13.026 --> 01:27:14.407]  I mean, we've really got the people.
[01:27:14.915 --> 01:27:16.116]  Yeah, the scales are falling.
[01:27:16.116 --> 01:27:18.278]  I mean, they really are, aren't they?
[01:27:18.278 --> 01:27:22.581]  People do not believe or trust their political classes.
[01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:24.183]  They're right not to trust them.
[01:27:24.183 --> 01:27:28.486]  And we're now seeing that moving into active, real politics.
[01:27:28.486 --> 01:27:39.796]  And hey, to a large extent, what I was able to do this week to the President of the European Parliament is living proof that if something's wrong, you've got to get out there, hold your chin up and do things differently and fight hard.
[01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:40.676]  That's what we've done.
[01:27:40.676 --> 01:27:41.717]  We're making progress.
[01:27:41.717 --> 01:27:43.699]  I want others to do so right across the world.
[01:27:44.491 --> 01:27:45.992]  And you hadn't been politically active.
[01:27:45.992 --> 01:27:50.857]  You just saw this and stood up yourself just a few years ago.
[01:27:50.857 --> 01:27:54.900]  And look at all the success you as the progenitor of this have.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:56.121]  I was in business.
[01:27:56.121 --> 01:27:59.945]  I don't come from one of these ruling class families or anything like that.
[01:27:59.945 --> 01:28:04.248]  I was just an ordinary bloke who just felt that something was horribly wrong.
[01:28:04.248 --> 01:28:10.554]  And I felt that if there was nobody out there that was prepared to stand up and say the right things, I'd jolly well do it.
[01:28:11.234 --> 01:28:13.516]  And in doing so, I've met some good people on the way.
[01:28:13.516 --> 01:28:17.280]  People like Lord Monckton, people like Godfrey Bloom, who you've had on your show.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.203]  And you know, there are others out there who felt like me.
[01:28:20.203 --> 01:28:23.385]  So it's been an extraordinary journey.
[01:28:23.385 --> 01:28:24.907]  But I tell you what, we're not finished yet.
[01:28:24.907 --> 01:28:26.088]  We're going to beat the so-and-sos.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.300]  We are.
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:29.522]  If we have the will to stand up and fight, you're a great example.
[01:28:29.522 --> 01:28:32.905]  In the last minute we've got left, an individual website.
[01:28:32.905 --> 01:28:34.266]  How do we support you individually?
[01:28:34.266 --> 01:28:35.847]  We have a lot of listeners in England.
[01:28:35.847 --> 01:28:38.469]  Give out the UK Independence Party website one more time.
[01:28:38.469 --> 01:28:45.054]  Simply go to UKIP.org and you'll see me, you'll see Lord Monckton.
[01:28:45.054 --> 01:28:49.498]  If you dig deeper, you'll see our thoughts on our failing education system in Britain.
[01:28:49.858 --> 01:28:53.581]  You'll see our thoughts on our failing public healthcare system.
[01:28:53.581 --> 01:29:00.386]  You know, we're a party that believes in less government, that believes in small government, that believes in liberty, freedom of the individual.
[01:29:00.386 --> 01:29:01.567]  And they're the things we fight for.
[01:29:01.567 --> 01:29:05.090]  If you look at UKIP.org, you'll see links to all sorts of other things.
[01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:07.872]  You'll see links to my own websites, but that's the first place to look.
[01:29:08.812 --> 01:29:15.439]  And in closing, I saw another BBC article yesterday about the government secretly bringing in foreigners.
[01:29:15.439 --> 01:29:18.222]  And I saw that six, seven years ago with Tony Blair.
[01:29:18.222 --> 01:29:20.525]  I mean, this is a lawless government.
[01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:22.772]  Yeah, I'm afraid.
[01:29:22.772 --> 01:29:27.576]  You know, we are a relatively small country geographically.
[01:29:27.576 --> 01:29:31.519]  Our population is going up at such a rapid rate.
[01:29:31.519 --> 01:29:41.427]  We're projected to go up to 70 million by 2020, where we were quite happily settled at 58 million when Mr Blair came to power in 1997.
[01:29:41.427 --> 01:29:42.908]  We haven't got the roads.
[01:29:42.908 --> 01:29:44.289]  We haven't got the schools.
[01:29:44.289 --> 01:29:45.771]  We haven't got the hospitals.
[01:29:46.812 --> 01:29:48.454]  Nigel Farage?
[01:29:48.454 --> 01:29:49.235]  We're out of time.
[01:29:49.235 --> 01:29:51.178]  Thank you so much, Godspeed, for supporting him.
[01:30:01.769 --> 01:30:08.730]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:08.730 --> 01:30:10.011]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:30:10.011 --> 01:30:10.831]  It's very real.
[01:30:10.831 --> 01:30:13.071]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:30:13.071 --> 01:30:14.732]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:30:14.732 --> 01:30:19.212]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:30:19.212 --> 01:30:21.773]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:30:32.578 --> 01:30:35.401]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:30:35.401 --> 01:30:38.123]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:38.123 --> 01:30:45.289]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:30:49.572 --> 01:30:51.493]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:06.144]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:06.144 --> 01:31:07.045]  Number one.
[01:31:07.045 --> 01:31:10.467]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:10.467 --> 01:31:11.328]  Number two.
[01:31:11.328 --> 01:31:16.231]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:16.231 --> 01:31:16.971]  It's true.
[01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:21.855]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.855 --> 01:31:22.675]  Number three.
[01:31:22.675 --> 01:31:26.257]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:26.257 --> 01:31:29.960]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:30.961]  Number 4.
[01:31:30.961 --> 01:31:33.723]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:33.723 --> 01:31:37.405]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:37.405 --> 01:31:38.186]  Number 5.
[01:31:38.186 --> 01:31:42.329]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:42.329 --> 01:31:47.092]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:47.392 --> 01:31:51.556]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.556 --> 01:31:53.338]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:53.338 --> 01:31:55.600]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.942]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:02.079 --> 01:32:05.081]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:05.081 --> 01:32:10.426]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:10.426 --> 01:32:12.467]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:12.467 --> 01:32:17.471]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:17.471 --> 01:32:18.372]  How much do you want?
[01:32:18.632 --> 01:32:19.753]  When do you want it?
[01:32:19.753 --> 01:32:21.654]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:21.654 --> 01:32:22.715]  When will you need it?
[01:32:22.715 --> 01:32:24.916]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:24.916 --> 01:32:26.257]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:26.257 --> 01:32:27.798]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:27.798 --> 01:32:33.062]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:33.062 --> 01:32:36.644]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:36.644 --> 01:32:40.127]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:40.467 --> 01:32:41.688]  How much will you need?
[01:32:41.688 --> 01:32:42.589]  We don't know.
[01:32:42.589 --> 01:32:43.691]  How much do you want?
[01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:44.632]  All you can get.
[01:32:44.632 --> 01:32:45.713]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:45.713 --> 01:32:48.776]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:48.776 --> 01:32:50.959]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:50.959 --> 01:32:51.980]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:08.047 --> 01:33:13.370]  Next hour, we've got Bob Chapman for your phone calls on the economy and a lot of other issues.
[01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:15.611]  Any topic you want to bring up, he can comment on it.
[01:33:15.611 --> 01:33:17.992]  He's a well-rounded, very informed fellow, as you know.
[01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:33.359]  And then we have the creator of Cryptome.org, really the forerunner of sites like WikiLeaks, who got shut down outside of government by Microsoft for putting up documents, which they admit are their internal documents.
[01:33:33.359 --> 01:33:36.281]  Now they spy on everybody with no warrants for law enforcement.
[01:33:36.994 --> 01:33:40.797]  And let law enforcement into your computer anytime they want with no warrants.
[01:33:40.797 --> 01:33:43.980]  That is coming up in the last hour today.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:55.309]  Now I want to open the phones up now specifically on the fact that they want to try to pass in the Senate, in the next few weeks, the greenhouse gas tax takeover of all levels of society.
[01:33:55.309 --> 01:33:57.831]  Same thing's happening in Europe, outside of the governments.
[01:33:57.831 --> 01:33:58.572]  They're just doing it.
[01:33:59.652 --> 01:34:06.620]  We also need to get into Shell has global government vice president to push climate change propaganda.
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:16.930]  Their climate change officer, their vice president is called a global government, not even governance, global government vice chairman, a vice president.
[01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:20.834]  I mean this is the magnitude of what we're facing here.
[01:34:20.834 --> 01:34:22.195]  Do you realize the level?
[01:34:22.836 --> 01:34:25.878]  I want to get your take on it, how we can stop this.
[01:34:25.878 --> 01:34:27.379]  States are filing suit.
[01:34:27.379 --> 01:34:28.600]  Companies are filing suit.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.281]  Attorney Generals are filing suit.
[01:34:30.281 --> 01:34:31.742]  There's Roxanne
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.981]  Dekicic, I think you pronounce it, EVP, Global Government Relations Shell International.
[01:34:38.981 --> 01:34:42.322]  I mean, it's the corporations that set up the global government.
[01:34:42.322 --> 01:34:42.922]  It's an empire.
[01:34:42.922 --> 01:34:46.903]  They just build a global government, pay off your politicians to sign over your rights.
[01:34:46.903 --> 01:34:50.944]  If they can't get the Congress or the Parliament to do it, they just come into the bureaucracy.
[01:34:50.944 --> 01:34:53.584]  It's total, lawless, corporate takeover.
[01:34:53.584 --> 01:34:55.265]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:34:55.265 --> 01:34:57.285]  It's a global, corporate takeover.
[01:34:57.285 --> 01:35:01.966]  They want socialism to take your wealth and give it to themselves and make you dependent.
[01:35:02.622 --> 01:35:08.435]  Let's play a 30-second clip from a Dutch Royal Shell video press release.
[01:35:08.435 --> 01:35:08.976]  Here it is.
[01:35:08.976 --> 01:35:10.821]  Shell.
[01:35:10.821 --> 01:35:13.046]  Working for a new energy future.
[01:35:14.454 --> 01:35:23.441]  Climate change, energy, and economic recovery are a hugely complex issue, and it will take more than governments alone to solve the problem.
[01:35:23.441 --> 01:35:34.830]  Industry needs to provide expertise, and government needs to step up with solid regulatory frameworks that signal where we need to invest to provide good solutions.
[01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:39.214]  Shell, encouraging dialogue on the energy challenge.
[01:35:39.214 --> 01:35:42.116]  All the major oil companies have run TV ads.
[01:35:42.116 --> 01:35:43.557]  I saw that months ago on CNN.
[01:35:45.285 --> 01:35:50.186]  I saw that, and they just put global government under her like it's no big deal.
[01:35:50.186 --> 01:36:05.610]  They're just introducing it to you, and then they have Time Magazine, Newsweek, the New York Times, and scores of other publications in the last month attacking Alex Jones, this talk show host, by name, saying, I am insane.
[01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:07.510]  Psychology Today had a cover story.
[01:36:08.735 --> 01:36:09.695]  Featured story.
[01:36:09.695 --> 01:36:11.056]  I am insane.
[01:36:11.056 --> 01:36:12.456]  None of this exists.
[01:36:12.456 --> 01:36:25.842]  The New York Times a few months ago had an article about that film, New World Order, saying I was having basically a full schizophrenic event at a hotel believing there were men with black sunglasses in a Leeds meeting.
[01:36:25.842 --> 01:36:36.886]  It was on record they were meeting there, but they think their readers are so stupid, they have such disdain for you, that they sit there and openly announce world government everywhere,
[01:36:37.566 --> 01:36:44.750]  New York Times had an article written by Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the UN, calling for global government, global taxes on everything.
[01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:49.252]  And then separately, the New York Times writes, it doesn't exist.
[01:36:49.252 --> 01:36:54.894]  I am a raving maniac lunatic.
[01:36:54.894 --> 01:36:56.455]  That's what they think of you.
[01:36:56.455 --> 01:36:59.977]  That's who they think you are.
[01:36:59.977 --> 01:37:03.118]  Well, here is the latest internal UN document.
[01:37:03.118 --> 01:37:04.579]  It's in the AP.
[01:37:04.579 --> 01:37:06.060]  Fox News is covering it as well.
[01:37:09.246 --> 01:37:10.707]  Fox News is a little bit schizophrenic.
[01:37:10.707 --> 01:37:12.889]  Glenn Beck says global warming is real now in USA Today.
[01:37:12.889 --> 01:37:16.553]  I guess he thinks that's a different audience.
[01:37:16.553 --> 01:37:27.042]  Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program talks about $45 trillion wealth transfer to the private banks for global government, global governance.
[01:37:27.042 --> 01:37:30.446]  I read part of this article by Paul Watson detailing this earlier.
[01:37:30.446 --> 01:37:32.447]  I'm going to read more of it coming up.
[01:37:32.447 --> 01:37:34.509]  But first, I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:37:34.509 --> 01:37:34.910]  Now listen.
[01:37:36.084 --> 01:37:38.847]  This isn't a game, this isn't a drill, this isn't a joke.
[01:37:38.847 --> 01:37:44.814]  We don't have time to suck our thumbs or play tiddlywinks or play games here.
[01:37:44.814 --> 01:37:50.520]  Now is the time for the people of the world to be warned about what's happening.
[01:37:51.261 --> 01:37:53.882]  The people are ready to hear the truth now.
[01:37:53.882 --> 01:37:56.142]  They're hearing global government being announced everywhere.
[01:37:56.142 --> 01:37:58.683]  People need to know, though, who runs the global government.
[01:37:58.683 --> 01:38:09.286]  Because as the back of this DVD says, endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, for the New World Order, a world government is just the beginning.
[01:38:10.356 --> 01:38:14.819]  Find out where this road leads from their own documents, their own words.
[01:38:14.819 --> 01:38:20.724]  A bare minimum of an 80% world population reduction by 2024.
[01:38:20.724 --> 01:38:26.528]  They are not going to get that without mass extermination, and they try to implement their goals.
[01:38:26.528 --> 01:38:29.350]  They've gotten about 85% of what they want through.
[01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:30.471]  They're a few years behind.
[01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:35.071]  It's just so incredible.
[01:38:35.071 --> 01:38:37.092]  They're poisoning our water supply.
[01:38:37.092 --> 01:38:41.094]  When kangaroos drink fluoridated water that humans drink, they die.
[01:38:41.094 --> 01:38:43.915]  That's ABC News Australia.
[01:38:43.915 --> 01:38:46.917]  When cows drink fluoridated water, they die.
[01:38:46.917 --> 01:38:47.717]  When horses do.
[01:38:47.717 --> 01:38:49.298]  I mean, this is a fact.
[01:38:50.029 --> 01:39:03.038]  You can just go to YouTube and type in, farm animals dying from fluoride water, and it's farmers on the news going, yeah, the city brought in water, municipal water, told us to use that, and my cows are all dying, and I took it to the vet, and they said fluoride!
[01:39:03.038 --> 01:39:06.761]  This kills animals!
[01:39:06.761 --> 01:39:12.265]  They're killing you, that's only one thing they're doing, it's a fact!
[01:39:13.899 --> 01:39:16.540]  In fact, pull up the kangaroos dying from fluoride article.
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:17.160]  ABC News.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.000]  I'll put it on screen for folks that don't believe us.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.441]  And then we posted a link to that article on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:23.441 --> 01:39:27.582]  Scores of comments were linking to other news articles across Europe and the U.S.
[01:39:27.582 --> 01:39:31.103]  where they'll have a drought in Colorado or California.
[01:39:31.103 --> 01:39:33.563]  In two of the cases they link to YouTube videos.
[01:39:33.563 --> 01:39:42.225]  And six months into cows drinking fluoridated water, because the wells dry up and they pipe in municipal, their hair falls out and they start dying.
[01:39:44.699 --> 01:39:49.903]  Almost every woman I know above the age of 35 has their hair falling out, has thyroid problems.
[01:39:49.903 --> 01:39:57.610]  I'll be sitting in restaurants hearing women going, yeah, my doctor says even though I don't eat anything, I'm getting fat and my hair is falling out from something they don't know.
[01:39:57.610 --> 01:40:00.552]  Fluoride hits your thyroid, ladies.
[01:40:00.552 --> 01:40:02.193]  Okay?
[01:40:02.193 --> 01:40:03.695]  You're being murdered.
[01:40:03.695 --> 01:40:05.596]  It reduces your fertility.
[01:40:05.596 --> 01:40:06.997]  It attacks all your organs.
[01:40:06.997 --> 01:40:08.559]  It precipitates in all the bones.
[01:40:10.043 --> 01:40:12.325]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:40:12.325 --> 01:40:16.408]  Get it on DVD today at InfoWars.com.
[01:40:16.408 --> 01:40:22.633]  Buy a DVD burner, buy a hundred blanks, make copies, give them to people, say, you need to watch this!
[01:40:22.633 --> 01:40:25.255]  Fall of the Republic!
[01:40:25.255 --> 01:40:30.399]  It covers the endgame, the environmental takeover, the police state, the banking fraud, everything!
[01:40:31.496 --> 01:40:34.699]  I mean, we need people to see these films!
[01:40:34.699 --> 01:40:40.125]  Shadow Government, Daniel Estelin, and so many others are in this film.
[01:40:40.125 --> 01:40:47.312]  G. Edward Griffin, Catherine Albrecht, great film, we got available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:56.303]  And if you can't afford Fall of the Republic, or the Obama deception, or Endgame, they're on YouTube, they're on Google, on Directors Channels, in one piece.
[01:40:56.303 --> 01:41:00.625]  I mean, if I was going to sit down for two hours and watch something, I'd want the DVD and support he made it, but I don't care!
[01:41:00.625 --> 01:41:04.747]  Just send everybody you know the links, warn them, they're ready to hear the truth!
[01:41:04.747 --> 01:41:06.467]  This is so diabolical!
[01:41:06.467 --> 01:41:08.648]  This is so evil, what's happening!
[01:41:08.648 --> 01:41:11.189]  We need to warn people!
[01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:13.630]  We don't have any future if we don't stop this!
[01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:15.431]  Did you find the kangaroo article?
[01:41:15.431 --> 01:41:16.912]  Kangaroos dying fluoride in Australia?
[01:41:18.134 --> 01:41:22.259]  Kangaroos poisoned by fluoride, ABC News Australia.
[01:41:22.259 --> 01:41:28.385]  Here, just randomly for people, go to YouTube and type in farm animals getting sick from fluoride.
[01:41:28.385 --> 01:41:30.047]  And you'll see local newscasts.
[01:41:30.047 --> 01:41:38.016]  You will see, well I had 25 horses and 19 are dead now and took them to the vet and he said the fluoride was killing them.
[01:41:39.824 --> 01:41:44.367]  But see, it's like all these thousands of kids got sick, hundreds died in China from melamine.
[01:41:44.367 --> 01:41:46.088]  Turns out our kids are drinking melamine over 90%.
[01:41:46.088 --> 01:41:49.691]  That's Associated Press, so the formula has melamine in it.
[01:41:49.691 --> 01:41:54.154]  And so the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, said, you know what?
[01:41:54.154 --> 01:41:55.815]  Melamine's no longer bad for you.
[01:41:55.815 --> 01:41:58.096]  We're going to wave a magic wand.
[01:41:58.096 --> 01:41:59.537]  Abracadabra.
[01:41:59.537 --> 01:42:01.379]  Hadouken and Zuka.
[01:42:01.379 --> 01:42:02.840]  Bababagagaga.
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.161]  Tatupamumupa.
[01:42:04.161 --> 01:42:08.484]  And they waved the thing, the magic wand, and now
[01:42:09.867 --> 01:42:12.309]  Melamine is good!
[01:42:12.309 --> 01:42:16.213]  Doesn't matter if it attacks your liver, your kidneys, every other organ.
[01:42:16.213 --> 01:42:17.514]  Doesn't matter.
[01:42:17.514 --> 01:42:18.595]  It's good.
[01:42:18.595 --> 01:42:19.636]  It's wonderful.
[01:42:19.636 --> 01:42:20.576]  It's fabulous.
[01:42:20.576 --> 01:42:26.542]  Whoa, it's so... And it comes out Mercury isn't the vaccine, so they just put a newscast on saying Mercury is now good for your children's brains.
[01:42:27.458 --> 01:42:28.518]  I've played that over a hundred times.
[01:42:28.518 --> 01:42:29.939]  I'm not going to play it again.
[01:42:29.939 --> 01:42:32.320]  Just search engine the term.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.660]  News says mercury now good for children.
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:39.082]  You'll get newscast all over the country telling you, look, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[01:42:39.082 --> 01:42:41.102]  Mercury's not good for you.
[01:42:41.102 --> 01:42:45.524]  Sodium fluoride and the other derivatives that are in it aren't good for you.
[01:42:45.524 --> 01:42:48.224]  Look, I know that may sound radical to some of you.
[01:42:48.224 --> 01:42:50.305]  Some of you heard the news say mercury's good.
[01:42:50.305 --> 01:42:52.746]  And you may think it's a conspiracy theory that it's bad.
[01:42:52.746 --> 01:42:54.346]  It's bad, okay?
[01:42:54.346 --> 01:42:55.907]  Thousands of studies on mercury.
[01:42:56.826 --> 01:43:02.389]  That's how brainwashed some of you are that you believe Mercury's good for you because the news wouldn't lie to you.
[01:43:02.389 --> 01:43:04.470]  It's like we are living in Alice in Wonderland.
[01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:07.131]  We are living in a matrix of fruitcakes.
[01:43:07.131 --> 01:43:09.152]  Folks, I am sane.
[01:43:09.152 --> 01:43:10.193]  I read the documents.
[01:43:10.193 --> 01:43:10.933]  I do the research.
[01:43:10.933 --> 01:43:11.653]  It's all I do.
[01:43:11.653 --> 01:43:14.275]  It's real!
[01:43:14.275 --> 01:43:16.736]  And some listeners are like, no Alex, we know Mercury and fluoride are bad.
[01:43:16.736 --> 01:43:18.196]  Well, your neighbors sure don't, folks.
[01:43:18.196 --> 01:43:18.977]  They think it's good!
[01:43:21.112 --> 01:43:27.375]  I went to the health food store and suddenly a bunch of the products said mercury on it because they said, well, the news, you know, the government now says mercury is good.
[01:43:27.375 --> 01:43:32.458]  It's now a vitamin.
[01:43:32.458 --> 01:43:34.018]  Andrew in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:43:34.018 --> 01:43:35.219]  Go ahead.
[01:43:35.219 --> 01:43:35.899]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:43:35.899 --> 01:43:36.680]  How you doing?
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.000]  Good.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.301]  Glad to finally talk to you here.
[01:43:39.301 --> 01:43:47.525]  I just wanted to start off by saying that the New World Order is real and it's about time the American people start standing up, opening their eyes and realizing
[01:43:48.269 --> 01:43:50.651]  of the hypocrisy and what's going on out there.
[01:43:50.651 --> 01:43:54.734]  But then they'd have to believe crazy stuff like melamine isn't good for their children.
[01:43:54.734 --> 01:43:58.736]  Yeah, it's a little ridiculous, the lines they're feeding us these days.
[01:43:58.736 --> 01:44:01.838]  Basically, I just wanted to touch on, I had a couple questions for you.
[01:44:01.838 --> 01:44:11.045]  I'll start off, what is the best way for someone like myself, 22 years old, to get involved with spreading the word?
[01:44:12.386 --> 01:44:24.615]  The best thing to do is put up 50 flyers around your town and say, I'm meeting this Sunday or whatever day you pick at the local library for concerned citizens and the name of your town.
[01:44:24.615 --> 01:44:27.998]  And just say, I wanted to get people who are concerned about anything here together.
[01:44:28.857 --> 01:44:39.064]  To talk about what's happening, make a copy of Endgame, give it to each of the 20 people or whatever show up, and say, we need to pick an issue, okay?
[01:44:39.064 --> 01:44:40.785]  Our town is a sanctuary city.
[01:44:40.785 --> 01:44:43.086]  We get arrested if we have one beer and drive.
[01:44:43.086 --> 01:44:46.228]  Illegals can drunk drive and don't have to have insurance or a driver's license.
[01:44:46.228 --> 01:44:49.731]  We need to go to our city council and stop being a sanctuary city.
[01:44:49.731 --> 01:44:50.631]  Or, we need to
[01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:57.720]  Go as a group and educate our sheriff or our police chief about the New World Order.
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:06.992]  Or we need to expose this phony environmental group that wants to stop a coal-powered plant from going in our town that will give us jobs, but then China's getting all the new plants.
[01:45:07.913 --> 01:45:23.829]  I mean, just, you guys decide on a list of one to ten what the most important issues are, pick a name for your group, you know, that sounds mainstream but patriotic, and have your own grassroots organization, and more and more people will get involved, and then pool your resources, vote,
[01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:40.659]  You know, six months in, when you've got 400 members or whatever, vote for who you want to make talk show host, and everybody will give the 400 people $10 a month, and that will pay for you to, say, have a two, three-hour radio show on the local talk station.
[01:45:40.659 --> 01:45:42.440]  You go on the show, and you talk about issues.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:44.241]  You say, come join our group.
[01:45:44.241 --> 01:45:48.223]  Maybe even to fund the group, you start selling particular books and videos.
[01:45:48.223 --> 01:45:49.424]  You've got to fund your operation.
[01:45:49.884 --> 01:45:51.725]  You know, usually revolutionaries rob banks.
[01:45:51.725 --> 01:45:52.366]  We don't do that.
[01:45:52.366 --> 01:45:56.008]  We're counter-revolutionaries against the globalist revolution.
[01:45:56.008 --> 01:45:59.351]  You pick some books and videos you want to sell.
[01:45:59.351 --> 01:46:03.214]  You start a bookstore to fund your operation.
[01:46:03.214 --> 01:46:09.458]  And then a year into it, or even less, you guys decide who wants to run for office.
[01:46:09.458 --> 01:46:16.743]  For mayor, or city council, or school board, or water district, or county commissioners.
[01:46:16.743 --> 01:46:19.185]  And you simply take over the system.
[01:46:21.219 --> 01:46:24.161]  Second question I just wanted to touch on here briefly.
[01:46:24.161 --> 01:46:29.283]  It's well documented that governments use fear as a weapon against people.
[01:46:29.283 --> 01:46:34.065]  Lately I've just been discovering all pretty new to the whole thing that's going on.
[01:46:34.065 --> 01:46:36.246]  I've been listening to a lot of the stuff that you've done.
[01:46:36.246 --> 01:46:38.968]  I'm doing a lot of my own research.
[01:46:38.968 --> 01:46:45.731]  I'm just concerned that some of the things that we're being told is part of that fear.
[01:46:45.731 --> 01:46:47.532]  Do you understand where I'm coming from?
[01:46:49.188 --> 01:47:01.899]  Yes, I understand, Andrew, and I appreciate your call, but I mean, we can overanalyze things all day and just, I don't know if I want to get involved, and there's trolls on the internet and people fighting and, you know, and the government's putting out fear.
[01:47:01.899 --> 01:47:10.066]  I mean, yeah, the government admits they're spying on you without warrants now, so you'll get scared and shut up and hide in your house and just watch television.
[01:47:10.066 --> 01:47:14.930]  You've got to throw caution to the wind, because there's a greater danger in letting this tyranny come to fruition.
[01:47:16.795 --> 01:47:23.898]  The danger is in not taking action or wanting a silver bullet to fix things.
[01:47:23.898 --> 01:47:29.560]  Resistance and action and right purpose is unstoppable.
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:38.103]  Look, I never intended to have a big syndicated radio show, have the most viral films on the internet, have the one and two, the top two biggest alternative news sites.
[01:47:38.103 --> 01:47:39.444]  I never intended that.
[01:47:40.345 --> 01:47:53.996]  I was angry about gun-grabbing and land-grabbing in Austin, Texas, and big government, and so I went and got an AXS TV show, and here we are 14-plus years later.
[01:47:53.996 --> 01:47:55.397]  And look what I've been able to do.
[01:47:55.397 --> 01:47:59.460]  I mean, you just have to... The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:00.461]  Let's go to another caller.
[01:48:00.461 --> 01:48:01.722]  Let's talk to Matt in Illinois.
[01:48:01.722 --> 01:48:03.643]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:04.304]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[01:48:06.391 --> 01:48:14.836]  Index futures, I trade the euro, I trade a lot of things that we've talked about with what the New World Order are going to do, like what Lindsey Williams talked about the other day.
[01:48:14.836 --> 01:48:27.063]  And if the elite really drop the dollar 30% from here, they can't help but bump the euro up like 50% or 30% because of the way the euro and the dollar... Oh, wait a minute!
[01:48:27.063 --> 01:48:29.805]  We saw the euro go down two weeks ago and then the dollar went down.
[01:48:31.996 --> 01:48:34.738]  That's what the G20's meeting for is coordinated.
[01:48:34.738 --> 01:48:41.705]  But yeah, no, they're currency traders themselves, and they know what's going to happen beforehand, so they like to manipulate things up and down to make profit.
[01:48:41.705 --> 01:48:43.406]  And I don't know if Williams is right.
[01:48:43.406 --> 01:48:46.349]  I believe that he talked to this guy, and this elitist believes this.
[01:48:46.349 --> 01:48:48.591]  And most of what the guy said has come true.
[01:48:48.591 --> 01:48:50.793]  Some pretty stunning predictions that did come true.
[01:48:50.793 --> 01:48:57.439]  You know, fuels at $50 a barrel, and then it goes up to $150, so we've got to pay some attention to it.
[01:48:58.390 --> 01:49:10.333]  Well, the thing is, whenever one currency plunges, the yen, the New Zealand dollar, the Australian dollar, it automatically creates this effect where money starts automatically fleeing to other currencies.
[01:49:10.333 --> 01:49:14.954]  So it's very hard to destroy one currency without the other eight major currencies.
[01:49:14.954 --> 01:49:21.495]  Because the stronger currencies can buy whatever's weaker at the time and then make profits with it, I understand.
[01:49:21.495 --> 01:49:27.917]  The problem with the euro right here is, the euro right now, it's still, the euro has actually fallen a lot, but it's still so overvalued
[01:49:28.453 --> 01:49:32.255]  In terms of the European economy has a major export problem.
[01:49:32.255 --> 01:49:33.536]  They don't export.
[01:49:33.536 --> 01:49:37.318]  Portugal, Greece, Spain... They do export!
[01:49:37.318 --> 01:49:39.419]  Taxes and tyranny.
[01:49:39.419 --> 01:49:42.721]  Yeah, but their products... They've been killed.
[01:49:42.721 --> 01:49:45.863]  The New World Order has pumped up their currency for 10 years in Europe.
[01:49:45.863 --> 01:49:47.584]  A lot of it, I think, for racial reasons.
[01:49:47.584 --> 01:49:50.866]  Just because, frankly, money's been flowing.
[01:49:50.866 --> 01:49:52.547]  There's a lot of investors, even in America,
[01:49:53.168 --> 01:49:54.588]  Who buy Euros all day.
[01:49:54.588 --> 01:50:03.070]  I know a lot of wealthy people, 401Ks, who just sit there and just buy European stocks and European... for no reason other than it's Europe and they like buying European things.
[01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:06.211]  But the problem is, that's why they can't export anything.
[01:50:06.211 --> 01:50:12.673]  If the Euro just rises 5-10% from here, Portugal, Greece, Ireland... We got 50 seconds left!
[01:50:12.673 --> 01:50:14.913]  What are you saying is going to happen?
[01:50:14.913 --> 01:50:17.474]  I'm saying they're in their zeal to kill the dollar.
[01:50:18.393 --> 01:50:24.737]  They're going to end up hurting exports more out of Europe because the Euro will just naturally rise a bit.
[01:50:24.737 --> 01:50:25.517]  And then Portugal...
[01:50:27.777 --> 01:50:33.722]  Ireland and these other countries are going to blow up just like Greece right in their face, is what I'm saying.
[01:50:33.722 --> 01:50:38.986]  Yeah, because if their currency rises, then people aren't going to be able to buy their goods, and so that'll hurt their exports.
[01:50:38.986 --> 01:50:40.107]  They don't care.
[01:50:40.107 --> 01:50:43.810]  They're going into the endgame where they want to wreck society.
[01:50:43.810 --> 01:50:45.591]  They want to bankrupt people.
[01:50:45.591 --> 01:50:48.293]  They want to destroy industrial society.
[01:50:48.293 --> 01:50:50.715]  That's the wild card in all of this.
[01:50:50.715 --> 01:50:52.236]  But hey, we're all going to see.
[01:50:52.236 --> 01:50:53.558]  We're going to see if Williams is right.
[01:50:54.218 --> 01:50:56.359]  You know, I'm not saying he's necessarily 100% right.
[01:50:56.359 --> 01:50:57.920]  We're gonna find out together.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:00.721]  We'll be right back with more of your calls, more news, straight ahead.

[01:52:59.196 --> 01:53:03.760]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:09.345]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:09.345 --> 01:53:14.369]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:14.369 --> 01:53:19.954]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:53:19.954 --> 01:53:24.638]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:25.171 --> 01:53:32.274]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:54:18.701 --> 01:54:20.842]  Tons of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:54:20.842 --> 01:54:23.563]  We're having victories against the Globalists, but we have to keep fighting.
[01:54:23.563 --> 01:54:24.583]  They never give up.
[01:54:24.583 --> 01:54:25.783]  We can never give up.
[01:54:25.783 --> 01:54:28.484]  The price is too high.
[01:54:28.484 --> 01:54:30.004]  What we will pay is too dear.
[01:54:30.004 --> 01:54:31.445]  Look what we've already gone through.
[01:54:31.445 --> 01:54:34.206]  America sees, turned into an engine of evil.
[01:54:34.206 --> 01:54:36.026]  It's only going to get worse.
[01:54:36.026 --> 01:54:38.087]  Let's talk to Brian in Ohio.
[01:54:38.087 --> 01:54:41.207]  Brian, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:54:41.207 --> 01:54:42.448]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[01:54:42.448 --> 01:54:42.888]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:44.031 --> 01:54:56.600]  Okay, I was just wondering, after listening to your breakdown of the Joseph Stack situation, I do believe that they want to push us into a revolution, but why do they want to do that, since we obviously outnumber them like we do?
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:06.488]  Yeah, the Joseph Stack situation, all the evidence really points towards false flag, and before the show ends today, I want to get back into that in the last 20 minutes, all the new developments on that front.
[01:55:07.532 --> 01:55:11.823]  Because they can look that peacefully we're beating them on every front.
[01:55:11.823 --> 01:55:16.775]  The flu, the health care, the carbon taxes, and as long as it's peaceful...
[01:55:18.038 --> 01:55:23.340]  They're going to end up losing because they're so unelected, so criminal, so ridiculously corrupt.
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:27.122]  And so, how do you blow up an oil well fire you can't put out?
[01:55:27.122 --> 01:55:28.922]  You use explosives to knock it out.
[01:55:28.922 --> 01:55:31.704]  They want to get an explosive revolution going.
[01:55:31.704 --> 01:55:36.306]  They've got operatives everywhere pushing for it saying, why isn't Alex Jones calling for armed rebellion?
[01:55:36.306 --> 01:55:36.906]  He's a wimp!
[01:55:37.786 --> 01:55:43.511]  And, you know, all these FBI guys, it comes out, who are calling for violence, it turns out, are FBI.
[01:55:43.511 --> 01:55:45.072]  Like Hal Turner and others.
[01:55:45.072 --> 01:55:49.976]  I mean, so many cases in Europe and Australia and England and the US and Canada.
[01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:53.118]  It always comes out decades later that these are operatives.
[01:55:53.118 --> 01:55:55.840]  I mean, that's in some of my first films we expose that.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.383]  And so they want violence so they can paint us as the bad guys.
[01:55:59.383 --> 01:56:05.668]  And the whole Stek thing, again, we're a week into this now, a week and several days, what happened eight days ago.
[01:56:07.012 --> 01:56:15.801]  I don't know, that's just, I wanted your opinion on it, because it seems like, I just heard you break the numbers down before, what, 250 million or 260 million gun owners?
[01:56:15.801 --> 01:56:16.121]  At least 1%.
[01:56:28.615 --> 01:56:32.997]  Well, I mean, even at 1%, that's still a guerrilla war that they can't even think to win.
[01:56:32.997 --> 01:56:41.162]  And that's why they're putting surveillance and tracking and control in, and that's why they want to have it early before everybody wakes up.
[01:56:43.023 --> 01:56:49.487]  Because they intend to try to... Look, look, our criminal government has financed hundreds of overthrows worldwide.
[01:56:49.487 --> 01:56:58.291]  When they have their druthers, they put dictators in over Latin American, Middle East, Central Asian, Southeast Asian, European, Eastern European countries.
[01:56:58.291 --> 01:56:59.872]  They like dictatorship.
[01:56:59.872 --> 01:57:04.514]  They want dictatorship of this global corporate structure worldwide.
[01:57:04.514 --> 01:57:09.277]  They are going to use violence and so they want to have it now rather than later.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.220]  Alright, I see.
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:21.065]  Well, um, I don't mind to keep it as a soft counter-revolution like we're doing now, because just with the amount of people I've woken up in Ohio, it's amazing.
[01:57:21.804 --> 01:57:22.465]  Exactly.
[01:57:22.465 --> 01:57:25.287]  Counter-revolution of info.
[01:57:25.287 --> 01:57:26.288]  We're out in the open.
[01:57:26.288 --> 01:57:27.349]  We're honorable.
[01:57:27.349 --> 01:57:28.330]  We're good.
[01:57:28.330 --> 01:57:31.513]  Anybody meets you at a gun show and says, let's go build pipe bombs.
[01:57:31.513 --> 01:57:33.634]  That guy's a copper and informant.
[01:57:33.634 --> 01:57:36.937]  And they'll talk to a thousand people before they find one mentally ill person.
[01:57:36.937 --> 01:57:38.198]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:57:38.198 --> 01:57:45.845]  I mean, most of these busts I see is they'll go to bars and they have their operatives as bartenders and people going, yeah, we ought to do something to the government.
[01:57:45.845 --> 01:57:47.447]  We ought to shoot some people or something.
[01:57:48.007 --> 01:57:54.932]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me, and I get in their face, follow them out to the parking lot, and it's an unmarked police car.
[01:57:54.932 --> 01:58:02.156]  I mean, it's just, there's no end to the scum and the criminals and the trash that these people have hired.
[01:58:02.156 --> 01:58:12.563]  And so, they're always wanting to have busts of people that were planning violence to create that illusion, and most of the cops aren't corrupt, so the low-level cops here, my gosh, they just stopped the guy that wanted to bomb the police station.
[01:58:12.563 --> 01:58:15.365]  My goodness gracious, there are terrorists everywhere!
[01:58:15.365 --> 01:58:17.927]  I guess we do need to train to take on the American people.

[01:59:57.517 --> 02:00:00.319]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.795 --> 02:00:11.637]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:13.218]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.218 --> 02:00:14.779]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.779 --> 02:00:18.961]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.961 --> 02:00:23.944]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.944 --> 02:00:28.386]  We are into hour number three, and I am feeling good right now.
[02:00:28.386 --> 02:00:32.108]  I gotta tell you, all these reports of people waking up all over the world,
[02:00:33.956 --> 02:00:43.019]  Folks calling out Herman Van Rompuy in the EU Parliament as an unelected pig that he is, a tyrant.
[02:00:43.019 --> 02:00:46.280]  Finding out that Stephen King is a listener and a fan.
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:59.904]  And we're going to have exclusive spoken word, first time you'll ever hear it in the world, with Shooter Jennings' new album on Monday with Stephen King.
[02:00:59.904 --> 02:01:01.964]  You're going to hear that on this show.
[02:01:01.964 --> 02:01:03.185]  We might even get Stephen King.
[02:01:04.042 --> 02:01:05.563]  Shooter sent me the new thing two weeks ago.
[02:01:05.563 --> 02:01:06.984]  I wanted to premiere it here.
[02:01:06.984 --> 02:01:07.945]  He's a big musician.
[02:01:07.945 --> 02:01:08.766]  He plays the crowds like 20,000.
[02:01:08.766 --> 02:01:18.313]  Waylon Jennings' son, Shooter Jennings, and he said, he was calling Rob Dewey, he says, Alex heard it and I was like, oh, I forgot.
[02:01:18.313 --> 02:01:21.075]  It was his great album.
[02:01:21.075 --> 02:01:22.896]  It's amazing.
[02:01:22.896 --> 02:01:23.317]  And I'm like,
[02:01:24.502 --> 02:01:28.363]  Dude, you didn't tell me that Stephen King does spoken word for this whole thing.
[02:01:28.363 --> 02:01:33.245]  It's 14 tracks with like two minute clips of Stephen King talking about the New World Order.
[02:01:33.245 --> 02:01:36.526]  And I called Jennings up and he goes, yeah, that's why I wanted you to hear it.
[02:01:36.526 --> 02:01:38.227]  King's a fan of mine.
[02:01:38.227 --> 02:01:39.868]  And I said, is he like me?
[02:01:39.868 --> 02:01:42.429]  He goes, yeah, no, yeah, he's totally, he's been into this forever.
[02:01:42.429 --> 02:01:43.929]  No, he listens to the show.
[02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:45.330]  Blow me away.
[02:01:45.330 --> 02:01:50.372]  So he's, King's very, very busy and very, very private, but get him on the show.
[02:01:53.117 --> 02:01:55.338]  But wait, this spoken word is him on the show.
[02:01:55.338 --> 02:01:59.501]  I mean, this is going to be premiered here next Monday.
[02:01:59.501 --> 02:02:08.287]  My problem is there's 14 clips and we've got the head guy from Black Genocide who exposes how there's more black people aborted every year in the U.S.
[02:02:08.287 --> 02:02:09.387]  than there are born.
[02:02:09.387 --> 02:02:12.730]  We've got him coming on, but he's on the hour before shooters on.
[02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:20.594]  Have we called the Black Genocide guy to get him to come on at 1230 instead of 1, so I have an hour and a half of shooter?
[02:02:20.594 --> 02:02:25.417]  Because it's like a 14-track thing, so I can play the whole thing!
[02:02:25.417 --> 02:02:27.459]  I mean, if I want.
[02:02:27.459 --> 02:02:35.083]  And when I got that news, I'm like, my gosh, I mean... You're gonna get to hear Stephen King go off on the New World Order.
[02:02:35.083 --> 02:02:35.844]  I mean, this is just...
[02:02:39.622 --> 02:02:41.343]  I'm like a kid in a candy shop here.
[02:02:41.343 --> 02:02:42.184]  I mean, I really am.
[02:02:42.184 --> 02:02:45.647]  And then we got the email, and we called, and it's confirmed.
[02:02:45.647 --> 02:02:53.773]  Big Hollywood star, total anti-New World Order, wants to hook up with me at South by Southwest, and we'll probably get him on the show.
[02:02:57.403 --> 02:02:59.344]  I mean, we're just hitting on all cylinders, folks.
[02:02:59.344 --> 02:03:06.906]  I mean, it's just, we're reaching so many people who are having such a big effect, and all the glory goes to Yahweh.
[02:03:06.906 --> 02:03:09.206]  All the glory goes to my Lord and Savior.
[02:03:09.206 --> 02:03:20.869]  Whatever name you call Him, Jesus Christ, Yahweh, Jehovah, we know who we're talking about, the God of life, the God of wholesomeness, the God of honor and creation and beauty and innocence.
[02:03:20.869 --> 02:03:23.850]  And I am just so filled with
[02:03:26.803 --> 02:03:45.261]  God's Spirit that it is, it's bizarre to still be fleshly and still have all this evil in me, but at my core is good and I don't know how to describe it, the discernment and
[02:03:46.670 --> 02:03:48.850]  People think I'm articulate and charismatic.
[02:03:48.850 --> 02:03:54.571]  I can't even give you one one-thousandth of the understanding I have and what I see.
[02:03:54.571 --> 02:03:56.832]  I know we can defeat this New World Order together.
[02:03:56.832 --> 02:03:58.312]  I know the New World Order will be built.
[02:03:58.312 --> 02:03:59.752]  It will come into fruition.
[02:03:59.752 --> 02:04:04.893]  But from the moment it is finally in complete control, it will start disintegrating.
[02:04:04.893 --> 02:04:07.294]  And it is going to wreck the planet.
[02:04:07.294 --> 02:04:09.894]  It is going to be a hellish war.
[02:04:09.894 --> 02:04:13.535]  But it's a war of the mind and the soul and the heart.
[02:04:16.707 --> 02:04:20.488]  I just realized whatever happens to me and my family, I was on the right side.
[02:04:20.488 --> 02:04:28.530]  That's why the enemy, mainstream media, alternative, all of it, always tries to pull me down, always tries to lie, always tries to say I'm not real.
[02:04:28.530 --> 02:04:34.972]  Because they don't want you to look into the mirror of Alex Jones and see yourself and know that you're real and that you have power.
[02:04:34.972 --> 02:04:37.572]  They want to pull down that idea that there's anything good in the world.
[02:04:37.572 --> 02:04:39.033]  That's what Satan does.
[02:04:39.033 --> 02:04:40.153]  No, there is good in the world.
[02:04:42.045 --> 02:04:48.189]  And even those of you that are turned over to evil and weakness, you can pull away from it if you can still even hear me.
[02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:53.632]  If you haven't hardened your heart, it's not too late to turn around like Saul of Tarsus, the coming Paul.
[02:04:53.632 --> 02:04:57.334]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break with Bob Chappin.
[02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:06.672]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:06.672 --> 02:05:07.593]  Number one.
[02:05:07.593 --> 02:05:11.014]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:11.014 --> 02:05:11.875]  Number two.
[02:05:11.875 --> 02:05:16.757]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:16.757 --> 02:05:17.517]  It's true.
[02:05:17.517 --> 02:05:22.380]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:22.840]  Number three.
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:26.783]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:26.783 --> 02:05:31.506]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:31.506 --> 02:05:34.268]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:34.268 --> 02:05:38.731]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:42.874]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:42.874 --> 02:05:47.638]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:47.918 --> 02:05:52.100]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:53.881]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:53.881 --> 02:05:56.143]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:05:56.143 --> 02:05:58.484]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:07.761]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:07.761 --> 02:06:16.624]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:16.624 --> 02:06:21.245]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:21.245 --> 02:06:32.068]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:32.708 --> 02:06:42.210]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:42.210 --> 02:06:47.652]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:47.652 --> 02:06:55.133]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:55.133 --> 02:06:57.894]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:07:03.027 --> 02:07:07.051]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:07.051 --> 02:07:10.295]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:10.295 --> 02:07:15.080]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:21.486]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:21.486 --> 02:07:23.749]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:24.249 --> 02:07:24.569]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:24.569 --> 02:07:25.069]  Bernanke?
[02:07:25.069 --> 02:07:25.690]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:25.690 --> 02:07:26.410]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:26.410 --> 02:07:28.531]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:43.157 --> 02:07:47.538]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:07:47.538 --> 02:07:50.439]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:07:50.439 --> 02:07:59.542]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:08:03.545 --> 02:08:06.187]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:06.187 --> 02:08:11.491]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.491 --> 02:08:15.613]  We are now into hour number three.
[02:08:15.613 --> 02:08:32.365]  Cryptome.org, around for many, many years, I know more than a decade, the progenitor of sites like Wikileaks that post secret government documents, got an internal manual from Microsoft on how without warrants they just basically spy on everybody.
[02:08:33.809 --> 02:08:39.693]  It made international news three days ago when the site was taken down by Network Solutions and shut down.
[02:08:39.693 --> 02:08:42.395]  They wouldn't even allow them to transfer it.
[02:08:42.395 --> 02:08:44.096]  All hell broke loose.
[02:08:44.096 --> 02:08:46.638]  The internet community, the hacker community got really upset.
[02:08:46.638 --> 02:08:50.941]  Now they've got a message up there that it's been partially turned back on.
[02:08:50.941 --> 02:08:52.142]  That's coming up next hour.
[02:08:52.142 --> 02:08:56.865]  For the next 52 minutes or so, Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com
[02:08:58.286 --> 02:09:24.980]  uh... joins us he really doesn't need any introduction one of the biggest private gold and silver brokers at a time very successful stock trader and one of the biggest newsletters ever until he retired he came back at the international forecaster dot com of course i'm alex jones with info wars dot com and i've got so much i want to talk about with bob chapman today on the economy where he sees the dollar going gold uh... he predicted six months ago that
[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:29.304]  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs trying to bring down Greece and Spain.
[02:09:29.304 --> 02:09:32.807]  It's now in the news that they're engineering this, even in Reuters.
[02:09:32.807 --> 02:09:36.010]  Herman Von Ruppe is running around declaring world government.
[02:09:36.010 --> 02:09:40.075]  Fox News and AP yesterday published a secret UN document.
[02:09:40.635 --> 02:09:45.919]  Calling for global governance, a $45 trillion wealth transfer to private banks.
[02:09:45.919 --> 02:09:58.989]  Gordon Brown publicly, as you know, last week, the head of England, unelected Prime Minister, said that world government is here, a new constitution of the G20, of private banks, that you will pay your taxes to.
[02:09:58.989 --> 02:10:03.213]  Herman Van Rompuy also said that in European Union Parliament earlier this week.
[02:10:03.213 --> 02:10:08.057]  Nigel Farage, European Union Parliament member from England, got in his face about it.
[02:10:08.057 --> 02:10:09.358]  He's now being censured.
[02:10:10.549 --> 02:10:13.231]  Nigel Farage, Rampage of Rudeness.
[02:10:13.231 --> 02:10:14.552]  Yes.
[02:10:14.552 --> 02:10:19.336]  So we're going to talk about this with Bob Chapman and a lot more today.
[02:10:19.336 --> 02:10:21.678]  Bob, good to have you here with us.
[02:10:21.678 --> 02:10:22.239]  Well, thank you.
[02:10:22.239 --> 02:10:23.580]  It's wonderful to be here again.
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:28.905]  And I caught the end of the last hour and it was eloquent and from the heart.
[02:10:28.905 --> 02:10:31.327]  And I applaud you for it.
[02:10:31.327 --> 02:10:34.409]  You never know why you do what you do in life.
[02:10:34.409 --> 02:10:38.793]  And I can't help but think that there's designs for everybody.
[02:10:39.685 --> 02:10:45.252]  Uh, the place that they play, uh, in the time that they're here on Earth.
[02:10:45.252 --> 02:10:53.201]  And I could never really understand myself why, as a newsletter writer, I was so successful.
[02:10:53.201 --> 02:10:56.405]  And all I can say is, his hand's on my shoulder.
[02:10:56.405 --> 02:10:58.808]  Otherwise, I just don't know how I could have done it.
[02:11:00.882 --> 02:11:07.846]  Well, they say the universe bends towards justice, and if we'll just stand up against evil, God'll do the rest.
[02:11:07.846 --> 02:11:10.227]  But it's the simple commitment.
[02:11:10.227 --> 02:11:21.093]  It's like a spiritual decision that you make, and then everything else flows from that, because if you make the right decision in your heart and soul, then you will be guided.
[02:11:21.093 --> 02:11:28.037]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:11:28.037 --> 02:11:29.018]  That's the explanation.
[02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:34.221]  That's the reason.
[02:11:34.221 --> 02:11:35.561]  Bob, there's so much going on.
[02:11:35.561 --> 02:11:53.925]  Let's break down what the global bankers are doing right now, what is transpiring, where the economy is going, the most important info, all the economic numbers as you know, pouring in, that this depression is now deepening, as you said two years ago it would do.
[02:11:53.925 --> 02:11:56.085]  It's incredible.
[02:11:56.085 --> 02:11:59.006]  Well, I think some of the things you touched on
[02:12:00.061 --> 02:12:28.139]  In the introduction to the hour, very salient and important, I think what is going on is that, and I talked about this four or five months ago on the program, I think they are starting to begin to begin the beginning of the phasing in of allowing deflation within the world economy, never mind the United States, to start getting stronger.
[02:12:29.128 --> 02:12:42.531]  And they did that by, for the last nine months or so, reducing what used to be called M3 from a plus 17.4% down to 3 or 4 or 5%.
[02:12:42.531 --> 02:12:53.973]  And that's very important because they're pulling the cookies out of the, off the table and the kids can't have them anymore.
[02:12:53.973 --> 02:12:57.714]  And, as they say on Wall Street, removing the punch bowl.
[02:12:58.357 --> 02:13:13.125]  In layman's terms, over 50 trillion globally that private central banks have stolen from their governments that have been given to them, and now they're just cutting the money off of the people and hoarding it all for themselves.
[02:13:13.125 --> 02:13:15.146]  I think that's a fair statement.
[02:13:15.146 --> 02:13:23.370]  And that's borne out by the drop in loans to small companies, medium-sized companies, and individuals of about 27%.
[02:13:23.370 --> 02:13:27.812]  And the money that they have, they have on
[02:13:29.063 --> 02:13:31.044]  Uh, deposit with the Fed.
[02:13:31.044 --> 02:13:36.726]  The loans I got from the Fed are back at the Fed getting more money than what they paid for them.
[02:13:36.726 --> 02:13:39.868]  And so that's a taxpayer subsidy.
[02:13:39.868 --> 02:13:46.711]  And that that money could get monetized during this process over the next couple of years.
[02:13:46.711 --> 02:13:58.276]  And if you remember, I said, I thought perhaps by the end of the year, or certainly by the end of next year, there could be a large meeting of
[02:13:59.102 --> 02:13:59.642]  I think?
[02:14:17.987 --> 02:14:34.133]  And you said all of that a year ago, you said that months ago, and now three weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago, Australian headline, 24 top central bankers meet in secret, I guess to make the real decisions, and they'll have public rollouts later next month in Canada.
[02:14:34.133 --> 02:14:38.774]  I mean, are you saying it looks like they've now made their decision?
[02:14:38.774 --> 02:14:46.157]  Right, and I think the tip-off was about nine months ago, when maybe almost a year ago, when we saw
[02:14:46.934 --> 02:15:03.788]  The European Central Bank, in particular, lead the way from a plus 11.3 M4, which is the same as M3, down from 12.8% to virtually zero.
[02:15:03.788 --> 02:15:07.130]  In fact, it's below zero right now, a wee bit.
[02:15:07.130 --> 02:15:12.475]  And that was followed by the United States and Great Britain.
[02:15:12.475 --> 02:15:16.538]  And so what they're doing is they're removing a lot of capital from the system.
[02:15:17.421 --> 02:15:19.683]  And the only reason you would do that is twofold.
[02:15:19.683 --> 02:15:23.966]  Number one, if you thought there was going to be hyperinflation, you'd do that.
[02:15:23.966 --> 02:15:26.148]  Or you want to bring the system down.
[02:15:26.148 --> 02:15:29.751]  And I think they're in the process of taking the system down.
[02:15:29.751 --> 02:15:39.038]  And one of the things I've noticed here, and I'll get into how they are going to proceed.
[02:15:39.038 --> 02:15:45.804]  One of the things I noticed is the method that they've taken by taking out Greece as an example,
[02:15:46.664 --> 02:15:58.112]  Anybody who has written about or is a politician in Europe or a businessman in Europe knows that Greece and Italy should have never been in the Eurozone.
[02:15:58.112 --> 02:16:07.199]  There was only 14 members and then they expanded it to 16 out of the 27 nations within the European Union.
[02:16:07.199 --> 02:16:09.621]  So not everybody belongs to the Eurozone.
[02:16:09.621 --> 02:16:11.642]  A lot of people don't know that.
[02:16:11.642 --> 02:16:15.445]  And so I think they have now plucked
[02:16:16.381 --> 02:16:27.324]  Uh, Greece out as the example, because I mentioned in my last issue, which came out on Wednesday, there's 16 countries that are bankrupt.
[02:16:27.324 --> 02:16:31.145]  And I think they're going to herd them all toward the edge.
[02:16:31.145 --> 02:16:41.008]  And then I think they're going to have this meeting I speak of, and I don't know exactly when it's going to be, but it could be anywhere between October and the end of next year.
[02:16:41.008 --> 02:16:45.309]  And the reason I say October is if they were smart,
[02:16:46.021 --> 02:16:59.744]  What they would do would be to have a financial crisis in October so that they could shut down markets, at least temporarily, and not have an election in November in the United States.
[02:16:59.744 --> 02:17:14.188]  And the reason why is all the people who are in the House and the Senate who have been paid off by these Illuminists behind the throne, so to speak, they're all going to get kicked out of office because you've seen the polls.
[02:17:14.955 --> 02:17:15.815]  I mean, they're dreadful.
[02:17:15.815 --> 02:17:19.077]  I mean, the people want everybody out, practically.
[02:17:19.077 --> 02:17:22.778]  And so, if they were smart, they wouldn't have an election.
[02:17:22.778 --> 02:17:26.360]  It would be temporarily put off, probably for two years.
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:38.805]  Alright, I want you to keep walking through this, Bob, but let me throw some things in here that back up what you said seven, eight months ago, that embassies were getting rid of their dollar stocks and moving to other currencies and gold.
[02:17:38.805 --> 02:17:40.486]  We see that being set up.
[02:17:41.386 --> 02:18:02.773]  City Bank over the weekend and it was confirmed on Monday we went to Citibank's website the feds told them to get ready to hold funds for seven days so they can then devalue and hold your money throughout that period and now all the other big banks are announcing that the same thing is being prepared and suddenly Von Ruppe Brown
[02:18:03.936 --> 02:18:11.679]  And all these key globalists, and of all of them, the real leader of the New World Order right now is Gordon Brown, because England's the kingpin of this, for those that don't know.
[02:18:11.679 --> 02:18:20.363]  He said last Friday in a speech, the New World Order is here, global government is here, we're going to have a global constitution by the banks, we're taking over the planet.
[02:18:20.363 --> 02:18:21.864]  We played that on Monday.
[02:18:22.684 --> 02:18:28.107]  So, they clearly, again, bring in the crises, offer the next big solution.
[02:18:28.107 --> 02:18:30.928]  And I agree with you, they're certainly looking at doing this.
[02:18:30.928 --> 02:18:37.151]  I want to walk through how you think they will do it, but first, is there any way to stop them?
[02:18:37.151 --> 02:18:45.975]  And your comments on why they're crowing about this.
[02:18:45.975 --> 02:18:48.336]  Bob's line just dropped, that happens sometimes.
[02:18:48.336 --> 02:18:50.017]  He's outside the United States.
[02:18:50.017 --> 02:18:50.918]  He'll call right back in.
[02:18:51.772 --> 02:18:52.913]  Hello?
[02:18:52.913 --> 02:18:54.533]  Bob, are you back?
[02:18:54.533 --> 02:18:55.874]  I can hear you.
[02:18:55.874 --> 02:18:58.915]  Yeah, you're a line drop to our connection to Genesis.
[02:18:58.915 --> 02:19:00.876]  They're in Minnesota, you're outside the country.
[02:19:00.876 --> 02:19:01.577]  I'm in Austin.
[02:19:01.577 --> 02:19:03.878]  Did you hear my question?
[02:19:03.878 --> 02:19:04.538]  Yes, I did.
[02:19:04.538 --> 02:19:06.239]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:19:06.239 --> 02:19:13.282]  The solution is by getting rid of 95% of the incumbents in Congress.
[02:19:13.282 --> 02:19:15.723]  Even if they're marginally good, get them out.
[02:19:15.723 --> 02:19:19.445]  And the reason why is the new group hasn't been paid off yet.
[02:19:20.257 --> 02:19:37.528]  And if we can get to the new group and get one year out of them, out of the two or more years that they're there, if we can get one year out of them, we can get rid of the Fed, we can get rid of executive orders, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which is under that.
[02:19:37.528 --> 02:19:38.888]  All right, Bob, stay there.
[02:19:38.888 --> 02:19:44.112]  We're going to come back and let you have free reign early rolls instead of being interrupted by cutouts and breaks.
[02:19:44.112 --> 02:19:47.954]  Because what you're saying is, even if politicians aren't perfect,
[02:19:49.079 --> 02:19:50.661]  But they're running against incumbents.
[02:19:50.661 --> 02:19:56.670]  It'll take time to train the new criminals that are being put in and slow down the whole system.
[02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:57.211]  Stay there.
[02:19:57.211 --> 02:20:02.359]  Bob Chapman straight ahead will break down his plan, try to stop these people, and what it's going to look like if we don't stop them.
[02:20:02.802 --> 02:20:06.345]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:20:06.345 --> 02:20:08.628]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:20:08.628 --> 02:20:09.508]  Don't!
[02:20:09.508 --> 02:20:12.932]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:20:12.932 --> 02:20:20.078]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'

[02:20:36.614 --> 02:20:37.795]  Herb K was right.
[02:20:37.795 --> 02:20:40.978]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:40.978 --> 02:20:42.339]  What have you got to lose?

[02:21:47.927 --> 02:21:51.208]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:51.208 --> 02:21:53.308]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:53.308 --> 02:21:54.629]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:13.183 --> 02:22:15.865]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:15.865 --> 02:22:22.251]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:22.251 --> 02:22:27.815]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:27.815 --> 02:22:37.443]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:37.543 --> 02:22:39.884]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:39.884 --> 02:22:41.485]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:41.485 --> 02:22:43.946]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:43.946 --> 02:22:46.067]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:46.067 --> 02:22:51.229]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:51.229 --> 02:22:56.231]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:56.231 --> 02:23:00.332]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:02.475 --> 02:23:08.301]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[02:23:08.301 --> 02:23:13.526]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:23:13.526 --> 02:23:16.389]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:22.155]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[02:23:22.355 --> 02:23:31.518]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[02:23:31.518 --> 02:23:39.001]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.
[02:23:39.121 --> 02:23:39.361]  I think so.
[02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:10.123]  We can rout the New World Order if we get our fightin' spirit.
[02:24:10.123 --> 02:24:14.105]  That fightin' spirit is gettin' fired up.
[02:24:14.105 --> 02:24:16.786]  You have found it, Tip of the Spear, in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:24:16.786 --> 02:24:19.187]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:24:19.187 --> 02:24:25.611]  Let's go ahead and go back to Bob Chapman.
[02:24:25.611 --> 02:24:26.651]  Okay, Bob.
[02:24:26.651 --> 02:24:27.132]  Recap.
[02:24:27.132 --> 02:24:29.373]  Go back to what you were saying.
[02:24:29.373 --> 02:24:32.895]  Run through ways to stop these people, and if we don't stop them, what they're planning to do?
[02:24:32.895 --> 02:24:33.235]  Go ahead.
[02:24:33.982 --> 02:24:40.428]  And I thought your comment was very, very good, and that is the criminal training school.
[02:24:40.428 --> 02:24:48.655]  And so it'll take them six months to a year to get ahold of these people and financially throttle them with money.
[02:24:48.655 --> 02:24:55.941]  And so we've got that window of opportunity if we can execute getting rid of them.
[02:24:55.941 --> 02:24:59.664]  And those things that I spoke about, and probably many others,
[02:25:00.433 --> 02:25:09.716]  Or on the agenda, the reversal of legislation such as the extension of the Patriot Act and things of that sort.
[02:25:09.716 --> 02:25:12.537]  And there's a lot of things to be done.
[02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:27.002]  But, that's why I said, if the Illuminists were smart, they would pull this business of tipping over these 16 countries into bankruptcy in October, but they won't do that.
[02:25:27.645 --> 02:25:44.477]  Because I don't think it fits into their timetable, although they fully realize what we have been able to accomplish through talk radio and in the internet in informing the people, and that's why they really want to do that, is get rid of the people in Congress.
[02:25:44.477 --> 02:25:48.219]  Because they know they're not responding to the wishes at all.
[02:25:48.219 --> 02:25:54.464]  And so, sometime thereafter, and probably over the next year and a quarter or so,
[02:25:55.888 --> 02:26:04.193]  That event will take place where they decide that they're going to have that meeting and they're going to tip them all into bankruptcy.
[02:26:04.193 --> 02:26:21.143]  And the reason they're doing it that way is that all the countries can tell the people of their countries, look, Iceland went under, Latvia went under, Greece and Italy went under, and the United States went under.
[02:26:21.143 --> 02:26:23.364]  So don't look at us like we're different.
[02:26:23.942 --> 02:26:28.846]  I mean, we just did what we were told to do by the other central banks.
[02:26:28.846 --> 02:26:34.550]  And if we don't do what the central banks tell us, it'll be an even worse global depression.
[02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:41.655]  And aren't we lucky these bankers happened to loan us our own money back that they got in the banker bailout worldwide.
[02:26:41.655 --> 02:26:42.896]  Isn't it just so sweet of them?
[02:26:42.896 --> 02:26:45.477]  And they're moving to internet censorship.
[02:26:45.477 --> 02:26:47.359]  They're moving to pass the carbon tax.
[02:26:47.359 --> 02:26:49.400]  They're moving to get the health care takeover.
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:52.963]  They're racing to the finish line because they know people are waking up to them.
[02:26:54.329 --> 02:27:07.700]  And they're not going to get them passed, but more importantly in that particular movement of taking these countries into bankruptcy, is Misery Loves Company.
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:16.607]  And they can, through disinformation and propaganda, befuddle the people who will then think, gee, everybody's doing it so it's okay.
[02:27:16.607 --> 02:27:17.868]  And that's what their plan is.
[02:27:18.410 --> 02:27:22.592]  Well, it's financial terrorism, just like we heard back in October 2008.
[02:27:22.592 --> 02:27:25.794]  You must have the banker bailout, which is really a banker takeover.
[02:27:25.794 --> 02:27:28.075]  We must have this global constitution of the banks.
[02:27:28.075 --> 02:27:29.856]  We're lucky they're here to save us.
[02:27:29.856 --> 02:27:30.837]  I'm Glenn Beck.
[02:27:30.837 --> 02:27:31.897]  We've got to have it.
[02:27:31.897 --> 02:27:32.738]  You can trust me.
[02:27:32.738 --> 02:27:36.020]  Just like I told you in 2008, we need the banker bailout.
[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:38.421]  And anybody that's against it wants depression.
[02:27:38.421 --> 02:27:39.241]  I'm Glenn Beck.
[02:27:39.241 --> 02:27:39.982]  You can trust me.
[02:27:42.284 --> 02:27:44.444]  Well, with his background, I don't know about that.
[02:27:44.444 --> 02:27:47.625]  No, but I mean, look for him to do that.
[02:27:47.625 --> 02:27:51.866]  I'm saying look for him at that key point to pull a Judas Iscariot.
[02:27:51.866 --> 02:27:55.087]  Well, I think he's in that process already.
[02:27:55.087 --> 02:28:03.629]  I read a background around him, and this guy has had a very interesting and somewhat negative life thus far.
[02:28:03.629 --> 02:28:07.069]  And I didn't know it was as bad as it was.
[02:28:07.069 --> 02:28:09.650]  But when I hear to talk about
[02:28:10.605 --> 02:28:11.905]  The losers in society.
[02:28:11.905 --> 02:28:17.167]  We're talking about things that will make American citizens winners.
[02:28:17.167 --> 02:28:21.688]  To get rid of the garbage that's running, not only our country, but our world.
[02:28:21.688 --> 02:28:23.748]  And expose them for what they are.
[02:28:23.748 --> 02:28:29.450]  And bring them to trial, civilly as well as criminally, for the things that they've done.
[02:28:29.450 --> 02:28:34.111]  And so, that's the path I think things are going to take.
[02:28:34.111 --> 02:28:39.112]  And I think we'll have a short period of higher inflation.
[02:28:39.671 --> 02:28:41.292]  Leading into next year.
[02:28:41.292 --> 02:28:42.052]  How high?
[02:28:42.052 --> 02:28:44.414]  I can't anticipate at this time.
[02:28:44.414 --> 02:28:47.656]  I can't really anticipate all of the timing.
[02:28:47.656 --> 02:28:49.837]  I'm guessing as best I can.
[02:28:49.837 --> 02:28:55.520]  But that's what I think that they're up to because they could have taken Greece under 10 years ago.
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:02.024]  I mean, it's always been a cauldron of criminality.
[02:29:02.024 --> 02:29:08.588]  The government, big business, and they really don't have much that they export.
[02:29:09.313 --> 02:29:14.236]  With the exception of the shipping business, and some olive oil, and some other things.
[02:29:14.236 --> 02:29:19.119]  And so, it was easy for them to choose them.
[02:29:19.119 --> 02:29:28.405]  And I think, in the case of Iceland, the negotiations, the people from Iceland walked out on them yesterday.
[02:29:28.405 --> 02:29:37.291]  The British and the Dutch want them to guarantee the money that was lost in the banks, and they're going to have a referendum, and I think the people are going to turn it down anyway.
[02:29:37.813 --> 02:29:45.119]  Let's talk about that on the other side, because Iceland is an example of people saying, no, this could be a model here in the United States.
[02:29:45.119 --> 02:29:49.142]  For those that don't know what happened in Iceland, we'll break it down on the other side.
[02:29:49.142 --> 02:29:52.865]  Stay with us.
[02:29:52.865 --> 02:29:54.246]  We're on the march.
[02:29:54.246 --> 02:29:56.788]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.788 --> 02:29:59.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.293 --> 02:30:07.600]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:10.344]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:30:10.344 --> 02:30:16.012]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:30:17.073 --> 02:30:20.155]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[02:30:20.155 --> 02:30:25.159]  We also have some specials where you can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.

[02:31:02.776 --> 02:31:05.780]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:11.127]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:11.127 --> 02:31:13.170]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:13.170 --> 02:31:18.176]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:18.176 --> 02:31:19.358]  How much do you want?
[02:31:19.358 --> 02:31:20.099]  When do you want it?
[02:31:20.459 --> 02:31:22.340]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:22.340 --> 02:31:23.420]  When will you need it?
[02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:25.621]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:25.621 --> 02:31:26.962]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:26.962 --> 02:31:28.482]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:28.482 --> 02:31:33.764]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:33.764 --> 02:31:37.346]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:37.346 --> 02:31:40.807]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:41.167 --> 02:31:42.388]  How much will you need?
[02:31:42.388 --> 02:31:43.289]  We don't know.
[02:31:43.289 --> 02:31:44.390]  How much do you want?
[02:31:44.390 --> 02:31:45.331]  All you can get.
[02:31:45.331 --> 02:31:46.412]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:46.412 --> 02:31:49.475]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:32:02.113 --> 02:32:03.273]  What's your home worth?
[02:32:03.273 --> 02:32:05.394]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:32:05.394 --> 02:32:08.435]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[02:33:34.324 --> 02:33:37.666]  If you're listening on an AM and FM station out there, stop in traffic.
[02:33:37.666 --> 02:33:38.526]  I do it.
[02:33:38.526 --> 02:33:44.688]  I'll be driving to work and I'll, on Sunday, I'll roll down the window and I'll say, hey, tune into 590 in about 45 minutes.
[02:33:44.688 --> 02:33:46.069]  You don't want to miss this information.
[02:33:46.069 --> 02:33:46.469]  It's key.
[02:33:48.004 --> 02:33:50.667]  I do it at the grocery store.
[02:33:50.667 --> 02:33:52.448]  That's how we get the job done.
[02:33:52.448 --> 02:33:54.790]  Okay, that's just here in Austin.
[02:33:54.790 --> 02:34:00.476]  We're going back to Bob Chapman in a moment and then your phone calls.
[02:34:00.476 --> 02:34:03.478]  They'll be all over the map, but that's fine because Bob can comment on all of it.
[02:34:04.369 --> 02:34:08.332]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:34:08.332 --> 02:34:11.714]  One of them is efoodsdirect.com, the best storable foods company out there.
[02:34:11.714 --> 02:34:18.859]  I bought storable foods from a few other places and it had MSG in it, or was made outside the country, or was 10 years old.
[02:34:18.859 --> 02:34:25.944]  So I did research and found out efoodsdirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group, is the oldest, the biggest, the best, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:34:25.944 --> 02:34:30.347]  They've got ready-made meals, they've got the raw materials, and it's all made.
[02:34:31.047 --> 02:34:32.407]  You know, on a monthly basis.
[02:34:32.407 --> 02:34:42.749]  Brand new, high quality food, lasts more than 10 years in non-climate controlled, I mean in climate controlled, 10 years in non-climate controlled, like in my garage it'll last 10 years.
[02:34:42.749 --> 02:34:44.530]  Really longer if they say 10 years.
[02:34:44.530 --> 02:34:47.370]  efoodsdirect.com, you'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:34:47.370 --> 02:34:49.491]  With all this craziness, you need to get prepared.
[02:34:49.491 --> 02:34:50.911]  efoodsdirect.com.
[02:34:50.911 --> 02:34:51.971]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:34:51.971 --> 02:34:52.011]  800-409-5633.
[02:34:55.925 --> 02:35:09.777]  Also want to tell listeners about FrontSite.com, like the front of your rifle, the premier private firearms training, no drill instructor or tough guy attitude, family fun, handguns, rifles, shotguns, two-day, four-day, five-day training.
[02:35:09.777 --> 02:35:11.479]  It's outside Pahrump, Nevada.
[02:35:11.479 --> 02:35:15.582]  Got great facilities to stay at nearby, or you can find a lot of stuff there on the site.
[02:35:16.323 --> 02:35:19.665]  Videos, audios, a free newsletter, FrontSite.com.
[02:35:19.665 --> 02:35:21.267]  That's FrontSite.com.

[02:35:38.039 --> 02:35:38.999]  Check it out today.
[02:35:38.999 --> 02:35:40.560]  All right, going back to Bob Chapman.
[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:42.282]  Bob, I want to get to calls, but you were getting into
[02:35:43.976 --> 02:35:46.578]  How they're using this crisis they created to get world government.
[02:35:46.578 --> 02:35:53.645]  Gordon Brown, Von Rumpy, these bankers, as you know, they're all over the news bragging, we got even more power out of the banking crisis!
[02:35:53.645 --> 02:35:53.765]  Ah ha!
[02:35:53.765 --> 02:35:55.166]  The world's our oyster!
[02:35:55.166 --> 02:35:57.729]  The world is mine!
[02:35:57.729 --> 02:35:59.450]  Like Tony Montana looking at a blimp.
[02:36:00.071 --> 02:36:20.576]  Flying by saying the world is yours and that music pumping in the background and they're saying in all their press releases out of the crisis world government carbon taxes on everything we have this new secret UN document I want to read some quotes from in a moment I mean they're out in the open doing this and
[02:36:22.256 --> 02:36:24.417]  You're now saying that you're moving up your timeline.
[02:36:24.417 --> 02:36:28.118]  This could happen this year even.
[02:36:28.118 --> 02:36:36.080]  If we don't succeed in having grand juries indict bankers or expose these made-off type people, where do we go from here?
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:41.142]  Well, I think it's going to get pretty nasty because they're going to go right along with their program.
[02:36:41.142 --> 02:36:48.344]  They'll have people in the House and the Senate in the United States, many of them who have been there before, who are totally paid off.
[02:36:49.176 --> 02:36:59.301]  And everything that the bankers and Wall Street and other powerful people behind government want to happen, will happen.
[02:36:59.301 --> 02:37:02.503]  And we'll be enslaved for generations.
[02:37:02.503 --> 02:37:07.806]  It'll be the beginning of the end.
[02:37:07.806 --> 02:37:10.767]  Just like Argentina!
[02:37:10.767 --> 02:37:13.068]  Which is getting worse again.
[02:37:13.068 --> 02:37:17.931]  And they're really in for real trouble again.
[02:37:18.502 --> 02:37:25.145]  It's only been 10 years since their last default and devaluation and it's going to happen again.
[02:37:25.145 --> 02:37:27.287]  And it's the leadership in the country.
[02:37:27.287 --> 02:37:32.529]  They just, the new group, the president and then his wife became president.
[02:37:32.529 --> 02:37:35.191]  They're just looting the country.
[02:37:35.191 --> 02:37:37.572]  It's terrible.
[02:37:37.572 --> 02:37:42.874]  And, you know, Buenos Aires is not the way it used to be.
[02:37:42.874 --> 02:37:45.716]  There's a terrible lot of crime.
[02:37:46.711 --> 02:37:47.952]  Uh, and it's in your face.
[02:37:47.952 --> 02:37:57.260]  Ted Anderson went down there with his wife a few months ago and he said it was like, it was like Blade Runner.
[02:37:57.260 --> 02:38:08.369]  He just said, good looking, these were not drunk homeless people, good looking families with kids in doorways, literally living out of bags just everywhere.
[02:38:08.369 --> 02:38:09.730]  And that's true.
[02:38:09.730 --> 02:38:11.011]  And the crime is everywhere.
[02:38:11.011 --> 02:38:14.354]  Uh, the attitude of the police is Gestapo-like.
[02:38:15.331 --> 02:38:19.013]  And, you know, it's serious.
[02:38:19.013 --> 02:38:24.536]  I mean, I've been there a couple of times here in the last couple of years, and it's a shame.
[02:38:24.536 --> 02:38:29.879]  It's a beautiful city, and it's just a terrible shame.
[02:38:29.879 --> 02:38:31.740]  But they're in for trouble again.
[02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:34.561]  And that's not even in the group of 16.
[02:38:34.561 --> 02:38:39.324]  And, in fact, even in the group of 16, I didn't include Japan.
[02:38:39.324 --> 02:38:43.326]  Now let's go over the 16 nations you say are going belly up.
[02:38:44.401 --> 02:39:12.571]  Okay, we've got the United States, the United Kingdom, we have Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, we have Kazakhstan, which has lots of natural resources, and we've got the Ukraine, and Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, and Poland.
[02:39:14.904 --> 02:39:19.328]  And then we can throw in Japan and Argentina as well.
[02:39:19.328 --> 02:39:26.273]  And there will be some nations that will suffer, but not nearly as much as others.
[02:39:26.273 --> 02:39:35.881]  I think Australia and Canada and Switzerland and Norway will do reasonably well under the circumstances.
[02:39:35.881 --> 02:39:43.728]  And I think a number of countries, even though they're going to have a tremendous drop in exports from their country to others,
[02:39:44.934 --> 02:39:49.037]  I think Asia will do reasonably well, as will Latin America.
[02:39:49.037 --> 02:39:57.623]  One of the reasons why is most of them did not have leveraged loans or leveraged real estate.
[02:39:57.623 --> 02:40:06.430]  You go to most of those countries, people build their houses for cash, and so you don't have this leverage like America.
[02:40:07.535 --> 02:40:09.236]  And to an extent, Canada.
[02:40:09.236 --> 02:40:10.616]  All right, let's go back.
[02:40:10.616 --> 02:40:20.879]  So we have this predatory banking group imploding the world in their own documents by design to consolidate power, going into the next phase of looting and control, bragging, laughing to themselves.
[02:40:20.879 --> 02:40:23.620]  Let's go back to Iceland.
[02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:30.222]  In a nutshell, what happened there and their population saying no?
[02:40:30.222 --> 02:40:36.404]  The use of fractional banking as high as 70 times
[02:40:38.197 --> 02:40:44.282]  Deposits by the banks, when 8 to 10 is normal under fractional banking.
[02:40:44.282 --> 02:40:59.893]  And the collapse of the system, mainly because they made a lot of bad decisions, but particularly with CDOs, the collateralized debt obligation bonds, which came from America, which contain mortgages.
[02:40:59.893 --> 02:41:02.115]  And so the bankers took the country down.
[02:41:03.224 --> 02:41:05.625]  We'll just say simply because of incompetence.
[02:41:05.625 --> 02:41:06.966]  We know it's different.
[02:41:06.966 --> 02:41:13.470]  But anyway, it was the first example of a test by the international bankers.
[02:41:13.470 --> 02:41:28.338]  And now the Netherlands and England want the depositors who are in the banks that had branches from Iceland into those countries, they want to pay back.
[02:41:28.338 --> 02:41:29.859]  Let's be clear!
[02:41:31.499 --> 02:41:55.436]  They're using anti-terror laws in the last year through England and the Dutch to seize people's bank accounts to supposedly pay the national debt which was all made up and Max Keiser was in Iceland and others have that we've had on members of their Parliament with Goldman Sachs people there two years ago
[02:41:57.619 --> 02:41:59.999]  And that's what Max calls them, and Max does a very good job.
[02:41:59.999 --> 02:42:00.900]  I carry his tapes.
[02:42:26.973 --> 02:42:43.201]  Like I carry yours in my publication every week because I want to get the word out by people like yourself and Max that I can't do because I don't have the time and it's wonderful information so it goes in there.
[02:42:43.201 --> 02:42:55.087]  And so they want the people of Iceland, and there's not very many of them, to pay this money back and the negotiations are broken down.
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:57.841]  There's a referendum coming in Iceland.
[02:42:57.841 --> 02:42:59.781]  Do we pay these people or don't we?
[02:42:59.781 --> 02:43:01.922]  And they're going to say, no, we didn't do it.
[02:43:01.922 --> 02:43:03.202]  The bankers did it.
[02:43:03.202 --> 02:43:04.783]  Why should we pay for it?
[02:43:04.783 --> 02:43:17.706]  And even a month ago, the Times of London and other publications reported the bankers are now saying, OK, we didn't know this before, but it turns out our own bank assets in your country will pay back almost all of this.
[02:43:17.706 --> 02:43:19.607]  See, the banks were never even in trouble.
[02:43:20.247 --> 02:43:32.233]  Well, what they want to do besides make sure all of the gang of banksters have the money that they need and the power that they need on the other flip side of that is they want to bring on austerity and that will happen
[02:43:50.862 --> 02:43:52.864]  In fact, they're putting tremendous pressure on Japan right now to
[02:44:07.628 --> 02:44:11.849]  Purchase more treasury securities to make up for what China's not buying.
[02:44:11.849 --> 02:44:18.790]  Well, Bob, I mean, I saw headlines last week with top Harvard professor advises Fed for national austerity.
[02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:20.530]  Everything must go to the bankers.
[02:44:20.530 --> 02:44:23.791]  It looks like they're getting us ready for shock therapy.
[02:44:23.791 --> 02:44:24.931]  That's right.
[02:44:24.931 --> 02:44:28.452]  And that austerity is on its way.
[02:44:28.452 --> 02:44:34.593]  And that's why I think that they're going to finally dip into deflationary depression.
[02:44:37.313 --> 02:44:44.957]  And that's horrible, because that means that once it gets underway, there's no stopping it, and it could last 30, 40, or 50 years.
[02:44:44.957 --> 02:44:50.821]  I mean, last time we had it, it lasted 10 years, during the 1930s, and we had another war.
[02:44:50.821 --> 02:44:53.382]  And that got us out of it.
[02:44:53.382 --> 02:45:02.047]  But this time, I think, with all of the austerity and the financial changes, we'll call them, we're going to have another war.
[02:45:03.038 --> 02:45:05.520]  And if you look at history, it's all there.
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:09.504]  They will do the same thing over again, only this time we're gonna bag them.
[02:45:11.229 --> 02:45:16.975]  And they've got their police state grid in place they think is going to help them carry this out when the people say no.
[02:45:16.975 --> 02:45:20.239]  Here's a InfoWars.net Steve Watson article.
[02:45:20.239 --> 02:45:21.780]  Prominent investor.
[02:45:21.780 --> 02:45:24.103]  Pound could collapse within weeks.
[02:45:24.103 --> 02:45:27.647]  British currency is on the brink according to billionaire financier.
[02:45:27.647 --> 02:45:32.893]  Billionaire financier Jim Rogers has predicted the British pound could completely collapse within weeks.
[02:45:33.433 --> 02:45:36.635]  Well, that's because they're currently long the dollar, short the euro, and they're long gold.
[02:45:36.635 --> 02:45:38.477]  And in Jimmy's case, long commodities as well.
[02:45:38.477 --> 02:45:41.078]  And I do have that piece in tomorrow's issue, incidentally.
[02:46:03.249 --> 02:46:07.433]  Jimmy came out later today and said, I never said that.
[02:46:07.433 --> 02:46:09.014]  But we have the video!
[02:46:09.014 --> 02:46:13.538]  I mean, what is he thinking about?
[02:46:13.538 --> 02:46:15.459]  Well, he has disdain.
[02:46:15.459 --> 02:46:16.700]  He has disdain for the public.
[02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.822]  It's like Glenn Beck says, global warming isn't real.
[02:46:18.822 --> 02:46:22.165]  And then when he talks to a liberal publication, USA Today, oh, I believe it.
[02:46:22.165 --> 02:46:22.985]  It's all real.
[02:46:22.985 --> 02:46:23.586]  It's great.
[02:46:23.586 --> 02:46:24.226]  It's good.
[02:46:24.226 --> 02:46:25.768]  I mean, we need it.
[02:46:25.768 --> 02:46:28.570]  I mean, we need these carbon taxes.
[02:46:28.570 --> 02:46:30.452]  Bob, I want to go to some phone calls here.
[02:46:31.587 --> 02:46:33.888]  And I'm sure it'll be all over the map, but that's fine.
[02:46:33.888 --> 02:46:36.309]  Let's talk to Shanky in Georgia.
[02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:37.850]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:46:37.850 --> 02:46:40.631]  Hey Alex, Bob, thanks for having me on.
[02:46:40.631 --> 02:46:45.973]  Alex, thanks for being positive and delivering such a great message through all this.
[02:46:45.973 --> 02:46:52.735]  And Bob and Max and Webster, I mean, everybody you've got on is just so solid.
[02:46:52.735 --> 02:46:57.477]  And then all the guys you've got doing the writing and posting is really wonderful.
[02:46:57.477 --> 02:46:58.338]  It's very informative.
[02:46:58.338 --> 02:46:59.058]  I really appreciate it.
[02:46:59.973 --> 02:47:00.614]  I don't know.
[02:47:18.439 --> 02:47:21.122]  You know, except these austerity measures.
[02:47:21.122 --> 02:47:27.888]  But my main question for Bob is, and you've kind of discussed it, but Bob, where's all the money going?
[02:47:27.888 --> 02:47:33.193]  I mean, it's so plain and so obvious that we're being robbed blind, our tax dollars being taken from us left and right.
[02:47:33.193 --> 02:47:40.100]  Well, what they do is they engineer crises, they mass all the bailout money, then shut the economy off and then buy everything up in pennies on the dollar.
[02:47:40.100 --> 02:47:40.761]  Very simple, Bob.
[02:47:42.288 --> 02:47:43.229]  Exactly.
[02:47:43.229 --> 02:47:55.037]  And the money, in the case of the larger banks in the United States, and some million-sized banks, is sitting over at the Fed Reserve in the form of a digit on a computer.
[02:47:55.037 --> 02:47:57.478]  And that's what they're doing with the money.
[02:47:57.478 --> 02:47:59.540]  Yeah, for just fake digits.
[02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:03.302]  I mean, for just made-up digits, they get the whole world.
[02:48:03.302 --> 02:48:04.863]  Well, that's what they think.
[02:48:04.863 --> 02:48:08.146]  But we're informing the public of the world.
[02:48:08.146 --> 02:48:10.207]  Alex, not just down the street here.
[02:48:11.006 --> 02:48:15.530]  I mean, you should see the emails I get from everywhere.
[02:48:15.530 --> 02:48:17.272]  We understand what you're saying.
[02:48:17.272 --> 02:48:18.473]  We know this is going on.
[02:48:18.473 --> 02:48:21.276]  We're passing the word through our country.
[02:48:21.276 --> 02:48:27.361]  Whether it's Malaysia was yesterday, Germany was the day before, it's everywhere.
[02:48:27.361 --> 02:48:32.326]  The public is waking up and they're not going to get away with it.
[02:48:32.326 --> 02:48:33.046]  I agree.
[02:48:33.046 --> 02:48:34.227]  Shank, anything else?
[02:48:34.227 --> 02:48:35.889]  Yeah, I agree with the total.
[02:48:36.621 --> 02:48:51.511]  The total deflationary thing that Bob's mentioned, and that we've got to just deflate everything, I was a little bit more hopeful that we would be able to deflate to a point where we could afford to manufacture in this country again and come out of this mess.
[02:48:51.511 --> 02:48:54.453]  But as Dr. Roberts says, we're already sowing deindustrialized.
[02:48:54.453 --> 02:48:56.594]  That's not going to work.
[02:48:56.594 --> 02:48:59.636]  Yeah, but if you set up tariffs, Alex, it'll work.
[02:48:59.636 --> 02:49:03.199]  It'll take a while, but it won't be worthwhile.
[02:49:03.863 --> 02:49:08.886]  For a transnational conglomerate from the United States to make something in China and send it back to Israel.
[02:49:08.886 --> 02:49:16.630]  But that's why they're going to selectively enforce the carbon taxes so we're not allowed to, and then China and India and Mexico don't have to.
[02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:20.792]  They're not going to get them passed.
[02:49:20.792 --> 02:49:21.593]  I have decreed it.
[02:49:22.708 --> 02:49:24.489]  No, I'm guessing that they won't get them passed.
[02:49:24.489 --> 02:49:26.930]  I mean, everything is upside down in Washington.
[02:49:26.930 --> 02:49:28.491]  They're running around like a bunch of chickens.
[02:49:28.491 --> 02:49:29.512]  They got their heads cut off.
[02:49:29.512 --> 02:49:32.233]  And they're buried in the biggest snow in 50 years.
[02:49:32.233 --> 02:49:33.554]  Literally buried.
[02:49:33.554 --> 02:49:38.716]  The government's so corrupt, most of their snow plows are broken down with lazy bureaucrats standing around.
[02:49:38.716 --> 02:49:39.757]  These people are crazy.
[02:49:39.757 --> 02:49:42.998]  I mean, crazy like a fox, but they're going to lose.
[02:49:42.998 --> 02:49:44.739]  Shanky, I appreciate your call.
[02:49:44.739 --> 02:49:45.820]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:47.721]  Alex, the Lord works in strange ways.
[02:49:49.745 --> 02:49:51.647]  That's ridiculous.
[02:49:51.647 --> 02:49:52.728]  And think about Climategate.
[02:49:52.728 --> 02:49:57.411]  They now admit everything's a lie, but they're still going to go ahead with it?
[02:49:57.411 --> 02:50:01.875]  Well, the public is realizing what they're up to.
[02:50:01.875 --> 02:50:05.418]  Again, we've got to keep on doing what we're doing, and we're going to win.
[02:50:05.418 --> 02:50:10.482]  We're on the path, and we have the momentum, and they don't.
[02:50:10.482 --> 02:50:12.303]  Well, I know a lot of people prayed to God
[02:50:13.311 --> 02:50:18.973]  The globalists are trying to play God with all their weather control machines that Bill Gates has patented and using.
[02:50:18.973 --> 02:50:27.155]  We all pray to God that the population be informed about global warming being a fraud.
[02:50:27.155 --> 02:50:30.636]  Look at the snowstorms hitting the whole planet, Bob!
[02:50:30.636 --> 02:50:35.897]  Well, I tried to call Al Gore today and he wouldn't answer the phone.
[02:50:35.897 --> 02:50:37.578]  Just to ask him about global warming.
[02:50:38.962 --> 02:50:39.623]  Stay there, Bob.
[02:50:39.623 --> 02:50:42.625]  We're going to come back and talk to Adam, Kip, Jimmy, Matt, Kyle, and others.
[02:50:42.625 --> 02:50:43.125]  I'll see you, Bob.
[02:50:43.125 --> 02:50:45.047]  You can stay five minutes to the next hour.
[02:50:45.047 --> 02:50:49.870]  Then we've got the founder and head webmaster at Cryptome.org coming up.
[02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:53.213]  They got shut down outside the law.
[02:50:53.213 --> 02:50:54.994]  Government didn't like what they were doing.
[02:50:54.994 --> 02:50:56.715]  Microsoft gave the order.
[02:50:56.715 --> 02:50:57.656]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:57.656 --> 02:50:58.157]  Stay with us.
[02:51:02.688 --> 02:51:06.369]  Money talks, and it sounds just like Jim Cramer.
[02:51:06.369 --> 02:51:07.289]  I'm Cramer.
[02:51:07.289 --> 02:51:12.451]  Money talks, and sometimes it shouts when the results speak for themselves.
[02:51:12.451 --> 02:51:19.253]  Investors worldwide follow Jim Cramer's advice on TV, in books, and on websites like thestreet.com.
[02:51:19.253 --> 02:51:23.735]  And whether the market's up, down, or sideways, Jim's always hunting down a bull market.

[02:52:03.712 --> 02:52:07.733]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:07.733 --> 02:52:10.974]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.974 --> 02:52:12.394]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:13.095 --> 02:52:15.758]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:15.758 --> 02:52:22.164]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:22.164 --> 02:52:27.369]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:27.369 --> 02:52:37.358]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:37.458 --> 02:52:39.799]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:39.799 --> 02:52:41.400]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:43.862]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:43.862 --> 02:52:45.983]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.983 --> 02:52:51.127]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:51.127 --> 02:52:56.130]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:53:04.813 --> 02:53:11.137]  As the economy continues to decline, Patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[02:53:11.137 --> 02:53:13.338]  The world is changing fast.
[02:53:13.338 --> 02:53:15.599]  Are you fully prepared?
[02:53:15.599 --> 02:53:18.781]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[02:53:18.781 --> 02:53:29.508]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.

[02:53:40.856 --> 02:53:45.719]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[02:53:45.719 --> 02:53:50.323]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[02:53:50.323 --> 02:53:53.265]  Food insurance, just in case.
[02:53:53.265 --> 02:53:57.889]  Owned by me, Big John Lipston, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[02:54:05.595 --> 02:54:08.959]  Bob will be with us in another five minutes or the next hour.
[02:54:08.959 --> 02:54:09.579]  Leaked U.N.
[02:54:09.579 --> 02:54:13.864]  documents reveal plan for Green World Order by 2012.
[02:54:13.864 --> 02:54:16.047]  Here's the actual U.N.
[02:54:16.047 --> 02:54:18.910]  document.
[02:54:18.910 --> 02:54:20.832]  And that's the actual Jimmy Vaughn plan.
[02:54:20.832 --> 02:54:24.136]  Another great patriot.
[02:54:24.136 --> 02:54:25.517]  Now add Stephen King to the list.
[02:54:29.278 --> 02:54:48.023]  But reading this, it says, Green World Order, the capstone of which will be carbon taxes, focus political document, calling for a radical redistribution of 45 transfer, 45 trillion transfer of wealth from richer nations.
[02:54:48.023 --> 02:54:51.304]  These are quotes from this internal UN plan.
[02:54:51.304 --> 02:54:58.366]  I mean, this is just out, this is like having the document of people planning to rob the bank down the street and no one gets in trouble.
[02:54:59.307 --> 02:55:02.188]  It's just incredible.
[02:55:02.188 --> 02:55:03.489]  Let's go to Adam in Texas.
[02:55:03.489 --> 02:55:04.609]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:55:04.609 --> 02:55:04.950]  Go ahead.
[02:55:04.950 --> 02:55:06.510]  Hey there, Alex.
[02:55:06.510 --> 02:55:07.211]  Mr. Chapman.
[02:55:07.211 --> 02:55:10.012]  It's a privilege to speak with both of you.
[02:55:10.012 --> 02:55:13.553]  I'm going to be off the map here, and I apologize for that, but I'll be brief.
[02:55:13.553 --> 02:55:19.476]  Time is of the essence here in Texas, and I'll be the first to say that it was an atrocious thing that Ms.
[02:55:19.476 --> 02:55:21.277]  Medina did.
[02:55:21.277 --> 02:55:23.958]  Certainly, I think, took advantage of your platform just a bit.
[02:55:24.688 --> 02:55:28.389]  I was really ticked off about that, but I kind of went through a progression.
[02:55:28.389 --> 02:55:35.250]  I'd like to get your thoughts on this and maybe appeal to your sense of perspective and purpose in all this mess.
[02:55:35.250 --> 02:55:43.892]  Chapman said, you know, the best thing we can do at this point is, you know, bring people back home to their own political office right now, and I think that's where we need to start here in Texas.
[02:55:43.892 --> 02:55:46.573]  So if you go through the progression, that's what Mrs. Medina did.
[02:55:47.950 --> 02:55:49.351]  Certainly a blow to my heart.
[02:55:49.351 --> 02:55:53.835]  Like I said, I was very ticked off, but I'm just curious, you know, what's the other option?
[02:55:53.835 --> 02:55:57.458]  Let me say something here and then we'll get Bob's take on it, okay?
[02:55:57.458 --> 02:56:05.345]  For those that just tuned in, other parts of the country and the world, a contested primary for the Republican Party nomination for governor in Texas.
[02:56:05.345 --> 02:56:10.990]  Deborah Medina comes out, goes on Glenn Beck, says people have a right to question 9-11.
[02:56:10.990 --> 02:56:13.132]  She loses about five, six points in the polls.
[02:56:14.198 --> 02:56:18.484]  Does a bunch of other interviews saying it's healthy, it's good to question, people have a right.
[02:56:18.484 --> 02:56:25.895]  Then she went on Dallas Radio and agreed that it was despicable and horrible and that 9-11 truth is a cult.
[02:56:25.895 --> 02:56:29.781]  And then of course I told you her people would misrepresent and unfortunately some of them did.
[02:56:30.602 --> 02:56:34.203]  Uh, that I was saying she's bad because she's not 9-11 Truth.
[02:56:34.203 --> 02:56:40.846]  And I said over and over again, that's not the issue, but that's how deception works, which makes me more concerned, frankly, about her campaign.
[02:56:40.846 --> 02:56:42.346]  No, I said we need a response.
[02:56:42.346 --> 02:56:48.148]  And we're four days into this, no response to 9-11 Truth about how we're suddenly despicable.
[02:56:48.148 --> 02:56:55.191]  It's the flip-flop from we're healthy and good, that's a quote, to we're now despicable, and
[02:56:55.931 --> 02:56:59.453]  But certainly, I said yesterday, I said today, go ahead and vote for Medina.
[02:56:59.453 --> 02:57:01.233]  I don't think she's a bad person.
[02:57:01.233 --> 02:57:09.057]  I agree with a lot of things she's saying, but I have a right to be hurt and to say that's wrong, and will you flip-flap on other things?
[02:57:09.057 --> 02:57:11.237]  Bob Chapman?
[02:57:11.237 --> 02:57:13.418]  I think you've covered it.
[02:57:13.418 --> 02:57:21.762]  I think it is the way you've said it is, and she's not everything that you'd want her to be, but she's certainly better than the other two.
[02:57:22.915 --> 02:57:28.316]  Yeah, I just don't like this lesser of two evil things when somebody says, I'm a rock.
[02:57:28.316 --> 02:57:31.037]  When I say something, that's the way it is.
[02:57:31.037 --> 02:57:37.918]  And it was the enjoyment of, are they just, you know, despicable cult of dangerous scum?
[02:57:37.918 --> 02:57:42.159]  Absolutely, absolutely, Mark Davis.
[02:57:42.159 --> 02:57:47.620]  I agree, it's ridiculous that I would even imagine to be involved with those people.
[02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:51.422]  And then I'm like, my God, what a betrayal!
[02:57:51.422 --> 02:57:55.205]  And 99% of the emails and calls we've gotten are people totally agree.
[02:57:55.205 --> 02:57:56.385]  But I've moved on.
[02:57:56.385 --> 02:57:58.247]  I just said yesterday, go ahead and vote for us.
[02:57:58.247 --> 02:57:59.808]  And today, go ahead and vote for her.
[02:57:59.808 --> 02:58:02.429]  But now I don't have a good feeling.
[02:58:02.429 --> 02:58:03.150]  I mean, I'll tell you that.
[02:58:03.150 --> 02:58:05.631]  But we know what Kay Bailey and Perry are.
[02:58:05.631 --> 02:58:07.293]  I mean, we know they're devils.
[02:58:07.293 --> 02:58:10.775]  And with your logic, that's really my logic, of
[02:58:12.378 --> 02:58:17.859]  Even if somebody's new, and it takes a while for them to politically break them, that will give us some time.
[02:58:17.859 --> 02:58:21.019]  And maybe it'll turn out if she was elected governor that it was the real deal.
[02:58:21.019 --> 02:58:29.481]  The thing is, the Beck situation lost her, depending on the poll, 5 to 10 points she would have gained, and 5 to 8 points she had.
[02:58:29.481 --> 02:58:30.261]  They're different polls.
[02:58:30.261 --> 02:58:35.282]  So she lost, any way you slice it, 10 points with her Beck thing.
[02:58:35.282 --> 02:58:39.983]  Not because of 9-11 Truth, but the flip-flopping that day coming out.
[02:58:39.983 --> 02:58:41.303]  I mean, it's bad news.
[02:58:44.025 --> 02:58:47.492]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:59:57.841 --> 03:00:00.624]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:10.509 --> 03:00:13.210]  It's hour number four.
[03:00:13.210 --> 03:00:14.110]  Final hour.
[03:00:14.110 --> 03:00:19.292]  Founder of Cryptome.org coming up.
[03:00:19.292 --> 03:00:24.293]  Big defenders of the First Amendment and the Internet tied into the Electronic Frontiers Foundation.
[03:00:24.293 --> 03:00:25.674]  Let's talk to Kip in Illinois.
[03:00:25.674 --> 03:00:26.874]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[03:00:26.874 --> 03:00:27.254]  Go ahead.
[03:00:27.254 --> 03:00:31.816]  It's great to talk to you and Bob.
[03:00:31.816 --> 03:00:38.218]  I support everything you guys are doing and I commend Nigel for standing up and speaking out against Von Humphrey.
[03:00:39.286 --> 03:00:40.166]  Von Poopy?
[03:00:40.166 --> 03:00:41.027]  Herman Von Poopy?
[03:00:41.027 --> 03:00:41.267]  Yes.
[03:00:41.267 --> 03:00:42.987]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I meant.
[03:00:42.987 --> 03:00:58.933]  But, uh, I picked up the paper this morning and, uh, I was reading it and one of our representatives is proposing a bill to criminally charge people for using radio scanners to monitor police and emergency frequencies and they claim, oh, it's just to monitor the bad guys.
[03:00:58.933 --> 03:01:06.496]  None of the media or anybody who listens at home will be affected by it, but it was just something that blew my mind to see that in my own paper.
[03:01:07.554 --> 03:01:09.855]  Well, your phone's breaking up a little bit, but I appreciate your call.
[03:01:09.855 --> 03:01:12.416]  Did you understand what he was saying, Bob?
[03:01:12.416 --> 03:01:15.118]  Perfectly, and I agree with him.
[03:01:15.118 --> 03:01:29.264]  And for several years, when I lived in the Los Angeles area, I used to monitor the calls as well, because we had the Watts riots in 1964, and that's when it started.
[03:01:29.264 --> 03:01:32.886]  Because, you know, you want to know what's going on, particularly if it's in your neighborhood.
[03:01:33.633 --> 03:01:42.447]  And we knew all the police calls and everything, and there was nothing that we did other than listen to try to protect ourselves.
[03:01:42.447 --> 03:01:45.872]  And I think that sort of thing is wrong.
[03:01:46.661 --> 03:01:51.404]  To have legislation that keeps you from listening to what the police are talking about.
[03:01:51.404 --> 03:01:52.905]  Well, it's worse than that.
[03:01:52.905 --> 03:02:00.531]  I mean, Oklahoma passed a law where you can't put burglar bars on your house because the government, I guess, wants the criminals to get in so they can get in.
[03:02:00.531 --> 03:02:03.313]  You can't even fortify your house with more than three locks on the door.
[03:02:03.313 --> 03:02:09.017]  I mean, imagine criminals running government and what they would do, and that's everything they're doing.
[03:02:09.017 --> 03:02:13.060]  Let's jam in one more, then we're going to plug the International Forecaster for folks out there.
[03:02:13.060 --> 03:02:15.381]  Let's talk to Jimmy in Arizona.
[03:02:15.381 --> 03:02:15.902]  You're on the air.
[03:02:17.286 --> 03:02:18.406]  It's a great show.
[03:02:18.406 --> 03:02:26.468]  Hey Bob, I was wondering if you could comment on the allegations that came out earlier this week that Alex Jones is a phony who can't handle his money.
[03:02:26.468 --> 03:02:28.368]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:02:28.368 --> 03:02:29.888]  You guys are pathetic.
[03:02:29.888 --> 03:02:37.090]  And the more Hollywood stars we get on, the more, and we play the Stephen King stuff next week, you'll just get more jealous and make up whatever you want about me.
[03:02:37.090 --> 03:02:37.950]  I love it.
[03:02:37.950 --> 03:02:38.330]  Okay?
[03:02:38.330 --> 03:02:41.470]  Keep sending me any five listeners you've got.
[03:02:41.470 --> 03:02:43.631]  I love it and I appreciate your call, Jimmy.
[03:02:44.711 --> 03:02:46.051]  Bob, you've talked about this before.
[03:02:46.051 --> 03:02:54.694]  When somebody's number one, which you've been number one in your field, I mean, it's almost like a soap opera, the new lies that get told the next week, isn't it?
[03:02:54.694 --> 03:02:55.254]  That's right.
[03:02:55.254 --> 03:02:58.835]  They want to knock you down, no matter who you are.
[03:02:58.835 --> 03:03:03.656]  They want to be first, and they can't be, and they're jealous.
[03:03:03.656 --> 03:03:13.279]  It's a terrible thing, and I've seen it over and over in my lifetime, and it makes me very unhappy that human nature can be that way.
[03:03:14.208 --> 03:03:22.992]  You would think if people are doing something right and helping other people, that it would be looked on kindly.
[03:03:22.992 --> 03:03:28.815]  Unfortunately, there are those people out there who are malcontent, and that's okay.
[03:03:28.815 --> 03:03:30.296]  God made us all different.
[03:03:30.296 --> 03:03:32.277]  Well, Bob, I made mistakes early on.
[03:03:32.277 --> 03:03:34.178]  I was way too trusting.
[03:03:34.178 --> 03:03:36.839]  And parasites, grifters, people with fake names, crooks.
[03:03:38.797 --> 03:03:39.097]  I don't know.
[03:03:56.417 --> 03:03:58.258]  All the fraud, all of it.
[03:03:58.258 --> 03:04:04.202]  I trust in God, and every time I get persecuted, suddenly it's as if the streets are paved in gold for me.
[03:04:04.202 --> 03:04:08.986]  All these other doors open, and I just trust in God 110%.
[03:04:08.986 --> 03:04:10.887]  Bob, tell folks about International Forecaster.
[03:04:10.887 --> 03:04:12.988]  Think of internationalforecaster.com.
[03:04:12.988 --> 03:04:15.430]  And do you have that number where they can call and get a free copy?
[03:04:15.430 --> 03:04:17.691]  A sample hard copy?
[03:04:17.691 --> 03:04:18.512]  I certainly do.
[03:04:18.512 --> 03:04:18.732]  That's 877-479-8178.
[03:04:23.433 --> 03:04:27.735]  Toll free, 877-479-8178.
[03:04:27.735 --> 03:04:30.637]  Free copy, either by email or hard copy.
[03:04:30.637 --> 03:04:38.961]  Current copy, and if you want to, you can go to the site, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:04:38.961 --> 03:04:40.962]  Absolutely.
[03:04:40.962 --> 03:04:44.524]  TheInternationalForecaster.com, and my website's Infowars.com.
[03:04:44.524 --> 03:04:46.525]  Bob, always look forward to seeing you.
[03:04:46.525 --> 03:04:50.007]  We'll see you here live again with us, God willing, next Friday.
[03:04:50.007 --> 03:04:50.848]  Godspeed, my friend.
[03:04:51.707 --> 03:04:54.109]  Thank you and thank you all for listening.
[03:04:54.109 --> 03:04:58.452]  We're going to defend the First Amendment and the Internet straight ahead, right here on GCN.
[03:05:02.343 --> 03:05:06.884]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:06.884 --> 03:05:07.805]  Number one.
[03:05:07.805 --> 03:05:11.226]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:11.226 --> 03:05:12.086]  Number two.
[03:05:12.086 --> 03:05:16.967]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:16.967 --> 03:05:17.707]  It's true.
[03:05:17.707 --> 03:05:22.589]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:22.589 --> 03:05:23.409]  Number three.
[03:05:23.409 --> 03:05:26.990]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:26.990 --> 03:05:30.711]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:30.911 --> 03:05:31.712]  Number 4.
[03:05:31.712 --> 03:05:34.474]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:34.474 --> 03:05:38.157]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:38.157 --> 03:05:38.938]  Number 5.
[03:05:38.938 --> 03:05:43.082]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:43.082 --> 03:05:47.846]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:05:48.126 --> 03:05:52.310]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:06:02.864 --> 03:06:05.866]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:05.866 --> 03:06:11.191]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:11.191 --> 03:06:13.252]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:13.252 --> 03:06:18.236]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:18.236 --> 03:06:19.157]  How much do you want?
[03:06:19.417 --> 03:06:20.538]  When do you want it?
[03:06:20.538 --> 03:06:22.440]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:22.440 --> 03:06:23.500]  When will you need it?
[03:06:23.500 --> 03:06:25.702]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:25.702 --> 03:06:27.043]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:27.043 --> 03:06:28.565]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:28.565 --> 03:06:33.849]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:33.849 --> 03:06:37.432]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:37.432 --> 03:06:40.895]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:41.235 --> 03:06:42.456]  How much will you need?
[03:06:42.456 --> 03:06:43.357]  We don't know.
[03:06:43.357 --> 03:06:44.458]  How much do you want?
[03:06:44.458 --> 03:06:45.399]  All you can get.
[03:06:45.399 --> 03:06:46.500]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:46.500 --> 03:06:49.543]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:49.543 --> 03:06:51.325]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:51.325 --> 03:06:52.245]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:03.317 --> 03:07:10.021]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:07:10.021 --> 03:07:16.424]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:07:16.424 --> 03:07:22.747]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:07:22.747 --> 03:07:27.650]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:36.298]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:07:36.298 --> 03:07:40.903]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[03:07:40.903 --> 03:07:44.626]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:07:45.487 --> 03:07:45.727]  Big Brother.
[03:08:08.812 --> 03:08:10.574]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:10.574 --> 03:08:12.335]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:12.335 --> 03:08:13.916]  You want answers?
[03:08:13.916 --> 03:08:14.877]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.877 --> 03:08:19.661]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.661 --> 03:08:23.704]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:25.043 --> 03:08:28.266]  John Young is the founder of Cryptome.
[03:08:28.266 --> 03:08:34.211]  New York-based architect is better known as one of the net's most ardent foes of government secrecy.
[03:08:34.211 --> 03:08:41.277]  William Arkin, Washington Post columnist and NBC News military analyst, calls Cryptome the Google of national security.
[03:08:41.277 --> 03:08:44.680]  There are high-resolution satellite photos of the President Bush's Crawford Ranch.
[03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:45.420]  Technical documents?
[03:08:46.241 --> 03:08:49.704]  Detailing how the National Security Agency spies on computer traffic.
[03:08:49.704 --> 03:08:56.409]  Even the home addresses and telephone numbers of government officials, including former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte.
[03:08:56.409 --> 03:09:04.715]  This is truly an amazing hodgepodge of information and fascinating background to a man whose single-minded focus is government security.
[03:09:04.715 --> 03:09:05.776]  Cryptome.org.
[03:09:05.776 --> 03:09:15.163]  Now, it's all over the Washington Post, AP, PC World, CNET News, Microsoft Relents, Cryptome Returns.
[03:09:16.506 --> 03:09:43.273]  Microsoft Action Hits Cryptome Website, Shut It Down, Microsoft Backs Down Over Online Spy Guide, this just happened yesterday, Microsoft Drops Cryptome Spy Document Fight, Microsoft Brings Down Whistleblower Site After Spy Guide Leak, Whistleblower Website Is Back Online, IT Business, on and on and on with Microsoft and how they spy on people without warrants.
[03:09:44.946 --> 03:09:46.727]  This is the progenitor of Wikilinks.
[03:09:46.727 --> 03:09:51.088]  This is a guy involved in helping set up the Electronic Frontiers Foundation.
[03:09:51.088 --> 03:10:00.292]  So much an icon in defending the free web, the front lines of the info war, and we need to support Cryptome.org.
[03:10:00.292 --> 03:10:02.492]  Good to have you on with us, John Young.
[03:10:02.492 --> 03:10:03.173]  Thank you for coming on.
[03:10:03.173 --> 03:10:04.153]  It's a pleasure, Alex.
[03:10:07.099 --> 03:10:09.722]  We set up the site in 1996 to publish documents that the government doesn't want published.
[03:10:31.054 --> 03:10:32.415]  That's its only purpose.
[03:10:32.415 --> 03:10:37.999]  And so we sit and wait for the documents to show up, and people send us stuff, and have been sending us stuff.
[03:10:37.999 --> 03:10:54.351]  We now got about 54,000 files on the site that have some controversial, some not so much, but they're all based on reducing the amount of secrecy by government, and through government, the secrecy of corporations who do work with government.
[03:10:55.356 --> 03:10:57.317]  And so that brings us to the Microsoft case.
[03:10:57.317 --> 03:10:58.977]  It's happened more recently.
[03:10:58.977 --> 03:11:04.619]  One of the things that's happened since 9-1-1 is that spying on Americans has become very big business.
[03:11:04.619 --> 03:11:07.820]  And corporations now are doing it covertly.
[03:11:07.820 --> 03:11:17.223]  Microsoft among them, but all the giant people online are now assisting government to spy on citizens through their customer data.
[03:11:17.223 --> 03:11:22.144]  Someone, an anonymous person, gave us what we call the Microsoft Spy Guide.
[03:11:22.144 --> 03:11:23.825]  It's actually a global criminal
[03:11:25.797 --> 03:11:34.200]  assistance guide to law enforcement to help law enforcement write subpoenas for Microsoft's data on its customers.
[03:11:34.200 --> 03:11:45.944]  And it holds the law enforcement people's hands who may not be technically adept to tell them what to ask for, and also how to explain what they're getting from Microsoft about their customers.
[03:11:45.944 --> 03:11:46.925]  And so we published that.
[03:11:46.925 --> 03:11:50.466]  We thought that was a good document for the public to see.
[03:11:50.466 --> 03:11:53.267]  And so a day or two later, we got a notice from our
[03:11:55.874 --> 03:12:08.582]  Provider Network Solutions, another giant firm who also spies on its customers, saying that Microsoft had filed a notice under DMCA alleging copyright infringement of this document.
[03:12:08.582 --> 03:12:11.564]  We sent back and said this document needs to be seen by the public.
[03:12:11.564 --> 03:12:13.906]  Copyright should not be used to hide this document.
[03:12:13.906 --> 03:12:15.447]  It's nothing about copyright.
[03:12:15.447 --> 03:12:20.170]  Copyright is being used to hide information about what's being done to Microsoft's customers.
[03:12:22.378 --> 03:12:25.559]  So, Network Solutions says, well then file a counterclaim.
[03:12:25.559 --> 03:12:28.279]  So we did, and they immediately shut our site.
[03:12:28.279 --> 03:12:30.400]  As soon as they got the claim, they shut it down.
[03:12:30.400 --> 03:12:31.600]  Locked the domain.
[03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:34.301]  We couldn't transfer it to anywhere else.
[03:12:34.301 --> 03:12:36.621]  And that's the first time that's ever happened.
[03:12:36.621 --> 03:12:47.664]  But it was done through this law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which gives corporations the right to shut down sites just by filing a notice, and there's no appeal to it.
[03:12:49.164 --> 03:12:50.765]  So we wanted to test that.
[03:12:50.765 --> 03:12:53.707]  We hoped that Microsoft wouldn't take us to court.
[03:12:53.707 --> 03:13:01.812]  They've since backed off because other people on the internet picked it up and started publishing the same document, including a number of news organizations.
[03:13:01.812 --> 03:13:08.115]  And so very quickly the document became very well known throughout the U.S.
[03:13:08.115 --> 03:13:08.856]  and throughout the world.
[03:13:09.935 --> 03:13:12.437]  Even though we were down, it was already out.
[03:13:12.437 --> 03:13:18.782]  And since then, yesterday, Microsoft sent a notice to Network Solutions saying, we're lifting our complaint.
[03:13:18.782 --> 03:13:20.704]  Please restore the site.
[03:13:20.704 --> 03:13:21.925]  And that's what's happened.
[03:13:21.925 --> 03:13:24.427]  Which shows that's a fraudulent complaint.
[03:13:24.427 --> 03:13:26.008]  You now have damageable action.
[03:13:27.475 --> 03:13:41.081]  Yeah, in fact, Prison Planet made the first point that I've seen about it, saying that Network Solutions actually use authority as a domain manager for thousands of sites to actually lock our domain down.
[03:13:41.081 --> 03:13:46.143]  Typically, that role is separate from offering ISP service, and so they use two powers.
[03:13:46.143 --> 03:13:56.648]  One is they shut down our site, which is what any ISP can do, but they also then use their domain management power to lock the name, the domain name, where I couldn't transfer it to another site I'd already set up
[03:13:57.992 --> 03:14:01.555]  Which is outside of that digital millennium law.
[03:14:01.555 --> 03:14:08.181]  Well, that's what's happened, is that corporations now are abusing this law because all they need to do is send an email to an ISP to get action.
[03:14:08.181 --> 03:14:09.182]  They don't need to go to court.
[03:14:09.182 --> 03:14:11.164]  They don't need to be expensive lawyers.
[03:14:11.164 --> 03:14:12.945]  They just do it, and it happens.
[03:14:12.945 --> 03:14:14.386]  That's the way the thing has been set up.
[03:14:14.386 --> 03:14:15.527]  But it's being abused now.
[03:14:15.527 --> 03:14:20.852]  They're actually claiming copyright over stuff that has no right to be copyrighted.
[03:14:20.852 --> 03:14:22.894]  So it's a sham now, and it needs to be changed.
[03:14:23.916 --> 03:14:26.118]  Well, let's expand on that.
[03:14:26.118 --> 03:14:30.641]  Four or five months ago, this secret UN treaty on copyright came out.
[03:14:30.641 --> 03:14:32.883]  It's basically an expansion of this.
[03:14:32.883 --> 03:14:33.804]  That's what Italy's saying.
[03:14:33.804 --> 03:14:35.305]  You've got to have a license to post video.
[03:14:35.305 --> 03:14:38.708]  They want you to have a license to be a blogger.
[03:14:38.708 --> 03:14:42.891]  We've got Australia saying they want Chinese-style net censorship.
[03:14:42.891 --> 03:14:47.154]  Anyone complains, then your website's put on a list that's banned in Australia.
[03:14:47.154 --> 03:14:52.839]  We have Time Magazine, Newsweek, the New York Times calling for a kinder, gentler gatekeeper internet.
[03:14:53.885 --> 03:15:01.016]  We have cybersecurity openly taking over the entire grid, the physical transfer lines of the web.
[03:15:01.016 --> 03:15:03.960]  I mean, they're definitely coming against the web right now.
[03:15:03.960 --> 03:15:04.762]  That's right.
[03:15:04.762 --> 03:15:05.723]  Very much so.
[03:15:05.723 --> 03:15:06.845]  It's a worldwide initiative.
[03:15:08.678 --> 03:15:20.724]  And one of the things that we find interesting is not just government, it is these commercial firms who also are working with government to control the internet and shut down freedom of speech, shut down the more unruly side of the internet.
[03:15:20.724 --> 03:15:21.865]  Well that's internet too!
[03:15:21.865 --> 03:15:23.766]  That's what they've been saying for seven years, internet too.
[03:15:23.766 --> 03:15:30.729]  Meetings that are public, we have the transcripts, is that corporations in this new world order, they're given the government power.
[03:15:30.729 --> 03:15:31.110]  That's right.
[03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:37.613]  That's right, and so it's not just government, it's these firms who also want to dominate the internet.
[03:15:39.631 --> 03:15:45.335]  And so, this guide that we published, we've now published about 36 of these what we call spying guides.
[03:15:45.335 --> 03:15:55.881]  These are arrangements that these corporations have with ISPs to hand over data on customers without the customers knowing it's being done.
[03:15:55.881 --> 03:16:03.066]  Some of the companies make it public, but others hide it, like Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, a whole slew of them still hide it because they don't want the customers to know they're doing this.
[03:16:03.066 --> 03:16:04.527]  It's also a very lucrative business.
[03:16:05.467 --> 03:16:08.888]  And so the Internet is a gigantic spying machine right now.
[03:16:08.888 --> 03:16:11.388]  And it's very lucrative business to spy on it.
[03:16:11.388 --> 03:16:16.769]  We put up a site listing all the companies who sell spying services to government and to corporations.
[03:16:16.769 --> 03:16:22.230]  You know, there are these subcontractors who write these programs to do the spying and the program data analysis.
[03:16:22.230 --> 03:16:25.491]  But Microsoft is just the top of the heap.
[03:16:25.491 --> 03:16:29.792]  There's a whole range of smaller companies providing this service around the world.
[03:16:30.543 --> 03:16:36.266]  Well, I mean, Bill Gates two weeks ago said China's doing a great thing with its censorship, and he doesn't see a problem with it.
[03:16:36.266 --> 03:16:41.549]  Microsoft, according to my research, helped build the architecture of censorship for China.
[03:16:41.549 --> 03:16:42.130]  Absolutely.
[03:16:42.130 --> 03:16:44.571]  That's right.
[03:16:44.571 --> 03:16:46.172]  That's what they're doing.
[03:16:46.172 --> 03:16:48.013]  Well, look at our... This is just business.
[03:16:48.013 --> 03:16:50.274]  Well, actually, no, it's not just business.
[03:16:50.274 --> 03:16:51.735]  Well, look at our government.
[03:16:51.735 --> 03:16:56.357]  When it has its druthers in a third world country or first world, they set up a dictatorship.
[03:16:58.243 --> 03:17:11.156]  They've made deals with big corporations as a cartel to slice it up and control it, and then the revolving door in cyber security and homeland security, and the same in the other nations, rotates through these private corporations.
[03:17:11.156 --> 03:17:15.541]  The government gives them giant contracts to spy and steal data.
[03:17:15.541 --> 03:17:17.944]  I mean, it goes back to the 1996 Telecommunications Act.
[03:17:18.484 --> 03:17:33.112]  Where they paid the phone companies to put in the spying rooms and all the facilities, and for my research, that's all the Cybersecurity Act is, is putting in the next wave of these snooping grids over the entire internet.
[03:17:33.112 --> 03:17:37.054]  That's correct.
[03:17:37.054 --> 03:17:38.575]  So where do you go from here?
[03:17:38.575 --> 03:17:40.116]  Because we need to punish Microsoft.
[03:17:40.116 --> 03:17:45.479]  We need to point out the tyranny that's being engaged in here.
[03:17:46.237 --> 03:17:50.238]  Well, I'll just say is that I'm one of a number of people who are working on this.
[03:17:50.238 --> 03:18:00.161]  The Electronic Freedom Frontier Foundation is one of the people taking the lead on filing suit against these corporations whenever they attack an individual.
[03:18:00.161 --> 03:18:06.122]  They go to court and win most of their cases because these folks don't want to be challenged in court.
[03:18:06.122 --> 03:18:08.483]  They want to do this covertly without going to court.
[03:18:08.483 --> 03:18:11.984]  And so EFF is doing it, but a number of others are doing it as well, as you mentioned.
[03:18:15.253 --> 03:18:15.894]  We're good to go.
[03:18:46.290 --> 03:18:54.399]  Well, I mean, let's go back to 2002, a USA Today article, I think the headline was, scofflaws get caught ordering pizza.
[03:18:54.399 --> 03:18:56.581]  Guys, pull that up for me.
[03:18:56.581 --> 03:19:00.646]  And in it, it talks about how the big pizza companies, the big three,
[03:19:01.687 --> 03:19:05.310]  Nor do they understand that there's fascination with the internet.
[03:19:22.299 --> 03:19:29.325]  is deliberate, and that there's never been such an easy way to spy on the public as the internet now.
[03:19:29.325 --> 03:19:32.647]  The phone couldn't do it, TV couldn't do it, telephone couldn't do it.
[03:19:32.647 --> 03:19:45.117]  Nothing is as pervasive because the excitement that people find in going to the internet, googling, seeming like all this stuff is free, when in fact it's what's happening in the background that they don't know about.
[03:19:45.117 --> 03:19:50.782]  And so that's the intent of the internet, is to make it a magical device for people to come to it, don't even stop to think
[03:19:52.563 --> 03:20:01.228]  So the globalists get a database and a psychological algorithm on each individual in the country and can gauge things with predictive programs.
[03:20:01.228 --> 03:20:04.290]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[03:20:04.290 --> 03:20:12.474]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecolablu atmospheric water generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:20:12.474 --> 03:20:14.556]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[03:22:23.711 --> 03:22:30.113]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:30.113 --> 03:22:35.655]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:35.655 --> 03:22:45.279]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:45.399 --> 03:22:47.741]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:47.741 --> 03:22:49.343]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:49.343 --> 03:22:51.805]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:51.805 --> 03:22:53.927]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:53.927 --> 03:22:59.072]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:24:12.952 --> 03:24:19.394]  The establishment intended to get you addicted to the internet, we've always pointed that out, and then used it as the worldwide wiretap.
[03:24:19.394 --> 03:24:25.416]  The NSA, 30 years ago, called it as they developed it, the worldwide wiretap.
[03:24:25.416 --> 03:24:29.537]  But, we can use it against them if people are aware of this.
[03:24:29.537 --> 03:24:33.838]  The fact is they're accelerating their program of control now because they're really getting concerned.
[03:24:33.838 --> 03:24:35.479]  Do you agree with that statement, John Young?
[03:24:37.605 --> 03:24:42.087]  Now, you got into something very deep, which they admit but isn't popularly known.
[03:24:42.087 --> 03:24:47.310]  In fact, I have an article, cell phones show human movement predictable 93% of the time.
[03:24:49.238 --> 03:24:52.119]  Just off tracking our cell phones in England and the U.S.
[03:24:52.119 --> 03:24:56.901]  where we move, they learn what we do as an individual.
[03:24:56.901 --> 03:25:09.206]  I mean, this is literally what Isaac Asimov wrote about in his foundation series, where a mathematician comes up with computers that can predict mass movements of people 99% of the time.
[03:25:09.206 --> 03:25:12.208]  Correct.
[03:25:12.208 --> 03:25:13.388]  Your comments, sir?
[03:25:13.388 --> 03:25:15.249]  Well, for example, in the case of Google,
[03:25:16.471 --> 03:25:20.072]  Everything you search for becomes part of the data, and they can track you.
[03:25:20.072 --> 03:25:21.673]  Just like the cell phone is tracked.
[03:25:21.673 --> 03:25:30.356]  They can tell where you're going, what your tastes are, what your health interest is, what your sex interest is, what your business interest is, where you bank.
[03:25:30.356 --> 03:25:37.339]  So, just using Google alone, and there are dozens of these sites like that that are gathering this data.
[03:25:37.339 --> 03:25:44.001]  And so that cell phone tracks you geophysically, and the internet tracks you digitally.
[03:25:46.303 --> 03:25:53.089]  And with RF— If you use any of the Internet-related services like the telephone and others that are coming online are very proper.
[03:25:53.089 --> 03:25:57.313]  They even use that to also track your telephone calls and who you're calling.
[03:25:57.313 --> 03:26:05.881]  So, and by the way, the government has admitted that they spy on these social media sites like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter.
[03:26:05.881 --> 03:26:06.882]  So they've already admitted that.
[03:26:07.822 --> 03:26:10.845]  The thing is, what they won't tell us is, well, what are they doing with the data?
[03:26:10.845 --> 03:26:17.090]  Now, the key to all this is they always justify this as, we're doing this to fight the criminals and the terrorists.
[03:26:17.090 --> 03:26:18.851]  The thing is, they overreach.
[03:26:18.851 --> 03:26:25.156]  They use that as just an opening gambit, and they expand it to watch people who are not criminals, who are not terrorists.
[03:26:25.156 --> 03:26:31.742]  And so, that's what we have to make a distinction is, is that they always argue that we're doing this to protect the public.
[03:26:31.742 --> 03:26:35.345]  The thing is, is that they don't need to spy on us this much to protect the public.
[03:26:37.506 --> 03:26:44.391]  Well, more than that, we got the homeland security documents, the whole homeland security system set up for the American people.
[03:26:44.391 --> 03:26:46.492]  They admit that internally.
[03:26:46.492 --> 03:26:50.335]  Governor Ridge admitted the terror alerts were fake for political gain.
[03:26:50.335 --> 03:26:53.798]  This whole thing is aimed at the people.
[03:26:53.798 --> 03:26:56.500]  Yes.
[03:26:56.500 --> 03:27:03.545]  As you well know from the years you've been working with us, the biggest threat to government are their own citizens in all countries.
[03:27:03.545 --> 03:27:05.466]  They never say that, but that's the biggest threat.
[03:27:09.164 --> 03:27:14.848]  And so that is the reason that they hide behind the term national security.
[03:27:14.848 --> 03:27:20.673]  That's just a device to get more money to actually protect government from its own citizens.
[03:27:20.673 --> 03:27:31.661]  I know this is a bitter pill to swallow, but I think we have to get serious about how this actually works and not buy into all the spin that's put out about external enemies.
[03:27:33.680 --> 03:27:55.200]  Well we know that the NSA grid, the government in every case has to run drills of the exact attack they're going to run when they stage terror so that other people in government who aren't part of the inside job don't bust their operation and in every case Sybil Edmonds, everybody else hears Al Qaeda working for the CIA on the day of 9-11 and she's gagged.
[03:27:55.200 --> 03:27:56.401]  So in every case
[03:27:57.522 --> 03:28:18.756]  The other aspect of it that I find intriguing is one of the things we have to deal with is being stigmatized, called a conspiracy nut.
[03:28:18.756 --> 03:28:21.899]  They use all these demeaning terms to anyone who broke too much.
[03:28:21.899 --> 03:28:23.740]  You just got a little past that.
[03:28:23.740 --> 03:28:26.662]  Those are just standard techniques to suppress your views.
[03:28:27.469 --> 03:28:32.694]  You've got to keep digging, keep looking, stop trusting authority, and keep digging on your own.
[03:28:32.694 --> 03:28:33.695]  That's what we advocate.
[03:28:33.695 --> 03:28:38.820]  We run our site as a library, not as a blog, not as a lead site.
[03:28:38.820 --> 03:28:40.421]  It's actually a library of information.
[03:28:40.421 --> 03:28:50.491]  90% of our documents are not controversial, but they're highly informative about how government works, and you've just got to do a lot of educational work and not be seduced by headline stuff.
[03:28:52.085 --> 03:28:56.610]  Yeah, Cryptome.org is so great because you're just reading the documents and you make your own decision about them.
[03:28:56.610 --> 03:28:57.051]  That's right.
[03:28:57.051 --> 03:28:57.832]  That's the key.
[03:28:57.832 --> 03:29:04.600]  Make your own decision.
[03:29:04.600 --> 03:29:06.141]  Like Operation Northwoods.
[03:29:06.141 --> 03:29:10.586]  When we come back in the final segment we've got with you, I want to talk about how we support Cryptome.org, but also
[03:29:12.422 --> 03:29:19.786]  I mean, I remember Google four years ago saying they're gonna use cameras and microphones to watch you in your house with computers recording keyword.
[03:29:19.786 --> 03:29:25.729]  Now we learn all over the country, not just in Philadelphia, but they have school people going on PBS.
[03:29:27.358 --> 03:29:33.199]  And just calmly showing the news how they watch kids in the school, out of the school.
[03:29:33.199 --> 03:29:39.020]  So, like we're cattle, they're just domesticating us, introducing this to everyone.
[03:29:39.020 --> 03:29:41.460]  Cryptome.org is the key website.
[03:29:41.460 --> 03:29:42.721]  Check it out, support it.
[03:29:42.721 --> 03:29:50.102]  We see Cryptome, we see WikiLeaks, we see Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, all being censored all over the world in different ways.
[03:29:50.102 --> 03:29:51.022]  Why is that?
[03:29:51.022 --> 03:29:53.682]  We'll be back.
[03:29:53.682 --> 03:29:55.083]  We're on the march.
[03:29:55.083 --> 03:29:56.583]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:57.592 --> 03:30:00.301]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.452 --> 03:30:06.574]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:30:06.574 --> 03:30:09.435]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:30:09.435 --> 03:30:10.715]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:30:10.715 --> 03:30:11.536]  It's very real.

[03:31:11.962 --> 03:31:13.363]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:14.071 --> 03:31:16.753]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:16.753 --> 03:31:23.137]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:23.137 --> 03:31:28.340]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:28.340 --> 03:31:31.603]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:31:31.603 --> 03:31:38.327]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:38.447 --> 03:31:40.788]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:40.788 --> 03:31:42.369]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:42.369 --> 03:31:44.830]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:44.830 --> 03:31:46.972]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:46.972 --> 03:31:52.114]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:33:08.687 --> 03:33:13.590]  Sunday, I noticed that Glenn Beck was in USA Today on the cover of USA Weekend.
[03:33:13.590 --> 03:33:16.291]  We'll put it on screen right now for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:33:16.291 --> 03:33:20.373]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:33:20.373 --> 03:33:24.795]  Beck's failure to retract global warming advocacy provokes online firestorm.
[03:33:24.795 --> 03:33:27.196]  He's going on air saying he believes it.
[03:33:27.196 --> 03:33:30.058]  You Beck supporters thought I was lying that he was in USA Today?
[03:33:32.315 --> 03:33:33.357]  But we don't lie here.
[03:33:33.357 --> 03:33:36.264]  Sometimes we get stuff wrong.
[03:33:36.264 --> 03:33:39.711]  Okay.
[03:33:39.711 --> 03:33:41.896]  Let's go back to johnyoungofcrypto.org.
[03:33:44.557 --> 03:33:51.799]  I was talking about spy cams there, and the fact that they're just, yes, we're watching your kids at home through the cameras, what's the big deal?
[03:33:51.799 --> 03:33:58.020]  And now if we think your husband's history means he might hit you, not that he's ever even hit you, you're gonna wear ankle bracelets.
[03:33:58.020 --> 03:34:03.702]  It's all this predictive pre-crime, and they're putting brain scanners in airports saying it can tell if you're angry.
[03:34:03.702 --> 03:34:06.943]  A bunch of quackery to sell tyranny.
[03:34:06.943 --> 03:34:10.424]  Worse than the lie detector that's been discredited.
[03:34:10.424 --> 03:34:11.264]  Comments on that, sir?
[03:34:12.793 --> 03:34:22.197]  I think that one of the things that's hard to grasp is how much of high technology is being used against the public interest.
[03:34:22.197 --> 03:34:27.940]  Even as it's spun out, being on for our protection and for our pleasure, how much of it is being used to track us.
[03:34:27.940 --> 03:34:35.063]  For example, most digital cameras can be intercepted even though they're being run by your computer.
[03:34:35.063 --> 03:34:41.026]  They emit electromagnetic waves that can be intercepted by someone in the next room or across the street.
[03:34:42.142 --> 03:34:50.859]  And so one of the devilish things about these wonderful inventions of high technology is that they all leak information about you to someone who has the right equipment.
[03:34:53.641 --> 03:34:59.324]  Are you worried, because I've seen a lot of cases of this, the Internet's perfect to frame people.
[03:34:59.324 --> 03:35:04.507]  Government doesn't have to bury a pipe bomb on your back, 40, like they do in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.
[03:35:04.507 --> 03:35:12.392]  Now, they just claim you visited some illegal porn sites, or they claim you were investigating how to build bombs.
[03:35:12.392 --> 03:35:14.413]  I've seen a lot of evidence of them framing people.
[03:35:16.915 --> 03:35:17.696]  That's correct.
[03:35:17.696 --> 03:35:19.176]  They can make a compelling case.
[03:35:19.176 --> 03:35:31.343]  And we actually read court transcripts of testimony of the prosecution's expert witnesses and watch them fudge the truth about what they're getting by electronic means.
[03:35:31.343 --> 03:35:34.505]  But they put on very impressive shows.
[03:35:34.505 --> 03:35:42.149]  In fact, some of the best people at putting on these shows are themselves not technologists, who don't understand the technology very well, but they know what jurors like to hear.
[03:35:43.383 --> 03:35:46.184]  And they went over 90% of their cases.
[03:35:46.184 --> 03:35:50.605]  Well, the good news here is Microsoft backed up, this gave them a big black eye.
[03:35:50.605 --> 03:35:54.927]  Why did they think that they could shut you down and get away with it?
[03:36:11.926 --> 03:36:12.807]  That's a good question.
[03:36:12.807 --> 03:36:19.994]  I'm going to have to work on that one, Alex, because we do not expect it to happen, and we're going to try to find out how to take advantage of that unexpected.
[03:36:19.994 --> 03:36:27.841]  They may have done it just for PR purposes, in order to not have to go to court and explain how more extensive it is than just our one little case.
[03:36:27.841 --> 03:36:33.286]  We happen to know they send out thousands of these notices per week, like we got, and get away with it.
[03:36:33.286 --> 03:36:34.787]  And they never have to defend it in court.
[03:36:34.787 --> 03:36:36.449]  They just bluff people into obeying.
[03:36:37.449 --> 03:36:47.491]  Yeah, we've had some of these and I don't usually make a big deal out of it.
[03:36:47.491 --> 03:36:50.792]  I just file in federal court against it.
[03:36:50.792 --> 03:36:58.874]  We had our YouTube channel taken down and I just went and did the federal filing and then it went back up.
[03:36:59.594 --> 03:37:00.735]  Because it is a bluff.
[03:37:00.735 --> 03:37:01.456]  It is a fraud.
[03:37:01.456 --> 03:37:11.764]  I mean, we're allowed to play a one-minute clip of Michael Reagan saying, murder 9-11 truthers, I will give you weapons, I will give you bullets, I will give you money, kill Mark Dice.
[03:37:11.764 --> 03:37:16.748]  We're allowed to play a clip of him and say, look at this criminal saying, murder us.
[03:37:16.748 --> 03:37:21.691]  And that's fair use and that's the end of it.
[03:37:21.691 --> 03:37:22.552]  Yep.
[03:37:22.552 --> 03:37:27.816]  And so, again, the best power of having a platform to speak
[03:37:29.551 --> 03:37:29.811]  Absolutely.
[03:37:29.811 --> 03:37:34.852]  Well, I tell you, sir, we just commend the work you're doing in the 3-4 minutes we've got left with you.
[03:37:34.852 --> 03:37:37.013]  Any other key points that you want to get across to the audience?
[03:37:37.013 --> 03:37:38.873]  Well, I have one more question before we plug Crypto.org.
[03:37:38.873 --> 03:37:39.473]  I know people support it.
[03:37:58.536 --> 03:37:59.496]  So you agree with me.
[03:37:59.496 --> 03:38:02.958]  I mean, obviously you're doing the research, so you already know the facts.
[03:38:02.958 --> 03:38:11.062]  I mean, they're openly floating the idea of shutting down freedom on the web and having a few thousand websites you can visit under Internet 2.
[03:38:11.062 --> 03:38:25.208]  The Cybersecurity Act that passed the House says that ISPs down to 100 service customers, tiny ISPs, will take all the orders from the Feds and install their hardware and software that they're going to recruit the youth
[03:38:26.092 --> 03:38:30.697]  Well, it's coming, and at the risk of being my favorite term, a conspiracy nut, I think that you cannot be.
[03:38:49.833 --> 03:38:57.898]  Paranoid enough about what the government is doing, and they always make fun of it to try to demean it, but I say that we're not nearly suspicious enough.
[03:38:57.898 --> 03:39:02.081]  I don't think that the underwear bomber was as innocent as it sounds.
[03:39:02.081 --> 03:39:03.402]  And I think that more of that will come out.
[03:39:03.402 --> 03:39:14.989]  I think there are false flag operations going on, and if you watch how these agencies and governments work around the world over the last thousand years, these are not unusual, all-out provocateur operations.
[03:39:14.989 --> 03:39:16.250]  They actually provoke
[03:39:18.740 --> 03:39:23.761]  You're a fellow Texan, I just learned.
[03:39:23.761 --> 03:39:26.002]  We're proud of other great Texans out there.
[03:39:26.002 --> 03:39:30.063]  How much of your time do you spend on this versus architecture?
[03:39:30.063 --> 03:39:31.703]  What got you into this?
[03:39:45.373 --> 03:39:57.679]  Well, I started doing what we call public service work right after college as a way to supplement professional work, which we saw was going to be very narrow and very catered toward our customers.
[03:39:57.679 --> 03:40:04.262]  And so a group of us decided to continue doing public service work on our own, unpaid, and so we're still doing it.
[03:40:04.262 --> 03:40:08.424]  And that's now some 40 years later.
[03:40:08.424 --> 03:40:11.545]  So we've been doing it a long time, long before Cryptome came along.
[03:40:11.545 --> 03:40:13.086]  How do we support Cryptome.org?
[03:40:14.249 --> 03:40:16.571]  Well, one is read it, use it as a resource.
[03:40:16.571 --> 03:40:18.073]  That's what it's there for.
[03:40:18.073 --> 03:40:25.941]  And we happen to offer some DVDs of the collection, but it's strictly, if you want it for your own, it's wide open site.
[03:40:25.941 --> 03:40:28.023]  Everything that's on the DVD is on the site.
[03:40:28.023 --> 03:40:31.947]  And so it's no access charges.
[03:40:31.947 --> 03:40:37.412]  And so we get some money through the DVDs, but basically it's paid for by our architectural
[03:40:38.459 --> 03:40:42.062]  But it's good to have a hard copy so everybody should buy these DVDs.
[03:40:42.062 --> 03:40:48.306]  I know a lot of people are mirroring and copying and posting doppelgangers of your site everywhere.
[03:40:48.306 --> 03:40:52.349]  And I think this has been a crushing defeat for Microsoft though.
[03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:56.152]  I think this is, it's safe to say, do you agree this has blown up in their face?
[03:40:56.152 --> 03:40:56.773]  Uh, yep.
[03:40:56.773 --> 03:40:57.213]  Yep.
[03:40:57.213 --> 03:40:58.934]  I don't think they expected this.
[03:40:58.934 --> 03:40:59.795]  In fact, they said that.
[03:40:59.795 --> 03:41:03.178]  They did not expect it to happen.
[03:41:03.178 --> 03:41:04.939]  That is, they didn't expect the big backlash.
[03:41:06.132 --> 03:41:14.633]  All right, well, John Young, we really appreciate you spending time with us from Cryptome.org, and we'll talk to you again, and thank you for defending freedom.
[03:41:14.633 --> 03:41:15.214]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:41:15.214 --> 03:41:16.354]  It's always a pleasure.
[03:41:16.354 --> 03:41:17.034]  All right, take care.
[03:41:17.034 --> 03:41:19.154]  There he goes.
[03:41:19.154 --> 03:41:20.314]  Oh, man.
[03:41:20.314 --> 03:41:23.355]  All in a day's work here as we fight tyranny on every front.
[03:41:23.355 --> 03:41:26.155]  All right, I want to go over some important news here.
[03:41:26.155 --> 03:41:31.336]  Look, I don't want to attack Glenn Beck.
[03:41:31.336 --> 03:41:34.617]  I don't want to be in a fight with Clair Channel.
[03:41:36.616 --> 03:41:38.818]  But I have my First Amendment.
[03:41:38.818 --> 03:41:45.623]  And Glenn Beck is constantly attacking us and is duplicitous.
[03:41:45.623 --> 03:41:46.503]  Okay?
[03:41:46.503 --> 03:41:49.185]  And I'm sick of double talkers.
[03:41:49.185 --> 03:41:59.573]  Now, Al Gore, Barack Obama are discredited punks.
[03:41:59.573 --> 03:42:02.896]  And we're still attacking them and exposing them as New World Order fronts.
[03:42:02.896 --> 03:42:04.257]  Yesterday, with the whole birther thing.
[03:42:06.343 --> 03:42:15.027]  The whole first hour attacking Obama and his healthcare takeover and his cyber security and his environment takeover.
[03:42:15.027 --> 03:42:17.269]  So people say, why don't you spend more time on Barack Obama?
[03:42:17.269 --> 03:42:17.969]  We do.
[03:42:17.969 --> 03:42:24.072]  My last two films follow the Republic and Obama deception exposing him and who runs him.
[03:42:24.072 --> 03:42:27.354]  But Glenn Beck is placed at a key juncture.
[03:42:28.854 --> 03:42:31.615]  Two, when Ron Paul's about to win, he comes out and attacks him.
[03:42:31.615 --> 03:42:34.415]  When other candidates that are pro-liberty, he comes out.
[03:42:34.415 --> 03:42:39.797]  He runs these operations, and I've seen him say militias are bad.
[03:42:39.797 --> 03:42:42.898]  I've seen him say we need to use the army against Ron Paul supporters.
[03:42:42.898 --> 03:42:47.879]  I've seen him say the banker bailout is good, and then say he didn't say that until he got called on it.
[03:42:47.879 --> 03:42:48.699]  It's the lying.
[03:42:52.284 --> 03:42:56.586]  They intend to keep the income tax and then give you a value-added and sales tax on top of it.
[03:42:56.586 --> 03:42:57.826]  But he's pushing that.
[03:42:57.826 --> 03:42:59.007]  Value-added and sales tax.
[03:42:59.007 --> 03:43:03.408]  So is the guy who tours the country with O'Reilly.
[03:43:03.408 --> 03:43:04.749]  A guy who believes in global warming.
[03:43:04.749 --> 03:43:06.390]  Sarah Palin says she believes in it.
[03:43:06.390 --> 03:43:09.011]  And I get emails going, no she doesn't, no he doesn't.
[03:43:09.011 --> 03:43:10.971]  He was in USA Today!
[03:43:10.971 --> 03:43:12.032]  Put it up on screen.
[03:43:12.032 --> 03:43:14.753]  USA Weekend.
[03:43:14.753 --> 03:43:17.414]  Their big weekend magazine.
[03:43:17.414 --> 03:43:19.335]  Who's that on the cover there?
[03:43:19.335 --> 03:43:20.115]  Who is that man?
[03:43:21.775 --> 03:43:23.216]  And it's a positive article.
[03:43:23.216 --> 03:43:25.997]  In fact, what's the actual headline that doesn't have it?
[03:43:25.997 --> 03:43:28.898]  It was something like, you know, don't judge a book by its cover.
[03:43:28.898 --> 03:43:30.178]  He's a great guy.
[03:43:30.178 --> 03:43:33.339]  He's so wonderful.
[03:43:33.339 --> 03:43:37.681]  He's Wonderbar.
[03:43:37.681 --> 03:43:40.322]  We all live in America.
[03:43:40.322 --> 03:43:43.203]  America is Wonderbar.
[03:43:43.203 --> 03:43:44.283]  I mean, this guy's a joke.
[03:43:44.283 --> 03:43:46.424]  And he goes on to say, I believe in global warming.
[03:43:46.424 --> 03:43:47.684]  I've got a greenhouse.
[03:43:47.684 --> 03:43:49.205]  I'll do anything for the environment.
[03:43:50.336 --> 03:43:53.178]  But those light bulbs, I don't like how they look.
[03:43:53.178 --> 03:43:55.919]  I just, it's such a problem.
[03:43:55.919 --> 03:44:01.563]  And so he gets you emotionally invested in him, saying a lot of the right things, and at key points, flip-flops.
[03:44:01.563 --> 03:44:06.466]  And the people are like, uh, uh, uh, can't compute.
[03:44:06.466 --> 03:44:08.747]  That's why I got so mad at Debra Medina.
[03:44:08.747 --> 03:44:11.468]  She comes out, says, well, people have a right to question the government on 9-11 Truth.
[03:44:13.257 --> 03:44:17.500]  And then she puts out a statement, kind of, well, I don't think, you know, anybody else did it but those Arabs.
[03:44:17.500 --> 03:44:18.521]  And I'm like, well, whatever.
[03:44:18.521 --> 03:44:20.463]  You know, let her kind of be flip-floppy.
[03:44:20.463 --> 03:44:22.224]  Just, oh, come on, Debra.
[03:44:22.224 --> 03:44:24.286]  And I still defend her and, you know, do everything I can.
[03:44:24.286 --> 03:44:28.950]  And then, Mark Davis in Dallas, that's a big show.
[03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:30.031]  He fills in for Rush Limbaugh.
[03:44:30.031 --> 03:44:35.375]  He's, these people are an evil cult, a dangerous cult of scum and despicable.
[03:44:35.375 --> 03:44:38.678]  She's like, absolutely, I agree with you.
[03:44:40.652 --> 03:44:44.555]  I get mad at that when I invest in somebody and believe in them.
[03:44:44.555 --> 03:44:49.598]  And then I can't then take who I am and my integrity.
[03:44:49.598 --> 03:44:50.959]  Especially when it's clear-cut in front of me.
[03:44:50.959 --> 03:44:52.380]  We all make mistakes we're not thinking.
[03:44:52.380 --> 03:44:56.563]  And then we're four days in and she never apologized for it.
[03:44:56.563 --> 03:44:59.485]  Now I guess we'll go the lesser of two evils route here.
[03:44:59.485 --> 03:45:07.090]  And I've seen countless emails from the Medina campaign, from their people to my listeners, going that they sent her part of the transcript of what she said on Davis.
[03:45:07.090 --> 03:45:09.371]  Don't leave you the top.
[03:45:09.371 --> 03:45:10.312]  And that's deceptive.
[03:45:12.182 --> 03:45:14.325]  And they say, we're not attacking 9-11 truth.
[03:45:14.325 --> 03:45:15.206]  Yes, you did.
[03:45:15.206 --> 03:45:16.247]  See, that's even worse.
[03:45:16.247 --> 03:45:21.334]  But then I kind of get into the dirtiness and I go, I guess she's better than Perry or Hutchinson.
[03:45:21.334 --> 03:45:24.037]  It's all right.
[03:45:24.037 --> 03:45:25.119]  I'm just not going to vote.
[03:45:25.119 --> 03:45:29.424]  I was planning to go vote on Election Day.
[03:45:29.424 --> 03:45:29.885]  It was like...
[03:45:31.075 --> 03:45:35.960]  With the 2004 election, I went and voted, but not for president.
[03:45:35.960 --> 03:45:39.224]  I mean, Kerry-Bush, I knew the outcome was already set.
[03:45:39.224 --> 03:45:45.971]  I didn't vote, if memory serves, with McCain and Obama, because I knew it was already set.
[03:45:45.971 --> 03:45:52.218]  We have 8% turnout for county and city on a national average, I think it's 8.2, and we have
[03:45:56.428 --> 03:45:57.088]  What is it, almost 50%?
[03:45:57.088 --> 03:45:59.309]  It was even higher in the last election?
[03:45:59.309 --> 03:46:04.672]  For the president, this big pageant, when the real power is local.
[03:46:04.672 --> 03:46:11.736]  And so, I don't think I can make myself go even vote.
[03:46:11.736 --> 03:46:13.297]  For either of the three.
[03:46:13.297 --> 03:46:14.317]  That's my personal.
[03:46:14.317 --> 03:46:15.738]  I get my vote, don't I?
[03:46:15.738 --> 03:46:17.899]  I'm allowed to have my vote.
[03:46:17.899 --> 03:46:20.841]  Or maybe not.
[03:46:20.841 --> 03:46:25.103]  To that 1% out there, the few emails I've gotten saying, you know, you just need to roll over to what she did.
[03:46:27.028 --> 03:46:30.131]  Four days later, nothing.
[03:46:30.131 --> 03:46:47.785]  But, duplicitous emails from their people to my listeners, they send us, sending them part of what she said on the show and saying it's not true or... It's just, Glenn Beck, any of these people, I just can't handle it anymore.
[03:46:47.785 --> 03:46:51.388]  You know, Israel did target Jim Traficant.
[03:46:51.388 --> 03:46:52.348]  They did put him in prison.
[03:46:52.348 --> 03:46:53.109]  They did set him up.
[03:46:53.109 --> 03:46:55.611]  So I had him on and we kept going back to Israel.
[03:46:55.611 --> 03:46:56.292]  You know, that's something
[03:46:57.526 --> 03:47:06.312]  I've tried to be more mainstream and just cover the bigger issues, but when Israel needs to be criticized on organs, or wars, or manipulating our politics, I'm doing that.
[03:47:06.312 --> 03:47:08.633]  I mean, have you noticed?
[03:47:08.633 --> 03:47:10.855]  We're just trying to tell the truth here.
[03:47:10.855 --> 03:47:12.316]  That's all I've got is the truth.
[03:47:12.316 --> 03:47:15.318]  Now, let me get into this big headline here.
[03:47:15.318 --> 03:47:20.741]  I just had my Glenn Beck article here in front of me.
[03:47:20.741 --> 03:47:21.602]  Here it is.
[03:47:21.602 --> 03:47:24.024]  And it's up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:47:24.995 --> 03:47:32.540]  We got this out for everybody on Monday, our audience, and I got a lot of hate emails saying you're lying, that's not in the USA Today.
[03:47:32.540 --> 03:47:36.462]  I mean, you talk about delusional.
[03:47:36.462 --> 03:47:41.145]  It's delusional because people invest in Beck and they don't want to admit they've been conned or that they've been wronged.
[03:47:42.523 --> 03:47:47.265]  Beck's failure to retract global warming advocacy provokes online firestorm.
[03:47:47.265 --> 03:47:51.147]  This is all over World Net Daily, all over Newsmax, everywhere.
[03:47:51.147 --> 03:47:56.550]  More conservatives are waking up to the fact that Beck is a shill for the bankers and the elite.
[03:47:56.550 --> 03:47:59.612]  And it's not just that he says global warming's real.
[03:47:59.612 --> 03:48:05.655]  He says it isn't real on his TV show and radio show, and then a week later says it is real.
[03:48:05.655 --> 03:48:06.975]  And he does it over and over.
[03:48:06.975 --> 03:48:08.496]  It's the flip-flopping.
[03:48:08.496 --> 03:48:09.657]  It's the lying.
[03:48:13.001 --> 03:48:17.203]  Glenn Beck has failed to respond to a firestorm of reaction to his comments.
[03:48:17.203 --> 03:48:20.564]  The word is, I've gotten calls that he did say, well, I do think some of it's real.
[03:48:20.564 --> 03:48:26.727]  Glenn Beck has failed to respond to a firestorm of reaction to his comments made during a February 21st interview with USA Today Weekend Magazine.
[03:48:26.727 --> 03:48:29.969]  Yeah, they're all emailing him and calling him and going, say it ain't so, Becks.
[03:48:29.969 --> 03:48:32.610]  And he'll just play joke sounds in the background, I was told.
[03:48:33.490 --> 03:48:48.996]  Glenn Beck has failed to respond to a firestorm of reaction to his comments made during a February 21st interview with USA Today Weekend Magazine in which he openly and completely reversed his position on climate change by revealing that he believed in man-made global warming.
[03:48:48.996 --> 03:49:01.981]  As we reported earlier this week, Beck appeared to stab his conservative audience in the back when he told USA Weekend Magazine that man-made climate change was occurring in an article entitled, Don't Judge Beck by His Cover.
[03:49:03.615 --> 03:49:06.618]  And again, this isn't stabbing his right-wing audience in the back.
[03:49:06.618 --> 03:49:08.280]  We're going past that paradigm.
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:12.405]  Most of the liberals I know know it's a fraud.
[03:49:12.405 --> 03:49:19.692]  In the article, Beck tells interviewer Dennis McCafferty, you'd be an idiot not to notice the temperature change.
[03:49:20.660 --> 03:49:26.463]  He also says there's a legit case for global warming has, at least in part, been caused by mankind, writes McCafferty.
[03:49:26.463 --> 03:49:29.245]  Under the sub-headline, he believes in global warming.
[03:49:29.245 --> 03:49:33.307]  The blogosphere is on fire with reaction to McCafferty's USA Weekend piece.
[03:49:33.307 --> 03:49:35.489]  According to WorldNetDaily, Chelsea Schilling
[03:49:36.249 --> 03:49:45.137]  Who pointed out that the posters on the prominent conservative forum Free Republic were furious at Beck for seemingly performing a huge flip-flop on the issue.
[03:49:45.137 --> 03:49:53.624]  Seems like the rose-colored glasses are beginning to fall off those who used to view Mr. Beck with good approval, wrote one.
[03:49:53.624 --> 03:49:56.146]  But see, maybe I'm not supposed to say he flip-flopped.
[03:49:56.146 --> 03:49:56.887]  Does that be mean?
[03:49:56.887 --> 03:49:59.690]  I'm supposed to say, oh, thank you, Beck, for your flip-flopping.
[03:50:00.330 --> 03:50:05.273]  Flip-flopping's not bad, it's good, as long as someone who says they're a constitutionalist does it.
[03:50:05.273 --> 03:50:09.436]  It's bad when Obama does it, but it's good when Peck does it.
[03:50:09.436 --> 03:50:11.617]  Or Deborah Medina.
[03:50:11.617 --> 03:50:17.801]  Seems like the rose-colored glasses are beginning to fall off those who used to view Mr. Peck with good approval, wrote one.
[03:50:17.801 --> 03:50:19.962]  Okay, final straw for Peck with me added another.
[03:50:21.308 --> 03:50:27.294]  When an unflattering quote comes out about someone else or anyone, they all say, I was misquoted.
[03:50:27.294 --> 03:50:28.175]  Everyone does it.
[03:50:28.175 --> 03:50:32.619]  The people who were actually misquoted take legal action and the retraction correction isn't printed.
[03:50:32.619 --> 03:50:35.942]  In fact, that's why newspapers print retractions or corrections.
[03:50:35.942 --> 03:50:39.546]  If Beck doesn't sue USA Weekend, then it tells me his
[03:50:42.708 --> 03:50:44.931]  Pretensions ring hollow, writes another.
[03:50:44.931 --> 03:50:45.511]  And it goes on.
[03:50:45.511 --> 03:50:54.302]  This story is key because people need to know that Glenn Beck is going to support the next banker bailout takeover in the next year and a half.
[03:50:54.302 --> 03:50:57.025]  Mark my words!
[03:50:57.025 --> 03:51:00.729]  You have been warned!
[03:51:00.729 --> 03:51:02.011]  Let's get ready to rumble!
[03:51:03.973 --> 03:51:09.437]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[03:51:09.437 --> 03:51:11.759]  Do you care as much about your air and water?

[03:51:33.496 --> 03:51:42.820]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[03:51:42.820 --> 03:51:49.863]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:51:49.863 --> 03:51:53.805]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[03:51:54.005 --> 03:51:54.945]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[03:51:54.945 --> 03:51:58.646]  It's time to understand the system.
[03:51:58.646 --> 03:52:00.967]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:52:00.967 --> 03:52:06.308]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:52:06.308 --> 03:52:10.329]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:10.329 --> 03:52:13.570]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:13.570 --> 03:52:14.990]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:15.689 --> 03:52:18.351]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:18.351 --> 03:52:24.757]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:24.757 --> 03:52:29.942]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:29.942 --> 03:52:39.951]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:40.051 --> 03:52:42.392]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:42.392 --> 03:52:43.992]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:43.992 --> 03:52:46.453]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:46.453 --> 03:52:48.293]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:48.293 --> 03:52:53.715]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:53.715 --> 03:53:02.818]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:05.177 --> 03:53:07.799]  Men, are you thinking about the health of your prostate?
[03:53:07.799 --> 03:53:13.504]  Recently, New Vitality Health Products gave away thousands of free bottles of the supplement Beta Prostate.
[03:53:13.504 --> 03:53:19.609]  Due to incredible demand, they're giving away more free bottles of Beta Prostate to any new customers who call now.

[03:53:25.894 --> 03:53:26.334]  I think so.
[03:53:47.108 --> 03:53:50.251]  This offer is limited to one free bottle per household.
[03:53:50.251 --> 03:53:52.693]  Give your body nutrition that targets the prostate.

[03:53:55.836 --> 03:53:56.056]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[03:54:12.762 --> 03:54:22.306]  I want to finish up with Glenn Beck, but I want to remind you Nigel Farage, member of the European Union Parliament, who destroyed the head of the European Union, President, live on international television.
[03:54:22.306 --> 03:54:26.388]  He joined us in the second hour, Bob Chapman, and then Prip Tum, as you just heard.
[03:54:26.388 --> 03:54:34.872]  In the first hour, I broke down a host of key issues, including the secret UN document for global government that Fox News and AP are covering.
[03:54:34.872 --> 03:54:36.333]  Before we finish up with Beck,
[03:54:38.168 --> 03:54:39.951]  Because I've been told he didn't respond.
[03:54:39.951 --> 03:54:41.332]  I'm just now reading Watson's article.
[03:54:41.332 --> 03:54:47.121]  He has responded, saying, well, I did say it, but I said a lot of other stuff, and the guy didn't cover it all.
[03:54:47.121 --> 03:54:49.784]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:50.532 --> 03:54:52.653]  We're discovering this here together as we read it.
[03:54:52.653 --> 03:54:59.718]  A few of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible, that are awesome, that I believe in, I think you should support and check out, acolablue.com.
[03:54:59.718 --> 03:55:00.918]  It's an atmospheric water generator.
[03:55:00.918 --> 03:55:02.339]  They've got a bunch of different units.
[03:55:02.339 --> 03:55:04.921]  They've got units that will serve 500 people or 10 people.
[03:55:04.921 --> 03:55:13.526]  The smaller units do 7 gallons a day, and right on up, looks like a water cooler without a water bottle on top, grabs water out of the air, puts it through 7 filters in their baseline unit.
[03:55:13.526 --> 03:55:15.628]  That's kind of overkill, but they've got someone like
[03:55:16.728 --> 03:55:17.609]  12 filters in it.
[03:55:17.609 --> 03:55:19.150]  It says you can't get cleaner water.
[03:55:19.150 --> 03:55:20.891]  Ecoloblue.com.
[03:55:20.891 --> 03:55:23.193]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[03:55:23.193 --> 03:55:26.115]  It's the only way to get 100% of the fluoride out of the water.
[03:55:26.115 --> 03:55:26.175]  800-691-6043.
[03:55:26.175 --> 03:55:26.215]  800-691-6043.
[03:55:32.352 --> 03:55:35.173]  Or acolablue.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55:35.173 --> 03:55:38.735]  Also, I want to thank mysolarbackup.com, the best little solar unit.
[03:55:38.735 --> 03:55:40.997]  You can get a bunch of these, run your whole house.
[03:55:40.997 --> 03:55:46.880]  A solar panel, the battery unit, a control unit, no fumes, no smoke, like a gas generator.
[03:55:46.880 --> 03:55:49.441]  Doesn't run out because the sun's always there.
[03:55:49.441 --> 03:55:50.762]  Mysolarbackup.com.
[03:55:51.522 --> 03:55:57.584]  You can call, get a free brochure, information package, or find out more.
[03:55:57.584 --> 03:56:03.525]  877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or mysolarbackup.com.
[03:56:03.525 --> 03:56:05.045]  Again, that number, 877-327-0365.
[03:56:05.045 --> 03:56:09.126]  Thank the sponsors today, as usual.
[03:56:09.126 --> 03:56:19.849]  Okay, following this outcry, Beck responded by accusing McCafferty of interviewing four of the ten things attributed to him in the article.
[03:56:22.082 --> 03:56:23.763]  of inventing.
[03:56:23.763 --> 03:56:26.264]  Four of the ten things attributed to him in the article.
[03:56:26.264 --> 03:56:29.146]  But since then, Beck made no mention whatsoever of it.
[03:56:29.146 --> 03:56:33.449]  We can only assume his global warming comments wasn't one of them.
[03:56:33.449 --> 03:56:34.609]  So, I mean, he better sue him.
[03:56:34.609 --> 03:56:35.910]  He better do something.
[03:56:35.910 --> 03:56:40.613]  No, the guy can't help but constantly deceive.
[03:56:40.613 --> 03:56:41.313]  It goes on here.
[03:56:41.313 --> 03:56:45.035]  But the calls I'm getting, and I haven't listened all week, is that he's saying that
[03:56:46.616 --> 03:56:57.683]  That it was twisted or something, and then he says in another, from what I've heard, again I haven't confirmed this, well, World Net Daily says he hasn't retracted it, so I don't know.
[03:56:57.683 --> 03:57:10.492]  Since Beck changes his tune every time the wind blows, he was for the bailout before he was against it, we can only assume that the increased suspicion from conservatives over his global warming comments will force Beck to backpedal and issue some form of retraction.
[03:57:10.492 --> 03:57:10.792]  However,
[03:57:12.300 --> 03:57:16.937]  Or some, this will only confirm the fact that Beck is a shill and a performing circus clown who he...
[03:57:18.632 --> 03:57:21.053]  Admits to be, and he also cries on cue.
[03:57:21.053 --> 03:57:23.114]  I would just add, he does say he's a circus clown.
[03:57:23.114 --> 03:57:29.238]  While hoodwinking millions of conservatives into supporting policies which represent the antithesis of true conservatism.
[03:57:29.238 --> 03:57:33.420]  Like a national sales tax, an idea also embraced by Nancy Pelosi.
[03:57:33.420 --> 03:57:37.982]  While attacking people who espouse real conservative principles without consistently flip-flopping.
[03:57:37.982 --> 03:57:41.764]  Like Congressman Ron Paul and his supporters, who he has smeared as potential terrorists.
[03:57:41.764 --> 03:57:43.505]  And we have links to all of that in the article.
[03:57:43.505 --> 03:57:44.626]  Every claim we make, we link to.
[03:57:48.846 --> 03:57:55.689]  Again, the whole point here is it's on record that Sarah Palin believes in global warming.
[03:57:55.689 --> 03:57:57.750]  So does John McCain, who she supports.
[03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:58.991]  And people don't believe that.
[03:57:58.991 --> 03:58:01.292]  Go look it up for yourself.
[03:58:01.292 --> 03:58:05.834]  I wish Glenn Beck was for real, like Judge Napolitano, who's the same today and tomorrow.
[03:58:05.834 --> 03:58:07.255]  Yesterday, today, tomorrow.
[03:58:07.255 --> 03:58:08.516]  I wish he was like Ron Paul.
[03:58:08.516 --> 03:58:08.976]  I wish!
[03:58:08.976 --> 03:58:12.258]  I would love to just totally get behind him, totally support him.
[03:58:12.258 --> 03:58:14.519]  And nobody's perfect, but Beck is.
[03:58:15.479 --> 03:58:16.239]  A actor.
[03:58:16.239 --> 03:58:17.340]  And very dangerous.
[03:58:17.340 --> 03:58:18.340]  Great job to the crew.
