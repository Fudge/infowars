[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:23.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:42.600 --> 00:56.080]  you can't get anything in fact your parents can even go to jail if they
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.520]  don't get you a social security number with aliens not only do we have a social
[01:01.520 --> 01:09.480]  security number for that area of indebtedness but our reservation and all
[01:09.480 --> 01:15.080]  its value including the people on it not only are we indebted on the social
[01:15.080 --> 01:22.280]  security number bit but we're also future the state attorney general of the
[01:22.280 --> 01:27.280]  state of South Dakota and all the other states that have Indian reservations they
[01:27.280 --> 01:32.200]  trade that reservation and the value of that reservation and the value of its
[01:32.200 --> 01:44.120]  people the value of its air the value of its carbon emissions are traded on Wall
[01:44.120 --> 01:50.920]  Street done in Bradst through done in Bradstreet it's listed this value is
[01:50.920 --> 01:57.240]  put into financial instruments that are packaged and repackaged just like the
[01:57.240 --> 02:05.920]  real estate fiasco so we haven't even hit on all these swindles that Wall
[02:05.920 --> 02:14.960]  Street is visiting upon the people of America you're nothing but a bunch of
[02:14.960 --> 02:22.640]  coupons for the United States government and the people who run it that's it
[02:22.640 --> 02:30.680]  American people your commodity and you don't deserve anything else and they're
[02:30.680 --> 02:35.720]  going to make sure you continue to be a commodity as long as the Empire exists as
[02:35.720 --> 02:41.840]  long as you allow the Constitution to be raped
[02:41.840 --> 03:01.800]  this land now filled with Indians that are absolutely dependent on the
[03:01.800 --> 03:15.360]  government for everything for everything at any rate you depend on the
[03:15.360 --> 03:24.960]  government and what you'll end up with is poverty and a lot of paper because
[03:24.960 --> 03:30.640]  everything you do the government requires a lot of paper it to fill out a
[03:30.640 --> 03:37.800]  lot of forms then they have to fill out a lot of forms and then they go up to the
[03:37.800 --> 03:43.200]  next level of government they got to fill out a lot of forms and by the time
[03:43.200 --> 03:50.680]  it gets to where it's supposed to go nothing happens we have government
[03:50.680 --> 03:57.600]  health here our life expectancy if you if you don't count AIDS is the lowest in
[03:57.600 --> 04:06.440]  the world here we are worse off than people in Haiti
[04:08.600 --> 04:23.800]  not only physically but of the heart our spirit our reason to live now you
[04:23.800 --> 04:34.360]  don't want the government taking care of you I do not speak on truths our land
[04:34.360 --> 04:40.520]  held in trust by the federal government so we can't get loans so we can't get
[04:40.520 --> 04:53.840]  businesses that's the more paperwork you have to apply for our casino the money
[04:53.840 --> 04:57.200]  goes first to the Bureau of Indian Affairs then we have to write proposals
[04:57.200 --> 05:03.480]  to utilize the money the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six
[05:03.480 --> 05:08.160]  months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn
[05:08.160 --> 05:12.520]  belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.600]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[05:16.600 --> 05:19.880]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[05:19.880 --> 05:24.400]  the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost in today's prices
[05:24.400 --> 05:28.600]  by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw
[05:28.600 --> 05:32.400]  ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to
[05:32.400 --> 05:36.040]  get your supply I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we
[05:36.040 --> 05:39.200]  have all known this was coming you know about their delicious long-term
[05:39.200 --> 05:43.240]  storable foods the fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and
[05:43.240 --> 05:46.600]  because it stores for 25 years they're locking in today's prices and avoiding
[05:46.600 --> 05:51.760]  the rising food cost don't wait call 800-409-5633 or go to e-foods direct

[06:02.400 --> 06:06.560]  shut down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are losing access
[06:06.560 --> 06:10.440]  not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources
[06:10.440 --> 06:14.120]  for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war
[06:14.120 --> 06:18.000]  on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.200]  not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have
[06:21.200 --> 06:24.200]  been around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for
[06:24.200 --> 06:27.400]  fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[06:27.400 --> 06:32.040]  culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans
[06:32.040 --> 06:36.120]  eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's
[06:36.120 --> 06:39.600]  some good news self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making
[06:39.600 --> 06:43.320]  these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes since
[06:43.320 --> 06:46.600]  it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself for

[08:12.240 --> 08:27.440]  ladies and gentlemen it is the 26th day of October 2012 on this worldwide
[08:27.440 --> 08:32.920]  transmission Friday we are going to have open phones today I have cleared the
[08:32.920 --> 08:40.560]  decks of guests to take your phone calls on the literally literally hundreds
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.000]  and hundreds of important issues taking place out there now I talked about this
[08:46.000 --> 08:53.320]  a little bit yesterday but not as much as I should this storm barreling towards
[08:53.320 --> 09:00.520]  the east coast is estimated by many meteorologists and I've got the articles
[09:00.520 --> 09:06.000]  right here to be the worst storm in a hundred years worse than the perfect
[09:06.000 --> 09:14.640]  storm the last perfect storm of 1991 that luckily turned away from the mainland
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.320]  and went out to sea but you know the movie made out of a book the perfect
[09:19.320 --> 09:23.280]  storm with George Clooney that's based on a true story in Mark Wahlberg it's an
[09:23.280 --> 09:30.960]  excellent film worse storm in 100 years seen for Northeast US and it is set to
[09:30.960 --> 09:39.040]  t-bone October 30th and then make landfall through the 30th 31st and into
[09:39.040 --> 09:46.720]  November 1st this could not be better for Obama you know what kamikaze means it
[09:46.720 --> 09:54.280]  means divine wind because not once but twice giant Chinese fleets were massing
[09:54.280 --> 09:59.200]  it already conquered much of even what's Russia today in Europe they had
[09:59.200 --> 10:03.280]  conquered much of the known world bigger than the Roman Empire not once but
[10:03.280 --> 10:13.040]  twice they were massing off the coast of Japan to invade and numerically outnumber
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.000]  them some estimates for 21 and we're going to be able to take over Japan so
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.400]  Japan would basically be Chinese today or would have been dominated for a large
[10:21.400 --> 10:27.200]  period by the Chinese but along came typhoons they're typhoons in the
[10:27.200 --> 10:30.760]  Pacific hurricanes in the Atlantic typhoons are even much more powerful
[10:30.760 --> 10:36.000]  because there's a larger ocean and the waters are even hotter but that's a side
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.240]  issue what typhoons and get up to like 230 240 miles an hour hurricanes only up
[10:41.240 --> 10:44.760]  to 200 I've had meteorologists and well been living to the father of weather
[10:44.760 --> 10:48.560]  weapons on and when they declassified that he was the father of what weather
[10:48.560 --> 10:53.040]  weapons about seven years ago and that he was the first guy to ever fly into in
[10:53.040 --> 10:58.160]  at the end of World War two into hurricanes into typhoons and he was
[10:58.160 --> 11:02.640]  breaking that down but the reason I go off and digress into that area is this
[11:02.640 --> 11:10.760]  could be the divine wind for Obama this could really let him grandstand as
[11:10.760 --> 11:15.880]  presidential during the emergency and take all the news off of Romney's
[11:15.880 --> 11:22.080]  momentum in fact Romney had been gaining in all the major polls until
[11:22.080 --> 11:26.840]  yesterday across the board and there is some fraud and polls but when you get a
[11:26.840 --> 11:31.440]  large spectrum showing Romney surging and then since the hurricane news took
[11:31.440 --> 11:36.120]  over yesterday I was busy covering police state news and Ted Turner saying
[11:36.120 --> 11:40.560]  he's you know happy and glad and that's good that US troops are dying to quote
[11:40.560 --> 11:44.200]  him said it's good is the exact quote I was so busy covering all the
[11:44.200 --> 11:49.040]  preparations for civil unrest that we know they've told police and military to
[11:49.040 --> 11:53.240]  get ready for for so long they said at the end of October early November you've
[11:53.240 --> 11:56.560]  heard the police on the show you've seen the news articles that they're telling
[11:56.560 --> 12:02.360]  them some giant disaster emergency crisis is going to take place we've
[12:02.360 --> 12:09.480]  talked to police in New York New Jersey as far west as St. Louis and we've
[12:09.480 --> 12:15.720]  gone over the army preparations for it the 1.6 million rounds of ammo and let's
[12:15.720 --> 12:21.840]  just hope that it isn't this storm that provides the the crisis now there are
[12:21.840 --> 12:26.880]  weather weapons and the Stanford Research Institute in 1967 I'm you can
[12:26.880 --> 12:31.960]  go to YouTube or prisonplanet.tv and just type in weather wars weather
[12:31.960 --> 12:37.440]  weapons Ben Livingston I'm extremely tempted to actually go pull that
[12:37.440 --> 12:42.320]  interview with Ben Livingston and play excerpts of it in the third hour and it
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.240]  was in Fox News AP you name it when it got declassified so I thought well he's
[12:46.240 --> 12:49.720]  in Midland Texas let me just call him we called him for the first people to
[12:49.720 --> 12:53.280]  actually interview the guy in the documents and it was how the Stanford
[12:53.280 --> 13:00.120]  Research Institute for the Navy and the Air Force certified in 67 with
[13:00.120 --> 13:05.480]  meteorologist Ben Livingston over at combat vet as well he flew combat
[13:05.480 --> 13:10.960]  missions even in Vietnam leading squadrons in creating you know 10 feet of
[13:10.960 --> 13:14.880]  you know rain and the Ho Chi Minh trail out of clear skies they were able to
[13:14.880 --> 13:19.120]  create clouds and do that he he talks about that in the interview and now
[13:19.120 --> 13:24.240]  there's history channel shows about him and stuff but the point is in 1967 they
[13:24.240 --> 13:31.080]  certified that with 10 aircraft he could create hurricanes he could kill
[13:31.080 --> 13:37.000]  hurricanes he could strengthen hurricanes he could weaken hurricanes so he
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.200]  could create them he could stir them he could make them stronger make them
[13:41.200 --> 13:47.800]  weaker Stanford Research Institute declassify what was it 2006 Ben Livingston
[13:47.800 --> 13:51.960]  weather weapons declassified
[13:51.960 --> 13:57.360]  declassified so they have these they they have not just the old cloud seating
[13:57.360 --> 14:01.760]  and in fact you know this all clicked this morning because I sometimes I
[14:01.760 --> 14:05.040]  miss things I mentioned that yesterday but didn't really get into it yeah this
[14:05.040 --> 14:08.000]  big storms coming I just killed a bunch of people in the Caribbean you know
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.600]  let's hope it weakens but the way the media is hyping this all of us now it
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.160]  may turn out to see it may be a natural storm but the fact is because they have
[14:17.160 --> 14:24.400]  these weather weapons systems we must look at this the worst storm in a hundred
[14:24.400 --> 14:32.280]  years with a perfect West Coast storm set as the storm makes landfall the 30th
[14:32.280 --> 14:39.560]  what's that Monday Tuesday as it makes landfall right through Washington DC and
[14:39.560 --> 14:45.440]  then up into New Jersey New York right as it makes landfall right through DC
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.480]  Maryland and those eastern states there will be a Western front out of the
[14:51.480 --> 14:57.200]  Pacific that's crossed the country back to just cross Texas today it's what's
[14:57.200 --> 15:02.880]  cold here now it's going to hit as a blue norther is coming to hit three of
[15:02.880 --> 15:08.240]  them hitting I mean this is called Frankenstorm now it's already a false
[15:08.240 --> 15:11.160]  flag for Obama whether you support him or not this is what's going on the
[15:11.160 --> 15:16.000]  media is totally focused on this and not Romney's momentum so Romney's momentum
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.440]  is now stalling I've seen it in all the polls some polls show he's even lost a
[15:19.440 --> 15:27.560]  point the last Gallup I saw this morning so so this is all going on this is all
[15:27.560 --> 15:36.280]  happening and magically magically though the worst storm in a hundred years the
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.360]  meteorologist is now saying it's pretty much a done deal now that's not the case
[15:40.360 --> 15:43.880]  they've said that before it could turn out towards the Atlantic and well if
[15:43.880 --> 15:48.080]  you're fishermen you better get out of the way because we're talking about you
[15:48.080 --> 15:52.640]  know 50 foot waves and stuff there if it goes out to sea but we're talking about
[15:52.640 --> 15:57.680]  30 foot waves if it comes in and it right now is gonna just go up the east
[15:57.680 --> 16:03.400]  coast and we'll cause a national disaster there is no doubt this will be
[16:03.400 --> 16:08.280]  declared a national disaster in Maryland New Jersey New York and
[16:08.280 --> 16:13.120]  Connecticut and right up that coast if it if it keeps coming in and keeps
[16:13.120 --> 16:17.320]  coming in with the speed it's got and it runs into a cold front and another cold
[16:17.320 --> 16:21.480]  front to cold fronts from two different angles the north and the west folks
[16:21.480 --> 16:25.040]  that's how you get tornadoes and then they're predicted tornadoes too which
[16:25.040 --> 16:29.840]  you're supposed to only have in the spring because you got hot wet air and
[16:29.840 --> 16:36.400]  fast winds hurricane winds with a big tropical storm and if it's a tropical
[16:36.400 --> 16:39.760]  storm it's going to be disastrous if it keeps speeding up and as a hurricane
[16:39.760 --> 16:45.120]  when it hits Katie bar the door Tuesday when it comes in to Pennsylvania New
[16:45.120 --> 16:52.560]  York Virginia West Virginia Maryland Connecticut I mean when that sucker
[16:52.560 --> 16:56.000]  hits because usually this is hype so I heard against them like yeah right
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.440]  Frankenstorm there's a movie I'll call Frankenweenie you know whatever it's the
[17:01.440 --> 17:05.680]  media you know Carmageddon LA a few years ago they said would be you know
[17:05.680 --> 17:10.400]  into the world I was out there for it just even tourist birthday just so it
[17:10.400 --> 17:15.600]  was out in LA and you know and and so I left like three hours early to the
[17:15.600 --> 17:19.440]  airport and there was no one on the road because everyone was scared at home
[17:19.440 --> 17:22.640]  it up nothing happened because they were fixing one bridge so I was thinking
[17:22.640 --> 17:25.760]  yesterday oh this is exaggerated so I went last night in this morning and
[17:25.760 --> 17:33.040]  started researching it and the fact that it's gonna hit the 30 at 31st 30 first
[17:33.040 --> 17:38.000]  so 30 at 31st the first of November it is gonna be even if it isn't a
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.560]  disaster which I hope it's not it's totally gonna dominate the election now
[17:41.560 --> 17:46.160]  in the final stretch right as Romney was going up and and there will be
[17:46.160 --> 17:50.400]  differences under Romney and Obama there will be Romney said he isn't gonna try to
[17:50.400 --> 17:56.280]  ban handguns and rifles Obama says he is Romney says he won't shut down all the
[17:56.280 --> 17:59.920]  cold power plants Senator Inhofe's gotten the documents that Obama plans to shut
[17:59.920 --> 18:03.720]  even more down if he is reelected Obama will not be facing re-election Obama
[18:03.720 --> 18:08.920]  will have pardon power I don't like Romney you know Romney's a globalist the
[18:08.920 --> 18:14.280]  local Chronicle has a cover that says Prince of Lies and it's true Romney
[18:14.280 --> 18:18.440]  lies and flip-flops quite a bit but I mean Obama when it comes to lying is
[18:18.440 --> 18:24.320]  even worse than Bill Clinton I mean Mitt Romney when it comes to lying is or
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.440]  flip-flopping is what he really does is not even in the same league as Barack
[18:28.440 --> 18:33.400]  Obama the guy that said I don't want the NDA and it turned out his people wrote
[18:33.400 --> 18:36.440]  it and then said well don't worry it's not gonna pass and then it did don't
[18:36.440 --> 18:40.120]  worry I won't sign it and then he did I mean I mean it's that you know launching
[18:40.120 --> 18:45.800]  all these wars but he gets a peace prize so it's peace you know lying and saying
[18:45.800 --> 18:49.880]  that it wasn't a premeditated attack on the Benghazi facility and the ambassador
[18:49.880 --> 18:53.080]  I mean I could go on I won't hire one lobbyist hired more than anybody I
[18:53.080 --> 18:56.880]  won't sign a bunch of executive orders already signed more than Bush in one
[18:56.880 --> 19:03.380]  term on and on and on and on and on and on and on I won't ship General
[19:03.380 --> 19:08.480]  Motors overseas Cadillac Volt ship to China ship to Brazil ship to Eastern
[19:08.480 --> 19:12.680]  Europe and they're now announcing today they're looking at shipping Jeep my dad's
[19:12.680 --> 19:19.840]  got a Jeep great product great Americana the World War two Jeep is now looking to
[19:19.840 --> 19:24.760]  move their factories to China General Motors I mean disgusting you know I've
[19:24.760 --> 19:28.680]  got a Ford now just because you know they didn't take bailout money I'm not
[19:28.680 --> 19:33.320]  even particular Ford fan I'm a fan of what Ford's doing now actually like my
[19:33.320 --> 19:38.600]  Ford vehicle but the point is is that is this is disgusting if they moved Jeep
[19:38.600 --> 19:44.240]  can't we have anything made in America anyways it's all coming up but but this
[19:44.240 --> 19:50.840]  storm look pull up Mumbai guys it's like the Daily Mail and AP you know do buy
[19:50.840 --> 19:54.240]  controlling the weather and it shows the radar towers they've got the control
[19:54.240 --> 19:57.560]  the weather I mean we you know it's 21st century it's Buck Rogers and this
[19:57.560 --> 20:03.720]  storm may be engineered the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six
[20:03.720 --> 20:08.400]  months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn
[20:08.400 --> 20:12.760]  belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[20:12.760 --> 20:16.860]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[20:16.860 --> 20:20.120]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[20:20.120 --> 20:24.680]  the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices
[20:24.680 --> 20:28.840]  by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw
[20:28.840 --> 20:32.640]  ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to

[24:15.200 --> 24:20.160]  and we are back I am your host Alex Jones I want to thank you all for tuning in
[24:20.160 --> 24:25.480]  today I've got Kurt Nemo in there doing an article about the fact that
[24:25.480 --> 24:29.920]  regardless of whether this hurricane is real or manipulated or manufactured
[24:29.920 --> 24:35.280]  which exist it is going to end up helping Obama I don't know if it can
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.760]  completely help him I mean Obama's got election fraud he can use he's got the
[24:40.760 --> 24:43.920]  Supreme Court that'll basically do whatever he wants if it becomes a
[24:43.920 --> 24:47.840]  contested election that's been proven I mean that they've got so-called
[24:47.840 --> 24:52.880]  Republicans on there that are about as conservative as a as a Lenin or Marx or
[24:52.880 --> 24:58.640]  Ingalls for that matter and still though there's a big enough landslide
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.680]  Bev Harris and other top experts that have really been a proven total
[25:02.680 --> 25:06.400]  election fraud in different areas of the country it's still hard to cheat a
[25:06.400 --> 25:12.200]  landslide and you know we saw Reagan behind in 80 until the last week or so
[25:12.200 --> 25:15.640]  and then it was a dead heat it was really a landslide because these polling
[25:15.640 --> 25:22.040]  agencies have been caught over and over again skewing skewing things and again
[25:22.040 --> 25:27.040]  I I'm not gonna cry if Romney loses I'm not gonna cry if Obama loses and it
[25:27.040 --> 25:31.200]  will just be a different monster to deal with a different management team of
[25:31.200 --> 25:40.080]  globalists that we're gonna face quite frankly if Obama wins my radio show will
[25:40.080 --> 25:46.240]  be more popular that's just the way the format works it's the way talk radio
[25:46.240 --> 25:50.920]  works that people will go to sleep talk radio listeners tend to be libertarian
[25:50.920 --> 25:55.520]  conservative they tend to like long form format things not just soundbites they
[25:55.520 --> 26:00.040]  tend to be more highly educated they tend to have higher earnings you just look
[26:00.040 --> 26:05.800]  up these numbers but they tend to also go to sleep when a Republicans in office
[26:05.800 --> 26:13.640]  and so the argument is is Obama so bad and so revolutionary for the globalist
[26:13.640 --> 26:17.800]  and has so many communists and socialists working for him under the New
[26:17.800 --> 26:24.440]  World Order that that that they would accelerate things in that direction so
[26:24.440 --> 26:28.040]  fast and they would really be able to take over and win against us that's one
[26:28.040 --> 26:32.360]  school of thought that it would be so bad you don't want Obama the other school
[26:32.360 --> 26:36.360]  and I don't it's so complex no one can tell the future exactly I don't know
[26:36.360 --> 26:41.520]  what to gauge it as it happens that if it got so bad it will make people wake
[26:41.520 --> 26:45.480]  up it's got to get really bad before it gets better and you know if he gets in
[26:45.480 --> 26:49.280]  that's the direction we've got to go just you know hey look he's bad let's
[26:49.280 --> 26:52.840]  rediscover liberty and freedom big government doesn't work collectivism
[26:52.840 --> 26:56.440]  doesn't work socialism doesn't work it certainly doesn't work when it's got
[26:56.440 --> 27:00.560]  corporate fascist on top of it that use socialism as a tool to disenfranchise
[27:00.560 --> 27:05.320]  and control people and make them dependent and domesticate them so if
[27:05.320 --> 27:10.000]  Obama gets in and I was saying it looked like Romney was going to win unless
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.520]  there's election fraud which we know there is now this storm I've got to be
[27:14.520 --> 27:19.520]  honest I think it spells doom for Romney right now unless it turns out to the
[27:19.520 --> 27:26.320]  ocean it's going to totally blot out his surge it is going to let the media show
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.360]  Obama as presidential and a savior and it could create a civil emergency where
[27:31.360 --> 27:34.640]  there's not even voting on the east coast they're talking about power being
[27:34.640 --> 27:41.040]  out in three to five states isn't that just perfect timing isn't that just
[27:41.040 --> 27:47.840]  perfect timing but again people will continue to listen and talk radio and
[27:47.840 --> 27:53.600]  record numbers ratings will go up and stay up for our main reach that is AM and
[27:53.600 --> 28:02.480]  FM if Obama gets back into office for whatever reason my gut says Romney
[28:02.480 --> 28:05.840]  would probably be better even though for my career it would not be better
[28:05.840 --> 28:11.280]  because he won't be able to get away with as much because of his conservative
[28:11.280 --> 28:16.880]  libertarian base that's just historically what's happened he's got a
[28:16.880 --> 28:19.880]  bunch of neocons around and they may stage a false flag or something and
[28:19.880 --> 28:23.520]  still they won't be able to target libertarians and conservatives and say
[28:23.520 --> 28:27.200]  we're terrorist with Obama you're you're going to see that script
[28:27.200 --> 28:30.560]  see see with Obama we get a bigger audience just from a Machiavellian
[28:30.560 --> 28:35.040]  perspective but it's like Joseph Farrah said
[28:35.040 --> 28:40.800]  it's so bad he may come arrest all of us so it's kind of like you're like well
[28:40.800 --> 28:44.880]  you know things will go into slower motion under Romney
[28:44.880 --> 28:48.240]  maybe but again i don't look at this all cold-bloodily
[28:48.240 --> 28:52.480]  i can get do a cold-blooded analysis of where i see things going
[28:52.480 --> 28:56.160]  i just hear obama saying he's going to ban handguns and rifles in the debate
[28:56.160 --> 28:59.600]  that's what he said and and put just put people on mentally ill lists who aren't
[28:59.600 --> 29:03.280]  even mentally ill outside this the 68 gun control act and just
[29:03.280 --> 29:06.400]  extra judicially put you on a no gun ownership list
[29:06.400 --> 29:10.640]  that's already pretty much a gun they're already putting in things into place
[29:10.640 --> 29:14.240]  that aren't even laws under the atf under obama and when somebody's saying
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.320]  that in the debate i have to at least say well at least
[29:18.320 --> 29:22.000]  Romney isn't openly saying that doesn't mean i'm saying vote for Romney or he's
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.120]  a great guy it's just i cannot sit there and say
[29:25.120 --> 29:28.960]  they are exactly the same they're the same on almost every front except a few
[29:28.960 --> 29:33.120]  things and uh you know obama says you didn't build
[29:33.120 --> 29:35.840]  your business
[29:36.560 --> 29:40.000]  see he's the more extreme version of the new world order puppet
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.600]  candidate all right we're going to get back into a weather manipulation when we
[29:43.600 --> 29:46.160]  get back look it up for yourself all major

[34:25.920 --> 34:30.000]  articles i've got watson doing a report on weather manipulation
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.720]  and will uh this hurricane delay the election and i'm here to tell you
[34:36.720 --> 34:40.080]  they're calling it the worst storm in a hundred years three weather systems a
[34:40.080 --> 34:45.040]  hurricane a blue norther and a pacific cold front full of water
[34:45.040 --> 34:50.480]  all hitting at the same time all hitting at the same time over the most
[34:50.480 --> 34:57.280]  populous area of the united states from dc right through maryland pennsylvania
[34:57.280 --> 35:02.160]  right up into new jersey new york connecticut in the t bone zone
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.240]  and and i've seen the tracks from dozens of universities national
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.000]  weather service we had those up on screen earlier for radio listeners that
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.440]  they want to go to prison planet dot tv and see the fee but anybody can look it
[35:13.440 --> 35:18.320]  up it's all over the news almost every one of them has the hurricane
[35:18.320 --> 35:22.560]  smashing right into the middle of the major
[35:22.560 --> 35:28.800]  atlantic coast of the united states this is extremely
[35:28.800 --> 35:32.720]  serious it's set to start hitting the 30th
[35:32.720 --> 35:40.720]  tuesday right in to the 31st wednesday it is set to hit
[35:40.720 --> 35:44.640]  and then you will see power they're debating whether you're going to have
[35:44.640 --> 35:47.840]  power out in three to five states may be more
[35:47.840 --> 35:50.960]  they're talking about hundreds of thousands out of power
[35:50.960 --> 35:57.280]  per state just pull this up authorities brace for power outages across
[35:57.280 --> 36:02.000]  uh you know eastern seaboard can you imagine this while it goes up the
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.880]  coast the 30th 31st and the first that's four days five days
[36:06.880 --> 36:11.680]  before the election and you know sometimes it takes them
[36:11.680 --> 36:14.960]  a week to two weeks to get all the power back on
[36:14.960 --> 36:19.440]  you know they're going to try to delay the election if it knocks out the power
[36:19.440 --> 36:24.880]  to large cities i mean wow and all the preparation remember
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.200]  october late october early november get ready the police have been told get
[36:29.200 --> 36:32.720]  ready for troops on the streets why are the troops running checkpoints well
[36:32.720 --> 36:37.760]  it's for late october early november east coast east coast east coast
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.600]  false flag east coast dug hagman look for
[36:41.600 --> 36:44.960]  false flag east coast you're like well what's the false flag
[36:44.960 --> 36:48.320]  ladies and gentlemen just type in russia could control the weather china
[36:48.320 --> 36:51.520]  controls the weather u.s controls the weather just type it into a search
[36:51.520 --> 36:54.400]  engine hundreds of mainstream news articles wired
[36:54.400 --> 36:58.880]  magazine Reuters ap ben livingston father of weather weapons
[36:58.880 --> 37:04.160]  fox news info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[37:04.160 --> 37:08.240]  by 67 they certified that the u.s government
[37:08.240 --> 37:13.440]  could create hurricanes kill hurricanes
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.480]  steer hurricanes weaken them or make them stronger
[37:18.480 --> 37:22.320]  and the russians the russian government you can hire the russian government to
[37:22.320 --> 37:25.120]  guarantee you're going to have a clear sky for your parade you can hire the
[37:25.120 --> 37:28.080]  chinese government you can type in the search engine
[37:28.080 --> 37:31.760]  do buy to make the desert green that was like five years ago they've now done it
[37:31.760 --> 37:35.680]  with giant harp antennas just like our government has in alaska
[37:35.680 --> 37:39.440]  and they can do whatever they want their neighbors last time i checked or suing
[37:39.440 --> 37:42.320]  them other countries are saying they're taking their moisture that would
[37:42.320 --> 37:44.640]  come across and fall on their country
[37:44.640 --> 37:48.800]  but just try it do buy to make the desert green with weather manipulation
[37:48.800 --> 37:52.160]  from like five years ago the reason i like it is it shows official government
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.640]  graphics of the big antenna towers and it really shows because it's not just
[37:56.640 --> 37:59.200]  cloud seating this isn't your granddaddy's that's how
[37:59.200 --> 38:02.640]  long weather manipulation has been going on well actually about 150 years ago
[38:02.640 --> 38:06.320]  they started in england with rockets and in pennsylvania and the u.s of all
[38:06.320 --> 38:09.920]  places in the 1860s 1870s they were able to
[38:09.920 --> 38:14.000]  you know start getting that they shot certain salts or certain things
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.080]  into the clouds they could make it rain uh but i mean it's it's been going on
[38:18.080 --> 38:22.400]  since today's your grandpa certified that this is happening here check it out
[38:22.400 --> 38:33.680]  type in do buy do buy to make desert green i'm
[38:33.680 --> 38:37.520]  typing this in here folks i'm obsessed on getting this uh
[38:37.520 --> 38:41.760]  getting this article weather modification
[38:42.640 --> 38:50.400]  modification and we will uh we will dig that up as soon as i get to break i'll
[38:50.400 --> 38:56.080]  be able to find it uh there it is uh abu dhabi scientists create desert
[38:56.080 --> 38:59.280]  rainstorm so there's another one and what report is that out of
[38:59.280 --> 39:02.880]  that's out of a that's the hubbing and post go down and click on the arabian
[39:02.880 --> 39:07.600]  business news guys guys yeah abu dhabi's doing it too but
[39:07.600 --> 39:10.880]  so does do buy the reason i want the daily mail is they show
[39:10.880 --> 39:14.800]  the actual antenna farms and then they have government statements that was the
[39:14.800 --> 39:18.640]  best article ever even it doesn't matter the point is it's there for you
[39:18.640 --> 39:21.920]  i'm sort of obsessing over a particular article uh here are some of the uh
[39:21.920 --> 39:24.880]  because you know because the national media will say oh alex jones is saying
[39:24.880 --> 39:28.880]  that the hurricanes obama did it hey if they certify the government can control
[39:28.880 --> 39:34.000]  hurricanes and create them in 1967 and i've had the father weather weapons on
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.800]  first person interviewing since then he's been all over national tv
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.000]  i'm no rocket scientist i just seen but it's been declassified it's already in
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.040]  the news and there's his name i call and get him on
[39:45.040 --> 39:50.720]  u.s government routinely conducts experiments on weather modification
[39:50.720 --> 39:58.160]  and uh this is uh university of texas newswire daily texan okay there you go
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.480]  control dubai's weather with google weather
[40:02.960 --> 40:08.480]  london telegraph dubai's designer weather since 2001 they have been manipulating
[40:08.480 --> 40:10.880]  and controlling the weather making the desert turn green
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.840]  usa today rain out china aims to control olympics weather usa today and they
[40:15.840 --> 40:20.560]  were able to that's bb that's usa today here's bbc russian
[40:20.560 --> 40:24.080]  appeal of weather control shows the jets doing it
[40:24.080 --> 40:28.000]  china leads weather control race wired magazine
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.280]  russian scholar warns of secret us climate change
[40:31.280 --> 40:35.760]  weapon radio free europe
[40:35.760 --> 40:44.240]  i mean here's science dot com how stuff works so let's get it straight
[40:44.240 --> 40:49.040]  weather control is real not manipulation control
[40:49.040 --> 40:52.560]  they can control especially they've already got storms they can send in
[40:52.560 --> 40:55.520]  aircraft when they've got computer models of how to
[40:55.520 --> 40:59.120]  seed where to do it what's sell the target to steer it
[40:59.120 --> 41:04.800]  kind of like you heard cows so that's how they can steer them they can control
[41:04.800 --> 41:07.840]  them they can strengthen them they can weaken them they can kill them
[41:07.840 --> 41:10.400]  they can create them that's live extents quotes
[41:10.400 --> 41:14.080]  they can make them they can kill them they can steer them
[41:14.080 --> 41:18.320]  they can strengthen them they can weaken them
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.080]  ten aircraft he could do this in the 60s he already proven in the 50s but
[41:22.080 --> 41:26.000]  the government certified it certified that they went off
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.480]  the east coast and did it that's been declassified
[41:30.480 --> 41:34.160]  but back then they went and actually had hurricanes coming into the east coast
[41:34.160 --> 41:39.120]  they would steer them out to sea so let's get this straight
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.600]  they could steer this baby out to sea in fact that's a that's a report right
[41:43.600 --> 41:46.320]  there by the way who's obsessed with this
[41:46.320 --> 41:50.800]  bill gates is investing billions in weather control guys type in bill gates
[41:50.800 --> 41:54.000]  geoengineering bill gates weather control just show them a couple hundred mainstream
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.360]  articles or government documents well of course but they're acting like he's
[41:57.360 --> 42:01.040]  trying to figure it out and saying he's a genius his companies have discovered
[42:01.040 --> 42:07.040]  it he's being handed 50 year old 60 year old 70 year old technology
[42:07.040 --> 42:12.400]  with cloud seeding used in the 50s they were making hurricanes
[42:12.400 --> 42:15.440]  by the 60s they had it down to a science
[42:15.440 --> 42:20.160]  they could steer this out there it is there it is abc news bill gates the
[42:20.160 --> 42:23.120]  hurricane tamer oh isn't he here by the way who's one of the
[42:23.120 --> 42:27.280]  biggest sponsors of abc news look it up he spends hundreds of millions a year
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.320]  on them oh yeah u.s patent office bill gates gets a patent on basically what
[42:32.320 --> 42:35.840]  ben levinston invented and by the way ben levinston got
[42:35.840 --> 42:38.240]  contacted and told him to come on the show anymore
[42:38.240 --> 42:40.720]  he runs one of the biggest weather models over at the time was one of the
[42:40.720 --> 42:42.560]  biggest very old last time i talked to him
[42:42.560 --> 42:45.280]  it's still very sharp i was like 90 years old or something
[42:45.280 --> 42:49.280]  he was the head meteorologist at one of the biggest public weather modification
[42:49.280 --> 42:52.400]  companies where they pay him to make sure the slopes have snow
[42:52.400 --> 42:55.600]  and they go in hit it make sure they get the rain they need
[42:55.600 --> 43:00.800]  big agra hires him with a couple aircrafts they can get that rain they need
[43:00.800 --> 43:04.720]  so it's kind of like i'm up here explaining to people there are
[43:04.720 --> 43:09.520]  automobiles their electricity is real and people are going oh yeah right alex
[43:09.520 --> 43:13.120]  what are you going to tell us next you flip a switch and a light comes on without
[43:13.120 --> 43:17.760]  a fire or a torch yeah right man this is old
[43:17.760 --> 43:21.760]  technology this is real and you've got an election
[43:21.760 --> 43:27.120]  and a hundred years superstorm about to t-bone the east coast
[43:27.120 --> 43:31.440]  with perfect timing to disrupt the election
[43:34.720 --> 43:38.000]  so obama can grant and you know some people are spinning it saying well
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.280]  romney voters are more likely to vote when it's raining
[43:41.280 --> 43:46.240]  or bad weather really a lot of romney voters are very old
[43:46.240 --> 43:49.520]  but but i but i get the fact that you got really old welfare recipients and
[43:49.520 --> 43:53.440]  others that get bused in uh when it's bad weather i get that
[43:53.440 --> 43:57.040]  so i don't know man but let me tell you something here's the deal
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.520]  if the power goes off in three to four to five states in major cities or even
[44:01.520 --> 44:05.200]  sporadic outages they're going to cancel the election
[44:05.200 --> 44:08.640]  or postpone it cancels out the right word they're gonna move it down the road
[44:08.640 --> 44:12.400]  does anyone realize how big a news story this is no one else is talking about
[44:12.400 --> 44:15.920]  this no one else is covering this i've been looking
[44:15.920 --> 44:20.400]  paul watson curtain ammo uh don salazar they're all on it right now with
[44:20.400 --> 44:24.560]  different articles from different perspectives
[44:24.560 --> 44:28.240]  but if this thing doesn't turn and it could be a normal storm it could be a
[44:28.240 --> 44:31.920]  coincidence i'm not saying it's it's it's government
[44:31.920 --> 44:37.040]  i'm just saying it could be that's a fact
[44:37.040 --> 44:44.240]  it absolutely 110 percent in fact guys all these articles you printed for me
[44:44.240 --> 44:46.960]  you can be putting some of those weather modification
[44:46.960 --> 44:51.600]  articles up great job printing these for me so quickly you can be putting
[44:51.600 --> 44:56.240]  those weather modification articles dan or whoever's back there
[44:56.240 --> 45:01.920]  you guys can can put these on screen for the prison planet dot tv viewers
[45:01.920 --> 45:04.720]  because i want people to see these i want you to know
[45:04.720 --> 45:08.880]  that harp was in was designed for over the horizon radar and also to manipulate
[45:08.880 --> 45:12.960]  the ionosphere and to ignite the atmosphere i had the head scientist
[45:12.960 --> 45:16.400]  from harp on six years ago you can look it up alex jones
[45:16.400 --> 45:19.440]  interviews director of harp you can go look it up
[45:19.440 --> 45:22.160]  yeah we can do a document cam shot we can just do that right here
[45:22.160 --> 45:29.040]  yeah just right here so so so we have this going on and so this has to be
[45:29.040 --> 45:35.360]  looked at this has to be broken down we have to look at this we can't just sit
[45:35.360 --> 45:39.360]  here like naive sheep and not realize that that that they
[45:39.360 --> 45:45.120]  can control hurricanes so the question should be why isn't
[45:45.120 --> 45:48.720]  the the weather modification geoengineering obsessed
[45:48.720 --> 45:52.880]  white house with a guy that calls for controlling the weather and hurricanes
[45:52.880 --> 45:55.840]  for our safety john p holdren his first speech
[45:55.840 --> 45:58.640]  three and a half years ago as the new science are
[45:58.640 --> 46:03.280]  was to call for controlling hurricanes look it up ap interview video
[46:03.280 --> 46:06.720]  look it up look it up look it up type in john p holdren calls for geo
[46:06.720 --> 46:09.920]  engineering we'll just show people ap
[46:09.920 --> 46:14.240]  okay this is what's going on
[46:14.240 --> 46:17.920]  there it is dubai's weather wizard can create rain in the desert
[46:17.920 --> 46:21.840]  no kidding and that's just because the Arabs are bragging they've done this
[46:21.840 --> 46:26.000]  they've got the same antenna farms i've talked to some of the technicians
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.800]  outside austin out in bastrop on government facilities
[46:30.800 --> 46:34.080]  they've got them all over they've got heart facilities all over the world
[46:34.080 --> 46:37.520]  they've got them on islands it isn't just the cloud seating
[46:37.520 --> 46:41.600]  they've got antenna farms where they can do whatever they want
[46:41.600 --> 46:44.800]  Abu Dhabi scientists create desert rainstorms report
[46:44.800 --> 46:49.760]  see there it is for you right there great job guys
[46:49.760 --> 46:54.000]  so i'm gonna say it again they can control the weather they can steer this
[46:54.000 --> 46:58.160]  hurricane out to sea they're up there constantly manipulating the
[46:58.160 --> 47:00.720]  weather with jets and aircraft and ground
[47:00.720 --> 47:04.240]  systems they've got ships that have got nuclear reactors on them
[47:04.240 --> 47:08.720]  that have got heart projectors on them they can go in and tune those and do
[47:08.720 --> 47:12.880]  whatever they want with the atmosphere they can make particulate potash but
[47:12.880 --> 47:15.440]  it's not really they think potash will cause nuclear
[47:15.440 --> 47:17.680]  out of form rain that's a small percentage it's
[47:17.680 --> 47:21.920]  there are billions of micro meteorites that's conservative
[47:21.920 --> 47:26.880]  of good size you know grain of sand coming in a day from space
[47:26.880 --> 47:33.280]  uncountable micro particles and other things coming in i mean space is just
[47:33.280 --> 47:37.040]  filled with particles and those are coming in
[47:37.040 --> 47:40.400]  coming into our atmosphere when the sun throws off flares
[47:40.400 --> 47:44.400]  it sends electromagnetic radiation and this is this is mainline science
[47:44.400 --> 47:47.680]  that resonates with that dust that's already coming into the atmosphere
[47:47.680 --> 47:50.880]  that's why when they're solar flares and they hit the side of the planet facing
[47:50.880 --> 47:55.120]  the sun you have rainstorms just everywhere because radiation comes in
[47:55.120 --> 47:59.280]  and then and then ionizes nuclei giving them a charge
[47:59.280 --> 48:02.800]  basically and then that pulls in water vapor
[48:02.800 --> 48:07.200]  forming droplets okay we've had top meteorologists on breaking this down
[48:07.200 --> 48:10.960]  yeah there's some photos of harp is that the heart facility in Alaska or is
[48:10.960 --> 48:13.760]  that another facility yeah that yeah that's Alaska facility i recognize
[48:13.760 --> 48:16.560]  that's how i know that's only one part of it by the way
[48:16.560 --> 48:19.280]  they've got those and if you find the Daily Mail article it's i can't remember
[48:19.280 --> 48:23.520]  the exact headlines we can't find it it'll show those things for weather
[48:23.520 --> 48:26.400]  control just like harp same design and they
[48:26.400 --> 48:29.040]  admit it's for weather control but then harp says it's not
[48:29.040 --> 48:32.160]  and i had the harp director on he started talking and during the break
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.160]  a colonel came on and into the interview
[48:36.160 --> 48:41.600]  even though the director was the civilian had the colonel shut it down
[48:41.600 --> 48:44.400]  i'll never forget you didn't pull up that interview
[48:44.400 --> 48:47.200]  because he started saying too much like yeah we're able to set the atmosphere
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.040]  on fire oh that was it that was it
[48:51.040 --> 48:55.280]  they've got these arrays all over the place they've got radar installations
[48:55.280 --> 48:58.080]  i've talked to technicians they go yeah and then they've got other arrays on
[48:58.080 --> 49:01.120]  top of them and they won't say what they're for but the technicians and
[49:01.120 --> 49:03.760]  scientists they go look it up and go yeah it's a harp
[49:03.760 --> 49:07.200]  weather modification array where they're able to fire this up
[49:07.200 --> 49:11.200]  and imitate the sun but instead of from the from from from space
[49:11.200 --> 49:14.640]  from the center of the solar system it's coming from the ground you understand
[49:14.640 --> 49:18.800]  they fire different types of ionizing waves and
[49:18.800 --> 49:25.040]  radiation up into it to cause the nuclei to to start
[49:25.040 --> 49:29.840]  reacting you found it have scientists discovered how to create
[49:29.840 --> 49:33.040]  downpours in the desert i think that's it yeah yeah showed it shows some of the
[49:33.040 --> 49:36.160]  harp towers yeah no that shows harp towers but
[49:36.160 --> 49:39.040]  it's a different one but notice how it's the same as what you have in Alaska
[49:39.040 --> 49:42.160]  yeah there it is ionizers produce charged particles
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.400]  into the desert air negativity charged ions raise the hot air
[49:46.400 --> 49:50.640]  and attract dust moisture condenses around the charged dust eventually this
[49:50.640 --> 49:58.000]  turns to cloud which produces the rain bingo bingo good good job guys you
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.040]  didn't find the one i want to be found one just as good
[50:01.040 --> 50:04.000]  so so there you go there's nothing worse than having a really good memory and
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.640]  remembering all this but not being able to find all of it
[50:06.640 --> 50:10.960]  so so again i'm ranting here i want your take as meteorologists as weather
[50:10.960 --> 50:17.040]  folks as scientists what is your take on this hurricane a hundred year
[50:17.040 --> 50:21.120]  worst storm in a hundred years seen for northeast u.s bloomberg
[50:21.120 --> 50:26.160]  trinket storm set to careen right into virginia
[50:26.160 --> 50:31.360]  new jersey pennsylvania new york canada kit
[50:31.360 --> 50:35.680]  road island you name it what do you make of that
[50:35.680 --> 50:39.120]  i mean the biggest concentration of people in the country and they're on the
[50:39.120 --> 50:41.840]  news that print me some of those just so i can actually show people
[50:41.840 --> 50:44.880]  you know that they're expecting power outages all over the northeast right
[50:44.880 --> 50:49.360]  before the election and obama will have to pose as the savior
[50:49.360 --> 50:52.800]  oh and it will block out all the news of romney surge
[50:52.800 --> 50:57.600]  hey hey if this isn't staged obama ought to be
[50:57.600 --> 51:01.040]  thinking as lucky stars we'll be right back
[51:01.040 --> 51:05.040]  erin full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the amish and small
[51:05.040 --> 51:09.040]  farmers americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses
[51:09.040 --> 51:12.480]  but to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut
[51:12.480 --> 51:14.640]  yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[51:14.640 --> 51:18.480]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly i'm not
[51:18.480 --> 51:21.520]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[51:21.520 --> 51:24.400]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for
[51:24.400 --> 51:27.600]  fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[51:27.600 --> 51:30.080]  culture even today japanese eat miso
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.600]  africans eat fermented porches koreans eat kimchi and in india
[51:33.600 --> 51:36.960]  fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news
[51:36.960 --> 51:40.240]  self-reliant americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing

[54:01.680 --> 54:10.880]  i can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
[54:10.880 --> 54:16.320]  and i see a hurricane with a blue northern and a pacific cold front three
[54:16.320 --> 54:19.040]  of them set to converge on the most
[54:19.040 --> 54:24.880]  populous area of the u.s four days before the election
[54:24.880 --> 54:28.240]  and they're saying power outages are expected if it hits
[54:28.240 --> 54:31.360]  all over they're saying they could be without power in some areas
[54:31.360 --> 54:37.200]  for weeks what are they going to do they're going to move the election back
[54:38.880 --> 54:41.760]  we need to start letting the government know they need to make plans just
[54:41.760 --> 54:47.200]  because this convene storm came along to get people to be able to vote
[54:47.760 --> 54:51.520]  again ladies and gentlemen they can control hurricanes they've controlled
[54:51.520 --> 54:54.480]  them in the past this is perfect timing that it's in
[54:54.480 --> 54:58.000]  that area of the country at this time right before the
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.440]  election and they have these technologies that's a fact
[55:03.520 --> 55:07.120]  but see we're like cavemen or something oh there's no way they've got flying
[55:07.120 --> 55:11.360]  metal birds there's no way they've got pacemakers
[55:11.360 --> 55:16.000]  there's no way they've got computers there's no way come on it's 1950
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.560]  you know they they can't control the weather folks they can control the
[55:18.560 --> 55:21.920]  weather the russian government came out and set all those fires and drought
[55:21.920 --> 55:26.080]  they thought nato was doing it they've built harper rays all over western
[55:26.080 --> 55:29.360]  europe on the russian border and the rain comes right up
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.680]  and then just stops they can turn those things and direct
[55:33.680 --> 55:37.200]  where it's going to rain they can make it rain there instead of raining
[55:37.200 --> 55:41.440]  here and they've got computer models i mean it is
[55:41.440 --> 55:44.160]  amazing this stuff is real i just showed people watching on
[55:44.160 --> 55:48.240]  prism planet dot tv literally dozens of articles mainstream news bill gates
[55:48.240 --> 55:53.360]  involved in it all of it playing god
[55:53.360 --> 55:57.360]  so here's the question uh we're gonna try to get the meteorologist from
[55:57.360 --> 56:00.880]  weather wars on also who's that top meteorologist from
[56:00.880 --> 56:04.080]  england uh that we that that we get on sometimes
[56:04.080 --> 56:08.160]  it'll pop in my head in a moment the point is we need to break down weather
[56:08.160 --> 56:12.080]  modification here and and look at this but but let's just say it
[56:12.080 --> 56:15.600]  isn't weather modification magically here comes the hurricane if it hits like
[56:15.600 --> 56:20.320]  all the major computer model show on the east coast the 30 of 31st
[56:20.320 --> 56:24.000]  can you imagine how that will take out of the news
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.720]  obama's implosion in the polls which is now suddenly stopping
[56:28.720 --> 56:33.120]  here's the toll-free number to join us for just to see if you can get through it
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.400]  first meteorologist uh weather reporters people who have a
[56:38.400 --> 56:43.360]  take on this scientist hydrologist uh i'd like to hear from you
[56:43.360 --> 56:50.080]  800 259 92 31 800 25 99 231
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.520]  whereas i'm not a meteorologist or hydrologist i i've interviewed many of
[56:53.520 --> 56:56.640]  them uh whereas i'm not a computer expert i don't
[56:56.640 --> 57:00.240]  even know how to run a regular computer i just know how the master systems work
[57:00.240 --> 57:03.440]  and where the trends are going in general architecture
[57:03.440 --> 57:08.240]  and i can tell you that uh this weather control is real it's on record and it's
[57:08.240 --> 57:12.880]  going on and we're in 2012 imagine a science fiction
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.160]  book written a hundred years ago you know we're corrupt presidents control you
[57:16.160 --> 57:19.120]  know the government and they want somebody in power or they want a
[57:19.120 --> 57:23.440]  crisis or they want to what does the department of random 200 say
[57:23.440 --> 57:30.480]  1973 declassified 1991 look it up it says we will use famine and war
[57:30.480 --> 57:35.040]  and also other medical systems they don't really say what those are
[57:35.040 --> 57:38.880]  to reduce population by at least 50 we will tell governments reduce your
[57:38.880 --> 57:42.320]  population or you won't get imf world bank loans
[57:42.320 --> 57:46.080]  well weather weapons are used to then destroy crops
[57:46.080 --> 57:50.240]  they used them on the north vietnamese communist
[57:50.240 --> 57:53.200]  that's been declassified and they did kill their crops they had to ship in food
[57:53.200 --> 57:55.920]  from the russians they stopped rain in the north
[57:55.920 --> 58:00.080]  flooded the middle area of the ho Chi Minh trail that's on record
[58:00.080 --> 58:04.160]  that's in the 60s bin levingston led squadrons in
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.640]  that guy was incredible world war two fighter pilot you name it
[58:08.640 --> 58:14.000]  you know a middle-aged meteorologist in vietnam leading squadrons in sometimes
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.920]  seven days a week attacking the north vietnamese with weather weapons
[58:17.920 --> 58:23.200]  pretty cool guy i mean just amazing uh people like that but the point is
[58:23.200 --> 58:27.920]  is that now what do they have today i mean look at the timing of this i want
[58:27.920 --> 58:33.200]  your take 800 259 9231 call us meteorologist
[58:33.200 --> 58:36.240]  for weather manipulators i know there's a lot of private companies 800
[58:36.240 --> 58:47.120]  259 9231 this is gcn the genesis communications radio
[58:47.120 --> 58:50.800]  network
[58:50.800 --> 58:54.880]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[58:54.880 --> 58:58.960]  the hottest half year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in
[58:58.960 --> 59:03.200]  drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat
[59:03.200 --> 59:07.200]  are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing
[59:07.200 --> 59:10.640]  farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only
[59:10.640 --> 59:14.800]  strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by
[59:14.800 --> 59:18.800]  getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw
[59:18.800 --> 59:22.560]  ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to
[59:22.560 --> 59:25.120]  get your supply i recently increased my supply from
[59:25.120 --> 59:28.320]  e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know about their
[59:28.320 --> 59:32.560]  delicious long-term storable foods the fact is you can eat it anytime to save
[59:32.560 --> 59:35.040]  money today and because it stores for 25 years
[59:35.040 --> 59:38.160]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost don't

[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.760]  giant weather systems right before the election
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.520]  worst storm in 100 years they're calling it an order of magnitude worse than the
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.200]  perfect storm of 1991 and i and i mean i've looked at the
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.400]  national weather service i've looked at meteorologists i spent a lot of time when

[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.080]  and it looks bad let's hope it turns out to the ocean
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.800]  but uh this will get obama's plunge in the polls out of the news it'll let him
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.840]  grandstand as a great leader and it could have it kept
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.560]  knocked enough power off which they're saying it's going to do
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.480]  postpone the election and nobody's talking about that

[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.560]  all the he can list the patents the manipulation he'll have it all on bill
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.760]  gates all the control heck he's the best to get
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.960]  they're all great we'll get the weather wars meteorologist on
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.600]  what's his name i forget a name on in years uh bedondi knows he just called
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.920]  him he's the weather war scott stevens i want him
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.800]  i want all the other talk show hosts are taking notes right now good all i want
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.520]  the truth to get out i'm gonna talk about this briefly when we come back and
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.440]  then go to your calls i don't mind when we break a story at
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.400]  info wars dot com and prison punna dot com
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:25.280]  and it it gets it it goes viral and and we don't get the credit but
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:31.200]  when it happens every day it's annoying but but still the good thing to know is
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.080]  at least we're able to set the agenda more and more
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.600]  and able to get people to look at what we're talking about
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.200]  but i'm just shocked by glenn beck and fox news
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.360]  and bright bart and dozens of publications
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.600]  human events uh you name it hollywood reporter
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.200]  saying that bright bart broke the news of ted turner
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.560]  saying it's good that u.s trips committing suicide we have it time stamped
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.800]  we put it out at nine o'clock in the morning right bart did it a few hours
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.400]  later they even edited our video and just cut out our text
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.160]  beck linked our video but to somebody's copy of it so it wouldn't be our channel
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.720]  and i mean it's like come on when you break something we link to you i mean i
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.000]  bright bart does a good job overall when beck does a lot of good work
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.560]  you know that's why i love drudge report dot com
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.160]  drudge report is you know the king daddy of it all when it comes to be able to
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.640]  set the agenda and really break news and drudge gives us credit
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:32.880]  and uh it's just so weird like every day now
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.480]  we have news that gets picked up and goes viral that's it's important
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.520]  you know that we fair it out that we wasn't hard to ferret it out it was on
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.880]  cnn nobody reported on it i was wrong i said it was monday it was last
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.480]  it was last friday he went on so took him like five six days
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.760]  for us for our listeners our listeners pointed this out hey he said it's good
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.960]  the troops are dying we write a report it becomes a big national story
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.720]  and nobody points out we're the first people and then they say bright bart
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.880]  broke it it's even worse that they say they broke it

[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.520]  getting us used to them to whenever they want
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.560]  that is all they are doing and you know collectively we're going to destroy
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.480]  ourselves if we don't start standing up against corruption and evil
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:32.320]  it's very simple okay look i've got so much news here uh if you
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:36.160]  just joined us the the last hour i uh broke down
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:41.120]  the worst storm in a hundred years seen to hit the northeast u.s. that's
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.600]  bloomberg i know you already know about frankenstorm
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.200]  and the reporters are giggling and snickering about how it's a blue norther
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:54.160]  set to hit hurricane sandy the night of the 30th
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.240]  five days before the start of the election the election's already on going
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.120]  with early voting and absentee voting so it'll disrupt that
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.560]  they're saying three to five states are to have partial to full
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:09.440]  power outages they've had the power go off on the east coast before when a
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.280]  limb fell off and if you look at that's the national
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.440]  weather service that's that's no as track has it going right in
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.440]  uh above virginia into pennsylvania new york new jersey
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.120]  you guys show show the track map they have a track map showing all the
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.400]  universities and different computers what they estimate they pretty much all
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:34.000]  estimate smashing sometime uh tuesday evening tuesday morning
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.640]  uh into the east coast right before election day
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:46.560]  the worst storm they've said in a hundred years
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.200]  yeah there's the storm tracks all of them
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.920]  except two have it hitting the east coast
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.840]  well no i guess the one the one that goes out out to the ocean actually goes
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:05.760]  in to uh what is that south carolina
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.200]  yeah it goes into south carolina goes into north carolina goes around
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:13.360]  through west virginia down into tennessee
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.200]  and then back down through georgia
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.040]  oh boy what a night or alabama what a nightmare situation
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.240]  so out of what is that 20 something tracks let's put that back up there and
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.480]  look at that and if you're a radio listener we're
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.520]  streaming video at prison body dot tv but i can verbally
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.720]  audibly go over this for you yeah every track has it hitting the u.s
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.280]  some of the tracks have it going into main so that you have some of the track
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.960]  showing it going into main and then only hitting like boston you know
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.480]  massachusetts connecticut places like that but most of them
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:54.000]  the most probable ones in noah's all have it going in just north of
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.960]  virginia into maryland pennsylvania new jersey new york
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:04.800]  most populist areas of the united states how many people live over there
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:10.960]  at 40 million or something ridiculous uh so so that's all set to go on we pray
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.680]  for everybody there and hopefully it'll magically turn out
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.480]  because you know the government can control hurricanes i just covered that
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.240]  the entire last hour i want to go to your phone calls now
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.600]  but i just went over a whole laundry list of mainstream news how bill gates
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.120]  can control hurricanes and how in the 60s they certify the
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.080]  stanford research institute the military could control them with ben
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.360]  livens and the father of weather weapons we've interviewed
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.800]  and history channel reports on it discovery channel and
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:44.400]  ap royers bloomberg usa today bbc all saying the government can create
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.560]  can kill can strengthen can weaken and can steer
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.240]  hurricanes and they're having these ethical debates about
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.840]  since bill gates invented this and he's got the patents now
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.200]  they're allowing him to patent stuff has been around for 40 years at least
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:04.080]  uh i showed that abc news headline oh he bill gates the hurricane killer look
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.560]  this up if you're tuning in go on listen to this
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.440]  conspiracy theory this is a hundred percent admitted
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.120]  so why aren't they out there staring it out to see
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.160]  well instead meteorologists are saying they never seen anything like this they
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.200]  believe this only happens once every 100 years they're not even sure it's ever
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.640]  even happened like this three weather systems to collide
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.080]  at the exact same time it's not like two of them come in and sit there and
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.200]  collide the nether hits they're all set in the computer models
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.800]  to come together at the same time do you know what that means
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.600]  that's how you get tornadoes when hot air hits cold air
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.960]  you get three different weather systems too cold air
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.800]  with different humidities that can already cause super storms
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:52.400]  with another giant wet hot hurricane oh coming in we're talking
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:59.040]  crazy land and it's set to hit right on time the 30th and 31st

[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.880]  for him and um even overseas and stuff um i guess
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:50.560]  i figured it was for um for farmers you know for areas that need rain
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:55.920]  and stuff like that so yeah it's true it is it's it's true

[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.960]  different ones that i mean they could either spray it out a little
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.360]  outlets on the plane or they fire cartridges that burn like rockets
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.720]  and kind of it burn or explode releasing particulate yeah
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.160]  they can fly right into cells and increase them or weaken them depending
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.240]  on what they want on a other on another um

[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.800]  there's weather modification i mean they admit there is but it's just
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.920]  best to ignore that i know this they could stir these
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.760]  hurricanes out to see why don't they do that well there's treaties saying they
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.280]  can only manipulate weather within the countries themselves
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:19.200]  there's a 1978 treaty on weather modification

[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.040]  and just flood them sometimes seven days a week
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:55.360]  getting shot at pretty amazing guy his interviews on prison planet dot tv
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.040]  in fact i'm going to have in paul watson's articles i know it's on youtube too
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.960]  uh we we recently put it up there it's like six years old so it was on google
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:06.560]  video really low quality but paul watson's got an article coming out
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.720]  we'll uh we'll uh get it in there for you i mean do you think i mean we know
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.640]  they have weather control that's certified they can make hurricanes control
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.920]  them steer them you name it but i mean what about the timing of this
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.320]  three super storms it's not just a hurricane set to hit each other at the
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.680]  same time well i think it's weird because i used
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.240]  to live in east coast there's never a hurricane now
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.240]  it's just you never there's never a hurricane in end october so i've never
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.960]  seen that happen but um it's just it's it's very
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.240]  weird it's very convenient but the other thing this guy said
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.200]  which i thought i wanted to tell you was uh he uh he said global warming is a
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.560]  hope for going into um an ice age so i thought that was really
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:52.080]  interesting so well all meteorologists who have
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:57.200]  any brain cells know that um i mean it gets hot it gets cold but if you
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.400]  look at the trend going back over the ice core samples they've got going back
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.200]  millions of years uh we have been in a off and on ice age
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:09.680]  period every 15 000 years the last few hundred thousand
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:12.800]  drifting towards another super ice age starting up
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.640]  that will send glaciers all the way down to the texas coast
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.200]  that's why you'll be driving through cornfields and seeing a giant boulder
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.360]  out there by itself it's it's a glacial alluvial
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.400]  rock uh and you know that's why out by lake travis outside austin
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.960]  sometimes you know they run into dinosaur bones from canada
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:35.920]  and giant foot because they were pushed here by glaciers
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.680]  uh and yeah that's the trend is towards an ice age
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.520]  that's why the bilgerberg group and club of rome actually in the 60s wanted to
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:47.680]  do geoengineering uh to make the earth hotter and they
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.640]  wanted to have a global government their excuse was save us from the ice age
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.920]  which actually made more sense but then they had a little warming period their
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:56.640]  short warming periods and so they said well we'll just
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.200]  hype this for now to get power but yeah you're absolutely right
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.480]  yeah i'm just i'm just i'm just concerned if you know if we do go into an ice age
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.960]  and we make most of the world's food in america what's gonna i mean
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.320]  a drought is going to be the least of our problems if we just have all freeze
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.320]  and when we freeze out all the food there's going to be a huge crisis
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:22.720]  well here's the deal uh the globalists started in the 50s with
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.160]  you know high-tech weather modification research billions of dollars spent
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.000]  every few years on it if you look at the numbers
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.320]  yeah we know about the spinning it's not exactly what they're doing because
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.200]  that's classified but part of it's been classified over the decades it's been
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.640]  going on so long and they said we need to be able to stop a new ice age and
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.600]  things that's what i was just saying the problem is they're just using it on
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:46.320]  futures markets like you said to destroy different uh companies crops and
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.320]  things that aren't part of the global new world order
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:54.240]  we're right back we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:59.120]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:05.040]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:09.120]  the hottest half year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.960]  drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.960]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:20.400]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.800]  the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost in today's prices
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:28.720]  by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.920]  raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices too
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:35.680]  now is the time to get your supply i recently increased my supply from e-foods

[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:47.840]  into this house we're born until this world we're thrown into this world we're thrown
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:51.600]  we are back live like a dog without a bone and
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:58.000]  actor out alone riders on the storm best part's coming up
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.360]  there's a killer on the road take a long holiday his brain is
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:11.600]  where i've been like you told let your children play
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:16.960]  let your children play if you give this man a ride
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.240]  if you give this man a ride we've got to collectively
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.400]  not give the new owner a ride on our back we gotta say look
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.720]  we don't trust you we don't like you get out of our lives
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.320]  i'm gonna go back to your calls here in a moment talking about weather
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.400]  modification the super storm but i heard the austin police chief
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.000]  on news radio 590 today he's been a guest in here three or four times
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  r-day saveta and he was saying look you know when
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.680]  we catch police officers lying on reports that's a crime and so i will
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:56.880]  fire you if you lie on a report because it discredits the
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:01.360]  entire police department and the public has no trust in the government anymore
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.560]  it's at record lows that's a paraphrase but he basically said just that
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:08.400]  i meant to tell you guys to call k lbj or one of our affiliates and ask them to
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.720]  computer that clip over but it doesn't matter
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.280]  because i didn't actually hear him on the show he was on the morning show with
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:18.640]  mark ed and sergeant sam my friends and they were playing clips of it on the
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:23.120]  news is what i heard but the point is is that i went and pulled the article up
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:27.680]  apd officer fired for lying is fighting to get
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:32.480]  their job back and you know my issue on this is
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:38.800]  why is the police union defending this officer that
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:43.520]  punch this person in the face and saying it's okay to lie
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:48.000]  i mean i find that to be you know really really
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:53.280]  really really disgusting my headset got unplugged here
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:36:01.200]  and again some home some drunk person um reportedly spit in the cop's face
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.120]  and so they punched him in the face which i would probably do too
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:08.560]  and then they lied on the report about it why not just say i punched him because
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.440]  they spit in my face he wouldn't get in trouble and the police didn't even said
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.640]  that it's the culture of lying
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.400]  and again this is a nationwide show i just found it very very refreshing that
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.080]  art a saveta who i've been at odds with over some of the things he's done
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.320]  um i'll say this he's gotten police out of paramilitary uniforms back into
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.920]  regular police uniforms i'll say this now when cops shoot somebody in
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.880]  the back and it's proven that they did it wrongly
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:40.320]  they get in trouble you didn't even get in trouble
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.720]  so austin more and more is becoming a model police department versus
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.600]  some of these scary ones like the new york police department but that's a side
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.560]  issue i just can't believe that the police union
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:54.000]  head was on the radio today on the news
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.480]  saying that this this this officer should not have gotten in trouble for
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:02.880]  lying uh it's a felony to lie on a police report
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:07.040]  last time i checked and i've run into cops lying about me
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.160]  where it's clearly a lie and it's very upsetting when a guy in a uniform
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.280]  is shitting they're lying to someone about you when they supposedly
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:18.880]  are this authority figure and someone who's you know of the highest you know
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:23.200]  quality uh and i that's i've gotten very mad repeatedly
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.640]  when cops start lying and that is you want to punch my buttons man
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:29.840]  that is one of my buttons
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:34.240]  and i've i grew up watching cops plant drugs on people and of course a lot of
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.400]  them ended up going to jail where i lived in rock wall
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:43.600]  sheriff's department people um so i guess they got theirs in the end it's
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.960]  just that i've seen tyranny and let me tell you it
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.760]  didn't pretty so i know there are a lot of good
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:52.800]  police in this country and i guess one of them you know more and more is already
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.280]  savannah last time he was here you know i disagree
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.320]  with some of the stuff he does getting federal money and doing
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.600]  blood draws and all the rest of this garbage that i know is unconstitutional
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.000]  uh you know he took me side and he goes you know i used to hear you when i first
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.040]  moved here and thought you were out of it but i looked a lot of it up and it's
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.640]  crazy and uh he said some other stuff to me off record but that wasn't off
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:13.360]  record but i could tell he was genuinely starting to
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:19.040]  wake up and i and i see this as evidence of that you know the the only way
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:22.720]  well that we're going to get out of this is to not be corrupt ourselves and
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.320]  that means me i mean i work to not do bad things
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.840]  and i'll tell you something when i do them i own up to him
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:35.360]  owning it is what it's all about and the police even said
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.680]  punch the person in the face we're spitting on him that was witnessed
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.440]  that's the person assaulted you it was probably a little you know
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.600]  more than you should have done but it's a it's a it's a thing of passion
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:54.880]  wouldn't have gotten trouble but you lied about it on a police report
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.800]  i mean i see countless videos where the police beat people up
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.320]  and then call it assault that the person put their arm up when they're on the
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.600]  ground being beat up and then juries see that and they go yeah
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:11.200]  that's an assault or resisting to put your arm up no it's not
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.400]  i saw another article today of someone in diabetic shock
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:19.120]  being tasered by police the person runs off the road
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.160]  cops get called they get there they say get out of the car the person's
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:26.240]  drooling in diabetic shock so they start tasering them
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.840]  and i see this every couple days now where someone's having a seizure
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.920]  or there's a new video out speaking of who needs to be fired
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:37.440]  that we're going to play in the next hour video cop shoves crippled woman
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:41.200]  with cerebral palsy this is the most pitiful clip i've ever seen
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.120]  this uh older woman is hobbling along obviously
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:48.880]  having trouble walking you know when you see somebody like that you get out of
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:55.520]  their way you open doors for them you know you you you have pity on them
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.840]  i think about i f in fact maybe we should play it and and and then go to rick
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.440]  and others and we have an engineer also wants to talk ted
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.440]  back go ahead start rolling the video for radio listeners just in the background
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:13.760]  but the point is i think my grandmother who got polio back in the 1950s
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:16.240]  and you know she refused to be in a wheelchair she'd probably be dead today
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:20.880]  if she hadn't she's almost 90 and
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:26.160]  oh this is so pitiful to see this this this this this woman
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:33.200]  you know who's clearly crippled uh and like thugs out of a science fiction
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:36.800]  movie or out of some third world country the police
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.640]  because she's walking and they're gang members
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.240]  it's a huge open street sidewalk she's they got plenty of room to go around her
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.920]  step aside they shove her down to the ground i mean just
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.920]  that's exactly how new york cops act and i'm not saying there aren't some nice
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.320]  ones because i've run into some of those two that are listeners but they're by
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:59.280]  and large they're gang members in uniforms and it says if you want to
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.240]  understand the disdain cops have the general public
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:06.160]  see how this article just for information liberation is a good side
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:09.040]  they're just saying all cops see how you're getting all getting guilty because
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.520]  of this i don't think that's right though it's
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:14.960]  kind of like veterans some of them do bad things that are all veterans bad
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.600]  just watch this video a few dozen times in it vancouver police officer walking
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.480]  down the street with the two fellow gang members
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.360]  comes upon a clearly disabled woman yeah hobbling bent over
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:31.280]  she obviously can't even see him she's she's and shoves her to the ground when
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.400]  she tries to walk between them and his fellow thugs
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:38.320]  who were taking up most the entire sidewalk you know what it's not just
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:41.280]  cops i've been on the hike and bike trail and i like
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.640]  i like mountain biking but me richard reeves and i the other day hiked
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:49.920]  eight miles down 360 all the way to barton springs
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.960]  and we get there and they go woody urlson was just here you missed him again
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:56.080]  he was talking about you which is driving me up the wall because we always
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.960]  hear when woody's in town richard linkletters like yeah woody wants to
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.080]  go on your show call woody's publicist never get a call back but
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.680]  side issue just weird to like miss him twice the last week
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.440]  and the entire time what some areas would be like 10 feet wide paths
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:13.520]  we'd be over on the side and these bike riders would come three abreast
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.440]  and and richard goes richard steps aside for him he goes that's just the etiquette
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.600]  you have to step aside and i want to step it aside and some of these guys would
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:25.120]  actually bow up and come close to me and i'm not looking for a fight but she
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.680]  running to me on purpose you're going to get your you know you're going to get
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.400]  attacked right back i mean it's just i guess
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:33.760]  that's how government works if you coward to people over and over again
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:37.840]  they start to dance they're right because i was like
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.640]  now some of them were polite and would say you know thank you for stepping aside
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.520]  sometimes it'd be a small path and we'd step aside for the bike riders them to
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:45.760]  get off their bike but i mean when you're like a 10 foot
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.320]  flat path and these bike riders are think feeling it's like road rage all
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.520]  these wimps feel powerful in their car until they actually
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:58.880]  you know get to fight with somebody and you watch this video let's show it one
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:01.760]  more time and i'll narrate it and then go to calls i promise for rick and ted
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:04.640]  i'm going to here in just a moment talking about weather modification
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.920]  this video is so incredible you've got this woman
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:14.160]  hobbling around down the street you've got cops
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:19.600]  walking with aggressive gang member stances you've got a handicapped woman
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.800]  and by the way there's there's other people in the street she can't get out
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.960]  of their way because of a man kind of walks towards her
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:28.240]  so she steps over to go between the cops
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.480]  and they shove her down man i tell you and you know now you will be arrested
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:37.680]  in north korea if you don't bow to a cop life in prison
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.880]  and that's where we're going north korea you want it you got it
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:50.800]  man unbelievable unbelievable that guy should be drummed out of there and
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:54.320]  those other police that sat there and stand around like gang members and laugh
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.640]  better on the ground they should all be be immediately fired
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.400]  and and and that guy should be charged for assaulting a woman if we won't protect
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:06.160]  women and handicapped people folks we won't protect anybody
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:09.360]  but you hear all the comedians make fun of cripples all day
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:14.000]  every time i tune in every time i tune in to talk radio
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.160]  on on the wild band on on on satellite radio man
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.080]  that's like the hot thing is to make fun of mentally retarded people and handicaps
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.760]  and folks and it just makes me sick all right i know i'm ranting i'm gonna shut
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.440]  up folks the big news here if you just joined us
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.280]  is worse storm in a hundred years seen to hit the northwest u.s
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:37.120]  hurricane sandy wallow blue norther is coming down set to hit at the exact
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.720]  time when it's most explosive cold air hitting hot
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:44.080]  you know you know caribbean heated up water and air
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:48.560]  and then you've got a big western storm blowing in full of water that's cold
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:52.160]  out of the pacific they said they've never even heard of anything
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.880]  like this it's so incredible so they're calling it a hundred year
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.200]  frankenstorm and do anybody think this is going to hit the 30 at 31st
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:03.280]  five days before the election november 6th
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:09.600]  that that this could be used to postpone the election unheard of
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.600]  okay let's go to your phone calls let's go to rick skywarn i guess that
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.440]  a company worker uh listening on the gcm live.com streams
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.160]  rick go ahead sir give us your take on this we'll go to ted the engineer in
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:24.800]  new york yes uh good afternoon alex god bless
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:28.480]  enjoy listening to your show first time call in
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:35.520]  um yeah skywarn what we uh what we are a lot of our folks in skywarn we are in
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:40.640]  also amateur radio uh we are volunteers for the national
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:45.440]  weather story oh that's right i saw a guy got taken in by the fbi for
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:48.960]  one of the volunteers for taking photos for nela a few weeks ago
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:54.400]  yeah and uh we we had some guys here that had some
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.680]  mysterious stuff um they were sitting around watching
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:05.280]  air force one come in uh you know what we're in an area here where uh
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:09.440]  in ohio where they uh usually come in for their
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:15.600]  um during their campaigns and uh the uh
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.240]  hacker in canton area and uh a couple of our guys
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:24.720]  got uh you know they come storm in their cars because they had
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:28.880]  you know they have antennas on their cars and light bars for uh well yeah i mean
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:32.960]  they're a little nervous because 10 000 missiles got given to al qaeda 2000 of
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:38.480]  them heat sinking and radar guided uh so yeah it's our government gave them
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.120]  that so they're pretty paranoid when you're hanging out out by airports but
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.680]  listen what's your point on weather modification
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:49.840]  i've been seeing a lot of uh in of the uh chemical type trails uh
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:53.360]  you know going on and uh you know i've been having a lot of
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.480]  sinus issues going on i hear a lot of other people
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:00.880]  you know complaining about the sinus problems you know i mean all you got to
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:05.040]  do is you know look to the skies and you can see some of the weird stuff going on
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:08.000]  up there and oh i've had countless meteorologists
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.840]  on and played clips of meteorologists on the news saying look at all these
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.560]  trails coming in that's not natural that's being sprayed
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.840]  they admit this modification is going on i appreciate your call
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:22.000]  let's go to ted in new york who's an engineer listening on wrsb
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.200]  13 10 am uh and ted you are on the air welcome
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:31.680]  hello i like how are you good sir welcome yes um
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.280]  there's a few things that i'd like to point out about uh
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:39.120]  you know hurricanes and and so forth to begin with
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:46.000]  uh i figured out the energy of harp a few years ago
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:53.200]  based on the acreage and the uh anticipated 1.3 billion watts
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:58.560]  of power it turns out it's about 400 watts to the square
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:02.640]  foot at least at that time which is interesting that's about the same as a
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:07.920]  microwave oven but it's also worth noting that
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:12.640]  this is an 8 to 10 megahertz band that harp operates on
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.960]  now the water absorbs energy and gets hot
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:21.120]  and the 3 gigahertz i think it's 3.2 is the number
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.200]  and um that's the wavelength that will heat water up
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:31.040]  when you look at the vortex of a hurricane you know which a vortex is
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:35.120]  naturally circular when you look at katrina and others
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:38.640]  they have a hexagonal hole in the middle of them
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:42.080]  now you're right and and and katrina sat there and did things they've never
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:45.360]  seen for a few days acted like they admit they can
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:49.760]  steer hurricanes i've had the head of harp on they admit they can quote ignite
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:54.240]  the atmosphere with it and then harp did a 90 degree turn
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:58.880]  straight for the coast you know and uh so you know
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:04.000]  i believe that based on these numbers and other data that
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.080]  this has to be done for more of it and the amount of power involved is a
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.080]  staggering amount of power far more than a solar cell
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:16.560]  powered satellite can generate in fact it would have to be a nuclear powered
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:20.400]  satellite to generate a kind of wattage well you know they
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:24.000]  admittedly have launched nuclear powered satellites back in the 60s and 70s
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.640]  they they did some treaties on them and say they're not going to do them anymore
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:29.280]  but now you hear nasa saying they want to launch
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:32.560]  nuclear powered spacecraft i'm sure you've heard those announcements
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:36.080]  well they did kassini was nuclear head like seven pounds of plutonium
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:40.480]  sure uh the voyagers have been transmitting since 1976 and
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:43.920]  they both have thermal nuclear generators that are out on the end of a long
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:46.960]  arm because they're not shielded and they generated
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.760]  tremendous amount of radiation but yeah so the thing is i believe a lot of
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:56.480]  people misunderstand what some of the things harp can do
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.480]  you know and you're kind of looking down here at harp when the problem is
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:03.360]  really high overhead about 200 miles up
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:07.200]  yeah but again from according to limits and others
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.360]  the antennas are great but they're generally localized like you were saying
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.520]  and take a lot of power the old-fashioned plane spraying
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:18.720]  is where he said they can really control these hurricanes
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:24.240]  the old low-tech chemical route that that i don't disagree with that at all
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:28.800]  and that's we got a couple different vectors at work here and
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:32.800]  you know the main thing is that you know hurricanes are driven by heat
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:35.760]  and warm water which you know what you know what i want to hear more from you
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.960]  will you hold till we start the next hour because i got something special
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:41.840]  we're going to do in the short little segment coming up next and then because
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.760]  i can tell you know what you're talking about i've interviewed a bunch of
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.760]  engineers and people you're saying what they've said
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.800]  you want to have some more comments when we start the next hour
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:52.240]  well uh i can only hold for a short time
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:55.840]  we got to jump in thanks for calling uh great points you made more calls coming
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.960]  up got a little surprise straight ahead on the other side
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:03.520]  and more calls stay with us the worst drought in 50 years continues
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:07.040]  and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:10.480]  78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:14.720]  not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted

[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:27.600]  because on fox news yesterday they said like two seconds before
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:31.440]  they went to commercials this may postpone the election
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:34.880]  so i started laughing like oh here it is this is what
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:39.360]  you know wait a minute okay because see see see i googled that this morning
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:42.160]  and couldn't find anybody saying it could postpone the election i might have
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.640]  been blind um but now we've got a curtain
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:48.240]  memo article out at info wars.com with the headline hurricane
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:52.480]  sandy divine win for obama watson's doing one on could it postpone the
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:57.440]  election you're saying you heard fox news actually say that
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.680]  at the end of the uh at the end of this segment like
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:04.640]  just before they were going to commercial i was showing my boyfriend
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:09.200]  that look this this storm is pretty weird uh and i had told them previously
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.000]  that they're gonna do something to start this election just watch because
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.480]  he's a non-believer so uh and and we were watching and then he's
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.520]  that's what he said like just before he went to a commercial clip this may
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:22.880]  stall the election and then he looked at me like oh you said that
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:26.880]  and i just started laughing like yeah this is it huh
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.480]  well it certainly could be i mean they they've admitted since the 60s they
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:33.840]  can control hurricanes that's not widely known but it's admitted i just
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:38.240]  showed like 15 news articles last hour about it uh paul watson's gonna do a
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:41.040]  big article on it curtain emos done one we're gonna add some more to it you know
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:46.640]  with all the admissions of weather control uh but this could be uh you know
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.240]  but you know if it gets postponed to romney surging
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.280]  that could actually help romney it doesn't matter in the final equation
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:57.680]  it's just interesting to see these guys and and and their their camps
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:01.040]  because they have the same goals basically they just their their camps
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:04.320]  have different ways of getting us to their new world order but it is
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.640]  interesting to see them fighting with each other
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:11.520]  absolutely and so so you got romney over here if romney loses everyone's gonna
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.000]  go crazy if obama loses everyone's gonna go crazy so it's like everyone's
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.640]  gonna go crazy by the way i agree with you i i think you are gonna see some
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:23.920]  things happen if romney loses too i i've been really
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:27.200]  thinking about that i think it'll be different responses
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:31.280]  uh it can be provocateur you've got government with anonymous and with
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.120]  people that aren't anonymous shank storm the white house engage in violence and

[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:57.920]  worst storm in 100 years seen for northeast us
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:01.520]  a blue norther a big west coast storm coming across the country right now
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:05.040]  all meant to converge like if you pull up a satellite shot of the united states
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:08.400]  you see a storm coming from the north big giant one
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:11.040]  another one coming from the west and then the tropical storm that was a
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:14.880]  hurricane and i hope everything turns out okay i'm just saying this is crazy
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:20.240]  timing and by the way i've been calling
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:24.720]  watson and i've been talking to adan and kurt everybody at the office since
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:28.480]  this morning saying look guys this is going to help obama
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:32.720]  this is going to help obama this is going to help obama
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:36.560]  this is going to help obama and i kind of debated it with watson and explained
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:39.120]  he goes i guess you're right but he hadn't done his article yet
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:42.720]  i was just talking to him during the last break and then they walk up to me
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:46.400]  with this that is um
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:50.880]  time stamp what just about 30 minutes ago or so other copy i had had the time
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:55.200]  stamp and man out u.s. news and world report agrees with me
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:59.120]  experts team obama should root for hurricane sandy
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:04.800]  to interrupt election we interrupt this broadcast for the special bulletin
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:10.320]  it's been called snow cane and worse than the perfect storm
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:15.760]  i hadn't heard it called snowy cane i got called it i've heard it called uh
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:19.520]  frankenstorm and it could knock out power in the mid-atlantic through election
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:21.760]  day oh i've been saying that since the start of the
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:27.280]  show and i mean not that i'm smart that's obvious
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:33.440]  man i tell you this is just too much i mean this is circus maximus um
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:36.560]  they've been telling the cops get ready for something big late october early
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:38.640]  november you've heard the police on the show
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:41.680]  you've seen the admissions of the army getting ready for civil unrest but not
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:45.360]  saying for what i don't know if this is it i thought it could be an iran's
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:49.200]  strike it could be a terror attack a stage or what happened
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:53.920]  i don't know but now this i mean this is just insane
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:58.800]  hurricane sandy hasn't even made it past the bahamas yet
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:04.320]  and it just goes on from there actually the time stamp i have is the printer
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:07.680]  stamp this came out yesterday so they knew what i knew yesterday that's why
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:10.400]  i was looking at this going well the one i had i guess it printed the printer
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:13.680]  time on it i guess it updates that's what this came out yesterday
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:17.280]  so there you go they knew yesterday we're behind the curve here
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:20.800]  aha but we weren't behind the curve on
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:26.240]  anyways that we should break down here is ted turner
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:30.000]  we broke this yesterday morning and then within about two hours bright bark
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.720]  carried it which is fine uh and then fox news picked it up
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:39.120]  in the daily mail and literally hollywood reporter you name it i'm just
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:43.600]  glad that ted turner came out and said i think
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:47.520]  it's good u.s troops are killing themselves we played that a few times
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:51.120]  yesterday we won't play again he came out and kind of spun the whole thing that
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:54.000]  he was sorry he said it but he didn't mean what he said
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.880]  this is a guy that always says you know we should kill 90% of the public or
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:00.000]  useless eaters and things and world governments needed i mean you pull up
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.600]  his quotes it's well known that he's a eugenicist
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:07.280]  and as part of the quote secret meetings with the rockefellers to reduce
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:12.560]  population wall street journal associated press abc news
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:16.480]  but then when fox news and others say bright bark broke the story
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:20.720]  nobody i guess really broke it he said it on cnn
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:25.360]  it's that info wars listeners picked up on it we reported it first
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:29.280]  right mark took our video edited out our our text comments and put it up which
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:36.800]  is fine but then you know people like uh
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.640]  the website for what's his name glenn back they took our video but just from
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:44.080]  somebody else's site so it wouldn't even be our youtube site
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.120]  i mean it's just like they always go out of their way
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:50.720]  to make sure we never get credit for putting a story out there
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:55.200]  for pointing something out now again i it's better sweet because i'm happy
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:58.240]  because the word got out and he's had to apologize and it shows how
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:01.440]  sickening is i mean i hate ted turner my first film
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:05.440]  he's the villain in it because he's a villain america destroyed by design
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:13.280]  uh but i'm just tired of it and and again we give people credit sometimes
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:16.160]  you think somebody steals your story because they already found out about
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.080]  it themselves and so there's no reason to get mad
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:24.000]  or get upset and i'm not even really mad or upset because again
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.480]  we get to more and more push stuff out there and get it to break mainstream
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:31.680]  a lot of that's because the drudge report dot com but even when drudge doesn't
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:34.640]  link to our stories now when it's important news we're able to get others
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:38.480]  to pick it up and a lot of times they give us credit because it's
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:41.440]  important to point out that we really are having an impact
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:45.840]  i'm very proud of that i'm not i'm not somebody who's proud of a big bank
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:48.560]  account that's not what i'm seeking i'm not somebody that's seeking to know
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:51.040]  celebrities just to know celebrities though some of them are really interesting
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:55.120]  people i'm not somebody who's seeking sex or fame or any
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:59.600]  of this i really want to have freedom i want to expose the globalist
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:03.840]  but part of being successful to do that is getting the credit we deserve
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:07.760]  and that's why we give credit where to do and that's why the drudge report
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:10.960]  and world net daily and others they give us credit when we break stuff
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:14.960]  and really help us especially drudge reports but
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:17.840]  uh and i like a lot of the work right marks to me i'm trying to get to fight
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:21.360]  with them when they're when their reporter got groped we linked to them and
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:25.280]  showed it and covered it when their editor was abused i just don't
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:28.720]  understand this going out of their way i mean you know it's like
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:32.160]  fox news i'm supposed to go on a couple of their shows i'm already in new york to
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:36.160]  be on the view and cnn you know abc
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:40.400]  and they send somebody over uh you know they said hey can you come a little
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:43.760]  bit early you know uh meet us next door at the restaurant
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:47.520]  at some steakhouse so i get there and you know there's the well-known reporter
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:51.520]  and they go yeah uh glenn beck doesn't want you in the building
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:57.440]  glenn beck you know is going to throw a fit uh if you're allowed on these shows
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:00.800]  and people don't want to be targeted by him you know he's basically an out of
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:04.080]  control person and nobody likes him but he's throwing
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:07.440]  fits you know i mean i don't even dislike glenn beck
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:11.600]  it's just like it even when he got on air and said me and charlie sheen have
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:14.960]  sex in a shower together i mean i could own him for that
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:19.040]  it doesn't matter if i'm a public figure and he's one it just totally made up i
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:22.160]  don't care if you're laughing while you say it
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:27.280]  you know uh this is the type of um this is the type of garbage
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:30.880]  that we're talking about and dealing with so so here's the deal i want freedom
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:34.320]  glenn beck i don't want to fight with you or rush limbaugh
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.640]  who's done nothing to me he's actually covered my stories on air before even
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:40.240]  though i'm up against him on the radio i'm not against in michael savage i was
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:43.120]  upset to hear he left talk radio glad to hear he's coming back
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:48.160]  i want to succeed on my own merit i don't want to succeed on other people's
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.000]  downfalls okay and um that really tells you a

[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:14.800]  suicide and uh it's pierce morgan video picked up
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:21.360]  by hollywood reporter fox news you name it uh and they gave none of us
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:25.360]  none of us the creditor here's fox news ted turner military suicides that number
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:30.160]  in combat deaths is good and it says uh it was highlighted
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:33.440]  thursday by breitbart and he goes on to say they broke the story
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:38.160]  uh same thing uh with uh these other newspapers and and so
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:41.760]  they just go out of their way to never give us credit well hey
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:47.280]  you keep pretending that that we aren't pertinent and that we're not big okay
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:50.720]  you just keep doing it okay because that's not the case
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:53.600]  like where is that and there's a whole other list i need to go over you know i

[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:04.320]  they don't even have all our affiliates on the affiliate list and i guess it's
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:06.640]  because if they don't have updated agreements they're just not on there
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:09.440]  i think all the stations we're on should be up there all the great stations

[02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:15.120]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:18.960]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly i'm not
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:22.000]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.880]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:28.080]  fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every

[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:19.200]  television so from outside it looks like someone is
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:22.160]  home watching tv fake tv plugs in just like a lamp
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:25.040]  on a timer but is far more convincing to burglars
[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:28.400]  fake tv deters burglars costs far less than an alarm
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:31.280]  and is highly recommended by numerous police departments

[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:54.400]  says what i thought i was the first to say in terms of they were saying it

[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:01.600]  thinking as lucky stars for this but i don't really see much more
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:04.480]  about it on the news we had a caller that said they
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:09.040]  heard it talked about on fox news briefly um but let's just hope it peters
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:10.720]  out let's hope everybody on the east coast it didn't
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:14.080]  bad but uh once at a hundred-year storm very very

[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:46.000]  seriously mainstream media still refuses to cover or says it's not true
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.600]  and gmo companies just want to save you money that's a sarcastic article by
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:52.560]  melissa melton raw milk rights are under siege big
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:57.680]  list of that italian court sends disgrace burles sony uh to prison

[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:42.800]  or i mean is that what you were getting at
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:49.120]  no no no no i'm saying the citizens uh everybody just seems to be
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:54.640]  in a place of peace uh there's a lot of frantic stuff going on i doubt there's a
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:58.240]  piece of plywood to be found on the island right now if not it's uh
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:02.640]  going to be over a window in the next hours uh people might wait another day
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:06.480]  you know but i bet they're going back and forth from this island and uh
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:10.640]  closing things up and the caretakers are taking care of the rich and famous as
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:15.840]  uh up island uh sanctuaries and vacation homes
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:20.480]  um but i really think uh a couple of two things real quick one is that uh
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.400]  the states that look like they may be hit by this
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.520]  i know just from looking at maps in the past we're talking about mostly blue
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:31.200]  states um one of the what number of electoral votes are
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:35.840]  contained within them and what that goes into the uh the algorithmic
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:40.080]  type systems that are used in figuring different things that will give
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.240]  sure if there's low turnout in those democrat controlled states
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:48.400]  and and and any of them end up going for romney that can throw it to him but
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:52.320]  us news and world report just points out it'll probably postpone it uh if it
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:58.160]  does anything and that will help uh obama because it's blocking romney surge
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:02.560]  out of the headlines but we'll see what happens you know what's good about this
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:05.600]  uh even if it's all a you know pretty much a staged event i don't mean like

[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:34.960]  otter good to hear from you god bless uh let's talk to mark in order gone mark
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:38.160]  welcome hey alex hey buddy
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:44.320]  hey alex um i i myself by taking the view that i know it's uh getting to be
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:48.240]  kind of the consensus that this would have a uh beneficial effect on the
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:51.920]  election uh on obama winning the election
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:56.560]  but uh as you had bev harris on early in the week certainly uh for recent
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:59.520]  elections they've had the uh election really
[02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:03.440]  fixed very well through the computerized black box voting
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:07.360]  and uh there's the problem you've got different management teams and different
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:10.080]  corrupt sectors there's not one unified system
[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:13.840]  show it's like who can grab the most machines and cheat the most as he wins
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:17.120]  now i'm sorry go ahead i see what you're saying okay but
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:20.320]  that's really kind of an update to me because i you know was under the
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:23.520]  impression i hadn't heard any difference that actually the
[02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:27.120]  computerized voting had it in the bag anyway they wanted to have it in the
[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:30.080]  bag as far as the election goes to a certain extent they don't have
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:35.520]  fraudulent systems in everywhere it's not one company uh it's just a lot of
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:39.200]  you know kind of like mafia running different sectors of the
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:41.520]  country did you have another point you wanted to make

[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:33.520]  you know this story really makes me mad because i've been following this since
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:37.680]  the quote bailout of general motors three years ago
[02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:42.480]  22 billion dollars the overall bailout package was worth 30 billion total
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:51.120]  went to move whole new factories to china brazil in eastern europe several
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:55.440]  countries in eastern europe and here's the washington examiner today jeep an
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:58.560]  obama favorite
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:03.040]  what does it even mean an obama favorite he has some like speech writer that said
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:07.040]  that looks to shift production to china i mean
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:11.040]  can nothing not be made in this country i happened to like jeeps my dad's got one
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:14.640]  i grew up riding around on the ranch in a jeep
[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:20.720]  in an old world war two one that had the exhaust pipe roasted out and you'd
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:24.400]  hire an akai drop around in it anyways is horrible but the point is
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:29.360]  point is i have affection for jeep and i it says in another potential blow of
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:34.800]  the president's ohio reelection campaign jeep the rugged brand
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:38.960]  president obama once said symbolized american freedom
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:44.640]  is considered giving up on the united states and shifting production to china
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:47.360]  yeah they make a lot of the components for the military i mean if we're going
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:50.560]  to be a big evil empire blowing everybody up can we at least build the
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:54.080]  little components of death here i mean no no because the globalists hate us more
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:36:00.000]  than they hate anybody else okay globalism is meant to shut us down
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:05.360]  such a move would crash the economy in towns like to lead ohio where jeeps are
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:10.560]  made and supplied and rob the community of economic security
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:13.440]  i can't believe how long jeeps been around i think my dad got like a 70th
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:16.640]  anniversary one last year he's got one of those sahara colored one it's an
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:20.080]  awesome car i love driving around the woods because it's made it's got such
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:23.840]  you know it turns so easy such a move would crash the economy in
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:28.240]  towns like to lead ohio where jeeps are made and supplied and rob the
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:31.920]  community of the economic security they thought obama's auto bailout
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:36.880]  assured them let me explain something the taxpayer money assured the jobs went
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:41.040]  overseas or globalists like morris strong and of
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:44.720]  course pigs like george soros have investments
[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:48.320]  obama is such a fan of jeep that he included a picture of himself speaking
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:51.520]  at the delito plant is newly released second term agenda binder
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.400]  well yeah he gets a peace prize and blows up a bunch of countries
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:57.520]  he stands in front of jeep and then they shut it down he says he's against the
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:01.920]  india when he wrote it this guy's like emperor palpatine
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:09.760]  oh it's treason then i mean this is so ridiculous
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:14.320]  and then it just goes on to make the announcement uh that um
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:17.600]  they're looking at moving jeep as they've done
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.320]  catalac most of catalac and the stupid volt
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:24.880]  which is government funded you notice that's not just a bailout that's
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.560]  government funded on top of it it costs like 80 000 to make one and they
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:31.920]  sell them for 50 or whatever it is and they can't even sell them but you
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:35.920]  can't even make the stinking things and then give the money to the workers to
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:39.280]  build it here in america you got to pay your tax money to have it
[02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:41.920]  shipped overseas
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:45.760]  i mentioned this but here it is out of cbs diabetic
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:50.800]  teen hit with taser after crash person goes into diabetic shock runs off the
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:54.320]  road cops show up taser them i see these articles every few days
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:58.080]  now i just showed video police in vancouver
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:03.600]  with a woman hunched over with uh i forget the disorder she had where she
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:08.800]  can barely walk cerebral palsy yeah and uh she
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:11.840]  when a person walks around the cops and she kind of moves to go between them
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:15.280]  and they just roll around the ground and stand around her and talk trash to her
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:19.360]  and then walk off i mean that's like out of
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:22.240]  again her old bad western where the really evil guys run the town there's
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:26.400]  an old woman oblong get out of there you old woman you
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:30.800]  run this town now man that's like how they set the show up so like the good
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:34.000]  guy comes into town you know and goes to the saloon and they start a fight with
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.680]  him and you know what happens but nowadays the good guys don't show up
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:43.040]  it's just get out of a you piece of trash and of course last i checked the
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:48.080]  local government's defending it well she got in the way of a lord
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:53.040]  yeah good maybe they should have hung her on the spot just you just
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:57.840]  you just tried to walk in between a space of two gods
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:01.520]  maybe they could kill hauler take her out in the ocean a boat with barnacles on
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:04.160]  the bottom put a rope around her and drag her
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:08.400]  from stem to stern under it and slice her all up usually die
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:12.480]  haul her up then just chop her body up big old battle axes because she
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:15.600]  i mean why not if you're gonna shove an old woman down that can hardly walk
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:18.320]  why not just go all the way they do in north korea
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:22.080]  you're rude to a cop in north korea you're dead or you go to a re-education
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:25.520]  camp and i think that's good i think we need that here
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:30.800]  i'm pro law enforcement i think we should all slit our throats and bring
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:35.040]  goblets of blood to police to drink because we're bad they're god okay i
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:39.920]  know i'm just joking okay i'm not i'm not serious unless we were in

[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:16.080]  uh possible uh events that this obviously manufactured weather would
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:18.960]  lead to have occurred to you outside of just
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:23.440]  influencing the election on obama's favor
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.600]  well no i mean it i think it i think it helps obama they're able to postpone
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:29.680]  the election it blocks romney on it let's see mac
[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:32.880]  presidential they can manipulate the weather these three storms coming
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:36.080]  together they admit is an incredible fluke but maybe it is just a coincidence
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:39.440]  but we're not bad for saying it can be weather modification because it's going
[02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:42.320]  on i appreciate your call or is all the world wide weather
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:46.800]  modification causing more weird weather or should we pay al gore more carbon

[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:41.840]  88d experimental weather radar array and that's a mouthful but what it is is
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:47.120]  our is our doppler radar system and it's all run from norman oklahoma
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:50.560]  from the national weather service all all of them
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:55.840]  are run from from norman that's right i mean going off this you actually i
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:47:59.440]  remember years ago because i've known you for probably 15 years
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:02.240]  you actually talked to some of the engineers saying there was power and
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:05.760]  arrays being added to these that that really weren't for
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:09.280]  doppler that that's just the cover form and they can cook the atmosphere with
[02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:12.640]  us what yeah and what i'm putting together i've
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:15.600]  got so many pictures of what i call that the sky
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:20.720]  flying in in what i call harmonic distortion that the sky gets all
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:24.240]  rippled and fuzzy and weirded out sure it's the rainbow stuff
[02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:28.240]  can you tell people some of the reasons you know this because you also

[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:24.160]  hey there's an article that i wanted to direct you to and of all places it's in
[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:27.040]  motor trend magazine it's in the it's in the
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:33.840]  November issue of motor trend magazine the technology rider frank marcus
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:39.120]  wrote an article called balloon payment and it's about science offers a
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:44.880]  potential fix to our broken co2 situation and he's saying it if
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:50.960]  if coated properly a thin blanket of titanium dioxide dust might cool us
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:54.640]  right on down yeah and instead they're losing they're using aluminum dioxide
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:58.080]  and barium salts very poisonous to us and they now admit
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:01.520]  that the five billion dollar program they declassified a few months ago
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:05.520]  is a test though because under the u.s code title 50
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:11.200]  chapter 32 subsection 1528 paragraph b they say they can even kill us in test
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:14.880]  as long as it's just research steve
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:20.560]  yeah you gotta keep this article man you know unbelievable because at the end
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:25.360]  he's saying he's he's comforted to know that scientists and engineers may
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:29.840]  have our collective backs when politics and human nature oh i know i see that
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:33.440]  saw that article i see him everywhere aren't we lucky they're spraying us i
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:36.560]  mean thank god bill gates has got our back
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:42.720]  aluminum is so good for us steve oh this is titanium dioxide no i know i
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:44.800]  understand they're calling for that too but you know the main thing they're
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:51.040]  spraying is aluminum dioxide yes yes well listen anything else you'd
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:54.400]  like to add uh i guess that's it i just thought that

[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:14.400]  so they've been spraying all week and i haven't seen nothing like it
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:18.240]  i've been down here for a year and i literally know
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:23.120]  like today even today excuse me even today they were spraying
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:27.600]  where the where there was blue sky yeah there's a lot of kim trailing going on
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:30.720]  we need footage of that and get weather experts to look at it and tell
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:33.440]  what they're doing is depending on how they spray and where it can make it
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:36.560]  rain more or make it rain less but generally
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:39.680]  if there's an area they want to drought they'll spray a weather front so it
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:44.240]  drops there so the rain falls there instead of on you or they'll do it
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:47.440]  over the mountains instead of past the mountains in the area they're wanting to
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:50.640]  block i mean it it's going on we know what's going on but we have a shadow
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:54.640]  government since 1947 playing god so they do medical
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:57.840]  experiments on us you name it i mean who knows what they're doing
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:02.480]  we just know they're doing it kc in new jersey no new york you're on the air go
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:05.760]  ahead hey alex how you doing good sir go ahead
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:08.960]  don't even know where to start head turner jerk always been a jerk
[02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:12.720]  all right this weather the chemtrail situation on long island
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:16.160]  has been very low for the last two months
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:19.440]  and we've actually had so many here the last two years
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:23.920]  that there's a website for it so i don't know if they're actually
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:27.600]  using the chemtrails to bring the storm in or the lack of them is actually
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:31.280]  bringing the storm in i don't even know which way to go and
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:35.120]  election wise i think we have a week to prepare to prepare
[02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:38.000]  after the storm goes through if the power goes out
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:41.600]  that would be the biggest thing is that you couldn't uh you couldn't watch the
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:44.480]  tv commercials for a week if there's no power
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:48.160]  and that would be terrible oh it'd be awful but that could actually i don't
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:51.600]  know who that's going to favor really because here on long island we vote
[02:57:51.600 --> 02:57:56.240]  republican anyway well uh who knows what's going to
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:57:59.120]  happen i just think the fact that it's three storms coming together
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:02.320]  even meteorologists say this is a bizarre thing that's happening
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:05.200]  it just adds to all the craziness regardless and we're going to be here
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:09.200]  tracking the whole thing my friend i actually i agree with your original
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:12.960]  analysis of election suspensions being more from the uh
[02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:15.840]  from the race baiting that's been going on for the last you know
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:18.960]  since the trevon martin thing happened and now with this whole thing with the
[02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:24.320]  romney uh tweets yeah i agree uh that that is really
[02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:27.840]  becoming a big issue and if obama doesn't win i expect to see some
[02:58:27.840 --> 02:58:30.720]  trouble i hope it's not too bad because it's all just
[02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:34.320]  so out of control anything else sir nope that's about it all right thank you
[02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:37.120]  so much and be safe there in new york that big old
[02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:40.320]  hurricane coming your way

[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:08.400]  are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:12.080]  and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[02:59:12.080 --> 02:59:16.240]  counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own
[02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:20.800]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:24.320]  e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply
[02:59:24.320 --> 02:59:27.600]  i recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known

[03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:48.400]  though they were just blocking roads uh they were blocking them because uh
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:53.280]  mr obama biden was in town
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:57.520]  oh yeah they block roads a lot when that happens yeah i mean that's probably
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:03:00.960]  what else happened obama biden was in town and
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:08.400]  and my you know the whole thing about it is is this is just uh uh it is literally
[03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:13.360]  coming to coming to the new world order we are under it

[03:03:16.880 --> 03:03:21.360]  around an act official uh i mean i think government should all start wearing
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:28.320]  crowns and kim jong il uniforms with crowns and then the new
[03:03:28.320 --> 03:03:32.640]  we should have to lick the boots of any bureaucrat we see immediately or be
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:36.000]  executed on the spot and if a bureaucrat wants us to
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.560]  have to you know kiss their heiny that that as well
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:42.240]  because that's how you show your love of government and i think anyone that
[03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:45.440]  doesn't do that is evil as bad as george washington and you know
[03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:48.320]  fema teaches he was bad i think our new founding
