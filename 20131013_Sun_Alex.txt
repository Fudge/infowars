[00:00.000 --> 00:09.360]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.440]  Ladies and gentlemen if you are a radio listener we are rolling footage from NBC
[00:38.440 --> 00:44.040]  News local in the district of criminals with what looks like about a 75 year old
[00:44.040 --> 00:50.360]  vet with others being attacked with a baton by riot police dressed up in bright
[00:50.360 --> 00:57.280]  blue UN style uniforms and I've got to say these riot police literally look
[00:57.280 --> 01:03.360]  like something you'd expect from a UN army they look like a bunch of social
[01:03.360 --> 01:09.960]  workers in combat gear but UN blue it is amazing and I've been I've been watching
[01:09.960 --> 01:14.680]  the live feeds we're adding them all to info wars.com right now info wars.com
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.040]  has a lot of the feeds drudgereport.com has a lot of the feeds and we're
[01:19.040 --> 01:22.840]  trying to condense them all down to info wars.com my skeleton Sunday crew is
[01:22.840 --> 01:27.480]  doing a great job trying to get it all together but actor James Woods tweeted
[01:27.480 --> 01:32.120]  and it's we retweeted it at real Alex Jones that thank God for the riot police
[01:32.120 --> 01:36.200]  to deal with 85 year old World War two vets and wheelchairs thank God for them
[01:36.200 --> 01:42.000]  protecting us what will we do without them to paraphrase his tweet and now
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.840]  Kit Daniels is posting the video is posted in his article breaking riot
[01:46.840 --> 01:52.520]  police confront veterans as they liberate memorials or veterans remind
[01:52.520 --> 01:56.920]  Americans how to resist tyranny but kids doing a whole separate article right
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.480]  now this just broke 10 minutes ago this is happening now as riot police came up
[02:01.480 --> 02:05.360]  to vets and told them to get out of the area when they wouldn't they start
[02:05.360 --> 02:11.760]  ramming them with the batons and then the 75 year old vet I'd say that's his
[02:11.760 --> 02:17.280]  age actually attacks back and shoves the the UN type police back and then start
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.640]  cowering and fear it's amazing they go up and start fights and then I guess I've
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.520]  never had anybody pushed back against them and so they flip out this is
[02:28.520 --> 02:32.840]  incredible we're going to be covering that this morning we began to post the
[02:32.840 --> 02:39.040]  articles on prison planet dot com on info wars dot com Paul Watson Kit Daniels
[02:39.040 --> 02:45.160]  Kurt Nemo myself again posting articles and videos of the vets showing up by the
[02:45.160 --> 02:48.600]  tens of thousands in different areas of DC it wasn't very coordinated which is
[02:48.600 --> 02:53.720]  good because it's organic and they were just everywhere tearing down the the
[02:53.720 --> 02:58.720]  wired shut barricades tearing them down removing them piling them up in big neat
[02:58.720 --> 03:03.680]  stacks and then they said let's march on the White House and go protest there no
[03:03.680 --> 03:09.320]  one is allowed to protest around the White House it's a free speech zone area
[03:09.320 --> 03:12.400]  where it's not allowed you know the free speech donors were none of the cameras
[03:12.400 --> 03:15.920]  are at so I say that sarcastically when I call it a free speech zone it's a non
[03:15.920 --> 03:22.240]  free speech zone and so the vets show up and they're there going to protest and
[03:22.240 --> 03:25.720]  the police come in to try to move them back there's other videos showing them
[03:25.720 --> 03:30.320]  trying to put up barricades around the gates around the White House and
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.920]  shoving on veterans when they come up to talk to them so it's a pretty serious
[03:35.920 --> 03:41.400]  situation I'm telling you all it's going to take is some of these fed goons to
[03:41.400 --> 03:45.600]  start beating up veterans and then you won't see tens of thousands of oath
[03:45.600 --> 03:49.920]  keepers there and by the way that's mainly who's there you won't see that
[03:49.920 --> 03:54.000]  in fact it shows veterans marching with pieces of gates that they've taken
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.120]  barricades that they've taken I guess is the spoils of victory against the
[03:59.120 --> 04:02.760]  tyrants and people could say all big deal this is how it began in Romania
[04:02.760 --> 04:07.600]  against Chelcescu and he began to have veterans and other people protesting
[04:07.600 --> 04:11.560]  against the dictator in Romania and then as soon as they started abusing and
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.840]  shooting people hundreds of thousands showed up when there'd only been hundreds
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.800]  at first and then they started shooting at them show hundreds of thousands more
[04:19.800 --> 04:23.400]  showed up and then the police just stood down and the military stood down on
[04:23.400 --> 04:26.680]  hours later you know what happened to Chelcescu I don't want that to happen to
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.040]  puppet Obama because they'll turn him into a hero I want him to be held
[04:30.040 --> 04:33.480]  accountable for all the treason against this republic we come back all the big
[04:33.480 --> 04:40.080]  news and then in the second hour the second hour today we're going to talk
[04:40.080 --> 04:45.600]  about the missing nuclear weapons from Dias Air Force Base and the number one
[04:45.600 --> 04:49.320]  new general and number two new general who've now been fired along with two
[04:49.320 --> 04:53.160]  other generals that now we learned got fired with almost no media coverage and
[04:53.160 --> 04:57.960]  and and what's really behind this so breaking news on that front stay with

[06:31.680 --> 06:38.800]  center in the heart of the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones
[06:46.120 --> 06:53.360]  ladies and gentlemen we're live it is the 13th day the 13th day of October
[06:53.360 --> 06:58.680]  2013 I am your host Alex Jones we're here every Sunday four to six p.m. central
[06:58.680 --> 07:04.000]  just as we are back weekdays 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central
[07:04.000 --> 07:10.400]  and I am so glad I do a live Sunday show on days like this why frankly so much
[07:10.400 --> 07:13.440]  happens over the weekend I'll start doing a Saturday show effect I'm thinking
[07:13.440 --> 07:17.280]  about it but before I horrify the crew out there I may just do a skyp only
[07:17.280 --> 07:23.000]  prison planet TV Saturday evening live transmission and when I can't do it I'll
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.520]  have some of the other crew do it I'm telling you we need seven day a week
[07:26.520 --> 07:33.560]  coverage with what is going on in this world my friends besides why not work
[07:33.560 --> 07:38.240]  seven days a week 14 15 hours a day I can't stop thinking about politics and
[07:38.240 --> 07:43.200]  world events I'm sorry I can't get into football and sing my teams anthem and
[07:43.200 --> 07:47.920]  cry if they lose or have celebrations if they win because none of that matters
[07:47.920 --> 07:52.520]  compared to the real game of life and huge world events that are happening
[07:52.520 --> 07:57.760]  right now what's up on info wars dot com what's up on drudge report dot com
[07:57.760 --> 08:05.520]  what's up on the libertarian patriot news sites right now my friends just
[08:05.520 --> 08:11.240]  minutes ago riot police began attacking peaceful veterans including folks that
[08:11.240 --> 08:16.560]  look like they're at least 75 years old with batons because they dare march
[08:16.560 --> 08:21.040]  without a permit past the White House and the veterans I couldn't believe it
[08:21.040 --> 08:24.960]  footage of these old men began basically beating up the police and shoving
[08:24.960 --> 08:27.600]  them back down on the ground I think the police have ever dealt with somebody
[08:27.600 --> 08:31.280]  who isn't scared to be hit with a baton everybody else just rolls over onto the
[08:31.280 --> 08:36.960]  ground in total fear that footage is up on info wars dot com from NBC local
[08:36.960 --> 08:42.120]  breaking riot police confront veterans as they liberate memorials kit Daniels
[08:42.120 --> 08:45.760]  who's working this weekend one of our writers he's about to post an article on
[08:45.760 --> 08:49.320]  this with other footage that's coming in footage so crazy that I was seeing right
[08:49.320 --> 08:54.800]  before went live from live feeds online that I can't even believe it because it
[08:54.800 --> 08:58.600]  showed the riot police there's a bunch of footage of this trying to come up and
[08:58.600 --> 09:01.360]  tell people they can't be in front of the White House I have been there many
[09:01.360 --> 09:05.840]  times with national TV crews and gone over to get our own b-roll with that
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.040]  we've shown this footage for films I'm making of the White House and you can be
[09:10.040 --> 09:14.600]  in the park a hundred yards away in the Secret Service in police uniforms will
[09:14.600 --> 09:17.720]  come over and say you can't do it and then security guards and regular police
[09:17.720 --> 09:21.600]  will come over and say I don't care what the law says I'm gonna arrest you if you
[09:21.600 --> 09:24.680]  don't move along and I'm like well we have this one footage that you're
[09:24.680 --> 09:28.360]  showing this is in America but I don't feel like being arrested today you're
[09:28.360 --> 09:31.560]  violating my rights but I'm gonna go ahead and going down the road now and
[09:31.560 --> 09:36.800]  then they follow you on bicycles in one case two miles as we walk getting b-roll
[09:36.800 --> 09:41.440]  footage and I'm like you know who I am they're like yeah we know you are and
[09:41.440 --> 09:45.040]  I'm like you know I'm not threatening anybody doesn't matter they want me to
[09:45.040 --> 09:48.880]  know I'm their slave and they do it to families with kids you've heard my pet
[09:48.880 --> 09:52.680]  peeve about this I've talked about this a lot that I've been to third world
[09:52.680 --> 09:56.880]  countries folks they don't act like this and by the way it's not the Secret
[09:56.880 --> 09:59.800]  Service in the in the suits I've run into a lot of them most of them are
[09:59.800 --> 10:04.800]  listeners in fact off record well it's not off record a lot of Secret Service
[10:04.800 --> 10:08.360]  agents are listeners but off record I won't say their names obviously off
[10:08.360 --> 10:12.400]  record you know the names but there's some senior folks at the White House
[10:12.400 --> 10:16.400]  they're listeners and I'm sure the NSA knows that in fact most people in the
[10:16.400 --> 10:19.280]  Secret Service are actually patriotic and they're very upset about what's
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.760]  going on I'll just leave it at that I'll just leave it at that it's not just
[10:22.760 --> 10:26.480]  Bongino the former head of the foreign details for the president who's a
[10:26.480 --> 10:28.880]  listener of the show that you've heard on the show exposing what's happening
[10:28.880 --> 10:33.040]  running for Congress in Maryland it's most of them and he said that on air
[10:33.040 --> 10:37.000]  most of them are totally freaked out they have these special Secret Service
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.640]  security guards that come out and mess with the families and get everybody's
[10:40.640 --> 10:46.480]  face and act like total jerks and they've got federal forces in these weird
[10:46.480 --> 10:53.680]  blue UN colored uniforms coming up to veterans who want to stand there and
[10:53.680 --> 10:58.120]  chant at the gates of the White House and they got Secret Service in there
[10:58.120 --> 11:02.080]  with stinger missiles automatic weapons flamethrowers you name it nobody's gonna
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.360]  really climb over and do anything and nobody was trying to so they send
[11:05.360 --> 11:11.080]  goons out to intimidate the veterans and the veterans start fighting back and
[11:11.080 --> 11:14.440]  and believe me if they have their way they'll try to arrest those veterans
[11:14.440 --> 11:18.840]  that when they get hit with a baton shove the cops back up against the wall
[11:18.840 --> 11:24.360]  but I'm telling you these cops look like a bunch of nanny state commies to me
[11:24.360 --> 11:27.560]  because that's who they hire now federally to be their little security
[11:27.560 --> 11:31.000]  guard minion types and they've got their little metal truncations they've got
[11:31.000 --> 11:38.400]  their little extendable carbide steel batons that break bones I mean these
[11:38.400 --> 11:42.200]  are not your old wooden batons out there that they're using on people and go
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.360]  ahead kill one of these vets I predicted two weeks ago that when all this
[11:46.360 --> 11:50.480]  started up I said they're going to attack veterans with batons they will
[11:50.480 --> 11:55.320]  attack elderly vets with batons and I said even though that's a PR disaster
[11:55.320 --> 12:00.480]  they can't help it they they hate veterans so much and they hate gun owners
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.440]  and libertarians and real conservatives and constitutional is so much they will
[12:04.440 --> 12:09.960]  I predicted it over and over again the last two weeks over and over again on
[12:09.960 --> 12:14.840]  record that you would see this start and now I predict after the veterans at the
[12:14.840 --> 12:19.400]  Iwo Jima Memorial that was shut down the tomb of the unknown soldier that they
[12:19.400 --> 12:23.840]  wouldn't let anybody get near the World War two giant memorial that's out in a
[12:23.840 --> 12:26.880]  public mall they didn't shut down the other ones they let the illegal aliens
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.720]  have demonstrations anytime they want they only block the veterans memorials
[12:30.720 --> 12:35.800]  to to just set the precedent we can do whatever we want and did arrest veterans
[12:35.800 --> 12:41.360]  and did beat people up but when they showed up by the tens of thousands today
[12:41.360 --> 12:46.880]  they backed off but then the veterans said let's push it let's march down to
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.280]  Barry Sotero's outfit and by the way I heard Obama left today pulled out of
[12:52.280 --> 12:57.040]  dodge I mean this is I guess you'd want to hear people chanting outside and now
[12:57.040 --> 13:02.720]  his goons are there trying to stop people this is all up on info wars.com
[13:02.720 --> 13:09.160]  right now unbelievable and the footage is just now pouring in of them
[13:09.160 --> 13:16.800]  batoning but when they start batoning the veterans and again it's what these
[13:16.800 --> 13:21.520]  cowardly federal troops do is they they love to target old people including
[13:21.520 --> 13:24.520]  folks in wheelchairs because somehow they think that's that's like an easy
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.280]  target but they don't understand how this is gonna backfire on them this is
[13:28.280 --> 13:32.800]  how out of touch these goons are so they single out the old people first
[13:32.800 --> 13:37.960]  thinking that oh they'll be easy to push over and then the old people actually
[13:37.960 --> 13:42.880]  fight back and shove the cops back that's worth it this image is worth ten
[13:42.880 --> 13:48.560]  billion dollars I mean I'm telling you the cops yelling and screaming and
[13:48.560 --> 13:52.400]  threatening the veterans and saying we want to fight with you is pathetic I
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.920]  mean it just shows the essence of tyranny the essence of cowardice the
[13:56.920 --> 14:02.040]  essence of weakness the essence of patheticness and the fear in the police's
[14:02.040 --> 14:05.320]  eyes they should be afraid because you're working for a criminal system
[14:05.320 --> 14:10.320]  you're defending a fraud and you know it how is your socialist ideology doing
[14:10.320 --> 14:14.200]  for you now all you idiots that supported Obamacare it was written by
[14:14.200 --> 14:17.520]  offshore banks select insurance companies to shut down other insurance
[14:17.520 --> 14:21.560]  companies and hmo's that weren't globalist it was meant to lower the
[14:21.560 --> 14:27.600]  standard of care double the prices and and absolutely take over society I had
[14:27.600 --> 14:32.160]  top experts on I read the subsections of the bills I had constitutional lawyers
[14:32.160 --> 14:38.160]  on I had medical doctors on who has studied it and I went through and read
[14:38.160 --> 14:43.120]  the the minutes of the lobbying meetings that were published from Capitol Hill
[14:43.120 --> 14:48.400]  meetings three years ago when they got it passed I told you everything that was
[14:48.400 --> 14:52.560]  in it because when I had an expert on I would have the 10,000 plus page writers
[14:52.560 --> 14:56.720]  and the 3,000 page bill up on the computer screen I would sub-search the
[14:56.720 --> 15:00.520]  subsection they said I would go look at it and we wrote hundreds of articles
[15:00.520 --> 15:04.760]  with the subsections telling you I know what's in the bill I did research I'm
[15:04.760 --> 15:10.480]  informed I'm not an idiot I'm not lazy I'm not a moron I'm not bragging here but
[15:10.480 --> 15:14.320]  these Democrats think that it's because it's their opinion and they laugh at me
[15:14.320 --> 15:17.720]  and call me a right winger when I'm really a libertarian freedom lover that
[15:17.720 --> 15:22.000]  somehow it makes me wrong when I'm informed of course no one's been able
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.400]  to sign up at healthcare.gov they've been able to sign up through exchanges on
[15:26.400 --> 15:31.040]  the phone the 10% in a Reuters article four days ago that thought they'd
[15:31.040 --> 15:34.240]  signed up turned out they thought they'd signed up none of them were able to
[15:34.240 --> 15:38.760]  sign up the Miami Herald has an article out today saying looking for the
[15:38.760 --> 15:47.560]  mythical Obamacare and Roly they can't find one one okay you see I live in the
[15:47.560 --> 15:51.880]  real world with facts you live in the real world of La La Land you really
[15:51.880 --> 15:57.280]  think foreign banks wanted to give you free healthcare dummy dummy you're poor
[15:57.280 --> 16:02.720]  because you're lazy and stupid. Cal Bend Soap Company can save you thousands of

[20:02.840 --> 20:18.360]  from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[20:18.360 --> 20:26.800]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[20:26.800 --> 20:32.240]  network and the Empire is a bunch of kleptocratic corrupt special interests
[20:32.240 --> 20:36.640]  that want to run government to not be productive but to feed on folks there are
[20:36.640 --> 20:40.640]  a lot of poor people that are poor because they were brought up in a bad
[20:40.640 --> 20:45.440]  area never had you know any advantages that some others have had some people
[20:45.440 --> 20:50.280]  have disabilities but overall historically when you have a big nanny
[20:50.280 --> 20:56.160]  state it creates a bunch of entitled spoiled out-of-control people who then
[20:56.160 --> 21:01.200]  go create positions for themselves in the government to declare the producers
[21:01.200 --> 21:06.120]  the enemy and then enslave the producers and then the prosperity totally
[21:06.120 --> 21:10.800]  collapses but they don't care because they have an instinct to hate the people
[21:10.800 --> 21:15.960]  they're feeding off of and they're so ignorant again the studies are out there
[21:15.960 --> 21:19.840]  you can pull them up all day long they've been around for decades that if you
[21:19.840 --> 21:23.760]  have a 3% guaranteed investment yearly on the amount of money they take from you
[21:23.760 --> 21:27.720]  in Social Security you would get at least double on average what you get from
[21:27.720 --> 21:32.720]  Social Security in an investment and then there's the argument well we can't
[21:32.720 --> 21:36.280]  trust people to invest their own money let's invest it with the government
[21:36.280 --> 21:41.680]  instead run by the worst special interest that stole it all so now it's all
[21:41.680 --> 21:46.920]  bankrupt no you have the free market and you've and diversification so the best
[21:46.920 --> 21:50.680]  companies with the best names they're the most trustworthy long-term that's who
[21:50.680 --> 21:54.520]  everybody invest with instead we've done the opposite we've had special
[21:54.520 --> 21:58.800]  interest in government take over and then guarantee their corrupt operations
[21:58.800 --> 22:04.120]  and their Ponzi schemes and then tide the taxpayer to that it's bankrupt folks
[22:04.120 --> 22:09.080]  by design and we're going over the edge of the cliff right now and I just started
[22:09.080 --> 22:13.600]  having flashbacks of the callers the last few months going aha Obamacare is
[22:13.600 --> 22:19.160]  going in I'm a social worker you're just a right-wing racist and and because
[22:19.160 --> 22:22.280]  you're against Obamacare you don't want to turn your guns in you're a racist and
[22:22.280 --> 22:27.480]  I'm like what does this have to do with being racist a I'm not be you are
[22:27.480 --> 22:33.840]  obsessed with it see this is a giant con job they're like no Obama wants to
[22:33.840 --> 22:38.160]  redistribute the wealth he loves me that's why he's run by Goldman Sachs JP
[22:38.160 --> 22:43.600]  Morgan and Wells Fargo Wells Fargo on record the biggest drug money laundering
[22:43.600 --> 22:48.600]  operation in the world Bloomberg AP Reuters hundreds of billions a year
[22:48.600 --> 22:53.560]  Warren Buffett who wrote the laws to exempt himself from taxes 20 years ago
[22:53.560 --> 22:58.880]  lobbying to raise taxes on poor people so he gets bailout money and he tells the
[22:58.880 --> 23:03.000]  poor people oh raise your taxes we'll get the rich guy and the poor people go
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.960]  oh yeah I want to soak the rich guy the guy that owns a restaurant or a car
[23:06.960 --> 23:11.760]  dealership that gives you jobs dummy the guy making five million dollars a year
[23:11.760 --> 23:15.320]  you ought to be licking his boots those are the people that actually hire and
[23:15.320 --> 23:19.880]  run companies to do things the kleptocrat bankers Warren Buffett people
[23:19.880 --> 23:25.120]  the biggest recipient of the banker bailout I use him as a poster boy they
[23:25.120 --> 23:30.640]  game the whole deal they're mafia and by the way they've had federal rulings
[23:30.640 --> 23:34.720]  they've had congressional hearings that what Brookshire Hathaway and Wells Fargo
[23:34.720 --> 23:38.920]  and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan what they did and their
[23:38.920 --> 23:44.120]  investment banks is totally illegal and instead of going to jail they get bailed
[23:44.120 --> 23:47.960]  out by us holding us hostage and I don't mean to get off into a rant about this
[23:47.960 --> 23:55.480]  but man I study finance I have all the top experts on Nobel Prize winners from
[23:55.480 --> 23:59.400]  Joseph Sticklets to the former head of the Treasury father to Reaganomics the
[23:59.400 --> 24:03.860]  whole nine yards folks and they all concurred it's not like this is my
[24:03.860 --> 24:07.760]  opinion you're being told exactly how things work you're being told exactly
[24:07.760 --> 24:11.720]  how they operate you're being told that you have been totally scammed and you
[24:11.720 --> 24:15.960]  either listen to us or you become even bigger chumps and here's the problem I
[24:15.960 --> 24:22.280]  can't just step aside where you run off the cliff like limits the problem is you
[24:22.280 --> 24:28.640]  do run things the giant mass of 47% or whatever you are that really think you're
[24:28.640 --> 24:33.880]  gonna not work and forever just be given free stuff by the globalist they're
[24:33.880 --> 24:37.640]  only doing that to bring in a total tyranny and once they got their system
[24:37.640 --> 24:44.360]  in place they're gonna turn off all the chicken feed so you better get that
[24:44.360 --> 24:49.120]  through your brain right now I love this country I love prosperity I want poor
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.200]  people to be rich I want everybody to be successful and I know historically real
[24:53.200 --> 24:59.720]  Wildcat laws a fair free market systems create massive wealth and prosperity the
[24:59.720 --> 25:03.640]  problem is they create decadence then a big government off the taxes and then
[25:03.640 --> 25:07.400]  people get lazy and don't work they become client groups the system becomes
[25:07.400 --> 25:11.520]  anti-free market a natural falls apart a lot of people blame laws a fair for the
[25:11.520 --> 25:14.880]  problem we're in now we don't have laws a fair now we have select mega
[25:14.880 --> 25:18.680]  corporations that are exempt from the taxes the regulations that are above the
[25:18.680 --> 25:24.880]  law operating with slave states like China and India and Mexico to leverage
[25:24.880 --> 25:30.640]  out once free economies and lower wages under agenda 21 in UNESCO codified to
[25:30.640 --> 25:34.480]  bankrupt and domesticate the West to bring in a tyrannical world government
[25:34.480 --> 25:38.920]  they don't like you doing well they don't like you being wealthy they don't
[25:38.920 --> 25:42.480]  like you being uppity they don't like you having choice they don't like free

[25:57.720 --> 26:02.320]  is is a combine of ten big insurance companies who wrote this to shut down
[26:02.320 --> 26:06.040]  their competition the head of the Texas Banking Association went public and said

[33:06.280 --> 33:21.160]  Broadcasting Network we now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[33:21.160 --> 33:37.520]  and the heart of the resistance rallying Patriots Worldwide you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:37.520 --> 33:42.600]  by the way coming up in the next hour I'm gonna break down the case of the
[33:42.600 --> 33:47.560]  missing nukes from Dias Air Force Base in West Texas that is finally getting
[33:47.560 --> 33:52.320]  some big media coverage thanks to Michael Savage with a syndicated radio show
[33:52.320 --> 33:57.080]  one of the biggest in the country probably set in line to be the biggest
[33:57.080 --> 34:01.160]  political show spending a lot of time on a Friday I've listened to a show
[34:01.160 --> 34:04.240]  routinely I missed it Friday but I got a bunch of calls about it and emails and
[34:04.240 --> 34:07.960]  comments and that he covered it extensively on Friday and we appreciate
[34:07.960 --> 34:11.360]  that because it's important for everybody we do have military source at
[34:11.360 --> 34:20.360]  Dias high-level it was a complete freak out back on September 3rd a month ago
[34:20.360 --> 34:26.080]  when nukes that weren't supposed to be there were taken out of bunkers loaded
[34:26.080 --> 34:31.240]  on trucks that weren't even authorized by under the regular federal private
[34:31.240 --> 34:35.120]  certified moving group that moves them around and then they just rolled them
[34:35.120 --> 34:41.080]  out to South Carolina reportedly and since then they fired the number one and
[34:41.080 --> 34:46.040]  number two nuke generals they fired another one Friday and AP said that this
[34:46.040 --> 34:49.600]  was leaked to them the administration doesn't even want it known and then it
[34:49.600 --> 34:56.640]  turned out two other generals were removed over the weekend and there is a
[34:56.640 --> 35:00.800]  purge going on and I don't know what's going on with the nukes I just know my
[35:00.800 --> 35:05.120]  source is accurate this happened and it was such a big deal the base commander
[35:05.120 --> 35:10.120]  had to come out to the private police under the security on Dias and make
[35:10.120 --> 35:13.640]  them stand down and say no it's an order but there's no paperwork let the nukes
[35:13.640 --> 35:21.520]  leave so I don't know what's going on I'm telling you just like I told you Navy
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.000]  Seals told us that they thought the helicopter with 23 of them was blown up
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.720]  to cover up that bin Laden wasn't really killed and it was a lookalike and now
[35:29.720 --> 35:33.640]  you feel the families going public saying just that and you see Navy Seals
[35:33.640 --> 35:37.920]  that are retired going public talking about it I mean over and over again we
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.320]  break major news here okay because we're the only places that'll actually do it
[35:41.320 --> 35:45.880]  and that's a very dangerous position to be in by the way this is like taking my
[35:45.880 --> 35:51.440]  licks here okay but I've sworn to not be a coward I've sworn to go all the way
[35:51.440 --> 35:59.040]  and I'm doing it kind of makes it hard to care if your roof is leaking though
[35:59.040 --> 36:02.560]  you just just restart caring about other stuff it's really weird when you just
[36:02.560 --> 36:06.120]  gut up go all the way risk your life with all these whistleblowers and this
[36:06.120 --> 36:11.680]  information and I'm not up here talking about how I'm some hero either I just
[36:11.680 --> 36:15.960]  be able to know in a nation of folks that are obsessed with football and petty
[36:15.960 --> 36:21.600]  issues I live in the real world and believe me I wish every minute this
[36:21.600 --> 36:27.600]  nuke story wasn't real it is real and now you see all the top nuke generals
[36:27.600 --> 36:31.400]  getting fired and the admirals getting fired and
[36:31.400 --> 36:37.560]  Lindsey Graham saying South Carolina will be nuked and all this other stuff it
[36:37.560 --> 36:41.160]  looks bad I don't know what's going on there's different scenarios they're all
[36:41.160 --> 36:46.440]  horrible probably shadow government holding the government hostage with a
[36:46.440 --> 36:50.240]  nuclear false flag if folks don't go along with the globalist banker takeover
[36:50.240 --> 36:55.120]  of America that's probably what's going on most the big brains agree and
[36:55.120 --> 37:01.720]  concur with that analysis most the big brains I talked to I don't just sit here
[37:01.720 --> 37:05.800]  and go with my own perspective I have wargame this stuff not in fact not most
[37:05.800 --> 37:09.480]  the big brains all the big brains concur it's it's holding America hostage and
[37:09.480 --> 37:14.160]  it's some type of horrible situation and by the way in the next hour I dug up by
[37:14.160 --> 37:20.160]  dug up it's hard to find these the CBS news and the CNN and the Pentagon
[37:20.160 --> 37:27.000]  video press release when they fired two generals back in 08 a year after the
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.520]  investigation into the missing six keep saying two or two big ones but four
[37:33.520 --> 37:38.480]  small ones stealth cruise missiles they're high tech they look like stealth
[37:38.480 --> 37:44.600]  bombers that B-52s carry on their wings remember six of those got stolen is
[37:44.600 --> 37:53.160]  what happened they got stolen stolen out of Minot North Dakota back in 2007 a
[37:53.160 --> 37:56.520]  good group in the government blew the whistle on it they were gonna be from
[37:56.520 --> 38:00.040]  the Middle East Lord knows who the word was it was supposed to be a nuke
[38:00.040 --> 38:05.840]  false flag there was a big arms standoff down at the big Air Force base in
[38:05.840 --> 38:11.560]  Louisiana where they've now moved the main command I forget the name of it the
[38:11.560 --> 38:17.800]  point is is that I mean this all happened they landed the security force
[38:17.800 --> 38:20.920]  there said those are loaded cruise missiles they said we're ordered to fly
[38:20.920 --> 38:26.400]  this out of here there was a big standoff then six people died in the next
[38:26.400 --> 38:30.320]  month at the base in Minot that loaded them and took the orders they killed the
[38:30.320 --> 38:36.840]  people that got the orders obviously that's Marksdale so you can understand
[38:36.840 --> 38:40.320]  folks they kill people in and around this stuff okay now I'm just the person
[38:40.320 --> 38:47.400]  that got the info and I can't say anything about the source and how credible
[38:47.400 --> 38:51.440]  they are they're credible I can't give details okay obviously I can't say if
[38:51.440 --> 38:57.640]  it's a man a woman whatever but they were freaking out okay I mean they were
[38:57.640 --> 39:01.800]  basically police with their guns out at Dias Air Force base when this happened
[39:01.800 --> 39:07.320]  back in early September they're like what what the what warheads what the
[39:07.320 --> 39:10.880]  where's the where's the paperwork we're not supposed to have nukes here was
[39:10.880 --> 39:14.160]  everybody knew there were nukes there Weldon Henson worked on B2 bombers and
[39:14.160 --> 39:19.160]  F-16s there for five years of his seven years in the Air Force has been working
[39:19.160 --> 39:24.480]  here seven years since he got out of the Air Force and he said oh yeah
[39:24.480 --> 39:27.360]  everybody knew they had nukes we weren't supposed to talk about it what you think
[39:27.360 --> 39:32.840]  the Russians in the US actually got rid of their nukes you think they got rid of
[39:32.840 --> 39:37.720]  the nukes at Dias Air Force Base in 1986 because they signed the START treaty I
[39:37.720 --> 39:44.200]  bet you think Santa Claus is real too if you believe that so I don't know what's
[39:44.200 --> 39:51.440]  going on with the nukes I got a really good idea though I know the Russian
[39:51.440 --> 40:00.640]  government's concerned we got the Russian government calling us this is
[40:00.640 --> 40:05.080]  serious ladies and gentlemen what do you think they'd be concerned about missing
[40:05.080 --> 40:11.080]  nukes I see I said I'd cover this next hour this is the world I live in is all
[40:11.080 --> 40:14.560]  I'm telling you it's a miracle I can stay sane and deal with this level of
[40:14.560 --> 40:19.840]  stress because I realized that I'm like a general every day seven days a week in
[40:19.840 --> 40:22.960]  the info war with all this data and all this responsibility and I never
[40:22.960 --> 40:27.920]  imagined I would be in this position and they tell you it ain't fun and it's sick
[40:27.920 --> 40:32.080]  I saw this morning we were watching the newscast we got ten inches of rain where
[40:32.080 --> 40:35.560]  I live outside Austin and the little creek behind our house was like a roaring
[40:35.560 --> 40:42.640]  300 no 500 foot wide baby Mississippi River all we have to our house on a hill
[40:42.640 --> 40:47.640]  so I turn on local television we never even turn it on except watch movie to
[40:47.640 --> 40:54.200]  get rabbit ears out to tune in the local TV and I was watching everyone's salute
[40:54.200 --> 40:58.600]  and tears on their eyes when UT won a game or something and it was people like
[40:58.600 --> 41:02.520]  saluting and crying and I was like what you know there's missing nuclear weapons
[41:02.520 --> 41:07.200]  veterans are being attacked with batons for trying to go to the war memorials
[41:07.200 --> 41:11.920]  were the ebt card systems down in 17 states people are freaking out in one
[41:11.920 --> 41:16.400]  day with it down on the edge of rioting the country's 17 trillion in debt by
[41:16.400 --> 41:20.640]  design our government's funding al-qaeda and here are these full grown adults in
[41:20.640 --> 41:27.880]  burnt orange crying that UT won and singing the UT song I mean I'm living
[41:27.880 --> 41:36.800]  in the twilight zone I'm living in the twilight zone and it's because of
[41:36.800 --> 41:40.920]  some not judging you like football I played football I like football too but
[41:40.920 --> 41:44.880]  but as soon as I learned about other important things there's no way I can
[41:44.880 --> 41:49.120]  sit there and and get into it anymore and I don't judge people that get into it I
[41:49.120 --> 41:53.680]  get one to escape I can't escape is the deal okay I can't escape I can't I
[41:53.680 --> 41:56.480]  wake up at 3 a.m. this morning about the nuclear weapons I wake up in a cold
[41:56.480 --> 42:00.320]  sweat I've never been actually scared in my life I'm looking out the window for
[42:00.320 --> 42:03.760]  hit teams and stuff and I'm walking around sweating at 3 a.m. and my house
[42:03.760 --> 42:08.720]  looking at my kids in bed you know and it's just like it's all a big joke to
[42:08.720 --> 42:14.240]  other people it's funny or something it's not funny let me tell you they
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.080]  detonate nuclear weapons and blaming on patriot groups or whatever or I or who
[42:18.080 --> 42:23.280]  knows some foreign country all all bets are off folks to bring in martial law
[42:23.280 --> 42:27.920]  gut your bank accounts they'll get away with all of it persecute the tea party
[42:27.920 --> 42:31.040]  go after the gun owners and a lot of people here this is a we better roll
[42:31.040 --> 42:37.920]  over no rolling over is even worse you can't roll over to the devil and I
[42:37.920 --> 42:40.680]  thought Obama was just some frontman puppet now I've really been studying
[42:40.680 --> 42:44.920]  and what he's doing he's actually running a lot of stuff and he's only got
[42:44.920 --> 42:48.960]  flies flying around all over it's like the devil or something I just I can't
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.840]  handle it folks I can't handle it and I sure can't handle turning on TV and

[48:43.520 --> 48:50.960]  verse 8 11 when I was a child I talked like a child I thought like a child I
[48:50.960 --> 48:55.920]  reasoned like a child when I became a man I put the ways of childhood behind
[48:55.920 --> 49:02.920]  me for now we see only a reflection as in a mirror then we shall see the face to
[49:02.920 --> 49:10.280]  face now I know in part that I shall know fully even as I am fully known it's a
[49:10.280 --> 49:14.360]  very very deep folks I'm gonna read that again because I bumbled over it when I
[49:14.360 --> 49:18.920]  was a child I talked like a child I thought like a child I reasoned like a
[49:18.920 --> 49:25.160]  child I became a man I put the ways of childhood behind me or now we see only a
[49:25.160 --> 49:31.240]  reflection as in a mirror then we shall see face to face so it's saying like
[49:31.240 --> 49:37.400]  you're a child and you're a man then you die and see God then you really know it's
[49:37.400 --> 49:44.880]  it's the next level it's what that's saying now I know in part then I shall
[49:44.880 --> 49:50.360]  know fully even as I am fully known and that's the thing my flesh folks that
[49:50.360 --> 49:54.680]  lust after beautiful women and wants to get in fights with people when they get
[49:54.680 --> 49:59.240]  in my face and is hateful towards my enemies my flesh is strong it's also
[49:59.240 --> 50:02.520]  cowardly it's like don't report this new stuff don't report this Navy Seal
[50:02.520 --> 50:07.160]  murder stuff don't report this stuff they'll kill you enjoy yourself go have
[50:07.160 --> 50:12.920]  fun go to the Caribbean go to yeety and I'm like yeah yeah but my spirit says
[50:12.920 --> 50:17.240]  you're gonna go all the way and you're not gonna back off one inch full force
[50:17.240 --> 50:21.880]  and I guess other people don't have a strong spirit I feel sad for him I
[50:21.880 --> 50:26.440]  because my spirit drives everything overdrives all the animal everything
[50:26.440 --> 50:33.920]  it's in charge my spirits in charge not my flesh it's there a little devil on my
[50:33.920 --> 50:38.840]  soul's shoulder my flesh tell me what I should do tell me I deserve this I
[50:38.840 --> 50:42.720]  deserve that all whatever the public scum they're dumb they don't deserve you
[50:42.720 --> 50:45.880]  to even tell them the truth just join the dark side it's gonna be great it'll
[50:45.880 --> 50:49.160]  work out it'll be okay but then I think about what the dark side does the
[50:49.160 --> 50:53.440]  innocent people innocent children I'll never sign on to that I'll never join
[50:53.440 --> 50:58.320]  that I'll never be part of that even though folks I I get the dark side I
[50:58.320 --> 51:02.720]  understand it I can swim in it I know it I have discernment I have knowledge of
[51:02.720 --> 51:08.320]  good and evil of course I'm corrupted just to even have the knowledge of evil
[51:08.320 --> 51:17.280]  and to understand it I'm evil I am evil I am man yes I am to quote Metallica but
[51:17.280 --> 51:20.920]  it doesn't mean I want to join it doesn't mean my spirit wants to go with it
[51:20.920 --> 51:25.800]  doesn't mean my heart is with it my heart says and my spirit says I don't
[51:25.800 --> 51:30.400]  care what you do to me I'm never joining you it's not even a choice with me
[51:30.400 --> 51:37.640]  it's automatic it's complete one foot in hell one in heaven that's how we all
[51:37.640 --> 51:43.840]  are folks we're all trapped in purgatory that's what this planet is
[51:45.160 --> 51:51.320]  this is the test right now between heaven and hell it's heaven it's hell
[51:51.320 --> 51:57.600]  it's real better decide which side you're on folks because if you're lukewarm
[51:57.600 --> 52:02.440]  you know where you're going even either hot or cold I spit you out of my mouth
[52:02.440 --> 52:06.120]  if you just joined us I don't mean to be preaching I need to get to all this news
[52:06.120 --> 52:16.000]  there's so much to cover go to the ebt clip from the news first and we'll break
[52:16.000 --> 52:22.120]  it down a glitch today involving food stamp debit style cards is being blamed
[52:22.120 --> 52:27.280]  on a computer system failure and not the government shutdown a smokes woman for
[52:27.280 --> 52:32.200]  Xerox confirmed the problem and said it was affecting people in 17 states where
[52:32.200 --> 52:37.000]  it runs the debit style card system the problem forced many shoppers to abandon
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.200]  groceries at the checkout counter because their cards wouldn't work there's no
[52:41.200 --> 52:47.240]  word in exactly when this problem will be fixed yeah Xerox runs things like the
[52:47.240 --> 52:54.880]  toll waves the the the they outsource to India well just like JP Morgan does the
[52:54.880 --> 52:58.560]  customer service for welfare we're gonna have welfare my little has some jobs
[52:58.560 --> 53:01.680]  administering it but no can't do that it's all about profit it's all about
[53:01.680 --> 53:07.160]  control it's all about controlled economies a it's worse than 17 states be
[53:07.160 --> 53:11.440]  on Twitter and Facebook we've got the photos big articles out tomorrow and
[53:11.440 --> 53:20.280]  info wars.com there was systems out all over the country federal system and it's
[53:20.280 --> 53:22.720]  kind of like the glitches the people seem their bank accounts of their
[53:22.720 --> 53:27.640]  suddenly zero money there there's all sorts of chicanery going on and is this
[53:27.640 --> 53:32.160]  how you're supposed to live you're born you get a card you go to a Walmart or
[53:32.160 --> 53:36.040]  wherever Walmart I think says 20% of their businesses EBT cards and then
[53:36.040 --> 53:40.520]  other people's money buys you food and you go back and watch television all
[53:40.520 --> 53:44.200]  day where you hear Obama say I'm gonna give you free health care when you
[53:44.200 --> 53:47.640]  already had free health care the free health care system gets rid of your
[53:47.640 --> 53:51.960]  health care brings in eugenics care but why should I even talk to Obama
[53:51.960 --> 53:54.720]  supporters I know we're listing out there on AM and FM stations they don't
[53:54.720 --> 54:01.200]  know what eugenics is they have grown up with with welfare and all that I feel
[54:01.200 --> 54:06.200]  sorry for them I want them to go out and start a business and have the ideas and
[54:06.200 --> 54:10.400]  believe in themselves and be empowered but all they think is I'm racist or I'm
[54:10.400 --> 54:17.080]  I'm evil or I'm whatever they have no idea what slaves they are that's very
[54:17.080 --> 54:21.040]  very frustrating meanwhile again here's the article up on info wars.com by
[54:21.040 --> 54:25.960]  Mike Adams food stamp recipients panic as federal EBT system crashes government
[54:25.960 --> 54:32.080]  IT systems rapidly unraveling and Mike Adams as a programmer goes over all
[54:32.080 --> 54:37.240]  that's happening with the system meanwhile under Obamacare under common
[54:37.240 --> 54:40.880]  core that teaches two plus two equals four Adon Salazar writing from full
[54:40.880 --> 54:45.080]  works dot com high school assessment students decide who lives and dies
[54:45.080 --> 54:48.360]  under limited health care they did this in Europe 30 years ago they actually
[54:48.360 --> 54:52.080]  teach them the kids decide well you're old because they tell you there's only
[54:52.080 --> 54:56.160]  so much money and it's a socialized system so somebody's got to die for you
[54:56.160 --> 55:00.040]  to get your health care and they decide to kill grandma just like Newsweek said
[55:00.040 --> 55:03.320]  the case for killing granny of course there are no death panels though they
[55:03.320 --> 55:07.200]  just federally teach kids two plus two equals five and dodge balls racist and
[55:07.200 --> 55:11.760]  that's me but I'm not kidding that's me banned my wife had family point-blank
[55:11.760 --> 55:17.560]  teller Christianity is racist and you mean like there's racist no no no just
[55:17.560 --> 55:21.600]  being Christian is if you don't like I something tastes at a restaurant you
[55:21.600 --> 55:24.480]  just say it's racist it's like a it's like I don't need to be intellectual I
[55:24.480 --> 55:32.000]  just say racism I think it's racist continuing I can hear CBS reporting on
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.880]  it computer glitch blame for an nationwide EBT system shut down on
[55:36.880 --> 55:41.520]  Saturday the CBS could sit right it was nationwide it wasn't 17 states here's
[55:41.520 --> 55:48.240]  another one AP Z rocks access for store for food stamps so we live by the EBT
[55:48.240 --> 55:55.240]  card and reportedly that fights broke out freak outs people were panicking in
[55:55.240 --> 56:00.040]  just a day of not having their EBT card a member 101 million people like to have
[56:00.040 --> 56:05.920]  the headline right here 101 million people now are impartial EBT 49 million
[56:05.920 --> 56:11.720]  are on total EBT infection here are the headlines 101 million get food aid from
[56:11.720 --> 56:15.160]  federal government count number full-time private sector workers you mean the
[56:15.160 --> 56:22.280]  racist terrorist and continuing my friends doesn't matter the Republicans
[56:22.280 --> 56:26.360]  and I had Ron Paul former congressman on Friday and I said you know Mitchell
[56:26.360 --> 56:31.000]  Connell's right this Obamacare so bad and such a rip-off and written to defraud
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.680]  people we fought it we tried to stop it let them have it now do whatever
[56:35.680 --> 56:41.200]  Obama wants with the already passed bill so and was weird within a few hours I
[56:41.200 --> 56:44.360]  stopped people to call Congress I'm sure it was others as well everybody got it
[56:44.360 --> 56:48.280]  at that point system total fraud don't let them blame it on libertarians and
[56:48.280 --> 56:54.040]  people and constitutionalists within hours Bainer went to Obama and said
[56:54.040 --> 56:59.560]  here's everything you want for two months and Obama said no for the security
[56:59.560 --> 57:06.240]  of the dollar which actually hurts the dollar I'm going to not do this and now
[57:06.240 --> 57:09.600]  he's saying I want immigration I want open borders and I want your guns
[57:09.600 --> 57:13.280]  basically now he'll hold everything hostage and all the welfare checks and
[57:13.280 --> 57:18.000]  threaten to burn down America with his army of 101 million welfare people if we
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.440]  don't turn everything over to him that's the threat that's the false flag here
[57:21.440 --> 57:26.360]  it is Obama rejects latest house GOP offer they said everything you want
[57:26.360 --> 57:32.040]  it's yours and he said no people say well why because he knows his
[57:32.040 --> 57:39.360]  constituents literally cannot tie their shoelaces literally want to be raped by

[1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:12.680]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network all
[1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:15.880]  right I'm not taking calls tonight because I've got so much news I haven't
[1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:20.320]  even gotten to yet when we come back in the next segment it's a longer
[1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:23.640]  segments uncover it all I'll get into the missing notes and the latest
[1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:30.040]  developments on that front and then I will get more into the government shut
[1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:37.120]  down and Obamacare and what's happening on that front and then I will get into
[1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:43.040]  world's top bankers one of dire consequences of us defaults and I've
[1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:47.520]  got some technology news special ops uniform will transform commandos into
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:51.800]  iron man that's been a little plan for 50 years but now it's actually coming
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:59.200]  true we're gonna look at that and more coming up but first off when we return
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:09.040]  after this break I'm going to get into the missing nuke story and again just
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:12.520]  because a lot of listeners I don't think can conceptualize this especially new
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:16.680]  listeners because I don't really conceptualize it I mean I'm gonna be
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:20.000]  honest with you we have a high-level source that says man was a big freak
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:24.440]  out there were nukes transferred they weren't supposed to be here there wasn't
[1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:28.760]  paperwork the police wouldn't let them leave because they already had previous
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:34.080]  orders as big freak out they're going to South Carolina and then hours later
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:37.600]  Lindsey Graham's comes out and says South Carolina will be nuked if we don't
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:40.800]  attack Syria I mean it just goes on and on then the two top nuke generals get
[1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:46.800]  fired now other generals have been fired and I don't even know what to say
[1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:51.680]  anymore I mean I just don't know what to say anymore I it's bad okay I mean do
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:56.720]  you think I was happy when all the Navy SEAL family started going public saying
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:59.400]  that
[1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:04.480]  23 of them have been murdered on SEAL Team 6 because it was really you know some
[1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:08.840]  have been lied and look alike at that compound it was all fake you think I was
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:15.640]  happy when my Navy SEAL source of two what was the father one was actual Navy SEAL
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:24.400]  do you think I was happy that that was true no I was distraught that's the
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:29.760]  issue is that it gets worse and worse I mean even Alex Jones to talk about
[1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:37.080]  myself she's a lean a third person doesn't believe it's this bad because I
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:42.520]  can intellectually get it and war game it and look at worst case best case
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:48.240]  median scenarios but then when I realized that it's it's it's it's beyond my
[1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:53.480]  worst case I go wait a minute that's historical Hitler Stalin Mao Pol Pot all
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:03:01.880]  these other people that Genghis Khan Caligula Aztec leaders Mayan leaders
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:06.000]  Chin leaders I mean it's the same story crazy people going nuts on a power
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.960]  trap and I'm like oh my god oh my god and then I have this weird battle that
[1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:17.000]  goes on constantly of sell everything keep doing the radio show shut the whole
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:29.160]  news division down run to northern Europe or Switzerland but then my spirit

[1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:27.860]  the first report to say that president Kennedy has been seriously wounded by
[1:06:27.860 --> 1:06:35.080]  the shooting it is a big idea a new order

[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:05.000]  tearing down the barricades then riot police showed up when they tried to
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:08.360]  protest at the White House began attacking old men putting people in
[1:08:08.360 --> 1:08:12.520]  wheelchairs the videos are all up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:17.040]  com and the old men successfully battled and defeated the police who looked
[1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:21.480]  like you in toilet attendance I mean that's they hire their buddies now so
[1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:24.840]  you're not a chicken that communists they don't hire you especially in the
[1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:30.960]  district of criminals DC that's all coming up but first off back on
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:37.040]  September 3rd of this year a high-level source at Dias Air Force Base in West
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:46.120]  Texas home of the global Air Force aircraft nuclear strike command one of
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:52.040]  the main shack bases in the entire United States about the main base we got
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:09:02.880]  the intel that there was a military transfer of nuclear warheads in four
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:08.960]  trucks without paperwork and that the base police that are civilian police
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:12.440]  said well this is against the law there's not supposed to be nukes here what
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:15.520]  is going on with these trucks what is leaving we're supposed to inspect base
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:19.080]  commander came out and said no they asked the truck drivers who weren't even
[1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:22.480]  part of the regular federal contractors that do it they said look we're just
[1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:26.080]  told we're going to South Carolina as the police said fine we'll follow the
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:30.360]  order I'll let this go you're to say where it's going and my source was
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:34.840]  privy to all this going on and I said I don't know what this means we got to
[1:09:34.840 --> 1:09:40.200]  report it it's a good source this went on same source reported weeks before in
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:45.240]  the whole Syria deal that the B2 bombers had flown out of there to go to the
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:50.200]  ego Garcia out in the off the coast of Africa south of the Persian Gulf weeks
[1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:57.040]  later that was confirmed now I think the best way to get to this new story of
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:01.160]  missing nuclear weapons and why it's so important is I think we should play from
[1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:07.440]  2007 the CNN and CBS news also the Pentagon video press release about how
[1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:10.360]  big a deal this was last time it happens you understand why it's a big deal
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:15.680]  this was six missing cruise missiles let's go to the CNN tell people what we
[1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:21.240]  do know it was last Thursday a B-52 bomber loaded six air-launched cruise
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:26.680]  missiles under its wings took off from Minot North Dakota flew the length of
[1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:31.080]  the United States to Barksdale Louisiana those missiles were supposed to be
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:34.840]  decommissioned there was just one little problem when they landed in Louisiana
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:39.760]  they found that those missiles that were supposed to be basically decommissioned
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:44.680]  and taken out of service each of them had a nuclear warhead on them six nuclear
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:49.400]  warheads flying the length of the United States and no one seemed to know it to
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:54.280]  say the least a major investigation is underway now the Air Force officer in
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:58.880]  charge of the squadron loading the munitions relieved of duty they took an
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:03.200]  immediate inventory of all Air Force nuclear weapons to make sure they had
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:06.960]  everything they say the public was never in any danger
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:11.960]  we're not armed that there would have been no nuclear detonation if in some
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:17.640]  fashion the missiles had basically fallen off the wings of the airplane but
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:21.920]  really small comfort to most of the military and to many Americans
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:26.400]  perhaps this sort of thing is not supposed to happen nuclear weapons are
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:32.880]  the most guarded the most secure items supposedly in the US military arsenal one
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:37.240]  military official telling us today this is unprecedented nobody remembers
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:44.480]  another instance like this okay so I get a panicked high level call that says
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:49.280]  this may be the last time I ever talked to you here's the info I'm risking my
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:53.080]  life to do this here it is and by the way that person will not talk to us now
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:56.120]  even though we've done all sorts of things to get through to them through
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:04.000]  other channels you can imagine what we've done not gonna say we drove to West
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:09.120]  Texas and knocked on doors at 2 a.m. all hell broke loose by the way at the base
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:12.840]  and the base has never denied this you'd think the commander would come out and
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:18.040]  say we were saying it wasn't true so this was a big deal when this happened
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:20.080]  you think I'm gonna go on air and say this happened if we didn't have a high
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:26.680]  level source saying it this happened okay either our source that's that is very
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:32.000]  high level is lying or this went on and it's happened before and it's a big deal
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:41.560]  unprecedented okay now since then the number two of US strategic nuclear
[1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:46.840]  forces over all of them fired in a made-up deal the local police said no he
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:49.680]  didn't have fake ships we don't know what you're talking about they claimed
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:55.120]  a head Navy officer over nukes this admiral was was with fake chips the
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:13:04.520]  casino turns out none of it's even true now the number one major general all
[1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:12.320]  that's above that's general the major general Michael J. Kerry is fired and
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:17.240]  they said because the president does not trust him and by the way AP had this
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:20.480]  leak to them AP who's gone public saying there's a war on the press we would
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:23.480]  tell you that forever and that the country's in deep trouble AP on Friday
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:27.400]  so there's a war on the press in America's in trouble AP's establishment
[1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:30.560]  folks why would they talk like that because there's a total mutiny of the
[1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:35.800]  people that worked there of how crazy this is I mean is working with a new
[1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:40.240]  order a suicide pack for all you people obviously it's not you get now this is a
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:48.440]  criminal takeover anybody with half a brain has got to go public they want to
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:51.960]  say they want to make it clear it wasn't operations related but earlier they
[1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:57.520]  said it was failure to follow an order and to carry out a basic duty and he's
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:02.840]  now been removed the head of all of the nuclear forces all of them all of them
[1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:09.440]  all of them and AP in the version Friday with that's a new version we had to
[1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:12.360]  dig up the one we have in the stacks while I print everything they memory
[1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:17.080]  hold it be online it said that it was national security and that they didn't
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:21.960]  want released why he was terminated and it was a leak normally this would be big
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:26.040]  news folks now AP says the White House doesn't even want you to know this is
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:30.240]  happening it gets worse they've removed two other generals this week that no one
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:34.240]  wants you to know about there is a purge folks going on right now in the
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:37.480]  military our high-level sources say there's a litmus test will you fire on
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:41.400]  Americans will you bring in martial law will you and they're saying no no no
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:45.320]  no they're being removed just like they had ten top generals removed in the
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:51.000]  month after Benghazi because they all know that was a hit job I mean this is
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:55.880]  insane that's like I'm in the middle of Valkyrie operation Valkyrie or something
[1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:59.040]  I mean I don't even know what's going on at this point believe me there's no
[1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:03.040]  bodies I can say this is above my pay grade there's nobody's pay grade can
[1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:08.120]  handle this type of insanity this is madness this is all a bunch of crazy
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:12.680]  globalist kleptocrats who want to break America forever and dominate it they
[1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:16.040]  want to rule the world they want to run the Empire that runs the world and they
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:19.480]  when they hate the American people and the troops that built the Empire at the
[1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:22.960]  same time here's another one top new commanders terminated following missing
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:30.340]  nuclear warheads report here's another one this is out of wired danger room two

[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:43.080]  calm present planet.com you can listen on XM 244 or on over a hundred and sixty
[1:21:43.080 --> 1:21:47.640]  MNFM affiliates across the country and of course on the internet streams and
[1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:51.600]  the free podcast and info wars.com and present planet.com and video feeds at
[1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:56.560]  presentplanet.tv okay so the Marine Corps Commandant came out and told the
[1:21:56.560 --> 1:22:02.880]  general staff of the Marine Corps that they fired two top Marine commanders
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:07.840]  because they allowed a Taliban attack on a base last year there were more attacks
[1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:12.800]  today and this is total bull and I see reports every week where they're firing
[1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:18.840]  generals and admirals in the Army the Navy the Marines the Air Force and I've
[1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:24.600]  talked to my NSA sources like Wayne Madsen you name it there is just an all
[1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:29.000]  out purge just like you see the AP saying there's a purge of journalists and
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:33.920]  harassment I can handle death threats I can handle stuff people wouldn't believe
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:38.280]  if I talked about it on air the average AP reporter or Reuters reporter gets a
[1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:41.440]  death threat and by the way tells them what their kid was wearing when they went
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:46.120]  to school that morning those people shut up real fast the average Congress
[1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:51.040]  person gets the call about remember 10 years ago when you shoot on your wife
[1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:54.080]  yeah that was our operative do what you're told her she's gonna go public
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:58.320]  this is how they're running the show just like I told you the NSA was spying
[1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:02.960]  on you just like I told you all the back doors were built into the internet for
[1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:07.640]  the NSA and private corporations to spy that's in London Guardian and AP today
[1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:13.440]  like let me just give it a headline saying it US fears backdoor routes into
[1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:17.960]  the net because it's building them to that's London Guardian right there not
[1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:23.240]  the US it's the globalists that run the country and again I don't want to live
[1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:26.360]  in Russia I don't like the Russian government many respects they're not
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:30.080]  running my life though I don't like the chai comms the globalists are in bed with
[1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:33.360]  them but they're not running my life they're trying to it's the globalists
[1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:37.680]  that are here running our lives so back to the missing nooks go ahead and cue up
[1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:40.960]  the CBS one about all the other missing nooks effect I have an article right
[1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:51.600]  here dealing with all the different reports of 57 nukes effect will pull
[1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:54.680]  that up put it on screen for viewers that had been accidentally dropped in the
[1:23:54.680 --> 1:24:01.280]  ocean that didn't detonate and drills and and test the difference here there's
[1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:04.440]  a New York Times dozens of atomic warheads lost in sea by superpowers
[1:24:04.440 --> 1:24:10.040]  study says but that's nothing that can happen in a set test and you and then
[1:24:10.040 --> 1:24:15.760]  it doesn't detonate then you lose it in deep water this is nukes loaded in 2007
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:21.560]  sent down under orders we don't know who ordered because people were killed that
[1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:24.920]  were ordered to do it and then to be sent to the Middle East we know until
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:31.200]  security at the base at Barksdale said no you're not taking off arm security
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:35.520]  the guys that guard the weapons said these aren't supposed to be here there
[1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:39.440]  is an order you're waiting till we get orders and then they said no we've been
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:43.440]  ordered to take off and they said no you're not taking off this time we learn
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:49.400]  about what's going on with nukes and no one will cover it but Michael Savage
[1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:53.240]  Michael Savage covered it on Friday and said that yeah they're covering missing
[1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:56.840]  nukes and all these top nuke generals are being fired there's other stuff going
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:25:00.280]  on this is important it should be looked into and we appreciate that because
[1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:04.800]  Michael Savage terrestrially has like 400 radio stations and we have 160 and
[1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:07.560]  most of Michaels are bigger than ours we're not in competition with Savage and
[1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:11.880]  he knows that we just care about surviving and having a future just like
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:16.080]  Savage does and I've always said compared to the other talk show host you can
[1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:19.760]  tell Savage actually wants to have a future in a free country you're not
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:22.480]  going to hear the others the other big host and we all know who they are
[1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:27.000]  talking about this stuff because at the end of the day it's all about being a
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.400]  fake neocon fake right winger who just sits there and plays ball with the
[1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:36.200]  establishment and doesn't do anything dangerous listen we are in danger because
[1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:41.120]  nobody will stand up for themselves and I'm not picking and choosing here I mean
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:43.880]  I think Lynn Beck's been doing a better job covering the New World Order and
[1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:48.000]  false flag terror attacks and FEMA camps and all the stuff he denied five years
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:52.240]  ago good listen when I go to bed at night I don't think who's the biggest talk
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:56.840]  show host okay I want to be a big talk show host how to sold out 15 years
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:02.600]  ago and played the party tune I'd already be bigger than all these guys I'm here
[1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:07.920]  on air exposing the New World Order because there's no future if we don't
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:12.200]  do that so we salute Michael Savage covering this on Friday I didn't hear
[1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:16.880]  it I listened routinely missed it Friday night I've got a bunch of calls people I
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:20.480]  know heard it so I know what happened I was looking for the video though it's
[1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:24.400]  usually on YouTube the audio they put it to video and haven't found it as soon as
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:29.120]  we find it it'll be up on info wars.com and present planet.com I called one of
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:34.320]  our auxiliary affiliated doesn't work with us or for us but he contributes I
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:39.320]  called Gucci Artie and said I heard you're in the report he's talking about
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:42.960]  you so will you please go find it new report for us because I want to hear it
[1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:49.080]  and again it's important if 10 million people a day that listen to him hear
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:53.800]  this so then it becomes safer for other people to talk about it it's kind of
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:57.920]  like we talked about the Navy SEALs first being murdered then Savage had the
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:01.480]  courage to talk about it and then six months later the mainstream media had
[1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:05.560]  to cover it so there's different avenues to get stories out there's drudgerport.com
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:12.640]  there's Michael Savage we put his side up on TV for folks to see that and go to
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:17.920]  that there's only a few other avenues that are willing to cover big stories
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:23.760]  that other corporate media won't cover as far as I see it things like
[1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:30.160]  drudgerport.com Michael Savage's radio show those are a crossover no man's land
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:34.960]  they're giant outlets that reach bigger audiences than dinosaur mainstream
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:39.360]  media but they're not dinosaur mainstream media and nobody's perfect
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:43.360]  you know I'm not perfect drudge isn't perfect savages and perfect the point is
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:48.880]  is that consistently they are willing to cover things that the left and the right
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:52.840]  both won't cover and at the end of the day if we don't cover these things it's
[1:27:52.840 --> 1:27:57.440]  over I mean I'll guarantee you people like drudge people like Savage they're
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:02.080]  willing to get the threats the heat the whatever talk about liberty drudge is
[1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:05.840]  carried for three days our article about the TSA carries these cryptic
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:10.360]  announcements about if you laugh at us or question us we will arrest you there's
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:15.120]  no free speech in airports that's airing everywhere drudge picked that up
[1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:18.520]  Michael Savage.com I knew that but I wanted to double check that's a good
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:23.200]  looking website we're about to update info wars.com and prisonplotter.com
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:26.800]  very very soon it's gonna be a nice clean modern looking site they're good
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:29.840]  sights now but it's kind of a 70-year-old design that's all happening
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:33.280]  right now at info wars.com and prisonplotter.com but all that is a
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:41.680]  side issue the point here is that I don't know what's going on with the
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:45.680]  nukes but they're sacking all these nuke generals we're a real outlet that puts
[1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:49.960]  out real news everybody knows that we don't make stuff up so people better
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:53.960]  look into this everybody who cares about their kids cares about their family
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:57.200]  because we could be looking at nuclear blackmail run by Obama and the crime
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:03.920]  syndicate the controls him. Ben Swan here we are winning alternative media is

[1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:14.120]  broadcasting network network from the front lines of the information war it's
[1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:22.000]  Alex Jones if you just joined us we've got video up on info wars.com and
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:26.760]  prisonplanet.com riot police use force against elderly vets outside
[1:33:26.760 --> 1:33:30.680]  Winehouse and these veterans are just trying to go protest at the Winehouse
[1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:36.240]  that's a non-free speech zone folks I've been there and these people in UN
[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:43.480]  bright blue uniforms these are federal riot police in bright blue uniforms come
[1:33:43.480 --> 1:33:48.640]  up and start hitting them with metal batons and like 75 year old guys are
[1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:53.120]  like just ramming the cops up against the wall and the cops are just groveling
[1:33:53.120 --> 1:34:04.720]  around in fear just ultra bizarre but hats off to the World War two vets right
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:09.280]  through current veterans and active duty that route there with them as well up
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:12.360]  against the nanny state where does when you can look these federal police are
[1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:17.320]  like handpicked trendy some you can guarantee that these are absolute Obama
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:24.280]  loyalists and pathetic imagine a real battle with these people you can tell
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:28.400]  which side's gonna be running real fast because they're all into the fear if
[1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:32.960]  you're not afraid of them it totally freaks them out whereas a real man's
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:36.360]  only excited if some bully starts a fight was twice as big as them that's
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:40.320]  only way even wake up to kick somebody's butt these little coward types are just
[1:34:40.320 --> 1:34:45.560]  not used to people that don't completely grovel to them a bunch of videos up on
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:51.640]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com but to make a long story short here people
[1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:54.640]  want to talk show hosts to be able to tell them they know what's going on and
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:34:58.120]  I'm pretty good at figuring out generally what's gonna happen with a piece of
[1:34:58.120 --> 1:35:02.040]  legislation or something like that I don't know what's going on with the
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:06.080]  missing nukes I know that this was a high level source told me this all hell
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:09.840]  broke loose once it happened Lindsey Graham said that his state will be nuked
[1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:13.880]  there you know and all this stuff a day after we said it all these top generals
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:17.680]  the head nuked general the second command they're all being removed flimsy the
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:20.440]  media saying it's suspicious they're not supposed to say they've even been
[1:35:20.440 --> 1:35:27.040]  fired the Marines are firing all these top people there's a major shake-up
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:32.600]  going on and you've got ebt cards nationwide going down over the weekend
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:36.880]  and people freaking out over that you've got the Republicans capitulating to
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:42.600]  Obama and saying we'll give you whatever you want fine you can have the dead
[1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:47.440]  increases you can have the total Obamacare it's all yours you own it and
[1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:52.400]  Obama says no that might endanger our credit that's the quote I have the
[1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:58.000]  article right here in the Associated Press if you don't just give me unlimited
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:03.640]  just sign a blank check a permanent dead increase basically and they're like well
[1:36:03.640 --> 1:36:06.800]  we can't do that that's all another piece of legislation they just it doesn't
[1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:14.200]  matter my constituents have IQs below wrote very low very low below room
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:18.640]  temperature you will give me what I want or I'm gonna blame the ebt cards not
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:25.160]  working on you and basically Boehner has now completely prostrated himself
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:30.280]  before the dear leader and this is the clowered and piven plan which I use
[1:36:30.280 --> 1:36:34.600]  clowered and piven because it's well known socialist kleptocrats always try
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:39.240]  to implode an economy an existing system to destroy the old system to build
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:44.320]  the new and in the crisis they pose as savers and Obama is confident that his
[1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:47.840]  illegal aliens that are allowed to protest to demonstrate in all the war
[1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:51.760]  memorials as veterans are kept out they're gonna vote to take the guns
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:55.400]  they're gonna vote for socialism they're gonna vote for their free welfare so
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:36:59.640]  we're all the other welfare people and then you've got all the other folks that
[1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:03.680]  are on disability for other reasons and I'm not judging them the system shut down
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:07.440]  the factory shut down the wealth to make you dependent now you're dependent and
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:12.360]  it doesn't matter if you're going into a meat grinder you've got to submit to him
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:17.280]  you've got to submit to socialism and so MSNBC announces your kids don't belong
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:21.520]  to you they belong to the state in official TV ads they announce we're
[1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:25.320]  gonna give you force inoculations they announce we're gonna force feed you GMOs
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:31.240]  they announce we're gonna fund Al Qaeda no humiliation is enough for the
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:35.960]  American people this is the destruction of the Republic and now you know why
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:40.760]  Obama five years ago came out and said the number one enemy is returning
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:44.480]  veterans and gun owners and libertarians and constitutionalists and in the
[1:37:44.480 --> 1:37:50.840]  Fedders and Ron Paul supporters and Patriots and Aaron Russo and Alex Jones
[1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:56.920]  and anybody else that even if I mean if you like a 57 Chevy if you like
[1:37:56.920 --> 1:38:02.320]  Marilyn Monroe you're on a terror list and I'm not even joking okay I mean if

[1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:21.000]  tyranny and death camps and mass arrest and collectivization like Ukraine and
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:26.840]  Poland went under during the red terror you are going to be targeted period
[1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:30.480]  doesn't matter if you've gone along with it they know you've got a
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:35.360]  subscription to classic cars that's enough to go to a death camp you think

[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:34.360]  lines of the info war here's the problem the average person a doctor a
[1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:39.600]  software engineer scientist a manager listening doesn't think of themselves as
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:43.240]  a leader in a fight for liberty they don't even imagine the political or
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:46.840]  corporate system where they would do that you've got to build that system you've
[1:47:46.840 --> 1:47:51.560]  got to do it in little ways every day or become a slave because there are
[1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:56.960]  special interests that want to make money off of controlling systems not off
[1:47:56.960 --> 1:48:03.000]  of producing and so many men I know that are high IQ or intelligent they just
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.440]  don't have the guts the spirit the intellect or they're so selfish they
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:10.440]  think I'll just make money my own system and stay out of the way and let you
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:13.600]  fight for my freedom but now they're learning there's no future for them as
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:18.640]  well you either get involved now and stand up or we're gonna go into a
[1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:22.880]  nightmare situation and hey have you got the money to flee the country and go
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:26.680]  somewhere else more power to you the problem is it's a global kleptocratic
[1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:30.320]  system they're setting up they're going after they're trying to shut down
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:35.120]  Switzerland right now you're not gonna run from this ladies and gentlemen at
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:40.640]  least not for long the only way is to stand against it and I understand we've
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:44.760]  all been habitualized that all conflict is through ritualized fake sports on
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:48.800]  TV but no there's a real world going on there's real reasons for your male
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:52.600]  instinct there's real reasons for your motherly instinct to love your children
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:58.760]  to care about others and folks better get that instinct or bow down and become
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:03.280]  conscious slaves I'm just here so that you know there's a choice some of the
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:07.200]  news here veterans again remove the barricades for memorials and bring them
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:12.080]  to the White House as tokens to show that they're not going to be blocked
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:15.040]  from going to memorials where the leal aliens are only allowed to dance around
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:19.120]  and have events and so again we now have footage of the police attacking veterans
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:23.760]  with batons and the veterans fought back and then the the Green Police and UN
[1:49:23.760 --> 1:49:29.160]  uniforms then grovel grovel in fear here's a Reuters article top bankers
[1:49:29.160 --> 1:49:33.440]  warned of the dire consequences of US defaults they've been maneuvering us like
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:37.240]  all other countries in fiat debt towards collapse but they want an
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:42.000]  incremental long collapse where they suck a strice slowly not where we have a
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:45.520]  chance to see the threat and struggle against it so one of the world's most
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:49.160]  powerful bankers warned of terrible consequences of the US defaults in its
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:53.840]  debt so the Republicans came to Obama and said here's everything you want we
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:58.360]  we give in because your Obamacare is so horrible you're gonna get the blame and
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:02.680]  Obama said I'm not gonna sign it my constituents are dumber than dirt he
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:06.080]  actually came out and said I'm not signing it you give me unlimited blank

[1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:53.760]  article I thought this was funny as you can look it up it was MSNBC and others
[1:51:53.760 --> 1:51:58.520]  that were caught a few years ago with Nielsen paying for fake ratings I forgot
[1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:02.800]  to tell you to search that go to the NSA database Google the two-way spy system
[1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:11.440]  and search MSNBC or Nielsen caught in fake ratings and if memory serves it'll
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:15.760]  be MSNBC was the main one with fake ratings I mean nobody watches that but a
