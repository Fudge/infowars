[00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.359]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.119]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.880]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.460]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.021]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:17.202]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:24.725]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.926]  Why do I have so many websites?
[00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:30.027]  Why do I have Infowars.com, Infowars.net?
[00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:40.414]  PrisonPlanet.tv, EarthNews.us, JonesReport.com.
[00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:41.374]  Why do I have that?
[00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:50.016]  Well, it's because our servers get attacked, our servers get hacked, we also just have regular technical difficulties.
[00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:58.958]  As we get more and more traffic to the websites, it gets harder and harder to keep them up and to be in the format we have with lots of photos and graphics and images.
[00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:02.849]  Just massive traffic.
[00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:07.950]  Millions and millions of people visiting the sites every day.
[00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.552]  Or to be accurate, about every two days over a million people visit all the sites together.
[00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:16.373]  Millions and millions a week.
[00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:19.855]  And InfoWars.com has been down for two hours.
[00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:22.936]  John Harmon says it was down before 9 a.m.
[00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:23.516]  this morning.
[00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.517]  I noticed it at about 9.15.
[00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:28.578]  We're getting phone calls and emails about it.
[00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:29.598]  Yes, we know.
[00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:37.751]  But this is probably just a technical problem and we're working on it.
[00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:53.240]  The bigger issue is the internet itself is under attack and free speech on the web is under attack by governments worldwide, by corporations, and it is happening now.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.822]  It isn't coming, it isn't over the next hill.
[00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:57.983]  It is here with us now.
[00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:07.159]  And it's the incremental restriction and phasing out of what is the Internet today, the creation of new networks that are highly controlled.
[00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.201]  Whole governments like Australia are preparing to filter out basically all alternative news.
[00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:20.523]  Quote, free government wireless networks provided through your tax money nationwide, in Europe and the United States, openly announcing
[00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:26.804]  That basically any alternative news sites will be banned.
[00:02:26.804 --> 00:02:31.627]  It will be a consortium of approved sites.
[00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:44.095]  And then once that intensifies, Google and YouTube and others, they can intensify their censoring, which they already do with Wanted and Abandoned, because you won't have a choice, you won't have anywhere else to go.
[00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:45.996]  So take that as an example.
[00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:50.599]  We can get around hacks and denial of service attacks and massive traffic,
[00:02:54.145 --> 00:03:01.186]  But we cannot get around government censorship without a political answer.
[00:03:01.186 --> 00:03:14.749]  I mean, they announced eight months ago in Canada and the United States that Time Warner and Comcast are only going to let you visit a couple thousand websites when you surf the web.
[00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:16.930]  Out of the hundreds of millions that are out there.
[00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.030]  Hundreds of millions of websites.
[00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.771]  They say there's tens of billions of pages, but hundreds of millions of sites
[00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:25.637]  Run by hundreds of millions of people.
[00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:27.298]  True diversity of thought and debate.
[00:03:27.298 --> 00:03:34.824]  You can find the best in man, the worst in man, on the web.
[00:03:34.824 --> 00:03:51.837]  And I noticed about six months ago, Time Warner Cable, if I type a URL wrong in on my Time Warner Cable Internet Roadrunner at home, or at the office, it takes me to an error page on Time Warner's site.
[00:03:53.314 --> 00:04:01.261]  And I've talked to IT people, that's because your traffic is running over their routers, well now it's running through them through a filter.
[00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:16.633]  And I've got a bunch of mainstream news reporting the facts that we were already aware of, but for anybody doubting it, they're now admitting it, that all of this snooping and all of this filtering and all of this tracking slows the web down and screws up the internet.
[00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:17.434]  But they know that.
[00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:25.732]  Then they force you onto internet too, and that's their stated plan from public internet to consortium meetings from London to Tokyo to Austin, Texas.
[00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:34.497]  You can go pull up the minutes of it, they meet once a year for over a decade and say their job is to kill the old net and force you onto a controlled internet.
[00:04:34.497 --> 00:04:38.360]  So what's happening in the United States, England, Canada, and Europe proper,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.002]  Is the gates are being put on.
[00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:49.471]  It's like you always went to a park and then one day you show up and there's a gate at the park's entrance and a fence but it's still open.
[00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:53.995]  And then you show back up the next week and it's locked but then come back the next day it's open.
[00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:57.079]  See they put the gates in place.
[00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.440]  You understand?
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.902]  Now they're going to start shutting it down.
[00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:08.053]  It was an inside job!
[00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:09.314]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:05:09.314 --> 00:05:11.034]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:05:11.034 --> 00:05:13.914]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:18.175]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:27.217]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[00:05:27.217 --> 00:05:32.118]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:43.498]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:05:43.498 --> 00:05:45.840]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.724]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:05:57.846 --> 00:06:01.408]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:06:01.408 --> 00:06:03.550]  High gasoline prices got you down?
[00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.551]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[00:06:06.457 --> 00:06:12.140]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.782]  Mechanics charge up to $300 to clean your fuel system.

[00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:12.312]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:07:12.312 --> 00:07:12.912]  Here is why.
[00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:24.183]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:07:24.183 --> 00:07:26.926]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:07:26.926 --> 00:07:29.048]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.029]  this fall?
[00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.889]  Don't wait!
[00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:34.893]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.
[00:07:34.893 --> 00:07:35.654]  Get the details at
[00:07:35.674 --> 00:07:36.634]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:07.494]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.494 --> 00:08:24.850]  Governor Jesse Ventura called me two days ago and said, I want to come on and thank your audience for helping out Senator Dean Barkley.
[00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:33.241]  Put the call out here and over $40,000 came into the campaign allowing them to buy the TV ads.
[00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:39.543]  They have a good shot of winning and the ads are now airing starting today.
[00:08:39.543 --> 00:08:45.844]  But he had a funeral he had to go to yesterday, so we're going to have him on, but not for electioneering in the next hour.
[00:08:45.844 --> 00:08:55.147]  Because there's a lot of other election subjects and other issues I want to, while Ventura's still in the U.S., talk to him about.
[00:08:55.147 --> 00:08:56.828]  Maybe he can give you a few tidbits, too.
[00:08:57.797 --> 00:08:59.738]  About Inside Info on 9-11.
[00:08:59.738 --> 00:09:04.080]  You know, he's been going around the country investigating 9-11.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.502]  Going to government buildings, going to facilities.
[00:09:07.502 --> 00:09:21.030]  And, um, he told the stories on camera, but with the agreement that we wouldn't release it, at least for a few months, until this pilot's done and aired on TruTV.
[00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.791]  And again, I know a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff on that.
[00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:25.432]  I'm not really at liberty to get into it, but
[00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:33.312]  We'll see how much he'll say on air about that.
[00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:40.014]  So, second hour we've got former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura popping in back with us.
[00:09:40.014 --> 00:09:48.816]  Then Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster on this Thursday edition, the 30th day of October 2008.
[00:09:48.816 --> 00:09:53.238]  And then John Bush, local activist.
[00:09:53.238 --> 00:09:54.518]  They are going to be protesting
[00:09:55.962 --> 00:10:15.713]  The fact that they're going to have police at checkpoints, pulling people out of their cars and threatening them that if you don't violate your Fourth Amendment and your Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, if you don't engage in this ritual of destroying America with us in the name of everyone's safety, then we're going to take your blood.
[00:10:15.713 --> 00:10:24.658]  We've had top lawyers, state officials on to cover this in the last six months or so since the Fed started it in San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, Houston.
[00:10:27.924 --> 00:10:34.126]  We've had them on the show, and they've gone over the evidence and the facts in the court cases, but these aren't real warrants.
[00:10:34.126 --> 00:10:45.409]  They just swear out these blanket warrants at checkpoints, and they're doing this in Indiana and Colorado, going back seven, eight years.
[00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:50.611]  First place we ever saw it was in Tucson and Phoenix, about, because it was in 2000.
[00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:52.551]  I would read the
[00:10:55.416 --> 00:11:00.178]  Tucson paper and the Phoenix paper on air back in 2000.
[00:11:00.178 --> 00:11:00.978]  Man, time flies.
[00:11:00.978 --> 00:11:02.639]  I think that was 99.
[00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.740]  And people wouldn't believe it.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.820]  You know, back then, oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.761]  That's shocking.
[00:11:07.761 --> 00:11:10.542]  Police at checkpoints taking blood.
[00:11:10.542 --> 00:11:14.083]  Now in Arizona, they just did it without warrants.
[00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:16.424]  And with flashlights in the dark taking your blood.
[00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:27.652]  Now, they tried this a month ago in Austin, and it was in local KXAN, covered it, the Associated Press covered it as well, you can Google it if you want.
[00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:35.520]  And they took them to the Austin hospitals and told them to take blood, and they said, uh... Well, some of the hospitals said no out of the gate, even though they had agreements with them.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.885]  The nurses and doctors on call said, that's unethical, and I'm not going to do that.
[00:11:39.885 --> 00:11:41.066]  They got a few of them to do it.
[00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:51.018]  But then the Austin hospitals, private ones, and even the city hospitals said, put out memos, I think a week ago, saying, we're not doing this.
[00:11:51.018 --> 00:11:52.619]  Don't bring them here.
[00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:59.706]  So see, now Austin's saying, okay, we'll hire our own nurses and have them in the mobile units and we'll do it.
[00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:06.393]  See, that's why Tucson and Phoenix and places in Indiana that I've seen in the news, that's why they've gotten to that point.
[00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:07.474]  Oh, and Illinois is the worst.
[00:12:08.732 --> 00:12:10.774]  Where the cops just take it without warrants.
[00:12:10.774 --> 00:12:12.415]  It's just like, hey, let's do it.
[00:12:12.415 --> 00:12:16.417]  They don't even tell the police that they're opening themselves up to lawsuits they can't even imagine.
[00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:19.540]  I mean, come on.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.241]  Real police work can stop drunks.
[00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.803]  You want to park outside a bar, but tell them don't do that.
[00:12:23.803 --> 00:12:24.983]  Don't run the business off.
[00:12:24.983 --> 00:12:29.366]  You want to park outside a bar and you want to see drunk people pulling out.
[00:12:29.366 --> 00:12:31.288]  I can take you down there and show it to you.
[00:12:31.288 --> 00:12:33.209]  You want to find people?
[00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:37.352]  One beer is driving under the influence and is illegal.
[00:12:38.647 --> 00:12:40.508]  They want to throw the book at you.
[00:12:40.508 --> 00:12:51.973]  Three beers for the average person in an hour and a half, in the average state, average weight, average individual, is driving while you're intoxicated.
[00:12:51.973 --> 00:12:53.513]  And it's so hypocritical.
[00:12:53.513 --> 00:12:58.015]  We need to get the sloshing drunks off the roads.
[00:12:58.015 --> 00:13:06.799]  But you go down here, and you, downtown Austin, and you, because that's where some of the good restaurants are, I'll go down there and eat maybe once a month or so,
[00:13:07.791 --> 00:13:12.273]  And there are drunks everywhere, stumbling around, falling down, getting in their cars.
[00:13:12.273 --> 00:13:18.115]  I mean, all you gotta do is put five or six cop cars down there and sit outside bars and watch the drunks come stumbling out.
[00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:19.396]  But no!
[00:13:19.396 --> 00:13:31.881]  No, we're gonna have federally funded checkpoints all over the country on every holiday where you get to pull through and have cops shine flashlights in your face.
[00:13:31.881 --> 00:13:32.841]  I, for one, am sick of it.
[00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:39.242]  I for one am tired of it.
[00:13:39.242 --> 00:13:41.524]  I'm already ranting.
[00:13:41.524 --> 00:13:57.433]  Josh Bush, local activist here in Austin, a member of the Steering Committee for Texans for Accountable Government, will be popping in in the fourth hour today to talk about this and some other issues.
[00:13:57.433 --> 00:14:06.418]  But I remember in 99-2000 going on air and reading articles out of the Denver Post, articles out of
[00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:12.714]  Different parts of the country, and listeners couldn't believe it.
[00:14:12.714 --> 00:14:16.216]  I had people emailing me saying, you're a liar.
[00:14:16.216 --> 00:14:19.938]  The police aren't taking blood at checkpoints.
[00:14:19.938 --> 00:14:22.119]  Oh yeah, they are.
[00:14:22.119 --> 00:14:24.340]  And your denial doesn't change that.
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.022]  Saying I'm a liar doesn't change it, okay?
[00:14:27.022 --> 00:14:28.683]  Of course, now you're not saying that.
[00:14:28.683 --> 00:14:32.405]  Now you're, oh yeah, uh-huh, sure, well, it's to keep us safe.
[00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:34.926]  Give me a break, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:34.926 --> 00:14:35.847]  Texans love to drink.
[00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:37.584]  Louisiana's love to drink.
[00:14:37.584 --> 00:14:41.605]  In fact, we drink the most per capita of any two states.
[00:14:41.605 --> 00:14:44.367]  You can go look at annual liquor sales.
[00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:48.889]  Austin now drinks more than New Orleans per capita.
[00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:50.669]  We're now number one in the country.
[00:14:50.669 --> 00:14:53.511]  Let me tell you who is really number one in North America.
[00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:56.652]  And that's Mexico, baby.
[00:14:56.652 --> 00:15:03.795]  And so I'm not knocking the, you know, I'm not being hypocritical here going, look at you, Mexicans south of the border, a bunch of drunks.
[00:15:03.795 --> 00:15:05.596]  I guess it takes drunks to know drunks.
[00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.751]  But let me tell ya!
[00:15:09.751 --> 00:15:18.473]  I mean, you go down to Mexico, until recently, now they're all paramilitary, sharp-eyed, you know, black-uniformed, but before it was the pot-bellied, drunk, corrupt cop.
[00:15:18.473 --> 00:15:20.714]  Believe me, I've seen plenty of them.
[00:15:20.714 --> 00:15:21.614]  Gone are those guys.
[00:15:21.614 --> 00:15:24.035]  At least in most areas.
[00:15:24.035 --> 00:15:26.936]  But, uh, you go down to Mexico, it is just drunkenness everywhere.
[00:15:29.284 --> 00:15:55.733]  and we got uh... probably forty million illegal aliens in this country and it's just on a friday night a saturday night anywhere in texas it's just drunk illegal aliens driving around like maniacs everywhere smashing into each other smashing and everybody the cops pull them over I've had Austin cops admit this to my face it's been in the news where cops do arrest the drunk illegal aliens and they're basically
[00:15:56.852 --> 00:16:00.054]  Given demerits for other reasons down the line, it's not encouraged.
[00:16:00.054 --> 00:16:01.435]  The judges tell them, what am I going to do?
[00:16:01.435 --> 00:16:03.056]  I don't even know this guy's name.
[00:16:03.056 --> 00:16:04.797]  ICE doesn't come and pick him up.
[00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.259]  $50 fine.
[00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:09.300]  A citizen's caught drunk.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:15.605]  You're talking $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 and your life is ruined.
[00:16:15.605 --> 00:16:18.647]  And my whole issue is, drunk drivers are dangerous, folks.
[00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:21.689]  You think I want some drunk killing me and my family?
[00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.250]  But I want real police work.
[00:16:24.472 --> 00:16:25.032]  Every time.
[00:16:25.032 --> 00:16:28.934]  I mean, I work a lot until 1, 2, 3, 4 in the morning.
[00:16:28.934 --> 00:16:32.616]  Every time I drive home, you always see the drunks.
[00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:33.656]  They drive real slow.
[00:16:33.656 --> 00:16:35.237]  Well, there's a couple different things they do.
[00:16:35.237 --> 00:16:39.099]  They drive real slow, but then are swerving down the highway.
[00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:42.340]  And I just gun it around them, get away from them as fast as I can.
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:47.463]  Or they're driving a little bit over the speed limit, or maybe 10 miles up the speed limit.
[00:16:47.463 --> 00:16:50.824]  And then you'll tell when they're concentrating, they'll be driving straight and all of a sudden, I'm over.
[00:16:50.824 --> 00:16:52.005]  I mean, we've all seen it.
[00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:58.576]  But you try driving home late at night here in Austin, Texas, there are drunks all over the road.
[00:16:58.576 --> 00:17:01.298]  I mean, I see drunks every night driving home.
[00:17:01.298 --> 00:17:02.939]  Where are the police?
[00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:03.960]  Where are you?
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:09.084]  Instead, you're gonna come stick bloodsuckers in my arm.
[00:17:09.084 --> 00:17:15.450]  And then you're gonna argue, well, uh, you know, we gotta get those drunks off the road and people know not to blow now.
[00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.654]  Well, you know, my liberty, my freedom, that precedent shouldn't be set where you can take things out of my body.
[00:17:22.256 --> 00:17:27.338]  Without due process.
[00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:40.982]  And so, what you do is you get them falling down drunk on the videotape, or you use the passive breathalyzers they've got now, and you just take them to jail.
[00:17:40.982 --> 00:17:42.622]  And then you show a jury that.
[00:17:42.622 --> 00:17:44.383]  That's what the process is like.
[00:17:44.383 --> 00:17:47.704]  Better a hundred guilty men go free than one innocent man go.
[00:17:50.948 --> 00:17:52.108]  And I mean, it's a system.
[00:17:52.108 --> 00:17:56.770]  They got liquor ads and liquor advertised everywhere and drugs are sold everywhere.
[00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:57.730]  Legal and illegal.
[00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.711]  And then the cops, you're supposedly out cleaning it up.
[00:18:00.711 --> 00:18:03.853]  Cleaning it up!
[00:18:03.853 --> 00:18:07.934]  The illegal drugs are shipped in by the criminal groups in the government, openly.
[00:18:07.934 --> 00:18:16.097]  The deadlier, even deadlier, pharmacological drugs are pushed on the kids by the systems, by the schools.
[00:18:18.778 --> 00:18:24.663]  And the alcohol is advertised everywhere, and in Hollywood, and in culture.
[00:18:24.663 --> 00:18:33.710]  I remember being 12 years old, you know, oh, I want to play baseball with my friends, and I'd be at a party with the 16 and 18 year olds, and there'd be beer bongs, everybody getting drunk.
[00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.771]  Another big part of it's parents.
[00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:40.115]  Do you really think your 12 year old, your 13 year old is really going to play baseball?
[00:18:40.115 --> 00:18:41.456]  You better keep an eye on them, they're not.
[00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:54.158]  And so the issue here is responsibility individually.
[00:18:54.158 --> 00:18:56.741]  You're not going to stop people from making stupid decisions.
[00:18:56.741 --> 00:19:00.164]  You're not going to stop bad parents from not controlling their children.
[00:19:00.164 --> 00:19:12.294]  And if you try to set the state up to do that, you're going to create a tyranny a hundred times worse than anything any individual or group can create.
[00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:12.935]  It's just that simple.
[00:19:16.992 --> 00:19:18.292]  So, what do I do?
[00:19:18.292 --> 00:19:28.634]  I don't take my children out late at night when all the drunks are out, and, um... I just know the police are great hypocrites, too.
[00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:33.215]  I talk to cops all the time who admit when they pull other cops over who are drunk.
[00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:35.775]  California, when they run their plates, they know it's a cop, and they just let them go.
[00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:36.996]  That's been in the news.
[00:19:36.996 --> 00:19:40.376]  I mean, cops are some of the hardest-drinking people out there.
[00:19:40.376 --> 00:19:43.577]  Statistically, they use more alcohol and rugs than any other group.
[00:19:43.577 --> 00:19:44.277]  Any other profession.
[00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:47.883]  But that's okay, isn't it?
[00:19:47.883 --> 00:19:51.931]  In fact, some bar in Austin sold two cops too much liquor.
[00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:56.981]  They went and killed themselves on a motorcycle, and they came and arrested the bartender.
[00:19:56.981 --> 00:19:58.284]  I mean, you got a lot of nerve.
[00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:11.562]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:20:11.562 --> 00:20:12.982]  Garden in a can.
[00:20:12.982 --> 00:20:17.123]  Garden in a can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[00:20:17.123 --> 00:20:19.143]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[00:20:19.143 --> 00:20:21.424]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[00:20:21.904 --> 00:20:31.587]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[00:20:31.587 --> 00:20:33.007]  Garden in a can.
[00:20:33.007 --> 00:20:34.208]  It's that simple.
[00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.588]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[00:20:36.588 --> 00:20:40.950]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.530]  Ready when you are.
[00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.031]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with
[00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:52.632]  That's GardenInACan.com or call 866-598-7396.
[00:20:52.632 --> 00:20:52.672]  866-598-7396.
[00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:01.812]  The economy is collapsing all around us.
[00:21:01.812 --> 00:21:02.673]  Banks are closing.
[00:21:02.673 --> 00:21:07.457]  The Federal Reserve continues to pump billions of dollars into the system to try to stop the bleeding.
[00:21:07.457 --> 00:21:09.038]  Know who is to blame.
[00:21:09.038 --> 00:21:11.100]  The Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.542]  On November 22nd, the end begins.
[00:21:13.542 --> 00:21:14.863]  Every Federal Reserve Bank.
[00:21:14.863 --> 00:21:16.584]  Every Federal Reserve Office.
[00:21:16.584 --> 00:21:17.244]  38 cities.
[00:21:17.244 --> 00:21:18.085]  One purpose.
[00:21:18.085 --> 00:21:18.706]  End the Fed.
[00:21:19.326 --> 00:21:23.428]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:21:23.428 --> 00:21:24.929]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:21:24.929 --> 00:21:28.050]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:21:42.476 --> 00:21:43.197]  It is liquid.
[00:21:43.197 --> 00:21:44.517]  It is private.
[00:21:44.517 --> 00:21:45.338]  It owes no one.
[00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:47.079]  It cannot go bankrupt.
[00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:49.080]  And it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.641]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:52.161]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.161 --> 00:21:53.562]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.191 --> 00:22:03.414]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:22:03.414 --> 00:22:06.897]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:06.897 --> 00:22:09.539]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:11.081]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:11.882]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:11.882 --> 00:22:12.742]  This is his MO.
[00:22:12.742 --> 00:22:14.244]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:22:14.244 --> 00:22:15.705]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:22:16.205 --> 00:22:23.388]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:22:23.388 --> 00:22:23.868]  Some U.S.
[00:22:23.868 --> 00:22:30.210]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.671]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:44.199]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:22:44.199 --> 00:22:45.420]  Fabled enemies.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:52.947]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:52.947 --> 00:22:56.570]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:22:59.998 --> 00:23:01.300]  I am so frustrated.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.643]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[00:23:03.643 --> 00:23:04.223]  What?
[00:23:04.223 --> 00:23:06.987]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[00:23:06.987 --> 00:23:08.409]  I read something and forget.
[00:23:08.409 --> 00:23:09.670]  I forget people's names.
[00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.475]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:15.217]  I... Okay, slow down.
[00:23:15.217 --> 00:23:17.500]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:24.904]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:26.525]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[00:23:26.525 --> 00:23:28.266]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[00:23:28.266 --> 00:23:29.446]  Even entire books!
[00:23:29.446 --> 00:23:29.726]  What?
[00:23:29.726 --> 00:23:30.287]  How?
[00:23:30.287 --> 00:23:33.548]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[00:23:33.548 --> 00:23:37.310]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:45.995]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[00:23:46.935 --> 00:23:52.320]  And, they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:52.841]  Wow.
[00:23:52.841 --> 00:23:53.882]  What's the website?
[00:23:53.882 --> 00:23:55.223]  Now, don't forget.
[00:23:55.223 --> 00:23:57.345]  It's pmemory.net.
[00:23:57.345 --> 00:24:03.671]  The letter P. Memory.net.
[00:24:03.671 --> 00:24:08.116]  Come, you masters of war.
[00:24:08.116 --> 00:24:10.038]  Here to build the big guns.
[00:24:16.744 --> 00:24:42.536]  They that build all the bombs They that hide behind walls They that hide behind desks I just want you to know I can see through your masks You that never done nothing But built to destroy
[00:24:45.906 --> 00:24:51.062]  Look at your little toy.
[00:24:57.223 --> 00:25:03.065]  Only five full days until the election.
[00:25:03.065 --> 00:25:10.968]  And in six days we'll know who the supposed winner is unless it goes to the Supreme Court.
[00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:18.210]  You notice since we got the electronic voting machines and all the corruption, suddenly we hear about martial law and military on the streets and
[00:25:20.134 --> 00:25:32.764]  Elections have to go to the Supreme Court, and elections officials go to prison for stealing elections in Ohio, but... I mean, we're living in a very corrupt society, and corruption has gotten to the highest levels of government.
[00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:38.929]  It's been operating with impunity for decades, and it's going to seed now.
[00:25:38.929 --> 00:25:40.630]  Here's some of the news I have today.
[00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:47.035]  Uses for the $700 billion bailout... ...are ever-shifting, AP.
[00:25:48.419 --> 00:26:01.787]  Goldman Sachs ready to hand out $14 billion in salary and bonus packages in their UK division only.
[00:26:01.787 --> 00:26:03.408]  Signs of recession.
[00:26:03.408 --> 00:26:04.229]  Growth shrinks.
[00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.629]  Consumers retreat.
[00:26:05.629 --> 00:26:06.850]  Signs of recession.
[00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.091]  They're still debating whether we're in a recession.
[00:26:09.091 --> 00:26:12.694]  We've been in one for two years.
[00:26:12.694 --> 00:26:15.996]  Economy shrank in third quarter as consumers retreat.
[00:26:15.996 --> 00:26:16.336]  Reuters
[00:26:17.139 --> 00:26:21.260]  Consumers feel the next crisis, it's the credit cards.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.761]  New York Times.
[00:26:22.761 --> 00:26:27.582]  The beginning of hyperinflation, the Epoch Times, we'll get into that.
[00:26:27.582 --> 00:26:34.964]  Moon Pickens says he sees oil by the summer of 2009, back up on $100 a barrel.
[00:26:34.964 --> 00:26:39.605]  That's what I've been saying.
[00:26:39.605 --> 00:26:41.886]  Syrians rally against U.S.
[00:26:41.886 --> 00:26:45.107]  aggression, mass demonstrations in Damascus and other
[00:26:46.383 --> 00:26:57.373]  Syrian cities against the raid that killed eight, right when they were about to sign a peace deal with Israel.
[00:26:57.373 --> 00:26:59.075]  Can't have that.
[00:26:59.075 --> 00:27:04.240]  Former Italian president says provocateur riots then beat the bleep out of protesters.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.282]  That's a quote mainstream news.
[00:27:06.282 --> 00:27:11.967]  The governments are so corrupt now they openly give TV and radio and print interviews saying, yeah, staged terror attacks.
[00:27:13.362 --> 00:27:20.244]  That's on PrisonPlanet.com, but we have links to the mainline news reports.
[00:27:20.244 --> 00:27:25.065]  87% chance Obama will become next president, says Gambling911.com.
[00:27:25.065 --> 00:27:30.267]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:27:30.267 --> 00:27:37.068]  Gordon Brown's terror claims for ID cards are bunkum, says GCHQExpert.
[00:27:37.068 --> 00:27:39.029]  They had a whole bunch of the police
[00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:54.937]  Commanders, uh, the, the, the spy grid controllers, the security experts in the government, come out and say, this is George Orwell, this is to control the population, this is an enslavement grid, and this is just the latest of a long line.
[00:27:54.937 --> 00:27:58.439]  People always say, well, if something this bad was happening, people in government would blow the whistle.
[00:27:58.439 --> 00:28:03.101]  You know, government's made up of good people and bad people, just like general society, and we learn about this.
[00:28:03.101 --> 00:28:03.501]  We do!
[00:28:03.501 --> 00:28:08.023]  We always do!
[00:28:08.023 --> 00:28:08.583]  Here it is again.
[00:28:10.077 --> 00:28:13.858]  Snow blankets London for global warming debate.
[00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:18.580]  Record cold worldwide right now, including the US.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.261]  No way to hide the truth, cell phones do cause tumors.
[00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:24.881]  Get into that report later.
[00:28:24.881 --> 00:28:31.063]  Defense Secretary demands funds for new nuclear weapons, offered veils threats of new testing.
[00:28:31.063 --> 00:28:33.304]  Seven obese children placed in foster care.
[00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:44.817]  That's just some of the news I have here, but here is the first big story on the economic front.
[00:28:44.817 --> 00:28:49.942]  Uses for $700 billion bailout money ever-shifting.
[00:28:49.942 --> 00:28:50.803]  This is the AP.
[00:28:50.803 --> 00:28:51.984]  Alex Jones didn't write this.
[00:28:51.984 --> 00:28:55.047]  Now, we told you before they passed it, under threat of martial law.
[00:28:55.047 --> 00:28:57.129]  That's right, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:28:59.326 --> 00:29:01.687]  Washington, John Dunbar, AP.
[00:29:01.687 --> 00:29:10.772]  First, the $700 billion rescue for the economy was about buying devalued mortgage package securities from tottering banks to unclog frozen credit markets.
[00:29:10.772 --> 00:29:14.673]  Then it was about using $250 billion of it to buy stakes in banks.
[00:29:14.673 --> 00:29:19.176]  The idea was that banks would use the money to start making loans again.
[00:29:19.176 --> 00:29:22.917]  But reports surfaced that banks might instead use the money to buy other banks.
[00:29:22.917 --> 00:29:23.878]  No!
[00:29:23.878 --> 00:29:25.079]  Pay dividends!
[00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:25.639]  Oh!
[00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:27.800]  Give employees a raise and executives bonuses.
[00:29:28.636 --> 00:29:30.477]  Or just sit on it.
[00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:32.938]  Insurance companies now want a piece.
[00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:34.419]  Automakers.
[00:29:34.419 --> 00:29:37.640]  Even Congress has approved $25 billion in low-interest loans for them.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:51.367]  We'll come back and tell you the rest of the story, because it's not $700 billion, it's $5 trillion conservatively, and you're going to pay every dime of it in tax money.
[00:29:51.367 --> 00:29:52.767]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:55.289]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.289 --> 00:29:57.990]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.355 --> 00:30:03.357]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:30:03.357 --> 00:30:10.304]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:30:10.304 --> 00:30:18.712]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:24.438]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:30:24.758 --> 00:30:25.138]  I don't know.

[00:30:47.506 --> 00:30:51.409]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:54.431]  Or order online, HBextract.com.
[00:30:54.431 --> 00:30:56.693]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.
[00:30:56.693 --> 00:31:01.096]  Or HBextract.com.
[00:31:01.096 --> 00:31:03.939]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:31:03.939 --> 00:31:05.520]  Loose change, final cut.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.681]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:31:07.681 --> 00:31:08.302]  The true story.
[00:31:19.102 --> 00:31:33.537]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to read?
[00:31:33.537 --> 00:31:34.658]  Of course not.
[00:31:34.658 --> 00:31:40.624]  But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards in circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:46.617]  I'm Walt Augustinowicz, founder of Identity Stronghold, and we think this is information you need to know.
[00:31:46.617 --> 00:31:51.821]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards, because they look physically just like the old card.
[00:31:51.821 --> 00:32:01.669]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with the card possible, right through your wallet, purse, or pants pocket without you ever removing the card.
[00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:04.572]  Pickpockets no longer even have to touch you to get your information.
[00:32:05.052 --> 00:32:10.597]  Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents, and that's why we manufacture the SecureSleeve.
[00:32:10.597 --> 00:32:17.324]  The SecureSleeve is a patent-pending card sleeve that contains a radio frequency barrier, preventing radio signals from reaching your card.
[00:32:17.324 --> 00:32:22.188]  You can get more information and purchase the SecureSleeve online at idstronghold.com.
[00:32:22.188 --> 00:32:25.411]  That's idstronghold.com, or call us at 800-610-2770.
[00:32:35.779 --> 00:32:57.699]  People ask why I have InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, TruthNews.us, JonesReport.com, MarshallLaw911.info, WhatIsTheEndGame.com.
[00:32:57.699 --> 00:33:01.022]  Well, it's the poor man's way of having redundancy instead of having
[00:33:02.674 --> 00:33:11.817]  Big, giant server farms and CDNs, back when we couldn't afford those.
[00:33:11.817 --> 00:33:13.658]  We went with each side having its own server.
[00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:17.459]  That way, separately, if things got attacked, they were spread out.
[00:33:17.459 --> 00:33:32.024]  For days like this, when InfoWars.com has now been down two and a half hours, but you can still visit PrisonThePlanet.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com,
[00:33:32.833 --> 00:33:37.776]  TruthNews.us and others.
[00:33:37.776 --> 00:33:40.938]  But that isn't the issue, InfoWars.com being down for a few hours.
[00:33:40.938 --> 00:33:47.683]  The issue is the attacks on the internet to shut it down, to restrict it, to curtail it.
[00:33:47.683 --> 00:33:52.306]  And it's now happening, it's now being openly announced.
[00:33:52.306 --> 00:33:54.207]  And finally the public is not in denial.
[00:33:54.207 --> 00:33:59.391]  Just six months ago people emailed me when we wrote stories at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com about
[00:34:00.985 --> 00:34:06.350]  MySpace being a Trojan horse for internet censorship was one headline that got picked up a few years ago all over the country.
[00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.193]  Reported on in, you know, major papers like the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:34:09.193 --> 00:34:12.496]  People said, oh it can't be true, oh no, they're not really planning that.
[00:34:12.496 --> 00:34:19.884]  You know, we had all the quotes and documents and now it's like, yeah they're trying it, yeah we gotta stop them.
[00:34:19.884 --> 00:34:21.025]  So that's the bigger issue.
[00:34:22.097 --> 00:34:48.259]  is that the alternative media is kicking the hind end of the new world order and their lies and fraud and propaganda and they're losing more and more credibility so they're moving to try to block it right now already at many libraries and universities worldwide not just in the US and government wireless systems that are quote free InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net but then even mainline kind of alternative sites like RawStory or Huffington Post
[00:34:49.165 --> 00:34:50.566]  Or right-wing blogs.
[00:34:50.566 --> 00:34:51.507]  They're blocked out.
[00:34:51.507 --> 00:34:53.949]  Anything alternative.
[00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:55.170]  It's already happening.
[00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.772]  We don't have a place in Internet 2.
[00:34:56.772 --> 00:35:02.557]  We don't have a future unless we stand up and expose this and speak out and boycott.
[00:35:02.557 --> 00:35:05.680]  Comcast already tried in Canada to restrict people down to a few thousand websites.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.443]  So did Time Warner and several Texas towns this year as a beta test.
[00:35:09.443 --> 00:35:11.725]  People protested and they backed off for now!
[00:35:14.338 --> 00:35:15.799]  But governments are coming in.
[00:35:15.799 --> 00:35:18.502]  In fact, let's play that now and then I'll get back into the economy.
[00:35:18.502 --> 00:35:29.752]  This is now, now, yesterday Paul Watson wrote a story for PrisonPlanet.com dealing with the fact that Australia has announced Chinese-style national compulsory censorship.
[00:35:29.752 --> 00:35:34.617]  And when you actually read the bill, you know, they mention sites about euthanasia and anorexia.
[00:35:34.617 --> 00:35:35.918]  They just pick two that are listed.
[00:35:35.918 --> 00:35:38.981]  It says anything the government deems offensive, radical,
[00:35:40.149 --> 00:35:46.997]  Anything that stirs up trouble, anything that is combative, anything that discredits the government.
[00:35:46.997 --> 00:35:51.262]  Tony Blair, before he left office last year, said we need to restrict the web.
[00:35:51.262 --> 00:35:52.443]  We wrote stories about that.
[00:35:52.443 --> 00:35:53.785]  I mean, this is really happening.
[00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:57.214]  So here's that news clip from Australian TV.
[00:35:57.214 --> 00:35:58.735]  Back it up and start it again.
[00:35:58.735 --> 00:35:59.916]  The denial needs to stop.
[00:35:59.916 --> 00:36:02.157]  The same hubs, the same grids, the same filters.
[00:36:16.289 --> 00:36:22.615]  And a lot of you are out there celebrating, good, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and GCNLive.com.
[00:36:22.615 --> 00:36:26.758]  They're not going to be available, good, we hate you anti-American scum!
[00:36:26.758 --> 00:36:30.101]  You don't know we're the only people here defending what's left of the country.
[00:36:30.101 --> 00:36:37.468]  Oh, I'm sorry, all your little neocon sites are going to be gone too, and FreeRepublic's on a lot of these lists.
[00:36:37.468 --> 00:36:43.153]  And I'm sorry, it's going to slow down the whole web, you understand?
[00:36:44.238 --> 00:36:48.922]  The web is very slow in China, very slow in other countries that have these filters, and that's in the news about Australia.
[00:36:48.922 --> 00:36:51.705]  It's going to slow the web down.
[00:36:51.705 --> 00:36:54.327]  Some analysts are saying by 50%.
[00:36:54.327 --> 00:36:56.649]  They want to kill the web with all these filters.
[00:36:57.416 --> 00:36:59.216]  Now stop the denial!
[00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:03.477]  Listen to National Australian TV!
[00:37:03.477 --> 00:37:04.297]  Listen!
[00:37:04.297 --> 00:37:05.298]  Here it is!
[00:37:05.298 --> 00:37:11.419]  First, making news this morning, the federal government will make internet censorship compulsory for all Australians.
[00:37:11.419 --> 00:37:22.161]  The Daily Telegraph says controversial websites on euthanasia and anorexia could be banned and that would put our level of net censorship alongside places like China, Cuba, Iran and North Korea.
[00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:26.464]  A poll on Sunrise this morning asked, should the government censor the internet?
[00:37:26.464 --> 00:37:30.667]  Now, 20% said yes, a whopping 80% said no.
[00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:32.328]  Dale Clapperton... Alright, stop again.
[00:37:32.328 --> 00:37:32.829]  Back it up.
[00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:33.609]  Now, now, hey!
[00:37:33.609 --> 00:37:37.092]  91% in every major Gallup poll say control our borders.
[00:37:37.092 --> 00:37:39.653]  Doesn't happen.
[00:37:39.653 --> 00:37:41.455]  75% or more say get us out of Iraq.
[00:37:41.455 --> 00:37:45.258]  Doesn't happen.
[00:37:45.258 --> 00:37:46.498]  97% don't want more toll roads.
[00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:49.381]  99% in the Houston Chronicle poll.
[00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:50.701]  Being handed over to foreign interest.
[00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:51.342]  They still do it.
[00:37:54.503 --> 00:37:57.625]  95% or higher in every poll.
[00:37:57.625 --> 00:37:58.766]  Go pull them up.
[00:37:58.766 --> 00:38:01.507]  We're against the banker takeover bill a month ago.
[00:38:01.507 --> 00:38:07.031]  Thousand to one phone calls to Congress.
[00:38:07.031 --> 00:38:09.292]  They still did it.
[00:38:09.292 --> 00:38:12.794]  That's a rogue government.
[00:38:12.794 --> 00:38:16.636]  In every major poll, people don't like Big Brother, they don't like the cameras, they don't like any of it.
[00:38:16.636 --> 00:38:17.797]  They still do it.
[00:38:17.797 --> 00:38:19.698]  Because we don't run jack squat
[00:38:20.518 --> 00:38:23.341]  And we're not going to turn it... People say, oh, that's negative.
[00:38:23.341 --> 00:38:32.830]  No, it's positive to address the real problems here and to face the facts and to make preparation for it and not live in denial.
[00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:40.998]  I just read to you out of the AP where they're taking trillions of dollars and giving it to themselves as bonuses and giving none of it to the people and we're paying the bill for it.
[00:38:40.998 --> 00:38:42.660]  They're not jump-starting the economy.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.941]  They're the ones killing it!
[00:38:46.371 --> 00:38:57.943]  Look, I know a lot of people out there haven't studied history, but if you had, you'd be horrified, because this happens 99% of the time, tyrannies come to the fore, and they take over and loot everything, and destroy the middle class.
[00:38:57.943 --> 00:38:59.485]  It's happening now!
[00:38:59.485 --> 00:39:07.693]  They've got us right where they want us, they've set all this up, and God help us, finish up with a clip.
[00:39:08.419 --> 00:39:12.620]  Now, 20% said yes, a whopping 80% said no.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.021]  Dale Claperton is from Electronic Frontiers Australia.
[00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:19.142]  Now that's a group dedicated to protecting online freedom.
[00:39:19.142 --> 00:39:20.323]  He joins us now from Brisbane.
[00:39:20.323 --> 00:39:22.343]  Good morning to you, Dale.
[00:39:22.343 --> 00:39:22.843]  Good morning.
[00:39:22.843 --> 00:39:23.344]  Good morning.
[00:39:23.344 --> 00:39:29.966]  Obviously, you don't think we need compulsory internet censorship for all Australians?
[00:39:29.966 --> 00:39:33.807]  No, we've had the internet in Australia for about 30 years now.
[00:39:33.807 --> 00:39:37.408]  At various stages along the way, people have raised dooms...
[00:39:38.244 --> 00:40:03.431]  scenarios about what was going to happen if the internet was not censored most recently back in 1999 when the Howard government attempted legislation along these lines but what we've really seen now is people who have grown up with the internet understand it understand its dangers people who had grew up with the internet as children now have children of their own and they're quite capable of making informed decisions about it.
[00:40:03.431 --> 00:40:04.191]  Dale do you have children?
[00:40:05.963 --> 00:40:06.444]  No, I don't.
[00:40:06.444 --> 00:40:11.769]  Yeah, I'm just wondering, do you think we need any kind of internet censorship at all?
[00:40:11.769 --> 00:40:13.711]  Stop right there, stop right there.
[00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:19.257]  The power to put a gate on it, and the gates are already there, is the power to destroy it.
[00:40:19.257 --> 00:40:25.964]  Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, let me explain this, you can go pull this up.
[00:40:28.915 --> 00:40:35.157]  They built the Chinese control grid that censors out 90 plus percent of alternative sites.
[00:40:35.157 --> 00:40:37.997]  I mean, it's very effective.
[00:40:37.997 --> 00:40:43.119]  They built the systems used in Cuba and Iran.
[00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:47.240]  They built the systems used in North Korea.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.580]  They built the systems.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.261]  They went in.
[00:40:51.261 --> 00:40:54.381]  They have designed the national ID card for China.
[00:40:54.381 --> 00:40:54.721]  IBM.
[00:40:58.192 --> 00:41:07.017]  Google, China, Google, in all these controlled countries, they run it, they do it for the government.
[00:41:07.017 --> 00:41:10.039]  All they gotta do is flip a switch here.
[00:41:10.039 --> 00:41:21.965]  We've already seen Google and YouTube, you know, we'll be getting a million views a day on, say, Terror Storm, or Endgame, and they just would knock us back to zero, but nobody else, and knock us out of the top 100.
[00:41:21.965 --> 00:41:26.948]  The first day Fabled Enemies came out, it was number one on Google, it was number one the second day,
[00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:29.031]  And they just erased it.
[00:41:29.031 --> 00:41:33.916]  They just knocked it completely out of the top 100.
[00:41:33.916 --> 00:41:50.133]  Now, about 8 months ago, before they would have public view counts on Google Video, because they got caught over and over again censoring it to keep you off the front page where you could reach people that weren't in the choir, they would go in there and just knock you off, but it was obvious.
[00:41:50.987 --> 00:41:53.890]  The only way you can see your numbers now on Google Video is if you upload it.
[00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:57.974]  So we uploaded Fabled Enemy so we could internally see what the views were.
[00:41:57.974 --> 00:41:59.836]  Millions.
[00:41:59.836 --> 00:42:01.998]  Nowhere on the front page.
[00:42:01.998 --> 00:42:02.919]  Censored.
[00:42:02.919 --> 00:42:04.360]  Cheated.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.883]  Because again, people use the Google Video page like a TV guide.
[00:42:07.883 --> 00:42:09.705]  They go in and see what's popular.
[00:42:09.705 --> 00:42:11.467]  And whatever gets in there tends to stay in there.
[00:42:12.236 --> 00:42:16.821]  You think they want Terror Storm, or Endgame, or Fabled Enemies to be as big as loose change?
[00:42:16.821 --> 00:42:18.843]  You think they want hundreds of millions seeing it?
[00:42:18.843 --> 00:42:20.204]  NO THEY DON'T!
[00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:23.027]  So they're in there right now doing it!
[00:42:23.027 --> 00:42:35.960]  And then three months ago, Senator Lieberman sends an open letter to Google and YouTube, owned by Google, and says,
[00:42:36.684 --> 00:42:38.685]  We want to give you a list every day of what we want banned.
[00:42:38.685 --> 00:42:44.969]  Anything anti-American, anything quote against the troops, anything that shows the terrorist, that means anybody criticizing them, we want it banned.
[00:42:44.969 --> 00:42:45.449]  And you know what?
[00:42:45.449 --> 00:42:48.291]  They've done that now.
[00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:52.674]  And if it shows troops or contractors shooting kids, it's taken down.
[00:42:52.674 --> 00:42:55.856]  It can even be on the nightly news, they take it down.
[00:42:55.856 --> 00:43:00.018]  Footage of them killing a puppy, they take it down.
[00:43:00.018 --> 00:43:04.981]  Footage of troops beating up small children, taken down.
[00:43:04.981 --> 00:43:06.202]  But they leave up the video
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.681]  Of the beheadings and things.
[00:43:10.681 --> 00:43:14.202]  You see, it's all ready here, and they're eating around the edges.
[00:43:14.202 --> 00:43:16.162]  They're eating holes in it.
[00:43:16.162 --> 00:43:17.363]  Picture it as the Bill of Rights.
[00:43:17.363 --> 00:43:18.063]  Laying there on a table.
[00:43:18.063 --> 00:43:21.964]  It's got silverfish all over it.
[00:43:21.964 --> 00:43:25.425]  Government silverfish and industry silverfish eating holes.
[00:43:25.425 --> 00:43:26.886]  Where you can hardly even read the text.
[00:43:26.886 --> 00:43:30.407]  There's just moth-eaten holes all over it.
[00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:35.108]  And they're just scurrying all over the face of it.
[00:43:35.108 --> 00:43:36.449]  You know what?
[00:43:36.449 --> 00:43:37.249]  Keep playing the clip.
[00:43:39.486 --> 00:43:46.850]  Internet censorship for parents that want it is already available in the form of software that can be installed on their computers.
[00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:54.995]  It's a useful tool that parents can use to control and monitor their children's online access in conjunction with appropriate supervision.
[00:43:54.995 --> 00:43:56.456]  This software is already available...
[00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:02.796]  ...will free of charge from the Commonwealth Government and has been for quite some time.
[00:44:02.796 --> 00:44:07.361]  We don't see that there's a case for forcing it on everybody at an ISP level.
[00:44:07.361 --> 00:44:16.253]  Dal, my understanding of that is that the people around the world spend their days and nights working out clever ways of getting around that, so kids can get around those pretty simply.
[00:44:18.099 --> 00:44:22.081]  There are ample ways to get around these types of censorship systems.
[00:44:22.081 --> 00:44:24.883]  And for that matter, children enjoy pushing boundaries.
[00:44:24.883 --> 00:44:27.004]  It's something that they're good at.
[00:44:27.004 --> 00:44:37.829]  And when children have got the degree of technical sophistication that they do these days, it will be fairly trivial to get around any kind of censorship system that the government tries to enforce.
[00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:43.312]  The only alternative would be making the system so restricted that it would really be unusable.
[00:44:43.312 --> 00:44:45.733]  Okay, so why do you think the government is pushing for this, Dale?
[00:44:47.717 --> 00:44:48.618]  Several reasons.
[00:44:48.618 --> 00:44:55.181]  First and foremost, they went to the election last year promising that they were going to do this, and now they're determined to follow through.
[00:44:55.181 --> 00:45:09.288]  There's also the issue that the government needs the support of the Green Senators and Senator Fielding and Xenophon, who's an independent and from family first, to get any controversial legislation through the Senate.
[00:45:09.868 --> 00:45:22.007]  Senator Fielding from Family First has already said that, for example, he wants access to certain adult material, which would be most pornographic websites on the internet, blocked for all Australians.
[00:45:24.597 --> 00:45:25.998]  And that's what they did.
[00:45:25.998 --> 00:45:39.830]  When the liquor-running cartels wanted to quadruple, or even more, the price of liquor, they went and lobbied, and this is mainline history, paid local Christian groups across the United States to go out and lobby for prohibition.
[00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.452]  Alcoholism then more than tripled.
[00:45:42.452 --> 00:45:44.393]  Alcohol poisoning went up five-fold.
[00:45:44.393 --> 00:45:50.639]  It corrupted the police, created federal police forces, and you know the rest of the story.
[00:45:50.639 --> 00:45:53.281]  Just like they use, quote, moral do-gooders
[00:45:54.224 --> 00:45:55.845]  To ban narcotics!
[00:45:55.845 --> 00:46:02.229]  Soon as they lost prohibition in the 30's, they then went and banned cocaine and heroin and things like that.
[00:46:02.229 --> 00:46:11.635]  Which before, were available at all your major stores and a lot less people, what is it, about 25% of what currently use it, used it per capita then.
[00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:15.617]  But it energized the black market and destroyed our country.
[00:46:15.617 --> 00:46:19.079]  They've done it in China a hundred years before, I mean, they know what they're doing.
[00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:22.601]  So they brought China down by shipping opium in the British government.
[00:46:22.601 --> 00:46:23.302]  While it was illegal.
[00:46:23.979 --> 00:46:28.740]  That got control of the police, the corrupt mafia, you know, the corrupt triads.
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.200]  And so they know what they're doing here, and so they've got these do-gooders.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.461]  Oh, there's all this porn on the web, it's horrible!
[00:46:34.461 --> 00:46:38.002]  You're not gonna stop people going to that.
[00:46:38.002 --> 00:46:42.383]  Now, remember, going back about 15 years ago, the big push by Al Gore?
[00:46:42.383 --> 00:46:48.904]  We gotta put Internet in all the schools, but then Internet censorship had to come, and government approved filters.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.641]  You know, why don't you go to private industry?
[00:46:51.641 --> 00:46:55.283]  Why don't the schools buy the internet filters they want from the hundreds of companies?
[00:46:55.283 --> 00:46:56.424]  No.
[00:46:56.424 --> 00:46:58.985]  The Feds put out a filtration system.
[00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:02.007]  And then, what came out?
[00:47:02.007 --> 00:47:02.908]  In the name of stopping
[00:47:03.695 --> 00:47:32.370]  plagiarism starting in the sixth grade in the name of looking for violent tendencies the children all do their papers now in English class on word processors and that goes to central databases and to government files and what your children write is kept and analyzed and used they even have them write under federal grants journals on mommy and daddy and they told mommy and daddy oh this is just a database to see if your child's plagiarizing or if there's any violent talk no
[00:47:33.616 --> 00:47:37.702]  It's under, in one of them nationwide, a B.A.T.F.
[00:47:37.702 --> 00:47:40.445]  For the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives now.
[00:47:40.445 --> 00:47:44.370]  They've changed their name.
[00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:45.392]  You see what's happening here?
[00:47:47.967 --> 00:47:49.528]  And the government's been caught in the U.S.
[00:47:49.528 --> 00:47:51.169]  every time they try to pass internet censorship.
[00:47:51.169 --> 00:47:53.530]  They go around posting horrible porn on mainline sites.
[00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.532]  They've been caught with hackers.
[00:47:55.532 --> 00:48:07.639]  Another way they plan to attack the web is staged hack attacks, false flags, shutting down whole systems of banking and industry, and claiming how CIA did it.
[00:48:07.639 --> 00:48:16.464]  You see, they don't like the fact that PrisonPlanet.com or the Huffington Post or any other alternative site of the thousands of varieties and flavors out there
[00:48:17.648 --> 00:48:26.730]  Could go to the Senate Banking website and get the blacked out bailout plan that was most of, over 90% blacked out.
[00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:28.711]  And then that bubbled up through the alternative press.
[00:48:28.711 --> 00:48:30.911]  The mainstream media wouldn't cover that it was all secret.
[00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:39.353]  And people asked Perino, the White House Press Secretary last week, well, why is it secret who's been given the money?
[00:48:39.353 --> 00:48:42.454]  And she said, well, it's secret and we should just trust our Treasury Secretary.
[00:48:43.337 --> 00:48:53.024]  And so see now, that's a mainstream issue, but it never would have been if the alternative media wasn't so big.
[00:48:53.024 --> 00:48:54.725]  It's huge.
[00:48:54.725 --> 00:48:57.467]  It's giant.
[00:48:57.467 --> 00:49:01.350]  Thousands and thousands of huge websites rivaling major newspapers.
[00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.492]  Newspapers going under, shutting down.
[00:49:03.492 --> 00:49:08.095]  Not just their print versions, but their mainline Internet's in trouble.
[00:49:08.095 --> 00:49:10.497]  Because people don't want your bull anymore.
[00:49:14.019 --> 00:49:15.900]  And so they've got to shut us down.
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.140]  They've got to restrict us.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.841]  That's why people say, well, why do you even care about AM and FM?
[00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:21.382]  AM and FM is precious.
[00:49:21.382 --> 00:49:23.463]  But now they're bringing back the Fairness Doctrine.
[00:49:23.463 --> 00:49:30.185]  For the FCC to try to shut down any liberal, conservative, libertarian, anyone who, quote, states their political view.
[00:49:30.185 --> 00:49:31.086]  Oh, you can't do that!
[00:49:31.086 --> 00:49:35.907]  And they're admitting that that's coming.
[00:49:35.907 --> 00:49:40.369]  So they're attacking the AM and FM.
[00:49:40.369 --> 00:49:41.249]  They're attacking the Internet.
[00:49:41.249 --> 00:49:42.570]  They're attacking the satellite providers.
[00:49:43.826 --> 00:49:48.831]  Through monopolies, they keep us off XM and Sirius.
[00:49:48.831 --> 00:49:52.315]  Clear Channel owns the majority of those two companies that merged this year.
[00:49:52.315 --> 00:49:56.599]  They officially merged last year, but... Well, they stated they merged last year.
[00:49:56.599 --> 00:49:58.741]  They officially finished that up a few months ago.
[00:49:58.741 --> 00:50:01.604]  But the point is, is that all of this is going on.
[00:50:01.604 --> 00:50:06.509]  We're fighting to get the word out, and we are kicking the mainline media's butt.
[00:50:06.509 --> 00:50:07.610]  People want reality!
[00:50:08.465 --> 00:50:11.266]  So please value this radio show.
[00:50:11.266 --> 00:50:17.109]  Please value PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:20.190]  Please support us.
[00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:30.855]  Because that's how we're able to tell you, by reading the Banker Bill a month ago, wasn't the mainline media that told you that it gave them dictatorial powers, or that martial law is being set up.
[00:50:32.577 --> 00:50:33.317]  You invest.
[00:50:33.317 --> 00:50:34.358]  You buy insurance.
[00:50:34.358 --> 00:50:35.599]  You wear your seatbelt.
[00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:38.461]  You do things to ensure your family's future and protection.
[00:50:38.461 --> 00:50:39.301]  But why?
[00:50:39.301 --> 00:50:40.542]  Just in case?
[00:50:40.542 --> 00:50:43.644]  With the current state of affairs, ask yourself, am I ready?
[00:50:43.644 --> 00:50:46.585]  Preparation starts at SurvivalGearSource.com.

[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.540]  That's survivalgearsource.com.

[00:51:30.032 --> 00:51:32.576]  Prepare for tomorrow now.
[00:51:32.576 --> 00:51:35.800]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.264]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:39.264 --> 00:51:41.908]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:41.908 --> 00:51:43.470]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:44.271]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:45.132]  This is his ammo.
[00:51:45.132 --> 00:51:46.654]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:46.654 --> 00:51:48.236]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:48.596 --> 00:51:55.760]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.240]  Some U.S.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:02.583]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:02.583 --> 00:52:06.105]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:06.105 --> 00:52:16.370]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.311]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:52:17.791 --> 00:52:28.947]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[00:52:32.475 --> 00:52:36.437]  Drinking a chlorophyll-rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.
[00:52:36.437 --> 00:52:44.840]  AlkaVision GreenShield Green Drink is a specifically formulated nutritional supplement, which provides many nutritional elements that are missing from our modern diet.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:49.082]  GreenShield helps neutralize acid in your body and maintains a healthy pH balance.
[00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:55.104]  And having the proper pH balance has been known to balance blood sugar levels, something we can all benefit from.
[00:52:55.104 --> 00:52:58.566]  GreenShield combines the perfect blend of powerful whole food vegetables,
[00:52:58.906 --> 00:53:06.531]  Immune-boosting herbs and grasses, Green Shield does not contain algae, mushrooms or fungi, has no preservatives, artificial colors or flavors.

[00:53:59.349 --> 00:54:11.538]  The mainstream media, a month ago, when they passed that banker takeover bill, simultaneously passing banker takeover bills in Europe and England, what did they do?
[00:54:11.538 --> 00:54:22.746]  In unison on all the TV news shows and in the newspapers, they even sent Federal Reserve bankers out all over the country to speak to the business groups locally.
[00:54:22.746 --> 00:54:24.827]  They said, this is to get the economy back going.
[00:54:24.827 --> 00:54:25.628]  Things are going to crash.
[00:54:25.628 --> 00:54:28.130]  We're going to have a depression if we don't, this week,
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.881]  Buy these mortgages.
[00:54:31.881 --> 00:54:36.262]  Well, we just went and got the Senate bill, and by the way, for days they wouldn't post it.
[00:54:36.262 --> 00:54:45.605]  We finally got it, and it had those lines in there about no one can review this, no one can investigate it, no branch of government can even look at it, no one can question.
[00:54:45.605 --> 00:54:49.367]  It can be in the tens of trillions of dollars.
[00:54:49.367 --> 00:54:53.548]  Bloomberg properly reported five trillion, Ron Paul reported five trillion.
[00:54:53.548 --> 00:54:54.508]  That's the conservative.
[00:54:54.508 --> 00:54:56.629]  A lot of estimates are ten trill.
[00:54:58.963 --> 00:55:00.624]  All to them.
[00:55:00.624 --> 00:55:02.065]  And we told you.
[00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:04.067]  We told you what they would do.
[00:55:04.067 --> 00:55:05.428]  They are looting everything.
[00:55:05.428 --> 00:55:08.229]  This is tax money just being given to them.
[00:55:08.229 --> 00:55:11.592]  And what are they doing?
[00:55:11.592 --> 00:55:22.499]  In the, because of international laws, they're all quote national branches, the national branch of Goldman Sachs alone in England.
[00:55:23.875 --> 00:55:31.540]  Is being given a 7 billion pound, that's 14 billion dollar, bonuses package.
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.381]  That's UK Daily Mail.
[00:55:34.381 --> 00:55:42.826]  Can you imagine the executives are going to be given 14 billion dollars?
[00:55:42.826 --> 00:55:46.048]  And that's just in the British bailout.
[00:55:46.048 --> 00:55:49.250]  That's what, over 400 billion now.
[00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.711]  That's pounds, by the way.
[00:55:54.076 --> 00:55:57.097]  800 billion dollars being sucked up by criminals.
[00:55:57.097 --> 00:56:00.079]  This is bank robbery right in front of you.
[00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:04.001]  And who guards these banks in New York, in D.C., in London?
[00:56:04.001 --> 00:56:12.265]  Riot cops in black masks with machine guns thinking they're guarding everybody from Al-Qaeda when the guys that run Al-Qaeda are inside those banks.
[00:56:14.887 --> 00:56:15.807]  Literally.
[00:56:15.807 --> 00:56:19.769]  Carlyle Group and the Bin Laden family and the Queen of England owning Carlyle Group.
[00:56:19.769 --> 00:56:23.350]  These are degenerate, evil pieces of trash.
[00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:29.393]  They're like villains out of a James Bond movie.
[00:56:29.393 --> 00:56:32.134]  But in the real world, James Bond works for the villains.
[00:56:32.134 --> 00:56:39.116]  He works for Chaos, or Dr. Doom, or whatever the name is this week, or Dr. No, or Goldfinger.
[00:56:39.116 --> 00:56:40.117]  Here's AP.
[00:56:40.117 --> 00:56:43.358]  Uses for $700 billion bailout money ever-shifting.
[00:56:44.611 --> 00:56:50.214]  First, the $700 billion rescue for the economy was about buying devalued mortgage-backed securities.
[00:56:50.214 --> 00:56:52.276]  Oh, by the way, go ahead and call Ventura.
[00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:55.538]  Go ahead and call him now, John.
[00:56:55.538 --> 00:56:56.458]  Trey gave you his number, right?
[00:56:56.458 --> 00:56:58.560]  Go ahead and call him now.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.841]  I want to start him right away.
[00:57:00.841 --> 00:57:10.987]  First, the $700 billion rescue for the economy was about buying devalued mortgage-backed securities from tottering banks to unclog frozen credit markets.
[00:57:10.987 --> 00:57:12.488]  I told you, you'd never get any of it!
[00:57:13.248 --> 00:57:14.828]  All you're gonna get is a SWAT team raid, folks.
[00:57:14.828 --> 00:57:15.809]  That's all you get.
[00:57:15.809 --> 00:57:19.470]  And some fluoride in your water, and some mercury in your kid's shots.
[00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:22.031]  And some fluoride in your milk and your cereal.
[00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:26.492]  Then it was about using the $250 billion of it to buy stakes in banks.
[00:57:26.492 --> 00:57:29.693]  The idea that the banks would use the money to start making loans.
[00:57:29.693 --> 00:57:31.093]  That's where the money's gone.
[00:57:31.093 --> 00:57:34.594]  But reports surface that banks might instead use money to buy other banks.
[00:57:34.594 --> 00:57:35.755]  That's what they've done.
[00:57:35.755 --> 00:57:37.155]  I told you, they consolidate.
[00:57:37.155 --> 00:57:40.696]  Pay dividends, give employees a raise and executives a bonus, or just sit on it.
[00:57:41.585 --> 00:57:43.688]  Insurance companies now are getting a piece.
[00:57:43.688 --> 00:57:49.076]  Many automakers, even though Congress has approved $25 billion in low interest rate loans for them.
[00:57:49.076 --> 00:57:58.469]  Three weeks after becoming law, and with the first dollar of the $700 billion yet to go out, officials are beginning to talk about helping a few scrapped homeowners keep the foreclosure wolf from the door.
[00:57:59.554 --> 00:58:02.816]  As the crisis worsens, the government reaction keeps changing.
[00:58:02.816 --> 00:58:09.620]  Lawmakers in both parties are starting to gripe that the bailout is turning to be far different from what the Bush administration sold Congress.
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:14.103]  Well, of course!
[00:58:14.103 --> 00:58:16.705]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:16.705 --> 00:58:18.966]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:22.919 --> 00:58:28.622]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:58:28.622 --> 00:58:29.963]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:29.963 --> 00:58:31.944]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:58:31.944 --> 00:58:38.307]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:58:38.985 --> 00:58:47.868]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:58:47.868 --> 00:58:54.971]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:58:54.971 --> 00:58:58.032]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:58:58.032 --> 00:59:03.934]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:03.934 --> 00:59:06.495]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:59:06.995 --> 00:59:12.921]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[00:59:15.964 --> 00:59:25.113]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:25.113 --> 00:59:27.496]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:27.496 --> 00:59:30.259]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:36.807 --> 00:59:38.128]  Big Brother.
[00:59:38.128 --> 00:59:39.889]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:39.889 --> 00:59:41.650]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:43.231]  You want answers?
[00:59:43.231 --> 00:59:44.132]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:44.132 --> 00:59:48.975]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:48.975 --> 00:59:53.038]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.277 --> 01:00:18.670]  Has come in from the radio interview we did Monday with Governor Jesse Ventura and former Senator Dean Barclay who he appointed for a month after the tragic death of Paul Wellstone.
[01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:21.452]  Now we're not going to panhandle too much here today.
[01:00:21.452 --> 01:00:30.139]  Governor Ventura just told me through Dean that he wanted to thank everybody because he said that's why he got out of politics is he can't stand raising money but the other two shysters raised
[01:00:31.121 --> 01:00:32.242]  Over 30 million.
[01:00:32.242 --> 01:00:33.942]  Dean only raised $50,000 previously.
[01:00:33.942 --> 01:00:38.565]  Now he's raised almost that much, and he's got the TV ads on today, and he has a chance of winning.
[01:00:38.565 --> 01:00:41.406]  So we're going to talk about that in 30 minutes when Dean comes on.
[01:00:41.406 --> 01:00:49.170]  We're going to talk about a host of other issues about the election and 9-11 with Governor Ventura while we have him for the first 30 minutes before Dean Barkley.
[01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:51.331]  SenatorBarkley.com is the website.
[01:00:51.331 --> 01:00:55.673]  He joins us, but first off, Governor, great audience, huh?
[01:00:56.683 --> 01:00:58.145]  Oh, Gal, I gotta tell you.
[01:00:58.145 --> 01:01:01.208]  You know, Alex, you got loyal people out there.
[01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:09.436]  You got patriotic people that saw the opportunity and rather than sitting on their hands, they had an opportunity to do something about it.
[01:01:09.436 --> 01:01:09.896]  They did.
[01:01:09.896 --> 01:01:11.097]  I can't thank them enough.
[01:01:11.938 --> 01:01:15.300]  It's going to make that race up there extremely competitive.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.663]  It's going to go to the wire and Dean Barclay has a shot at doing it.
[01:01:18.663 --> 01:01:24.266]  If it can happen, it would be just as big as what I did in 98.
[01:01:24.266 --> 01:01:27.248]  That's what we've got to have happen.
[01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:29.890]  You can't overthrow something in a big heave.
[01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:32.112]  You've got to chip away at it.
[01:01:32.112 --> 01:01:34.073]  You've got to go at the foundation of it.
[01:01:34.073 --> 01:01:35.354]  The one thing I've learned is
[01:01:35.914 --> 01:01:41.835]  The only way to truly change the system in many ways, you have to become part of the system to change it.
[01:01:41.835 --> 01:01:47.457]  And that's what we've got to do at all local, statewide, as well as federal elections.
[01:01:47.457 --> 01:01:48.697]  Absolutely, Governor.
[01:01:48.697 --> 01:01:52.338]  Well, we've got Dean coming up in about 30 minutes to join us.
[01:01:52.338 --> 01:01:55.818]  But first off, I wanted to read you part of an AP headline.
[01:01:55.818 --> 01:01:58.679]  Uses for the $700 billion bailout money ever shifting.
[01:01:59.563 --> 01:02:07.306]  And they go on to say, first, the $700 billion rescue for the economy was about buying devalued mortgage-backed securities from tottering banks to unclog frozen credit markets.
[01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:11.088]  Then it was about using $250 billion of it to buy stakes in banks.
[01:02:11.088 --> 01:02:15.970]  Then the idea, which they've done now, was that the banks would use the money to start making loans again.
[01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:28.395]  But then it goes into reports that the banks admit they're just keeping it and giving it as bonuses, including Goldman Sachs, $14 billion in bonuses of that money directly given to their executives right now.
[01:02:29.238 --> 01:02:35.183]  Well, you know, Alex, that's undescribable.
[01:02:35.183 --> 01:02:37.465]  I mean, how do we throw these people in jail?
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.762]  I guess that's what it's going to have to get down to.
[01:02:41.762 --> 01:02:47.767]  Something, somebody's going to have to come forward and start putting people in prison for things like this.
[01:02:47.767 --> 01:02:51.789]  I mean, to me, that's unbelievable, but I suppose they covered their butts.
[01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:57.594]  They probably gave it to them with no strings attached, so there's no legal recourse, I'm not sure.
[01:02:57.594 --> 01:03:00.176]  You know, I wasn't there to give that to them.
[01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:05.860]  I'm on the sidelines, just like all of us, reading about it and reaching back and watching my wallet get... Well, you're right!
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.360]  You're right, Governor.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.322]  Yeah, losing huge money in your 401k, I would imagine, and any stocks you've got.
[01:03:11.322 --> 01:03:12.122]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:16.204]  The bill said no one can review it, it's all secret, no one can look at it.
[01:03:16.204 --> 01:03:19.605]  White House Press Secretary last Friday said it's secret, you can't look at it.
[01:03:19.605 --> 01:03:22.226]  But then the banks openly announced that they're giving it as bonuses.
[01:03:23.278 --> 01:03:26.903]  Um, well, that's the problem with our government today, Alex.
[01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:28.044]  It's so secretive.
[01:03:28.044 --> 01:03:38.917]  You know, we're supposed to be the land, home of the brave, land of the free, but yet we have a government that, especially this Bush administration, which is the most secretive that there's ever been.
[01:03:38.917 --> 01:03:41.560]  I mean, this makes Nixon look like a piker.
[01:03:43.317 --> 01:03:44.237]  Man, it sure does.
[01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:45.978]  Well, you know what?
[01:03:45.978 --> 01:03:50.639]  You know that just because they can get Congress to say they can commit crimes that... That's what Nixon said.
[01:03:50.639 --> 01:03:53.279]  Well, when the President commits a crime, it's not a crime.
[01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:59.681]  This is a crime on its face, and they can claim that they've all been given pardons by Congress, but that doesn't float.
[01:03:59.681 --> 01:04:04.742]  We need citizen grand juries, Ron Paul has said, to go ahead and start investigations and indictments.
[01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:20.167]  I agree fully, and I think it fits right into what Dr. Paul talked about with his book using the term revolution, and I think it fits right into my book where the term revolution is likewise in the title, you know?
[01:04:20.167 --> 01:04:26.229]  I'm coming to the distinct possibility without any thoughts about it, Alex.
[01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:27.810]  We need a revolution.
[01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:30.331]  Stay there, Governor, back in three minutes on VCN.
[01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:39.436]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:04:39.436 --> 01:04:42.078]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.639]  But who is the enemy?
[01:04:43.639 --> 01:04:44.420]  Bin Laden.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.381]  This is his MO.
[01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.822]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:04:46.822 --> 01:04:48.404]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:55.926]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:56.406]  Some U.S.
[01:04:56.406 --> 01:05:02.768]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:05:02.768 --> 01:05:06.249]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:05:06.249 --> 01:05:16.532]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:05:16.532 --> 01:05:17.472]  Fabled Enemies.
[01:05:17.972 --> 01:05:25.745]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:05:25.745 --> 01:05:29.110]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[01:05:32.899 --> 01:05:34.579]  Senator Barkley, I presume.
[01:05:34.579 --> 01:05:37.020]  Governor Ventura, what are you doing down here?
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.181]  Looking for a way out for me and all these taxpayers.
[01:05:40.181 --> 01:05:41.801]  Are we where I think we are?
[01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:44.842]  Yes, it appears we're at the bottom of a very deep hole.
[01:05:44.842 --> 01:05:46.062]  Did we do something wrong?
[01:05:46.062 --> 01:05:46.662]  Not us.
[01:05:46.662 --> 01:05:51.543]  It seems some schemers on Wall Street dug this hole, and we're down here to get them out of it.
[01:05:51.543 --> 01:05:55.644]  I don't see too many investment bankers or insurance company executives down here.
[01:05:55.644 --> 01:05:57.304]  I don't see Al Franken here either.
[01:05:57.304 --> 01:06:00.465]  Senator, I said we're down here with taxpayers.
[01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:03.386]  I don't see Norm Coleman down here either.
[01:06:03.386 --> 01:06:08.209]  Well, since Norm Coleman became Senator, the federal deficit went up three trillion dollars.
[01:06:08.209 --> 01:06:11.370]  Governor, you and I know the first rule of getting out of a hole.
[01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:12.971]  Stop digging!
[01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:16.052]  During my administration, we ran budget surpluses.
[01:06:16.052 --> 01:06:18.093]  And we gave money back to taxpayers.
[01:06:18.093 --> 01:06:20.454]  That's the kind of thinking we need in Washington.
[01:06:20.454 --> 01:06:25.457]  Please go to SenatorBarclay.com to make a contribution and help take back our country.
[01:06:25.917 --> 01:06:28.898]  I'm Senator Dean Barkley and I approved this message.
[01:06:28.898 --> 01:06:30.479]  And so do I!
[01:06:30.479 --> 01:06:32.319]  Paid for by Barkley for Senate.
[01:06:32.319 --> 01:06:37.221]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:06:37.221 --> 01:06:44.664]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[01:06:44.664 --> 01:06:46.304]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:06:46.304 --> 01:06:50.426]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[01:06:50.426 --> 01:06:53.947]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[01:06:54.247 --> 01:06:58.752]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:06:58.752 --> 01:07:03.096]  Phase one is a one world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[01:07:03.096 --> 01:07:07.220]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:11.464]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[01:07:11.844 --> 01:07:17.630]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com to learn how to prepare for the unthinkable.
[01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:19.192]  Don't wait for empty shelves.

[01:07:25.038 --> 01:07:25.278]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:38.590]  Big Brother.
[01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:40.351]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:40.351 --> 01:07:41.531]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:41.531 --> 01:07:43.672]  You want answers?
[01:07:43.672 --> 01:07:44.592]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:44.592 --> 01:07:49.433]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:49.433 --> 01:07:57.896]  And now... Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:05.011 --> 01:08:10.740]  Well, it's been great to have a governor of Ventura be such a big part of the show the last few weeks.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.023]  His third visit with us in just the last few weeks.
[01:08:14.989 --> 01:08:20.191]  But he's off shooting a bunch of TV pilots and about to go back to Mexico, but we'll really enjoy it when he gets back.
[01:08:20.191 --> 01:08:41.281]  During the break, the governor was just absolutely, you know, I mean, he's aware of it in the press, but those headlines even shocked him more that we were reading about the bankers getting hundreds of billions of dollars and then saying it's secret who they're giving it to, but then they themselves are admitting, and I just read some of the headlines here, that they're giving billions of it to themselves.
[01:08:41.781 --> 01:08:52.688]  per institution as bonuses for their executives and then the White House and the Treasury Department have released the documents but they're 90% blacked out.
[01:08:52.688 --> 01:08:52.968]  Governor?
[01:08:54.313 --> 01:08:56.635]  Well, Alex, I haven't seen this, you know.
[01:08:56.635 --> 01:09:05.319]  If this is all true, and I have no reason to believe it's not true, I'm speechless over that.
[01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:06.820]  I mean, this is public money.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:09.202]  This is the public domain.
[01:09:09.202 --> 01:09:13.364]  When I was governor of the state of Minnesota, we did nothing under the table.
[01:09:13.364 --> 01:09:14.825]  There wasn't anything going on.
[01:09:15.505 --> 01:09:17.847]  You know that the public didn't have a right to know about it.
[01:09:17.847 --> 01:09:29.878]  In fact, when I left office, we turned every document of my entire four years over to the Minnesota Archives, where anyone can go there and read anything, including bad emails, if they want to read about them.
[01:09:29.878 --> 01:09:33.541]  But I mean, this is not what our government is supposed to be.
[01:09:33.541 --> 01:09:36.224]  If this is all true, you know what?
[01:09:36.224 --> 01:09:40.548]  I'm to the point now, I'm urging everyone to vote against every incumbent.
[01:09:41.108 --> 01:09:43.009]  Vote them all out of office.
[01:09:43.009 --> 01:09:52.274]  It's the only way we can survive this, is to vote all incumbents out of office, to turn the whole thing over until something of that magnitude happens.
[01:09:52.274 --> 01:09:56.317]  We're going to continue to have this going on.
[01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:57.037]  Well, you're right.
[01:09:57.037 --> 01:10:02.720]  And then, let me just bring up a speed on this, because the mainstream media has not been covering it.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.122]  This is from the past bill, section 8.
[01:10:06.677 --> 01:10:11.401]  Um, of the portion of 1937, the bill.
[01:10:11.401 --> 01:10:22.511]  Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion and may not be reviewed by any court or law or any administrative agency.
[01:10:24.767 --> 01:10:27.089]  That's what it says right in the bill?
[01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:27.509]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:27.509 --> 01:10:29.070]  That's section 8.
[01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:32.173]  And this was first reported by the Huffington Post.
[01:10:32.173 --> 01:10:33.914]  Dirty secrets of the bailout.
[01:10:33.914 --> 01:10:35.675]  32 words that none dare utter.
[01:10:35.675 --> 01:10:39.178]  But then it was picked up by mainstream media after that.
[01:10:39.178 --> 01:10:40.539]  Wow.
[01:10:40.539 --> 01:10:46.744]  You know, like I said, the only way we can do it is to take back our government at the ballot box.
[01:10:46.744 --> 01:10:50.787]  You've got to vote all the incumbents out of office, is my opinion.
[01:10:50.787 --> 01:10:52.548]  That's the way it needs to be done.
[01:10:55.382 --> 01:10:56.823]  Well, I mean, this is what happens over and over.
[01:10:56.823 --> 01:11:12.332]  Whether you like the guys or not, Alex, whether you think they're good guys or not, if they're on board for this type of behavior of government, then we need a complete flushing of the toilet, to put it into blunt terms.
[01:11:12.332 --> 01:11:15.634]  Well, that's definitely what it is.
[01:11:15.634 --> 01:11:16.875]  I mean, that's definitely what's in there.
[01:11:17.811 --> 01:11:18.791]  Wow.
[01:11:18.791 --> 01:11:25.093]  Yeah, you know, well, thank goodness we got you out there reading it over the radio, because I haven't had time to look at that stuff.
[01:11:25.093 --> 01:11:29.214]  I'm so involved in all the things that I'm doing, and I'm caught off guard with it, Alex.
[01:11:29.214 --> 01:11:40.797]  Like I said, if that's what's in there, and that's how the operation of our federal government's operating today, then we most definitely better have a revolution and take our government back.
[01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:41.617]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:52.203]  This happens in history over and over again where governments just go completely deceit and the last official act of any dictatorship is to loot the treasury.
[01:11:52.203 --> 01:11:54.504]  This is what happens in third world countries.
[01:11:54.504 --> 01:11:56.445]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:56.445 --> 01:12:02.308]  And well, let's remember, third world countries don't have a middle class, do they?
[01:12:02.308 --> 01:12:03.368]  No.
[01:12:03.368 --> 01:12:06.489]  And what are they trying to destroy in the United States today?
[01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:07.630]  The middle class.
[01:12:09.002 --> 01:12:20.113]  So what you have happening here is they're trying to turn us into a third world country where there will be only the wealthy and there will be only the poor.
[01:12:20.113 --> 01:12:27.080]  Well, I'm here googling these terms because I want to find the video of Perino, her secretary, saying, yeah, it's all secret.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.982]  You're not allowed to see it.
[01:12:28.982 --> 01:12:29.522]  And you can...
[01:12:30.666 --> 01:12:42.889]  For listeners out there, you can just Google banking bailout documents blacked out, and then you can see on the Senate website where they posted them, and it'll say the top title, and then it's all blacked out.
[01:12:42.889 --> 01:12:47.890]  What's the purpose of even posting it if it's blacked out, Alex?
[01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:50.691]  To just show us that it's blacked out?
[01:12:50.691 --> 01:12:50.911]  Yes.
[01:12:53.843 --> 01:13:02.251]  Well, I just read the Associated Press where they haven't doled out one bit of this to any banks that are actually in trouble or to any mortgages.
[01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:08.056]  And the banker heads are on the news saying, we're just going to sit on the money and just keep it.
[01:13:08.056 --> 01:13:13.782]  And the minutes of Paulson's meetings he has every week with the banking heads and brokerage heads, those are secret.
[01:13:15.033 --> 01:13:25.259]  Well, you know, like I said, if that's the case and that's how secretive... To me, this somehow has to be against the law.
[01:13:25.259 --> 01:13:31.982]  Unless, of course, like you said, they specifically stated in the bill that no one could object or interject or anything.
[01:13:31.982 --> 01:13:35.744]  But you can't take public dollars and be secretive with them.
[01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:38.206]  That's a basic concept that I learned as a mayor.
[01:13:39.046 --> 01:13:45.308]  You know, when you're down at the mayoral level of government, the local government, you have to have everything has to be wide open.
[01:13:45.308 --> 01:13:46.588]  It has to be above board.
[01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:52.710]  It has to be there for any citizen to be able to come and ask questions about it and receive answers about it.
[01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:54.590]  After all, Alex, it's our money.
[01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:55.930]  Yes.
[01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:58.071]  People keep forgetting that.
[01:13:58.071 --> 01:14:02.512]  And people also keep forgetting that we are the government.
[01:14:02.512 --> 01:14:05.153]  The government isn't supposed to be this separate entity.
[01:14:05.153 --> 01:14:06.133]  It's supposed to be us.
[01:14:07.941 --> 01:14:11.702]  Well, I think it's the over-the-top nature.
[01:14:11.702 --> 01:14:13.543]  I mean, who would imagine that in the U.S.
[01:14:13.543 --> 01:14:21.365]  of A., you would have corrupt bankers running everything, looting really over a trillion dollars directly into their own pockets as bonuses.
[01:14:21.365 --> 01:14:32.169]  I mean, who could imagine that they would terrorize the public and say, we're going to have a depression, we have to have this bill this week to prop up these mortgages, and then now they say we're not spending it on the mortgages.
[01:14:33.163 --> 01:14:37.727]  Yeah, well, see, to me, who is ultimately to blame for it?
[01:14:37.727 --> 01:14:39.708]  Your elected officials.
[01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:46.794]  Because if the elected officials pass the bill that allows this to happen, they are ultimately responsible for it.
[01:14:46.794 --> 01:14:50.637]  Well, they were threatened with martial law on the House floor if they didn't pass it.
[01:14:50.637 --> 01:14:51.898]  Were you aware of that?
[01:14:51.898 --> 01:14:53.299]  No, I was not aware of that.
[01:14:53.299 --> 01:14:54.740]  See, I'm always shocking Ventura.
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:55.581]  I bet he doesn't believe me.
[01:14:55.581 --> 01:14:58.523]  John, there's two congressmen.
[01:15:00.757 --> 01:15:05.079]  Yeah, pull the Brad Sherman clip first, and then I actually have Brad Sherman on the show.
[01:15:05.079 --> 01:15:06.799]  Play Brad Sherman for the Governor.
[01:15:06.799 --> 01:15:07.219]  Do you have that?
[01:15:07.219 --> 01:15:10.760]  He's pulling it out of the computer.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.902]  Governor, you can't... See, I can't believe this either, and so I don't blame you for having trouble believing it.
[01:15:15.902 --> 01:15:20.844]  They were threatened with physical martial law if they didn't pass it.
[01:15:20.844 --> 01:15:26.986]  Well, you know, they had a chance to prepare for it, because I saw that at the Republican convention in St.
[01:15:26.986 --> 01:15:29.607]  Paul, because I got a first-hand visual of what
[01:15:30.682 --> 01:15:32.804]  What did you witness?
[01:15:32.804 --> 01:15:33.484]  What did you witness?
[01:15:59.171 --> 01:15:59.531]  You know, they
[01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:29.631]  They also charged peaceful demonstrators under the State Terrorism Act.
[01:16:30.539 --> 01:16:37.502]  Well, and you could only walk on designated streets that they allowed for anyone that wanted to protest.
[01:16:37.502 --> 01:16:56.588]  And what they did is they designated them off the side streets so that it wouldn't be in the front of the building, so therefore the news media didn't have to photograph any type of protest going on because they were all shuttered over to the side of the building on these other streets, and you watch the protesting, it's hilarious.
[01:16:56.588 --> 01:16:58.489]  It's like they're walking down streets
[01:16:59.249 --> 01:16:59.829]  I don't know.
[01:16:59.829 --> 01:17:00.290]  I don't know.
[01:17:23.687 --> 01:17:27.831]  But again, they use 9-11 as the pretext to sell us, this is all for your safety.
[01:17:27.831 --> 01:17:38.402]  Exactly, well that overrides the First Amendment is that, well, public safety comes first and the argument they give you back is on free speech.
[01:17:38.402 --> 01:17:42.407]  You're not allowed to go into a crowded movie theater and yell, fire!
[01:17:43.007 --> 01:17:48.950]  That's not free speech, and that puts people in danger who will then panic.
[01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.271]  That's their standard argument, and they're using that.
[01:17:52.271 --> 01:18:01.435]  It's quite a jump to me, but they're using that as the argument as to why they cannot, because of safety, they can delegate where you can or can't go.
[01:18:01.435 --> 01:18:03.616]  Well, the greater danger is this tyrannical government.
[01:18:03.616 --> 01:18:04.936]  Let me play the clip.
[01:18:04.936 --> 01:18:06.877]  This is the Congressman.
[01:18:06.877 --> 01:18:08.638]  Here it is.
[01:18:08.638 --> 01:18:09.438]  City from Ohio.
[01:18:10.231 --> 01:18:16.594]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[01:18:16.594 --> 01:18:19.895]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:39.703]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[01:18:40.914 --> 01:18:43.375]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[01:18:43.375 --> 01:18:44.736]  Unjustified.
[01:18:44.736 --> 01:18:46.097]  Proven wrong.
[01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:49.859]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks, to write a good bill.
[01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:55.122]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[01:18:55.122 --> 01:19:06.709]  And that was the day they passed it, and I interviewed him and another congressman, they were threatened with physical martial law, then they get it, and three and a half weeks later, they're hoarding all the money, giving it to no one but themselves, Governor.
[01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:14.479]  Well, you know, Alex, you know, I'm learning of this right now.
[01:19:14.479 --> 01:19:19.381]  I'm as dumbfounded and shocked as anybody who would hear that, you know.
[01:19:19.381 --> 01:19:22.302]  The only thing I wish, I wish they'd name the names.
[01:19:22.302 --> 01:19:27.885]  Who exactly are the people who were threatened with martial law and who were the people who threatened them?
[01:19:27.885 --> 01:19:29.345]  That's what we gotta get to.
[01:19:29.345 --> 01:19:30.006]  Well, I had them on.
[01:19:30.006 --> 01:19:31.146]  Not just the statements.
[01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:32.987]  Let's get to the gist of the thing.
[01:19:32.987 --> 01:19:35.668]  Alright, we'll tell you who said it when we get back.
[01:19:37.322 --> 01:19:40.763]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:19:40.763 --> 01:19:45.005]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:19:45.005 --> 01:19:56.669]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:19:56.669 --> 01:20:02.511]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:20:02.551 --> 01:20:03.051]  I think so.
[01:20:23.271 --> 01:20:25.192]  The economy is collapsing all around us.
[01:20:25.192 --> 01:20:25.812]  Banks are closing.
[01:20:25.812 --> 01:20:31.715]  The Federal Reserve continues to pump billions of dollars into the system to try to stop the bleeding.
[01:20:31.715 --> 01:20:32.215]  Know who is to blame?
[01:20:32.215 --> 01:20:33.336]  The Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:33.336 --> 01:20:34.516]  On November 22nd, the end begins.
[01:20:34.516 --> 01:20:35.156]  Every Federal Reserve Bank
[01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:54.445]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:20:54.445 --> 01:20:56.285]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:58.666]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:21:19.392 --> 01:21:20.353]  It is liquid.
[01:21:20.353 --> 01:21:21.434]  It is private.
[01:21:21.434 --> 01:21:22.235]  It owes no one.
[01:21:22.235 --> 01:21:23.977]  It cannot go bankrupt.
[01:21:23.977 --> 01:21:26.000]  And it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.223]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:21:28.223 --> 01:21:28.443]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:28.443 --> 01:21:28.843]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:50.139]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:53.961]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:21:54.241 --> 01:21:54.741]  We're good to go.
[01:22:17.969 --> 01:22:18.190]  I'm good.
[01:22:36.829 --> 01:22:38.590]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:40.810]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:42.571]  I can't find my wallet!
[01:22:42.571 --> 01:22:43.431]  Sound familiar?
[01:22:43.431 --> 01:22:46.872]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
[01:22:46.872 --> 01:22:52.234]  Introducing our patented Find One Find All Key Finders, or FOFA XD for short.
[01:22:52.234 --> 01:22:58.416]  Once a FOFA key finder is attached to each of those easy-to-lose things, it can find and be found by all the rest.
[01:22:58.416 --> 01:23:04.718]  Use your wallet to find your keys, your keys to find the remote control, or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[01:23:04.858 --> 01:23:06.438]  The possibilities are endless.
[01:23:06.438 --> 01:23:12.760]  Fufa goes through walls, cushions, and laundry baskets up to 30 feet and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.600]  Got the remote!
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.241]  Oh, my keys!
[01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.601]  There's my wallet!
[01:23:17.601 --> 01:23:25.083]  Order your Fufa today with batteries included along with a 30-day money-back guarantee by calling Find One Find All at 866-245-8670.
[01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:25.263]  That's 866-245-8670.
[01:23:33.405 --> 01:23:45.608]  Here's the Minneapolis Post.
[01:23:45.608 --> 01:23:51.250]  I just googled, bankers bailout docs blacked out.
[01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:52.150]  Here are the headlines.
[01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:54.991]  Why are docs from the bailout being redacted?
[01:23:54.991 --> 01:23:56.871]  Another headline out of another newspaper.
[01:23:56.871 --> 01:23:57.771]  Bailout scandal.
[01:23:57.771 --> 01:23:59.732]  Undisclosed sums paid to New York Mellon Bank.
[01:24:00.618 --> 01:24:03.360]  Why is the government keeping key documents about the bailout secret?
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.122]  Alternet!
[01:24:07.122 --> 01:24:09.023]  How's this for bailout transparency?
[01:24:09.023 --> 01:24:11.785]  Boing, boing!
[01:24:11.785 --> 01:24:17.048]  Minnesota Post, why are key details of documents from the bailout secret?
[01:24:17.048 --> 01:24:20.410]  And I just clicked on that article there.
[01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:23.111]  This should be a much bigger scandal and a much bigger deal.
[01:24:23.111 --> 01:24:27.414]  And to answer the governor's question, we had both the congressmen on
[01:24:28.556 --> 01:24:34.643]  Republican and Democrat were told about the Marshall Law and under House rules they can be suspended.
[01:24:34.643 --> 01:24:40.810]  These were in committee meetings and they were told this is being told in secret and they're not allowed to say who said it.
[01:24:40.810 --> 01:24:44.174]  So again, Governor Ventura, as you kept saying when you were down here for a couple days with us,
[01:24:46.969 --> 01:24:59.046]  Wherever you have secrecies, where you have the corruption, the cover-up of 9-11, the cover-up of Kennedy, I mean, that's the big evidence of the cover-up, and now with the Banker Bill, they're making it secret, but what leaks out is they're just gobbling the money up for themselves.
[01:24:59.046 --> 01:24:59.627]  Can you speak to that?
[01:25:00.541 --> 01:25:11.246]  Well, again, you know, I'm simply hearing what you're telling me, Alex, and to me this is, you know, people should be going to jail over this, if this is true.
[01:25:11.246 --> 01:25:19.430]  Because again, all public money in the public domain should be out in the open, and whatever bills that are passed and what it's spent on,
[01:25:20.050 --> 01:25:34.262]  It should be clearly labeled with a complete paper trail so that anyone can audit it, anyone can go through it, and be able to obtain and understand where the public money goes.
[01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:37.424]  This is corruption beyond belief.
[01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:42.628]  If our people are voting for this, then clearly they need to be put out of office.
[01:25:42.628 --> 01:25:45.691]  Again, I say you've got to vote against all incumbents.
[01:25:46.434 --> 01:25:49.296]  Well, it's the same issue with the Congressman being threatened with martial law.
[01:25:49.296 --> 01:25:52.699]  The House rules, they were ordered to maintain secrecy.
[01:25:52.699 --> 01:25:56.542]  Again, it's that secrecy issue breeding tyranny.
[01:25:56.542 --> 01:26:00.465]  Can you get into the brick walls you've been running into with your Trump TV pilot?
[01:26:00.465 --> 01:26:06.750]  Well, you know, we're out trying to do a TV show, and basically what it's about is it's, you know, showing
[01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:17.936]  Both sides of a conspiracy, and the problem we're running into is getting no cooperation from the government whatsoever in any way, shape, or form.
[01:26:17.936 --> 01:26:26.721]  And that's about all I can go into for now, except to state that, you know, when people act guilty, then they wonder why other people think they're guilty.
[01:26:26.721 --> 01:26:34.566]  And if you behave in a certain manner that leads to suspicion and not openness, well, then that's what breeds
[01:26:35.146 --> 01:26:35.847]  And this hurts every American.
[01:26:35.847 --> 01:26:36.927]  The Banker Takeover, 9-11, all of it.
[01:26:36.927 --> 01:26:38.388]  We are all being basically screwed by this.
[01:27:02.257 --> 01:27:13.143]  Well, we all certainly are when they take and do a bailout to these proportions, and then they're even saying that this may not even be big enough.
[01:27:13.143 --> 01:27:19.527]  And when there's no accountability of where the money goes, that's insane.
[01:27:19.527 --> 01:27:21.148]  That's utterly insane.
[01:27:21.148 --> 01:27:24.310]  You wouldn't operate that way in your own private household.
[01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:29.592]  So why on earth would we find it acceptable to operate that way as our government?
[01:27:29.592 --> 01:27:41.096]  I mean, unless you're a fool, you're not going to give huge sums of money to, say, Uncle Ben without him telling you what he's going to use it for and being totally transparent about it.
[01:27:41.096 --> 01:27:43.797]  Why do you think, Governor Ventura, that they're so arrogant now?
[01:27:43.797 --> 01:27:49.699]  I mean, we've never seen corruption like this.
[01:27:49.699 --> 01:27:51.540]  Well, why are they so blatant?
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.901]  Because they've been able to be blatant ever since 9-11.
[01:27:56.096 --> 01:28:07.905]  I mean, they were so blatant with not answering questions, not forming an investigative committee, until two years later it was stonewalled.
[01:28:07.905 --> 01:28:11.687]  I've never figured that one out, having been the leader of a state.
[01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:25.098]  And in fact, when the bridge fell in the water here in Minnesota, I don't know if they're getting an accurate report, but they actually commissioned three separate reports to happen, so that all three could be compared to each other to determine, you know,
[01:28:25.658 --> 01:28:28.462]  From three different entities, what happened with the bridge?
[01:28:28.462 --> 01:28:30.305]  Have they received the final results?
[01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:31.246]  No, not yet.
[01:28:31.246 --> 01:28:41.620]  I don't know if they'll be honest or dishonest, but I can't understand how an elected official or the head of a state, the head of a country, or the head of anything
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:49.586]  Instead, they actively covered it up and demoted or fired FBI agents that blew the whistle, but those that actively helped cover up got record cash bonuses and promotions.
[01:29:05.218 --> 01:29:08.740]  Well, you know, I can't, I don't know any of that.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:12.863]  Well, the head of NORAD, General Myers, was promoted to chairman and joined Jesus Staff.
[01:29:12.863 --> 01:29:13.763]  Well, there you go.
[01:29:13.763 --> 01:29:17.705]  Stay there, Governor.
[01:29:17.705 --> 01:29:21.388]  You know, Alex, you know what they call that in Hollywood lingo?
[01:29:21.388 --> 01:29:22.548]  What?
[01:29:22.548 --> 01:29:27.391]  Out in Hollywood, that's called failing your way to the top.
[01:29:27.391 --> 01:29:31.313]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:31.313 --> 01:29:34.015]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:38.829 --> 01:29:53.709]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up, and she was reminded of
[01:29:53.729 --> 01:29:54.049]  We're good to go!
[01:30:09.906 --> 01:30:11.587]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now.
[01:30:11.587 --> 01:30:15.531]  We're headed into much higher prices on food, and there is a global food shortage.
[01:30:15.531 --> 01:30:16.692]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[01:30:16.692 --> 01:30:17.692]  Do what I did.
[01:30:17.692 --> 01:30:19.254]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[01:30:19.254 --> 01:30:22.056]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[01:30:22.056 --> 01:30:23.918]  Get some food and put it away, and be safe.
[01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:25.499]  Put a little security in your life.
[01:30:25.499 --> 01:30:26.660]  You deserve security.
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:27.681]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:30:27.681 --> 01:30:28.201]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:30:28.201 --> 01:30:28.401]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:30:28.401 --> 01:30:29.102]  Put some food away.
[01:30:29.102 --> 01:30:29.582]  Do it now.
[01:30:29.582 --> 01:30:29.642]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:30:37.122 --> 01:30:43.886]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:43.886 --> 01:30:46.527]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:46.527 --> 01:30:48.068]  But who is the enemy?
[01:30:48.068 --> 01:30:48.889]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:48.889 --> 01:30:49.749]  This is his MO.
[01:30:49.749 --> 01:30:51.250]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:52.491]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:30:53.231 --> 01:31:00.376]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:00.376 --> 01:31:00.856]  Some U.S.
[01:31:00.856 --> 01:31:07.220]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:10.662]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:10.902 --> 01:31:21.192]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:21.192 --> 01:31:22.433]  Fabled enemies.

[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:33.584]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:42.312]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[01:31:42.312 --> 01:31:47.795]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[01:31:47.795 --> 01:31:50.076]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[01:31:50.076 --> 01:31:52.777]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[01:31:52.777 --> 01:31:55.778]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[01:31:55.778 --> 01:31:57.719]  Know how to reach campus security.
[01:31:57.719 --> 01:32:01.261]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[01:32:01.261 --> 01:32:03.562]  And always carry a self-defense device.
[01:32:04.062 --> 01:32:07.625]  This important message is brought to you by Pepperspray.com.

[01:32:45.992 --> 01:32:48.913]  Alright, the Governor is going to leave us in the next ten minutes or so.
[01:32:48.913 --> 01:32:54.914]  We're going to have Senator Dean Barkley riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:32:54.914 --> 01:32:58.574]  Then, one of our financial experts, Bob Chapman, joins us in the next hour.
[01:32:58.574 --> 01:33:11.737]  We'll talk a little bit in the fourth hour about police all over the country, under federal funding, warrantlessly taking blood at checkpoints of those that refuse to violate their Fifth Amendment rights and blowing the breathalyzer.
[01:33:11.737 --> 01:33:13.397]  We'll also take calls in that hour.
[01:33:14.469 --> 01:33:18.975]  In the next two hours, with all those guests that are coming up.
[01:33:18.975 --> 01:33:25.704]  Governor Ventura, in closing before we talk about Dean Barclay and go to him, I think we're having better radio behind the scenes.
[01:33:25.704 --> 01:33:28.908]  You're pretty riled up about the secret banker takeover here.
[01:33:29.549 --> 01:33:37.136]  Well, you know, like I said, Alex, I get focused on the job that I'm doing and I sometimes don't pay attention to everything going on.
[01:33:37.136 --> 01:33:38.957]  Many, like regular Americans, do.
[01:33:38.957 --> 01:33:44.983]  You've got your life to lead and you don't have every waking moment to peer at the government.
[01:33:44.983 --> 01:33:47.084]  You have to have some type of trust with them.
[01:33:48.005 --> 01:33:56.889]  If these things, as I've heard on your show today and on The Main Den, what they're reporting is true, then to me the government is completely violating their trust with us.
[01:33:56.889 --> 01:34:06.634]  And when we get to the point where we have to sit and watch every move they make, and every move they make is done in secret so it doesn't matter if you watch anyway,
[01:34:07.254 --> 01:34:14.897]  Well, my only thing that I can tell all you great listeners out there, and they indeed are that, is that vote against all incumbents.
[01:34:14.897 --> 01:34:19.118]  It's time to clean house and get these people out of office and take our government back.
[01:34:19.118 --> 01:34:24.460]  And I know it's a shameful segue, but we got an opportunity in Minnesota to do it.
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:29.782]  And again, I want to thank all the listeners out there for giving us the opportunity for Dean Barkley, because
[01:34:30.522 --> 01:34:36.785]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was 10 points behind with a week to go when I ran for Governor of Minnesota.
[01:34:36.785 --> 01:34:39.906]  And I won, and it can happen again.
[01:34:39.906 --> 01:34:49.570]  And thanks to all the great listeners on Alex's show, the opportunities there, and Dean can seize it, and hopefully next Tuesday we'll see an independent Senator elected.
[01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:54.593]  We're gonna go to Dean in one moment, but I want to finish up on the statement of rogue government.
[01:34:54.593 --> 01:34:55.033]  We know
[01:34:56.192 --> 01:34:56.632]  I don't know.
[01:34:56.632 --> 01:34:57.193]  It's beyond me, Alex.
[01:34:57.193 --> 01:35:00.334]  I gotta follow it, keep track of it, stay vigilant and see what happens out of this thing.
[01:35:00.334 --> 01:35:00.714]  I warn people
[01:35:24.805 --> 01:35:40.178]  I said, you know, all this talk of change out of the Democrats, I said it's a bunch of malarkey, because I said we've had Democrats, Democrats and Republicans have been in charge since my life began, and there's no major change involved.
[01:35:40.178 --> 01:35:44.741]  Anybody that believes big changes are going to happen is fooling themselves.
[01:35:44.741 --> 01:35:51.527]  The only way you're going to get true change is to start electing independent people that are not part of these two political gangs.
[01:35:51.767 --> 01:35:55.870]  Well, Governor, I actually disagree with you on a slight point, a caveat here, an addendum.
[01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:56.671]  We're going to get change.
[01:35:56.671 --> 01:36:02.035]  It's going to get far worse, because the agenda... Well, you know what?
[01:36:02.035 --> 01:36:03.976]  Okay, you can nitpick me on that one.
[01:36:03.976 --> 01:36:07.959]  If it does get worse, I'll give it that, but it could get worse.
[01:36:07.959 --> 01:36:13.203]  But certainly the change won't be in what they're saying for the better.
[01:36:13.203 --> 01:36:14.584]  I'll go to my grave on that.
[01:36:14.584 --> 01:36:17.166]  You're not going to see change for the better, in my opinion.
[01:36:17.868 --> 01:36:27.977]  Well, we're not starting the revolution without you, Governor, and being involved here, supporting Dean Barkley, who got you into politics and was your campaign manager that brought you to the governorship.
[01:36:27.977 --> 01:36:32.922]  I mean, this is all really exciting, and I appreciate you reaching out to our audience, and I appreciate the audience.
[01:36:32.922 --> 01:36:36.845]  I mean, if everybody just gave five bucks, which I guess they did, $47,000 or whatever has come in,
[01:36:39.068 --> 01:36:40.629]  The TV ads are now going on today.
[01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:43.012]  You can see it up at SenatorBarclay.com.
[01:36:43.012 --> 01:36:49.059]  I just want to restate the facts because there's more to it, Governor, and then we're going to let you introduce Dean and let you go here.
[01:36:49.059 --> 01:36:56.828]  But to be specific, you were 10 points behind going into the weekend, but you still won because 30-something percent
[01:36:57.793 --> 01:36:59.235]  You will remember the exact numbers.
[01:36:59.235 --> 01:36:59.976]  We're undecided.
[01:36:59.976 --> 01:37:06.325]  We have 37% in the polls, undecided now, and Dean Barkley is closing the gap in those polls.
[01:37:06.325 --> 01:37:12.954]  He's doing radio and TV all over the state as an independent up there, so I've got my fingers crossed here.
[01:37:13.736 --> 01:37:16.639]  Well, and let's remember, Minnesotans did it before.
[01:37:16.639 --> 01:37:20.543]  As you said, Alex, they did it with me exactly 10 years ago.
[01:37:20.543 --> 01:37:25.467]  And believe me, the people are twice as angry today as they were 10 years ago.
[01:37:25.467 --> 01:37:27.349]  When I did it, it was retaliate in 98, and we're now...
[01:37:29.751 --> 01:37:34.752]  We can double retaliate, no wait, because the people are even more angry.
[01:37:34.752 --> 01:37:40.194]  And that's the true way you can vent your anger, is by electing people that they don't want in there.
[01:37:40.194 --> 01:37:47.055]  People that aren't going to shade out everything, and people that aren't going to fall victim to their political careers.
[01:37:47.055 --> 01:37:52.677]  Because that's what it all comes down to, is these people saving their political careers.
[01:37:52.677 --> 01:37:54.077]  They got cushy jobs,
[01:37:54.557 --> 01:38:04.861]  They like the positions they're in, and they will say and do anything to keep them to anyone who will keep them in that power position of those cushy jobs.
[01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:11.504]  And it's time to route them out of there, and you know you can do that by electing Dean Barclay and other independents throughout the country.
[01:38:11.504 --> 01:38:22.848]  Well, people need to understand, like with Ron Paul, that's a big national because it's a president, but a senator is a national position even if they're from the state, because they vote on national policy and the power of one senator
[01:38:23.448 --> 01:38:29.391]  With a bully pulpit to speak out and to expose what's happening.
[01:38:29.391 --> 01:38:31.772]  Let's bring up Dean Barkley and then let the governor go here in a moment.
[01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:35.493]  Okay, plus a senator can investigate on their own, too, if something.
[01:38:35.493 --> 01:38:41.476]  A senator can start a senatorial investigation, which is terrific, and one senator can do that also.
[01:38:41.476 --> 01:38:42.436]  I'm gonna say goodbye.
[01:38:42.436 --> 01:38:45.057]  Good luck, Dean, and thanks again, Alex.
[01:38:45.057 --> 01:38:45.698]  I'm on my way.
[01:38:45.698 --> 01:38:47.038]  I gotta get back to work.
[01:38:47.038 --> 01:38:47.698]  All right, Governor.
[01:38:47.698 --> 01:38:48.379]  Thanks for being with us.
[01:38:48.379 --> 01:38:48.759]  Take care.
[01:38:48.759 --> 01:38:48.919]  Bye-bye.
[01:38:49.634 --> 01:38:50.214]  Alright, there he goes.
[01:38:50.214 --> 01:38:51.255]  Let's bring Dean Barkley up.
[01:38:51.255 --> 01:38:53.675]  Dean, that was the question I was going to ask you here.
[01:38:53.675 --> 01:39:00.377]  We had congressmen on a few weeks ago who were threatened with martial law, but were not allowed under House rules to say who threatened them with that.
[01:39:00.377 --> 01:39:04.579]  As a senator, I mean, what are you going to try to do?
[01:39:04.579 --> 01:39:11.081]  You've already been there for a month before appointed, but if you get elected next Tuesday, what are you going to do to expose all this secrecy?
[01:39:11.081 --> 01:39:12.281]  Well, I've got the bully pulpit.
[01:39:12.281 --> 01:39:14.422]  When I see something, I'm going to speak up.
[01:39:14.422 --> 01:39:16.023]  They aren't going to silence me.
[01:39:16.023 --> 01:39:17.283]  What are they going to do, throw me in jail?
[01:39:17.944 --> 01:39:22.785]  I mean, I've got a perfect opportunity when I see that something's not right to tell people about it.
[01:39:22.785 --> 01:39:24.146]  You know, be honest.
[01:39:24.146 --> 01:39:27.947]  You know, we need a good dose of honesty and truthfulness in Washington right now.
[01:39:27.947 --> 01:39:32.488]  There's so much stuff going on right now, it's unbelievable.
[01:39:32.488 --> 01:39:39.610]  Well, I was just going over with Jesse what's happening with the banker bailout bill being secret, but the parts that are public
[01:39:40.245 --> 01:39:45.732]  They're giving tens of billions per bank in bonuses from the bonus money.
[01:39:45.732 --> 01:39:46.653]  Well, that's what it is.
[01:39:46.653 --> 01:39:49.356]  The banker bonus is what the bailout was.
[01:39:49.356 --> 01:39:52.540]  And they're just openly admitting they're keeping it for them personal selves.
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:54.863]  I mean, they're really rubbing it in.
[01:39:55.805 --> 01:39:57.866]  Well, I heard and I read this in England.
[01:39:57.866 --> 01:40:00.967]  The newspaper in England reported it about a week ago.
[01:40:00.967 --> 01:40:08.951]  They're projecting to pay over $70 billion in bonuses from these same banks that we just gave $150 billion to.
[01:40:08.951 --> 01:40:10.032]  I mean, it's outrageous.
[01:40:10.032 --> 01:40:13.513]  It's just unconscionable what's going on.
[01:40:13.513 --> 01:40:14.494]  I mean, my God!
[01:40:14.494 --> 01:40:16.494]  I mean, how much more blatant can they get?
[01:40:16.494 --> 01:40:19.616]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[01:40:19.616 --> 01:40:22.977]  Dean, I know you wanted to come back on and thank the audience, and I want to thank them as well.
[01:40:24.691 --> 01:40:25.212]  Oh, yes.
[01:40:25.212 --> 01:40:28.137]  I mean, without your listeners, I would not be on the air.
[01:40:28.757 --> 01:40:31.938]  We made a TV ad on Tuesday right after the show.
[01:40:31.938 --> 01:40:35.240]  We had enough money to do that, and now we're starting to air it tonight.
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:40.302]  We're going to unveil it at 3 o'clock this afternoon, and if it wasn't for your listeners, this would not be happening.
[01:40:40.302 --> 01:40:46.864]  So we've got to shut up this Minnesota right now, because unfortunately, a lot of people don't think you're credible unless they see you on television.
[01:40:46.864 --> 01:40:54.147]  Well, that's going to happen right now, and every dollar that we're getting from now until Tuesday is going in to increase that buy.
[01:40:54.147 --> 01:40:58.369]  So if people want to help out even more, we certainly would take it to increase the buy we've already made.
[01:40:58.989 --> 01:41:00.892]  SenatorBarclay.com.
[01:41:00.892 --> 01:41:05.237]  www.senatorbarclay.com and give out that number.
[01:41:05.237 --> 01:41:08.802]  Yeah, the phone number if you want to call and if you don't have internet access is 763...
[01:41:10.776 --> 01:41:15.779]  417-9972, and we've got people on the phones right now ready to take your call.
[01:41:15.779 --> 01:41:21.101]  So, you know, whether it's $5, $10, whatever you can afford, you can put me over the top.
[01:41:21.101 --> 01:41:24.863]  If we could double that radio or that TV by, you know, that's twice the chance.
[01:41:24.863 --> 01:41:25.784]  I'm going to pull this one off.
[01:41:25.784 --> 01:41:27.044]  I think we've got a shot.
[01:41:27.044 --> 01:41:29.025]  Anything can happen in this election, I think.
[01:41:29.025 --> 01:41:32.607]  What we did with Jesse 10 years ago, we're going to do again.
[01:41:32.607 --> 01:41:38.150]  Well, I wish I would have known how close this race was earlier, but, you know, it's hard to pay attention to everything, but it is important in a Senate race.
[01:41:39.349 --> 01:41:48.804]  Your competitors have got 30 plus million and you'd only raised 50,000 in the previous few months before this and you'd already gotten within 10 points of them with that.
[01:41:48.804 --> 01:41:50.807]  Imagine what this 40-something grand is going to do.
[01:41:51.545 --> 01:41:57.031]  No, it's just been a godsend, and like I say, I couldn't be more thankful for the people who listen to your show.
[01:41:57.031 --> 01:41:59.514]  They could actually change history in this election in Minnesota.
[01:41:59.514 --> 01:42:01.396]  This is more than just Minnesota.
[01:42:01.396 --> 01:42:07.002]  This is sending a message to Washington, for the whole country, that we've had it with the way you're behaving.
[01:42:07.002 --> 01:42:10.045]  You had it by destroying our country, this two-party partisanship.
[01:42:10.385 --> 01:42:10.806]  We're good to go.
[01:42:27.143 --> 01:42:31.124]  Also, our listeners can, even if they can't donate $5, they can go get the TV.
[01:42:31.124 --> 01:42:35.606]  I know you have several others up on the website, senatorbartley.com.
[01:42:35.606 --> 01:42:41.608]  Is the new TV ad up there so people can, you know, email it around to all their friends?
[01:42:41.608 --> 01:42:43.908]  It will be up by 3 o'clock.
[01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:44.789]  I'm not sure.
[01:42:44.789 --> 01:42:45.969]  I've been out all over the state.
[01:42:45.969 --> 01:42:48.850]  I haven't even looked at my website in about a day.
[01:42:48.850 --> 01:42:50.731]  But it will be up sometime today.
[01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:54.652]  So it could be up there right now, but it's probably going to be up around 3, 4 o'clock this afternoon.
[01:42:55.962 --> 01:43:01.246]  So that's another thing, and if people have friends and family in Minnesota, call them.
[01:43:01.246 --> 01:43:06.629]  Even if you live in Texas or New York or South Dakota or California or wherever you live.
[01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:08.251]  Let's say you're in England working.
[01:43:08.251 --> 01:43:10.212]  Call your friends and family.
[01:43:10.212 --> 01:43:13.995]  Call them in Minnesota and tell them, look, you need to vote for Senator Dean Barclay.
[01:43:13.995 --> 01:43:15.155]  He's a great guy.
[01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:16.977]  The two parties are selling us out.
[01:43:16.977 --> 01:43:18.798]  He's going to go investigate the banker bailout.
[01:43:18.798 --> 01:43:20.019]  He's going to end the war in Iraq.
[01:43:20.519 --> 01:43:23.060]  He's going to, you know, push and decriminalize drugs.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:26.961]  People are going to say, oh, well, you know, it's all over, New World Order.
[01:43:26.961 --> 01:43:29.502]  Look, it's over when the fat lady sings, folks.
[01:43:29.502 --> 01:43:31.683]  We're fighting, we're waking people up.
[01:43:31.683 --> 01:43:36.225]  I mean, everything the New World Order is doing is so unpopular right now, and we just have to stand up.
[01:43:36.225 --> 01:43:38.926]  And just the, just the reflex, just the action.
[01:43:39.666 --> 01:43:42.467]  Of standing up and saying no and supporting.
[01:43:42.467 --> 01:43:43.667]  It's that fighting spirit.
[01:43:43.667 --> 01:43:46.268]  We may not win this time, but we'll win next time in other fights.
[01:43:46.268 --> 01:43:48.609]  It's all about taking action.
[01:43:48.609 --> 01:43:54.450]  We know that if good people hadn't been fighting tyranny for hundreds of years, that we wouldn't even be alive today.
[01:43:54.450 --> 01:43:56.030]  We wouldn't even have the system we have today.
[01:43:56.030 --> 01:44:01.612]  As bad as it is, we owe the people that have stood up to evil for what we do have that's good in this world.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.342]  No, I couldn't have said it better myself.
[01:44:05.342 --> 01:44:07.925]  Our founding fathers didn't quit against all odds.
[01:44:07.925 --> 01:44:17.774]  They fought to give us what we have now, and that's the least we can do is to keep some freedom, keep some honesty and integrity in our government and turn it around.
[01:44:17.774 --> 01:44:23.320]  We've got the greatest form of government in the world, but we've lost our way because we've let them get away with it.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:24.541]  Now it's time to stand up.
[01:44:25.061 --> 01:44:28.523]  Quit bitchin' about it and do something about it, and we can start by electing me.
[01:44:28.523 --> 01:44:31.645]  That'd be a start, but that's just a start that others can follow.
[01:44:31.645 --> 01:44:37.748]  We've got to do something to turn this country in a different direction than it's heading right now, because it's heading in the wrong direction.
[01:44:37.748 --> 01:44:43.952]  Let's go back briefly, because people can see that as a kind of like a signpost or a roadmap of what happened before.
[01:44:43.952 --> 01:44:50.056]  How did you and Jesse Ventura meet, and, you know, I know you headed up his campaign and got him to run.
[01:44:50.056 --> 01:44:52.417]  I mean, tell the story of that campaign briefly.
[01:44:53.104 --> 01:45:00.168]  Yeah, well it all started when I ran to get the Independence Party Minnesota Major Party status in 1996.
[01:45:00.168 --> 01:45:04.691]  I ran for the Senate there to get the 5% vote total we needed to become a major party.
[01:45:04.691 --> 01:45:09.934]  And Jesse, I recruited to be the honorary chair of that campaign in 1996.
[01:45:11.718 --> 01:45:22.042]  And while I was marching in my hometown Fourth of July parade in Annandale, Minnesota, Jesse marched it with me, or walked it with me, and I noticed that everybody was cheering for him and ignoring me.
[01:45:22.042 --> 01:45:27.665]  And at that point in time, the lightbulb went on, and I said, I wonder if this would equate to political popularity.
[01:45:27.665 --> 01:45:29.846]  And I turned to him and said, you know, the wrong guy's running.
[01:45:29.846 --> 01:45:31.006]  You're running next.
[01:45:31.006 --> 01:45:33.867]  He laughed at me at the time and said he didn't want to go to Washington.
[01:45:33.867 --> 01:45:35.208]  I said, well, you don't have to.
[01:45:35.208 --> 01:45:37.189]  The governor's race is in two years.
[01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:40.090]  I worked on him for a year to convince him to do it, ran his campaign.
[01:45:40.590 --> 01:45:42.692]  And we changed history.
[01:45:42.692 --> 01:45:43.532]  It worked.
[01:45:43.532 --> 01:45:44.633]  Well, you certainly did.
[01:45:44.633 --> 01:45:50.317]  So I want people to understand that, you know, you're the brains, you're the mind that basically hatched this originally.
[01:45:50.317 --> 01:45:55.861]  And that scared a lot of incumbent governors that, in a bad way, spurred Schwarzenegger to run.
[01:45:55.861 --> 01:46:03.086]  But, you know, regardless, it showed people what can happen and that these people are not invincible.
[01:46:03.086 --> 01:46:06.169]  So I sure hope that you win next Tuesday.
[01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:09.391]  When are we going to get some new polls out to see if things are continuing to narrow?
[01:46:10.177 --> 01:46:12.999]  Oh, I'm sure they're going to be out in the next few days or not.
[01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:18.021]  At this point in time, I don't think the polls matter in Minnesota, you know, whether I go up a couple or not.
[01:46:18.021 --> 01:46:22.824]  The fact is, in Minnesota, they're predicting a historic voter turnout.
[01:46:22.824 --> 01:46:27.826]  80%, which is 20% more than Ventura's was, and his was a historic high.
[01:46:27.826 --> 01:46:32.389]  Yeah, that's the key, because you got 37% undecided.
[01:46:32.389 --> 01:46:33.589]  Absolutely.
[01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:38.572]  And if they're undecided, it means they're not enamored by Al Franken or Norm Coleman or the Democrat or the Republican.
[01:46:38.942 --> 01:46:50.266]  And that's why this TV campaign was so critical to give, you know, like I say, a lot of people base your viability on seeing you on television, and that's why I've been trying so hard to do that.
[01:46:50.266 --> 01:46:53.147]  It's probably sad that we have to say that, but it's true.
[01:46:53.147 --> 01:46:55.527]  We did the same thing with Jesse ten years ago.
[01:46:55.527 --> 01:46:57.268]  We started running his first TV ad.
[01:46:57.748 --> 01:47:01.730]  Uh, the Thursday before the election, and that's exactly the same time frame we're doing here.
[01:47:01.730 --> 01:47:03.891]  And I think the same thing can happen again.
[01:47:03.891 --> 01:47:08.793]  And like Jesse said, I heard earlier, people are so much more angry now than they were ten years ago.
[01:47:08.793 --> 01:47:15.656]  And he was ten points behind on the Friday, eight points behind the day of the election, and he won by how many points?
[01:47:15.656 --> 01:47:17.697]  He won by, he won by two points, 37 to 35.
[01:47:20.549 --> 01:47:23.451]  He went from about 26-27% in the polls to 37.
[01:47:23.451 --> 01:47:26.553]  Well, I mean, you got Congress with a 9% approval rating.
[01:47:26.553 --> 01:47:27.594]  Both parties are hated.
[01:47:27.594 --> 01:47:29.215]  How could you not win?
[01:47:29.215 --> 01:47:32.897]  How could people not vote for somebody who's basically lined up with Ron Paul?
[01:47:33.726 --> 01:47:36.990]  Well, you know, people sit there and play these mind games with themselves.
[01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:54.089]  I'm sure the vast majority of Minnesotans like what I'm saying and would like to vote for him, but somehow they start thinking, well, I don't know if he's going to win, so if I vote for him, my worst enemy, which could either be the Republican or the Democrat, might win, and without I can't have that, so I'm going to hold my nose and vote for my second choice.
[01:47:54.489 --> 01:47:59.492]  Well, people get the government they deserve, I guess, but one thing listeners can do also, even if you don't live in Minnesota, pick a talk station
[01:48:19.634 --> 01:48:28.162]  Listen to it online this afternoon and throughout the weekend, and call into talk shows on whatever issue they're talking about, and then it'll be the election, and bring up Senator Dean Barclay.
[01:48:28.162 --> 01:48:31.365]  And say, look, he's against the Baker bailout, but the others are for it.
[01:48:31.365 --> 01:48:35.629]  And just say, Senator Dean Barclay, you know, SenatorBarclay.com.
[01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:37.711]  And I think, you know, that's effective right there.
[01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:39.012]  I mean, look, we're in this fight
[01:48:39.693 --> 01:48:41.694]  We're fighting as hard as we can.
[01:48:41.694 --> 01:48:45.856]  And, uh, you know, I'm just trying to find a silver lining in this whole election, which is a nightmare.
[01:48:45.856 --> 01:48:48.897]  And a senatorial race is a big deal.
[01:48:48.897 --> 01:48:53.279]  Our special interests wouldn't have poured $30-plus million into those other two.
[01:48:53.279 --> 01:48:54.959]  You know, that tells you who the good guy is.
[01:48:54.959 --> 01:48:56.500]  Uh, that's Dean Markley.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:49:02.842]  Look at the other political whores getting... That's gotta be hundreds of times what you've gotten.
[01:49:02.842 --> 01:49:05.964]  Oh, and both my opponents have spent $20 million.
[01:49:05.964 --> 01:49:08.905]  So it's $40 million that they've spent themselves.
[01:49:09.466 --> 01:49:14.770]  And the countless, I can't believe the number of special interest ads that are going on.
[01:49:14.770 --> 01:49:19.973]  It's got to be another hundred million dollars that they're spending in the state on just the 527s.
[01:49:19.973 --> 01:49:31.761]  Every special interest in the world has their own 527 at work here running ads, either against Howard or Norm or, you know, it's just incredible the amount of money that's being spent in here to prop up the federal government.
[01:49:31.761 --> 01:49:33.903]  And meanwhile, the public thinks it's about that horse race.
[01:49:33.903 --> 01:49:34.763]  They don't understand.
[01:49:34.763 --> 01:49:38.566]  The system putting money into the left-right paradigm, that's the conspiracy.
[01:49:40.416 --> 01:49:42.238]  You're running our country right now.
[01:49:42.238 --> 01:49:43.719]  We all know it.
[01:49:43.719 --> 01:49:45.820]  You know, there's no independence when they go there.
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:47.502]  They gotta pay all these people back.
[01:49:47.502 --> 01:49:49.343]  And that's what's wrong with our country.
[01:49:49.343 --> 01:49:49.724]  $40 million.
[01:49:49.724 --> 01:49:51.565]  It was $30 million a week ago.
[01:49:51.565 --> 01:49:54.307]  $40 million against your $50,000 now.
[01:49:54.307 --> 01:49:56.869]  Now close to... And I'm within striking range.
[01:49:56.869 --> 01:49:58.591]  Almost incredible, isn't it?
[01:49:58.591 --> 01:50:03.595]  But now you're almost to $100,000 with the $40-something my listener sent in, right?
[01:50:03.595 --> 01:50:05.416]  Well, actually, we crossed $150,000 last night.
[01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:09.295]  Well, good.
[01:50:09.295 --> 01:50:13.038]  So total, how much of my listeners sent in?
[01:50:13.038 --> 01:50:15.759]  Between the radio show now, about 65,000.
[01:50:15.759 --> 01:50:17.040]  65,000!
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:22.464]  You guys are great out there, folks.
[01:50:22.464 --> 01:50:25.185]  You're just absolutely fabulous.
[01:50:25.185 --> 01:50:28.547]  Dean Barkley, let's come back with some final comments from you on the other side.
[01:50:28.547 --> 01:50:31.189]  The website is senatorbarkley.com.
[01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:33.991]  He's been there for a month before, appointed by Governor Ventura.
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:43.362]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[01:50:43.362 --> 01:50:57.306]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[01:50:57.306 --> 01:51:00.467]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[01:51:00.947 --> 01:51:05.612]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[01:51:05.612 --> 01:51:07.715]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[01:51:07.715 --> 01:51:11.278]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[01:51:11.278 --> 01:51:17.866]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[01:51:18.106 --> 01:51:25.070]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or ionic zone ozone generators by going to ioniczone.com or calling 800-549-9535.
[01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:26.931]  That's I-O-N-I-C, zone, dot com, or toll free, 800-549-9535, ionic zone.
[01:51:43.775 --> 01:51:45.336]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:51:45.336 --> 01:51:47.038]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:51:47.038 --> 01:51:49.939]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:51:49.939 --> 01:51:54.482]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:51:54.482 --> 01:52:03.248]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:52:03.248 --> 01:52:08.131]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:15.971 --> 01:52:19.412]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:19.412 --> 01:52:22.193]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:22.193 --> 01:52:28.774]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:52:33.855 --> 01:52:36.356]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:52:42.409 --> 01:52:45.412]  What will you do when it happens?
[01:52:45.412 --> 01:52:50.356]  When you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation and fear?
[01:52:50.356 --> 01:52:56.702]  Or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with PatriotFood.com?
[01:52:56.702 --> 01:52:58.584]  The signs are everywhere.
[01:52:58.584 --> 01:53:00.606]  You have no excuses.
[01:53:00.606 --> 01:53:04.830]  Your indifference today will determine the magnitude of your suffering tomorrow.
[01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:10.991]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?
[01:53:10.991 --> 01:53:16.632]  Patriotfood.com has 100 pounds of dry food supplies for just $3 a pound.

[01:53:27.114 --> 01:53:29.854]  There are just two kinds of people.
[01:53:29.854 --> 01:53:31.875]  Slave and free.
[01:53:31.875 --> 01:53:32.895]  Be ready.
[01:53:32.895 --> 01:53:33.415]  Be free.
[01:53:33.575 --> 01:53:35.342]  Join me with patriotfood.com
[01:53:40.228 --> 01:53:42.750]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:45.932]  Well, we're trying on the $70,000 raised by this wonderful audience.
[01:53:45.932 --> 01:53:52.135]  It's a huge audience, it's an active audience, and we appreciate you every dime of it going into TV ads right now.
[01:53:52.135 --> 01:53:53.756]  And they get to bump.
[01:53:53.756 --> 01:53:56.138]  The establishment's already bought so much.
[01:53:56.138 --> 01:54:00.120]  Under Minnesota law, they get to have equal time if they've got the money.
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:04.283]  And so they're bumping people right there in the primetime shows, in the news programs.
[01:54:04.283 --> 01:54:05.904]  Tell us about that, Dean Barkley.
[01:54:06.644 --> 01:54:10.787]  Yeah, they have to give us equal time with them since we haven't bought any TV spots yet.
[01:54:10.787 --> 01:54:12.988]  We can pick any show that we want.
[01:54:12.988 --> 01:54:17.090]  So we go right to the head of the line and bump someone else's ads off.
[01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:21.433]  We have a great opportunity to maximize this buy that we're going to do.
[01:54:21.433 --> 01:54:30.879]  And obviously every dollar we raise between now and Tuesday is going to go to bump more of their negative ads off and give the positive ads and get people at least, you know, the feeling that I can win this.
[01:54:30.879 --> 01:54:32.620]  Because if they get that feeling, I will win.
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:33.680]  It's that simple.
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:34.201]  Tell us the
[01:54:35.825 --> 01:54:37.026]  The gist of the new ad.
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:57.021]  Alright, and that goes on tonight.
[01:54:57.021 --> 01:54:58.301]  Tell us where it's going to be on.
[01:55:23.076 --> 01:55:24.657]  I'm not sure where it's going to be on.
[01:55:24.657 --> 01:55:27.919]  I didn't do the ad, but Bill Hildman does that.
[01:55:27.919 --> 01:55:29.941]  He's an expert at it.
[01:55:29.941 --> 01:55:33.924]  It's going to be on some network news or TV news.
[01:55:33.924 --> 01:55:35.805]  It'll be on cable.
[01:55:35.805 --> 01:55:39.188]  It'll be wherever he can get the best deal.
[01:55:39.188 --> 01:55:43.431]  He's a master at making money go a long way.
[01:55:43.431 --> 01:55:50.136]  If they want to go to my website, they may have where it's actually going to be playing at SenatorBarclay.com, but they might have that information on the website.
[01:55:51.354 --> 01:55:58.138]  Well, we're praying for you and we certainly support you and the listeners appreciate your thanks, Senator Barkley.
[01:55:58.138 --> 01:56:01.639]  And hopefully you'll be going to the Senate for six years, not four weeks.
[01:56:01.639 --> 01:56:04.601]  What was it like in closing the four weeks that you were in the Senate?
[01:56:05.303 --> 01:56:07.904]  Oh, it was awesome being the balance of power.
[01:56:07.904 --> 01:56:11.485]  I never had my posterior kissed so much in my life.
[01:56:11.485 --> 01:56:16.266]  It was almost pathetic because I was in an extraordinary position, but it was great.
[01:56:16.266 --> 01:56:17.346]  I met some great people.
[01:56:17.346 --> 01:56:18.406]  I got some things done.
[01:56:18.406 --> 01:56:20.487]  I actually didn't get full of myself.
[01:56:20.487 --> 01:56:24.728]  I went to work and actually did something, which is kind of unique, I guess, in politics.
[01:56:24.728 --> 01:56:25.728]  I solved some problems.
[01:56:28.456 --> 01:56:36.779]  Well, you certainly did do that, and I'm going to be watching the Minnesota Senatorial race very, very closely.
[01:56:36.779 --> 01:56:39.800]  And again, I want to thank the audience one more time.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:44.701]  You know, Ventura, the whole time he was here, he was just like, oh man, Dean Barkley's a great guy.
[01:56:44.701 --> 01:56:50.503]  You know, I think about how I should have run, but I, you know, I just, I'm just so sick of politics and the corruption and begging for money, but
[01:56:51.266 --> 01:56:58.908]  You know, maybe I should, you know, I thought about running, I just, you know, I'm old now, and, you know, I, I, you know, it's like going into prison.
[01:56:58.908 --> 01:57:01.549]  What he said, uh, to do it, but he said, but Dean's doing it.
[01:57:01.549 --> 01:57:08.710]  Man, if we would have just had more money, and he wasn't even really asking me, he was just talking about it, pontificating in the car and at the hotel about it.
[01:57:08.710 --> 01:57:15.252]  And then, uh, I was like, wait a minute, Dean Barkley, he called Ted Anderson last week, the owner of the network, and Ted said, hey, do you want to have this guy on?
[01:57:15.252 --> 01:57:17.053]  And I said, yeah, but never got around to it.
[01:57:17.053 --> 01:57:18.753]  I said, I'll have Dean on.
[01:57:19.474 --> 01:57:20.635]  And he said, he said, really?
[01:57:20.635 --> 01:57:21.156]  You will?
[01:57:21.156 --> 01:57:21.456]  I don't know.
[01:57:21.456 --> 01:57:23.998]  Well, I know you got a big show, but I don't know how much good that'll do.
[01:57:23.998 --> 01:57:25.019]  And I said, no.
[01:57:25.019 --> 01:57:30.263]  And when I dropped him off Sunday night after the concert at the hotel, I said, go call him.
[01:57:30.263 --> 01:57:31.024]  Set it up tomorrow.
[01:57:31.024 --> 01:57:31.905]  And we did it.
[01:57:32.603 --> 01:57:33.944]  Well, it made all the difference.
[01:57:33.944 --> 01:57:37.167]  I mean, your listeners could be electing the next U.S.
[01:57:37.167 --> 01:57:39.088]  Senator from Minnesota, but it'll be more than that.
[01:57:39.088 --> 01:57:43.371]  It'll be the hope that this is the beginning of a change in Washington.
[01:57:43.371 --> 01:57:44.893]  And your listeners, I thank all of you.
[01:57:44.893 --> 01:57:50.437]  I mean, I couldn't be doing this without you, and I thank you for every dollar that you've sent in, because it's going for a good cause.
[01:57:50.917 --> 01:57:51.557]  Absolutely.
[01:57:51.557 --> 01:58:03.183]  Senator Barkley, thank you for spending time with us, and I know you're going to pop in Monday on the eve of the election and after the election on Wednesday to give us your take on how it all went, whether win, lose, or draw.
[01:58:03.183 --> 01:58:09.046]  We stood up, we took action, we did the best we could, and that's why we're winners overall and on the side of right and justice.
[01:58:09.046 --> 01:58:10.046]  Thank you, sir.
[01:58:10.046 --> 01:58:11.547]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:58:11.547 --> 01:58:12.428]  Take care.
[01:58:12.428 --> 01:58:13.808]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:13.808 --> 01:58:15.229]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[01:58:19.364 --> 01:58:20.564]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:20.564 --> 01:58:27.387]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:27.387 --> 01:58:30.608]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:58:30.608 --> 01:58:34.109]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:34.109 --> 01:58:36.730]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:36.730 --> 01:58:38.290]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:38.290 --> 01:58:39.091]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:39.091 --> 01:58:40.031]  This is his MO.
[01:58:40.031 --> 01:58:41.472]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:41.472 --> 01:58:42.892]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:43.453 --> 01:58:50.600]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:51.081]  Some U.S.
[01:58:51.081 --> 01:58:57.428]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:57.428 --> 01:59:00.892]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:01.112 --> 01:59:11.195]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:11.195 --> 01:59:12.636]  Fabled enemies.

[01:59:20.119 --> 01:59:23.740]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:29.807 --> 01:59:32.208]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:32.208 --> 01:59:41.491]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:41.491 --> 01:59:42.812]  Big Brother.
[01:59:42.812 --> 01:59:44.572]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:44.572 --> 01:59:46.333]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:46.333 --> 01:59:47.913]  You want answers?
[01:59:47.913 --> 01:59:48.794]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:48.794 --> 01:59:53.655]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:53.655 --> 01:59:57.737]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.989 --> 02:00:07.030]  Got two hours spanning out before us.
[02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:12.494]  We're going to have wide open phones at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:12.494 --> 02:00:17.738]  For the next hour, we're joined by none other than Bob Chapman, who joins us at least once a week.
[02:00:17.738 --> 02:00:19.659]  We always appreciate his great analysis.
[02:00:19.659 --> 02:00:22.041]  Ran the biggest gold brokerage firm in the world.
[02:00:22.041 --> 02:00:25.003]  Had the largest newsletter in the world.
[02:00:25.003 --> 02:00:29.546]  Was business partners with Gary Allen, who wrote None Dare Call a Conspiracy in the early 70s.
[02:00:29.546 --> 02:00:32.388]  The tens of millions of, I know, I mean just millions of those books.
[02:00:33.452 --> 02:00:35.474]  My memory says 4 million, 5 million, I can't remember.
[02:00:35.474 --> 02:00:48.666]  The point is, millions of the book went out, woke up so many people, including myself, been involved in the fight, you know, back when Gilbert Griffin started out, worked with him, a real icon, and we just appreciated him coming on.
[02:00:48.666 --> 02:00:54.171]  First thing I want to talk about, Bob, I want to break down the economy this hour and take calls on that issue.
[02:00:54.171 --> 02:00:56.473]  The InternationalForecaster.com, people can learn more, but
[02:00:57.413 --> 02:01:23.064]  AP is reporting, like you wrote it or something, that the bankers are keeping the money and using it for personal bonuses, that it's over a trillion, and that they're blocking out all the documents, not even letting people know who's getting the money, and the banks are so arrogant, they openly brag and say, yeah, we're taking it for bonuses, and in England it's the same thing, just Goldman Sachs England branch, fourteen billion dollars, seven billion pounds,
[02:01:23.744 --> 02:01:27.907]  Well, because they run the world and they are the Illuminati and they do what they want to do.
[02:01:43.235 --> 02:01:53.698]  And nothing is said about the money that went from Lehman's office in New York, in London to New York, the day before they went down.
[02:01:53.698 --> 02:01:57.538]  And that money, as far as I know, has disappeared.
[02:01:57.538 --> 02:02:03.520]  Switching gears and going back to the banks, they've received $163 billion.
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:07.401]  And as you say, it's a big bonus time.
[02:02:07.401 --> 02:02:11.882]  And not only that, half of that money over the next three years will be used
[02:02:12.475 --> 02:02:22.029]  In order to pay dividends to the shareholders and some of the biggest shareholders are people who are on their boards or offices of their corporations.
[02:02:23.042 --> 02:02:29.806]  And in addition to that, they can use that money as they see fit.
[02:02:29.806 --> 02:02:35.269]  Now, the government has told them that they should use the money to expand loans.
[02:02:35.269 --> 02:02:39.712]  They are going to use that money to bolster their balance sheet.
[02:02:39.712 --> 02:02:44.835]  And at the same time, they could go into the markets and speculate with it.
[02:02:45.815 --> 02:02:57.525]  Such as buying from time to time when instructed by the Treasury Department or the Fed to buy the Dow Jones Industrial Average and make it go up 900 points in one day.
[02:02:57.525 --> 02:03:01.208]  Those are some of the things that they can do.
[02:03:01.208 --> 02:03:03.790]  And so the whole thing is a giant scam.
[02:03:06.551 --> 02:03:08.473]  And it's admittedly a scam.
[02:03:08.473 --> 02:03:20.385]  I mean, they said, past this three and a half weeks ago, there will be a depression, they threaten martial law in the Congress, and then they get the money, and they hoard it all and only give it to themselves, and now the banks are saying they're just gonna keep it and use it for bonuses.
[02:03:20.385 --> 02:03:21.387]  Openly!
[02:03:21.387 --> 02:03:24.510]  Just throwing the gauntlet down, saying, we run you.
[02:03:26.385 --> 02:03:33.169]  Well, you know, you've got AIG, which has been a CIA front since the Second World War.
[02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:35.791]  Actually, before that.
[02:03:35.791 --> 02:03:40.974]  And they received $122 billion, and nobody knows where it went.
[02:03:40.974 --> 02:03:48.079]  They also raised $20 billion in stock and debt in May.
[02:03:48.079 --> 02:03:51.101]  So they received $143 billion, and they said that they didn't have any serious problems.
[02:03:55.026 --> 02:03:59.209]  When they told the people that they should buy their stock and their debt.
[02:03:59.209 --> 02:04:08.115]  And now we find out that not only did they have problems that they didn't admit that were hidden, but they were in fact bankrupt.
[02:04:08.115 --> 02:04:21.345]  And now we've already poured in this $123 billion from the taxpayer, and now they want more money, and they won't tell you when the money went.
[02:04:21.345 --> 02:04:22.826]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:04:24.306 --> 02:04:26.951]  Our guest is Bob Chapman.
[02:04:26.951 --> 02:04:28.674]  And folks, you think this is bad?
[02:04:28.674 --> 02:04:29.535]  They're just going to do more.
[02:04:29.535 --> 02:04:31.078]  That's what tyrants do.
[02:04:31.078 --> 02:04:34.985]  I mean, they are doing whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[02:04:34.985 --> 02:04:36.188]  Just open crime.
[02:04:36.188 --> 02:04:36.729]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:38.078 --> 02:04:41.359]  Do you want to pay for the government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[02:04:41.359 --> 02:04:43.320]  You may have no choice.
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:46.501]  Obviously, taxpayers are on the hook for over $6 trillion.
[02:04:46.501 --> 02:04:51.063]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations.
[02:04:51.063 --> 02:04:57.046]  The part that most people don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401ks and IRAs.
[02:04:58.675 --> 02:05:03.898]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.
[02:05:03.898 --> 02:05:07.761]  The solution is to fund a self-directed IRA with gold and silver.
[02:05:07.761 --> 02:05:11.863]  Put your retirement money beyond the reach of government financiers today by calling 1-866-323-5665.
[02:05:11.863 --> 02:05:13.664]  SafeGrow IRAs are just a phone call away.

[02:05:37.248 --> 02:05:39.210]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:05:39.210 --> 02:05:42.834]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:05:42.834 --> 02:05:45.277]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:05:45.277 --> 02:05:48.320]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:54.067]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:54.067 --> 02:05:57.991]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:06:43.785 --> 02:06:45.786]  Chemicals and toxins are in the air.

[02:06:54.454 --> 02:06:55.415]  How do we fight back?

[02:06:57.016 --> 02:06:58.557]  Make a life change decision.

[02:07:20.075 --> 02:07:20.375]  That's 928-308-0408.
[02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:28.823]  308-0408.
[02:07:28.823 --> 02:07:38.592]  Don't be deceived by the bullies of the trade.
[02:07:38.592 --> 02:07:45.219]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:45.219 --> 02:07:48.182]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:52.350 --> 02:08:03.953]  In six years of Paul Watson working for me, six plus years now, he has never IM'd me saying, I want to come on the radio, I have a major breaking story.
[02:08:03.953 --> 02:08:11.136]  He writes stories, he runs the website, he does customer service, and then I always have to drag him on air, because you know, Paul doesn't like the limelight.
[02:08:11.136 --> 02:08:15.997]  He IM'd me and he said, I've got a major exclusive story, can you get me on the air right now?
[02:08:16.690 --> 02:08:19.831]  So I said, well, 20 minutes and Bob Chapman will ride shotgun with us.
[02:08:19.831 --> 02:08:21.072]  And that just came in.
[02:08:21.072 --> 02:08:23.472]  And I said, Colin, 20 minutes, bottom of the hour.
[02:08:23.472 --> 02:08:25.473]  I don't even know what it is.
[02:08:25.473 --> 02:08:27.414]  It must be huge.
[02:08:27.414 --> 02:08:34.456]  Over at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:34.456 --> 02:08:40.038]  And he's saying it's being intensely debated in China, but has not been in English language yet.
[02:08:40.038 --> 02:08:44.780]  And see, his girlfriend is a Chinese master's or PhD student.
[02:08:45.876 --> 02:08:49.357]  They're in Sheffield, and she speaks fluent English.
[02:08:49.357 --> 02:08:50.397]  She has an English accent.
[02:08:50.397 --> 02:08:53.057]  She's really English, but her family, a lot of it was in China.
[02:08:53.057 --> 02:09:00.079]  So Paul's been to China, and he's got a lot of inside insights on that.
[02:09:00.079 --> 02:09:02.439]  Oh my gosh!
[02:09:02.439 --> 02:09:05.520]  Oh my God!
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:06.320]  You know what?
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:07.980]  Watson, go ahead and call in now.
[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:10.120]  Let me just tell him, call in now.
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:12.621]  Because I've been seeing rumblings of this.
[02:09:15.538 --> 02:09:22.383]  This is what the Pentagon's talking about as the stage crisis, and it turns out it's on mainstream news in China.
[02:09:22.383 --> 02:09:23.864]  Paul Watson will call in now.
[02:09:23.864 --> 02:09:27.647]  Sorry to do this to you, Bob, but let me get your take on this now.
[02:09:27.647 --> 02:09:35.353]  Colin Powell, Biden, the British Prime Minister, German Chancellor, they've all been saying a huge crisis is coming.
[02:09:35.353 --> 02:09:38.115]  We have to do it the 21st and 22nd, 23rd.
[02:09:38.115 --> 02:09:43.859]  It's going to make Obama very unpopular, but it has to be done.
[02:09:45.103 --> 02:09:47.604]  And most of the experts are hinting and saying it's military.
[02:09:47.604 --> 02:09:49.405]  Chertoff is saying it.
[02:09:49.405 --> 02:09:58.250]  We already saw them launch through their proxy a sneak attack two months ago, a month and a half ago on 888 against Russian forces.
[02:09:58.250 --> 02:10:00.271]  I mean, they're openly stealing all the money in front of us.
[02:10:00.271 --> 02:10:04.573]  They're openly sneak attacking Russia and then telling us Russia snuck attack on CNN.
[02:10:04.573 --> 02:10:05.453]  What's next, Bob?
[02:10:05.453 --> 02:10:06.974]  You were in military intelligence.
[02:10:06.974 --> 02:10:08.054]  What are we dealing with?
[02:10:08.054 --> 02:10:08.995]  Complete psychos?
[02:10:10.561 --> 02:10:15.125]  Well, if you remember about a month ago with Paul Craig Robbins, we were on together.
[02:10:15.125 --> 02:10:19.768]  He spent five minutes telling us how insane these people were.
[02:10:19.768 --> 02:10:21.870]  And he was there in the inside.
[02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:23.531]  He knows these people.
[02:10:23.531 --> 02:10:28.936]  And so I'd go with him knowing, you know, he certainly knows what's going on inside.
[02:10:28.936 --> 02:10:33.619]  Well, we saw this a lot with Roman Emperors, Aztec Kings, countless others.
[02:10:33.619 --> 02:10:37.803]  Every two or three of them, you'd get just a, usually they were despots, but you'd get complete lunatics.
[02:10:38.843 --> 02:10:45.729]  And who just love death, destruction, war, trying to destroy themselves, and I think that's what we've got going on, is just megalomania.
[02:10:45.729 --> 02:10:54.036]  I mean, openly, trillions missing from the Pentagon, gobbling up trillions, stealing everything, I mean, just... What are they doing, Bob?
[02:10:54.036 --> 02:11:07.627]  They're doing exactly what you're saying they're doing, and you say to yourself, how do we stop it, when you have a Congress that goes along with the program, because they're all well paid off, or they're compromised.
[02:11:08.602 --> 02:11:11.263]  And so I don't know.
[02:11:11.263 --> 02:11:23.609]  We can try to change Congress by getting rid of the incumbents, with the exception of a handful, including Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich, who stands up against these people.
[02:11:23.609 --> 02:11:32.953]  But other than that, if that doesn't work, there's only one thing left to save our Republic.
[02:11:32.953 --> 02:11:35.414]  Well, Bob,
[02:11:40.259 --> 02:11:45.080]  The Syrians were reaching out to Israel wanting to sign a peace and energy deal.
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:50.841]  I mean, who wouldn't want to trade with Israel, the richest country out there?
[02:11:50.841 --> 02:11:53.862]  And they're about to sign the peace deal yesterday.
[02:11:53.862 --> 02:12:00.443]  So two days before that, a sneak attack crossed their border, landing in a village and shooting a bunch of people, including children.
[02:12:02.037 --> 02:12:09.599]  And then this stupid statement about, oh, it was the number 10 in Al-Qaeda or something, when they admittedly have Al-Qaeda attacking the Iranians.
[02:12:09.599 --> 02:12:13.280]  And the Iranians sit there and take all these staged attacks.
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:18.582]  I mean, clearly they're trying to escalate crises.
[02:12:18.582 --> 02:12:22.823]  And that's to becloud the financial and economic issues.
[02:12:24.522 --> 02:12:31.207]  They get people thinking about something someplace else while they go in and do what they want with taxpayer money.
[02:12:31.207 --> 02:12:34.869]  And not only in the United States, but virtually throughout the world.
[02:12:34.869 --> 02:12:38.052]  And they steal everything in sight.
[02:12:38.052 --> 02:12:40.974]  This is a major move to a dictatorial power.
[02:12:40.974 --> 02:12:44.897]  Alright, Bob, you're with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:12:44.897 --> 02:12:46.298]  I want to bring up Paul Watson.
[02:12:46.298 --> 02:12:50.781]  And he's a great asset to our organization, his brother.
[02:12:51.474 --> 02:12:52.134]  Hello Alex, good to be on.
[02:13:16.886 --> 02:13:31.871]  Yeah, obviously you know my girlfriend's Chinese and she sometimes does translations from Chinese media because there's a ton of information that comes out in Chinese media which just never makes it into English language media.
[02:13:31.871 --> 02:13:39.533]  And the reports are, and this is in the top Chinese mainstream news outlet which is Sohu.com,
[02:13:40.899 --> 02:13:47.961]  And they cite French media news sources, and there's an intense debate about this in China right now.
[02:13:47.961 --> 02:14:07.485]  And the story is that the Rand Corporation recently presented a proposal to the Pentagon in which it lobbied for a war to be started with a major foreign power in an attempt to stimulate the American economy and prevent a recession.
[02:14:08.727 --> 02:14:17.650]  Basically, people in China are freaking out about this because they're saying that it's likely that it's either going to be China or Russia.
[02:14:27.352 --> 02:14:27.812]  It's all there.
[02:14:27.812 --> 02:14:29.173]  They're trying to defend themselves.
[02:14:29.173 --> 02:14:30.473]  And as you said earlier, the madmen are in Washington.
[02:14:55.217 --> 02:14:59.139]  And, you know, Russia and China, they just want a better life.
[02:14:59.139 --> 02:15:05.203]  You know, there are basic disagreements politically and economically.
[02:15:05.203 --> 02:15:11.627]  But the moving force is in Washington, and in Europe for that matter.
[02:15:11.627 --> 02:15:15.049]  And they're just crazy!
[02:15:15.049 --> 02:15:17.350]  What they are is mad dog evil.
[02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:18.490]  Paul, give us more details.
[02:15:18.490 --> 02:15:20.952]  How long until a story is on PrisonPlanet.com?
[02:15:22.054 --> 02:15:25.697]  The story's being written, so it'll be up right after I get off air.
[02:15:25.697 --> 02:15:32.422]  But to flesh it out a bit, basically, most people will know who the RAND Corporation are.
[02:15:32.422 --> 02:15:39.408]  It's basically an NGO, a non-governmental organization, think tank, with deep ties to the U.S.
[02:15:39.408 --> 02:15:40.609]  military-industrial conflict.
[02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:46.113]  Yeah, there's high levels of the CFR interlocked, and basically everything they recommend is policy.
[02:15:46.113 --> 02:15:50.517]  This is the kingpin think tank for IBM, the Defense Department, for everybody.
[02:15:51.445 --> 02:15:59.190]  Right, and it's got interlocking trustee connections with the Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations as well.
[02:15:59.190 --> 02:16:10.618]  Now, one of the top directors of RAND at the moment is Frank Charles Carlucci III, who is the Foreign Defense Secretary and the former Deputy Director of the CIA.
[02:16:11.898 --> 02:16:25.207]  And some of your listeners will remember the fact that he was also chairman of the Carlisle Group from 1989 to 2005, which of course covered 9-11 and its aftermath.
[02:16:25.207 --> 02:16:36.054]  And let's explain that they are the ones that lowered defense stocks saying it was all over after the Gulf War in 1991, then literally bought up the majority of them, and what did the London Guardian report?
[02:16:36.054 --> 02:16:39.977]  Queen of England, bin Laden family in the bushes are the chief holders of Carlisle.
[02:16:41.042 --> 02:16:46.108]  Exactly, and after 9-11, after the invasion of Afghanistan, their stock went through the roof.
[02:16:46.108 --> 02:16:56.600]  So apparently now Rand and the Carlyle Group are not amused at the fact that the stock market is crashing and they want a new war to reinvigorate it.
[02:16:58.156 --> 02:17:02.340]  I mean, that's evil enough, but why can't they pick Venezuela or something?
[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:04.442]  Why does it have to be Russia and China?
[02:17:04.442 --> 02:17:19.314]  This is the thing, Alex, because the proposal directly states and stresses the fact that this new war that they want cannot be with a smaller country on the scale of Afghanistan or Iraq.
[02:17:19.314 --> 02:17:22.897]  In fact, with the analysis that the Chinese media are doing,
[02:17:23.633 --> 02:17:34.141]  They entertain the possibility that it could be North Korea, but it was ruled out because Rand wants something bigger, a bigger scale than an attack on North Korea would be.
[02:17:34.141 --> 02:17:35.862]  Just bastards.
[02:17:35.862 --> 02:17:40.265]  So they want a major war with an influential world power.
[02:17:40.265 --> 02:17:40.945]  Mad men!
[02:17:40.945 --> 02:17:43.407]  I mean, what does it ever end?
[02:17:43.407 --> 02:17:45.188]  They're publicly stealing all the money.
[02:17:45.188 --> 02:17:47.730]  They're trying to start World War III.
[02:17:47.730 --> 02:17:50.612]  They snuck attack Russia a month and a half ago.
[02:17:50.612 --> 02:17:53.054]  Bob Chapman, I mean, I can't stay calm anymore.
[02:17:55.049 --> 02:17:57.373]  Well, when you're as old as I am, you'll learn to.
[02:17:57.373 --> 02:18:01.038]  But anyway, it is that bad.
[02:18:01.038 --> 02:18:08.029]  And I think, you know, there's a number of reasons for this major war, which the gentleman has just said.
[02:18:10.539 --> 02:18:14.061]  And, uh, but, you know, there's other aspects to this.
[02:18:14.061 --> 02:18:22.326]  There's a great profit-making power, uh, by financing the war from behind the scenes, the, uh, the industrial complex.
[02:18:22.326 --> 02:18:25.909]  And then there is a very, another very important factor.
[02:18:25.909 --> 02:18:39.177]  If we're having a depression, which there's a good possibility that we will, uh, this will take many people off of the streets, and it will put those people into the battlefield, and many, many of them
[02:18:40.169 --> 02:18:41.552]  We'll get killed.
[02:18:41.552 --> 02:18:47.464]  And it will unify the American people during the implosion of the economy going into the New World Order.
[02:18:47.464 --> 02:18:48.285]  It'll be shut up.
[02:18:48.285 --> 02:18:48.806]  We're in a war.
[02:18:51.142 --> 02:18:55.727]  You know, this is part of the culling process here as well.
[02:18:55.727 --> 02:19:09.521]  They want to wipe out as many people in the world as they can, and this is part of that process, like we saw in the wars since the turn of the century, World War I, World War II, and any other intermediate wars, we'll call them.
[02:19:09.521 --> 02:19:10.963]  And that's part of this as well.
[02:19:12.777 --> 02:19:13.918]  All right, Bob Chapman, stay there.
[02:19:13.918 --> 02:19:21.223]  Paul, when we get back, I'm going to give you the floor for the quick segment to read over the details uninterrupted, those key points you made and any others.
[02:19:21.223 --> 02:19:24.506]  This is mainstream, biggest papers in China.
[02:19:24.506 --> 02:19:26.067]  It's in France.
[02:19:26.067 --> 02:19:29.710]  But of course, here in the English-speaking world, none of us even know what's going on.
[02:19:29.710 --> 02:19:36.415]  People are sucking their thumbs and stumbling around, twirling helicopter blades on top of their hats.
[02:19:37.415 --> 02:19:39.117]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:19:39.117 --> 02:19:40.859]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:19:40.859 --> 02:19:48.667]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[02:20:37.370 --> 02:20:44.139]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:20:44.139 --> 02:20:46.762]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:20:46.762 --> 02:20:48.324]  But who is the enemy?
[02:20:48.324 --> 02:20:49.125]  Bin Laden.
[02:20:49.125 --> 02:20:50.086]  This is his MO.
[02:20:50.086 --> 02:20:51.508]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:20:51.508 --> 02:20:52.910]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:20:53.470 --> 02:21:00.614]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:00.614 --> 02:21:01.094]  Some U.S.
[02:21:01.094 --> 02:21:07.457]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:07.457 --> 02:21:10.958]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:10.958 --> 02:21:21.163]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[02:22:37.403 --> 02:22:40.745]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[02:22:40.745 --> 02:22:48.490]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[02:22:48.490 --> 02:22:56.314]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[02:22:56.314 --> 02:23:02.598]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[02:23:03.239 --> 02:23:06.648]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[02:23:11.374 --> 02:23:11.834]  I think so.
[02:23:47.705 --> 02:23:55.531]  Alex, the basic details of this Chinese mainstream media as well as French mainstream media but no English language media whatsoever are reporting that the RAND Corporation
[02:24:16.084 --> 02:24:42.652]  ...has presented a proposal to the Pentagon, which basically asks that the $700 billion that has been earmarked for the bailout, and we know that number's anything up to $5 trillion or more, instead be used to finance a new war against a major foreign power, under the pretext that that would reinvigorate the stock market and the economy.
[02:24:43.539 --> 02:24:50.284]  Now the targets of that new war are Russia and China.
[02:24:50.284 --> 02:24:55.408]  Also mentioned was Iran and another Middle Eastern country.
[02:24:55.408 --> 02:25:02.513]  And even Japan was mentioned as a possibility for the reason that Japan holds the most U.S.
[02:25:02.513 --> 02:25:02.773]  debt.
[02:25:06.036 --> 02:25:29.501]  Rand is lobbying the Pentagon to attack Russia or China but they stressed in the proposal that the war could not be against a small country like Afghanistan or Iraq and in fact the analysts for the Chinese media said that North Korea could have been a target but ruled it out because the proposal directly stresses that it has to be a
[02:25:30.302 --> 02:25:33.403]  a large influential foreign power.
[02:25:33.403 --> 02:25:37.224]  Now, Paul, be sure and make the point that Rand is at the highest level of decision-making.
[02:25:37.224 --> 02:25:40.344]  I mean, they are the most important think tank.
[02:25:40.344 --> 02:25:50.147]  The executive action, militarily, they're the ones that commissioned 20 years ago, at least, to have MIT come up with what they call the control grid over the American people.
[02:25:50.147 --> 02:25:54.548]  Now, last year in MIT Magazine, the face-scanning cameras, the police training us.
[02:25:54.548 --> 02:25:59.649]  Rand wrote up how to domesticate us at the airports, train us to have no rights, then do it on the streets.
[02:26:00.449 --> 02:26:04.473]  Very cold-blooded, very wicked, and most of what they propose is implemented.
[02:26:04.473 --> 02:26:06.335]  They proposed the microwave guns.
[02:26:06.335 --> 02:26:15.804]  They proposed having Delta Force and police train and the military do drills in cities 20 years ago to condition us for the future military occupation.
[02:26:15.804 --> 02:26:18.307]  And now, Bob Chapman, what concerns me most
[02:26:18.988 --> 02:26:26.414]  As we have all these world leaders saying, huge military crisis coming in the new year that will be very unpopular.
[02:26:26.414 --> 02:26:29.437]  And I guess they already snuck attack Russia through Georgia.
[02:26:29.437 --> 02:26:32.800]  Do you think they're really that out of control?
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:34.921]  I mean, that's what PNAC says.
[02:26:34.921 --> 02:26:36.863]  They say, we've got the power, why not go for it?
[02:26:36.863 --> 02:26:39.365]  I mean, just totally evil on the face of it.
[02:26:40.723 --> 02:26:51.833]  Well, I think that because of these cryptic messages from Powell, as an example, that others already know about this who are in the inner circle, so to speak.
[02:26:51.833 --> 02:26:59.600]  And I think he was trying to give a warning, like Eisenhower did at the end of his term.
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:04.425]  And I believe that they are going to do it.
[02:27:05.838 --> 02:27:07.540]  I don't see any way that I'll take that to go.
[02:27:07.540 --> 02:27:11.044]  I mean, if you look at what's going on worldwide, the U.S.
[02:27:11.044 --> 02:27:19.194]  Treasury and the Federal Reserve are, through swap agreements or loans, are supplying every government in the world with money.
[02:27:19.955 --> 02:27:21.757]  To keep them afloat.
[02:27:21.757 --> 02:27:24.359]  Some of them are bankrupt, some of them aren't.
[02:27:24.359 --> 02:27:27.642]  Some of the banks are bankrupt, some of them aren't.
[02:27:27.642 --> 02:27:34.389]  And the same thing in the financial field, whether it's in brokerage houses, investment banks or insurance companies.
[02:27:34.389 --> 02:27:39.834]  But how do you attack people who've got intercontinental ballistic supersonic missiles?
[02:27:40.737 --> 02:27:56.307]  Well, they obviously are willing to give up cities like New York and maybe even Washington and other major cities to take out Moscow and other large Russian and Shanghai, Chinese cities.
[02:27:56.307 --> 02:28:00.770]  Look, if they go after Russia, China is going to get involved.
[02:28:00.770 --> 02:28:02.891]  There's no question.
[02:28:02.891 --> 02:28:08.235]  And so it would be Russia and China against the United States and their NATO allies.
[02:28:09.102 --> 02:28:15.047]  And quite frankly, I think it's a war that we could easily lose.
[02:28:15.047 --> 02:28:27.377]  Well, yeah, I mean, the special forces are gonna, the ground troops are gonna start using theater, locals, nukes, anti-personnel nukes, and then the Chinese and Russians are just gonna pull them out.
[02:28:27.377 --> 02:28:30.460]  It'll escalate to the highest level of destruction.
[02:28:31.654 --> 02:28:35.376]  And half the people in the world could die.
[02:28:35.376 --> 02:28:43.799]  And goodness knows what's going to be left because of all the radioactivity that's going to be in what used to be major cities.
[02:28:43.799 --> 02:28:44.900]  I'll tell you what concerns me.
[02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:49.482]  I've always watched people's body language, and I've watched a lot of Russian body language by their generals.
[02:28:49.482 --> 02:28:53.323]  Their generals look completely freaked out and scared, but in a strong way.
[02:28:53.323 --> 02:28:57.405]  They go on TV and they say, we know you're encircling us with nukes, we know you're getting ready to sneak attack.
[02:28:58.186 --> 02:28:59.386]  We can pull these clips up.
[02:28:59.386 --> 02:29:00.167]  Do not do it.
[02:29:00.167 --> 02:29:02.887]  We've got special forces, basically, in your countries.
[02:29:02.887 --> 02:29:06.688]  A lot of Russians are going home now.
[02:29:06.688 --> 02:29:08.349]  A lot of Chinese are going home.
[02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:11.850]  The ten richest Jews in Israel left this year.
[02:29:11.850 --> 02:29:12.750]  Stay there, Bob Chapman.
[02:29:12.750 --> 02:29:14.571]  Stay there, Paul.
[02:29:14.571 --> 02:29:16.771]  Folks, we're not the ones saying this.
[02:29:16.771 --> 02:29:18.672]  They're the ones doing it.
[02:29:18.672 --> 02:29:22.453]  And I know you can't believe out there, in the land of milk and honey, that this could happen.
[02:29:22.453 --> 02:29:25.234]  We have psychopathic globalists running things, okay?
[02:29:25.234 --> 02:29:26.674]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:27.913 --> 02:29:31.839]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:31.839 --> 02:29:34.524]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:37.549 --> 02:29:40.630]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:46.152]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:29:46.152 --> 02:29:51.854]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:29:51.854 --> 02:29:53.355]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:29:53.355 --> 02:29:59.377]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headache,
[02:29:59.677 --> 02:30:04.518]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.

[02:30:37.569 --> 02:30:43.292]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:30:43.292 --> 02:30:44.632]  And we knew what to do.
[02:30:44.632 --> 02:30:46.614]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:30:46.614 --> 02:30:52.977]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:30:53.653 --> 02:31:02.540]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:09.625]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:31:09.625 --> 02:31:12.707]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:31:12.707 --> 02:31:18.592]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

[02:32:55.703 --> 02:32:57.108]  The place is where you...
[02:33:29.466 --> 02:33:31.868]  It wasn't an article, it was a YouTube clip.
[02:33:31.868 --> 02:33:32.928]  Give me a minute, I'll find it for you.
[02:33:58.331 --> 02:34:02.632]  Alright, I'm going to go back to Bob Chapman before you finish up and we're going to let you with more information pop back in.
[02:34:02.632 --> 02:34:07.713]  We're going to let you get out of here and finish the article and come back on later.
[02:34:07.713 --> 02:34:14.635]  But Bob, how could this elite think that they could start wars with Russia and China or sneak attack a month and a half ago?
[02:34:14.635 --> 02:34:24.237]  I mean, we've always had corruptible people running things for the last 60, 70, 80 years, but it really seems like they're divorced from reality.
[02:34:25.936 --> 02:34:34.720]  Well, we've said that over and over again, and that's the only conclusion why people would do such things.
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:41.863]  I think there's another aspect to this that most people wouldn't notice in this warfare.
[02:34:41.863 --> 02:34:49.846]  And you mentioned the situation in Georgia and South of Cynthia and the other province there.
[02:34:49.846 --> 02:34:52.287]  And yes, that was a baited
[02:34:54.377 --> 02:35:21.408]  Attempt to bring Russia into a full-blown war which didn't work At least for this side so to speak but after that we had the credit crisis Which has been going on for more than a year now, but all of a sudden money was being pulled out of Russia and the Russian stock market get beat up very very badly like China had before that and
[02:35:23.003 --> 02:35:39.028]  Russia had a cash crisis, and they had gold and foreign exchange reserves, I would say perhaps three months ago, of just under $600 billion, which is the third largest in the world.
[02:35:39.028 --> 02:35:42.870]  And the figures I get in this morning, for the weekend of October 24, was $484.7 billion.
[02:35:48.297 --> 02:36:00.212]  So, I think that the people within the Illumina structure have been, not only from the United States, but from Europe, have been waging financial war on Russia for the last few months.
[02:36:01.354 --> 02:36:03.674]  And I think that's part and parcel of this.
[02:36:03.674 --> 02:36:04.715]  Well, look at this headline.
[02:36:04.715 --> 02:36:17.377]  This morning on CNBC's Squawk Box, Jeffrey Sautt of Raymond James, a huge firm, stated that Paulson and the Illuminati of the country are responsible for the economic chaos that has been unfolding.
[02:36:17.377 --> 02:36:20.257]  He's one of the directors of that multi-billion dollar company.
[02:36:20.257 --> 02:36:22.698]  Here he is talking about the Illuminati running all this.
[02:36:22.698 --> 02:36:23.558]  Here we are.
[02:36:23.558 --> 02:36:29.499]  At least you're getting back to the point where you can start to look at fundamentals, and that's good news.
[02:36:29.499 --> 02:36:30.019]  What happened?
[02:36:31.156 --> 02:36:33.078]  I think you're in a liquidation phase.
[02:36:33.078 --> 02:36:34.860]  I think Kirsten had it exactly right.
[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:43.010]  I think there's a bunch of wrong-footed moves by Hank Paulson and the Illuminati of the country, if you will, and I think we're paying for it right now.
[02:36:44.571 --> 02:36:59.030]  I mean, and they're saying stuff like that all over TV, and all these fiction TV shows are about the evil New World Order coming over, and trying to take over, and Biden's calling for a New World Order twice yesterday.
[02:36:59.030 --> 02:37:01.353]  I mean, they're just out in the open, Bob!
[02:37:02.242 --> 02:37:16.332]  Yeah, and they know we know it, and your program and programs like yours have been responsible for the word getting to the public, and for that gentleman to have said what he said on that program was absolute dynamite.
[02:37:16.332 --> 02:37:23.937]  I mean, when Ed Griffith and Gary Allen and Alan Stang and I started back in the early 60s,
[02:37:24.938 --> 02:37:29.362]  I mean, nobody talked about the Illuminati except people who had studied it.
[02:37:29.362 --> 02:37:32.685]  Now the world knows, and that's wonderful.
[02:37:32.685 --> 02:37:35.527]  They're out in the open, we're out in the open.
[02:37:35.527 --> 02:37:36.308]  Let's go for it.
[02:37:36.308 --> 02:37:37.689]  Let's go at it.
[02:37:37.689 --> 02:37:40.972]  Well, bottom line, the New World Order always wants to keep the West down.
[02:37:40.972 --> 02:37:46.857]  Any independent Western nation not under the control of the Anglo-American Dutch system.
[02:37:46.857 --> 02:37:48.239]  So, Britain and the U.S.
[02:37:48.239 --> 02:37:50.921]  openly funded the Bolsheviks, murdered 60 million people,
[02:37:52.141 --> 02:37:53.021]  Got control of it.
[02:37:53.021 --> 02:37:54.442]  The Russians threw that off.
[02:37:54.442 --> 02:37:58.463]  And then we have this fake right-wing propaganda that, oh, they're still commies.
[02:37:58.463 --> 02:37:59.543]  They're going to get us.
[02:37:59.543 --> 02:38:02.564]  Meanwhile, you know, the government's really funding communism here.
[02:38:02.564 --> 02:38:05.004]  And now they're going after Russia as hard as they can.
[02:38:05.004 --> 02:38:06.505]  I'm not saying Russia's run by good people either.
[02:38:06.505 --> 02:38:08.385]  The point is they're nothing compared to the New World Order.
[02:38:08.385 --> 02:38:15.667]  So they're trying to start a war with them because they can't have a unipolar world with sovereign individuals.
[02:38:15.667 --> 02:38:17.928]  And it's because they hate the people of the West.
[02:38:17.928 --> 02:38:19.408]  I mean, it's bottom line.
[02:38:20.886 --> 02:38:24.247]  And they've also destroyed their own system through their greed.
[02:38:24.247 --> 02:38:26.548]  And this is not the first time that they've done it.
[02:38:26.548 --> 02:38:29.009]  They've done it over and over again.
[02:38:29.009 --> 02:38:37.313]  They've only been hoisted on their own petard, as far as I know, twice in the last thousand years, which was in 1348 and then in the early 1600s.
[02:38:37.313 --> 02:38:39.574]  Yeah, the Templars and then what else?
[02:38:39.574 --> 02:38:41.254]  They're going to hit it again this time.
[02:38:41.254 --> 02:38:44.395]  This time we're not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.
[02:38:44.395 --> 02:38:45.516]  The Templars and then what?
[02:38:45.976 --> 02:38:46.836]  What was the other one in the 60s?
[02:38:46.836 --> 02:39:01.562]  Well, it was with Templars, and then it was the collapse of the Lombard system in 1348, which that year was accompanied by the Great Plague in Europe, which wiped out half the population, and then the fall of the Hanseatic League in the early 1600s in Europe.
[02:39:01.562 --> 02:39:06.504]  And that was out of... Germany.
[02:39:06.504 --> 02:39:10.486]  Germany and Italy, yeah, with the Hanseatic Knights.
[02:39:10.486 --> 02:39:12.647]  So, they've gotten away with it.
[02:39:13.613 --> 02:39:17.779]  In both instances, many of the people were exiled.
[02:39:17.779 --> 02:39:20.243]  There is no exile for them this time.
[02:39:20.243 --> 02:39:23.828]  They either take all of us out, or we take them out.
[02:39:23.828 --> 02:39:25.090]  That's the only way it's going to be.
[02:39:28.087 --> 02:39:33.112]  Alright, Paul Watts is going to be back the last 20 minutes of the show after his big article at PrisonPlanet.com was posted.
[02:39:33.112 --> 02:39:37.637]  And we're so conditioned to accept evil now that... Oh, the Wren Corporation!
[02:39:37.637 --> 02:39:38.999]  It's just big international news.
[02:39:38.999 --> 02:39:39.920]  No one knows in the U.S.
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:40.340]  or England.
[02:39:40.340 --> 02:39:43.103]  We're over here in our little bubble cocoon.
[02:39:43.103 --> 02:39:45.185]  Oh, it's all over the major papers that they know the U.S.
[02:39:45.185 --> 02:39:46.727]  is planning to sneak attack them.
[02:39:46.727 --> 02:39:47.628]  But it's not the U.S.
[02:39:47.628 --> 02:39:48.589]  It's this criminal group.
[02:39:49.252 --> 02:39:53.996]  And they've got all their deep underground bases and the rest of it have been building for 50 years, God help us.
[02:39:53.996 --> 02:39:57.359]  Paul, run through those facts one more time and some other caveats you didn't add.
[02:39:57.359 --> 02:40:07.727]  You know, the good news is, uh, Mike, you're putting in the article, you mentioned him during the break to make sure and point out, Fox Fallon, they ordered him to attack Iran, he said no.
[02:40:07.727 --> 02:40:11.230]  They had two previous commanders of CENTCOM say no.
[02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:16.114]  And so the good news is, even their, and he was a CFR New World Order guy, they're still not suicidal.
[02:40:16.707 --> 02:40:17.828]  They're still not.
[02:40:17.828 --> 02:40:19.509]  They'll start World War III.
[02:40:19.509 --> 02:40:21.811]  So, Paul?
[02:40:21.811 --> 02:40:23.052]  Yeah.
[02:40:23.052 --> 02:40:42.147]  On February 25th, 2007, the London Times reported that up to five generals and admirals would quit if Bush ordered an attack on Iran, and then a couple weeks later in March, Fallon quit because he disagreed with the policy on Iran.
[02:40:42.147 --> 02:40:45.690]  They tried to veil it, and they said, oh, it's not because we're planning to attack them, no.
[02:40:46.778 --> 02:40:57.460]  But you had these five generals or more that were going to quit if it happened, and then the antagonism towards Iran kind of subsided a little after that.
[02:40:57.460 --> 02:41:11.703]  So that's the hope that, you know, Randa proposing this new war to the Pentagon, but there are good people inside the Pentagon that will stand up against it, and that's what rides in our favor.
[02:41:11.703 --> 02:41:14.624]  Well, forget even good people, Bob.
[02:41:14.624 --> 02:41:15.924]  I mean, what about sanity?
[02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:18.331]  I mean, these people already own the world.
[02:41:18.331 --> 02:41:23.452]  Why do they have to run around and start World War III?
[02:41:23.452 --> 02:41:27.994]  They know better what is good for us than we do.
[02:41:27.994 --> 02:41:34.296]  And so, they must be the imperial leaders in the future, and we must be their slaves.
[02:41:34.296 --> 02:41:41.478]  And that's really what it boils down to in the final analysis, because most of them have far more wealth than they could ever spend in a hundred lifetimes.
[02:41:42.395 --> 02:41:49.158]  And so it's really power and shaping the world the way that they want it to be shaped.
[02:41:49.158 --> 02:41:52.839]  And us taking our place in their future world.
[02:41:52.839 --> 02:42:09.126]  I mean, goodness gracious, we've seen so many books and expostulations on the subject in the last hundred years of people who are connected to these secret societies and they've cried out and said what they want to do and they're going for it.
[02:42:09.126 --> 02:42:10.467]  This is the last time for them.
[02:42:11.204 --> 02:42:14.566]  And if they don't subject us this time, they know it's all over.
[02:42:14.566 --> 02:42:18.849]  Because there's too many people like us out there who are not going to let them do it again.
[02:42:18.849 --> 02:42:22.711]  Well, that's another thing.
[02:42:22.711 --> 02:42:27.474]  Everybody keeps misinterpreting what I'm saying and what history shows when our guests are saying.
[02:42:27.474 --> 02:42:31.797]  We're not saying next week or next month troops are going to come to your door and say, come to the FEMA camp.
[02:42:31.797 --> 02:42:32.998]  They're going to shut the power off.
[02:42:32.998 --> 02:42:34.799]  They're going to shut the water off.
[02:42:34.799 --> 02:42:37.761]  The troops are going to see people on the news begging them to come in.
[02:42:38.357 --> 02:42:53.569]  Then there's going to be staged insurgencies and real violence and then the troops are going to have to fight for their lives against the American people and then that will be on the news and set the precedent and then international forces six months, a year, two years!
[02:42:53.569 --> 02:42:57.932]  And this has all been drawn out by these Rand bastards and even the stuff that's declassified.
[02:42:58.735 --> 02:43:04.845]  And I mean, they say, what cold-bloodedly dominates for Wall Street and the far and backs?
[02:43:04.845 --> 02:43:08.691]  I mean, Thomas Barnett, the head of the Naval War College, he openly says it's on C-SPAN.
[02:43:08.691 --> 02:43:10.033]  They work for offshore money.
[02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:15.805]  You are seen literally as like a gallon of oil on the ground, a barrel of oil.
[02:43:15.805 --> 02:43:18.167]  You are seen as a human resource.
[02:43:18.167 --> 02:43:20.028]  They are all about the cold-bloodedness of it.
[02:43:20.028 --> 02:43:22.590]  I think they're higher than us because they're cold-blooded.
[02:43:22.590 --> 02:43:29.637]  And as the PNAC documents say, we got the power, we got the nukes, we got the space-based weapons, we got the particle beams, a lot of other secret stuff.
[02:43:29.637 --> 02:43:31.138]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[02:43:31.138 --> 02:43:33.460]  And they say we're gonna impoverish our people.
[02:43:34.170 --> 02:43:35.970]  We're going to attack other nations.
[02:43:35.970 --> 02:43:37.971]  We're going to sterilize people.
[02:43:37.971 --> 02:43:39.751]  We're going to put poison in the water.
[02:43:39.751 --> 02:43:41.092]  We're going to do it.
[02:43:41.092 --> 02:43:43.972]  Because we're dominant and that's the way it is.
[02:43:43.972 --> 02:43:47.233]  And they're going to set it up where you beg for it, folks.
[02:43:47.233 --> 02:43:48.313]  Where you beg for it.
[02:43:48.313 --> 02:43:50.274]  Bob Chapman.
[02:43:50.274 --> 02:43:51.474]  I agree with everything you said.
[02:43:51.474 --> 02:43:53.475]  You really covered it.
[02:43:53.475 --> 02:43:55.755]  You know, in total.
[02:43:55.755 --> 02:43:57.596]  I mean, this is the direction it's going in.
[02:43:57.596 --> 02:43:59.356]  This is their mindset.
[02:43:59.356 --> 02:44:01.396]  This is their goal.
[02:44:01.396 --> 02:44:03.297]  You've set it just the way it is.
[02:44:05.984 --> 02:44:07.345]  You know, that's why I'm not even angry.
[02:44:07.345 --> 02:44:11.127]  I don't even feel defeated by the corrupt cops and CIA and FBI.
[02:44:11.127 --> 02:44:15.229]  They all think they're winners and ha ha ha, we get to taser and kill whoever we want.
[02:44:15.229 --> 02:44:17.450]  You're not going to win nothing, Jack.
[02:44:17.450 --> 02:44:18.110]  You understand?
[02:44:18.110 --> 02:44:21.252]  Bob, explain to them what's in store for them.
[02:44:21.252 --> 02:44:24.474]  Well, I think in America, it'll come in stages.
[02:44:24.474 --> 02:44:26.655]  And you've just explained some of them.
[02:44:26.655 --> 02:44:30.797]  And Americans are different than other people.
[02:44:30.797 --> 02:44:34.979]  It's probably because of the evolution of their culture since the revolution.
[02:44:35.772 --> 02:44:48.357]  And as unconcerned as they seem now, as sheeple-like as they seem now, there's always been that strain within their culture.
[02:44:48.357 --> 02:44:51.779]  When they have been attacked, they become ferocious and vicious animals.
[02:44:52.734 --> 02:44:54.194]  And I think you're going to see that again.
[02:44:54.194 --> 02:45:00.896]  And I think that our opposition knows that, and they know it's going to be a long, hard fight.
[02:45:00.896 --> 02:45:05.178]  And they think they're going to win, and we think we're going to win.
[02:45:05.178 --> 02:45:11.960]  But the people will rise up to it, and they will participate, because they won't have any other choice.
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:14.581]  And it's just who's going to win.
[02:45:14.581 --> 02:45:15.881]  And I think we will.
[02:45:17.083 --> 02:45:24.146]  But my whole point is, the police and military and government people, whether they know it or not, they're really in the same boat as us.
[02:45:24.146 --> 02:45:32.789]  And that's what's so sick about this trick of the New World Order, is they always play one phase off against the next, when it's really a war against all of us.
[02:45:32.789 --> 02:45:36.370]  Right, and you know, they get their paycheck.
[02:45:36.370 --> 02:45:40.432]  And that has a lot to do with the way they act, up to a certain point.
[02:45:41.448 --> 02:45:48.471]  And, you know, I've talked to generals who say, you know, 90% of the military will not shoot their own people.
[02:45:48.471 --> 02:45:53.033]  And if the other 10% do, the other 90% will shoot them.
[02:45:53.033 --> 02:46:00.295]  And so the same applies to law enforcement through public employees.
[02:46:00.295 --> 02:46:02.556]  They're just not going to do that in America.
[02:46:02.556 --> 02:46:04.237]  Maybe in some countries they might.
[02:46:04.861 --> 02:46:06.862]  But they're not going to do it in America.
[02:46:06.862 --> 02:46:10.764]  And it's where I think they're missing the boat in that they're bringing foreign troops.
[02:46:10.764 --> 02:46:13.625]  It is the worst conceivable thing that they can do.
[02:46:13.625 --> 02:46:17.567]  Yeah, remember, we were the kooks, the weirdos, warning of that when we had the documents and sources.
[02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:20.589]  Now it's, yeah, we're hiring felons, foreigners, foreign felons.
[02:46:20.589 --> 02:46:22.549]  Yeah, yeah, we're doing it.
[02:46:22.549 --> 02:46:25.151]  Just all over the news.
[02:46:25.151 --> 02:46:29.213]  Well, there's just too many weapons in America.
[02:46:29.213 --> 02:46:30.773]  And they're not going to get a hold of them.
[02:46:30.773 --> 02:46:31.774]  Paul Watson, you still there?
[02:46:32.631 --> 02:46:33.031]  Yeah.
[02:46:33.031 --> 02:46:34.272]  You're going to be back the last 20 minutes.
[02:46:34.272 --> 02:46:35.692]  I want you to be able to write the article.
[02:46:35.692 --> 02:46:36.613]  Anything else you didn't add?
[02:46:36.613 --> 02:46:37.673]  I can read it now if you want.
[02:46:37.673 --> 02:46:38.553]  It's finished.
[02:46:38.553 --> 02:46:39.194]  It's posted.
[02:46:39.194 --> 02:46:42.095]  Oh, so you've been sitting there while I've been talking.
[02:46:42.095 --> 02:46:44.576]  Yeah, go ahead and cover it quickly.
[02:46:44.576 --> 02:46:45.336]  Okay.
[02:46:45.336 --> 02:46:47.037]  Rand lobbies Pentagon.
[02:46:47.037 --> 02:46:48.877]  Start war to save U.S.
[02:46:48.877 --> 02:46:50.418]  economy.
[02:46:50.418 --> 02:46:53.299]  According to reports out of top Chinese mainstream news outlets... Hold on.
[02:46:53.299 --> 02:46:54.279]  I would add world war.
[02:46:54.279 --> 02:46:55.360]  Start world war.
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:57.421]  Well, I guess it just says war.
[02:46:57.421 --> 02:46:57.721]  I'm sorry.
[02:46:57.721 --> 02:46:58.021]  Go ahead.
[02:46:58.021 --> 02:46:58.341]  Start over.
[02:46:59.196 --> 02:47:16.063]  According to reports out of top Chinese mainstream news outlets, the Rand Corporation recently presented a shocking proposal to the Pentagon in which it lobbied for a war to be started with a major foreign power in an attempt to stimulate the American economy and prevent a recession.
[02:47:16.063 --> 02:47:26.327]  A fierce debate has now ensued in China about who that foreign power may be, with China itself as well as Russia and even Japan suspected to be the targets of aggression.
[02:47:27.108 --> 02:47:44.504]  The report cite French media news sources as having uncovered the proposal in which Rand suggested that the $700 billion that has been earmarked to bail out Wall Street and failing banks instead be used to finance a new war which would in turn reinvigorate the flagging stock markets.
[02:47:45.282 --> 02:47:50.185]  The RAND Corporation is a notoriously powerful NGO with deep ties to the U.S.
[02:47:50.185 --> 02:47:57.670]  military-industrial complex, as well as interlocking connections with the Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie Foundations.
[02:47:57.670 --> 02:48:15.042]  Current directors of RAND include Frank Charles Carlucci III, former Defense Secretary and Deputy Director of the CIA, Ronald L. Olson, Counsel on Foreign Relations, Luminary, and former Secretary of Labor, and Karl Bildt, top Bilderberg member and former Swedish Prime Minister.
[02:48:15.822 --> 02:48:16.182]  I think so.
[02:48:34.890 --> 02:48:49.513]  Reportedly, the RAND proposal brazenly urged that a new war could be launched to benefit the economy, but stressed that the target country would have to be a major influential power and not a smaller country on the scale of Afghanistan or Iraq.
[02:48:49.513 --> 02:48:58.354]  The reports have prompted a surge of public debate and tension in China about the possibility that a new global conflict is on the horizon.
[02:48:58.354 --> 02:49:02.415]  China's biggest media outlet, Sohu.com, that's S-O-H-U.com,
[02:49:04.335 --> 02:49:13.638]  Speculated that the target of the new war would probably be Russia or China, but that it could also be Iran or another Middle Eastern country.
[02:49:13.638 --> 02:49:19.141]  Japan was also mentioned as a potential target for the reason that Japan holds the most U.S.
[02:49:19.141 --> 02:49:20.421]  debt.
[02:49:20.421 --> 02:49:28.124]  North Korea was considered as a target but ruled out because the scale of such a war would not be large enough for random requirements.
[02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:44.561]  The reported RAND proposal dovetails with recent comments made by Joe Beden, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright and others concerning the, quote, guarantee that Barack Obama will face a major international crisis soon after taking office.
[02:49:46.082 --> 02:49:47.464]  Alright, it's good.
[02:49:47.464 --> 02:49:51.087]  I would just add specifically, Powell, name the date.
[02:49:51.087 --> 02:49:54.511]  I would add, don't forget, the sneak attack on Russia through Georgia.
[02:49:54.511 --> 02:50:03.981]  And I would just add the fact that the Pentagon said last week, no, Tuesday, they need a huge crisis.
[02:50:03.981 --> 02:50:06.243]  In fact, I think Steve wrote an article about that.
[02:50:06.243 --> 02:50:07.144]  Yeah.
[02:50:07.144 --> 02:50:07.564]  Oh, God.
[02:50:10.114 --> 02:50:14.615]  I mean, I got children, man, and I just want all the punks in government to know I don't appreciate your evil.
[02:50:14.615 --> 02:50:22.717]  I mean, it isn't enough to steal everything and to urinate all over the Constitution and Bill of Rights, but you gotta go start nuclear wars?
[02:50:22.717 --> 02:50:33.920]  I mean, you are... and to the idiot public who has not been involved, you have any idea how dangerous the world really is and how thin the veneer of civilization is?
[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:36.121]  The New World Order wants you dead!
[02:50:37.742 --> 02:50:47.406]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[02:50:47.406 --> 02:50:51.188]  Her face was every face I've ever known.
[02:50:51.188 --> 02:50:52.909]  Her face was my own face.
[02:50:53.229 --> 02:50:57.870]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a movie the government does not want you to see.
[02:50:57.870 --> 02:51:00.471]  A political thriller ripped from today's headlines.
[02:51:00.471 --> 02:51:03.632]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government chipping, and more.
[02:51:03.632 --> 02:51:06.793]  The enemy of my enemy is my ally.

[02:51:37.592 --> 02:51:44.337]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:44.337 --> 02:51:46.979]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:51:46.979 --> 02:51:48.540]  But who is the enemy?
[02:51:48.540 --> 02:51:49.341]  Bin Laden.
[02:51:49.341 --> 02:51:50.202]  This is his MO.
[02:51:50.202 --> 02:51:51.723]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:51:51.723 --> 02:51:53.304]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:51:53.684 --> 02:52:00.831]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:52:00.831 --> 02:52:01.311]  Some U.S.
[02:52:01.311 --> 02:52:07.677]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:07.677 --> 02:52:11.140]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:21.648]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:52:21.648 --> 02:52:22.889]  Fabled enemies.

[02:52:37.581 --> 02:52:41.284]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[02:52:41.284 --> 02:52:47.028]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[02:52:47.028 --> 02:52:51.352]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.

[02:53:30.984 --> 02:53:31.505]  Or call 800-387-5516.
[02:53:31.505 --> 02:53:31.705]  That's 800-387-5516.
[02:53:31.705 --> 02:53:32.705]  Free shipping included.
[02:53:32.705 --> 02:53:33.866]  I was a highwayman.
[02:53:33.866 --> 02:53:34.586]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[02:53:34.586 --> 02:53:35.767]  With sword and pistol by my side.
[02:53:54.522 --> 02:54:01.928]  It is the norm for governments to kill tens of millions of people.
[02:54:01.928 --> 02:54:07.652]  Close to 3 million Iraqis are confirmed dead in the last 18 years of liberation.
[02:54:24.974 --> 02:54:25.614]  We're good to go.
[02:54:42.062 --> 02:54:49.546]  If you think the New World Order cares about you one bit more than they care about those Iraqis, you got nothing coming.
[02:54:49.546 --> 02:54:54.929]  In fact, they feared those Iraqis because they were old world, separate from the New World Order.
[02:54:54.929 --> 02:54:58.471]  They had more respect for them than they do for you.
[02:54:58.471 --> 02:55:00.612]  You should know that.
[02:55:00.612 --> 02:55:06.095]  The New World Order feared those 60 million Russians they killed in their communist operation.
[02:55:06.095 --> 02:55:10.178]  And the 60 million Chinese peasants they killed in their operation.
[02:55:12.672 --> 02:55:13.513]  You better know that.
[02:55:13.513 --> 02:55:15.993]  You better let it sink in.
[02:55:15.993 --> 02:55:20.374]  You lived in the land of milk and honey, protected because your forefathers were mean.
[02:55:20.374 --> 02:55:23.015]  And they weren't going to let anybody boss them around.
[02:55:23.015 --> 02:55:26.416]  And they just as soon died and be a slave.
[02:55:26.416 --> 02:55:27.436]  They certainly weren't perfect.
[02:55:27.436 --> 02:55:28.476]  Most of them weren't good.
[02:55:28.476 --> 02:55:30.537]  But they were tough.
[02:55:30.537 --> 02:55:32.717]  We're a bunch of slack-jawed wimps.
[02:55:32.717 --> 02:55:34.218]  Now we're being taken.
[02:55:34.218 --> 02:55:36.438]  Taken for everything.
[02:55:36.438 --> 02:55:38.799]  It's time to get strong again.
[02:55:38.799 --> 02:55:39.899]  Acting like a little sheep.
[02:55:41.195 --> 02:55:43.937]  Brings the wolves.
[02:55:43.937 --> 02:55:49.022]  You better grow up and become a man right now.
[02:55:49.022 --> 02:55:51.364]  You better cut through all that denial.
[02:55:51.364 --> 02:55:54.066]  Your weak mind lying to you.
[02:55:54.066 --> 02:55:57.109]  That's where the coward first fails is in their mind.
[02:55:57.109 --> 02:55:58.110]  They lie to themselves.
[02:55:58.110 --> 02:56:01.212]  They rationalize.
[02:56:01.212 --> 02:56:04.535]  You and your family don't have any chance going into the future.
[02:56:04.535 --> 02:56:06.817]  If you don't wake up to the new world order.
[02:56:08.318 --> 02:56:13.945]  Paul, we'll get an update from you on this coming up at the end of the show, but incredible article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:13.945 --> 02:56:17.008]  Thank you for getting us this news out of China.
[02:56:17.008 --> 02:56:18.330]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[02:56:18.330 --> 02:56:19.291]  Alright, there he goes.
[02:56:19.291 --> 02:56:19.932]  Big news.
[02:56:19.932 --> 02:56:22.915]  Paul contacted me to get on air to bring that out.
[02:56:22.915 --> 02:56:24.577]  We were talking during the break, Bob Chavin.
[02:56:24.577 --> 02:56:25.438]  Call's coming up next hour.
[02:56:25.438 --> 02:56:28.862]  If you're here to stay with us another 30 minutes, TheInternationalForecaster.com is your powerful site.
[02:56:30.646 --> 02:56:33.387]  Well, we've got a shot here at the election and in Congress, and that is removing the incumbents.
[02:56:33.387 --> 02:56:34.468]  That's a possibility, if it were to happen.
[02:56:51.484 --> 02:56:54.065]  Other than that, I don't see anything on the horizon.
[02:56:54.065 --> 02:57:01.767]  The Illuminists control the politicians, the bureaucrats, most everything.
[02:57:01.767 --> 02:57:07.129]  There is a faction within the military, and certainly in the retired military,
[02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:12.713]  That could act and take over the United States government.
[02:57:12.713 --> 02:57:20.919]  And I think that's probably our only hope in the interim between now and perhaps the next year.
[02:57:20.919 --> 02:57:28.403]  And if that doesn't materialize, then it's going to be exactly the way Alex has said it's going to be.
[02:57:28.403 --> 02:57:32.186]  And I have for such a long time, unfortunately.
[02:57:33.038 --> 02:57:37.362]  And so, that's where it's all headed, and those are our shots.
[02:57:37.362 --> 02:57:40.645]  Otherwise, you're going to have to fight.
[02:57:40.645 --> 02:57:47.532]  Well, I want to be clear here that I am never... You know, in history, it's not good to have the military take over, but it's already done that.
[02:57:47.532 --> 02:57:51.255]  The military for the executive is controlled by foreign banks.
[02:57:51.255 --> 02:57:52.816]  We're already under NORTHCOM.
[02:57:52.816 --> 02:57:54.078]  They have taken over.
[02:57:54.078 --> 02:57:56.059]  They've just taken over the Republic.
[02:57:56.059 --> 02:57:57.461]  They're feeding it into a meat grinder.
[02:57:58.702 --> 02:58:03.244]  Um, but Congress has been threatened with the military if they don't do everything the President tells them.
[02:58:03.244 --> 02:58:06.545]  So you're right, we need the military to say no.
[02:58:06.545 --> 02:58:09.866]  Um, oh God, I can't believe we've come to this.
[02:58:09.866 --> 02:58:13.847]  I mean, these people are psychopaths, out of control, they must be stopped.
[02:58:13.847 --> 02:58:15.908]  We'll be right back, going live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:15.908 --> 02:58:18.889]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:18.889 --> 02:58:19.849]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:27.856 --> 02:58:29.277]  It is a big idea.
[02:58:29.277 --> 02:58:32.098]  A New World Order.
[02:58:32.098 --> 02:58:37.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.821]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:58:39.821 --> 02:58:42.622]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:58:42.622 --> 02:58:45.803]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:58:45.803 --> 02:58:53.126]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:58:56.115 --> 02:59:01.598]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:59:01.598 --> 02:59:05.120]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:59:05.120 --> 02:59:08.021]  Builderburg is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:59:08.021 --> 02:59:09.002]  Most people have no idea.
[02:59:09.002 --> 02:59:09.962]  They're not after money.
[02:59:09.962 --> 02:59:11.263]  They have all the money they need.
[02:59:11.263 --> 02:59:12.223]  They're after power.
[02:59:12.223 --> 02:59:13.384]  That's what they're after.

[02:59:21.688 --> 02:59:22.849]  In Game.
[02:59:22.849 --> 02:59:24.490]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:59:39.333 --> 02:59:40.694]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:59:40.694 --> 02:59:43.237]  We just went live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:43.237 --> 02:59:48.682]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:59:48.682 --> 02:59:51.565]  Paul Watson has posted an extremely important article.
[02:59:53.320 --> 02:59:54.962]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:59:54.962 --> 02:59:57.003]  It needs to go out everywhere.
[02:59:57.003 --> 03:00:00.046]  Exposure of this may have some bearing on stopping it.
[03:00:00.046 --> 03:00:05.170]  It's all over European press, French, German.
[03:00:05.170 --> 03:00:08.333]  It's all over the Chinese press.
[03:00:08.333 --> 03:00:09.534]  Very, very important.
[03:00:09.534 --> 03:00:12.096]  It's going up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:12.096 --> 03:00:16.040]  Right now, Rand Corporation, highest level of Pentagon planning.
[03:00:16.040 --> 03:00:17.841]  Wanting to start a war with China or Russia.
[03:00:19.235 --> 03:00:21.897]  Rand Lomby's Pentagon start war to save U.S.
[03:00:21.897 --> 03:00:22.817]  economy.
[03:00:22.817 --> 03:00:23.798]  A huge war.
[03:00:23.798 --> 03:00:27.099]  Bob Chapman, recap why the elite are doing this for this segment.
[03:00:27.099 --> 03:00:29.781]  We'll come back and take calls.
[03:00:29.781 --> 03:00:31.542]  Well, there's a number of reasons.
[03:00:31.542 --> 03:00:35.884]  First of all, they've broken the world financial system.
[03:00:35.884 --> 03:00:37.505]  And this isn't the first time they've done it.
[03:00:37.505 --> 03:00:40.247]  They've done it through the centuries many times.
[03:00:40.247 --> 03:00:46.410]  But this is probably one of the three most serious breakdowns in history.
[03:00:47.450 --> 03:00:52.734]  And that leaves the Depression out, which was not that bad considering.
[03:00:52.734 --> 03:00:55.997]  Of course, if you lived through it, it was.
[03:00:55.997 --> 03:01:01.661]  And being in this position, they have to create the diversion.
[03:01:01.661 --> 03:01:09.707]  The diversion would bring them more power, more wealth, and more control over the people.
[03:01:09.707 --> 03:01:12.249]  And that diversion, again, is war.
[03:01:12.249 --> 03:01:15.832]  In fact, back in the early part of this century,
[03:01:16.774 --> 03:01:19.497]  Uh, and then that's not so long ago.
[03:01:19.497 --> 03:01:27.263]  We predicted the war and invasion in Iraq and Afghanistan and the event that would trigger it.
[03:01:27.263 --> 03:01:30.505]  We didn't know what the event was, but we were pretty close in the timing.
[03:01:30.505 --> 03:01:32.447]  We were within 33 days.
[03:01:32.447 --> 03:01:38.672]  And so if you read history, you can see that they have done this over and over again.
[03:01:38.672 --> 03:01:41.054]  So it's, it's not, um,
[03:01:42.722 --> 03:01:46.083]  Anything special to be able to predict what these people are going to do.
[03:01:46.083 --> 03:01:48.583]  All you have to do is find out what they did before.
[03:01:48.583 --> 03:02:00.405]  And so, with that said, they have done Iraq and Afghanistan, and now, because their system is falling apart, they have to have a bigger and better war.
[03:02:00.405 --> 03:02:03.086]  And that's what Paul Watson was talking about.
[03:02:03.086 --> 03:02:11.427]  And one of the things I'm curious about is, how did the word leak out as to what Rand Corporation and the Illuminati was up to?
[03:02:12.737 --> 03:02:17.664]  And I'd like to see if Paul has a comment on that, or if anybody knows.
[03:02:17.664 --> 03:02:19.607]  But it had to have been leaked.
[03:02:19.607 --> 03:02:23.413]  Well, we let Paul go so he can expand the article that's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:02:23.413 --> 03:02:26.538]  Perhaps he can address that when he comes back later.
[03:02:26.538 --> 03:02:27.659]  But I'm curious.
[03:02:28.547 --> 03:02:37.134]  Well, I mean, why do we have Jeffrey Saut, the huge, you know, firm, Raymond James, on CNBC saying the Illuminati's behind all this?
[03:02:37.134 --> 03:02:39.295]  I mean... That's incredible.
[03:02:39.295 --> 03:02:43.819]  And, you know, that is such a milestone for us students.
[03:02:43.819 --> 03:02:48.182]  You know, I've read over 5,000 books on the subject in the last 50 years.
[03:02:48.182 --> 03:02:57.650]  I mean, this is a major breakthrough when someone will get on a major media platform and say, well, it's the Illuminati.
[03:02:58.587 --> 03:03:01.608]  And so everybody in America is going to start talking about it.
[03:03:01.608 --> 03:03:04.789]  And this is going to expose what these people are doing.
[03:03:04.789 --> 03:03:07.370]  Maybe it'll wake the public up.
[03:03:07.370 --> 03:03:08.831]  Let's play that statement.
[03:03:08.831 --> 03:03:10.631]  Yeah, let's play that clip for those that didn't hear it.
[03:03:10.631 --> 03:03:14.753]  The video's up on PrisonPlanet.com, but here it is.
[03:03:14.753 --> 03:03:19.735]  At least you're getting back to the point where you can start to look at fundamentals, and that's good news.
[03:03:19.735 --> 03:03:20.455]  What happened?
[03:03:21.592 --> 03:03:23.533]  I think you're in a liquidation phase.
[03:03:23.533 --> 03:03:25.314]  I think Kirsten had it exactly right.
[03:03:25.314 --> 03:03:32.037]  I think there's a bunch of wrong-footed moves by Hank Paulson and the Illuminati of the country, if you will.
[03:03:32.037 --> 03:03:37.219]  And I think we're paying for it right now.
[03:03:37.219 --> 03:03:39.000]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:39.761]  You can watch the video.
[03:03:39.761 --> 03:03:44.343]  The only thing he left out is I listened to Alex Jones.
[03:03:44.343 --> 03:03:45.143]  Well, it's true.
[03:03:45.143 --> 03:03:49.345]  I mean, there's only a handful of us on these programs who've got the guts to come out
[03:03:49.770 --> 03:03:53.231]  And they go head-to-head with these people.
[03:03:53.231 --> 03:03:56.332]  Quick definition of the Illuminati, Bob?
[03:03:56.332 --> 03:04:02.373]  A group of people who were put together a long, long time ago for their own interests of power.
[03:04:02.373 --> 03:04:07.114]  And they took over the financial system in 1207, I think the date was.
[03:04:07.114 --> 03:04:08.995]  And ever since then, they've dictated to us.
[03:04:10.097 --> 03:04:18.003]  Then they went over to England, set up their system there, then they got control of the British Empire in 1815, the U.S.
[03:04:18.003 --> 03:04:21.726]  in 1913, and they are a murderous lot.
[03:04:21.726 --> 03:04:23.448]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[03:04:23.448 --> 03:04:26.050]  Back after this quick break for your phone calls.
[03:04:26.050 --> 03:04:29.753]  Stay with us.
[03:04:29.753 --> 03:04:33.376]  You know, as a father and a husband, one of the enjoyable things in my life... John, just I.M.
[03:04:33.376 --> 03:04:35.257]  me the callers, that's best way.
[03:04:35.257 --> 03:04:35.898]  Okay, you got it.
[03:04:36.716 --> 03:04:36.996]  I think?
[03:05:06.596 --> 03:05:07.316]  I'm the right thing.
[03:05:07.316 --> 03:05:09.738]  I got rid of a bunch of junk and toys out in the garage.
[03:05:09.738 --> 03:05:11.479]  I converted that money into food.
[03:05:11.479 --> 03:05:12.220]  That food's out there.
[03:05:12.220 --> 03:05:14.181]  I've got a two or three year supply of food in the garage.
[03:05:14.181 --> 03:05:15.422]  My family's secure.
[03:05:15.422 --> 03:05:16.743]  I don't gotta worry, okay?
[03:05:16.743 --> 03:05:19.464]  I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security.
[03:05:19.464 --> 03:05:21.005]  Call efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:21.005 --> 03:05:22.587]  That's efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:22.587 --> 03:05:22.847]  Or 1-800-409-5633.
[03:05:22.847 --> 03:05:23.067]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[03:05:23.067 --> 03:05:23.547]  Call them today.
[03:05:23.547 --> 03:05:24.168]  You'll be glad you did.
[03:05:29.804 --> 03:05:36.567]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:05:36.567 --> 03:05:39.208]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:05:39.208 --> 03:05:40.749]  But who is the enemy?
[03:05:40.749 --> 03:05:41.549]  Bin Laden.
[03:05:41.549 --> 03:05:42.410]  This is his ammo.
[03:05:42.410 --> 03:05:43.930]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:05:43.930 --> 03:05:45.911]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:05:45.911 --> 03:05:53.054]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:05:53.054 --> 03:05:53.534]  Some U.S.
[03:05:53.534 --> 03:05:59.177]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:05:59.877 --> 03:06:03.398]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:03.398 --> 03:06:13.862]  From Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:06:13.862 --> 03:06:15.082]  Fabled enemies.
[03:06:15.082 --> 03:06:22.845]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:22.845 --> 03:06:26.206]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[03:06:29.582 --> 03:06:31.463]  Lead from solder and copper pipes.
[03:06:31.463 --> 03:06:32.644]  Mercury from fish.
[03:06:32.644 --> 03:06:33.545]  Dental fillings.
[03:06:33.545 --> 03:06:34.305]  Vaccines.
[03:06:34.305 --> 03:06:35.326]  Arsenic in the water.
[03:06:35.326 --> 03:06:39.349]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:43.311]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[03:06:43.311 --> 03:06:54.859]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure, including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[03:06:54.859 --> 03:06:59.462]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potent
[03:06:59.462 --> 03:07:00.402]  Hey, did you find out?
[03:07:30.115 --> 03:07:42.099]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:42.099 --> 03:07:48.141]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls for Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:07:48.141 --> 03:07:52.062]  Jeff in Connecticut, you're on the air, welcome.
[03:07:52.062 --> 03:07:52.982]  Good to talk to you.
[03:07:52.982 --> 03:07:58.384]  I've been listening to you for three years, and thank you for getting me out of the matrix, so to speak.
[03:07:59.178 --> 03:08:01.879]  I got two questions if I can.
[03:08:01.879 --> 03:08:08.161]  One, obviously I don't trust either of the candidates, but one thing troubles me, at least in terms of Obama.
[03:08:08.161 --> 03:08:09.522]  Carolyn Kennedy.
[03:08:09.522 --> 03:08:11.543]  Obviously she knows what happened to her father.
[03:08:11.543 --> 03:08:14.544]  She stayed out of the limelight for years.
[03:08:14.544 --> 03:08:17.945]  Why all of a sudden this support of Obama?
[03:08:19.551 --> 03:08:22.372]  Well, I mean, she's a Democrat, but it doesn't matter.
[03:08:22.372 --> 03:08:29.856]  I mean, the point is that McCain is out of his mind, open border, anti-gun, pro-New World Order.
[03:08:29.856 --> 03:08:38.280]  It's just that Obama's gotten three times the globalist money and Wall Street money than McCain, so that tells me they want him.
[03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:41.722]  And the dirt on Obama, they could destroy him any time they wanted the media.
[03:08:41.722 --> 03:08:46.224]  The mainstream media always says, oh, it's no big deal, showing me the establishment is for him.
[03:08:46.224 --> 03:08:48.545]  You want to comment on the election, Bob Chapman?
[03:08:49.460 --> 03:08:53.583]  I think that from the Kennedy side it's political.
[03:08:53.583 --> 03:09:00.669]  I think that her sponsorship, if you may, is somewhat misguided.
[03:09:00.669 --> 03:09:03.131]  But, you know, that's the metal framework.
[03:09:03.131 --> 03:09:05.633]  I mean, you live in New England, you know what it's like.
[03:09:05.633 --> 03:09:07.374]  You know what politics is a lot like.
[03:09:07.374 --> 03:09:08.395]  I grew up in Boston.
[03:09:09.448 --> 03:09:15.992]  James Michael Curley was elected the mayor of Boston while he was in Danbury Federal Penitentiary.
[03:09:15.992 --> 03:09:19.233]  I mean, this is the kind of thinking that goes on.
[03:09:19.233 --> 03:09:22.335]  And of course, the Kennedys were deeply involved with him.
[03:09:22.335 --> 03:09:25.977]  And I know that from first hand, incidentally.
[03:09:25.977 --> 03:09:29.558]  And so, that would explain why she did what she did.
[03:09:29.558 --> 03:09:38.463]  I think the important thing with Obama here is, is the birth certificate issue going to be an issue before the election or after?
[03:09:39.176 --> 03:09:42.098]  And either way, it's not going to be nice.
[03:09:42.098 --> 03:09:44.360]  My second question, if you will.
[03:09:44.360 --> 03:09:52.185]  Obviously, you've been talking about the Illuminati starting back in 1207, old money, talking about the British crown.
[03:09:52.185 --> 03:09:54.166]  What exactly is the involvement of the Vatican?
[03:09:54.166 --> 03:09:59.690]  I mean, obviously, if you're talking about somebody with old, old money, you're talking about the Vatican as well.
[03:09:59.690 --> 03:10:02.652]  I don't know for certain, but I do know this.
[03:10:02.652 --> 03:10:07.135]  If they survived all those years, they had to play ball with these people.
[03:10:07.970 --> 03:10:10.111]  Certainly, absolutely.
[03:10:10.111 --> 03:10:15.172]  And so, you can take it from there.
[03:10:15.172 --> 03:10:18.953]  It's a whole different subject, and I'm really not qualified.
[03:10:18.953 --> 03:10:22.374]  I'm not a scholar on that.
[03:10:22.374 --> 03:10:26.776]  I'd personally like to leave it alone, but I have my doubts, deep doubts.
[03:10:28.728 --> 03:10:32.010]  I was brought up a Catholic.
[03:10:32.010 --> 03:10:44.037]  Well we know this, we know this, the last two pubs have called for world government, new world order, merger of all the religions and that's we know caused masses of conservative Catholics or Christian Catholics to leave.
[03:10:46.177 --> 03:11:02.023]  But at the same time, there's a whole Israeli branch, and the Israeli government, we know, funds people to go around and say it's a Catholic-only program, a Catholic-only conspiracy, and that's a way that they've tried to basically balkanize the awakening of the New World Order.
[03:11:02.023 --> 03:11:07.505]  Every major group, you know, a huge institution is New World Order, or the establishment goes and takes them down.
[03:11:07.505 --> 03:11:11.186]  You know, Iraq, countries like that, we're not even saying are run by good people.
[03:11:11.186 --> 03:11:14.147]  The point is, they're not in the New World Order, so they're taken down.
[03:11:14.787 --> 03:11:19.350]  And so, you know, so much of our energies are wasted on who's at the top of the pyramid.
[03:11:19.350 --> 03:11:21.211]  We know it's the New World Order system.
[03:11:21.211 --> 03:11:23.492]  Clearly the Vatican's involved.
[03:11:23.492 --> 03:11:40.341]  But then we also have folks who are Israeli-funded, and they've been exposed, who run around trying to stir up fights, demonizing good people in the anti-New World Order movement, way overestimating the power of the Vatican by claiming everybody but them are secret Vatican agents.
[03:11:40.341 --> 03:11:41.442]  And it's just asinine.
[03:11:41.442 --> 03:11:43.603]  And then now we've tracked it directly back to the Israeli government.
[03:11:46.246 --> 03:11:54.468]  Publishing, and she said that, I mean, she's done pieces, I mean, obviously, that the Vatican, they've had very corrupt popes and very good popes.
[03:11:54.468 --> 03:12:07.512]  As far as John Paul went, I mean, I don't know, we don't have to go into this debate, and you tell that tree by its root, I think he did far more good than bad, and I wonder, actually, if there's a battle within the Vatican as well as there's a battle within our government.
[03:12:07.512 --> 03:12:14.334]  Well, yeah, there's struggles, exactly, there's struggles on our streets, there's struggles, you know, in the cities, there's struggles between good and evil every day, and
[03:12:15.894 --> 03:12:16.595]  Everybody's life.
[03:12:16.595 --> 03:12:17.875]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:12:17.875 --> 03:12:19.737]  Listen, Carolyn Kennedy.
[03:12:19.737 --> 03:12:20.757]  I mean, who cares?
[03:12:20.757 --> 03:12:23.879]  I'm not bashing her call, but who cares about these people?
[03:12:23.879 --> 03:12:25.961]  They're all a bunch of establishment people.
[03:12:25.961 --> 03:12:28.623]  Who cares about... I mean, all of this.
[03:12:28.623 --> 03:12:31.264]  I mean, we know evil's in high places.
[03:12:31.264 --> 03:12:34.627]  I expose and oppose the New World Order policies.
[03:12:34.627 --> 03:12:37.288]  Whatever the New World Order's for, I'm against.
[03:12:37.288 --> 03:12:45.294]  And that's why we're effective here is about taking action, not breaking into a million different camps with every little weird strain of anti-New World Order.
[03:12:45.294 --> 03:12:45.734]  Bob Chapman?
[03:12:46.614 --> 03:13:12.588]  I think that's extremely important and that's bringing the left and the right together like Tony Hilder and I talked about in 1964 and we tried desperately to do that in the ensuing years and quite frankly was unsuccessful but here in the last five to ten years I have seen them come together and it used to be only conservatives were subscribers to my publication.
[03:13:12.588 --> 03:13:12.888]  Now
[03:13:13.780 --> 03:13:15.261]  It's half and half.
[03:13:15.261 --> 03:13:19.703]  Half of the people who used to be way in the left and not way in the right, they all agree with each other.
[03:13:19.703 --> 03:13:20.504]  We're all Americans.
[03:13:20.504 --> 03:13:21.964]  We've got to do this together.
[03:13:21.964 --> 03:13:23.785]  We've got to do something.
[03:13:23.785 --> 03:13:30.569]  And to heck with this political jargon and the sides that people try to pick.
[03:13:30.569 --> 03:13:32.090]  We're just after the enemy.
[03:13:32.090 --> 03:13:33.630]  This is a common enemy.
[03:13:33.630 --> 03:13:34.691]  Let's bring them down.
[03:13:35.353 --> 03:13:36.834]  Absolutely.
[03:13:36.834 --> 03:13:38.855]  Let's take another call here.
[03:13:38.855 --> 03:13:41.016]  Pull up the call list.
[03:13:41.016 --> 03:13:43.617]  Todd in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:13:43.617 --> 03:13:48.019]  Yeah, I'm calling about the bailout, and I'm a small business owner.
[03:13:48.019 --> 03:13:48.719]  Well, now we know.
[03:13:48.719 --> 03:13:50.460]  It's the cash bonus out.
[03:13:50.460 --> 03:13:55.742]  They're taking hundreds of billions of it with one division of Goldman Sachs.
[03:13:55.742 --> 03:13:59.444]  They're giving $14 billion in bonuses.
[03:13:59.444 --> 03:14:03.445]  Well, to tell you a little story that happened to me, we're a small business with under 15 employees.
[03:14:03.445 --> 03:14:04.766]  We sell durable goods.
[03:14:05.586 --> 03:14:10.607]  Our problem started mainly in May when, with good credit, we couldn't get any loans.
[03:14:10.607 --> 03:14:13.248]  We were denied by all sources, which was shocking to me.
[03:14:13.248 --> 03:14:17.109]  I couldn't understand why, but now I foresee where that came from.
[03:14:17.109 --> 03:14:24.271]  So we had to use all of our cash flow for our savings, for our cash flow and expansion of the company.
[03:14:24.271 --> 03:14:29.333]  And when the economy just kept falling down, it just kind of ruined us almost.
[03:14:29.333 --> 03:14:30.173]  We're living day-to-day now.
[03:14:30.956 --> 03:14:33.036]  And we couldn't get a loan now if we wanted to.
[03:14:33.036 --> 03:14:35.337]  I'm saying we're a small business bailout.
[03:14:35.337 --> 03:14:42.998]  Well no, that's what, listen, they said it was a bailout for the people and then they, but you notice the fine print so they can just keep it all and not even discuss it.
[03:14:42.998 --> 03:14:47.399]  And so now they're saying, you know what, we're keeping all the money personally.
[03:14:47.399 --> 03:14:50.259]  I mean, you know, the execs are saying it's ours, shut up.
[03:14:50.259 --> 03:14:52.460]  And if you don't like it, the Army's standing by.
[03:14:52.460 --> 03:14:55.180]  Well I called my local bank just yesterday.
[03:14:55.180 --> 03:14:57.721]  I've been dealing with them for oh, seven, eight years.
[03:14:57.721 --> 03:14:58.921]  I spent a lot of money in that bank.
[03:14:59.688 --> 03:15:04.430]  And I talked to some of the tellers and stuff and threw up some about this bailout that they're getting.
[03:15:04.430 --> 03:15:06.251]  They're saying, oh, we're not getting no bailout.
[03:15:06.251 --> 03:15:08.211]  I said, well, that's untrue what I've read.
[03:15:08.211 --> 03:15:10.632]  Well, the local banks aren't getting it.
[03:15:10.632 --> 03:15:18.155]  In fact, the big banks, the only thing that isn't going to bonuses to CEOs and people is buying other banks.
[03:15:18.155 --> 03:15:19.836]  And then the little banks don't have a choice.
[03:15:20.316 --> 03:15:21.457]  Financial assassination.
[03:15:21.457 --> 03:15:22.557]  That's what Bear Stearns was.
[03:15:22.557 --> 03:15:23.778]  And Lehman Brothers was so far gone
[03:15:46.338 --> 03:15:50.779]  Uh, they had messed that company up so much, they had to let it go down.
[03:15:50.779 --> 03:15:56.240]  But in that process, if you notice, the settlement on the derivatives was not announced.
[03:15:56.240 --> 03:15:59.721]  All that was said was it was done with expediency.
[03:15:59.721 --> 03:16:11.884]  That meant the government came in and put, come up with the money and lent it to the people who went naked on the derivatives and got caught offside for goodness knows how much money, and my guess is anywhere between $5 billion and $270 billion.
[03:16:14.522 --> 03:16:19.467]  And then they've got AIG, where they're stealing all the money, where they were bankrupt.
[03:16:19.467 --> 03:16:21.209]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[03:16:21.209 --> 03:16:27.394]  And this gentleman can't get a loan to expedite the performance of his business.
[03:16:27.394 --> 03:16:30.317]  Well, I wouldn't say this would be a local bank.
[03:16:30.317 --> 03:16:32.579]  I mean more a local branch of a big bank.
[03:16:32.579 --> 03:16:34.061]  I don't know if I can say the name of the bank.
[03:16:34.061 --> 03:16:35.102]  Just name it!
[03:16:35.102 --> 03:16:35.582]  SunTrust.
[03:16:35.582 --> 03:16:35.923]  Name it!
[03:16:36.761 --> 03:16:38.222]  SunTrust.
[03:16:38.222 --> 03:16:40.664]  And after speaking with tellers, they said, oh, we're not getting a bailout.
[03:16:40.664 --> 03:16:42.466]  But what I've read, that they are getting a bailout.
[03:16:42.466 --> 03:16:46.970]  And I had questioned some ridiculous fees that were on my account and said, hey, help us out here.
[03:16:47.674 --> 03:16:57.858]  Well, as I started moving up the line talking to heads up in the bank, as they had mentioned this bailout, they kind of giggled at me, almost like I had, like, who are you to have the audacity?
[03:16:57.858 --> 03:16:58.418]  No, no, no.
[03:16:58.418 --> 03:16:59.458]  I mean, that's what this is all about.
[03:16:59.458 --> 03:17:01.719]  It's about enjoying laughing at everybody.
[03:17:01.719 --> 03:17:08.101]  Yeah, and then I finally talked to the head person at that branch, which I think was a VP or something, and I had asked about it.
[03:17:08.101 --> 03:17:10.142]  I said, why don't you help the little guy out a little bit?
[03:17:10.142 --> 03:17:12.963]  Give me one-tenth of a tenth of a tenth of a tenth of a percent.
[03:17:13.973 --> 03:17:20.317]  Well, I mean, let's go further.
[03:17:20.317 --> 03:17:21.638]  They've cut interest rates again.
[03:17:21.638 --> 03:17:25.320]  They're talking about cutting them down to the lowest ever, basically zero.
[03:17:25.320 --> 03:17:27.501]  But the public's paying more in interest rates.
[03:17:27.501 --> 03:17:28.862]  Bob Chapman?
[03:17:28.862 --> 03:17:30.383]  That's the market.
[03:17:30.383 --> 03:17:31.684]  That's the free market.
[03:17:31.684 --> 03:17:35.026]  And the reason those rates are up is, particularly in U.S.
[03:17:35.026 --> 03:17:37.007]  paper, like U.S.
[03:17:37.007 --> 03:17:39.288]  treasuries and agencies.
[03:17:39.288 --> 03:17:42.130]  In fact, the agencies are now guaranteed by the government
[03:17:42.515 --> 03:17:42.716]  I think?
[03:17:56.096 --> 03:17:59.639]  They're saying, hey, we don't want them, no matter whether you guarantee them or not.
[03:17:59.639 --> 03:18:01.701]  So you've got to take that one step further.
[03:18:01.701 --> 03:18:03.602]  If they're doing that, why are they doing that?
[03:18:03.602 --> 03:18:06.504]  They're doing it because they think the United States is bankrupt.
[03:18:06.504 --> 03:18:06.745]  That's it.
[03:18:06.745 --> 03:18:08.966]  We're talking about foreigners buying U.S.
[03:18:08.966 --> 03:18:09.287]  paper.
[03:18:09.287 --> 03:18:10.487]  All right, Todd, thanks.
[03:18:10.487 --> 03:18:11.808]  Ed in South Dakota.
[03:18:11.808 --> 03:18:13.090]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[03:18:13.090 --> 03:18:13.470]  Go ahead.
[03:18:13.470 --> 03:18:14.831]  How are you guys doing today?
[03:18:14.831 --> 03:18:15.511]  Good.
[03:18:15.511 --> 03:18:15.712]  Good.
[03:18:15.712 --> 03:18:18.594]  Hey, I wanted to talk about a little bit of Fabian Society.
[03:18:19.138 --> 03:18:20.439]  You know anything about the Fabian Society?
[03:18:20.439 --> 03:18:29.286]  Yeah, the Fabian Socialists set up in the 1850s in England to gradually bring in socialism and to consolidate the wealth of the middle class into the hands of the elites.
[03:18:29.286 --> 03:18:29.706]  Exactly.
[03:18:29.706 --> 03:18:31.728]  It was a eugenicist society.
[03:18:31.728 --> 03:18:37.532]  And it was George Bernard Shaw and the Webbs and they were the moving force in the late 1800s.
[03:18:37.532 --> 03:18:44.657]  Well, you've heard about that window that they've had that disappeared where it had the two guys beaten on the earth with the anvil?
[03:18:44.657 --> 03:18:45.418]  You've heard of this window?
[03:18:46.596 --> 03:18:51.479]  No.
[03:18:51.479 --> 03:18:54.681]  I think this is the key to the whole secret here of what's going on.
[03:18:54.681 --> 03:19:03.407]  What they're going to do is shatter the world to bits because as the Carnegie Foundation and the Ford Foundation said, war is the best way to remold society.
[03:19:04.237 --> 03:19:10.383]  It will shatter society to bits, break it apart, and then they can remold it nearer to their heart's desire.
[03:19:10.383 --> 03:19:22.193]  Which is a giant eugenics extermination camp, scientifically controlled, with men in black uniforms and psychiatrists slaughtering and ripping human souls to pieces in a giant charnel house of death and destruction.
[03:19:22.193 --> 03:19:25.516]  Huge rotting piles of dead bodies, a new world or wonderland.
[03:19:25.516 --> 03:19:26.717]  I'm skipping this break.
[03:19:26.717 --> 03:19:28.659]  For the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, stay with us.
[03:19:31.849 --> 03:19:33.570]  It's normal to me.
[03:19:59.365 --> 03:20:07.087]  It's just, you know, when you have been at this for so long, you expect certain things.
[03:20:07.087 --> 03:20:12.388]  And I try not to allow that to deter my thinking.
[03:20:12.388 --> 03:20:23.211]  I'm trying to, like you are, to inform people of who is the enemy, who wants to make their life difficult or miserable or to do away with them.
[03:20:23.211 --> 03:20:28.492]  And so that message is far, far stronger than any of the things that I see, which are
[03:20:28.985 --> 03:20:30.866]  A nasty and unbearable.
[03:20:30.866 --> 03:20:41.052]  And so, you just keep on going forward, not taking no for an answer until they permanently shut you up or you win.
[03:20:41.052 --> 03:20:45.855]  And Bob, they've certainly tried to persecute you over the last 40-something years of fighting.
[03:20:45.855 --> 03:20:47.495]  Believe me.
[03:20:47.495 --> 03:20:50.857]  We could do hours of programming.
[03:20:50.857 --> 03:20:52.138]  But that's okay.
[03:20:52.138 --> 03:20:54.900]  I'm a tough guy and I know how to handle it.
[03:20:54.900 --> 03:20:57.101]  Well, I mean, you know, you're over the target when you're getting the flag.
[03:20:58.533 --> 03:20:59.594]  It's okay.
[03:20:59.594 --> 03:21:03.098]  I shoot back.
[03:21:03.098 --> 03:21:09.665]  You know, it's one thing to be intellectually aware of this, but it's another thing to see it happening.
[03:21:09.665 --> 03:21:10.526]  I keep making that point.
[03:21:10.526 --> 03:21:17.794]  I mean, here we are kind of glazing over, oh yeah, major international news, Rand lobbies Pentagon to start World War to save U.S.
[03:21:17.794 --> 03:21:19.536]  economy up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:21:20.957 --> 03:21:24.159]  You've got to say to yourself, no matter what they do, it's my job to engage
[03:21:50.706 --> 03:21:53.756]  And attack and ultimately conquer what they're doing.
[03:21:54.864 --> 03:21:55.664]  And never give up.
[03:21:55.664 --> 03:22:00.706]  If everybody had that attitude in America, we would have already been winners.
[03:22:00.706 --> 03:22:01.306]  Exactly.
[03:22:01.306 --> 03:22:08.329]  I mean, so much of war, info war, physical war, is making the enemy decide they can't win and breaking their spirit.
[03:22:08.329 --> 03:22:16.632]  If somebody won't give up, they're basically, you can't beat them, unless you were like the Romans and then just killed everybody, but that was hard too.
[03:22:16.632 --> 03:22:23.355]  And I guess that's what the population reduction is about, is they understand that, and they want to go ahead and just wipe most of us out.
[03:22:24.887 --> 03:22:28.628]  And a lot of them in the process.
[03:22:28.628 --> 03:22:33.389]  But that slips into the back of their cranium, because they don't want to know that.
[03:22:33.389 --> 03:22:38.910]  Yeah, I was interrupting you there when you were trying to make the point about, yeah, just committing fully and never stopping.
[03:22:38.910 --> 03:22:40.050]  That's right.
[03:22:40.050 --> 03:22:44.591]  And all you people out there, you've got to have the guts to do it.
[03:22:44.591 --> 03:22:51.492]  You have to have the guts when you tell people what's going on, and you get rejected, just smile and say, that's okay, I'll be back.
[03:22:51.492 --> 03:22:52.892]  And you go on to the next person.
[03:22:53.621 --> 03:22:57.384]  All you have to do is convince one out of a hundred that we're winners.
[03:22:57.384 --> 03:22:58.605]  You gotta look at it that way.
[03:22:58.605 --> 03:23:04.410]  Yeah, I mean, I remember 15 years ago going around to city events and trying to just speak to people on the street when I first really woke up.
[03:23:04.410 --> 03:23:07.873]  Then I figured out, I better get on the air, that's the way you're supposed to do this.
[03:23:07.873 --> 03:23:12.597]  But people would laugh at me and it would kind of hurt a little bit, but I was so desperate to warn them that I didn't mind it.
[03:23:12.597 --> 03:23:20.603]  Now, it actually makes me work harder and doesn't, I mean, my ego, I don't want to say it's shrunk, but it's more like I just don't care.
[03:23:20.603 --> 03:23:22.125]  It doesn't exist.
[03:23:22.685 --> 03:23:27.788]  Yeah, I mean, I'm so mission-oriented that it doesn't matter if a whole group of people are booing at me.
[03:23:27.788 --> 03:23:30.669]  I mean, I know I'm telling the truth, and that's it.
[03:23:30.669 --> 03:23:38.433]  That's right, and that's the same attitude I have, and that's why at 73 years old I'm still doing this, and I will do it until I can't do it anymore.
[03:23:38.433 --> 03:23:39.313]  They're defeated.
[03:23:39.313 --> 03:23:40.494]  Let's go back to the full audience.
[03:23:40.494 --> 03:23:42.655]  Here we go.
[03:23:42.655 --> 03:23:51.079]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
[03:23:53.280 --> 03:24:15.335]  I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it
[03:24:16.671 --> 03:24:19.213]  All the way.
[03:24:19.213 --> 03:24:23.216]  But I remember everything.
[03:24:23.216 --> 03:24:31.401]  What have I become?
[03:24:31.401 --> 03:24:36.224]  My sweetest friend.
[03:24:36.224 --> 03:24:41.348]  Everyone I know goes away.
[03:24:46.337 --> 03:24:51.659]  AJ in Maine, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[03:24:51.659 --> 03:24:54.260]  Go ahead.
[03:24:54.260 --> 03:25:01.183]  And Bob, with all your great insight there, Paul, all your hard work, I have a statement, a link, and a question.
[03:25:02.117 --> 03:25:16.603]  Uh, with all this talk of the crisis, you know, especially nuclear aspect of things, um, I really want to know what prevents any public awareness and programs to this, the same sort of preparedness that we had in the 50s and the 60s, you know, with the Cuban Missile Crisis, the duck and cover, fallout shelters, etc.
[03:25:17.523 --> 03:25:21.085]  Well, those were conditioning programs to make people think there was this big threat.
[03:25:21.085 --> 03:25:22.526]  It really didn't do any good.
[03:25:22.526 --> 03:25:34.694]  Kind of like anti-terror drills they have now is to create the illusion or SWAT teams freaking out on cardboard boxes to give us, or local police trained by the feds for IED removal.
[03:25:34.694 --> 03:25:37.136]  It's all about creating fear.
[03:25:37.136 --> 03:25:44.061]  But they've gotten rid of the civil, you know, defense groups because they don't want the image of the people being the answer or the posse.
[03:25:44.061 --> 03:25:46.242]  So they've gotten rid of that.
[03:25:46.242 --> 03:25:46.983]  But go ahead.
[03:25:47.783 --> 03:25:49.144]  Isn't that really important now?
[03:25:49.144 --> 03:25:55.186]  I heard a lot of World War III talk today on the show.
[03:25:55.186 --> 03:26:00.008]  Back then, isn't that really important to the American people nowadays to be informed?
[03:26:00.008 --> 03:26:02.309]  I expected maybe more of
[03:26:02.890 --> 03:26:06.351]  More of those type of programs after the attack on 9-11, you know?
[03:26:06.351 --> 03:26:07.772]  There's a really good link.
[03:26:07.772 --> 03:26:12.554]  No, they don't want the people involved because it's a fake attack by the people running the government.
[03:26:12.554 --> 03:26:13.414]  But let me explain.
[03:26:13.414 --> 03:26:15.495]  You didn't hear World War III talk today.
[03:26:15.495 --> 03:26:19.256]  It's in all over the major Chinese papers, all over European papers.
[03:26:19.256 --> 03:26:26.158]  Rand Corporation saying they want to start World War III with Russia or China as a pretext for global domination, basically.
[03:26:28.140 --> 03:26:30.322]  Yeah, and I'm scared, you know?
[03:26:30.322 --> 03:26:30.802]  I'm scared.
[03:26:30.802 --> 03:26:33.664]  I'm trying to tell people about this stuff, you know?
[03:26:33.664 --> 03:26:40.750]  Well, I mean, listen, our criminal government, two months ago, ran a sneak attack through Georgia on Russian troops.
[03:26:40.750 --> 03:26:46.475]  And Russia said, do it one more time, we're gonna nuke all your forces in Europe, and then if you hit us, we're gonna hit you.
[03:26:46.475 --> 03:26:51.579]  Because, you know, we've got less nukes than you, we've gotta go ahead and have a total release on you.
[03:26:52.139 --> 03:26:54.480]  You think it has anything to do with the depopulation thing?
[03:26:54.480 --> 03:26:59.082]  You know, they want... No, listen, it's like Moonraker.
[03:26:59.082 --> 03:27:01.403]  They built their underground bases.
[03:27:01.403 --> 03:27:04.944]  Bob, chime in on all this.
[03:27:04.944 --> 03:27:09.886]  Well, I'm not as up to speed as you are on these underground bases, but...
[03:27:10.818 --> 03:27:15.060]  The gentleman bringing up population control is important.
[03:27:15.060 --> 03:27:30.705]  It's part of the reason why they do what they do, having wars to do away with people and to keep economies going and for people not to keep their eye on the financial and economic problems that exist not only now in the United States but throughout the entire world.
[03:27:34.500 --> 03:27:36.120]  Well, there's a link on YouTube.
[03:27:36.120 --> 03:27:43.902]  If you search We The Altar, there's a lot of links to, you know, fallout shelters and how to prepare yourself for all this, you know, and I think it's pretty informative if you just search for that.
[03:27:43.902 --> 03:27:50.204]  So I just wanted to add that, you know, I just think it's, it's crazy that we're not preparing for that, you know?
[03:27:50.204 --> 03:27:58.886]  Well, Alex ties all this together in his broadcasts and his staff does too in their releases and we do the best we can in our limited way.
[03:27:58.886 --> 03:28:02.567]  We're kind of a two horse operation and, uh,
[03:28:03.650 --> 03:28:07.034]  And we just do what we can do.
[03:28:07.034 --> 03:28:09.436]  Thank you for all you've done.
[03:28:09.436 --> 03:28:13.180]  You give a lot of great insight, Bob, and you're pretty intelligent.
[03:28:13.180 --> 03:28:13.921]  Thanks, I just wanted to...
[03:28:14.594 --> 03:28:15.295]  To add that.
[03:28:15.295 --> 03:28:15.875]  Thank you.
[03:28:15.875 --> 03:28:16.696]  Well, thank you.
[03:28:16.696 --> 03:28:17.256]  Thank you.
[03:28:17.256 --> 03:28:32.067]  In the story up on PrisonPlanet.com about the Pentagon looking into starting World War III, there's a link here to the Air Force Times from January of this year talking about similar things.
[03:28:32.067 --> 03:28:37.151]  So, we know they've been wargaming all of this out, but this isn't a hypothetical scenario.
[03:28:37.151 --> 03:28:41.334]  They're saying, let's go ahead and start a war to maintain our power.
[03:28:43.888 --> 03:28:46.131]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[03:28:46.131 --> 03:28:49.196]  Bob, if you've got to go, I'll let you go, but I'm really enjoying taking these calls.
[03:28:49.196 --> 03:28:51.299]  You want to stay one more segment?
[03:28:51.299 --> 03:28:52.701]  Sure, I'll do it.
[03:28:52.701 --> 03:28:53.762]  Alright, folks.
[03:28:54.702 --> 03:28:55.543]  I've got another guest.
[03:28:55.543 --> 03:29:03.308]  If you can still come on, I'm going to get this local guy on who's fighting the warrantless blood-sucking checkpoints where they take your blood.
[03:29:03.308 --> 03:29:05.529]  So that's coming up, too.
[03:29:05.529 --> 03:29:06.329]  This is a big story.
[03:29:06.329 --> 03:29:08.571]  Iran lobbies Pentagon start war to save U.S.
[03:29:08.571 --> 03:29:09.592]  economy.
[03:29:09.592 --> 03:29:13.494]  Shocking proposal urges military leaders to attack major foreign power.
[03:29:13.494 --> 03:29:17.317]  PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Watson and Yihan Dai.
[03:29:17.317 --> 03:29:17.837]  Stay with us.
[03:29:19.952 --> 03:29:21.333]  We're on the march.
[03:29:21.333 --> 03:29:23.674]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:23.674 --> 03:29:26.856]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:26.856 --> 03:29:28.117]  Still going, yeah.
[03:29:28.117 --> 03:29:29.578]  Hey, Bob?
[03:29:29.578 --> 03:29:30.439]  Yes, yes, Alex.
[03:29:30.439 --> 03:29:32.980]  We're going to come back and plug your newsletter and stuff, too.
[03:29:32.980 --> 03:29:34.601]  That's okay.
[03:29:34.601 --> 03:29:37.043]  Make sure you have that toll-free number for folks who want to get a free copy.
[03:29:37.043 --> 03:29:38.304]  Yeah, I have it right in front of me.
[03:29:38.304 --> 03:29:41.586]  And, you know, Ted's always anxious about that.
[03:29:42.694 --> 03:29:46.116]  Yeah, Ted loves getting those... He gets a lot of leads from that.
[03:29:46.116 --> 03:29:46.837]  Yeah, that's great.
[03:29:46.837 --> 03:29:48.037]  That's fantastic.
[03:29:48.037 --> 03:29:49.878]  And we do too, of course.
[03:29:49.878 --> 03:29:51.500]  Yeah, well it's good to get the word out to the people.
[03:29:51.500 --> 03:29:52.680]  I notice gold's back up.
[03:29:52.680 --> 03:29:54.421]  We're still streaming over the web right now.
[03:29:54.421 --> 03:30:03.407]  Maybe for a few minutes we could, just for folks out there, talk about what's happening, Bob, with gold.
[03:30:03.407 --> 03:30:07.590]  That'd be a great idea because we really haven't touched any of that stuff today.
[03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:09.811]  We can do it briefly and it could take two or three minutes.
[03:30:10.601 --> 03:30:26.535]  And where I think things are going and the fact that, you know, we get blindsided on this downside in gold and silver and commodities and didn't realize how bad or how extended the hedge funds were at 30 to 200 to 1.
[03:30:30.151 --> 03:30:31.573]  God knows what's gonna happen.
[03:30:31.573 --> 03:30:35.239]  Yeah, and then we'll just talk to George, Fred, Ruth and Robert and let you go.
[03:30:35.239 --> 03:30:42.470]  And then, John, did you talk to that John Bush guy about getting him to pop in for the last 10 minutes?
[03:30:43.334 --> 03:30:43.854]  Yes.
[03:30:43.854 --> 03:30:45.794]  You want him on at the 50 after?
[03:30:45.794 --> 03:30:47.435]  Yeah, and I had his bio here.
[03:30:47.435 --> 03:30:48.635]  Oh, here it is.
[03:30:48.635 --> 03:30:49.555]  Yeah, for folks to get out.
[03:30:49.555 --> 03:30:54.976]  But this is nationwide, so people everywhere need to know there are federal funds to run these checkpoints to take your blood.
[03:30:54.976 --> 03:30:56.516]  So we'll cover that too when we get back.
[03:30:56.516 --> 03:31:09.719]  Again, Bob, what I'm doing with these breaks is we're not on the AM and FM short waiver satellite, but on my huge internet audience and PrisonPlanet.tv viewing audience, we skip a lot of these breaks here and just give the viewers kind of the behind the scenes as we have these discussions.
[03:31:10.599 --> 03:31:16.023]  Incidentally, we pick up a lot of your stuff and put it as links in the Corkaster.
[03:31:16.023 --> 03:31:17.504]  I've seen that, and we appreciate that.
[03:31:17.504 --> 03:31:18.264]  We appreciate that.
[03:31:18.264 --> 03:31:21.467]  Well, listen, hey, that's the least I can do.
[03:31:21.467 --> 03:31:30.493]  And, you know, I don't take them all, but the ones I really like I put in there, and of course that one that Paul's doing today will be in there.
[03:31:30.493 --> 03:31:31.773]  It's already up, right?
[03:31:31.773 --> 03:31:32.094]  Yes, sir.
[03:31:32.819 --> 03:31:35.000]  Yeah, well, Judy, my wife will pick it up.
[03:31:35.000 --> 03:31:38.102]  Randy Rand lobbies Pentagon.
[03:31:38.102 --> 03:31:39.403]  Start war to save U.S.
[03:31:39.403 --> 03:31:40.863]  economy.
[03:31:40.863 --> 03:31:44.845]  That's up on... I'd still like to know the source on that.
[03:31:44.845 --> 03:31:46.346]  How they got the information.
[03:31:46.346 --> 03:31:50.448]  You see, somebody on the inside tattled on them.
[03:31:50.448 --> 03:31:51.429]  They don't want it to happen.
[03:31:52.694 --> 03:31:53.474]  No, no, absolutely.
[03:31:53.474 --> 03:31:57.516]  That's like three months ago when Cheney wanted to have Navy SEALs stage attacks on U.S.
[03:31:57.516 --> 03:31:59.257]  ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[03:31:59.257 --> 03:32:09.242]  The White House leaked that, and that was confirmed to be, MSNBC reported on it, and so did, well, the first person to break it was Sy Hersh, Seymour Hersh.
[03:32:09.242 --> 03:32:12.564]  White House sources, we wouldn't give the source out, but you know, if Hersh is reporting it, it's accurate.
[03:32:14.065 --> 03:32:18.548]  And so what the guy said to him, or the lady, was, look, these people are nuts.
[03:32:18.548 --> 03:32:19.568]  I don't want this to happen.
[03:32:19.568 --> 03:32:20.269]  Here's the story.
[03:32:20.269 --> 03:32:21.490]  Break it and they can't do it.
[03:32:21.490 --> 03:32:30.296]  Yeah, well, it's in a bunch of European papers and French dailies are reporting it, and the Chinese national newspapers and stuff are all freaking out over it.
[03:32:30.296 --> 03:32:37.160]  Well, we'll go into the European stuff because we do Spanish, Italian, French, and German.
[03:32:37.160 --> 03:32:37.981]  Alright, here we go.
[03:32:37.981 --> 03:32:38.241]  Here we go.
[03:32:45.197 --> 03:32:57.729]  Well, we had Jesse Ventura on again today, got into a bunch of issues like martial law and things we haven't covered yet, whether or not it'll be re-airing on the internet only and on the MNFMs across the country as they re-air those, but on the web at InfoWars.com.
[03:32:57.729 --> 03:33:00.212]  The show ends here in about 27 minutes.
[03:33:00.212 --> 03:33:01.953]  I want to jam in George Fred Ruth.
[03:33:02.814 --> 03:33:04.475]  Hello Bob, thank you for your newsletter.
[03:33:04.475 --> 03:33:05.896]  I was just trying to skim through the latest one.
[03:33:05.896 --> 03:33:09.437]  I just wondered, do you have one place where you have your current recommendations?
[03:33:09.437 --> 03:33:11.638]  Yes, we have it in the newsletter once a month.
[03:33:30.413 --> 03:33:38.155]  And anything that we see changes in, we'll include it in one of the issues or have a special.
[03:33:38.155 --> 03:33:40.056]  And I haven't made many changes.
[03:33:40.056 --> 03:33:43.837]  You know, we're long gold and silver related assets.
[03:33:43.837 --> 03:33:46.758]  We're also long Swiss franc government bonds.
[03:33:46.758 --> 03:33:49.198]  And we're short a host of companies.
[03:33:49.198 --> 03:33:51.939]  In fact, I'm watching one of them right now called Goldman Sachs.
[03:33:52.423 --> 03:34:02.046]  And we recommended the short, and this is betting it's going to go down at $190, and it's trading under $100 right now, and I love it!
[03:34:02.046 --> 03:34:04.907]  You'd go short on that again at this point?
[03:34:04.907 --> 03:34:10.608]  Oh, once it goes through $86, $88 to the downside, it's gone.
[03:34:10.608 --> 03:34:13.429]  We just saw that to happen to others.
[03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:15.770]  They're in serious trouble, like everybody else is.
[03:34:16.178 --> 03:34:18.179]  They get greedy and do what they shouldn't have done.
[03:34:18.179 --> 03:34:21.380]  And that's why they want to start World War III to cover it up, or failing forward.
[03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:22.341]  Exactly, Alex.
[03:34:22.341 --> 03:34:23.321]  Exactly.
[03:34:23.321 --> 03:34:28.883]  It seems to me like the government's trying to inflate their way out by printing a bunch of money way out of their debt.
[03:34:28.883 --> 03:34:34.666]  Are you going to go short on other fixed income things like utility companies and such?
[03:34:34.666 --> 03:34:38.668]  I haven't decided that as yet, but I do think that the market is going lower.
[03:34:39.873 --> 03:34:47.101]  An election rally here, and also an opportunity to make a lot of money for the people who created this rally.
[03:34:47.101 --> 03:34:48.482]  That's what you said two weeks ago.
[03:34:48.482 --> 03:34:55.310]  You said it would run back up to 9,500, maybe even 10,000, and then it's going to race back down and maybe even bump again.
[03:34:55.310 --> 03:34:57.152]  But when are you saying it's really going to tank?
[03:34:58.884 --> 03:35:05.528]  After the election early next year, it'll get out on test 72-68 on the Dow.
[03:35:05.528 --> 03:35:08.770]  Would you get out of the market right now that it did rally up to $9,000?
[03:35:08.770 --> 03:35:10.611]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:35:10.611 --> 03:35:12.412]  General stocks, yes.
[03:35:12.412 --> 03:35:14.013]  Not gold and silver stocks.
[03:35:14.013 --> 03:35:25.599]  As a matter of fact, my favorite stock is Agnico Eagle, and I see this evening at 6 o'clock Eastern Time that Shawn Boyd from Agnico Eagle is going to be on the Mad Kramer Show.
[03:35:26.349 --> 03:35:28.211]  That should be very informative to you people.
[03:35:28.211 --> 03:35:30.472]  He's just a wonderful person.
[03:35:30.472 --> 03:35:31.173]  I gotta jump.
[03:35:31.173 --> 03:35:33.094]  George and PA, thank you.
[03:35:33.094 --> 03:35:35.796]  Fred and Philly, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[03:35:35.796 --> 03:35:41.160]  Okay, I have a question, Bob.
[03:35:41.160 --> 03:35:52.147]  The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, $639 billion bankruptcy that was declared, people lost money that were debtors.
[03:35:52.147 --> 03:35:55.650]  I don't understand how that was
[03:35:56.851 --> 03:36:05.739]  A hundred times bigger than the world, than the Enron stated figure for their bankruptcy of $6 billion.
[03:36:05.739 --> 03:36:10.063]  Okay, what they were doing was running a bookmaking operation.
[03:36:10.063 --> 03:36:12.345]  And that's really what the stock market is all about.
[03:36:12.345 --> 03:36:14.827]  I spent 28 years on Wall Street.
[03:36:14.827 --> 03:36:18.510]  And so it's a high-level bookmaking operation.
[03:36:18.510 --> 03:36:21.993]  And what they were doing is they were naked writing derivatives.
[03:36:23.124 --> 03:36:24.965]  And I can't go into what derivatives are.
[03:36:24.965 --> 03:36:28.368]  That means no money-backing and just made-up crap.
[03:36:28.368 --> 03:36:29.509]  Exactly.
[03:36:29.509 --> 03:36:31.890]  And they got caught with their pants down.
[03:36:31.890 --> 03:36:41.697]  And it swept through not only Lehman Brothers, but a host of other firms and banks and financial institutions throughout the world.
[03:36:41.697 --> 03:36:49.183]  And that's why, when they went to settle the derivatives, which was three or four weeks late, they wouldn't tell you what went on.
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:49.680]  No.
[03:36:49.680 --> 03:36:50.500]  Because the U.S.
[03:36:50.500 --> 03:36:58.202]  government stepped in and lent the money to whomever were the writers to settle the issues.
[03:36:58.202 --> 03:37:00.363]  And they're doing all this stuff behind the scenes.
[03:37:00.363 --> 03:37:02.784]  Yeah, that's why everything's blacked out.
[03:37:02.784 --> 03:37:04.944]  They're just giving each other millions of dollars.
[03:37:04.944 --> 03:37:07.625]  I mean, they're just stealing everything.
[03:37:07.625 --> 03:37:17.648]  Alex, I just want to, and Bob, I just want to say that I have, I don't have it in front of me, but I have a reference book that talks about the establishment of hedge funds as early as 1948.
[03:37:19.762 --> 03:37:20.302]  I don't know.
[03:37:32.347 --> 03:37:35.969]  And now they're going to pay it all off through hyper-inflating the currency.
[03:37:35.969 --> 03:37:40.551]  There hasn't been any move towards disclosure on what they've done.
[03:37:40.551 --> 03:37:40.971]  That's right.
[03:37:40.971 --> 03:37:48.354]  You have the real government, the real economy, guarded by men in black uniforms who do whatever the hell they want, and you've got all of us down here, the schmuck slaves.
[03:37:48.354 --> 03:37:49.935]  That's got to change.
[03:37:49.935 --> 03:37:51.475]  Ruth in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[03:37:51.475 --> 03:37:54.117]  Go ahead, Ruth.
[03:37:54.117 --> 03:37:55.417]  Yes, Alex.
[03:37:55.417 --> 03:37:57.058]  I've got a big complaint.
[03:37:57.935 --> 03:38:02.438]  For three weeks, I have not been able to hear your program.
[03:38:02.438 --> 03:38:10.243]  1-2-1-6-0 in the afternoon is just horrible.
[03:38:10.243 --> 03:38:19.190]  And then when it's repeated at night, I can occasionally hear part of it, but never all of it.
[03:38:19.190 --> 03:38:22.111]  You need to check with WWCR.
[03:38:22.111 --> 03:38:23.032]  Well, have you called them?
[03:38:23.032 --> 03:38:25.494]  I mean, look, look, those are the best frequencies they're giving us.
[03:38:26.280 --> 03:38:29.862]  I've called him a dozen times.
[03:38:29.862 --> 03:38:35.165]  And anyway, the program before you on 5070 is perfectly great.
[03:38:35.165 --> 03:38:36.306]  I know, I know.
[03:38:36.306 --> 03:38:41.809]  I can't ever get anybody on 12160.
[03:38:41.809 --> 03:38:44.991]  And they give me stupid answers.
[03:38:44.991 --> 03:38:46.272]  Where are you again?
[03:38:46.272 --> 03:38:48.673]  I'm in southeastern North Carolina.
[03:38:48.673 --> 03:38:51.875]  Well, that's also because you're so close to Tennessee, shortwave.
[03:38:51.875 --> 03:38:54.937]  No, wait a minute, through the years I've been hearing those
[03:38:55.567 --> 03:38:56.588]  I don't know why.
[03:39:09.318 --> 03:39:15.821]  The sun, in the 300 years they've been recording it, over 100 with devices, is the coolest it's ever been.
[03:39:15.821 --> 03:39:24.785]  And so those solar flares do weird things, where you might hear an AM from China sometimes over here, or you might be able to hear shortwave great somewhere and then not hear it great.
[03:39:24.785 --> 03:39:26.045]  Now, there has been jamming.
[03:39:26.045 --> 03:39:29.166]  You know, usually when our website goes down, everybody says, we've been hacked.
[03:39:29.166 --> 03:39:30.127]  Most of the time, it's not that.
[03:39:30.127 --> 03:39:31.327]  We have been hacked before.
[03:39:31.327 --> 03:39:33.408]  But nine times out of ten, it's not.
[03:39:33.408 --> 03:39:34.449]  We have.
[03:39:34.449 --> 03:39:37.490]  People have recorded it, where one show is clear, and then my show comes on and it goes
[03:39:38.030 --> 03:39:39.390]  Have you ever thought about buying a computer?
[03:39:56.898 --> 03:39:58.960]  I'm too old to bother with one.
[03:39:58.960 --> 03:40:02.022]  I'm 81 years old.
[03:40:02.022 --> 03:40:03.584]  You're a sweetheart to tune in.
[03:40:03.584 --> 03:40:11.950]  You know, we need somebody in your area to get us an Amorath affiliate, or somebody with the internet to hook it up to a micro, you know, 100 water and broadcast to the whole town.
[03:40:11.950 --> 03:40:16.234]  I mean, stuff's so bad now, the lawless government, I'm all for micro FM.
[03:40:16.234 --> 03:40:17.114]  Well, I'm too old.
[03:40:17.114 --> 03:40:20.137]  Oh, ma'am, ma'am, I have a way for you to listen every day.
[03:40:20.137 --> 03:40:21.178]  Do you have long distance?
[03:40:22.330 --> 03:40:22.970]  Oh yes.
[03:40:22.970 --> 03:40:23.931]  No, I just have a regular telephone.
[03:40:38.916 --> 03:40:39.536]  Unlimited.
[03:40:39.536 --> 03:40:41.858]  You know, Vonage is a good example.
[03:40:41.858 --> 03:40:49.684]  Yeah, and ma'am, what happens is you just call Vonage or another company, they come put it in, and then you have Unlimited and it's like $50 for the phone, okay?
[03:40:49.684 --> 03:40:51.105]  And that's just making a phone call.
[03:40:51.105 --> 03:40:54.108]  Let me give you a number, okay?
[03:40:54.108 --> 03:40:58.451]  And if you can pay to call, because we can't pay for toll-free, this cost me $2,000 a month just to do this with 180 lines.
[03:40:58.451 --> 03:40:58.511]  512-646-5000.
[03:40:58.511 --> 03:40:58.591]  512-646-5000.
[03:40:58.591 --> 03:40:59.952]  We put in 188 lines, is it?
[03:41:09.179 --> 03:41:12.180]  188 lines, 4 people to listen free.
[03:41:12.180 --> 03:41:16.181]  Now I'm paying to put this out, but I can't pay for toll free, because then I have to pay for your call.
[03:41:16.181 --> 03:41:17.521]  But I'm paying for you to be able to call it.
[03:41:17.521 --> 03:41:19.642]  It cost me $2,000 a month.
[03:41:19.642 --> 03:41:20.442]  Did you get that number?
[03:41:20.442 --> 03:41:20.982]  512-686-5000.
[03:41:20.982 --> 03:41:21.122]  No, 512-646-5000.
[03:41:21.122 --> 03:41:21.162]  512-646-5000.
[03:41:33.854 --> 03:41:38.195]  Well, I wish you would call them and see if you can do anything with them.
[03:41:38.195 --> 03:41:39.335]  Yeah, there's nothing I can do.
[03:41:39.335 --> 03:41:42.155]  There's nothing I can do but drop it.
[03:41:42.155 --> 03:41:42.635]  I hear you.
[03:41:42.635 --> 03:41:44.976]  Well, I just gave you a number to call.
[03:41:44.976 --> 03:41:46.336]  Thank you, Ruth.
[03:41:46.336 --> 03:41:46.876]  I'm sorry.
[03:41:46.876 --> 03:41:49.037]  I mean, you know, they're shutting the web down, too.
[03:41:49.037 --> 03:41:50.717]  You've got big articles about that up there.
[03:41:50.717 --> 03:41:54.077]  I mean, play the first 30 seconds of Australian TV.
[03:41:54.077 --> 03:41:54.598]  Play it, John.
[03:41:54.598 --> 03:41:57.778]  This was just yesterday.
[03:41:57.778 --> 03:42:02.999]  And Senator Xenophon, who has an anti-gambling agenda, has said that he wants the system used to block...
[03:42:04.190 --> 03:42:10.475]  But first, making news this morning, and the federal government will make internet censorship compulsory for all Australians.
[03:42:10.475 --> 03:42:21.623]  The Daily Telegraph says controversial websites on euthanasia and anorexia could be banned, and that would put our level of net censorship alongside places like China, Cuba, Iran and North Korea.
[03:42:21.623 --> 03:42:25.526]  A poll on Sunrise this morning asked, should the government censor the internet?
[03:42:25.526 --> 03:42:29.729]  Now, 20% said yes, a whopping 80% said no.
[03:42:29.729 --> 03:42:32.350]  Dale Clapperton is from Electronic Frontiers Australia.
[03:42:32.350 --> 03:42:32.791]  Alright, that's enough.
[03:42:33.191 --> 03:42:41.958]  Point is, the same hubs to censor the web have been put in in the US, put in in England, put in in Canada, put in in New Zealand, put in in Europe, and they're turning them on.
[03:42:41.958 --> 03:42:44.620]  That's only one way they're censoring.
[03:42:44.620 --> 03:42:47.322]  Already, if you're on Time Warner Cable, you go through their hub.
[03:42:47.322 --> 03:42:50.484]  If you do a wrong URL, you'll be on their site, you'll notice.
[03:42:50.484 --> 03:42:51.525]  It's all here.
[03:42:51.525 --> 03:42:52.826]  I mean, Bob, they're not playing games.
[03:42:52.826 --> 03:42:55.648]  If they start World War III, we're off the air.
[03:42:55.648 --> 03:42:57.349]  Yeah, I mean, that's it.
[03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.729]  Bye-bye.
[03:42:57.729 --> 03:43:00.531]  You won't hear Alex anymore.
[03:43:00.531 --> 03:43:01.732]  You want to explain that to them, Bob?
[03:43:01.732 --> 03:43:02.533]  This is the real world?
[03:43:04.178 --> 03:43:11.105]  They do what they want to do, and they don't care, and they're arrogant, and they're going for the whole thing.
[03:43:11.105 --> 03:43:18.933]  And as far as I'm concerned, nothing's going to stop them, and sooner or later they will take us down off the internet.
[03:43:18.933 --> 03:43:21.175]  Yeah, folks, you'd better appreciate it while it's here.
[03:43:21.175 --> 03:43:24.799]  I don't know if we've got weeks, months, or years, but they are openly announcing
[03:43:27.051 --> 03:43:29.972]  Twenty-thirty different ways, but ten main ways.
[03:43:29.972 --> 03:43:32.253]  We've done articles on it, but a whole group of things.
[03:43:32.253 --> 03:43:34.574]  They're attacking it right now.
[03:43:34.574 --> 03:43:37.015]  Oh, my God.
[03:43:37.015 --> 03:43:38.275]  Robert in California.
[03:43:38.275 --> 03:43:40.956]  Robert, you're on the air.
[03:43:40.956 --> 03:43:41.797]  Hello?
[03:43:41.797 --> 03:43:43.957]  Yes, Robert.
[03:43:43.957 --> 03:43:47.919]  Yeah, actually, Alex, thanks for waking me up to all this.
[03:43:47.919 --> 03:43:50.360]  I've been listening to you for about two years now.
[03:43:51.307 --> 03:43:53.347]  Um, and Robert David Chapman.
[03:43:53.347 --> 03:44:06.770]  I just wanted to get some... Well, I listen to G. Edward Griffin a lot, and he explains how when they print out more greenbacks and more Federal Reserve notes, that it's a form of taxation.
[03:44:06.770 --> 03:44:10.050]  And, um, I think a lot of people don't really understand how that works.
[03:44:10.050 --> 03:44:12.611]  It's called the inflation tax.
[03:44:12.611 --> 03:44:14.291]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:44:14.291 --> 03:44:20.312]  And it's, um... So this whole bailout thing is kind of like, almost like a smoke screen, in a sense, because they're doing that already anyway.
[03:44:21.004 --> 03:44:25.188]  I mean, when they just... This is on a grand scale, is what you're saying.
[03:44:25.188 --> 03:44:25.708]  Yeah.
[03:44:25.708 --> 03:44:27.230]  And it is.
[03:44:27.230 --> 03:44:37.379]  And it's a giant tax, because it's going to depreciate the value of anything that you already own, probably the only exception being gold.
[03:44:37.379 --> 03:44:38.580]  Yeah, what they're... Go ahead.
[03:44:39.930 --> 03:44:46.433]  Oh, well, I think they're actually getting to the point where the cost of printing paper is getting more expensive than the value of the dollar.
[03:44:46.433 --> 03:44:50.135]  Well, we haven't got there yet, but that's ultra-hyperinflation.
[03:44:50.135 --> 03:44:52.056]  Thanks for the call.
[03:44:52.056 --> 03:44:55.258]  And don't forget G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:44:55.258 --> 03:44:56.139]  You've got to read it.
[03:44:56.139 --> 03:44:57.079]  These are all great callers.
[03:44:57.079 --> 03:45:01.842]  I'm just having to go to you briefly because we've got to end this soon with Bob Chapman and have a little mini guest on real fast.
[03:45:03.382 --> 03:45:13.626]  I just want to make it clear here that as bad as this stuff sounds, you know, we're just telling you the facts as we know it and meeting the threat and being honest about the threat is the best way to counter it.
[03:45:13.626 --> 03:45:19.268]  But the reason I think Bob may be right just about how quickly things may degenerate is that
[03:45:20.492 --> 03:45:21.412]  They're going for broke.
[03:45:21.412 --> 03:45:37.577]  I mean, when it's in the Associated Press that they are taking the trillion-plus bucks they put out first as bonuses and to buy up other banks as a consolidation and a vertical integration, and they admit that we were lied to about what it was for.
[03:45:37.577 --> 03:45:38.457]  We told you that day one.
[03:45:38.457 --> 03:45:40.638]  We could read the bill.
[03:45:40.638 --> 03:45:46.019]  The fact that they just don't care shows they've made the decision to just go all the way.
[03:45:46.019 --> 03:45:47.520]  Bob?
[03:45:47.520 --> 03:45:47.840]  I agree.
[03:45:49.040 --> 03:46:00.503]  I agree, and that's where we're headed, and people have got to wake up, and they've got to wake up fast, and they've got to try to do something about it.
[03:46:00.503 --> 03:46:03.803]  Billy Bob in Timbuktu.
[03:46:03.803 --> 03:46:04.324]  Go ahead.
[03:46:04.324 --> 03:46:05.624]  Go ahead.
[03:46:05.624 --> 03:46:07.744]  Yes, Steve, I'm privileged to be on the air.
[03:46:07.744 --> 03:46:12.505]  First of all, it's interesting to me that the caller just before me had a time limit.
[03:46:12.505 --> 03:46:13.106]  Hold on, hold on.
[03:46:13.106 --> 03:46:14.566]  You just said your name's Steve?
[03:46:15.478 --> 03:46:18.078]  No, isn't your name Steve?
[03:46:18.078 --> 03:46:19.279]  No, my name is Alex Jones.
[03:46:19.279 --> 03:46:19.999]  Alex Jones.
[03:46:19.999 --> 03:46:21.739]  And then you're talking to Bob Chapman.
[03:46:21.739 --> 03:46:22.019]  Yes.
[03:46:22.019 --> 03:46:23.639]  And then you gave the fake name of Billy Bob.
[03:46:23.639 --> 03:46:24.900]  Now go ahead.
[03:46:24.900 --> 03:46:30.681]  Anyway, you said you're spending $2,000 for phone lines, and I've got a good suggestion for you.
[03:46:30.681 --> 03:46:42.423]  If you go to freeconferencecall.com, you can get a, go to the Simple Events site, you can get 1,000 participant listeners, and it's absolutely free.
[03:46:42.423 --> 03:46:44.923]  People can call into this free conferencing site.
[03:46:45.732 --> 03:46:48.953]  And you can throw away, you know, quit spending that $2,000.
[03:46:48.953 --> 03:46:50.313]  Well, we'll certainly do that.
[03:46:50.313 --> 03:46:53.334]  We just did that as they're shutting down the web as an emergency backup.
[03:46:53.334 --> 03:46:54.275]  We're going to try to expand it.
[03:46:54.275 --> 03:46:57.136]  This is our own phone cards, our own phone lines.
[03:46:57.136 --> 03:46:58.476]  See, that's on the internet.
[03:46:58.476 --> 03:47:00.697]  That could go down.
[03:47:00.697 --> 03:47:04.778]  We're doing this on independent, real phone lines.
[03:47:04.778 --> 03:47:11.600]  Okay, so we have something, you know, as we get people prepared for the idea of not having the internet.
[03:47:13.539 --> 03:47:16.622]  But that's a great idea for us to do while we have the web.
[03:47:16.622 --> 03:47:18.303]  Give me the name of it again.
[03:47:18.303 --> 03:47:22.506]  Freeconferencecall.com or you can call 877-482-5838.
[03:47:22.506 --> 03:47:32.434]  And then I've also got a question for Bob Chapman on the gas prices.
[03:47:32.434 --> 03:47:37.337]  Why were the prices falling the same times there were shortages being reported?
[03:47:37.337 --> 03:47:42.742]  Because we have a rigged market and because the speculators were all bailing out of the market, Bob.
[03:47:42.742 --> 03:47:43.162]  That's it.
[03:47:44.782 --> 03:48:02.038]  Now they're down to $215 to $230, and as soon as the election's over and the money starts to really hit the economy that they've injected into it, then the commodities will go back and retrace 50% of their losses, as will gold and silver.
[03:48:02.038 --> 03:48:06.922]  And at the same time, the stock market will be under pressure and it will go down and plumb new
[03:48:08.644 --> 03:48:10.284]  Recent lows if you may.
[03:48:10.284 --> 03:48:15.585]  Alright, gotta let you go caller, because Bob's gotta leave and I got a mini guest coming up about fighting these checkpoints.
[03:48:15.585 --> 03:48:33.549]  Bob, and we'll talk to the break too, I don't want to waste any time, things are so serious, but for the full audience right now, folks can get a free copy of the newsletter, it's huge, that you sent and read around the world, with excellent analysis that you send out twice a week, electronically twice a month, a big physical one.

[03:48:37.290 --> 03:48:38.050]  You can go to
[03:48:38.755 --> 03:48:43.818]  The site on the internet, TheInternationalForecaster.com.

[03:49:07.954 --> 03:49:08.315]  Exactly.
[03:49:08.315 --> 03:49:09.516]  Alright Bob, let's
[03:49:16.923 --> 03:49:21.784]  I've got to plug a sponsor right now, but we're going to talk during the break for the internet audience, so stay right there, Bob.
[03:49:21.784 --> 03:49:25.025]  I want to tell folks about New Vitality.
[03:49:25.025 --> 03:49:32.428]  New Vitality has hundreds of well-documented vitamins, herbs, different combinations that don't have any magical cure properties.
[03:49:32.428 --> 03:49:36.289]  They're just well-known to really be healthful and to treat a lot of problems.
[03:49:36.289 --> 03:49:38.109]  And a lot of this stuff is doctor-recommended, by the way.
[03:49:38.109 --> 03:49:39.930]  A lot of this stuff has been proven over decades.

[03:49:52.259 --> 03:49:52.740]  800-569-4056.
[03:49:52.740 --> 03:49:58.484]  They have the aloes colon and body cleanse.
[03:49:58.484 --> 03:50:00.285]  It totally flushes out your guts.
[03:50:00.285 --> 03:50:01.907]  They got stuff like the super beta prostate.
[03:50:03.502 --> 03:50:07.204]  Hey, that sounds like ice cream trucks or Christmas out there.
[03:50:07.204 --> 03:50:13.528]  Remember Willie last week?
[03:50:13.528 --> 03:50:14.268]  Oh, man.

[03:50:24.294 --> 03:50:25.875]  800-569-4056.
[03:50:25.875 --> 03:50:27.936]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[03:50:27.936 --> 03:50:30.297]  For the full audience, we say bye to Bob Chapman.
[03:50:30.297 --> 03:50:31.258]  More than... Let me go to Bob now.
[03:50:33.329 --> 03:50:39.412]  Did you get this Bush person on, John?
[03:50:39.412 --> 03:50:41.153]  John Harmon.
[03:50:41.153 --> 03:50:42.654]  Yes, sir.
[03:50:42.654 --> 03:50:44.735]  Go ahead and get John Bush on.
[03:50:44.735 --> 03:50:45.996]  Yep, I got him on the line.
[03:50:45.996 --> 03:50:51.879]  Alright, I want to bring him up in a minute here behind the scenes, but I want to say bye to Bob Chapman.
[03:50:51.879 --> 03:50:57.562]  Bob, appreciate you coming on, but here, just for the internet audience, Gold's gone back up some this week.
[03:50:59.343 --> 03:51:00.524]  I know, and it's a two-tiered market.
[03:51:00.524 --> 03:51:04.345]  One is controlled by the powers behind government, which is the COMEX and the CBOT markets.
[03:51:04.345 --> 03:51:06.807]  And then there's a real market, which is a physical market.
[03:51:22.398 --> 03:51:24.059]  With virtually nothing available.
[03:51:24.059 --> 03:51:27.240]  Yeah, gold's plunging in price, but you can't find it anywhere.
[03:51:27.240 --> 03:51:33.882]  That's right, and so you can see the proof of the manipulations going on.
[03:51:33.882 --> 03:51:38.164]  They've got gold down in the December month today, $20, but that's nothing.
[03:51:38.164 --> 03:51:46.867]  You get an election coming up, and they'll want gold to sit still or be slightly weaker, and they'll want the market to go up, as I explained a couple of weeks ago.
[03:51:48.627 --> 03:51:57.275]  And after the election's over, the things will change and Goal will take a run, along with Silver to the upside, and the market will start to filter back down again.
[03:51:57.275 --> 03:51:59.337]  All right, Bob, I want to talk to you again next week.
[03:51:59.337 --> 03:52:00.718]  Thanks for all the time.
[03:52:00.718 --> 03:52:01.399]  All right, thank you.
[03:52:01.399 --> 03:52:01.699]  Bye-bye.
[03:52:01.699 --> 03:52:02.760]  All right, cut the feed.
[03:52:02.760 --> 03:52:04.322]  I want to talk to somebody behind the scenes real fast.
[03:52:06.491 --> 03:52:13.495]  Game, blueprint for global enslavement, the true story of the Bilderberg Group, the late great USA, America, freedom to fascism.
[03:52:13.495 --> 03:52:20.680]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[03:53:23.546 --> 03:53:28.130]  HHO, also called browns gas, spurs efficiently and provides the energy your car needs.
[03:53:34.392 --> 03:53:38.857]  One more sponsor and then four minutes with John Bush out there taking action.
[03:53:38.857 --> 03:53:40.679]  I'm going to get him to pop in longer tomorrow.
[03:53:40.679 --> 03:53:44.162]  I apologize for moving him today, but we had this World War III news.
[03:53:44.162 --> 03:53:47.085]  Rand lobbies Pentagon to start wars to save U.S.
[03:53:47.085 --> 03:53:51.590]  Wants them to hit a major nation.
[03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:55.714]  Bigger than Iraq.
[03:53:55.714 --> 03:53:57.316]  Food shortage USA.
[03:53:59.315 --> 03:54:00.836]  FoodShortageUSA.com.

[03:54:09.221 --> 03:54:13.844]  I think the best part about the system is it gets you off the food grid, even if you don't have a lot of money to spend.
[03:54:13.844 --> 03:54:16.325]  The site is FoodShortageUSA.com.

[03:54:28.212 --> 03:54:31.639]  And it's always good to not trust the murdering criminals that run our government.
[03:54:33.021 --> 03:54:37.844]  And yeah, don't drink the water, and now I guess don't drink the milk and children's ice cream with all the fluoride in it.
[03:54:37.844 --> 03:54:40.185]  Again, foodshortageusa.com.
[03:54:40.185 --> 03:54:42.206]  Okay, I'm going to get you back up to 30 minutes to market.
[03:54:42.206 --> 03:54:43.527]  This is a big subject.
[03:54:43.527 --> 03:54:49.931]  I had the police chief in here, who I like overall, but he's wickedly taking money from the feds for warrantless bloodsucking.
[03:54:49.931 --> 03:54:50.711]  We've had lawyers on.
[03:54:50.711 --> 03:54:53.352]  These are fake group warrants.
[03:54:53.352 --> 03:55:01.097]  Tell us what's coming up in Austin and also under federal grants nationwide on the high holy day of Samhain tomorrow.
[03:55:02.341 --> 03:55:08.424]  Well, on July 1st this year, KXAN published an article titled, Austin Police Chief Wants to Take Your Blood.
[03:55:08.424 --> 03:55:14.907]  There's a quote from Alcavedo in which he states, My intent in the future is to make it so there is no such thing as a refusal.
[03:55:14.907 --> 03:55:18.809]  You can refuse all you want, but we are going to aggressively seek search warrants.
[03:55:18.809 --> 03:55:20.290]  So we caught wind of that.
[03:55:20.290 --> 03:55:25.672]  We stormed a downtown area commander's forum with over 200 people, and we started questioning them.
[03:55:25.672 --> 03:55:26.433]  They played dumb.
[03:55:26.433 --> 03:55:29.234]  They said there's not going to be any major change in policy.
[03:55:29.756 --> 03:55:30.777]  We got all the documents.
[03:55:30.777 --> 03:55:38.180]  It turns out that Chief Acevedo has already applied for a federal grant from the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration, which would train the DWI.
[03:55:38.180 --> 03:55:38.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:55:38.480 --> 03:55:39.100]  Let's be clear.
[03:55:39.100 --> 03:55:43.322]  They've already been doing it on the streets in Austin hospitals and refuse to draw blood.
[03:55:43.322 --> 03:55:43.782]  This is true.
[03:55:43.782 --> 03:55:44.683]  This is true.
[03:55:44.683 --> 03:55:47.704]  Now they're making it official and it's actually going to be the police officers that are
[03:55:48.303 --> 03:55:49.704]  I've been talking to police officers.
[03:55:49.704 --> 03:55:50.705]  They're against it.
[03:55:50.705 --> 03:55:54.147]  They don't want to have to get that liability, but you know there's some of those jack-booted thugs that are
[03:56:16.636 --> 03:56:19.357]  You know, they're fiending for that blood of the vampire police.
[03:56:19.357 --> 03:56:20.258]  It's crazy.
[03:56:20.258 --> 03:56:21.198]  Hey, yeah, it's Halloween.
[03:56:21.198 --> 03:56:25.560]  You've got vampiric ringwraiths in black uniforms.
[03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:27.661]  With the head ghoul, Arte Cervedo.
[03:56:27.661 --> 03:56:30.602]  I'm going to get him back in studio, but go ahead.
[03:56:30.602 --> 03:56:34.284]  We recently formed a political action committee called Texans for Accountable Government.
[03:56:34.284 --> 03:56:38.026]  And basically what we're focusing on is fighting the New World Order here on the local level.
[03:56:38.544 --> 03:56:43.688]  Regardless of the federal programs or the United Nations programs, they have to implement them on the local level.
[03:56:43.688 --> 03:56:48.931]  So we can cut them off there before they can execute them, and it makes it meaningless for them on the national level.
[03:56:48.931 --> 03:56:52.734]  We're sticking out for Austin here, Travis County, and the state of Texas.
[03:56:52.734 --> 03:56:55.235]  We're looking out for our own backs, unfortunately.
[03:56:55.235 --> 03:56:59.638]  As the bailout went through, it's evident that the federal government doesn't give a damn what we have to say.
[03:56:59.638 --> 03:57:00.859]  Alright, well give us the website.
[03:57:02.483 --> 03:57:07.610]  Yeah, the website is stopvampirecops.wordpress.com.
[03:57:07.610 --> 03:57:09.533]  That's right.
[03:57:09.533 --> 03:57:10.374]  Oh my God.
[03:57:10.374 --> 03:57:13.899]  You got a little character change for a hot potato out of a vampire.
[03:57:13.899 --> 03:57:17.023]  It's great.
[03:57:17.023 --> 03:57:18.465]  Stop Vampire Cops.
[03:57:18.465 --> 03:57:18.945]  What is it?
[03:57:19.738 --> 03:57:22.019]  StopVampireCops.wordpress.com.
[03:57:22.019 --> 03:57:25.262]  The email address is StopVampireCops at yahoo.com.
[03:57:25.262 --> 03:57:28.464]  And tomorrow night on Halloween, we're going to be out in mass.
[03:57:28.464 --> 03:57:30.825]  It's 4th in Colorado at 9pm.
[03:57:30.825 --> 03:57:31.966]  We're holding a press conference.
[03:57:31.966 --> 03:57:33.687]  We invited the local press.
[03:57:33.687 --> 03:57:37.129]  And we're just going to stand up and say we're not going to take it here in the city of Austin.
[03:57:37.129 --> 03:57:38.350]  We're going to hold you accountable.
[03:57:38.732 --> 03:57:39.773]  This is the will of the people.
[03:57:39.773 --> 03:57:41.455]  We are above the local government.
[03:57:41.455 --> 03:57:44.178]  So, we'd like everybody to come out, show up in force.
[03:57:44.178 --> 03:57:45.740]  We're going to march down 6th Street.
[03:57:45.740 --> 03:57:52.788]  Hey, hey, Josh, I mean, John, I'm going to let you go, John Bush, but I'll have my producer call you.
[03:57:52.788 --> 03:57:54.951]  Set you up for 30 minutes tomorrow, because I want to talk more about this.
[03:57:54.951 --> 03:57:57.293]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:57:57.293 --> 03:57:57.994]  I'm out of time.
[03:57:57.994 --> 03:57:59.175]  Let me talk to him after the show's over.
[03:57:59.741 --> 03:58:00.843]  I'm out of time right now.
[03:58:00.843 --> 03:58:04.309]  Back tomorrow, a bunch of big guests and key info from 11 to 3 live.
[03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:06.773]  But rebroadcast starts now, one place.
[03:58:06.773 --> 03:58:08.676]  Big guest today, InfoWars.com.
[03:58:08.676 --> 03:58:09.016]  Toodle-oo!
