[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:25.760]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones why do I have so many
[00:25.760 --> 00:36.240]  websites why do I have info wars dot com info wars dot net prison planet dot TV news dot
[00:36.240 --> 00:45.880]  US Jones report dot com why do I have that well it's because our servers get attacked
[00:45.880 --> 00:50.840]  our servers get hacked we also just have regular technical difficulties as we get more and
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.080]  more traffic to the websites it gets harder and harder to keep them up and to be in the
[00:56.080 --> 01:03.440]  format we have with lots of photos and graphics and images just massive traffic millions and
[01:03.440 --> 01:10.400]  millions of people visiting the sites every day or to be accurate about every two days
[01:10.400 --> 01:17.160]  over a million people visit all the sites together millions and millions a week and info wars
[01:17.160 --> 01:23.400]  dot com has been down for two hours john harman says it was down before nine a.m. this morning
[01:23.400 --> 01:31.280]  I noticed it about nine fifteen we're getting phone calls and emails about it yes we know
[01:31.280 --> 01:38.560]  but this is probably just a technical problem and we're working on it the bigger issue
[01:38.560 --> 01:49.640]  is the internet itself is under attack and free speech on the web is under attack by
[01:49.640 --> 01:54.840]  governments worldwide by corporations and it is happening now it isn't coming it isn't
[01:54.840 --> 02:02.080]  over the next hill it is here with us now and it's the incremental restriction and phasing
[02:02.080 --> 02:07.120]  out of what is the internet today the creation of new networks that are highly controlled
[02:07.120 --> 02:13.440]  whole governments like australia preparing to filter out basically all alternative news
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.800]  quote free government wireless networks provided through your tax money nationwide in europe
[02:18.800 --> 02:24.960]  in the united states openly announcing that basically any alternative news sites will
[02:24.960 --> 02:33.320]  be banned it will be a consortium of approved sites and then once that intensifies google
[02:33.320 --> 02:37.640]  and youtube and others they can intensify their censoring which they already do with
[02:37.640 --> 02:44.160]  wanton abandoned because you won't have a choice you won't have anywhere else to go
[02:44.160 --> 02:50.080]  so take that as an example we can get around hacks and denial of service attacks and massive
[02:50.080 --> 03:01.400]  traffic but we cannot get around government censorship without a political answer i mean
[03:01.400 --> 03:06.760]  they announced eight months ago in canada and the united states the time warner and
[03:06.760 --> 03:14.840]  comcast are only gonna let you visit a couple thousand websites when you surf the web out
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.200]  of the hundreds of millions that are out there hundreds of millions of websites they say
[03:18.200 --> 03:24.640]  there's tens of billions of pages but hundreds of millions of sites run by hundreds of millions
[03:24.640 --> 03:29.320]  of people through diversity of thought and debate to find the best in man the worst in
[03:29.320 --> 03:39.540]  man on the web and i noticed about six months ago time warner cable if i type a url wrong
[03:39.540 --> 03:49.320]  in on my time warner cable internet roadrunner at home or at the office it takes me to an
[03:49.320 --> 03:56.160]  error page on time warner site and i've talked to ip i t people that's because your traffic
[03:56.160 --> 04:01.360]  is running over their routers well now it's running through them through a filter and
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.720]  i've got a bunch of mainstream news reporting the facts that we were already aware of but
[04:05.720 --> 04:09.800]  for anybody doubting it they're now admitting it that all of this snooping and all of this
[04:09.800 --> 04:16.880]  filtering and all of this tracking slows the web down and screws up the internet but they
[04:16.880 --> 04:21.360]  know that then they force you on the internet to and that's the stated plan from public
[04:21.360 --> 04:26.340]  internet to consortium meetings from london to tokyo to austin texas you go pull up the
[04:26.340 --> 04:30.560]  minutes of it they meet once a year for over a decade and say their job is to kill the
[04:30.560 --> 04:36.360]  old net and force you onto a controlled internet so what's happening in the united states england
[04:36.360 --> 04:41.800]  canada and europe proper is the gates are being put on it's like you always went to
[04:41.800 --> 04:45.720]  a park and then something one day you show when there's a gate at the park's entrance
[04:45.720 --> 04:51.480]  and a fence but it's still open and then you show back up the next week and it's locked
[04:51.480 --> 04:58.280]  but then come back the next day it's open see they put the gates in place you understand
[04:58.280 --> 05:00.280]  now they're going to start shutting it down

[09:04.000 --> 09:11.560]  going to government buildings going to facilities and uh... he told the stories on camera but
[09:11.560 --> 09:16.160]  with the agreement that we would release it at least for a few months until this pilots
[09:16.160 --> 09:23.840]  done and aired on tru tv and again i know a lot behind the scenes stuff on that i'm
[09:23.840 --> 09:33.400]  not really at liberty to get into it but we'll see how much you'll say on air about that
[09:33.400 --> 09:38.040]  so uh... second hour we've got uh... former minnesota governor jesse vintera popping in
[09:38.040 --> 09:45.040]  back with us then bob chatman and the international forecaster on this thursday edition the thirtieth
[09:45.040 --> 09:53.680]  day of october two thousand eight and then uh... john bush local activist they are going
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.760]  to be protesting the fact that they're going to have police at checkpoints pulling people
[09:59.760 --> 10:03.640]  out of their cars and threatening them that if you don't violate your fourth amendment
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.520]  and your fifth amendment itself and cremation if you don't engage in this ritual of destroying
[10:09.520 --> 10:15.680]  america with us in the name of everyone's safety then we're going to take your blood
[10:15.680 --> 10:21.680]  we've had top lawyers state officials on to cover this in the last six months or so since
[10:21.680 --> 10:28.000]  the fed started it in san antonio dallas austin houston
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.800]  we've had them on the show and they've gone over the evidence in the facts in the court
[10:31.800 --> 10:39.560]  cases but these aren't real warrants they just swear out uh... these uh... blanket warrants
[10:39.560 --> 10:45.400]  at checkpoints they're doing this in indiana and colorado going back seven eight years
[10:45.400 --> 10:52.360]  first place we ever saw it was in uh... to son and phoenix about as it was in two thousand
[10:52.360 --> 11:00.200]  i would read the uh... to son paper in the phoenix paper on air back in two thousand
[11:00.200 --> 11:05.080]  hand time flies i think that was ninety nine and people wouldn't believe it you know back
[11:05.080 --> 11:10.840]  then all that's ridiculous that's shocking police at checkpoints taking blood now in
[11:10.840 --> 11:16.120]  arizona they just did it without warrants any with flashlights in the dark taking your
[11:16.120 --> 11:24.480]  blood now they tried this uh... month ago in austin it was in uh... local kxn covered
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.000]  at the associate of press covered as well you can google it if you want and they took
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.160]  them to the austin hospitals and told them take blood they said uh...
[11:32.160 --> 11:35.080]  well some of the hospital said no out of the gate even though they had agreements with
[11:35.080 --> 11:39.960]  them the nurses and doctors on call so that's unethical and i'm not going to do that they
[11:39.960 --> 11:46.000]  got a few of them to do it but then the uh... austin hospitals private ones and even the
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.960]  city hospital said i put out memos what i think a week ago saying we're not doing this
[11:50.960 --> 11:56.600]  don't bring them here so see now austin saying okay we'll hire our own nurses and have them
[11:56.600 --> 12:03.880]  in the mobile units and we'll do it see that's why to son and phoenix and places in indiana
[12:03.880 --> 12:08.920]  that i've seen in the news that's why they've gotten to that point all in illinois the worst
[12:08.920 --> 12:12.640]  where the cops just take it without warrants it's just like hey let's do it they don't
[12:12.640 --> 12:18.120]  even tell the police that they're opening themselves up to lawsuits they can't even imagine
[12:18.120 --> 12:22.720]  and i mean come on real police work and stop drunks you want to park outside a bar but
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.560]  the tell them don't do that don't run the business off you want to park outside a bar and you
[12:27.560 --> 12:31.360]  want to see drunk people pulling out i can take you down there and show it to you you
[12:31.360 --> 12:38.960]  want to find people one beer is driving under the influence and is illegal they want to
[12:38.960 --> 12:44.240]  throw the book at you three beers for the average person in an hour and a half in the
[12:44.240 --> 12:52.160]  average state of average weight average individual is driving while you're intoxicated and it's
[12:52.160 --> 12:59.320]  so hypocritical we need to get the sloshing drunks off the roads but you go down here
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.600]  and you downtown austin and and you because that's where some of the good restaurants
[13:04.600 --> 13:08.840]  are i'll go down there and eat maybe once a month or so and there are drunks everywhere
[13:08.840 --> 13:13.400]  stumbling around falling down getting in their cars i mean all you got to do is put five
[13:13.400 --> 13:17.880]  or six cop cars down there and sit outside bars and and watch the drunks come stumbling
[13:17.880 --> 13:24.080]  out but no no we're gonna have federally funded checkpoints all over the country on every holiday
[13:24.080 --> 13:32.360]  where you get to pull through and have cop shine flashlights in your face i for one am
[13:32.360 --> 13:42.800]  sick of it i for one am tired of it all right i'm already ranting um josh bush local activist
[13:42.800 --> 13:47.440]  here in austin a member of the steering committee for texans for accountable government will
[13:47.440 --> 13:57.520]  be popping in in the fourth hour today to talk about this and some other issues but
[13:57.520 --> 14:05.200]  i remember in ninety nine two thousand going on air and reading articles out of the denver
[14:05.200 --> 14:12.600]  post articles out of different parts of the country and listeners couldn't believe it
[14:12.600 --> 14:19.840]  i had people emailing me saying you're a liar the police aren't taking blood at checkpoints
[14:19.840 --> 14:26.560]  oh yeah they are and you're denial doesn't change that saying i'm a liar doesn't change
[14:26.560 --> 14:30.720]  it okay of course now you're not saying that now you're oh yeah i don't know sure well
[14:30.720 --> 14:37.040]  it's to keep us safe give me a break ladies and gentlemen texans love to drink louisianas
[14:37.040 --> 14:42.580]  love to drink that we drink the most per capita of any two states you can go look at annual
[14:42.580 --> 14:49.800]  liquor sales austin now drinks more than new orleans per capita we're now number one in
[14:49.800 --> 14:54.240]  the country let me tell you who is really number one in north america that's mexico
[14:54.240 --> 14:59.880]  baby and that's why i'm not knocking the you know i'm being hypocritical here going
[14:59.880 --> 15:04.880]  look at you mexican south of the border a bunch of drunks i guess it takes drunks to
[15:04.880 --> 15:12.240]  no drunks but let me tell you i mean you go down to mexico until recently now they're
[15:12.240 --> 15:17.680]  all paramilitary sharp-eyed you know black uniformed but before it was the potbelly drunk
[15:17.680 --> 15:23.920]  corrupt cop believe me i've seen plenty of them gone are those guys we said most areas
[15:23.920 --> 15:31.680]  but you go down to mexico it is just drunkenness everywhere and we got probably 40 million illegal
[15:31.680 --> 15:36.640]  aliens in this country and it's just on a friday night is saturday night anywhere in texas
[15:36.640 --> 15:42.000]  it's just drunk illegal aliens driving around like maniacs everywhere smashing into each
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.640]  other smashing into everybody the cops pull them over now that austin cops admit this to
[15:49.640 --> 15:55.200]  my face it's been in the news where cops do arrest the drunk illegal aliens and they're
[15:55.200 --> 16:00.320]  basically given to merits for other reasons down the line it's not encouraged the judge
[16:00.320 --> 16:03.720]  is telling what i'm gonna do i don't even know this guy's name ice doesn't come and
[16:03.720 --> 16:10.640]  pick him up fifty dollar fine a citizen's caught drunk you're talking three four five
[16:10.640 --> 16:18.360]  thousand dollars and your life is ruined and my whole issue is drunk drivers are dangerous
[16:18.360 --> 16:24.600]  folks you think i want some drunk killing me and my family but i want real police work
[16:24.600 --> 16:29.880]  every time i mean i work a lot until one two three four in the morning every time i drive
[16:29.880 --> 16:34.640]  home you always see the drunks they drive real slow well there's a couple different
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.440]  things they do they drive real slow but then they're swerving down the highway and i just
[16:39.440 --> 16:44.520]  gun it around them get away from as fast as i can or they're driving a little bit over
[16:44.520 --> 16:48.160]  the speed limit or maybe ten miles of the speed limit and then you'll tell when they're
[16:48.160 --> 16:51.880]  concentrating they'll be driving straight also near over and i mean we've all seen
[16:51.880 --> 16:56.240]  it but you try driving home late at night here in austin texas there are drunks all
[16:56.240 --> 17:03.280]  over the road i mean i see drunks every night driving home where are the police where are
[17:03.280 --> 17:11.760]  you instead you're gonna come stick bloodsuckers in my arm and then you're gonna argue well
[17:11.760 --> 17:15.560]  uh you know we gotta get those drunks off the road and people know not to blow now well
[17:15.560 --> 17:19.960]  you know my liberty my freedom that that precedent shouldn't be set where you can take things
[17:19.960 --> 17:31.040]  out of my body without due process and so what you do is you get them falling down drunk
[17:31.040 --> 17:38.360]  on the videotape or you use the passive breathalysers they've got now and you just take them to
[17:38.360 --> 17:45.200]  jail and then you show a jury that that's what the process is like better a hundred
[17:45.200 --> 17:52.800]  guilty men go free than one innocent man go and i mean it's a system they got liquor
[17:52.800 --> 17:57.800]  ads and liquor advertised everywhere and drugs are sold everywhere legal and illegal and
[17:57.800 --> 18:04.680]  then the cops you're supposedly out cleaning it up cleaning it up the illegal drugs are
[18:04.680 --> 18:10.080]  shipped in by the criminal groups in the government openly the deadlier even deadlier
[18:10.080 --> 18:18.840]  pharmac pharmacological drugs are pushed on the kids by the systems by the schools and
[18:18.840 --> 18:25.080]  the alcohol is advertised everywhere and in hollywood and in culture i remember being
[18:25.080 --> 18:29.000]  twelve years old you know i'm gonna play baseball my friends and i'd be at a party with a sixteen
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.080]  and eighteen year olds and there'd be beer bombs everybody getting drunk another big
[18:34.080 --> 18:37.800]  part of its parents you really think you're twelve year old your thirteen year old is
[18:37.800 --> 18:49.520]  really going to play baseball you better keep an eye on them they're not
[18:49.520 --> 18:55.600]  and so the issue here is responsibility individually you're not going to stop people from making

[32:57.520 --> 33:00.960]  well it's the poor man's way of having redundancy instead of having
[33:02.560 --> 33:09.040]  big giant server farms and cds back when we couldn't afford those
[33:09.040 --> 33:15.920]  we went with each side having its own server that way separately if things got attacked they were
[33:15.920 --> 33:22.000]  spread out for days like this when info wars dot com has now been down two and a half hours
[33:23.200 --> 33:30.800]  but you can still visit prison the planet dot com info wars dot net prison planet dot tv
[33:30.800 --> 33:39.280]  jones report dot com truth news dot us and others but that isn't the issue info wars
[33:39.280 --> 33:45.280]  dot com being down for a few hours the issue is the attacks on the internet to shut it down
[33:45.280 --> 33:50.800]  to restrict it to curtail it and it's now happening it's now being openly announced
[33:52.080 --> 33:56.320]  and finally the public is not in denial just six months ago people emailed me when we wrote stories
[33:56.320 --> 34:02.720]  at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com about my space being a trojan horse for internet
[34:02.720 --> 34:06.960]  censorship was one headline got picked up a few years ago all over the country reported on and you
[34:06.960 --> 34:11.600]  know major papers like the san francisco chronicle people said oh it can't be true oh no they're not
[34:11.600 --> 34:15.200]  really planning that and though we had all the quotes and documents and now it's like yeah they're
[34:15.200 --> 34:23.440]  trying it yeah we got to stop them so that's the bigger issue is that the alternative media is
[34:23.440 --> 34:27.440]  kicking the hind end of the new world order and their lies and fraud and propaganda and they're
[34:27.440 --> 34:32.720]  losing more and more credibility so they're moving to try to block it right now already at many
[34:32.720 --> 34:38.160]  libraries and universities worldwide not just in the u.s and government wireless systems

[34:56.400 --> 35:02.400]  too we don't have a future unless we stand up and expose this and speak out and boycott

[38:38.320 --> 38:42.480]  none of it to the people and we're paying the bill for it they're not jump starting the economy
[38:42.480 --> 38:48.400]  they're the ones killing it look i know a lot of people out there haven't studied history but if
[38:48.400 --> 38:54.240]  you had you'd be horrified because this happens 99 percent of the time tyranny's come to the four
[38:54.240 --> 38:59.280]  and they take over and loot everything and destroy the middle class it's happening now
[38:59.280 --> 39:02.400]  they've got us right where they want us they've set all this up
[39:05.920 --> 39:12.480]  and god help us finish up with a clip now 20 percent said yes a whopping 80 percent said no
[39:12.480 --> 39:17.280]  dale clapperton is from electronic frontiers australia now that's a group dedicated to
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.120]  protecting online freedom he joins us now from brisman good morning to you dale
[39:21.120 --> 39:26.320]  well good morning good morning obviously you don't think we need compulsory internet
[39:26.960 --> 39:33.600]  censorship for australians no we've had the internet in australia for about 30 years now
[39:33.600 --> 39:40.320]  at various stages along the way people have raised doomsday scenarios about what was going to happen
[39:40.320 --> 39:47.040]  if the internet was not censored most recently back in 1999 when the Howard government attempted
[39:47.040 --> 39:52.160]  legislation along these lines but what we've really seen now is people who have grown up
[39:52.160 --> 39:57.520]  with the internet understand it understand its dangers people who have grew up with the internet
[39:57.520 --> 40:02.480]  as children now have children of their own and they're quite capable of making informed decisions
[40:02.480 --> 40:08.400]  about it now do you have children uh no i don't yeah i'm just wondering do you think we need any
[40:08.400 --> 40:15.200]  kind of internet censorship at all stop right there stop right there the power to put a gate
[40:15.200 --> 40:24.800]  on it and the gates are already there is the power to destroy it google yahoo microsoft let me explain
[40:24.800 --> 40:33.840]  this you can go pull this up they built the chinese control grid that censors out 90 plus
[40:33.840 --> 40:40.320]  percent of alternative sites i mean it's very effective they built the systems used in cuba and
[40:40.320 --> 40:51.360]  iran they built the systems used in north korea they built the systems they went in they have
[40:51.360 --> 41:03.520]  designed the national id card for china ibm they google china google in all these controlled
[41:03.520 --> 41:10.000]  countries they run it they do it for the government all they gotta do is flip a switch here we've
[41:10.000 --> 41:16.320]  already seen google and youtube you know we'll be getting a million views a day on say terror storm
[41:16.320 --> 41:20.800]  or endgame and they just wouldn't knock us back to zero but nobody else and knock us out of the
[41:20.800 --> 41:26.320]  top 100 the first day fabled enemies came out it was number one on google it was number one the
[41:26.320 --> 41:31.200]  second day and they just erased it they just knocked it completely out of the top 100
[41:33.760 --> 41:39.680]  now about eight months ago before they would have public view counts on google video because they
[41:39.680 --> 41:43.840]  got caught over and over again censoring it to keep you off the front page where you could reach
[41:43.840 --> 41:50.080]  people that weren't in the choir they would go in there and just knock you off but it was obvious
[41:50.800 --> 41:54.880]  the only way you can see your numbers now on google video is if you upload it so we uploaded
[41:54.880 --> 42:01.840]  fabled enemies so we could internally see what the views were millions nowhere on the front page
[42:01.840 --> 42:08.240]  censored cheated because again people use the google video page like a tv guide they go in and
[42:08.240 --> 42:13.280]  see what's popular and whatever gets in there tends to stay in there you think they want terror
[42:13.280 --> 42:17.680]  storm or endgame or fabled enemies to be as big as loose change you think they want hundreds of
[42:17.680 --> 42:23.920]  millions seeing it no they don't so they're in there right now doing it and then three months ago
[42:27.280 --> 42:34.080]  senator Lieberman sends a open letter to google and youtube owned by google
[42:34.080 --> 42:39.680]  and says we want to give you a list every day of what we want banned anything anti-american
[42:39.680 --> 42:42.960]  anything quote against the troops anything that shows the terrorist that means anybody
[42:42.960 --> 42:49.680]  criticizing them we want it banned and you know what they've done that now and if it shows troops
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.320]  or contractors shooting kids it's taken down it can be on the nightly news they take it down
[42:55.680 --> 43:03.040]  footage of them killing a puppy they take it down footage of troops beating up small children
[43:03.040 --> 43:12.480]  taken down but they leave up the video of the beheadings and things you see it's already here
[43:12.480 --> 43:16.800]  and they're eating around the edges they're they're eating holes in it and picture it as the bill
[43:16.800 --> 43:23.120]  of rights land on a table it's got it's got silverfish all over it government silverfish
[43:23.120 --> 43:27.520]  and industry silverfish eating holes where you can hardly even read the text there's just
[43:27.520 --> 43:35.360]  moth eating holes all over it and they're just scurrying all over the face of it you know what
[43:36.320 --> 43:43.280]  keep playing the club internet censorship for parents that wanted is already available in
[43:43.280 --> 43:48.560]  the form of software that can be installed on their computers it's a useful tool that parents
[43:48.560 --> 43:53.680]  can use to control and monitor their children's online access in conjunction with appropriate
[43:53.680 --> 44:00.800]  supervision this software is already available free of charge from the commonwealth government and
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.600]  has been for quite some time we don't see that there's a case for forcing it on everybody
[44:05.600 --> 44:11.040]  at an isp level now my understanding of that is that the people around the world spend their days
[44:11.040 --> 44:15.520]  and nights working out clever ways of getting around that so kids can get can get around those
[44:15.520 --> 44:21.920]  pretty simply there are ample ways to get around these types of censorship systems
[44:21.920 --> 44:26.080]  and for that matter children enjoy pushing boundaries it's something that they're good at
[44:26.800 --> 44:32.400]  and when children have got the degree of technical sophistication that they do these days it will be
[44:32.400 --> 44:37.680]  fairly trivial to get around any kind of censorship system that the government tries to enforce
[44:37.680 --> 44:43.120]  the only alternative would be making the system so restricted that it would really be unusable
[44:43.120 --> 44:45.680]  okay so why do you think the government is pushing for this deal
[44:45.680 --> 44:52.480]  several reasons first and foremost they went to the election last year promising that they were
[44:52.480 --> 44:56.960]  going to do this and now they're determined to follow through there's also the issue that the
[44:56.960 --> 45:03.360]  government needs the support of the green senators and senator fielding and xenophon
[45:03.360 --> 45:09.200]  who's an independent and from family first to get any controversial legislation through the senate
[45:09.200 --> 45:16.720]  senator fielding from family first has already said that for example he wants access to certain
[45:16.720 --> 45:22.320]  adult material which would be most pornographic websites on the internet blocked for all Australians
[45:22.320 --> 45:28.880]  and senator that's enough and that's what they did when the liquor running cartels wanted to
[45:28.880 --> 45:34.640]  quadruple or even more the price of liquor they went in lobby and this is mainline history paid
[45:34.640 --> 45:40.400]  local christian groups across the united states to go out in lobby for prohibition alcoholism
[45:40.400 --> 45:46.400]  then more than tripled alcohol poisoning went up fivefold it corrupted the police created federal
[45:46.400 --> 45:54.640]  police forces and you know the rest of the story just like they use quote moral do-gooders to ban
[45:54.640 --> 46:00.640]  narcotics soon as they lost prohibition in the 30s they then went and banned cocaine and heroin
[46:00.640 --> 46:06.320]  and things like that which before were available at all your major stores and a lot less people
[46:06.320 --> 46:12.640]  what is about 25 percent of what currently use it use it per capita then uh but it energized
[46:12.640 --> 46:17.920]  the black market destroyed our country just they've done it in china 100 years before i mean they
[46:17.920 --> 46:21.200]  know what they're doing so they brought china down was about shipping opium in the british
[46:21.200 --> 46:27.040]  government while it was illegal that got control the police the corrupt mafia you know the corrupt
[46:27.040 --> 46:31.440]  triads and so they know what they're doing here and so they've got these do-gooders oh there's
[46:31.440 --> 46:38.480]  all this porn on the web it's horrible you're not going to stop people going to that now remember
[46:38.480 --> 46:44.160]  going back about 15 years ago the big push by al gore we got to put internet and all the schools
[46:44.160 --> 46:50.480]  but then internet censorship had to come and government approved filters you know why don't
[46:50.480 --> 46:54.640]  you go to private industry why don't the schools buy the internet filters they want from the hundreds
[46:54.640 --> 47:02.400]  of companies know the feds put out a filtration system and then what came out in the name of
[47:02.400 --> 47:08.160]  stopping plagiarism starting in the sixth grade in the name of looking for violent tendencies
[47:08.160 --> 47:13.760]  the children all do their papers now in english class on word processors and that goes to sinful
[47:13.760 --> 47:19.840]  databases into government files and what your children write is kept and analyzed and used
[47:19.840 --> 47:26.720]  they even have them write under federal grants journals on mommy and daddy and they told mommy
[47:26.720 --> 47:30.880]  and daddy oh this is just a database to see if your child's plagiarizing or if there's any violent
[47:30.880 --> 47:39.360]  talk no it's under a in one of them nationwide a batf or the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms
[47:39.360 --> 47:45.360]  and explosives now they've changed their name you see what's happening here
[47:45.360 --> 47:51.040]  and the government's been caught in the u.s. every time they try to pass internet censorship
[47:51.040 --> 47:55.600]  they go around posting horrible porn on mainline sites they've been caught with hackers another
[47:55.600 --> 48:00.480]  way they plan to attack the web is staged hack attacks false flags shutting down whole systems
[48:00.480 --> 48:09.280]  of banking and industry and claiming al cia did it you see they don't like the fact that
[48:09.280 --> 48:14.880]  prison planet dot com or the having to post or any other alternative site of the thousands of
[48:14.880 --> 48:21.760]  varieties and flavors out there could go to the senate banking website and get the blacked out
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.760]  bailout plan that was most of over 90 percent blacked out and then that bubbled up through the
[48:27.760 --> 48:31.520]  alternative press the mainstream media wouldn't cover that it was all secret and people ask
[48:31.520 --> 48:38.880]  perino the um white house press secretary last week well why why is it secret who's been given
[48:38.880 --> 48:42.480]  the money and she said well it's secret and we should just trust our treasury secretary
[48:42.480 --> 48:48.240]  and so see now that's a mainstream issue but it never would have been if the alternative
[48:48.240 --> 48:59.520]  media wasn't so big it's huge it's giant thousands and thousands of huge websites
[48:59.520 --> 49:05.360]  rivaling major newspapers newspapers going under shutting down not just their their print versions
[49:05.360 --> 49:13.040]  but their their mainline the internet's in trouble because people don't want your bull anymore
[49:13.840 --> 49:18.560]  and so they've got to shut us down they've got to restrict us that's why people say well why do
[49:18.560 --> 49:23.280]  you even care about m&f m m&f m is precious but now they're bringing back the fairness doctrine
[49:23.280 --> 49:29.040]  for the FCC to try to shut down any liberal conservative libertarian anyone who quote states
[49:29.040 --> 49:36.080]  their political view oh you can't do that and they're admitting that that's coming so they're
[49:36.080 --> 49:42.560]  attacking the m&f m they're attacking the internet they're attacking the satellite providers
[49:43.680 --> 49:46.400]  for monopolies they keep us off xm and serious
[49:48.640 --> 49:51.360]  clear channel owns the majority of those two companies that merged this year
[49:52.080 --> 49:57.440]  they officially merged last year but well they stated they merged last year they officially
[49:57.440 --> 50:02.640]  finished that up a few months ago but the point is is that all of this is going on we're fighting
[50:02.640 --> 50:07.520]  to get the word out and we are kicking the mainline media's butt people want reality

[54:02.240 --> 54:08.000]  when they passed that banker takeover bill simultaneously passing banker takeover bills
[54:08.000 --> 54:16.720]  in europe and england what did they do in unison on all the tv news shows and in the
[54:16.720 --> 54:20.480]  newspapers they even sent federal reserve bankers out all over the country to speak to the business
[54:20.480 --> 54:25.440]  groups locally they said this is to get the economy back going things are going to crash
[54:25.440 --> 54:32.560]  we're going to have a depression if we don't this week buy these mortgages well we just went
[54:32.560 --> 54:37.600]  and got the senate bill and by the way for days they wouldn't post it we finally got it
[54:37.600 --> 54:41.840]  and it had those lines in there about no one can review this no one can investigate it no branch
[54:41.840 --> 54:47.920]  of government can even look at it no one can question it can be in the tens of trillions of
[54:47.920 --> 54:54.400]  dollars bloomberg properly reported five trillion ron paul reported five trillion that's the conservative
[54:55.200 --> 55:03.360]  a lot of estimates are ten trill all to them and we told you we told you what they would do
[55:03.360 --> 55:08.960]  do they are looting everything this is tax money just being given to them and what are they doing
[55:11.440 --> 55:16.800]  in the because of international laws they're all quote national branches the national branch
[55:18.480 --> 55:28.960]  of goldman sacks alone in england is being given a seven billion pound that's 14 billion dollar
[55:28.960 --> 55:37.200]  bonuses package that's uk daily mail can you imagine the executives are going to be given
[55:37.200 --> 55:47.920]  14 billion dollars and that's just in the british bailout that's what over 400 billion now
[55:49.040 --> 55:50.560]  that's pounds by the way
[55:50.560 --> 55:59.040]  eight hundred billion dollars being sucked up by criminals this is bank robbery right in front
[55:59.040 --> 56:06.800]  of you and who guards these banks in new york n dc in london riot cops in black mask with machine
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.600]  guns thinking they're guarding everybody from al qaeda when the guys that run al qaeda are inside
[56:11.600 --> 56:19.200]  those banks literally carlile group in the bin laden family in the queen of england owning carlile
[56:19.200 --> 56:25.200]  group these are degenerate evil pieces of trash they're like villains out of a james bond movie
[56:29.200 --> 56:35.200]  but in the real world james bond works for the villains he works for chaos or dr doom or whatever
[56:35.200 --> 56:42.400]  the name is this week or dr no or gold finger here's ap uses for 700 billion dollar bailout money
[56:42.400 --> 56:48.400]  ever shifting first 700 billion rescue for the economy was about buying the valued
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.680]  mortgage-packed securities by the way go ahead and call ventura go ahead and get call him now john
[56:55.280 --> 57:00.880]  try gave his number right go ahead and call him now i want to start him right away first
[57:00.880 --> 57:06.960]  to 700 billion rescue for the economy was about buying the valued mortgage-backed securities
[57:06.960 --> 57:12.480]  from tottering banks to unplug frozen credit markets i told you you'd never get any of it
[57:13.040 --> 57:16.880]  all you're gonna get is a swat team raid folks it's all you get and some fluoride in your water
[57:16.880 --> 57:22.320]  and some mercury in your kid shots and some fluoride in your milk in your cereal then it was
[57:22.320 --> 57:28.080]  about using the 250 billion of it to buy stakes and banks the idea that the banks would use the
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.480]  money to start making loans that's where the money's gone a report service that banks might
[57:32.480 --> 57:37.040]  instead use money to buy other banks what's what they've done i told you they consolidate

[1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:20.400]  appointed for a month after the tragic death of paul wellstone now we're not gonna panhandle
[1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:25.280]  too much here today governor ventura just told me through dean that he wanted to thank everybody
[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:28.400]  because he said that's why he got out of politics is he can't stand raising money but
[1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:34.480]  the other two shysters raised over 30 million dean only raised 50 000 previously now he's raised
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:38.960]  almost that much he's got the tv ads on the day and he has a chance of winning so we're going to
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:42.880]  talk about that in 30 minutes when dean comes on we're going to talk about a host of other issues

[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:54.160]  dean barkley senator barkley dot com is the website joins us but uh first off governor
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:01:01.120]  great audience um oh god i gotta tell you you know alex you got you got loyal people out there
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:06.960]  you got patriotic people that saw the opportunity and rather than sitting on their hands they they
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:12.240]  had an opportunity to do something about it they did i can't thank them enough it's it's going to
[1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:17.600]  make that race up there extremely competitive it's going to go to the wire and dean barkley has a
[1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:22.960]  shot at doing it and uh you know if it can happen it would be it would be just as big as what i did
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:28.480]  98 and then that's what we got to have happened you know you you can't you can't overthrow
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:33.920]  something in a big heave you gotta you gotta chip away at it you gotta go at the foundation of it
[1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:39.120]  the one thing i've learned is the only way to truly change the system in many ways you have
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:44.720]  to become part of the system to change it and that's what we've got to do at all local statewide
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:51.520]  as well as federal elections absolutely governor well we got dean coming up in about 30 minutes
[1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:56.960]  to join us but uh first off i wanted to read you part of an ap headline uses for the 700 billion
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:02.400]  bailout money ever shifting and uh they go on to say first the 700 billion rescue for the economy
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:06.480]  was about buying the value and mortgage back security from tottering banks the unclog frozen
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:11.840]  credit markets then it was about using 250 billion of it to buy stakes in banks then the idea which
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:16.400]  they've done now was that the banks would use the money to start making loans again but then it goes
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:21.760]  into reports that the banks admit they're just keeping it and giving it as bonuses uh including
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:29.520]  goldman sacks 14 billion in bonuses of that money directly given to their executives right now well
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:39.200]  you know alex that that's undescribed i mean how do we throw these people in jail i guess that's
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:44.560]  what it's going to get to get down to something somebody's gonna have to come forward and start
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:50.160]  putting people in prison for things like this this is i mean to me that that's unbelievable but i
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:55.360]  suppose they covered their butts they probably gave it to them with no strings attached so there's no
[1:02:55.360 --> 1:03:01.120]  legal recourse i'm not sure you know i wasn't there to give that to him i'm i'm on the sidelines
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:05.520]  just like all of us reading about it and reaching back and watching my wallet getting well you're
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:10.640]  right you're right governor you're losing huge money in your 401k i would imagine and any stocks
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:15.440]  you've got no you're absolutely right the bill said no one can review it it's all secret no one
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:19.360]  can look at it white house press secretary last friday said it's secret you can't look at it
[1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:25.120]  but in the banks openly announced that they're giving it his bonuses um well that's the problem
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:29.920]  with our government today alex it's so secretive you know we're supposed to be the land home of
[1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:35.440]  the brave land of the free but yet we have a government and especially this bush administration
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.120]  which is the most secretive that there's ever been i mean this looks like makes nixon look like a
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:47.520]  piker man it sure does well you you know what you you know that just because they can get congress
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:51.680]  to say they can commit crimes that that's what nixon said well the president when the president
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:56.320]  commits a crime it's not a crime this is a crime on its face and they can claim that they've all
[1:03:56.320 --> 1:04:02.320]  been given pardons by congress but uh that doesn't flow we need citizen grand juries ron paul has said
[1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:09.360]  to go ahead and start investigations and indictments i i agree fully and i think it fits right into uh
[1:04:09.360 --> 1:04:14.800]  what dr paul talked about with his book using the term revolution and i think it fits right into my
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:21.680]  book where the where the term revolution is likewise in the title you know i i'm coming to the to the
[1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:28.480]  distinct possibility without any thoughts about it alex we need a revolution stay there governor

[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:49.680]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now
[1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:57.840]  live from austin texas alex jones
[1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:09.680]  well it's been great to have a governor in therapy such a big part of the show the last few weeks
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:16.560]  his third visit with us in just the last few weeks but he's off shooting a bunch of tv pilots
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:20.880]  and about to go back to mexico but we'll really enjoy it when he gets back during the break of
[1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:26.240]  the governor was just absolutely uh you know i mean he's aware of it in the press but i was
[1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:32.320]  those headlines even shocked me more that that we were reading about the bankers getting hundreds
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:35.600]  of billions of dollars and then saying it's secret who they're giving it to but then they
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:40.080]  themselves are admitting and i just read some of the headlines here that they're giving billions
[1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:47.920]  of it to themselves per institution as bonuses for their executives and then the white house and
[1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:52.960]  the treasury department have released the documents but they're 90 blacked out governor
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:09:00.320]  well alex i haven't seen this you know if this is all true and i have no reason to believe it's not
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:09.680]  true um i'm speechless over that i mean this is public money this is the public domain when i was
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:15.360]  governor of the state of minnesota we did nothing under the table there wasn't anything going on
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:19.600]  you know that the public didn't have a right to know about in fact when i left office we turned
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:25.440]  every document of my entire four years over to the minnesota archives where anyone can go there
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:31.200]  and read anything including bad emails if they want to read about them but i mean this is not
[1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:37.360]  what our government is supposed to be if this is all true you know what i'm to the point now
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:43.200]  i'm urging everyone to vote against every incumbent vote them all out of office it's the
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:48.560]  only way we can survive this is to vote all incumbents out of office to turn the whole
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:53.600]  thing over and tell something of that magnitude happens we're going to continue to have this
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:10:01.040]  going on well you're right and then let me just bring up a speed on this uh because the mainstream
[1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:08.080]  media has not been covering it this is from the past bill section eight um of uh the portion of
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:16.000]  1937 the bill decisions by the secretary pursuant to the authority of this act are non-reviewable
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  and committed to agency discretion and may not be reviewed by any court or law or any administrative
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:29.600]  agency that's what it says right in the bill yes sir that's uh section eight and this was first
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:35.600]  reported by the hubbing and post dirty secrets of the bailout 32 words that none dare utter but
[1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:43.600]  then it was picked up by mainstream media after that wow i you know like i said the only way
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:48.000]  we can do it is to take back our government at the ballot box you got to vote all the incumbents
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.440]  out of office is my opinion that's that's the way it needs to it needs to it has to be done
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:59.840]  well i mean this is what happens over there like the guys are not alex whether you think
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:04.960]  the good guys are not if they're if they're on board for this type of behavior of government and
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:10.320]  we need a complete a complete flushing of the toilet to put it into blunt terms
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:16.800]  well that's definitely what it is uh i mean that's definitely what's in there
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:23.120]  wow yeah you know well thank goodness we got you out there reading it over the radio because
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:27.360]  i haven't had time to look at that stuff i'm so involved in all the things that i'm doing and
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:32.320]  i'm caught off guard with it alex like i said if that's what's in there and that's how the
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:37.440]  operation of our federal government's operating today then uh we most definitely better have a
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:45.120]  revolution and take our government back oh absolutely it's this happens in history over
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:49.920]  and over again where governments just go completely to seed and they the last official act of any
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:54.880]  dictatorship uh is to loot the treasury this is what happens in third world countries oh yeah
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:12:02.160]  absolutely and and well let's remember third world countries don't have a middle class do they
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:07.520]  no and what are they trying to destroy in the united states today the middle class
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:13.680]  so what you have happening here is they're trying to turn us into a third world country where
[1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:16.400]  there will be only the wealthy and there will be only the poor
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:25.120]  well i'm here googling these terms because i want to find the video of uh perino the
[1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:29.440]  her secretary saying yeah it's all secret you're not allowed to see it and uh you can
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:35.040]  for listeners out there you can just google banking bailout documents blacked out and then
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:40.320]  you can see on the senate website where they posted them and it'll say the top title and
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:46.320]  then it's all blacked out well what's the purpose of even posting it if it's blacked out alex
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:56.400]  to show us that it's blacked out yes well i just i just read the associated press where
[1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:01.280]  they uh haven't doled out one bit of this to uh any banks that are actually in trouble or to
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:06.480]  any mortgages and and and the the banker heads are on the news saying we're just going to sit
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:10.960]  on the money and just keep it and the minutes of paulson's meetings he has every week with the
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:18.880]  banking heads and brokerage heads those are secret well you know like i said if that if if if
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:24.400]  if that's the case and that's how secretive our to me this is this somehow has to be against the
[1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:30.640]  law unless of course like you said they specifically stated in the bill that no one could object or
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:36.400]  interject or anything but you can't take public dollars and be secretive with them that's a basic
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:41.440]  concept that i learned as a mayor you know when you're down at the mayoral level of government
[1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:46.560]  the local government you have to have everything has to be wide open it has to be above board it
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:51.440]  has to be there for any citizen to be able to come and ask questions about it and receive
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:58.480]  answers about it after all alex it's our money it is people keep forgetting that and and people
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:04.560]  also keep forgetting that we are the government the government isn't supposed to be this separate
[1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:10.720]  entity it's supposed to be us well i think it's our money that runs it i think it's the over the
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:15.920]  top nature i mean who would imagine that in the us of a you would have corrupt bankers running
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:21.200]  everything looting it's really over a trillion dollars directly into their own pockets as bonuses
[1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:25.760]  i mean who could imagine that they would terrorize the public and say we're going to have a depression
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:30.880]  we have to have this bill this week to prop up these mortgages and then now they say we're not
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:37.760]  spending it on the mortgages the other wall see to me who is ultimately to blame for it your
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:44.480]  elected officials because if the elected officials pass the bill that allows this to happen they are
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:49.680]  ultimately responsible for it well they were threatened with martial law on the house floor
[1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:54.160]  if they didn't pass it were you aware of that no i was not aware with that i'm only shocking
[1:14:54.160 --> 1:15:01.200]  ventura i bet he didn't believe me john pull up and there's two congressmen um yeah brad yeah
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:05.280]  pull the brad sherman clip first and then i actually had brad sherman on the show uh play
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:10.560]  play brad sherman for the governor do you have that he's pulling it out of the computer yeah
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:14.320]  governor you can't see i can't believe this either and so i don't blame you for having trouble
[1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:21.360]  believing it they were threatened with physical martial law if they didn't pass it well you know
[1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:27.360]  they had a chance to prepare for it because i saw that at uh republican convention in st paul
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:33.440]  because i got a first-hand visual of what truly martial law will look like what did you witness
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:38.720]  that's the way the city of st paul was set up for the republican national convention it was a
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:46.080]  state of martial law what did you witness oh just the security i mean i couldn't even go into the
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:51.760]  city of st paul through my normal exit off the freeway those were all blocked off i had to
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:58.240]  drive completely through the city to the south side exit on the street there double back and then
[1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:05.520]  six eight blocks away from the event you had to get out of your cars uh you were met there with
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:10.880]  your uh with your identification and all that the stuff you were around your necks then you had to
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:16.480]  walk three blocks to the first checkpoint and this was a place with these temporary metal
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:22.640]  fencing not even fencing they're almost like metal walls that they put up and that went in a
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:27.920]  complete circle unbroken all the way around you know they they also charge peaceful demonstrators
[1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:34.560]  under the state terrorism act well and and and you could only walk on designated streets that they
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:40.080]  allowed for anyone that wanted to protest and they and they and what they did is they designated
[1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:45.280]  them off the side streets so that it wouldn't be in the front of the building so therefore the news
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:51.760]  media didn't have to photograph any type of protest going on because they were all shuttered over to
[1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:56.640]  the side of the building on these other streets and you watch the protesting it's hilarious it's
[1:16:56.640 --> 1:17:02.880]  like they're walking down streets that do a little you but it's all in taste with fence and barb wire
[1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:09.600]  and razor wire so you know here's your protest area and what's interesting about that is excuse me
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:15.520]  but these are public streets paid for on the public domain by public dollars and our first
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:21.760]  amendment of the constitution states that you have every right to uh civilly gather and protest
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:26.800]  anywhere in the public domain but again they use 9 11 is the pretext to sell us this is all for
[1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:33.120]  your safety the tariff exactly well that that pre that that overrides the first amendment is that
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:38.720]  while public safety comes first and the argument they give you back is on free speech you're not
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:45.680]  allowed to go into a crowded movie theater and yell fire that's not that's not free speech and that's
[1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:51.600]  that puts people in danger will then panic that's that's their standard argument and they're using
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:58.160]  that it's quite a jump to me but they're using that as the argument as to why they cannot because
[1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:03.120]  of safety they can delegate where you can or can't go well the greater danger is this tyrannical
[1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:10.560]  government let me play the clip this is the congressman here it is city from ohio the only
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:17.520]  way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere that atmosphere
[1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:24.400]  is not justified many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:31.360]  on monday that the sky would fall the market would drop two or three thousand points the first
[1:18:31.360 --> 1:18:36.960]  day another couple thousand the second day and a few members were even told that there would be
[1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:45.360]  martial law in america if we voted no that's what i call fear mongering unjustified proven wrong
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:52.080]  we've got a week we've got two weeks to write a good bill the only way to write to pass a bad bill
[1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:58.160]  keep the panic pressure on all right now and that was the day they passed it and i interviewed him
[1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:02.320]  and other congressmen they were threatened with physical martial law then they get it
[1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:06.320]  and three and a half weeks later they're hoarding all the money giving it to no one but themselves
[1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:15.760]  governor well you know alex i you know i i'm learning of this right now i'm as dumbfounded as
[1:19:15.760 --> 1:19:21.120]  and shocked as anybody who would hear that you know the only thing i wish i wish they'd name
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:26.480]  the names who exactly are the people who were threatened with martial law and who were the
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:31.600]  people who threatened them that's what we got to get to well i had a lot of statements let's get to

[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:03.760]  melon bank why is the government keeping key documents about the bailout secret alternate
[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:10.000]  how's this for bailout transparency boing boing um
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:17.680]  minnesota post wire key details of documents from the bailout secret and i just clicked on
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:23.920]  that article uh there this would be a much bigger scandal and a much bigger deal and and answer the
[1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:30.080]  governor's question we had both the congressman on republican and democrat were told about the
[1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:36.320]  martial law and under house rules they can be suspended these were in committee meetings
[1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:41.440]  and they were told this is being told in secret and they're not allowed to say who said it so again
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:44.160]  governor ventura as you kept saying when you were down here for a couple days with us
[1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:50.880]  whatever you have secrecy is where you have the corruption the cover up of 9 11 the cover
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:54.800]  up of kennedy i mean that's the big evidence of the cover up and now with the banker bill
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:58.880]  they're making it secret but what leaks out is they're just gobbling the money up for themselves
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:04.480]  can you speak to that well again you know i i'm i'm simply hearing what you're telling me alex
[1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:10.480]  and to me this is uh you know people should be going to jail over this if this is true
[1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:16.640]  because again uh all public money in the public domain should be out in the open and whatever
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:22.640]  bills that are passed and what it's spent on it should be clearly labeled with a complete
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:29.920]  paper trail so that anyone can audit it anyone can go through it and and be able to you know
[1:25:29.920 --> 1:25:36.560]  obtain and understand where the public money goes and uh this is corruption beyond belief and
[1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:42.000]  you know if if if our people are voting for this then clearly they need to be put out of
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:47.280]  office and you know again i say you gotta vote against all incumbents also same issue with
[1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:51.600]  the congressman being threatened with marshal law the house rules they were ordered to to
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:57.520]  maintain secrecy again it's that secrecy issue breeding uh tyranny can you get into the brick
[1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:02.560]  walls you've been running into with your uh truthfully pile you know we're out trying to do a
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:10.320]  tv show and basically what it's about is it's uh you know showing uh both sides of a of a conspiracy
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:15.600]  and and the problem we're running into is that is uh getting no cooperation from the government
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:21.520]  whatsoever in any way shape or form and that's about all i can go into for now except the state
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:26.560]  that you know when people act guilty then they wonder why other people think they're guilty
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:33.520]  and if you behave in a certain manner uh that leads to to suspicion and not openness well then
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:40.640]  that's what breeds suspicion and and conspiracy and things like that when you're not open you know
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:46.320]  if if people tell you there's no conspiracy but then they behave otherwise well then how can you
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:51.360]  how can you have any other way of thinking then that they're obviously not being truthful and
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:59.040]  are covering up for something and this hurts every american the banker takeover 911 all of it
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:06.240]  we are all being basically screwed by this well we all certainly are when they take and do a bail
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:12.240]  out to the to these proportions and then they're even saying that this may not even be big enough
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:20.160]  and uh when there's no accountability of of where the money goes that's insane it's utterly
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:26.800]  insane you wouldn't operate that way in your own private household so why on earth would we find it
[1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:32.080]  acceptable to operate that way as our government i mean you're you're unless you're a fool you're
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:37.760]  not going to give huge sums of money to say uncle uncle ben without him telling you what he's going
[1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:42.400]  to use it for and being totally transparent of what do you why do you think governor ventura
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:46.080]  that they're so arrogant now i mean we've never seen corruption like this
[1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:53.440]  this uh uh i well why are they so blatant because they've been able to be blatant ever
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:28:02.160]  since 9 11 i mean they were so blatant with uh uh not answering questions not forming an
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:09.600]  investigative committee until two years later it was stone world uh i've never figured that one out
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:15.440]  having been the leader of a state and in fact when the bridge fell in the water here in minnesota i
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:19.840]  don't know if they're getting an accurate report but they actually commissioned three separate
[1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:25.600]  reports to happen so that all three could be compared to each other to determine you know
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:30.240]  from three different entities what happened with the bridge have they received the final results
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:36.560]  no not yet uh i don't know if they'll be honest or dishonest but if i can't understand how
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:41.920]  is an elected official or the head of a state the head of a country or the head of anything
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:48.240]  that when you have a disaster happen under your watch why you wouldn't immediately have a full
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:53.680]  scale investigation because the most important part is to learn what happened so you could
[1:28:53.680 --> 1:28:58.880]  prevent it from ever happening again instead they actively covered it up and demoted or fired
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:03.760]  FBI agents that blew the whistle but those that actively helped cover up got record cash bonuses
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:09.120]  and promotions well you know i can't i don't know any of that well the head of norad the head of
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:16.880]  norad general mires was promoted to chairman joint jesus staff well there you go stay there
[1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:24.480]  you know hey alex you know what they call that in hollywood lingo what in hot in hollywood that's
[1:29:24.480 --> 1:29:33.040]  called failing your way to the top we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:42.160]  radio network they had the opportunity to speak to my 90 year old grandmother at some length here
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:45.600]  recently and she was talking about the great depression and we were talking about the gas
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:50.320]  prices the food prices this economic uncertainty we're in these you know really kind of perilous
[1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:54.080]  times no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up and she was reminded of the great
[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:58.320]  depression and how in those days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken
[1:29:58.320 --> 1:30:02.080]  and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people who lived
[1:30:02.080 --> 1:30:06.480]  in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how
[1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:10.320]  they didn't have the chickens in the livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know
[1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:14.560]  one thing's certain right now we're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global
[1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:19.280]  food shortage now what can you do to prepare do what i did sell some toys off in the garage go to

[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:17.200]  breathalyzer will also take calls in that hour in the next two hours uh with all those guests
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:22.160]  that are coming up governor Ventura in closing before we talk about Dean Barclay and go to him
[1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:27.520]  i think we're having better radio behind the scenes i mean you're pretty riled up about the
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:33.440]  secret banker takeover here well you know like i said that alex i get focused on the job that i'm
[1:33:33.440 --> 1:33:38.640]  doing and i sometimes don't pay attention to everything going on many like regular americans
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:43.840]  do you you got your life to lead and you you know you don't have every waking moment to
[1:33:43.840 --> 1:33:48.960]  appear at the government you have to have some type of trust with them and if if these things as
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:53.760]  i've heard on your show today and on the main end what they're reporting is true then to me the
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:58.720]  government is completely violating their trust with us and when we get to the point where we
[1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:04.880]  have to sit and and watch every move they make and and every move they make is done in secret so it
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:10.560]  doesn't matter if you watch anyway well my only thing that i can tell all your great listeners
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:16.080]  out there and they indeed are that is that vote against all incumbents it's time to clean house
[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:21.280]  and get these people out of office and take our government back and i know it's a shameful segway
[1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:26.560]  but we got an opportunity in minnesota to do it and again i want to thank all the listeners out
[1:34:26.560 --> 1:34:32.160]  there for giving us the opportunity for dean barkley because ladies and gentlemen i was 10
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:38.800]  points behind with a week to go when i ran for governor of minnesota and i won and and it can
[1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:44.800]  happen again and thanks to all the great listeners on alex's show the opportunities there and dean
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:50.160]  can seize it hopefully next tuesday we'll see an independent senator elected we're gonna go to dean
[1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:56.400]  in one moment but i want to finish up on the statement of rogue government we know the people
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:01.200]  are actually watching them now 95 percent major polls were against the banker bailout bill they
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:07.840]  still did it so what do you do when it becomes just a militarized armed camp uh with barack obama
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:11.760]  even saying he's going to follow all the same policies mccain saying the same thing i mean
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:18.480]  what is this leading to i don't know that's beyond me alex uh i gotta i gotta follow it
[1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:24.560]  keep track of it stay vigilant and see what happens out of this thing i i warned people
[1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:29.440]  i said you know all this talk of change out of the democrats i said it's a bunch of malarkey
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:35.040]  because i said we've had democrats democrats and republicans have been in charge since
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:42.160]  my life began and uh there's no major change involved anybody that believes big changes
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:46.720]  that are going to happen is fooling themselves the only way you're going to get true change
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:51.840]  is to start electing independent people that are not part of these two political gangs well
[1:35:51.840 --> 1:35:56.080]  governor actually disagree with you on a slight point of caveat here and end them we're going to
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:36:02.480]  get changed it's going to get far worse because the agenda well you know i okay you can you can
[1:36:02.480 --> 1:36:07.760]  commit to be on that one if it if it does get worse i'll give it that that it could get worse
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:13.440]  okay but certainly the change won't be in what they're saying for the better okay i'll i'll go
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:18.480]  to my grave on that you're not going to see change to the better in my opinion well we're not starting
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:22.240]  the revolution without you governor and being involved here supporting dean barkley who got you
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:28.320]  into politics and was your campaign uh manager that brought you to the governorship i mean this is
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.400]  all really exciting and i appreciate you reaching out to our audience and i appreciate the audience
[1:36:32.400 --> 1:36:37.360]  i mean if i mean if everybody just gave five bucks which i guess they did 47 000 dollars
[1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:42.320]  whatever's come in uh the tv ads are now going on today you can see it up at senator barkley
[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:46.480]  dot com i just want to restate the facts because there's more to it uh governor and then we're
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:51.520]  going to let you introduce dean and let you go here uh but to be specific you were 10 points
[1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:58.160]  behind uh going into the weekend but you still won because 30 something percent you will remember
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:04.480]  the exact numbers were undecided we have 37 percent in the polls undecided now and dean barkley
[1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:10.080]  is closing the gap in those polls he's doing radio and tv all over the state as an independent up
[1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:16.800]  there so i've got my fingers crossed here well and let's remember minnesota's did it before as you
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:22.960]  said alex they did it with me exactly 10 years ago and believe me the people are twice as angry
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:28.960]  today as they were 10 years ago when i did it it was retaliate 98 and uh we're now
[1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:35.200]  we can double retaliate no wait because uh they're the people are even more angry and that's the
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:40.800]  true way you can venture angers by electing people that they don't want in there people that aren't
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:46.240]  going to shade out everything and people that aren't going to fall victim to their political
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:52.560]  careers because that's what it all comes down to is these people saving their political careers
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:59.920]  they got cushy jobs they like the positions they're in and they will say and do anything to keep them
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:05.600]  to anyone who will keep them in that power position of those cushy jobs and it's time to
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:09.600]  rock them out of there and you know you can do that by electing dean barkley and other
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:13.680]  independence throughout the country well people need to understand like with ron paul that's a big
[1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:18.720]  national because it's a president but a senator is a national position even if they're from the state
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:25.600]  because they vote on national policy and the power of one senator with a bully pulpit to speak out
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:31.280]  and to expose what's happening uh let's bring up dean barkley and then let the governor go here
[1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:36.800]  in a moment okay plus a senator can investigate on their own too if something a senator can start a
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:42.320]  senatorial investigation which is terrific and one senator can do that also i'm gonna say goodbye
[1:38:42.320 --> 1:38:47.600]  good luck dean and uh thanks again alex i'm on my way i gotta get back to work all right governor
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:51.040]  thanks for being with us take care bye bye all right there he goes let's bring dean barkley
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:55.520]  up dean that was the question i was gonna ask you here we had congressman on a few weeks ago
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:59.840]  we're threatened with martial law but but we're not allowed under house rules to say who threatened
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:05.200]  them with that as a senator uh i mean what are you gonna try to do you've already been there for
[1:39:05.200 --> 1:39:09.200]  a month before appointed but if you get elected next tuesday uh what are you gonna do to expose
[1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:14.320]  all this secrecy well i've got the bully pulpit when i see something i'm gonna i'm gonna speak up
[1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:18.880]  they i couldn't silence me what are they gonna do throw me in jail i mean i've got a perfect
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:23.920]  opportunity when i see if that something's not right to tell people about it you know be honest
[1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:28.080]  you know we need a good dose of honesty and truthfulness in in washington right now there's so
[1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:35.680]  much stuff going on right now it's unbelievable well i was just going over with jesse what's
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:41.200]  happening with the bank or bailout bill being secret but the parts that are public they're giving
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:46.960]  tens of billions per bank in bonuses from the bonus money and well that's what it is that the the
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:51.200]  banker bonus is what the bailout was and they're just openly admitting they're keeping it for
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:57.200]  them personal selves i mean they're really rubbing it in well i heard i and i read this
[1:39:57.200 --> 1:40:01.920]  in england on this paper in england reported it about a week ago they're projecting to pay
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:06.960]  over 70 billion dollars in bonuses from these same banks that we just gave a hundred and
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:13.600]  fifty billion dollars to i mean it's outrageous it's just unconscionable what's going on i mean
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:19.920]  my god i mean how much more blatant can they get i mean this is just incredible dean i know you
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:25.360]  wanted to come back on and thank the audience and i want to thank them as well um i mean oh yes i mean
[1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:29.440]  it without you without your listeners i would not be on the air i mean we made a product
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:34.320]  tv ad on tuesday right after the show we had enough money to do that and now we're starting to air
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:38.720]  tonight we're going to unveil it at three o'clock this afternoon if wasn't for your listeners this
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:43.440]  would not be happening so we've got a shot at this in minnesota right now because unfortunately
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:47.680]  a lot of people don't think you're credible month they see on television well that's going to happen
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:52.240]  right now and and you know every every dollar that we're getting from now until tuesday is going
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:56.640]  in to increase that buy so you know people want to help out even more we certainly would take it
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:03.360]  to increase the buy we've already made senator barkley dot com www dot senator barkley dot com
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:08.080]  and give out that number yeah the phone number if you want to call in if you don't have internet
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:14.160]  access is seven six three four one seven nine nine seven two and we've got people on the phones
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:18.560]  right now ready to take your call so uh you know whether it's five dollars ten dollars whatever you
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:23.840]  can afford uh you could put me over the top if we could double that radio or that tv buy you know
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:27.360]  that's twice the chance i'm going to pull this one off i think we've got a shot anything can
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:31.280]  happen in this election i think what we did with jessie ten years ago we're going to do again
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:35.920]  well i wish i would have known how close this race was earlier but you know it's hard to
[1:41:35.920 --> 1:41:41.760]  pay attention to everything but it is important to senate race your competitors have got 30 plus
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:46.640]  million and you'd only raised 50 000 in the previous few months before this and you'd already
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:50.720]  gotten within 10 points of them with that imagine what this 40-something grand is going to do
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:55.760]  no it's just been a godsend and like i say i i couldn't be more thankful for the people who
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:41:59.840]  listened to your show they could actually change history in this election minnesota this is more
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:05.440]  than just minnesota this is sending a message to washington for the whole country that we've had
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:09.200]  it with the way you're behaving you're had it by destroying our country there's two-party
[1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:14.400]  partisanship stuff that never ends while all our problems go unresolved they do these little
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:18.800]  banker deals and we find out you know after the fact what's really happening and we got to send
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:23.360]  some people there that consider themselves to be americans for once in the same you know in in our
[1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:28.960]  lifetime not not members of the their political party also our listeners can even if they can't
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:34.240]  donate five dollars they can go get the tv ad only have several others up on the website
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:40.320]  senator barkley.com is the new tv ad up there so people can you know email uh in around all
[1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:45.520]  their friends it will be up by three o'clock i'm not sure i've been i've been out all over the
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:50.560]  state i haven't even looked at my website uh in about a day but it will be up sometime today
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:54.160]  so i could be up there right now but it's probably going to be up around three four o'clock this
[1:42:54.160 --> 1:43:01.040]  afternoon so that's another thing and if people have friends and family in minnesota yes call them
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:06.400]  even if you live in texas or new york or south dakota or california or i mean wherever you live
[1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:11.520]  it let's say you're in england working call your friends and family call them in minnesota and tell
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:16.160]  them look you need to vote for senator dean barkley he's a great guy the two parties are selling a
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:20.560]  sound he's going to go investigate the banker bailout he's going to end the war in iraq he's
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:24.560]  going to you know push decriminalized drugs people could say oh well you know it's all
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:30.000]  all over new world order that look it's over when the fat lady sings folks we're fighting
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.960]  we're waking people up i mean everything the new order is doing is so unpopular right now
[1:43:34.960 --> 1:43:40.480]  and we just have to stand up and just the just the reflex just the action of standing up and
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:45.440]  saying no and supporting it's that fighting spirit we may not win this time but we'll win next time
[1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:50.960]  in other fights it's all about taking action we know that if good people hadn't been fighting
[1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:55.040]  tyranny for hundreds of years that we wouldn't even be alive today we wouldn't even have the
[1:43:55.040 --> 1:44:00.800]  system we have today as bad as it is we owe the people that stood up to evil for what we do have
[1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:06.080]  that's good in this world so i couldn't have said it better myself but our founding fathers
[1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:11.200]  didn't quit against all odds they fought you know to give us what we have now and that's the least
[1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:16.560]  we can do is to keep some freedom you know keep some honesty and integrity you know in our government
[1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:21.360]  and turn it around we've got the greatest former government in the world but you know we've lost
[1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:25.840]  our way because we've let them get away with it now it's time to stand up quit bitching about it
[1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:29.680]  and do something about it and we can start by electing me that'd be a star but that's just a
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:34.000]  start then others can follow we've got to do something to turn this country in a different
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:38.320]  direction then it's heading right now because it's heading in the wrong direction let's go back
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:43.760]  briefly just people can see that as a kind of like a signpost or a roadmap of what happened before
[1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:49.120]  how did you and jessie ventura meet and and you know i know you headed up his campaign and got him
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:55.120]  to run i mean tell the story of that campaign briefly yeah well it all started when i ran to
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:45:01.120]  get the the independence party minnesota major party status in 1996 i ran for the senate there
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:06.880]  to get the five percent vote total we needed to become a major party and jessie i recruited uh
[1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:13.920]  to be the honorary chair of that campaign in 1996 and while i was marching in my hometown
[1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:19.200]  port of july parade in anondale minnesota jessie marched it with me or walked it with me and i
[1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:23.920]  noticed that everybody was cheering for him and ignoring me and at that point on the light bulb
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:28.560]  went on i said i wonder if this would equate to political popularity and i turned to him and said
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:32.560]  you know the wrong guy's running you're on the next he laughed at me at the time and said he
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:36.960]  didn't want to go to washington i said well you don't have to the governor's races in two years
[1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:41.520]  i worked on them for a year to convince him to do it ran his campaign and we changed history
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:47.120]  it worked well you certainly did so people understand that you know you're the brains
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:52.080]  you're the mind that basically hatched this originally and that scared a lot of incumbent
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:58.320]  governors that uh in a bad way spurred sports and anger to run but you know regardless uh it
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:04.400]  showed people uh what can happen and that these people are not invincible so i sure hope that you
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:08.960]  win next tuesday uh when are we going to get some new polls out to see if things are continuing to
[1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:13.840]  narrow oh i'm sure they're going to be out in the next few days or not and at this point in time i
[1:46:13.840 --> 1:46:18.560]  don't think the polls matter in minnesota you know whether i go up a couple or not the fact is a
[1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:25.120]  minnesota they're predicting an historic voter turnout 80 percent which is 20 more than ventures
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:33.360]  was and his was a historic high yeah that's the key because you got 37 undecided absolutely
[1:46:33.360 --> 1:46:37.200]  and they if they're undecided means they're not enamored by al franken or norm colman or the
[1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:42.880]  democrat of the republican and that's why this tv campaign was so critical to give you know to
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:48.000]  like i say a lot of people based about base your viability i'm seeing you on television and that's
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:52.960]  why i've been trying so hard to do that it's probably sad that we have to say that but it's true
[1:46:52.960 --> 1:46:57.520]  we did the same thing with jesse well 10 years ago we started running his first tv ad
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:47:01.920]  on the thursday before the election and that's exactly the same time frame we're doing here
[1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:06.400]  and i think the same thing can happen again and like jesse said i heard earlier people are so much
[1:47:06.400 --> 1:47:11.920]  more angry now than they were 10 years ago and he was he was 10 points behind on the friday
[1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:16.880]  eight points behind the day of the election he won by how many points he won by he won
[1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:24.480]  for you won by 2.37 to 35 he went from about 26 27 percent the polls to 37 well i mean you got
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:29.040]  congress with a nine percent approval rating both parties are hated how could you not win
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:34.480]  how could people not vote for somebody who's basically lined up with ron paul well you know
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:38.880]  people sit there and play these mind games with themselves i'm sure the vast majority minnesotans
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:43.440]  like what i'm saying and would like to vote for me but somehow they start thinking well
[1:47:43.440 --> 1:47:48.160]  i don't know if he could win so if i vote for him my worst enemy which could either be the
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:52.720]  republican or the democrat might win and but i can't have that so i'm going to hold my nose
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:57.520]  and vote for my second choice out of fear rather than who they want to vote for and that's what
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:01.120]  minnesotans are going through right now if they're going to buy into that again but they're going
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:05.360]  to actually for once vote for someone that they can believe in rather than against someone who
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:09.040]  they fear and that's going to be the question well if they vote for what they believe in i'm
[1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:14.080]  going to win if they vote the other way i may not well people get the government they deserve i guess
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:18.720]  but one thing listeners can do also even if you don't live in minnesota pick a talk station
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:23.440]  listen to it online this afternoon and throughout the weekend and call in the talk shows
[1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:27.120]  on whatever issue they're talking about and then it'll be the election and bring up senator dean
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:31.680]  barkley and say look he's against the baker bailout but the others are for it and just say
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:37.120]  senator dean barkley you know senator barkley dot com uh and i think you know that's effective
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:42.720]  right there i mean look we're in this fight we're fighting as hard as we can and uh you know i'm
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:46.560]  just trying to find a silver lot lining in this whole election which is a nightmare and a senatorial
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:52.400]  race is a big deal our special interest wouldn't afford 30 plus a million into those other two
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:57.440]  you know that tells you who the good guy is uh that's dean barkley look at the other political
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:03.840]  whores getting that's got to be hundreds of times what you've gotten all right now both both my
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:10.080]  opponents have spent 20 million so it's 40 million dollars that they spend themselves and and the
[1:49:10.080 --> 1:49:15.280]  countless i can't believe the number of special interest ads that are going on it's got to be
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:20.000]  another hundred million dollars that they're spending in the state on just the 527s every
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:25.280]  special interest in the world has their own 527 at work here running ads either against the
[1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:30.480]  howler for normal you know it's just incredible the amount of money that's being spent in here
[1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:34.720]  to prop up and meanwhile the public thinks it's about that horse race they don't understand the
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:40.720]  system putting money into the left right paradigm that's the conspiracy the fact that they're running
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:45.680]  our country right now especially we all know it you know there's no independence when they go there
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:49.840]  they got to pay all these people back and that's what's wrong with our country 40 million it was
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:55.920]  30 million a week ago 40 million against your 50 000 now now close to it and i'm with them
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:01.360]  striking range almost incredible isn't it but now you're almost to 100 uh gram with the with the

[2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:31.760]  none dare call a conspiracy in the early seventies the tens of millions of i know i mean just millions
[2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:36.160]  of those books was my memory says four million five million i can't remember the point is millions
[2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:40.240]  of the book went out woke up so many people including myself been involved in the fight
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:46.880]  you know back when jeb or griffin started out worked with him a real icon and uh... we just
[2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:50.880]  appreciated him coming on the first thing i want to talk about bob
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:54.000]  i want to break down the economy this hour and take calls on that issue
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:57.200]  the international forecaster dot com people can learn more but
[2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:00.880]  uh... a p is reporting in it like you wrote it or something that
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:05.120]  the bankers are keeping the money and using it for personal bonuses
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:10.080]  that it's over a trillion and that uh... they're blocking out all the documents not even letting
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:14.240]  people know who's getting the money but the banks are so arrogant they openly brag and say yeah
[2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:18.960]  we're we're taking it for bonuses and in england it's the same thing just goldman sacks england
[2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:26.160]  branch fourteen billion dollars seven billion pounds being given to their executives alone
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:30.160]  from the from the four hundred billion dollar bailout over there i mean bob this is
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:36.160]  this is just the the corruption is just off the charts in our face why why are they so arrogant
[2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:42.160]  well because they run the world and they are the alumni and they do what they want to do
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:47.120]  do and uh... nothing is said about the money that went from
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:53.600]  leeman's office in new york uh... in london to new york uh... the day before they went down
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:02:00.480]  and that money as far as i know is disappeared uh... switching gears and going back to uh...
[2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:04.080]  the banks they've received a hundred and sixty three billion dollars
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:10.880]  and as you say it's a big bonus time and not only that half of that money over the next three years
[2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:17.680]  will be used in order to pay dividends to the shareholders and some of the biggest shareholders
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:24.320]  are people who are on their boards or offices of their corporations and in addition to that
[2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:32.000]  uh... they can use that money as they see fit now the government has told them that they should
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:38.880]  use the money to expand loans uh... they are going to use that money to bolster their balance sheet
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:44.880]  and at the same time uh... they could go into the markets and speculate with it
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:51.440]  such as buying uh... from time to time when instructed by the treasury department or the fed
[2:02:52.160 --> 2:02:57.440]  to buy the dow jones industrial average and make it go up 900 points in one day
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:03.760]  those are some of the things that they can do and so the whole thing is a giant scam
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:11.040]  and it's admittedly a scam i mean they said past this three and a half weeks ago or there will
[2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:15.600]  be a depression they threaten martial law in the congress and then they get the money and they
[2:03:15.600 --> 2:03:19.040]  hoard it all and only give it to themselves and now the banks are saying they're just going to
[2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:24.480]  keep it and use it for bonuses openly just just throwing the gauntlet down saying we run you
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:29.280]  well you know you've got a g which has been
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:36.960]  been a cia front since the second world war actually before that uh... and uh... they received
[2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:41.920]  a hundred twenty two billion dollars and nobody knows where it went uh... they also raised
[2:03:42.560 --> 2:03:50.640]  twenty billion dollars in stock and debt in may so they received a hundred and forty three billion
[2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:55.920]  dollars and they said that they didn't have any serious problems when they told the people
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:01.600]  that they should buy their stock and their debt and now we find out that not only do they have
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:08.240]  problems that they didn't admit that were hidden but they were in fact bankrupt and
[2:04:08.880 --> 2:04:12.400]  now we've already poured in this one hundred and twenty three billion
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:18.080]  from the tax pay and now they want more money and they won't tell you where the money went
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:28.800]  absolutely amazing our guest is bob Chapman and folks you think this is bad they're just
[2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:33.360]  going to do more that's what tyrants do i mean they are doing whatever they want whenever they want

[2:08:36.480 --> 2:08:40.960]  intensely debated in china but it's not been an english language yet and see his girlfriend
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:48.960]  and as a chinese master's i mean a phd student there in sheffield and uh she speaks fluent
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:52.880]  english she says an english accent she's really english but her family a lot of lives in china
[2:08:52.880 --> 2:08:56.400]  so paul has been to china and he's got a lot of inside insights on that
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:08.480]  oh my gosh oh my god you know what watson go ahead and call in now let me just tell them
[2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:12.640]  call in now because i've been seeing rumblings of this
[2:09:15.360 --> 2:09:18.880]  this is what the pentagon's talking about is the stage crisis and it turns out
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:25.520]  it's on mainstream news in china paul watson will call in now sorry to do this to you bob but
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:32.240]  let me get your take on this now colon pal uh biden uh the british prime minister german
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:39.200]  chancellor they've all been saying a huge crisis is coming we have to do it the 21st and 22nd 23rd uh
[2:09:39.200 --> 2:09:46.000]  it's going to make uh obama very unpopular but it has to be done and most the experts are
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:50.480]  hinting and saying it's a military churnoff is saying it we already saw him watch through their
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:56.160]  proxy a sneak attack two months ago a month and a half ago on 888 against russian forces
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:01.680]  i mean they're openly stealing all the money in front of us they're openly sneak attacking russia
[2:10:01.680 --> 2:10:06.800]  and then telling us russia's snuck attack on cnn what's next bob you were in military intelligence
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:12.800]  what are we dealing with complete psychos well if you remember about a month ago
[2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:18.720]  with paul craig robbins we run together he spent five minutes telling us how insane these people
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:25.840]  were and he was there in the inside he knows these people and so uh i'd go with him knowing
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:30.640]  you know he certainly knows what's going on inside well he saw this a lot with roman emperors
[2:10:30.640 --> 2:10:36.160]  ashtek kings countless others every two or three of them you'd get just a user they were despot
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:42.000]  but you get complete lunatics and who just loved death destruction war trying to destroy
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:46.320]  themselves and i think that's what we've got going on is just megalomania i mean openly
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:50.880]  trillions missing from the pentagon gobbling up trillions stealing everything i mean just
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:58.080]  what are they doing bob they're doing exactly what you're saying they're doing and uh
[2:10:58.080 --> 2:11:05.040]  if they do you sell how do we stop it when you have a congress that goes along with the program
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:11.440]  because they're all well paid off or they're compromised and so uh i i don't know we can
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:17.520]  try to change congress uh by getting rid of the incumbents with the exception of a handful
[2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:24.240]  including ron paul and then it could finish who stands up against these people uh but other than
[2:11:24.240 --> 2:11:29.760]  that uh if that doesn't work there's only one thing left to save our republic
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:44.960]  well bob the the syrians were reaching out to israel wanting to sign a peace and energy deal
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:49.680]  i mean who wouldn't want to trade with israel the richest country out there um
[2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:55.600]  um and they're about to sign the peace deal yesterday so two days before that a sneak attack
[2:11:56.560 --> 2:12:00.400]  across their border landing in a village and shooting a bunch of people including children
[2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:05.600]  and then this stupid statement about oh it was the number 10 in al qaeda or something
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:10.320]  when they admit the admittedly have al qaeda attacking the iranians and the iranians sit
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:16.240]  there and take all these staged attacks i mean it's it's it clearly they're trying to escalate
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:25.840]  crises and that's to be cloud the financial and economic issues they get people thinking about
[2:12:25.840 --> 2:12:31.600]  something someplace else while they go in and do what they want with taxpayer money and not only
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:36.720]  in the united states but virtually throughout the world and they steal everything in sight
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:44.480]  and this is a major move to a dictatorial power all right bob here with us for the rest of the
[2:12:44.480 --> 2:12:50.720]  hour i want to bring up paul watson and uh he's a great asset organization his brother
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:55.840]  is a degree political scientist from london and also is doing a report on this right now
[2:12:56.800 --> 2:13:03.280]  and this is inside info from uh china being heavily debated in the chinese news but that's
[2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:08.800]  as much as i know uh paul has never contacted me to say i want on the show uh so this must be big
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:14.880]  paul watson paul uh from prisonplanet.com what is going on hello alex good to be on
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:21.360]  um yeah we've based obviously you know my girlfriend's chinese and she sometimes does
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:27.360]  translations from chinese media because there's a ton of information that comes out in chinese
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:34.240]  media which just never makes it into english language media and the reports are and this is in
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:43.440]  the top chinese mainstream news outlet which is sohu.com and they cite french media news sources
[2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:49.040]  and there's a there's an intense debate about this in china right now and the story is that
[2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:58.000]  the rand corporation recently presented a uh proposal to the pentagon in which it lobbied
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  for a war to be started with a major foreign power in an attempt to stimulate the american economy
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:12.800]  and prevent a recession and basically people in china are freaking out about this because
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:17.680]  they're saying that it's likely that it's either going to be china or russia
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:23.120]  well then we always learn about this months later but we know about the sneak attack on Russia
[2:14:23.120 --> 2:14:29.680]  and again folks they got 10 000 nukes topolims and they're openly nato's announced that they
[2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:34.560]  have a preemptive strike that they may sneak attack russia and then russia comes out and says well
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:38.240]  we're going to defend ourselves and the media spins that and says russia's threatening to blow
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:42.400]  the us to kingdom come that's why the russians are moving back into cuba they're moving into
[2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:46.560]  venezuela they've moved nukes into venezuela they're in the gulf of mexico bob Chapman
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:53.680]  it's all there they're trying to defend themselves and as you said earlier the mad men are in
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:15:00.080]  washington and in a russia and china they just want a better life and you know they're they're
[2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:07.040]  a you know basic disagreement agreements that politically and economically uh but the the
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:12.800]  moving forces in washington and in europe for that matter and they're just crazy
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:20.160]  what they are is mad dog evil uh paul give us more details how long till a story is on prison
[2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:26.240]  planet dot com the story is being written so it'll be up right after i get off there but to flesh
[2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:33.840]  you out a bit basically most people will know who the rand corporation are basically an an NGO
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:40.240]  a non-governmental organization think tank with uh deep ties to the u.s military industrial
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:45.200]  conflict yeah there's high level of the cfr interlocked and basically everything they recommend
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:50.480]  is policy this is the king pin think tank for ibm the defense department for everybody
[2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:57.360]  right and it's got interlocking trusty connections with the the ford rockefeller and carneggy
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:04.000]  foundations as well now that one of the top directors of rand at the moment is frank charles
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:10.160]  carlucci the third who is the uh former defense secretary and the former deputy director of the
[2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:16.800]  cia and some some of your listeners will remember the fact that he was also chairman of the carl
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:25.440]  aisle group from 89 to 2005 which of course covered the uh covered 911 and it's after my and let's
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:31.040]  explain that they're the ones that lowered defense stock saying it was all over after the gulf warren
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:36.160]  91 then it literally bought up the majority of them and and what the one in guardian report queen
[2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:41.680]  of england bin laden family in the bush is of the chief holders of carlisle exactly enough to
[2:16:41.680 --> 2:16:46.640]  deny the line but after the invasion of afghanistan their stock went through the roof so apparently
[2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:53.520]  now rand and the carl aisle group are not amused at the fact that the stock market is crashing
[2:16:53.520 --> 2:17:00.320]  and uh they want a new war to reinvigorate it they said that i mean that's evil enough but why can't
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:04.960]  they pick venezuelan or something why does it have to be russia and china this is the thing
[2:17:04.960 --> 2:17:11.760]  other mines this is the thing alex because the proposal directly states and stresses the fact
[2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:18.240]  that this new war that they want cannot be with a smaller country on the scale of afghanistan or
[2:17:18.240 --> 2:17:25.120]  iraq in fact with the analysis that the chinese media are doing they entertain the possibility
[2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:31.280]  that it could be north korea but it was ruled out because rand wants something bigger a bigger
[2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:38.240]  scale than an attack on north korea would be just bastards so they want they want a major war with
[2:17:38.240 --> 2:17:44.080]  an influential world power madman i mean i just you did what is it ever end they're publicly
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:49.360]  stealing all the money we're trying to start world war three they snuck attack russia a month and a
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:56.560]  half ago bob Chapman i mean i i can't stay calm anymore well when you're as old as i am you'll
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:18:04.560]  learn to but anyway uh it is that bad and i think you know there's a number of reasons for this major
[2:18:04.560 --> 2:18:13.760]  war which uh the gentleman is just uh paul as just said and uh but you know there's other aspects to
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:21.120]  this is a great profit making power uh by financing the war from behind the scenes the uh the industrial
[2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:28.080]  complex and then there is a variant of another very important factor if we're having a depression
[2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:34.480]  which is a good possibility that we will uh this will take many people off of the streets and it
[2:18:34.480 --> 2:18:42.080]  will put those people into the battlefield and many many of them will get killed and and it will
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:47.520]  unify the american people during the implosion of the economy going into the new world order it'll
[2:18:47.520 --> 2:18:54.560]  be shut up we're in a war you know they want they you know this part of the culling process here as
[2:18:54.560 --> 2:19:00.400]  well uh they want to wipe out out as many people in the world as they can and this is part of that
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:05.760]  process like we saw it in the war since the turn of the century world war one world war two and in
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:13.120]  the other uh intermediate wars we'll call them and that's part of this as well all right bob

[2:23:45.600 --> 2:23:49.760]  i want to ask bob jettman how they're gonna get away with starting a war with russia china or both
[2:23:49.760 --> 2:23:56.960]  having one of their proxies started but paul watson walk through again this article you're
[2:23:56.960 --> 2:24:04.480]  about to post on prisonplanet.com in the different facets well it's the basic details of this chinese
[2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:11.520]  mainstream media as well as french mainstream media but no english language media whatsoever
[2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:20.400]  are reporting that the rand corporation has presented a proposal to the pentagon which
[2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:27.600]  basically asks that the 700 billion dollars that has been e-marked for the bailout we know that
[2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:35.920]  numbers anything up to five trillion or more instead be used to finance a new war against a major
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:42.640]  foreign power under the pretext that that would reinvigorate the stock market and the economy
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:53.440]  now the targets of that new war are russia and china also mentioned was iran and another
[2:24:53.440 --> 2:25:00.400]  middle eastern country and even japan was mentioned as a possibility for the reason
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:08.720]  that japan holds the most u.s. debt oh my god so rand is lobbying the pentagon to attack
[2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:16.080]  russia or china but they stressed in the proposal that the war could not be against a small country
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:24.160]  like afghanistan or iraq and in fact the analysts for the chinese media said that north korea could
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:29.520]  have been a target but ruled it out because the proposal directly stresses that it has to be a
[2:25:29.520 --> 2:25:36.240]  large influential foreign power now paul be sure to make the point that rand is at the highest level
[2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:41.280]  of decision-making i mean they they are the most important think tank the executive action
[2:25:41.280 --> 2:25:47.280]  militarily to the ones that commissioned 20 years ago at least to have mit come up with what they call
[2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:52.240]  the control grid over the american people that now last year in mit magazine the face scanning
[2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:57.840]  cameras the police training us rand rand wrote up how to domesticate us at the airports train us
[2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:03.200]  to have no rights than do it on the streets very cold-blooded very wicked and most of what they
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:08.640]  propose is implemented they propose the microwave guns they proposed having delta force and police
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:14.320]  train and in the military do drills in in cities 20 years ago to condition us for the future
[2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:19.840]  military occupation and now bob chappan what concerns me most is we have all these world
[2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:26.240]  leaders saying huge military crisis coming in the new year that will be very unpopular
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:30.400]  and i guess they already snuck attack russia through georgia do you think they're really
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:35.840]  that that out of control that i mean that's what peanut says they say we've got the power
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:42.880]  why not go for it i mean just totally evil on the face of it well i think that because of these
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:49.280]  cryptic messages from paul as an example uh... that others already know about this who are in
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:57.200]  the inner circle so to speak and i think he was trying to give a warning and uh... like eisenhower
[2:26:57.200 --> 2:27:06.160]  did at the end of his term and uh... i i believe that uh... they are going to do it i don't see
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:11.920]  anywhere else like that to go i mean if you look at what's going on worldwide the u.s treasury and
[2:27:12.560 --> 2:27:18.720]  the fed reserve are through swap agreements or loans are supplying every government in the world
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:24.640]  with money to keep them afloat some of them are bankrupt some of them aren't uh... some of the
[2:27:24.640 --> 2:27:30.480]  banks are are bankrupt some of them aren't and the same thing in the financial field whether it's
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:34.880]  in brokerage houses investment banks or insurance companies but how do you i know but how do you
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:42.560]  attack people who've got intercontinental ballistic supersonic missiles well they obviously are willing
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:49.600]  to give up cities like uh... new york and maybe even washington and uh... other major cities uh...
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:57.040]  to take out moscow and and other large russian or changhai uh... chinese cities look if they go
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:04.720]  after russia china is going to get involved there's no question and so it would be russia and china
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:11.520]  against the united states and their legal allies and quite frankly i think it's a war that we could
[2:28:11.520 --> 2:28:18.720]  easily lose well yeah i mean the special forces are going to the ground troops are going to start
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:24.640]  using theater locals nukes anti-personnel nukes and then the chinese and russians are just going
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:34.320]  to pull them out it'll escalate to the highest level of destruction and uh... half half the people
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:39.040]  in the world could die well this is in the nineteen knows what what's going to be left because
[2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:44.160]  of all the radio activity that's going to be in what used to be major cities i'll tell you what
[2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:47.520]  concerns me i've always watched people's body language and i've watched a lot of russian
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:52.640]  body language by their generals their generals look completely freaked out and scared but in a
[2:28:52.640 --> 2:28:56.240]  strong way they go on tv and they say we know you're encircling us with nukes we know you're
[2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:01.280]  getting ready to sneak attack when we pull these clips up do not do it we've got special forces
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:08.160]  basically in your country's a lot of russians are going home now a lot of chinese are going home
[2:29:08.160 --> 2:29:13.280]  the ten richest jews in israel left this year stay there bob chapman stay there paul
[2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:19.600]  folks we're not the ones saying this they're the ones doing it and i know you can't believe

[2:33:17.520 --> 2:33:30.960]  you remember last friday a cnbc host
[2:33:32.080 --> 2:33:36.160]  big head of a huge investment firm come to pull up the prison planet dot com article
[2:33:38.640 --> 2:33:43.600]  said that the illuminati was behind the banker crash paul do you have that article in the in
[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:49.760]  the name of the uh investor it wasn't an article it was a youtube clip
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:54.240]  no i know that but i mean you posted it and then i don't have it in front of me what's his name on
[2:33:54.240 --> 2:33:59.680]  that video i give me a minute i'll find it for you i don't want to go back to bob chatting before

[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:09.040]  let you get out of here and finish the article and come back on uh later but but but bob how could
[2:34:09.040 --> 2:34:14.080]  this elite think that they could start wars with russia and china or sneak attack on a month and a
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:20.240]  half ago i mean i mean we've always had corrupt evil people running things for the last 60 70
[2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:26.880]  80 years but it it i mean it really seems like they're divorced from reality well yeah and we
[2:34:26.880 --> 2:34:33.280]  we've said that over and over again and that's the only conclusion uh why people would do such
[2:34:33.280 --> 2:34:39.280]  things uh i think there's another aspect to this that most people wouldn't notice in this
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:48.800]  warfare and you mentioned the situation georgia in south of sentier and and the other province there
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:58.240]  and yes that was a baited attempt to bring russia into a full blown war which didn't work
[2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:04.880]  uh at least for this side so to speak but after that uh we had the credit crisis
[2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:12.720]  which has been going on for more than a year now but all of a sudden uh money was being pulled out
[2:35:12.720 --> 2:35:20.160]  of russia and the russian stock market uh get beat up very very badly like china had before that
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:29.200]  and um russia had a cash crisis and they had gold and foreign exchange reserves
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:36.880]  i would say perhaps three months ago of just under 600 billion dollars which is the third
[2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:43.920]  largest in the world and the figures i get in this morning for the weekend at october 24
[2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:54.080]  was 484.7 billion so i think that the people within the aluminum structure have been not
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:59.600]  only from the united states but from europe have been waging financial war on russia for the last
[2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:05.120]  few months and i think that's part and parcel of this well look at this headline this morning
[2:36:05.120 --> 2:36:11.920]  on cnbc squawk box jeffrey sought of raymond james a huge firm stated that polson and the
[2:36:11.920 --> 2:36:17.520]  illuminati of the country are responsible for the economic chaos that has been unfolding he's one
[2:36:17.520 --> 2:36:21.920]  of the directors of that multi-billion dollar company here he is talking about the illuminati
[2:36:21.920 --> 2:36:26.240]  running all this here we are this at least you're getting back to the point where you can start to
[2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:32.960]  look at fundamentals and that's good news what happened i think you're in a liquidation phase
[2:36:32.960 --> 2:36:37.280]  i think christian had it exactly right i think there's a bunch of wrong-footed moves by hank
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:43.040]  bolson and the illuminati of the country if you will and i think we're paying for it right now
[2:36:43.040 --> 2:36:49.600]  what i mean and they're saying stuff like that all over tv and all these fiction tv shows are
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:56.000]  about the evil new world order coming over and and trying to take over and and and and uh
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:01.280]  biden's calling for a new world order twice yesterday i mean they're just out in the open bob
[2:37:01.280 --> 2:37:08.000]  bob yeah and they know we know it and your program and programs like yours have been responsible
[2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:14.640]  for the word getting to the public and for that gentleman to have said what he said on that program
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:23.040]  was absolute dynamite i mean when ed griffith and and gary alan and alan stang and i started
[2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:29.280]  back in the early 60s i mean nobody talked about the illuminati except people who had studied it
[2:37:29.280 --> 2:37:35.840]  now the world knows and that's wonderful they're out in the open we're out in the open uh let's go
[2:37:35.840 --> 2:37:40.800]  for it let's go at it well bottom line the new world order always wants to keep the west down
[2:37:40.800 --> 2:37:47.520]  any independent western nation under the control the anglo-american uh dutch system so britain in
[2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:53.440]  the u.s openly funded the bolsheviks murdered 60 million people uh got control of it the russians
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:37:58.000]  threw that off and and and and then we had this fake right wing propaganda that oh there's still
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:02.400]  commies they're going to get us meanwhile you know the government's really funding communism here
[2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:06.160]  and now they're going after russia as hard as they can i'm not saying russia's run by good people
[2:38:06.160 --> 2:38:10.000]  either the point is there nothing compared to the new world order so they're trying to start a war
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:15.840]  with them because they can't have a unipolar world uh with sovereign individuals uh and it's
[2:38:15.840 --> 2:38:21.920]  because they hate the people of the west i mean it's it's bottom line and they've also destroyed
[2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:26.640]  their own system through their greed and this is not the first time that they've done it they've
[2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:32.960]  done it over and over again uh they've only been hoisted on their own patat as far as i know twice
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:38.800]  in the last thousand years which was in 1348 and then in the early early 1600s yeah the
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:42.560]  tempers and then we're gonna get it again this time the tempers and then we're not going to
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:47.280]  play mr nice guy the the tempers and then what what was the other one in the six well with
[2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:52.720]  tempolism and then it was a collapse of the lawn barred system in 1348 which that year was accompanied
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:57.440]  by the great plague in europe which wiped out half the population and then the fall of the
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:06.880]  hanseatic league uh in the early 1600s in europe and that was uh out of uh germany germany in
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:15.280]  italy yeah with the hanseatic knights so um they've gotten away with it uh in both instances of the
[2:39:15.280 --> 2:39:21.200]  many of the people were exiled what would there is no exile for them this time they either take all
[2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:29.040]  of us out or we take them out it's the only way it's going to be all right paul wasa is going to be
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:33.360]  back the last 20 minutes of the show after his big article at prisonplanet.com is posted and
[2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:38.560]  we're so conditioned to accept evil now that oh the ran corporation it's just big international
[2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:43.360]  news no one knows in the us or england we're over here a little bubble cocoon oh it's all
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:47.200]  over the major papers that they know the us is planning to sneak attack them but it's not the
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:51.520]  us it's this criminal group and they've got all their deep underground bases and the rest of
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:55.760]  it they've been building for 50 years god help us paul run through those facts one more time and
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:40:01.600]  some other caveats you didn't add you know the good news is uh like you're putting in the article
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:05.840]  he mentioned him during the break to make sure and point out fox felon they ordered him to attack
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:12.400]  iran he said no they had two previous commanders of sent com say no and so the good news is even
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:17.920]  there and he was a cfr new world order guy they're still not suicidal they're still not you know
[2:40:17.920 --> 2:40:27.920]  start world war three uh so uh paul yeah um on february 25th 2007 the uh london times reported that
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:34.960]  up to five generals and admirals would quit if bush ordered an attack on iran and then
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:42.000]  couple weeks later in march felon quit because he you know disagreed with the policy on iran
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:45.680]  they tried to veil it and they said oh it's not because we're planning to attack them no
[2:40:46.640 --> 2:40:52.560]  but you had these uh five generals or more that were going to quit if it happened and then the
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:58.480]  antagonism towards iran kind of subsided a little after that so that's the hope that
[2:40:59.200 --> 2:41:04.080]  you know randa proposing this new war to the pentagon but there are good people inside the
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:09.680]  pentagon that will stand up against it and that's that's what rides in our favor
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:18.240]  well forget even good people bob i mean what about sanity i mean these people already own the world
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:25.600]  why do they have to run around and start world war three they know better what is good for us
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:33.440]  than we do and so they must be the imperial leaders in the future and we must be their slaves
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:38.480]  and it's really what about boils down to in the final analysis because most of them
[2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:43.760]  have far more wealth than they could ever spend in a hundred lifetimes and so it's really power
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:51.840]  and shaping the world the way that they wanted to be shaped and us taking our place in their
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:57.840]  future world i mean goodness gracious we've seen so many books and expostulations on the subject
[2:41:57.840 --> 2:42:04.960]  in the last hundred years of people who are connected to these secret societies and and
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:10.240]  they've cried out and said what they want to do and they're going for it this is the last time for
[2:42:10.240 --> 2:42:15.360]  them and if they don't subject this this time they know it's all over because there's too many
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:21.600]  people like us out there who are not going to let them do it again well that's another thing
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:27.360]  everybody keeps misinterpreting what i'm saying and what history shows when our guests are saying
[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:30.640]  we're not saying next week or next month troops are going to come to your door and say come to
[2:42:30.640 --> 2:42:35.120]  the femur camp they're going to shut the power off they're going to shut the water off the troops
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:39.680]  are going to see people on the news begging them to come in then there's going to be staged
[2:42:39.680 --> 2:42:43.520]  insurgencies and real violence and then the troops are going to fight for their lives
[2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:49.200]  against the american people and then that will be on the news and set the precedent and then
[2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:55.600]  international forces six months a year two years and this has all been drawn out by these
[2:42:55.600 --> 2:43:01.760]  grand bastards and even the stuff that's declassified and i mean they they are they say what cold
[2:43:01.760 --> 2:43:06.320]  bloodedly dominates for wall street in the foreign banks i mean thomas barnett the head of the naval
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:12.160]  war college he openly says this on c-span they work for offshore money you are seeing literally
[2:43:12.720 --> 2:43:18.400]  as like a gallon of oil on the ground a barrel of oil you are seen as a human resource they are
[2:43:18.400 --> 2:43:22.640]  all about the cold bloodedness of it i think they're higher than us because they're cold blooded and
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:27.200]  as the peanut documents say we got the power we got the nukes we got the space space weapons
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:30.960]  we got the particle beams a lot of other secret stuff that's why they're so arrogant
[2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:35.840]  and they say we're going to impoverish our people we're going to attack other nations
[2:43:35.840 --> 2:43:40.960]  we're going to sterilize people we're going to put poison in the water we're going to do it
[2:43:40.960 --> 2:43:45.840]  because we're dominant and that's the way it is and they're going to set it up where you beg
[2:43:45.840 --> 2:43:52.000]  for it folks where you beg for it bob Chapman i agree with everything you said you really
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:58.560]  covered it uh you know in total i mean this is the direction it's going in this is their mindset
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:03.280]  this is their goal uh you've you've set it just the way it is
[2:44:05.840 --> 2:44:10.320]  you know that's why i'm not even angry i don't even feel defeated by the corrupt cops and cia and
[2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:15.600]  fbi they all think they're winners and ha ha ha we get to taser and kill everyone you're not going
[2:44:15.600 --> 2:44:21.680]  to win nothing jack you understand bob explain to them what's in store for them well i think in
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:28.160]  america it'll come in stages and you've just explained some of them and americas are different
[2:44:28.160 --> 2:44:34.880]  than other people um it's probably because of the evolution of their culture a sense of revolution
[2:44:35.520 --> 2:44:44.320]  and as unconcerned as they seem now um as sheep alike as they seem now um there's always been
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:51.280]  that strain within their culture when they have been attacked they become ferocious and vicious
[2:44:51.280 --> 2:44:58.000]  animals and i think you're going to see that again and i think that our opposition knows that
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:02.480]  and they know it's going to be a long hard fight and uh they think they're going to win
[2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:09.200]  and we think we're going to win but the people will will rise up to it and they will participate
[2:45:09.200 --> 2:45:15.840]  because they won't have any other choice and uh it's just who's going to win and uh i think we will
[2:45:15.840 --> 2:45:22.160]  but my whole point is the police and military and government people whether they know it or
[2:45:22.160 --> 2:45:26.400]  not they're really in the same boat as us and that's what's so sick about this trick of the
[2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:30.640]  new world order is they always play one phase off against the next when it's really a war against
[2:45:30.640 --> 2:45:37.760]  all of us right and um you know they get their paycheck and that has a lot to do with the way
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:43.200]  they are you know they act up to a certain point and you know i've talked to generals who say you
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:50.080]  know 90 percent of the military will not shoot their own people and uh and if the other 10 percent
[2:45:50.080 --> 2:45:57.840]  do the other 90 percent will shoot them and so uh the same applies to law enforcement uh through
[2:45:57.840 --> 2:46:04.640]  public employees uh they just not going to do that in america maybe in some countries they might
[2:46:04.640 --> 2:46:08.800]  but they're not going to do it in america and it's where i think they're missing the vote and that
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:13.920]  they're bringing foreign troops it is the worst conceivable thing that they can do yeah remember
[2:46:13.920 --> 2:46:17.760]  we were the coops the weirdo's warning of that when we have the documents and sources now it's
[2:46:17.760 --> 2:46:23.280]  yeah we're hiring felons foreigners foreign felons yeah yeah we're doing it just all over the news
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:30.320]  well there's there's just too many weapons in america and they're not going to get a hold of
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:34.400]  them paul watson you're still there yeah you're going to be back to last 20 minutes once you
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:38.960]  be able to write the article anything else you didn't have to read it now if you want this finished
[2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:45.200]  oh so you've been sitting there while i've been talking yeah go ahead and cover it quickly okay
[2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:52.400]  rand lobbies pentagon start war to save us economy according to reports out of top chinese
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:57.920]  mainstream world war start world war because it well i guess it just says war i'm sorry go ahead
[2:46:57.920 --> 2:47:04.000]  start over according to reports out of top chinese mainstream news outlets the rand corporation
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:09.360]  recently presented a shocking proposal to the pentagon in which it lobbied for a war to be
[2:47:09.360 --> 2:47:14.720]  started with a major foreign power in an attempt to stimulate the american economy and prevent a
[2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:21.520]  recession a fierce debate is now ensued in china about who that foreign power may be with china
[2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:27.920]  itself as well as russia and even japan suspected to be the targets of aggression the reports cite
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:34.000]  french media news sources as having uncovered the proposal in which rand suggested that the $700
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:40.320]  billion that has been earmarked to bail out wall street and failing banks instead be used to finance
[2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:46.320]  a new war which would in turn reinvigorate the flag the flagging stock market the rand corporation
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:52.400]  is a notorious and powerful NGO with deep ties to the u.s military industrial complex as well as
[2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:58.960]  interlocking connections with the ford rockefeller and carnegie foundations current directors of rand
[2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:04.560]  include frank charles carlucci the third former defense secretary and deputy director of the cia
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:10.800]  ronald l olson a council on foreign relations luminary and former secretary of labor and
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:17.520]  carl built top bilderberg member and former swedish prime minister carlucci was chairman of the carl
[2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:25.120]  aisle group from 1989 to 2005 and oversaw gargantuan profits the defense contractor made in the aftermath
[2:48:25.120 --> 2:48:32.240]  of 9 11 following the invasion of afghanistan the carl aisle group has also received investment
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:38.480]  money from the bin laden family reportedly the rand proposal brazenly urged that a new war could
[2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:43.600]  be launched to benefit the economy but stressed that the target country would have to be a major
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:50.160]  influential power and not a smaller country on the scale of afghanistan or iraq the reports have
[2:48:50.160 --> 2:48:55.920]  prompted a surge of public debate and tension in china about the possibility that a new global
[2:48:55.920 --> 2:49:05.200]  conflict is on the horizon china's biggest media outlet sohu.com that's sohu.com speculated that
[2:49:05.200 --> 2:49:11.680]  the target of the new war would probably be russia or china but that it could also be iran or another
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:17.920]  middle eastern country japan was also mentioned as a potential target for the reason that japan
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:24.560]  holds the most u.s. debt north korea was considered as a target but ruled out because the scale of
[2:49:24.560 --> 2:49:31.040]  such a war would not be large enough for rand requirements the reported rand proposal dovetails
[2:49:31.040 --> 2:49:37.040]  with recent comments made by joe bead and colin powell madeline albright and others concerning
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:44.080]  the quote guarantee that barack obama will face a major international crisis soon after taking
[2:49:44.080 --> 2:49:51.200]  office the end all right it's good i would just add specifically powell named the date uh i would
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:56.960]  add don't forget the sneak attack on russia through georgia uh and i would just add the fact that
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:05.040]  the pentagon said last week no tuesday they need a huge crisis in fact in fact i think steve wrote
[2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:12.720]  an article about that yeah oh god oh i mean i got children man i i i just want all the punks
[2:50:12.720 --> 2:50:17.200]  and governments know i don't appreciate your evil i mean it isn't enough to steal everything and
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:22.640]  to urinate all over the constitution and dollar rights but you got to go start nuclear wars
[2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:31.040]  i mean you are and and the idiot public who has not been involved you have any idea how dangerous

[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:22.000]  fawkes all right there he goes big news paul contacting me to get on there to bring that out
[2:56:22.720 --> 2:56:26.000]  we were talking during the break bob chavin calls coming up next year i agree to stay with us
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:31.600]  under 30 minutes the international forecaster dot com's your powerful side about why the elite
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:35.280]  is doing this and the fact that they are going for broke and one of the few things that can turn
[2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:41.760]  this around in your educated opinion give us your analysis well we've got a shot here at the election
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:49.760]  and uh in congress uh and that is removing the incumbents uh that that's a possibility if it were
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:56.640]  to happen uh other than that i i don't see anything on the horizon the alumnus controlled the
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:57:04.800]  politicians the bureaucrats uh uh most everything there is a faction within the military and
[2:57:04.800 --> 2:57:11.440]  it will and certainly in the retired military that uh could act and take over the united states
[2:57:11.440 --> 2:57:19.440]  government and i think that's probably our only hope uh in the interim between now and perhaps
[2:57:19.440 --> 2:57:26.720]  the next year and if that doesn't materialize then uh it's going to be is exactly the way alex has
[2:57:26.720 --> 2:57:35.040]  said it's going to be and i have for such a long time unfortunately and so that's where it's all
[2:57:35.040 --> 2:57:42.080]  headed and those are our shots otherwise you're gonna have to fight well i want to be clear here
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:46.960]  that i am never you know in history it's not good to have the military takeover but it's already
[2:57:46.960 --> 2:57:51.840]  done that the military for the executive that's controlled by foreign banks we're already under
[2:57:51.840 --> 2:57:56.480]  north com we're all they they have taken over they've just taken over the republic they're feeding it
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:58:01.600]  into a meat grinder um but congress has been threatened with the military they'll do everything
[2:58:01.600 --> 2:58:08.960]  the president tells them so you're right we need the military to say no um oh god i can't believe
[2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:13.760]  we've come to this i mean these people are psychopaths out of control they must be stopped

[2:59:44.480 --> 2:59:51.520]  dot com and prison planet dot com paul watson is posted an extremely important article
[2:59:51.520 --> 2:59:59.280]  up on prison planet dot com needs to go out everywhere exposure of this may have some bearing
[2:59:59.280 --> 3:00:06.560]  on stopping it it's all over european press french german it's all over the chinese press
[3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:14.240]  very very important it's going up on prison planet dot com right now ran corporation highest level
[3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:21.200]  of pentagon planning wanting to start a war with china or russia ran lobbies pentagon start war to
[3:00:21.200 --> 3:00:27.280]  save us economy a huge war bob Chapman recap why the leader doing this for this segment we'll come
[3:00:27.280 --> 3:00:34.080]  back and take calls well there's a number of reasons uh first of all they've broken uh the world
[3:00:34.080 --> 3:00:38.240]  financial system and this isn't the first time they've done it they've done it through the
[3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:46.400]  centuries many times but this is uh probably one of the three most serious uh breakdowns uh in history
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:53.200]  uh and and that leaves the depression out which was not that bad considering uh of course if you
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:01:00.720]  live through it it was um and being in this position they have to create the diversion
[3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:09.520]  they the diversion would bring them more power uh more wealth and more control over the people
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:17.760]  and that diversion again is war in fact uh back in the early part of this century uh and then
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:24.320]  that's not so long ago we predicted uh the war and invasion in iraq and in afghanistan and the
[3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:29.680]  event that would trigger it we didn't know what the event was but we were pretty close in the
[3:01:29.680 --> 3:01:37.920]  timing we were within 33 days and so if you read history you can see that they have done this over
[3:01:37.920 --> 3:01:45.120]  and over again so it's it's not um anything special to be able to predict what these people are
[3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:51.680]  going to do all you have to do is find out what they did before and so with that said they have
[3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:58.640]  done iraq and afghanistan and now because their system is falling apart they have to have a
[3:01:58.640 --> 3:02:04.720]  bigger and better war and that's what paul watson was talking about and one of the things i'm curious
[3:02:04.720 --> 3:02:11.440]  about is how did the word leak out as to what ran corporation in the illuminati was up to
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:19.440]  and i'd like to see if paul has a comment on that or if anybody knows but it had to have been leaked
[3:02:19.440 --> 3:02:23.840]  well we let paul go so he can expand the article that's up on prism planet dot com but perhaps he
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:30.160]  can address that when he comes back later but i'm curious well i mean why do we have jeffrey
[3:02:30.160 --> 3:02:37.440]  saw it uh the huge you know firm reyman james on cnbc saying the illuminati's behind all this i mean
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:44.320]  that's incredible i and you know that is such a milestone for us students you know i've read
[3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:50.560]  over 5 000 books on the subject in the last 50 years i mean this is a major breakthrough when
[3:02:50.560 --> 3:02:59.120]  someone will get on a major media platform and say it's well let's see illuminati and so everybody
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:03.680]  in america is going to start talking about it and this is going to expose what these people
[3:03:03.680 --> 3:03:09.760]  are doing maybe it'll wake the public up let's play that statement yeah let's play that clip for
[3:03:09.760 --> 3:03:15.120]  those that didn't hear the videos up on prism planet dot com but here it is this at least you're
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:18.560]  getting back to the point where you can start to look at fundamentals and that's good news
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:25.280]  what happened i think you're in a liquidation phase i think christian had it exactly right i
[3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:31.120]  think there's a bunch of wrong-footed moves by hank bolson and the illuminati of the country if you
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:39.120]  will and i think we're paying for it right now what there you go ladies and gentlemen you can
[3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:45.280]  watch the video the only thing he left out is i listened to alex jones well it's true i mean
[3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:50.400]  there's only a handful of us on these programs we've got the guts to come out and then go head
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:57.360]  ahead with these people quick definition of the illuminati bob a group of people who will put
[3:03:57.360 --> 3:04:03.440]  together a long long time ago for their own interests of power and they took over the
[3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:08.960]  financial system in 1207 i think the day was and ever since then they've dictated to us
[3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:14.640]  then they went over to england set up their system there and they got control the british empire
[3:04:14.640 --> 3:04:24.240]  in 1815 the us in 1913 and they are a murderous lot bob chatman's our guest back after this quick

[3:08:19.360 --> 3:08:23.760]  well i mean she's a democrat but it i mean it doesn't matter the i mean the point is
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:30.640]  that mccain is out of his mind open border anti gun pro new world order it's just that obama's
[3:08:30.640 --> 3:08:36.960]  gotten three times the globalist money and in wall street money then mccain so that tells me
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:41.520]  they want him and the dirt on obama they could destroy him anytime they wanted the media
[3:08:41.520 --> 3:08:46.080]  the mainstream media always says oh it's no big deal showing me the establishment is for him
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:52.240]  you want to comment on the election bob jamon i think that's uh from the kennedy side is political
[3:08:52.240 --> 3:09:01.280]  um i i think that uh her uh sponsorship with you may is is somewhat misguided uh but you know
[3:09:01.280 --> 3:09:05.440]  that's the the metal framework i mean you live in the wingland you know what it's like
[3:09:05.440 --> 3:09:11.760]  you know what politics is a lot like i grew up in boston uh james michael curly was elected the
[3:09:11.760 --> 3:09:17.680]  uh the mayor of boston when he was in danbury federal penitentiary i mean this is the kind of
[3:09:17.680 --> 3:09:21.440]  thinking that goes on and of course the kennedys were deeply involved with him
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:29.360]  and i know that from firsthand incidentally and and so that would explain why she did what she did
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:36.400]  i think the important thing with obama here is uh is the birth certificate issue going to be
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:42.720]  an issue before the election or after and either way it's not going to be nice my second question
[3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:47.040]  if you will um obviously you've been talking about uh the the luminaries starting back in
[3:09:47.040 --> 3:09:53.440]  1207 old money talking about the the the british crown what exactly is the involvement of the
[3:09:53.440 --> 3:09:57.120]  vatican i mean obviously if you're talking about somebody with old old money you're talking about
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:04.640]  the vatican as well um i don't know for certain but i do know this if they survived all those years
[3:10:05.280 --> 3:10:11.840]  they had to play ball with these people that's certainly absolutely and so uh you can take it
[3:10:11.840 --> 3:10:19.280]  from there um uh i i it's it's a whole different subject and i'm really not qualified i'm not a
[3:10:19.280 --> 3:10:26.880]  scholar on that and uh i personally like to leave it alone but i have my doubts deep doubts
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:33.520]  and uh i was uh brought up a catholic so uh this one well we know this we know this
[3:10:34.160 --> 3:10:38.800]  the last two pubs have called for world government new world order merger of all the religions
[3:10:38.800 --> 3:10:43.920]  and that's uh we know caused masses of conservative catholics or christian catholics to leave
[3:10:45.440 --> 3:10:50.560]  and but at the same time there's a whole israeli branch and the israeli government we know
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:57.200]  funds people to go around and say it's a catholic only program a catholic only conspiracy and that's
[3:10:57.200 --> 3:11:02.560]  a way that they've tried to basically balkanize the awakening of the new world order every major
[3:11:02.560 --> 3:11:07.360]  group you know a huge institution is new world order or the establishment goes and takes them down
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:11.680]  you know iraq countries like that we're not even saying are run by good people the point is they're
[3:11:11.680 --> 3:11:17.440]  not in the new world order so they're taken down and so you know so much of our energies are wasted
[3:11:17.440 --> 3:11:22.480]  on who's at the top of the pyramid we know it's the new order system clearly the vaticans involved
[3:11:23.200 --> 3:11:27.120]  and but but then we also have folks who are israeli funded and they've been exposed
[3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:32.240]  who run around trying to stir up fights demonizing good people in the anti new world order movement
[3:11:32.240 --> 3:11:38.560]  way overestimating uh you know the power of the vatican by claiming everybody but them are secret
[3:11:38.560 --> 3:11:43.200]  vatican agents uh and it's just asinine and then now we've tracked it directly back to the israeli
[3:11:43.200 --> 3:11:50.080]  government publishing and she said that i mean she's done pieces i mean obviously that that the
[3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:55.760]  vatican that they've had very corrupt popes and very good popes as far as john paul went i mean
[3:11:55.760 --> 3:11:59.440]  well i don't know we don't have to go into this debate and you tell that tree by its fruit i think
[3:11:59.440 --> 3:12:04.880]  he did far more good than bad and i wonder actually if there's if there's a a battle within the
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:08.880]  vatican as well as there's a battle within our government well yeah there's struggles exactly
[3:12:08.880 --> 3:12:12.720]  there's struggles on our streets there's struggles on you know in the cities or struggles between
[3:12:12.720 --> 3:12:18.000]  good and evil every day in in in everybody's life but i listen i appreciate your call listen
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:23.680]  carol and kennedy i mean who cares i'm bashing your call but who cares about these people
[3:12:23.680 --> 3:12:28.480]  they're all a bunch of establishment people uh who cares about uh i mean i mean all of this
[3:12:28.480 --> 3:12:34.400]  well i mean we know evils in high places i expose and oppose the new order policies
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:39.120]  whatever the new orders for i'm against and and that's why we're effective here is about
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:44.160]  taking action not a breaking into a million different camps with every little weird strain of
[3:12:44.160 --> 3:12:49.680]  anti-new world order bob shaman i think that's extremely important and that's bringing the
[3:12:49.680 --> 3:12:58.080]  left and the right together like uh tony hilder and i talked about 1964 and we tried desperately
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:04.240]  to do that in the ensuing years and quite frankly was unsuccessful but here in the last five to ten
[3:13:04.240 --> 3:13:11.360]  years i have seen them come together and it used to be only conservatives uh were subscribers to my
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:17.440]  publication now it's half and half half of the people who used to be way on the left and not
[3:13:17.440 --> 3:13:21.760]  way in the right they all agree with each other we're all americans we got to do this together
[3:13:21.760 --> 3:13:29.440]  we got to do something and the heck with this political jargon and in the sides that that people
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:35.920]  try to pick we're just after the enemy this is a common enemy let's bring them down absolutely
[3:13:36.640 --> 3:13:42.720]  let's take another call here pull up the call list todd in florida you're on the air
[3:13:43.440 --> 3:13:48.880]  yeah i'm calling about the bailout and i'm a small business owner well now we know it's the
[3:13:48.880 --> 3:13:55.600]  cash bonus sound they're taking hundreds of billions of it with one division of goldman sacks
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:14:01.440]  they're giving 14 billion in bonuses well to tell you a little story that happened to me uh we're
[3:14:01.440 --> 3:14:07.680]  small business under 15 employees we sell durable goods our problems started mainly in may when uh
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:12.960]  with good credit we couldn't get any loans um we were denied by all sources which was shocking to me
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:18.720]  when i couldn't understand why but now i foresee where that's came from so we need to use all of
[3:14:18.720 --> 3:14:24.400]  our cash flow for our our savings for our cash flow and expansion of the company um and when
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:29.760]  the economy just kept falling down it just uh it just kind of ruined us almost we're living day to
[3:14:29.760 --> 3:14:34.560]  day now and uh we couldn't get a loan now if we wanted to i'm i'm saying we're small business
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:39.520]  bailout well no that's what the listen they said it was a bailout for the people and then they but
[3:14:39.520 --> 3:14:43.520]  you notice the fine prints that they just keep it all and not even discuss it and so now they're
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:48.880]  saying you know what we're keeping all the money personally i mean you know the the execs are saying
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:54.240]  it's ours shut up and if you don't like it the army standing by what i called my local bank just
[3:14:54.240 --> 3:15:00.000]  yesterday uh dealt with them for oh seven eight years spent a lot of money in that bank and i
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:04.320]  talked to some of the tellers and stuff and threw up some about this bailout that they're getting
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:08.720]  there saying oh we're not getting no bailout i says well that's untrue what i've read well the local
[3:15:08.720 --> 3:15:14.000]  banks aren't getting it uh in fact the big banks the only thing that isn't going to bonuses to
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:20.240]  CEOs and people is buying other banks and then the and then the little banks don't have a choice
[3:15:20.240 --> 3:15:25.520]  because the big boys the big banks control the regulators they come in and hand them over
[3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:31.760]  just like bob said a couple months ago with bare sterns bob called it he said uh or was it
[3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:39.280]  leeman brothers i forget now he said this he is a takeover bob financial assassination
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:47.440]  that's what bare sterns was yeah and and then leeman brothers were so far gone uh they had
[3:15:47.440 --> 3:15:53.760]  missed that company up so much they had to let it go down but in that process if you notice the
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:15:59.760]  settlement on the derivatives was out and out all it was said was it was done with expediency that
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:04.640]  meant the government came in and put come up with the money and lent it to the people who
[3:16:04.640 --> 3:16:09.760]  went naked on the derivatives and get caught offside for goodness so so much money and my
[3:16:09.760 --> 3:16:14.800]  guess is anywhere between five billion and two hundred and seventy billion dollars and then they've
[3:16:14.800 --> 3:16:21.040]  got a i g where they're stealing all the money where they were bankrupt i mean it's just incredible
[3:16:21.040 --> 3:16:27.920]  and this gentleman can't get alone to expedite the uh the performance of his business well i wouldn't
[3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:33.200]  say this would be uh a local bank i mean more local branch of a of a big bank i don't know if i can
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:39.520]  say the name just name it son trust name it son trust um and uh after speaking with tellers they
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:42.800]  said oh we're not getting a bailout but what i've read that they are getting a bailout and i had
[3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:48.080]  questioned some ridiculous fees that were on my account and said hey help us out here well as i
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:53.360]  started moving up the the line talking to heads up in the bank um as i had mentioned this bailout
[3:16:53.360 --> 3:16:58.400]  they kind of giggled at me almost like i had like what who are you to have the audacity i mean
[3:16:58.400 --> 3:17:03.040]  that's what this is all about it's about enjoying laughing at everybody yeah and then i'd finally
[3:17:03.040 --> 3:17:07.680]  talked to the head person at that branch which i think was a vp or something and and i'd asked
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:11.520]  about it i said why don't you help the little guy out a little bit give me one tenth of a tenth
[3:17:11.520 --> 3:17:16.880]  of a tenth of a tenth of a percent of that to help us out and she says that money is for investors
[3:17:16.880 --> 3:17:21.840]  that was her exact where i mean let's go further they've cut interest rates again they're talking
[3:17:21.840 --> 3:17:26.240]  about cutting them down to the lowest ever basically zero the but the public's paying
[3:17:26.240 --> 3:17:32.240]  more in interest rates bob Chapman that's the market that's the free market and the reason
[3:17:32.240 --> 3:17:39.920]  those rates are up is particularly in u.s paper uh like u.s treasuries and uh agency the fact the
[3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:44.800]  agencies are now guaranteed by the government and they're selling for a point to a point and a half
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:52.320]  and they're triple a above the treasury paper so obviously everybody around the world who is into
[3:17:53.200 --> 3:17:57.840]  uh buying those kinds of things and saying hey we don't want them no matter whether you're
[3:17:57.840 --> 3:18:02.480]  guaranteeing they're not so you're going to take that one step further if they're doing that why
[3:18:02.480 --> 3:18:06.720]  are they doing that they're doing it because they think the united states is bankrupt that's it
[3:18:06.720 --> 3:18:11.920]  talking about foreign is being buying u.s paper all right Todd thanks Ed in South Dakota you're on
[3:18:11.920 --> 3:18:16.880]  the air with bob Chapman go ahead how you guys doing good good hey i wanted to talk about a
[3:18:16.880 --> 3:18:21.440]  little bit of fabian society do you know anything about the fabian society the fabian socialist
[3:18:21.440 --> 3:18:27.040]  setup in the 1850s in england to gradually bring in socialism and to consolidate the wealth of the
[3:18:27.040 --> 3:18:32.560]  middle class into the hands of the elites exactly so you genesis society there you and it was George
[3:18:32.560 --> 3:18:38.080]  right here on the webs and they were the moving force in the late 1800s well you've heard about
[3:18:38.080 --> 3:18:42.960]  that window that they've had it disappeared would have the two guys beaten on the earth with the
[3:18:42.960 --> 3:18:49.280]  anvil you've heard of this window no with the uh the same of omar cayam the dear love could
[3:18:49.280 --> 3:18:54.960]  it's anyway i think this is the key to the whole secret here of what's going on what they're going
[3:18:54.960 --> 3:19:00.800]  to do is shatter the world to bits because as the carneke foundation and the fort foundation
[3:19:00.800 --> 3:19:06.480]  said war is the best way to remold society war it will shatter society to bits break it apart
[3:19:06.480 --> 3:19:12.400]  and then they can remold it nearer to their hearts desire which is a giant eugenics extermination
[3:19:12.400 --> 3:19:17.440]  camp scientifically controlled with men in black uniforms and psychiatrists swattering and ripping
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:23.600]  human souls to pieces in a giant charnel house of death and destruction huge rotting piles of dead
[3:19:23.600 --> 3:19:28.480]  bodies a new older wonderland i'm skipping this break for the prison planet dot tv viewers stay with
[3:19:28.480 --> 3:19:37.200]  us continue ad in south dakota with the points you're making yes they want to order out of chaos
[3:19:37.200 --> 3:19:42.240]  they've said create a world banking crisis to then offer their world government world banks
[3:19:42.240 --> 3:19:47.920]  running everything setting world currencies openly announcing new world order it looks like
[3:19:47.920 --> 3:19:53.840]  it dropped it dropped what is it like bob Chapman to see them now announcing everything we always
[3:19:53.840 --> 3:20:01.680]  said they would do it um it's normal to me uh it it just you know when you're it have been at
[3:20:01.680 --> 3:20:10.880]  at this for so long uh you expect certain things um and i try not to allow that to determine my
[3:20:10.880 --> 3:20:19.040]  thinking uh i'm trying to like you are to inform people of who is the enemy who wants to make their
[3:20:19.040 --> 3:20:26.000]  life difficult or miserable or or to do away with them and so that message is far far stronger
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:32.720]  than any of the things that i see the which are a nasty and unbearable and so you just keep on
[3:20:32.720 --> 3:20:38.000]  going forward not taking no for an answer until they permanently shut you up or you win
[3:20:40.880 --> 3:20:44.800]  and bob they've certainly tried to persecute you over the last 40 something years of fighting
[3:20:44.800 --> 3:20:53.440]  believe me we could do hours of programming but that's okay i'm at the tough guy and i
[3:20:53.440 --> 3:20:56.960]  know how to handle it well i mean you know you're over the target when you're getting the flag
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:05.440]  it's okay i shoot back yeah you know it's i mean it's one thing i like to killing them
[3:21:05.440 --> 3:21:09.520]  well i mean it's one thing to be intellectually aware of this but it's nothing to see it happening
[3:21:09.520 --> 3:21:14.400]  i keep making that point i mean here we are kind of glazing over oh yeah major international news
[3:21:14.400 --> 3:21:19.520]  rand lobbies pentagon to start world war to save us economy up on prisonplanet.com
[3:21:20.800 --> 3:21:25.440]  just so they can consolidate control you know they thinly veil it there and say it's for the economy
[3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:32.320]  yeah for them to further consolidate it and yeah i mean we we so expect this that when it comes out
[3:21:32.320 --> 3:21:38.320]  we're like yeah we told you so when there is that danger of being so mentally prepared for this so
[3:21:38.320 --> 3:21:42.560]  aware of it so informed that you almost become comfortable with it you know what i'm talking
[3:21:42.560 --> 3:21:51.600]  about bob you've got to say to yourself no matter what they do it's my job to engage and attack
[3:21:51.600 --> 3:21:56.880]  and ultimately conquer what they're doing and never give up we gotta have but he had that
[3:21:56.880 --> 3:22:03.360]  attitude in america we would have already been winners exactly i mean so much of war info war
[3:22:03.360 --> 3:22:08.960]  physical war is making the enemy decide they can't win and breaking their spirit if somebody won't
[3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:13.440]  give up that they're basically you you can't beat them unless you were like the romans and
[3:22:13.440 --> 3:22:18.560]  then just killed everybody but you know that was hard too so and and i guess that's what the
[3:22:18.560 --> 3:22:22.800]  population reductions about is they understand that and they want to go ahead and just wipe most
[3:22:22.800 --> 3:22:30.800]  of us out and a lot of them in the process but that slips into the back of the acronium
[3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:34.880]  because they don't want to know that yeah i was i was interrupting you there when you were trying
[3:22:34.880 --> 3:22:40.560]  to make the point about yeah just committing fully and never stopping that's right and you and you
[3:22:40.560 --> 3:22:45.600]  all you people out there you've got to have the guts to do it uh you have to have the guts when
[3:22:45.600 --> 3:22:51.280]  you tell people what's going on and you get rejected just smile and say that's okay i'll be back
[3:22:51.280 --> 3:22:56.000]  and you go on to the next person all you have to do is convince one out of a hundred and we're
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:23:01.120]  winners you gotta look at it that way i mean i remember 15 years ago going around the city
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:04.720]  events and trying to just speak people on the street when i first really woke up then i figured
[3:23:04.720 --> 3:23:08.720]  out i better get on the air that's the way you're supposed to do this but people would laugh at me
[3:23:08.720 --> 3:23:12.480]  and it would kind of hurt a little bit but i was so desperate to warn them that i didn't mind it
[3:23:12.480 --> 3:23:18.960]  now it actually makes me work harder and doesn't you know i mean my ego i don't want to say a shrunk
[3:23:18.960 --> 3:23:24.400]  but it's more like i just don't care i'm so mission exist yeah i mean i'm so mission oriented
[3:23:24.400 --> 3:23:28.720]  that that it doesn't matter if a whole group people are booing at me i mean i know i'm telling the
[3:23:28.720 --> 3:23:34.400]  truth and that's it that's right and that's the same attitude i have and that's why it's 73
[3:23:34.400 --> 3:23:39.120]  years old i'm still doing this and i will do it until i can't do it anymore they're defeated
[3:23:39.120 --> 3:23:51.040]  let's go back to the full audience here we go i hurt myself today to see if i still feel
[3:23:53.040 --> 3:24:01.840]  i focus on the pain the only thing that's real
[3:24:01.840 --> 3:24:17.360]  the needle tears the hole the old familiar stain try to kill it all the way
[3:24:17.360 --> 3:24:33.280]  but i remember everything what have i become my sweetest friend
[3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:50.880]  and everyone i know goes away and you could have it all a jay and main you're on the air with
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:25:00.240]  bob chat and go ahead with all your great insight there paul all your hard work i have a statement
[3:25:00.240 --> 3:25:06.000]  a lake in question uh with all this talk a crisis you know especially nuclear aspect of things um
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:10.560]  i really want to know what prevents any public awareness and programs to this the same sort
[3:25:10.560 --> 3:25:14.800]  of preparedness that we had in the fifties and the sixties you know with the cuban missile crisis
[3:25:14.800 --> 3:25:19.680]  the duck and cover fallout shelters etc um well those were conditioning programs to make people
[3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:24.160]  think that was this big threat it really didn't do any good kind of like anti-terror drills they
[3:25:24.160 --> 3:25:30.080]  have now is to create the illusion or swat teams freaking out on cardboard boxes to give us your
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:37.360]  or local police trained by the feds for ied removal it's all about creating fear but they've
[3:25:37.360 --> 3:25:41.920]  gotten rid of the civil uh you know defense groups because they don't want the image of the people
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:48.320]  being the answer or the posse so so they've gotten rid of that uh but uh go ahead isn't that really
[3:25:48.320 --> 3:25:53.600]  important now with like um you know i i heard a lot of world war three talks a day on the show uh
[3:25:53.600 --> 3:25:57.920]  went that rather than you know back then isn't that really important you know to the american
[3:25:57.920 --> 3:26:03.040]  people nowadays to be like informed you know i expected like you know maybe more of more of
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:08.080]  those type of programs after after the attack on 9 11 you know um there's a really good no they
[3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:12.400]  don't want the people involved because it's a fake attack by the people running the government
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:16.560]  but but but let me explain you didn't hear world war three talk today it's it all over the major
[3:26:16.560 --> 3:26:21.600]  chinese papers all over european papers ran corporation saying they want to start world
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:28.960]  war three with russia or china as a pretext for global domination basically and the and i'm i'm
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:33.920]  scared you know i'm scared i'm trying to tell people about this stuff you know and uh like
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:39.120]  well i mean listen our criminal government two months ago ran a sneak attack through georgia
[3:26:39.120 --> 3:26:44.320]  on russian troops and russia said do it one more time we're gonna nuke all your forces in europe
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:48.800]  and then if you hit us we're gonna hit you because you know well we've got less nukes than you we've
[3:26:48.800 --> 3:26:53.200]  got to go ahead and have a total release on you you think it has anything to do with the
[3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:57.840]  depopulation thing you know that you know they want they you know they know that they listen
[3:26:57.840 --> 3:27:05.600]  it's like moon raker they built their underground bases but bob chime in on all this well i'm not
[3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:12.960]  as up to speed uh as you are on these underground bases but uh the gentleman bringing up population
[3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:19.520]  control is important it's it's part of the reason why they do what they do uh having wars to do away
[3:27:19.520 --> 3:27:25.520]  with people and to keep economies going and for people not to keep their eye on the financial
[3:27:25.520 --> 3:27:30.640]  and economic problems that exist not only now in the united states but throughout the entire world
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:38.480]  well but there's a link on youtube if you search we their altar there's a lot of links you know
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:42.240]  follow up shelters and how to prepare yourself for all this you know and i think it's pretty
[3:27:42.240 --> 3:27:46.400]  informative if you just search for that so i just wanted to add that you know i just think it's
[3:27:47.040 --> 3:27:52.560]  it's crazy that we're not preparing for that you know well alex ties all this together and his
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:58.720]  broadcasts and his staff does too and their releases and we do the best we can and are limited why
[3:27:58.720 --> 3:28:07.840]  we're kind of a two-horse operation and uh and we just do what we can do thank you for for all
[3:28:07.840 --> 3:28:13.040]  you did all you've done and you get a lot of great insight bob and you're pretty intelligent so

[3:33:04.800 --> 3:33:09.200]  to go here soon i wanted to get his take on the bottom for golds must have been hit because
[3:33:09.200 --> 3:33:14.160]  it's going back up in the last four days uh but real fast george and pa you're on the year
[3:33:15.840 --> 3:33:19.760]  hello bob thank you for your newsletter i was just trying to skim through the latest one
[3:33:19.760 --> 3:33:24.640]  and uh i just wondered do you have a site um one place where you have your current recommendation
[3:33:26.400 --> 3:33:33.840]  yes we we have it in in the newsletter once a month and anything that we see changes in
[3:33:33.840 --> 3:33:40.720]  will include it in one of the issues or have a special and i haven't made many changes you know
[3:33:40.720 --> 3:33:46.560]  we're long gold and silver related assets uh we're also low along swiss rank government bonds
[3:33:46.560 --> 3:33:51.520]  and we're short a host of companies in fact i'm watching one of them right now called goldman
[3:33:51.520 --> 3:33:57.920]  sacks and we recommended the short now this is betting it's going to go down at 190 and it's trading
[3:33:57.920 --> 3:34:04.080]  under a hundred dollars right now and i love it uh you'd go go short on that again at this point
[3:34:04.640 --> 3:34:12.720]  oh it once it goes through 86 88 to the downside it's uh it's gone and we just saw that to happen
[3:34:12.720 --> 3:34:17.280]  to others they're they're in serious trouble like everybody else's they get greedy and did what they
[3:34:17.280 --> 3:34:20.960]  shouldn't have done and that's why they want to start world war three to cover it up or failing
[3:34:20.960 --> 3:34:25.840]  for exactly alex exactly it seems to me like uh the government's trying to inflate their way
[3:34:25.840 --> 3:34:30.080]  out by printing a bunch of money way out of their debt are you going to go short on other
[3:34:30.080 --> 3:34:37.200]  fixed income things like utility companies and such um i haven't decided that yet but i do think
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:42.640]  that the market is going low you're seeing uh an election rally here and also an opportunity
[3:34:42.640 --> 3:34:48.160]  to make a lot of money for the people uh who created this well that's what you said two weeks
[3:34:48.160 --> 3:34:53.760]  ago you said it would run back up to 9500 maybe even 10 000 and then it's going to race back down
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:34:57.120]  and maybe even bump again but you're when are you saying it's really going to tank
[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:04.480]  uh after the election early next year it'll it'll get out and test 72 68 on the dow
[3:35:05.120 --> 3:35:09.200]  and would you get out of the market right now that it did you know did rally up to 9 000 left
[3:35:09.200 --> 3:35:15.600]  absolutely general stocks yes not golden silver stocks as a matter of fact my favorite stock is
[3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:22.640]  agneca weagle and i see this evening at six o'clock eastern time uh that's sean boyd uh from agneca
[3:35:22.640 --> 3:35:27.760]  weagle is going to be on the uh the mad kramer show and that should be very informative for you
[3:35:27.760 --> 3:35:33.680]  people he's uh he's just a wonderful person i gotta jump george and pa uh thank you fred and philly
[3:35:33.680 --> 3:35:41.920]  you're on the air with bob jammin okay i have a question bob uh the um the leeman brothers
[3:35:41.920 --> 3:35:51.600]  bankruptcy 639 billion dollar bankruptcy that was declared uh people lost money uh that were debtors
[3:35:51.600 --> 3:35:59.680]  and uh i don't understand how that was um a hundred times bigger than the world
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:06.400]  and then the uh and ron uh stated figure for their bankruptcy of six billion okay what they were
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:11.840]  doing is was running uh a book making operation and that's really what the stock market is all
[3:36:11.840 --> 3:36:18.240]  about i spent 28 years on wall street and so it's it's a high level book making operation
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:23.840]  and what they were doing is that they would naked writing derivatives and i can't go into
[3:36:23.840 --> 3:36:30.080]  what derivatives that means no money backing and just made up crap exactly and they got caught
[3:36:30.080 --> 3:36:37.840]  with their pants down and it is it swept through not only leeman brothers but a host of other firms
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:44.480]  and banks and financial institutions throughout the world and and that's why when they went to
[3:36:44.480 --> 3:36:49.520]  settle the derivative which is three or four weeks late they wouldn't tell you what went on
[3:36:49.520 --> 3:36:54.880]  because the u.s. government stepped in and lent the money to whomever with the writers
[3:36:55.520 --> 3:37:00.800]  to settle the the issues and they're doing all this stuff behind the scenes yeah that's why
[3:37:00.800 --> 3:37:06.080]  everything's blacked out uh they're just giving each other billions of dollars i mean they're
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:11.680]  just stealing everything i want to i just want to end up i just want to say that i have uh i don't
[3:37:11.680 --> 3:37:16.320]  have in front of me but i have a reference book that talks about the establishment of hedge funds
[3:37:16.960 --> 3:37:24.960]  as early as 1948 and uh they started small but the secrecy has kept these things alive
[3:37:24.960 --> 3:37:31.520]  and then they started getting into the options and and and uh and and futures and derivatives
[3:37:32.160 --> 3:37:35.440]  and now they're gonna correct now they're gonna pay it all off through hyper-inflating
[3:37:35.440 --> 3:37:41.280]  insurance there hasn't been any any move towards disclosure on what they've that's right you have the
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:45.840]  real government the real economy guarded by men in black uniforms who do whatever the hell they
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:50.160]  want and they got all us down here the schmuck slaves that's got to change all right ruth in
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:59.120]  north carolina you're on the air go ahead ruth yes alex i've got a big complaint for three weeks
[3:37:59.120 --> 3:38:10.080]  i have not been able to hear your program one two one six oh in the afternoon it's just horrible
[3:38:10.080 --> 3:38:19.040]  and then when it's repeated at night i can occasionally hear part of it but never all of it
[3:38:19.040 --> 3:38:24.080]  you need to check with w w c r well have you called them i mean look look those are the
[3:38:24.080 --> 3:38:32.000]  best frequencies they're giving us i've called them a dozen times and anyway the program before
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:42.320]  you on 5070 is perfectly no i know i can't ever get anybody on one two one six zero and they
[3:38:42.320 --> 3:38:48.960]  they give me stupid answers where are you again i'm in southeastern north carolina well that's
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:54.640]  also because you're so close to tennessee short wait a minute through the years i've been hearing
[3:38:54.640 --> 3:39:01.520]  those frequencies wonderfully and now all of a sudden in the past about the past three weeks
[3:39:01.520 --> 3:39:07.920]  it's just gone to park no but a lot of it it's atmospherics i don't know why the sun is dead
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:13.440]  right now the sun in the 300 years they've been recording at over 100 with with with devices
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:19.360]  is the coolest it's ever been and and so those solar flares do weird things where you might hear
[3:39:19.360 --> 3:39:23.680]  an am from china sometimes over here or you might be able to hear shortwave great somewhere and
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:27.280]  then not hear it great now there has been jamming you know usually when our website goes down
[3:39:27.280 --> 3:39:31.120]  everybody says we've been hacked most of the time it's not that we have been hacked before
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:36.640]  but nine times out of ten it's not we have people recorded it where one shows clear and then my show
[3:39:36.640 --> 3:39:43.360]  comes on it was or they put a tone over it and we know that's been happening on the w w c on

[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:09.360]  they do what they want to do and uh... they don't care and they're arrogant and they're going for
[3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:15.520]  the whole thing and uh... as far as i'm concerned nothing's gonna stop them and sooner or later
[3:43:15.520 --> 3:43:21.200]  they will take us down off the internet yeah folks you'd better appreciate it while it's here i don't
[3:43:21.200 --> 3:43:24.720]  know if we got weeks months or years but they are openly announcing
[3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:30.960]  twenty thirty different ways but ten main ways of we've done articles on it but
[3:43:30.960 --> 3:43:33.440]  a whole group of things they're attacking it right now
[3:43:34.080 --> 3:43:39.040]  i don't know how my god robert in california robert you're on the air
[3:43:40.560 --> 3:43:47.600]  uh... hello yes robert uh... yeah actually i i uh... yeah alex uh thanks for waking me up to all
[3:43:47.600 --> 3:43:53.200]  this i've been i've been listening for about a about two years now um... and robert div chattman
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:43:59.120]  i just wanted to get some well i live i've been listening to g edward griffin a lot and he explains
[3:43:59.120 --> 3:44:05.120]  how when they print out more greenbacks went more federal reserve notes that it's um it's a form
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:11.040]  of taxation and um i think a lot of people really understand how that works it's called the inflation
[3:44:11.040 --> 3:44:18.560]  tax yeah yeah and and it's uh... so this whole bailout thing is kind of like almost like a smokescreen
[3:44:18.560 --> 3:44:23.600]  in a sense because they're doing that already anyway i mean when they just did it on a grand
[3:44:23.600 --> 3:44:30.720]  scale is what you're saying yeah and and and it is and it's a giant tax uh... because it's going to
[3:44:31.280 --> 3:44:36.560]  uh... to appreciate the value of anything that you already own probably the only exception being
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:42.080]  gold yeah what they're good oh well i i i think they're actually getting to the point where the
[3:44:42.080 --> 3:44:46.960]  cost of printing paper is getting more expensive than the value of the dollar oh we haven't got
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:52.480]  there yet but that's that's that's ultra hyperinflation thanks for the call about go ahead don't forget
[3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:56.400]  g edward griffin spoke the creature from jack o'leil and yeah i'm gonna read it these are all
[3:44:56.400 --> 3:45:00.400]  great callers i'm having to go to you briefly because we've got a in this soon with bob chattman
[3:45:00.400 --> 3:45:05.920]  have a little mini guest on real fast uh... i just want to make it clear here that as bad as
[3:45:05.920 --> 3:45:09.920]  this stuff sounds you know we're just telling you the facts as we know it and meeting the threat and
[3:45:09.920 --> 3:45:14.640]  being honest about the threat is is the best way to counter it but but the reason i think
[3:45:14.640 --> 3:45:21.760]  bob may be right just about how quickly things may degenerate is that they're going for broke i mean
[3:45:21.760 --> 3:45:29.040]  when it's in the associated press that they are taking the trillion plus bucks they put out first
[3:45:29.040 --> 3:45:34.080]  as bonuses and to buy up other banks is a consolidation in a vertical integration
[3:45:34.080 --> 3:45:38.720]  and they admit that we were lied to about what it was for we told you that day one we could read
[3:45:38.720 --> 3:45:46.160]  the bill the fact that they just don't care shows they made the decision to just go all the way bob
[3:45:47.280 --> 3:45:53.600]  i agree i agree and that's that's where we're headed and people have got to wake up and
[3:45:53.600 --> 3:45:57.120]  they've got to wake up fast and they've got to try to do something about it
[3:45:57.120 --> 3:46:07.600]  billy bob in uh... tim buck to go ahead uh... go ahead yeah steve i'm privileged to be on the air
[3:46:07.600 --> 3:46:13.120]  first of all it's interesting to me that the caller just before me i had a time hold on hold on you
[3:46:13.120 --> 3:46:19.840]  just said your your name steve no i i i isn't your name steve no my name is alex jones alex jones
[3:46:19.840 --> 3:46:24.400]  and then you're talking to bob Chapman yes and then you gave the fake name of billy bob now go ahead
[3:46:24.400 --> 3:46:29.600]  uh... anyway uh... you said you're spending two thousand dollars for phone lines and i've got a good
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:36.320]  suggestion for you to go to free conference called dot com you can get a uh... go to the simple event
[3:46:36.320 --> 3:46:43.600]  site you get a thousand participant listeners and it's absolutely free people can call into this

[3:46:49.840 --> 3:46:54.080]  do that we should that is a shedding on the web as an emergency backup we're gonna try to expand
[3:46:54.080 --> 3:46:59.760]  it this is our own phone cards our own phone lines see that's on the internet that could go down
[3:47:00.560 --> 3:47:06.960]  we're doing this on independent real phone lines okay so we have something uh...
[3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:11.600]  you know as we get people prepared for the idea of not having the internet
[3:47:13.200 --> 3:47:17.440]  but but that's a great idea for us to do while we have the web give me the name of it again
[3:47:17.440 --> 3:47:25.360]  free conference called dot com or you can call eight seven seven four eight two five eight three
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:32.880]  eight and then i've also got a question for bob Chapman on the uh... on the gas prices why were
[3:47:32.880 --> 3:47:38.160]  the prices falling the same times there was shortages being reported because we have a rig
[3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:43.120]  market and because the speculators were all bailing out of the market bob that's it
[3:47:43.120 --> 3:47:51.040]  it now that down to two fifteen to two thirty and uh... so the elections over uh... and the money
[3:47:51.040 --> 3:47:57.440]  starts to really hit the economy that they've they've injected into it then the commodities will go
[3:47:57.440 --> 3:48:03.360]  back and retrace fifty percent of their losses as will go then sober and at the same time uh...
[3:48:03.360 --> 3:48:09.840]  the stock market will be under pressure and it will go down and plumb new uh... recent lows if you

[3:55:21.520 --> 3:55:26.320]  area commanders forum with over 200 people and we started questioning them they played dumb
[3:55:26.320 --> 3:55:31.040]  they said there's not going to be any major change in policy but we got all the documents it turns
[3:55:31.040 --> 3:55:34.960]  out that chief off the veto has already applied for a federal grant from the national highway
[3:55:34.960 --> 3:55:39.200]  and traffic safety administration which would train the dwi yeah yeah let's be clear they've
[3:55:39.200 --> 3:55:43.440]  already been doing it on the streets in austin hospitals that refuse to draw blood this is
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:46.960]  true this is true another they're making it official and it's actually going to be the police
[3:55:46.960 --> 3:55:51.680]  officers that are hopping in yeah hundred percent no refusal they want to make this no
[3:55:51.680 --> 3:55:55.840]  repair by the way cops do you have any idea the liability they've tried this in other states
[3:55:55.840 --> 3:56:00.240]  and had to stop first the nurses won't then they make the cops do it then the cops jab it and
[3:56:00.240 --> 3:56:05.200]  diabetics arms and others and can't get the blood people go into shock plus it's dangerous for the
[3:56:05.200 --> 3:56:11.360]  officer with these needles you're out of your mind say no i've been talking to police officers they
[3:56:11.360 --> 3:56:14.480]  they're they're against it they don't want to have to get that liability but you know there's

[3:56:31.600 --> 3:56:35.520]  action committee called texans for accountable government basically what we're focusing on
[3:56:35.520 --> 3:56:39.920]  is fighting the new world order here on the local level regardless of the federal programs
[3:56:39.920 --> 3:56:44.000]  or the united nations programs they have to implement them on the local level so we can
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:48.240]  cut them off there before they can execute them and it makes it meaningless for them on the
[3:56:48.240 --> 3:56:52.720]  national level we're sticking out for austin here travis county and the state of texas we're
[3:56:52.720 --> 3:56:56.480]  looking out for our own backs unfortunately you know as as the bailout went through it's
