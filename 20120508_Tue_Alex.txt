[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.140]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.140 --> 00:32.940]  Texas Alex Jones coming up today is a tells holder you can still avoid
[00:32.940 --> 00:37.940]  contempt if you give up fast and furious documents but last week John
[00:37.940 --> 00:42.860]  Boehner the speaker of the house came out and said they weren't going to try to
[00:42.860 --> 00:48.980]  impeach or remove the attorney general so mixed signals coming out of that
[00:48.980 --> 00:54.020]  crew and I heard a week ago that they were looking at the contempt charges I
[00:54.020 --> 00:59.820]  was very excited but now they're waffling around and of course you know the
[00:59.820 --> 01:03.340]  ace in the hole it turns out there were fast and furious type operations going
[01:03.340 --> 01:08.860]  on under Bush we told you that six years ago earlier in the year whenever they
[01:08.860 --> 01:14.420]  were threatening a holder he said look Bush was involved they're like oh okay
[01:14.420 --> 01:17.620]  we already knew that don't bring that up we're just trying to score some political
[01:17.620 --> 01:21.880]  points here the difference is bush was just trying to take control the
[01:21.880 --> 01:29.020]  narcotics trade Obama is trying to blame the Second Amendment so he did go
[01:29.020 --> 01:34.780]  one leg even further but let's be honest about why that's happening that's the
[01:34.780 --> 01:38.820]  story behind the story the news behind the news on that front that's coming up
[01:38.820 --> 01:43.420]  of course there's been another underwear bomber but this one they don't know
[01:43.420 --> 01:49.620]  where he is or how they know they're just an underwear bomb and be thankful the
[01:49.620 --> 01:56.020]  TSA is going in your pants and in your wife's shirt because there's a scary man
[01:56.020 --> 02:01.340]  somewhere over there and man he's scary to the news tell you he's scary right in
[02:01.340 --> 02:07.180]  time for election time Obama has announced that they defeated Al Qaeda but
[02:07.180 --> 02:12.460]  they're still a big threat so give all your rights up continuing Ron Paul is
[02:12.460 --> 02:17.340]  hosting a hearing on ending the Federal Reserve right now and the the hearing
[02:17.340 --> 02:22.500]  has in its name ending the Fed so Ron Paul is just turbocharging all over the
[02:22.500 --> 02:27.660]  country in an intellectual revolution of liberty and he's building the delegates
[02:27.660 --> 02:31.140]  and it looks like he's going to try to contest it and it looks like it's
[02:31.140 --> 02:35.260]  actually working to a certain extent I'll be quite honest with you behind the
[02:35.260 --> 02:40.980]  scenes I've been and I like the strategy of educating people by running he wins
[02:40.980 --> 02:45.020]  period resistance is victory by getting the word out but I have been oh you know
[02:45.020 --> 02:52.500]  I don't know if this is really going to work you know overall contesting what
[02:52.500 --> 02:56.380]  happens with Mitt Romney but even the LA Times says Ron Paul continues to
[02:56.380 --> 03:00.580]  complicate Mitt Romney's coordination and says he's got a chance so we're gonna
[03:00.580 --> 03:05.620]  be breaking that down as well we've got some Federal Reserve propaganda about
[03:05.620 --> 03:16.340]  how AIG is about how AIG supposedly the bailout made the government money but
[03:16.340 --> 03:21.620]  there's reports detailing how that is a fraud as well so we'll be going over
[03:21.620 --> 03:27.740]  that also Georgia opens first jail devoted to just US veterans see the
[03:27.740 --> 03:30.860]  government says they're the number one enemy well now they're building special
[03:30.860 --> 03:35.540]  prison camps for them that's raw story and our team other business inside a
[03:35.540 --> 03:40.140]  report the way the Pentagon is predicting your potential to become a
[03:40.140 --> 03:46.180]  national threat is frightening literal pre-crime California seller of
[03:46.180 --> 03:52.020]  suicide kits sentenced for tax offense and then of course we have the big
[03:52.020 --> 03:56.660]  stacks of news about what's happening with the ongoing globalist takeover of
[03:56.660 --> 04:03.820]  Europe Patrick Buchanan ask is this the end of one Europe well yes the end of
[04:03.820 --> 04:07.380]  the euro as you know it and the new banking dictatorship so I'll give you
[04:07.380 --> 04:13.060]  the news behind the news on that and then parents say the new rule is half
[04:13.060 --> 04:17.700]  baked states junk food man could take a buyout of school fundraisers you know
[04:17.700 --> 04:20.740]  how in Illinois they try to tell parents you can't pack a lunch period
[04:20.740 --> 04:23.860]  because you're just the person that has the child and then delivers it to the
[04:23.860 --> 04:30.100]  state and they ban dodgeball jogging holding hands wrestling everything it's
[04:30.100 --> 04:34.640]  total dehumanization well now all over the country they're moving to ban
[04:34.640 --> 04:40.020]  bake sales but not the dangerous GMO I've looked at the studies people used to
[04:40.020 --> 04:44.540]  eat even more you know junk food they eat now the difference is it wasn't GMO

[06:03.660 --> 06:07.620]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[06:07.620 --> 06:11.860]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[06:11.860 --> 06:16.140]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:16.140 --> 06:20.460]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.460 --> 06:24.540]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.540 --> 06:29.100]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.100 --> 06:33.260]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.260 --> 06:37.220]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[08:52.660 --> 08:58.060]  found at the tip of the spear in resistance against globalism agenda
[08:58.060 --> 09:05.780]  21 and the New World Order coming up in the next hour parents are really
[09:05.780 --> 09:08.780]  starting to get upset all over the US as they're told I can't pack their
[09:08.780 --> 09:12.860]  children's lunches anymore because parents are just there to have children to
[09:12.860 --> 09:18.580]  give them to their God the state bake sales are being banned because children
[09:18.580 --> 09:25.500]  are unhappy unhealthy and obese but it turns out people in the 1950s ate more
[09:25.500 --> 09:32.380]  chicken fried steaks more pork chops cake and pie two meals a day on average
[09:32.380 --> 09:37.740]  people ate more junk the difference was it was old-fashioned junk it wasn't GMO
[09:37.740 --> 09:44.140]  that kills the rats that they feed it to they weren't drinking aspartame and all
[09:44.140 --> 09:50.740]  these trans fats and made up things made up chemicals in the food and that's
[09:50.740 --> 09:54.860]  with the endocrinologist the brain surgeons the scientist the nutritionist
[09:54.860 --> 09:58.740]  we've had on and broken down that's what all the studies show in other mammal
[09:58.740 --> 10:04.140]  species you feed other mammals the stuff we're being fed even in the so-called
[10:04.140 --> 10:08.700]  mainline you know light or healthy food that the establishment system pushes
[10:08.700 --> 10:15.060]  it's deadly and the people are starved for nutrients so they're always hungry
[10:15.060 --> 10:19.260]  because they're eating food that's been depleted but that's in the news states
[10:19.260 --> 10:23.740]  junk food ban could take a bite out of school fundraisers that's in Massachusetts
[10:23.740 --> 10:26.820]  this is all over the country this is happening you know about Illinois where
[10:26.820 --> 10:30.420]  they're banning parents packing their children's own lunches you've got to have
[10:30.420 --> 10:35.380]  the state issued food only the state can be trusted again obesity could affect
[10:35.380 --> 10:44.460]  42% of Americans by 2030 it's already close to 30% and let me tell you ladies
[10:44.460 --> 10:48.900]  and gentlemen it is all due to the additives in the food and the depleted
[10:48.900 --> 10:53.820]  fields that big agra is growing things on the old days you left fields fallow
[10:53.820 --> 10:58.460]  farmed on them two years left them fallow for at least a year what the
[10:58.460 --> 11:05.860]  microbes in and other plants get in there and and create some some biomass
[11:05.860 --> 11:10.900]  some life in the soil the trace elements you would put natural manure and
[11:10.900 --> 11:15.660]  things on it they would go you dig out mud out of creek bottoms and things and
[11:15.660 --> 11:20.740]  dump it on now they just come up with all this big agra synthetic toxic
[11:20.740 --> 11:25.140]  fertilizers that have bio accumulated toxins and heavy metals in it dump that
[11:25.140 --> 11:30.100]  on the fields and it causes the plant to grow but it doesn't have any of the
[11:30.100 --> 11:33.580]  original nutrients it doesn't taste like I mean if you grow something in an
[11:33.580 --> 11:36.660]  organic garden at your house and then compare it to stuff that even looks
[11:36.660 --> 11:42.420]  tastier at the store it's completely different so take the taste challenge
[11:42.420 --> 11:47.500]  find out for yourself but I'm now digressing obesity fight must shift
[11:47.500 --> 11:51.900]  from personal blame US panel says I'm again I'm leading with this because
[11:51.900 --> 11:55.780]  we're gonna cover it more in the second hour and the federal government this is
[11:55.780 --> 12:01.660]  in Reuters is saying we're just gonna decide for you it's not sure full you
[12:01.660 --> 12:05.500]  know they're talking about the CPS taking your child of their even one pound
[12:05.500 --> 12:09.540]  overweight and they're now saying what they want to restrict beef intake or
[12:09.540 --> 12:14.980]  even ban it saying it's evil so haven't a piece of key lime pie is evil
[12:14.980 --> 12:22.380]  having a steak is evil having any type of meat is evil you're supposed to
[12:22.380 --> 12:26.620]  basically plankton and garbage because that's why people are unhealthy no
[12:26.620 --> 12:32.620]  people are sedentary that's a big part of it but the biggest issue is tainted
[12:32.620 --> 12:38.100]  food poison food a lot of these health nuts are getting liver disease and
[12:38.100 --> 12:41.540]  stuff because they're still eating mainline vegetables and things that
[12:41.540 --> 12:46.420]  bioaccumulate the pesticides including sodium fluoride that the government's
[12:46.420 --> 12:50.980]  own scientists by the way in the last decade have revolted and sent letters and
[12:50.980 --> 12:56.140]  had lawsuits and said stop using fluoride as a pesticide it's bioaccumulating
[12:56.140 --> 13:01.700]  going to the cell wall of plants and take it out of the water and so last year
[13:01.700 --> 13:06.740]  the FDA under incredible pressure said okay phase out over a decade should be
[13:06.740 --> 13:13.420]  immediately fluoride as a pesticide just so deadly and cut it by what 40% out of
[13:13.420 --> 13:20.380]  the water supply that's a major battle we're winning that's a major battle we're
[13:20.380 --> 13:25.660]  winning to get them to even admit that we can take back the system fact here's
[13:25.660 --> 13:33.500]  an article that ties into that they knew day one that the dust was deadly and full
[13:33.500 --> 13:36.860]  of asbestos and mercury and lead and everything else from the collapsing
[13:36.860 --> 13:40.900]  towers and they told everybody don't worry just go back to school go back to
[13:40.900 --> 13:44.300]  Wall Street firefighters you don't need breeding breathing apparatus going in
[13:44.300 --> 13:49.500]  and they had record cancers they had major universities you can pull up at
[13:49.500 --> 13:54.220]  CAT scans their lungs were full of the asbestos and and pulverized concrete and
[13:54.220 --> 13:57.900]  glass and they didn't get health care took us nine years and I was at the
[13:57.900 --> 14:01.380]  forefront of this but we are changing others and the New York Post attacked
[14:01.380 --> 14:05.340]  them and said oh the firefighters and policers and military men and women are
[14:05.340 --> 14:09.740]  just ambulance chasers as they were dying and I've been there and watched a
[14:09.740 --> 14:15.420]  guy with an oxygen tank in the green room not sure if he can go on stage with
[14:15.420 --> 14:18.900]  all his teeth falling it you know out and you walk in them even know you're in
[14:18.900 --> 14:23.660]  there and the person is over a bucket and there's blood like Grand Torino where
[14:23.660 --> 14:27.180]  he's got lung cancer coughing up the blood I mean ten times that just like
[14:27.180 --> 14:32.700]  blood all over the place I'm gonna go speak and then end up and then you know
[14:32.700 --> 14:39.740]  the person dies later and they're like shut up ambulance chaser shut up oh but
[14:39.740 --> 14:44.460]  they love the police and firefighters and veterans they care so much about you
[14:44.460 --> 14:48.660]  well EPA scientists who warned of caustic dust from ground zero wins job
[14:48.660 --> 14:55.020]  back I want to get Tante Jenkins back on was fired from other job as chemists
[14:55.020 --> 14:58.180]  after accusing EPA of deliberately covering up the dangers and of course
[14:58.180 --> 15:03.060]  at first she and Todd Whitman came out and said this dust is deadly you got to
[15:03.060 --> 15:06.380]  block it off everybody's got to wear breathing apparatus and they're like no
[15:06.380 --> 15:12.220]  sir we're opening it the next day and they went okay it's safe to breathe
[15:12.220 --> 15:17.340]  instead of saying go to this area your own risk have cleaning crews in to dust
[15:17.340 --> 15:21.620]  out the inside wear masks when you go into work mitigate this put in special
[15:21.620 --> 15:25.540]  scrubbers would have been a boom for the economy got a billion dollar program to
[15:25.540 --> 15:28.660]  ship in scrubbers into the buildings uh-huh they just said there's no
[15:28.660 --> 15:37.260]  liability it's safe and had courts try to block liability lawsuits so that's the
[15:37.260 --> 15:43.300]  reality of what's going on here and I remember being called a conspiracy
[15:43.300 --> 15:48.460]  theorist the day after people are calling my show saying give money to United
[15:48.460 --> 15:52.060]  Way give money to all these groups those groups give it to anti-gun groups those
[15:52.060 --> 15:55.620]  groups will keep most the money and later of course that came out I'd seen
[15:55.620 --> 15:59.860]  them do it I'd seen some of the big charities steal the the checks out of
[15:59.860 --> 16:04.780]  the mail after the Oklahoma City bombing that came out in the news and so I
[16:04.780 --> 16:10.940]  said there's some local churches that are saying male breathing apparatus or at
[16:10.940 --> 16:15.740]  least mass to and we listed the churches on there and said mail it to these
[16:15.740 --> 16:20.340]  churches don't listen to the EPA it's deadly and a lot of the firefighters and
[16:20.340 --> 16:23.820]  people just ran out of masks because they clog up in a while and just went
[16:23.820 --> 16:28.460]  ahead and went in and did they get treatment after no they were told go
[16:28.460 --> 16:35.860]  home and die so that's how they operate but the truth did finally come out on
[16:35.860 --> 16:40.580]  that front okay I haven't even gotten to the big news yet the big news and let me
[16:40.580 --> 16:51.740]  tell you there is a ton load of it in the Eric Holder crime syndicate file the
[16:51.740 --> 16:56.780]  daily file a lot of days we end up not getting to it because there's so much I'm
[16:56.780 --> 16:59.980]  glad Breitbart's reporting on this Breitbart does an overall a great job
[16:59.980 --> 17:05.300]  I'm not saying we scooped them but reading this a bunch of publications
[17:05.300 --> 17:12.140]  including zero hedge info wars.com three or four months ago I know we did
[17:12.140 --> 17:14.820]  articles in fact I haven't even looked it up you guys get watch them on the phone
[17:14.820 --> 17:18.020]  and ask them to pull the articles the zero hedge and ours about this because
[17:18.020 --> 17:22.100]  this was in plain view like we even talked about this some in November of
[17:22.100 --> 17:28.620]  last year because it came out that all these corezine people John corezine
[17:28.620 --> 17:32.580]  people are in the regulatory positions and it turned out that yeah their
[17:32.580 --> 17:37.820]  payoffs made show that the Justice Department doesn't prosecute them when
[17:37.820 --> 17:42.020]  they rob and steal and insider trade and the rest of it I mean this is a mafia
[17:42.020 --> 17:46.620]  but they happen to be eugenicists they've created a scientific template for
[17:46.620 --> 17:58.660]  all their raping robbing and replying but the Chicago way justice for sale and
[17:58.660 --> 18:04.060]  it goes on to say an explosive newsweek article set to rock official Washington
[18:04.060 --> 18:09.980]  why would a newsweek front the Daily Beast report on this this is well it's
[18:09.980 --> 18:12.180]  just like fast and furious it was already coming out the government was
[18:12.180 --> 18:19.020]  shipping hand grenades into Mexico full auto had Navy SEALs doing it sheep dip
[18:19.020 --> 18:24.860]  Navy SEALs that is supposedly out of the military but an intelligence slash
[18:24.860 --> 18:29.700]  contractor so they can so the government can hang them out to dry US Army
[18:29.700 --> 18:34.260]  special forces green berets Rangers I mean that's all come out now shipping
[18:34.260 --> 18:38.900]  guns and killing people killing people in the US shipping guns to gangs in
[18:38.900 --> 18:45.500]  Illinois Indiana Florida Texas hang grenades into Mexico guns into Honduras
[18:45.500 --> 18:52.220]  to control the gun the the drug trade they then had the Justice Department come
[18:52.220 --> 18:59.740]  out and have CBS news go oh Jeepers Creepers Jiminy Cricket we did a bad
[18:59.740 --> 19:03.460]  thing we we let some guns go out of some gun shops to track them just to see
[19:03.460 --> 19:08.380]  where the guns were going knowing the bigger news was about to come out and I
[19:08.380 --> 19:14.780]  think that's what Daily Beast is doing it's about payoffs and of course only
[19:14.780 --> 19:17.700]  reporting on this because Breitbart's reporting on they're being forced to I
[19:17.700 --> 19:21.860]  guess spin it over to Daily Beast they're reporting on the fact that there
[19:21.860 --> 19:27.980]  were payoffs to the Justice Department to not prosecute people so it's been it
[19:27.980 --> 19:32.540]  still is very important in an explosive Newsweek article set to rock official
[19:32.540 --> 19:36.260]  Washington reporter Peter Boyer and Breitbart contributing editor in
[19:36.260 --> 19:41.220]  government accountability Institute president Peter Schweitzer reveal how
[19:41.220 --> 19:44.180]  Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice are operating
[19:44.180 --> 19:47.860]  under a justice for sale strategy by foregoing criminal prosecutions of
[19:47.860 --> 19:51.820]  Wall Street executives and big financial institutions who just so happen to be
[19:51.820 --> 19:57.020]  clients of the white shoe law firms were Holder and his top DOJ lieutenants
[19:57.020 --> 20:02.300]  worked we'll be right back with that information a little over a year ago I
[20:02.300 --> 20:06.500]  began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal
[20:06.500 --> 20:10.580]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[20:10.580 --> 20:14.140]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[20:14.140 --> 20:18.380]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all
[20:18.380 --> 20:22.900]  of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[20:22.900 --> 20:27.260]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[25:31.660 --> 25:37.140]  looking into these reports and now confirming them that the White House
[25:37.140 --> 25:43.300]  crime syndicate Eric Holder was being paid off to let Wall Street rob but they
[25:43.300 --> 25:47.780]  wouldn't kill people over exposing billions of dollars being stolen I mean
[25:47.780 --> 25:53.140]  there's nothing suspicious and we should just believe the official story out of
[25:53.140 --> 25:57.940]  hand and the coroner's dead now and but it's arsenic it's I mean that's not big
[25:57.940 --> 26:04.060]  deal either you know what they had that JT ready guy and I'm not saying I'm a
[26:04.060 --> 26:07.900]  fan of all of his politics because he was formerly a white supremacist but he
[26:07.900 --> 26:12.060]  was a well-spoken person he was making the system mad doing open carry he said
[26:12.060 --> 26:15.420]  people were threatening him and that's exactly how the Mexican cartels would
[26:15.420 --> 26:19.340]  kill you is they come in and kill your whole family and then say that you killed
[26:19.340 --> 26:23.740]  him there was a state senator in Georgia who was emailed me one week and said
[26:23.740 --> 26:27.500]  next weekend come on your show an interviewer before we've got proof
[26:27.500 --> 26:31.940]  they're shopping with files what type of kids they're looking for through CPS to
[26:31.940 --> 26:37.180]  kidnap the government is and her and her husband supposedly murder suicide or
[26:37.180 --> 26:42.740]  suicide I mean it's all pure bull okay if I get killed I'm not committing
[26:42.740 --> 26:48.540]  suicide you got that never never and whoever comes out and says I told him it
[26:48.540 --> 26:54.740]  was like the DC madam she was being followed she was being threatened I told
[26:54.740 --> 26:58.740]  her you better either dump all the info you have or destroy it and tell
[26:58.740 --> 27:01.540]  whoever's listening to your phones that you're not ever gonna talk and just go
[27:01.540 --> 27:05.700]  do your time so they can discredit you or you're dead and she's like oh that's
[27:05.700 --> 27:09.740]  not a big threat whatever about a month later I started talking to sources that
[27:09.740 --> 27:13.660]  we're still talking to her a lot of talking to her as well the only a few
[27:13.660 --> 27:16.500]  times briefly she said she didn't want to come back on she was done to an
[27:16.500 --> 27:20.220]  interview I know about a lot of stuff was happening but I know that she was
[27:20.220 --> 27:26.340]  talking a lot to some other investigative journalist out there like
[27:26.340 --> 27:30.620]  Wayne Madsen and I just called up the condo manager where she owned a condo
[27:30.620 --> 27:33.620]  and he said yeah she was being followed she was being threatened she was getting
[27:33.620 --> 27:38.060]  documents to her mother that handwriting is not hers and I said sir will you send
[27:38.060 --> 27:43.060]  me her lease agreement I mean she owned it but the management agreement for
[27:43.060 --> 27:47.780]  managing the condo area and he sent it to me was not even near the same handwriting
[27:47.780 --> 27:51.900]  and I published that and handwriting expert said yeah no this is a no-brainer
[27:51.900 --> 27:57.420]  wasn't even the same handwriting show if I get killed or God forbid and I pray
[27:57.420 --> 28:01.620]  this never happens if if anybody ever pulls up at my house and me and my whole
[28:01.620 --> 28:07.380]  family are dead and they say Alex Jones did it I would literally live a
[28:07.380 --> 28:12.980]  trillion years in hell before I would harm my children okay or my wife okay
[28:12.980 --> 28:17.540]  I don't have aggressive feelings towards women and children I have only
[28:17.540 --> 28:21.980]  aggressive feelings towards bullies and there's nothing like some big six foot
[28:21.980 --> 28:25.540]  four guy thinks he's intimidating me makes me just want to pull their head
[28:25.540 --> 28:32.020]  off but I have no violence zero violence in my heart towards women and
[28:32.020 --> 28:37.180]  children I would never do that one of their favorite things now is to come to
[28:37.180 --> 28:40.660]  your house and kill you and your family and then blame it on you as the
[28:40.660 --> 28:45.740]  government loves killing kids and these contractors love it as well so that's
[28:45.740 --> 28:50.660]  the news on that front and let me tell you I think that JT ready things stinks
[28:50.660 --> 28:53.620]  to high heaven especially all the reports we've got and then I went and
[28:53.620 --> 28:57.060]  looked up even the Southern Primary Law Center's demonization of him from three
[28:57.060 --> 29:00.020]  years ago their big report on him and it's all these quotes of him saying
[29:00.020 --> 29:04.420]  they're gonna set me up and kill me and make it look like you know a suicide I
[29:04.420 --> 29:09.740]  know they're coming I've been death threat and that's the exact type of calls
[29:09.740 --> 29:13.780]  and stuff I've gotten over the years if we can make it look like you did it we're
[29:13.780 --> 29:18.380]  gonna cut your head off you know stuff like that and I've just got to go
[29:18.380 --> 29:22.220]  forward it's like okay well I'm not gonna let you enjoy the fear I could have
[29:22.220 --> 29:25.060]  died driving into work today on the highway I still do it because I love
[29:25.060 --> 29:30.300]  automobiles and you love transportation and love being free I put my kids in
[29:30.300 --> 29:33.940]  the car every day that's the most dangerous thing I could do so for
[29:33.940 --> 29:36.940]  fighting for liberty if any of that comes I don't want it to and I pray for
[29:36.940 --> 29:40.300]  edge of protection and I ask all of you to pray for me but you know what that's
[29:40.300 --> 29:44.780]  just the way it is there's no better feeling than just committing saying you
[29:44.780 --> 29:51.340]  know what I'm not afraid and I'm coming for you we're on the March the

[34:57.100 --> 35:02.940]  FBI raided what describes as a paramilitary camp in Oskaloa County if
[35:02.940 --> 35:08.220]  I'm pronouncing that wrong over the weekend investigators told the media
[35:08.220 --> 35:13.420]  10 people were arrested on hate crime charges suspects are said to be members
[35:13.420 --> 35:17.980]  of the American front a white supremacist group according to WFTV in
[35:17.980 --> 35:24.260]  Orlando the group is known as a domestic terrorist organization WFTV learned
[35:24.260 --> 35:27.580]  that the investigators believe the group was involved in paramilitary training
[35:27.580 --> 35:33.540]  in which included weapons like AK-47s they always call semi-auto mach 90s that
[35:33.540 --> 35:36.020]  and then say they're illegal when they're not and they also trained in
[35:36.020 --> 35:40.580]  hand-to-hand combat for a coming race war oh my gosh I guess there's so many
[35:40.580 --> 35:45.340]  trains for hand-to-hand combat down to the local karate or jiu-jitsu outfit
[35:45.340 --> 35:49.460]  they're terrorists too so you own a gun you train for hand-to-hand combat you're
[35:49.460 --> 35:55.980]  a terrorist WFTV says the groups figures prominently in a
[35:55.980 --> 36:01.660]  homeland security model for assessing US domestic threats and is described by the
[36:01.660 --> 36:05.940]  ADL as a racist skinhead group that is active in several states around the
[36:05.940 --> 36:11.260]  country and probably led by the FBI just like Atari was and of course they've
[36:11.260 --> 36:14.820]  now been ordered released because it was all staged but they got to find
[36:14.820 --> 36:20.220]  somebody new TSA this is all up at info wars.com these are all info wars.com
[36:20.220 --> 36:25.260]  breaking news TSA releases video of Pat down confrontation with
[36:25.260 --> 36:29.860]  congressman footage shows Texas rep swatting screeners hand away from
[36:29.860 --> 36:33.540]  genitals they know he's been critical so they single him out every time and
[36:33.540 --> 36:39.380]  crushes genitals he said and so now they every time he flies to DC they call the
[36:39.380 --> 36:44.300]  police and say you don't fly unless this happens and then they grab him the TSA
[36:44.300 --> 36:46.900]  has released security footage of an incident that occurred two weeks ago in
[36:46.900 --> 36:50.580]  San Antonio International Airport involving congressman who refused to
[36:50.580 --> 36:56.180]  allow a screener to touch his genitals the video clips obtained by San Antonio
[36:56.180 --> 37:06.020]  TV station KENS 5 show Texas representative Francisco oh we have it
[37:10.700 --> 37:15.900]  okay so we do have that video let's go ahead and play that video right now and
[37:15.900 --> 37:21.740]  then we'll come back to more news on your phone calls we begin tonight with
[37:21.740 --> 37:26.540]  exclusive video of the airport Pat down that has sparked a national debate the
[37:26.540 --> 37:31.180]  IT first broke the story of congressman Kiko Kenseko accusing a TSA agent of
[37:31.180 --> 37:35.980]  assault at the San Antonio Airport now the IT has the video first
[37:35.980 --> 37:41.420]  investigative reporter Brian new is live with more Brian Sarah we filed an open
[37:41.420 --> 37:46.220]  records request for this video and now you'll be able to see if the TSA agent
[37:46.220 --> 37:52.340]  assaulted congressman Kenseko or if Kenseko assaulted the agent it happens
[37:52.340 --> 37:57.260]  to thousands of travelers every day but when congressman Kiko Kenseko was padded
[37:57.260 --> 38:02.820]  down watch close as he says the TSA agent crossed the line the congressman
[38:02.820 --> 38:08.860]  pushes the agents hand away watch again the TSA agent calls for backup for the
[38:08.860 --> 38:13.380]  next seven minutes TSA supervisors in San Antonio police officers surround the
[38:13.380 --> 38:18.700]  congressman eventually a different TSA agent passed down Kenseko and he's
[38:18.700 --> 38:23.780]  allowed to catch his flight the agent was very aggressive in his in his path
[38:23.780 --> 38:29.740]  down and he was patting me down where no one's supposed to go and it got very
[38:29.740 --> 38:33.580]  uncomfortable so I moved his hand away in an interview last week with the IT
[38:33.580 --> 38:37.740]  Kenseko said he felt the agent insulted him and then a week later at the
[38:37.740 --> 38:43.020]  airport he says he was targeted watch the video as Kenseko steps through the
[38:43.020 --> 38:48.860]  metal detector a TSA agent immediately confronts him I did not see it as a
[38:48.860 --> 38:54.540]  coincidence and I asked him why are you going to tap me down again so we discussed
[38:54.540 --> 38:58.940]  that further this discussion lasted nine minutes the congressman was in padded
[38:58.940 --> 39:04.900]  down and left to catch his flight the point is Ron Pauls described it
[39:04.900 --> 39:08.860]  Jesse Ventura's described it I've seen it done to men and women they with
[39:08.860 --> 39:14.780]  pressure grab your genitals and squeeze them to see what they are and they get
[39:14.780 --> 39:21.580]  off on it folks they always have people that are the supervisors who enjoy it
[39:21.580 --> 39:26.980]  and they enjoy the sexual assault under law the cop randomly walked up to you
[39:26.980 --> 39:29.780]  and said I got to make sure you don't have a gun in your pants and wanted to
[39:29.780 --> 39:33.900]  grab your testicles or a woman's genitals it would be sexual assault it's
[39:33.900 --> 39:39.540]  felony but now the TSA is saying they can give police a training seminar and
[39:39.540 --> 39:41.580]  that makes it legal no judge no jury
[39:41.580 --> 39:45.420]  obama can launch wars because he says it's legal even though it's not he can
[39:45.420 --> 39:50.180]  have illegal surveillance because he says so so if you're a radio listener
[39:50.180 --> 39:54.820]  want to see that video it's embedded at info wars comm in Steve Watson's article
[39:54.820 --> 39:58.940]  and that's why Texas I had so many state reps on including the sponsor of the
[39:58.940 --> 40:03.820]  bill that unanimously passed the house to start prosecuting TSA because he said
[40:03.820 --> 40:06.940]  they would grab his children away and start groping I mean it's horrifying and
[40:06.940 --> 40:12.100]  they get and they say stand back and the kids crying like haha it's fun time and
[40:12.100 --> 40:16.380]  you've seen the video where they pull the kids shirts and pants off and people
[40:16.380 --> 40:19.580]  are crying and screaming and rape victims are having their genitals grabbed and
[40:19.580 --> 40:24.540]  the TSA starts having them arrested if they cry and old ladies are forced out
[40:24.540 --> 40:28.540]  of wheelchairs this is what America's become in the name of some fake
[40:28.540 --> 40:35.540]  underwear bomber now they've got a new fake one I'm gonna get to later so it's
[40:35.540 --> 40:39.140]  just incredible and then Texas said we're not gonna allow that and the fed
[40:39.140 --> 40:45.460]  so we'll have an armed blockade the Air Force is standing by okay go ahead and
[40:45.460 --> 40:49.820]  have an armed blockade I mean that's the crook level of the government we've got
[40:49.820 --> 40:53.500]  here's another one again only eyewitness to Breitbart's death disappears Paul
[40:53.500 --> 40:57.660]  Joseph Watson forensic technician died from suspected arsenic poisoning last
[40:57.660 --> 41:04.540]  month so he witnesses are disappearing maybe he'll be found dead it's like oh

[41:35.060 --> 41:39.460]  getting into in more detail but back back to the mafia government the Chicago
[41:39.460 --> 41:45.340]  way justice for sale and Breitbart the media has confirmed reports that came
[41:45.340 --> 41:51.260]  out months ago that whenever these big firms get in trouble they go to the
[41:51.260 --> 41:57.380]  attorney general's law firm with him and his buddies and pay in this revolving
[41:57.380 --> 42:06.020]  door for all of these different you know lawyers to represent them and then all
[42:06.020 --> 42:09.820]  the charges get dropped so you go pay just hundreds of thousands of dollars
[42:09.820 --> 42:16.740]  of these lawyers apiece and everything is fine and it is the Chicago way it goes
[42:16.740 --> 42:21.380]  on holder in the Department of Justice are operating under a justice for sale
[42:21.380 --> 42:26.180]  strategy by foregoing criminal prosecution of Wall Street executives at
[42:26.180 --> 42:30.220]  big financial institutions who just so happen to be clients of the white shoe
[42:30.220 --> 42:36.620]  law firm that holder and his top DOJ lieutenants work for and on stock in and
[42:36.620 --> 42:42.300]  make money off of that is on on positions in investigating report reveals
[42:42.300 --> 42:47.340]  that Eric Holder has not criminally charged or prosecuted a single top
[42:47.340 --> 42:52.020]  executive from any of the elite financial institutions thought responsible
[42:52.020 --> 42:58.020]  for that for the financial crash and why would they and it goes on through last
[42:58.020 --> 43:01.700]  fall Obama had collected more donations from Wall Street than any other
[43:01.700 --> 43:06.500]  Republican candidate employees of Bain Capital donated more than twice as much
[43:06.500 --> 43:11.180]  to Obama as they did to Romney who founded the firm oh see you either get
[43:11.180 --> 43:16.940]  Obama or you get the other Bain Capital people collecting millions from Wall
[43:16.940 --> 43:21.300]  Street was hardly the plan Obama and Holder telegraphed a pioneering office
[43:21.300 --> 43:24.980]  and then the article just gets off into you know the payoffs that way but what
[43:24.980 --> 43:31.180]  about the law firm payoffs and then it continues here here's the daily caller
[43:31.180 --> 43:36.900]  is it a holder you can still avoid contempt if you give up fast and furious
[43:36.900 --> 43:43.060]  documents well what did Holder do back in January this year he I told you he
[43:43.060 --> 43:46.740]  do this he said Bush was involved in a similar gun running program under the
[43:46.740 --> 43:50.820]  last Justice Department you better leave me alone and so they're still just
[43:50.820 --> 43:56.940]  trying to score political points I want to see him in contempt and the media
[43:56.940 --> 44:00.740]  keeps going did he know they were on record a year before he came out
[44:00.740 --> 44:04.700]  bragging about gun running projects they were doing to track guns so they're
[44:04.700 --> 44:08.420]  caught lying about it they gave press conferences I've played the clips of
[44:08.420 --> 44:13.420]  Janet Napolitano and Holder on TV a year before this stuff broke a year and
[44:13.420 --> 44:17.180]  a half ago so this is two and a half years ago giving press conferences
[44:17.180 --> 44:21.140]  about the gun running programs they had to track guns and how they needed to
[44:21.140 --> 44:25.820]  restrict the second amendment because of what the evidence had found there's no
[44:25.820 --> 44:30.220]  question they perjured themselves there's no questioned John Corzine
[44:30.220 --> 44:35.700]  question perjured himself in the MF global and the and Terrence Duffy the
[44:35.700 --> 44:39.100]  head of the CME groups gone public his own executives have gone public they

[44:43.420 --> 44:47.340]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions not given back given
[44:47.340 --> 44:50.700]  to JP Morgan Chase in London and they lied about it and the government says
[44:50.700 --> 44:54.340]  we don't know where the money was wired when it was in Forbes two days after it
[44:54.340 --> 44:59.580]  happened that it was wired to JP Morgan Chase in London it's in the newspaper
[44:59.580 --> 45:03.540]  where the money went the feds know when you wire a hundred dollars where it goes
[45:03.540 --> 45:09.820]  in real time of course they know we're two billion dollars went of course they
[45:09.820 --> 45:13.020]  knew the dust at the World Trade Center was deadly of course they know DU's
[45:13.020 --> 45:19.020]  deadly for our troops top scientists worldwide are saying 85 Chernobyl's if
[45:19.020 --> 45:27.340]  reactor 4 collapses it's already melting down 85 I cannot stress to you the
[45:27.340 --> 45:32.100]  magnitude of that crisis doesn't matter our government media will just say it's
[45:32.100 --> 45:36.900]  good for us they already did when the different radioactive isotope levels
[45:36.900 --> 45:39.900]  went off the chart that's what I mean these people are crazy they're in there
[45:39.900 --> 45:43.820]  just stealing everything they don't even care about the future the globalists
[45:43.820 --> 45:47.060]  are delusional and think they're gonna get nanotech and life extension and
[45:47.060 --> 45:52.260]  they're in control they've got bunkers so it's okay no it's not okay you people

[46:07.540 --> 46:10.980]  yeah we've actually got those reports from natural news but it's also the
[46:10.980 --> 46:18.260]  Japanese news the Japanese news has the 85 85 Chernobyl's that's actually out of
[46:18.260 --> 46:24.380]  the major what is it the Tokyo Daily newspaper has that if you want to look
[46:24.380 --> 46:26.740]  that up
[46:33.100 --> 46:39.060]  now there it is Fukushima Daiichi site cesium 137 is 85 times greater than at
[46:39.060 --> 46:44.500]  Chernobyl accident yeah no no no that's that's that's that's the fact that it's
[46:44.500 --> 46:48.620]  much higher already in the area and blowing over here no no there's reports
[46:48.620 --> 46:56.460]  that if reactor four goes it will be 85 times conservatively the amount of
[46:56.460 --> 47:00.900]  radiation put out by Chernobyl see a nuclear weapon doesn't put off that much
[47:00.900 --> 47:08.620]  radiation it dissipates it's reactors melting down are like mega dirty bombs
[47:08.620 --> 47:13.380]  but they've got everybody scared that that al-qaeda might you know lcaida might
[47:13.380 --> 47:18.340]  go get some hospital x-ray equipment and blow it up and shoot some radiation
[47:18.340 --> 47:21.780]  around a neighborhood at low levels and oh my gosh we better give all our rights
[47:21.780 --> 47:27.900]  up meanwhile all the wind from Japan blows right over the trade winds and
[47:27.900 --> 47:31.620]  the jet stream above it right over the United States Canada and other Mexico
[47:31.620 --> 47:35.700]  and the radiation levels have gone up it's on record it's been in news all

[47:40.100 --> 47:44.300]  times what they say is safe and their answer is it's just fine again this is
[47:44.300 --> 47:49.300]  the craziness of the ruling elite they should be encasing that in concrete they
[47:49.300 --> 47:54.940]  should be you know in the year they've had huge pumps of fresh water going in
[47:54.940 --> 48:00.300]  there instead they just keep letting it sizzle and melt down of six reactors
[48:00.300 --> 48:05.300]  three of them are still partially melting down two of them are sizzling one
[48:05.300 --> 48:10.180]  of them is not in trouble thank god there it is Fukushima reactor number four
[48:10.180 --> 48:14.580]  vulnerable to catastrophic collapse could unleash 85 times the radiation of
[48:14.580 --> 48:18.340]  Chernobyl human civilization on the brink you know that's the proper
[48:18.340 --> 48:22.300]  headlining which what which publication is that your radio lister and you hear

[54:23.980 --> 54:27.940]  so little time to cover it and calls and guests and everything else but the
[54:27.940 --> 54:32.260]  attorney general's been caught lying to Congress about weapons sales and shipping
[54:32.260 --> 54:36.180]  guns and hangar in age to Mexico you don't get those at gun shops they've
[54:36.180 --> 54:40.780]  been caught being paid off through law firms that these Justice Department people
[54:40.780 --> 54:45.060]  make money out of in a revolving door so they won't prosecute people like
[54:45.060 --> 54:50.460]  Corzine Corzine has all of his former employees in every regulatory position
[54:50.460 --> 54:55.580]  at the different commissions I mean it's they're criminals and they're the
[54:55.580 --> 54:58.380]  ones getting rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution they're the ones
[54:58.380 --> 55:04.140]  telling Congress they're not over war now it's ridiculous and if they get away
[55:04.140 --> 55:09.060]  with this it'll be just like every other tyranny they're gonna go all the way I
[55:09.060 --> 55:15.580]  can't believe how far it's gone it's really happening okay real quick yeah
[55:15.580 --> 55:19.140]  you've read Shearer's Rise and Fall Third Reich big old thick black and white
[55:19.140 --> 55:24.020]  cover book big swastik on the front he of course was there in Hitler's buildup
[55:24.020 --> 55:28.020]  and was a reporter so it's a very well-written book and you read that
[55:28.020 --> 55:32.500]  book and everything you see in there politically is the exact same tricks
[55:32.500 --> 55:37.300]  because authoritarians whether they're Chinese or German or Jewish for that
[55:37.300 --> 55:44.740]  matter or Iranian they all do the same stuff and that's what's so crazy about
[55:44.740 --> 55:49.540]  this is tyranny has a few different things about it but it but but it's all
[55:49.540 --> 55:53.140]  pretty much the same thing it's like going to a barbecue joint it varies some
[55:53.140 --> 55:58.900]  but it's still barbecue and we know what this is and we got a bad case of it go
[55:58.900 --> 56:02.540]  ahead and make your point well and you're absolutely right and I've looked at how
[56:02.540 --> 56:06.980]  close the resemblance is and that time in history to where we're at now and
[56:06.980 --> 56:10.620]  you know it really I don't be honest it scared me when you were starting to talk
[56:10.620 --> 56:15.660]  about these reeducation camps they had everywhere I mean I'm getting a lot
[56:15.660 --> 56:19.500]  more concerned that I'm gonna probably be just taking one of those and by the way
[56:19.500 --> 56:25.460]  finally I've got at my stack here a few mainstream publications have reported
[56:25.460 --> 56:31.820]  on the camps I appreciate your calling great points there are now I would say
[56:31.820 --> 56:34.820]  the names but it's somewhere it's it's confusing stack here off the dig it out
[56:34.820 --> 56:39.180]  later but now they're finally reporting on it they're like well is it needed to
[56:39.180 --> 56:42.820]  have these relocation centers and you're gonna have some troublemakers I mean
[56:42.820 --> 56:45.940]  maybe it's needed oh I told you they're gonna have special camps for the
[56:45.940 --> 56:51.380]  veterans this is out of raw story it's also an RT and it's in the Columbus
[56:51.380 --> 56:56.100]  ledger newspapers where it first was reported Georgia opens first jail
[56:56.100 --> 57:01.100]  devoted to US veterans and notice it's like it's because we care about on the
[57:01.100 --> 57:05.980]  article says it's special just for their needs psychiatrically with the drugs and
[57:05.980 --> 57:10.700]  testing when they start saying we got a jail just for the blacks or we got a jail
[57:10.700 --> 57:15.380]  just for them Jews or we got a jail just for the white Russians you know I didn't
[57:15.380 --> 57:18.460]  white people folks that's folks that didn't like the commies that's when you
[57:18.460 --> 57:25.620]  know that's a camp they're setting up camps for the veterans you're not gonna
[57:25.620 --> 57:31.580]  get a job and they're gonna come for you the special veterans they test that are
[57:31.580 --> 57:34.700]  anti-freedom they will become the new officers and they're gonna come for the
[57:34.700 --> 57:41.780]  rest of you and here it is out of the Columbus ledger the problem of US
[57:41.780 --> 57:47.380]  military veterans falling into a life of crime oh after returning from Iraq and
[57:47.380 --> 57:51.620]  Afghanistan has reached such levels that a law enforcer in Georgia has opened
[57:51.620 --> 57:56.340]  what is believed to be America's first county jail devoted to veteran inmates
[57:56.340 --> 58:02.580]  John Dar see it's all like it's good the sheriff of Muscogee County in
[58:02.580 --> 58:05.820]  Columbus Georgia has created the new facility and attempt to break the
[58:05.820 --> 58:10.980]  cycle of recidivism oh it's see it's to help the veterans by providing them with
[58:10.980 --> 58:15.060]  specialist services prozac and stuff to help them deal with the problems they
[58:15.060 --> 58:19.060]  carry with them when they decamp after six seven tears and they're totally
[58:19.060 --> 58:24.220]  fried it's really unique what we're bringing together is a lot of resources
[58:24.220 --> 58:28.700]  and it goes into it Georgia opens prisons for veterans it and that but
[58:28.700 --> 58:33.940]  it's it's it's come to reeducation campus you were in a depression I mean

[1:04:23.820 --> 1:04:28.940]  some other folks who are next-door neighbors to another retired three-star
[1:04:28.940 --> 1:04:32.900]  general and how all the military loves my show and oh they're awake and they
[1:04:32.900 --> 1:04:37.260]  know it's true but it's compartmentalized the current generals they've got up
[1:04:37.260 --> 1:04:40.540]  there at the top the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the actual people running
[1:04:40.540 --> 1:04:44.900]  things they are globalist now below them there's lots of good people even high
[1:04:44.900 --> 1:04:52.500]  level but just to imagine there's some magic counter coup d'etat which is

[1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:11.700]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:07:11.700 --> 1:07:15.740]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:07:15.740 --> 1:07:19.620]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:07:19.620 --> 1:07:23.900]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:07:23.900 --> 1:07:28.060]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:07:28.060 --> 1:07:32.380]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:07:32.380 --> 1:07:36.060]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[1:08:44.420 --> 1:08:51.700]  Alex Jones your host now the next guest we've got I've been trying to get them
[1:08:51.700 --> 1:08:56.980]  on the show for weeks he's very busy guy speaks all over the world I wanted to
[1:08:56.980 --> 1:09:02.940]  get him on about why are people so unhealthy why are people eating about
[1:09:02.940 --> 1:09:06.140]  the same calories they were eating 50 years ago or so the studies are out
[1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:11.900]  there but getting even fatter what's in the food is it you know the GMO the fact
[1:09:11.900 --> 1:09:15.860]  that the soils are played out all of that instead they're saying they're
[1:09:15.860 --> 1:09:19.060]  gonna ban people having a piece of pie in school and parents can't pack their
[1:09:19.060 --> 1:09:23.100]  school lunches from Illinois to Massachusetts and they're banning running
[1:09:23.100 --> 1:09:27.500]  at recess in all this and people don't have immune systems anymore and cancer
[1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:31.020]  and children's up over 10,000 percent 3,000 percent on average and adults
[1:09:31.020 --> 1:09:34.940]  diabetes type 2 several thousand percentage points some numbers are 3,000
[1:09:34.940 --> 1:09:39.540]  percent increase breast cancer highest in the world neurological disorders
[1:09:39.540 --> 1:09:45.780]  autism from 1 in 25,000 330 years ago to 1 in 58 they say in four to five years
[1:09:45.780 --> 1:09:50.220]  will be in what one in five or six I mean this is getting crazy the numbers
[1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:56.220]  are mind-blowing what's happening and it's amazing that I had him set up a
[1:09:56.220 --> 1:10:02.700]  weeks ago for today Dr. Joel Wallach when exactly one of the things I wanted to
[1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:06.900]  get into is big in the news today obesity fight must shift from personal
[1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:11.540]  blame US panel says Reuters the government must make the decisions they
[1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:16.620]  say and tax foods they say aren't good and block people from access to them
[1:10:16.620 --> 1:10:23.260]  start controlling fat they just say at stake is bad when it's not bad it's the
[1:10:23.260 --> 1:10:26.660]  trans fats and the artificial fats and there's an example right there from all
[1:10:26.660 --> 1:10:29.820]  the medical doctors and others we've had on this is a no-brainer
[1:10:29.820 --> 1:10:34.220]  nutritionist I mean we have everybody from mainline medical doctors brain
[1:10:34.220 --> 1:10:41.060]  surgeons endocrinologists veterinarians naturopaths Nobel Prize winners
[1:10:41.060 --> 1:10:45.260]  they're all saying the same thing they're not worried about the GMO or they're
[1:10:45.260 --> 1:10:48.260]  not worried about all the additives they're not worried about the aspartame
[1:10:48.260 --> 1:10:51.060]  they're not worried about the msg they're not telling you to be worried
[1:10:51.060 --> 1:10:54.740]  about the excitotoxins they're not worried about all these other things or
[1:10:54.740 --> 1:10:59.940]  that most the soils have been played out and have bio accumulated toxic
[1:10:59.940 --> 1:11:04.140]  fertilizer put on it filled with heavy metals I mean half the corn syrup
[1:11:04.140 --> 1:11:08.300]  products wash and post reports have high levels of mercury and lead wash and
[1:11:08.300 --> 1:11:12.740]  post just type in melamines in the milk and shine of the execute people for
[1:11:12.740 --> 1:11:16.380]  that here it's in the baby formula which is half corn syrup on average they say
[1:11:16.380 --> 1:11:21.060]  it's fine no no no our children are fried diabetes is happening because
[1:11:21.060 --> 1:11:26.300]  they're on formula Mike Adams is in there with the leading brand it was 50
[1:11:26.300 --> 1:11:30.380]  something percent corn syrup another 20 something percent other sugars babies
[1:11:30.380 --> 1:11:34.620]  aren't supposed to be I mean no wonder we've got all these mall Martians and the
[1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:38.980]  public looks like they've been hit by an ugly beam or something myself included
[1:11:38.980 --> 1:11:42.700]  I mean folks I've gone back and watched old footage by shot in the 80s with my
[1:11:42.700 --> 1:11:45.820]  parents of the video camera people didn't look like this we were eating
[1:11:45.820 --> 1:11:50.900]  really trashy stuff but it didn't have all this new garbage so the experts with
[1:11:50.900 --> 1:11:54.540]  us about 15 minutes the next hour that it's calls and all those other stories
[1:11:54.540 --> 1:11:59.740]  I said we'd cover but now they're coming here it is right here in the news
[1:11:59.740 --> 1:12:05.260]  Massachusetts and others move to ban bake sales all over the country they're
[1:12:05.260 --> 1:12:11.100]  banning parents being able to pack the school lunch for their children total
[1:12:11.100 --> 1:12:14.500]  control but kind of find that article I read it the first hour here here it is
[1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:19.020]  just out of Boston Herald states junk food ban could take a bite out of school
[1:12:19.020 --> 1:12:24.420]  fundraisers and they're calling junk food now the fake environmentalists love
[1:12:24.420 --> 1:12:31.300]  this meat cheese Dr. Wallach never wants to chew his horn but I'm gonna make him
[1:12:31.300 --> 1:12:35.820]  in the first part of the segment do it because he really is probably the most
[1:12:35.820 --> 1:12:39.220]  famous zoological veterinarian and I've worked for a small animal that
[1:12:39.220 --> 1:12:44.340]  analog animal that's not a little bit about it he has his work is in the
[1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:50.020]  Smithsonian Dr. Wallach has sued the FDA over and over and over again in one
[1:12:50.020 --> 1:12:54.620]  when almost no one else can even win once he is super aggressive by the way
[1:12:54.620 --> 1:12:58.780]  he's not even part of the ungevity he's not even part of the company because he
[1:12:58.780 --> 1:13:03.340]  wants to be separated from from his findings and research and Aaron Dyches
[1:13:03.340 --> 1:13:08.020]  as you know I was already promoting and believed in it but wasn't following it
[1:13:08.020 --> 1:13:12.540]  religiously Aaron Dyches lost 91 pounds and it is even advertise the polymers
[1:13:12.540 --> 1:13:17.220]  beyond Tangier Tangerine young Jevity osteo FX all the things Wallach
[1:13:17.220 --> 1:13:25.300]  recommends in the Alex pack Aaron Aaron followed this and lost 91 pounds and now
[1:13:25.300 --> 1:13:29.940]  he's gonna go into muscle gain it's incredible he looks are you seeing we're
[1:13:29.940 --> 1:13:33.660]  gonna do before I've lost 42 pounds anyways info wars team.com to find out
[1:13:33.660 --> 1:13:36.540]  but I'm not gonna go off into a plug about this to find out about all the
[1:13:36.540 --> 1:13:39.900]  products that Wallach and others have developed that he recommends it's this
[1:13:39.900 --> 1:13:45.100]  is such a powerful revolution against the globalist to get the minerals and
[1:13:45.100 --> 1:13:48.220]  vitamins and trace elements they say you don't need and the globalist are
[1:13:48.220 --> 1:13:52.500]  fighting the block you're getting but first Dr. Wallach about six seven
[1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:56.260]  minutes tell us about your awakening your discoveries what you found and the
[1:13:56.260 --> 1:14:01.060]  fact the system premeditatedly doesn't want us to know this because they love
[1:14:01.060 --> 1:14:04.020]  breast cancer up by several thousand percentage points the US leading the
[1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:08.820]  world because it's always about the cure never the cause let's have all these
[1:14:08.820 --> 1:14:12.820]  runs for the cure not runs for the cause they don't want people to know this
[1:14:12.820 --> 1:14:18.140]  what have you discovered in your decades of research and all the things you've
[1:14:18.140 --> 1:14:22.660]  done but first off tell us who you are for those that don't know and and why
[1:14:22.660 --> 1:14:26.620]  you discovered this information well thank you Alex first of all thank you
[1:14:26.620 --> 1:14:30.620]  so much for your hospitality you're one of my heroes and just really great to be
[1:14:30.620 --> 1:14:34.860]  with you today and to answer your question the thing makes me different is
[1:14:34.860 --> 1:14:39.100]  that I do have a degree in agriculture from the University of Missouri and my
[1:14:39.100 --> 1:14:42.500]  major is in animal husbandry and nutrition in the animal industry we
[1:14:42.500 --> 1:14:46.140]  don't have health insurance we just had to learn to solve the problems which is
[1:14:46.140 --> 1:14:49.980]  a good thing in the human industry health industry we have insurance in the
[1:14:49.980 --> 1:14:53.300]  medical system learn to game the system to get the insurance it's very
[1:14:53.300 --> 1:14:58.100]  seductive they go after the money rather than taking care of the patient then I
[1:14:58.100 --> 1:15:03.780]  went on to veterinary school actually in my second year of ag school applied
[1:15:03.780 --> 1:15:08.180]  farm was surprised to get actually accepted into veterinary school by the
[1:15:08.180 --> 1:15:12.340]  time I graduated ag school I was only a second year of veterinary student but I
[1:15:12.340 --> 1:15:17.500]  was also a graduate student so I began to take pathology courses and found and
[1:15:17.500 --> 1:15:22.620]  discovered and wrote up the first case of a mass die-off in America from pollution
[1:15:22.620 --> 1:15:27.340]  in 1962 it was written up in the international journals from Denmark and
[1:15:27.340 --> 1:15:33.420]  Danish and English and Act of Pathologica and that was an awakening for me
[1:15:33.420 --> 1:15:37.940]  certainly I wasn't aware of pollution until this mass die-off occurred then
[1:15:37.940 --> 1:15:40.820]  graduated veterinary school went to Africa for a couple years worked with
[1:15:40.820 --> 1:15:44.540]  Marlon Perkins from the old Mewch of Omaha Wild Kingdom days on a white rhino
[1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:50.700]  conservation project caught over 200 white rhino with drug darts and sent them
[1:15:50.700 --> 1:15:54.620]  back to the States and if you go to a wild animal park or a zoo and you see a
[1:15:54.620 --> 1:15:57.300]  white rhino it's either one that I caught or offspring of the one I caught
[1:15:57.300 --> 1:16:01.020]  so I'm very proud of that project I remember seeing that on television as a
[1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:07.420]  child yep there was quite a bit on TV and of course you can actually see all
[1:16:07.420 --> 1:16:10.780]  this old film we've kept in the archives they actually have pictures of me
[1:16:10.780 --> 1:16:14.380]  doing this so anybody who wants to challenge that we have the film of it
[1:16:14.380 --> 1:16:22.180]  and then because of my background finding that first case of a mass die-off
[1:16:22.180 --> 1:16:27.940]  in pollution Perkins in the mid-60s when I was in Africa actually got a grant
[1:16:27.940 --> 1:16:32.460]  from the National Institutes of Health to study pollution and zoo animals he
[1:16:32.460 --> 1:16:36.300]  made a very good observation going back to the old Welsh coal miner days you
[1:16:36.300 --> 1:16:39.740]  know Alex when they took the canary down in the mine and if methane gas or
[1:16:39.740 --> 1:16:42.460]  carbon monoxide would leak into the mine the canary would drop off the
[1:16:42.460 --> 1:16:46.820]  Persian diamond could get out before they suffocated or blew up well Perkins
[1:16:46.820 --> 1:16:52.900]  reason quite clear correctly that here we have a big zoo three four five six
[1:16:52.900 --> 1:16:55.900]  hundred species of animals and they're bound to be some of them that were more
[1:16:55.900 --> 1:17:00.940]  sensitive to pollution others and give us a warning that doom was ahead and so
[1:17:00.940 --> 1:17:04.420]  because I had written that first paper on a mass die-off from pollution he
[1:17:04.420 --> 1:17:08.060]  called me back from Africa to be the pathologist on that project and to make
[1:17:08.060 --> 1:17:11.580]  a long story short there's a combined department from Washington University in
[1:17:11.580 --> 1:17:17.380]  St. Louis the St. Louis zoo in the Shaw's Botanical Gardens and it was my job to
[1:17:17.380 --> 1:17:20.820]  do the autopsies not only in zoo animals but also human beings that died of
[1:17:20.820 --> 1:17:25.180]  natural causes in the close close proximity to the zoos this included
[1:17:25.180 --> 1:17:28.740]  all the major zoos in the United States including the National Zoo and New York
[1:17:28.740 --> 1:17:34.220]  Zoo and Los Angeles and Miami and so on well again to make a long story short
[1:17:34.220 --> 1:17:40.380]  over that period of some 12 years that over 20,000 autopsies some 17,000
[1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:45.420]  some change in over 450 species of zoo animals and 3,000 humans millions of
[1:17:45.420 --> 1:17:49.060]  chemistries millions of slides with special stains and the book that came
[1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:52.940]  out that's a 1200 page book and it's in the Smithsonian Institute as a national
[1:17:52.940 --> 1:17:58.660]  treasure it only cost 12 25 million dollars at that time there's a lot of
[1:17:58.660 --> 1:18:02.340]  money for a 25 year old kid to be spending because you had a pretty big
[1:18:02.340 --> 1:18:05.820]  team under you to be able to get all that done oh yeah I had they actually
[1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:10.260]  worked 24 hours a day I had a team of people who were chemists and the people
[1:18:10.260 --> 1:18:16.260]  who made the slides for me and I think I probably had seven people working for me
[1:18:16.260 --> 1:18:20.980]  and again as a young man that was quite a project today would cost billions of
[1:18:20.980 --> 1:18:24.900]  dollars to redo that study and I don't think they'll ever do it again which is
[1:18:24.900 --> 1:18:27.900]  a tragedy we're about to go to break tell folks what you discovered from the
[1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:32.740]  study okay what are you study discovered Alex the bottom line was that every
[1:18:32.740 --> 1:18:36.940]  animal and every human being who dies of natural causes dies of a nutritional
[1:18:36.940 --> 1:18:42.380]  deficiency disease and that was profound and of course that didn't make a dent
[1:18:42.380 --> 1:18:45.500]  because people say what do you mean everybody dies of nutritional deficiencies
[1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:48.780]  I mean this is America we had the best food in the world and that is totally
[1:18:48.780 --> 1:18:52.980]  incorrect the earth is not flat and the Sun does not rotate around the earth and
[1:18:52.980 --> 1:18:59.020]  we have the worst food in the world well it's incredible information and but but
[1:18:59.020 --> 1:19:02.780]  now since you did those studies there's all these others about feeding rats
[1:19:02.780 --> 1:19:08.140]  super high nutrient dense food and they live twice as long they're doing it
[1:19:08.140 --> 1:19:11.940]  with insects so the system has duplicated your research I mean that's
[1:19:11.940 --> 1:19:17.660]  well known now that's super high a nutrient dense food and restricted
[1:19:17.660 --> 1:19:21.500]  diets does make mammals live a lot longer oh absolutely we've tripled the

[1:24:27.980 --> 1:24:32.420]  got to say if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv he's joining us via
[1:24:32.420 --> 1:24:38.140]  video Skype doc it is shocking when people learn how old you are tell people
[1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:45.460]  how old you are see next month they'll be 73 and have been to a doctor in 64
[1:24:45.460 --> 1:24:50.180]  years never been sick and certainly never been on a prescription drugs so it
[1:24:50.180 --> 1:24:53.660]  it's a testimony to doing the right things you can be healthy and if
[1:24:53.660 --> 1:24:57.420]  everybody were like me the medical system would certainly have to shape up
[1:24:57.420 --> 1:25:02.780]  no I've seen you on stage speak I've never had a chance to meet you in person
[1:25:02.780 --> 1:25:06.420]  I know you're gonna come to Austin soon I've been twisting your arm on stage and
[1:25:06.420 --> 1:25:13.820]  in person you could pass for 55 I would guess 60 I would guess you're 60 you you
[1:25:13.820 --> 1:25:18.980]  do not look 73 well thank you yes most people think I'm in my 50s and I can
[1:25:18.980 --> 1:25:23.660]  certainly outwork most 18 year olds physically on the farm that's still true
[1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:27.420]  and it's very exciting to be kind of an example if you do all the correct stuff
[1:25:27.420 --> 1:25:30.860]  avoid the bad things you supplement within 90 essential nutrients I'm really
[1:25:30.860 --> 1:25:34.700]  proud of you for going that direction you're certainly looking great and
[1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:38.740]  seeing the benefit and I appreciate you sharing that with the world by the way I
[1:25:38.740 --> 1:25:43.340]  want to get into you defeating the FDA and their their their criminal
[1:25:43.340 --> 1:25:49.780]  activities many times but why did somebody like Aaron Dykes lose 91 pounds
[1:25:49.780 --> 1:25:55.300]  on things that don't even advertise themselves as weight loss well basically
[1:25:55.300 --> 1:26:00.380]  Alex the reason for weight gain and obesity is not what the doctors say it
[1:26:00.380 --> 1:26:04.500]  has nothing to do with eating too much it has nothing to do with lack of
[1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:09.980]  exercise or too much screen time that theory doesn't fit the truth if their
[1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:13.700]  theory was correct with everybody exercising and avoiding fat eating more
[1:26:13.700 --> 1:26:18.260]  whole grains we should be number 200 in the world with and obesity right now
[1:26:18.260 --> 1:26:21.380]  we're number one following their instructions eating more whole grains
[1:26:21.380 --> 1:26:28.100]  exercising more weight gain and obesity is due to a simple mineral deficiency you
[1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:31.860]  take the minerals regardless of the source you take the minerals and you
[1:26:31.860 --> 1:26:36.900]  lose the weight and we found this to be true for the last 35 years and my wife
[1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:41.820]  and I actually wrote a book called Hell's Kitchen which you can get from
[1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:47.900]  infowarstteam.com and that book is just a great little book and it goes into the
[1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:52.740]  history of weight gain and the reason why the medical system the government has
[1:26:52.740 --> 1:26:57.220]  pushed us in the wrong direction obesity is a physician-caused disease it has
[1:26:57.220 --> 1:27:00.860]  nothing to do with eating too much has nothing to do with lack of exercise it
[1:27:00.860 --> 1:27:04.340]  is a simple mineral deficiency and that's why you're seeing the great
[1:27:04.340 --> 1:27:08.180]  results you are from just taking the 90 cents of nutrients what about this
[1:27:08.180 --> 1:27:12.900]  report about obesity fight my shift from personal blame US panel says or the
[1:27:12.900 --> 1:27:18.260]  government's gonna say what's bad but they're saying having a steak is bad
[1:27:18.260 --> 1:27:23.540]  they're saying eating some pasta is bad meanwhile the GMO and all the toxins
[1:27:23.540 --> 1:27:27.180]  they're saying those are just fine but I've seen the studies that the toxins in
[1:27:27.180 --> 1:27:32.660]  GMO are totally linked to all sorts of weird obesity and health problems in
[1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:37.700]  rodents well you're exactly right to there's two forces attacking us number
[1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:42.460]  one or all the bad things GMOs the chemicals in the environment and then
[1:27:42.460 --> 1:27:46.700]  the other thing is you're looking at not enough nutrients of particularly
[1:27:46.700 --> 1:27:51.700]  mineral nutrients and these two forces together have caught Americans in the
[1:27:51.700 --> 1:27:55.140]  crossfire if you will and that's why we're the number one obese nation in the
[1:27:55.140 --> 1:28:02.640]  world has nothing to do with not enough exercise has nothing to do with two
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:09.580]  much food and again it's the chemicals on one hand taking us out of the reality
[1:28:09.580 --> 1:28:14.340]  of nutrition and the lack of nutrition mineral nutrition in particular now if
[1:28:14.340 --> 1:28:19.980]  I may say one thing we have so many examples literally thousands and
[1:28:19.980 --> 1:28:24.900]  thousands of examples of people who tried everything to lose weight including
[1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:29.300]  surgery and so forth and what's happened is we've been able to help people lose
[1:28:29.300 --> 1:28:35.000]  400 pounds 200 pounds 100 pounds as you have with your staff member and it's
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.540]  simply by giving them mineral supplements it doesn't matter if they
[1:28:37.540 --> 1:28:42.260]  take our rebound in the 90 cents of nutrients or if they take pollen bursts
[1:28:42.260 --> 1:28:47.700]  and our nutrients it doesn't matter if they take the ASAP and our nutrients as
[1:28:47.700 --> 1:28:51.100]  long as they're taking the minerals they will lose weight and of course it
[1:28:51.100 --> 1:28:55.100]  doesn't take long you're on two meals a day you're just not really hungry and you
[1:28:55.100 --> 1:28:58.180]  have to watch it you have to be able to eat to make sure you're getting all the
[1:28:58.180 --> 1:29:04.840]  nutrients you need to be healthy and so if you supplement properly that will
[1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:09.040]  happen and of course nobody knows more about weight gain and weight loss than
[1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:12.300]  veterinarians because this is what we do and feed lots for livestock and so I
[1:29:12.300 --> 1:29:17.380]  just transferred that information from livestock to human beings been doing
[1:29:17.380 --> 1:29:22.420]  this again for 35 years and again just so happy that you've taken this on and
[1:29:22.420 --> 1:29:25.380]  and brought it to the public you're just really great for that the people
[1:29:25.380 --> 1:29:29.340]  perish for lack of knowledge and the knowledge is at info wars team comm of
[1:29:29.340 --> 1:29:32.940]  people want to learn more there but when we come back in that short segment I
[1:29:32.940 --> 1:29:37.620]  forgot to get into your defeat over and over again of the FDA one of the few
[1:29:37.620 --> 1:29:41.060]  people that have actually defeated them will find out how you did that and get

[1:34:25.420 --> 1:34:31.100]  my life and every time i stop suddenly i start you know not losing weight
[1:34:31.100 --> 1:34:35.740]  anymore and not having as much energy and i mean i always do at least one of
[1:34:35.740 --> 1:34:40.300]  the day but it is it's like three or four things to take a day because even if
[1:34:40.300 --> 1:34:43.460]  you're going to Whole Foods or whatever they're growing most of it organically
[1:34:43.460 --> 1:34:47.740]  but it's technically not really completely organic because they're using
[1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:51.260]  some of the chemical fertilizers and things and the soils are played out but
[1:34:51.260 --> 1:34:56.660]  i'm telling you this is revolutionary we haven't even done a promo yet i'm going
[1:34:56.660 --> 1:35:02.740]  to do it with erin dice showing him a year ago 90 plus pounds yeah there's
[1:35:02.740 --> 1:35:06.260]  erin just six months ago he'd already lost a lot of weight there he is last
[1:35:06.260 --> 1:35:12.260]  week so so erin had already lost like 40 pounds in that comparison that we just
[1:35:12.260 --> 1:35:15.660]  put on screen in fact put that back up erin on the nightly nose only doing it
[1:35:15.660 --> 1:35:21.340]  eight nine months that is six months ago so he'd already lost half the weight
[1:35:21.340 --> 1:35:30.940]  there and then here he is just last week unbelievable and i'm telling you erin
[1:35:30.940 --> 1:35:36.500]  is quite the ladies man stop right there the point is this is a devastating
[1:35:36.500 --> 1:35:40.900]  weapon against the globalist and yeah i'm promoting it but the point is it
[1:35:40.900 --> 1:35:44.820]  that's how we fund this independent media operation is info worst team calm
[1:35:44.820 --> 1:35:48.820]  where when you sign up you can get distributor wholesale pricing you can
[1:35:48.820 --> 1:35:53.380]  also again sign up your friends and family and get them discounts but the
[1:35:53.380 --> 1:35:58.220]  point is just try beyond tangy tangerine try polymers try the healthy start
[1:35:58.220 --> 1:36:04.020]  alex pack that's got the essential fatty acids the tangy tangerine and the
[1:36:04.020 --> 1:36:07.620]  osteo fx plus i'm gonna stop plugging i got wallach on the plug and i said
[1:36:07.620 --> 1:36:10.420]  wallach i don't want to do much of plugging and i start doing it because
[1:36:10.420 --> 1:36:17.180]  wild horses can't drag me away here this stuff really does work and it turns out
[1:36:17.180 --> 1:36:22.020]  the globalist knew this when i worked for jess edgins large animal vet he would
[1:36:22.020 --> 1:36:24.980]  tell him that when the winter came put him on a certain mineral mix so they
[1:36:24.980 --> 1:36:27.980]  wouldn't you know lose weight or freeze the death outside when it got cold the
[1:36:27.980 --> 1:36:32.620]  cows i mean that that's especially with large animal vets that's what it was all
[1:36:32.620 --> 1:36:38.260]  about and the system knows this doc wallach talk about how much they know
[1:36:38.260 --> 1:36:42.100]  and why they only want to treat the illnesses that they basically caused by
[1:36:42.100 --> 1:36:45.860]  not telling people i mean they've got to know that the average baby formula out
[1:36:45.860 --> 1:36:50.980]  there is over half corn syrup another 20% other sugars you're talking 70 plus
[1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:54.780]  percent sugar no wonder these kids are getting diabetes when they're five years
[1:36:54.780 --> 1:36:57.780]  old i mean the system knows what they're doing why are they doing this
[1:36:57.780 --> 1:37:01.860]  talk and then tell us about your defeat of the food and drug administration over
[1:37:01.860 --> 1:37:05.540]  and over again okay well thank you alex and that's one of my favorite subjects
[1:37:05.540 --> 1:37:12.060]  as kids and just last month in april the food chemistry journal very well
[1:37:12.060 --> 1:37:17.860]  respected journals supported by the USDA came out and said that the kids foods
[1:37:17.860 --> 1:37:21.220]  that we had respected over the years things like Gerber's and similac and
[1:37:21.220 --> 1:37:25.820]  infamil and these types of things that we trusted have less than 20% of the
[1:37:25.820 --> 1:37:29.500]  nutrients vitamins and minerals that kids need less than 20% was big headlines
[1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:34.820]  food chemistry journal in april just last month 20% we feed our dogs and our
[1:37:34.820 --> 1:37:38.660]  rats better we feed our kids and this is why we have diabetes this is why we have
[1:37:38.660 --> 1:37:43.020]  autism and ADD then you throw into the mix all the chem you know the chemicals
[1:37:43.020 --> 1:37:47.180]  in the environment we have a mess here because the kids aren't even getting as
[1:37:47.180 --> 1:37:52.100]  much nutrition as a dog and that is a crime it's not a shame it's not terrible
[1:37:52.100 --> 1:37:58.500]  it is absolute triple A felony and all the pediatricians who know this should
[1:37:58.500 --> 1:38:03.780]  be put in jail absolutely put in jail because we've known this in animals for
[1:38:03.780 --> 1:38:09.380]  75 in some cases a hundred years and it's very simple to give all these
[1:38:09.380 --> 1:38:15.940]  nutrients and of course all the kids who belong to the infwars team and the
[1:38:15.940 --> 1:38:21.100]  alex group they're gaining benefit here and because they're getting the 90th
[1:38:21.100 --> 1:38:23.660]  century nutrients before they're conceived all through the pregnancy
[1:38:23.660 --> 1:38:27.620]  they're developed in from the moment they're born and we will eliminate 900
[1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:31.500]  different diseases in this little army we're starting here that still play
[1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:35.340]  everybody else who had been falsely taught that you can eat well and even
[1:38:35.340 --> 1:38:39.260]  organic foods alex that just means that there's no chemicals on which is very
[1:38:39.260 --> 1:38:42.780]  good because it reduces the chemical load reduces your risk of cancer but
[1:38:42.780 --> 1:38:47.220]  doesn't give you any nutrition no guarantee of nutrition plants only need
[1:38:47.220 --> 1:38:50.540]  three minerals to be healthy and make good seeds for the next generation we
[1:38:50.540 --> 1:38:54.260]  need 60 and so you can eat a pretty good slice or a gankley-grown multi-grain
[1:38:54.260 --> 1:38:58.700]  bread baked by the pastor's wife on Sunday in the church in your 57 mineral
[1:38:58.700 --> 1:39:01.940]  shard and luscious supplement that's what we learned in the livestock industry
[1:39:01.940 --> 1:39:06.060]  because we don't have insurance medical doctors have learned how to game the
[1:39:06.060 --> 1:39:10.460]  system using insurance they feel that if they charge you three thousand dollars
[1:39:10.460 --> 1:39:14.020]  for procedure that really only cost 50 that they're not hurting the patient
[1:39:14.020 --> 1:39:18.980]  because insurance pays and they've financially broken America with this
[1:39:18.980 --> 1:39:24.900]  over costing of health care and this is one of the reasons why I went after the
[1:39:24.900 --> 1:39:31.860]  FDA they used to say things like you you can get the omega-3's you need by
[1:39:31.860 --> 1:39:35.780]  eating foods rich omega-3's and reduce your risk of stroke and coronary
[1:39:35.780 --> 1:39:39.820]  thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis you could not say
[1:39:39.820 --> 1:39:44.220]  until I sued them that you can supplement with omega-3 essential fatty acids
[1:39:44.220 --> 1:39:48.860]  and reduce thrombotic stroke coronary thrombosis pulmonary embolism and deep
[1:39:48.860 --> 1:39:52.380]  vein thrombosis by supplementation that was against the law to say that they
[1:39:52.380 --> 1:39:56.060]  would shut you down put you in jail so I went to court sued them in federal court
[1:39:56.060 --> 1:40:01.260]  and actually won and the one that I love is you'll really appreciate this was on
[1:40:01.260 --> 1:40:04.940]  antioxidants antioxidants being able to reduce your risk of inflammation your
[1:40:04.940 --> 1:40:09.220]  arteries and plugging your arteries reduce your risk of cancer and I
[1:40:09.220 --> 1:40:14.420]  prevailed in federal court on that and they appealed and I prevailed again in
[1:40:14.420 --> 1:40:18.700]  the appellate court and they appealed again and they signed off on the steps of
[1:40:18.700 --> 1:40:22.820]  the U.S. Supreme Court and I felt gosh that felt too easy there's something up
[1:40:22.820 --> 1:40:26.580]  and sure enough six months later they had a sister agency in the Department of
[1:40:26.580 --> 1:40:30.740]  Health and Human Services sued them not both of us but sue them to unravel the
[1:40:30.740 --> 1:40:35.540]  agreement and I had to go to the federal judge and ask to be a co-defendant with
[1:40:35.540 --> 1:40:39.140]  the FDA and he said we've been suing them into the ground for ten years why
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:41.980]  suddenly do you want to be a co-defendant with the FDA and I said well with all
[1:40:41.980 --> 1:40:45.940]  due respects your honor I don't believe that they will defend the agreement
[1:40:45.940 --> 1:40:50.340]  vigorously and I have to be there to do that so he made me a co-defendant with
[1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:54.140]  the FDA and they immediately dropped the lawsuit because they knew we'd prevail
[1:40:54.140 --> 1:40:57.740]  again and they didn't want the precedent in the Supreme Court yeah they do that a
[1:40:57.740 --> 1:41:02.620]  lot they create these fake trials where one party loses on purpose to create bad
[1:41:02.620 --> 1:41:07.060]  precedent but again expanding on this you've been talking about this for 30
[1:41:07.060 --> 1:41:12.060]  plus years but now all the cutting-edge science says super nutrient dense trace
[1:41:12.060 --> 1:41:17.540]  elements you need this but I noticed even most the other big vitamin companies
[1:41:17.540 --> 1:41:22.500]  they don't promote all these trace elements tell people for example why
[1:41:22.500 --> 1:41:27.740]  something like Beyond Tangy Tangerine at info wars team.com why that is so
[1:41:27.740 --> 1:41:32.300]  important and has such a dramatic effect well that one was ten years in the
[1:41:32.300 --> 1:41:36.140]  making and actually is the same technology as coffee crystals where it
[1:41:36.140 --> 1:41:40.780]  instantizes in room-temperature water which is really a great product has 115
[1:41:40.780 --> 1:41:44.220]  super juices in it now there's a lot of super juices on the market we love them
[1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:50.100]  things like manganese, goji, asai berry, noni, pomegranate juice they all increase
[1:41:50.100 --> 1:41:53.980]  your antioxidant auric points and protect you from chemicals in the
[1:41:53.980 --> 1:41:59.700]  environment to reduce your risk of cancer and heart disease so we put 115 115
[1:41:59.700 --> 1:42:05.100]  super juices in this one product Beyond Tangy Tangerine has 130 nutrients
[1:42:05.100 --> 1:42:09.900]  vitamins minerals amino acids and there's nothing like it in the market and
[1:42:09.900 --> 1:42:14.340]  this comes down to an average size person of three dollars a day which is
[1:42:14.340 --> 1:42:18.100]  less than a cup of exotic coffee you know less than a third of the cost of a
[1:42:18.100 --> 1:42:22.420]  cup of exotic coffee we're very proud of that product it makes life simple you
[1:42:22.420 --> 1:42:26.660]  can take that and you throw in the omega-3s you throw in your trace minerals
[1:42:26.660 --> 1:42:31.500]  and you have the perfect 90 essential nutrients and this in the animal industry
[1:42:31.500 --> 1:42:36.060]  has eliminated 900 different diseases still plague people and we're seeing so
[1:42:36.060 --> 1:42:40.940]  many people come to us and say gosh I was on the foot amputation list and now I
[1:42:40.940 --> 1:42:44.900]  can jump off of four foot stages because I've been able to cancel the
[1:42:44.900 --> 1:42:49.940]  amputation my feet I've been able to wean myself off of medication that I've
[1:42:49.940 --> 1:42:54.180]  been on for 25 years with diabetes actually have one guy Alex who owns a
[1:42:54.180 --> 1:43:01.300]  big medical laboratory and he services 7,000 hospitals a day he knows
[1:43:01.300 --> 1:43:06.100]  everybody when it comes to diabetes and his diabetes was out of control and
[1:43:06.100 --> 1:43:10.660]  following the medical system we put him on our little program with the Alex pack
[1:43:10.660 --> 1:43:14.500]  and then throwing in the secret sauce I call it the sweeties with the Alex pack
[1:43:14.500 --> 1:43:18.660]  and within one year's time actually as much sooner than that but within one
[1:43:18.660 --> 1:43:24.700]  year's time he admitted that we had cut his his blood sugar by two-thirds and
[1:43:24.700 --> 1:43:30.900]  now without medication his blood sugar is down to like 60 62 65 is anyone see
[1:43:30.900 --> 1:43:34.380]  him a globin is below five and he couldn't get it even near that with
[1:43:34.380 --> 1:43:39.500]  medication for years dr. Walik explain at the metabolic level what's happening
[1:43:39.500 --> 1:43:45.140]  why is type 2 diabetes and other types exploding off the charts again multi
[1:43:45.140 --> 1:43:48.860]  thousand percent increases in the last few decades they say it's set to double
[1:43:48.860 --> 1:43:53.900]  again in the next decade yes what is happening and of course the system knows
[1:43:53.900 --> 1:43:57.420]  what they're doing I mean I see them they say drink diet coke when you have
[1:43:57.420 --> 1:44:01.700]  diabetes then I have medical doctors on and they say that aspartame totally
[1:44:01.700 --> 1:44:06.620]  accelerates it so this is so cold-blooded you're exactly right well
[1:44:06.620 --> 1:44:10.420]  first of all we've known for 60 years Alex that type 2 diabetes is a simple
[1:44:10.420 --> 1:44:14.580]  mineral deficiency we learned this in the animal industry and was actually the
[1:44:14.580 --> 1:44:19.060]  research was done by one of the heads of the departments of the US Department of
[1:44:19.060 --> 1:44:24.260]  Agriculture a guy by the name of Mertz Walter Mertz and he discovered
[1:44:24.260 --> 1:44:29.180]  unimpeachably the type 2 diabetes is a simple mineral deficiency disease you
[1:44:29.180 --> 1:44:33.140]  throw in the trans fatty acids which he spoke about earlier and I was so happy
[1:44:33.140 --> 1:44:36.540]  to hear you say that the trans fatty acids heterocyclic amines terrible
[1:44:36.540 --> 1:44:42.020]  chemicals caused by improper processing of food and overcooking of food and this
[1:44:42.020 --> 1:44:46.380]  injures the cell walls and makes them unresponsive to insulin well by getting
[1:44:46.380 --> 1:44:50.100]  people off the bad stuff we call it the fried foods and the processed meats of
[1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:54.740]  nitrates and nitrites and getting them on the Alex pack and the secret sauce
[1:44:54.740 --> 1:44:58.540]  which is the sweeties appropriate for body weight usually within anywhere from
[1:44:58.540 --> 1:45:04.020]  12 hours to two weeks they're being able to wean off their medication because
[1:45:04.020 --> 1:45:07.700]  suddenly now their cell walls are sensitive to insulin and they're able
[1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:11.020]  to use minimal amounts of insulin which they make themselves that type 2
[1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:15.020]  diabetics make tons of insulin it's not an insulin problem when you have type 2
[1:45:15.020 --> 1:45:20.340]  diabetes it's a mineral deficiency and a lack of sense it's sensitization of the
[1:45:20.340 --> 1:45:25.220]  cell walls to and the system knows that but they don't want to tell people let's
[1:45:25.220 --> 1:45:29.420]  move on to the next subject cancer pediatric cancer you can look this up
[1:45:29.420 --> 1:45:33.260]  cancers that didn't exist are now incredibly common in children it's an
[1:45:33.260 --> 1:45:39.380]  epidemic 10,000 plus percentage increase on average adults multi thousand
[1:45:39.380 --> 1:45:45.220]  increases breast cancer again it's always find the cure not the cause and I
[1:45:45.220 --> 1:45:51.620]  liken it to if I walked outside and and got shot and suddenly thousands of
[1:45:51.620 --> 1:45:54.460]  people today were being shot in the town where I live and they went we've got to
[1:45:54.460 --> 1:45:58.940]  find a way to cure bullet wounds no let's find out why thousands of people
[1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:03.020]  today are being shot and stop whoever shooting them or if I was to run out in
[1:46:03.020 --> 1:46:06.020]  front of a truck and get run over let's figure out how to regenerate bones
[1:46:06.020 --> 1:46:10.220]  magically no don't walk out in front of a truck why don't they ever want to
[1:46:10.220 --> 1:46:14.380]  discuss why all this is increasing they never want to talk about neurological
[1:46:14.380 --> 1:46:19.420]  disorders off the charts every disease bone and joint everything what's
[1:46:19.420 --> 1:46:23.100]  happening with cancer what's happening with all of it well there's a great
[1:46:23.100 --> 1:46:28.700]  series of billboards on the highways in Cook County around Chicago it says
[1:46:28.700 --> 1:46:34.620]  hot dogs cause butt cancer and this is because of the trans fatty acids in
[1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:39.220]  there plus the nitrates and nitrites and this message is for kids as you point
[1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:43.460]  out the kids the cancer is just going crazy a colon cancer for instance used
[1:46:43.460 --> 1:46:46.980]  to be an adult disease now you're finding colon cancer in young adults in
[1:46:46.980 --> 1:46:50.940]  their 20s because they've been eating processed meats with nitrates and
[1:46:50.940 --> 1:46:54.540]  nitrites in them for breakfast lunch and dinner and either from fast food
[1:46:54.540 --> 1:46:57.580]  places they're these things are cooked at home we're talking about things like
[1:46:57.580 --> 1:47:02.180]  deli slices, sandwich meats, sausage, ham, bacon, bologna, salami, pastrami,
[1:47:02.180 --> 1:47:07.820]  pepperoni, jerky, spam all these things that they put even on pizza these meats
[1:47:07.820 --> 1:47:13.900]  with nitrates and nitrites in them increase the risk of colon cancer as
[1:47:13.900 --> 1:47:17.580]  you point out thousands of percent just by burning your meat if you cook your
[1:47:17.580 --> 1:47:20.980]  meat well done which the medical system tells you to do and increases the risk
[1:47:20.980 --> 1:47:24.980]  of breast cancer by 462 percent according to the University of South
[1:47:24.980 --> 1:47:29.260]  Carolina and so if you just give up processed meats with nitrates and
[1:47:29.260 --> 1:47:33.460]  nitrites each year meat cook medium or medium rare you supplement with the 90
[1:47:33.460 --> 1:47:36.900]  essential nutrients and get your antioxidant points auric points above
[1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:40.780]  50,000 for kids and above a hundred thousand a day for adults you reduce
[1:47:40.780 --> 1:47:44.460]  your risk of cancer to just about zero that sounds pretty bold Alex but we
[1:47:44.460 --> 1:47:47.900]  we've known this from the animal studies for years and years and years and I
[1:47:47.900 --> 1:47:52.500]  find it amazing that doctors say well you can't trust animal studies because
[1:47:52.500 --> 1:47:55.940]  it's not in humans and yet they trust animal studies for drugs and that's why
[1:47:55.940 --> 1:48:00.820]  we have such trouble with drugs are killing so many people pharmaceuticals
[1:48:00.820 --> 1:48:07.180]  are I don't know they they probably kill a hundred times more people each day
[1:48:07.180 --> 1:48:11.260]  than street drugs and it should be a war on drugs and hospitals and doctors
[1:48:11.260 --> 1:48:17.780]  office not a war on drugs in the street and you can back up all those numbers
[1:48:17.780 --> 1:48:23.420]  yes folks all I can say is go to info wars team calm today purchase the
[1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:26.740]  products there sign up become a distributor and it also supports the
[1:48:26.740 --> 1:48:30.100]  info war at the same time we've got the lowest prices there on young Jebedy

[1:48:45.740 --> 1:48:50.820]  it because I promote what I believe in and I believe in private property the
[1:48:50.820 --> 1:48:56.140]  family the second amendment national sovereignty and I know that the elites
[1:48:56.140 --> 1:48:59.820]  are all obsessed doc Wallach I've been reading the articles even in the LA
[1:48:59.820 --> 1:49:05.820]  Times and in other papers where the the elites know everything you know they're
[1:49:05.820 --> 1:49:10.620]  obsessed with trace elements and and and you know raw minerals the type of
[1:49:10.620 --> 1:49:14.740]  stuff that you've developed and and not these synthetic ones they are obsessed
[1:49:14.740 --> 1:49:20.500]  with purified water they don't eat GMO at the Monsanto laboratory the London
[1:49:20.500 --> 1:49:23.860]  Independent AP reported more than a decade ago I heard this like a month ago
[1:49:23.860 --> 1:49:27.340]  I went looked it up and it was something I didn't know over a decade old and
[1:49:27.340 --> 1:49:30.160]  there were some new articles were at all the Monsanto facilities their
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:37.540]  scientists refuse to have GMO served in the cafeteria on these research
[1:49:37.540 --> 1:49:41.900]  reservations so I mean the Queen of England's obsessed the Chinese elite who
[1:49:41.900 --> 1:49:45.780]  are shoveling GMO and all that their people they are obsessed turns out they
[1:49:45.780 --> 1:49:51.140]  have secret government gardens for their food I mean this is mainstream news
[1:49:51.140 --> 1:49:56.580]  though why do you think the controllers know this and enjoy shoveling this at
[1:49:56.580 --> 1:50:01.980]  the population well Alex the there's no doubt the research shows very clearly
[1:50:01.980 --> 1:50:06.900]  that chemicals in our diet and GMOs and all these various things you mentioned
[1:50:06.900 --> 1:50:13.780]  do have a terrible impact upon the human physiology and that the supplementing
[1:50:13.780 --> 1:50:17.260]  with all 90 essential nutrients like you find in the Alex pack do protect you
[1:50:17.260 --> 1:50:22.900]  well this is extremely well known in the in the human health industry it's
[1:50:22.900 --> 1:50:27.580]  certainly known at the high government levels and these people what should I
[1:50:27.580 --> 1:50:32.060]  say they're certainly in it for themselves and I think it's a form of
[1:50:32.060 --> 1:50:37.940]  enslavement this it's very seductive and even a Senate committee came out and
[1:50:37.940 --> 1:50:41.580]  said that the medical system has learned how to game the insurance system
[1:50:41.580 --> 1:50:45.900]  they'll bill for eight different agencies for one procedure they did you and I
[1:50:45.900 --> 1:50:49.420]  would go to jail for insurance fraud if we did that the doctors get a walk
[1:50:49.420 --> 1:50:53.140]  because they spend more money on PAC committees than any other group of
[1:50:53.140 --> 1:50:57.660]  individuals and so the the elected officials love the medical system
[1:50:57.660 --> 1:51:01.060]  because of the money that flows to the PAC committees from the medical system
[1:51:01.060 --> 1:51:05.580]  in the pharmaceutical industry and so this is why I've spent 35 years in my
[1:51:05.580 --> 1:51:08.700]  life and you're spending most of your professional life getting information
[1:51:08.700 --> 1:51:12.660]  out to the public because the strength of America is the basic citizen it's
[1:51:12.660 --> 1:51:16.820]  always been the citizen soldier the citizen politician if you will the
[1:51:16.820 --> 1:51:20.700]  citizen out there in the corner preaching the truth and when it comes to
[1:51:20.700 --> 1:51:23.820]  health we're gonna have to take control here we cannot depend on the medical
[1:51:23.820 --> 1:51:27.140]  system we cannot depend on the government certainly can't depend on the
[1:51:27.140 --> 1:51:31.340]  people in it because they just do whatever the doctors say so we have to
[1:51:31.340 --> 1:51:36.260]  teach our kids to begin to do these things at very young age when somebody
[1:51:36.260 --> 1:51:41.340]  has cancer they have diabetes when they're 70 years old in their minds they
[1:51:41.340 --> 1:51:45.620]  have to depend on the government and they have to depend on the doctor well if
[1:51:45.620 --> 1:51:49.020]  we eliminate diabetes we eliminate heart disease we eliminate cancer and we
[1:51:49.020 --> 1:51:54.260]  eliminate Alzheimer's disease which we can do you'll find that we don't need
[1:51:54.260 --> 1:51:57.940]  the doctors and we can be citizen soldiers again by the way I got to stop
[1:51:57.940 --> 1:52:00.500]  you right there because you're right in the animal studies I wanted to be
[1:52:00.500 --> 1:52:04.860]  conservative and said they've doubled rats and mice and guinea pigs but
[1:52:04.860 --> 1:52:08.660]  anybody can you know type that in in fact guys just show viewers randomly type
[1:52:08.660 --> 1:52:15.780]  in but and then click web because it'll go back over years type of rats double
[1:52:15.780 --> 1:52:22.220]  lifespan under new treatment and then it'll say it's a wide spectrum of trace
[1:52:22.220 --> 1:52:26.860]  minerals and trace elements and the same thing they've done it with insects
[1:52:26.860 --> 1:52:32.140]  they've done it with dogs they've done it with cats they know this because in
[1:52:32.140 --> 1:52:35.540]  that industry they want to milk and get more money out of your animal living
[1:52:35.540 --> 1:52:39.660]  longer so they've gotten a competitive but with humans they make money off of
[1:52:39.660 --> 1:52:42.360]  killing you or making you sick and they're keeping you alive but you
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:47.980]  mentioned Alzheimer's these stories were telling Aaron losing 91 pounds it was
[1:52:47.980 --> 1:52:53.060]  like 87 pounds a month ago when he was on I've lost over 40 pounds Ted Anderson
[1:52:53.060 --> 1:52:55.860]  was gonna have to have knee surgery he hobbled around when he came to visit me
[1:52:55.860 --> 1:53:01.580]  an old sports industry injury he went on the essential fatty acids and the
[1:53:01.580 --> 1:53:10.420]  osteo FX plus and and all of that and his knee feels great gone now the sad
[1:53:10.420 --> 1:53:13.140]  story but I'm an authorized to tell it I've told it like five times I'll tell
[1:53:13.140 --> 1:53:17.500]  it again his father goes fishing they go pheasant hunting Alzheimer's never had a
[1:53:17.500 --> 1:53:21.340]  heart attack never had a stroke but the doctors have him on cumulative you know
[1:53:21.340 --> 1:53:24.100]  he has the sores on his arms it's you know it's it's it's making him you know
[1:53:24.100 --> 1:53:27.660]  have the all these problems doesn't know who he is tab was gonna have to stop
[1:53:27.660 --> 1:53:33.300]  taking him fishing and stuff then he gets him on the tiny tangerine the
[1:53:33.300 --> 1:53:38.180]  essential fatty acids and the osteo FX plus the stuff that's in the Alex pack
[1:53:38.180 --> 1:53:44.060]  within a few months miraculously Ted described his half the Alzheimer's he
[1:53:44.060 --> 1:53:47.620]  knew who he was he could have fun it was coming back short-term long-term his
[1:53:47.620 --> 1:53:53.340]  dad was back God bless her she believes in the medical doctors she she took him
[1:53:53.340 --> 1:53:56.420]  to the doctor and the doctor tests his blood and said he can't have vitamin K
[1:53:56.420 --> 1:54:00.500]  with the cumin and you can't have leafy vegetables either they told them those
[1:54:00.500 --> 1:54:06.260]  are evil now and took him off of within a month it was all reversed that is
[1:54:06.260 --> 1:54:12.780]  phenomenal it's a sad story but it's Ted Anderson that is a real story of the
[1:54:12.780 --> 1:54:18.500]  owner of the Genesis radio network and the doctor saying don't give him
[1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:23.060]  tangy tangerine because she brought it in and showed it to him and said no you
[1:54:23.060 --> 1:54:28.140]  know he's not allowed to have vitamin K you hit the nail on the head and I have
[1:54:28.140 --> 1:54:32.340]  one too and actually this happens hundreds of times a year maybe even a
[1:54:32.340 --> 1:54:35.220]  month I just don't know about it all but one case out of Charlotte North
[1:54:35.220 --> 1:54:39.260]  Carolina make a long story short a six year two-year-old guy was diagnosed by
[1:54:39.260 --> 1:54:44.180]  five neurological clinics as having a terminal Alzheimer's disease those his
[1:54:44.180 --> 1:54:48.100]  sister was told to put him in a hospice the end was near she didn't want to
[1:54:48.100 --> 1:54:52.260]  believe it she took him to the medical school in Greensboro insisted that the
[1:54:52.260 --> 1:54:55.420]  head of the department of neurology their exam and he did said the same thing
[1:54:55.420 --> 1:55:00.540]  terminal Alzheimer's disease and in one week on the Alex pack and getting off
[1:55:00.540 --> 1:55:03.940]  all the bad stuff and eating 12 eggs a day to rebuild the myelin of the brain
[1:55:03.940 --> 1:55:09.420]  in one week's time he according to the doctors there is perfectly 100% normal
[1:55:09.420 --> 1:55:13.580]  this guy's back to work he does not have alizarin disease anymore and I don't
[1:55:13.580 --> 1:55:16.220]  think it was alizarin disease I think it's actually a disease called Korsakov
[1:55:16.220 --> 1:55:19.100]  syndrome which is curable in one to two weeks
[1:55:19.100 --> 1:55:23.740]  Alzheimer's disease is preventable by 80% according to Johns Hopkins and I got
[1:55:23.740 --> 1:55:26.660]  to interrupt you know when you were on like a year and a half ago we're saying
[1:55:26.660 --> 1:55:30.100]  all this I was like come on Wallach I know this stuff's good but I don't believe
[1:55:30.100 --> 1:55:35.580]  this now I've seen it happen over and over again my entire family rave reviews
[1:55:35.580 --> 1:55:40.900]  my dad who's a dentist was like yeah rightly got on it but I now go to events
[1:55:40.900 --> 1:55:44.580]  in Dallas and then one in Florida and I'm and I've done a lot of events over the
[1:55:44.580 --> 1:55:47.660]  years it's never about health people come up and say my wife was going to be in a
[1:55:47.660 --> 1:55:51.380]  wheelchair she went on this and it came back or my mom had Alzheimer's it's
[1:55:51.380 --> 1:55:55.140]  reversed it I mean this is what's incredible is this is really real and
[1:55:55.140 --> 1:56:00.900]  the system knows this and there's such pieces of trash that they will not tell
[1:56:00.900 --> 1:56:04.500]  people because they want to suck money out of them I mean that is incredible doc
[1:56:04.500 --> 1:56:08.700]  I want to go to calls but what's your take on that I mean I have people now
[1:56:08.700 --> 1:56:14.020]  calling me and drove saying wow this really does work you're exactly right
[1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:17.780]  Alex and it is a it's a form of slavery and in fact in the back of one of my
[1:56:17.780 --> 1:56:22.060]  books I said that it's called black gene lies where all the diseases of black
[1:56:22.060 --> 1:56:25.180]  people are thought to be genetic or at least promoted to be genetic by the
[1:56:25.180 --> 1:56:29.100]  medical community and of course I said no these are simple nutritional
[1:56:29.100 --> 1:56:33.220]  deficiencies it was actually the publication that book was subsidized by
[1:56:33.220 --> 1:56:37.140]  a pastor in Atlanta Georgia Creflo Dollar paid for that book to be published
[1:56:37.140 --> 1:56:42.460]  called black gene lies and this is beginning to go through the black
[1:56:42.460 --> 1:56:46.260]  community and they're reversing within days and weeks and months all these
[1:56:46.260 --> 1:56:49.580]  diseases that are thought to be genetic in the black community and you're going
[1:56:49.580 --> 1:56:53.420]  to see an uprising here and in that book on the back cover I said the black
[1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:59.020]  community has exchanged the chains of slavery to slavery from people in white
[1:56:59.020 --> 1:57:04.580]  coats and scopes because of this genetic belief and they have enslaved us
[1:57:04.580 --> 1:57:07.500]  because they have diseases that are simple nutritional deficiencies they
[1:57:07.500 --> 1:57:12.180]  say are genetic one of which I was actually fired from Emory University in
[1:57:12.180 --> 1:57:17.740]  Atlanta back in 1978 I discovered the first non-human case of cystic
[1:57:17.740 --> 1:57:21.220]  fibrosis learned how to reproduce it learned the cause prevention cure of
[1:57:21.220 --> 1:57:25.100]  cystic fibrosis in 1978 and they fired me because they thought I was sniffing
[1:57:25.100 --> 1:57:28.860]  glue well actually received an international ward in 2011 for that
[1:57:28.860 --> 1:57:35.940]  work 35 years ago and we now and you know Jerry Lewis so is not on the telethon
[1:57:35.940 --> 1:57:39.620]  this last year and the reason was we gave him the data we've been working on
[1:57:39.620 --> 1:57:43.260]  mustard history we believe we have found the cause prevention cure of mustard
[1:57:43.260 --> 1:57:46.580]  history we gave it to Jerry we thought since they're Jerry's kids he should be
[1:57:46.580 --> 1:57:51.380]  the one to make the announcement and the mustard history foundation fired Jerry
[1:57:51.380 --> 1:57:56.020]  Lewis because he brought him our data I didn't know that that's breaking I want
[1:57:56.020 --> 1:57:58.740]  to come back as I was just gonna have you for the hour but we run out of time I
[1:57:58.740 --> 1:58:06.700]  want to talk to Matt Craig William CJ and Kevin they all want to talk to you
[1:58:06.700 --> 1:58:10.220]  and again we don't screen calls I've no idea what they're calling in about but
[1:58:10.220 --> 1:58:14.780]  that should be interesting if you can do it I see people standing behind you
[1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:17.180]  there I guess you may have to go somewhere we'll find out of Dr. Wallach and
[1:58:17.180 --> 1:58:23.820]  stay with us but undoubtedly people have mineral and vitamin deficiencies and a
[1:58:23.820 --> 1:58:26.820]  lot of the vitamins they buy are synthetic go right through you you need it

[2:01:23.860 --> 2:01:27.380]  months ago my grandma said I can once look at a turkey fried chicken and I
[2:01:27.380 --> 2:01:31.620]  brought her some and I ate a drumstick and had a headache for two hours and I'm
[2:01:31.620 --> 2:01:35.580]  like I'm never doing that again I knew that would happen and I told her I'm
[2:01:35.580 --> 2:01:39.900]  not bringing you that again because most times she's pretty healthy but the
[2:01:39.900 --> 2:01:44.660]  point is we just got to stay away from this stuff Dr. Wallach's our guest we've
[2:01:44.660 --> 2:01:50.060]  got a Matt Craig Williams CJ and others let's go to Kevin in Oregon holding
[2:01:50.060 --> 2:01:55.300]  first he's for our guest welcome sir hello hi Dr. Wallach I don't have to
[2:01:55.300 --> 2:02:00.140]  you how great your information is but one of the things I really needed to get
[2:02:00.140 --> 2:02:06.420]  a hold of you to talk to you about was I've been told I have to get a surgery
[2:02:06.420 --> 2:02:11.380]  to correct to her needed this and I know that going under the knife is
[2:02:11.380 --> 2:02:17.180]  something that I'm really not looking forward to my question is is that able
[2:02:17.180 --> 2:02:23.700]  to heal itself you know without the surgery yes or is it like a hole in the
[2:02:23.700 --> 2:02:28.100]  head where you have to get the stone up or yeah no do not get the surgery the
[2:02:28.100 --> 2:02:30.740]  body is a wonderful thing you give it the raw materials and I work with a
[2:02:30.740 --> 2:02:34.820]  professional athletes and military personnel Olympic athletes professional
[2:02:34.820 --> 2:02:38.580]  athletes university athletes and we can regrow the disc and doctors will say
[2:02:38.580 --> 2:02:42.620]  you can't but then they make the money by doing the surgery right yeah that's all
[2:02:42.620 --> 2:02:47.780]  it's been going out is money yeah and so which one how much do you weigh I was
[2:02:47.780 --> 2:02:52.460]  260 ever since I started though I've been losing quite a bit of weight okay
[2:02:52.460 --> 2:02:57.140]  well at 260 let's say way 240 now you say you lost quite a bit of weight let's
[2:02:57.140 --> 2:03:01.220]  say way 240 you want to get on two Alex packs per month get one full dose of
[2:03:01.220 --> 2:03:04.500]  each of the three products of breakfast one full dose each of three products of
[2:03:04.500 --> 2:03:08.660]  dinner and the secret sauce here will you what we call glucose gels the raw
[2:03:08.660 --> 2:03:12.740]  materials and I could legally say to support and promote maintenance repair
[2:03:12.740 --> 2:03:17.420]  of cartilage ligaments tendons connective tissue disc between the vertebrae and all
[2:03:17.420 --> 2:03:21.580]  your sciatica and all the numbness and burning in the feet restless leg syndrome
[2:03:21.580 --> 2:03:28.100]  peripheral neuropathies will all go away usually take 60 90 days to regrow the
[2:03:28.100 --> 2:03:32.900]  disc I don't care if they're bulging ruptured degenerative they've shrunk
[2:03:32.900 --> 2:03:35.580]  and the vertebrae getting closer together smashing the roots of these
[2:03:35.580 --> 2:03:39.460]  spinal nerves we can regrow the disc we can regrow cartilage and tendons and
[2:03:39.460 --> 2:03:43.420]  ligaments meniscus it's all regrowable so in many cases you can but it might as
[2:03:43.420 --> 2:03:47.500]  well try but also I think you're implying lose weight too that helps
[2:03:47.500 --> 2:03:51.340]  right well how tall are you Kevin
[2:03:52.620 --> 2:03:58.340]  Kevin how tall are you six feet yes the six feet you need to lose about 40
[2:03:58.340 --> 2:04:04.180]  pounds you get down to you know 190 to 200 all muscle be great and so you you
[2:04:04.180 --> 2:04:08.780]  take two Alex packs a per month and you can throw in either our sweeties you
[2:04:08.780 --> 2:04:12.380]  could take two bottles of the sweeties take three of those capsules twice a day
[2:04:12.380 --> 2:04:17.740]  or throw in our ASAP as soon as possible or as slim as possible put a
[2:04:17.740 --> 2:04:21.460]  dropper full under your tongue before 30 minutes before each meal and you will
[2:04:21.460 --> 2:04:26.500]  lose the weight within 30 to 60 days you'll be a new man and that will help

[2:08:26.100 --> 2:08:31.660]  Dr. Wallach to break down a revolutionary idea getting real nutrition
[2:08:31.660 --> 2:08:37.060]  something the system doesn't tell you you need and they just handed me an
[2:08:37.060 --> 2:08:41.620]  article out of the Huffington Post McDonald's to shower bloggers with
[2:08:41.620 --> 2:08:47.820]  parties and gifts for positive post is McDonald's trying to bribe bloggers the
[2:08:47.820 --> 2:08:51.700]  fast-food media chain is a similar group of 400 some bloggers will reportedly
[2:08:51.700 --> 2:08:56.100]  receive free gifts and all expenses paid parties in exchange for positive post
[2:08:56.100 --> 2:09:00.180]  about the company yeah I mean and most the movies I see have like product
[2:09:00.180 --> 2:09:04.700]  placement from McDonald's and others ladies and gentlemen McDonald's food
[2:09:04.700 --> 2:09:11.100]  does not rot under a glass dish while other food does I mean it of course you
[2:09:11.100 --> 2:09:14.820]  know Monsanto's on its board part of it Bill and Melinda Gates are who are you
[2:09:14.820 --> 2:09:23.220]  Genesis they know exactly what they're doing and it's so simple we go out to a
[2:09:23.220 --> 2:09:28.140]  big herd of cattle they'd be having some kind of problem and I hadn't gone to vet
[2:09:28.140 --> 2:09:31.940]  school I just was listening to the vet I worked for and he's like you've got a
[2:09:31.940 --> 2:09:35.740]  mineral this and a mineral problem that get this type of feed with it mixed in
[2:09:35.740 --> 2:09:38.860]  and he would tell them what to get or what type of blocks to put out or what
[2:09:38.860 --> 2:09:42.380]  to add to their food they'd yes sir and sit there and write it down because he
[2:09:42.380 --> 2:09:46.940]  was in such demand he worked about 16 hours a day that's why I was glad my
[2:09:46.940 --> 2:09:49.580]  parents said okay you're not in trouble anymore you're allowed to come home now
[2:09:49.580 --> 2:09:53.020]  they sent me to the country for almost a year because you don't want to be in
[2:09:53.020 --> 2:09:57.460]  school you're out of school oh you think it was quote legal but I guess parents
[2:09:57.460 --> 2:10:00.380]  as guardians do what they want but that's why I was in high school five
[2:10:00.380 --> 2:10:04.980]  years because I wasn't in high school one of the years I was in East Texas and I
[2:10:04.980 --> 2:10:09.060]  tell those guys worked so hard but that's what they taught him at A&M just
[2:10:09.060 --> 2:10:12.740]  Adkins I worked for probably listening I know I'm on the radio there locally and
[2:10:12.740 --> 2:10:17.980]  still works easy he's a wild guy he's a character and and and Dr. Wallach I'm
[2:10:17.980 --> 2:10:22.460]  watching you right now on Skype turn to the side for people because I was
[2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:26.700]  watching you during the break and and you're getting a profile of a guy who's
[2:10:26.700 --> 2:10:33.700]  just about to be 73 years old and literally you could be 55 max 60 and
[2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:38.100]  I've seen you on stage recently on videos online I mean standing up and
[2:10:38.100 --> 2:10:42.340]  stuff you even look younger turn sideways for viewers not just radio
[2:10:42.340 --> 2:10:46.540]  listeners how's that I mean look at that you really do look like you're about
[2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:52.380]  57 well thank you Alex work hard at it been taking the 90 since I was nine
[2:10:52.380 --> 2:10:56.220]  years old actually started taking the 91 as nine years old began eating calf
[2:10:56.220 --> 2:11:01.140]  pellets and dog food and chicken food when I was nine and realized that I saw
[2:11:01.140 --> 2:11:05.380]  problems of doctors that I had they said my eyelashes are too long hit my
[2:11:05.380 --> 2:11:09.580]  glasses curled back and tickled my eyeballs and caused Tourette's I want
[2:11:09.580 --> 2:11:14.060]  to hear about this I've got to go to calls okay but exactly you're a
[2:11:14.060 --> 2:11:17.380]  veterinarian doctor you also got some other degrees but the point is how did
[2:11:17.380 --> 2:11:22.260]  you at nine though before that discover that if you because now people do like
[2:11:22.260 --> 2:11:26.800]  you actually use veterinary stuff themselves they found it's great how
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:31.300]  did you discover this at nine well my mom took me to an eye doctor because I was
[2:11:31.300 --> 2:11:35.740]  complaining my friend said I was possessed because I have this facial cramp
[2:11:35.740 --> 2:11:40.540]  the eye doctor said that this is caused by my eyelashes being too long hitting
[2:11:40.540 --> 2:11:44.660]  my glasses curling back and tickling my eyeballs was nine years old nice and
[2:11:44.660 --> 2:11:47.540]  now that can't be right so the next morning I went to the school library
[2:11:47.540 --> 2:11:51.700]  picked out a nurse's health book and I couldn't find long eyelashes or eyelid
[2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:56.140]  twitches in there so I just went word by word down the index and I found were
[2:11:56.140 --> 2:12:00.220]  cramps were caused by a calcium deficiency so I remembered before the bus
[2:12:00.220 --> 2:12:02.820]  would pick me up in the morning to take me to school I would have to feed the
[2:12:02.820 --> 2:12:07.660]  show calves with a bag full of special feed for them and had the analysis tag
[2:12:07.660 --> 2:12:12.220]  on it and it said calcium and protein so I went back home after school and
[2:12:12.220 --> 2:12:16.180]  began to eat these calf pellets and in three days time eating them for
[2:12:16.180 --> 2:12:19.900]  breakfast and after school and having them for snacks after dinner these calf
[2:12:19.900 --> 2:12:22.740]  pellets little alfalfa pellets with all the vitamins minerals attitude in three
[2:12:22.740 --> 2:12:26.940]  days time all those facial cramps went away and I wasn't possessed anymore so I
[2:12:26.940 --> 2:12:30.240]  knew when I was nine that doctors knew nothing about nutrition what is it with
[2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:34.020]  cattle what is it with cattle that when winter comes especially in cold areas
[2:12:34.020 --> 2:12:39.100]  they tell them put them on a winter mix of minerals what because your cows if
[2:12:39.100 --> 2:12:42.420]  they're left outside and they don't have the proper minerals they die now I know
[2:12:42.420 --> 2:12:46.220]  that but I don't know the reasons what what is that well the reason is you can't
[2:12:46.220 --> 2:12:50.460]  extract energy from fat without these minerals minerals required as co-factors
[2:12:50.460 --> 2:12:55.860]  to be able to extract energy from fat stores so you can be as fat as you want
[2:12:55.860 --> 2:13:00.060]  but you're gonna freeze to death if you don't have the capacity to extract
[2:13:00.060 --> 2:13:04.100]  energy from that and requires these minerals as co-factors to pull that off
[2:13:04.100 --> 2:13:07.980]  so that's like when I've been jogging twice a day or whatever and my calves
[2:13:07.980 --> 2:13:12.100]  start locking up I know I need a banana I need potassium well that's right you
[2:13:12.100 --> 2:13:15.220]  need potassium you need calcium you need magnesium and so we actually have a
[2:13:15.220 --> 2:13:19.260]  sports drink with a hundred nutrients in it is an add-on to the Alex package
[2:13:19.260 --> 2:13:23.100]  called rebound we actually made it for professional athletes and Olympic
[2:13:23.100 --> 2:13:27.060]  athletes so we have Olympic athletes who earned three gold medals using our
[2:13:27.060 --> 2:13:31.420]  products including our rebound and it's actually endorsed by them it's all an
[2:13:31.420 --> 2:13:35.460]  info work dot team info wars team dot com correct and you've also got a current
[2:13:35.460 --> 2:13:39.940]  NBA star who credits the fact he's been able to stay in even longer when he got
[2:13:39.940 --> 2:13:44.740]  on these minerals that's right Theo Ratliff started out in the Atlanta Hawks
[2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:48.860]  his career was over 12 years ago because he had bone to bone arthritis is only a
[2:13:48.860 --> 2:13:53.460]  28 years old had bone to bone arthritis cartilage popped off his hip he
[2:13:53.460 --> 2:13:57.700]  fractured his wrist catching a pass in a game we rebuilt him using the Alex pack
[2:13:57.700 --> 2:14:01.660]  appropriate for his body weight we made actually made this rebound sports drink
[2:14:01.660 --> 2:14:04.820]  with a hundred nutrients in it for him and he's made over a hundred and forty
[2:14:04.820 --> 2:14:08.900]  million dollars in contracts since the orthopedic surgeon said his career was
[2:14:08.900 --> 2:14:14.220]  over 12 years ago so his wife Christina really loves me I bet she does how were
[2:14:14.220 --> 2:14:17.460]  you able to get in contact with him because he tells the testimonies but I
[2:14:17.460 --> 2:14:21.180]  mean think of all people you haven't been able to reach yes we're able to
[2:14:21.180 --> 2:14:27.100]  contact him because another ex player from the Atlanta Hawks a guy by name of
[2:14:27.100 --> 2:14:35.420]  Mike Glenn who was was a great player he actually his records for jump shots
[2:14:35.420 --> 2:14:41.300]  still are there and he was called the stinger because he was so accurate you
[2:14:41.300 --> 2:14:45.380]  know like the stinger missile and we rebuilt his knees and he said he could
[2:14:45.380 --> 2:14:48.860]  have played for five more years if he'd have had our Alex pack before he'd
[2:14:48.860 --> 2:14:52.740]  retired and he was in the locker room talking to another player as Theo is
[2:14:52.740 --> 2:14:56.300]  actually taking his stuff out of the locker locker and going home because
[2:14:56.300 --> 2:14:59.500]  he was told his career is over there cancel his contract and he walked over
[2:14:59.500 --> 2:15:04.060]  and he says Mike will that stuff help me and Mike Glenn introduced me to Theo at
[2:15:04.060 --> 2:15:10.140]  that time took us 90 days rebuild him and he's been injury-free for 12 years
[2:15:10.140 --> 2:15:16.380]  ever since then amazing it is absolutely amazing info wars team.com folks and
[2:15:16.380 --> 2:15:20.780]  rebound is right there let's go to calls this is important we've got Kathy in
[2:15:20.780 --> 2:15:24.780]  Texas on 16 30 a.m. we're gonna go to her in a minute we got William let's go
[2:15:24.780 --> 2:15:29.580]  to William in Maryland William you're on the air with Dr. Wallach go ahead good
[2:15:29.580 --> 2:15:34.340]  afternoon Alex and doctor how are you yes sir how can we help you a couple
[2:15:34.340 --> 2:15:39.580]  things you know I'm glad you brought up a bit about the Alzheimer's my mother's
[2:15:39.580 --> 2:15:46.700]  dealing with early onset and I've been taking the tangy tangerine for a few
[2:15:46.700 --> 2:15:50.100]  months and that's helped me a bit I was wondering if there's something
[2:15:50.100 --> 2:15:54.340]  additional for her what you see appropriate oh well your phone's
[2:15:54.340 --> 2:15:59.060]  breaking up say that again what's wrong with your mother she's been diagnosed
[2:15:59.060 --> 2:16:05.340]  early all Alzheimer's well let me raise this Dr. Wallach Dr. Joel Wallach is our
[2:16:05.340 --> 2:16:09.700]  guest right now veterinary medicine and some other degrees but we have people
[2:16:09.700 --> 2:16:14.420]  like Dr. Russell Blalock who's a renowned brain surgeon and who says a lot
[2:16:14.420 --> 2:16:18.020]  of the same things that Dr. Wallach saying and he he's saying that a lot of
[2:16:18.020 --> 2:16:24.660]  these coconut oils the pure raw ones are good what's your take on that well
[2:16:24.660 --> 2:16:27.380]  first of all I have to say that Alzheimer's disease and the other
[2:16:27.380 --> 2:16:34.260]  dementias are physician-caused diseases Alex the brain is 75% this white matter
[2:16:34.260 --> 2:16:37.620]  of the brain when the white matter of the brain the myelin goes away and the
[2:16:37.620 --> 2:16:41.860]  nerve tangles the nerve fibers tangle up this is what causes Alzheimer's disease
[2:16:41.860 --> 2:16:45.460]  well there's white matter of the brain and that makes up 75 percent of your
[2:16:45.460 --> 2:16:48.860]  brain weight the installation material is a hundred percent cholesterol so when
[2:16:48.860 --> 2:16:52.060]  people go on a cholesterol-restricted diet they take cholesterol lowering drugs
[2:16:52.060 --> 2:16:57.460]  like statin drugs it actually is the cause basic cause of Alzheimer's and so
[2:16:57.460 --> 2:17:00.780]  this is one of the biggest crimes ever perpetuated now they want to put statins
[2:17:00.780 --> 2:17:04.620]  in the water and give it to children as young as three yes right and so this is
[2:17:04.620 --> 2:17:07.820]  where you want to stand in front of your kids and say we're not going to let this
[2:17:07.820 --> 2:17:11.700]  happen this you're not going to apply this crime to my kids or my grandkids and
[2:17:11.700 --> 2:17:16.380]  I'll be there if anybody as an expert witness for you if they want to put you
[2:17:16.380 --> 2:17:20.700]  in jail for not what can he do for his mother what what like 12 eggs a day
[2:17:20.700 --> 2:17:24.980]  essential fatty acids I mean what does she do well by Joe of Alex I believe you
[2:17:24.980 --> 2:17:31.100]  got it yep but what is your mom way she's probably about 160 okay then she
[2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:35.340]  needs it yeah she needs to what she needs to eat 12 to 15 eggs a day they
[2:17:35.340 --> 2:17:39.340]  have to be either soft poached or soft boiled soft scrambling butter not fried
[2:17:39.340 --> 2:17:44.260]  not over easy she needs to take two Alex packs per month as one full dose of
[2:17:44.260 --> 2:17:47.980]  each of the three products twice a day I would also have her add in what we call
[2:17:47.980 --> 2:17:53.420]  de-stress capsules as capital D dash stress there's a single vitamin that
[2:17:53.420 --> 2:17:57.580]  actually causes a look-alike disease you know of Allison disease is called
[2:17:57.580 --> 2:18:01.100]  Korsakov syndrome it's actually a deficiency of a single vitamin it was
[2:18:01.100 --> 2:18:05.620]  actually a written up in 1712 by a Japanese naval surgeon so we've known
[2:18:05.620 --> 2:18:09.860]  the cause of that one since 1712 it's just like scurvy you're saying yeah
[2:18:09.860 --> 2:18:14.140]  vitamin C and they're saying no you vitamin C is evil that's right and so
[2:18:14.140 --> 2:18:18.620]  again you take this de-stress and in many cases people been diagnosed like this
[2:18:18.620 --> 2:18:22.180]  fellow in Charlotte North Carolina diagnosed by the top car by the top
[2:18:22.180 --> 2:18:25.580]  neurologist in North Carolina is having Alzheimer's disease we're able to cure
[2:18:25.580 --> 2:18:30.100]  him according to them they use the current here were not me for two in two
[2:18:30.100 --> 2:18:33.380]  weeks time and they were ready to put him in a hospice can you get your mother
[2:18:33.380 --> 2:18:38.380]  to eat 12 soft poached eggs a day I'd probably have to move in with her but I
[2:18:38.380 --> 2:18:42.540]  can certainly steer towards heading that direction well it's worth it God bless
[2:18:42.540 --> 2:18:45.700]  you sir let's jam in another call here gonna have to keep wallet this is too
[2:18:45.700 --> 2:18:49.220]  important let's continue real fast Matt in Wisconsin go ahead you're on the
[2:18:49.220 --> 2:18:57.140]  air hello Alex yes sir yes my question is for the both of you I'd like to know
[2:18:57.140 --> 2:19:03.100]  what would happen if you gave somebody a blood transfusion and you gave them cold
[2:19:03.100 --> 2:19:08.300]  blood and I'd like you to expand on how do you know that they did that to Ronald
[2:19:08.300 --> 2:19:14.020]  Reagan I know I had to dig out the news reports but they said that they gave him
[2:19:14.020 --> 2:19:17.220]  cold blood on accident I remember seeing that the news reports just like they had
[2:19:17.220 --> 2:19:21.140]  it you know the Hinkley family met with the bushes the night before that's in
[2:19:21.140 --> 2:19:27.180]  the Denver post you can just search engine that and that'll come up yeah
[2:19:27.180 --> 2:19:33.100]  well from my standpoint I believe that poor president Reagan I was given
[2:19:33.100 --> 2:19:37.220]  Alzheimer's disease because he was put on statin drugs he was on a cholesterol
[2:19:37.220 --> 2:19:40.820]  restricted diet because he had quote the best doctors in the world on quote and
[2:19:40.820 --> 2:19:45.060]  he just chose poorly he listened to them instead of his veterinarian yeah but
[2:19:45.060 --> 2:19:48.140]  as for you asking me about the cold blood deal I know I've read that in
[2:19:48.140 --> 2:19:51.660]  different news articles you can look it up people like asked me where's the
[2:19:51.660 --> 2:19:54.340]  FEMA camp document I mean they're just all over the place go look them up I

[2:24:16.300 --> 2:24:21.100]  blitz coming up in the next segment representative King suggest administration

[2:24:26.620 --> 2:24:32.020]  about stage terror reports there we've got some big news on China and Iran it's
[2:24:32.020 --> 2:24:37.720]  all coming up in the next segment all I can say is I don't believe what Dr.
[2:24:37.720 --> 2:24:42.220]  Wallach is saying I have seen it demonstrated I knew it was good products
[2:24:42.220 --> 2:24:45.740]  a year and a half ago when I had him as a sponsor promoted it some but when I
[2:24:45.740 --> 2:24:53.660]  saw it dramatic like off-the-charts results I mean sure 40 something pounds
[2:24:53.660 --> 2:24:57.500]  I'm doing exactly what I was doing before eating the same stuff everything
[2:24:57.500 --> 2:25:01.780]  just taking a few of the products and I'm like I got to take all of them now and
[2:25:01.780 --> 2:25:07.100]  the effects I've seen everywhere else it's nothing less than amazing but the
[2:25:07.100 --> 2:25:12.220]  truth is amazing the system knows this and is suppressed this until just 30 40
[2:25:12.220 --> 2:25:16.100]  years ago they ground up bone meal and put it in all the bread because it would
[2:25:16.100 --> 2:25:21.860]  have the amino acids and minerals in them they don't do that now they know
[2:25:21.860 --> 2:25:25.180]  what they're doing they know it the average doctor doesn't they're
[2:25:25.180 --> 2:25:30.740]  compartmentalized let's jam in Craig you're on the air with Dr. Wallach go
[2:25:30.740 --> 2:25:37.580]  ahead hi how you doing have a few things one is a live two questions and
[2:25:37.580 --> 2:25:41.820]  basically my boss has type 2 diabetes and I started using the tangy
[2:25:41.820 --> 2:25:45.540]  hand during a few days ago but I've been researching it a lot well that by
[2:25:45.540 --> 2:25:51.420]  itself cure his type 2 diabetes or at least change it type 2 diabetes again
[2:25:51.420 --> 2:25:57.780]  we've known for 60 years Greg that it's a simple mineral deficiency disease with
[2:25:57.780 --> 2:26:02.580]  a concurrent damage to the cell wall so it doesn't recognize insulin so if he
[2:26:02.580 --> 2:26:06.100]  changes is a diet the thing that got him in trouble no fried foods no processed
[2:26:06.100 --> 2:26:10.900]  meats of nitrates and nitrites absolutely no oils of any kind no
[2:26:10.900 --> 2:26:14.660]  cooking oils no salad dressings if you eat canned fish it's fine but they're
[2:26:14.660 --> 2:26:18.700]  gonna be packed in water not oils and take these sweeties with that appropriate
[2:26:18.700 --> 2:26:28.500]  for body weight and what is your boss way okay then he would need three Alex
[2:26:28.500 --> 2:26:31.780]  packs per month and one full dose of each of the three products of breakfast
[2:26:31.780 --> 2:26:38.020]  lunch and dinner he would not need nine of the sweeties a day three breakfast
[2:26:38.020 --> 2:26:41.460]  lunch and dinner make sure he takes his fasting blood sugar every morning
[2:26:41.460 --> 2:26:45.100]  before he medicates himself because the blood sugar will drop sometimes they
[2:26:45.100 --> 2:26:50.580]  seem to drop in as much as quickly as 12 hours within two or three days the
[2:26:50.580 --> 2:26:56.260]  actual blood sugar will drop say from 200 even with injectable insulin 300 500
[2:26:56.260 --> 2:27:01.020]  with injectable insulin it'll drop down to as low as 60 and so they will have to
[2:27:01.020 --> 2:27:04.580]  make sure they're adjusting their medication based on their blood sugar
[2:27:04.580 --> 2:27:09.300]  levels and usually I've seen it as quickly as two days sometimes it's
[2:27:09.300 --> 2:27:13.300]  taken a couple of months to wean off their medication based on these
[2:27:13.300 --> 2:27:16.180]  supplement programs again this is the bottom line you got to get off the
[2:27:16.180 --> 2:27:19.740]  processed foods and the trans fats and you got to get the basic minerals the
[2:27:19.740 --> 2:27:25.100]  body needs so it sounds easy but it takes actually I mean I haven't even done
[2:27:25.100 --> 2:27:28.860]  half of what I need to and I've lost 40 plus pounds and feel great and all
[2:27:28.860 --> 2:27:32.260]  sorts of stuff's happening I'm not gonna get into it I have a family member
[2:27:32.260 --> 2:27:37.020]  whose hair was falling out a year ago I'm just gonna leave it at that a woman
[2:27:37.020 --> 2:27:42.020]  and the hair is coming back in okay I appreciate your call doc what's
[2:27:42.020 --> 2:27:47.180]  happening there now what's happened with the hair well the hair of course has
[2:27:47.180 --> 2:27:51.820]  it with the skin and the hair is something very interesting if you look
[2:27:51.820 --> 2:27:55.980]  at the Chinese and you look at the Japanese you rarely see a Japanese or
[2:27:55.980 --> 2:28:00.700]  Chinese guy with white hair you rarely see them go bald and they're taking an
[2:28:00.700 --> 2:28:05.220]  enormous amounts of minerals in the Japanese and Chinese diet and so if
[2:28:05.220 --> 2:28:10.820]  you take in these minerals in the Alex pack hair will come back I've seen
[2:28:10.820 --> 2:28:15.540]  male pattern baldness in women because they're gluten intolerant they can't
[2:28:15.540 --> 2:28:19.140]  absorb minerals whatever little bits in their diets and you get them on a gluten
[2:28:19.140 --> 2:28:23.380]  free diet you throw the Alex pack at him appropriate for body weight and the
[2:28:23.380 --> 2:28:26.740]  hair will come back their nails are good their skin looks like an epidemic of
[2:28:26.740 --> 2:28:30.980]  women with thyroid and hair falling out yes and these are all reversible by

[2:33:16.700 --> 2:33:20.540]  you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect an ugly
[2:33:20.540 --> 2:33:25.380]  misforned little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[2:33:25.380 --> 2:33:32.180]  being words mr. Wordsworth that have no substance and no dimension Alex Jones
[2:33:32.180 --> 2:33:36.140]  here back live we've got a lot of info to cover in a short time to get there but
[2:33:36.140 --> 2:33:40.900]  I want to jam in quick calls with a quick question and quit a quick comment by
[2:33:40.900 --> 2:33:46.420]  Dr. Joel Wallach who is our guest today and all of his information and research
[2:33:46.420 --> 2:33:51.740]  is an info wars team.com and it is revolutionary it's common sense but
[2:33:51.740 --> 2:33:57.500]  it's revolutionary but reading up on feeding different things to farm
[2:33:57.500 --> 2:34:01.900]  animals to make them docile we then see the very same things being done to the
[2:34:01.900 --> 2:34:06.700]  general population and the fluoride all of it you were trying to get into that
[2:34:06.700 --> 2:34:11.500]  before I went to break dock. Yes of course you make people mentally deficient
[2:34:11.500 --> 2:34:16.060]  for instance lithium we've known for a long time lithium deficiency causes
[2:34:16.060 --> 2:34:20.020]  depression and lithium is a trace mineral it's not a drug but although they
[2:34:20.020 --> 2:34:23.900]  would like to prescribe it as a drug it's actually a trace mineral so you make
[2:34:23.900 --> 2:34:28.540]  people lithium deficient you make a magnesium deficient you make them excess
[2:34:28.540 --> 2:34:33.380]  fluoride at that same time you put them on whole grains and it's like putting
[2:34:33.380 --> 2:34:38.580]  people in the feedlot they just become as steers no hormones and lots of big
[2:34:38.580 --> 2:34:42.860]  belly fat you know like a beer belly and they just sit around and are happy
[2:34:42.860 --> 2:34:48.540]  watching football they're not interested in being free patriots anymore. How do
[2:34:48.540 --> 2:34:54.740]  you naturally boost testosterone in a male? Ten eggs a day I had four for
[2:34:54.740 --> 2:34:57.900]  breakfast with a steak and sliced tomatoes I'm gonna have four again this
[2:34:57.900 --> 2:35:04.020]  evening plus a steak and all my supplements. Testosterone Alex is a
[2:35:04.020 --> 2:35:09.100]  steroid hormone 95% of all steroid hormones are cholesterol so you by
[2:35:09.100 --> 2:35:13.620]  weight they're cholesterol. So you need that the raw stuff is in the eggs of the
[2:35:13.620 --> 2:35:17.220]  steak? The eggs in the steak throw away the chicken and eat the skin just not
[2:35:17.220 --> 2:35:22.220]  fried you want to eat red meat not tofu you need to eat eggs for breakfast not
[2:35:22.220 --> 2:35:26.180]  cereal you want to be a steer in the feedlot eat cereal for breakfast you
[2:35:26.180 --> 2:35:31.820]  want to be a man eat eggs. And you are about to be 73 pal and you look like you
[2:35:31.820 --> 2:35:36.180]  could kick my butt right now. Well I eat eight to ten eggs a day plus two
[2:35:36.180 --> 2:35:42.060]  steaks a day and I do take the Alex pack take two Alex packs I had one for
[2:35:42.060 --> 2:35:48.700]  breakfast plus my 78 tablets pills and capsules I make sure that you and I will
[2:35:48.700 --> 2:35:52.900]  be the last men standing. Well hopefully if I can start doing all the stuff you're
[2:35:52.900 --> 2:35:58.300]  doing my goodness okay real fast let's talk to Kathy in Texas 1630 listener up
[2:35:58.300 --> 2:36:03.660]  in the DFW area go ahead you're on the air. Yes thank you for taking my call
[2:36:03.660 --> 2:36:08.860]  I'm on the Alex pack and I'm feeling great but now I need to figure out what
[2:36:08.860 --> 2:36:13.660]  to do for my grandson who is almost three he's been diagnosed under that
[2:36:13.660 --> 2:36:21.220]  spectrum of autism he barely talks from a baby he had really bad eczema and he
[2:36:21.220 --> 2:36:26.260]  seems to be allergic to almost everything including AIDS. Get him off all
[2:36:26.260 --> 2:36:29.560]  television I would say that first because the studies are showing that's
[2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:32.620]  causing the neurons to develop incorrectly doctor what are you gonna say.
[2:36:32.620 --> 2:36:36.540]  Okay well the fact that he has eczema tells me he has a gluten intolerance he
[2:36:36.540 --> 2:36:39.540]  must get off of all wheat barley rare oats instantly if you got it in the
[2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:43.900]  house everybody in the house must be on a gluten-free diet no wheat barley rare
[2:36:43.900 --> 2:36:48.620]  oats get out of the house now as soon as you hang up nobody in the house can
[2:36:48.620 --> 2:36:51.540]  eat this stuff cause crumbs get in the furniture and he crawls around he'll
[2:36:51.540 --> 2:36:55.980]  get it from someplace or the washer close together for autism he needs the
[2:36:55.980 --> 2:37:02.980]  Alex pack how much is this kid weigh. Probably about 20 pounds he's not really
[2:37:02.980 --> 2:37:10.260]  thriving. He had a bunch of vaccines. Yes of course. Well we can repair the damage but
[2:37:10.260 --> 2:37:13.340]  he needs to be off of all gluten no wheat barley rare oats he needs to be on the
[2:37:13.340 --> 2:37:18.860]  Alex pack if he weighs 20 pounds the osteo FX plus he can have a teaspoon of
[2:37:18.860 --> 2:37:22.580]  that twice a day as one teaspoon for 20 pounds of body weight twice a day you
[2:37:22.580 --> 2:37:28.500]  mix up the beyond tangerine in two scoops and say what about sunlight. Well
[2:37:28.500 --> 2:37:33.820]  sunlight will help you know help repair the damage but it's an inside thing
[2:37:33.820 --> 2:37:38.780]  Alex inside meaning he's got to get off the gluten so he can absorb the omega
[2:37:38.780 --> 2:37:43.660]  3's the zinc all this stuff the lithium and if he gets on a gluten-free diet he
[2:37:43.660 --> 2:37:46.620]  can go out in the sun just be careful I'm one in the morning Sunday so he
[2:37:46.620 --> 2:37:52.340]  doesn't get burnt and give him two teaspoons of that beyond tangerine a
[2:37:52.340 --> 2:37:56.500]  day one a breakfast one a dinner give him two of those EFA plus as a breakfast
[2:37:56.500 --> 2:38:01.780]  and dinner get him off of gluten and no sugar no sugar natural process and I had
[2:38:01.780 --> 2:38:05.540]  people kids who are nine years old they hadn't talked in nine years is up in
[2:38:05.540 --> 2:38:10.260]  Canada they had not talked in nine years and just in six weeks in this
[2:38:10.260 --> 2:38:14.180]  program the Alex pack getting off the sugar getting off of gluten in six
[2:38:14.180 --> 2:38:17.780]  weeks they're running around giggling singing reading grabbing their mom's
[2:38:17.780 --> 2:38:22.100]  hand hugging her saying come on let's play mom and they hadn't talked one word
[2:38:22.100 --> 2:38:26.820]  in nine years. God bless you ma'am it's incredible information all I know is
[2:38:26.820 --> 2:38:31.300]  Aaron Dykes lost 91 pounds and I've seen this reverse all-timers and people and
[2:38:31.300 --> 2:38:34.140]  it's because people don't have the minerals they need and they're not
[2:38:34.140 --> 2:38:38.420]  getting the exercise they need and all this briefly Dr. Wallick what does the
[2:38:38.420 --> 2:38:41.100]  gluten do because I mean they're now admitting this is what's screwing people
[2:38:41.100 --> 2:38:45.500]  up you've been saying for 30 years what is the gluten doing well gluten makes
[2:38:45.500 --> 2:38:49.620]  your intestines look like you've been eating poison ivy for salads it's a
[2:38:49.620 --> 2:38:53.420]  contact enteritis it's not an allergy to wheat although medical doctors and
[2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:56.580]  their little P brains make that mistake they think it's an allergy and they
[2:38:56.580 --> 2:38:59.900]  will test you for it and you're negative it's not an allergy it's it like if you
[2:38:59.900 --> 2:39:03.060]  roll around a poison ivy you're going to get a contact dermatitis even though
[2:39:03.060 --> 2:39:06.300]  you're not allergic to poison ivy if you eat gluten and you have a gluten
[2:39:06.300 --> 2:39:09.820]  intolerance your intestines look like you've been eating poison ivy for a
[2:39:09.820 --> 2:39:15.220]  salad in Mayo Clinic in 2009 came out and said right there in Minneapolis
[2:39:15.220 --> 2:39:22.100]  Roger Rochester Minnesota that the 30% of Americans now have gluten
[2:39:22.100 --> 2:39:25.580]  intolerance and in enlightened communities around universities it's 80 out

[2:42:50.820 --> 2:42:55.020]  normal guys name is David Dietrich's very wealthy man in Moose Jaw Canada and
[2:42:55.020 --> 2:43:00.300]  this is written up in Cantonia and we've seen so many literally hundreds and
[2:43:00.300 --> 2:43:03.900]  hundreds of people with Parkinson's disease actually go back to normal what
[2:43:03.900 --> 2:43:07.700]  is causing the epidemic and neurological disorders not just Parkinson's doctor
[2:43:07.700 --> 2:43:11.820]  thank you caller yeah well MS Parkinson's disease Lou Gehrig's disease the four
[2:43:11.820 --> 2:43:14.900]  different dementias and this is primarily caused by doctors getting
[2:43:14.900 --> 2:43:20.660]  people on statin drugs not telling them they need the Alex pack and they're not
[2:43:20.660 --> 2:43:24.340]  getting the nutrients in the food because as you pointed out very very well
[2:43:24.340 --> 2:43:28.060]  done Alex said that we used to put bone meal in our bread we used to put the
[2:43:28.060 --> 2:43:31.100]  wood ashes in our garden and wood ashes are the minerals that the trees sucked
[2:43:31.100 --> 2:43:35.260]  up out of the gown and since we're not putting our wood ashes in our gardens
[2:43:35.260 --> 2:43:38.620]  anymore because we're using electricity and propane and natural gas and we're
[2:43:38.620 --> 2:43:41.140]  not putting bone meal in our bread anymore we're not supplementing because
[2:43:41.140 --> 2:43:45.340]  doctors said don't supplement and we're using the statin drugs allura
[2:43:45.340 --> 2:43:51.460]  cholesterol even the FDA came out two months ago Alex and said that cholesterol
[2:43:51.460 --> 2:43:55.220]  lowering drugs statin drugs actually cause Alzheimer's disease actually came
[2:43:55.220 --> 2:43:58.940]  out and said that two months ago I remember having a doctor playlock on six
[2:43:58.940 --> 2:44:02.700]  seven years ago saying it and how long have you been saying that I said that
[2:44:02.700 --> 2:44:09.460]  first in 1971 wow dr. Wallach you really are impressive I'm not just saying that
[2:44:09.460 --> 2:44:14.380]  and and again folks this is real information and again this is trying
[2:44:14.380 --> 2:44:19.780]  to to trying to keep you from getting sick instead of just treating the
[2:44:19.780 --> 2:44:23.220]  symptoms of the problem that you've got from a deficiency and the
[2:44:23.220 --> 2:44:28.780]  informations at info wars team dot com dr. Wallach thank you so much for
[2:44:28.780 --> 2:44:32.180]  spending so much time with us today well thank you so much Ali so you're a
[2:44:32.180 --> 2:44:35.820]  blessing to the world you're blessing in America God bless you and God bless
[2:44:35.820 --> 2:44:40.740]  America well thank you my friend there goes dr. Wallach and I've got a big
[2:44:40.740 --> 2:44:46.620]  group of news stories I want to go through here today China buying oil from
[2:44:46.620 --> 2:44:51.180]  Iran with yawn that's a big item I got a bunch of others that I'm gonna get to
[2:44:51.180 --> 2:44:54.740]  here in just a moment I'm sorry to those other callers we just ran out of time
[2:44:54.740 --> 2:44:58.020]  here I went for like an hour and 40 something minutes with him because it's
[2:44:58.020 --> 2:45:01.500]  so interesting because so much of what he was already talking about I already
[2:45:01.500 --> 2:45:07.820]  know from you know the old folk wives tales common sense you know grandma says
[2:45:07.820 --> 2:45:12.260]  take your cod liver oil you won't you I mean it's simple stuff like that and the
[2:45:12.260 --> 2:45:17.780]  system it knows this and and so they're deploying systems to make us docile and
[2:45:17.780 --> 2:45:21.180]  sick and you can see we've gone from the healthiest in the world to the most
[2:45:21.180 --> 2:45:25.820]  unhealthy I mean we lead the world and everything bad and it's because the new
[2:45:25.820 --> 2:45:31.740]  ruler hates our guts and they attack us militarily through covert means this is
[2:45:31.740 --> 2:45:36.260]  an infiltration and that's why I've really gotten behind this because I've
[2:45:36.260 --> 2:45:44.380]  seen the results when I start seeing results in something I get behind it now
[2:45:44.380 --> 2:45:47.180]  this first thing that I mentioned at the start of the show here it is it's up on
[2:45:47.180 --> 2:45:51.060]  info wars.com I'm not gonna play at all but it's so sick if that me and Aaron
[2:45:51.060 --> 2:45:54.500]  talked about this last night I was saying the headline should be rap video
[2:45:54.500 --> 2:45:59.820]  glorifies TSA sexual assault that's what it does but Aaron's headline is rap
[2:45:59.820 --> 2:46:06.180]  video glorifies TSA groping in sexy pat down fantasy and it's amazing this is
[2:46:06.180 --> 2:46:11.540]  what's on mainline TV and it shows the TSA sexually groping people like it's
[2:46:11.540 --> 2:46:15.620]  fun and I see this all over TV they're they're glorifying it they have shows
[2:46:15.620 --> 2:46:19.020]  where shows the Hollywood stars being groped like it's a gladiatorial you know
[2:46:19.020 --> 2:46:22.620]  fun to laugh at them in fact we bring me that busted magazine in I bought at the
[2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:26.460]  store this morning I meant to show that all over the U.S. they have local
[2:46:26.460 --> 2:46:32.100]  magazines and newspapers where they thank you where they make fun of people
[2:46:32.100 --> 2:46:37.140]  you know that's not it I had the whole thing that's just a sliver of it well
[2:46:37.140 --> 2:46:43.220]  it doesn't matter maybe I left it in the car this is somebody else's busted these
[2:46:43.220 --> 2:46:46.620]  are everywhere and on the cover you know it's busted and it comes out every week
[2:46:46.620 --> 2:46:49.620]  and everybody laughs at it makes fun of all people that have been arrested like
[2:46:49.620 --> 2:46:55.220]  they're already guilty they're turning all this into a giant spectacle and
[2:46:55.220 --> 2:46:59.100]  they're telling police arrest people for no seatbelts whatever get them in the
[2:46:59.100 --> 2:47:04.220]  system train people to be used to being touched that's what the TSA is doing so
[2:47:04.220 --> 2:47:09.460]  here is some short clips I'm gonna play the whole thing sex alcohol and wild
[2:47:09.460 --> 2:47:15.220]  power grabbing TSA agents a hip-hop video from rapper Sean Paul plays out a
[2:47:15.220 --> 2:47:19.980]  fantasy celebrating the TSA sick policy and molesting law-abiding passengers as
[2:47:19.980 --> 2:47:26.260]  a sexy pat down and now they're coming out and saying that get ready for more
[2:47:26.260 --> 2:47:29.620]  invasive because they stopped another underwear bomber but instead of having a
[2:47:29.620 --> 2:47:32.620]  show trial and witnesses seeing the government get him on the plane they
[2:47:32.620 --> 2:47:36.020]  just say we don't know where he is or where it happened this just happened and
[2:47:36.020 --> 2:47:39.260]  Obama covered it up because he didn't want to brag about it now they're gonna
[2:47:39.260 --> 2:47:42.260]  have an investigation of that to make it look like they're covering up how
[2:47:42.260 --> 2:47:46.100]  they're keeping us safe I mean the stuff they cook up the folks that ship guns
[2:47:46.100 --> 2:47:50.180]  in a Mexico in the Second Amendment or who get paid off publicly to let Wall
[2:47:50.180 --> 2:47:53.340]  Street Rob us that's in the news today let's go ahead and go to a short clip of
[2:47:53.340 --> 2:47:55.940]  this video here it is
[2:47:59.620 --> 2:48:04.180]  the good-looking lady comes in and the women all grab on her and they paddle
[2:48:04.180 --> 2:48:07.260]  people with the wands
[2:48:07.260 --> 2:48:16.380]  and the TSA guys really turned on by the good-looking women so he's gonna have
[2:48:16.380 --> 2:48:21.780]  to grope her this is actually what goes on when you fly I mean you see a really
[2:48:21.780 --> 2:48:25.500]  looking woman you go she's gonna get it they come in like piranha and hit them
[2:48:25.500 --> 2:48:29.380]  hard they have a little button they can hit to make it beat oh look the TSA is
[2:48:29.380 --> 2:48:38.420]  groping he's enjoying it it's fun my gosh the lesbian woman once the woman
[2:48:38.420 --> 2:48:42.540]  you know there's that big actress and it's also supermodel says yeah the women
[2:48:42.540 --> 2:48:46.500]  just go right in their pants and they let him know hey baby you know this is
[2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:50.140]  sorry to talk about stuff like this on the air this is what goes on America
[2:48:50.140 --> 2:48:54.020]  that's enough of that pride that's not even the worst part the worst parts at
[2:48:54.020 --> 2:48:57.940]  the start or they're drinking all the whiskey and then the TSA people have
[2:48:57.940 --> 2:49:01.380]  the paddles and they're gonna paddle them don't even show that don't even show
[2:49:01.380 --> 2:49:05.420]  that with a family audience this is part of the total acclimation we're going
[2:49:05.420 --> 2:49:11.220]  through as a country rat video glorifies TSA groping in sexy pat down
[2:49:11.220 --> 2:49:16.540]  fantasy that's that info wars.com stocks fell a couple of percentage points
[2:49:16.540 --> 2:49:20.580]  today on news that you know that they're gonna raise taxes on the rich but
[2:49:20.580 --> 2:49:25.140]  but that's just a front folks the ultra rich are the ones they're actually gonna
[2:49:25.140 --> 2:49:31.500]  get that money in banker bailout so we've got those reports as well this is
[2:49:31.500 --> 2:49:37.820]  a big one on the global economy front China buying oil from Iran with Yon when
[2:49:37.820 --> 2:49:41.260]  Iraq or Libya tried to get people together to come out with a gold denar
[2:49:41.260 --> 2:49:45.660]  gold-backed denar it was over well how how are the globals gonna go out for
[2:49:45.660 --> 2:49:50.100]  China one of the biggest owners of our fake debt so there's all this globalist
[2:49:50.100 --> 2:49:54.700]  double crossing going on again I don't trust the Chinese blood thirsty
[2:49:54.700 --> 2:49:58.460]  leadership any more than I trust our scumbag leadership so we're in deep
[2:49:58.460 --> 2:50:03.580]  trouble this is BBC news China buying oil from Iran with Yon China is buying
[2:50:03.580 --> 2:50:08.660]  crude oil from Iran using its currency the Yon and Iranian diplomat has said
[2:50:08.660 --> 2:50:13.220]  oil transactions are usually settled in dollars and all over the world folks are
[2:50:13.220 --> 2:50:16.420]  moving away from it but US sanctions make it difficult for Iran to accept
[2:50:16.420 --> 2:50:20.860]  payments in US currency Iran is using the revenue to buy goods and services
[2:50:20.860 --> 2:50:25.620]  from China Mohammed Rais Fahid Iran's ambassador United Arab Emirates
[2:50:25.620 --> 2:50:32.020]  confirmed China is the biggest buyer of Iranian crude oil exports so they buy
[2:50:32.020 --> 2:50:37.700]  around 20 30 billion each year so that is a big move away from the dollar as the
[2:50:37.700 --> 2:50:42.260]  evaluation continues but everything's fine because we have a good government
[2:50:42.260 --> 2:50:49.540]  that cares all about us there's another report CIA bomb plot get ready for new
[2:50:49.540 --> 2:50:54.220]  invasive airport screening they're now talking about butt bombs and they may

[2:54:12.460 --> 2:54:14.460]  what would you turn away to
[2:54:14.460 --> 2:54:17.460]  and then what if you saw
[2:54:17.460 --> 2:54:19.460]  all of the things that's wrong
[2:54:19.460 --> 2:54:21.460]  would you stand tall
[2:54:21.460 --> 2:54:25.460]  yeah in Australia they're talking about chest x-rays
[2:54:25.460 --> 2:54:30.460]  because they might have breast bombs and now they're talking about last week
[2:54:30.460 --> 2:54:35.460]  they may have to do behind closed doors bigger and more invasive checks in case
[2:54:35.460 --> 2:54:40.100]  you have a bomb inside of you this is ridiculous and then somebody might bomb
[2:54:40.100 --> 2:54:43.460]  the outside of the airport so they're saying up checkpoints there and then
[2:54:43.460 --> 2:54:46.260]  oh there might be a bomb on the highway well let's just have a checkpoint there
[2:54:46.260 --> 2:54:52.580]  it's ridiculous and then the main Al Qaeda openly works for the globalist and
[2:54:52.580 --> 2:54:58.420]  now they've had this new CIA derails plot with Al Qaeda underwear bomber and
[2:54:58.420 --> 2:55:02.340]  then I actually heard this morning on Fox radio news they go no one knows where
[2:55:02.340 --> 2:55:07.580]  he is or where he went or who he is really but they stopped him underwear
[2:55:07.580 --> 2:55:12.620]  more sophisticated firecracker bomb and everybody's supposed to just roll
[2:55:12.620 --> 2:55:19.860]  around in fear don't get me not the not the deadly underwear bomb this is
[2:55:19.860 --> 2:55:24.620]  getting so ridiculous separately for all you young people out there in this
[2:55:24.620 --> 2:55:29.100]  brave new world you know it's fun I read about young people every day going out
[2:55:29.100 --> 2:55:37.940]  even middle-class rich kids stealing shoplifting like it's fun to do now
[2:55:37.940 --> 2:55:41.300]  they're trying to move databases over where they're gonna have your juvenile
[2:55:41.300 --> 2:55:45.660]  arrest on there and you're not gonna get jobs in the new police state so I'm
[2:55:45.660 --> 2:55:48.700]  telling young people the culture says it's cool to do stuff don't be part of
[2:55:48.700 --> 2:55:56.220]  it woman fired from job at Wells Fargo for shoplifting in 1972 that's Fox news
[2:55:56.220 --> 2:56:04.660]  out of Milwaukee she's 58 years old and she says she stole a couple dresses
[2:56:04.660 --> 2:56:08.140]  when she was right out of high school to get a job and she doesn't have a
[2:56:08.140 --> 2:56:13.180]  criminal record since then but you know why she really got fired she lied on the
[2:56:13.180 --> 2:56:17.300]  questionnaire but the other issue is they probably wouldn't hire for that the
[2:56:17.300 --> 2:56:20.940]  military will take all sorts of people but they won't take somebody if they've
[2:56:20.940 --> 2:56:24.420]  got bad credit because they believe or they're even kicking them out for that
[2:56:24.420 --> 2:56:28.980]  because they believe then they'll steal if they don't have money it's all part of
