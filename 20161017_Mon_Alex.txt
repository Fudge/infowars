[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  From the InfoWars.com News Center, deep behind you'll find out more about the InfoWars.com
[00:28.000 --> 00:35.000]  News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:35.000 --> 00:43.000]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy cankoper.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:46.000 --> 01:03.000]  You want it baby, you're about to get it.
[01:03.000 --> 01:27.000]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy cankoper.
[01:27.000 --> 01:36.000]  Monday, October 17, 2016, we are now only 21 days out from the most historical general election in US history.
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  A referendum on globalism.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours, coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  We've talked a lot about this.
[01:51.000 --> 01:58.000]  Historians have pointed out, futurists have predicted it, mathematicians have confirmed it.
[01:58.000 --> 02:14.000]  We are headed towards some type of singularity, or a cascade of singularity type events, where time is basically accelerated, developments are exponential.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  And we're in the middle of that acceleration right now.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  Make no mistake.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  We have thousands of emails now a day.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  It's exponential.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  My prediction of two weeks ago was correct.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  When I blew up at Assange and I said, you better start exponentially releasing this because there won't be time.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  That's exactly what he did.
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  And it is now gone from every week to every three days, every two days, every day.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  There's no way Hillary will survive this, even if she stills the election and gets in.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  She's been wrecked, she's been defeated, she's been torn to pieces.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  Even MSM now understands that.
[02:48.000 --> 02:57.000]  But they want to be able to hoax the public that stealing the election is a referendum against anti-globalism and against nationalism.
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.000]  It's not going to work.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  I've been listening to NPR, local NPR national.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  I've been reading the New York Times.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  I mean, they have gone full decepticon.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  I mean, it is incredible to watch them burn themselves down.
[03:09.000 --> 03:23.000]  It's been reported that upwards of $20 million in a new ad buy has been allotted for an ad featuring myself and saying Donald Trump is just talking points from us and taking things I've said out of context.
[03:23.000 --> 03:30.000]  This is like them running ads of him out of context saying, you know, all illegals are all Mexicans or criminals.
[03:30.000 --> 03:42.000]  And say it blows up in their face if he doesn't apologize. And if he goes in there Wednesday at this final debate, the final showdown and savages her from head to toe, up one side and down the other, he will win.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  Big time.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  I don't care how big a theft they're involved in.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  And by the way, Newt Gennrich's a little bit of inside baseball out.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  I don't like Newt Gennrich because I know he has been a globalist.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  I know he's extremely smart.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  I know he knows basically everything that's going on.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  And I've seen him do some double crossing.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  That said, when he tells the truth, nobody does it better.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  I've got a clip of him yesterday on CNN.
[04:07.000 --> 04:14.000]  It is just a veritas over the top, which is why it makes me dislike him so much when I know he's being deceptive.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  A lot of these decepticons are not very good at it.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  It's almost entertaining.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  When Gennrich does it, it's not fun because he does it so well.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  But he just in seven minutes, I've got to air the whole thing.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  It's totally true.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  I mean, it's perfectly set.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  Down to Trump winning by 15 points.
[04:31.000 --> 04:39.000]  That's a little slip on Trump internal polling, which they don't want the general public to be too optimistic because they know they're planning to steal it.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  They want everybody to go vote.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  But he's 10, 15 points ahead in the battleground stage, folks.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  This sex thing didn't even hurt him.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  He went up at last week's debate.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  That's why Trump says we're winning.
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.000]  They're freaking out, getting ready to steal it because they've got all these fake polls where they sample way more Democrats saying he's going to lose.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  They're getting everybody ready, folks.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  They're getting everybody ready for a theft.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  And Trump's not going to stand for it.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  The Clinton Foundation has quite a nasty legacy in the nation of Columbia.
[05:05.000 --> 05:13.000]  Despite Hillary saying that she's very proud of the foundation's work, many of its, quote, beneficiaries in Columbia are wondering why.
[05:13.000 --> 05:24.000]  Now, the nonprofit global philanthropic empire has raised nearly two billion from foreign governments and various wealthy private donors all in an effort to tackle global development and health problems.
[05:24.000 --> 05:30.000]  Well, much attention now is being dedicated to what it's doing on the ground because of the disclosures from WikiLeaks.
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  We know that Columbia is ground zero for drug wars and has been since the early 80s.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  It's plagued with uneven development and low intensity conflict.
[05:37.000 --> 05:48.000]  We also know, ironically, that Columbia has been the home to a vast oil and natural gas holding of a man who's reportedly the foundation's largest individual donor, Canadian financier Frank Gustra.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  In other words, global development includes a pay-to-play for wealthy Clinton Foundation donors.
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  While exploiting poverty and extracting money, that's what it's looking like.
[05:57.000 --> 06:24.000]  Margaret Hall reporting for infowars.com.
[06:27.000 --> 06:37.000]  It's one of the amazing products and free shipping when you sign up for auto ship and you're able to promote the products to friends and family and neighbors in your community and make money while helping people at the same time.
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.000]  Another win-win.

[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  The app is brand new.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  This is the first release and it was completely built from the ground up.
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks that tipped into deceive you.
[07:37.000 --> 07:46.000]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  But infowars live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.
[07:51.000 --> 07:59.000]  So download infowars live today at infowars.com and learn what's really going on instead of being spoon fed lies by the mainstream media.
[08:21.000 --> 08:32.000]  Now only 21 days you can cut the tension with a knife.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  The Clinton campaign has announced a new ad by upwards of 20 million dollars.
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.000]  Targeting yours truly.
[08:40.000 --> 08:51.000]  And of course Donald Trump using infowars and our statements they believe out of context to deceive the viewers and listeners in this country will only blow up in their face.
[08:51.000 --> 09:00.000]  And Trump has responded obviously by tweeting infowars and present planet articles out today showing that it's all about loyalty in the foxhole.
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  Something these backstabbers know nothing about but she's sending out emails to everyone new video.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  This is who Donald Trump listens to.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  Now you have to understand something.
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  They're social engineers and they know and they write books about this.
[09:16.000 --> 09:25.000]  They brag about this over and over again that they're trying to move the Overton window.
[09:25.000 --> 09:33.000]  And the Overton window is a psychological historical term developed what in the 50s of what is seen as basic and normal and right.
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  And if you want to change let's say the nuclear family being seen as what we should aim for as the standard.
[09:39.000 --> 09:47.000]  You begin to introduce ideas that are so radical it drags you away from what was normally seen as kosher.
[09:47.000 --> 09:59.000]  And folks trying to move the Overton window do things that look like they're way out in space and don't make sense to attempt to drag it from the normalcy into the new paradigm.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  Now you could say that's what I do.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  But you see I'm just countering the globalist and the radical things they're doing so I'm not really radical.
[10:06.000 --> 10:14.000]  I'm just reporting on what they're doing so it sounds pretty wild to say there's a secret global treaty that takes over basically everything in our lives called the TPP and it's secret.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  But then now it's been ratified globally.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  It's been made public and it's worse than I said.
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  Because we had previous versions of other treaties that had failed.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  We knew it was a hodgepodge of those.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  We knew exactly what it was and sure enough it came out and it was exactly what we said it was.
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  So see we're not engaged in social engineering trying to pull you towards some radicalism.
[10:34.000 --> 10:45.000]  We're trying to point out how the whole process is working and then it does sound pretty wild what we're covering what we're saying like Hillary plans to use executive orders to take your guns.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  What's in the new WikiLeaks.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  She's going to use executive orders to take your guns.
[10:49.000 --> 11:01.000]  Unidear the United Nations small arms disarmament body has been asking presidents for 20 years to use executive orders to sign on to treaties outside of Congress and ban basically all firearms.
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  So when I tell you she wants to take them with executive order I know because I already know the blueprint.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  That's what I keep trying to explain to everybody.
[11:11.000 --> 11:20.000]  95% of what we cover is on record like they misrepresent 9 11 truth they say I'm the founder of it question before 9 11 question on the day of 9 11.
[11:20.000 --> 11:29.000]  I said it's being used to take your freedoms by criminals of the government working with radical Islam Saudi Arabia to launch attacks on non Wahhabi countries like Iraq and take it over.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  They carry out 9 11 our media and our government blames the wrong country.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  We go in and take over Iraq.
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.000]  They're our enemy now they turned that into the talking point from popular mechanics that I believe firefighters blew up the World Trade Center.
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  They actually say that never said it.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  It was the firefighters that came out and exposed that there were bombs in the buildings.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Now do we know exactly who did all this.
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  No, all I'm telling you is the official story you're getting in true.
[11:57.000 --> 12:07.000]  And by the way, there isn't a special forces soldier. There isn't a demolitions person. There isn't a architecture engineer I talked to that doesn't concur with that.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  And I've interviewed the police two different police officers on air, including a deputy fire chief.
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  That's another person.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  Lee and Mackinac did it's got like 5 million views on YouTube.
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  When they told them there's a countdown.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  We're going to blow up building seven.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  We heard the countdown.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  And it was coming from the Red Cross. Do you know the Red Cross is folks.
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  You can go behind enemy lines even 500 years ago out of Switzerland.
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  The Red Cross and I'm not bashing you if you were in the Red Cross has a lot of good things it does.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  But it is the main global intelligence agency front.
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  So you want to put this in your ad Hillary the Red Cross ran the countdown to blow up building seven.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  No one would expect the Red Cross would they.
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.000]  So when I say Red Cross I mean intelligence operatives there with the countdown.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  And then I have the news saying building seven has fallen building seven has fallen.
[13:02.000 --> 13:10.000]  An hour before it fell CNN and Aaron Brown's running around and hadn't fallen fell in its own footprint symmetrically from fires.
[13:10.000 --> 13:19.000]  And then 25 minutes later BBC World BBC BBC announced building seven the Solomon Brothers building has fallen and Jane Graham turns around hasn't fallen.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  And later they admitted they were given that feed from Reuters that had fallen.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  They had jumped the gun.
[13:26.000 --> 13:34.000]  That was the CIA base. Do you know the CIA's main East Coast base outside of Arlington, Virginia.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  Do you know where it's based building seven.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  They had at least 10 floors of it.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Look it up.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  Look it up.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  Now I'm going to stop right there. I've gone for 10 hours. I've made six films on the subject.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  I've written a book on the subject.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  It needs to be exposed. It needs to be investigated.
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  Just like our government's funding radical Islam today. It's the very same program radical Islam is real.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  It's being brought into attack us. We need to deal with it.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  Our borders are wide open. That's the false flag.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  The jihadis are real. The false flags bringing them in.
[14:07.000 --> 14:16.000]  Now, before I go any further, we've been vindicated by all the 20, you know, something pages coming out in Congress at the 28 pages.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  The fact that Saudi Arabia was there and there was an order to stand down and not investigate them.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  And the FBI just at the time went public.
[14:22.000 --> 14:29.000]  They were ordered to stand down in Texas and in Arizona and in Florida and in Minnesota and in Oklahoma.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  I interviewed some of them.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  I interviewed the translators like Sabelle Edmonds who heard it all the chatter going on.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  They were ordered to stand down and the hijackers were able to carry out their attack.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  Now, once they got on board, the only real air phone calls that came from sternices was there was gas.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  They were gassed on the planes.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  I don't know what happened, but I know the official stories alive.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  Now, they're going to misrepresent and say, oh my God, Trump supports us.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  I love Trither.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  Trump is ready for that.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  Trump knows about 9 11. He brought up Jeb Bush.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  He brought up they were running security in the World Trade Center.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  He brought up the Saudi connection.
[15:01.000 --> 15:14.000]  He brought up the Carlisle group meeting with Bush senior in DC the morning of 9 11 at the same table with them at the Carlisle weapons quarterly meeting.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  And that's when you notice Jeb dropped out real fast.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  So you want to throw Trump in the briar patch.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  Go ahead.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  That's exactly where he wants to go.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  You people are walking into our trap again.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  Thank you.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  Great job.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  Now, let me give you the info.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  I don't want to go to these phone calls or give a number to take phone calls, go to all these video clips I've got.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  Here's what we've got today to cover.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  We have more and more of the nine Trump sexual assault accusers.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  It turns out inviting him to functions just a few months ago or a year ago or two years ago.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  Many years after they claim he did this, say, please come to my restaurant.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  Please come to our event.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  Sending emails to him.
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.000]  And when he doesn't, then all this stuff comes up reality show contestants from a decade ago.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  And they're saying just a few months ago, please come to our restaurant when you're in town.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  And then Trump couldn't come to their restaurant when he's in town.
[16:10.000 --> 16:17.000]  So now he grabbed her on an airplane and Gloria all read she's going to save us and the ladies crying.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  It was so horrible.
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  Now all these witnesses are coming out and the brothers and the cousins and the sisters are saying none of that happened.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  And woman after woman we're hearing had a crush on Donald Trump from their families.
[16:30.000 --> 16:39.000]  And then they tell Trump go into your emails and then Trump staff goes in and there they are.
[16:39.000 --> 16:52.000]  The letters now six of the nine women, it turns out we're begging Trump for TV jobs or begging Trump to take him out to dinner or begging Trump to come to their restaurant or begging, begging, begging.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  We have this from their families.
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  And that's why I've got to give credit here and I just continually noticed this.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  I see some bad stuff from them.
[17:01.000 --> 17:11.000]  If you talk about mainstream old newspaper chain that actually is really classical liberal and actually tells the truth.
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  Other than say something like a drudge or an info wars or a Breitbart.
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  McClatchy McClatchy just continues to tell the truth.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  They've got articles out about real election fraud going on against Trump.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  They've got articles.
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  There are way too many coincidences in assaults on Trump.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  And they go through this huge article.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  This is Andrew Malcolm special to McClatchy.
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.000]  And the investigative journalist breaks down how it's synthetic manufactured ABC NBC.
[17:41.000 --> 17:49.000]  While they're attacking Trump, they're the ones calling thousands of women data mining thousands of women that were on TV shows.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  You know, they're getting the info from NBC, his former employer.
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  They're going through they're going through all the pageants.
[17:55.000 --> 18:05.000]  They're calling thousands of women and they've come up with nine who the evidence is pointing towards want to be stars, want to get attention, want to be back in the news.
[18:05.000 --> 18:15.000]  And the problem is when it comes out that just a few months ago or another case a year ago or two years ago, they're asking Trump out on a date.
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  They're asking Trump to come to the restaurant.
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  They're asking Trump to give him a TV show again.
[18:19.000 --> 18:26.000]  And then magically when Trump doesn't respond, they get scorned, they get mad, they get angry.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  And this article, I'm going to post the whole thing in FullWars.com.
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.000]  It's that important.
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  There are way too many coincidences on assaults on Trump.
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.000]  And you need to read this for yourself because it just goes through how the whole thing is scripted.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  You can see the scripting how this is all coming out, obviously.
[18:41.000 --> 18:49.000]  With 20-something days out, 21 days now, so they can't respond, all being done by design.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  Meanwhile, Republican headquarters gets firebombed.
[18:51.000 --> 18:57.000]  CNN and others say they deserve it because they raise the rhetoric and the tone, oh, Trump's so horrible.
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.000]  I'll hear them on NPR, call them a racist, a bigot, a sexual assaulter.
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.000]  And then say, we can't believe the Republicans have such mean rhetoric to say the media is against him and it's going to be rigged.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  Boy, he's dangerous and crazy.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  But here are the articles.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000]  Trump's sexual assault accuser sent glowing email to his assistant in April.
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  Summer Zervos, former apprentice star.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  Oh, how horrible.
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  He had her on a big hit TV show who alleges she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump.
[19:26.000 --> 19:33.000]  He sent an email to Trump's assistant in April, praising the GOP candidate and asking him to come to their restaurant when he was in town.
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.000]  I'm going to skip the break.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  Sorry.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  It's too important.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  So, we have all this going on and it goes on and on.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  Woman after woman after woman after woman.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  We've got the email on screen.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  I'm certain you are a very easy woman.
[19:48.000 --> 19:58.000]  I am a unique situation being that I am the only former apprentice who operates the business where Mr. Trump supporters can walk in, express their admiration for him and inquire about my experience.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  Oh, they could find out how great you are.
[20:00.000 --> 20:06.000]  Mr. Trump has a great deal of support, including Huntington Beach, California.
[20:06.000 --> 20:12.000]  He has witnessed both my highs and lows operating a small business and I am pleased to report that my business is good.
[20:12.000 --> 20:16.000]  Sunny's restaurant has a long history of making people feel special.
[20:16.000 --> 20:20.000]  We hire a diverse crew and embrace anyone who is honest while working hard.
[20:20.000 --> 20:23.000]  How dare him give her all that attention for her restaurant years ago?
[20:23.000 --> 20:24.000]  He's such a bad man.
[20:24.000 --> 20:26.000]  Mr. Trump is cut from the same cloth.
[20:26.000 --> 20:32.000]  Oh, we hire a diverse crew and embrace anyone with an honest while working hard.
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.000]  Oh, honest and working hard.
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  Mr. Trump is cut from the same cloth.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  He's honest and works hard.
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  I would greatly appreciate reconnecting at this time.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  He will know my intentions are genuine.
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  Thank you, Summer Zervos.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  We've got a bunch of the same story, other women.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  Same deal.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  And then people that were on the plane going, I remember being on the plane talking to Trump.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  You weren't even sitting by that lady.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  What?
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  On and on.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  On and on.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  Little petty garbage.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  Meanwhile, I'm going to give you the big bombshell right now.
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  I don't even feel like I am up to what you're about to see.
[21:12.000 --> 21:22.000]  I don't even want to present this at the start of the third hour today because I don't think I'm going to even do it justice because they just got back in last night.
[21:22.000 --> 21:31.000]  And they've got hours and hours of footage of stuff that is HBO award-winning if it was put together right.
[21:31.000 --> 21:36.000]  We have people dying on video in Haiti this last week.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  The place looks like a hydrogen bomb went off in Biggs's words.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  We have UN helicopters flying around everywhere.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  We have children bleeding to death.
[21:46.000 --> 21:53.000]  We have Gary Haven meta-vacking them into Port-au-Prince and the UN will give no medical aid.
[21:53.000 --> 22:05.000]  If private interests like Haven fly in and give food, which he does every week, they will then fly it into the villages and the people will die without it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  Hillary is stealing the money that's supposed to go to him.
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.000]  Billions now, total.
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  That's admitted.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  Keeps 94-plus percent and they're saying no aid has come in in years.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  She's still collecting money.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  Where's the media?
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  This is so cold-blooded.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  This is black people.
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  These are people really dying, really in trouble, who've had their infrastructure money and everything's stolen.
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  Colonialism over and over again.
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  The Clintons literally launched their huge foundation worth over $2 billion.
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  It's raised over $6 billion.
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  $2 billion from Haiti.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  They steal almost all of it.
[22:37.000 --> 22:43.000]  A little bit they claim is for the charity, pays for their little junkets and things too, Haiti.
[22:43.000 --> 22:50.000]  And even mainstream media like the Washington Post admits they did nothing with it.
[22:50.000 --> 22:57.000]  And I'm just saying, wow, nothing on ABC News, nothing on NBC, nothing on NPR.
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  I listened to NPR this morning while I was exercising for about 45 minutes and it sounded like a joke.
[23:02.000 --> 23:10.000]  Like some future authoritarian radio program that was so over the top, it's meant to be satirical.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  And just the breathlessness over, he's a sexual assaulter.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  He is an assaulter.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  He is an assaulter.
[23:19.000 --> 23:26.000]  And then they'd have a guest on after like 15 minutes will go, well, now it hadn't been proven yet.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  Oh, yes, it's been proven.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  There's all these women.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  You don't think sexual assault's a bad thing?
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  What about Hillary coming up for a sexual assault that's real where Bill settled?
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  What about her funding radical jihadis?
[23:35.000 --> 23:46.000]  What about the UN using the water supply unit that costs more than $15 million and then using it as a toilet to defecate it?
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  And then giving the defecation water to the Haitians.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  It killed more than 10,000.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  That's admitted by the UN itself.
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.000]  And there's the UN as usual sitting around doing nothing with these big, giant, white helicopters we've got on video.
[23:59.000 --> 24:09.000]  And there are just Gary Haven and Biggs and Michael Zimmerman trying to video loading on these cargo planes, loading people that are dying on.
[24:09.000 --> 24:15.000]  One guy died by the time they got him to the hospital.
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.000]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff we've got on tape.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  Little kids with broken backs.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  I mean, and the UN is doing nothing.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  They won't give anybody any aid.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  You name it, they're there to make you give them the food aid.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  And then they fly off with it to do Lord knows what.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  And where's the Clinton Foundation?
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  They talked to people all over.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  They go, we've never seen them.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  They give us nothing.
[24:38.000 --> 24:46.000]  They all know Gary Haven who for well, since the since the earthquake has been flying in there at least every month.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  It's powerful.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  And Gary Haven's going to join us from Haiti via phone, probably sat phone.
[24:52.000 --> 25:01.000]  And then we're going to have Joe Biggs and Michael Zimmerman in here ahead of Roger Stone, who had now concurred.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  He said, the sources are you called it Alex is what he told me last night.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  He says it's crazy.
[25:05.000 --> 25:13.000]  It looks like they're October surprise will be a huge cyber attack, which they've announced on Russia and then even military incursions in Ukraine to start a war.
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  That way you can really, I guess, cancel the election or divert everybody, you know, with that news while you steal it.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  I mean, this is such a critical time to be alive right now.
[25:22.000 --> 25:34.000]  But to McClatchy's credit, any time I'm looking at mainstream media and something is incisive, something's on target, something is actually well researched.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  It's from them.
[25:36.000 --> 25:44.000]  They're the ones that have exposed Warren Buffett getting $400 plus billion of the banker bailout money himself, almost $10 billion.
[25:44.000 --> 25:51.000]  And then running around saying raise your taxes because he gets the money.
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.000]  That's a problem.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  Trump didn't hit him hard enough when he said Buffett takes the same exemptions I do.
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.000]  No, no, he has tax-free foundations, bro, and then sets up dummy corporations and bankrupt some and then gets taxpayer money.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  He's total criminal in my research view.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  You have taken some of the loopholes that you have admitted you would get rid of.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  But until we have a level playing field, you can't or you'll be bankrupt.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  He's totally honest.
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.000]  He goes, I buy ties from Mexico because they cost a third the price or high quality and no one wants to buy ties that cost too much.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  So as soon as we fix these deals, I'll be able to make my ties in America.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  I have done that myself.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  Don't get a shirt made in America, $10, sell it for $22.
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  Nobody wants it.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  They want the one that's $15.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  You pay for $5.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  They just won't buy the one made in America.
[26:36.000 --> 26:43.000]  We got all, everything's made in America on one side by the same shirt made in Mexico or Honduras for $15 instead of $22.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  You buy the one made there.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  That's your choice.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  You did it.
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  And I don't blame you.
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  The point is we have unfair trade deals.
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  And as someone trying to operate a real business to fund this liberty movement, I've been sitting in the very same seat.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  Trump is.
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  Anybody else who's run a business knows that.
[27:01.000 --> 27:09.000]  The problem is most Americans are disconnected and I, you know, more and more when I see somebody driving in the fast lane, 55 miles an hour and a 70, I'll pull up and look.
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  And they've always got an education sticker.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  They're always a professor or they've got a Hillary sticker or a Bernie sticker.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  And I saw a guy this morning.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  I was late to work.
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  I was almost out of gas.
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  I pulled over.
[27:19.000 --> 27:26.000]  And as I pull in, this guy pulls in front of me and parks right in the middle between the pumps where I couldn't hardly pull in.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  I saw the education sticker.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  He got out.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  He got mad because he could barely get out of his car.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  And I said, hey, how are you doing?
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  And he's like, he ignores me.
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  He walks around because he's too much of a God and I couldn't help it.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  I didn't pull my iPhone out and tape it.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  But I looked at him and I said, who are you supporting in the election?
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  He looked at me.
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  He looked down and he goes, why?
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  And I said, I'm just asking.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  He said, well, Hillary, of course.
[27:50.000 --> 27:59.000]  And I just should have videotaped it because who else every time parks in the middle between the two gas pumps where someone else can't get gas.
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  These people, it's their religion to drive 55 out of 70.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  It's their religion to block your way.
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  They're unhappy energy vampires.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  They're demons.
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  And it's time to exercise the entire nation of these people.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  When I say that, that's a figure of speech.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  I mean, we need to understand who they are and they get these little clubs of rats.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  They all hate each other.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  They're all dishonorable.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  They're all incredibly unhappy.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  I mean, I've been inside NPR, I guess, several times locally and nationally.
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  It is the most soulless, unhappy, empty group singing in the same thing.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  They are pathetic.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  And they know they are.
[28:39.000 --> 28:46.000]  But there he was just because I'm already pulling in, he pulls in and there's a car parked here.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  And I see him on this side.
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  So I'm not going to park here because there's two pumps, but I'm not going to park here because I'm trying to be nice.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  So I go, no, let's go over here.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  And he just stops right in the middle.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  And I went, you know, I'm late.
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  I'm just going to squeeze in here.
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  I can barely get out against the gas tank, scratch my car.
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  I guess the pump caught up.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  He's looking at me, kicking barely out.
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  I think I already bumped my other door.
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  I'm like, whatever, I don't care.
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  He looks so pissed.
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  It's like, dude, you just thought you'd have a little power over me.
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.000]  You look back, you saw me, you thought you'd piss on me.
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  Didn't happen, did it, boy?
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  And the point is, is that I know who you are.
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  I knew who you were.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  I analyzed and assessed you in seconds, but I confirmed it.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  You're probably a community college professor.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  You're still huge in massive debt.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  You hope the government gets you out.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  He was like 65.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  You think that's your mommy and your daddy.
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  You hate prosperity.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  And all you can do is piss on Texans because you came here from California.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  You've already collapsed.
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.000]  Now I'm going to get to all the huge news, incredible clips, and so much more straight ahead.
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  The latest on WikiLeaks as well.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  Stay with us.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.000 --> 30:01.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  The bank accounts of RT News in the UK have been frozen.
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  Nat West Bank froze the Russian broadcasters' accounts
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  according to the editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan who tweeted,
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  They've closed our accounts in Britain.
[30:13.000 --> 30:14.000]  All our accounts.
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  The decision is not subject to review.
[30:16.000 --> 30:19.000]  Now, RT says the bank gave no explanation for the decision.
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  Nat West is an arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland,
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  and it's refusing to service the broadcaster.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  Nat West Bank wrote,
[30:26.000 --> 30:29.000]  We've recently undertaken a review of our banking arrangements with you
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  and reached the conclusion that we will no longer provide these facilities.
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.000]  The bank said its decision was final and they're not prepared to enter into any discussion.
[30:37.000 --> 30:40.000]  Here in the States, the president is threatening a cyber war with Russia,
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.000]  which could escalate quickly into a nuclear one,
[30:43.000 --> 30:46.000]  all in an attempt to keep Hillary's deleted emails a secret.
[30:46.000 --> 30:51.000]  In the US, the CIA leaked to NBC News that the president has requested options
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  for a cyber attack on Russia.
[30:53.000 --> 30:56.000]  Regulator Offcom said it's, quote, for biased reporting.
[30:56.000 --> 31:25.000]  If you decide, I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowars.com.
[31:25.000 --> 31:54.000]  You will find a brain force and other game-changing products
[31:54.000 --> 32:00.000]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  ZOITS and others.
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  we use decades-old scientific research
[32:34.000 --> 32:37.000]  to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  that uses our proprietary SpyJurex herbal processing technique.
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research,
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.000]  and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  If you wish to find Deep Cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing,
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  visit infowarslife.com.
[32:56.000 --> 33:23.000]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[33:23.000 --> 33:27.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.000 --> 34:00.000]  Let me give you a preview of what's coming up.
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  I just talked to Gary Haven during the break.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  He is delivering emergency food and got behind schedule.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  He's going to be in the air when he's supposed to be on with us.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  And that's fine. I want to move it to tomorrow or Wednesday
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  because I want to get these videos together.
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  They just got back last night on a cargo plane to Houston
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  and then drove into Austin.
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.000]  We have got all this footage of dead and dying children.
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  I mean, it's just unbelievably powerful.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  We've got the Haitians in riot mode against the Clintons,
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  who they know stole almost all the money that they would have gotten
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  when the original catastrophe hit them, the earthquake.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  And so I don't want to just, we have so much big breaking news,
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  we just kind of release it without any fanfare.
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  I want to have articles written on this.
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  I want to have the videos prepared.
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  I'll voice it today.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  And then we can have Joe Biggs and Michael Zimmerman,
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  who are witnesses to all this and part of it in here with us
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  when Haven's on.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  So I wanted to do the big official breakdown Wednesday,
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  but let's just get Haven on tomorrow and then also Wednesday continue.
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.000]  We hate Hillary.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  Haitians at Democratic National Convention say,
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  Hillary Clinton belongs in jail.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  Wait till you actually go to Haiti.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  Something I wish Donald Trump would have done.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  But Info Wars has done it.
[35:20.000 --> 35:21.000]  And I've donated.
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  I'm bragging to the aid mission, but that's just what we're doing here
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  because, you know, I'm a evil white man.
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  But the point is, is that Hillary and Obama and all these people,
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  along with Bill, have been milking Haiti, robbing it.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  Oh yeah, the Obamas have been involved as well.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  You're promoting the whole scam.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  And it goes in the Clinton Foundation that goes right back to them.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  This is a giant money laundering operation.
[35:45.000 --> 35:46.000]  And it's truly sickening.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  And Gary Haven in the videos makes some really powerful points.
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  But we've got riots on video, you name it.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  But even Politico Magazine, the Clintons Haiti screw up,
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  as told by Hillary's emails, it's their own daughters saying,
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  people are dying.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  What are you doing?
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  Libby is not a screw up.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  Haiti is not a screw up.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  The derivatives scam they created is not a screw up.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  All of this is on purpose.
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.000]  They're organized criminals that have gotten away with murder.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  Now I'm going to get into all the news here.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  And there is a ton of it on the polls, on the attacks on Trump,
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  on the latest in these WikiLeaks.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  There is just so much here.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  Michael Savage is joining us tomorrow.
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.000]  It was already scheduled last week.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  I'm so excited about this because this is the perfect time to have him.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  I knew it five, six years ago when he got banned along with thousands of others,
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  but he was the most prominent from flying into the UK by the prime minister
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  that they were going to set up a no fly for what they call people that are radicals
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  or people that, you know, promote anti-UN stuff.
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.000]  Just like you see people getting arrested in Germany for criticizing open borders.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  And Facebook's working with them.
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  That's the model.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  And I knew just like that they want to know gun by list.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  They just magically put you on it.
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.000]  You can't buy guns.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  And then now you can't fly.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  I knew that was part of a precedent.
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  Globally, they were beta testing because it always is.
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  We have the WikiLeaks.
[37:10.000 --> 37:11.000]  Roll that daily.
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.000]  Sharia Law.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  Hillary kept Savage on hate list.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  It's all there.
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  Exactly what we said it was because it's kind of like one of jigsaw puzzle.
[37:19.000 --> 37:25.000]  You've already say it's got 200 pieces and you've already put say 190 in the last 10.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  I mean, you know where they go.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  You go, oh, that's the that's the parrot's eye.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  The parrot's eye.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  Oh, that's the parrot's foot.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  That's a branch the parrot's sitting on.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  We're putting the last pieces in.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  This is not hard.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  We know exactly what they're going to do.
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  And they have totally pre-prepped everybody for war with Russia.
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  Physical war.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  They're trying to get a no fly zone.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  They're trying to get the military to develop a plan.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  This is public to start shooting down Russian aircraft.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  That'll start World War Three.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  Don't believe me.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  I'll play General Dumford.
[37:56.000 --> 37:57.000]  I played it probably 20 times.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  We played again from two weeks ago.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  Hew up Dumford, please.
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.000]  How about the Secretary of the Army saying the same thing?
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  How about the Russian President?
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  You've got international criminals that have taken this country over.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  They're trying to start a big war 21 days out from the election.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  And Joe Biden said it last Wednesday.
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.000]  It's when they taped it.
[38:20.000 --> 38:21.000]  They put up this war clip Sunday.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  He said even more yesterday, we're going to hit Russia.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  So are they ever going to know what's going to hit them?
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  And then if Russia responds, they'll call it a cyber war.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  And then they can say, oh, the Russians are involved in the election
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  or they can launch a false flag and frame the Russians.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  I mean, you can see this coming a mile away.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  A few months ago, I said, what false flags might they pull?
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  Economic collapse.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  Deutsche Bank's about to go under.
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  That's happening naturally.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  Bigger than Lehman Brothers.
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  50-fold probably.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  Some estimates are higher.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  You've got all this other military stuff going on in Syria.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  You've got them spending billions to get Black Lives Matter turned into
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  like a national communist movement whose mission they admit is to burn down
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  buildings and kill police.
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.000]  All you've seen probing by the Soros destabilization brigades,
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  they lit Ukraine on fire in one day.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  And it was the same thing where the attacks were very small
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  for several years in probing attacks to condition the police and military
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  to not think it was a big deal when the big one came.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  That's a classic standard tactic.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  It was executed for a year before the Panama invasion in the late 1980s.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  1989 were for a year.
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.000]  They did touch and go with helicopters, flashbangs, fire machine guns
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  until when the real attack came, the Panamadian military,
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  which was known for not being cowards, put to you that way,
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  just stood down for 20 minutes.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  And by the time they stood down for 20 minutes, those gunships,
[39:49.000 --> 39:56.000]  Puff the Magic Dragon, C-130s had just annihilated everything.
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  They had drones with particle beams frying people.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  I mean, it was a lot of fun. That's been partially declassified.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  And so, yeah, they had particle beams mounted on C-130s in the late 1980s.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  Imagine what they got now.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  But it doesn't matter if we've got all these super weapons.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  The Russians have got a bunch of hypersonic cruise missiles,
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  long-range missiles, medium-range missiles, nuclear submarines.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  You name it.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  There's tens of thousands of weapons on both sides.
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.000]  You don't win this war, but they're pushing it because Hillary never loses.
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  When she's representing child molesters, she wins.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  When she's robbing little old ladies' bank accounts,
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  and Arkansas swindles at whitewater, she gets away with it.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  When she's killing her boyfriend, she gets away with it.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  When she's deleting her emails and funding Al-Qaeda in ISIS, she gets away with it.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  When she's selling tainted blood out of the Arkansas blood banks
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  to hemophiliacs worldwide, over 100,000 died conservatively.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  It came out in court. She gets away with it.
[40:54.000 --> 41:00.000]  There's a firebomb in the hemophiliac society in Canada.
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  The same night, they did the same thing to the doctor that was working in the hospital
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  off of the prison that first exposed it.
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  I had the guy on, by the way.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  I called him out a month later, said, we come back on.
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  He said, you didn't know what we got broken into in firebomb?
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  They said, they're going to kill my kids now. I'm done.
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  I called the hemophiliac society. Same thing.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  Canada. Hit the same night.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  They're really, really nice people. Hillary came.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  She saw all the little kids die.
[41:28.000 --> 41:34.000]  Then here's the entire media structure hooking their wagon up to this witch.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  We're in the hands of evil right now.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  Now, speaking of funding our operation, it's essential to fund our operation,
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  obviously, in this storm, in this tempest we're in, all of us together.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  And the more funds we get, the more we're able to sustain what we're doing
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  and hopefully expand and get a few more camera people and editors and reporters.
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.000]  We need to get too deep here. We don't have a second string.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  We're trying to develop it.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  And we're ending today, knockout, which is nine different compounds
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  from Valerian root to L-trip to fan to melatonin
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  that give you healthful, deep, restful sleep.
[42:11.000 --> 42:17.000]  It's $14.95. Normally the same strength bottle with just melatonin is $19.95.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  This has got eight other ingredients.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  It really is an amazing deal.
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  Knockout available at infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  Now, this week's new special, this special is ending today, but for the next week,
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.000]  we have a mega special, Get Brain Force for a massive 25% off at infowarslife.com.
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  Similar new tropics are already like $80, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  This one's normally $39.95.
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  It's now $22.
[42:45.000 --> 42:51.000]  Because it's already discounted off of the regular price.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  And we discounted another 25%.
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  And it is the known new tropic, an incredibly low price, super high quality
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  Brain Force available at infowarslife.com.
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  Brain Forces already has hundreds of 5 star reviews and you can read for yourself
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  at infowarslife.com along with all of the research, other information.
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  Even the crew here at infowars can't stop taking Brain Force.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  And now it helps them double their efforts.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  Secure your Brain Force with 25% off while supplies last.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  And I also want to add that's key because we've got another shipment coming in
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  scheduled at the end of the month.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  And so it looks like this is going to sell out probably the next week at this price.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  And it's the last run ever.
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  Get your third edition, final edition of Hillary for Present shirt
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  with legalizedfreedominfowars.com on the back.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  When these sell out, that's it.
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.000]  And there's the other limited edition, Lock Her Up, Made in America shirt, $22.
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.000]  It's got on the front, the Gadget and Snake, poiling up around Hillary.
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  And your purchases fund this operation.
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.000]  Also, we're selling Hillary for Present bumper stickers in packets of 10 up to 100.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  At cost, Hillary for Present 2016, all orders get a few thrown in,
[44:00.000 --> 44:06.000]  but it sends up the shipping cost too much for you so we don't throw 100 in as I would do.
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.000]  But if you pay $17, you get 100.
[44:11.000 --> 44:18.000]  That is at costinfowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.000]  This is a powerful information warfare weapon, especially if you're in a battleground state.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  Also, wear shirts, red shirts on election day just to have a visual cue to show everybody
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  just how many Trump voters there were out there because here's the deal and I'm getting to this in a moment.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  They're moving to still the election.
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.000]  I was listening to NPR again this morning and it was NPR National.
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.000]  Rockefeller Radio. I mean, you're talking New World Order.
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  You want to hear talking points out of their mouth? This is it.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  And they're like, it's totally insane.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  He claims there's election fraud. There's evidence of it with no proof.
[44:51.000 --> 44:56.000]  Even though he's giving proof in New York, the head of elections saying they have people voting over and over again for Democrats.
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  It's happening in Florida. All this information is coming out. Election fraud is famous.
[45:01.000 --> 45:09.000]  But Obama says it doesn't exist, but then federalizes elections to stop imminent Russian fraud for Trump.
[45:09.000 --> 45:14.000]  So the Russians are trying to cheat for Trump.
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  Crazy conspiracy theory.
[45:16.000 --> 45:23.000]  But the Democratic machine caught stealing the 1960 election in Illinois and in Texas.
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  Certified, admitted all historians admit all the other election frauds we know of.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  No, no, no, no, no certified election fraud a few years ago in Ohio.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  Thousands of other cases around the country locally.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  But no, no, no, he's insane.
[45:35.000 --> 45:41.000]  And then five minutes later, they reported on Homeland Security taking over the elections to stop the Russians from stealing it.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  So it's crazy. It doesn't exist.
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  Trump's a nut.
[45:46.000 --> 45:55.000]  Not the next story, but one story over is, I mean, folks, they're deliberately trying to scramble the common sense thinking of their listeners.
[45:55.000 --> 46:01.000]  I mean, this is on purpose to just break their minds.
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  This is so incredible.
[46:03.000 --> 46:12.000]  They will not run with six of the nine women that they'd send him emails recently and asked for jobs or asked for him to come to their business or and said how great he was.
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  And we only know this because their family members are flipping out going.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  Donald Trump really helped her.
[46:16.000 --> 46:17.000]  Donald Trump did this.
[46:17.000 --> 46:18.000]  Donald Trump gave her a TV show.
[46:18.000 --> 46:19.000]  Donald Trump, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.000]  She loved Donald Trump.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  She never said any of this to us.
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  And they go, oh, really?
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  And they go check their emails because the families are giving him.
[46:26.000 --> 46:27.000]  Here's my sister's email.
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.000]  Check it.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  And they check, oh, a year ago, you were loving Donald Trump.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  Six months ago, you were loving Donald Trump.
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.000]  Two months ago, you were loving Donald Trump.
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  Mr. Trump, you're so honest and wonderful.
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.000]  Thank you so much.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  You already helped my business so much on The Apprentice Show.
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  Do you mind when you're in California next coming back by it?
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  Sorry.
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  We're real busy.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  We can't come by.
[46:44.000 --> 46:45.000]  Oh, really?
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  Oh, you grabbed me then.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  They will not tell you because they're in a war.
[46:51.000 --> 46:56.000]  I have a clip of Cuomo, this storied family out of New York.
[46:56.000 --> 47:04.000]  I mean, give me a, you know, Mr. Carlioni on CNN saying it's illegal for you to look
[47:04.000 --> 47:05.000]  at WikiLeaks.
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.000]  You must go through us.
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.000]  You're only allowed to look at it if we say so.
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  I mean, they talk to their viewers like they're three.
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  Now you're not allowed to go outside without mommy letting you.
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.000]  Is that clear?
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.000]  Or I'll get a wooden spoon out, dumbass.
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.000]  This is the total delusion of these people.
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  They're just holding on, folks, by their toenails.
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.000]  Chris Cuomo, we at CNN can post those WikiLeaks emails, but you can't.
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  We have the video clip.
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  Look at that little power tripping nobody.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  What's his father say?
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.000]  If you don't support abortion or banning guns, get out of New York.
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  And they said, you mean they said, I said, get out.
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  Just total thug, just total, you know, Adolf Hitler level.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  Just get out of here.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  We rule everything.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  Now all full of the hutzpah.
[47:57.000 --> 47:58.000]  Come on, everybody.
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  Just like, let's hit Russia.
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.000]  Give a bloody-nosed body bag of all these weird with it and fancy $5,000 dress on TV.
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.000]  Some anti-power stuff.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  I'll look at power tripping.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  I mean, those people shouldn't be McDonald's managers on the power trips they're on.
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  We're going to hit Russia and we spent $5 million over there.
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  We got the weapons and their other eyes look all crazy.
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  It's like, what the hell?
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  The Russians look all concerned.
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  We're moving into our bunkers.
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  Have our missiles ready.
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.000]  Please, America, wake up.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  Crazy people, run your country.
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  Please stop.
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  They're like, oh, shut up.
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.000]  We're going to get you.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  It's the women's chance to be in charge, hopping around like witches.
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.000]  And it's just like, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.000]  Let's go to the General Dumford clip because I mentioned it where if you watch the whole hour-long
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  change, they're like, go ahead and hit the Russians.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  They're like, well, that'll be a declaration of war.
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  They're going to fight back.
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  Here it is.
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  We're Syria.
[48:52.000 --> 48:58.000]  What about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped?
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  All the options.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  What do you think of that option, sir?
[49:02.000 --> 49:08.000]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.000]  go to war against Syria and Russia.
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.000]  That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  And we can keep playing the clips if you'd like.
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  We've got a top story up on infowars.com.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  Again, with the Russian government saying, prepare for nuclear war.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  It's the greatest danger ever.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  Get ready.
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.000]  We have our special report breaking all that down on infowars.com right now.
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  But instead, we've got Gloria Alred with a string of women like she always does running around
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  protecting them from another rich guy.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  Well, don't worry.
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  America won't be too rich much longer.
[49:43.000 --> 49:50.000]  But just like a third world country and you can, I guess, go out and beg for burgers on
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  the street corner because that's where this country is going.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  Now, when we come back, I've got to start getting to these clips.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  These are epic clips.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  Trump says corporate media, Clinton's most powerful weapon.
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  The media then laughs and says they're not biased.
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  It's insane.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  Then where does Trump get his talking points from?
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.000]  Often, the alt-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the guy that said Hillary's server
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  was hacked first years ago.
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  Tim Kaine blast Donald Trump's rigged election claim as scare tactics as they say Trump's
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  trying to rig it.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  Trump, you're trying to rig the election with the Russians.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  Election fraud doesn't exist, though.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  If he says we're going to do it, he's insane.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  That's like saying you're an effing white male and you're a white male.
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  I mean, we go on the street nationwide and white men come up to our reporters who are
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  some of them and scream, you have no credibility.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  You can't talk.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  You're an effing white male.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  And we say, but then how do you have credibility?
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  You're an effing white male.
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  And they just scream back.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  You're an effing white male.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  Then Newt Gennrich's most powerful video ever from Gennrich.
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  I mean, I got to say, I don't like Gennrich's person.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  I don't trust him.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  But what he says is total truth.
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  That's coming up.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  Chuck Todd interviews Mike Pence.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  It's all coming up.

[53:44.000 --> 53:59.000]  Advertising your business with GCN is simple, effective, and more affordable than you might think.
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  For the renegades, it is Atomic Age.
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  It's Atomic Age for renegades.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  Renegades for renegades.
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.000]  Renegades for renegades.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  It's Atomic Age for renegades.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  Renegades for renegades.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  This is a brilliant story.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  Gages and a diesel-flate should increase.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  Monday through Friday from 11am,
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  3pm central, we're here.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  Renegade and the renegades came.
[54:43.000 --> 54:50.840]  Coming up tomorrow and Wednesday, we're going to release damning evidence of Clinton crimes in Haiti.
[54:52.280 --> 54:57.080]  So, investigative reporters, our reporters have traveled to Haiti. I wasn't going to start releasing
[54:57.080 --> 55:02.520]  it today, but I really want to release it with a full push, with articles, with backup information,
[55:02.520 --> 55:09.560]  with the history, because it's so shocking. I don't even know what to say. I mean, when you see
[55:09.560 --> 55:17.240]  it for yourself and how much they hate them, how do I find words sensational enough to describe what
[55:17.240 --> 55:33.560]  it is? Breaking. Clinton crimes in Haiti to be released Wednesday, or evidence of Clinton
[55:33.560 --> 55:40.840]  carnage in Haiti to be released Wednesday. I mean, I don't know. A special report that Haitians
[55:40.840 --> 55:44.680]  absolutely hate the Clintons. The Clintons are enemy number one. I mean, there's so many stories
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.080]  to this. You've got the UN there refusing to give aid to the people. We have the video.
[55:52.360 --> 55:55.880]  You're not going to see Vice Magazine down there doing it, though. They're owned by HBO now. They're
[55:55.880 --> 55:59.400]  part of the team. You're not going to see anybody doing it. They're just going to sit around and say
[55:59.400 --> 56:06.680]  they're liberals and drive Subaru's. I'm not against the fact you drive a Subaru, but
[56:07.880 --> 56:11.320]  Portlandia is not a real way of life. It's a delusion.
[56:13.080 --> 56:17.000]  And we've got a bunch of Portlandians, like out of the movie, out of the TV show,
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.400]  starting World War Three. You people are crazy.
[56:22.440 --> 56:27.320]  And now you want to shut down the free press. You want to play Stormtrooper
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.320]  all because you've weakened the country and created such a
[56:32.200 --> 56:35.800]  massive domesticated people. I don't want to call men feminized.
[56:35.800 --> 56:42.040]  These women aren't inherently weak or stupid. It's it's it's it's spoiled rotten cults disconnected
[56:42.040 --> 56:51.240]  from reality is what we're dealing with. 41% of voters nationwide say election could be stolen
[56:51.240 --> 56:56.280]  from Trump. It's almost 80% when they only ask Republicans. Well, of course it could be stolen.
[56:56.280 --> 57:00.920]  Everybody knows about election fraud and all the battles and all the rigging. I mean, who who
[57:00.920 --> 57:04.840]  who doubts? We have all the WikiLeaks, the rigging of the election against Bernie Sanders.
[57:04.840 --> 57:12.280]  It's all confirmed, but they sit there laughing on CNN and NPR to make you feel alone. You're not
[57:12.280 --> 57:18.280]  alone. And they're talking about the danger. Hillary Clinton has put out new videos and
[57:18.280 --> 57:22.840]  is going to spend $20 million attacking Alex Jones and the fact that Trump likes him.
[57:22.840 --> 57:29.960]  But let's go to that clip first as we go out to break because they want Trump to run
[57:31.160 --> 57:35.560]  from what's made him so successful. He's not doing that again. He saw how he was nice to her
[57:35.560 --> 57:40.200]  and got destroyed in the first debate. He went after her and was it was like Valhalla.
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.320]  So let's go out to break with where does Trump get his talking points from? This is the new
[57:45.320 --> 57:53.880]  official Hillary Clinton ad. I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[57:53.880 --> 58:02.120]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot. Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake,
[58:02.120 --> 58:08.280]  with actors, in my view, manufactured. I will not let you down. The official stories of Fable
[58:08.280 --> 58:14.040]  and the inside job is the only explanation. You will be very, very impressed, I hope. They're
[58:14.040 --> 58:19.400]  the ones running ISIS. I mean, I've interviewed the cops and the people that saw the feds planting
[58:19.400 --> 58:22.920]  the bombs in Oklahoma City. I think we'll be speaking a lot. I think she's going to show up
[58:23.720 --> 58:27.320]  and all the flaws right there. We're going to come back as I went to this late. We're going to
[58:27.320 --> 58:31.560]  play the whole thing when we come back. But again, all of it out of context, all of it misrepresented
[58:31.560 --> 58:35.640]  and all of it to project it onto him. We don't need the outro. It's fine. I mean,
[58:35.640 --> 58:39.240]  this is the reality of what we're dealing with. This is what we're facing in this culture. This
[58:39.240 --> 58:48.120]  is all they've got. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com

[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:54.360]  All right. So, Desperate Hillary has already tried for a year to make a big deal out of the
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.800]  fact that Donald Trump talks about global government, that Donald Trump talks about
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.680]  the fact that there's a New World Order, that Donald Trump talks about the fact that in her
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.920]  email, she's working for foreign megabanks to sign over our sovereignty to all these different
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:10.120]  multinational corporate institutions like TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the XM Bank,
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.200]  the World Trade Organization, on and on and on. I mean, they can't have their cake and eat at two
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.960]  and have thousands of news articles calling for world government and pushing it and saying,
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.640]  don't we all just work for central banks on CNBC and five guests say, yes, we work for central
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.760]  banks. They control the world now. We're not in a democracy or a republic. We're run by multinational
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:38.600]  banks. CNBC, the host and five guests all agree on show after show. Trump comes out,
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.200]  points out we're giving up our sovereignty. Our borders have been dissolved outside of law.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.560]  Of course, I'm saying the same thing. Of course, Nigel Farage is saying the same thing. And yes,
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.440]  Trump is awake to this and has learned a lot the last 10 years. He was always against an
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:58.600]  afternoon gap 25 years ago before I was on the air. But I'm not saying that. So, oh, I'll defend
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.960]  Trump because, oh, God, they're connecting me to them. They create much to do about nothing
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.520]  to create the illusion that talking about the new world order is bad. On Friday, remember they said,
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:16.280]  it's anti-Semitic to talk about foreign cabals. They inject the race issue to try to get us off
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:21.240]  this subject, not because it's discrediting. But if we start talking about how we're run by foreign
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.800]  megamax, if we start talking about how we're run by these foreign institutions and how we've lost
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:33.640]  sovereignty, it's game over for them. I love how they take Howard Stern interviews he's done where
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:40.040]  he gets asked racing questions and act like new Howard Stern discovered, new where he got asked about,
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:46.360]  you know, threesomes 15 years ago. Oh my gosh, he's done for now. We just discovered new Alex
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:52.760]  Jones interviews. Why they were hidden like, oh, investigative report, all this fanfare as they
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.480]  ignore all the WikiLeaks, all the criminality, all the real news, all the horrible things, the fact
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.600]  there's new stuff about her health being bad in the WikiLeaks. Of course it is. And Podesta trying
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:11.080]  to cover it up, of course. Let's go to the new national ad, Hillary's Hope. She's sending out
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:18.600]  to all her constituents. It's online. It's airing on TV. Here it is. I will not let you down. You'll
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:28.360]  be very, very impressed, I hope. And I think we'll be speaking a lot. Sandy Hook is a synthetic,
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:35.560]  completely fake, with actors in my view, manufactured. I will not let you down. The official stories
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:41.880]  of Fable and the inside job is the only explanation. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope. They're the
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:47.240]  ones running ISIS. I mean, I've interviewed the cops and the people that saw the feds plant the
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:53.080]  bombs on Oklahoma City. I think we'll be speaking a lot. I think she's gonna show up and on drugs,
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.360]  though. She's gonna be blacked out. I will not let you down. She's a freaking demon and she stinks.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.200]  And so does Obama. I go like, what, sulfur? Now I have the government documents where they said
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.200]  they're going to encourage homosexuality with chemicals so that people don't have children.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:10.280]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water. They turn the freaking frogs gay.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:19.480]  And I'll tell you, it is surreal. I love it. To talk about issues here on air and then word for
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:29.720]  word here from say it two days later. It is amazing. It is amazing. Yeah. I should be happier
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.800]  about that. But it is just such an amazing time to be alive. I have too much energy right now.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:38.440]  I've been working seven days a week. I've cut back my caffeine intake like almost to nothing.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:43.800]  And I'm bouncing off the walls because this is so epic. Let me calm down a little bit
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:49.080]  and come back and give you the good news. And I mean, let me tell you, it's some really good news.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:55.000]  Amazing time to be alive. But I got to tell you, I'm very frustrated right now because the Haiti
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.040]  stuff we got so powerful that I don't even know how to do it justice. I mean, this is over the top.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.840]  As reported by Breitbart, Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report has warned
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.080]  presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton that he is about to drop a bombshell about her,
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:14.200]  quote, sex stuff. In a tweet, Drudge said, Oh, on the sex stuff, Hillary is about to get hers.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.360]  He then tweeted a picture of Hillary on the Ellen DeGeneres show her first appearance
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.600]  since the last debate with Donald Trump. Now, we know that there have been decades of speculation
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.920]  about Clinton's sexuality and those close to her camp have reported that Hillary has a trove
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.640]  of secrets herself. The issue of sexual behavior has emerged in the current election cycle as the
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.520]  Clinton camp has found supposed victims of sexual harassment by Trump and then paraded them in front
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:41.720]  of a voracious media. We know that several foreign papers as well as the London Times have accused
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:46.600]  Clinton of having an affair with her aide, Huma Abedin, even nine years ago. Now, the Clinton camp
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:51.400]  responded to these reports saying that they were, quote, ridiculous and not to be taken seriously.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:56.680]  It merely tabloid trash and nothing to see here. They may change their stance with Drudge's bombshell.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:03.480]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for info wars.com. Please listen carefully because I'm about to

[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:12.840]  come to America. Something's wrong and we all know it. I'm Charity Daniels and I'm here to tell
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:19.400]  you about it. The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:25.640]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:33.960]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:40.040]  government. We're the solution. Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that. Starring Alex Jones,
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:46.360]  Charlie Daniels and special ops general, Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:53.880]  now available. Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Revelation, the movie.info.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:00.280]  Americans need to see this film. Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:10.360]  It's Monday, October 17, 2016. We are now 21 days out from the election.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:16.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting worldwide from Austin, Texas.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.680]  All right, Gary Byrne, former Secret Service agents to be our guests at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.560]  Then I'm going to get into all these clips of Donald Trump coming out and basically destroying
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.360]  the mainstream media, calling them on what they're doing and getting into the fact that
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:45.560]  there is a conspiracy against the American people. By 20 media executives, Zuckerberg admits it,
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:51.640]  the head of Google all admits it, Bezos admits it, the Washington Post, that they want to deliver
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:59.480]  this to Hillary. And there she is getting all of these endless corporate donations at levels
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:05.880]  we've never before seen and Trump gets zero. Then Trump raises $170 million.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:15.000]  Think about that. $170 million. And they're supposed to give him half of it for ads.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.400]  Zero Republican money for him because the same establishment we all claim we're against wants
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.360]  to keep him out because they've got this country under their control. Hillary Clinton is out raising
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:33.720]  Trump 20 to 1 among billionaires. Oh, but she's the anti-establishment candidate who's against
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:38.600]  TPP that Trump spent against for a decade. Turns out she helped write a bunch of it in the emails
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.040]  and all the new WikiLeaks are coming out. So here's the good news. Even if they steal this election
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:50.920]  and Trump still, a lot of Algorand States is ahead, but it is close. This whole corrupt system
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:57.480]  of crony capitalism is coming down. And our Republic is being restored. It took him 25 years
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.400]  to get out of the Euro in England. That's still ongoing. We're going to get out of this whole
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:09.960]  global system a lot quicker. There it is, RNC TV ads spending for Trump. Zero. And he's raised them
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.640]  record money. He's brought record numbers into the Republican Party. Four million more people in
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:20.440]  the Republican Party than it's ever been. But see, they're all bought and paid for by the same lobbyist.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:26.760]  It's an amazing time. But the good news is the facade has fallen. The metrics, the online numbers
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:33.560]  show it. Even Google admits 2,500 times more interest in WikiLeaks than all of the Trump
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.680]  scandals. I noticed we covered that and broke that last week and Fox and friends on Saturday morning
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:49.000]  had it up there with Juan Williams attacking Trump. Simply amazing. Gary Byrne, crisisofcharacterbook.com.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.760]  He's a veteran Secret Service officer in the Clinton Winehouse, served in federal law enforcement
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:59.560]  for nearly 30 years in the U.S. Air Force, Security Police and Uniform Division, the Secret Service,
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:05.560]  and most recently as a federal air marshal. While serving as a Secret Service officer,
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.800]  Gary protected President Bill Clinton and First Lady and the First Family in the
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:15.480]  Winehouse and his book is Crisis of Character and it ties in with other Secret Service agents
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:21.160]  that have gone public. Bongino's not gone public, but they've broken his house and threatened his
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.320]  family and his car and he calls me up and says, listen, I know you're not saying I'm your source
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.560]  of this stuff, but God, can I come on and tell people I'm not just so they stop. No, we had Secret
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:33.080]  Service on the ground tell us he's fallen down. She's got a special ambulance vehicle. It's got
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.520]  lift gates. We're not telling you anything secret. Just watch what's going on. We said, well,
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.120]  what does she have? We're not going to tell you. Just start watching. She's fallen down all the time.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.120]  That's why they get her on medication. She disappears for a week. She can come back out
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.760]  for a few hours, but they're rolling the dice, having her up here Wednesday. And that's why
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:54.680]  they're saying that Axl Rod wants her to drop out now because he destroyed her last time. So,
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.360]  so much is happening, but just Gary, we've gone over your story. People should read the book to get
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.360]  it. Winehouse Secret Service officer discloses his first-hand experience with Hillary Bill and
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.800]  how they operate. But Bongino just said this. Of course, he was the head of their foreign detail,
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:11.080]  very senior. He said, it's, quote, worse than you know. And we know they stole the plates. We
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:15.160]  know they stole George Washington's, you know, silverware. We know that they've done all these.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.600]  It's all in the WikiLeaks now. I mean, now that more and more of the WikiLeaks have come out,
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.040]  you've never really given up the secrets. You've just talked about what type of person she was,
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:28.520]  but now it's admitted throwing fits constantly, treating people horribly, being very unstable.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:33.720]  Like General Flynn has said that she's known to be very unstable. For you as an insider, and by
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.280]  insider, somebody that's, you know, been a fly on the wall. We know that I'm about to make a joke,
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.520]  but a fly on the wall. Just what is it like as a citizen to be watching all this?
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.400]  First of all, thank you, Alex. It's great to be with you again.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.840]  Thank you, sir. And from my perspective, it was almost comical. And what I mean by that is,
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:58.120]  I mean, it was demoralizing to the people that she was berate. And, but like, for instance,
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.840]  we talked about before when she berated me, it didn't really bother me because, you know,
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:08.120]  consider the source, Alex. I didn't take her seriously. She's watching her in it with her
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:12.440]  dictator type attitude and walking around the West Wing and the White House berating people.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:17.240]  Who could take her seriously? It was a joke. And the ideal that she has the gravitas to
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:21.960]  be President of the United States, clearly, in my opinion, what I witnessed in those eight years
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:27.240]  that I protected her, she wasn't a very good first lady. She was a complete failure as Secretary
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:33.880]  of State. And as far as her eight years in the Senate, what did she do there? So the Hillary
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:39.000]  Clinton that I know that I wrote about in my book, Crisis of Character is completely incompetent.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.920]  And you know, the truth is, if people pay attention, they've also heard that from the
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.320]  director of the FBI. He either told us that she was completely incompetent or she was just too
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.840]  stupid to understand the security measures that we're supposed to be. Well, it looks like extreme
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.080]  recklessness because to lie to Congress, after she knew it had been hacked, if she knew she deleted
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.720]  the emails, she's all been caught in lies now. That's what Hillary said she should be indicted.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:07.320]  The problem is, I guess Loretta Lynch won't let that happen. Right. I see the same thing you do.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.800]  And the other thing too is, and I know your listeners are smart and I know you are too,
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.440]  but I just want to repeat again, everything that you hear come out of their mouth,
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:21.880]  especially her mouth, is if it's not a lie, well, it's a lie, first of all. And two,
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.840]  it's something that has to do with polling. Nobody knows how this woman really feels about
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.400]  anything because everything is poll-driven. I mean, we see that with this negative attitude
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:37.080]  towards law enforcement because polls show them in certain demographics, in certain cities,
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:42.040]  that plays well. That's all it is. You're saying from your criminology background,
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.320]  Gary Cripp, if I'm wrong, profiling her, Trump operates clearly off what he thinks is right
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.480]  and ignores the polls. That way you actually change society, you lead and get folks that are
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.760]  dumbed down and want to shoot cops in the back of the head to actually wake up and realize that's
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.320]  wrong. That's not how you reform things. But with her, if the polls show with her demographic,
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.640]  saying cops are the devil is a great thing. She's going to go with it because is she a sociopath?
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.880]  Is she a psychopath? I mean, that sounds like the MO of somebody that doesn't have a personality.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.360]  Yeah. She definitely, I mean, I'm not a psychologist as you know, a doctor.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.720]  Yeah. The cops are smart. You were caught before you in a secret service. I mean,
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.480]  Secret Service is all about psychology. If you were profiling Hillary, give us a Secret Service
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:27.640]  profile. Yeah. My expertise is an observation and my observing her, there's clearly something
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:32.280]  wrong with it. You just do not act like she does towards people. I mean, I've told you the stories
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.280]  about her telling a uniform division officer after he said good morning to her to go left
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.840]  himself. And I've also chosen the story about it, which is in my book, Crisis of Character,
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.320]  where she gets so angry, she hits a Secret Service agent in the back of the head of the Bible.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:51.000]  Alex, you can't explain that away other than just bone crazy. I mean, and she thought she could get
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.080]  away with it because Alex, she's gotten away with it her whole life. Well, I had, I had Bill
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.400]  Clinton's long-term girlfriend on record, Dolly Collin here. They were on record going to school
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:03.160]  together on record dating. I mean, it's, it's on, they've been on TV together back when he was
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:09.720]  running for office, even before Hillary was around. And she said that Hillary flips out around cops
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:16.200]  and authority and literally sees the military as the enemy. And that's what she saw back when
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:24.360]  Hillary was young. Yeah. And that's exactly what I saw. And it goes, and that goes exactly to what
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.640]  one of the reasons I wrote my book and the message I'm trying to get at Alex is, is that the Hillary
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.960]  Clinton and the Bill Clinton that we heard about in the early nineties of all the crazy stuff in
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.200]  Arkansas. And you know it as well as I do. And in some cases, even better, all the stories about
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.840]  the women and their relationship with each other and the state police, the statements of how they
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:47.800]  fought so badly and how crazy it was. And the Clinton machine tried to pass it off as, oh,
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.160]  that's just Arkansas Republican politics. They, they brought that same show to Washington, D.C.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:58.040]  and I stood there with many other people and watched it firsthand. That is the real Clintons.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.280]  That's the real Hillary Clinton. Now, I know you've got to be careful because you swear in oath,
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.400]  but also to the country and constitution, but the Secret Service, I'm supposed to talk about
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.560]  inside baseball. You've told as much as you can in the book. It's a page turner. It's important for
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:14.920]  every Democrat to read and really think about what they're doing. But other tidbits you've never
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.120]  revealed. I know it's all been vetted so you can legally and lawfully do this. But I mean,
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:21.720]  to have somebody like Bongino, who's a tough guy, former New York cop, head of the detail,
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.800]  house getting broken into cars, threats, you name it, you know, getting to him for even speaking
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.320]  out against him, not telling any secrets. You've told a lot more secrets than that.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.600]  What is it about her that makes people be so concerned?
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:38.680]  Well, it's the fact that anybody that's been around her, like myself, like Dan,
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.520]  anybody in the Secret Service, her staff, the people that are really terrified of her are people
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:49.480]  that work for her because they know the real Hillary Clinton, the one that I described to you,
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.680]  not this fictitious thing you see from the mainstream media. The real Hillary Clinton is cold,
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:18:00.600]  distant. She's a dictator. She literally wants to follow no rules, but she wants to invoke all
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.560]  these large government policies that have nothing but pages and pages of rules and regulations
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:12.440]  for the rest of us. So the reason I think people that, I mean, basically, I kind of get the
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:17.720]  impression you're trying to ask me if I'm afraid of her. No, I'm not. And I know, I know, I mean,
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.720]  I can't speak for Dan. But I don't think you're afraid of her. And I mean, neither is he. It's
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:26.920]  just that what I'm saying is you've gone further than anybody else is what I'm getting at. Other
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:33.160]  people are afraid of her. So they're afraid of her because they've seen firsthand, either they've
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:38.360]  seen it or the rumors convinced them that if they do something wrong, if they step out,
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:43.560]  something will happen to them. Now, you know, there was this young man that supposedly set up
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:48.120]  one of her servers and had something to do with the State Department servers. And then supposedly,
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:52.440]  he's been murdered in a, in a supposed robbery in Washington DC.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.280]  Like shot four times in the back. Right. Now, I don't know exactly what happened,
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.680]  but I will tell you this, that's what scares people. Now, if that's just coincidental,
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:04.920]  that certainly helps them. And if it's not, again, I hope it's being investigated.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.840]  But those are the kind of things, the stories out that have been around forever about them.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.640]  And it's not that I ignore them, but you know, I've been protecting people for a long time.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:18.520]  I'm protecting myself and my family as I see fit. And as you well know, we've talked about before,
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.440]  I'm a big fan of the Second Amendment. So, absolutely. Well, look, what is it like then
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.680]  for you to see every day thousands of new emails coming out confirming everything we knew,
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.720]  everything we've talked about? But it's even worse than I thought where they go,
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.960]  we got to keep them dumb. We got to keep them in the dark. We got to keep them complacent.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:37.960]  Hey, this is, I mean, just yesterday, this is illegal to take this money from foreign government.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:43.880]  Doesn't matter. Take the money and then ha, ha, ha. I mean, it's like the classic, like he's the
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:49.880]  Joker or something where it's the classic, like they know their criminals. Yeah. That's the Hillary
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:54.360]  Clinton that I described in my book, as you know. And here's another thing too, that I wanted to
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:59.480]  mention to you. You're talking about the emails that were leaked out by WikiLeaks in the emails
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.200]  where her staff is talking back and forth and they're saying disparaging things about certain
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:09.480]  groups of Americans. They're, you know, they're slamming Catholics, which I'm a very proud Catholic.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:14.920]  They're slamming Latinos. They're talking about African American groups. And they're talking
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:20.680]  about them in a disparaging way. That's the real Clintons. The only reason they tried to,
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:26.040]  they pander to those people just for votes. They can't, she especially, Mrs. Clinton,
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:31.160]  I've seen it firsthand. And as you know, I talk about in the book, she really seems to despise
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.480]  everybody. You talked about her despising the military. It's unbelievable the way she's treated
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:42.200]  the military and law enforcement that I described in my book. I mean, Alps, you wouldn't treat anybody
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.440]  that you, you didn't like it. You know what I mean? Like I don't, she goes out of her way to be mean.
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.440]  I've talked to two different groups of predictive details whenever she was secretary of state.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:56.760]  And when she would visit Iraq in places and they told similar stories about her and just that it
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:01.560]  was like she would go out of her way to just have huge tirades and screaming yell and call
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.360]  everyone dumbasses and cuss. And they'd bring a German shepherd into the green zone area to check
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.400]  her quarters. And she'd go, get that effing dog out of here. Just get me your commander and just
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:18.120]  flip out. And they were just like, what the hell? Yes. Yes. Now, you know, I could tell you that I
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:22.760]  wasn't there for those instances, but those are the same things that I witnessed at the White House.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:28.440]  This is, this is the real Hillary Clinton. And the only reason that she's even, I mean, she,
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:32.680]  let's face it, she's close, pretty close to becoming president. I mean, I do think Mr.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.440]  Trump will win. And God knows I'm doing everything I can to make sure he wins
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:43.560]  with getting my message out. But the real Hillary Clinton, they can't run on her own record because
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:51.480]  she, her record is horrendous. And they can't run on anything she's done. Because most of what she's
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:58.920]  done is a disaster. I mean, how the hell do, do eight, do a handful of men and women end up defending
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:12.040]  themselves in Benghazi, Libya? Gary, Jay, former Gary, Gary and small arms. When Alex, we have
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:16.760]  hundreds of millions of dollars of men and women and equipment standing around the country.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:21.320]  Yeah, sorry to rub your Skype really degraded. Let's just wait a moment. I think it's going to
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.560]  reconnect. Repeat what you just said. You got cut off. When you got to, we got a handful of men
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:31.800]  defending themselves at Benghazi. And then I want to go back to what you said, because one of their
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:37.400]  chefs came out and said that they were racist. He's found dead on a hike. The other chef has now
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:42.760]  gone on record. We should play that clip, you know, saying the N word constantly. I know people
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.680]  that work for the Clintons, they said, look, we thought they were probably in the KKK or something,
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:51.400]  especially Hillary, as much as she, you know, just inward this inward that stuff. I've never even heard,
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:56.280]  you know, being around other white people, literally. And all this craziness, loving Robert
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:00.680]  Byrd, the, you know, the grand dragon and all this other garbage. But then you were getting to the
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:07.720]  fact of just disparaging Latinos, you name it. It's just an incredible, they're very elitist is what
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:12.440]  I'm, what I'm getting at here. So can you finish up with Benghazi now that your Skype's back,
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:17.160]  sir? Again, former service agent in the White House joining us, the new book, prices of character,
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:23.800]  and then get into more of an elaboration on that. Sure. So what I was saying in Benghazi was,
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:29.960]  you know, how is it possible that those men and women fought for 13 hours with 100, 200,000
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:35.320]  dollars with the small arms? When we had hundreds of millions of dollars of men and women around
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:41.720]  the world with equipment, ready to rescue them. That's what the military does. And nobody sent
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:45.240]  a message. I was, you can't explain that away. And I don't care what anybody says.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.960]  It's never been, they've gone on record. They got the stand down more than 10 times.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:54.040]  Yeah. And it is horrendous. And how do you explain that? And, you know, at the time that
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:58.680]  that happened, I was still working federal air marshal. And just like my coworkers,
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:05.320]  they're flying all over the world, protecting Americans in aviation. And, you know, we came
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.760]  to the conclusion, you know, when that happened, we've said to ourselves, what if one of us got
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:22.120]  taken hostage somewhere in England, in France? And some of our things have happened. It hasn't
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.600]  happened to us yet, but it is definitely possible. Would they come for us? And our conclusion was,
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:32.520]  no, they wouldn't. That's right. And then the billions we now learn of illegal money to Iran
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:36.680]  for kidnapping the sailors that weren't even in their waters, that totally sets the
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:42.360]  precedence to start kidnapping more Americans. Yes. Yes. And that wears me, wears me about
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:47.160]  our military. And, you know, I would like to go back to the days when, you know,
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:52.440]  our Navy needs to be in those waters because they're doing, they're carrying out the policies
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.920]  of the United States. So our commander and chiefs need them to send them the message.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:02.280]  If you come in the harm's way, if they come at you, if they're firing past you, if they're
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.200]  flying by you, you need to do what the right thing is. And the right thing is you defend
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.360]  yourself. This is what America would always do. I mean, you little gunboats come up to
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.080]  destroyers and start opening fire, kill them. I mean, open up those, those, you know, those
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:20.120]  big mini guns immediately. Yes. Yeah. I'm not looking for anybody to start an unnecessary war,
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.840]  but you have to allow us. Sure. Not standing up for yourself is as bad as being a peacenik.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:28.920]  If you're, if you roll over and start the war, if you're too violent, it stops the war,
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:33.560]  but just letting Iran piss on our sailors for no reason. When we've been bending over back
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:38.920]  and trying to defend ourselves, that's exactly right. Now, let's get back to the race issue
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.320]  because you get into it in the book and people I know that know the Clintons, I mean, look at
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.280]  all the things they've done to the black community calling black super predators,
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:49.720]  they've got to be brought to heel on video, passing minimum sentence laws that you can
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:54.680]  say are truly racist. How do they get away with it and tell us for folks that can't afford the
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:26:04.040]  book or won't read it with 21 days out? The type of racial stuff you saw or witnessed her?
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:09.960]  Yeah. The stuff that I saw, the stuff that I saw out was, you know, the way she berated
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:22.680]  individual officers regardless of their race. This is so frustrating with the sky.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:26.200]  You know, you were talking. Yeah, yeah. Start over. I'll just put it back on the phone so this
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.600]  is clear, but we'll edit this so it's clear tonight. Put it on the news. Start back over with
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:35.560]  what you saw that was race based. What was in the paper? Sure. Yeah. Start over, sir. Go ahead.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:42.360]  Yeah. So basically what I saw was she berated everybody regardless of race, especially if
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:47.560]  they were in uniform. But when you go back to the emails that were leaked out and what they're
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:53.160]  discussing, that is the real Clinton machine, the real Hillary Clinton. They are clearly
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:58.440]  manipulating everybody for votes. And the one thing your viewers and listeners need to understand,
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.160]  you know, the best indictment of Hillary Clinton was actually stated by Barack Obama.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.360]  I remember when Obama talked about what a horrible person she was. We should get those clips.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.720]  Start over. Go ahead. Hillary Clinton will say anything and do nothing.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.240]  So, so basically he, you know,
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:27.400]  he said that she would, she would say anything and do nothing. And he's exactly right.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.040]  That is the real Clinton. That is the real Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.680]  So from your research, you obviously weren't in the Obama White House, but I've talked to
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.760]  Secret Service that have been in both. They say clearly Obama does treat people a lot better than
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:47.080]  Hillary. Yes. Yeah. They even, both President Obama and Mrs. Obama. And as far as I know,
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:53.400]  they're, they're children from the people that I've talked to, you know, when I first got in
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:59.400]  and probably about four years ago, yeah, they're fine. They're not, they're not abusive. I'm sure
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.840]  there may be some issues here and there, but they're nothing like the Clintons were.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:10.280]  How about Bill? I mean, if Hillary said nine of being rude and mean and crazy and aggressive,
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:16.440]  how was Bill? He's actually the exact opposite. He's nice. He's kind. He's jovial. He was friendly
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:21.560]  to work around. Don't get me wrong. I'm not, I'm not a fan. I mean, I wouldn't trust him to drive
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:27.000]  my 27 year old niece home, but I mean, he was pleasant to be around. Sure. And that's what I
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.640]  get from everybody. It's that Hillary, the psychological experts and others say to me is
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.520]  obviously unstable and she's getting worse as she is older. She's, she's degenerating and people
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.440]  are actually, the Russians have said openly, they've analyzed her personality and they're really
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:45.560]  scared of her. What people say, good, you want, no, no, not, not scared like pissing in the corner,
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.680]  like scared, like they're mobilizing for war. Yeah. The, the, the Hillary Clinton I observed
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:58.760]  even 15 years ago, 20 years ago, when I protected them to me seemed unstable. I mean, what is it
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.840]  could make you so mad? Alex, that you strike a secret service agent in the back of the head
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.400]  with a Bible. You know what I mean? Like that's the first sign right there. And as far as Bill
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:12.360]  Clinton's personality compared to Hillary Clinton's personality, that's why they're together because
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:18.360]  she's nothing but a power hungry, dysfunctional human being. And he's this very charming, very
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.880]  friendly, you know, I hate to say it, but he's a good politician. I mean, he can spin manure in
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.480]  the gold right in front of you, but she is not. She needed him. That's absolutely obvious.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.560]  Gary Byrne, crisis of character book.com, the new book crisis of character. Everybody should
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:39.240]  get it. Thank you for the time. Look forward to speaking to you again. Hopefully, when we've
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.560]  defeated Hillary Clinton. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. Knowing what you know about Hillary,
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:49.800]  you think she might try to sell the election? I think she's already tried. That's right. Thank
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:57.240]  you, sir. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.800]  We're read on election day. Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:10.120]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.760]  fraud from dead people voting to people registering false identifications to government leaders
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:18.920]  providing fast track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes. This is happening right in
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:23.320]  front of us. Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee,
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:27.560]  Donald Trump. Government chills are campaigning for Clinton. Mainstream news attacking Donald
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:32.440]  Trump all day like rabbit hounds, rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:36.440]  that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump. Fake
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:41.160]  celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms. So with all this, what are we doing to keep this
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:45.720]  election from being stolen? What can we do to prevent election fraud? I propose that all Donald
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:49.800]  Trump supporters wear red on election day. On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:54.600]  Donald Trump, be decked out in red. This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:59.400]  and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout. Wear red on election day and make
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:06.280]  America great again. There was a mighty nation blessed above all of creation. Charlie Daniels,
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.480]  he's always loved America. He's always defended the Second Amendment. Let me just read a little
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:16.120]  thing here from agenda 21. The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:21.160]  of the world. Individual rights will have to take the backseat to the collective. Well, you know
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:25.160]  what the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to be coming after your guns. Oh, yeah.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:30.280]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way. At all. It ain't gonna sit well. Do you ever wonder
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.960]  what happened to America? It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reveres. When I was a boy,
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:42.680]  it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie. And beef was for supper.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:49.320]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available,

[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:16.200]  of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity,
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:21.080]  diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.840]  people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.840]  with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and

[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:42.040]  Well, we just heard a former senior Secret Service agent, the guy that's had the most
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.280]  courage yet to put a book out exposing her bizarre, vicious behavior saying that she
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:53.160]  disparaged Hispanics. But to be fair, he said she disparaged everyone by name. White trash,
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:59.880]  filth, black filth, Mexican filth, just filth. Everybody's filth except her, of course. And
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:08.200]  what I've been told by the military about her from multiple sources all over the world
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:14.360]  is that she's crazy and that she would blow up and freak out, but also like a robot
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:24.040]  would just say, now everyone be quiet and then she would just go and like turn off
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:29.320]  like a robot for an hour and then go back to work, everyone. It's like she's a Manchurian
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:33.560]  candidate or something. And I'm not saying that literally, but when you have multiple people
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:42.600]  saying she doesn't act like a normal human and she smells like hell, I had Dolly Kyle in here,
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.440]  Bill Clinton's admitted girlfriend, and Mistress when she was married to Hillary,
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.600]  saying the thing about Hillary was she's stunk the worst you've ever smelled. I mean, I don't
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.160]  just say that so they can then have a national campaign. Hillary runs TV ads now saying I say
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:00.360]  she smells horrible. Well, that's what I was told. I just added the fact like in criminology,
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:07.640]  she doesn't bathe. She throws fit. This is the stuff you see with really screwed up people.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.480]  That's why you'll see her sometimes all dolled up with her hair done, but a lot of times,
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:17.320]  most of the time she looks like really disheveled and weird and dirty because she's a psychopath.
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:22.520]  And I was just talking to Secret Service Agent earlier about criminology
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:28.760]  and he was concurring that this is a very dangerous woman. What would I call that last
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:42.040]  segment we posted to YouTube? Secret Service Agent. Hillary has no soul. Secret Service Agent.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:50.360]  Hillary stands for nothing but herself. Secret Service Agent. Hillary Clinton despairs Latinos,
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:56.760]  but in fairness, hates everyone else, but identifies you by your group.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  Bitter clingers, all the Bernie people in their mother's basements, baristas, pieces of trash.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:12.200]  They've been disenfranchised by this economy and now they hate me and they've encouraged her to
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.600]  like the common people. Please like them. Oh gosh, everyone knows Hillary hates everyone.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:22.760]  What do we do? Joe Biden, I know a lot of you don't like Hillary here because she's a monster.
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.440]  She stole the nomination. Of course, I mean, I asked the Secret Service Agent at the end,
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:31.400]  will she try to steal the election? And what did he say? Smart guy goes, well, she already has.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:39.640]  She stole the nomination. Hillary has already stolen the election. That's a video I ought to put out.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:46.440]  Stanford Research, Stanford University, certify what we told you. 11 states that
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:54.760]  standards won. They have the exit polls where he's winning by 20, 30%. He loses by 5%, 10%.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:02.280]  Then they have the states where he wins. Of those 11, what was it? Seven of them, he won.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:07.960]  And then they go, oh, the supertelegates from New Hampshire to California have decided you don't
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:17.800]  get them. And then this godsend, this kamikaze patriot, Trump comes in and he'll get up and he'll
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:24.280]  say it. Last week, we have the new WikiLeaks emails from Podesta going, oh, I wish, you know,
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.000]  with the head of CNN, oh man, we really shouldn't have ever put his early speeches on. We thought
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.240]  it was discrediting. It gave him people that actually know what he's saying and they know
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:38.520]  that we're twisting it. So we really screwed up. Yeah, you really screwed up, didn't you?
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:45.320]  You were arrogant. In the same emails, you thought that Trump would be the better candidate to run
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:50.520]  against for Hillary. Oh, like the last two Republicans were all establishment and all had
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:56.600]  little milk toast backgrounds. And were they good? Were they Democrat-like? What the constituents
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:02.200]  were looking for? No, Trump's got more Republicans signed up to vote, four million of them than in
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:13.480]  history. Trump's been a huge, giant success. And they're trying to convince you he hasn't been
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:19.560]  taking everything he says out of context, like what we've run into. We have to do a video on this,
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.360]  all over the country, from Austin to California to you name it.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:27.560]  Cities around the nation, states all over. People come over and they go,
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:33.720]  you know what Donald Trump said? All Mexicans are rapists and criminals. Really? Where'd he say
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.880]  that? And we pulled the clip. Now, he said a lot of the illegals that are here are criminals and
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:43.480]  they're raping and murdering and stuff. That's a fact. And they just go, no, he hates all Mexicans.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:49.480]  That's all they've got. Now he's a sexual assaulter. Bill Clinton's sheddled sexual assault.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.560]  Now they've called thousands of women that they know were connected to Trump,
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:59.560]  that worked in his pageants or were on his TV shows. And they've gotten nine of them to say he
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:04.520]  kept holding my hand and asking me on an elevator. He put his hand on my leg on an airplane. And then
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:10.040]  we've got him two months ago, six months ago, a year ago, we've got six of them sending him emails.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:13.800]  And now they're getting phone records with them calling and their families are going,
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:17.160]  I don't know about my sister. I don't know about my niece or I don't know about my cousin. I don't
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:25.000]  know about my daughter. All she talked about was how she had the hots for Trump. Oh, yeah. See,
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:31.000]  your own families are exposing you. And a lot of them are admitting I'm the Democrat. I'm not even
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  for Trump, but my daughter was in love with him. My cousin loved him. You go check the records.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:47.080]  She's asking him to come a few months ago to a restaurant on his campaign. And he didn't come
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:52.920]  did he? So now she's going to get her attention one way or another. And she's got Gloria Allred
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:58.280]  running around behind her. And again, even if Trump had done some of this, then I'd be concerned.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:04.680]  But here's the thing. Hillary is 20 magnitudes worse. I mean, Hillary is the one of the biggest
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:08.200]  criminals in history. She's involved in every form of crime you can imagine. She's totally
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:13.000]  reckless, psychotic, turning jihadis loose that have killed 200,000 Christians and are cutting
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.400]  women's genitals off by the hundreds of thousands and putting five-year-old and six-year-old girls
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:23.320]  in sex slavery and training little boys as young as six years old how to saw people's heads off.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:28.040]  We've got the ISIS training videos in HD of them shooting people in the head and slitting people's
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:32.440]  throats. Six, seven-year-old kids. I mean, I'm not going to show it to you. You can go find it if you
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:40.520]  want to. And it's in the new emails from last week and Saturday, two data dumps, her talking about
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:47.880]  Saudi Arabia and their operation bringing in Al Qaeda and ISIS. I've got a bunch of clubs
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:50.600]  I've got to get to. This is the most important part of the broadcast right now. We're about to
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:55.640]  get to. I just want to let you know that this week we have the debate special. We're going to be

[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:12.520]  that's lucky for patriots. Unlucky for tyrants. That's a little secret of the 13. Got a number

[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:39.080]  it. I don't need it all the time, but I do take it more these days because there's so much happening
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.680]  and going on. It's hard to sleep when you're so excited. Last run ever for the Hillary for
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:48.040]  prison shirts, the final run, the final countdown right now. And of course your purchase supports
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:54.200]  what we're doing here. And I'm in the film. Charlie Daniels is in it. It is an expanded
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:43:01.320]  version, the second film that Chuck undersea has put out. It's so important to go to their website
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:06.680]  and find out where it's showing or through the computer programs that these sites have. You
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:10.680]  can just say where you'd like to see it enough people click it, then they'll have a showing
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:14.920]  there. They have like 20 people in the theater of 200 click it, it then will make it show in
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:20.120]  that town. So that's a way to wake people up. It's a great new film. Chuck undersea general
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:24.760]  Boykin, the founder of Delta force, Charlie Daniels, G Edward Griffin, Joel scowls and myself,
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:29.880]  Alex Jones, it covers a range of topics such as privacy as 21, the fellow reserve and much more.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:35.480]  And really wake people up, visit revelation, the movie dot info to purchase the dbd or check
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.840]  into hosting it at a theater near you. And if you want to just run out of theater and show it,
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:44.840]  that's what this is all about. Folks, expend your capital. Now that's your real voting power
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.760]  or lose everything. Chuck is a retired army colonel in his own right, a great patriot and he
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:55.240]  just has been working on this five years, try to battle the new world order. So this is a key
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:59.400]  part of the fight. When everybody gets involved in it, at least get the dvd and buy one for friends
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:06.280]  and family. It's available at revelation, the movie dot info, revelation, the movie dot info,
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.040]  or check out theaters in your area. And then finally, I'm getting all these clips.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:16.120]  Solutions from science is one of our oldest sponsors. They're always upgrading the latest
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:21.880]  solar panel and control unit technology. They have a wide spectrum of units and other survival
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.200]  products. Solutions from science is again, one of my oldest sponsors, you should check it out. This
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.560]  is their top the line model, their perfect power solar generator, the one I use at my home. I've
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:36.360]  actually got several of these. I've got one that's 10 years old still working. It's expandable,
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:41.000]  of course they've been updated. So you can make it as powerful as you want. Normally around $6,000,
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:47.720]  they're letting them go for 1500 as a lost leader. This is unprecedented. Visit powergridchaos.com.

[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.840]  you can watch the informational videos there on the site.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:03.160]  Let me go through these clips and then I'll give a little bit of commentary as we go.
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:08.120]  Again, they tell Trump, don't do this. Don't talk about rigging. It doesn't exist. But we
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.440]  got to federalize things to stop the rigging. Don't talk about the federal reserve being private
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.760]  or you're anti-semitical. They're the ones injecting all this race stuff and religion stuff
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:22.120]  because they're desperate, because they know Trump isn't just trying to get elected as an
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:27.400]  establishment person. He's trying to use this to change the whole paradigm, to be a revolutionary,
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:34.840]  to be a leader, not to do with the little political pundits like Carl Rove and, you know,
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:40.440]  Axelrod tell you how to do. Their internal memos admit they're in total panic. They're
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:45.720]  in total crisis, even if they steal it from Trump. It's a devastating exposure of the New World Order.
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:52.040]  WikiLeaks, look at all of it. We've only begun to fight. Everyone around the world understands
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:56.280]  the great evil. That's the Democratic Party and Republican establishment and humanity is on the
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:01.080]  march. The empire is on the run. So here's Trump in a latest statement. Corporate media,
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:08.680]  Clinton's most powerful weapon. Powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media,
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:16.520]  the press. Let's be clear on one thing.
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:25.880]  The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism.
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:35.080]  They're a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity,
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:41.960]  with a total political agenda. And the agenda is not for you, it's for themselves.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:46.760]  Now how'd the media spend this? They said Trump says there's a conspiracy against him.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:52.920]  No, he didn't. He said against us. Their agenda is to elect Crooked Hillary Clinton
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:47:00.040]  at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:10.040]  For them, it's a war. And for them, nothing at all is out of bounds.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:15.880]  That's right. And now six of the nine women struggle for the survival of our nation.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:23.400]  It is, folks. And this will be our last chance to save it on November 8th. Remember that.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:27.320]  Non-violently. He's absolutely right. I mean, they're going to put five Supreme Court justices in,
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:31.880]  they're going to shut down the free press. It's all in, folks. And I've never said cheat because
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.320]  I always want to have the moral high ground, but I've been controlling myself lately.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:39.640]  Because we know the Democrats are triple quadruple voting all over the country. Got
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:45.640]  their scum. They drive 55 and 70s. They park and take up all the room in a gas station.
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.920]  They piss on everyone. They are demons. They are demons.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:52.440]  I've been doing a study.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:58.600]  I talked about today, they are just, well, they have studies out that Democrats and liberals
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.680]  are six times more likely to rob and six times more likely to not give the charity, but they'll
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:11.400]  they'll moral signal, virtue signal and tell you something like 11 times more active, telling you
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:20.440]  to give. I mean, look at Hillary. She got $2 billion of stolen Haiti money that good people gave,
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:29.400]  but ran through that evil woman. And then she sits around and shakes her finger and says,
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:34.280]  we're all not paying enough. And Gary Haven, who I know is worth over a billion and a half dollars.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:40.600]  I looked it up. He's given something like $80 million to Haiti.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:46.520]  Built whole deals, put in water systems, flights every week. Now it's almost every day
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:50.280]  because he knows these people. They're dying in front of him and they and the government's
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:55.320]  completely corrupt. And then he tries to fly him in to the main city to get medical care.
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:49:01.720]  And the UN's there even trying to stop them. The footage we've got is, I'm in there watching it
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:06.120]  this morning and I'm like, I can't believe we even have this. This is like, it won't matter
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:10.200]  to the media. They're not going to cover it, but you'll see it. And see, that's the problem.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:15.720]  They know now that we're as big as they are bigger and collectively that the independent media is
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.920]  much bigger. And so that's why they're so scared. That's why they want to shut down drugs. They
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:22.280]  now admit it. They say, federal election commission others, they say, we're going to shut it down.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:25.160]  Just like the Supreme Court Justice told them a year ago, and they're coming after us. I mean,
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.240]  hell, Hillary names me by name. And then I sit there and do joke videos where I talk about the
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:36.440]  estrogen mimickers in the water and how it is causing frogs to be bisexual and not reproduce
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:42.120]  and fish as well. And then I make a joke. I don't know how the media takes out a context and always
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:48.920]  takes me saying the comment six years ago about gay frogs instead of looking at the real science.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:53.400]  And then they take the new clip out of context and put it national campaign. And I was reading
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.280]  this new ad package by they're talking about it being up to $20 million of them having me
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:02.600]  scream about gay frogs and people say, well, then don't do anything. They can't take out a context.
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:05.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're the ones deceiving. I can't control that.
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.800]  They take little clips of Trump acting goofy and take out a context. We're real.
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:16.040]  That's what real people that don't read off teleprompters and don't follow polls.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:17.960]  You want it real? This is what it looks like. Okay.
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:24.600]  And Hillary has put out her official email to tens of millions of her minions
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:31.560]  about Alex Jones and how bad he is and then how Donald Trump likes the show. Well,
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.880]  you know why? I mean, Donald Trump was told by generals that are advising him who are great
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:41.320]  patriots and by other people about how great I am. He already knew about some of our work,
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.360]  but he began to look into it and he really clicks with it because he's a patriot.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:49.560]  And so, yes, of course, I have an amazing reputation with people that aren't traders.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:55.000]  I mean, all I want to do is have the same tariffs China has on us, you know,
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.120]  like Donald Trump does. Fair, basic stuff. Of course we agree. It's common sense.

[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:05.560]  My name is Liam. I'm 41. I've been using One World Way for two and a half years now.
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:10.840]  I suffered a bulged L4 and L5 disc from a car accident three years ago and since that time I've
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:15.880]  been unable to walk long distances, do any minor lifting or just normal activities with my children
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:21.080]  without having severe back pain. Since I've started using One World Way, I've been able to walk more,
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:25.480]  engage in activities with my children and have less lower back pain. One World Way has helped me
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:30.040]  regain back my strength, confidence and have a healthier life. I've noticed a weight loss of
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:35.720]  about 20 pounds. My A1C dropped two points and I have more energy now. One World Way has helped me
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:40.840]  regain back my life. The results for clients on One World Way have surpassed the results for most

[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:36.360]  This song about Hillary. You know I was thinking during the break.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:41.560]  What headline do I give this Haiti report that's coming out in the next few days?
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.520]  New Haiti report will destroy the Clintons? We probably had 10 headlines like that last year.
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:56.040]  I noticed the troll said, I've seen this headline a bunch. Oh, admitted witty WikiLeaks,
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:59.880]  Hillary running Al Qaeda and ISIS. This will destroy Hillary if it gets out.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:06.360]  Doesn't get out enough? She just keeps sailing on. Am I lying? It should destroy her. The Benghazi
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:11.880]  stand down being confirmed. We said Hillary ordering Benghazi stand down confirmed. This
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:21.800]  can destroy her. But it's like let's hypothetically say I'm shooting a bison with a 500 Smith and
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:29.960]  Wesson. I don't mean this violently towards her. It's just an analogy. It doesn't destroy the bison
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:39.720]  unless you actually use it. See the difference. We're an analogy but it's from an experience I had
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:47.160]  once. We're sitting here looking at this and it does what's there informed. It just gets crazy
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.480]  and crazier. We're not in the echo chamber. We're in the real world. All I do is read
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:57.080]  everything. All I do is study everything and I am marveling that Hillary's gotten away with so much.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:04.600]  It's crazy. Now I've got this amazing Newt Genrich clip and listen, I don't like Newt
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:09.480]  Genrich. He was hired by the Rockefeller's as a professor and a political analyst. He has said a
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:13.400]  lot of great things in the years but then flopped on it. He's been for illegal wars.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:19.800]  But when he talks and tells the truth and it's not that I believe him. I know what he says is
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:25.320]  total truth. In this new CNN clip, he destroys them. That's coming up. We start the next hour.
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:32.920]  But he really does annihilate them with the truth about how there has been a coup in this country
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:37.960]  by 20 media executives to deceive the American people. The question is, will the coup d'etat
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:42.600]  be successful? This is a death battle by multinational interests who bought off the media
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:47.640]  to see if they can really get away with selling us and going under world government,
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:52.280]  which is all being announced. I mean, you can't have a world government and announce it in the
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:56.200]  New York Times and then have the Pope announce it and everybody else announce it and then say
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:59.240]  we're anti-Semitic because we don't want to be under a world government. It's kind of like
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:03.160]  we're racist because we don't want Obamacare. What the hell does that have to do with it?
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:07.960]  Oh, the president's black. I forgot. Now it'll be you don't like women because you don't want,
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:12.280]  you know, whatever new nightmare Hillary's got, like banning our guns with executive orders.
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:21.000]  But we have all the arsenal here to bring down their political system in an infill war.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.840]  We're locked and loaded people. You've just got to get it out to everybody and make
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:29.560]  your so-called liberal friends get through your comfort zone. Go up to them, show them,
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:35.160]  go look at this. This new Haiti report because a lot of liberals aren't bad people if they're not
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:40.120]  brain bug level, you know, controller liberals, but actual well-being liberals say, look,
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:45.240]  this is the Haitians hate her. She stole two billion. Why is that okay? That's killing people.
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:50.040]  Her own daughter's emails say we're killing people. 10,000 died just because they let the UN do this
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:56.760]  horrible stuff. Let's go out to break with the vice president, Tim Cain, again demonizing Trump.
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:01.080]  We're talking about this being rigged because it's so obvious. I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:06.520]  Here it is. You don't control reality, Cain. Especially in the last couple of days as Donald
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:11.720]  Trump has kind of started to go wilder and wilder. I think after, by all accounts, losing the first
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:17.560]  two debates, he started to make wild claims, kind of scorched earth claims about the election being
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:23.320]  rigged, et cetera. So we have to keep putting out a message and we need to call on everybody
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:26.680]  to speak out about the fact that we run elections.
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:33.320]  The war for the hearts and minds of the American people will continue.
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:37.000]  On the other side of this quick break, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:47.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:56.600]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:59:02.280]  about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential for power grid
[01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:09.160]  chaos, EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms,
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:14.200]  all a very real threat to our grid. My friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:19.480]  worse. That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:24.840]  of backup electricity. Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house. The
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:30.440]  solutions from science system simply put, this thing is amazing. Solutions from science only

[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:50.440]  This is the one I use in my home. Go to power grid chaos.com and get 70% off.
[01:59:50.440 --> 02:00:00.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:18.200]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:20.520]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:28.680]  All right. I am certainly overwhelmed today. I have not gotten to the WikiLeaks info yet.
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:33.560]  I have not gotten to the clips yet. We have Roger Stone popping in. We're going to have the big
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:39.080]  Haiti news tomorrow and Wednesday. I was going to do it today, but Haven was in the air delivering
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:42.600]  food. I don't want to get in the middle of that. So we're going to cover it tomorrow and the next day.
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:49.960]  Incredibly damning to the Clintons. Just Haiti is on fire with anger against them.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:57.080]  People are dying. The UN is refusing to render aid. They've seen no Clinton Foundation support
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:02.280]  and that dirty foundation is still collecting money for Haiti right now. I mean, I have entered
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:08.360]  the twilight zone. This is so bold, but not just by them, by their constituents. Let's back up to
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:13.000]  Kane to play the full clip and then I'll get to the amazing Newt Gennrich clip, which if it is amazing,
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:19.640]  I have to say it. I mean, it's what's so frustrating. Gennrich knows exactly what's going on. He's
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:23.320]  why he's a top operative. If for whatever reason he's chosen to go with Trump because he's smart,
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:27.160]  thinks Trump's going to win. Or maybe he was like, he's like Darth Vader and going to get good at the
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:32.840]  end. I don't know, but it's very truthful, very astute, very piercing, very on target. And it's
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.480]  just, it makes it worse because I don't trust him, but it doesn't matter. It's coming up.
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:40.920]  See, it makes me like him. I don't like that. You know how that feeling? Love hate.
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:46.840]  Let's go ahead and go to the Tim King clip. And this is all lies. She cheated in the first debate.
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:51.560]  It was two against one. He barely won because of the cheating. I think that's an accurate statement,
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:56.600]  but because he didn't attack, he lost with constituents, but overall barely won. He annihilated
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:01.800]  her. Even most Democrats had met that. But Tim Kane, the little bug-eyed bastard, it's not fair
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:08.520]  to bastard to call him that. I apologize. The little bug-eyed weasel. The man who I would cast to
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:11.480]  play child molesters in movies. I mean, I'm not saying it's a child molester, but you know,
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:16.120]  those fake allegations against Trump on sex stuff, almost says you're like a pervert.
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:21.480]  Well, he should drive an ice cream truck or something, but let's go ahead and go to Mr.
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:27.640]  Ice Cream Truck Driver. Especially in the last couple of days, as Donald Trump has kind of started
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:32.840]  to go wilder and wilder, I think after, by all accounts, losing the first two debates,
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:36.760]  he started to make wild claims, kind of scorched her claims about the.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:42.040]  No, he knows he's winning an internal polling and he knows you people are lying over and over and
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:47.240]  over and over again. And you want to play the part of the daddy, the authority who decides what the
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:53.320]  rules are and doesn't make wild statements. While your surrogates say we're all racist and evil and
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:58.440]  Republicans get firebombed and you pull out all the stops and say he hates all Mexicans and do
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:02.920]  all this other stuff. And then we up our rhetoric and actually cover what you stand for and you're
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:07.720]  crapping your pants, begging us to stop because the latest internal emails show you guys are panicking
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:12.600]  that we're overturning your entire paradigm. So that's what's really happening is Trump is dealing
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:18.520]  you political death blows. You might try to steal the election. You might coast over the line here,
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:25.240]  buddy. But nationalism is rising and you know it, turd basket. Let's go back to him claims about
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:31.160]  the election being rigged, etc. So we have to keep putting out a message and we need to call on
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:37.240]  everybody to speak out about the fact that we run elections and we run them well here. He shouldn't
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:42.760]  be engaging in those scare tactics. And so we're needing to push that message. And we ask GOP leaders
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:47.000]  also to stand up for the integrity of the American electoral process. Okay, so let's be clear.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:52.200]  They mean the GOP horse, the establishment globalist that have always been trying to sabotage Trump,
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.480]  that have been voting with the Democrats and the multinationals to solve the country's out.
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:59.880]  I want to take this tame clip though. And I want to show my original warning on the election,
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:04.760]  how they stole it from Sanders. Trump responding saying they're gonna try to steal it. Then the
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:10.040]  election officials coming out admitting it's already been stolen Democrats. Then the fed saying
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:15.000]  they're gonna federalize it to keep it safe from Trump and the Ruskies. But there's total integrity.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.680]  And so Trump shouldn't say there's a problem. See, they know their constituents
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:24.040]  are so stupid. They think socialism delivers when it delivers nightmares, North Korea,
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:27.880]  that they think he can sit there and say, there is no elections run. It doesn't exist.
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:32.200]  But there's a total emergency in our elections in total peril. So the you in the EU and everybody
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:38.920]  else is coming into control our elections. They just keep doing this and they keep doing it and
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:44.280]  doing it and doing it. It's like I do a whole rant and show 20 mainstream news articles where they
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:50.440]  admit that chemicals in the water are destroying fertility and creating asexual and bisexual traits
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:55.960]  in animals that are causing mutations. I go and then and then they claim I'm talking about gay frogs.
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:05:15.960]  They cut it out again and say it's about gay frogs.
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:34.920]  was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper. Revelation dawn of global government.
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:40.200]  We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more to it than that. Starring Alex Jones,

[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:06.360]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:12.040]  about on the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential for power grid
[02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:18.920]  chaos, EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms,
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:23.960]  all a very real threat to our grid. My friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:29.240]  worse. That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply

[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:17.880]  long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important. What the aging process is, is when the
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:24.120]  cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:28.840]  of our chromosomes. And when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:34.520]  175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works
[02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:40.840]  like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor. So this is a formula to deliver the
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:47.000]  maximum amount. It's in powder form. We have so many five star reviews. I take this. This is,

[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:32.840]  to the Alex Jones show. Roger Stone's got big breaking news joining us at the bottom of this
[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:40.520]  hour, former head of the Trump campaign. The media has figured out one of his top advisors
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:48.040]  figured out a few other things too, and they're not too happy to say the least. I mean, we've got
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.400]  foreign occupiers in this country. We've got globalists that have conquered it via fraud.
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:58.840]  They think that they control the entire narrative of the entire paradigm and they've
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:04.760]  totally discredited themselves in the attempt at using whatever influence they have left on
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:12.840]  weak-minded people, on childlike people. They have totally shot their wad. And I predict,
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:19.000]  no matter how this election goes, you're going to see a huge shake up and a lot of the pundits you
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:26.120]  see on TV will not be there after this election on CNN, MSNBC, you name it, because one way of
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:32.680]  trying to get credibility back is bringing fresh faces. But this really is an incredible time to
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:37.880]  be alive and they're throwing everything they've got at Trump with the mountains of confirmed
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:44.840]  lying and selling secrets and selling access to foreign governments and Hillary even representing
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:50.040]  other foreign governments for money. I never thought of that. She didn't just take money to
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:55.480]  sell out to U.S. She took money for access to get to the Chinese president and others. It's like,
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:10:01.240]  whoa, you think you know a lot and then you get schooled when it's worse than you thought.
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:06.440]  So we'll go through some of that when Stone joins us, but I've got a lot of economic news.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:10.280]  Again, Deutsche Bank is rolling over quick. They want to hurry up, get this election done,
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:14.200]  and then implode it, whether it's Hillary or Trump. But they know Trump's not going to go
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:19.800]  along with new banker bailouts and selling the country further out and losing more sovereignty.
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:25.240]  And that's why he endangers their entire apple cart. Now, again, I've said this in the last hour.
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:29.320]  I want to preface this. Newt Gendrich has written a lot of books. I've read them.
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:36.920]  Gendrich has prefaced a lot of books. I've read them. He's a smart guy. He signed on as a globalist
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:42.040]  with the Rockefellers and Nelson Rockefeller's campaign. I do not trust him any further than
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:47.720]  you can throw him. And it's a good thing that Trump didn't pick him as his VP. But I'll say this.
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:52.280]  What he says in this piece I'm about to play is dead on accurate.
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:57.560]  And again, that's why he frustrates me because I know he knows what's going on.
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:02.280]  I've read some of his books. But then what he does politically is something entirely different.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:08.040]  But what he says here is absolutely on target. The video is Newt Gendrich owns ABC News,
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  Martha Raditz, who did the whole debate last week over anti-Trump coverage. Listen to this very carefully.
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:23.320]  You heard Tim Kaine talk about his concerns over charges of a rigged election. But Mr.
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:29.240]  Trump has been continuing to ramp up the rhetoric and tweets and speeches. Senator Jeff Sessions
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:35.160]  joined the course yesterday saying they are attempting to rig the election. So who are they
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:39.400]  and how are they doing this? Well, I think they are the news media. This is not about election
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:45.720]  officials at the precinct level. This is about last Friday when the networks spent 23 minutes
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:51.320]  on the Trump tape and less than one minute, all three networks combined, less than one minute
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:55.800]  on Hillary Clinton's secret speeches that were being revealed in WikiLeaks. And you look at that
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:00.840]  and you say, I mean, I think it's amazing that Trump is as close as he is right now considering
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:05.560]  the one-sidedness of the news media barrage. And the best description of it is by Barry
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:10.600]  Castleman in his blog where he said, this is a coup d'etat. He said 14 million citizens in
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:15.880]  private ballots picked Donald Trump. 20 TV executives have decided to destroy him.
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:22.200]  But you say it's not at the precinct level, but Trump has also told people to monitor polling
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:26.920]  stations. They should. You look at Philadelphia, you look at St. Louis, you look at Chicago.
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:32.440]  I mean, again, I'm old enough. I remember when Richard Nixon had the election stolen in 1960
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:39.000]  and no serious historian doubts that Illinois and Texas were stolen. So to suggest that we have,
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:45.480]  that you don't have theft in Philadelphia is to deny reality. So you really think this election
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:50.600]  could be stolen. Do you believe that if Mr. Trump loses, it will be because of a massive
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:54.920]  conspiracy or fraud, not because more Americans voted for someone else?
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:13:00.120]  I think that without the unending one-sided assault on the news media, Trump would be
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:04.440]  beating Hillary by 15 points. I think when you look at WikiLeaks and you look at all the things
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:08.680]  she has said, when you look at the deals in Russia that Bill Clinton made and that the
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:13.560]  Clinton Foundation made and all this nonsense by Kane about Russia, it's Clinton, Bill Clinton,
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:17.720]  who got a half million dollar speech. It is the Clintons who got money for the Clinton Foundation
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:22.760]  from Russia. It is, it is Podesta who was on a Russian company advisory board that was apparently
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:27.800]  funded by Putin. So the news media is one side and this is the worst I've seen in my lifetime and
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:33.080]  I'm old enough. That's a fairly long statement. Bill Clinton settles rape cases. They accuse
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:39.160]  Trump of sexual assault for touching women or shaking their hands. And then it turns out the
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:44.760]  women are begging him for jobs or him to come visit them. Not 10 years ago when they say this,
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:51.720]  but now. Basically, stalkers is what it's starting to look like.
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:58.360]  But they're in bed with the Russians, so they accuse Trump of being in bed with the Russians.
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:01.160]  I want to go to another one of these clips here. There's a bunch of these.
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:06.360]  Well, there's the second part again, which let's play first. And then I want to get
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:09.960]  to Chuck Todd, who uses Mike Pence. Here's the second part again, Rich.
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:14.840]  I'm just saying to you there are clearly cases where you clearly have intimidation. There are
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:18.920]  cases where you clearly have theft. There are cases where people, there's a guy in California
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:23.560]  who was voting 24 years after he died. I mean, so to suggest to us that people who are concerned
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:28.200]  about honest elections are somehow nutty, I think is a mistake. Second, Trump's major
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:32.360]  complaint about the election is not polls. It's not at the poll level. It's at the news media
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:37.560]  level. This election is being rigged by the national media who are doing everything they can
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:42.200]  to suppress bad news about Hillary and everything they can to maximize bad news about Trump.
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:45.320]  You just heard me talk about WikiLeaks with Tim Kaine.
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:52.840]  Yes, you spent how long of that session on Trump and sex and then how long of that session?
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:56.760]  I'm just suggesting to you. Let's talk a little bit about his language this week.
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:05.240]  And then she changes the subject. The numbers have been done. They're giving 20 to 1 coverage,
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:10.200]  depending on what story you look at. Some it's worse to WikiLeaks that they're giving to the
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:15.720]  sex stuff and anybody can turn the news on and see that. But that's not even the issue here.
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:23.000]  They're sitting there saying we've got to federalize the election because it's the worst ever
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:29.720]  total penetration by hackers and the Russians. But Trump is insane. I keep going back to this
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:35.640]  because he's warning of election fraud. Think about it. Then if I was
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:42.440]  again rich, I would have raised the point. Wait a minute. You're saying there isn't
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:46.440]  collusion with the media and Hillary. Look at all these WikiLeaks. I haven't printed out
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:50.680]  where she's talking to CNN. Her people are telling him what to do. The New York Times,
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:56.120]  MSNBC, you name it. You're getting directives from her. You've been caught.
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:02.920]  But the woman sits there laughing again. It's like, oh, really? Oh, yeah.
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:06.120]  Like the Clinton news network is connected to the Clintons.
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:16.520]  Now, going to the next clip, this is the VP candidate on again with another Democratic
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:21.080]  Party operative. I love how most of these people are admitted former top operatives of the Democratic
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:26.520]  Party, whether it's Wolf Blitzer or whether it's Chuck Todd or just most of them are.
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:33.240]  Stephanopoulos. Chuck Todd interviews Mike Pence. Here's a clip of that where they get into the
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:37.880]  women again and keep calling it substantiated. That's the first part and it's not substantiated.
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:42.840]  It's totally made up. It's passed the statute of limitations on purpose. But then Pence gets
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:48.280]  some of the conspiracy. Here it is. Well, as you know, Donald Trump does not want to move off of
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:55.080]  this issue. In fact, he said he's been getting advice saying that, but instead he has been responding
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:59.880]  to every single accusation. Here's what he has said about a couple of the different accusers.
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:07.080]  She's right. She's a liar. She is a liar. She's writing a story. Check out her Facebook page.
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:14.120]  You'll understand. I was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me on the plane. Yeah,
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:20.040]  I'm going to go after. Believe me, he would not be my first choice that I can tell you.
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:25.800]  You don't know. That would not be my first choice.
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:33.400]  That was Friday, Governor Pence. You just dismissed it as just talk. We now have nine accusers that
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:37.560]  have come out since you have said it's just talk. Do you really believe it's just talk?
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:46.520]  I really do, Chuck. You know, what we have this week is a series of unsubstantiated allegations.
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:49.320]  And Donald Trump... Let me stop you there. They're not unsubstantiated.
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:51.480]  He's categorically denied... Well, hang on. They're not unsubstantiated.
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:53.880]  He's categorically denied those allegations, Chuck.
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:59.720]  You have first-hand accounts. They're unproven. But they are not unsubstantiated. You have a
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:04.200]  first-hand account. Hit pause. We have somebody that disagrees. Something isn't substantiated
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:11.000]  till you have evidence or someone concurring with it. It is unsubstantiated. And most now in
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.520]  criminology, they say over half of claims of rape are unsubstantiated. Does it go on? Absolutely.
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:20.680]  Do men abuse women? Absolutely. I have daughters. I love women. I don't... The point is it's a weapon
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:28.040]  everybody knows that is used politically. How many women say, you know, after a divorce case,
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:31.320]  oh, my husband forced sex on me, let her say, oh, that wasn't true. It was just political.
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:35.960]  Because that's what the lawyers tell women to do. This is what lawyers are clearly spending.
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:39.960]  But watching Todd do this is so nauseating. Continuum.
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:43.720]  These are that first-hand account. But they are substantiated, no?
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:51.240]  Well, no, these are not substantiated accounts. These are people who have brought forward allegations
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:56.840]  going back in some cases, decades. And Donald Trump has made it clear that he categorically
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:01.480]  denies that these things ever took place. But I have to tell you, it really is astonishing
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:06.840]  to most Americans that as these unsubstantiated allegations are treated with an enormous amount
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:11.880]  of coverage on this network and other networks, that revelations coming out of Secretary of State
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:17.240]  Clinton's years in the State Department and the Clinton Foundation are virtually ignored
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:22.440]  by the national media. I mean, we discovered this week that State Department officials
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:28.680]  actually directed contracts for the Haitian recovery after the earthquake to friends of
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:35.320]  the Clintons. And literally, that got almost no media attention while those that step forward
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:40.920]  with these unsubstantiated claims that Donald Trump has denied were treated with headline
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:45.560]  news and continuous coverage. It's one of the reasons why so many Americans feel like this
[02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:50.760]  election is being rigged by a national media that's constantly trying to change the subject away
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:57.480]  from and practice willful interests toward the corruption and misdeeds and pay for play politics.
[02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:06.200]  I mean, if I was Governor Pence, I'd say, Todd, you work for the Clintons and Obama as a major
[02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:10.200]  political operative. Look at the media gets full, you people. Then I'd go, what about Clinton settling
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:15.400]  all these sexual assault cases? You sit there shaking your head looking all upset about Trump
[02:20:15.400 --> 02:20:22.440]  supposedly touching on women. And by the way, we have these women, some of them contacting Trump
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:27.640]  just the last year, asking for jobs or asking for him to come visit them and saying how wonderful
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:35.720]  he is. You contact thousands of women and you get nine of them to say stuff. You put a drag net
[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:41.000]  out. And that's why you're so discredited. But notice he hit on the key. And that was Haiti.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.560]  The reason they want to run a national ad campaign with myself and trying to discredit Trump is so
[02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:55.080]  Trump doesn't go with our intel. We went with the cargo planes to aircraft. We sent crew to Haiti
[02:20:55.080 --> 02:21:02.440]  for five days. They just got back. I want to send them back. I mean, we hit a goldmine of evidence
[02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:06.680]  against the Clintons. And attention to this will help the Haitian people. It's a 360 win.
[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:13.400]  People dying, the UN refusing to help people dying, children dying. The UN there to just make you
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:18.600]  give the aid to them and then they disappear it. It's all on video. The Haitians just all over mobs
[02:21:18.600 --> 02:21:23.480]  of people hating the Clintons like they're the devil because they know they stole basically all the
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:31.800]  money. No aid from the Clintons. Government officials saying how horrible the Clintons are.
[02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:37.000]  Haitians protesting them here in the United States. So Pence understands this.
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:42.120]  You know, Trump tweeted out one of our tweets today or a couple of them and they make a big
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:46.520]  national deal. Look, Trump did this and Trump tweeted in full wars and Trump tweeted Paul
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:52.360]  Watson and President Clinton. And look, his son keeps tweeting, you know, Donald Jr. is the worst
[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:58.440]  asset Trump's got. That's some trying to control the narrative. Telling him, you know,
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:03.800]  that's some trying to control the narrative. Telling you what not to go with. Don't go with Haiti.
[02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:09.880]  Don't go with info wars. They only send crews into the war zones and have the proof. Watch,
[02:22:09.880 --> 02:22:12.600]  there'll be a debate within the Trump camp. We put this video out the next few days.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:20.280]  Trying to keep it from Trump and trying to, oh, don't don't send out an info wars report. I mean,
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:25.240]  they'll say that's just credited because stop letting Hillary control the narrative. It comes
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:29.720]  out of these internal conference calls and stuff when Trump and people are like telling him, they'll
[02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:33.960]  say your races. If you keep saying, we have to have a defense. He goes, it isn't true. I don't
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:40.280]  care. Forward, ignore them. We're here to change things. We're not here to just go along with the
[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:45.640]  establishment. We're revolutionaries. We want to overturn the globalist operation.
[02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:52.120]  That's why they're so scared. We're not trying to look at Alex Jones. He didn't check the poll
[02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:56.040]  numbers. He didn't fit into the demographic of this or that. He didn't manipulate this group.
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:02.440]  No, because I know about history and Americana and free market and taxes and regulations and
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:07.240]  political systems. And I know how powerful our system is. And I've read the white papers that are
[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:14.760]  public by Carol Quigley, by Brazilian presence key, by Roth, cop, by Kissinger, by all of them.
[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:20.280]  About the American system is too powerful. It will outproduce everyone. This is in the 70s.
[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:23.400]  We must turn off the major systems of control with price fixing.
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:29.720]  And then we must transfer the offshore systems so that we can manage the different nation
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:34.680]  states between themselves. It's like in the movie Rollerball, where you've got one country can only
[02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:40.040]  do energy. Another country can only do electronics. Another country can only do transportation. And
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:43.640]  then they all break up defense because you're going to have one group doing that. And that was
[02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:48.120]  kind of a movie about globalism and what they were actually planning. And then if you're a corporate
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:52.680]  executive in Rollerball, it doesn't matter if you're the international world champion
[02:23:53.640 --> 02:24:00.440]  that James Conn plays. They wanted his wife as an act of power. One of the top global executives
[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:04.760]  gets his wife. And that's why he finally stops calling the orders and starts killing people
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:09.480]  out on the field to totally dominate and not give up when they want him to in a rig game.
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:14.520]  For globalism, because you can't have one man or one team. It's too strong. That has to fall.
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:19.800]  It's a metaphor for nations. The United States has to fall. James Conn has to fall. Houston,
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.200]  Texas has to fall for the new world order because it can't have something that's better
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:30.760]  sticking its head up. You ever thought about that? It's all just thrown in your face. We get your
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:40.200]  wife. We get your kids. We run your life. Now you're going to lose. You're going to lose against
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:46.920]  Tokyo. You're going to lose. You're going to lay down. You're going to roll over. We're going to
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:50.680]  make sure your electricity costs three times more than anybody. We're going to make sure your gas
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:53.800]  costs more. We're going to make sure your education costs more. We're going to make sure your
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:58.120]  health care is crap. We're going to feed your kids poison. We're going to give them garbage media.
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:03.560]  We're going to dump them down. We're going to have a bunch of hunchback demons like Chris Todd
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:07.560]  lording over a bunch of angry little nerds who are always angry at the kids that were cooler
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:12.840]  than them and want to run everything down. My God, I'm going to screw them over. They all write
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:16.600]  white papers about floor riding the water, lowering your IQ, and they sit around and
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:23.240]  talk about you and your family, and they go on Charlie Rose. Yeah, a bunch of little pansies
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:29.480]  up there going. It's not that they're gay on Charlie Rose. It's just something weird about
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:35.320]  a feminine guy. He wrote the line about how you keep your doctrine. They're all like hopping
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:40.680]  around laughing. You turn to another channel and then it's like, you know, another twit.
[02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:45.880]  Groober going, thank God they're so dumb. We all scammed them. And the professors are all laughing
[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:50.680]  and you tune to another guy. Gibbs is, yeah, we're lying about drones that don't exist when they exist.
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:59.240]  And clip after clip after clip after clip, just celebrating, overrunning everyone,
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:05.240]  celebrating, screwing everyone, celebrating, trashing everyone. These are our leaders because
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:11.960]  they can sit around and laugh at people because their rich parents sent them to Harvard and
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:17.160]  they're all part of the club. And it's okay when they're fascists because they're gay.
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:22.600]  And it's okay when gay people have war with Russia because then it's liberal. And when we
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:27.560]  steal 94% of the money from the Haitians and we kill black people and the UN literally
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:35.960]  craps in their water supply. It's okay because we, we bit our wrist. I'm gay. So it's all right.
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:41.320]  I'm, I'm supporting evil and bankrupting small businesses. I mean, you know, it's just like,
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:50.040]  whoa, man. Whoa, it's not okay. So we've just given the country over to a bunch of rotten,
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:56.040]  decadent, and intelligentsia who in their own emails go, the public's waking up, go to,
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:01.960]  go to regional and class and race warfare. I mean, the WikiLeaks say it. We're in trouble.
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:06.760]  They're waking up. They still don't know what's going on, but they're not complying. We know that.
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:13.080]  I suggest we go with serious measures dealing with, what was the exact quote, demographic,
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:22.040]  demographic control mechanisms. And that you just ship in a million Arabs from the most war-torn
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:27.400]  areas where if their mother was seen outside without a hood overhead, the son would be so upset
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:31.320]  he'd pour gasoline on mama and burner. He'd cry though, but he had to do it for Allah,
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:37.000]  bringing in the most whacked out looms you ever did see. And they say in the emails,
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.840]  this will be totally incompatible. Everything will go crazy. Then we'll come in and take
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:45.160]  everybody's free speech to not upset the Arabs. That's in all the new WikiLeaks. I already knew
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:50.600]  that a year ago, two years, I know their plan. I don't need another WikiLeaks, another document,
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:52.920]  another thing where they admit what they're doing to us.
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:00.280]  I mean, just call these people on their bluffs, these arrogant, weird,
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:10.040]  like just cowards celebrating how they're ripping everybody off. And again, I want to explain.
[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:13.720]  I'm not bashing those guys because they act completely effeminate. It's not even effeminate.
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:19.560]  Whatever that weird thing is they do, it's that they're celebrating, screwing people,
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:24.840]  and consolidating the economy, and giggling about it, and are so disconnected, they're on
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:33.160]  national TV doing it. And it's always the same. These aren't real men. Real men cannot sit there
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:38.280]  and screw over little people and get off on it. And then call themselves the altruistic loving
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:43.640]  liberals. It was demographically inspired messaging. The unawareness remains strong.
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:47.080]  Imagine this sounds like a science fiction movie. The unawareness remains strong,
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:53.080]  but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. The problem demands some serious, serious thinking
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:59.960]  and not just pole-driven, demographically inspired messaging. Race-based messaging,
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:04.280]  that's from a couple years ago, wherein crisis go directly to race war.
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:08.440]  And what's the new email? That isn't clear enough by Podesta.
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:15.160]  Sir, it's an Arab and his wife just shot everybody up. Implement immediate cover-up in the media.
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:18.680]  Damn. I wish he'd been white. That would have been useful. We told you,
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:23.320]  I don't care if it's a white guy, a black guy shooting people up, it's wrong.
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:27.400]  They just seized on it. Because remember, when it was one crazy white guy shooting the black people?
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:31.240]  Everybody's like, that's terrible, that's horrible. And he's like, that's right. All whites have guilt
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:37.640]  now. Take on your guilt. La, la, la. And do Teva give us your guns? Hey, but you got bodyguards.
[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:46.920]  Shut up. But it's okay if your big daddy, Michael Moore, he can have bodyguards. He's special.
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:50.440]  You just don't get him. You understand how that works? He's an elitist.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:57.160]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.160 --> 02:30:05.160]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation.
[02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:09.960]  Charlie Daniels. He's always loved America. He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:13.880]  Let me just read a little thing here from the beginning of the 21. The American system of
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:18.840]  justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to take
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:23.000]  a back seat, do the collected. Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you? It's
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:28.680]  gonna become a few guns. Oh, yeah. I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all. It ain't
[02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:33.320]  gonna sit well. Do you ever wonder what happened to America? It's time to ride, boys. We need a
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:39.480]  thousand paul reviewers. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:47.080]  apple pie. And beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings
[02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:54.120]  on demand. DVDs now available. Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin.

[02:31:00.920 --> 02:31:05.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:10.600]  the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:16.360]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:21.880]  brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:27.240]  pure breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family,

[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:37.880]  our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for
[02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:44.600]  themselves. The general public hasn't. The Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:49.560]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally
[02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:54.440]  putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a
[02:31:54.440 --> 02:31:59.240]  job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today. InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:33:02.120 --> 02:33:05.320]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know,
[02:33:05.320 --> 02:33:14.200]  but I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in
[02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:20.200]  the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November. And I'm telling you
[02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:23.960]  November 8th, we better be careful because that election is going to be rigged. First of all,
[02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:28.600]  it's rigged. And I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest. And I hope the
[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:33.640]  Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us. America teaches everybody
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:39.640]  how to live in, quote, democracy. But what? You actually believe that they have democratic elections
[02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:45.560]  there? If Hillary steals the nomination and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:53.320]  add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out. Hillary Clinton has had every advantage,
[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:58.760]  every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party. It has been rigged.
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:07.720]  The political parties choose their nominee and that's the general public. That's very good
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:12.120]  question. It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz,
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:17.960]  exactly for what? Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously. And to the extent there are
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:22.120]  things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they're
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:27.640]  being done. When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:31.720]  Actually I think that's part of it. And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:37.480]  evidence of fraud and guess what there is. She stole the nomination. Of course the elections
[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:42.920]  will not be rigged. What does that mean? How would the party pick a new nominee? Today is the day
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:47.960]  they're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket. He now looks increasingly
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:53.560]  like the kamikaze candidate. An implosion, the likes of which I have never seen. The biggest
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:58.920]  problem we have is we have a very dishonest media. If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:11.480]  conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas,
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:17.400]  that's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:23.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. Roger Stone just got out of the airport. He's
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:30.440]  in a car being driven. I tell you, they are demonizing Roger Stone in campaign ads. They're
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:33.880]  demonizing him all over the news. Now they've doubled down. I'm told they're running something
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:38.440]  like $20 million worth of ads in this new package. I'm told they're going to have multiple ads with
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:43.560]  yours truly in it, taking things out of context, twisting it just like they've done Trump. I think
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:48.040]  they're just desperate to try to get Trump to moderate what he's doing because the more he
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:52.920]  gets hardcore, the more they lose like the last debate. I think he should destroy her in 48 hours.
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:57.720]  Wednesday's debate, we're going to have 13 hours of live coverage kicking off at 11am,
[02:35:57.720 --> 02:36:03.240]  running past midnight. The final showdown, then we'll be 19 days out. We're 21 days out. We have
[02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:10.600]  CNN host blaming firebombing of Republican HQ on Donald Trump. CNN says it's illegal for you to
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:15.080]  read WikiLeaks, Hillary Clinton emails, but you can go to them. I mean, the arrogance of these
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:20.280]  loans is incredible. Roger Stone, we have his Bill Clinton rape shirt available that's sending
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:25.480]  shock waves through the campaign, circumventing the media blackout on that, available at infowarstore.com,
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:30.440]  as well as the limited edition Hillary for Prison shirt. Now that cost $9.95. When they're gone,
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:35.400]  they're gone. I'm not printing anymore. So after the election, no more. All those great things come
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:41.720]  and go. Thanks for your support. We need the support. Roger Stone. Wow. I don't know where to
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:46.040]  begin. So much is happening. You were tweeting me last night this morning saying, I guess you did
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:50.040]  predict that the October surprise might be war with Russia. That's what the Russians think it is.
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:54.040]  And we have declarations of war against them outside of Congress by the bureaucracy and Joe
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:58.200]  Biden. I mean, I've kind of set the table a lot of points. What do you want to tackle first?
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:07.560]  Or do you have some wild card not on my radar or being attacked by the president of the United
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:14.440]  States by name? He specifically attacked info wars. Now we learn that you are the subject of a
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:20.680]  Hillary Clinton attack ad. They just don't seem to understand that that which does not kill you
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:29.880]  makes you stronger. As you know, the Clintonites have now rolled out their third day of attack on
[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:40.200]  me. Their new spokesman, incredibly former deputy CIA director, Mike Morrell, the man responsible
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:49.320]  for the Benghazi cover up wants me investigated for my non existent ties to Russia. Trump has
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:54.680]  got to take it to them having the Benghazi guy who literally ordered the stand down for Hillary
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:38:02.520]  holding the bag has the nerve to call us traders. Yeah, no, the irony of this, of course, is that
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:10.600]  there's a piece in political now, which says that the Clintons revile me and they want my ties to
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:16.520]  Russia exposed. There are no ties to Russia. I've never taken penny from the Russians. I have no
[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:21.720]  Russian connections. I'm a loyal American. The problem I have with the Clintons is their conspiracy
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:27.800]  theorists. You see, they expect us to believe that nobody died in Libya under her watch or that
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:34.040]  the white water building record just popped up at the office or that Chelsea Clinton is Bill's
[02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:40.360]  daughter or that Danny Williams is not Bill's son. I don't know how they can expect us to believe
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:46.120]  all these outrageous and crazy conspiracy theories. You know, I've noticed they attack what they know
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:50.360]  is strong. They keep telling Trump back off election fraud. It doesn't exist while they claim
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:55.640]  we're planning election fraud. It's oxymoronic, but it looks like Trump is really getting more
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:00.600]  hardcore now. Like he did the second debate, what is your gut or what are you hearing about
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:04.920]  what's going to happen Wednesday? Because as you know, Axelrod is trying to get Hillary to drop out.
[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:13.560]  Well, as you know, the Donald Trump kind of got out there and said that she ought to submit to a
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:20.280]  drug test prior to the debate. She sure looked juiced up to me. I don't think that's a bad start.
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:28.120]  Look, he's got to brush aside these women, these ringers who have come forward and accused him
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:35.720]  falsely of sexual assault. None of them have any corroboration. None of them were reported at the
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:41.960]  time. And now with the help of WikiLeaks, we expose the fact that this is awesome. David Brock
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:52.200]  constructed fraud. The attack on me about the alleged advance knowledge of the hacking of John
[02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:59.880]  Podesta's emails is an attempt to deflect from the substance of the emails. Just to say it again,
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:06.680]  I had no advance knowledge. I've received no information, no emails, no files from WikiLeaks.
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:13.000]  I do have a source. The source tells me that two Wednesdays ago when WikiLeaks appealed to pull
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:20.760]  back, it was because Secretary of State John Terry threatened the Ecuadorian president with grave
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:27.080]  consequences if the Ecuador government did not silence Assange. Then there was a conference
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:33.160]  call with every South and Central American president in which they were told that if they did not
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:39.000]  pressure the government of Ecuador to silence Assange, there would be grave consequences.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  And I should add Assange had his internet cut today by a state actor and so has now implemented
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:50.680]  a plan. I guess to dump even more data as a failsafe. So I guess he's gone up a defense condition.
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:54.600]  He's gone from defense condition three to two is the word we're getting. And again,
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:58.200]  the New York Times, the Washington Post, they can interview Assange. You just went through an
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:02.040]  intermediary that went and talked to him. I mean, you've always been honest about that. And so they
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:07.240]  want to act like you're some horrible criminal and the FBI should come after you. Well, look,
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:13.400]  as I've said, I would be happy to cooperate with the FBI. They will find nothing zero. My only
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:19.160]  connection to Russia is a fondness for Russian vodka. Now, I did do some research on you as I
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:25.000]  do this on everybody that I, you know, am involved in and give truck to. Your only condition is there
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:29.320]  was a time when there were Russians reaching out, you call the FBI on them. Now that I saw that in
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:34.520]  one newspaper, you want to talk about that a long time ago? Yeah, 30 years ago, maybe longer when I
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:40.760]  was working in Washington for Ronald Reagan, I had a contact from the Russians offering to bribe me
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:46.840]  for inside information from Reagan's campaign. I went directly to the FBI and reported it.
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:55.880]  So this is a canard. There is no connection between me and the Russians. Ironically, of course,
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:01.880]  of all people to raise this question, Mike Morrell, this guy belongs in prison given his cover up of
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:09.160]  the deaths of four brave Americans in Benghazi. That's the guy they roll up. By the way, Morrell
[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:16.360]  should disclose he is paid cash money by the Clinton campaign to make these false charges.
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:22.520]  He should be ashamed of himself. Now, now, our October surprises are just the truth. I want to
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:28.440]  talk to you because you're good with the media knowing how to get this out. We reached out.
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:33.080]  Gary Haven runs cargo planes every week to Haiti. He's been doing it since the earthquake.
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:37.480]  He's a billionaire. He's given reports. Some reports are upwards 80, 90 million,
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:41.240]  maybe 100 million. They all know him there. He lands. They all love him. He's there offloading
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:48.760]  food. It's not staged. We just say, the Clintons, it's like you said, the devil.
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:53.000]  The Haitians, we already have video of their vice presidents and heads of their Senate saying
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:58.120]  they hate him. But it's like they're the devil there. Riots almost start when you bring them up.
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:03.640]  The UN, again, takes control of whatever food they try to give them. He's landing on these dirt
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:10.920]  airfields doing this. And then we've got people dying. They won't let them get out of their areas
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:15.640]  into the main city of the hospital. So Gary's having to fly him. People are dying while they're
[02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:20.120]  being flown. They're trying to save little kids that have broken backs and stuff. I mean, when
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:24.280]  you actually see what the Clintons have done and how much they're hated, this is powerful. And I
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:29.880]  don't know how we even put this out because the left, everybody, they admit they stole the money.
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:35.640]  They don't seem to care. Yeah, I've seen no stories in the New York Times about the Grand Theft in
[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:42.440]  Haiti. Last weekend, I marched with a group of Haitians downtown outside the office of
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:48.280]  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, the single most corrupt individual in public
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:53.960]  office today. A shakedown artist, a guy who got caught trying to blackmail Donald Trump for
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:44:00.760]  campaign contributions in return to dropping his phony investigation into Trump University.
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:06.200]  What are the Haitians upset about? The fact that Schneiderman is investigating the Trump Foundation
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:12.680]  but has no interest in looking into the rape of Haiti by the Clinton Foundation. We're going to be
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:17.640]  rallying again outside of this office in the near future. I was the only white guy there other than
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:25.400]  my friend Charles Ortel. And I was proud to be there and stand with these proud brave people who
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:29.960]  see their country being destroyed. Let me bring this up to you. You've been sending me text messages
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:33.880]  of victory or death. I guess you're getting that from Colonel Travis. What are the real numbers
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:38.360]  as close as you can see it? What is the effect? It seems like all this woman stuff. It's been
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:41.240]  discredited. It turns out they're trying to get jobs. They're trying to get them to visit with
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:46.120]  them. He has emails. I mean, but the media won't cover that. So what does he do? Just say smear
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:51.720]  campaign, ignore it, move on about globalism, jobs, you know, better trade deals. I mean,
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:55.640]  what does Trump do? But first off, where is Trump right now? I mean, how would you say he's doing?
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:03.240]  Look, I think that he is probably slightly behind based largely on this media onslaught. I've never
[02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:10.520]  seen anything like this in nine presidential campaigns. The media doesn't even pretend to be
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:16.120]  objective. So for example, the report by CNN that it's illegal for citizens to read the
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:26.520]  WikiLeaks material. That's a lie. That's false. And they know it. It is very typical, I think,
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:31.880]  of what we're seeing across the board, which is why I continue to believe that the greatest danger
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:37.480]  is the theft of this election. Now, I'm disappointed, frankly, in the Republicans.
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:44.840]  The Homeland Security Secretary Johnson comes out and says that there's evidence that the
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:51.640]  Russians plan to hack our elections. The ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee,
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:58.440]  Richard Burr says that he doesn't need proof of that. He'll take Johnson at his word. Alex,
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:04.040]  there is no evidence of this. But of course, this is their excuse to come and federalize it.
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:08.360]  Since you mentioned CNN saying it's illegal, look at WikiLeaks. This is evidence of crime.
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:12.120]  It's out in the public domain. You have every right to look at it. They're telling you with
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:16.680]  the arrogance of Cuomo, you have to come to us. You're not allowed to look. It's different. We're
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:22.200]  media. Anybody could start a blog and say you're media and it's public interest. It's a lie. So,
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:26.600]  again, they're really trying to beta test a tyranny where they get a bunch of criminals hired
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:31.560]  media that will go along with anything, including rounding us up, folks. That's why this is total
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:37.720]  war, as Donald Trump said. Here is a Chris Cuomo, an embarrassment that this man is an American.
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:42.520]  He should move to North Korea here it is. Also interesting, remember, it's illegal to possess
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:47.160]  these stolen documents. It's different for the media. So everything you learn about this,
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:52.440]  you're learning from us. And in full disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:57.800]  it means. Joining us now, CNN. So you go to him, the great Gagabur. Here's another clip since we
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:05.640]  mentioned it. We have another one. CNN host blames fire bombing of Republican HQ on Donald Trump.
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:10.200]  So, see, because we're not human, because Trump supporters are racist. They spray Nazi on the
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:14.920]  building. It's okay to burn it down. That's what the Nazis did to Jews, folks. You dehumanize
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:20.120]  somebody. This is the rhetoric. This is their plan B. If it looks like Hillary's is going to lose,
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:24.760]  just have all these groups get activated by the media and go out and burn everything down. Let's
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:28.840]  go ahead and play that clip. So the Arizona Republic getting so many death threats over an
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:34.040]  endorsement is an example of how overheated the rhetoric is. Another example out of North Carolina
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:39.000]  today, the firebombing of a local GOP office. We have no idea who's done this. We don't know if
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:43.160]  it's a Republican, a Democrat, a movement. No idea. Could be some sort of extremism,
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:47.560]  some sort of radical. Hopefully we'll get more information soon. But that kind of action
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:52.360]  is unacceptable. And we need to have the temperature come down on all sides right now.
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:55.320]  Unfortunately, Donald Trump is the lead in terms of raising the temperature.
[02:47:56.600 --> 02:47:59.560]  Donald Trump's the leader of raising the temperature. It's his fault. Other hosts said
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:04.280]  it was his fault outright. So again, they're the ones saying racist, Nazi, evil, you know, hate the
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:07.960]  Mexicans, the end of the world. You can't have Trump. But when people fight back and say, wow,
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:13.320]  this is rigged. Oh, how dare you. And it's your fault. You got firebombed. Next level brainwashing
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:19.160]  Roger Stone. Yeah, look, they don't even pretend to adhere to the journalistic rules.
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:27.160]  So CNN, Fox, most of the networks carried the attack on me by the Clintonites,
[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:34.840]  first by Podesta, then by the school morale. But it was only NBC who came to me for comment.
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:41.480]  And to their credit, they posted it and gave me equal time. These are no longer news organizations.
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:49.000]  These are propaganda arms of the Clinton campaign. And they will make up any lie or suppress
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:56.760]  any information necessary to try to elect this gravely ill woman whose criminality is oozing
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:49:00.440]  out of all these WikiLeaks. Exactly. Next point, let me ask you this then.
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:04.440]  Last time you had a little bit of the inside scoop on what you thought was coming of the debate you
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:10.200]  were dead on with not shaking the hands with him going on the attack. I know we don't want to tip
[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:15.880]  our hand right now, but I mean, my gut tells me Trump needs to now devastate. He needs to go next
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:20.600]  level, be calm and focused, ignore whatever they say, and just devastate her on the tainted blood
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:26.920]  out of Arkansas, on the Haiti situation, on her abusive women, just devastate her.
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:35.000]  I totally agree. I think it's now time for the scorched earth. She has to be exposed as the
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:42.600]  wanton, vicious criminal that she is. And the tactics of her campaign are leaking through to
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:48.520]  the American people through the WikiLeaks. There will be more major revelations about the criminal
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:56.440]  actions of media matters for America and the money laundering felon David Brock later this week
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:01.240]  that will blow your mind. Now, when you say felon, because you told me about this off air,
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:06.600]  I know if you wanted to go there yet, I mean, is it okay to start getting into the things?
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:11.720]  Well, look, I don't have any problem with that. I'm over speaking. He's a non convicted felon.
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:16.680]  The money laundering he's involved in is a felony. If anyone on the right did it,
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:19.880]  if anyone associated with Trump did it, the federal.
[02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:23.240]  Just like the WikiLeaks show when Hillary is saying this is illegal, she goes screw it,
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:26.520]  just take the money. Sorry, but you're saying to you it looks like money laundering.
[02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:32.120]  Well, there's a terrific series of articles. There's been a detailed complaint file with
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:37.480]  the federal election commission. He's mixing nonprofit money with hard federal election
[02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:43.240]  dollars. That's money laundering. It's highly illegal. And as I say, if I did it or you did
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:47.320]  it, we'd be prospering. Sure. But I meant the other thing you told me. That's not time for that yet.
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:52.440]  No, I'd let that, I'd let that play out here a little bit. I don't want to step on other story,
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:58.360]  but you know, there are some major, even larger revelations coming about personality.
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:25.880]  Well, what happens with the formula
[02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:31.000]  heart and body extract is just giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids,

[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:38.840]  Change has come to America. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage,
[02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:46.600]  and beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government. Star in Alex Jones,
[02:53:46.600 --> 02:53:52.760]  Charlie Daniels, General Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand. DVDs now available.
[02:53:52.760 --> 02:53:59.480]  Ornish heads and tears over the red, white, and blue. Revelation, the movie..info. Let's fix it.
[02:54:10.760 --> 02:54:14.280]  I was talking to Roger Stoner in the break and he was saying, no, he's still ahead in most of
[02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:17.480]  the battleground states, but he might be a little bit behind because of all the demonization, the
[02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:23.960]  full court press. And he went on to just say, is the media claiming this hoax that he's done,
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:28.200]  it's over. The hoax, he's done, it's over. Imagine if they said Hillary's been caught lying in the
[02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:33.240]  emails. It confirms felonies. It confirms that she lied to Congress. It's over. It is over.
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:38.200]  I mean, we have her. It's not like women from 10, 15, 20 years ago saying he touched her leg on an
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:45.160]  airplane or an elevator. And you got emails from him this year saying, please come see me. It's
[02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:50.840]  real meat and potatoes. It's bonafides. And so regardless of where this goes,
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:57.240]  the mainstream media has destroyed itself and we're entering a new era. And Trump is basically,
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:02.280]  whether he wins or loses, a tombstone on this establishment, the Bush Clinton dynasty. There's
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:06.600]  no way she gets on all sick with all this criminality coming out. And she's going to try to take down
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:12.280]  the press and stuff. I just see disaster. But they might start a war before then. Top Russian
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:17.080]  ministers believe that the October surprise concurring with my analysis is a war with Russia.
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:22.440]  Roger Stone, what do you think? We're in a tunnel now. It's okay. You're in a tunnel now. Can you
[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:27.080]  hear me? Yes, I can. So I mean, do you think war with Russia or this big cyber attack
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:33.240]  to elicit a response by Russia could be the October surprise? Yeah, it's wag the dog. We are
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:40.840]  going out to provoke the Russians to provide an excuse, a pretext for war, so that we can try to
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:47.400]  justify Hillary's election. This is one of the most transparent gambits I've ever seen. I was
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:55.240]  about to say very one on one. Yes. So what do we do about that? I mean, there's got to be some
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:56:01.080]  level of sanity in the government left to stop this. Well, we can start with the fact that
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:06.840]  Donald Trump must raise it tomorrow night's debate. In other words, when they say you're in bed with
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:15.480]  Putin, he needs to say, no, Hillary, you want war. I want daytime. You want to engage the Russians
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:19.720]  over Syria, where we have no inherent... And they're fighting al-Qaeda.
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:24.520]  Exactly. ISIS. And I'd say, what the hell are you doing taking 35 million to give over our uranium
[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:28.120]  to them? I wouldn't do that. You know, you call me a Russian agent because you're one.
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:34.280]  Yeah, no, look, they're asking us in Syria to choose between Hezbollah and ISIS.
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:40.280]  We have no inherent interest here. They will drive us to war to steal this election. Meanwhile,
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:46.680]  this entire meme that is going on in this country, the election's over. It's over. Trump's already
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:52.520]  lost. He can't possibly win. I've been in this business 40 years. I'm looking at the polling.
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:58.120]  There is no place that she has an insurmountable lead. And he still leads in a number of keystones.
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:04.040]  And more where he leaks are coming out daily. But regardless, regardless, the Google number
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:09.000]  showed people aren't concerned about all this made up garbage with women. And I think we should just
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:12.840]  admit we're doing this to make a point. Don't be deceptive. But we should just put out the fake
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:17.560]  meme that Hillary is going to resign and that it's official and we have sources because that's
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:21.880]  what they do. And just keep saying it. And have everyone know it's not true, but just have everyone
[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:26.440]  just start saying it and have a meme war with them. How about how's that sound, Roger? No,
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:32.040]  my understanding is that Axelrod wants her to step down. So well, sure, we can take him saying
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:37.000]  step down from the debate and expand and say, no, it's stepped down total. You want to just go with
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:43.080]  that? How about we just do it? We'll reconnect with him. I want to do five more minutes and
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:50.120]  David Knight, it's a done deal. Okay, so you cut off for a moment. So let's announce so Hillary
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:56.200]  is stepping down, correct? Next week. That's what I hear. It's everywhere. Every major Democrat
[02:57:56.200 --> 02:58:01.320]  I talk up to tells me that Michelle Obama is stepping in for Hillary Clinton because her health
[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:06.360]  condition is so grave and because these disclosures are so damaged. Stay there. Your Skype was
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:10.600]  cutting up. I'm going to come back in 70 seconds, give you the full breaking, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:14.760]  Hillary to step down next week. Michelle Obama stepped in because of grave conditions. You're
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:19.560]  hearing in here, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones with Roger Stone. Hillary is stepping
[02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:23.960]  down. We're going to come back with a big announcement right after this straight away,
[02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:31.320]  ladies and gentlemen. And there's more. Her Kathy O'Brien who says Hillary Clinton raped her as a
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:36.200]  child is going to be coming public as well. The rape victim of Hillary straight ahead. Man,
[02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:41.960]  this is serious. Wow, it's over for Hillary rape victim. A young girl stay with us. Oh my god,
[02:58:41.960 --> 02:58:50.440]  it's over. I'm done. I'm this is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.080 --> 02:58:57.400]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say big for 12. That's two super male brain force prostagart silver
[02:58:57.400 --> 02:59:02.520]  bullet. I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work by info. Thank you, brother. Thank you guys
[02:59:02.520 --> 02:59:08.040]  for putting those out there. I am a relatively short time listener and of course supporter of
[02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:13.480]  your fine, fine products. Welcome to the info war. It's so easy to get these incredible
[02:59:13.480 --> 02:59:18.520]  nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war at the same time. I'm a nine year listener
[02:59:18.520 --> 02:59:24.120]  by all the nutraceuticals after effects. Nice. And I got a question. Have they worked for you?
[02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:28.200]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life. What products are you taking?
[02:59:28.200 --> 02:59:35.240]  Are you taking everything from super male to brain force to winter sun X to even got a little
[02:59:35.240 --> 02:59:40.680]  a DNA force. So when I just bring up everything and I just went to auto bill visit info wars
[02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:45.480]  lives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself. That's info
[02:59:45.480 --> 03:00:11.320]  wars lives.com or call 888-253-3139. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The answer to 1984
[03:00:11.320 --> 03:00:23.160]  is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:39.400]  All right, Roger Stone is our guest. He is traveling right now running as a cell phone. He
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:44.040]  was on Skype. And you know, the mainstream media keeps saying over and over again that Trump is
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:50.200]  resigning. There's been an intervention. He's stepping down. It's all over the same usual
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:55.640]  suspect Republican folks that helped ram through the bipartisan tyranny keep playing the same trick
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:01:00.920]  over and over again. So I have actually heard there's no way Hillary can continue on from a
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:06.520]  secret service, but she's on something she's able to. But the word Roger Stone has got is that it is
[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:11.640]  Michelle Obama who they're intending to put in next week show Hillary Clinton's health problems
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:18.280]  have gotten so bad that sometime next week reportedly she's going to be stepping down.
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:22.200]  So it's very important you get this video once we take it from the live show and post it
[03:01:22.200 --> 03:01:28.120]  says all the Democrats you know. Because again, it's fair to say this because Hillary said nobody
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:35.880]  died at Benghazi, right, Roger? Yeah, I mean, look, this is all this is, you know, this is parody.
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:41.000]  This is using their own tactics against them. They continually say things that aren't true,
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:48.120]  that have no basis. In fact, for example, I'm an agent for the Russians and that I that I had
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:54.120]  advanced knowledge of any WikiLeaks hackings, which I didn't, only because back in August,
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:59.880]  I posted on Twitter that John Podesta's business dealings are going to be examined. I didn't
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:04.920]  hear that from WikiLeaks. I heard it from Paul Manafort and he knew because he was active in
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:11.640]  the region at the same time only he was working for pro-democratic force in any event. Yeah,
[03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:17.560]  I hear I hear that Democrats realize that Senator Tim Kaine is mentally unbalanced.
[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:23.080]  They don't want him to step in and therefore the party chiefs led by the president,
[03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:28.200]  they want Michelle Obama. That's what I hear. Every Democrat I know in New York City talking
[03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:32.040]  about this. I kind of think that would be better. I think Michelle would be better than Hillary.
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:36.120]  She doesn't seem to be as hateful or mentally ill. What do you think? Well, she's certainly
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:43.480]  better looking. That's for sure. Wow. Well, this is incredible. Do we have any word on when Hillary
[03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:50.840]  is stepping down? Yeah. Look, this could happen any instant. This is as realistically as Trump
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:55.960]  throwing in the towel. I'm sure you read only weeks ago that he was going to be dropping out
[03:02:55.960 --> 03:03:02.120]  after the sneak attack by NBC in this billy Bush day. I spoke to him. He never thought about
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:07.080]  dropping out. Sure. Well, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated to quote Mark Twain,
[03:03:07.080 --> 03:03:12.120]  but getting serious, what does it mean when Axelrod literally did say that she should drop out of
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:17.400]  the debate claiming because he's been rude to her or whatever? No, no, no. He knows she got her
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:23.800]  cat cleaned. Well, Axelrod is a very crude fellow and he's a very competent democratic operative.
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:29.400]  I think he understands how damaged she is as a candidate. Plus, as you know, there is no
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:35.320]  love between the Obama's and the Clinton's. That has not changed. But if they can be
[03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:41.640]  ridiculous and sarcastic, we can be ridiculous and sarcastic. I think it's a superb way to
[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:49.480]  illustrate the point. I'm speaking tonight at the Cosmopolitan Club for the Dear Point Forum,
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:55.560]  a conservative oriented discussion group, who I'll be signing books. I think I'll go there and
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:03:59.640]  announce it's seven o'clock tonight in Manhattan. It's the Cosmopolitan Club that
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:04.440]  Hillary's dropping out. She's going to be replaced by Michelle Obama. Yeah, I'm going to put a special
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:08.360]  video report out on this right now and I'm just going to go with it. And you know, they now are
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:14.280]  doing whole body transplants, brain into a new body. Matt Drudge joked about her in a jar.
[03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:20.040]  Why not just say she's going to drop out for health reasons and have a whole body transplant next week?
[03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:26.600]  Anything's possible. Absolutely. Why not be like CNN and MSNBC? You know, the truth is we're
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:30.760]  illustrating them by being absurd. We don't literally mean this, but we're going to do it as satire.
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:35.320]  Roger Stone, thank you so much. Look forward to speaking to you again. 21 days left, my friend.
[03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:42.680]  Great to be with you, Alex, as always. All right, I'm going to come back. Rob Dew is bristling to get
[03:04:42.680 --> 03:04:46.920]  on air. He's got a bunch of clips he was telling me he wants to get to special reports and more.
[03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:52.760]  We haven't covered fourth hour straight ahead, but I will hand the old baton to Rob Dew, our news
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:05:02.680]  director, straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones. This is the info war. The Clinton Foundation has quite
[03:05:02.680 --> 03:05:07.720]  a nasty legacy in the nation of Columbia. Despite Hillary saying that she's very proud of the
[03:05:07.720 --> 03:05:14.120]  foundation's work, many of its quote beneficiaries in Columbia are wondering why. Now, the non-profit
[03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:19.320]  global philanthropic empire has raised nearly two billion from foreign governments and various
[03:05:19.320 --> 03:05:23.960]  wealthy private donors all in an effort to tackle global development and health problems.
[03:05:23.960 --> 03:05:27.800]  Well, much attention now is being dedicated to what it's doing on the ground because of the
[03:05:27.800 --> 03:05:32.760]  disclosures from WikiLeaks. We know that Columbia is ground zero for drug wars and has been since
[03:05:32.760 --> 03:05:38.440]  the early 80s. It's plagued with uneven development and low intensity conflict. We also know, ironically,
[03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:43.720]  that Columbia has been the home to a vast oil and natural gas holding of a man who's reportedly the
[03:05:43.720 --> 03:05:49.080]  foundation's largest individual donor, Canadian financier, Frank Gustra. In other words, global
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:53.960]  development includes a pay to play for wealthy Clinton Foundation donors while exploiting poverty
[03:05:53.960 --> 03:05:59.400]  and extracting money. That's what it's looking like. I'm Margaret Hall reporting for info wars.com.
[03:06:24.920 --> 03:06:30.600]  And best of all, it's free to download at info wars.com. The app is brand new. This is the first
[03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:35.160]  release and it was completely built from the ground up. We've seen example after example of
[03:06:35.160 --> 03:06:39.640]  cable news networks attempting to deceive you. In short, the major media is being covertly manipulated
[03:06:39.640 --> 03:06:44.200]  by well financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that
[03:06:44.200 --> 03:06:49.400]  only serves establishment agendas. But info wars live is the solution to the controlled press that
[03:06:49.400 --> 03:06:55.560]  is rapidly losing influence. So download info wars live today at info wars.com and learn what's
[03:06:55.560 --> 03:07:19.560]  really going on instead of being spoon fed lies by the mainstream media.

[03:07:33.800 --> 03:07:39.800]  government. We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more to it than that. Starring Alex Jones,

[03:07:53.640 --> 03:08:00.040]  Americans need to see this film. Revelation the movie dot info. Let's fix it.
[03:08:03.400 --> 03:08:08.920]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak. We think just let me say even now orders
[03:08:08.920 --> 03:08:13.480]  are being charged into telephones and men with guns supposed to be on their way. It's chance of
[03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:19.080]  settlement. Damn it. Why? Because while the traction may be used in lieu of conversation,
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:26.440]  words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen,
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:33.480]  the enunciation of the truth. There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't that?
[03:08:33.480 --> 03:08:38.120]  You decided sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television in longer. Cruelty and
[03:08:38.120 --> 03:08:43.080]  injustice, intolerance and depression. And where once you have the freedom to object and
[03:08:43.080 --> 03:08:48.280]  think and speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing
[03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:54.120]  your conformity and selecting your submachine cameras. How did this happen? Who's to blame?
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:09:00.040]  Certainly there are those who are more responsible than others. They will be held accountable.
[03:09:00.040 --> 03:09:05.640]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[03:09:06.680 --> 03:09:13.480]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror and disease.
[03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:19.640]  There were a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common
[03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:25.320]  sense. Fear got the best of you and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor,
[03:09:25.320 --> 03:09:31.400]  Adam Sutler. He promised you order. He promised you peace. And all he demanded in return was your
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:44.280]  silent, obedient consent. There is a war. There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the
[03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:52.360]  fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the info war.
[03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:57.800]  And we are now 21 days out from this incredibly important historical election.
[03:09:57.800 --> 03:10:04.360]  Abdul is going to be taking over here in just a few minutes. And I realize that I get in here
[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:11.240]  like a rabid Chihuahua getting wound up before I come on the air. And I do a decent job, but
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:20.040]  I've become almost like just a barking rabid, angry person because this is so real. I mean,
[03:10:20.040 --> 03:10:23.720]  the globalists are so evil. We have their own emails admitting it. We already knew it.
[03:10:23.720 --> 03:10:30.440]  But this just all confirms it. And they're real villains. They sit around talking about
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:35.880]  screwing over poor people and how they're bad. When you study criminology,
[03:10:36.920 --> 03:10:43.160]  that's what real mentally ill criminals do. Not just criminals because they were pressured into
[03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:48.760]  it or criminals because they were starving and stole a loaf of bread. I mean, real criminal mindsets
[03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:58.840]  that hate people. And they see people like us that have conscience, that care.
[03:11:01.400 --> 03:11:06.680]  They see us as weak. You know, I'm not weak because I have nerve endings and can't,
[03:11:06.680 --> 03:11:08.920]  you know, stick my hand in the fire and just keep it there without pain.
[03:11:09.720 --> 03:11:16.040]  Those are there so that I can navigate the world better. And I'll be honest with you,
[03:11:16.040 --> 03:11:22.680]  I see the general public stunted, mutated, dumbed down, unhealthy, ugly on average,
[03:11:22.680 --> 03:11:26.920]  really stuff falling apart fast. Every metric shows that it's not just my jaundice eye.
[03:11:27.960 --> 03:11:31.400]  And then I see the establishment and they're even worse,
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:37.080]  like a bird on top of Dunghill,
[03:11:37.080 --> 03:11:44.520]  surveying its largesse and it really freaks me out.
[03:11:47.960 --> 03:11:52.440]  And I think about being a man in the arena. I know I ask this all the time,
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:57.320]  you guys reprint me man in the arena. Thanks. Great crew. And I think about
[03:11:57.320 --> 03:12:09.480]  how to see Trump even in the arena more than I am losing so much growing as he learns,
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:15.800]  legitimately not out to get us and just being hit with every lie, every deception,
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:20.760]  every twisted piece of info. And I just hope humanity breaks the spell.
[03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:27.160]  I hope humanity has already hit bottom and we start coming back up and then we wake up
[03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:31.080]  that communism and totalitarianism doesn't work. Thank you, Nico.
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:39.640]  Because I generally have faith in humanity, but sometimes I really wonder
[03:12:42.120 --> 03:12:47.160]  because people that are followers and weak-minded, they get into groupthink and they think because
[03:12:47.160 --> 03:12:52.840]  they're agreeing with what most people are saying that somehow that makes them powerful and effective.
[03:12:53.720 --> 03:12:55.480]  No, if you're in a sick and dying culture
[03:12:59.080 --> 03:13:05.480]  and then you're going along with the general consensus, you're a fool. I mean, it's one thing
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:09.800]  if you're in Nazi Germany in 1942 and you don't know which way the war is going to go
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:14.120]  and half your family's in the military and you know Hitler's bad, you didn't like him to begin with,
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:17.160]  but if you cross them, they're going to put you in a forced labor camp.
[03:13:17.160 --> 03:13:23.400]  It's one thing to kind of do your job and keep your head down. That's cowardly, but I get it.
[03:13:26.520 --> 03:13:31.960]  But now, and by the way, most Germans by 1941 or 42 did not like what was going on. They've done
[03:13:31.960 --> 03:13:37.480]  the interviews, they've checked the metrics, but they went along with it. And more than a third of
[03:13:37.480 --> 03:13:45.480]  them died. More than a third of Germany died. 20% of Russia died. I just bring those numbers up
[03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:50.360]  because when General Milley, the head of the army says, this war is going to be as big as World War
[03:13:50.360 --> 03:13:54.280]  II. We've not seen anything like this since World War II. Du's going to air the special report at
[03:13:54.280 --> 03:14:01.800]  the bottom of the hour. I study history. I studied the military. I find it interesting.
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:09.400]  They don't talk like that, folks, unless you're about to be in a giant war. And then I look,
[03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:16.040]  who's captaining this war, an old, sick, evil, crime boss woman who has to have secret service
[03:14:16.040 --> 03:14:23.400]  go, it's okay. It's okay. Keep talking. She's like, oh, oh, yeah. That's who they got.
[03:14:23.400 --> 03:14:31.480]  And then all of these weird effeminate, I'm going to call them effeminate because insults women,
[03:14:31.480 --> 03:14:35.480]  women aren't like that. Weird clown men. I don't care if they're gay or heterosexual.
[03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:41.320]  There's just this Nelly giggling about evil. Everything's funny. Let's screw everyone over.
[03:14:42.040 --> 03:14:48.440]  It's just like, whoa, I don't want to be around you. I mean, I would never associate with you.
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:52.360]  Now you're running my life. And I'm not saying I wouldn't associate with a guy who was
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:55.880]  acted like a Nelly. There's plenty of guys like that that are great, hardworking, good people.
[03:14:55.880 --> 03:15:02.360]  I mean, there's just this certain type of wimpy guy who I guess wants to do evil because it makes
[03:15:02.360 --> 03:15:07.960]  them feel powerful. And all I want to do is club their brains out. I love to get in a pen,
[03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:11.960]  legally and lawfully, like four of these wimps throw clubs down on the ground. I got a club and I'm
[03:15:11.960 --> 03:15:15.800]  like, you know what, let's find out how big a man you are right now. You want to screw somebody
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:22.280]  over, you like to get up on people, do it to me. And I'll just be honest. I mean, as a man, that's
[03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:28.440]  how I feel towards these people, bunch of hyenas laughing, screwing people over. I'm tired of them.
[03:15:30.920 --> 03:15:37.080]  And I get really upset when it looks like Trump's going to lose. The internal polls are, he's way
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:15:41.400]  ahead, but they know the fix is in. Trump's got to be way ahead. Just like Enrich said,
[03:15:41.400 --> 03:15:46.440]  that's the inside baseball. He's got to be way ahead to win because they're going to steal it,
[03:15:46.440 --> 03:15:48.760]  folks. Only a landslide can beat him. And Trump said that.
[03:15:53.080 --> 03:15:56.040]  You know, I'm not like one of these, and I don't talk about myself, because I don't talk about
[03:15:56.040 --> 03:15:59.880]  myself. It's just, it's an allegory of everything, especially for media matters and the White House
[03:15:59.880 --> 03:16:04.280]  people that listen and the Hillary people that analyze her word. I'm saying, I understand you'd
[03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:08.200]  be fired to men if you didn't play ball, but you know the stuff about her having convulsions is real.
[03:16:08.200 --> 03:16:12.760]  You know how evil she is, is real. You know her working for foreign powers is real. You think
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:17.880]  you're just cozyed up to something powerful because it'll get you ahead in life. These are the times
[03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:23.080]  when you've got to make the right decision and leak information. Who needs to have it leaked
[03:16:23.080 --> 03:16:26.920]  via the internet? There's other ways to get information out. Do what's right.
[03:16:28.200 --> 03:16:30.600]  Don't believe your own hype. Don't smoke your own dough.
[03:16:30.600 --> 03:16:36.280]  Hillary really is evil.
[03:16:39.880 --> 03:16:43.480]  In the short and midterm, if I want to be more successful, personally,
[03:16:44.600 --> 03:16:48.360]  I would want Hillary to get in. But I don't think like that.
[03:16:49.880 --> 03:16:55.160]  Donald Trump gets in, our fight's just begun, and we've got to really hold his feet to the fire
[03:16:55.160 --> 03:16:58.360]  and fight the special interest, and they're already getting ready to implode the economy.
[03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:03.640]  They're going to blame us. I mean, shining onto Trump, I put on all the risk. I did everything
[03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:09.000]  because I believed. My gut told me he was real. You're seeing he's real, works and all, and this
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:15.880]  is a really historical time to be alive right now. If I was like everybody else, I'd just sit on the
[03:17:15.880 --> 03:17:23.000]  fence and bash both candidates and act like I was holier than now, or I'd go further and be like
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:26.360]  Glenn Beck and, you know, come out for Hillary because they've said they're shutting the media
[03:17:26.360 --> 03:17:30.680]  down the next year or so. So that's kind of the catch-22. Yeah, we'll get a bigger audience of
[03:17:30.680 --> 03:17:35.320]  Hillary gets in, but she's coming after the media. And listen, at a subconscious level,
[03:17:35.320 --> 03:17:39.320]  I kind of fantasize about that because America kind of deserves whatever it gets at this point,
[03:17:39.320 --> 03:17:43.800]  all of us. The other 50 million abortions are 55 million and all the corruption and the human
[03:17:43.800 --> 03:17:48.600]  animal chimeras and all the wars and backing all kinds of murder, Christians everywhere.
[03:17:48.600 --> 03:17:51.800]  I mean, America wants to go along with this. Well, we should taste a little bit of it.
[03:17:51.800 --> 03:17:56.920]  Except I realize there's still so many good people that have been awake, they don't deserve it.
[03:17:59.240 --> 03:18:02.120]  Another sick part of me, kind of, you know, Hillary wants to shut the media down,
[03:18:02.120 --> 03:18:06.120]  I'll fight the good fight, try to stop it, but okay, man, I've run the race. I've done it. I've,
[03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:11.400]  all the proofs there, all the facts are out. World government, tyrannical, anti-human,
[03:18:11.400 --> 03:18:16.200]  if you don't care and if you don't get involved, then this is on you.
[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:24.200]  This is something that we deserve. And so I'm making peace with that.
[03:18:28.440 --> 03:18:32.760]  I just know this. Trump's a fighting chance and he's a sign of nationalism.
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:36.280]  But you know what? We might be too far gone, folks.
[03:18:36.280 --> 03:18:47.160]  And America has just been an idea. It's had all its big problems, but it was better than
[03:18:47.160 --> 03:18:50.840]  other countries because for a little short time it had more freedom than other countries.
[03:18:51.720 --> 03:18:53.960]  And that's why the social engineers, I'm going to skip this break,
[03:18:53.960 --> 03:18:58.680]  have spent all their time trying to tear down that idea because they can't compete with real
[03:18:58.680 --> 03:19:04.040]  liberalism and free open society and free association. They can't deal with the liberalism
[03:19:04.040 --> 03:19:12.520]  that came out of the Renaissance in England and that Europe banned slavery and that Europe
[03:19:12.520 --> 03:19:18.520]  led the world in technology and that Christianity was at the heart of that with common law.
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:24.120]  The elite of the world don't want English common law
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:31.720]  and Renaissance, but also some of the better older Judaic teachings, not the more modern ones,
[03:19:31.720 --> 03:19:35.080]  not the Babylonian Talmud, but the older ones. And that is a big influence. People say,
[03:19:35.080 --> 03:19:39.480]  I don't want to hear Judeo-Christian values. That's a bunch of, you know, brainwashing,
[03:19:39.480 --> 03:19:42.120]  by the way. I mean, that is part of our culture. Just get that straight.
[03:19:43.960 --> 03:19:46.520]  There are a lot of elites that don't want to say everybody's human
[03:19:47.320 --> 03:19:51.240]  and then raise them to that level. There are a lot of elites that don't want
[03:19:51.240 --> 03:19:54.680]  that technology to be deployed to the people, cultural technology.
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:20:00.280]  They really think you can set up on the hill over a slum and be better than those people.
[03:20:00.280 --> 03:20:04.840]  All you've done is brought yourself down a level. I bring you up three levels. I bring myself up
[03:20:04.840 --> 03:20:10.760]  even more. Quite frankly, I figured this out of a spiritual level. I'm almost,
[03:20:11.640 --> 03:20:16.440]  I'm greedy and arrogant when it comes to the fact that I'm going to be noble.
[03:20:17.960 --> 03:20:24.280]  I mean, it is almost a peacocking thing that I don't lie. I don't cheat. I don't get off on
[03:20:24.280 --> 03:20:30.360]  screwing people over. I don't get off on victory over my enemies. I get off on separating them
[03:20:30.360 --> 03:20:35.800]  from their quarry, but I don't get off on watching them fall into piles of garbage.
[03:20:36.760 --> 03:20:38.360]  And again, I talk about myself because
[03:20:40.280 --> 03:20:44.280]  this is a model of success against the enemy. This is what they fear. For all our problems
[03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:50.600]  and info wars, we're real. We care about freedom. We care about everybody. We want to promote real
[03:20:50.600 --> 03:20:57.240]  justice. And they're a bunch of nasty people that are using very old technologies of control in both
[03:20:57.240 --> 03:21:06.440]  parties to overthrow and dominate and annihilate society. And
[03:21:12.200 --> 03:21:15.240]  there's a lot of positive things, but the thing that really upsets me the most
[03:21:15.240 --> 03:21:27.080]  is watching what's left of the MSM line up like organized soldiers and commit crimes
[03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:32.040]  against freedom in this country, crimes against journalism, crimes against individuals, crimes
[03:21:32.040 --> 03:21:39.080]  against property, crimes against humanity. People always overuse the Nazi analogies,
[03:21:39.080 --> 03:21:42.360]  but the Nazis followed orders. The trains were on time. People did what they were told.
[03:21:42.360 --> 03:21:48.600]  That's why it was a very hard enemy to fight. And I got to say, for our media, our MSM,
[03:21:50.840 --> 03:21:57.480]  Fox to a great extent is added to that now. They show German military precision in attacking the
[03:21:57.480 --> 03:22:08.680]  American people and an engaging interception. Both the Germans, it was more mechanical.
[03:22:08.680 --> 03:22:17.880]  There's an added like glee to it. And the Germans had some of that same glee, but there's a glee to
[03:22:17.880 --> 03:22:27.000]  this, like a ceremonial sacrifice of America. And then they waddle around and roll around in
[03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:35.240]  the blood of the country that suckled them and then just celebrate publicly. It's very
[03:22:35.240 --> 03:22:41.720]  infantile. And that's the thing. It's organized. It's criminal. It's focused.
[03:22:42.680 --> 03:22:48.120]  But then it's just totally given over to dishonor. I mean, I think about
[03:22:50.120 --> 03:22:56.360]  just second nature being an honorable person. That mean I'm perfect. And then I look at these
[03:22:56.360 --> 03:23:02.200]  people and I realize they're so divorced from the human species. They have no idea that the
[03:23:02.200 --> 03:23:08.280]  greatest value in their life is actually finding people you can trust. There's no honor amongst
[03:23:08.280 --> 03:23:11.320]  these people. They're totally unhappy. They treat each other like crap. It's all admitted.
[03:23:11.320 --> 03:23:15.880]  They're absolutely alone. They have the highest rates of suicide, the lowest rates of giving.
[03:23:16.840 --> 03:23:22.920]  They are just the scared, twisted pseudo intellectuals that try to organize themselves
[03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:29.720]  into criminal groups to then go out and commit crime while spewing propaganda about how good
[03:23:29.720 --> 03:23:43.000]  they are all day. Imagine if your political God was Hillary Clinton. I mean, what does that
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:50.760]  say about these people? And they go, oh, look at Trump, a womanizer with orange hair. He never
[03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:58.600]  said he didn't like women. If he had said he was Mr. Perfect and then got caught doing something,
[03:23:58.600 --> 03:24:06.680]  I'd be concerned. He never even pretended. He said stuff that's so truthful and won't BS people
[03:24:06.680 --> 03:24:09.720]  when the politicians are telling him to. That's what they can't stand. That's why they're scared,
[03:24:09.720 --> 03:24:13.080]  folks. He's going to get in there and learn about everything that's happening. And then the only
[03:24:13.080 --> 03:24:17.480]  danger is fascism because he's going to want and we're going to want to arrest so many of these
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:25.000]  people. They have to get trials and it can't get out of hand. But I'll tell you, you steal
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:33.480]  $2 billion for people starving. You need to really, really pay severely for thousands of dead
[03:24:33.480 --> 03:24:39.480]  people over 10,000 alone just from one operation. You fund Al Qaeda to take over and then rename
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:43.240]  it ISIS and they kill hundreds of thousands of people and engage in crimes that are just unspeakable.
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:52.760]  You need to pay for that. You launched these illegal wars. You kill a million Iraqis with
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:57.400]  sanctions. You need to pay for it. And that's why the Republicans are fighting so hard because
[03:24:57.400 --> 03:25:02.840]  they're just as bad as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and all the rest of them. They know,
[03:25:02.840 --> 03:25:06.920]  and they know Trump has never been part of any of it. Trump was against NAFTA and GATT. Trump was
[03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:17.720]  against the Iraq war. I've analyzed Trump. Trump has a sense of justice and he thinks he's the
[03:25:17.720 --> 03:25:23.320]  underdog because quite frankly, he comes from blue collar roots and he's all about people not beating
[03:25:23.320 --> 03:25:32.520]  him. And he ties into the whole Americana idea of taking down the establishment and of not having
[03:25:32.520 --> 03:25:37.000]  a bunch of pomp and circumstance. He only uses pomp and circumstances marketing because he knows
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:43.400]  that's what the public wants. Donald Trump can't stand it. Those are the big Donald Trump secrets.
[03:25:43.400 --> 03:25:53.000]  And the enemy knows that and he wants to be the superstar. What leader isn't narcissistic to that
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:58.840]  level who breaks the new world order, who smashes it. He absolutely admires Nigel Farage.
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:10.680]  His body language, the Farage is worshipful. Trump wants to be part of history. Trump wants
[03:26:10.680 --> 03:26:16.440]  to be on the good guy's team. Trump spent his whole life around those demonic, skexie New York
[03:26:16.440 --> 03:26:23.960]  globalist. He doesn't want to be with them. He wants to be with you. He can easily shoot his
[03:26:23.960 --> 03:26:28.440]  mouth off about Russia. Shut all that down. He knows Russia's done nothing to us. He won't sit
[03:26:28.440 --> 03:26:37.960]  there and trade his credibility. Oh, he's enamored with Putin. Yeah, Putin kicked the new world order
[03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:45.000]  out. Nigel Farage is starting to do it. We're doing it. That's history. That's good. That's
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:51.240]  honorable. That's what we should all want. I want to see Mexico kick the globalist out. I want
[03:26:51.240 --> 03:26:56.280]  Mexico to be filthy rich, beautiful country. I wish it was better than US. I'd move down there.
[03:26:57.400 --> 03:27:01.000]  I want to run away from slums and poverty and crime and death, not brown people.
[03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:06.280]  I want Africa to be wealthy. Eastern Europe to be wealthy. Russia to be successful. I want
[03:27:06.280 --> 03:27:12.120]  humanity to thrive. So does Donald Trump. We want renaissance. We want prosperity. I want you to be
[03:27:12.120 --> 03:27:17.080]  successful. I want to see you successful. Hillary Clinton wants you poor because she wants to look
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:26.200]  down on you. America is about prosperity for everybody. And it's an idea that nobody can stop
[03:27:26.200 --> 03:27:29.080]  if you simply take it in your hands and kick these parasites out.
[03:27:29.080 --> 03:27:36.760]  These parasites come in every race, color, and creed and every spot, but they all got the same
[03:27:36.760 --> 03:27:43.480]  spirit and same soul and they're pissed to see you successful. And to them, Donald Trump is a
[03:27:43.480 --> 03:27:48.680]  nightmare, a nightmare monster. All right, we're going to throw the break, bring Rob doing. He's
[03:27:48.680 --> 03:27:54.040]  got reports to get to and a lot more here today. Rod and shotgun with us. Briefly,
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:27:57.560]  because I didn't plug in the last hour and that's how we found the operation.
[03:27:57.560 --> 03:28:03.800]  And we've got a bunch of specials running right now. 25% off. Brain force, the amazing
[03:28:03.800 --> 03:28:09.160]  Neutropic should be 50, 60 bucks. It's $22 right now. Amazing. They'll try it out today.
[03:28:09.160 --> 03:28:13.240]  Hillary for prisons being sold at costs. It's the end of the run. They're almost sold out,
[03:28:13.240 --> 03:28:19.720]  $9.95. We also are selling Hillary for prison bumper stickers at cost, $117. And we're
[03:28:19.720 --> 03:28:23.400]  extending for one day. We're extending this for a week. They just started the brain force.
[03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:29.240]  We're going to extend the sleep aid knockout, which again, I'll explain.
[03:28:30.120 --> 03:28:37.160]  Normal melatonin of the same dose is $15 to $19 for the same quality. Ours is $19 and has eight
[03:28:37.160 --> 03:28:42.440]  other ingredients like valerian root, L-trip to fan, you name it. So it's a huge discount.
[03:28:42.440 --> 03:28:45.640]  Okay. It'd be like 50, 60 bucks to get all of these together at the same dose,
[03:28:45.640 --> 03:28:49.720]  but with different bottles. That's why it's a great deal. Knockout tried today.
[03:28:49.720 --> 03:28:57.800]  Okay. A 25% off and by the way, knockout has a 25% off as well, but that is $14.95. Brain
[03:28:57.800 --> 03:29:03.960]  force is what? 22 bucks right now. It'd be a good price at 50 bucks. Again, we normally only
[03:29:03.960 --> 03:29:11.240]  mark it up 100%. It's only marked up 50% right now. That's what we do. We mark them up 100%.
[03:29:11.240 --> 03:29:16.760]  We have biome defense out right now. Great. And two different strengths. A great probiotic.

[03:29:32.840 --> 03:29:36.680]  Not only news tonight, seven o'clock central, now it's shown signing off. We'll follow some
[03:29:36.680 --> 03:29:41.400]  reports. Rob Dew is coming out of the gates straight ahead. Please spread the word. They
[03:29:41.400 --> 03:29:45.480]  want to shut this down for a reason. Don't take it for granted. Hit the free app at infowars.com
[03:29:45.480 --> 03:29:57.080]  for a flash up. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:01.240 --> 03:30:06.520]  The bank accounts of RT News in the UK have been frozen. Nat West Bank froze the Russian
[03:30:06.520 --> 03:30:11.240]  broadcasters accounts according to the editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan who tweeted,
[03:30:11.240 --> 03:30:16.040]  they've closed our accounts in Britain. All our accounts. The decision is not subject to review.
[03:30:16.040 --> 03:30:21.160]  Now RT says the bank gave no explanation for the decision. Nat West is an arm of the Royal Bank
[03:30:21.160 --> 03:30:26.120]  of Scotland and it's refusing to service the broadcaster. Nat West Bank wrote, quote, we've
[03:30:26.120 --> 03:30:30.440]  recently undertaken a review of our banking arrangements with you and reached the conclusion
[03:30:30.440 --> 03:30:34.680]  that we will no longer provide these facilities. The bank said its decision was final and they're
[03:30:34.680 --> 03:30:39.160]  not prepared to enter into any discussion. Here in the States, the president is threatening a
[03:30:39.160 --> 03:30:44.040]  cyber war with Russia, which could escalate quickly into a nuclear one, all in an attempt to keep
[03:30:44.040 --> 03:30:49.640]  Hillary's deleted emails a secret. In the US, the CIA leaked to NBC News that the president
[03:30:49.640 --> 03:30:54.520]  has requested options for a cyber attack on Russia. Regulator Ofcom said its quote for
[03:30:54.520 --> 03:31:09.720]  biased reporting. You decide. I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowars.com. Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America. He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[03:31:09.720 --> 03:31:15.080]  Let me just read a little thing here from agenda 21. The American system of justice must be changed to
[03:31:15.080 --> 03:31:20.600]  conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[03:31:20.600 --> 03:31:24.200]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to be coming after you're done.
[03:31:24.200 --> 03:31:30.120]  Oh, yeah. I take it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all. It ain't gonna sit well. Do you ever wonder
[03:31:30.120 --> 03:31:35.800]  what happened to America? It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reveres. When I was a boy,
[03:31:35.800 --> 03:31:42.520]  it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, and beef was for supper.
[03:31:43.160 --> 03:31:49.160]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available,
[03:31:49.160 --> 03:31:55.400]  starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general Jerry Boykin, wanna shed some tears
[03:31:55.400 --> 03:32:01.400]  over the red, white and blue? Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it. Hey, everyone.
[03:32:01.400 --> 03:32:05.800]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help
[03:32:05.800 --> 03:32:10.680]  Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking statistics. Despite spending trillions
[03:32:10.680 --> 03:32:16.600]  of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes,
[03:32:16.600 --> 03:32:21.240]  cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is
[03:32:21.240 --> 03:32:25.560]  dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative
[03:32:25.560 --> 03:32:29.320]  disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your
[03:32:29.320 --> 03:32:33.640]  vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional
[03:32:33.640 --> 03:32:38.360]  raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental

[03:33:14.040 --> 03:33:21.080]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do
[03:33:21.080 --> 03:33:28.440]  nothing. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We now take you live
[03:33:28.440 --> 03:33:32.600]  to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:36.120 --> 03:33:41.400]  Hi, Rob Dew here with the fourth hour of Overdrive here at infowarsteam.com. If you're
[03:33:41.400 --> 03:33:45.480]  listening to this on the radio and you'd like to watch what's going on, we're about to throw to a
[03:33:45.480 --> 03:33:50.680]  pretty fantastic video that Alex produced over the weekend, talking about a story that is getting
[03:33:50.680 --> 03:33:55.800]  zero coverage in the mainstream media here in the United States. They'd rather spoon feed you issues
[03:33:55.800 --> 03:33:58.920]  about what Donald Trump said or who you might have touched or who you might have kissed,
[03:33:58.920 --> 03:34:03.640]  but not about the upcoming World War III that looks like it's impending at this point. I want
[03:34:03.640 --> 03:34:09.320]  to go to a couple articles before we go to this amazing video that Alex produced over the weekend.
[03:34:09.320 --> 03:34:13.400]  I shot two videos with Alex on Friday and I thought he was kind of done. He came back on
[03:34:13.400 --> 03:34:20.600]  Saturday, shot more, and then back on Sunday and shot even more. The man is working like a real man.
[03:34:20.600 --> 03:34:25.000]  I'm not going to say like a demon. That's how Hillary works. Here we go from Paul Joseph Watson,
[03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:31.960]  Kremlin insider. War might even begin even before US elections, urges citizens to stockpile cans of
[03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:37.640]  food. And this is Sergei Markov. He's a member of the Civic Chamber, a Moscow-based institution.
[03:34:37.640 --> 03:34:44.280]  So he's buying 200 cans of pork to be ready for a potential crisis right there.
[03:34:44.280 --> 03:34:50.120]  We had some canned bacon here the other day. It was kind of not like the bacon that I eat,
[03:34:50.120 --> 03:34:54.200]  but you know what? If you're in a situation where you're stuck underground for a few weeks,
[03:34:54.200 --> 03:34:59.480]  while the nuclear fallout is overhead, you're going to eat anything you can. And
[03:34:59.480 --> 03:35:03.560]  you have to ask yourself at this point too, are you stockpiled? Do you have storeable food?
[03:35:03.560 --> 03:35:10.440]  Do you have water filters? Do you have potassium iodine to take care of radiation in your thyroid
[03:35:10.440 --> 03:35:14.840]  gland? You gotta think about all these things, especially now. Here's from the Daily Mail.
[03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:19.560]  Turkey warns that World War III is inevitable if the Syrian conflict continues because Americans
[03:35:19.560 --> 03:35:25.160]  and Russia, American Russia will come to a point of war. Well, what do we discuss over the weekend?
[03:35:26.280 --> 03:35:31.480]  That Joe Biden's come out and said we're going to be launching cyber attacks against Russia.
[03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:36.200]  Everybody's talking about how Russia has, Russia's the one who has hacked
[03:35:37.240 --> 03:35:41.160]  the accounts of John Podesta and put that information out to WikiLeaks.
[03:35:41.880 --> 03:35:46.200]  And we've got a Wayne Matson article. And I'm not even going to get into this because he's
[03:35:46.200 --> 03:35:50.760]  going to be interviewed tonight by Liam McAdoo for the nightly news report. UFO hunters,
[03:35:50.760 --> 03:35:58.200]  not Russians, hacked Podesta. And we had a prominent UFO hunter, ended up dead over the
[03:35:58.200 --> 03:36:03.400]  weekend in Poland. And he said investigated or something happened that he put out some cryptic
[03:36:03.960 --> 03:36:08.600]  messages before he died. So is it possible Podesta came out and started talking about his
[03:36:09.240 --> 03:36:13.720]  interest in UFOs. Maybe he was being hacked by these people and then they turned over what they had
[03:36:13.720 --> 03:36:17.880]  to WikiLeaks. I've actually got a couple of recent leaks here that I'm going to read after
[03:36:17.880 --> 03:36:22.920]  this video. So stay tuned for that. But let's go to this video now from Alex Jones talking about
[03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:27.960]  the big story in the world that they're talking about everywhere but the United States. They want
[03:36:27.960 --> 03:36:31.320]  you concerned about Donald Trump's orange hair and who he might have kissed. Here's that report.
[03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:05.160]  Has openly in the last week declared defacto war against Russia.
[03:37:11.400 --> 03:37:17.560]  The United States military will stop you and we will beat you harder than you've ever been
[03:37:17.560 --> 03:37:21.880]  beaten before. Russia is hacked into a lot of things. China is hacked into a lot of things.
[03:37:21.880 --> 03:37:27.320]  Russia even hacked into the Democratic National Committee. We will be ready with serious political,
[03:37:27.320 --> 03:37:33.160]  economic and military responses. The message they said that he'll know it and will be at the
[03:37:33.160 --> 03:37:39.560]  time of our choosing and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact. Right now Senator
[03:37:39.560 --> 03:37:45.880]  for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and
[03:37:45.880 --> 03:37:50.120]  Russia. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS
[03:37:50.120 --> 03:37:56.440]  together as an example. We could slide into nuclear war very quickly from her declared policy
[03:37:56.440 --> 03:38:01.880]  in Syria so I won't sleep well at night if Donald Trump is elected but I sure won't sleep well at
[03:38:01.880 --> 03:38:07.080]  night if Hillary Clinton is elected. Future high-end war between nations dates the great powers very
[03:38:07.080 --> 03:38:13.240]  highly lethal unlike anything our army has experienced at least since world war two.
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:17.960]  So a message is going to be sent. Will the public know it? I hope not.
[03:38:17.960 --> 03:38:29.960]  We're going to get to the de facto declaration of war and the preparations for physical war
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:36.680]  and what the head of the army says will have as high a casualty level as war war two in a moment
[03:38:36.680 --> 03:38:43.160]  but first the background that's undisputed. Russia only has two military bases outside
[03:38:43.160 --> 03:38:47.240]  of its country. It's not expansionist. It's fighting radical Islam around the world
[03:38:47.240 --> 03:38:52.120]  and should be an ally of the United States and many of our top generals and admirals and others
[03:38:52.120 --> 03:38:58.040]  have been on record saying that fact. The threat is radical Islam and China not Russia. I think
[03:38:58.040 --> 03:39:03.000]  it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together as an example.
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:07.560]  The reason the globalists are so upset at Trump is they know he's being advised by the former
[03:39:07.560 --> 03:39:12.760]  head of defense intelligence general Flynn who exposed the fact that Obama and Hillary were
[03:39:12.760 --> 03:39:18.280]  expanding ISIS and al-Qaeda worldwide three years ago. You're basically saying that even in government
[03:39:18.280 --> 03:39:22.680]  at the time you knew those groups were around you saw this analysis and you were arguing against it
[03:39:22.680 --> 03:39:29.400]  but who wasn't listening? I think administration. The administration turned a blind eye to your
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:33.080]  analysis. I don't know if they turned a blind eye. I think it was a decision. I think it was a willful
[03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:37.560]  decision. A willful decision to go supported insurgency that had Salafist al-Qaeda. A willful
[03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:42.680]  decision to do what they're doing. The multinational corporations that brag at the Davos forum
[03:39:42.680 --> 03:39:47.480]  that they've hijacked Europe and the United States and many other western countries are a
[03:39:47.480 --> 03:39:54.040]  multinational outside force basically taking over our nations and colonizing us with their
[03:39:54.040 --> 03:39:59.880]  world government system. So they need to have an outside threat to fool nationalists to give up
[03:39:59.880 --> 03:40:05.880]  their sovereignty to globalism in the name of protecting nationalism. That's why when the UK
[03:40:05.880 --> 03:40:11.880]  pulls out of the unelected dictatorial EU, mainstream media claims the Russians are behind it.
[03:40:11.880 --> 03:40:16.840]  That's why when Donald Trump and myself and others call for restoring our borders and doing
[03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:22.120]  better trade deals and not ceding our authority to the TPP, they claim we're Russian agents.
[03:40:22.840 --> 03:40:28.680]  Because Russia itself is pulling out of the new world order. The UK is doing it and so are we.
[03:40:28.680 --> 03:40:33.880]  So if you're a foreign group taking a country over, what do you do? You start pointing fingers at the
[03:40:33.880 --> 03:40:39.480]  patriots internally who are trying to save the country and claim their foreign Ruski agents.
[03:40:39.480 --> 03:40:44.840]  By mid-summer we had seen WikiLeaks, DCLeaks and other organizations dump hundreds of thousands
[03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:51.320]  of pages of hacked emails on the web showing the organized crime operation going on between the
[03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:56.200]  Democrats, the mainstream media and the foreign banks that literally own and control them. So to
[03:40:56.200 --> 03:41:01.800]  divert the public from the crimes they'd committed, they doubled down and said, see the Russians are
[03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:07.320]  involved in taking over our elections and manipulating things, but they showed no evidence.
[03:41:07.320 --> 03:41:12.600]  By late August, Hillary Clinton was 10 to 15 points in national polls behind Donald Trump.
[03:41:12.600 --> 03:41:18.200]  They were panicking. I began to see rumblings from the UN and the EU that they were going to send
[03:41:18.200 --> 03:41:24.440]  10 times the number of observers they normally would to oversee our elections. That's why I went
[03:41:24.440 --> 03:41:30.120]  on air and said we need to look at the attempt by Hillary to steal this election. She stole the
[03:41:30.120 --> 03:41:35.080]  nomination from Bernie Sanders, the sky's the limit. Obama came out two weeks later and basically
[03:41:35.080 --> 03:41:41.640]  said I was crazy. Election fraud didn't exist. Then two weeks after that they announced that they
[03:41:41.640 --> 03:41:47.640]  were going to federalize the elections to keep them safe from right-wingers and the Russians.
[03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:54.120]  Then on September 1st, Democratic Party nominee goes on national television and says
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:41:59.400]  that if we think Russia has launched any type of cyber attack on the U.S. that we'll launch a
[03:41:59.400 --> 03:42:07.160]  cyber attack on them and maybe even use physical military force. You've seen reports. Russia's
[03:42:07.160 --> 03:42:11.880]  hacked into a lot of things. China's hacked into a lot of things. Russia even hacked into the Democratic
[03:42:11.880 --> 03:42:19.640]  National Committee. Maybe even some state election systems. So we've got to step up our game.
[03:42:20.280 --> 03:42:24.520]  Make sure we are well defended and able to take the fight to those who go after us.
[03:42:24.520 --> 03:42:32.600]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any
[03:42:32.600 --> 03:42:39.240]  other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[03:42:39.880 --> 03:42:45.240]  On cue for the next month, the leading story every night is that Russia is taking over the
[03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:51.320]  elections, that Russia has spies everywhere, and that Donald Trump works for them. Then on October
[03:42:51.320 --> 03:42:57.320]  7th, the director of national intelligence getting his information from the CIA comes out and says,
[03:42:57.880 --> 03:43:03.560]  we know it's the Russians. They have cyber attacked us officially, but gave no evidence.
[03:43:03.560 --> 03:43:08.760]  Then a week later, Vice President Joe Biden in Mafioso style goes on Meet the Press and
[03:43:08.760 --> 03:43:14.040]  tells Russia, we're going to send you a message with a massive cyber attack. We've got incredible
[03:43:14.040 --> 03:43:18.680]  capabilities. We're going to show you. Why don't we send a message out to Putin?
[03:43:18.680 --> 03:43:29.880]  We're sending a message. We have the capacity to do it. And the message you said that he'll know it
[03:43:29.880 --> 03:43:35.960]  and will be at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact,
[03:43:35.960 --> 03:43:43.560]  the capacity to do to fundamentally all their election is not what people think. And I tell
[03:43:43.560 --> 03:43:51.560]  you what, to the extent that they do, we will be proportional in what we do. So a message is
[03:43:51.560 --> 03:43:57.880]  going to be sent. Will the public know it? I hope not. And this is where the critical,
[03:43:58.440 --> 03:44:04.280]  bureaucratic declaration of war outside of Congress's authority comes in. Because we have the
[03:44:04.280 --> 03:44:10.920]  director of national intelligence. We have the intelligence agency heads. We have Mrs. Clinton.
[03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:15.560]  We have Joe Biden. We have Obama meeting with top generals just two days ago talking about war
[03:44:15.560 --> 03:44:23.720]  with Russia in preparation and saying their new doctrine is if you cyber attack us, we will cyber
[03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:31.320]  attack you and or both hit you with a military response in Hillary Clinton's own words. And
[03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:38.200]  guess what? That's the new NATO doctrine they announced a month ago that they may hit Russia first
[03:44:38.200 --> 03:44:45.320]  or if any cyber attacks, any hacking of any type come from the massive country of Russia that they
[03:44:45.320 --> 03:44:52.360]  won't take that as an act of war from any angle you look at. We are now officially at war with
[03:44:52.360 --> 03:44:57.560]  Russia and this is surpassing anything that ever happened in the Cold War, according to even main
[03:44:57.560 --> 03:45:04.360]  line analyst. And we have proxy wars on the border of Russia in Ukraine and in Russia's backyard in
[03:45:04.360 --> 03:45:09.160]  Syria. And we have top generals in Congress like the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Dumford, saying,
[03:45:09.160 --> 03:45:13.640]  look, you're asking me to put up a no fly zone and shoot down Russian aircraft. They're going to
[03:45:13.640 --> 03:45:20.600]  attack us back. That is an act of war. Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in
[03:45:20.600 --> 03:45:27.080]  Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia. In summation, why is all of this
[03:45:27.080 --> 03:45:33.000]  happening? Well, about a week ago, General Milley, the head of the army, explained why. If you try
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:38.840]  to have the Brexit or if Russia tries to pull out of the new world order, or if patriots worldwide
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:44.760]  support the collapse of the EU because it's unelected, our military working for the globalist
[03:45:44.760 --> 03:45:49.720]  will hit you harder than you've ever been hit before. That's the message. And Russia is being
[03:45:49.720 --> 03:45:55.320]  scapegoated for the unraveling of the new world order and world government. The United States
[03:45:55.320 --> 03:46:03.000]  military, despite all our challenges, despite our op tempo, despite everything we've been doing,
[03:46:03.720 --> 03:46:09.800]  will stop you and we will beat you harder than you've ever been beaten before. Make no mistake
[03:46:09.800 --> 03:46:15.640]  about that. Other countries, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea went to school on us.
[03:46:16.360 --> 03:46:21.720]  They closely watched how we fought in 91 and 03. They studied our doctrine, our tactics,
[03:46:21.720 --> 03:46:28.280]  our equipment, our organization, our training, and our leadership. And in turn, they revised
[03:46:28.280 --> 03:46:33.480]  their own doctrines and they are rapidly modernizing the military today to avoid our strengths
[03:46:34.760 --> 03:46:39.720]  in hopes of defeating us at some point in the future. First, not surprisingly,
[03:46:40.680 --> 03:46:47.800]  is that we'll be highly lethal, very highly lethal, unlike anything our army has experienced,
[03:46:47.800 --> 03:46:53.880]  at least since World War II. The world is in global turmoil. Major banks are going under
[03:46:53.880 --> 03:46:59.960]  on a routine basis. The biggest bank in Germany, Deutsche Bank, is teetering on the edge of collapse
[03:46:59.960 --> 03:47:06.040]  and will make Lehman Brothers look tame in comparison. And historically, when major
[03:47:06.040 --> 03:47:12.680]  collapses begin to happen, countries and empires tend to start wars as a political distraction
[03:47:12.680 --> 03:47:19.480]  so they can blame the international financial crises on the war itself and not on their own
[03:47:19.480 --> 03:47:24.920]  failed policies. And of course, they want to influence the election here. Every globalist
[03:47:24.920 --> 03:47:29.800]  publication from the Washington Post to the Financial Times of London to the Economist admits
[03:47:29.800 --> 03:47:34.360]  that with Brexit pulling out of the Euro and with Russia pulling out of globalism, what's
[03:47:34.360 --> 03:47:39.480]  happening here with nationalism and Trump, they're on their last legs and they've got to prop Hillary
[03:47:39.480 --> 03:47:46.040]  up. She is their Stalingrad. She is their Waterloo. If she falls there, they believe in their own
[03:47:46.040 --> 03:47:50.520]  words, their whole system will completely unravel. Well, I got news for them. It's already unraveling.
[03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:56.040]  But they believe that if they can trick Russia into a physical war or cyberattack Russia and
[03:47:56.040 --> 03:48:02.600]  get Russia to respond back, they can then pull false flags during the election and use that as
[03:48:02.600 --> 03:48:08.040]  an excuse to blame Russia for any election problems. Then Homeland Security has to come in
[03:48:08.040 --> 03:48:14.520]  to federalize it further to protect the vote. The good news is across the political spectrum,
[03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:20.280]  the intelligentsia is really waking up to the fact that we have a very dangerous criminal group
[03:48:20.280 --> 03:48:25.880]  in control of our country that wants to stay in control and who might even start a nuclear war
[03:48:25.880 --> 03:48:30.360]  to do so. And that's why the head of the Green Party and others have come out and said that
[03:48:30.360 --> 03:48:35.560]  Hillary Clinton is much more dangerous than Donald Trump because she says that she wants a war with
[03:48:35.560 --> 03:48:42.200]  Russia. She wants a war with Iran and others. Under Hillary Clinton, we could slide into nuclear war
[03:48:42.200 --> 03:48:48.360]  very quickly from her declared policy in Syria. So I won't sleep well at night if Donald Trump is
[03:48:48.360 --> 03:48:53.080]  elected, but I sure won't sleep well at night if Hillary Clinton is elected. The ball is now in
[03:48:53.080 --> 03:48:59.080]  your court. History is repeating itself in a very, very dangerous fashion. The criminal elements that
[03:48:59.080 --> 03:49:04.840]  have hijacked our country are trying to start physical wars with Russia and others. They're
[03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:10.040]  opening our borders up, bringing in jihadis here to destabilize things as well. They're taking
[03:49:10.040 --> 03:49:14.920]  over our election processes to, quote, protect it from the Russians, even as they announce they're
[03:49:14.920 --> 03:49:20.680]  going to launch a massive cyber attack against Russia in retaliation for something they can't
[03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:26.440]  even prove Russia did. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a critical time, probably one of the most critical
[03:49:26.440 --> 03:49:32.280]  times in all of human history and development. It's now time to hit a knee and start asking God
[03:49:32.280 --> 03:49:38.280]  to basically open more people's eyes up and that we would have peace on this planet and not thermal
[03:49:38.280 --> 03:49:45.240]  nuclear war. The people are ready to be awakened. Please take this special report, email it to members
[03:49:45.240 --> 03:49:49.720]  of Congress, to local talk show hosts, and to mainstream media and say it's time to wake up
[03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:58.360]  and turn this country and the world around from the brink of Armageddon. Now let's just illustrate
[03:49:58.360 --> 03:50:05.320]  this real quick. Go to my screen right here. World War III Russia, you hit all. Not one
[03:50:05.320 --> 03:50:09.720]  mainstream media news source talking about it here in the United States. All over the world,
[03:50:09.720 --> 03:50:15.000]  they're talking about it, but not here. Now let's go to, same thing, World War III Russia hit news.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:21.720]  Even less results, nobody talking about it in the United States. It's a complete blackout. The only
[03:50:21.720 --> 03:50:28.840]  place you're getting this type of analysis and news is from alternative media and infowars.com.
[03:50:29.560 --> 03:50:32.440]  And we're the leader in alternative media. I can tell you that right now. You're not going to hear
[03:50:32.440 --> 03:50:39.000]  this on fake alternative media like the Young Turks. Now nobody's talking about this, so you need
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:43.960]  to wake up and spread the word about what's going on. Okay? We'll be back one more segment of the

[03:52:53.960 --> 03:53:05.080]  Hi, my name is Stephen Holstein. In my 20s, I abuse stimulant and antiviral steroids at
[03:53:05.080 --> 03:53:09.080]  the point where my adrenal glands were shot. I suffer from extreme fatigue and inability
[03:53:09.080 --> 03:53:13.720]  to handle stress. For over six years, I have been taking adrenal supplements including herbs,
[03:53:13.720 --> 03:53:19.000]  glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5. All these supplements did was treat the symptoms
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:24.040]  and produced only minimal results. Now, just after one month on Synergy 1 and ADR Medics,
[03:53:24.040 --> 03:53:29.800]  I truly feel rejuvenated. I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement
[03:53:29.800 --> 03:53:35.720]  as I did just 10 minutes after taking ADR Medics. I then noticed Synergy 1 made me wake up rested
[03:53:35.720 --> 03:53:40.680]  and with much more energy. No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising. I had almost
[03:53:40.680 --> 03:53:45.560]  considered going to another country for stem cell therapy at the last resort, but now I truly
[03:53:45.560 --> 03:53:51.080]  feel rejuvenated on Synergy 1 and ADR Medics. Success happens with synergistic nutrition.

[03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:24.840]  deep behind enemy lines. This is our final segment here with you today. It's been an
[03:54:24.840 --> 03:54:31.160]  amazing show we had Roger Stone on earlier and yesterday he put out a tweet at 831.
[03:54:31.160 --> 03:54:35.560]  John Kerry threatened the Ecuadorian president with grave consequences for Ecuador if Assange
[03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:41.800]  is not silenced. And so what happened? Well, his internet got cut off and nobody knew who it was.
[03:54:41.800 --> 03:54:48.520]  They said a state had cut it off. Now, WikiLeaks, 26 minutes ago now, we can confirm Ecuador cut
[03:54:48.520 --> 03:54:54.600]  off Assange's internet access Saturday at 5 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time shortly after the publication
[03:54:54.600 --> 03:55:00.680]  of Clinton's Goldman Sachs speeches. So you got John Kerry running around like a hatchet man trying
[03:55:00.680 --> 03:55:07.160]  to keep people shut up and silenced because they don't want the word getting out. And this just
[03:55:07.160 --> 03:55:11.640]  completely illustrates the fact that we are on top of this story better than anyone else
[03:55:12.680 --> 03:55:17.000]  right here. Sometimes Roger Stone says stuff and I can't even believe it, but here he is
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:19.960]  the day before and then WikiLeaks comes down and says it was Ecuador.
[03:55:21.800 --> 03:55:25.960]  And now on the show today, Roger Stone said it looks like Hillary is going to drop out next
[03:55:25.960 --> 03:55:34.040]  week. So we'll see if that happens. But totally, totally incredible. And this just brings me up
[03:55:34.040 --> 03:55:38.680]  to this Wednesday. We're going to be going 11 straight hours, 13 straight hours, I'm sorry.
[03:55:39.320 --> 03:55:45.960]  October 19th, starting at 11 a.m. We're going to go to midnight. And that's the day of the final
[03:55:45.960 --> 03:55:52.120]  debate, the final debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Let's bring up the graphic please.
[03:55:53.880 --> 03:55:58.840]  There it is. Live feed analysis, 13 hours of coverage starts at 11 a.m. You can find the

[03:56:17.160 --> 03:56:24.040]  globalists. Let's look at these two emails. Here's one to John Podesta.
[03:56:26.200 --> 03:56:30.920]  Says I mean they will go after the deleting of private emails but at some point they will
[03:56:30.920 --> 03:56:36.280]  just run out of steam especially as they see minimal electoral consequence. So they want
[03:56:36.280 --> 03:56:41.320]  you not to worry about these emails and they say oh they'll bitch about it for a little bit.
[03:56:41.320 --> 03:56:49.000]  But then after a while they'll just give up and forget about it and you know what people
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:56:53.240]  aren't forgetting about it. In fact we had an article last week from Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:56:54.760 --> 03:56:59.160]  Google Trends shows internet users far more interested in WikiLeaks than Trump allegations.
[03:56:59.160 --> 03:57:06.040]  That was October 14th and you can see the blue line here represents WikiLeaks. Okay here's Trump's
[03:57:06.040 --> 03:57:10.760]  allegations way way down below. The only people that care about this are Democratic operatives
[03:57:10.760 --> 03:57:14.760]  who are passing it back and forth on their Facebook. Look at the interest in WikiLeaks.
[03:57:15.480 --> 03:57:21.080]  So much interest John Kerry had to go threaten the Ecuadorian embassy and so they cut off his
[03:57:21.080 --> 03:57:28.680]  internet and nobody knew who it was until WikiLeaks just came out with it. Roger Stone said it
[03:57:28.680 --> 03:57:33.160]  today before then WikiLeaks came out said what's confirmed the Ecuador cut off our internet access.
[03:57:33.160 --> 03:57:41.480]  Now here's an email to Cheryl Mills, Huma and John Podesta. It says to be clear there are and
[03:57:41.480 --> 03:57:47.080]  will likely remain only two parties who can release the full 55k so now they're saying there's 55,000
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:51.960]  emails. The state and us nobody else will have them. Yeti will only end up with what's relevant
[03:57:51.960 --> 03:57:56.440]  to his committee which won't grow that much beyond what he has. Probably not get anywhere close to 500.
[03:57:56.440 --> 03:58:02.760]  So I don't know if this shows Republicans colluding with the Democrats on just
[03:58:02.760 --> 03:58:08.440]  cherry picking certain issues which I don't think it shows that but it shows that there's 55,000
[03:58:08.440 --> 03:58:16.120]  emails not just 33,000. There it is right there in the email 55k. 55,000 emails they decided they
[03:58:16.120 --> 03:58:20.920]  had to hide from you. It's not all yoga poses people. It's not lobster bisque recipes. It's how
[03:58:20.920 --> 03:58:25.240]  they're trying to screw you. That's what it's all about. So thank you for joining us today
