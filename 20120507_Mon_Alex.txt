[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:43.640]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is Monday the 7th day of May
[00:43.640 --> 00:55.400]  2012 and we are going to be live here for the next three hours Lord willing and I am going to
[00:55.400 --> 01:04.040]  attempt as best I can to take your phone calls we also have Catherine Albright joining us over a
[01:04.040 --> 01:10.040]  new DARPA slash Pentagon report that they for the military safety of course the TSA needs to stick
[01:10.040 --> 01:13.560]  their hands on your pants for your safety and they just surveil you without warrants for your
[01:13.560 --> 01:17.880]  safety and put sodium fluoride in your water and cancer viruses and your vaccines for your
[01:17.880 --> 01:28.040]  safety but for the military personnel safety they all need implantable microchips my cousin
[01:28.040 --> 01:35.000]  I don't know it must have been a decade ago now I saw him out at a family event and he was a military
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.800]  officer still isn't he said he's in the army he said wow you're not making this stuff up they
[01:39.800 --> 01:45.960]  called us all together several hundred officers and told us that selective forces would start
[01:45.960 --> 01:50.920]  getting microchips soon and then it would be classified I saw him a few years later and he
[01:50.920 --> 01:57.640]  wouldn't talk to me about it and he said I'm not going to discuss it so I guess he probably got
[01:57.640 --> 02:04.440]  the microchip for all I know we're not in Kansas anymore but I'm still kooky and bad for saying
[02:04.440 --> 02:10.520]  it's coming even though now it's in place because everybody knows they don't microchip the troops
[02:10.520 --> 02:15.400]  I mean that'd be an Orwellian police state everybody knows they don't listen to our phone
[02:15.400 --> 02:23.880]  calls without warrants that's illegal everybody knows right everybody knows there's not reeducation
[02:23.880 --> 02:28.680]  camps in America everybody knows they're not going to put political dissonance in them even
[02:28.680 --> 02:35.080]  though they say they are everybody knows America's run by the American people of course we're not
[02:37.240 --> 02:43.000]  so we have a big decision to make here are we just going to go along with this and just
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.600]  kind of be acclimated to it that's what's happening everything is a Pavlovian dog training
[02:48.600 --> 02:53.560]  acclimation the TSA in the airports now on the streets the military at every public event
[02:53.560 --> 02:59.320]  posters and signs saying support the military that means support the globalists that control
[02:59.320 --> 03:06.760]  our military I mean if you're even halfway awake this is cartoon level propaganda if I was Kurt
[03:06.760 --> 03:12.120]  Vonnegut I'm going to write a satirical futuristic police state 50 years ago which he did write
[03:12.120 --> 03:18.040]  several books like that I couldn't come up with something out of my imagination this over the top
[03:18.040 --> 03:28.520]  and to have giant swaths giant cutlets of the population totally unaware of what's going on
[03:30.520 --> 03:37.880]  walking into machine gun fire the GMO the aspartame the bisphenol a the chemicals all of it
[03:37.880 --> 03:43.880]  the death rates just skyrocketing we are in the middle of a holocaust we're in the middle of a
[03:43.880 --> 03:50.520]  genocidal operation the numbers are all there just just off the charts if I could put graphs up here
[03:50.520 --> 03:53.720]  on screen for people watching at prison upon a dot tv we do we are going to do some more of these
[03:53.720 --> 03:58.520]  graphs we've done in the past not just showing government killing 262 million people last century
[04:00.600 --> 04:10.200]  but all the other big events it is mind boggling it is mind blowing that governments have learned
[04:10.200 --> 04:13.880]  to not line you up and shoot you because people will go ahead and know they have nothing left to lose
[04:13.880 --> 04:21.160]  and fight back they just slowly start poisoning the food and water everybody's stumbling around
[04:22.280 --> 04:29.240]  poisoned by it in a near narcoleptic state and you can just see it happening everywhere
[04:31.160 --> 04:35.240]  and all your neighbors got cancer the other ones got a gather kids dying of it yeah my buddy

[08:33.880 --> 08:39.640]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live
[08:39.640 --> 08:47.320]  monday worldwide broadcast i am alex jones your host and if you're a new listener all i want is
[08:47.320 --> 08:53.000]  to be free all i want is a chance for others to be free i want my human dignity and i am
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.920]  very concerned about the number one unnatural killer of human beings in history and that of
[08:58.920 --> 09:06.600]  course is government in every culture every society every period of history undoubtedly
[09:06.600 --> 09:12.440]  university of hawaii chicago business school they've all done studies you can look it up yourself
[09:12.440 --> 09:23.320]  you can look it up yourself demo side killed 262 million people in the 20th century the numbers
[09:23.320 --> 09:30.520]  in the last 12 years 11 and a half years of this new century are well over 10 million
[09:32.120 --> 09:37.400]  government i'm going to say that again is the number one threat but on the television in the
[09:37.400 --> 09:42.920]  control room in the television back in the break room we have different newscasts on
[09:42.920 --> 09:49.160]  and whether it's fox or cnn fox in this room cnn in that room our msnbc down the hall as we monitor
[09:49.160 --> 09:55.400]  globalist different flavors of poison koolaid here in the global jim jones compound they give
[09:55.400 --> 10:00.040]  you you know choices different flavors of it but as the same deadly globalist ingredients
[10:00.600 --> 10:06.360]  all i heard about is how they're toppling al qaeda a big victory but the new enemy is domestic
[10:06.360 --> 10:12.280]  ribs and i even heard amar allaki how they killed him last year and what a great victory that was
[10:12.280 --> 10:19.080]  this is a guy admitted to work for the fbi and the pentagon and to meet secretly with the pentagon
[10:19.080 --> 10:24.760]  and i've even had colonel schaefer on to openly say and he worked at the highest levels of national
[10:24.760 --> 10:31.160]  security that yes amar allaki was quote a double agent working for the justice department folks not
[10:31.160 --> 10:40.200]  a double agent four of the five al qaeda leaders were all born in the us the mastermind of the
[10:40.200 --> 10:48.120]  seven seven bombing a swat was admittedly mi6 that came out in the bbc and even fox news it's not
[10:48.120 --> 10:55.800]  debatable al qaeda works for the bankers for the enemies of this country and they use the threat
[10:55.800 --> 11:01.160]  of al qaeda to take our liberties it's so elementary they just said we're going to build up a giant
[11:01.160 --> 11:05.960]  police state in spain without warrants and build fema camps for the american people
[11:06.760 --> 11:11.320]  the globalist would have never gotten away with it but oh it's for the scary men with the turbines
[11:11.320 --> 11:18.760]  come on this is so simple this is so elementary what's going on now let me give you a rundown
[11:18.760 --> 11:24.840]  of what's coming up today darpa is announcing the plans to move forward with micro chipping the
[11:24.840 --> 11:31.720]  trips that's already been going on covertly i even have it firsthand from a member of my family
[11:32.680 --> 11:36.840]  who i guess followed orders and took the chip because he does not want to hear about it now
[11:36.840 --> 11:41.960]  he's like oh yeah they all told us that the next few years the officers and then also special forces
[11:41.960 --> 11:46.680]  and others were going to be getting micro chips sub dermal he goes wow you're really right about
[11:46.680 --> 11:56.120]  this man i thought you were crazy not anymore now it's basically you probably kept me from getting
[11:56.120 --> 12:00.200]  promotions just because they found out that you're related to me and i don't want to talk to you
[12:02.600 --> 12:07.240]  you're right about all this stuff but don't ask me about it don't ask me about it okay whatever
[12:08.120 --> 12:13.480]  there is business insider world in daily darpa is saying they want the trips to be chipped for
[12:13.480 --> 12:20.440]  their safety of course so catherine albricht is coming up to break that down in the third hour
[12:20.440 --> 12:33.000]  today continuing here we have this holland holland guy getting elected and on the front page of
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.600]  info wars dot com we've got a photograph of this guy he looks super creepy but what have i told you
[12:38.600 --> 12:44.040]  was going to happen the banksters get the governments of europe the united states england
[12:44.040 --> 12:51.080]  australia scotland ireland all of them all of the same management globalist system to shine on
[12:51.080 --> 12:58.280]  globally this is an old number it's approaching dr tarpley and many other economists say
[12:58.280 --> 13:08.040]  two quadrillion two thousand trillion but it was 1.5 quadrillion uh the washington post a couple
[13:08.040 --> 13:18.680]  years ago said it was 644 trillion it was the united states share of this let me say that again
[13:18.680 --> 13:32.920]  600 and 40 plus trillion the entire gdp is 14 something trillion a year the debt is 15
[13:32.920 --> 13:41.080]  something trillion this isn't our debt and and iceland said no after a year of fighting we're
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.720]  not going to quote pay off these derivatives and then it turned out 90 plus percent was not owed by
[13:45.720 --> 13:54.200]  them and the bankers that did run the country fled everybody else has fallen greece ireland
[13:54.760 --> 14:02.920]  we've fallen to it uh now spain and they tell you in the news you owe this it's your fault and a part
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.280]  of it is the social welfare system that's meant to make you dependent so you pay in to your pension
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.120]  and so they can steal it through government and through inflation and so you're you're tied in
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.800]  and desperately connected to the system and never want to pull out of it but i told you i said the
[14:17.800 --> 14:29.240]  fake revolutions in europe will be socialist and that's what's happened with this haland character
[14:33.640 --> 14:38.840]  and they've they replaced the globalist sarcosi so-called right wing give me a break
[14:38.840 --> 14:44.680]  they've gotten rid of them and now they bring in a guy who says he's going to raise taxes
[14:49.880 --> 14:58.440]  now they bring in france schwa haland who is a open committed world government globalist
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.480]  and who says i'm going to raise taxes on the rich that means people making the equivalent
[15:05.480 --> 15:13.560]  it's a global model under the oecd 125 000 a year converted over into euros
[15:15.160 --> 15:20.920]  you notice that's what obama says is is rich here this is global standardization because they
[15:20.920 --> 15:25.480]  don't want people to be able to run away with their wealth show you got warren buffett you got
[15:25.480 --> 15:30.920]  bill gates you got all the top globalist on television and print every day there's articles
[15:30.920 --> 15:36.600]  and newscast i mean i'm in restaurants hotel rooms anywhere turn on the television it's bill
[15:36.600 --> 15:41.240]  and melinda gates and warren buffett and ted turner saying the rich need to pay more
[15:41.240 --> 15:47.080]  raise taxes what they mean is middle class pay more the money is then paid in banker bailout
[15:47.080 --> 15:50.280]  and i know you've got this as an audience but we need to get this out to the general public
[15:51.400 --> 15:54.760]  because when they fully implode the united states which we're already in the process of
[15:54.760 --> 16:00.120]  they're going to offer socialism as the solution and they're going to have the 50 million people
[16:00.120 --> 16:05.080]  on food stamps and they're going to have the 100 plus million others that are on some form
[16:05.080 --> 16:11.240]  of welfare or government assistance that's half the country roughly and then the contractors
[16:11.240 --> 16:16.520]  everybody else they're going to go out and say give me my big government and they are going to
[16:16.520 --> 16:22.200]  continue to raise taxes on the middle class to destroy the productive part of the economy
[16:22.200 --> 16:26.200]  they don't want it to be productive then they're going to lower the standard of living and that's
[16:26.200 --> 16:32.600]  what globalism is that's the plan to recue to rob you and to make you totally dependent on them
[16:34.120 --> 16:38.920]  and then have the economy collapse and then reorganize the economy under total command and
[16:38.920 --> 16:45.480]  control authoritarian edicts you can call it whatever you want but it's 31 flavors of corruption
[16:45.480 --> 16:52.680]  31 flavors of tyranny they don't teach real political science in colleges they don't teach
[16:52.680 --> 16:58.360]  full spectrum dominance they don't what's taught to the political class most of them are just idiots
[16:59.080 --> 17:05.320]  is not even reality they don't teach its corporate fascism that sits on top and funds a socialism
[17:05.320 --> 17:11.800]  that then moves into a communism with globalist offshore using that to squeeze the serfs it's
[17:11.800 --> 17:24.200]  feudalism you know the the the the proper term is neo feudalistic serfdom that is the most accurate
[17:24.200 --> 17:32.120]  term that you can find in some political text i mean that's why you just as george arwell talked
[17:32.120 --> 17:36.600]  about the fact of the you know the plan under ing sock was to destroy the language where you
[17:36.600 --> 17:44.680]  couldn't even communicate in england if you call someone homosexual you're arrested the scientific
[17:44.680 --> 17:51.000]  name the police come and arrest you there's no law the law just says they can define what's racist
[17:52.200 --> 17:58.040]  and the bbc and the sun are both reporting that that the police are telling their own employees
[17:58.840 --> 18:04.600]  and own people if you use the word blacklist for websites or for information you will get
[18:04.600 --> 18:11.080]  in trouble or be arrested you're like but because it might mean racism no blacklist means blacking
[18:11.080 --> 18:16.200]  out someone's name off a list of vendors you know when the nsa blacks out something that's
[18:16.200 --> 18:25.720]  blacklisting it blacklist means strike your name off means puts you on the list of people
[18:25.720 --> 18:31.720]  that you don't associate with they have the term blacklist in different formulations in every culture
[18:31.720 --> 18:38.840]  but again they're now assaulting words and telling you that they're bad
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.920]  and so all over the world they are involved in attacking productivity because productivity
[18:48.920 --> 18:56.520]  and wealth means independence and the globalist are control freaks they enjoy poverty and pain
[18:56.520 --> 19:01.800]  they love being the only ones with the wealth and the richest people in the world from the
[19:01.800 --> 19:09.160]  Rockefellers of the Rothschilds 24 seven just go look at their quotes daily are saying raise taxes
[19:09.160 --> 19:14.600]  please throw me in the briar patch oh my gosh when they write the laws to be exempt and it is the
[19:14.600 --> 19:22.760]  giant fraud and the french if you believe the election results have absolutely asked for it
[19:22.760 --> 19:30.040]  and that's why France is dying and the French culture is dying and it's all by globalist design
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.640]  all been done by design and the same thing's happening here and as they implode things the
[19:35.640 --> 19:42.520]  answer is going to be socialism the answer is going to be total control and those of us that produce
[19:43.560 --> 19:50.520]  are going to be absolutely sucked off of by these parasites now when we come back
[19:50.520 --> 19:57.320]  Paul Watson has now read the entire army reeducation camp document and it has torture

[24:07.240 --> 24:13.800]  parts of the world and what the globalists are up to try to control revolutions and get the people
[24:13.800 --> 24:18.440]  to vote in even more control in their attempt to get away from the globalist
[24:18.440 --> 24:28.040]  also there is a daily mail article confirming what we've known for a long time many of the top
[24:29.160 --> 24:35.560]  cosmetic makers and others are busy taking parts from aborted fetuses
[24:37.080 --> 24:43.560]  and women are taking pills filled with the flesh of dead babies believing it's a fountain of youth
[24:43.560 --> 24:49.960]  mirror mirror on the wall who is the fairest of them all
[24:51.400 --> 24:58.440]  now it's like the portrait of durian gray though i would not want to see what your soul looks like
[24:58.440 --> 25:03.800]  thousands of pills filled with powdered human baby flesh discovered by customs officials in
[25:03.800 --> 25:11.080]  south korea more than 17 000 pills smell into the country have been intercepted since last august
[25:11.080 --> 25:18.360]  they're viewed as a miracle cure for all ailments but unsurprisingly they are harmful
[25:20.200 --> 25:29.560]  yeah no no kidding and i was thinking this weekend about soylent green the movie where you
[25:29.560 --> 25:33.240]  know the globalists have destroyed the environment everything it's actually an anti-human film and
[25:33.240 --> 25:42.440]  posing as a pro human film charlton heston senate and they find out that the soylent green
[25:42.440 --> 25:48.280]  is made out of people and i was thinking soylent pepsi we need a graphic with soylent pepsi
[25:48.280 --> 25:53.000]  because you know a year or so ago it came out they had a biotech company they were connected to
[25:53.000 --> 26:02.680]  fetal tissue stuff in developing different flavors flavonoids i guess and sure enough then a few
[26:02.680 --> 26:08.680]  months ago they had a big board meeting and a court ruled a federal court ruled that the
[26:08.680 --> 26:14.040]  shareholders of pepsico big builder burr group company are not allowed to know
[26:15.400 --> 26:21.320]  what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring but we already know so enjoy the flavor
[26:23.400 --> 26:30.520]  soylent pepsi but see oh a movie is shocking but oh they take babies that are already born
[26:30.520 --> 26:35.800]  sometimes months old they come and they grab them and they throw them in a bucket and then
[26:35.800 --> 26:39.640]  they beat the parents they take the woman a sterilizer in fact i meant to cover this last
[26:39.640 --> 26:42.440]  week guys it was in a major newspaper i think it was london telegraph
[26:45.960 --> 26:47.000]  us funding
[26:50.840 --> 26:58.120]  for sterilization in india or aid money funding for sterilization of men and women in india
[26:58.120 --> 27:05.080]  and again i just see this all the time and then i hear yuppies they say well there are too many
[27:05.080 --> 27:10.440]  people but okay let's say there are just for the sake of argument you're being poisoned okay they're
[27:10.440 --> 27:17.960]  putting fluoride in your water gmo total sterilization it's like 99 plus percent in all mammal species
[27:17.960 --> 27:25.240]  within three generations under this that that's confirmed we're dead this is a big deal it's over
[27:25.240 --> 27:29.320]  if we don't totally reverse things because humans have a longer generation than rats
[27:30.360 --> 27:36.040]  in a couple years you can do three generations on guinea pigs or or lab mice or or or or white
[27:36.040 --> 27:41.800]  lab rats wherever the case is and it's the same findings with all of them so we're about 20 years
[27:41.800 --> 27:48.600]  into the deep gmoing and 50 into the fluoride and and or 60 plus actually the point is we're about
[27:49.400 --> 27:52.760]  a third of the way into this right now and we've got to pull out of this quick
[27:52.760 --> 28:00.680]  right you see the globalists have something over us that it's so over the top what they're doing
[28:02.040 --> 28:08.440]  that people just have trouble interfacing here it is uk aid helps to fund forced sterilization
[28:08.440 --> 28:15.080]  of india's poor london guardian money from the department of international development has helped
[28:15.080 --> 28:21.400]  pay for controversial program that has led to miscarriages and even deaths after boxed operations
[28:21.400 --> 28:27.320]  yeah they give them special tetanus shots including here in the us where the women get sterilized on
[28:27.320 --> 28:34.840]  the spot or it they especially look for pregnant women it kills the baby inside or causes just
[28:34.840 --> 28:42.520]  unbelievable problems but hey you know all these genetic elements the kids are getting you see
[28:42.520 --> 28:50.680]  you go out in public kids in wheelchairs everywhere rock on new world order rock on rock on i mean
[28:50.680 --> 28:55.960]  you see i know all of this and i know i'm right and i know it's going to get a lot worse
[28:58.520 --> 29:00.280]  but the horror is so great
[29:04.120 --> 29:11.480]  that the average person cannot face it just cannot believe it we're going to go to break

[33:26.120 --> 33:35.480]  you know if you study history wild extreme government killing is the norm every culture
[33:37.000 --> 33:45.400]  at one time or another has demanded the first born young be killed and given to the state
[33:47.160 --> 33:50.840]  given to the state to be killed that's part of purging the underclasses
[33:50.840 --> 33:57.480]  so elites in every culture always thought the population was too great every time they've
[33:57.480 --> 34:02.360]  got enough slaves to do their work for them they start seeing them as roaches that they
[34:02.360 --> 34:08.840]  want to get rid of there's total disdain in elites across cultural lines throughout history
[34:10.440 --> 34:16.040]  you'll have you know the founder of a civilization or a city state who is intelligent and and and
[34:16.040 --> 34:21.720]  altruistic in many cases but their great great grandchildren just become unhappy spoiled rotten
[34:21.720 --> 34:29.320]  scum and there's all the sex and power and their worshiped as gods and they always want to be able
[34:29.320 --> 34:36.520]  to arrest whoever they want rape whoever they want and burn down cities for fun it's a tropism like
[34:36.520 --> 34:42.120]  a plant sprouts out of a seed and goes towards the sun this is what civilization is those that
[34:42.120 --> 34:48.520]  don't know history or doom to repeat it this is what civilization turns into during times of
[34:48.520 --> 34:55.480]  decadence and if we're not decadent right now worldwide i don't know what is now paul watson
[34:55.480 --> 35:00.520]  last week wrote some articles off of an army manual that the government and others and you
[35:00.520 --> 35:03.800]  know the media has covered they've confirmed you have a surreal army manual this is what's
[35:03.800 --> 35:09.080]  currently being taught in the last two years to prepare for reeducation camps of political
[35:09.080 --> 35:16.200]  dissidents in america and more than 30 places it says for u.s citizens social security numbers
[35:16.200 --> 35:22.280]  how to arrest us how to duct tape us how to put us in you know stress compliant positions torture
[35:22.280 --> 35:26.520]  and how to use us for forced labor well that's always been the point the civilian inmate labor
[35:26.520 --> 35:33.800]  camp program was the beta testing of convicts under u.s military control state and federal
[35:33.800 --> 35:38.360]  inmates now it's going to go to the political dissidents and that's the whole point of this
[35:38.360 --> 35:43.400]  i mean that's walmart built its business on political slaves in factories they're locked up
[35:43.400 --> 35:47.320]  in jail cells at night they're brought into highly controlled factories during the day
[35:47.960 --> 35:53.160]  most chinese public schools now the children go to school part of the time work in factories the
[35:53.160 --> 36:00.760]  other part firework factories and you know foxcom factories building apple ipads there's a lot of
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.920]  blood found in the in the textiles now little kids literally worked their fingers to the bone
[36:04.920 --> 36:11.160]  home so this is what's going on and so we built this horrible economy that destroyed our old real
[36:11.160 --> 36:18.840]  economy our value added economy on slave goods now we're going to become i mean it's kind of like
[36:18.840 --> 36:24.040]  bulkheads in a ship and you lower one the water comes into the next so globalism lowers everybody
[36:24.040 --> 36:29.160]  it doesn't rise anybody up but the globalists because again they're eugenicists that want to
[36:29.160 --> 36:36.520]  set up a world police state to cut off resources to kill the majority of us in the wars and the
[36:36.520 --> 36:42.600]  famines that come out of it and the depressions and say you're on welfare now but you've got to
[36:42.600 --> 36:49.400]  be sterilized and i have a stack of news from latin america asia india where you want health
[36:49.400 --> 36:55.080]  care sterilize yourself indian father forced to have a second me to save his son was forced to
[36:55.080 --> 36:59.560]  have a second me by doctors in exchange for treating his young son after he was bitten by a
[36:59.560 --> 37:06.600]  suspected rabid dog this is standard it's always been that way for 50 years india offers cars and
[37:06.600 --> 37:15.000]  tv sets for sterilization and again there's almost more indians than there are chinese i understand
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.320]  that many areas of india it's hellish but the point is that this is being done covertly and you
[37:21.320 --> 37:26.120]  need to know about it and just because you're some racist white yuppie and you're like come on there
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.800]  aren't too many people really it's being done to you but the globalists hate you even more you're
[37:31.800 --> 37:38.600]  the number one enemy because we all have the birthright of the magna carta and the republic and
[37:38.600 --> 37:45.160]  1776 declaration of independence all the trouble the new world order has had has come out of the west
[37:45.160 --> 37:50.440]  the new world order conquered the west and now has its power because of it but the fight is here
[37:50.440 --> 37:57.560]  the evil is here in western europe the uk the united states australia new zealand the evil is centered
[37:57.560 --> 38:06.120]  there but it's also the good is centered there so so this is where the controls are this is where
[38:06.120 --> 38:12.520]  the battle is happening and we are dead the west is dead 1.3 replacement rate for every two parents
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.240]  we're dead right now most actuary show it can't even be reversed if the average person started
[38:17.240 --> 38:21.800]  having seven children and they've economically married i saw articles this weekend in the us
[38:21.800 --> 38:26.680]  where they're now saying just being poor the cps is going to try to take your kids now you think
[38:26.680 --> 38:30.360]  you're going to go out there and live on the land they're coming they're coming they're coming
[38:30.360 --> 38:34.680]  they're coming now i want to take you to paul watson and then we'll take calls in the second hour
[38:35.880 --> 38:41.480]  we've got a lot of other news we're going to get to as well but paul watson wrote an article last
[38:41.480 --> 38:51.240]  friday and it said obama mentor wanted to put 25 million americans in reeducation camps and and
[38:51.240 --> 38:56.680]  this is the type of self-censorship because people it's a meme uh you know a week come and tell
[38:56.680 --> 39:05.880]  me say we exaggerate or that it's hyperbole and sometimes i i do exaggerate um not on purpose
[39:05.880 --> 39:10.280]  but you know it's a natural thing to do and i catch myself and back it off but that's probably
[39:10.280 --> 39:21.080]  one time out of a hundred literally most the time when i hear my show later i am cutting back on how
[39:21.080 --> 39:26.360]  hardcore it is i'm automatically governing it because because i can't even believe it at a
[39:26.360 --> 39:32.680]  subconscious level it's so incredible and i call watson up and i said hey buddy your headline
[39:32.680 --> 39:41.000]  says you wanted to incarcerate 25 mil it says kill liquidate kill and then i go in and we
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.120]  start having a debate about what uh eliminate means and i go the key goes on to say means kill
[39:46.920 --> 39:53.960]  put kill they want to kill kill kill and is it sensational you bet tyranny is sensational
[39:55.080 --> 39:58.680]  DARPA coming out saying yes we're going to microchip the troops i got news for it's already
[39:58.680 --> 40:05.240]  been going on with officers and special forces i don't just have documents and news articles on it
[40:05.240 --> 40:12.680]  i've got family and again these cops calling them and i go oh so you've been training with the
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.320]  military oh you've had the military and warrant service well alex i'm not really supposed to
[40:17.320 --> 40:22.680]  talk about it but yeah you're not supposed to talk about it because it's illegal torture is illegal
[40:22.680 --> 40:28.200]  ordering people to torture is illegal and of course he said well it's just al qaeda oh it ended up
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.080]  being raping children this is where it always goes it's what it always turns into the globalists
[40:33.080 --> 40:38.440]  want to legalize everything they do and so what they're doing is they're just legalizing it in
[40:38.440 --> 40:45.000]  practice they're just setting precedence and now that we get deeper down the mineshaft it's going
[40:45.000 --> 40:58.680]  to get crazier and weirder by the day okay they want the they want the average person to be like a child
[40:59.640 --> 41:08.200]  and to be unable to deal with real issues and so i've read the document over a hundred pages of it
[41:08.200 --> 41:15.000]  watson's read the whole thing it's got duct tape hoods overheads solitary confinement stress positions
[41:15.000 --> 41:22.200]  and it has whole paragraphs on how great these laborers will be for army jobs so it's got slave
[41:22.200 --> 41:30.040]  labor see we call it forced labor there's watson ratcheting back what it really is it's slave labor
[41:30.040 --> 41:39.800]  the stress positions described and the rest of it that's torture
[41:42.200 --> 41:48.040]  so here's the headline today reeducation camp manual includes rules on isolating political
[41:48.040 --> 41:58.680]  prisoners document also describes forced labor my headline would be army prepares forced labor
[41:58.680 --> 42:06.440]  camps for american citizens again i'm not criticizing watson here i'm trying to get us all to get
[42:06.440 --> 42:13.160]  our minds around this if you study history what's about to happen is the norm okay people are like
[42:13.160 --> 42:16.680]  this can't be happening it's all happening it's all they're telling you give up all your rights
[42:16.680 --> 42:21.240]  because of al-qaeda this non-existent meanwhile in one week there have been what 36 beheadings
[42:22.440 --> 42:28.360]  on the us-mexico border i mean it's total war bedlam and the government's all saying the american
[42:28.360 --> 42:34.200]  people are the enemy the government isn't the government paul watson has now read the entire
[42:34.200 --> 42:40.120]  document 300 plus pages i just did control f searches through it and read over a hundred and
[42:42.760 --> 42:47.080]  we've had the co-intel pro calling in saying oh it's not for citizens when the whole thing says it
[42:47.080 --> 42:53.160]  is just to make the debate about is it for citizens hoping we wouldn't read deeper and the few guys
[42:53.160 --> 42:59.960]  that got through had this power trip in their voice very calmly saying it doesn't say that because
[42:59.960 --> 43:04.280]  because they feel like they're part of the system they feel like they're going to be part of this
[43:04.280 --> 43:07.720]  and let me tell you all these tsa people that are going to be the new national police force
[43:08.280 --> 43:14.840]  they are looking forward of course they're full of pedophiles and and and pervs and people who
[43:14.840 --> 43:19.160]  also do that they're going to be the dungeon keepers and then in the system admits they're
[43:19.160 --> 43:23.880]  going to be manning the emergency centers so the police and military are going to go out and arrest
[43:23.880 --> 43:29.320]  you and they're going to take you to these facilities just filled with potbellies with cattle
[43:29.320 --> 43:35.720]  prods and stuff and let me tell you i've always been for peaceful resolution of this but no one
[43:35.720 --> 43:40.920]  can go to a reeducation camp they are going to rape your wife and rape your children they love it
[43:41.640 --> 43:47.560]  this is the spawn of literal hell that is upon us these are enemies here in this country
[43:47.560 --> 43:53.000]  paul watson break down the latest we've got to get this article out to everybody and we need another
[43:53.000 --> 44:00.520]  one we need to title this you know army establishing slave labor camps for americans i mean and notice
[44:01.800 --> 44:06.600]  notice the few mainstream media outlets that report on this are like oh well it's no big deal
[44:06.600 --> 44:13.560]  maybe it's needed i mean this is how far we've come paul well sometimes alex it doesn't
[44:13.560 --> 44:20.680]  doesn't matter what headline you put on it people will find any way possible to deny it and as you
[44:20.680 --> 44:26.760]  said first they said it wasn't for citizens we disprove that with about a dozen or more
[44:26.760 --> 44:33.080]  separate examples where it says directly if the president passes an executive order that nullifies
[44:33.080 --> 44:39.160]  posse comatatus then everything in this manual applies to us citizens and there's several references
[44:39.160 --> 44:46.440]  to us territory there's a reference to identifying prisoners via social security numbers so we prove
[44:46.440 --> 44:52.280]  beyond doubt that it does apply to us citizens so then this whole new thing about oh this is just
[44:52.280 --> 44:57.560]  a scenario it's just a plan for some future event they're always making plans the army this will
[44:57.560 --> 45:04.440]  never happen it's not a plan it's a manual it's to train people this is how you treat detainees
[45:04.440 --> 45:09.720]  in detention camps and as we saw from abu grave i mean they treat them a lot worse than what's in
[45:09.720 --> 45:15.400]  this manual even but this says directly that it's all designed to occur in the us as well
[45:16.280 --> 45:24.760]  so today this morning i went through it once again and found this provision about forced labor
[45:26.040 --> 45:34.200]  which is again if you do a control f search like you said earlier you can find all this page 277
[45:34.200 --> 45:40.680]  of the manual states detainees constitute a significant labor force of skilled and unskilled
[45:40.680 --> 45:46.040]  individuals these individuals should be employed to the fullest extent possible in work that is
[45:46.040 --> 45:51.960]  needed to construct manage perform administrative function for and maintain the internment facility
[45:51.960 --> 45:58.600]  so they're going to employ through forced labor the detainees the prisoners to build and maintain
[45:58.600 --> 46:03.160]  their own prison camp and well that's what that's what the new world order prison planet is we
[46:03.160 --> 46:07.560]  build our own prison camp the whole thing's a reeducation camp and that's exactly what i said on
[46:07.560 --> 46:14.040]  rt last week because i've studied these these camps are actually to create the trustees to go out
[46:14.040 --> 46:19.160]  and be the operatives in the general public the real political detainees they'll they'll never
[46:19.160 --> 46:25.960]  be released this is mainly a boot camp system for displaced persons and they become the slobbering
[46:25.960 --> 46:32.040]  fawning trustees all right so it talks about the political prisoners will be separated from
[46:32.040 --> 46:36.680]  the rest of the camp population and they'll use the style propaganda on some of the camp
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.120]  population to become informers on the rest of them so yeah that's exactly what it says and also
[46:42.120 --> 46:48.520]  with this whole labor issue the reeducation camps the infamous ones in china and north korea which
[46:48.520 --> 46:53.400]  is why all this is so chilling because the people who don't know that don't know its origins they
[46:53.400 --> 46:59.480]  don't know that there's 200 000 north koreans currently in reeducating camps over there but
[46:59.480 --> 47:05.320]  the whole idea behind them is not really reeducation once they're in the camps there's no plan to you
[47:05.320 --> 47:11.080]  know release them back into that society the political prisoners it's all about backbreaking
[47:11.080 --> 47:19.560]  forced labor 14 hours worth of you know hard slog with little food and completely inhumane
[47:19.560 --> 47:25.160]  conditions so that's the case in china and north korea and that's why it's such a threat in these
[47:25.160 --> 47:31.880]  in these manual documents because as i said it mentions forced labor also another thing i found
[47:31.880 --> 47:39.000]  just before well about half an hour ago originally we went with the headline uh re-educate you know
[47:39.000 --> 47:45.400]  leaked u.s. army document outlines plans for reeducation camps in america and in this manual
[47:45.400 --> 47:51.240]  they outline how these scyop officers will indoctrinate political activists to accept
[47:51.240 --> 47:58.120]  their view of u.s. policy and they use that word indoctrination but if you actually go and look at
[47:58.120 --> 48:07.080]  page 281 they're so brazen that they do use the exact term re-educating it says planning and
[48:07.080 --> 48:13.480]  conducting scyops to achieve other multinational and joint scyop task force or scyop support
[48:13.480 --> 48:21.480]  element objectives such as reorienting or re-educating the i.r. facility population
[48:21.480 --> 48:29.080]  that's the prisoners or setting the stage for acceptance of future operations so on page 281
[48:29.080 --> 48:36.040]  they directly say that these officers are responsible for quote re-educating the camp
[48:36.040 --> 48:42.040]  population so how anybody can be exaggerating that when it's right there in black and white
[48:42.040 --> 48:48.600]  and an army manual training document again the level of denial knows no bounds and remember well
[48:48.600 --> 48:54.280]  that's a psychological warfare point is to always just deny even as the tank is ramming into your
[48:54.280 --> 48:59.880]  house their blaring were not assaulting come out with your hands up you come out they found most
[48:59.880 --> 49:05.000]  people will oh and then they shoot you so it's it's just like in mars attacks to use a children's
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.480]  analogy the aliens are running around killing everybody with a loudspeaker saying don't run
[49:09.480 --> 49:13.880]  we are your friends and the people come out with their hands up and the aliens shoot them and go
[49:14.680 --> 49:19.960]  because it's so funny to them and that's what's so funny is they call us the extremists who
[49:19.960 --> 49:26.440]  are awake to this and then sit around laughing it's like carl rove telling you know the the media
[49:26.440 --> 49:31.160]  at a cocktail party new york times washington post he said we control reality you'll do whatever we
[49:31.160 --> 49:36.440]  say and the media said you're right sir we'll do whatever you say so they could say the sky is
[49:36.440 --> 49:42.520]  you know black at high noon when it's not the media will say it and and and and here's the deal
[49:43.400 --> 49:48.920]  they're already in police manuals now saying go ahead and pick somebody up and take them in
[49:48.920 --> 49:52.440]  i've seen this in law enforcement magazines if they've got to get us out of the un sticker
[49:52.440 --> 49:57.240]  for questioning and then now you'll just at first they're starting to set up these facilities where
[49:57.240 --> 50:01.000]  they just take in for no reason everybody's getting used to being arrested the police have been told
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.640]  arrest people for no seat belt get everybody in the system next time you get arrested you don't come
[50:05.640 --> 50:11.480]  back and they just hand you over to the feds you disappear and for a while they're going to get
[50:11.480 --> 50:17.240]  away with that but then everybody is just going to start resisting when anybody pulls them over
[50:17.240 --> 50:21.880]  but that's part of the plan then and the government's going to say look see the american people are
[50:21.880 --> 50:27.640]  terrorist they're starting to shoot any cop that pulls them over i mean can police see where this is
[50:27.640 --> 50:35.480]  going to go well i mean police are going to be involved with doing it because it says you know dhs
[50:35.480 --> 50:42.040]  i steamer civil support operations in the aftermath of money disasters terrorist attacks accidents or
[50:42.040 --> 50:47.720]  incidents in the u.s. all right your skype's breaking up politics usually fantastic we'll

[54:08.840 --> 54:13.880]  country back so they're going to overthrow the country completely and they're going to stage
[54:13.880 --> 54:19.400]  terror attacks everything else and use the collaborator media and population to pose as
[54:19.400 --> 54:25.000]  the saviors i mean we we have been captured by a foreign banking cartel we are occupied we've
[54:25.000 --> 54:31.560]  still got some media systems we are the counter revolution they warn of that's why police and
[54:31.560 --> 54:38.440]  all your manuals were demonized we're what's left of america it's so simple but you've got to wake up
[54:38.440 --> 54:43.720]  to the occupation to understand it here's alexander sheltzenitzen it was in the russian slave camps
[54:44.840 --> 54:51.480]  and how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.360]  operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return
[54:56.360 --> 55:02.600]  alive and had to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of mass arrests as for example in
[55:02.600 --> 55:08.360]  leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people had not simply sat there in their
[55:08.360 --> 55:15.400]  layers pailing with terror at every bang on the downstairs door and every step on the staircase
[55:15.400 --> 55:20.760]  but it understood that they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs
[55:20.760 --> 55:26.920]  hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes hammers pokers or whatever else was at hand these
[55:26.920 --> 55:32.600]  are folks didn't have guns the organs would have very quickly suffered a shortage of officers
[55:33.240 --> 55:38.600]  and transport and notwithstanding all of stalin's thirst the cursed machine would have ground to
[55:38.600 --> 55:46.920]  a halt if if we didn't love freedom enough and even more we had no awareness of the real situation
[55:46.920 --> 55:52.920]  and we purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward alexander i shows an
[55:52.920 --> 56:00.360]  easing well i'm alexander jones of texas of the once great republic of the united states and
[56:00.360 --> 56:06.280]  we are occupied worldwide the same management system is in europe is in australia is in canada
[56:06.840 --> 56:16.280]  is in mexico it's it's global management government and they now are putting tsa everywhere
[56:16.280 --> 56:19.880]  they're now setting up checkpoints everywhere they've now got fascist propaganda they're now
[56:19.880 --> 56:25.160]  admitting they're all listening to us all of this is happening world governments being announced
[56:25.160 --> 56:29.880]  england total tyranny is being announced exact same stuff disappearances secret arrest
[56:30.440 --> 56:36.360]  china's got the same system this is global government we're toe to toe with the new world order
[56:37.320 --> 56:42.920]  and all over the document how dhs is going to round us up and put us in camps and they are hiring
[56:42.920 --> 56:47.640]  with psychological test well who they hired the camps in iraq people kicked out of federal
[56:47.640 --> 56:55.800]  and state jails for raping people they're building armies of just the most deranged sickening demons
[56:55.800 --> 57:00.520]  you can imagine and they're going to send the police and military out to grab us and carry us back
[57:00.520 --> 57:05.640]  to them and let me tell you the public deserves that they get and those that are part of this
[57:05.640 --> 57:13.640]  deserve what you get paul watson your comments you were trying to get to on the rest of the document
[57:13.640 --> 57:19.560]  just making the point that there's this whole meme about oh this is on info wars dot com that
[57:19.560 --> 57:24.440]  means it can't be true it there's a quote that says this is a continuation of the info wars narrative
[57:24.440 --> 57:29.560]  of internment camps this is not a territory that's what i think you see we're bad because we're right
[57:30.120 --> 57:35.160]  when we're right that's that's the proof we're bad we're crazy because we're right people can't
[57:35.160 --> 57:39.560]  admit that we're right it's not like oh you were right let's do something but that's psyops that's
[57:39.560 --> 57:45.560]  the minority you're listening to paul but it does show they're psyoping well a it's laziness because
[57:45.560 --> 57:51.400]  they can't be bothered to read it's 326 pages they can't be bothered to read any of it so it's
[57:51.400 --> 57:58.280]  easier just to say oh that's from info wars there's probably bs but b my thinking you know the media
[57:58.280 --> 58:05.400]  got excited a couple of months ago about president bashar asad's emails that were leaked with some
[58:05.400 --> 58:12.440]  mindless nonsense in them imagine if they found a leaked document out of syria where a sad plan to
[58:12.440 --> 58:17.800]  in turn political dissidents forced labor and reeducate them do you think the media would
[58:17.800 --> 58:24.520]  be interested well yes they would not in this case well said we have to invade they have
[58:24.520 --> 58:29.800]  al-qaeda blowing up stuff and in the new state see we've got to go in asad's bad because al-qaeda

[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:21.400]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:30.920]  you know brigade homeland four years ago the pentagon admitted their training 370 plus
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:38.680]  thousand troops have auxiliary missions for crowd control civil unrest in the u.s ahead of the
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:44.600]  control collapse same thing's happening in europe global standardization we get an army manual it's
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:52.280]  confirmed to be real and it gets massive traffic on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:58.040]  almost no one else picks it up and if they do they just say well what's wrong with reeducation camps
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:03.320]  what's wrong with torture what's wrong with slave labor so paul i think you do an article
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:10.760]  with a boil down of all of it and just say you know proof that media is complicit or or or
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:16.760]  or uh you know media refuses to cover slave labor u.s slave labor camp news and point out the whole
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.840]  thing with the Assad regime because this is or maybe a headline the united states becoming north
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:30.120]  korea or media will not cover u.s north korean style slave camps because we need to punch this out
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.680]  into the media and and and because the reason they won't cover this just like it took a week
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:40.520]  for my act that we broke to get out in the news and other documents and ron paul's office got calls
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.280]  and lord bless him he's like we don't know if that's real for a week they you know no one would
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:49.480]  just call the fbi and find out it was real or call you know the uh state police there in kansas
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:54.200]  or missouri and find out was real we've got to force this out in the open because of course
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:00.040]  they're not covering it it shows how controlled the media is that this is confirmed slave labor camps
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:06.840]  reeduc slave labor reeducation camps and it just shows they will not cover it they will not because
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.480]  also it's not just that they're controlled then they've got to admit we're right then people
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.880]  got to admit stuff scary and this creeping national security states all around them paul
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.880]  well that's that's the thing isn't it they can't cover it because they can't deny it they can't
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:27.480]  make up some little excuse about how we exaggerated it because i mean take take the article i wrote
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:35.800]  on friday yes the reeducation camp manual does apply domestically to us citizens that is 50 60
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:42.600]  percent of it is direct quotes most of the rest of it is screenshots you can't exaggerate direct
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:48.600]  quotes you can't put a spin on them when they're directly lifted from the manual itself so that's
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:54.040]  why they don't want to cover it and people deny it because they haven't lived through hundreds of
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:01.000]  years of history whereby in every country in every century a group of people get persecuted
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.600]  whether it's you know jews in nazi germany blacks during the slavery era the catholic priests in
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:13.640]  16th century england that had to hide in priest holes because goons would come and try and hunt
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:18.520]  them down and kill them and the 21st century is going to be the century of persecution of
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:24.680]  political dissidents and this whole thing about building detainment internment camps to house them
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.960]  is a central part of it but people can't handle it because they haven't lived through history they
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:35.560]  don't know history and they think that just because we've got computers and satellite television and
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.920]  smartphones that none of this can happen even though it's happened in every other century throughout
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:47.240]  history again i liken it to one road you see and then you see 20 there's thousands if you're seeing
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.120]  20 roaches when you turn the light on that means there's thousands in your house you know in the
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:59.880]  basement in the crawl spaces they have lined up this giant operation you know 50 times literally
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.720]  bigger than the manhattan project of total control surveillance the cops all feel like they're special
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:10.520]  because they're part of it and have the military with them on gun raids and stuff it's all illegal
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:15.640]  there's just a giant national security state bringing the drugs in it's so corrupt now it
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:21.000]  snatches little kids i mean it's just people have no idea that just all around them is pure evil
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:27.560]  and then paul i just don't know what to do i mean this is this is incredible well it's people
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.840]  wouldn't have believed that the federal government would have hired goons to fill up kids and you
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:38.360]  know get on buses and interrogate people but it's happening it's happening right now so stop living
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:45.400]  in denial paul watson i want to come back and give you two or three minutes to finish any other
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:51.160]  points you've made but just incredible points so far help us save this country in the world folks

[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:21.480]  all right i wanted paul watson just to give you a general briefing on this plan this is
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:28.600]  not a contingency plan it is the manual of the takeover of america and the arrest of political
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.360]  dissidents that don't want to go along with the new world order we have all the other training
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:38.680]  manuals of who they're going after uh it's gun owners conservatives libertarians returning
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:45.000]  veterans retired police officers uh anybody who isn't going to go along with total socialism
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.160]  leading into communism but again run by big banks who are offshore who want to destroy the economy
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:56.680]  reeducate the population transfer the wealth to themselves and then come in with a fake revolution
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:01.800]  like with the russians and call it free market but where everybody's poor except for a tiny elite
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:08.840]  that's really the model is they they they bring in the socialism then the communism then that
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.480]  implodes and they bring in fascism uh and of course in the colleges the globalists have
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:18.440]  financed and run they don't teach that they teach socialism and communism are at odds with fascism
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.160]  but in all the top globalist documents that i've read and things written by people like
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:28.680]  carol quigley tragedy and hope who's one of their top historians he explains that fascism
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:34.760]  or neo feudalistic serfdom control sits atop the socialist combine then they bring in the red
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.480]  terror kami level next we're getting ready for that they would like to bring it in the fact
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.760]  that we're here raising the alarm may back it off again if you just joined us i'm alex jones this is

[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.400]  in europe i covered some of that at the start of the last hour but none of that is important
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.400]  compared to the giant police state that's being rolled out now that's been built behind the scenes
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.560]  reeducation camp manual includes rules on isolating political prisoners document also
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:20.200]  describes slave labor paul uses the term forced labor and under fema the ten regions under the
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:27.400]  ma fema core all of this the clergy response teams the infra guard the citizen spies it's for
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:38.040]  the american people it isn't for al cia to al qaeda al cia duh al qaeda is run by the cia duh
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:45.000]  al cia duh the cia doesn't work for the united states it works for the foreign banks on record
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.840]  that's what's happened europe's been conquered by goldman sacks we've been conquered through fraud
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:56.040]  and they plan on using total police state to enforce their capture the united states has
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.840]  been captured they're now moving in to try to censor the web and talk radio they're now trying
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.720]  to mop up the resistance i got news for them too late we already sent out the emergency
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:13.000]  transmissions and don't look at the mall martians and the zombies out there and thank you've got
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.240]  america beaten there is a large core of people that quite frankly is growing it's over 25 percent
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.840]  that is really figuring out what's going on there's about five percent that's super hard core
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:30.600]  25 percent is accelerating their awakening 40 to 50 percent is someone awake congress is a
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.840]  nine percent approval rating most people though have just given up and just said that's a bunch of
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:45.240]  crooks and it's time to give the number out i want to hear from police and military i've told you
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:50.360]  all this was coming i told you tsa on the streets was coming i told you that your appliances were
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.080]  surveilling you it was in all the patents and admitted i told you all this is now admitted
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.400]  all this is now admitted what do we do now that i've been proven right not because i'm smart it's
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:08.520]  all public i saw them say the g um 20 in pittsburgh was the model for the rest of the world i saw
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.800]  them 12 years ago 13 years ago and 99 say no free speech in seattle on video
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.840]  the first amendment has been suspended they said it on the news and on loudspeakers i've witnessed
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:28.360]  it everywhere they do these little mini martial laws and bring cops in from everywhere to test
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:33.800]  and make sure when they set off some nukes or something or release a bio weapon and pose
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:39.160]  his saviors on the news to make sure you go along with it and they're going to have fake militia
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:45.320]  groups attack local police and people to get the war started to get the civil war started just
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:50.680]  like the globalist blew up shiite and suny mosque to get each other killing each other in iraq that
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.400]  was part of that plan that's been declassified they're planning on this are we going to do it

[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.440]  they're going to be the big terror group well i guess when you try to take their kids and put
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.320]  them in reeducation camps they're going to start killing people and they're going to be called
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:38.760]  terrorist understand that's the plan they're going to start fights with the american people
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:43.160]  and back us into corners and when we defend ourselves we're going to be called terrorists
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.800]  well let me tell you who the terrorists are it's the stinking foreign occupational government
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.960]  we've got that paid 20 plus billion dollars to move general motors factories overseas
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.720]  the terrorists of the people that have had the autism rate go from 1 in 25 000 to 1 in 58
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:03.000]  the terrorists of the people but you're in our bill of rights a constitution all right i'm done

[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.360]  with the system because of peer pressure because you think you'll be safe doing that
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.120]  because you're they plan on eliminating the patriots in this country and the police and
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:34.760]  military by having us kill each other that's the globalist model is divide and conquer i don't want
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.880]  to be part of this but it's clear now looking at the tea leaves looking at all the signs that are
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:47.960]  there one of the main options one of the main cards in the globalist hand in their fist is
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:55.560]  staged terror attacks starting provocations and going for a gun confiscation to start a civil war
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.600]  the nra's milk toast folks and they came out last year and said yes they've got internal
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:06.920]  memos and documents that obama plans to quote band guns that's the headline in his next term
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.240]  well romney'll do it too let me tell you something they they knew the city and romney tells people
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:17.320]  turn their guns in a lot of marr all right going back to watch and watch and give people a final
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:22.680]  briefing we're gonna go to break and come back with phone calls well i found a definition on
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:29.480]  reeducation camps and it's reeducation through labor also called lao jiao a form of penal
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:35.720]  detention in china or the soviet gulags for quote reeducation of class enemies and reintegrating
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:42.600]  them through labor into the soviet society and in this manual this army manual that applies to
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:50.600]  u.s citizens it says that the syop team will be responsible for quote using indoctrination programs
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:56.280]  to reduce or remove antagonistic attitudes as well as targeting quote political activists
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:02.600]  with such indoctrination programs to provide quote understanding and appreciation of u.s
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:10.600]  policies and actions and then as i said earlier page 281 it says um reorienting or reeducating
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:19.080]  the i r facility population is again a role of the syop officer so admitted reeducation camps
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:27.080]  forced labor camps applies to u.s citizens and yet nothing whatsoever in the mainstream media
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:33.080]  people should take these articles and just bombard a b c c n n all of them with these articles and
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:39.560]  say are you going to cover this what if president asad in syria was uh advocating forced labor
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:45.720]  camps reeducation camps for the the rebels the glorious al-qaeda rebels do you think they cover
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.680]  it then well of course they would but they're not covering it now because this applies in america
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:56.680]  it's a direct threat and it's another glaring example of how america is turning into a militarized
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.960]  police state and by the way i've talked to the troops but i've seen it myself in an
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:05.160]  m it magazine they brag everything done in iraq with checkpoints face scans all of that
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:11.400]  national i d cards that's the model for western countries we are the enemy the bankers run our
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:16.680]  military and and and they're coming in with a system where our entire country is a giant
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:25.000]  reeducation camp yeah that's why they've got 9300 checkpoints they had last year tsa's getting
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.280]  more funding they're gonna have even more checkpoints this year and what's iraq full of checkpoints
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:37.000]  because he's an occupied country america is fast becoming an occupied country every new movie i watch
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.440]  that's an action movie is they say oh just a routine checkpoint in the countryside in the city
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:48.440]  they show every movie i see now checkpoints and they always say oh just a routine checkpoint
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.560]  that's government propaganda placement in all the shows i mean to folks do you realize how deep
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:18:00.600]  we are in this we're under total psychological warfare attack this is a vicious assault this is
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:06.200]  a very aggressive assault and again they don't want us to raise the alarm before the provocation
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:11.800]  event they roll it out that's why they won't cover it they don't want this out until they stage the
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:20.120]  terror attack yeah with the fbi fomenting every domestic terror attack we see you know getting
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:25.400]  the patsy in to start it all off then it's a it's a very real possibility seeing as they've been
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.840]  caught behind every major domestic terror attack in the last five ten years and it's a mirror in
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.160]  england they're putting in all the same legislation there and just said yeah we listened and watched
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.960]  everything you do without warrants in england that's all over your news as well exact same system
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.520]  yeah it's a it's a uniform program which is why you see the same things that roughly the same
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:52.040]  time happening uh in europe and america global government banker run
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:57.960]  yeah goldman sacks rules the world well you know i've always tried to fix things
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.360]  but i mean i gotta tell everybody folks you can't go to reeducation camp and when and when they started
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:06.840]  it's going to be some unpopular group and and and they're going to you know beta test it well
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.880]  you know plus you know we have the emergency centers act because things are collapsing that's
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:15.960]  how they're going to roll it out as the millions of homeless are going to be in them at first but
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:20.280]  then they're going to force everybody else into them they're going to have a a prison section go
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:27.880]  ahead well the dhs has already established camps for the threat of mass migration and that was
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:34.760]  outlined in rex 84 so yeah and as you've documented in texas they've they've already got camps for
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:38.920]  illegal immigrants so they'll start it out on illegals and people will support it and then
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:43.560]  they'll extend it from there well that's what they admit they're planning to do thank you watson

[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:28.280]  that's how the scyop works of course the truth is people are waking up and we actually fall into
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:33.160]  the scyop watson was doing it even responding to people in denial those who are going to be in
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.800]  denial and those that run the scyop who give on trade to them they're just giving cowards
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:42.600]  an opportunity to not look at the facts we know this is tyranny we know everything happening
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:48.600]  is part of a police state takeover and we better start reversing it and take our states back
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.800]  it's just that simple and and we get the word out that we don't just have a nasty corrupt
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:25:02.200]  government we have a really wicked government it's not a government it is a occupation by a foreign
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:09.160]  force of criminals okay we've got matt and washington police officer david who's navy listening
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:15.160]  on an ipod we got jesse military army we're gonna go to everybody here in just a moment we got dan
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:21.960]  and others let's go to matt who is a police officer uh what do you make of it i mean forced labor
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:27.640]  camps slave camps reeducation camps for libertarians and conservatives i mean that's the american way
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:35.480]  isn't it well i fall into that category alex so i guess i'll be in the camp too wow well i guess if
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.920]  they just take enough of us away to the camp though they think everybody'll just get in line and say
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:44.600]  okay i love world government well i'm telling you right now whether i'm in uniform or not i'm
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:49.640]  going to fight them i'm not going to that camp so they better get prepared i want to tell you
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:56.040]  something uh i know uh a couple months ago um as you know our our our economy is so called
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:01.320]  collapsing and our city uh is going through a financial situation we're running the black but
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.960]  we're down to the bare bones and we had a meeting with our city administrator and assistant city
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:11.720]  administrator and they were talking about how uh we needed to write more tickets uh to bring in
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.720]  more revenue because that was the difference between getting a new patrol car or not and i
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:20.840]  piped up and said hey we haven't had a new patrol car in four years and we're not revenue generating
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:26.280]  police officers and we're not going to do that well then uh a couple weeks later they pulled the
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.000]  chief in and said hey we're going to give a thousand dollar bonus to ever write the most tickets
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:39.000]  and uh he said no we're not going to do that so we do stick up uh you know we do stick up and
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.040]  tell our administrators no i know they're good police all of them i know listen i know they're
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.840]  good police all over the country that's what's been holding it look look i've had this epiphany
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.680]  and of course it's it's common sense but it's it's so clear to me you have a tiny criminal
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.480]  elite at the top who can only operate because all of us are naive about how evil they are
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:03.480]  and then they've got all these pr rollouts for why they do things and they're trying to get us to go
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.560]  along with them but people didn't go along with torture people aren't going along with world
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:13.480]  government but they but the globalists don't care they're just pushing i mean how do you think they
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:18.840]  try to get away with putting people in a reeducation camp i mean that shows how radical and nuts these
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:26.600]  people are and alex this is why we have to come together and tell them no because when we do they
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:32.920]  back down it's when we don't say anything and we go along with the program then they they went so
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:37.080]  it starts at the local level you tell them no we're not going to do it they're not going to fire
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:42.600]  olivia we stood together as a brotherhood i come from the department about 15 men and we told them
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:49.480]  no and you know what they're leaving us alone well that's the problem some of these big departments
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:55.400]  are totally federally run and they just do whatever they want but it is it is crazy anything
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:00.920]  else you'd like to add no i'd just like to tell my uh fellow brothers and sisters out there
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.880]  maybe those are on the fence listen wake up i've been a police officer for 15 years i've
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:11.080]  listened to alex for almost two years he knows what he's talking about listen we don't take
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:15.320]  people's word for it we research it go out there and research it look at his website read everything
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:20.280]  that's on there and then research it yourself it's real we need to stand behind this guy and listen
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:28.440]  we need to take back this country freedom let freedom rings thanks alex thank you look i'm
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:34.840]  um i'm standing beside behind everybody else too i look i wish this wasn't real i wish i wasn't the
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:45.480]  guy on air i wish so badly that we could reverse this but these globalists are so powerful and so
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:52.360]  rich this is their entertainment it's like the world is a risk board to them and and and this is
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:29:03.640]  their fun they play with our lives like we're little toys and the reality is so crazy that i know
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:10.760]  why people don't want to believe it because i can't believe it when i've gone to countless urban
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:15.960]  warfare drills that are public and i witnessed the military training to confiscate guns and then
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:25.480]  i saw them do it in new orleans and then now i see them admitting it and then i see people in denial
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:31.960]  there's this long-term program to turn the military and police against us i know i don't believe i know
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:37.960]  it's backfired to a certain extent because the propaganda is so ridiculous when they get police
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:44.520]  behind closed doors and tell them the founding fathers are bad that people go what so so the
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:52.440]  globalists are so over the top that it may actually wake people up we're on the march the empires on

[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:58.440]  what special forces now in the national guard gerald in arkansas um what is your take on the
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:06.040]  official army manual for operations in the us for reeducation camps and slave labor uh am i
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:12.280]  anti-american for not thinking that north korean style government is the way to go absolutely you're
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:20.280]  not what is your view on this sir i'm uh hundred percent against it and when the ndaa passed on
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:26.040]  a new year's eve i started my own youtube channel and started uh video blogging about
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:31.720]  why this was wrong and why military members need to wake up and uh start thinking about getting out
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:41.320]  of the service breakdown from your perspective uh i mean they've always been getting the camps ready
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:45.320]  the last 20 years but now they've accelerated their construction that's on record but now
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:49.960]  admitting their reeducation camps i mean i've been to the drills and seeing them doing this
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:55.640]  type of stuff but this is admission this as one commenter said i was saying this is an indictment
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:01.000]  they convict themselves and the commenter on my video i shot this morning titled army to
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.120]  oversee torture and slave labor in america uh the commenter if i could fill the top comment
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:14.120]  up there said this isn't a manual this is a confession yeah i'm pretty pretty amazed that
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:20.680]  they uh came out and so blatantly uh spelled out the fact that this is for uh american citizens
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:27.960]  as well as operations overseas so i i don't know if they're uh getting more overconfident or if they're
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:33.160]  somebody who's writing the manuals might be saying well maybe if we put it out there a
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.840]  little like this uh maybe people will start waking up i don't know well undoubtedly
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:44.440]  i've had national media tell me look i really like what you're doing but they'll never let me
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:51.560]  publish it uh if i don't attack you a little bit and they're so arrogant and stupid these globalist
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:57.560]  above me that as long as i just throw a few names in and and make a few jokes they think that's
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:03.560]  effective i know it's not and then the article comes out and actually helps us so i've had multiple
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:09.240]  national publications were off record they say listen i'm on your side uh so i mean it's already
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:19.480]  happening it's already happening absolutely and uh on that note um i want to point something
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:26.360]  out that's happening to me um i've been out of work since audits of last year and i've been
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:31.640]  applying for jobs applying for jobs and with my resume and background nobody's given me the time
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:37.000]  of day which is leading me to think that perhaps homeland security is blacklisting veterans
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:42.680]  especially ones that might be speaking out well no they said that in the new system you won't get
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:48.520]  a job unless homeland security says it's a no fly no gun buy and if we give into that and say okay
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:53.400]  i'll do what you say i won't have a job that's what the soviets did when they occupy a place first
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:58.840]  the nazis did that and if you give in you lose everything these are terrorists and that's why
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:05.400]  uh they're bringing in this classical system i mean we have the attorney general saying he
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.840]  meets with the media heads to brainwash the american people against the second amendment
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:18.760]  i mean they all they see themselves as brainwashers every action movie that i rent or buy because i've
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:23.800]  got an old treadmill and an old dvd player people are like get it on netflix the point is every movie
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:32.920]  i see when i jog in the garage every morning every action movie i watch now every one has
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:39.800]  checkpoints in them and black uniforms and has someone say what's this oh just a routine checkpoint
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:47.800]  i keep forgetting the name of the latest movie it's got uh it's it's it's not salt which is really
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:53.960]  stupid uh it and then that's got checkpoints all over it uh it's got a chick who's a marine who's
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:59.560]  a private contractor trying to save a hostage uh and then they actually kill the hostage and try
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:04.760]  to set her up and then she's running through you know like colorada and the ice and she's and
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.400]  they drop to a checkpoint she says what's this and the guy says oh just a routine checkpoint
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:15.960]  i mean folks that is there in every movie how creepy in america we have collaborators in the
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:22.440]  media implanting messages to acclimate everyone to checkpoints everywhere and all these movies
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:27.320]  they're showing the government searching houses without warrants and the cia director comes out
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:32.120]  and says we're spying on you without warrants that's illegal on two fronts spying about a
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:37.240]  warrants illegal and the cia domestically is illegal but again they're throwing it in our face
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:44.520]  why do you think that is gerald they're just trying to show us that they're the dominant animal and
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:52.680]  that we are the submissive and we need to accept our place and again i could see being a coward and
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:58.040]  rolling over and working with the system if it was just boss odd corrupt it's not these are you
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:03.800]  genesis who are spiking the food and water and i've published republished and linked
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:09.720]  to the Rockefeller the white house science are all of them they're doing it you can't make a deal
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:14.600]  with them if i hear one more person call me and say you have such courage we admire you no i don't
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:20.520]  no i do not this is self-preservation folks you don't make a deal with these people
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:27.880]  it's a slow soft kill all we can do is all in and before look if they're talking about gagging
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.120]  and torturing people to keep them quiet in the reeducation centers let's fight them in the larger
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:37.800]  reeducation camp that is america and and and fight them with asymmetrical info war at the
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:44.520]  grassroots level everywhere and let's advertise local groups to start businesses or work together
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:49.480]  to hire veterans you know let's do things like that because what they do is they cycle what
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:52.600]  happens sir is they psychologically tested you when you're in the military undoubtedly
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.400]  they have a file on what decisions you made they've got algorithms on what you do they have a file
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:02.760]  vets that are awake are the ultimate enemy vets that are doubly do right do whatever they
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.520]  they're told are recruited into policing but a lot of those actually wake up later the globalists
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:14.280]  have a big problem they're able to loot the country of 27 plus trillion dollars the last few years
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:18.840]  they're able to gut things shut down the industry they're in control of that but they're not in
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:25.080]  control right at the local level you understand they still haven't made everybody immoral yet
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:30.680]  that's their final problem they've got we've got to hit them at every level anything else
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:39.080]  uh yes um i'm a writer as well and i joined the army in 1986 so i could research what it's
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:43.480]  what's what it's like to be a a soldier so i could create the character that would be uh
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:47.320]  you know a soldier would pick up the book and read and say this guy's been there
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:54.600]  and my uh publishing website is bluefalconpress.com and i also want to point out about jobs getting
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.200]  jobs in america i have been on so many websites applying for jobs and you have to go through
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:07.960]  a psyche valve as part of your application were you aware of that yeah and and you know they
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:14.200]  integrate it and and it's mentally ill to be moral i appreciate your call no we're living
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:19.160]  in a giant reeducation camp i mean the system admits that they've only got it turned up though
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:23.080]  you know three clicks on the stove it can go all the way up to 12
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.760]  and they're just turning the heat up turning the heat up turning the heat up turning the heat up
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:37.160]  man it's bad let's go to uh jesse in new orleans former u.s army to give us his take on this go
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:48.680]  ahead hello jesse okay jesse he's away from his phone thank you jesse uh let's go to david who is
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:56.200]  navy listening on an ipod or ipod go ahead you're on the air how you doing alex uh great to be on
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:01.960]  i'm really fired up out there i could tell you now uh the military really appreciate what you're
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:08.520]  doing for us well thank you what's your view on on america secretly trying to adopt the people
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:15.800]  that have hijacked america a north korean model i'm disgusted with it and uh i can tell you this
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:22.440]  it really it really boggles my mind with what was coming out with bray barton the whole uh
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:27.960]  underground weather group and how they were this was their plan this was their plan that's what
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:33.240]  bright bar was going to come out with was obama at meetings talking about reeducation he dies
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.160]  and they released some flimsy thing a few weeks later nothing to do with what he said
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.280]  and now the coroner's dead i mean how obvious does this have to get
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:46.760]  this being active duty there's only the you obviously know that there's some stuff i can't
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:53.000]  say it but i you it really it's mind-blowing it really is do people really need to start opening
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.400]  their eyes see what's going on what you're saying is is what we're talking about is accurate from what
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:05.240]  you've seen it's absolutely accurate and you know something there like you say the minority
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:10.920]  the difference it's never the majority no matter where it is what i would really like to see is
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:17.160]  somebody see i will go back and i'll do the research on myself on my own and see what
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:22.200]  where the links are but i think for somebody's got to link everything from the raw child and
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:26.760]  waterloo all the way up to what we're seeing right now so the average person that doesn't
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:31.640]  want to go out and do the research can just see it all in line how it yeah we need to produce
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:38.040]  like a 10 minute graphical you know animated i think i was just thinking about that this weekend
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:43.640]  and starting the peace out showing a risk set and saying you know people play this as children
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:48.760]  or in college but there's a real game for world government and break down how the bankers have
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:54.120]  done it and again it's not just like they want to conquer us and then have a civilization they
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:59.240]  want to kill everybody is what's horrible i mean once they get their world government in place
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:08.280]  katie bar the door exactly well obviously you can't talk about classified stuff but uh
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.960]  i mean have i mean now that it's public have you seen similar manuals to this for
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:20.600]  reeducation camps in america personally have not seen it but what really i wonder why no other
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:25.960]  like drudge usually will cover almost anything you have i wonder why it's not this is big news
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:31.320]  this really should be on every major news network out there i'm pretty surprised that drudge hasn't
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:38.440]  linked it yet well again nobody's perfect we make mistakes sometimes and something this shocking even
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:42.920]  though it is triplicate confirmed with the whole background information i'll guarantee you drudge
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:49.160]  is probably waiting with something like this until um so-called mainstream media covers it
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:53.800]  and you notice they're not that i mean they didn't cover the ndaa the first few weeks we're running
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:58.040]  around freaking out drudge did cover that and then they said no it's not for citizens they
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:04.120]  went oh it is for citizens but obama's not gonna sign it i mean people didn't believe it the first
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:11.960]  few days when obama came out and said congress doesn't it isn't over war anymore drudge did
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.160]  cover that but yeah we'll see what happens god bless you sir i appreciate your call
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:21.640]  well let's talk to rudy in washington dc marine corps uh what do you make of uh re-education camps
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:26.360]  i mean north korea is not so bad maybe george washington would have loved kim jong-il huh
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:35.240]  no exactly uh i think it's unbelievable and uh as far as here in dc uh from what i've seen uh
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:41.320]  haven't seen anything you know too close to uh re-education camps but we have been doing a lot
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:48.040]  of uh riot control uh training stuff like that and uh yeah i'm just calling the uh for support
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:54.760]  i want you to know that uh i got i got uh i'm trying to get the news out here uh with the marines here
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:04.440]  um i'm trying to get the word out and uh i'm a big fan of of you uh there's a guy named how lindy
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:09.880]  uh he has a lot of good information and ron paul ron paul huge supporter ron paul how many marines
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:19.160]  you talked to are somewhat awake from you know not not tons but you know there are guys like me
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:25.320]  who are out there spreading the word and uh that's good news look to break down how they're
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:31.480]  going to do this economy keeps collapsing that they're basically moving towards the poor house
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:35.400]  model that england had where they're going to lock up the homeless people this is already happening
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.160]  where they won't let you sleep or camp anywhere but then they lock you up at night facilities
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:44.920]  then there's crime so then there's low security prison areas then there's areas for political
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:49.560]  dissidents that's what this breaks down the regular military just does riot control
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:55.160]  and then during the hysteria political dissidents get picked up who are blamed for it
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:00.440]  they're loaded on the trucks and taken to the facilities and then it's specialized people
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:06.440]  who do you think the army and marine corps hired to run prison camps they'd have regular marines
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:12.360]  and army on the outside but in the inner dungeons they would hire disgraced federal and state prison
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:17.800]  guards as contractors or they would hire them and get them into the military and grease the skids
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:23.400]  for them and and and that's who they hire that's who they want so see that's how this compartmentalization
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:30.840]  works so i'm a low down guy so you know i'm not up there i'm not too high in the ring so i mean i
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:37.800]  wouldn't know a ton but here low down in the the enlisted film uh i got guys you know like i said
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:41.880]  i'm i'm getting the word out there and there are some guys and you know at first they'll start to
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:46.440]  they kind of they kind of just stay away from it because i don't know they have other things on
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:52.200]  their mind like you know going out already and drinking and stuff like that but uh you know i
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:56.440]  kind of feel like it's it's almost scary to them so it's so scary they don't want to believe it and
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.080]  they kind of just distance themselves from it but when they really start learning about it and you
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:04.600]  really start feeding them the information it starts making sense they start to hey you know they
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:09.960]  start getting a little interested and they start listening and uh well here's the deal history is
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:16.360]  scary and if you look what the founders talked about they went through all of this as well they
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:23.000]  had reeducation camps i'm sorry go ahead oh no go ahead it's uh yeah i was just saying that uh
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.400]  uh you know once once it's all about really getting that information to them uh they got to read it
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:34.760]  for themselves as a thing you know that's right and we've got to counter all this so that as it gets
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.920]  phased into your level people have already heard about it and instead of accepting it they know
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:47.400]  it's bad see that's why we're holding this thing back info wars.com listeners of this show the

[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:04.840]  attention gun owners as you know liberal politicians and activist judges are out
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:10.120]  to take away our second amendment rights and it's no secret that they want to use ammo regulation
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:16.360]  to do so this is why it's so important to start ammo now but storing ammo can cause significant
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:21.880]  problems because ammo is still prone to deterioration over time like tarnishing brass surfaces that get
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:26.200]  rough and dirty which don't allow them to feed right and even the breakdown of the gunpowder
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:31.800]  all problems which can cause a firing malfunction when you need it most now for the first time ever
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:37.640]  you can buy ammo the last forever ready reserve ammo's patent-penning nitrogen preservation system

[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:40.920]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are back live here and you know why the globalists want to
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:45.080]  use mercenaries you know why they want to use foreign troops it's because they are going to
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:51.160]  have trouble getting our police and military to carry out these activities that's why the feds
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:55.720]  are creating all these new bureaucracies to harass and fine and feed people and they're going into
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:04.120]  organic food stores with guns drawn it's old part of implying that the people are bad
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:13.160]  and the system is good think about how many times i told you there was a plan to microchip
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:19.160]  us military personnel and now that's in the news today in fact guys i had all those articles
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:25.480]  yesterday will you reprint them and put them in the catherine albric bio for me ahead of her joining
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:31.320]  us because i may have one for her but i don't see one here and i know she was set up last minute
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:36.600]  but i i probably need to uh need to get that i mean i know there's all this world news and i've
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:41.800]  been spending most of the time the last three four shows on the prison camp situation because
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:46.680]  here it is admitting that these emergency centers are for reeducation of the american people i mean
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.960]  that's that's like them digging up bodies in your next door neighbor's backyard it's it's a big deal
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:58.520]  and again uh the story is extremely viral on the web but i could care less about that just so
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:03.000]  info wars gets a bunch of traffic at least it's waking up some people but we need to punch this
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.720]  out the reason they don't want this to break and the reason the system's fighting to keep this
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.040]  from becoming a big news story the reason we're going to keep beating the drum to make sure it
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:18.440]  does break through is because it's going to be a big story i mean this is going to wake a lot of
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:25.240]  people up if we have a national debate about reeducation camps and slave labor in army manuals
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:32.280]  for us citizens i know my psi ops hit us day one saying it wasn't real i understand
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:41.960]  wow look at this headline revealed us secretly releasing top taliban insurgents
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:45.960]  in exchange for peace pledges that's what they tell them they really retrain them and send them
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:51.640]  to other countries like syria and again i think of the general public how how how not even ignorant
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:58.440]  just how unawake they are when i hear national news this weekend on xm i was listening to fox
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:05.240]  seeing in all of it quite a bit when i was driving and it was always the same a sod's bed he well the
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:11.560]  ceasefire isn't doing well it would imply he'd broken it and then admit that well there are
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:18.120]  government buildings getting blown up yeah that's that bad a sod al qaeda on record real al qaeda
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:26.440]  is in their western backed blowing stuff up to break the ceasefire so the un can come in and
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:33.000]  take over the country just like they did libya and it's such a crime that's being committed
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:37.640]  let's go to dan and george i got about a minute and a half before we got a break i go ahead to dan
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:46.120]  navy uh what's your view on all this i will not go to a retraining camp it's just not something
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:51.720]  i'm going to do i've made my peace with the lord and i will fight when the time comes well that's
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:55.080]  because you're a terrorist i mean how dare you not want to go to a reeducation camp they're good
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:58:03.000]  in north korea well the chances of coming out alive and and and one piece not very good from
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.480]  for me people like me you don't want to be in there with about 100 tsa guys having their way with you
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:14.440]  that doesn't sound fun no because i get firsthand information from a tsa friend and and there's a
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:20.040]  lot going on out there that we never hear about and oh really tell me what you're gonna get because
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:23.240]  there's a couple different types there's ones that just want to paycheck but then there's
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:27.400]  the manager types who get you keep getting caught in every crime you can imagine drug dealing
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:32.920]  child molesting raping murder i mean and now they're oh by the way it's admitted they don't
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:41.800]  even do a background check now it's like hey felons come on stalin did it why not you are

[02:00:54.440 --> 02:01:00.520]  cancer that he got from the machines at the alana airport oh and i took some of your articles and
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:06.920]  emailed him to him and it created uh an uproar at the alana airport see we've got to do that
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:13.160]  people don't know how they can take all our articles by the way we had john hopkins that they
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:17.080]  they have cancer clusters for eight years they've had naked body scanners in boston
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:23.080]  and they covered it up seven fold increase in cancer of the tsa workers and so it created an
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:28.200]  uproar huh when they got those messages well yes uh they had a lot of people that's gotten
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:34.120]  sick and disappeared and a lot of them did get cancer they know of but uh well let me stop you're
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:40.440]  right there that's why austin they want to squeeze people they're scanning everybody in austin
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:44.040]  they're being particularly mean because they know that's what the legislatures are
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:47.880]  and because they fought them literally the feds are showing us but it doesn't matter
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:52.520]  those are all walking dead so go ahead and laugh at us you're all dead your bosses are
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:58.360]  going to radiate you well i'm sorry to hear about your friend well he's a good guy and uh he feeds
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:05.400]  me information like uh just the other week there was uh 25 chili and soldiers come through the
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:11.880]  airport wearing civilian clothes and uh they had to call him because there are their rifles
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:17.880]  were not locked they didn't even have a key to lock their rifles up and uh he had to
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:22.280]  go and try to find a way to lock their rifles right foreigners are allowed to have guns
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:27.160]  citizens are scum at that again in the new america the new reeducation camp america
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:33.880]  we're the bad guys anybody else is good and and he feels that uh american people just aren't
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:40.440]  going to wake up but we still got hope well i bashed the tsa a lot because of the leadership
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.760]  of it and everything but again despite all the things i say about them half the time they go

[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:27.240]  okay ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us into this hour it is the seventh day of may
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:34.440]  2012 on this monday edition we have a wonderful planet a wonderful country there are good people
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:39.880]  all across this world the good people outnumber the bad people but if you watch the news everything
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:45.400]  is childlike everything is done in a joking way except when they get real serious and talk to
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:50.920]  you like you're a child and say the government wants to keep you safe well what is the government
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:58.120]  it's not the country and when the government goes bad you get tyranny when the people fear the
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:02.920]  government there is tyranny when the government fears the people there is liberty thomas jefferson
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:10.120]  said that george washington said similar things and this is really common sense that we're talking
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:17.880]  about here my friends this is common sense and it's time to warn everyone you know and say no
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:22.440]  to the tyranny i mean i remember just to show how our state department has changed it's been corrupt
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:28.040]  for a long time but a decade or so ago the state department put out reports about china putting
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:35.160]  baby parts in cosmetics and selling political dissidents organs and then a few years later
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:40.920]  they put out a piece debunking conspiracy theories with no facts and said that it was a conspiracy
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:46.280]  theory that china sold political dissidents organs or used baby parts uh for different
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:52.120]  medicines and cosmetics not mentioning that the state department previously had talked about it
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:58.360]  i mean the state department doesn't criticize chinese human rights abuses on any front now
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:06.680]  to speak of and now china uses us as the model saying we're going to pass our own india to
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:13.960]  secretly arrest citizens uh we're going to do all of this and it's no big deal and they said
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:18.040]  because america did now let me show you another article that we're going to go to our guest
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:23.640]  thousands of pills 17 000 to be exact filled with powdered human baby flesh discovered by
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:28.840]  customs officials in south korea the and this is just one shipment the pills are very popular
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:35.000]  women think it makes them beautiful many of the top cosmetic companies this came out many years
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.720]  ago in france are getting it from babies that have been killed in china but folks most of
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:45.800]  vaccines you take are grown on dead fetal tissue i mean and again i'd cover this and be called a
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:51.320]  conspiracy terrorist because people couldn't believe this was happening they just say oh you
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:59.560]  know what you're making it up you're making it up it's not real you're making it up our government
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:08.280]  would never do something like that but all these governments are doing it i mean i just read where
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:14.680]  human rights aid from england is being used to forcibly sterilize people in india all of this
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:21.560]  is giant covert operations going on domestically now again i heard this last year and didn't
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:25.800]  believe it and went and looked it up and sure enough it was true and then earlier this year
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:30.760]  it was in january a federal court ruled that shareholders aren't allowed to be involved in
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.960]  the decisions or allowed to know exactly what they're doing with the baby parts in pepsi but one
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:39.960]  of our listeners heard me mention this at the first the show and has made a graphic to now
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:45.560]  posted at info wars dot com on the front page if you want to see it it says uh it shows a pepsi
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:51.640]  bottle with a uh fetus you know being dropped down on top of it uh imitating some of their real
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:12:06.200]  ads and it says now with dead fetus cells refresh your world with dead fetus cells for the flavoring
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:12.200]  well industries want to take a byproduct and make it profitable and you got millions of
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:18.280]  abortions a year here you got tens of millions in china i mean i mean the number is astronomical
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:23.400]  and so they want to do something with it and so now you've got white house advisors and others
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:29.400]  and top bioethesis coming out and saying babies are like mackerel that's a quote by peter singer
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:34.360]  let's kill them up to age three and then the big bioethesis board comes out and says you know what
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:39.240]  since you know the kids most of them are going to be born autistic or mentally retarded from all
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:48.760]  the stuff we're doing to them let's just start killing them from one in 25 000 to one in 58
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:55.480]  so they're talking in four to five years one out of nine to ten and then a few years after that
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:02.280]  will be every one out of three and they're like everything's fine everything's good the government
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:08.280]  loves you take some more shots and here's another article out of the Daily Mail watch what you type
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:14.680]  surveillance cameras so strong they can zoom in to read text messages now i wanted to get Catherine
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:22.280]  albert on because i saw a article in world that daily and i saw a couple others in the
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:27.720]  business insider and others and sure enough went over to DARPA that's who funds over 90 percent of
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:33.400]  the university technology training and and and research and there they are saying what i knew
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:38.680]  a long time ago they've been chipping some of the special forces and officers for a long time
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:43.240]  and and heads of state and other countries that's been in the news there's been rollouts to chip
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:51.720]  old people and there's been rollouts uh to do things like uh chipping prisoners that was in
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:55.640]  Reuters and then it got pulled in california they signed a contract what six years ago to that but
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:14:00.760]  then there was such a backlash it got pulled so the point is oh you want to get in the cool Baja
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:05.240]  Beach Club you got to have a microchip that was going on six seven years ago but now they're coming
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:12.280]  out saying yeah for their safety for their medical reasons they need a chip so again all this is
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:15.560]  happening i wanted to get her on about that but first i wanted to throw this at her with the
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:22.040]  internet censorship syspa all this Catherine what do you make of the CIA director a month and a half
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:29.240]  ago admitting that they're building tech in to all the major appliances dishwashers computer
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:35.480]  cell phones to track and listen to everybody why do you think they're getting so brazen
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:39.320]  we're just six years ago bush would lie and say we're not spying on without warrants
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:43.800]  and now it's just get used to it what what do you think is happening why
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:48.680]  why are they doing this right now again Catherine albert who's a host on this network needs no
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:56.680]  no introduction she's also a doctor from harvard in these areas of research and of course you can
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:01.960]  find out more at catherinealdrick.com what do you make of all this Catherine why are they coming
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:05.800]  out in the open well you know it's funny isn't it Alex because you and i have been warning people
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:11.080]  about this for over a decade saying yo it's coming and people say oh no come on that's that you know
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:16.680]  you're you're you're jumping the gun it's just theoretical it's just proposals it's just patent
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:20.760]  filings they're never actually going to do it and you know it was a couple of years ago something
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:24.280]  actually occurred to me Alex and i figured out how they do this and i'm sure you've also figured
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:32.040]  this out probably long before i did that first they'll accuse you of pine the sky you know that'll
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:36.360]  never happen slippery slope you're imagining things you're a conspiracy theorist but they
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:41.480]  floated out there anyway they floated out in the hollywood movies they floated out in these
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:46.200]  proposals they floated out in these weird news articles oftentimes i've had to correct a lot
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:51.160]  of them because they're simply flat wrong about there was one Reuters put out there was picked
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:56.840]  up by hundreds of different news outlets that in mexico the attorney general was microchipping
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:01.320]  his staff and i actually you know went back and tracked it down and it wasn't hundreds of people
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:05.880]  like they'd said it was only a handful and anyway so they they give you kind of they do it to
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:10.520]  normalize it like hey everybody's getting a chip but see what's interesting about it though Alex
[02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:16.600]  is when they first put it out there and then you pursue it it turns out to not be true so the people
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:21.320]  who are banging the gong and going look out this is terrifying all wind up with egg on their face
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:25.240]  they say no it's not happening this is hollywood or no that wasn't a hundred people that was three
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:32.040]  people what's wrong with you and once it gets into the public psychology and because what 97%
[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:36.200]  of people are sitting there glued to their televisions all day long once it gets into your
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:42.200]  psyche and you can overcome that initial reluctance and that initial feeling of revulsion that everybody
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:47.160]  feels by saying oh no it's not really real then you wait a couple of years then you turn around
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:52.440]  and you do it for real and people are past that initial resistance and at that point people start
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:57.560]  saying oh yeah you know that old thing and so what what i've what i've come to understand is you're
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:03.480]  either jumping the gun or you're beating a dead horse but there's never a correct time to criticize
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:09.400]  the technology and they've wired the game in such a way they've rigged it so we're either too early
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:15.640]  or we're too late that's right they phased it in or now it's like so they're setting up re-education
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:22.040]  camps to slave labor i mean what of course they are we need them that's right that's right so when
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:26.840]  you when you but when you first say it and they want to dismiss you you're a nut and it's impossible
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:33.080]  but but yeah you'll notice that they talk about it a lot you know it's it's not like it's quiet it gets
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:37.880]  talked about but laughed at ridiculed so it gets into people's heads gets into their subconscious
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:42.520]  and gets accepted even though people think they're resisting it and i'll give you a great example the
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:47.960]  movie minority report i know you've talked about this on your show too alex uh those spiders you
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:54.120]  know tom cruise is uh he's trying to evade the the bad guys and they've got the spiders and they come
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:58.840]  under the door and through the windows and they go through the apartment onto everybody's bed and
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:04.440]  it's just part of the you know your papers please on steroids and they scan everybody's irises and
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:09.320]  when we all saw that movie years ago we were like that's really creepy how could you know whoa
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:14.680]  that's hollywood wow well of course it turns out that you've actually got companies that have now
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:21.480]  created those spiders that can actually do pretty much that and all of us go oh yeah whatever you
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:26.280]  know i saw that 10 years ago in in minority report where's the outright where's the shock
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:32.520]  you know or face recognition software when you walk by and the billboard is tailored to you
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:38.520]  now stuff like that's coming out and it turns out it's all predictive programming to condition us
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:44.520]  to accept it katherine every action movie i see now has checkpoints everywhere and one of the actors
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:51.480]  will say just a routine checkpoint so so now that's a product placement or behavior placement as they
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:56.280]  call it that's a good way of putting it i mean this is so creepy behavior placement thank you that's a
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:19:01.000]  perfect i love that that description because we know product placements you see the mount and do on
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.680]  the table 50 times and the next time you're at the grocery store you see mount and do and you go oh
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:09.480]  yeah i i know that and your your mind doesn't even associate i know that because i saw it in a movie
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:14.120]  but subconsciously you're saying oh yeah the beautiful starlet and that really hot action star
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:19.080]  you know they were drinking this and and then you you you just involuntarily reach out and grab it
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:23.080]  see when you watch the grand terino there's diet cokes everywhere they're being paid
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:27.640]  for that or you watch other shows there's mcdonald's everywhere but that's one thing but when there's
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:33.800]  an anti-family anti-liberty pro tyranny message it just shows how creepy this is by the way i didn't
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:39.160]  coin that katherine i always called it propaganda placement or police state placement when they
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:43.560]  were selling tyranny they came out in the wall street journal a few years ago and said it's what
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:51.160]  the government's called quietly for years behavior placement so their word is behavior placement
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:58.680]  and so folks realize notice the unified field in all the media that shows you how controlled it is

[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:22.120]  okay katherine i want to give you the floor in this short segment and then coming up the next
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:28.680]  to break down the latest from darpa saying well we do want the troops to have microchips to
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:36.200]  monitor their health we care about them tell us about that this darpa thing is so freaky and you
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:40.760]  know i i took a bunch of classes at mit because you can kind of cross and roll through harvard and
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:45.000]  mit so i was at the media lab there for a while and the media lab is where they do a lot of this
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.120]  really cutting-edge kind of futuristic stuff like they had countertops they could tell what
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:53.880]  ingredients you put on them because of rfid tags and that kind of ties into your earlier
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:58.760]  reference to all of our appliances being able to listen to us through the smart grid and
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:04.040]  transmit information all that stuff going on through the media lab at mit and this whole thing
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:08.680]  with minority report it was interesting but beth gibbons from the privacy rights clearinghouse
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:13.800]  actually talked to those guys we interviewed her for our book spy chips and she said that the the
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:19.320]  folks who put together the movie minority report actually interviewed people doing defense research
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:24.600]  and people working at mit to come up with all of those topics and all those themes so it's all
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:32.440]  it's it's all part of a big picture of military industrial academic corporate research happening
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:38.680]  behind the scenes and then somehow funneling its way in to these hollywood movies to give you this
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:43.880]  this this futuristic view and of course the reason they can get away with it hollywood
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:48.280]  paints it as something really dark and bad and we all look at it and we root for the good guy and
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:53.480]  he's running away from the bad guys in the dark encompassing surveillance world and we're always
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:59.560]  cheering for the good guys nevertheless even though they're giving you this image and encouraging
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:04.840]  you to root for the right guy the rest of it is working its way deep deep into your subconscious
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:11.560]  now this thing about darpa i don't know to what extent this is vaporware darpa is uh as as your
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:17.080]  listeners are probably aware the defense research thing here which is uh they are the people who
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:23.480]  put out our tax dollars and then ask for proposals and solicitations from companies out there and
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:27.480]  this is why we know about them because they they are required by law to make these public
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:32.040]  because they're spending public dollars and they say here is a request for proposals here's
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:37.720]  what we want to do we have money companies out there submit back to us give it your best shot
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:41.480]  tell us how you could pull this off and then we will pay you and give you the contract and then
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:46.840]  you develop it and at that point it becomes top secret and nobody hears about it but during this
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:53.240]  solicitation process if people want to check this out they can go to darpa.mil and i'm always nervous
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:57.560]  going to any dot mil website especially darpa's website because believe me if there's ever a
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:03.080]  website that could like i don't know look in your look through your brain through the computer
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:07.560]  screen it would be darpa so i i would encourage you to be careful going to darpa dot mil you
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:12.120]  know start page has the proxy so that's how i get there but let me just stop you you're not
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:18.040]  being paranoid when people let to get that obama car rebate it would give them a message saying
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:25.400]  the federal government has taken control of your computer i remember that i remember that
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:31.480]  people freak out no google's now been caught breaking passwords stealing them just out of hand
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:37.160]  breaking through cookie blockers and tracking iPhones and yeah i'll kind of crazy yeah but
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:41.560]  you're still paranoid and bad because you were proven right please continue bad lady so so
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:45.560]  starpage.com and i just have to put in a plug because there's a free proxy there so if you
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:51.800]  search for darpa dot mil or solicitations or request for proposals proposals at start page
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:57.080]  you will be able underneath to click the proxy link to the darpa dot mil website and starpage
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:02.520]  will load it on its servers and you can see their servers so you never connect with darpa and darpa
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:06.840]  never sees you so they can't put software on your computer they can't read your cookies they can't
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:10.200]  put malware out they can't do anything they don't know you're there they're just seeing start pages
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:15.320]  servers so that's how i get there but once you get there you can look up and i'm on a couple
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:20.920]  of different pages here one of them is opportunities slash solicitations and you can see all the things
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:26.520]  that darpa is required by law to tell the public that they are looking to spend money on and of
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:33.080]  course in amongst there is this really disturbing one that they wrote about in the world in a daily
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:39.720]  article this is called in vivo meaning in live living flesh in in actual animals or humans
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:47.400]  in vivo nano sensors for diagnostics it is solicitation number darpa b a a 1233 so you
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:51.320]  can find it right there on the darpa dot mil website again go through start page dot com though
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:55.720]  and when you get there i'll just read the the quick description this is the the very short
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:29:02.120]  summary they say the goal is to develop biocompatible nano sensors that provide continuous non-invasive
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:07.720]  ha ha and highly accurate measurement of a variety of conditions and substances within the living
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:15.080]  tissue of animals plants and insects using non-toxic materials the sensors will permit
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:21.720]  qualitative and quantitative assessment over large concentration ranges of glucose lactate
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:26.680]  and urea and large molecules so they're talking nano sensors they say they're not invasive but
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:31.480]  these things are obviously deep oh yeah i saw the pentagon new battle suit and it automatically
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:35.800]  test your urine all this stay right there we're gonna come back and get into these and guys reprint
[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:42.360]  me those articles from two weeks ago about uh dangerous nano tech is in hundreds of foods
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:47.320]  and products because now they're admitting that's getting in people's brains there's already nano

[02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:59.880]  is where they say they believe they're going to merge with machines that that is the new
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:05.560]  evolutionary jump that's going to happen and they're going to set up their planetary system
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:10.680]  and basically get rid of the population before we ever even get to that point now whether they're
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:14.920]  going to carry that out or not i don't know but they've already been carrying out the precursors
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:25.400]  to it and so yeah that's a scary thing but it's real and that's what we're facing as a society
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:32.200]  katherine um you know if you're just joining us a dr katherine albert researcher author into
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:39.080]  these subjects from your research what makes the globalist tick what type of world are they trying
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:43.480]  to build i mean google says they want to own the internet they want to have over the horizon
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:49.640]  uh predictive powers with the computers to be able to tell mass events before they take place
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:54.040]  it's a surveillance system where they can tell where mass movements are going to be able to head
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:59.800]  them off but it's still humans at the end of the day that are in control of this and humans
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:06.520]  that are willing to dominate and break laws and so we have incredible power in the hands of very
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:11.800]  sadistic wicked people i mean the final equation from your research what is the new world order
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:17.000]  what is their end game and what are some of the other cutting-edge developments that you're watching
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:22.120]  you know you you you really pegged it because we all know the old phrase knowledge is power
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:29.240]  and this is about power we also know lord actin's phrase power corrupts absolutely and what what
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:35.000]  we're now coming to a point and you ask what drives these people i think it is an unbridled lust
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.640]  for the ultimate form of power which is the ability to decide who lives and who dies the
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:46.440]  ability to decide who can procreate or who can live forever the ability to decide which trees fall
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:51.480]  in which forest or or where a frog jumps or everything else because in my research i mean
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:57.720]  you've got the ibm planetary skin you've got them putting sensors in oceans you've got them putting
[02:35:57.720 --> 02:36:03.720]  sensors in in forests into trees i ran across a document by a big international forestry
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:07.960]  organization that actually came up with some statistics to figure out what it would cost to
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:14.280]  put an RFID microchip spy chip in every single sapling every single tree on planet earth you
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:19.400]  know the planet is getting small enough now that they're actually envisioning the ability to identify
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:24.680]  every single last animal in microchip them all so it's really you know what what would inspire
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:28.520]  someone to want to do that and the only thing that i can think that would inspire someone to
[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:34.600]  want to do that is if they're kind of tapping into a darker desire which gets us on to the
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:40.760]  spiritual realm which is the desire to be completely and totally in control like god
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:44.600]  and you know you can go all the way back to the garden of eden and of course the conversation
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:50.200]  that occurred there between satan and adam and eve that conversation you know the the
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:54.360]  foundation of western civilization trace it all the way back to its beginning and that
[02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:59.720]  conversation was all about power you know the knowledge of good and evil you will become like
[02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:04.120]  gods just take a bite out of this apple and by the way let me point out that all you listeners
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:10.200]  out there who have apple ipads and iphone's and and laptop computers you are carrying around the
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:14.680]  visual representation of that symbol all day long you've got the apple with a bite out of it
[02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:21.000]  that represents a deal that was struck when the offer was made hey listen i will make you like
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:27.640]  gods you will have the power of god and of course the reality is the only power from god is is
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:32.440]  from god you know when god gives you power that's real power when god has power that's real power
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:38.600]  but when you get into this technological twisted dark stuff it always always always comes with
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:43.480]  a price and in fact we opened spy chips with a quote by cp snow from the new york times this is
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:50.040]  back in the 1970s and he said technology is a queer gift it gives you great gifts with one hand
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:56.200]  and stabs you in the back with the other and i can think of no technology i you know i've
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:01.160]  been reading all these books about the luddites and about you know the 1800s and the implementation
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:05.400]  of all these technologies and where they all got their start and all of them have come with this
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:09.560]  huge downside and ultimately that downside is going to be the destruction of our entire planet
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:15.000]  look what's going on over in fukushima look at what you know happened hero shima and by the way
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:21.160]  i have no articles speaking of that fukushima reactor number four vulnerable to catastrophic
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:28.920]  collapse could unleash 85 times the cesium 137 radiation of Chernobyl and the japanese government
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:33.320]  even admits that the pentagon says it's a national security threat but they just had the
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:42.200]  epa and fda raised the level and say that higher levels of radiation is now just safe again they
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:47.320]  could care less about real environmental crises they're telling us humans are evil because of
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:53.640]  carbon dioxide but reactors blowing up that's not a problem yeah isn't that isn't that crazy and yeah
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:57.240]  they will keep moving the bar and and that's what's happening you keep moving the bar further and
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:01.160]  further out as to what's acceptable what's tolerable what we'll put up with and this is one of the
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.640]  things that i said to bob under when he interviewed me from world net daily is a listen they're not
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:10.760]  going to come one day with tanks and guns and maybe they will but believe me it's not going to happen
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:15.480]  until people are really softened up for it and say hey get a microchip it's going to be little by
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:20.840]  little and you're going to have you know kids 15 18 years old going cool you mean if i have a
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:27.160]  microchip implant then i can just ask questions and my google goggles will just give me the answer no
[02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:32.200]  exactly there that's what the pentagon said decades ago as you know is that they would entice
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:37.800]  people darpas said people will basically end up begging for all of this and then the final
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:44.040]  pockets of luddites of amish of people like that that are already being harassed it'll be well
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:48.680]  they weren't giving them training or they weren't giving them access to all this and then they'll
[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:55.000]  come and be picked up for other reasons they always phase it in like like like the tsa like
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:00.440]  everything else you know i talk about on my radio show a lot alex that there's an 80 cutoff that
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:05.160]  once you've got 80 of the population doing anything fill in the blank whatever it is then you can force
[02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:10.120]  the other 20 to get on board and i'm already seeing this with the toll transponders those
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:13.880]  little things people put the fast pass and easy pass things they put in their windshield to go
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:19.480]  through the tolls i won't use one i don't use one i never will use one i will take surface streets
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:24.280]  before i'll use one of those things because that's an rfid based spy chip tracking device in your
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:29.240]  car however now that they've got 80 percent of people on board in many communities around the
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:34.280]  country now they're moving to make those mandatory where you can't even pay cash there's no option of
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:39.160]  paying cash same thing is true with all of these different technologies once 80 percent of people
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:43.400]  have smartphones there's going to be a requirement you know just like a social security number you
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:48.440]  can't get a job without one so all the holdouts back in the 30s 40s 50s who said oh that's the
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:53.080]  mark of the beast they all had to sign up or they died off and then their kids signed up
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:56.600]  same thing is going to happen with the cashless society same thing's going to happen with near
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:01.240]  field communication cell phone payments and ultimately they're pushing for that same thing
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:06.280]  to happen with the implants so i would look for the implants it is you know we we were out there
[02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:11.160]  protesting i did a prayer vigil in a march against the the chipping of the Alzheimer's patients in
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:16.520]  florida if people want to go to anti chips dot com they can see not only the photos of that event
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:22.040]  but they can also see i don't know it's like a 50 page document an academic document that i wrote
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:27.240]  about those microchips causing cancer and laboratory animals so there's also a i think like a hundred
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:31.800]  page or a hundred question faq anti chips dot com people can check it out and learn more about
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:37.720]  these implants but you know the the the whole move of these implants there are a couple of stupid
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:42.360]  companies like the verichip corporation with all that's various names that come out and say oh well
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:46.200]  we want to sell this as a product i don't think it's going to happen that way people don't want
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:52.280]  an id microchip but if you turn around and instead say you'll be able to listen to music and access
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:57.400]  facebook and and and you know get your email through this little implant you're going to have a
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:02.280]  stampede of people wanting to do it because we and i think a part of it alex and i know you and i
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:06.920]  are doing all we can but our generation and the folks that they're listening to this show we are
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:11.000]  not doing a very good job reaching out to young people and helping them understand why this stuff
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:16.440]  matters and we are not madison avenue they are getting their information from the schools which
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:23.000]  is the government 12 000 hours of seat time the actually it's 14 000 hours of seat time so they've
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:28.520]  got the government doing all of this forming they've got television which is all the folks
[02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:33.080]  who were just talking about giving you all this in advance and doing the behavioral placements
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:37.400]  and then we've got madison avenue which has a definite interest in our kids not caring about
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:41.800]  privacy because they know the more they know about us the more they can get us to part with our money
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:48.280]  and so all of these forces and all of these informational sources are promoting this stuff
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:54.200]  and we who in past eras you know parents grandparents that the people in your community
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:43:01.240]  we are not having an influence on young people well there is no community all there is is television
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:05.960]  and then people watch it and then outside of watching it they sit around and talk about
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:12.520]  what happened on the television so human society is organized around a bunch of propaganda and
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:17.720]  brainwashing and i mean that's the proof of the new world order's crimes is not just all the
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:26.760]  admissions and convictions catherine but the the anti-family anti-human poisonous messages they
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:34.920]  shovel let me ask you this i mean i know that a decade ago wash tech the washington post had a
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:40.840]  monthly technology magazine and i even interviewed one of their writers and he went to a big symposium
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:46.840]  and bragged he said the media is pushing body modification and all this ahead of getting
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:52.680]  everyone ready to take implantable chips and you think about the fact that these these globalists
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:44:00.760]  operate in 10 20 30 year plans and and and work in concert together as a ruling class enjoying the
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:07.560]  fact that they govern the world and roll out the pr and then we buy into it like an artificial habitat
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:12.040]  like we're animals drinking from the poison you know water well that they've poisoned the poison
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:18.280]  system i mean this is so what you're saying about technology being double edged they're
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:23.480]  designing at all to be oppressive and to have the back doors and so i think it's the message of
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:31.000]  showing people how it's being deployed to ensnare and entrap but then what do you do because already
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:36.920]  to communicate in the matrix and to reach people in the matrix you have to be in the matrix right
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:41.000]  it's right and you know i always go back alex when i get frustrated by that because i'm not
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:45.880]  gonna i'm not gonna get an iphone so i may be like that guy in the 1920s who was driving his mule
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:50.600]  team down main street while the cars were honking because i'm not going to get an iphone now that's
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:54.280]  where i'm drawing the line because i know that that's going to be near field communication
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:59.160]  that is one step away from the implant it's it's it's those phones and they're already a privacy
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:04.440]  disaster so what i take solace in though alex when i think about that is i i always think about
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:10.360]  what it says in the bible what you intended for evil i have turned to good so there is nothing
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:15.880]  out there that that satan can throw at us that this these technological you know monsters who want
[02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:21.960]  this transhumanism there's nothing that they can throw at us that if you maintain your integrity
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:25.880]  and stay within your own bounds and i would encourage everybody draw those boundaries now
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:30.280]  because they're they're going to be really working on your psyche to try to get you to change them
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:34.360]  draw your boundaries now figure out where they are and then work within that you know i've got a
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:38.840]  very good friend who who shares a lot of these views she just got an apple computer because
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:43.080]  she had to for work and she says well you know if i'm going to be logging on to facebook if i'm
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:48.040]  going to be logging on to these places for my work to convey these important privacy notions
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:53.320]  and to convey this important stuff i'm going to do it with my eyes open fully aware and also not
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:58.440]  become addicted they call it nomophobia i think is the name of it it's cell phone addiction and
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:02.680]  they found that like over 50 percent of people are suffering from cell phone listen i go to
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:07.560]  restaurants and places and people aren't even talking to each other myself included they're on
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:12.280]  the cell phones children they've had studies as you know that have come out are using a lot less
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:17.560]  words now you can see people already being sucked into the matrix what big studies came out a month
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:24.360]  ago uh that it's reprogramming brains in a bad way and increasing autism i mean this is really
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:29.160]  really coming to a head you know i had somebody 28 years old right into me through my radio show
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:34.920]  and say i i i went back to college i'm in with a bunch of 18 19 20 21 year olds and by the way
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:40.200]  present company excluded all you young people listening to alex amen to you and and thumbs up
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:44.440]  but you know he was writing that you can't even carry on a conversation with these people they
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:48.520]  they're shifting their eyes are shifting around they're moving from foot to foot they can't
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:53.720]  hear the end they have no attention span they've been programmed down i mean i mean we know it
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:57.800]  hurt children to have their attention span go from about an hour down to like six seven minutes
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:03.800]  for cartoons now it's a matter of seconds and all they can do is jibber and and let me explain what
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:11.240]  i've developed their brain waves are near and this has been confirmed near a dream state and
[02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:19.000]  they're in a fantasy of a fake archetype program of of the trendy they are true you know of the
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:25.320]  madison avenue archetype they've taken on and that's why they smile with pleasure and look down
[02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:30.680]  everyone else's scum so it's like people in the matrix walking around that they're movie stars in
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:34.200]  the matrix it's just like the movie the matrix where he says i don't remember anything put me
[02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:39.720]  back in you know make me a movie star they are walking around thinking they're trendy and there's
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:46.040]  no one even home now you know it is the most disturbing thing and so what do we do well first
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:50.600]  of all i i think it is okay to to put your foot in the water and use some of these technologies
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:55.560]  i do i'm not going to get a microchip implant they will have to shoot me uh before i will
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:59.480]  ever do that or if you believe what the bible has to say about that they will behead the people who
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:04.600]  will refuse to ultimately sign up for whatever form the mark of the beast takes so i've got my lines
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:10.200]  that i've drawn i pay for all my payments in cash i do not use a credit card i can count on my
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:14.600]  fingers a number of times i've used a credit card in the last we've got to keep cash alive we have
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:20.840]  to we have to but you know yeah but but again i was thinking about this the guy driving out
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:25.480]  main street in the 1920s in his mule cart you know at some point that guy's going to get old and die
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:29.640]  and then everybody drives a car or the people who said no to the telephones who thought it was
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:34.920]  impersonal you know the amish are fascinating to me because they've actually said no and let all of
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:39.080]  the freeway of technology race around them and they're still on their mules without their phones
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:43.800]  well i can see people 300 years ago seeing those cesspit cities and saying we don't want any part
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:47.880]  of this we're going to the countryside that's right well there's a new study out today that
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:53.480]  perhaps you saw that actually the amish are the only population in america that seems completely
[02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:58.600]  resistant against all of the allergies that our kids have so you look at that and you go okay well
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:03.160]  what is it is it exposure to radio you know electromagnetic radio really well that's what
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:09.320]  the top scientists are saying is it's a cocktail it's the gmo uh it's the air conditioning chemicals
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:17.160]  it's the computer screens uh it's it's all of it it's the frequency pollution
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:22.280]  really and you know i was reading my bible recently and it refers to satan as the prince
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:27.960]  of the air and you know that really hit me i was like okay so i've got a light outside my studio
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:32.360]  here this is on the air and you know we're broadcasting out through the air there's air
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:37.880]  all around us that is absolutely filled with communication and fortunately in our case you
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:42.840]  know we're communicating good stuff but a lot of what that's floating around is impacting people's
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:47.480]  bodies we've got radio waves we had television waves up until recently we've got all of this
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:53.720]  wireless wi-fi rfid all this stuff coming through the air but we can't see it and that's where the
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:59.480]  globalist always come at you in the food in the water in in the hidden tech inside your iphone
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:06.440]  everything is hidden that's what a cult means is hidden and they are the masters of the hidden
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:12.360]  world and they've built this whole hidden world around us and now they told us all that stuff
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:18.280]  doesn't exist children but now as they phase it out they go you know what it did exist you know
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:22.680]  and and and this is why this just to tie this back to the nano tech thing and also to um to
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:27.560]  some of the other stuff we've been talking about if they come up with this if darpa actually gets
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:32.200]  proposals on this and can pull it off just just a heads up for people 12 months out they want to
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:37.720]  safety demonstration in animals by 42 months out they actually want to demonstrate this nano platform
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:43.880]  tracking sensor in a large animal with five antelate detection so large animal what are we
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:49.400]  talking like a dog a moose a cow i don't know but 42 months out they want that at what point can they
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:53.800]  just inject this into us and we don't even know i gotta do this for you i know military that have
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:58.280]  taken chips and i have well i'm not gonna get it i've had family that was told they were getting
[02:50:58.280 --> 02:51:02.840]  chips and now they won't talk about it we'll get right back for a long time you've heard me talk

[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:23.000]  by a final segment in this hour we were mentioning the nano tech i thought i'd give you a source on
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:33.160]  that chicago tribune msnbc and others fda says nano tech may need extra safety test and the fda is
[02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:40.760]  run by monsanto eugenesis the globalist i mean it'll just make your your head spin uh when you
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:45.720]  look at it and they admit oh hundreds of food products and other things they have nano tech in
[02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:49.960]  them and yeah it goes through the blood brain barrier these little nano techs are in your brain
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:55.480]  and then we'll just see neurological disorders cancer everything off the charts it's getting
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:55:01.320]  i mean the numbers of pediatric cancers diabetes neurological disorders breast cancer we lead the
[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:08.520]  world in that it's all off the chart and it's a tiny group of globalists who a could care less but
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:15.640]  be also like seeing people sick and dying who are running this and 99 percent of us plus need to
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:20.760]  understand that and get together and say we are aware of your scientific dictatorship we are aware
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:25.160]  of what you're trying to do because they're not in full control yet and exposure can bring them down
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:33.720]  kathryn in closing um um how are you doing uh with uh the treatment you've undergone for breast
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:38.760]  cancer i have really good news on that i am done at the end of this month done done done done
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:44.520]  and as uh as as your listeners know i had stage three breast cancer 16 months of treatment it has
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:51.880]  been uh the the uh the journey of a lifetime here and may 23rd is my absolute last day i get my final
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:56.680]  treatment and then they uh you know they give me a big hug and they send me out into the world and
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:01.880]  say good luck honey and at that point it's it's just a lot of prayer to make sure that it never
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:06.600]  comes back because you know the thing about cancer once you kick it if it comes back it usually comes
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:11.160]  back terminal and then you've only got you know a couple of years now some people fight it then but
[02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:16.040]  in the case of breast cancer stage four breast cancer has about a three percent survival rate
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:21.960]  all right i don't have that but i'd love it if the listeners would please keep me in your prayers
[02:56:21.960 --> 02:56:28.120]  may 23rd is my last day kmshow.com is my website and i have been uh a little remiss in blogging
