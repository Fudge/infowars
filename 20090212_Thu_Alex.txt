[02:18.100 --> 02:23.940]  imaginary horse you go out and admit the horse has been stolen you go out and look for it

[03:23.420 --> 03:27.380]  the streets and they'll just come over in a 7-11 or ever say Alex listen we know what's
[03:27.380 --> 03:31.700]  going on most of us are with you we're not out tasering people to death be easy on us
[03:31.700 --> 03:36.140]  look look some of us didn't believe you years ago but we know it's true now what do we do
[03:36.140 --> 03:41.620]  so that is exciting that is good the problem is a lot of the good cops are leaving the
[03:41.620 --> 03:46.140]  force because they just can't handle it and they're hiring these thugs you know the bully
[03:46.140 --> 03:51.300]  you had in high school and you can tell you see when I'm you know nice cop you know doing
[03:51.300 --> 03:56.500]  his job whatever but then you see other ones who are just crazed on power trips they should
[03:56.500 --> 04:01.060]  be embarrassed for themselves but they're not and all I'm saying is you work for the
[04:01.060 --> 04:05.340]  new world order now and the new world order is coming down on the people and so I'm just
[04:05.340 --> 04:12.820]  pointing out the position you're in I'm your best friend I'm your best friend and I'll
[04:12.820 --> 04:17.020]  talk to you straight and I'll talk to the military straight now I know Ron Paul got
[04:17.020 --> 04:25.620]  more presidential donations what 70 plus percent of the Republican donations he got the second
[04:25.620 --> 04:30.340]  most donations overall for the military Barack Obama because the troops want to come home
[04:30.340 --> 04:33.660]  upwards of 80 percent of the troops and polls that the army times have done don't want to
[04:33.660 --> 04:40.980]  be in Iraq or Afghanistan so he got the most Republican donations 70 plus percent of the
[04:40.980 --> 04:46.820]  Republican donations and number two compared to Obama from the military so we know that
[04:46.820 --> 04:51.060]  there's still a lot of great folks in the military just by that but still they're hiring
[04:51.060 --> 04:56.660]  aggravated felons they're bringing in the illegal aliens there it's a foreign military

[08:48.140 --> 08:53.940]  news articles I mean this is announcements by the White House but his followers are living
[08:53.940 --> 09:01.660]  in total delusion wanton Lee ignorant and I that just only encourages the criminals
[09:01.660 --> 09:06.260]  running things to rape you that much worse financially that's why they're making their
[09:06.260 --> 09:12.940]  move on as they know that the nation is predominantly suckers there's a giant minority of Americans
[09:12.940 --> 09:18.300]  who see through everything and there's some of the sheep starting to wake up of the mass
[09:18.300 --> 09:36.020]  group out there brain so we'll be going over that today also there's all these mainstream
[09:36.020 --> 09:40.940]  news articles trying to destroy confidence now while they were busy setting up the implosion
[09:40.940 --> 09:45.340]  they told you invest in the stock market get into debt it's lies and rivatives won't hurt
[09:45.340 --> 09:53.460]  you we don't need to regulate the big central banks and then now the Atlantic magazine and
[09:53.460 --> 09:57.700]  AP and Reuters the New York Times I mean they're saying it is a depression now and it's going
[09:57.700 --> 10:02.540]  to be worse but the government and the banks have a way to save you the very banks that
[10:02.540 --> 10:07.180]  engineered it I I just can't get over it and then there's all these articles lawmakers
[10:07.180 --> 10:13.540]  delay vote on bill charging obese employees more for health care by the way if you're
[10:13.540 --> 10:19.580]  five ten and weigh a hundred and eighty pounds you're obese there's a lot of people I know
[10:19.580 --> 10:24.140]  who are five ten who are just big boned and look skinny at a hundred and eighty five
[10:24.140 --> 10:28.260]  pounds folks at a hundred and eighty five pounds and I'm five ten and a half I look
[10:28.260 --> 10:35.740]  like Bruce Lee you can Google Alex Jones you know muscle pitchers just years ago somebody
[10:35.740 --> 10:40.220]  took a picture of me in the gym and it just showed up in the newspaper and that's me at
[10:40.220 --> 10:44.380]  a hundred and eighty five pounds I mean ripped look like Bruce Lee I weigh one hundred and
[10:44.380 --> 10:49.460]  fifty two hundred and fifty five pounds and I am chubby now two hundred and fifty five
[10:49.460 --> 10:57.940]  pounds but I'm certainly not obese and I am ripped I mean two percent body fat at when
[10:57.940 --> 11:01.900]  I was a hundred and eighty five pounds when I was like twenty two twenty three but I'm
[11:01.900 --> 11:08.460]  obese and this is starting with government workers and then they're saying you're not
[11:08.460 --> 11:11.420]  going to get your health care taken care of now or you're going to pay more for or it's
[11:11.420 --> 11:16.140]  going to be rationed and old people if you go blind we have a cheap surgery to fix it
[11:16.140 --> 11:20.460]  we're not going to do it I mean that's in the spending package they've now passed through
[11:20.460 --> 11:26.580]  committee and they're about to finish up the next few days Bloomberg AP reporting on
[11:26.580 --> 11:31.940]  so this is the starting of just total social engineering even if you have the money for
[11:31.940 --> 11:37.220]  a medical procedure they're not going to let you have it and they admit it is the British
[11:37.220 --> 11:45.300]  model I've got to commend the Huffington Post and it is a liberal left wing publication
[11:45.300 --> 11:50.140]  but they came out a month ago admitted that Obama's funding eugenics and forced sterilization
[11:50.140 --> 12:00.380]  and infanticide and abortion in China and eugenics in Africa and really called it what
[12:00.380 --> 12:08.420]  it is but meanwhile Pat Robertson was praising it the world is upside down well here they
[12:08.420 --> 12:13.300]  are saying Obama reopened the 9-11 investigation a call for him to look into it being an inside
[12:13.300 --> 12:20.540]  job I mean this is a big publication this is this is pretty much establishment I don't
[12:20.540 --> 12:26.100]  know what to make of that well I mean their readers are pretty much decent people that
[12:26.100 --> 12:30.500]  know it's an inside job so I know they're demanding that these daily costs and Huffington
[12:30.500 --> 12:39.300]  Post and others expose government sponsored terror but I've got all this financial news
[12:39.300 --> 12:45.900]  here that is just amazing here's one day lose your financial calamities looming by mid
[12:45.900 --> 12:51.020]  March as horrible as the financial news for currencies and paper assets has been since
[12:51.020 --> 12:55.860]  mid 2007 it looks like the worst yet to come perhaps as early as next month over the weekend
[12:55.860 --> 13:01.060]  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund Dominique Strauss Kahn told
[13:01.060 --> 13:04.860]  a gathering of Southeast Asia central bankers at the world's advanced economies are already
[13:04.860 --> 13:09.140]  in a depression and that the financial crisis may deepen unless the banking system is fixed
[13:09.140 --> 13:14.500]  now by fixing it we're in a depression you've got to fix it a giant world bank ruling every
[13:14.500 --> 13:20.620]  country that will fix it sign on to this sign treaties with us that NATO and the U.S. will
[13:20.620 --> 13:25.860]  militarily attack you if you don't follow our banking rules and I mean this is world
[13:25.860 --> 13:31.620]  government oven by the bankers when they engineered it all they did it and they're the ones running
[13:31.620 --> 13:35.540]  the fixing of it the fixing is making it even worse and they want you to be a feudal
[13:35.540 --> 13:46.180]  surfer their own words so they're not trying to fix anything you know I told people that
[13:46.180 --> 13:55.420]  what was it back in 2004 they passed that bill that they pushed to the public as we are going
[13:55.420 --> 14:02.180]  to give you total medical privacy with your records it's totally federalized clinics
[14:02.180 --> 14:07.740]  dentist offices hospitals every form of a medical procedure where they have to put into
[14:07.740 --> 14:12.340]  computers everything that was done everything every prescription and then when you go get
[14:12.340 --> 14:17.660]  your prescription they instantly upload everything your prescription to the feds no judge no
[14:17.660 --> 14:21.980]  jury no fourth amendment just like know your customer everything you do in your banking
[14:21.980 --> 14:25.300]  the government just goes right into your bank accounts and constantly government people
[14:25.300 --> 14:28.700]  are caught stealing credit card numbers and robbing people and they then they use that
[14:28.700 --> 14:34.820]  as an excuse for even more control and more surveillance and I mean it's just incredible
[14:34.820 --> 14:38.260]  people don't believe me about that but here's Arizona tracking prescription drug users Arizona's
[14:38.260 --> 14:44.500]  launched a new computer database no the feds are just now letting the state tie in AP Arizona's
[14:44.500 --> 14:47.420]  now launched a new computer database that tracks prescription drug usage information
[14:47.420 --> 14:51.820]  is stored in a state managed centralized database that can be accessed by doctors and pharmacists
[14:51.820 --> 14:56.140]  around the state and then when they want to go after Joe the plumber or somebody and
[14:56.140 --> 14:59.740]  find out everything about him find out what medication he's on they want to find out what
[14:59.740 --> 15:06.460]  medication you're on they want to find out of your wife is you know had breast implants
[15:06.460 --> 15:11.580]  they want to find out if you're taking herpes medication they want to find out if you've
[15:11.580 --> 15:17.020]  got a genetic problem it's all in there now remember for 36 years everybody born in the
[15:17.020 --> 15:21.900]  U.S. in hospital has your blood taken put in a world DNA database nobody believed that
[15:21.900 --> 15:25.340]  even though I had congressman on now it's public Bush signed an executive order saying
[15:25.340 --> 15:32.780]  it's legal because it was always illegal before that and we were talking about California
[15:32.780 --> 15:38.700]  last week and then earlier in the week we were talking about Michigan here's one PA
[15:38.700 --> 15:44.900]  judges accused of jailing kids for cash judge allegedly took 2.6 million in payoffs but juveniles
[15:44.900 --> 15:52.140]  and lockups Hillary trans Sue was sentenced to a wilderness camp for building a spoof
[15:52.140 --> 15:58.940]  MySpace page that lampooned her assistant principal in Whitehaven on Friday she said she did not
[15:58.940 --> 16:05.100]  have an attorney nor was she informed of her right to one she was sentenced by the county
[16:05.100 --> 16:15.260]  judge Mark Civerella now this is AP as well and it late to class three times push another
[16:15.260 --> 16:22.740]  student use a cuss word six months or longer you know read these cases in a labor camp
[16:22.740 --> 16:29.940]  in a farce labor camp now these are private camps that get federal and state money so
[16:29.940 --> 16:35.740]  they pay the judges to put the children in there needs to be an investigation in Austin
[16:35.740 --> 16:40.060]  I've seen K.I. pieces and others where they're saying it's good here in Austin where it shows
[16:40.060 --> 16:43.500]  the portable buildings they built on that aren't real courts and they just call the
[16:43.500 --> 16:49.340]  kids in front of their parents scream at them and say sign this because it's because no
[16:49.340 --> 16:53.580]  law was violated and they sign it and they go now you're on probation one more thing
[16:53.580 --> 16:57.020]  you go to jail for six months now they're in the system now they're on probation because
[16:57.020 --> 17:06.180]  they trick you into signing on the probation and there's massive money involved and they
[17:06.180 --> 17:10.780]  headhunt that's why your neighbor here's yelling and screaming in your house they call the police
[17:10.780 --> 17:15.980]  they show up nothing's broken no one's hurt they police are told or they're written up
[17:15.980 --> 17:21.220]  you will take somebody to jail and so they take somebody to jail because then the city
[17:21.220 --> 17:30.260]  gets federal and state money for every person they arrest it's thousands of dollars so there
[17:30.260 --> 17:35.340]  is a bounty to get you into the system if you put your children in public schools you
[17:35.340 --> 17:44.660]  are insane I mean the way things work now I would have been in prison the things I did
[17:44.660 --> 17:52.220]  in junior high and high school I mean fistfights you know we'd be out fistfighting and the
[17:52.220 --> 17:57.060]  coaches would come up and if somebody didn't get hurt too bad they'd go oh man that's great
[17:57.060 --> 18:04.980]  you guys need to do that on the football field because they were macho they were into that
[18:04.980 --> 18:08.340]  and I'm not even saying that's particularly a good thing but this culture is completely
[18:08.340 --> 18:18.060]  gelded I mean I remember Rockwall the coaches just loved me because they were all macho
[18:18.060 --> 18:24.780]  they all had John Wayne in their offices and they just they just loved it and they'd have
[18:24.780 --> 18:34.180]  boxing matches you know after in the off season they set up a ring in the field house and
[18:34.180 --> 18:38.460]  now it's just oh my gosh you you shoved someone you're going to jail for six months and then
[18:38.460 --> 18:43.460]  their secret payoffs going on to put the young people in the prison let's just stop right
[18:43.460 --> 18:49.100]  there and go ahead we did get the state representative on we're about to go to break representative
[18:49.100 --> 18:55.020]  Cynthia Davis she has introduced and signed on the legislation we had the representative
[18:55.020 --> 19:00.140]  guest on from Missouri as well yesterday part of now upwards of 20 states filing or who have
[19:00.140 --> 19:06.380]  passed resolutions reaffirming the 10th amendment saying the feds do not control them good to

[19:18.380 --> 19:23.420]  introduced in Missouri because I'm seeing multiple pieces declaring 10th amendment well I am
[19:23.420 --> 19:30.620]  not aware of how many other pieces are passed being being introduced but I'll tell you this much if
[19:30.620 --> 19:37.660]  most of us would introduce something that be a guarantee it will pass absolutely we'll stay

[24:17.500 --> 24:23.580]  for the united states under the tenth amendment we have hcr six out of new hampshire second
[24:23.580 --> 24:30.300]  out of the fema camps and marshal law that those folks coming on tomorrow it is now 21 states claiming
[24:30.300 --> 24:35.340]  sovereignty we just got a full list of those well you i am that took curtain memo and to uh
[24:35.340 --> 24:40.140]  watson both the webmasters for prison plan on info wars dot com so we can get this up this is very
[24:40.140 --> 24:45.260]  important thank you sir thank you joey v we've got her uh this segment and into the next representative
[24:45.260 --> 24:52.380]  sythia davis she's introduced uh a separate uh bill and that's i give us that bill number and
[24:52.380 --> 24:59.500]  tell us how yours deals with uh declaring sovereignty well mine is called a house resolution
[25:00.220 --> 25:05.660]  and the big difference between house resolution and house concurrent resolution is the concurrent
[25:05.660 --> 25:12.860]  resolution means you have to have the senate agree to it and like most states and even you know i mean
[25:12.860 --> 25:16.700]  the senate is a separate and distinct body and i don't have any faith that they're going to
[25:16.700 --> 25:23.980]  take care of business so your hr 212 uh the feds are trying to force the states to not be able
[25:23.980 --> 25:28.060]  to choose whether to have abortion be legal or illegal you're saying leave that to the states
[25:28.700 --> 25:33.340]  yeah i mean here's the point look at the way the president of the united states was
[25:33.340 --> 25:41.900]  elected every state has its own choice of who they want now same with pro-life issues we have pro-life
[25:41.900 --> 25:48.860]  laws that are tailored to our constituency so maybe the people in missouri respect life
[25:48.860 --> 25:56.940]  more than the people in massachusetts so that allows each state to pick what is fitting of their
[25:56.940 --> 26:03.020]  residents if i pass a lot on pro-life issues and my constituents think that's out of their
[26:03.580 --> 26:08.860]  taste then they can elect different lawmakers who will pass a law in their case so really what
[26:08.860 --> 26:14.540]  they're doing is slapping the face of all the states and say no all the states have to have
[26:14.540 --> 26:21.580]  the same local flavor as what the people in washington dc have and specifically they're
[26:21.580 --> 26:26.060]  they're trying to federally say abortion will continue in all 50 states and you're saying hey
[26:26.060 --> 26:33.340]  that is for missouri to decide with our state yeah it's clearly um up to it's not just abortion it's
[26:33.340 --> 26:40.700]  having who pays for the abortion it's what kind of abortions we do it has to do with if um you know
[26:40.700 --> 26:47.020]  we in missouri think that parents are smarter than maybe some people have in other states i can't
[26:47.020 --> 26:54.220]  help that but uh the missouri parents should have a right to give approval to an abortion for a minor
[26:54.220 --> 27:00.140]  in missouri other states don't have that law but what they're doing is they're stripping us
[27:00.140 --> 27:05.100]  of our own rightful authority to define our standards in missouri well you're right what
[27:05.100 --> 27:11.340]  they're doing what they're doing federally uh it is lining up with the un treaties like the
[27:11.340 --> 27:16.860]  un treaty on the rights of the child that says by law it's a felony if parents try to get involved
[27:16.860 --> 27:20.860]  stopping their 12 year old daughter from having an abortion so what's happening is the feds aren't
[27:20.860 --> 27:27.340]  just federalizing they're internationalizing now where mine fits in with that freedom of choice act
[27:27.340 --> 27:34.540]  is sometimes you need a spark to ignite the flame to get people really angry and that's what
[27:34.540 --> 27:39.100]  the federal government is doing with this threat to take away our state laws as they
[27:39.100 --> 27:46.060]  pertain to abortion but the rule the root of all these issues is the exact same problem and that is
[27:46.060 --> 27:53.660]  the states are being disrespected by the federal government and this grand overreaching is pervasive
[27:53.660 --> 28:01.900]  and it's getting worse and this abortion issue was the perfect catalyst for helping people see
[28:01.900 --> 28:07.660]  how bad the problem has gotten and how much worse it's going to get if we don't do something to
[28:07.660 --> 28:14.460]  stand up to a bully well i was about to say um that this is a precedent setting what they're
[28:14.460 --> 28:20.220]  trying to do passing a federal law saying the states have no jurisdiction over themselves
[28:20.220 --> 28:26.380]  when it comes to uh reproductive activities uh i mean this is amazing that they're trying to
[28:26.380 --> 28:32.860]  come in and federally say that states can't restrict or legalize abortion yeah and in
[28:32.860 --> 28:39.340]  missouri we don't do certain things because that's not how people want it in missouri and
[28:40.060 --> 28:46.460]  basically in one nutshell the federal government is trying to treat the states like we are nothing
[28:46.460 --> 28:52.380]  but an administrative branch of what they are doing and they've done it to us on health care
[28:52.380 --> 28:58.060]  they've done it to us on education this is not the first time but this is the time that
[28:58.060 --> 29:03.900]  penetrated down to the grassroots level where people could actually see a direct effect nobody
[29:03.900 --> 29:11.900]  was sensitized to how egregious this was because the overstepping usually was accompanied by money
[29:11.900 --> 29:17.580]  and it's easy for people when they're getting federal money to say oh well then i guess their
[29:17.580 --> 29:23.260]  encroachment isn't that bad but there's an old expression if you want to get out of the rat race
[29:23.260 --> 29:29.740]  you have to let go of the cheese well i mean plus people think it's free money they take our state
[29:29.740 --> 29:35.260]  money and send on average what thirty something percent back to us so it's disgusting but then
[29:35.260 --> 29:39.980]  on average states end up actually putting about seventy plus percent into services so we need to
[29:39.980 --> 29:45.580]  all do what the founders said uh stand the representative uh synthy uh davis from missouri
[29:45.580 --> 29:49.580]  we'd like to talk more about your particular legislation in missouri that reaffirms the

[33:12.940 --> 33:19.260]  sigh up as they keep trying to compare obama to mythical people like george washington
[33:19.260 --> 33:27.980]  abraham lincoln and uh franklin delano roosevelt i mean this is a sigh up we're going to break it
[33:27.980 --> 33:34.380]  down also over the 21 states claiming sovereignty they're declaring it we're going to go over this
[33:34.380 --> 33:40.060]  a little bit later uh but uh right now let's go back to our guest representative sythia davis
[33:40.060 --> 33:49.420]  Missouri this is h r 2 1 2 uh house resolution and again there's hcr 13 a separate one that's
[33:49.420 --> 33:55.020]  broader uh declaring 10-minute rights across the board but but as she said this this does it as well
[33:55.740 --> 34:00.940]  please continue with other points that you'd like to make oh well you know what this whole
[34:00.940 --> 34:07.580]  problem started when our public schools quit teaching the constitution but a lot of people
[34:07.580 --> 34:12.140]  am sure on your show you're familiar with the tenth amendment which is beautifully written and was
[34:12.140 --> 34:19.740]  part of the original amendments but a lot of people don't go into where the the constitution
[34:19.740 --> 34:27.340]  actually came from the declaration of independence and in the declaration i mean it's so beautifully
[34:27.340 --> 34:34.300]  written and explains reasons why the state should have rights it was assumed from the very beginning
[34:34.300 --> 34:39.180]  that we were a collection of states the federal government had the least amount of power and the
[34:39.180 --> 34:45.820]  state said much more power i'm sure i'm telling you stuff you already know but even in the in the
[34:45.820 --> 34:54.140]  declaration it says these united colonies are of right ought to be free and independent states
[34:54.780 --> 35:01.020]  and it goes on to say well even even as british colonies uh they still separately can make their
[35:01.020 --> 35:05.180]  own laws and and have their own systems and we're very diverse some were more catholic
[35:05.180 --> 35:10.300]  some are more protestant some were freewheeling like new york basically a pirate base uh let me
[35:10.300 --> 35:14.380]  just read the tenth amendment for folks the power is not delegated to the united states
[35:14.380 --> 35:20.220]  by the constitution or prohibited to it by the states are reserved to the states respectively
[35:20.220 --> 35:26.860]  or the people go ahead and there's no constitutional authority for national government to do anything
[35:26.860 --> 35:34.460]  with education or health care and yet if you listen to what all the folks in washington dc
[35:34.460 --> 35:40.380]  have to tell you about uh 90 percent of it boils down to education and health care so if we could
[35:40.380 --> 35:45.900]  strip that out of their jurisdiction they wouldn't rob probably have anything to do well i mean you
[35:45.900 --> 35:52.460]  notice how they're positioning obama saying he is like lincoln he will he will bring federal control
[35:52.460 --> 35:59.820]  he will unify us uh but i mean we're not freeing slaves here there's not a war going on uh but
[35:59.820 --> 36:05.180]  i mean he keeps saying he's basically taking the states over this is creepy and i frankly i'm one
[36:05.180 --> 36:10.620]  of those who would have liked us to free the slaves without having to shoot all those people
[36:10.620 --> 36:15.020]  well it actually wasn't about that on on record lincoln i could pull up lincoln quotes like i
[36:15.020 --> 36:20.860]  think i'll do that today uh he actually did over who would control western expansion but uh right
[36:20.860 --> 36:26.700]  and and frankly england was able to free their state their slaves without having to go to war
[36:26.700 --> 36:32.220]  so i mean a bottom line is you got to look at where we came from and when you've got a generation
[36:32.220 --> 36:36.860]  of people growing up who know nothing about their history all they learn is what they've observed
[36:36.860 --> 36:41.820]  and that is federal government doing more and more and more and you've got these states here
[36:41.820 --> 36:48.780]  who are left to try and stand up on their own without much to a to a really a very big bully
[36:48.780 --> 36:54.620]  i'm proud of all the states that are filing these i don't know how much we can shake our
[36:54.620 --> 36:59.900]  fist at the federal government and say get your hands off our grubby laws your grubby hands off
[36:59.900 --> 37:05.580]  our good laws um but here's the point um if we don't start somewhere we're going to lose the whole
[37:05.580 --> 37:12.380]  country well exactly because once you have a highly centralized federal government it can sign treaties
[37:12.380 --> 37:17.900]  and deals to sell out sovereignty to a larger uh system which has happened that's what globalism
[37:17.900 --> 37:24.860]  is and what makes those people in washington dc think that they know more about how to educate
[37:24.860 --> 37:31.420]  our children and how to do health care than we do we're the ones who are closer to the people i mean
[37:31.420 --> 37:36.540]  let them take care of defending our borders i'm proud of them for trying to do that in the small
[37:36.540 --> 37:42.540]  capacity they are but look at what we're doing today and ask the bigger question of of what do
[37:42.540 --> 37:51.660]  we need to do to get it back the way it ought to be well absolutely but but you know it is the
[37:51.660 --> 37:57.100]  federal government is to issue and coin the money it is to defend the borders and it is to protect
[37:57.100 --> 38:03.180]  the people's liberties uh but i mean take the 17th amendment we got at the same time we got the
[38:03.180 --> 38:08.220]  income tax right we got the federal reserve act the the foreign banks that the presidents before
[38:08.220 --> 38:14.540]  had fought that always been the major issue in every election previous to that uh they were able to
[38:16.380 --> 38:21.020]  take the senators from the states before we elect the legislators we elect people like
[38:21.020 --> 38:26.860]  representative synthia davis at the at the missouri legislature and then they would vote
[38:26.860 --> 38:33.420]  for the u.s senator and send him or her and then he would be a creature of the state uh so that you
[38:33.420 --> 38:37.980]  had state control over the federal government but notice how they bit how they removed that more
[38:37.980 --> 38:43.260]  and more this is developing well let me talk to you about that for a minute because i do have an
[38:43.260 --> 38:51.660]  opinion i am i am i am a representative of a of a district in and i would have you know when you
[38:51.660 --> 38:59.020]  let the states elect the senators you're going to get more responsiveness and uh there are two
[38:59.020 --> 39:07.900]  times on two occasions that i have had my uh u.s senator write me an email telling me about something
[39:07.900 --> 39:14.780]  and i was so excited to hear that she would write me and i felt special it was addressed
[39:14.780 --> 39:20.860]  representative davis so somebody took the time to even put my name it was not a broadcast email to
[39:20.860 --> 39:28.460]  the whole state it was just to me and um i clicked the reply button and sent her back my thoughts on
[39:28.460 --> 39:35.740]  this very important issue and within minutes my computer screen said undeliverable do you know
[39:35.740 --> 39:42.460]  how that makes me feel if i were in charge of selecting my u.s senator i bet you she'd return
[39:42.460 --> 39:51.660]  my phone calls absolutely well uh they are bought and paid for by offshore banks and corporations
[39:51.660 --> 39:58.380]  they're engaging in crimes against the constitution of the people and i just want folks uh we have a
[39:58.380 --> 40:03.260]  lot of listeners in missouri great people up there the show me state i hope that and that's
[40:03.260 --> 40:06.940]  where we're having different people on from all the different states that are doing this this
[40:06.940 --> 40:11.740]  weekend next week and continuing just hammering this issue they had me on coast to coast a m
[40:11.740 --> 40:15.580]  last night about it they're gonna have me on the next few weeks for three hours on the subject of
[40:15.580 --> 40:23.020]  16 million people and one more thing i'll add though with your point um you know what i worked
[40:23.020 --> 40:28.300]  really hard to get elected and it meant i had to meet my people and find out what they needed in me
[40:28.300 --> 40:35.500]  me we have seen this country go to the highest bidder and even though what happened in illinois
[40:35.500 --> 40:43.500]  with their governor sounded scandalous to many people that is so typical i i'm sure that the
[40:43.500 --> 40:50.140]  governor of illinois has no idea that he did anything wrong because he's so surrounded by people who
[40:50.140 --> 40:58.940]  do that and the the the way politics works people have cynically resolved themselves to which whichever
[40:58.940 --> 41:05.660]  candidate has the most money is likely to win the race not the one who's most in touch with the people
[41:05.660 --> 41:12.700]  not the smartest one not the one best able to govern and the money has gone so far that good
[41:12.700 --> 41:17.900]  honest people who don't have a lot of money just don't have much of a chance of going to washington
[41:17.900 --> 41:22.380]  well it's more than even that what they do is they look at who's the prettiest who has the
[41:22.380 --> 41:28.060]  best tie who has the best dress the best suit who's the most handsome and who the establishment media
[41:28.060 --> 41:34.220]  says uh is the best person when the establishment media again is owned predominantly by offshore
[41:34.220 --> 41:39.740]  corporations of the military industrial complex and so the people like to vote for who they think
[41:39.740 --> 41:44.220]  the winner is so they'll feel like they're a winner they'll associate their personal power
[41:44.220 --> 41:50.140]  with george busher with barack obama when really those people are just pitchmen uh
[41:50.140 --> 41:55.420]  as part of a larger corporate ad campaign well i hope folks will uh what do they do call other
[41:55.420 --> 42:03.500]  members of the state legislature uh in the house and tell them to pass hr 212 well hr 212 is going
[42:03.500 --> 42:08.060]  to is a step in the right direction i think we have to look at the overall philosophy we need
[42:08.060 --> 42:13.420]  to find each other and your radio program is a big part of that helping people realize
[42:13.420 --> 42:18.540]  well number one you're we're educating people as to what our rights are there's a steep learning
[42:18.540 --> 42:25.740]  curve in this country and uh it it really is sad that um i felt like we lost the election when we
[42:25.740 --> 42:31.820]  wound up with john mccain because he didn't have what it took to bring us back to our roots and our
[42:31.820 --> 42:37.180]  philosophy and and the principles that made this a strong nation there's like a don keying boxing
[42:37.180 --> 42:41.420]  match where you know the one guy's not a good boxer you know he's going to lose it's a stage
[42:41.420 --> 42:45.500]  deal and then people just stop watching boxing but we can't just walk away from this this is
[42:45.500 --> 42:52.220]  this is our country yeah and and we'll only get it back if we become informed get involved and
[42:52.220 --> 42:57.900]  support good people who are knowledgeable enough to know and if that's the point the ones winning
[42:57.900 --> 43:03.580]  the elections are the ones with the most money they need to know you know the people who really
[43:03.580 --> 43:09.980]  know how to run the country are usually too busy cutting hair and driving trucks absolutely well
[43:09.980 --> 43:16.540]  we're going to try to support hr 212 in missouri we're going to try to support uh the other pieces
[43:16.540 --> 43:24.780]  of legislation uh like hcr 13 also in your fine state and uh how do people find you or get in
[43:24.780 --> 43:30.060]  contact with you if they want to give you support or oh thank you i've got a website it's synthia

[44:26.220 --> 44:33.100]  21 states and this is a few days old i'm going to go over this list so it's probably more
[44:33.100 --> 44:39.660]  more and then we're going to get into some other news and take your phone calls uh next hour
[44:40.220 --> 44:46.620]  um you know i've actually read books on abraham lincoln i've actually researched his quotes i
[44:46.620 --> 44:57.500]  actually know who he was um abraham lincoln was a luciferian abraham lincoln i mean this is
[44:57.500 --> 45:03.980]  mainline news i mean you can google i mean they're like best-selling new york times history books
[45:04.940 --> 45:10.140]  with the quotes and the witnesses in the i mean he did all sorts of weird occultic rituals he did
[45:10.140 --> 45:18.220]  seances he communicated with the dead his wife was completely uh into stuff and all i hear is
[45:18.220 --> 45:24.380]  this worship of abraham lincoln now now let's get it clear though i'm not saying the south was right
[45:24.380 --> 45:30.620]  either see see people always think it's black or white with these global issues or these international
[45:30.620 --> 45:40.700]  issues or or or or these complex issues abraham lincoln was a very complex person and he did things
[45:41.420 --> 45:47.820]  that the british empire didn't like and they clearly had him killed and he did issue us
[45:47.820 --> 45:53.260]  notes to pay for the war when the roth child's wanting him to go into 25 30 interest with them
[45:53.260 --> 46:00.380]  and then when he wouldn't do it they sided with the south and the south got set up i'm against
[46:00.380 --> 46:05.420]  reconstruction i had ancestors killed in the south i mean it's on tombstones in tig texas you
[46:05.420 --> 46:11.500]  know murdered by federal troops during reconstruction in tig texas we got a hotel by the rail station
[46:11.500 --> 46:20.220]  they burned it and killed everybody robbing and looting but that's the nature of war that's
[46:20.220 --> 46:29.020]  what goes on that's what happens the fact is the british funded in the 1830s the south breaking away
[46:29.020 --> 46:33.740]  from the union but because andrew jackson was from the south from south carolina but then
[46:33.740 --> 46:39.340]  lived in tennessee was famous for the in in wars in tennessee and surrounding areas and then the 18
[46:40.460 --> 46:44.940]  12 war with the british that he won as the general in new orleans and other battles
[46:44.940 --> 46:52.460]  he was such a a a a a hero that he went told the south you're being set up this is a british plot
[46:52.460 --> 46:58.140]  and they backed off over the north you know sucking off the south putting tariffs on
[46:58.140 --> 47:02.540]  what the south could sell not you're not a tariff of stuff coming in tariff on things going out
[47:03.740 --> 47:06.300]  and that's what it was really about who was going to control tariffs who was going to
[47:06.300 --> 47:12.780]  control western expansion with the railroads and lincoln said that and lincoln said uh the south
[47:12.780 --> 47:18.460]  just you know you can keep your slavery uh just uh but we're going to keep the taxes and and the
[47:18.460 --> 47:25.740]  north's going to control what you can and can't do so let me just read you a quote from abraham
[47:25.740 --> 47:33.420]  lincoln this is the collected works of abraham lincoln and edited by roby bassler volume five
[47:33.420 --> 47:42.380]  letter to horace greely august 22nd 1862 page 388 and there's just hundreds of quotes and
[47:42.380 --> 47:50.140]  speeches this is just one my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and it's not
[47:50.140 --> 48:00.060]  either to save or destroy slavery read that again to you my paramount object in this struggle is to
[48:00.060 --> 48:05.420]  save the union and it's not either to save or destroy slavery if i could save the union without
[48:05.420 --> 48:10.140]  freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it
[48:10.140 --> 48:15.680]  And if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would do that also.
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.340]  What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the
[48:20.340 --> 48:26.840]  union and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help save the union.
[48:26.840 --> 48:32.840]  I shall do less whenever I shall believe that I am doing hurts the cause and I shall do
[48:32.840 --> 48:39.600]  more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause.
[48:39.600 --> 48:41.380]  And it goes on and on.
[48:41.380 --> 48:50.100]  The war was not about slavery, but abolitionists who were 2% of the population in 1800 by the
[48:50.100 --> 48:54.260]  1860s were the majority of the North and a large percentage of the South.
[48:54.260 --> 49:00.820]  So they were the popular support and they took over a lot of the war and made that an
[49:00.820 --> 49:04.940]  issue and Lincoln did do that and that was a good thing.
[49:04.940 --> 49:09.260]  But slavery was already on its way out.
[49:09.260 --> 49:13.740]  The human beings that were in bondage were rebelling, they were running away.
[49:13.740 --> 49:19.780]  Only 2% of the population or less in the South had slaves.
[49:19.780 --> 49:25.620]  Slaves were actually used to drive down wages of poor whites and sharecroppers, folks.
[49:25.620 --> 49:29.700]  You know, I had some ancestors that came over as Puritans on the Mayflower, but I had even
[49:29.700 --> 49:36.340]  more because we've done our genealogy, who were slaves, white slaves.
[49:36.340 --> 49:39.820]  Most of them, a lot of my ancestors were indentured servants.
[49:39.820 --> 49:45.700]  And how this worked is you'd sign off for 5, 7, 10, 14 years to pay for your passage
[49:45.700 --> 49:46.700]  over.
[49:46.700 --> 49:53.740]  You'd be some poor starving family in the streets of London or the streets of places
[49:53.740 --> 50:01.340]  in Ireland and Belfast and they would say, get on the ship, sign this contract.
[50:01.340 --> 50:05.740]  You will be fed what they say, you will live where they say, you will be put in irons,
[50:05.740 --> 50:10.260]  you will be whipped, you will be flayed, you will be put in stocks, let's repeat your
[50:10.260 --> 50:14.140]  head and arms and the thing and they lock you up, it's a form of torture because you're
[50:14.140 --> 50:19.620]  hanging there for days, excruciating.
[50:19.620 --> 50:28.460]  And this went on for hundreds of years and you would be brought over.
[50:28.460 --> 50:33.060]  See, that's why the Constitution says no indentured servitude.
[50:33.060 --> 50:38.540]  See, they finally outlawed that, but see it continued.
[50:38.540 --> 50:46.900]  So sharecroppers lived in a little shack and they would go buy stuff from the company store
[50:46.900 --> 50:49.260]  that was owned by the landowner and they never got out of debt.
[50:49.260 --> 50:55.100]  So even though after the 7, 8, 10, 15 years, whatever their indentured servitude was, they
[50:55.100 --> 51:01.860]  never got out of it because of the contract and they were slaves.
[51:01.860 --> 51:06.900]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[51:06.900 --> 51:10.700]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[51:10.700 --> 51:15.620]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[51:15.620 --> 51:19.180]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[51:54.900 --> 52:06.460]  The day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[52:06.460 --> 52:07.980]  against this country.
[52:07.980 --> 52:10.300]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[52:10.300 --> 52:12.180]  But who is the enemy?
[52:12.180 --> 52:13.180]  Bin Laden.
[52:13.180 --> 52:14.180]  This is his MO.
[52:14.180 --> 52:15.180]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[52:15.180 --> 52:17.540]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[52:17.540 --> 52:21.980]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[52:21.980 --> 52:24.580]  networks inside the United States.
[52:24.580 --> 52:29.060]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[52:29.060 --> 52:31.220]  in and on the U.S.
[52:31.220 --> 52:34.780]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:34.780 --> 52:40.380]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:40.380 --> 52:44.500]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[52:44.500 --> 52:45.500]  much more.

[53:05.740 --> 53:08.660]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?

[54:00.660 --> 54:26.860]  Don't want no shackles, don't want no shackles on me, don't want no shackles, don't want
[54:26.860 --> 54:28.380]  no shackles on me.
[54:28.380 --> 54:33.620]  So the sharecropping form of slavery, the debtor prison form of slavery is what the
[54:33.620 --> 54:39.740]  globalists want, where you think you're free, but you're a slave to debt, a slave to their
[54:39.740 --> 54:40.820]  control.
[54:40.820 --> 54:48.980]  And so many of my ancestors were indentured servants, poor people from Germany, Ireland,
[54:48.980 --> 54:49.980]  England.
[54:49.980 --> 54:55.460]  I mean, do you know the main armies the revolutionary fighters fought were German slaves, but they
[54:55.460 --> 55:04.820]  were actual total slaves, the Hessian-German slaves out of Prussia and other areas that
[55:04.820 --> 55:08.900]  war enclave with their whole business, where they invented kindergarten to brainwash the
[55:08.900 --> 55:14.340]  children to be unthinking, as republic school was invented, and you can read the Prussian
[55:14.340 --> 55:21.580]  educators and generals 250 years ago saying we've got to invent systems to have subservient
[55:21.580 --> 55:28.860]  killers who will just follow orders, and you saw the result of kindergarten with the Nazis.
[55:28.860 --> 55:35.420]  They'd go home, rock the baby to sleep, never steal a dime from anybody, completely moral
[55:35.420 --> 55:40.340]  in every respect, but they would follow orders and line children up and blow their heads
[55:40.340 --> 55:46.300]  off, but then go home and kiss their baby at night.
[55:46.300 --> 55:50.940]  And they'd pay every dime of their taxes, and they'd work 15, 16, 18, 20 hours a day.
[55:50.940 --> 55:57.580]  I mean, just legendary work ethic, but if they were told by authority, you'd kill everybody
[55:57.580 --> 55:58.580]  in the town.
[55:58.580 --> 56:00.580]  Hail Hitler!
[56:00.580 --> 56:04.100]  Now that has all been engineered into the American people, and that's why we've got
[56:04.100 --> 56:07.940]  cops that'll do whatever they're told.
[56:07.940 --> 56:11.060]  And so you had German slaves, Hessians.
[56:11.060 --> 56:17.700]  In fact, I think I should Google Hessians and bring up the encyclopedia on Hessian mercenaries.
[56:17.700 --> 56:21.220]  They were war slaves.
[56:21.220 --> 56:25.020]  That's who George Washington beat at Trenton.
[56:25.020 --> 56:26.020]  Now something happened.
[56:26.020 --> 56:27.860]  A lot of the Germans ran away.
[56:27.860 --> 56:31.580]  Once they got here and saw how the colonists were living, once they saw the fruit trees
[56:31.580 --> 56:35.420]  and the happy people in the big German communities, that was one of the little secrets that helped
[56:35.420 --> 56:39.380]  beat the British was so many of their Hessians would desert.
[56:39.380 --> 56:44.100]  Many of them joined the revolutionary cause because they were told that Americans were
[56:44.100 --> 56:49.780]  brutal, that they were evil, they were criminal, and they were brainwashed on the ships on
[56:49.780 --> 56:54.580]  the way over here.
[56:54.580 --> 56:59.500]  So that's the fact, ladies and gentlemen, so see, the only tell you about black slavery.
[56:59.500 --> 57:06.060]  There was white slavery in the United States, but it was called indentured servitude, but
[57:06.060 --> 57:07.060]  you never got out of it.
[57:07.060 --> 57:09.580]  Folks, we have old family land in East Texas.
[57:09.580 --> 57:10.940]  We got it as a Mexican land grant.
[57:10.940 --> 57:13.780]  It was called Spanish, but Mexican land grant in 1829.
[57:13.780 --> 57:20.580]  There are families that have been there as long as ours, but they are sharecroppers on
[57:20.580 --> 57:26.540]  a ranch a few miles down the road, and they have been there generation after generation
[57:26.540 --> 57:35.740]  after generation, living in their little shack houses, working round the clock for some wealthy
[57:35.740 --> 57:39.340]  coal mine owning family.
[57:39.340 --> 57:45.140]  They're sharecroppers and they have nothing, all they can do is run off to the city.
[57:45.140 --> 57:49.020]  That's all people have run off to the city.
[57:49.020 --> 57:52.860]  So you're hearing all this Abraham Lincoln baloney.
[57:52.860 --> 57:58.100]  You just heard him say he'd do whatever he could, that it wasn't about freeing slaves.
[57:58.100 --> 58:03.240]  It was about preserving the union.
[58:03.240 --> 58:09.260]  But what they're doing right now is they are transposing over Lincoln and over George Washington,
[58:09.260 --> 58:10.260]  only Lincoln.
[58:10.260 --> 58:13.900]  I was just watching to see an ender in the break, and they were literally transposed
[58:13.900 --> 58:16.860]  Lincoln's face over Obama's and said, he is Lincoln.
[58:16.860 --> 58:17.860]  He is Lincoln.
[58:17.860 --> 58:18.860]  He is Lincoln.
[58:18.860 --> 58:20.380]  He will preserve the union.
[58:20.380 --> 58:23.820]  When in truth they're destroying the union, bringing in the New World Order, the very
[58:23.820 --> 58:35.140]  bankers that Lincoln fought and the very bankers that set up the South, and what have happened
[58:35.140 --> 58:43.060]  earlier, but old Hickory saw right through him.

[59:54.140 --> 1:00:05.700]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.700 --> 1:00:10.500]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.500 --> 1:00:11.500]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.500 --> 1:00:13.660]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.660 --> 1:00:21.980]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:21.980 --> 1:00:42.820]  I was finishing up with Hessians, war slaves of Germany, they were owned by the local royalty
[1:00:42.820 --> 1:00:49.180]  that were cousins to King George III, so they sent a bunch of their slave soldiers, comprising
[1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:55.900]  I have the numbers here from the Encyclopedia, 25% of the total British force.
[1:00:55.900 --> 1:00:59.700]  But they loved being slaves, that's the object of mind control.
[1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:01.620]  They loved that they were slaves.
[1:01:01.620 --> 1:01:04.060]  They loved that they were taken in a young age and lived in dormitories.
[1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:10.900]  They loved, they believed that was their job to fight and die.
[1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:17.780]  But reading here in the Encyclopedia, it does say that in addition, American rebels,
[1:01:17.780 --> 1:01:22.100]  propaganda against Hessians, the entire Hessians to desert and join the large German American
[1:01:22.100 --> 1:01:28.900]  population, one letter promised 50 acres of land to every deserter in a satirical letter,
[1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:34.820]  the sale of Hessians written in August 1777, claimed that a Hessian commander wanted more
[1:01:34.820 --> 1:01:39.180]  of his soldiers dead so that he could be better compensated.
[1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:47.700]  For many years, the letter was of unknown authorship, and it goes on, the British general
[1:01:47.700 --> 1:01:53.620]  John Burgone surrendered to the American general, Ratio Gates, during the Saratoga campaign,
[1:01:53.620 --> 1:01:59.460]  a surrender involved around 5,800 troops, the surrender was negotiated in the convention
[1:01:59.460 --> 1:02:01.660]  of Saratoga, it just goes on and on.
[1:02:01.660 --> 1:02:06.860]  You can just type Hessian mercenaries, Hessian slaves, you can go read it for yourself.
[1:02:06.860 --> 1:02:12.020]  But I mean, are we talking about reparations to German Americans because some of them were
[1:02:12.020 --> 1:02:13.020]  slaves?
[1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:17.220]  See, they just don't teach all this, they just want to stir everybody up against each
[1:02:17.220 --> 1:02:22.980]  other and then have Barack Obama prance around and, I mean, they're saying he freed the slaves,
[1:02:22.980 --> 1:02:28.220]  it's like, he freed the African slaves in the United States.
[1:02:28.220 --> 1:02:34.780]  And he's Abraham Lincoln, I mean, this is sick, a one-term US Senator, four years in
[1:02:34.780 --> 1:02:39.620]  the US Senate, didn't even fill out his six years term, and it is just messianic, he is
[1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:44.620]  God, he is God, he is God, he is God, he will fix it, he will save us.
[1:02:44.620 --> 1:02:47.460]  All right, I'm going to go over more of this later.
[1:02:47.460 --> 1:02:51.940]  We've got Mark Dice coming up in about an hour, Russell Means, a Native American leader
[1:02:51.940 --> 1:02:54.980]  coming on as well.
[1:02:54.980 --> 1:03:01.660]  But I do have a lot of other news here I want to get into, particularly Obama, I want to
[1:03:01.660 --> 1:03:05.220]  break down the psychology a little bit more of what they're doing, but before I do that,
[1:03:05.220 --> 1:03:09.420]  I want to give the phone number out for folks to get involved on air today.
[1:03:09.420 --> 1:03:23.620]  1-800-259-9231-1800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[1:03:23.620 --> 1:03:29.060]  And I want to go over a lot of other police state news and economic news as well today.
[1:03:29.060 --> 1:03:33.740]  But first, when we come back, I want to get into this New York Times article, laid off
[1:03:33.740 --> 1:03:39.180]  foreigners flee as Dubai spirals downward, you're like, why do I care about Dubai?
[1:03:39.180 --> 1:03:44.180]  Well, that's where Blackwater moved, it's where Halliburton moved, it's where literally
[1:03:44.180 --> 1:03:51.700]  thousands of US corporations moved, the big ones, and they moved their main base of operations
[1:03:51.700 --> 1:03:58.820]  over there because of the low taxes and the no extradition, Cheney bought a house over
[1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:04.340]  there, Bush bought, I forget how many hundreds of thousands of acres in Paraguay with no
[1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:11.260]  extradition, but laid off foreigners flee as Dubai spirals down.
[1:04:11.260 --> 1:04:15.900]  And I want to go over this because this was supposedly the wealthiest, richest, greatest
[1:04:15.900 --> 1:04:21.680]  place with the tallest building in the world, and it looked like some type of futuristic
[1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:28.780]  space city, but this shows you the power of the bankers and how they set up societies.
[1:04:28.780 --> 1:04:37.620]  So we're going to go over this when we get back and then your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[1:04:37.620 --> 1:04:44.540]  Don't forget the Obama deception is now on sale at prisonplanet.tv, you can sign up
[1:04:44.540 --> 1:04:49.500]  to see it first when it comes out March 15, you can pre-order DVDs now, those that pre-order

[1:04:55.060 --> 1:05:01.620]  mailed to you day one if you get that first order and if you get in early.
[1:05:01.620 --> 1:05:05.580]  Phase one of the insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with the recent
[1:05:05.580 --> 1:05:06.580]  bailout.
[1:05:06.580 --> 1:05:10.660]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a
[1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:15.500]  new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour, but we've only seen the beginning.
[1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:20.180]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times, shortages
[1:05:20.180 --> 1:05:23.460]  and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:28.060]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[1:05:28.060 --> 1:05:32.380]  Phase one is a one world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[1:05:32.380 --> 1:05:36.380]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[1:05:36.380 --> 1:05:46.380]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details, that's www.foodshortageusa.com to learn how
[1:05:46.380 --> 1:05:47.380]  to prepare for the unthinkable.

[1:06:01.540 --> 1:06:07.180]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against
[1:06:07.180 --> 1:06:08.180]  this country.
[1:06:08.180 --> 1:06:12.060]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:06:12.060 --> 1:06:13.060]  Bin Laden.
[1:06:13.060 --> 1:06:14.060]  This is his M.O.
[1:06:14.060 --> 1:06:17.620]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:06:17.620 --> 1:06:22.260]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:06:22.260 --> 1:06:24.820]  networks inside the United States.
[1:06:24.820 --> 1:06:29.300]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:06:29.300 --> 1:06:35.300]  in and on the U.S.
[1:06:35.300 --> 1:06:40.620]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:06:40.620 --> 1:06:44.660]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[1:06:44.660 --> 1:06:45.660]  much more.
[1:06:45.660 --> 1:06:46.660]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:06:51.780 --> 1:06:53.780]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:06:53.780 --> 1:07:01.740]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:07:01.740 --> 1:07:02.740]  You worry.
[1:07:02.740 --> 1:07:04.700]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[1:07:04.700 --> 1:07:07.340]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:09.500]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[1:07:09.500 --> 1:07:11.180]  Your answer may be at hand.
[1:07:11.180 --> 1:07:14.700]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[1:07:14.700 --> 1:07:18.720]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:20.140]  God's green earth.
[1:07:20.140 --> 1:07:23.860]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:28.500]  The cost of learning is minimal, wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[1:07:28.500 --> 1:07:31.980]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:36.380]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards
[1:07:36.380 --> 1:07:40.660]  and video, with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.

[1:07:58.500 --> 1:08:01.420]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[1:08:01.420 --> 1:08:07.340]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[1:08:07.340 --> 1:08:15.380]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:15.380 --> 1:08:22.260]  New York Times today laid off farmers flee as Dubai spirals down.
[1:08:22.260 --> 1:08:25.900]  Just three, four months ago, it was the apple of the world's eye, the tallest building was
[1:08:25.900 --> 1:08:30.900]  glistening, looked like some type of sci-fi spaceport.
[1:08:30.900 --> 1:08:37.380]  Now Sophia, 34-year-old French woman, moved there a year ago to take a job in advertising,
[1:08:37.380 --> 1:08:42.500]  so confident about Dubai's fast-growing economy that she bought an apartment for almost $300,000
[1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:44.420]  with a 15-year mortgage.
[1:08:44.420 --> 1:08:49.740]  Now like many of the foreign workers who make up 90% of the population here, she has been
[1:08:49.740 --> 1:08:55.900]  laid off and faces the prospect of being forced to live and to leave the Persian Gulf City
[1:08:55.900 --> 1:08:56.900]  or worse.
[1:08:56.900 --> 1:09:01.580]  And it goes on to say they've now met it illegal to talk about the economic crisis punishable
[1:09:01.580 --> 1:09:02.580]  by arrest.
[1:09:02.580 --> 1:09:03.580]  I'll get to that in a minute.
[1:09:03.580 --> 1:09:08.580]  I'm really scared of what could happen because I bought property here, said Sophia, who asked
[1:09:08.580 --> 1:09:14.980]  that her last name be withheld because she is still hurting, hunting for a new job.
[1:09:14.980 --> 1:09:19.940]  If I can't pay it off, I was told I could end up in debtor's prison.
[1:09:19.940 --> 1:09:23.820]  They have that all over the world except here in the United States and Canada.
[1:09:23.820 --> 1:09:30.300]  With Dubai's economy in freefall, newspapers have reported that more than 3,000 cars sit
[1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:36.180]  abandoned in the parking lot at the Dubai airport, left by fleeing debt-ridden foreigners
[1:09:36.180 --> 1:09:39.620]  who could in fact be imprisoned if they fail to pay their bills.
[1:09:39.620 --> 1:09:40.860]  See, this is global.
[1:09:40.860 --> 1:09:41.860]  There's nowhere to run.
[1:09:41.860 --> 1:09:43.020]  The bankers have set all this up.
[1:09:43.020 --> 1:09:45.420]  I'm going to get into that in a moment.
[1:09:45.420 --> 1:09:55.740]  Summer said to have maxed out credit cards inside and notes of apology taped to the windshield.
[1:09:55.740 --> 1:09:59.220]  The government says the real number is much lower, but the story is contained at least
[1:09:59.220 --> 1:10:00.660]  a grain of truth.
[1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:05.660]  Jobless people here lose their work, visas, and then must leave the country within a month.
[1:10:05.660 --> 1:10:11.180]  That in turn reduces spending, creates housing vacancies, and lowers real estate prices in
[1:10:11.180 --> 1:10:16.740]  a downward spiral that has left parts of Dubai once hailed as the economic superpower of
[1:10:16.740 --> 1:10:19.900]  the Middle East looking like a ghost town.
[1:10:19.900 --> 1:10:24.620]  No one knows how bad things have become, though it is clear that tens of thousands have left
[1:10:24.620 --> 1:10:28.980]  real estate prices have crashed and scores of Dubai's major construction projects have
[1:10:28.980 --> 1:10:30.700]  been suspended or canceled.
[1:10:30.700 --> 1:10:35.540]  But with the government unwilling to provide data, rumors are bound to flourish, damaging
[1:10:35.540 --> 1:10:38.620]  confidence, and further undermining the economy.
[1:10:38.620 --> 1:10:42.300]  Instead of moving towards greater transparency, the Emirates seem to be moving in the other
[1:10:42.300 --> 1:10:43.300]  direction.
[1:10:43.300 --> 1:10:48.580]  A new draft media law would make it a crime to damage the country's reputation or economy
[1:10:48.580 --> 1:10:57.700]  punishable by fines of up to one million dirhams, about $272,000.
[1:10:57.700 --> 1:11:02.180]  Some say it is already having a chilling effect on reporting about the crisis.
[1:11:02.180 --> 1:11:06.380]  This month, local newspapers reported that Dubai was cancelling 1,500 work visas every
[1:11:06.380 --> 1:11:09.060]  day citing unnamed government officials.
[1:11:09.060 --> 1:11:10.180]  Ask about the number.
[1:11:10.180 --> 1:11:17.180]  Umad bin Dimas, a spokesman for Dubai's labor ministry, said he would not confirm or deny
[1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:19.420]  it and refuse to comment further.
[1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:21.220]  Some say the true figure is much higher.
[1:11:21.220 --> 1:11:26.780]  At the moment, there is a readiness to believe the worst, said Simon Williams, HSBC Bank
[1:11:26.780 --> 1:11:29.060]  Chief Economist in Dubai.
[1:11:29.060 --> 1:11:34.500]  And the limits on data make it very difficult to counter rumors.
[1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:35.620]  And it goes on.
[1:11:35.620 --> 1:11:36.620]  Some things are clear.
[1:11:36.620 --> 1:11:39.420]  Real estate prices, which rose dramatically during Dubai's six-year boom, have dropped
[1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:43.220]  30% or more over the past two or three months in some parts of the city.
[1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:47.340]  Last week, Moody's Investor Service announced that it might downgrade its ratings on six
[1:11:47.340 --> 1:11:52.500]  Dubai's most prominent state-owned companies, citing a determination in the economic deterioration,
[1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:54.420]  the economic outlook.
[1:11:54.420 --> 1:11:56.900]  So many use luxury cars for sale.
[1:11:56.900 --> 1:12:01.140]  They're sometimes sold for 40% less than asking price two months ago.
[1:12:01.140 --> 1:12:02.540]  See how fast that's happening?
[1:12:02.540 --> 1:12:07.220]  Car dealers say Dubai's roads usually thick with traffic at this time of year are now
[1:12:07.220 --> 1:12:10.220]  mostly empty or clear.
[1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:14.260]  Some analysts say the crisis is likely to have long-lasting effects on the seven-member
[1:12:14.260 --> 1:12:20.780]  Emirates Federation, where Dubai has long played rebellious younger brother to the oil-rich
[1:12:20.780 --> 1:12:23.620]  and more conservative Abu Dhabi.
[1:12:23.620 --> 1:12:28.060]  Dubai officials swallowing their pride have made clear that they will be more open to
[1:12:28.060 --> 1:12:35.060]  a bailout, but so far the Abu Dhabi has offered assistance only in its own banks.
[1:12:35.060 --> 1:12:39.220]  And it goes on from there.
[1:12:39.220 --> 1:12:44.820]  For many foreigners, Dubai had seemed at first to be a refuge, relatively isolated, insulated
[1:12:44.820 --> 1:12:47.980]  from the panic that began hitting the rest of the world last autumn.
[1:12:47.980 --> 1:12:52.580]  The Persian Gulf is cushioned by vast oil and gas wealth, and some who lost jobs in
[1:12:52.580 --> 1:12:57.580]  New York and London began applying there, and then it goes on, except that oil has gone
[1:12:57.580 --> 1:13:03.500]  from $150 a barrel, actually went to $151, but that was only for a few days.
[1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:08.180]  It hung up at $147, $148 for a month.
[1:13:08.180 --> 1:13:09.180]  Remember that.
[1:13:09.180 --> 1:13:19.220]  And then six and a half months ago, it began plunging, and it has plunged down to $40 a
[1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:20.220]  barrel.
[1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:22.620]  Let's get the latest numbers on this.
[1:13:22.620 --> 1:13:24.820]  I heard them say $42 on the news yesterday.
[1:13:24.820 --> 1:13:31.860]  Let me see, oil price, just give an exact number here.
[1:13:31.860 --> 1:13:41.100]  Crude oil forecast, let me find this, got one of these indexes, found out what oil is
[1:13:41.100 --> 1:13:42.540]  trading for today.
[1:13:42.540 --> 1:13:47.300]  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:53.100]  Crude oil is trading for $35.69.
[1:13:53.100 --> 1:13:58.260]  I mean, this is incredible.
[1:13:58.260 --> 1:13:59.260]  I'm looking at the graph.
[1:13:59.260 --> 1:14:12.660]  Yeah, it was $42 yesterday, okay, so it's dropped $6 and changed.
[1:14:12.660 --> 1:14:15.140]  So there you have it.
[1:14:15.140 --> 1:14:22.420]  I was on my infowars.com website today, I was reading some comments and saw a guy laughing
[1:14:22.420 --> 1:14:29.180]  at me in there saying, Alex is a liar, Lindsey Williams is a liar, oil is at $50 a barrel.
[1:14:29.180 --> 1:14:32.460]  And I'm like, what?
[1:14:32.460 --> 1:14:36.540]  It was Lindsey just used a ballpark number and said $50 a few days ago.
[1:14:36.540 --> 1:14:40.140]  I mean, it's at $36 right now.
[1:14:40.140 --> 1:14:45.220]  I mean, this guy's going, oh no, it's way more than that.
[1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:49.260]  I mean, are these people that stupid or are these disinfo operatives?
[1:14:49.260 --> 1:14:55.260]  I mean, they just, whatever we say, they say it's the opposite.
[1:14:55.260 --> 1:15:00.420]  They go on our stories and say a plane hit Building 7, they just don't care.
[1:15:00.420 --> 1:15:05.500]  You idiots are so committed to your new oil order, they're still writing articles, blogs
[1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:09.900]  and even major news sites are writing articles saying I'm insane, others are insane, there's
[1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:14.180]  no new world order and the term new order doesn't mean anything.
[1:15:14.180 --> 1:15:20.660]  Oh really, Time Magazine says it means a new global bank over every nation setting its
[1:15:20.660 --> 1:15:27.780]  rules on its economy, on its banking, on its finance, and a quote, knocking heads even
[1:15:27.780 --> 1:15:28.780]  of the US.
[1:15:28.780 --> 1:15:31.260]  I read the quote twice yesterday.
[1:15:31.260 --> 1:15:34.340]  You can Google New World Order Time Magazine and read the thing.
[1:15:34.340 --> 1:15:37.740]  It's the Thursday, February 5th issue.
[1:15:37.740 --> 1:15:43.860]  I mean, I'm seeing these articles every time I look that there's hundreds and hundreds
[1:15:43.860 --> 1:15:49.020]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[1:15:49.020 --> 1:15:53.820]  saying they're creating a new world order run by banks you'll pay your taxes to and
[1:15:53.820 --> 1:15:56.940]  they'll run the entire planet and the United States.
[1:15:56.940 --> 1:16:01.980]  And that's the Bretton Woods new thing that Timothy Geithner's going to do.
[1:16:01.980 --> 1:16:08.980]  And then I got people going, you lying, coke, none of that's happening, there's no new world
[1:16:08.980 --> 1:16:09.980]  order.
[1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:14.340]  I mean, you people, don't you understand just because you're in the military or you're
[1:16:14.340 --> 1:16:22.900]  in PsyOps or you work for the government that you aren't a pet puppy, as Mark Corky likes
[1:16:22.900 --> 1:16:26.180]  to say, you are not a pet puppy.
[1:16:26.180 --> 1:16:27.700]  Get it through your head.
[1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:35.780]  Hey, how did World War II in for the German soldiers, 11 million dead German soldiers,
[1:16:35.780 --> 1:16:39.020]  at least 10 million dead Germans, 20 plus mill.
[1:16:39.020 --> 1:16:40.540]  How does that sound for you?
[1:16:40.540 --> 1:16:43.060]  I mean, you know, because that's what's going to have happened in our country.
[1:16:43.060 --> 1:16:50.700]  We are Nazi Germany, except the globalists just want to euthanize everybody.
[1:16:50.700 --> 1:16:54.100]  They don't care what color you are.
[1:16:54.100 --> 1:16:57.260]  All you sniveling know it all, all of you.
[1:16:57.260 --> 1:17:03.540]  You're so invested in being right and you're so upset that we're right and we told you
[1:17:03.540 --> 1:17:09.580]  everything to the T that was going to happen, that you're so scared deep down that you can't
[1:17:09.580 --> 1:17:10.580]  face this.
[1:17:10.580 --> 1:17:13.700]  You say we're making it up.
[1:17:13.700 --> 1:17:21.180]  Now going back to the New York Times and Dubai, in a real economy that has real commerce
[1:17:21.180 --> 1:17:27.620]  and real jobs in manufacturing and in crops and a culture.
[1:17:27.620 --> 1:17:29.260]  Humans want to buy things from each other.
[1:17:29.260 --> 1:17:31.020]  People want to manufacture things.
[1:17:31.020 --> 1:17:35.620]  If you have a good currency run by the government and the public's educated on monetary systems
[1:17:35.620 --> 1:17:39.700]  and you don't have private banks that take over and take advantage of this, then you
[1:17:39.700 --> 1:17:41.340]  cannot have collapses.
[1:17:41.340 --> 1:17:43.180]  You cannot have major runs.
[1:17:43.180 --> 1:17:48.260]  You can have small localized ones, but the system so diversified that economies just
[1:17:48.260 --> 1:17:50.300]  grow at 10 to 14 percent.
[1:17:50.300 --> 1:17:55.540]  Like the United States did for hundreds of years, over a hundred years straight.
[1:17:55.540 --> 1:17:57.980]  And other nations that have done it, it's the same deal.
[1:17:57.980 --> 1:18:05.300]  But throughout history, for 3,000 plus years, there have been money manipulators.
[1:18:05.300 --> 1:18:09.580]  And they take over the government and they say only this seashell or this tally stick
[1:18:09.580 --> 1:18:13.100]  or this can be used as money.
[1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:18.580]  And then they manipulate the currency and they set it up where they can buy up all the
[1:18:18.580 --> 1:18:21.580]  real goods.
[1:18:21.580 --> 1:18:25.420]  And it doesn't matter what invention you've got or how intelligent you are or how good
[1:18:25.420 --> 1:18:32.620]  your product is, the bankers have unlimited currency they created, unlimited liquidity.
[1:18:32.620 --> 1:18:35.620]  But everybody out there isn't going to sell what they've got.
[1:18:35.620 --> 1:18:40.220]  So they have to destroy the world economy to buy everything up with the fiat system.
[1:18:40.220 --> 1:18:42.540]  They have to create a fire sale.
[1:18:42.540 --> 1:18:44.620]  And I keep repeating this because it's so important.
[1:18:44.620 --> 1:18:45.860]  People still aren't getting this.
[1:18:45.860 --> 1:18:48.500]  This is designed in their own documents in triplicate.
[1:18:48.500 --> 1:18:52.900]  I mean, I've made films years before this even started saying exactly what would happen.
[1:18:52.900 --> 1:18:54.060]  We're on record, folks.
[1:18:54.060 --> 1:18:55.560]  We're right.
[1:18:55.560 --> 1:19:00.100]  My book, The Sentin' to Terrany, published seven years ago.
[1:19:00.100 --> 1:19:01.100]  Almost out of print.
[1:19:01.100 --> 1:19:04.940]  There's 200 of them left, by the way.
[1:19:04.940 --> 1:19:08.820]  And I'm not putting it back in print.
[1:19:08.820 --> 1:19:12.500]  I should, but I said I wasn't, so I'm going to do what I said I was going to do.
[1:19:12.500 --> 1:19:22.020]  The point is that this is all by design and they have to have a fire sale.
[1:19:22.020 --> 1:19:29.500]  If you want a simple analogy, go watch the latest Die Hard where a government official
[1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:34.100]  controls the Social Security bank accounts and implodes and steals tens of trillions
[1:19:34.100 --> 1:19:35.740]  of dollars in minutes.
[1:19:35.740 --> 1:19:37.420]  That is what happened.
[1:19:37.420 --> 1:19:39.740]  They just cut it off.
[1:19:39.740 --> 1:19:43.740]  They get you totally dependent on their fiat currency and then they just cut it off when
[1:19:43.740 --> 1:19:46.860]  they get you in debt and set up and ready.
[1:19:46.860 --> 1:19:48.580]  They then engage their operation.
[1:19:48.580 --> 1:19:53.420]  They have their puppet savior waiting in the wings, all scripted, all choreographed,
[1:19:53.420 --> 1:19:55.060]  and they are going to give us no quarter.
[1:19:55.060 --> 1:19:56.700]  Do you understand?
[1:19:56.700 --> 1:19:57.700]  This is engineered.
[1:19:57.700 --> 1:20:03.740]  The headlines are clear.
[1:20:03.740 --> 1:20:06.700]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:09.900]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[1:20:09.900 --> 1:20:11.940]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[1:20:11.940 --> 1:20:15.100]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[1:20:15.100 --> 1:20:19.620]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.
[1:20:19.620 --> 1:20:24.540]  Now Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit, 24 varieties of all natural
[1:20:24.540 --> 1:20:28.700]  non-genetically modified heirloom seeds for true patriots and homesteaders wanting food
[1:20:28.700 --> 1:20:29.700]  insurance.

[1:24:06.100 --> 1:24:11.900]  Mark Dice is coming up in about 36 minutes with us today.
[1:24:11.900 --> 1:24:15.020]  Got Russell Names coming on as well to get his take on all these states.
[1:24:15.020 --> 1:24:19.620]  Sam, you're not going along with the union, the New World Order.
[1:24:19.620 --> 1:24:24.820]  How that ties into four states that the Lakota Nation is pulling out of its treaty that's
[1:24:24.820 --> 1:24:26.820]  been broken with the globalist.
[1:24:26.820 --> 1:24:34.260]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls and I'll get into all this other news.
[1:24:34.260 --> 1:24:36.100]  Let's talk to Bart in Kentucky.
[1:24:36.100 --> 1:24:38.380]  Bart, you are on the air worldwide.
[1:24:38.380 --> 1:24:41.380]  It's great to talk to you.
[1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:46.820]  I just had a few things I wanted to go over with you, mainly I guess the stimulus bill
[1:24:46.820 --> 1:24:50.700]  because it's kind of in our faces right now.
[1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:56.100]  I think it's really important people know that it's not just about the so-called economic
[1:24:56.100 --> 1:24:57.100]  stimulus.
[1:24:57.100 --> 1:25:02.340]  There are a lot of other things buried inside the thousands of pages.
[1:25:02.340 --> 1:25:07.100]  This one from the Lone Star Times, militarizing police departments with your bailout money,
[1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:11.660]  buying them tanks, armored vehicles, helicopters, federalizing when they sign these deals.
[1:25:11.660 --> 1:25:18.180]  They go under federal control, golf courses for politicians, money to Las Vegas for more
[1:25:18.180 --> 1:25:19.180]  hotels.
[1:25:19.180 --> 1:25:24.300]  I mean, the list goes on and on and rationing health care to old people.
[1:25:24.300 --> 1:25:30.540]  Yeah, it's not just plus the $800 billion stimulus package, it's changing every day
[1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:37.660]  up and down, is a diversion from the now nine plus trillion, according to Bloomberg, stolen
[1:25:37.660 --> 1:25:39.660]  by the banks that's gone offshore.
[1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:40.660]  Go ahead.
[1:25:40.660 --> 1:25:44.900]  I would actually that with the health care issue that you touched on a minute ago is
[1:25:44.900 --> 1:25:50.340]  kind of something I was wanting to elaborate on as well because I guess Rima Labo who I'm
[1:25:50.340 --> 1:25:54.460]  sure you know very well, but actually like from your show, I started getting to a lot
[1:25:54.460 --> 1:25:58.860]  of her stuff with natural health or the Natural Solutions Foundation and she actually sent
[1:25:58.860 --> 1:26:05.020]  out an email blast yesterday talking about how, you know, just a list of things.
[1:26:05.020 --> 1:26:09.380]  Number one, the federal system that they're actually adding a federal system in this stimulus
[1:26:09.380 --> 1:26:14.980]  bill that will apparently track electronically all medical treatments and they're already
[1:26:14.980 --> 1:26:15.980]  doing that.
[1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:16.980]  It just further funds it.
[1:26:16.980 --> 1:26:17.980]  Yes.
[1:26:17.980 --> 1:26:25.180]  In fact, let's get, let's get Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine back on the show and go
[1:26:25.180 --> 1:26:26.180]  ahead.
[1:26:26.180 --> 1:26:31.820]  I think that some of your best, you guess, you ever have on, I mean, the wealth of knowledge
[1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:35.820]  that both of them combined have together, I mean, it's just, they're definitely some
[1:26:35.820 --> 1:26:38.940]  of the best guests that I've ever, I mean, I've been listening to this show for about
[1:26:38.940 --> 1:26:44.260]  a year now and I definitely make sure to tune in whenever they come on because, I mean,
[1:26:44.260 --> 1:26:49.180]  the combination of her health, knowledge and his military background is pretty much
[1:26:49.180 --> 1:26:51.780]  un-comparable, to be honest with you.
[1:26:51.780 --> 1:26:57.420]  Well, their info checks out and it's all, we have a lot of guests on, but go through
[1:26:57.420 --> 1:27:00.740]  some of the things she points out because, I mean, even Bloomberg pointed this out, but
[1:27:00.740 --> 1:27:01.740]  go ahead.
[1:27:01.740 --> 1:27:05.900]  A lot of this wasn't Bloomberg actually, she actually referenced that article.
[1:27:05.900 --> 1:27:10.140]  Another one was that apparently it creates a position that is being titled the National
[1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:13.700]  Coordinator of Health Information Technology.
[1:27:13.700 --> 1:27:18.820]  Apparently whoever's in that post will then monitor your treatments to supposedly make
[1:27:18.820 --> 1:27:22.740]  sure your doctor is doing what the federal government deems up to be a failure.
[1:27:22.740 --> 1:27:27.500]  Oh no, it says in the bill that old folks won't get eye surgery or brain surgery.
[1:27:27.500 --> 1:27:34.420]  I mean, I mean, they always denied this before and it's got quotes from Daschle in Bloomberg
[1:27:34.420 --> 1:27:37.340]  saying, oh, you know, it's time for you to die.
[1:27:37.340 --> 1:27:39.340]  I mean, these people are sick.
[1:27:39.340 --> 1:27:44.540]  Daschle's up for the secretary position for the health department and this is all pretty
[1:27:44.540 --> 1:27:47.140]  much laid out in his book that he wrote in 1998.
[1:27:47.140 --> 1:27:54.380]  And he says in the book, you've got to go ahead and go blind that, you know, I can pull
[1:27:54.380 --> 1:27:57.380]  the quote, he says, old folks, you're not supposed to get better, you're supposed to
[1:27:57.380 --> 1:27:58.380]  die.
[1:27:58.380 --> 1:28:01.700]  You have that quote, go ahead and read it.
[1:28:01.700 --> 1:28:03.180]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[1:28:03.180 --> 1:28:07.100]  I mean, it's all just off the charts, see, they want to control resources.
[1:28:07.100 --> 1:28:12.300]  We have unlimited, we have advanced technology, we can go to the stars, you know, and they
[1:28:12.300 --> 1:28:13.900]  play old off against young.
[1:28:13.900 --> 1:28:19.420]  Oh, young people, you'll get even more care, but the old people, the bioethicist boards
[1:28:19.420 --> 1:28:23.540]  in the federal government will decide what treatment you get and if you've been obese
[1:28:23.540 --> 1:28:27.500]  in your life, you don't get treatment or if you've been drinking or if you've ever smoked
[1:28:27.500 --> 1:28:32.420]  or they want control over your life.
[1:28:32.420 --> 1:28:34.180]  I completely agree.
[1:28:34.180 --> 1:28:35.420]  They say it.
[1:28:35.420 --> 1:28:36.420]  They say it.
[1:28:36.420 --> 1:28:38.580]  I mean, it's outrageous.
[1:28:38.580 --> 1:28:46.380]  It actually also adds new penalties such as that hospitals and doctors that are not quote
[1:28:46.380 --> 1:28:52.500]  meaningful users, an end quote of the new system will face penalties and then it doesn't
[1:28:52.500 --> 1:28:53.500]  even go into.
[1:28:53.500 --> 1:28:55.020]  But let me tell you how they're enforcing it.
[1:28:55.020 --> 1:28:56.220]  Let me tell you how they're enforcing it.
[1:28:56.220 --> 1:28:58.380]  Any bill they pass, they've already implemented.
[1:28:58.380 --> 1:28:59.780]  My dad's a dentist.
[1:28:59.780 --> 1:29:06.980]  They have the dental societies ordering them through their group without law, just a regulation
[1:29:06.980 --> 1:29:15.180]  of a private group to do this, to do that, to, you know, to, to, to let the HMOs practice
[1:29:15.180 --> 1:29:16.180]  medicine.
[1:29:16.180 --> 1:29:21.260]  So they bought off the different dental guilds, the medical guilds that regulate, you understand
[1:29:21.260 --> 1:29:22.260]  that self-regulate.
[1:29:22.260 --> 1:29:23.260]  It's disgusting.
[1:29:23.260 --> 1:29:24.260]  It's disgusting.
[1:29:24.260 --> 1:29:27.940]  I hear you got, you got me ranting.
[1:29:27.940 --> 1:29:28.940]  What's the name of that article?
[1:29:28.940 --> 1:29:31.540]  We'll put a link up on info wars dot com to labos article.
[1:29:31.540 --> 1:29:32.540]  Dr. Laban.
[1:29:32.540 --> 1:29:33.540]  What do you want to talk about?
[1:29:33.540 --> 1:29:34.540]  Just tell me fast.
[1:29:34.540 --> 1:29:35.900]  Tell me the name of the bill.
[1:29:35.900 --> 1:29:37.780]  Tell me the name of the article.
[1:29:37.780 --> 1:29:41.620]  The name of the article, what's actually, you can just go to natural health.
[1:29:41.620 --> 1:29:44.340]  I'm sorry, it's natural solutions foundation dot org.
[1:29:44.340 --> 1:29:45.340]  Yeah, we'll.
[1:29:45.340 --> 1:29:46.340]  Actually in the main page.
[1:29:46.340 --> 1:29:47.340]  All right, thank you.
[1:29:47.340 --> 1:29:48.340]  All right, thank you.
[1:29:48.340 --> 1:29:51.820]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you 30 seconds on the other side to finish out the other calls.
[1:29:51.820 --> 1:29:53.100]  We're on the march.
[1:29:53.100 --> 1:29:55.500]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.500 --> 1:30:02.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:02.460 --> 1:30:07.100]  Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing
[1:30:07.100 --> 1:30:08.500]  the U.S. and the world.
[1:30:08.500 --> 1:30:12.420]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[1:30:12.420 --> 1:30:16.900]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated
[1:30:16.900 --> 1:30:18.940]  foods for almost 40 years.
[1:30:18.940 --> 1:30:23.580]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[1:30:23.580 --> 1:30:28.460]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with doubly-nammeled cans and nitrogen
[1:30:28.460 --> 1:30:29.460]  packaging.
[1:30:29.460 --> 1:30:33.880]  Purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.

[1:30:39.700 --> 1:30:41.820]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[1:31:00.260 --> 1:31:06.420]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:31:06.420 --> 1:31:07.920]  against this country.
[1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:11.620]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:31:11.620 --> 1:31:12.620]  Bin Laden.
[1:31:12.620 --> 1:31:13.620]  This is his MO.
[1:31:13.620 --> 1:31:14.620]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:31:14.620 --> 1:31:17.140]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:21.900]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:31:21.900 --> 1:31:24.500]  networks inside the United States.
[1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:28.980]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:31:28.980 --> 1:31:31.140]  in and on the U.S.
[1:31:31.140 --> 1:31:34.900]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:34.900 --> 1:31:40.300]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:31:40.300 --> 1:31:44.100]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[1:31:44.100 --> 1:31:45.460]  much, much more.
[1:31:45.460 --> 1:31:46.460]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:33:18.660 --> 1:33:26.940]  I'm going to touch on a few things that have been going on here.
[1:33:26.940 --> 1:33:31.020]  The National Guard presence is a really big issue.
[1:33:31.020 --> 1:33:37.820]  We actually had Hurricane I came through here in September, knocked down a lot of power.
[1:33:37.820 --> 1:33:39.420]  National Guard was all over the city.
[1:33:39.420 --> 1:33:43.620]  An ice storm came through here last week, knocked down a lot more power.
[1:33:43.620 --> 1:33:47.900]  National Guard was all over the city, policing with guns and everything, and at the exact
[1:33:47.900 --> 1:33:51.020]  same time, Kentucky Derby, they police that now.
[1:33:51.020 --> 1:33:54.820]  We have a festival here that's city-wide called Thunder of the Blue Bull.
[1:33:54.820 --> 1:33:59.460]  They were also present at it, and they now seem to be at any major event.
[1:33:59.460 --> 1:34:00.460]  I hear you.
[1:34:00.460 --> 1:34:03.060]  Shoot some video posted on YouTube or send it to us.
[1:34:03.060 --> 1:34:04.060]  I appreciate your call.
[1:34:04.060 --> 1:34:06.660]  For people to say, well, that was because of the ice storm.
[1:34:06.660 --> 1:34:13.460]  I remember a few months after 9-11 in Iowa, local newscast we played on air, where it
[1:34:13.460 --> 1:34:18.220]  showed National Guard searching people on the side of the highway.
[1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:22.180]  We caught this in Texas, too, and then coming over to the news station and saying, turn
[1:34:22.180 --> 1:34:26.940]  your cameras off, but then the news station was still saying that was a good thing.
[1:34:26.940 --> 1:34:31.420]  Well, the troops don't want to be on TV because they're doing something illegal, but they
[1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:32.420]  didn't say that.
[1:34:32.420 --> 1:34:33.420]  I'm going to try to rush through your calls.
[1:34:33.420 --> 1:34:37.780]  I'm going to get everybody before our next guest comes up.
[1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:43.180]  Before I do that, ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to let you know again.
[1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:47.700]  You can now pre-order the DVD, The Obama Deception.
[1:34:47.700 --> 1:34:50.020]  The film will be done in a few weeks.
[1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:51.300]  It's really turning out good.
[1:34:51.300 --> 1:34:55.460]  I didn't know if I could make it as good as Endgame or others in a rush, but we're doing
[1:34:55.460 --> 1:34:57.860]  it.
[1:34:57.860 --> 1:35:00.860]  Makes me look like a raccoon with black circles around my eyes.
[1:35:00.860 --> 1:35:05.620]  I don't know why it is, but when I start working 18 hours a day, I just get black circles.
[1:35:05.620 --> 1:35:13.420]  The point is, we are here busting our hind end to get this film out and to make it as
[1:35:13.420 --> 1:35:18.420]  powerful as possible, and I'm not knocking those because there's definitely some substance
[1:35:18.420 --> 1:35:22.820]  to it, but the establishment loves it that it was all about, is he a communist or he
[1:35:22.820 --> 1:35:27.140]  had weathermen he was involved with or, you know, he's an anti-establishment commie.
[1:35:27.140 --> 1:35:28.140]  No, he's not.
[1:35:28.140 --> 1:35:36.860]  His father worked under Tim Geithner's father as a high-level operative for several big
[1:35:36.860 --> 1:35:43.580]  foundations, but with him for the, what was it, Carnegie, not literally the first big
[1:35:43.580 --> 1:35:48.980]  think tank that set it all up, the current system we live under, and the Annenberg and
[1:35:48.980 --> 1:35:49.980]  a bunch of others.
[1:35:49.980 --> 1:35:54.780]  So, you know, we don't go into is he really a U.S. citizen with proper credentials to
[1:35:54.780 --> 1:35:55.780]  be president?
[1:35:55.780 --> 1:35:58.120]  You know, was he born in Kenya?
[1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:00.540]  This is all new info.
[1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:05.940]  This is his lying systematically, like we'll show him saying, we're going to stop these
[1:36:05.940 --> 1:36:10.540]  CEOs getting hundreds of millions of dollar bonuses, and then we show the actual executive
[1:36:10.540 --> 1:36:15.460]  order where it says all previous bailouts, they get to keep it, and then all these big
[1:36:15.460 --> 1:36:22.740]  brokerage firms, they're all exempt, and that even the small firms they go after, it's up
[1:36:22.740 --> 1:36:27.820]  to the White House, and it's just pure bull, or saying he wasn't going to appoint lobbyists
[1:36:27.820 --> 1:36:31.820]  and that's all he does, or saying he was going to get us out of Iraq, we've got him
[1:36:31.820 --> 1:36:35.100]  going, we'll be out of Iraq in six months once I'm elected.
[1:36:35.100 --> 1:36:38.060]  Now, we've got him saying 23 months.
[1:36:38.060 --> 1:36:43.420]  I mean, it goes on and on and on, but not just the lies.
[1:36:43.420 --> 1:36:47.340]  What his real policies are, the globalists, the bankers, how they're engineering all this,
[1:36:47.340 --> 1:36:51.820]  it's really about the financial crisis.
[1:36:51.820 --> 1:36:55.020]  It really, the whole films about how he's a puppet, it really does Obama a favor and
[1:36:55.020 --> 1:36:59.300]  just shows you he's just an actor front man.
[1:36:59.300 --> 1:37:03.820]  Those are the psychology of how they made his hate bush and taught us how evil he was
[1:37:03.820 --> 1:37:08.180]  and allowed that to be kosher and acceptable, and it was true, but then all of the hate
[1:37:08.180 --> 1:37:13.860]  was transmuted into love for Obama and hope, and now he's terrorizing the public, hope
[1:37:13.860 --> 1:37:17.220]  and change turned into gloom and doom, and if you don't do what I say, we're going to
[1:37:17.220 --> 1:37:23.820]  have a catastrophe, crisis to catastrophe, and the forced youth brigades, their own
[1:37:23.820 --> 1:37:27.660]  documents, their own quotes, all the latest info, how they're setting it up, the FEMA
[1:37:27.660 --> 1:37:32.380]  camps, the gun grabbing, it's all in the film.
[1:37:32.380 --> 1:37:37.420]  Our problem is the film is about three, four hours long.
[1:37:37.420 --> 1:37:38.420]  I got to cut this sucker down.
[1:37:38.420 --> 1:37:42.180]  I want it to be 90 minutes, you know, I'm known for two, three, four hour films.
[1:37:42.180 --> 1:37:48.820]  I want it to be 90 minutes, and so we're fact checking, triple, double checking, everything.
[1:37:48.820 --> 1:37:52.780]  We're just making this sucker lean and mean, so be the first to get it.
[1:37:52.780 --> 1:38:00.580]  The first orders that come in, the first order, the 50th order, the 19th hundred order, whatever,
[1:38:00.580 --> 1:38:03.980]  they just go in a stack, and the first person to order, they're the first person to have
[1:38:03.980 --> 1:38:08.660]  it mailed out, and it just boom, boom, boom, but now we've got three people in shipping,
[1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:11.580]  so even though we'll probably have thousands and thousands of orders by the first day it
[1:38:11.580 --> 1:38:17.500]  officially is released, we'll be able to blast those out in a matter of days, because it's
[1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:21.540]  being sent off to be mass produced to different places to make sure we get it quickly, and
[1:38:21.540 --> 1:38:26.780]  for backup in early March, we'll probably have it four or five days before it's actually
[1:38:26.780 --> 1:38:30.780]  released, and so we'll probably have them all packaged up and ready to go, and then
[1:38:30.780 --> 1:38:36.220]  on that day it'll go out, but regardless, ladies and gentlemen, the Obama deception.
[1:38:36.220 --> 1:38:43.860]  Get on infowars.com, link over there, and pre-order today, and yes, it'll be up on March
[1:38:43.860 --> 1:38:46.980]  15th at prisonplanet.tv in super high quality.
[1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:50.580]  You can burn it to this, burn it to DVD, I want you to get it out to everybody, I want
[1:38:50.580 --> 1:38:54.180]  you to go hog-wild, but if you're really serious about making copies, watch it first
[1:38:54.180 --> 1:38:58.380]  online, but buy the DVD, because that's the highest quality to copy, and I mean, buy,
[1:38:58.380 --> 1:39:02.820]  go out buy DVD burners now, prepare, have masses of them sitting on your dining room
[1:39:02.820 --> 1:39:08.080]  table or in your office, and I mean, just go to work, because they're betting everything
[1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:11.580]  on this guy, they are hoping he can carry through their new world, they're hoping his
[1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:18.740]  messianic image is George Washington, and Delana Roosevelt, and Lincoln, all rolled
[1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:24.380]  in one, and his shining, smiling face, they're hoping that that is going to sell their whole
[1:39:24.380 --> 1:39:28.620]  agenda, and there's no doubt they're making their move now, so we've got to expose the
[1:39:28.620 --> 1:39:35.820]  puppet and then put the blame where it really belongs in the international bank, so.
[1:39:35.820 --> 1:39:43.700]  Get the Obama deception today at infowars.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139, and
[1:39:43.700 --> 1:39:48.820]  double check, I'm sure Tim called our phone answering service, the operators that take
[1:39:48.820 --> 1:39:52.820]  the orders, but make double sure right now, tell Tim to make sure that they know the Obama
[1:39:52.820 --> 1:39:58.140]  deception is now on sale, because they're going to get a bunch of calls, 888-253-3139,
[1:39:58.140 --> 1:40:06.140]  you can also write to me at 3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:08.820]  By the way, that's just our mailing address for those people who show up there that I'm
[1:40:08.820 --> 1:40:19.620]  not there, so, just so you know, 3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:21.100]  Please get the Obama deception today.
[1:40:21.100 --> 1:40:24.740]  We also have the money masters to understand the bankers in game.
[1:40:24.740 --> 1:40:29.180]  We're now carrying the eye of the Phoenix, part three of America's secret beginnings.
[1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:34.940]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[1:40:34.940 --> 1:40:42.340]  Did I go to Barton, Kentucky, first, and I didn't go to Ian?
[1:40:42.340 --> 1:40:45.780]  Because I was calling Bart Ian, and then, okay, I'm out of control.
[1:40:45.780 --> 1:40:46.860]  Ian, you're on the air.
[1:40:46.860 --> 1:40:47.860]  Go ahead.
[1:40:47.860 --> 1:40:48.860]  Alex?
[1:40:48.860 --> 1:40:49.860]  Yes, sir.
[1:40:49.860 --> 1:40:50.860]  Yes.
[1:40:50.860 --> 1:40:59.700]  I would like to talk to you about a real quick issue that I'm actually seeing, and that
[1:40:59.700 --> 1:41:05.620]  is the fact that people do not understand the legal reality that we are in, and that
[1:41:05.620 --> 1:41:09.940]  is what is hurting the patriots of this country.
[1:41:09.940 --> 1:41:14.900]  Everyone talks about how the Constitution applies to them, which it does.
[1:41:14.900 --> 1:41:21.340]  However, the agreements that they have gotten into with the corporation of the United States
[1:41:21.340 --> 1:41:24.700]  is where they have made themselves under their jurisdiction.
[1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:31.380]  Well, a microcosm of that is all this, quote, free federal money that's our money to begin
[1:41:31.380 --> 1:41:34.980]  with comes back to the police, the cities, the counties, and they say, yeah, we'll give
[1:41:34.980 --> 1:41:39.700]  you this, you know, your town, this $50 million or whatever, but Austin has to sign on to
[1:41:39.700 --> 1:41:45.900]  these international agreements and agree to do A, B, and C. Or here's education money,
[1:41:45.900 --> 1:41:49.980]  but when you take education money, you're now under UNESCO UN regulation.
[1:41:49.980 --> 1:41:50.980]  Right.
[1:41:50.980 --> 1:41:55.540]  And that's because of the relationship that people have created.
[1:41:55.540 --> 1:41:56.780]  That is the real problem.
[1:41:56.780 --> 1:41:59.780]  Yeah, they take our right and turn it against this contract fraud.
[1:41:59.780 --> 1:42:01.820]  Well, it's not really fraud.
[1:42:01.820 --> 1:42:08.020]  The problem is people, well, it's not because people apply for things, and you have to understand
[1:42:08.020 --> 1:42:13.540]  that an application means you are begging for something, and if you beg for it, you
[1:42:13.540 --> 1:42:18.660]  are implied to know the full disclosure of what you're going for.
[1:42:18.660 --> 1:42:20.660]  Yeah, you're a debtor.
[1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:25.180]  You're a slave, you're saying that you're a war to the state.
[1:42:25.180 --> 1:42:26.180]  Correct.
[1:42:26.180 --> 1:42:28.140]  Let me expand on this, though.
[1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:33.700]  Most of what the government does, it's not a government, it's a crime syndicate, a parasite
[1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:41.300]  landing craft, a proboscis from a giant 50 trillion ton mosquito sucking us dry.
[1:42:41.300 --> 1:42:46.420]  When they take your blood, when you go into the hospital at birth, when your baby, when
[1:42:46.420 --> 1:42:50.020]  the mother has the baby and they take the blood illegally and put an international database,
[1:42:50.020 --> 1:42:52.220]  that's illegal, that's fraud, that's criminal.
[1:42:52.220 --> 1:42:57.100]  Just because they have you sign some contract agreeing to them to do test, still for a contract
[1:42:57.100 --> 1:43:01.500]  to really stand up, it has to have compensation, it has to be fair.
[1:43:01.500 --> 1:43:08.300]  The sharecroppers believe that they really are beholden to all of this, but it's a fraud
[1:43:08.300 --> 1:43:15.660]  to begin with, and you always have a right to just say, I'm disregarding this contract.
[1:43:15.660 --> 1:43:17.340]  They're now telling us driving is a privilege.
[1:43:17.340 --> 1:43:19.380]  They're now telling us owning a gun is a privilege.
[1:43:19.380 --> 1:43:20.900]  And it's not a privilege.
[1:43:20.900 --> 1:43:26.020]  And I have the Supreme Court rulings, but just because they tell cops the Federal Reserve
[1:43:26.020 --> 1:43:29.620]  is government, just because they tell them driving is a privilege, it's not true.
[1:43:29.620 --> 1:43:32.180]  And I can give them a whole federal case record in the history of it.
[1:43:32.180 --> 1:43:34.780]  Hey, police, do you know how it started?
[1:43:34.780 --> 1:43:36.500]  Do you know how drivers license started?
[1:43:36.500 --> 1:43:39.780]  Well, if you don't, then don't sit there and tell me it's a privilege.
[1:43:39.780 --> 1:43:40.780]  Go ahead.
[1:43:40.780 --> 1:43:42.540]  Driving is a commercial function.
[1:43:42.540 --> 1:43:44.940]  Do or not drive.
[1:43:44.940 --> 1:43:47.700]  Yes.
[1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:54.100]  The problem is people don't understand this, but the problem is they apply for these contracts.
[1:43:54.100 --> 1:43:59.580]  And like I said, even though you might not have full disclosure, the problem is because
[1:43:59.580 --> 1:44:05.260]  you are applying, you are showing that you do have full disclosure.
[1:44:05.260 --> 1:44:07.420]  You're getting into this applying thing.
[1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:11.580]  It's actually when you get it and sign the contract that the force of law comes in.
[1:44:11.580 --> 1:44:12.580]  But listen, good point.
[1:44:12.580 --> 1:44:13.580]  I appreciate your call.
[1:44:13.580 --> 1:44:14.580]  Look.
[1:44:14.580 --> 1:44:18.060]  You've got to study history to understand this.
[1:44:18.060 --> 1:44:20.460]  They've gone way past contract fraud.
[1:44:20.460 --> 1:44:24.700]  They only did contract fraud with the public and the states and the counties and cities
[1:44:24.700 --> 1:44:30.540]  to set the precedent of practice and possession being nine-tenths of the law.
[1:44:30.540 --> 1:44:33.380]  Custom is law under common law.
[1:44:33.380 --> 1:44:37.660]  And so they have created the custom and the perception, and now they don't even follow
[1:44:37.660 --> 1:44:40.020]  their own regulations, their own systems.
[1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:43.100]  It's gone to a whole other level of lawlessness.
[1:44:43.100 --> 1:44:49.220]  Now, this is an example of how they sold his driver's license, okay?
[1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:53.460]  Cars started becoming very popular in the 20s and 30s, and the public was paying with
[1:44:53.460 --> 1:44:58.540]  taxes for roads, and they advertised and said, how dare these truckers who are making all
[1:44:58.540 --> 1:45:04.300]  this money shipping goods, their trucks are heavier and they're ruining the roads.
[1:45:04.300 --> 1:45:09.540]  We should make them have a commercial driver's license and pay a tax for the roads they're
[1:45:09.540 --> 1:45:10.540]  damaging.
[1:45:10.540 --> 1:45:15.100]  Not, hey, having these trucks on the roads, creates commerce, gives people jobs, helps
[1:45:15.100 --> 1:45:19.060]  our community, okay?
[1:45:19.060 --> 1:45:24.940]  And then they started commercial driver's license and a commercial truck tax.
[1:45:24.940 --> 1:45:29.420]  Then by the 50s, they just said, oh, it's a dollar, it doesn't have your picture on
[1:45:29.420 --> 1:45:33.580]  it, just to show you're a safe driver.
[1:45:33.580 --> 1:45:37.140]  And then they start the light and all sounds reasonable, and they tell you, oh, by the
[1:45:37.140 --> 1:45:43.740]  way, driving's a privilege, because you sign an agreement through commerce.
[1:45:43.740 --> 1:45:45.940]  And it's the same thing with the Second Amendment.
[1:45:45.940 --> 1:45:52.140]  Notice they've got this concealed carry, which on one side, the police under their discretion
[1:45:52.140 --> 1:45:55.260]  all of the country would arrest you, even if having a handgun loaded really wasn't against
[1:45:55.260 --> 1:45:59.700]  the law, they would twist it and still false prosecute and get false convictions.
[1:45:59.700 --> 1:46:02.620]  People go to jail all the time for unviolent law, it's just made up.
[1:46:02.620 --> 1:46:06.300]  Case point example, this girl has a First Amendment right to put up a MySpace, just
[1:46:06.300 --> 1:46:09.820]  lightly making fun of the principal, the assistant principal, they arrest her and they'll give
[1:46:09.820 --> 1:46:11.980]  her months and months in a forest labor camp.
[1:46:11.980 --> 1:46:15.860]  That's an AP today.
[1:46:15.860 --> 1:46:19.380]  Now that's her First Amendment, that's outside the government training camp.
[1:46:19.380 --> 1:46:22.100]  They don't care, folks.
[1:46:22.100 --> 1:46:25.860]  They have people lined up by the thousands every school year in every major city crying
[1:46:25.860 --> 1:46:30.100]  saying they don't want shots with riot police and police dogs, because that's so important,
[1:46:30.100 --> 1:46:34.620]  the forced injection of something, it's enshrined in the state to bring in that precedent.
[1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:37.380]  And then I have the state attorney on, he goes, yeah, it's not the law, but we make
[1:46:37.380 --> 1:46:38.380]  them think that.
[1:46:38.380 --> 1:46:40.900]  And I don't vaccinate my kids, he starts laughing on air.
[1:46:40.900 --> 1:46:45.980]  See, it's funny getting it over on the suckers.
[1:46:45.980 --> 1:46:51.380]  It's a religion of sucking off of you and cheating you and scamming you and lying to
[1:46:51.380 --> 1:46:53.140]  you.
[1:46:53.140 --> 1:46:57.380]  And so now, because of concealed carry, the ideas introduced, even in Texas, people are
[1:46:57.380 --> 1:46:58.380]  going Alex.
[1:46:58.380 --> 1:47:01.300]  You mean, I don't have to have a license, don't have a handgun in Texas?
[1:47:01.300 --> 1:47:03.660]  No, you don't, Jack.
[1:47:03.660 --> 1:47:18.380]  You've got to have a license to do something illegal under common law, under common law.
[1:47:18.380 --> 1:47:23.620]  Because under common law, you cannot conceal a weapon.
[1:47:23.620 --> 1:47:28.420]  Weapons are to be worn in the open, but you try walking with a sidearm down the road in
[1:47:28.420 --> 1:47:32.500]  Texas or Arizona or even Vermont, where they claim it's pro-second amendment.
[1:47:32.500 --> 1:47:35.420]  The cops will be on you so fast, it'll make your head spin.
[1:47:35.420 --> 1:47:39.020]  I see cases in the news all the time where some guy goes out and puts his rifle or his
[1:47:39.020 --> 1:47:42.460]  handgun in his car to go to the shooting range and neighbors call police because they watch
[1:47:42.460 --> 1:47:50.620]  TV and TV and all the dramas and sitcoms and NYPD blue, they make everybody think that
[1:47:50.620 --> 1:47:55.580]  America has New York City's loss.
[1:47:55.580 --> 1:47:59.660]  And I've told the story one time, I was taking a dear rifle 15 years ago in the back of my
[1:47:59.660 --> 1:48:03.580]  Mustang, popped the hatchback, walked right out, put a rifle right in the back, threw
[1:48:03.580 --> 1:48:11.780]  a box of 243 shells in there, got in my car and left, and I came back to the house and
[1:48:11.780 --> 1:48:12.780]  to the apartment.
[1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:16.460]  My neighbor told me the police were there and the police, I mean, this is the country
[1:48:16.460 --> 1:48:23.780]  we live in, a cesspit of evil, of ignorant morons being brainwashed with lies.
[1:48:23.780 --> 1:48:27.060]  When they have the giant billboards up all over the country, for a decade straight I've
[1:48:27.060 --> 1:48:32.700]  seen them everywhere I go, shows a revolver and it says in big bold letters, report illegal
[1:48:32.700 --> 1:48:33.700]  guns.
[1:48:33.700 --> 1:48:39.180]  You've got mindless, dumb down, lazy jellyfish who don't even know what state they're in
[1:48:39.180 --> 1:48:43.420]  or what their rights are and they drive around seeing that and so they think handguns are
[1:48:43.420 --> 1:48:46.260]  illegal.
[1:48:46.260 --> 1:48:53.340]  And now the police are saying, owning a firearm is a privilege, no it's not, but if we let
[1:48:53.340 --> 1:48:59.380]  them sell that idea, it, they will pass laws saying it's a privilege and they'll do it
[1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:07.020]  and say it was never a right, shoot a boy.
[1:49:07.020 --> 1:49:18.140]  Makes me sick and these criminal degenerate parasite bankers, they want our guns so bad
[1:49:18.140 --> 1:49:21.500]  and that's the one thing that may keep them from completely imploding things into a road
[1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:25.580]  warrior situation is that I think they know they can't keep control of things and that
[1:49:25.580 --> 1:49:30.300]  they're going to end up losing in the end unless they can carry out false flag terror
[1:49:30.300 --> 1:49:34.420]  attacks to get everybody, things are tough and everybody's losing their jobs but they
[1:49:34.420 --> 1:49:38.900]  are the emergency aid centers that people are moving into and orders being maintained
[1:49:38.900 --> 1:49:44.500]  and nothing on the terrorist hit us and everybody got behind Obama and American flags are up
[1:49:44.500 --> 1:49:50.700]  everywhere and they did have to go ahead and ban most guns but you know I never thought
[1:49:50.700 --> 1:49:55.020]  I'd return a marathon in officer but I'm doing it for America and the officer will have
[1:49:55.020 --> 1:49:59.900]  American flags behind him, he'll go good job, I understand they'll all be, oh yeah, we
[1:49:59.900 --> 1:50:03.620]  had to do it for America, oh yeah boy.
[1:50:03.620 --> 1:50:06.700]  You know, I mean a few people are idiots.
[1:50:06.700 --> 1:50:14.740]  You love being conned, you love being played and it's also a bunch of degenerate chicken
[1:50:14.740 --> 1:50:20.700]  neck potbellied, pus filled, international bankers can sit there and you watch their
[1:50:20.700 --> 1:50:24.620]  body language, the republics, the democrats and the Obama and they're laughing and they're
[1:50:24.620 --> 1:50:28.620]  joking and they're just euphoric at these press conferences before they go up and act
[1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:32.660]  all concerned because they love it man, they're stealing everything, they're conquering the
[1:50:32.660 --> 1:50:36.780]  greatest nation on earth, they're taking over the world, they got the nuclear weapons and
[1:50:36.780 --> 1:50:41.300]  the space planes and everything and they're just on big fat power trips and so many of
[1:50:41.300 --> 1:50:46.780]  you are still under the illusion that governments legitimate and these people are good that they
[1:50:46.780 --> 1:50:50.980]  are just gonna have a heyday and they're building camps and they just, and they can't wait to
[1:50:50.980 --> 1:50:55.980]  do what they did in the Soviet Union here or in Nazi Germany but a lot of people are
[1:50:55.980 --> 1:51:01.740]  waking up so they're getting worried so they're accelerating their program.
[1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:06.260]  This year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and
[1:51:06.260 --> 1:51:11.420]  what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future. In these troubled times one of the
[1:51:11.420 --> 1:51:15.500]  most important things your family can have is good health. Some of the contributors to
[1:51:15.500 --> 1:51:20.740]  poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins and heavy metals. It's a documented fact.
[1:51:20.740 --> 1:51:26.740]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and
[1:51:26.740 --> 1:51:32.100]  parasitic infection. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol
[1:51:32.100 --> 1:51:38.220]  naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder also known as FPP with
[1:51:38.220 --> 1:51:44.420]  your favorite beverage once a day. FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com
[1:51:44.420 --> 1:51:51.340]  a two month supply starts at just $17 FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without
[1:51:51.340 --> 1:52:01.940]  it. Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll free at 888-949-3570. That's 888-949-3570.
[1:52:01.940 --> 1:52:07.580]  On September 11th, 2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops I went to ground Sierra
[1:52:07.580 --> 1:52:12.980]  and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11
[1:52:12.980 --> 1:52:18.060]  film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:52:18.060 --> 1:52:31.740]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:52:31.740 --> 1:52:36.100]  take action against their global masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was
[1:52:36.100 --> 1:52:41.100]  getting the countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one and it was boom,
[1:52:41.100 --> 1:52:47.540]  boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising
[1:52:47.540 --> 1:52:55.020]  at www.prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:52:55.020 --> 1:52:58.820]  If we don't expose the government sponsored terror they're going to commit more acts and
[1:52:58.820 --> 1:53:04.460]  bring in martial law. Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot
[1:53:04.460 --> 1:53:09.340]  live in a pH balanced alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly acidic
[1:53:09.340 --> 1:53:14.980]  due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance
[1:53:14.980 --> 1:53:19.300]  and perfect health as well as prevention of disease. People who alkalize the water they
[1:53:19.300 --> 1:53:24.420]  drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight. It was intended
[1:53:24.420 --> 1:53:28.820]  for human beings to drink alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people are
[1:53:28.820 --> 1:53:33.940]  overly acidic. The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment. Fat
[1:53:33.940 --> 1:53:38.100]  accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[1:53:38.100 --> 1:53:43.940]  it. Do your part, alkalize and supercharge your body now. Alchivision plasma pH drops
[1:53:43.940 --> 1:53:48.580]  contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[1:53:48.580 --> 1:53:54.060]  up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops. Order your bottle of Alchivision plasma pH drops
[1:53:54.060 --> 1:54:04.860]  now by going directly to alkavision.com. Again that's alchivision.com.
[1:54:04.860 --> 1:54:09.660]  There is no law in Texas in most states that still have the original second amendment that
[1:54:09.660 --> 1:54:14.660]  I can't walk down the Austin street with a shotgun or a handgun as long as it's not
[1:54:14.660 --> 1:54:20.780]  concealed. But you try it and now if you walk in rural areas with a shotgun the police pull
[1:54:20.780 --> 1:54:27.180]  up and harass you because they want to set the precedent that they are the only ones
[1:54:27.180 --> 1:54:31.300]  that have the right to defend themselves and to be armed. They are the only ones that have
[1:54:31.300 --> 1:54:37.660]  the power to be armed because that is mastery. That is kingship. That is sovereignty. Slaves
[1:54:37.660 --> 1:54:42.940]  are disarmed. And so this is how they operate. So they have the pro-gun groups say get a
[1:54:42.940 --> 1:54:48.780]  concealed carry but that turns a ride into a privilege. You don't have to get it but
[1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:56.940]  they have you do it to create the illusion. And now my fellow Texans, everybody I talk
[1:54:56.940 --> 1:55:03.420]  to you don't know. I mean they just don't know the gun laws. Oh, help us. Help us God.
[1:55:03.420 --> 1:55:07.220]  And they're brainwashing the children. Love a policeman with a machine gun. Hate your
[1:55:07.220 --> 1:55:13.260]  father with a rifle. I mean how ashenine is that? Alright, I'm going to go back to your
[1:55:13.260 --> 1:55:18.420]  calls. Daryl in Texas, you're on the air. Hey Alex, how's it going? Oh, just it's,
[1:55:18.420 --> 1:55:24.980]  I always say oh it's going good but I mean it's insane. I had to laugh when you akin
[1:55:24.980 --> 1:55:31.060]  like liken the government to the large proposes of mosquitoes sucking the blood. I work in
[1:55:31.060 --> 1:55:36.220]  a hospital and it sort of made me think of one of the ways they control hospitals is
[1:55:36.220 --> 1:55:40.740]  they control the Medicaid and the Medicare money. And so if they want you to do something
[1:55:40.740 --> 1:55:45.820]  in your hospital, if they want you to follow a certain standard or practice, then they
[1:55:45.820 --> 1:55:51.100]  just have to make it so that if you want the Medicaid money or you want the Medicare money.
[1:55:51.100 --> 1:55:54.980]  And it's outside the law. They just started saying 36 years ago, you will take this blood
[1:55:54.980 --> 1:55:58.460]  and send it to the health department. But it's not a blood test. It's being put in a
[1:55:58.460 --> 1:56:02.220]  database and it's now admitted. Exactly. There's no laws. They just do whatever they
[1:56:02.220 --> 1:56:08.220]  want. I think having the state reps on today with a brilliant idea. So, you know, I just
[1:56:08.220 --> 1:56:13.940]  wanted to also say to the audience out there that some things that, you know, people always
[1:56:13.940 --> 1:56:18.620]  ask about what they can do to get involved in. One thing you can do, well, I always tell
[1:56:18.620 --> 1:56:23.260]  people you have to develop a long term memory. That's one thing. You write things down, open
[1:56:23.260 --> 1:56:28.220]  a word processing program or something, you know, at least like take note of who voted
[1:56:28.220 --> 1:56:32.660]  for the bailout in your state. Like, I know Kay Bailey voted for it. John Cornyn voted
[1:56:32.660 --> 1:56:39.020]  for it. It'll make you start to learn the names. And, and you know, also I'll tell
[1:56:39.020 --> 1:56:43.180]  people- We know Kay Bailey's Bilderberg. She is complete trash and so is Rick Perry.
[1:56:43.180 --> 1:56:49.660]  Oh yeah. I didn't know that about Kay Bailey. But if, you know, I always tell people, read
[1:56:49.660 --> 1:56:55.420]  a law. There's only usually a couple of three big laws a year. You know, read a law because
[1:56:55.420 --> 1:57:00.180]  you're never going to be able to understand a law by listening to the talking head show.
[1:57:00.180 --> 1:57:04.100]  You can't understand what something does or doesn't do until you look at it.
[1:57:04.100 --> 1:57:09.540]  Well, I mean, just on its own, the fact that the stimulus bill has health rationing to the
[1:57:09.540 --> 1:57:16.740]  old and it says the old will, will get second level care and, and, and, and will have procedures
[1:57:16.740 --> 1:57:22.180]  to extend life denied. I mean, it's off the charts and it's in a few news articles and
[1:57:22.180 --> 1:57:27.820]  that's it. And that's just one thing in there. I mean, it's, and they're, and I watch Obama
[1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:31.660]  walk over to old ladies, particularly, I'm going to help you honey. And then you, and
[1:57:31.660 --> 1:57:35.020]  you can hear him say, I'm going to take all your health care away because I'm the government.
[1:57:35.020 --> 1:57:36.660]  And they call it giving them something.
[1:57:36.660 --> 1:57:42.500]  And the mainstream media doesn't even report to you the names of bills like HR this or
[1:57:42.500 --> 1:57:46.660]  F that whenever they report them. They don't, there's no, they don't tell the public that
[1:57:46.660 --> 1:57:54.660]  hospitals by law have to give 25% and by ancient conviction convention, they have to give a
[1:57:54.660 --> 1:58:00.220]  lot between 20 and 30% depending on which hospital or in free health care. Doctors were
[1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:04.940]  always supposed to render free care and they did Ron Paul does my dad's done it. He does
[1:58:04.940 --> 1:58:09.340]  it con, you know, the point is that's being phased out and, and I had an employee totally
[1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:14.300]  sick with Crohn's disease. He was almost dying, couldn't eat for weeks. He didn't have enough
[1:58:14.300 --> 1:58:18.740]  money, didn't have a good insurance because he had a preexisting condition. I had to explain
[1:58:18.740 --> 1:58:24.460]  to him, he didn't believe me, walk him through how to get a $40,000 surgery. And now he's
[1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:28.940]  fine three years later and didn't die. And he had to go to New York, get it all taken
[1:58:28.940 --> 1:58:34.220]  care of through the charity system, got one of the top surgeons in the country to do it.
[1:58:34.220 --> 1:58:38.460]  And they admitted, yes, we see, but the illegal aliens right now, they get all of that. We'll
[1:58:38.460 --> 1:58:39.460]  be right back.
[1:58:39.460 --> 1:58:56.100]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[1:58:56.100 --> 1:59:00.100]  and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food and water
[1:59:00.100 --> 1:59:04.060]  is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line or you have your own bread. You'll
[1:59:04.060 --> 1:59:08.820]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency

[2:00:39.420 --> 2:00:45.860]  Sheriff Richard on yesterday. I forgot his last name. Richard Mack. Mack, thank you.
[2:00:45.860 --> 2:00:51.460]  I also have information on Lincoln. I did not know all that. I think you're doing a marvelous
[2:00:51.460 --> 2:00:58.380]  work to enlighten the public. You know, unfortunately, your stuff is not as available and I was
[2:00:58.380 --> 2:01:03.380]  so happy when you mentioned Rick Perry because I did get the brochure to read up on that
[2:01:03.380 --> 2:01:08.940]  Texas Corridor and it was appalling because it was going to be built by a Spanish company
[2:01:08.940 --> 2:01:12.820]  and they were going to lease the property. Ma'am, it's still being built. They just
[2:01:12.820 --> 2:01:19.140]  broke the 8,000 miles of projects into sub-projects and in their own documents, they're continuing
[2:01:19.140 --> 2:01:23.540]  the whole thing. That's how criminal they are. That is, I just think I can't believe
[2:01:23.540 --> 2:01:27.780]  anybody voted for Rick Perry. Well, listen, the state legislature said kill the project
[2:01:27.780 --> 2:01:32.900]  two years ago and it's still going. The government is rogue. It isn't real. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:01:32.900 --> 2:01:37.140]  Yes, you're absolutely right. I also want to say that everybody that supports that is
[2:01:37.140 --> 2:01:42.660]  getting paola under the table. People do not like Bush senior talking about the wind world
[2:01:42.660 --> 2:01:48.300]  order. Somebody is paying him. They're getting big bucks under the table. I think probably
[2:01:48.300 --> 2:01:52.900]  Rick Perry is too because in every case like that, I worked in the oil industry for 20
[2:01:52.900 --> 2:01:59.140]  years and I saw a lot of people taking kickbacks and paola. These contracts were going to certain
[2:01:59.140 --> 2:02:03.700]  companies because of the kickbacks and a few got fired here and there, a few executives,
[2:02:03.700 --> 2:02:09.460]  but overall I think it's still going on. Also, I wanted to mention the disconnect between
[2:02:09.460 --> 2:02:14.980]  Washington and the people and the lady from Missouri that you interviewed earlier. She
[2:02:14.980 --> 2:02:18.820]  was talking about how she sent an email. I did too at the first bailout that Bush was
[2:02:18.820 --> 2:02:23.820]  talking about. I sent an email to Kay Bailey Hutchinson and also to, I wrote a letter to
[2:02:23.820 --> 2:02:28.620]  a Marsman and it was like they didn't go in and she needs to know that they can, they
[2:02:28.620 --> 2:02:32.700]  have somebody sitting there responding and just putting your name in. Yeah, they can
[2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:36.540]  put paola in. It looks like that she read it. Nobody's reading it. I know. I have people
[2:02:36.540 --> 2:02:40.740]  email me all the time and go, how dare you not respond personally to my email. Look,
[2:02:40.740 --> 2:02:45.140]  I have one here from Jeb Bush responding folks. Those are automated. We, you know, we're
[2:02:45.140 --> 2:02:49.620]  a small organization. I do try to read it all. We believe me till my eyes are fallout.
[2:02:49.620 --> 2:02:53.220]  But yeah, I'm not, I'm not, I'm really not knocking the Congressman. I understand they
[2:02:53.220 --> 2:02:57.260]  probably get thousands of emails, but I'm just saying the lady, if she thinks somebody
[2:02:57.260 --> 2:03:01.200]  read it, she's wrong. Okay. Because they can easily just send that back and put your
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:05.940]  name in there. No, I understand. I understand paola. Good to hear from you. David, David
[2:03:05.940 --> 2:03:12.340]  in Virginia. Go ahead. Daniel, go ahead. Yeah. Hello. How you doing there, Alex? Pretty
[2:03:12.340 --> 2:03:18.900]  good, sir. Oh, good, good. Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad you got your radio show on the internet.
[2:03:18.900 --> 2:03:24.820]  I'm listening to you on the computer, but well done. I'm, I'm, I'm kind of, I'm kind
[2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:32.900]  of eerie about some things here. You know, you know, Steve is a gold. I have to mention
[2:03:32.900 --> 2:03:40.140]  this. He was a gold made a movie called on deadly ground. And in the movie, at the end
[2:03:40.140 --> 2:03:47.340]  of the movie, he did a, uh, what it's called a presentation about our environment and not
[2:03:47.340 --> 2:03:53.940]  just on wildlife alone, but people. And he was talking to, uh, I think was a council
[2:03:53.940 --> 2:04:00.980]  of Native American, uh, Alaskan, Eskimos. Yeah, they're pushing land grabbing. Right.
[2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:05.660]  And, uh, well, that's, you know, those films are funded by the oil companies because they
[2:04:05.660 --> 2:04:10.140]  don't want smaller companies to be able to go drill up there. So then they, uh, you know,
[2:04:10.140 --> 2:04:14.340]  use polar bears and the natives who actually want drilling. We've had people, you know,
[2:04:14.340 --> 2:04:19.180]  on from Alaska and in Canada. So the, so that the oil can't come out of the ground. And
[2:04:19.180 --> 2:04:23.580]  then, and yeah, in that movie, you're basically a Nazi. If you drill an oil well and he breaks
[2:04:23.580 --> 2:04:27.020]  all their arms and knocks their teeth out and he's real tough. That's stupid little
[2:04:27.020 --> 2:04:32.860]  ponytail. Yeah. And I was, uh, you know, at the end of it, he started mentioning about
[2:04:32.860 --> 2:04:37.060]  how, how the oil companies are polluting the water and so forth and how they're spilling
[2:04:37.060 --> 2:04:42.740]  the oil in the water and polluting the cars. Yeah, it's all funded by the oil companies.
[2:04:42.740 --> 2:04:45.780]  All funded by the oil guys. Yeah. They're now, they're now pushing the global tax on
[2:04:45.780 --> 2:04:53.580]  oil. This is going to be a tax on us. Absolutely. Anything else, sir? Yeah. And the other party
[2:04:53.580 --> 2:04:57.460]  is stay there. I'm going to come right back to you and then Mark Dice. Let's get Mark
[2:04:57.460 --> 2:05:03.060]  Dice on the horn. We go live at prison planet.TV in three minutes. Companies continue to lay

[2:07:02.140 --> 2:07:07.220]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral has been used for
[2:07:07.220 --> 2:07:11.940]  centuries by most cultures throughout the world. Utopia, Texas is home to a small but
[2:07:11.940 --> 2:07:16.740]  mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in
[2:07:16.740 --> 2:07:21.780]  distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions. Because our
[2:07:21.780 --> 2:07:27.420]  colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level,
[2:07:27.420 --> 2:07:32.340]  and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics. Utopia
[2:07:32.340 --> 2:07:37.020]  Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold, and copper.

[2:07:41.420 --> 2:07:45.980]  Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given

[2:08:21.860 --> 2:08:29.260]  We are live at prisonplanet.tv. You're about to go to Martin Dyson, your resistancemanifesto.com,
[2:08:29.260 --> 2:08:34.140]  but finishing up with Daniel in Virginia. You had one other point you wanted to make,
[2:08:34.140 --> 2:08:35.140]  Daniel. Go ahead.
[2:08:35.140 --> 2:08:43.900]  Yes, sir. I just wanted to say that this is not a two-party system. This is a two political
[2:08:43.900 --> 2:08:51.580]  wings of desolation system. And what I mean by that is I read the Bible a lot, and I read
[2:08:51.580 --> 2:08:57.740]  the book of Daniel. And the book of Daniel mentions about the desolation, the wings of
[2:08:57.740 --> 2:09:04.260]  desolation, and it's in chapter 9, Daniel. And it tells about the desolation. And we
[2:09:04.260 --> 2:09:12.940]  are living in the times that we are under a two-wing political desolation system. And
[2:09:12.940 --> 2:09:17.900]  all they are is two wings on the same bird, and the bird is what they're giving to the
[2:09:17.900 --> 2:09:23.580]  American people. I'm sick of it. Absolutely, and I appreciate your call. What they are
[2:09:23.580 --> 2:09:28.220]  is two different management teams bidding for control of the CEO job of this sector
[2:09:28.220 --> 2:09:33.700]  of the global imperium. And it's on record now. I mean, they admit it. They are criminal.
[2:09:33.700 --> 2:09:36.700]  That's why they've militarized the police, trained them to attack the people, trained
[2:09:36.700 --> 2:09:41.180]  them to violate the law, because they're making their move and they politically can't have
[2:09:41.180 --> 2:09:45.140]  us take the system back over and bring them to justice. Are you hearing about any CEOs
[2:09:45.140 --> 2:09:48.500]  to go to prison or any CEOs to get in trouble? You know, they've stole their trillions of
[2:09:48.500 --> 2:09:56.460]  dollars and they say, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but we have a solution that will
[2:09:56.460 --> 2:10:02.620]  save you, a new global bank, to control the entire planet. Everything's going to be alright.
[2:10:02.620 --> 2:10:06.860]  The very banking group that engineered it is now openly announcing world government.
[2:10:06.860 --> 2:10:09.700]  And that's my first question for Mark Dyes. We're going to play some clips of him calling
[2:10:09.700 --> 2:10:15.460]  into radio shows. He does this and really has a big effect with Sean Hannity and Bill
[2:10:15.460 --> 2:10:19.940]  O'Reilly and many others. He's also an author of The Resistance Manifesto. That's a lot
[2:10:19.940 --> 2:10:26.420]  of great work. And he's also featured in our film, Truth Rising, the 9-11 Chronicles Truth
[2:10:26.420 --> 2:10:32.820]  Rising. He is Mark Dyes. Mark, good to have you here with us today.
[2:10:32.820 --> 2:10:38.420]  Thank you. And I share probably everybody's sentiment about the fears and the anxieties
[2:10:38.420 --> 2:10:42.980]  of the rapid erosion of our country. But I think that, you know, I always try to look
[2:10:42.980 --> 2:10:47.980]  at the positive aspect and I think that this current situation does present itself a good
[2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:53.180]  opportunity for us to educate people about what's going on. People are so selfish when
[2:10:53.180 --> 2:10:57.060]  we try to tell them about 9-11. They don't feel like they're directly connected. It's
[2:10:57.060 --> 2:11:01.180]  not them or their family members that are going over there and dying and fighting this
[2:11:01.180 --> 2:11:07.380]  bogus war. But now everybody's pocketbook is being heard. Everyone's 401k. 401k is being
[2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:11.940]  eroded. Their jobs are disappearing. So now people are really looking for answers. And
[2:11:11.940 --> 2:11:16.300]  I think that this is a great opportunity for us now to really educate people as to what's
[2:11:16.300 --> 2:11:17.300]  going on.
[2:11:17.300 --> 2:11:22.100]  Yeah. You got death threats and the son of Ronald Reagan said you should be killed.
[2:11:22.100 --> 2:11:26.340]  He would pay for your murder. He contracted for murder on the air. He never got in trouble
[2:11:26.340 --> 2:11:33.100]  for that. You know, he called you up one to be buddy buddy after he'd done it. That of
[2:11:33.100 --> 2:11:37.100]  course, Michael Reagan, the fake conservative Judas Goat, helping lead us into the new
[2:11:37.100 --> 2:11:43.180]  world order along with his liberal counterparts on the other side of this wing of the other
[2:11:43.180 --> 2:11:49.660]  wing on this bird of prey. And of course, you had the idea for everybody to mail, loose
[2:11:49.660 --> 2:11:55.420]  change, final cut, in game terror storm. Some of the best films out there to the troops.
[2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:59.380]  I know that was done in mass. I've gotten reports back that's having a huge effect with
[2:11:59.380 --> 2:12:04.380]  the troops, understanding how the terror attacks were staged and how special units of the U.S.,
[2:12:04.380 --> 2:12:08.900]  British and Israeli forces have been caught mainstream news staging terror attacks dressed
[2:12:08.900 --> 2:12:14.460]  up like Arabs. And so that's having a big effect. I know that some of our information
[2:12:14.460 --> 2:12:20.500]  got to Pat Tillman. I know that he was going to go public about 9-11. He was going to go
[2:12:20.500 --> 2:12:27.980]  public about all sorts of issues, opium being grown over there. So they had to murder him.
[2:12:27.980 --> 2:12:31.060]  So again, another great idea you had, Mark.
[2:12:31.060 --> 2:12:35.540]  Well, thanks. And that's one of the reasons why I continuously keep calling into these
[2:12:35.540 --> 2:12:40.660]  radio talk shows. It's partially to show, years ago, it was to show that they are gatekeepers,
[2:12:40.660 --> 2:12:45.700]  that they're mocking birds, that they won't talk about any real serious issues. But it's
[2:12:45.700 --> 2:12:50.100]  also a way to get the listeners to hear these particular issues and then go and Google them,
[2:12:50.100 --> 2:12:53.860]  because these people have millions of listeners. And if they just hear the word Builderburg
[2:12:53.860 --> 2:12:59.180]  Group, if a question's brought about the Builderburg Group and they hear their hero and their
[2:12:59.180 --> 2:13:04.220]  idol, Sean Hannity or Michael Savage, not want to talk about it or deny that they know anything
[2:13:04.220 --> 2:13:07.100]  about it, curiosity is going to get them. They're going to go and Google it. They're
[2:13:07.100 --> 2:13:11.100]  going to check it out on YouTube, on Google Video. And so that's a way that we can help
[2:13:11.100 --> 2:13:13.700]  to educate these people also. And that's why they're...
[2:13:13.700 --> 2:13:17.980]  And they've gotten to where they know your voice. We need more people to do this, don't
[2:13:17.980 --> 2:13:18.980]  we?
[2:13:18.980 --> 2:13:22.740]  It's very difficult for me to do it now. The screeners know my voice. And I think that
[2:13:22.740 --> 2:13:25.700]  pretty soon they're going to go to a caller ID based system. So they're going to know
[2:13:25.700 --> 2:13:31.740]  who it is that's even calling into the switchboard. So it takes a lot of patience, but I have
[2:13:31.740 --> 2:13:35.500]  instructions on how to call into the shows on my website. Maybe we can talk about that
[2:13:35.500 --> 2:13:40.460]  later and get everybody to get onto the shows. And you can bypass the screener. You can
[2:13:40.460 --> 2:13:45.980]  sometimes get your call eliminated by the seven second delay. But if you phrase it right,
[2:13:45.980 --> 2:13:51.100]  if you just ask a question and seem like you're ignorant, you're really curious as opposed
[2:13:51.100 --> 2:13:54.860]  to just calling them up and slamming them, a lot of times you can get a certain issue
[2:13:54.860 --> 2:13:58.740]  brought out. Not particularly really websites. Anytime anybody mentions a dot com, they're
[2:13:58.740 --> 2:14:02.380]  going to cut the call. The seven second delay will prevent that from even getting on the
[2:14:02.380 --> 2:14:07.700]  air. But you can ask them questions. It's a very, very difficult thing to do, but it's
[2:14:07.700 --> 2:14:09.420]  very, very important that everybody does this.
[2:14:09.420 --> 2:14:12.860]  Well, I'll tell you one of the tricks I've used. I learned this. That's why I wouldn't
[2:14:12.860 --> 2:14:18.460]  have got an access TV show almost 14 years ago and got on radio 13 years ago. As I was
[2:14:18.460 --> 2:14:22.620]  concerned about things I saw, gun control and things in Texas and other issues, and
[2:14:22.620 --> 2:14:26.740]  I would call in, this is when I was in college to talk shows. I was right out of high school
[2:14:26.740 --> 2:14:31.580]  like 18, 19, and they wouldn't let me on, but then they let idiots on. I learned to
[2:14:31.580 --> 2:14:35.580]  play the left, right paradigm and call in and act stupid. Then they put me on air and
[2:14:35.580 --> 2:14:39.340]  I would then, you know, be normal. And, but yeah, you don't try to jump in and get it
[2:14:39.340 --> 2:14:43.540]  out real fast. You're like, Hey, yeah, no, on that topic, I wanted to get your take
[2:14:43.540 --> 2:14:48.980]  on this on the Bohemian Grove and a secret societies. You know, you've denied that exists,
[2:14:48.980 --> 2:14:52.900]  and it's in mainstream news that exists. You know, why are you, and then once you know
[2:14:52.900 --> 2:14:57.940]  that's gotten out, once you've gone past the 10 second delay or whatever, you go further
[2:14:57.940 --> 2:15:01.620]  and you start, you know, then firing out websites and things.
[2:15:01.620 --> 2:15:04.940]  You had a lot of callers think that it's probably like a show like yours where you
[2:15:04.940 --> 2:15:08.580]  just call up, you, you'd give your name in town, then you put it into the call log,
[2:15:08.580 --> 2:15:12.780]  but you have to feed your question to a screener that's going to screen out any issues that
[2:15:12.780 --> 2:15:15.820]  they don't want to talk about. So you have to come up with a couple of different issues
[2:15:15.820 --> 2:15:19.860]  of the day. Just have a comment about it. Uh, you know, he loves it. I got through the
[2:15:19.860 --> 2:15:23.780]  other day because Sean Hannity has a dating and online dating service for conservatives
[2:15:23.780 --> 2:15:28.140]  Hannah date.com. So, you know, I told the screener, I said, Hey, I met my fiance on
[2:15:28.140 --> 2:15:32.100]  Hannah date.com. I just wanted to thank Sean Hannity. So she's like, this is great. Puts
[2:15:32.100 --> 2:15:35.340]  me right through onto the air. As soon as I got on, I asked him about the Bilderberg
[2:15:35.340 --> 2:15:38.940]  group. And so you just have to come up with a, with an interesting comment or question
[2:15:38.940 --> 2:15:43.180]  about one of the particular main stories that are swirling around for the day or for
[2:15:43.180 --> 2:15:47.260]  the week. And then you can get on the call log and bypass them that way.
[2:15:47.260 --> 2:15:52.820]  Well done, Lord Vader. Well, in some of these calls, I mean, I'm post a lot of them dozens
[2:15:52.820 --> 2:15:56.700]  and dozens of them are on, on the internet, on my site on YouTube. I don't know if you
[2:15:56.700 --> 2:16:00.740]  have any of those calls linked up, but you know, people wonder why is it that these guys
[2:16:00.740 --> 2:16:04.860]  won't talk about these issues. And it all goes back to Operation Mockingbird, which
[2:16:04.860 --> 2:16:09.460]  was started back in the fifties. And this is again, this is not just me saying this
[2:16:09.460 --> 2:16:14.140]  or Alex saying this, there was a congressional hearing back in the 1970s and the mid seventies
[2:16:14.140 --> 2:16:21.460]  that uncovered that the CIA was paying reporters to plant stories and also gatekeep. And so
[2:16:21.460 --> 2:16:24.060]  you wonder why these issues don't make it out.
[2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:28.460]  I mean, now, now it's just admitted that they depending on a loan spending five billion
[2:16:28.460 --> 2:16:33.820]  on domestic propaganda and buying reporters and planning stories. That's why it's everywhere
[2:16:33.820 --> 2:16:38.260]  about you love America, then love the military and join now to find out how to
[2:16:38.260 --> 2:16:42.540]  do it. Here's a quote directly from the church committee investigations. This is the report
[2:16:42.540 --> 2:16:46.700]  published in 1976. So this isn't me saying this. This is an Alex Jones saying this. This
[2:16:46.700 --> 2:16:51.380]  is directly from a congressional hearing from the published report. And it says quote, the
[2:16:51.380 --> 2:16:55.580]  CIA currently maintains a network of several hundred individuals around the world who provide
[2:16:55.580 --> 2:17:00.860]  intelligence for the CIA and at times influence public opinion through the use of covert propaganda.
[2:17:00.860 --> 2:17:04.900]  These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers, periodical
[2:17:04.900 --> 2:17:09.180]  scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial
[2:17:09.180 --> 2:17:13.300]  book publishers and foreign media outlets. And back in the seventies, they were paying
[2:17:13.300 --> 2:17:15.300]  hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
[2:17:15.300 --> 2:17:19.900]  And now it's tens of thousands. That's why there's CIA recruiting ads everywhere. They're
[2:17:19.900 --> 2:17:22.460]  just taking everything over.
[2:17:22.460 --> 2:17:26.100]  And if you go back to the original writings of Adam Weiss up in the Illuminati, they knew
[2:17:26.100 --> 2:17:30.780]  back in the late 1700s, the power of the mainstream media. I mean, I have a degree of a bachelor's
[2:17:30.780 --> 2:17:35.100]  degree in communication. I studied mainstream media on a scholarly level. And if you look
[2:17:35.100 --> 2:17:39.620]  at Adam Weiss up's own words, the original writings of the Illuminati were published
[2:17:39.620 --> 2:17:46.300]  and discovered back in 1786. And Weiss up's own words, he says, by establishing reading
[2:17:46.300 --> 2:17:50.180]  societies and subscription libraries and taking these under our direction and supplying them
[2:17:50.180 --> 2:17:55.500]  with our labors, we may turn the public mind which way we will. And in a like manner, we
[2:17:55.500 --> 2:17:59.460]  will obtain influence in the military academies, printing houses, book shops, chapters and
[2:17:59.460 --> 2:18:03.980]  in short, all offices which have any effect in forming or managing are directing the mind
[2:18:03.980 --> 2:18:04.980]  of man.
[2:18:04.980 --> 2:18:08.940]  And so, I mean, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that's how you do it. And it
[2:18:08.940 --> 2:18:14.500]  all goes back to Operation Mockingbird. And you wonder why they won't talk about any of
[2:18:14.500 --> 2:18:20.460]  these issues because they have a list of topics that are not to be discussed. And you know,
[2:18:20.460 --> 2:18:24.060]  nobody's going to approach Sean Hannity or Rush Limbo and say, you're now going to be
[2:18:24.060 --> 2:18:27.380]  part of Operation Mockingbird. They're obviously going to have dinner with them and they're
[2:18:27.380 --> 2:18:31.340]  going to say, look, you know, you're in a really influential position. We need your
[2:18:31.340 --> 2:18:36.940]  help to ensure the security of the country and the party. And then they're provided
[2:18:36.940 --> 2:18:41.380]  with lists of what to say, what not to say. Scott McClellan, the former White House press
[2:18:41.380 --> 2:18:47.060]  secretary admitted on CNN that Fox News reporters and others received daily talking points.
[2:18:47.060 --> 2:18:52.220]  Oh, no, they had the top six talk shows to the White House and openly gave them talking
[2:18:52.220 --> 2:18:56.260]  points publicly. See, once they've been caught, they're now just trying to hide it in plain
[2:18:56.260 --> 2:19:01.660]  view. They're just like, oh, I'm like, it's no big deal. And it's no secret. I mean, anybody
[2:19:01.660 --> 2:19:05.580]  that has a job, you're going to get orders and memos that are going to, they're going
[2:19:05.580 --> 2:19:10.500]  to tell you public policy and policies for your store, for your, for your job, for your
[2:19:10.500 --> 2:19:14.500]  industry. You know, you're going to push a particular product. You're going to, you're
[2:19:14.500 --> 2:19:19.100]  going to downplay this particular thing. You're going to, well, I mean, 10 years ago, Mark,
[2:19:19.100 --> 2:19:22.820]  I'm going to hear Limbo say the CFR doesn't exist. How does he deal with it now being
[2:19:22.820 --> 2:19:27.940]  all over TV, admitting world government? They're saying world government's a good thing. And
[2:19:27.940 --> 2:19:32.900]  he still hangs up on you and calls you a kook and plays black helicopter noises. I mean,
[2:19:32.900 --> 2:19:33.900]  it's ridiculous.
[2:19:33.900 --> 2:19:38.220]  Yeah, but now they'll admit that it exists, but it doesn't really matter. And, you know,
[2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:42.380]  if you have the call queued up a Michael Savage last week when I asked him about the
[2:19:42.380 --> 2:19:46.020]  Bilderberg group, you can hear him say that the Bilderberg group doesn't matter. He knows
[2:19:46.020 --> 2:19:50.180]  all about it. The CFR, it just doesn't matter. We don't need to go there.
[2:19:50.180 --> 2:19:54.020]  Yeah, we need to play the left off against the right and the right off against the left
[2:19:54.020 --> 2:20:00.060]  all day. And with Professor Weiner, who wrote love stories to his special friends, we'll
[2:20:00.060 --> 2:20:02.060]  be right back.
[2:20:02.060 --> 2:20:06.220]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight? Only to find the one that

[2:21:01.380 --> 2:21:06.580]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:21:06.580 --> 2:21:12.300]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:21:12.300 --> 2:21:16.460]  bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama
[2:21:16.460 --> 2:21:21.100]  bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[2:21:21.100 --> 2:21:26.060]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that
[2:21:26.060 --> 2:21:32.340]  there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that
[2:21:32.340 --> 2:21:37.620]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers
[2:21:37.620 --> 2:21:42.380]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[2:21:42.380 --> 2:21:47.220]  in war games, the shadow government, and much much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD

[2:22:17.900 --> 2:22:22.460]  70% of China's one trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of
[2:22:22.460 --> 2:22:27.860]  oil per day from Iran in Euro. Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[2:22:27.860 --> 2:22:31.780]  Bad news for US currency. China, Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[2:22:31.780 --> 2:22:36.740]  Trading equals permanent loss. Dollars fall into 65% of Euro. Erosion accelerates.
[2:22:36.740 --> 2:22:41.100]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of US. Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[2:22:41.100 --> 2:22:43.660]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.

[2:24:15.900 --> 2:24:27.300]  You know, the Grange is right on the road from here. Oh, you go hunting down there? ZZ Top
[2:24:27.300 --> 2:24:35.820]  didn't go there to go hunting. The famous whorehouse there. All right, let's go ahead
[2:24:35.820 --> 2:24:39.540]  and go back to Mark Dice. Mark, we've got these clips. You want to go to the Michael
[2:24:39.540 --> 2:24:43.220]  Savage first? Yeah, this is about a week ago, two weeks
[2:24:43.220 --> 2:24:52.260]  ago. Michael Savage is probably one of the least controlled individuals of the mainstream
[2:24:52.260 --> 2:24:58.820]  media, but he again plays it off. And before we do that, here's a quote from an individual
[2:24:58.820 --> 2:25:04.020]  back in the 70s that was involved with Operation Mockingbird. Thomas Brayden, he was the head
[2:25:04.020 --> 2:25:09.620]  of the International Organizations Division, which is an element within the CIA that basically
[2:25:09.620 --> 2:25:14.500]  implemented this operation. And he openly admitted after the hearings, quote, if the
[2:25:14.500 --> 2:25:19.980]  CIA director wanted to extend a present, like he called it, suppose he thought this man
[2:25:19.980 --> 2:25:24.620]  could use $50,000. He's working well and doing a good job. He could hand it to him and never
[2:25:24.620 --> 2:25:29.220]  have to account to anybody. There was simply no limit to the money he could spend, no limit
[2:25:29.220 --> 2:25:34.420]  to the people that he could hire, no limit to the activities it could decide where he
[2:25:34.420 --> 2:25:39.940]  is. And today we have the Army going around for two decades, we know of buying off most
[2:25:39.940 --> 2:25:44.620]  of the mayors and police chiefs. Well, you wonder, you look at Rush Limbo's $400 million
[2:25:44.620 --> 2:25:50.500]  contract. More money than a show makes. Sean Hannity's tens of millions of dollars that
[2:25:50.500 --> 2:25:54.980]  he gets a year. I mean, these, these individuals are not working class like they try to play
[2:25:54.980 --> 2:25:59.620]  it off. Sean Hannity's big shtick is that he's against the mainstream media. He couldn't
[2:25:59.620 --> 2:26:05.740]  get more mainstream media himself. Let's go ahead and play this Michael Savage clip.
[2:26:05.740 --> 2:26:10.460]  Tell us what happened here. Well, luckily it's difficult again to get
[2:26:10.460 --> 2:26:16.900]  through to these people. So I fed the screener a typical left versus right question. And
[2:26:16.900 --> 2:26:21.180]  then when on the air, I just simply asked him, you know, he was, he was talking about
[2:26:21.180 --> 2:26:26.300]  how there's a conspiracy actually to destroy the economy, but it was only the Democrats
[2:26:26.300 --> 2:26:30.540]  were conspiring. So I just thought I would ask him if you want to go a little deeper
[2:26:30.540 --> 2:26:35.820]  and what he could tell everybody about the Bilderberg group's role in that conspiracy.
[2:26:35.820 --> 2:26:40.940]  Here it is. Right here on the Savage Nation, San Diego, Mark, go ahead please.
[2:26:40.940 --> 2:26:45.380]  Let's talk about the Bilderberg group. You're talking about conspiracies to bankrupt the
[2:26:45.380 --> 2:26:50.180]  economy. What can you tell the audience about the Bilderberg group and why isn't that mentioned
[2:26:50.180 --> 2:26:53.500]  ever in any means? Well, that's like talking about the council
[2:26:53.500 --> 2:26:56.660]  on foreign relations. It's too esoteric for the audience. I don't think we have to go
[2:26:56.660 --> 2:27:03.300]  any further than Obama, Geithner, Nancy Pelosi, and excuse me, Dianne Feinstein and Hillary
[2:27:03.300 --> 2:27:06.860]  Clinton. Is that enough for you? We don't need a Bilderberg group. We have the Democrat
[2:27:06.860 --> 2:27:11.620]  Socialist group that I just mentioned. Every year the Bilderberg group meets in secret
[2:27:11.620 --> 2:27:17.020]  in Obama. We know this. We understand it, but I don't want to talk about some ex esoteric
[2:27:17.020 --> 2:27:21.820]  group called the Bilderberg group. What we have is a Democrat Socialist group run by
[2:27:21.820 --> 2:27:28.060]  Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, Dianne Feinstein, and the others. What do we have
[2:27:28.060 --> 2:27:32.300]  to look at the Bilderberg group for? Because it's not only Democrat. It's Republican
[2:27:32.300 --> 2:27:36.420]  as well. They understand they operate both sides of the coin. Michael, when you're keeping
[2:27:36.420 --> 2:27:39.820]  your audience in the dark, I think you're doing everybody a tremendous disservice.
[2:27:39.820 --> 2:27:44.300]  Don't tell me what I'm doing. Get your own talk show if you want to do them a service.
[2:27:44.300 --> 2:27:47.140]  What good is going to come of talking about the Bilderberg group, which I've heard since
[2:27:47.140 --> 2:27:49.620]  1990? Tell me what good is going to come of it.
[2:27:49.620 --> 2:27:54.820]  Why don't we expose them? Maybe they're violating what needs to be exposed as Obama's hypocrisy
[2:27:54.820 --> 2:27:59.180]  so that the idiots finally get it and stop them before he does more damage. That's what
[2:27:59.180 --> 2:28:03.940]  needs to be done. Not talking about some esoteric conspiracy group. Thanks for the call. You're
[2:28:03.940 --> 2:28:04.940]  100% wrong.
[2:28:04.940 --> 2:28:09.900]  Yeah, let's not talk about who actually financed him or where Geithner's from or that he met
[2:28:09.900 --> 2:28:14.300]  secretly with Hillary there. They're the people that control the banks. It's all Obama and
[2:28:14.300 --> 2:28:17.500]  then they'll give us a new puppet and let's only talk about the new puppet. Let's only
[2:28:17.500 --> 2:28:22.500]  talk about Bush and we talk about Obama. They don't. Oh, no. And he insults his audience
[2:28:22.500 --> 2:28:27.060]  there, Mark Dice. He says, oh, they won't understand that it's too esoteric.
[2:28:27.060 --> 2:28:31.820]  Yeah, and we don't need to talk about the esoteric conspiracy group, the Skull and Bones
[2:28:31.820 --> 2:28:37.420]  Society, either even though President Bush made six appointments from his fellow Skull
[2:28:37.420 --> 2:28:42.540]  and Bones members. I mean, if you just look at Bush and who he appointed to key positions,
[2:28:42.540 --> 2:28:46.500]  the chairman of the Security and Exchange Commission was a Skull and Bonesman, William
[2:28:46.500 --> 2:28:52.260]  Donaldson. The general counsel in the Department of Homeland Security Bush had nominated Edward
[2:28:52.260 --> 2:28:57.900]  McNally. But the issue isn't even that. It was founded, according to even the Encyclopedia,
[2:28:57.900 --> 2:29:03.100]  from narcotics trafficking. And the entire CIA was founded out of it.
[2:29:03.100 --> 2:29:08.780]  Yeah. And when you have the heads of these major institutions, all Skull and Bones members,
[2:29:08.780 --> 2:29:14.420]  such a small private fraternity, obviously there's this private network going on. Victor
[2:29:14.420 --> 2:29:21.100]  Ash was nominated to the board of directors of Fannie Mae, the wonderful Federal National
[2:29:21.100 --> 2:29:28.220]  Mortgage Association. You got Evan Gabriel was nominated, Secretary of Defense in Europe.
[2:29:28.220 --> 2:29:34.060]  You have Robert McQuillan, Assistant Attorney General. So when you have these key positions
[2:29:34.060 --> 2:29:38.140]  filled by Skull and Bones members and members of this Illuminati, obviously they're going
[2:29:38.140 --> 2:29:39.140]  to do what they want to do.
[2:29:39.140 --> 2:29:43.060]  Stay there, Mark Dice. We're going to come back and get into more of these calls and
[2:29:43.060 --> 2:29:47.780]  analyze them with you and talk about your new edition of the Resistance Manifesto that
[2:29:47.780 --> 2:29:52.260]  by the way, we carry at infowars.com. You need to get it. It's powerful.
[2:29:52.260 --> 2:30:03.780]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:03.780 --> 2:30:09.700]  It's a new year full of uncertainties. People are being laid off in record numbers. The price
[2:30:09.700 --> 2:30:15.500]  of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter. You know that you need
[2:30:15.500 --> 2:30:19.980]  to prepare and maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now. That's

[2:31:01.460 --> 2:31:07.380]  May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11
[2:31:07.380 --> 2:31:11.140]  was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New
[2:31:11.140 --> 2:31:15.420]  World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? It wasn't engineered
[2:31:15.420 --> 2:31:19.220]  by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[2:31:19.220 --> 2:31:26.220]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:31:26.220 --> 2:31:27.940]  to grow at our own door.
[2:31:27.940 --> 2:31:32.940]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:31:32.940 --> 2:31:37.940]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:31:40.940 --> 2:31:43.940]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:31:43.940 --> 2:31:46.940]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:31:46.940 --> 2:31:50.940]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the tenth
[2:31:50.940 --> 2:31:52.940]  anniversary of life.

[2:33:22.940 --> 2:33:48.940]  Going back to Mark Dyson, I'm going to give him eight minutes over into the next hour.
[2:33:48.940 --> 2:33:52.940]  Give him a full hour. Then we got Russell Means joining us.
[2:33:52.940 --> 2:33:58.940]  I want to stay tuned for that as well.
[2:33:58.940 --> 2:34:03.940]  Before we go back to Mark Dyson, I want to tell you who's making this hour possible.
[2:34:03.940 --> 2:34:07.940]  It's our fine sponsors, but I believe in each and every one of these sponsors, high quality products,
[2:34:07.940 --> 2:34:09.940]  things you need to be prepared.
[2:34:09.940 --> 2:34:19.940]  Survivalseedbank.com.
[2:34:39.940 --> 2:34:44.940]  This is from scientists trying to get the seeds out of the globalist hands into the hands of the people.
[2:34:44.940 --> 2:34:49.940]  One seed bank at a time, one family at a time.
[2:34:49.940 --> 2:34:55.940]  And I just hope that you will visit their website, survivalseedbank.com, survivalseedbank.com,
[2:34:55.940 --> 2:35:05.940]  or give them a call 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, survivalseedbank.com.
[2:35:05.940 --> 2:35:15.940]  And along that same line of being prepared is another one of the great products from Solutions from Science.
[2:35:15.940 --> 2:35:18.940]  And that's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:35:18.940 --> 2:35:21.940]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice, and storms.
[2:35:21.940 --> 2:35:23.940]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid.
[2:35:23.940 --> 2:35:25.940]  And here's a great way to do just that.
[2:35:25.940 --> 2:35:29.940]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science,
[2:35:29.940 --> 2:35:33.940]  designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[2:35:33.940 --> 2:35:37.940]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of a power source, 1,800 power plant,
[2:35:37.940 --> 2:35:41.940]  and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[2:35:41.940 --> 2:35:45.940]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in blackouts, gas pumps can't pump gas
[2:35:45.940 --> 2:35:47.940]  because they're out on electricity.
[2:35:47.940 --> 2:35:50.940]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[2:35:50.940 --> 2:36:01.940]  Mysolarbackup.com, mysolarbackup.com, or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, a great little unit.
[2:36:01.940 --> 2:36:05.940]  Okay, going back to Mark Dice.
[2:36:05.940 --> 2:36:07.940]  Mark, continuing.
[2:36:07.940 --> 2:36:09.940]  I want to get into the bailout, the banker takeover.
[2:36:09.940 --> 2:36:11.940]  The awakening is happening, but let's play some more of these clips.
[2:36:11.940 --> 2:36:15.940]  You want to play Sean Hannity or Alan Combs next?
[2:36:15.940 --> 2:36:17.940]  Let's play the Sean Hannity clip.
[2:36:17.940 --> 2:36:21.940]  And notice how as soon as he denies any existence of the Bilderberg group,
[2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:24.940]  he doesn't ask me to clarify or anything like that.
[2:36:24.940 --> 2:36:27.940]  The call is dropped and he immediately goes to the next call.
[2:36:27.940 --> 2:36:31.940]  So he's still in the old limbo mode of just saying none of it exists.
[2:36:31.940 --> 2:36:34.940]  Oh, he's doing his very best to make sure that it's not going to get on the air.
[2:36:34.940 --> 2:36:39.940]  I actually a few days later got through again and asked him another question about the Bilderberg group,
[2:36:39.940 --> 2:36:43.940]  and then he mentioned, he laughed at me, and then he said,
[2:36:43.940 --> 2:36:45.940]  ah, we zapped you.
[2:36:45.940 --> 2:36:47.940]  That didn't even get on the air, buddy.
[2:36:47.940 --> 2:36:50.940]  And then the only thing you heard on the actual air was,
[2:36:50.940 --> 2:36:52.940]  you know, let's go to Mark and San Diego.
[2:36:52.940 --> 2:36:54.940]  Oh, let's go to, you know, Bill and such and such.
[2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:57.940]  And so I didn't even get on the air whatsoever, but you see,
[2:36:57.940 --> 2:36:59.940]  they revel in keeping people on the dark.
[2:36:59.940 --> 2:37:01.940]  They revel in using you.
[2:37:01.940 --> 2:37:03.940]  They revel in God bless you.
[2:37:03.940 --> 2:37:04.940]  God bless America.
[2:37:04.940 --> 2:37:07.940]  We're going to raise money for dead troops, children.
[2:37:07.940 --> 2:37:08.940]  Oh, Sean.
[2:37:08.940 --> 2:37:11.940]  Oh, Sean, you're so good, Sean.
[2:37:11.940 --> 2:37:14.940]  And I mean, they are just enemies of the Republic,
[2:37:14.940 --> 2:37:16.940]  just like all the liberals on the other side.
[2:37:16.940 --> 2:37:19.940]  So he is saying it doesn't exist.
[2:37:19.940 --> 2:37:20.940]  Here's that clip.
[2:37:20.940 --> 2:37:24.940]  Anyway, thanks for the call, Mark, KFNB, San Diego, next.
[2:37:24.940 --> 2:37:25.940]  Sean Hannity Show.
[2:37:25.940 --> 2:37:26.940]  How are you, Mark?
[2:37:26.940 --> 2:37:30.940]  Pretty good, but with all this economic crises going on
[2:37:30.940 --> 2:37:32.940]  and everybody looking for answers and blame,
[2:37:32.940 --> 2:37:35.940]  I was wondering if you could talk about the Bilderberg group
[2:37:35.940 --> 2:37:38.940]  and the role that they play in the global economy
[2:37:38.940 --> 2:37:40.940]  and geopolitics.
[2:37:40.940 --> 2:37:42.940]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[2:37:42.940 --> 2:37:45.940]  Let's go to Amy in Cincinnati, 55KRC.
[2:37:45.940 --> 2:37:46.940]  What's up, Amy?
[2:37:46.940 --> 2:37:48.940]  Hey, Sean, how are you?
[2:37:48.940 --> 2:37:49.940]  Good, how are you?
[2:37:49.940 --> 2:37:50.940]  Great.
[2:37:50.940 --> 2:37:52.940]  I just wanted to let you know you're a great American.
[2:37:52.940 --> 2:37:53.940]  Thank you.
[2:37:53.940 --> 2:37:55.940]  You're a great American.
[2:37:55.940 --> 2:37:56.940]  You're a great American.
[2:37:56.940 --> 2:37:58.940]  As the North American Union comes in,
[2:37:58.940 --> 2:38:00.940]  as the global government takes over,
[2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:02.940]  as the foreign banks openly rape us,
[2:38:02.940 --> 2:38:05.940]  you know, this is a challenge to Sean Hannity
[2:38:05.940 --> 2:38:06.940]  and the rest of them.
[2:38:06.940 --> 2:38:08.940]  Here's Time Magazine, an article titled
[2:38:08.940 --> 2:38:10.940]  The New World Order, Thursday, February 5th.
[2:38:10.940 --> 2:38:12.940]  There's hundreds of these.
[2:38:12.940 --> 2:38:17.940]  And it says here in paragraph one, two, three, four,
[2:38:17.940 --> 2:38:19.940]  five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[2:38:19.940 --> 2:38:22.940]  In paragraph nine, now, the whole thing says stuff as well,
[2:38:22.940 --> 2:38:24.940]  but it goes on to say,
[2:38:24.940 --> 2:38:26.940]  the only thing that can save America and the world,
[2:38:26.940 --> 2:38:28.940]  and the whole article blames the U.S. for what's happening
[2:38:28.940 --> 2:38:30.940]  on the bankers, it says,
[2:38:30.940 --> 2:38:32.940]  in the view of many outside the U.S. and some within,
[2:38:32.940 --> 2:38:34.940]  the only way to limit such excess is through a bigger,
[2:38:34.940 --> 2:38:37.940]  more powerful IMF that can act as a central bank to the world
[2:38:37.940 --> 2:38:39.940]  and knock heads when needed.
[2:38:39.940 --> 2:38:41.940]  When you read the real proposals, it's a government.
[2:38:41.940 --> 2:38:42.940]  You pay taxes too.
[2:38:42.940 --> 2:38:45.940]  While everybody agrees that the IMF needs to be less dominated
[2:38:45.940 --> 2:38:48.940]  by the U.S. and Western Europe,
[2:38:48.940 --> 2:38:52.940]  things get controversial as soon as you go past voting rights.
[2:38:52.940 --> 2:38:54.940]  Should capital flows be restricted?
[2:38:54.940 --> 2:38:56.940]  Should there be limits on the trade deficits and surpluses?
[2:38:56.940 --> 2:39:00.940]  Should the IMF be able to order around even the United States?
[2:39:00.940 --> 2:39:02.940]  And that's what they're setting up.
[2:39:02.940 --> 2:39:03.940]  That's Bretton Woods too.
[2:39:03.940 --> 2:39:04.940]  But, I mean, you know,
[2:39:04.940 --> 2:39:08.940]  Hannity says he has no idea about this, Mark Dice.
[2:39:08.940 --> 2:39:10.940]  Yeah, and even if that were true,
[2:39:10.940 --> 2:39:13.940]  then he would have to be one of the stupidest
[2:39:13.940 --> 2:39:16.940]  national supposed expert talk show hosts.
[2:39:16.940 --> 2:39:18.940]  I mean, here are these people, you know,
[2:39:18.940 --> 2:39:20.940]  their listeners obviously assume that they're these
[2:39:20.940 --> 2:39:23.940]  genius, hyper-enlightened individuals
[2:39:23.940 --> 2:39:25.940]  that know all the inner workings of the government
[2:39:25.940 --> 2:39:29.940]  and foreign relations and all the different nuances of politics.
[2:39:29.940 --> 2:39:31.940]  They think they're me.
[2:39:31.940 --> 2:39:33.940]  But, yeah, he doesn't understand.
[2:39:33.940 --> 2:39:35.940]  He doesn't know about this big, powerful group
[2:39:35.940 --> 2:39:38.940]  that is really at the key at the center
[2:39:38.940 --> 2:39:40.940]  making all of these decisions
[2:39:40.940 --> 2:39:41.940]  and directing anything.
[2:39:41.940 --> 2:39:44.940]  And like Savage said, well, we don't need to go past Obama.
[2:39:44.940 --> 2:39:46.940]  Well, we do need to go past Obama
[2:39:46.940 --> 2:39:49.940]  because he's the one that's taking orders from the Bilderberg group.
[2:39:49.940 --> 2:39:54.940]  Well, I mean, think about what Michael Wiener-Savage said.
[2:39:54.940 --> 2:39:56.940]  Michael Wiener-Savage says,
[2:39:56.940 --> 2:40:00.940]  yeah, it's real, but I don't care about a secret conspiracy group
[2:40:00.940 --> 2:40:02.940]  that runs the president.
[2:40:02.940 --> 2:40:04.940]  Well, the audience can't understand it.
[2:40:04.940 --> 2:40:07.940]  So is really what he admitted on his own words
[2:40:07.940 --> 2:40:09.940]  is the audience can't understand it.
[2:40:09.940 --> 2:40:11.940]  You know, I have another interesting story.
[2:40:11.940 --> 2:40:15.940]  I can't take the full credit for helping to wake Keith Overman up,
[2:40:15.940 --> 2:40:18.940]  but I was in contact with his producer several years ago
[2:40:18.940 --> 2:40:21.940]  trying to get him to cover the Bohemian Grove.
[2:40:21.940 --> 2:40:24.940]  And I knew that everybody knows Keith Overman's no fan of President Bush
[2:40:24.940 --> 2:40:26.940]  and I thought that they could do a nice story,
[2:40:26.940 --> 2:40:30.940]  even if it would be a slanted politically against the Republicans,
[2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:34.940]  at least we could get the issue of the Bohemian Grove on the show.
[2:40:34.940 --> 2:40:37.940]  And this was before July trying to get him to tie in
[2:40:37.940 --> 2:40:39.940]  when that meeting was going on in July.
[2:40:39.940 --> 2:40:42.940]  We could talk about the meeting, maybe show some video footage.
[2:40:42.940 --> 2:40:44.940]  And I was talking with the producer,
[2:40:44.940 --> 2:40:46.940]  and I had talked with him multiple times,
[2:40:46.940 --> 2:40:49.940]  and one of the second or the third time I'd spoken with him,
[2:40:49.940 --> 2:40:52.940]  I said, look, Greg, it was Greg Cockwell.
[2:40:52.940 --> 2:40:54.940]  I said, you know, this is no joke, this is no hoax.
[2:40:54.940 --> 2:40:56.940]  I mean, I'll put you into contact with Alex Jones
[2:40:56.940 --> 2:40:58.940]  with these individuals that have seen it with their own eyes
[2:40:58.940 --> 2:41:00.940]  that have the video footage.
[2:41:00.940 --> 2:41:03.940]  Here's a National Geographic article showing a ritual,
[2:41:03.940 --> 2:41:05.940]  and it says that it still exists,
[2:41:05.940 --> 2:41:08.940]  and he says, no, I know, I know you're telling the truth.
[2:41:08.940 --> 2:41:11.940]  He said that I opened up a whole new world for him,
[2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:14.940]  but he said he would never be able to take it to the air.
[2:41:14.940 --> 2:41:16.940]  Well, let me say this about Obermann.
[2:41:16.940 --> 2:41:20.940]  He's really showing his, his, his, his colors right now
[2:41:20.940 --> 2:41:23.940]  by coming out with this disinfo.
[2:41:23.940 --> 2:41:28.940]  A federal court says there's no link to autism from vaccines,
[2:41:28.940 --> 2:41:32.940]  and then he tries to claim one study, some Dr. Fudge something.
[2:41:32.940 --> 2:41:35.940]  I mean, we did, there were no autistic children 30, 40 years ago.
[2:41:35.940 --> 2:41:38.940]  When I was a kid, you never, now you go to the movies
[2:41:38.940 --> 2:41:40.940]  to take your children, the front two rows are autistic,
[2:41:40.940 --> 2:41:42.940]  and they say, oh, well, they're faking.
[2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:44.940]  Oh, I mean, I feel sorry for the children.
[2:41:44.940 --> 2:41:47.940]  I mean, they're like literally just, just in like, I mean,
[2:41:47.940 --> 2:41:50.940]  I mean, they're gone, man, and I've had top brain surgeons on.
[2:41:50.940 --> 2:41:53.940]  It attacks the brain, not just the mercury,
[2:41:53.940 --> 2:41:55.940]  but it causes an autoimmune response.
[2:41:55.940 --> 2:41:58.940]  They admit Gardasil's killing people right now,
[2:41:58.940 --> 2:42:01.940]  but they don't care, and Obermann makes me sick.
[2:42:01.940 --> 2:42:03.940]  And your take on that.
[2:42:03.940 --> 2:42:05.940]  I wish I, you know, we bullhorned him for like three hours.
[2:42:05.940 --> 2:42:06.940]  We were tired.
[2:42:06.940 --> 2:42:08.940]  We've been physically attacked in Denver.
[2:42:08.940 --> 2:42:10.940]  Obermann's producer came out and begged for us to stop.
[2:42:10.940 --> 2:42:13.940]  He said, okay, because Keith exposed Cheney wanting to blow up US ships
[2:42:13.940 --> 2:42:15.940]  and lemon on Iran using Navy SEALs.
[2:42:15.940 --> 2:42:16.940]  We're done.
[2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:17.940]  I asked the group, I said, are you done?
[2:42:17.940 --> 2:42:18.940]  Yeah, we're tired anyways.
[2:42:18.940 --> 2:42:20.940]  And then Obermann came up and said, thank you to us.
[2:42:20.940 --> 2:42:22.940]  And we got video on a photo of that.
[2:42:22.940 --> 2:42:25.940]  But the point is, is that now I just should have just kept giving it to him.
[2:42:25.940 --> 2:42:26.940]  Go ahead.
[2:42:26.940 --> 2:42:30.940]  Yeah, you know, he's in a position where he could go only go so far,
[2:42:30.940 --> 2:42:32.940]  even if he really understands the whole truth.
[2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:35.940]  He's not going to betray his audience or risk his job.
[2:42:35.940 --> 2:42:37.940]  And that's, you know, the same is true with Alan Combs.
[2:42:37.940 --> 2:42:42.940]  I mean, Alan Combs has to know, all of these people have to know.
[2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:46.940]  And maybe even if some of them wanted to speak out from their position,
[2:42:46.940 --> 2:42:48.940]  you know, against the Bush administration,
[2:42:48.940 --> 2:42:51.940]  all the Democrats are obviously anti-Bush.
[2:42:51.940 --> 2:42:53.940]  Even if they wanted to speak out about such things,
[2:42:53.940 --> 2:42:57.940]  the false flag attacks, Cheney wanting to do such things,
[2:42:57.940 --> 2:43:00.940]  and they would really risk their job.
[2:43:00.940 --> 2:43:03.940]  And so, yeah, Obermann is not going to be in that position.
[2:43:03.940 --> 2:43:06.940]  He's not going to want to lose his several million-dollar salary.
[2:43:06.940 --> 2:43:10.940]  And we do have to come in for bringing some of the issues forward.
[2:43:10.940 --> 2:43:11.940]  But, you know, same with Glenn Beck.
[2:43:11.940 --> 2:43:14.940]  People look at Glenn Beck and now think that he's on our side
[2:43:14.940 --> 2:43:19.940]  when Glenn Beck says that he hates the 9-11 victims' family members
[2:43:19.940 --> 2:43:23.940]  for raising questions and for not going along with the government.
[2:43:23.940 --> 2:43:26.940]  That clip is widely available on YouTube.
[2:43:26.940 --> 2:43:28.940]  No, no, no. Beck's running a scythe.
[2:43:28.940 --> 2:43:30.940]  When Ron Paul had a chance to win, he came out and said,
[2:43:30.940 --> 2:43:33.940]  Ron Paul is dangerous. His members are going to attack.
[2:43:33.940 --> 2:43:36.940]  The U.S. military needs to be used against them in 9-11 truthers.
[2:43:36.940 --> 2:43:39.940]  And you notice all the shows said that in the same week.
[2:43:39.940 --> 2:43:43.940]  It was a script, word-for-word, Hannity, O'Reilly,
[2:43:43.940 --> 2:43:46.940]  The Morning Joe on MSNBC.
[2:43:46.940 --> 2:43:48.940]  It's in truth rising. They all say,
[2:43:48.940 --> 2:43:51.940]  Taser them, torture them, take them to camps, and they're serious.
[2:43:51.940 --> 2:43:54.940]  And then we show a video of them actually arresting 9-11 truthers
[2:43:54.940 --> 2:43:57.940]  in street corners and dragging them off seeing their terrorists
[2:43:57.940 --> 2:43:59.940]  for having signs.
[2:43:59.940 --> 2:44:02.940]  And then once it was too late and now they think they're safe,
[2:44:02.940 --> 2:44:04.940]  they know everybody's awake to them.
[2:44:04.940 --> 2:44:08.940]  So now he's suddenly, oh my gosh, foreign banks are taking us over.
[2:44:08.940 --> 2:44:12.940]  It's a new world order. But see, now suddenly it's in the Financial Times of London
[2:44:12.940 --> 2:44:14.940]  published by a Bilderberg group member.
[2:44:14.940 --> 2:44:16.940]  Now it's in Time and Newsweek.
[2:44:16.940 --> 2:44:20.940]  Now it's okay to admit the world government and he'll play the part
[2:44:20.940 --> 2:44:22.940]  of the little voice that's against it
[2:44:22.940 --> 2:44:25.940]  and he can later betray people by getting trust.
[2:44:25.940 --> 2:44:28.940]  Well, that's probably part of the reason why he was taken over by Fox News.
[2:44:28.940 --> 2:44:31.940]  He used to have his television show on CNN
[2:44:31.940 --> 2:44:34.940]  and I think probably he didn't have a tight enough leash on him over there.
[2:44:34.940 --> 2:44:39.940]  So Rupert Murdoch and that crew over there needed to pull him over to Fox News
[2:44:39.940 --> 2:44:44.940]  so that they could teach him the ways of the true force of propaganda
[2:44:44.940 --> 2:44:46.940]  and of Fox News.
[2:44:46.940 --> 2:44:52.940]  This goes along with the religious beliefs of these individuals,
[2:44:52.940 --> 2:44:57.940]  the high-level masons, the Illuminati, which maybe we can get into here in a little bit.
[2:44:57.940 --> 2:45:00.940]  They are liars. They are propagandists.
[2:45:00.940 --> 2:45:03.940]  They keep their own belief systems to themselves
[2:45:03.940 --> 2:45:11.940]  and dispense false ideas where you look at most religions, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism,
[2:45:11.940 --> 2:45:17.940]  any major mainstream religion wants people to learn about the truths of their religion,
[2:45:17.940 --> 2:45:22.940]  learn about the principles, to understand kind of their place in the universe.
[2:45:22.940 --> 2:45:24.940]  They're not secret.
[2:45:24.940 --> 2:45:27.940]  I mean, Rob Jacobson who works here had a great way of putting it.
[2:45:27.940 --> 2:45:32.940]  If your religious group is secret and has different sub-guilds,
[2:45:32.940 --> 2:45:34.940]  the secret is their worship in the devil.
[2:45:34.940 --> 2:45:39.940]  And in any group you look at that's like that, you always find that. Go ahead.
[2:45:39.940 --> 2:45:44.940]  Yeah, you can walk in with the exception of some splinter groups
[2:45:44.940 --> 2:45:47.940]  that have taken the teachings and turned them into a cult.
[2:45:47.940 --> 2:45:52.940]  Any Christian church, any mosque, any temple, you can go in and learn the principles of that religion
[2:45:52.940 --> 2:45:57.940]  except for these high-level groups, these masons, the skull and bones individuals.
[2:45:57.940 --> 2:46:01.940]  And if you look at their own writings again, which I did a lot of writing in college
[2:46:01.940 --> 2:46:04.940]  and you can't just make a claim, you have to source it.
[2:46:04.940 --> 2:46:09.940]  And so that's what I do. I find the sources for all these so that people,
[2:46:09.940 --> 2:46:11.940]  they know where this information is coming from.
[2:46:11.940 --> 2:46:13.940]  It's not just my interpretation of this.
[2:46:13.940 --> 2:46:16.940]  It's not just something I saw on a random website.
[2:46:16.940 --> 2:46:21.940]  Here is a quote from Albert Pike in his 1872 book, Morals and Dogma,
[2:46:21.940 --> 2:46:24.940]  which is considered the Bible of Freemasonry.
[2:46:24.940 --> 2:46:26.940]  And he openly admits, quote,
[2:46:26.940 --> 2:46:34.940]  all religions, all mysteries, conceals its secrets from all except the adepts and the sages or the elect and uses false explanations
[2:46:34.940 --> 2:46:39.940]  and misinterpretations of the symbols to lead those who deserve to be misled
[2:46:39.940 --> 2:46:45.940]  to conceal the truth which it, the masons, calls light from them and to draw them away from it.
[2:46:45.940 --> 2:46:49.940]  So there, he's openly admitting that they're lying to individuals
[2:46:49.940 --> 2:46:53.940]  and people don't know on the lower-level echelons of masery.
[2:46:53.940 --> 2:46:58.940]  They said, well, that's just a fraternity. This isn't any sort of religion or spiritual teaching.
[2:46:58.940 --> 2:47:02.940]  It's just a fraternity for a bunch of guys, but that's the case on the lower levels.
[2:47:02.940 --> 2:47:05.940]  When you start getting up to the 30th degree, the 33rd degree,
[2:47:05.940 --> 2:47:08.940]  you know, Pike admits on page 213 in Morals and Dogma,
[2:47:08.940 --> 2:47:14.940]  every Masonic lodge is a temple of religion and its teachings are instructions in religion.
[2:47:14.940 --> 2:47:18.940]  And so, yeah, you know, that can be the most disturbing point.
[2:47:18.940 --> 2:47:21.940]  It's not addressed a lot when we're discussing the New World Order,
[2:47:21.940 --> 2:47:25.940]  but these groups do worship Lucifer. They worship Satan.
[2:47:25.940 --> 2:47:28.940]  That's their religion. That's their worldview.
[2:47:28.940 --> 2:47:31.940]  And we can get into that in a little more detail.
[2:47:31.940 --> 2:47:33.940]  And that was the same issue with the Nazis.
[2:47:33.940 --> 2:47:36.940]  And people look at the Nazis and obviously know that they're evil,
[2:47:36.940 --> 2:47:44.940]  that they were just corrupt to the core, completely out of control, mega-moniacal group
[2:47:44.940 --> 2:47:48.940]  that hated everybody and that just ruthlessly killed millions of people.
[2:47:48.940 --> 2:47:51.940]  But at the core of it was a religious teaching.
[2:47:51.940 --> 2:47:55.940]  And Hitler himself was a student of Helena Bolvatsky
[2:47:55.940 --> 2:48:02.940]  and in her book The Secret Doctrine in 1888 quite openly admits that they worshiped Lucifer.
[2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:07.940]  And even Albert Pike in Morals and Dogma makes a reference to Lucifer, the lightbearer,
[2:48:07.940 --> 2:48:10.940]  strange and mysterious name to give to the spirit of darkness.
[2:48:10.940 --> 2:48:14.940]  You know, Lucifer, the son of the morning, is it him who bears the light?
[2:48:14.940 --> 2:48:18.940]  Doubt it not. That's on page 321 of the book.
[2:48:18.940 --> 2:48:19.940]  And the letters he wrote, he said,
[2:48:19.940 --> 2:48:21.940]  I feel the power of Lucifer seething in my hands.
[2:48:21.940 --> 2:48:24.940]  That was Manly P. Hall in one of his books.
[2:48:24.940 --> 2:48:29.940]  I believe Pike wrote a letter. I believe that's the term, but I guess Hall wrote it too,
[2:48:29.940 --> 2:48:31.940]  but I'm going for memory.
[2:48:31.940 --> 2:48:34.940]  This is the teaching that these people adhere to.
[2:48:34.940 --> 2:48:36.940]  And you talk to low-level masons and they go,
[2:48:36.940 --> 2:48:39.940]  oh, no, that's, see, they test you and if you're a good guy,
[2:48:39.940 --> 2:48:41.940]  they just use you and you stay low-level.
[2:48:41.940 --> 2:48:45.940]  But if you're down with the game, come on up to the Hellfire Club.
[2:48:45.940 --> 2:48:47.940]  To get into the original Bavarian Illuminati,
[2:48:47.940 --> 2:48:50.940]  the new recruit was blindfolded and given a knife
[2:48:50.940 --> 2:48:55.940]  and was told that they had to stab and kill an individual that had betrayed their order.
[2:48:55.940 --> 2:48:59.940]  And it really was just that it was an animal or it was a tuft of cotton or something.
[2:48:59.940 --> 2:49:05.940]  And they had to stab into the, into this sheep or into this animal, into something.
[2:49:05.940 --> 2:49:08.940]  And then they would be unblindfolded and realize that it wasn't a person
[2:49:08.940 --> 2:49:12.940]  they wanted to test them to see if they would, in fact, kill for the group.
[2:49:12.940 --> 2:49:14.940]  Well, that's gang psychology.
[2:49:14.940 --> 2:49:17.940]  And that's, you know, that's why different street gangs have you go out
[2:49:17.940 --> 2:49:20.940]  and kill somebody or first rob to get in the group and then kill somebody
[2:49:20.940 --> 2:49:23.940]  to become upper echelon because now you're compromised.
[2:49:23.940 --> 2:49:25.940]  Now you've proven, now you've gone over.
[2:49:25.940 --> 2:49:27.940]  You know, going back to Sean Hannity and people denying
[2:49:27.940 --> 2:49:30.940]  that there's a new world order or a Bilderberg trial commission,
[2:49:30.940 --> 2:49:35.940]  when, you know, all their friends are in it and, of course, you're, you know, aware of it.
[2:49:35.940 --> 2:49:38.940]  And I've seen Sean Hannity say every militia member should be arrested.
[2:49:38.940 --> 2:49:39.940]  Every child needs a chip.
[2:49:39.940 --> 2:49:41.940]  And oh, it's so conservative.
[2:49:41.940 --> 2:49:48.940]  That's like the FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover, before Congress in the 50s
[2:49:48.940 --> 2:49:51.940]  saying organized crime doesn't exist.
[2:49:51.940 --> 2:49:53.940]  LaCosta Nostra is a conspiracy theory.
[2:49:53.940 --> 2:49:56.940]  He's the first one to say that.
[2:49:56.940 --> 2:50:00.940]  Now there was an individual that was, that was arrested.
[2:50:00.940 --> 2:50:04.940]  I can't remember his name, but he was one of the first people to really expose
[2:50:04.940 --> 2:50:06.940]  the Italian mafia.
[2:50:06.940 --> 2:50:08.940]  And he was locked up in a mental institution.
[2:50:08.940 --> 2:50:12.940]  This is on the History Channel, actually, on one of their specials on the mob.
[2:50:12.940 --> 2:50:16.940]  And this man came forward and he explained how the mob worked,
[2:50:16.940 --> 2:50:21.940]  what kinds of businesses they had their hands in, how powerful they were,
[2:50:21.940 --> 2:50:24.940]  that they would, you know, buy off judges and police officers,
[2:50:24.940 --> 2:50:27.940]  that they were running criminal enterprises.
[2:50:27.940 --> 2:50:29.940]  And this man was put into a mental institution.
[2:50:29.940 --> 2:50:31.940]  They thought that he was insane.
[2:50:31.940 --> 2:50:34.940]  That such a thing could not exist.
[2:50:34.940 --> 2:50:36.940]  Well, the judge knew they were being paid off.
[2:50:36.940 --> 2:50:41.940]  Well, those famous author Ezra Pound, Pulitzer Prize winner,
[2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:43.940]  he wrote a book about the Federal Reserve,
[2:50:43.940 --> 2:50:45.940]  and they locked him up in a mental institution, said,
[2:50:45.940 --> 2:50:48.940]  is not private, you're going to a mental institution.
[2:50:48.940 --> 2:50:49.940]  Today, everybody knows it.
[2:50:49.940 --> 2:50:52.940]  So, see, they deny the New World Order while they're building it.
[2:50:52.940 --> 2:50:54.940]  And then now they think it's too late, so they're going,
[2:50:54.940 --> 2:50:56.940]  yeah, we're taking over.
[2:50:56.940 --> 2:50:58.940]  It's the only future you got.
[2:50:58.940 --> 2:51:01.940]  Martin Dies is our guest. Stay with us.

[2:51:59.940 --> 2:52:00.940]  Act now.
[2:52:00.940 --> 2:52:04.940]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[2:52:04.940 --> 2:52:07.940]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:10.940]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:52:10.940 --> 2:52:12.940]  But who is the enemy?
[2:52:12.940 --> 2:52:13.940]  Bin Laden.
[2:52:13.940 --> 2:52:14.940]  This is his MO.
[2:52:14.940 --> 2:52:15.940]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:52:15.940 --> 2:52:17.940]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:17.940 --> 2:52:24.940]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:52:24.940 --> 2:52:31.940]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:52:31.940 --> 2:52:35.940]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:35.940 --> 2:52:40.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:40.940 --> 2:52:45.940]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:52:45.940 --> 2:52:50.940]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super-high quality,
[2:52:50.940 --> 2:52:54.940]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:54.940 --> 2:53:23.940]  Whether you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:53:54.940 --> 2:54:12.940]  Welcome online at DeckCrisisSolutions.com. That's DeckCrisisSolutions.com today.
[2:54:12.940 --> 2:54:21.940]  We got Russell Means, Native American leader, been involved in frackuses with the federales.
[2:54:21.940 --> 2:54:23.940]  He's in a whole bunch of movies.
[2:54:23.940 --> 2:54:31.940]  He's going to be simulcasting with us on the webcam live at prisonplanet.tv, come up in about 10 minutes.
[2:54:31.940 --> 2:54:36.940]  Mark Dice, I want to talk about a few other issues with you and play this clip.
[2:54:36.940 --> 2:54:43.940]  We've got one more left here. We've played Hannity, we haven't played, we played Savage, we haven't played Combs yet,
[2:54:43.940 --> 2:54:48.940]  who's actually had me on and uncensored me and let me talk about false flag terror a few times,
[2:54:48.940 --> 2:54:52.940]  and then I got the word he wasn't really supposed to have me back on anymore, but as I've been on there in a few years.
[2:54:52.940 --> 2:54:56.940]  But briefly tell folks about the resistance manifesto. We carry it at infowars.com.
[2:54:56.940 --> 2:55:01.940]  On the back cover it says, powerful and compelling, I must read Alex Jones.
[2:55:01.940 --> 2:55:07.940]  But then it's got other quotes here, but the 9-11 attacks, the Illuminati, Bohemian Grove,
[2:55:07.940 --> 2:55:10.940]  Bilderberg group, Georgia Guidestones, Scull and Bones, Freemasonry, cybernetic organisms,
[2:55:10.940 --> 2:55:15.940]  Satanism, Mark and the Beast, the Federal Reserve, neural interfaces, mind control echelon,
[2:55:15.940 --> 2:55:21.940]  killing machines, animal and human hybrids. I mean this is a great book, it's a thick book.
[2:55:21.940 --> 2:55:27.940]  You know, 450-something pages or whatever. You know, 400 and you get the exact page number here.
[2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:34.940]  450 exactly. This is a great book to give somebody because each chapter is jam-packed,
[2:55:34.940 --> 2:55:39.940]  but it's a great and informative read, and you just read a chapter a night for a few weeks
[2:55:39.940 --> 2:55:42.940]  and you'll know quite a bit. This is something great to give people,
[2:55:42.940 --> 2:55:47.940]  and I hope they'll go to infowars.com and get it, or go to the resistancemanifesto.com and get it.
[2:55:47.940 --> 2:55:54.940]  You know, I try to compile most of the important issues in organizations and belief systems
[2:55:54.940 --> 2:56:00.940]  that are involved in creating the New World Order, and of course there's a chapter in there on 9-11
[2:56:00.940 --> 2:56:04.940]  covering the evidence for that, but there is so much, and I know that a lot of the audience
[2:56:04.940 --> 2:56:08.940]  is very well informed. I know there's new people listening every day,
[2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:15.940]  and so to save yourself just hours and hours of scouring the Internet and just kind of reading random quotes
[2:56:15.940 --> 2:56:21.940]  that aren't sourced. I spend a lot of time and fully source the quotes that I use
[2:56:21.940 --> 2:56:27.940]  and I own most of these occult books and establishment books, and so a lot of the manifesto
[2:56:27.940 --> 2:56:33.940]  isn't just me making allegations. I'm quoting from insiders like Carol Quigley
[2:56:33.940 --> 2:56:37.940]  and covering issues, quoting directly out of the secret doctrine,
[2:56:37.940 --> 2:56:42.940]  and just kind of put it into a context and into the perspective so that you can understand
[2:56:42.940 --> 2:56:46.940]  what it is that's driving the New World Order, why they're doing this,
[2:56:46.940 --> 2:56:51.940]  what their ultimate plan is going to be, how these secret societies are functioning
[2:56:51.940 --> 2:56:56.940]  to secretly pull the strings, the belief systems of these secret societies,
[2:56:56.940 --> 2:57:02.940]  and then ultimately how it is that they are satanic, what that means,
[2:57:02.940 --> 2:57:09.940]  and how this New Age belief system parallels with Bible prophecy in a way
[2:57:09.940 --> 2:57:15.940]  that leads all the way ultimately to the Antichrist coming on the scene,
[2:57:15.940 --> 2:57:19.940]  which could be hundreds of years from now, it could be thousands of years,
[2:57:19.940 --> 2:57:24.940]  but ultimately the goal of this is these New Age individuals...
[2:57:24.940 --> 2:57:28.940]  Even if you don't believe in Christianity, the elite believe in a world Christ
[2:57:28.940 --> 2:57:33.940]  who's going to kill the majority of those that won't take a, quote, Luciferian initiation.
[2:57:33.940 --> 2:57:36.940]  This is what the Pentagon at the higher levels teaches, and I know you source that.
[2:57:36.940 --> 2:57:39.940]  I mean, you can't make something this crazy up.
[2:57:39.940 --> 2:57:44.940]  No, no. I mean, they're building this world system, and that's the plan,
[2:57:44.940 --> 2:57:50.940]  is to unleash this Illuminati Christ, and the New Age gurus have different ideas
[2:57:50.940 --> 2:57:55.940]  as to who it will be. It sort of ties in with the theory of the Holy Bloodline,
[2:57:55.940 --> 2:58:00.940]  and from the Da Vinci Code only, it's not a bloodline of Jesus,
[2:58:00.940 --> 2:58:03.940]  it's really this Merovingian bloodline that they're keeping
[2:58:03.940 --> 2:58:07.940]  so that they can claim when this individual becomes the president of the New World Order,
[2:58:07.940 --> 2:58:12.940]  this Obama-like figure, that they can claim them that he is divine,
[2:58:12.940 --> 2:58:15.940]  he's from the divine blood, that he is the one that's just...
[2:58:15.940 --> 2:58:21.940]  Well, we're reporting even as sociologists, just coldly, and as historians,
[2:58:21.940 --> 2:58:25.940]  what they believe, one minute break, 70 seconds to be technical.
[2:58:25.940 --> 2:58:28.940]  I'm trying to be absolutely precise, training my mind to do that.
[2:58:28.940 --> 2:58:33.940]  70-second break, we're gonna come right back to our guest,
[2:58:33.940 --> 2:58:59.940]  and then talk about, does he think Obama is a proto-type, anti-Christ individual?
[2:59:04.940 --> 2:59:08.940]  I think he's gonna take it, because he's not going to be able to do it.
[2:59:08.940 --> 2:59:11.940]  I'm not gonna say that, you'll never have to go to the Superdome,
[2:59:11.940 --> 2:59:15.940]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family, in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[2:59:15.940 --> 2:59:19.940]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[2:59:19.940 --> 2:59:23.940]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:59:23.940 --> 2:59:26.940]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[2:59:26.940 --> 2:59:29.940]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[2:59:29.940 --> 2:59:33.940]  So go to eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, freeze dried,
[2:59:33.940 --> 2:59:35.940]  and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[3:00:16.940 --> 3:00:20.940]  We're talking to Thomas American Indian since sitting bull in Crazy Horse,
[3:00:20.940 --> 3:00:24.940]  with a whole host of issues with him coming up.
[3:00:24.940 --> 3:00:29.940]  Right now we're talking to Mark Dice, doing a great job out there exposing the globalist.
[3:00:29.940 --> 3:00:31.940]  A few minutes on Obama.
[3:00:31.940 --> 3:00:33.940]  I mean, he's gone back on every promise.
[3:00:33.940 --> 3:00:35.940]  He's openly run by the globalist.
[3:00:35.940 --> 3:00:39.940]  He is promising people he's going to help him on all these bringings, tyranny.
[3:00:39.940 --> 3:00:44.940]  And he does it so sincerely that you can see an evil layer to the smile.
[3:00:44.940 --> 3:00:49.940]  This is not going to end well, because when all that comes is pain and suffering,
[3:00:49.940 --> 3:00:52.940]  some people are going to become even more cult-like following him,
[3:00:52.940 --> 3:00:54.940]  saying, you didn't do what he said.
[3:00:54.940 --> 3:00:55.940]  That's why things are bad.
[3:00:55.940 --> 3:00:58.940]  But a lot of other followers, they're going to flip out.
[3:00:58.940 --> 3:01:00.940]  I mean, how do you see this unfolding?
[3:01:00.940 --> 3:01:03.940]  Your view on Obama and the whole phenomenon.
[3:01:03.940 --> 3:01:08.940]  Well, it's coming crumbling down to some people that have a discerning view.
[3:01:08.940 --> 3:01:14.940]  But Obama is the ultimate anti-Christ figure, I'm not saying he's the anti-Christ from the Bible.
[3:01:14.940 --> 3:01:17.940]  A more accurate term really is a counterfeit Christ.
[3:01:17.940 --> 3:01:21.940]  And not that he's overtly against Christ or against Jesus.
[3:01:21.940 --> 3:01:24.940]  He's a prototype anti-Christ, and there are many anti-Christ.
[3:01:24.940 --> 3:01:28.940]  Because he comes as a savior when he's a Judas Goat and a betrayer.
[3:01:28.940 --> 3:01:29.940]  Go ahead.
[3:01:29.940 --> 3:01:33.940]  Yeah, and you have people at these town hall meetings the other day asking him
[3:01:33.940 --> 3:01:38.940]  not to just change policy to help certain issues or segments of society,
[3:01:38.940 --> 3:01:41.940]  but they're asking him, can you get me a job?
[3:01:41.940 --> 3:01:43.940]  Can you get me a kitchen?
[3:01:43.940 --> 3:01:44.940]  Can you get my benefits?
[3:01:44.940 --> 3:01:48.940]  And so he's this ultimate counterfeit Christ, similar to Hitler.
[3:01:48.940 --> 3:01:50.940]  Hitler was a counterfeit Christ, anti-Christ figure,
[3:01:50.940 --> 3:01:54.940]  where to a certain segment of the population he had saved to Germany.
[3:01:54.940 --> 3:01:59.940]  But then there's this other certain minority group that's preventing him
[3:01:59.940 --> 3:02:04.940]  from really helping society, and so he puts all the blame off onto them.
[3:02:04.940 --> 3:02:06.940]  And so it's going to be very difficult.
[3:02:06.940 --> 3:02:10.940]  People like this audience, we're going to be demonized by the Obama worshipers
[3:02:10.940 --> 3:02:15.940]  as we're the problem because we didn't go along with the Christ Obama
[3:02:15.940 --> 3:02:19.940]  and we're the reason that the economy continued to collapse.
[3:02:19.940 --> 3:02:24.940]  So I'm not an expert on the economy, but I do look at the experts at Peter Schiff
[3:02:24.940 --> 3:02:28.940]  and at Gerald Salente at the International Forecaster
[3:02:28.940 --> 3:02:33.940]  and what they're saying is happening is really going to be a bad thing.
[3:02:33.940 --> 3:02:37.940]  And you can just look at pretty much the opposite of whatever Obama says is going to happen
[3:02:37.940 --> 3:02:40.940]  or he's going to do is what he's going to do.
[3:02:40.940 --> 3:02:45.940]  He says that he's going to save the economy while he's going to destroy the economy.
[3:02:45.940 --> 3:02:50.940]  He says during the campaign that he was against illegal wiretapping,
[3:02:50.940 --> 3:02:54.940]  and then he voted for immunity for the wiretapping.
[3:02:54.940 --> 3:02:58.940]  So you can pretty much take whatever they say they're going to do.
[3:02:58.940 --> 3:03:00.940]  And then he says he's going to shut down the torture camps,
[3:03:00.940 --> 3:03:05.940]  but it says they'll look at it in a year, but they're going to keep renditions and secret camps.
[3:03:05.940 --> 3:03:09.940]  Yeah, you know, never before in the history of the United States,
[3:03:09.940 --> 3:03:15.940]  maybe in the world have we had a figure that is so, so adorized by the media and by the people.
[3:03:15.940 --> 3:03:22.940]  Yeah, that's it. It's that they're positioning him as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Jesus, all in one,
[3:03:22.940 --> 3:03:26.940]  literally transposing his face with famous people just saying he is God.
[3:03:26.940 --> 3:03:27.940]  Do what he says.
[3:03:27.940 --> 3:03:34.940]  But all he is is a wet blanket on the fires of liberty and resistance and rebellion to the New World Order crime syndicate.
[3:03:34.940 --> 3:03:38.940]  He's just meant to stall the people long enough when they're done with Obama.
[3:03:38.940 --> 3:03:44.940]  They are going to tear him apart, but then blame it all on him, just like they did on Bush.
[3:03:44.940 --> 3:03:53.940]  You know, KRS-1 had a fantastic analogy for this, and he used the analogy of a McDonald's or Burger King manager
[3:03:53.940 --> 3:03:56.940]  seeming to be the man that's in control that makes all the decisions.
[3:03:56.940 --> 3:03:59.940]  And that's really what Obama is, is he's just the manager.
[3:03:59.940 --> 3:04:04.940]  He's the figurehead working for, you know, for the Bilderberg group,
[3:04:04.940 --> 3:04:07.940]  for really ultimately the Illuminati and the globalist.
[3:04:07.940 --> 3:04:16.940]  And so he's the man that is the picture of the face, the one who makes all the decisions when really he's nothing more than a spokesman.
[3:04:16.940 --> 3:04:21.940]  And I'm sure that most of the population thinks that when he comes out to public rally and speaks,
[3:04:21.940 --> 3:04:25.940]  they think that he's just talking, just like me and you are talking now, just off the top of his head,
[3:04:25.940 --> 3:04:29.940]  because they don't show the teleprompters on the television very rarely.
[3:04:29.940 --> 3:04:33.940]  They don't show that everywhere he goes, it's the exact same speech, scripted down to going,
[3:04:33.940 --> 3:04:37.940]  oh man, oh, just all the acting, exactly.
[3:04:37.940 --> 3:04:40.940]  They don't know that they have these teleprompters out there, three teleprompters,
[3:04:40.940 --> 3:04:44.940]  even when he's publicly speaking, so he's not speaking, he's reading off the teleprompter.
[3:04:44.940 --> 3:04:49.940]  The Resistance Manifesto, available at infowars.com and markdice.com.
[3:04:49.940 --> 3:04:53.940]  Hope you'll get the book and spread the word and get it out to folks, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:04:53.940 --> 3:04:54.940]  Mark Dice, great having you on.
[3:04:54.940 --> 3:04:56.940]  You got it, power to the resistance.
[3:04:56.940 --> 3:04:58.940]  Take care, power to the resistance, here we go.
[3:04:58.940 --> 3:05:00.940]  We'll be right back with Russell Means.
[3:05:00.940 --> 3:05:03.940]  Right now, the world is a scary place.
[3:05:03.940 --> 3:05:08.940]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[3:05:08.940 --> 3:05:13.940]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[3:05:13.940 --> 3:05:16.940]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[3:05:16.940 --> 3:05:20.940]  The First Line of Defense Kit includes neutral immune and neutral defense,
[3:05:20.940 --> 3:05:23.940]  providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry,
[3:05:23.940 --> 3:05:26.940]  and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[3:05:26.940 --> 3:05:31.940]  Also included, the nanomask nanoparticular antiviral masks with replacement filters,
[3:05:31.940 --> 3:05:35.940]  providing supreme viral protection from airborne pathogens.
[3:05:35.940 --> 3:05:41.940]  And the First Line of Defense Wipes allows non-toxic viral and bacterial pathogen killing power on all surfaces.
[3:05:41.940 --> 3:05:46.940]  The First Line Defense Kit is available now by calling 888-212-8871.

[3:06:01.940 --> 3:06:08.940]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:06:08.940 --> 3:06:12.940]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:06:12.940 --> 3:06:13.940]  Bin Laden.
[3:06:13.940 --> 3:06:14.940]  This is his MO.
[3:06:14.940 --> 3:06:17.940]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:06:17.940 --> 3:06:24.940]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:06:24.940 --> 3:06:31.940]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:06:31.940 --> 3:06:35.940]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:35.940 --> 3:06:42.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:06:42.940 --> 3:06:46.940]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[3:06:53.940 --> 3:07:01.940]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:07:01.940 --> 3:07:04.940]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:07:04.940 --> 3:07:10.940]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:07:10.940 --> 3:07:15.940]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:07:15.940 --> 3:07:23.940]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron,
[3:07:23.940 --> 3:07:27.940]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[3:07:27.940 --> 3:07:33.940]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[3:07:33.940 --> 3:07:39.940]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[3:08:21.940 --> 3:08:23.940]  Alex Jones.
[3:08:23.940 --> 3:08:26.940]  He really is a man who needs no introduction.
[3:08:26.940 --> 3:08:36.940]  Russell means just an amazing life and didn't like to talk about himself, but he is what the LA Times calls,
[3:08:36.940 --> 3:08:41.940]  described him as the most famous American Indian since sitting bull and crazy horse.
[3:08:41.940 --> 3:08:46.940]  I would say much better known because of all the films and activism and things he's done.
[3:08:46.940 --> 3:09:00.940]  And he joins us, he's been with us four or five times before, but he now joins us through video cam from the Lakota Nation that has pulled out of the treaty that the federal government has broken a trillion times.
[3:09:00.940 --> 3:09:05.940]  He joins us from there and I tell you he is just so informed on the whole new order structure.
[3:09:05.940 --> 3:09:13.940]  So we're going to get his take on now 21 states saying they are going to secede if the feds try martial law or gun confiscation.
[3:09:13.940 --> 3:09:19.940]  That's in the bills. The Lakota Nation is saying that they're not going along with the tyranny.
[3:09:19.940 --> 3:09:25.940]  They've got the strongest case because the treaty has been violated, even stronger than the states.
[3:09:25.940 --> 3:09:29.940]  This is so exciting. So Russell means great to have you with us.
[3:09:29.940 --> 3:09:31.940]  Great to be with you again, Alex.
[3:09:31.940 --> 3:09:36.940]  I tell you this is like Buck Rogers getting to have you on the simulcast on TV with us.
[3:09:36.940 --> 3:09:40.940]  It's unbelievable.
[3:09:40.940 --> 3:09:45.940]  Well, here we are. You know, there's so much I want to talk about in the 50 minutes we have with you, but you've got the floor.
[3:09:45.940 --> 3:09:51.940]  What would you like to speak about first? There's so many things I want to get into, but what would you like to speak about first?
[3:09:51.940 --> 3:09:55.940]  Well, first of all, I'd like to speak about liberty and freedom.
[3:09:55.940 --> 3:10:05.940]  Being free is the most important antidote to everything and anything else that's going on, to any kind of conspiracy to everything.
[3:10:05.940 --> 3:10:15.940]  It's being free and being free together. Not being free according to the Constitution in the United States, although that's a pretty good document.
[3:10:15.940 --> 3:10:19.940]  It comes from us, as you know, or you should know.
[3:10:19.940 --> 3:10:20.940]  Yes, you're right.
[3:10:20.940 --> 3:10:32.940]  But the most important thing about being free is individual sovereignty, individual freedoms, and they guarantees thereof.
[3:10:32.940 --> 3:10:36.940]  And the only way you can do that really is through consensus.
[3:10:36.940 --> 3:10:55.940]  Because voting, as you've witnessed how the beautiful idea of freedom the United States of America was born with has been corrupted because they've turned a republic and individual freedom into a democracy which means mob rule.
[3:10:55.940 --> 3:10:59.940]  You know, 50 percent plus one is mob rule.
[3:10:59.940 --> 3:11:10.940]  And the worst thing about it is that the other 49.9 percent have to go along with the majority for a certain length of time.
[3:11:10.940 --> 3:11:15.940]  You haven't any options. That's not sovereignty. That is not being free.
[3:11:15.940 --> 3:11:18.940]  That's right. Hitler used democracy to set up tyranny.
[3:11:18.940 --> 3:11:28.940]  And 51 percent said the rest of you are going to be our slaves and we're going to kill a bunch of you. In a republic, every person's liberty and freedom is guarded because of the organic rights.
[3:11:28.940 --> 3:11:35.940]  And as the Declaration of Independence states that if the government becomes destructive of those aims, it is not our right.
[3:11:35.940 --> 3:11:37.940]  It is our duty to throw it off.
[3:11:37.940 --> 3:11:43.940]  And I can think of no other group that has a stronger case to throw it off as Native Americans.
[3:11:43.940 --> 3:11:53.940]  Right. And that's why we unilaterally withdrew from our treaties with the United States of America after over 155 years of violations.
[3:11:53.940 --> 3:11:58.940]  So we finally threw off that yoke. We're on the brink of extinction ourselves.
[3:11:58.940 --> 3:12:01.940]  And that is the major reason we are now free.
[3:12:01.940 --> 3:12:04.940]  And we're free with non-Indians also.
[3:12:04.940 --> 3:12:16.940]  We are welcoming any and all peoples who want to be free and want to work for freedom in the Republic of Lakota, which is that five state area in the northern plains.
[3:12:16.940 --> 3:12:26.940]  But there's a thing about America that we must begin to teach the whole scope of this, what is termed now, a conspiracy.
[3:12:26.940 --> 3:12:40.940]  Because it began really back in the 1840s, less than 75 years after the formation of the United States of America, when they gave the power of the individual to corporations.
[3:12:40.940 --> 3:12:44.940]  But none of the penalties, none of the penalties.
[3:12:44.940 --> 3:12:49.940]  Consequently, the corporations began to take off.
[3:12:49.940 --> 3:12:58.940]  But when Congress committed treason in 1871, that's really the watermark of the beginnings of the conspiracy.
[3:12:58.940 --> 3:13:09.940]  Because the 1871 act created the corporation, which we are now enslaved under, or you are all enslaved under, because we're no longer there.
[3:13:09.940 --> 3:13:19.940]  The 1871 act was a treasonous act by Congress, which established the United States of America as a corporation.
[3:13:19.940 --> 3:13:31.940]  And the Constitution of the United States was established at that time, because previously our Republic was guaranteed by the Constitution for the United States.
[3:13:31.940 --> 3:13:33.940]  Key word there.
[3:13:33.940 --> 3:13:51.940]  Then you go on to 1913 and those other years, the Income Tax Act, the Antitrust Act, and the various other acts that established the Fed and established the bankers control of our entire nation.
[3:13:51.940 --> 3:14:05.940]  And it's people within and made us slaves. And then you get to 1933 and off the gold standard, the Social Security National ID number was established.
[3:14:05.940 --> 3:14:13.940]  And then you get into the Industrial Military Complex, which was cemented into place after World War II.
[3:14:13.940 --> 3:14:24.940]  And with the No Such Agency Act of 1948, which was, by the way, the National Security Agency.
[3:14:24.940 --> 3:14:29.940]  If you remember, I can, because I'm that old, I can remember when it was called No Such Agency.
[3:14:29.940 --> 3:14:36.940]  Because to this day, no one knows the real power or the scope of that agency, or even its budget.
[3:14:36.940 --> 3:14:39.940]  Not even Congress knows its budget.
[3:14:39.940 --> 3:14:50.940]  And then you have the subsequent acts and the conspiracies that we've all come to know and abhor right now and what we're living under.
[3:14:50.940 --> 3:14:53.940]  I was just going to interject and have you continue with that timeline.
[3:14:53.940 --> 3:15:07.940]  They've now announced the National Security Council through the NSA and the rest of it is openly running the entire government that the governors in PDD 51, the John Warren Defense Authorization Act serve at the pleasure of the president.
[3:15:07.940 --> 3:15:09.940]  People thought Obama was going to end all this. He's expanding it.
[3:15:09.940 --> 3:15:17.940]  Bush passed the baton. They put in their Judas Goat to fool people. And I'd like to get your view on that.
[3:15:17.940 --> 3:15:23.940]  And now they're openly announcing the FEMA camps. They're openly announcing bills to basically ban guns.
[3:15:23.940 --> 3:15:30.940]  And I mean, you pointed out yourself, they brought in Social Security to domesticate us to put everybody on the reservation.
[3:15:30.940 --> 3:15:37.940]  You know, how they want us dependent, how they want us domesticated, how they want us institutionalized.
[3:15:37.940 --> 3:15:41.940]  And then they always call that right wing to say that, no, it's not right or left.
[3:15:41.940 --> 3:15:47.940]  This is, so I'd like you to speak to that specifically and the dark times we see unfolding right now.
[3:15:47.940 --> 3:15:56.940]  But at the same time, the positive things that are happening because resistance is accelerating and people are rediscovering liberty and freedom and finding out they don't have a choice.
[3:15:56.940 --> 3:15:59.940]  They're going to have to fight.
[3:15:59.940 --> 3:16:09.940]  You know, back in the 1970s, right here on the Pine Ridge Children's Reservation, all of a sudden, for reasons it will never be explained or explainable,
[3:16:09.940 --> 3:16:15.940]  I started receiving quarterly reports from the trilateral commission in the U.S. mail.
[3:16:15.940 --> 3:16:17.940]  Wow.
[3:16:17.940 --> 3:16:23.940]  I don't know how I got it or why. And then it lasted for about a year and a half and it disappeared.
[3:16:23.940 --> 3:16:33.940]  But in those quarterly reports, it was phenomenal how they know everything about everything financial in the world.
[3:16:33.940 --> 3:16:48.940]  That the IMF and the World Bank, which is the credit agencies for every country, and they had a curious, they had a category called quasi-money.
[3:16:48.940 --> 3:16:55.940]  I've since come to understand what quasi-money is. It's you and me. It's our social security number.
[3:16:55.940 --> 3:17:03.940]  It's what enslaves us to all these financial packages the bankers who are running the world have put together.
[3:17:03.940 --> 3:17:10.940]  But Obama, listen, Obama is the good cop. They had the bad cop, good cop.
[3:17:10.940 --> 3:17:20.940]  This country now, it's mass psychology to its end. George Orwell nailed it back in the 1940s with his books.
[3:17:20.940 --> 3:17:33.940]  But the point we're now in at George Orwellian reality is the good cop now has made everyone feel, ah, now it's just in Texas, by the way, my friend.
[3:17:33.940 --> 3:17:43.940]  And their best selling down there is those plates. I couldn't believe it in Texas. The plates of Obama with that Jesus Christ pose.
[3:17:43.940 --> 3:17:49.940]  You know, it's like this. He's looking up, a slight smile. The sun is shining on him.
[3:17:49.940 --> 3:17:58.940]  And it makes his skin look bronze or even goldish. But it's the Jesus Christ pose. That's what I call it.
[3:17:58.940 --> 3:18:06.940]  And that's the way they're treating him. I talked to some Obama supporters there in Houston and it was unbelievable.
[3:18:06.940 --> 3:18:14.940]  They would not listen to reason. It's like they've been fed some kind of Obama dope and that they're hooked now.
[3:18:14.940 --> 3:18:21.940]  It's, oh, you know, you bring out facts and figures and they still wouldn't go for it.
[3:18:21.940 --> 3:18:36.940]  I can see exactly what he's done. It's almost like he's a drone, that he is some kind of sheeple created, especially to pull the cover over.
[3:18:36.940 --> 3:18:44.940]  You know, all his appointments are Zionists. All his appointments. I can't name one that isn't.
[3:18:44.940 --> 3:18:56.940]  The point I'm trying to make is that I believe the United States is part of the client state, not only of the bankers, but we're now a client state of Israel and the Mossad.
[3:18:56.940 --> 3:19:03.940]  It's unbelievable how all the people in key places, you know, are Zionists.
[3:19:03.940 --> 3:19:17.940]  I'm sorry, but the brazen upfront and your previous guest mentioned some of those brazen upfront and yourself of what Obama's doing.
[3:19:17.940 --> 3:19:27.940]  And he blatantly lies to the people and he's not called down for it. It's amazing. You know, you're Guantanamo. He's not closing it.
[3:19:27.940 --> 3:19:33.940]  He's not withdrawing from Iraq. He's going to increase war in Afghanistan. It goes on and on.
[3:19:33.940 --> 3:19:41.940]  Russell, I want you to repeat all that. In fact, I'm going to skip this break. We have the music, but I'm going to skip the break for the prisonplanet.tv viewers, the Internet stream.
[3:19:41.940 --> 3:19:46.940]  We'll be back for everybody else in four minutes, but I want to skip this break and continue talking. We can do that, right, guys?
[3:19:46.940 --> 3:19:55.940]  With Russell means because I don't want to waste any of this time and I love this new video hookup and I want to invite him anytime he's in Texas to please come into studio.
[3:19:55.940 --> 3:20:01.940]  We would really be honored to have that. So stay with us. We're going to continue Russell with Russell Means right now.
[3:20:01.940 --> 3:20:02.940]  Alex Jones.
[3:20:02.940 --> 3:20:15.940]  Okay. Russell continuing. Yeah, I've always tried to stray away because it's such hot button issues to anything that's Protestant, Catholic, Hindu, Native American,
[3:20:15.940 --> 3:20:21.940]  because I'm just like we're all human beings. Let's be friends. And the globalists use that to play us off against each other.
[3:20:21.940 --> 3:20:22.940]  Definitely.
[3:20:22.940 --> 3:20:30.940]  But at the same time, when Rahm Emanuel is openly a Mossad operative in the IDF military and it calls himself an Israeli first.
[3:20:30.940 --> 3:20:37.940]  He's the chief of staff and they're in a meeting. This is the New York Times. They're in a meeting in the New York Times and in front of the Congress.
[3:20:37.940 --> 3:20:44.940]  They call the congressional leaders in to both parties and Rahm's popping his fingers like this right by Obama and Obama says please stop that, Rahm.
[3:20:44.940 --> 3:20:55.940]  And Rahm gets up right in his ear and pops his knuckles in his ears and that is a sign of dominance. And it really is scary to know that special interests,
[3:20:55.940 --> 3:21:03.940]  you know, the big banks out of Europe, Israel, all these groups, that we're just a whorehouse. We're a joke. We're here to just be completely used in abuse.
[3:21:03.940 --> 3:21:12.940]  I want you to get into that and then start over because the music interrupted you with how Obama has already betrayed everything in just a month.
[3:21:12.940 --> 3:21:14.940]  Okay, fine.
[3:21:14.940 --> 3:21:16.940]  We're still alive. Go ahead.
[3:21:16.940 --> 3:21:33.940]  Well, you know, Obama, as I mentioned, he's not closing Guantanamo maybe in a year. He's not withdrawing from Iraq because of the situation there and the Iraqi freedom and the voting and the democracy.
[3:21:33.940 --> 3:21:46.940]  I mean, come on, you got the largest embassy in the world bar none and it's it's ostentatious like a palace. So why are you going to leave? You're never going to leave Afghanistan.
[3:21:46.940 --> 3:21:56.940]  They're already pouring new troops in there and they're making an Obama did this on the campaign trail. He named Pakistan.
[3:21:56.940 --> 3:22:07.940]  He's going in militarily into Pakistan. That's it. That's an Islamic country with the bomb. So it has to be taken over and he will take it over and mark my words.
[3:22:07.940 --> 3:22:19.940]  But he is he is when I was growing up, the used car salesman was was the epitome example of being slick con man.
[3:22:19.940 --> 3:22:32.940]  Well, this guy and I heard your previous guest mentioned about how he is so smooth on going from teleprompter to teleprompter to teleprompter.
[3:22:32.940 --> 3:22:42.940]  And and the people don't know it that are watching on TV, but he has it. He is he is trained. He's very well trained.
[3:22:42.940 --> 3:22:49.940]  And I think he might even be a clone. You know, it's not it's not beyond my comprehension.
[3:22:49.940 --> 3:22:55.940]  No, there is something robotic about him. I mean, it's just so fake. And for anybody who's got discernment, you see right through it.
[3:22:55.940 --> 3:23:00.940]  And you go, whoa, this is dangerous. This is because, you know, you have this little demon bush or even looks like a goblin.
[3:23:00.940 --> 3:23:05.940]  And and you know, it's obviously evil and it does all you see how it was scripted.
[3:23:05.940 --> 3:23:14.940]  And then it turns out his mother worked for Tim Geithner's dad at a big foundation and is totally globalist and they've been grooming him since he was a kid.
[3:23:14.940 --> 3:23:23.940]  That's now on record. And his first job was for Henry Kissinger. And so certainly he's been trained since he was a child for this role.
[3:23:23.940 --> 3:23:36.940]  I believe so. The other thing is, is look how they've now gotten so much control of the world. China has now announced that they're going to continue buying T bills.
[3:23:36.940 --> 3:23:46.940]  This country has been so emptied out. You know, you go to Europe, you go to Germany or the Netherlands or even the British islands.
[3:23:46.940 --> 3:23:55.940]  And they're still manufacturing. They're still have making shoes. They're still making clothes. They have a garment industry, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:23:55.940 --> 3:24:01.940]  They have fishing industries where we are where there's nothing that we can fall back on.
[3:24:01.940 --> 3:24:10.940]  All we have is a bunch of Social Security slaves that are minimum wage and that they keep knocking it down, knocking it down.
[3:24:10.940 --> 3:24:18.940]  You don't ever hear about massive parking. We skipped a break. So we're coming back to the full audience. We were just on the Internet.
[3:24:18.940 --> 3:24:20.940]  Now we're back to the full audience. Here we go.
[3:24:24.940 --> 3:24:33.940]  You know, I should brief my guest when I do this because it confuses things and it sounds like I'm interrupting Russell means we're on presentplanet.tv.
[3:24:33.940 --> 3:24:37.940]  We're streaming over the web. Hundreds of thousands are listening on the web.
[3:24:37.940 --> 3:24:44.940]  So I skipped those breaks. But on the AM and FM dial, when I skip a break, Russell, we then have to come back to the full segment.
[3:24:44.940 --> 3:24:47.940]  So I'm sorry I interrupted you there. I just don't want to waste any time with you.
[3:24:47.940 --> 3:24:55.940]  Please start back over with what you were saying a minute ago about being in Europe compared to the United States and how that ties into what was done to Native Americans,
[3:24:55.940 --> 3:25:05.940]  what was done to other Aboriginal groups around the world as a mode of siege, a mode of control. The globalists admit they've deindustrialized us by design. Please break it down.
[3:25:05.940 --> 3:25:16.940]  Well, break it down. It's Indian policy. The Americans are now the new Indians of the 21st century and the United States is the reservation.
[3:25:16.940 --> 3:25:31.940]  You look, you know, the farmers and the family farmers and family ranchers, the backbone of independence and the backbone of Americanism are the ones that have been systematically destroyed since the,
[3:25:31.940 --> 3:25:42.940]  at least since the decade of the 60s. Now, whereas America was being emptied out, now they turn this and this is, this is just fact that in the late 50s,
[3:25:42.940 --> 3:25:57.940]  they began turning America from a producing productive country with a powerful, powerful people called unions that were the biggest threat politically to the hierarchy of the United States of America.
[3:25:57.940 --> 3:26:09.940]  So in 1950, they got Walter Ruther and all them to sell out the unions. That's not the point though. The point is they began emptying out America, our garment industry, the shoe industry,
[3:26:09.940 --> 3:26:25.940]  every industry, the fishing industry, the steel industry, every industry you can think of. Then they started importing the Toyotas and those foreign corporations in to further destroy our,
[3:26:25.940 --> 3:26:38.940]  our own industries. Then having done that, we're empty. We're slaves now, minimum wage slaves. The middle class has been decimated.
[3:26:38.940 --> 3:26:47.940]  Look, and we're not hearing about it. We're not hearing about it. We've got to have some kind of a mass movement and Alex, you're about the only one.
[3:26:47.940 --> 3:26:58.940]  I mean, not the only one, but I know you are the most and one of the most important ones that we can get this mass movement going. We're doing our thing for freedom here in the Republic of Lakota.
[3:26:58.940 --> 3:27:12.940]  But we have to reinstill the idea of responsibility into Americans because you want to become an Indian on a reservation, you have no motive.
[3:27:12.940 --> 3:27:17.940]  And the family farmers, the family ranchers, they're almost extinct now because of the credit crunch.
[3:27:17.940 --> 3:27:30.940]  They have been, they have been groomed, the family farmers, family ranchers, to run their entire operations on this phony credit operation of the United States.
[3:27:30.940 --> 3:27:35.940]  And now they've withdrawn the credit. So the family farmer, family ranchers dead in America.
[3:27:35.940 --> 3:27:36.940]  Russell.
[3:27:36.940 --> 3:27:38.940]  Which means, which means America is dead.
[3:27:38.940 --> 3:27:49.940]  I agree. I mean, my family are farmers and ranchers and they had to go get jobs in the 50s because of the way the government changed everything and took it over.
[3:27:49.940 --> 3:27:53.940]  They all had to work in jobs in town and then work just to not lose their land.
[3:27:53.940 --> 3:28:00.940]  They had to sell off, sell off, sell off more and more. And now with the animal ID, the premises ID, they're written by the big agribusiness.
[3:28:00.940 --> 3:28:10.940]  It openly shuts down farms, ranches, they're almost gone. And once you lose that, we have 90% people are urban and 10% are rural.
[3:28:10.940 --> 3:28:13.940]  But only half of those are 5% of the population is self-sufficient.
[3:28:13.940 --> 3:28:18.940]  And we have globalist documents where they state they wanted to do this and now they've done this.
[3:28:18.940 --> 3:28:21.940]  And I was just down in Mexico a few weeks ago in Yucatan.
[3:28:21.940 --> 3:28:25.940]  And I said, I don't see fishing boats here like I saw last time I was here five years ago.
[3:28:25.940 --> 3:28:31.940]  And they said, no, the government has banned us fishing. Only the big trawlers from Japan and the U.S. can come.
[3:28:31.940 --> 3:28:37.940]  And I went to the village and asked, I said, there's no people here. And they said, no, we're not allowed to fish now.
[3:28:37.940 --> 3:28:40.940]  So see, it's the same thing they did to the Native Americans.
[3:28:40.940 --> 3:28:47.940]  Right. And you take the means of production away from a people and what do you have left?
[3:28:47.940 --> 3:28:50.940]  You have slaves, minimum wage slaves.
[3:28:50.940 --> 3:29:00.940]  Well, then I mentioned now that China has just announced that they're going to start buying treasury bills again.
[3:29:00.940 --> 3:29:03.940]  Treasury bills are secured by the land of America.
[3:29:03.940 --> 3:29:09.940]  Now already China owns 40%. Saudi Arabia owns 20% of the T-bills.
[3:29:09.940 --> 3:29:13.940]  So together they own 60% of the land of America.
[3:29:13.940 --> 3:29:21.940]  Now, however, because America is so broke in running this phony economy, printing this phony money,
[3:29:21.940 --> 3:29:28.940]  is that if they wanted to collect on their T-bills right now, America and the dollar would go bust and broke
[3:29:28.940 --> 3:29:33.940]  and we would have to take a wheelbarrow full just to buy a toothpick.
[3:29:33.940 --> 3:29:35.940]  Russell means stay there. We got a break.
[3:29:35.940 --> 3:29:39.940]  How are they keeping the indigenous Mayans from fishing?
[3:29:39.940 --> 3:29:45.940]  The environment. The big bottom trawlers can come and do it, but the natives, they can't fish.
[3:29:45.940 --> 3:29:48.940]  See, that's the phony environmentalism Obama's bringing him.
[3:29:48.940 --> 3:29:51.940]  We'll get Russell means take on that. Stay with us.
[3:29:51.940 --> 3:29:55.940]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.940 --> 3:30:20.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:26.940 --> 3:30:29.940]  Trigger finger gloves, $5 a pair or $36 a dozen.
[3:30:29.940 --> 3:30:34.940]  Snowshoe binding for $8 or $48 a dozen and so much more.
[3:30:34.940 --> 3:30:38.940]  Even hard to find surplus items all at surplus prices.
[3:30:38.940 --> 3:30:43.940]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable at mainmilitary.com.

[3:31:01.940 --> 3:31:08.940]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:31:08.940 --> 3:31:12.940]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the enemy?
[3:31:12.940 --> 3:31:13.940]  Bin Laden.
[3:31:13.940 --> 3:31:14.940]  He sees his MOs.
[3:31:14.940 --> 3:31:17.940]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:31:17.940 --> 3:31:24.940]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:31:24.940 --> 3:31:31.940]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[3:31:31.940 --> 3:31:35.940]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:35.940 --> 3:31:42.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:31:42.940 --> 3:31:49.940]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[3:33:18.940 --> 3:33:26.940]  We know he's a puppet, he's controlled, but they had invested their image of themselves, their identity, in this person
[3:33:26.940 --> 3:33:31.940]  that was developed and created by the very corporate slave state that's destroying all of our futures
[3:33:31.940 --> 3:33:35.940]  and openly say they want to euthanize and engage in eugenics.
[3:33:35.940 --> 3:33:38.940]  And if you don't think they'll do it, look what they've done to Native Americans and others.
[3:33:38.940 --> 3:33:42.940]  We had a pastor on last week who exposed, and it's even ended up mainstream Canadian press
[3:33:42.940 --> 3:33:48.940]  and years of him fighting that they take the Native American children in Canada and still, they just kill them.
[3:33:48.940 --> 3:33:54.940]  Half the boys they take, the foster care, they take them, they grab them, they use the churches and it's government control
[3:33:54.940 --> 3:33:59.940]  and they just murder them, murder little kids and it's on record and nobody gets in trouble.
[3:33:59.940 --> 3:34:02.940]  Nothing happens, it's sick but they want to do it to everybody.
[3:34:02.940 --> 3:34:07.940]  It's any group, see with Native Americans they could sell people, they were different or they're causing a problem,
[3:34:07.940 --> 3:34:12.940]  they're different from us, let's kill them, but then the killing also happens to those that help do the killing
[3:34:12.940 --> 3:34:14.940]  or their ancestors, that's how this works.
[3:34:14.940 --> 3:34:21.940]  But here's the new shirt and it says on the cover here, it says,
[3:34:21.940 --> 3:34:26.940]  worst president ever and one half of the face is George Bush and on the other half it's Obama.
[3:34:26.940 --> 3:34:32.940]  It says until now, infowars.com and on the back it says don't be a sucker.
[3:34:32.940 --> 3:34:36.940]  And this will explain to everybody and get past the control left, right, paradigm.
[3:34:36.940 --> 3:34:40.940]  We've got some other new Obama shirts that just went up and pre-orders for the Obama deception just began
[3:34:40.940 --> 3:34:42.940]  and it's about getting the information out.
[3:34:42.940 --> 3:34:47.940]  It's also about supporting the show so we can have a platform to support other great activists and humanitarians
[3:34:47.940 --> 3:34:51.940]  and speaking of that, Mr. Means, before we get into other issues and where you think things are going in the future,
[3:34:51.940 --> 3:34:59.940]  tell us about the Lakota Nation, the four and a half or five state area, what has happened, how people get involved.
[3:34:59.940 --> 3:35:05.940]  This will materialize if people join, if people get involved, if people spread the word, if people financially support
[3:35:05.940 --> 3:35:11.940]  and I can't think of a better leader than yourself, you know, going through the situation that you went with
[3:35:11.940 --> 3:35:17.940]  in the 71-day armed takeover of the sacred grounds of wounded knee with the feds, you know, all the things you've been through
[3:35:17.940 --> 3:35:20.940]  as a leader, I'm glad that you're leading the charge on this.
[3:35:20.940 --> 3:35:28.940]  So tell us how the people of not just the United States but the world can be involved in this historic declaration of independence
[3:35:28.940 --> 3:35:31.940]  and pulling out of the fraudulent contract.
[3:35:31.940 --> 3:35:38.940]  This dovetails with 21 states now saying they're going to pull out of the union if martial law or gun confiscation continues.
[3:35:38.940 --> 3:35:41.940]  So, I mean, this is a spirit, isn't it, that's rising?
[3:35:41.940 --> 3:35:48.940]  Oh, it's overdue. It's overdue, even including ourselves.
[3:35:48.940 --> 3:35:57.940]  But what we recognize in the Republic of Lakota is that 90% of the population in the 60 million acres
[3:35:57.940 --> 3:36:06.940]  that makes up this five-state area, part of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Nebraska,
[3:36:06.940 --> 3:36:12.940]  this area is 90% non-Indian, 90% white people.
[3:36:12.940 --> 3:36:16.940]  We understand because for 150 years we've been getting along with them.
[3:36:16.940 --> 3:36:19.940]  We've been living with them. We have to continue that.
[3:36:19.940 --> 3:36:23.940]  So we invite them to join the Republic of Lakota.
[3:36:23.940 --> 3:36:27.940]  It's just, it's not a racial independent movement.
[3:36:27.940 --> 3:36:36.940]  This is a people's independence movement, except we want to do it according to our understanding of individual liberty
[3:36:36.940 --> 3:36:38.940]  and our understanding.
[3:36:38.940 --> 3:36:49.940]  Nevertheless, we want to give state power to neighborhoods so that they have all responsibility for what goes on in their neighborhood.
[3:36:49.940 --> 3:36:51.940]  And I don't care how big the neighborhood is.
[3:36:51.940 --> 3:36:58.940]  And then you have a collection of neighborhoods that make up an area and then the area and then finally you get the nation.
[3:36:58.940 --> 3:37:05.940]  But the point is, your point is, if you have a neighborhood of two houses or 20 houses or 200 houses, fine.
[3:37:05.940 --> 3:37:08.940]  But you run everything in that neighborhood.
[3:37:08.940 --> 3:37:10.940]  What does that mean?
[3:37:10.940 --> 3:37:15.940]  You have to run it by consensus, number one, to ensure individual liberty.
[3:37:15.940 --> 3:37:24.940]  Number two is you have to, you definitely have to bring about law and order.
[3:37:24.940 --> 3:37:26.940]  That's responsibility.
[3:37:26.940 --> 3:37:28.940]  Guess what happens then?
[3:37:28.940 --> 3:37:33.940]  You eliminate the need for police because in your neighborhood you're taking care of it.
[3:37:33.940 --> 3:37:40.940]  You eliminate the need for courts and judges, and best of all, you eliminate the need for lawyers.
[3:37:40.940 --> 3:37:45.940]  Well, that's the system they've had in Switzerland, some of what was founded here in the United States.
[3:37:45.940 --> 3:37:51.940]  And that really is, at least for a lot of the tribes, based on a Native American system.
[3:37:51.940 --> 3:38:00.940]  Yes, that's based upon our control of individual liberty.
[3:38:00.940 --> 3:38:01.940]  Let me ask you a question.
[3:38:01.940 --> 3:38:09.940]  What would you do if, let's say, you're a neighborhood or what you call a village of, say, 400 houses and somebody commits a murder?
[3:38:09.940 --> 3:38:15.940]  Well, those 400 houses would take care of that.
[3:38:15.940 --> 3:38:19.940]  Not the nation, not the larger area.
[3:38:19.940 --> 3:38:27.940]  Those 400 houses, they would have already determined their justice system according to them.
[3:38:27.940 --> 3:38:30.940]  You're a mini-state within a state.
[3:38:30.940 --> 3:38:38.940]  And you have, it's like Posse Comitatus laws that used to be prevalent in this United States of America.
[3:38:38.940 --> 3:38:45.940]  Well, that's how small towns were in the United States was they would have their court, their system, and they would deal out justice.
[3:38:45.940 --> 3:38:57.940]  Well, because Americans have become the new Indians of the 21st century and they've become actually reservation Indians because they've abdicated their responsibility.
[3:38:57.940 --> 3:39:04.940]  They've allowed the Congress of the United States of America to eradicate Posse Comitatus laws.
[3:39:04.940 --> 3:39:19.940]  And listen, these two bedrock avenues of individual liberty is one, the sheriff of every county at one time was the top law official in the nation because they were elected.
[3:39:19.940 --> 3:39:29.940]  And then those sheriffs, any police agency anywhere from any place had to get permission of the sheriff to come in that county.
[3:39:29.940 --> 3:39:33.940]  That was just eradicated in the last three years by Congress.
[3:39:33.940 --> 3:39:46.940]  The other thing is with the corporate laws, we have to get rid of the rights of corporations.
[3:39:46.940 --> 3:39:57.940]  It's abominable and the height of stupidity to give a corporation a piece of paper the same rights that we have as individuals, but none of the penalties.
[3:39:57.940 --> 3:40:09.940]  Well, Russell, this is what we need. We need to get back to imagine if people got into self-sufficiency would create an incredible economy if every little neighborhood together had their own wind power,
[3:40:09.940 --> 3:40:15.940]  their own solar panels put in their own septic tanks, their own systems like the Amish.
[3:40:15.940 --> 3:40:25.940]  Take the Amish, there's almost 300,000 of them in Illinois. They've done a study over 200,000 of them, no autism, much lower crime rate, in fact no crime to speak of.
[3:40:25.940 --> 3:40:31.940]  I mean, they live in harmony because they're living in a natural way and the state's coming in and kidnapping their kids now.
[3:40:31.940 --> 3:40:37.940]  The state had left the Amish alone, now they're treating them like Native Americans in the 1870s.
[3:40:37.940 --> 3:40:46.940]  So we, to defend ourselves, we need to go back to being our own little communities and if you don't like the neighborhood, the village you're in, you go find another one you like to move to.
[3:40:46.940 --> 3:40:55.940]  Exactly, exactly. And that's the epitome of individual freedom is local control.
[3:40:55.940 --> 3:41:01.940]  You know, the jury system used to be the last vestige against state power.
[3:41:01.940 --> 3:41:10.940]  When you had jury nullification, you could nullify an existing law if you felt the jury felt it didn't apply to that individual case.
[3:41:10.940 --> 3:41:16.940]  So any law could be nullified by 12 citizens, responsible citizens.
[3:41:16.940 --> 3:41:35.940]  But we've got to re-institute, if we're going to be a free people, we have to re-institute in the minds of our people that the idea of responsibility is your responsibility to find out about who really is running this country, who really is Obama.
[3:41:35.940 --> 3:41:44.940]  Where did he come from and why? Why did he move from being a Harvard law graduate editor of the Harvard Law Review?
[3:41:44.940 --> 3:41:53.940]  He had his pick of any legal firm he could go to in New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C.
[3:41:53.940 --> 3:41:57.940]  He could have been a clerk for his Supreme Court Justice, but what did he do?
[3:41:57.940 --> 3:42:06.940]  He goes to a city he never lived in, never even visited Chicago to work among the poor allegedly as a lawyer.
[3:42:06.940 --> 3:42:12.940]  And where did they put him? They put him in the most connected church in the black community.
[3:42:12.940 --> 3:42:21.940]  Also, they gave him a political mentor, the local black political boss of the South Side of Chicago.
[3:42:21.940 --> 3:42:24.940]  And there you have his path right to the White House.
[3:42:24.940 --> 3:42:29.940]  In fact, Russell, I mean, there were a lot of cases because I've read a lot of U.S. history.
[3:42:29.940 --> 3:42:44.940]  I mean, that was classic that as Western expansion was taking place, that's how they would defeat the Native Americans is they would go pay off some of the bad chiefs to get them to tell their people to stand down.
[3:42:44.940 --> 3:42:54.940]  And so people can't get that there's a guy who's, you know, part black that somehow, you know, he, you know, isn't a sellout to the New World Order.
[3:42:54.940 --> 3:42:58.940]  I mean, it's asinine. I mean, look, it's just on its face.
[3:42:58.940 --> 3:43:01.940]  And then now they're going to continue the secret arrest.
[3:43:01.940 --> 3:43:04.940]  They're going to continue another thing, 23 months in Iraq.
[3:43:04.940 --> 3:43:10.940]  It was six, then 16, now 23, 30,000 more trips up to 60 in Afghanistan, about 90,000.
[3:43:10.940 --> 3:43:14.940]  He's talking about going into Iran, going into Pakistan.
[3:43:14.940 --> 3:43:21.940]  They're building FEMA camps and it's in the news and he wants to have a giant 18 to 24 compulsory service in a new domestic army.
[3:43:21.940 --> 3:43:25.940]  No law, the Pentagon just announced it as a new order.
[3:43:25.940 --> 3:43:29.940]  And they're building a camp outside Austin, Russell.
[3:43:29.940 --> 3:43:31.940]  I mean, this is really happening.
[3:43:31.940 --> 3:43:39.940]  Exactly. And it's also, they've gotten rid of the laws protecting us against the National Army.
[3:43:39.940 --> 3:43:49.940]  Now they, the Department of Defense has jurisdiction, thanks to Homeland Security, has jurisdiction in any legal jurisdiction in the United States of America.
[3:43:49.940 --> 3:43:53.940]  That never before was possible, but now it is.
[3:43:53.940 --> 3:43:58.940]  The army can come in for any reason before it was illegal.
[3:43:58.940 --> 3:44:01.940]  Well, that's right. First, it was 4,000 trips, then 20,000 trips.
[3:44:01.940 --> 3:44:07.940]  Now they're saying, ah, 50,000 trips, Northcom, and the governors are no longer over the National Guard.
[3:44:07.940 --> 3:44:12.940]  And the Army Times states, we are preparing to engage the American people.
[3:44:12.940 --> 3:44:18.940]  Is that not high treason and the government breaking its treaty through the Constitution and Bill of Rights with the people?
[3:44:18.940 --> 3:44:21.940]  Because that's a treaty with those colonies. It's the same thing.
[3:44:21.940 --> 3:44:28.940]  They've completely broken the treaty, admitted it themselves, and are saying, according to Time Magazine in this New World Order article,
[3:44:28.940 --> 3:44:35.940]  the title is New World Order, zoom in on this folks, it says a foreign global bank will rule the United States now.
[3:44:35.940 --> 3:44:38.940]  I mean, it's incredible.
[3:44:38.940 --> 3:44:43.940]  That was institutionalized in 1913, the bank's ruling America.
[3:44:43.940 --> 3:44:54.940]  And we got to remember, when we went, and I mentioned this earlier, that we were producing productive country up until the end of the 50s, 1950s,
[3:44:54.940 --> 3:45:03.940]  and then they started the switcheroo to making us consumers and emptying out all the production of America.
[3:45:03.940 --> 3:45:06.940]  They've emptied that out, and it took them less than 25 years.
[3:45:06.940 --> 3:45:10.940]  By the mid-80s, we were a consumer nation.
[3:45:10.940 --> 3:45:17.940]  That's why Bush could say, go shopping, because that's what this country runs on now, consumerism.
[3:45:17.940 --> 3:45:21.940]  Because they want you dependent on them, just like the Native Americans.
[3:45:21.940 --> 3:45:25.940]  And I know you're the expert on this, but I'm telling the listeners, I'd like you to elaborate.
[3:45:25.940 --> 3:45:29.940]  And then tell folks the phone number and websites, I want to put his website up on screen, guys,
[3:45:29.940 --> 3:45:36.940]  so that people can join and get involved or support or learn more, that they would put people in these areas,
[3:45:36.940 --> 3:45:43.940]  they would control them, and you had to then, like welfare, get your food in blankets from the corrupt Indian agents
[3:45:43.940 --> 3:45:49.940]  who would then make the natives for even food when they're starving in the winter, hook her out there, women, everything.
[3:45:49.940 --> 3:45:52.940]  I mean, it's just, it's the same thing today.
[3:45:52.940 --> 3:45:54.940]  It is exactly the same thing.
[3:45:54.940 --> 3:46:02.940]  The Indian policies of America, the American Indian policies, have more first into their foreign policies,
[3:46:02.940 --> 3:46:05.940]  and now it's on their domestic policies.
[3:46:05.940 --> 3:46:08.940]  So it's just not in the ghettos and the barrios.
[3:46:08.940 --> 3:46:10.940]  It's in middle America.
[3:46:10.940 --> 3:46:13.940]  I mean, hello, look at the housing crisis.
[3:46:13.940 --> 3:46:19.940]  That wiped out the middle class, and now you're going to become poppers,
[3:46:19.940 --> 3:46:27.940]  and you're going to have to depend on the federal government for them to dole out your food, for them to dole out.
[3:46:27.940 --> 3:46:35.940]  And then all these new diseases that keep coming, how come they're related to things we eat?
[3:46:35.940 --> 3:46:37.940]  Figure that out.
[3:46:37.940 --> 3:46:39.940]  Just figure that out.
[3:46:39.940 --> 3:46:44.940]  But we've got to be responsible, and we're all responsible for our own freedom.
[3:46:44.940 --> 3:46:48.940]  Not how and what we eat, but our freedom comes first.
[3:46:48.940 --> 3:46:50.940]  Our freedom comes before eating.
[3:46:50.940 --> 3:46:52.940]  Our freedom comes before work.
[3:46:52.940 --> 3:46:56.940]  Our freedom is the most important part of life.
[3:46:56.940 --> 3:47:02.940]  And if you don't know that, then you are a sheeple.
[3:47:02.940 --> 3:47:04.940]  Because everything flows out of liberty.
[3:47:04.940 --> 3:47:06.940]  If you don't have the freedom, the liberty, it's over.
[3:47:06.940 --> 3:47:10.940]  But, you know, a lot of folks I have on claim, you know, the core is our group.
[3:47:10.940 --> 3:47:12.940]  You know, the core models would happen to us.
[3:47:12.940 --> 3:47:15.940]  You know, people tend to centralize things around themselves.
[3:47:15.940 --> 3:47:17.940]  But I've studied broad history.
[3:47:17.940 --> 3:47:23.940]  And when you say that so much of the modern world system is based on the experience of the enslavement
[3:47:23.940 --> 3:47:26.940]  and extermination of 90-plus percent of Native Americans, it's true.
[3:47:26.940 --> 3:47:28.940]  I've read the British reports.
[3:47:28.940 --> 3:47:37.940]  I read Hitler's speeches and Mein Kampf and his concentration camps and everything he did, what he did in Russia.
[3:47:37.940 --> 3:47:44.940]  It was all modeled after what was done to the natives, and that's been used all over the world.
[3:47:44.940 --> 3:47:48.940]  And it really is the model. And so that's what we're black folks saying.
[3:47:48.940 --> 3:47:50.940]  You can't have a man in the house.
[3:47:50.940 --> 3:47:54.940]  The government's going to give you money for your home to put them in an inner city so they can then ship in drugs,
[3:47:54.940 --> 3:47:57.940]  put them in prison, knowing the family would break down.
[3:47:57.940 --> 3:48:02.940]  I've got slave manuals written in the time of Julius Caesar when they would grab Germanic slaves
[3:48:02.940 --> 3:48:07.940]  of how they broke up the family, separated the men, put them on reservations to break them down.
[3:48:07.940 --> 3:48:10.940]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[3:48:10.940 --> 3:48:19.940]  One of the hardest things about, and the best things about liberty and being free is you become family-oriented.
[3:48:19.940 --> 3:48:25.940]  Now, I'm not talking about blood family. I'm talking about, now, once we become adults, we can choose our own family.
[3:48:25.940 --> 3:48:31.940]  You know, when we're born, we're not born into our family of choice.
[3:48:31.940 --> 3:48:34.940]  But when you're being free, you can choose your families.
[3:48:34.940 --> 3:48:42.940]  And if you look at Europe today, after all their tumultuous history, but they haven't emptied out their countries,
[3:48:42.940 --> 3:48:48.940]  they still make their own shoes, their own clothes, grow their own crops, make their own steel,
[3:48:48.940 --> 3:48:54.940]  and have all of the things necessary for a strong, vibrant country by itself,
[3:48:54.940 --> 3:48:59.940]  let alone being joining together in the European Union.
[3:48:59.940 --> 3:49:02.940]  But America emptied out.
[3:49:02.940 --> 3:49:06.940]  That is not freedom, and that's not responsibility.
[3:49:06.940 --> 3:49:11.940]  Responsibility and freedom are one and the same.
[3:49:11.940 --> 3:49:17.940]  So if you're welcome to the Republic of Lakota, if you're responsible.
[3:49:17.940 --> 3:49:22.940]  Absolutely. Tell folks the best website to visit and a phone number.
[3:49:22.940 --> 3:49:30.940]  Of course, the republicoflakota.com and russelmeansfreedom.com.
[3:49:30.940 --> 3:49:33.940]  We've got that up on screen right now.
[3:49:33.940 --> 3:49:35.940]  Thank you.
[3:49:35.940 --> 3:49:45.940]  The phone number for the Republic of Lakota, 605-867-1111.
[3:49:45.940 --> 3:49:50.940]  So that's 605-867-1111?
[3:49:50.940 --> 3:49:51.940]  Correct.
[3:49:51.940 --> 3:49:54.940]  605-867-1111.
[3:49:54.940 --> 3:50:01.940]  And if folks want to financially support or support by spreading the word, they can go to russelmeansfreedom.
[3:50:01.940 --> 3:50:05.940]  Again, give that website out one more time. We're going to put it up on screen.
[3:50:05.940 --> 3:50:13.940]  russelmeansfreedom.com and republicoflakota.com.
[3:50:13.940 --> 3:50:18.940]  Well, it's so important that we support every movement for independence and liberty.
[3:50:18.940 --> 3:50:24.940]  The globalists want one huge world with every nation in their own words, dependent, broken down, deindustrialized,
[3:50:24.940 --> 3:50:28.940]  so the globalists can consolidate power. It's in their own IMF and World Bank documents.
[3:50:28.940 --> 3:50:31.940]  We must do what you're doing and go in the opposite direction.
[3:50:31.940 --> 3:50:36.940]  It is our only salvation for survival and we've got to do it now.
[3:50:36.940 --> 3:50:43.940]  Russell, I'm going to skip this break as well for the TV viewers and the infowars.com audio listeners for the MNFM Dial.
[3:50:43.940 --> 3:50:48.940]  Shortwave and the satellite listeners will be back in three short minutes.
[3:50:48.940 --> 3:50:52.940]  Russell, we've got to have you on for a couple hours, coming up in the next month or two, so we can take some phone calls
[3:50:52.940 --> 3:50:58.940]  and also get more of your great wisdom as it's just really great to have you on.
[3:50:58.940 --> 3:51:01.940]  I totally agree with everything you're saying and I want to support you in any way I can.
[3:51:01.940 --> 3:51:02.940]  I know my listeners do as well.
[3:51:02.940 --> 3:51:04.940]  With food prices soaring to all time.
[3:51:04.940 --> 3:51:08.940]  John, we're going to skip this break. Okay, great. We're skipping this one too.
[3:51:08.940 --> 3:51:13.940]  Russell, when we come back to the full audience and we've got a lot of folks listening and watching right now as well,
[3:51:13.940 --> 3:51:19.940]  what are some of the final points you think are most important to make to the viewers and listeners?
[3:51:19.940 --> 3:51:28.940]  Well, as we tell, all the people who contact us and they want to move to the Republic of Lakota and you're free.
[3:51:28.940 --> 3:51:30.940]  You can buy your own land.
[3:51:30.940 --> 3:51:37.940]  We even have people who are connected with the real estate.
[3:51:37.940 --> 3:51:41.940]  We have to work towards freedom because we're non-threatening.
[3:51:41.940 --> 3:51:48.940]  We're non-militant and we don't believe in any kind of violence whatsoever.
[3:51:48.940 --> 3:51:51.940]  We're willing to work with the existing system.
[3:51:51.940 --> 3:51:57.940]  We've already established our own school, a treaty school, just one, but it's going to grow.
[3:51:57.940 --> 3:51:59.940]  Everything is going to grow.
[3:51:59.940 --> 3:52:14.940]  We have a nucleus of people who have moved here and have bought land and other people are in the process of buying land and moving here.
[3:52:14.940 --> 3:52:19.940]  What we're going to do is work in our own communities to be self-sufficient.
[3:52:19.940 --> 3:52:30.940]  We live in the Saudi Arabia of wind energy and the sun shines on the northern plains over 300 days of the year.
[3:52:30.940 --> 3:52:32.940]  So we have that power.
[3:52:32.940 --> 3:52:38.940]  We also have on our land, and it's reachable, is the geothermal water.
[3:52:38.940 --> 3:52:48.940]  So we can hot house, we can fish farm and we can hot house vegetables all year long because of the sun and that possibility.
[3:52:48.940 --> 3:52:50.940]  Nothing's done without action.
[3:52:50.940 --> 3:52:52.940]  I love these armchair quarterbacks.
[3:52:52.940 --> 3:52:54.940]  It won't work. It'll never happen.
[3:52:54.940 --> 3:52:57.940]  It'll never work and happen if people don't believe it and take action.
[3:52:57.940 --> 3:53:05.940]  As this crisis comes, we need to be there with the solutions so people have an escape valve.
[3:53:05.940 --> 3:53:10.940]  I know you've built things and done things and been successful in life, so you know the power of humanity.
[3:53:10.940 --> 3:53:12.940]  I've been somewhat successful in my life.
[3:53:12.940 --> 3:53:21.940]  That's why I want others out there to have respect for themselves and realize that to dream is destiny and that action is victory.
[3:53:21.940 --> 3:53:30.940]  Even if you just move on the country with your friends and family somewhere else, the point is get off the grid, get self-sufficient,
[3:53:30.940 --> 3:53:37.940]  join together because true wealth is your friends, your family, your neighbors, your community and the willingness to stand together and to fight
[3:53:37.940 --> 3:53:39.940]  because we're going into great time of tribulation.
[3:53:39.940 --> 3:53:47.940]  We're going to come back to the full audience, Russell, and I want to ask you one more question about Obama to a message to the suckers out there
[3:53:47.940 --> 3:53:52.940]  because it's so painful to see them being suckered and to see them falling to this deception.
[3:53:52.940 --> 3:53:58.940]  So I want to talk about that in closing and also give out the website and phone number one more time.
[3:53:58.940 --> 3:54:03.940]  In fact, guys, make sure let's get his website address up on screen, not just the website itself. Here we go.
[3:54:03.940 --> 3:54:09.940]  Okay, folks, it is the final segment with Russell Means, the final segment of the show.
[3:54:09.940 --> 3:54:12.940]  I had a state representative with a declaring sovereignty in Missouri on today.
[3:54:12.940 --> 3:54:23.940]  I had Mark Dice of the Resistance Manifesto on and, of course, we have Russell Means, just an amazing activist for liberty and freedom.
[3:54:23.940 --> 3:54:26.940]  He's been mischaracterizing the press quite a bit, but that tells you he's a good guy.
[3:54:26.940 --> 3:54:28.940]  You look at what he actually stands for.
[3:54:28.940 --> 3:54:32.940]  I know that he's a guy from my own heart and we really appreciate him.
[3:54:32.940 --> 3:54:40.940]  I want to get him on about eugenics and the overall New World Order and what it's like to come from a group that's been so intensely targeted by this.
[3:54:40.940 --> 3:54:50.940]  But in closing, a message to the Obama people who took their hatred of Bush that was legitimate and transmuted it into love for Obama,
[3:54:50.940 --> 3:54:56.940]  not knowing it's the same manager crew behind it, they feel like they're at the table now.
[3:54:56.940 --> 3:54:58.940]  They feel like they've had a great victory.
[3:54:58.940 --> 3:55:02.940]  They don't know they've just been sold a bunch of glass beads and want them for New York.
[3:55:02.940 --> 3:55:12.940]  They don't understand that this is a cold-blooded setup, but we have studied this and looked at this and lived this so we know they haven't discovered that yet.
[3:55:12.940 --> 3:55:14.940]  In closing, what do you say to them?
[3:55:14.940 --> 3:55:21.940]  Well, I want to be facetious, actually, and just say goodbye.
[3:55:21.940 --> 3:55:36.940]  But the sheeple, the sheeple that our Obamaites are, however you're going to, they've been Obama-tized, those people, I have found in my visit to Texas.
[3:55:36.940 --> 3:55:48.940]  And among my own people here on the reservation and into the people who are considered conservative Republicans in the state of South Dakota,
[3:55:48.940 --> 3:55:53.940]  no one's listening. No one wants to take responsibility.
[3:55:53.940 --> 3:55:56.940]  And that's what's happened in this country.
[3:55:56.940 --> 3:56:02.940]  Thomas Jefferson said it best, you know, to be free, you have to be responsible.
[3:56:02.940 --> 3:56:05.940]  It was hand-in-hand. I can't say it enough.
[3:56:05.940 --> 3:56:17.940]  And so I'm very skeptical in saying anything to the people who are the sheeple who have been Obama-tized because that's their new savior.
[3:56:17.940 --> 3:56:23.940]  They cannot penetrate their defenses because they refuse to hear it.
[3:56:23.940 --> 3:56:33.940]  I talked common sense and I talked spirituality and I talked facts and figures with these people down in Texas who are Obama-tized,
[3:56:33.940 --> 3:56:39.940]  and they wouldn't hear a thing, and they felt sorry for me.
[3:56:39.940 --> 3:56:43.940]  They felt sorry for me.
[3:56:43.940 --> 3:56:51.940]  They told me, you're going to see in 18 months. What we all don't understand here in America is that it's over.
[3:56:51.940 --> 3:56:58.940]  And if the United States of America just came out and said, well, it's over, well, there'd be a rising of the people.
[3:56:58.940 --> 3:57:09.940]  They don't want that. So they're manufacturing, they're printing this money so that they can let you down easy, let you down easily.
[3:57:09.940 --> 3:57:20.940]  Those people over there lost their homes. And as they let you down easy, and your wages go down, and your livelihood goes down,
[3:57:20.940 --> 3:57:30.940]  and your trips become shorter, and you don't buy as much until the fact is you're going to look around one day.
[3:57:30.940 --> 3:57:34.940]  But they're already committed to him, so they won't even admit they were wrong.
[3:57:34.940 --> 3:57:39.940]  Just like people under Stalin or Hitler still wouldn't admit they were conned and wrong because they've invested in it.
[3:57:39.940 --> 3:57:44.940]  They're going to have right-wing groups attacking. They're going to have Nazis protesting to make him look good.
[3:57:44.940 --> 3:57:46.940]  They're going to play a lot of games.
[3:57:46.940 --> 3:57:53.940]  Oh, definitely. They are masters at manipulation. It's an Orwellian reality.
[3:57:53.940 --> 3:58:05.940]  But always remember this, and this is always wrong, too. It only takes 2% of a people to foment a successful revolution.
[3:58:05.940 --> 3:58:12.940]  And we want a revolution to return one revolution back to freedom of the individual.
[3:58:12.940 --> 3:58:24.940]  All right, Russell, we crashed your website, so we want to give that phone number out again, 605-867-1111, 605-867-1111.
[3:58:24.940 --> 3:58:28.940]  Don't go. I want to do a few minutes and overdrive on the web to say bye to you here properly.
[3:58:28.940 --> 3:58:36.940]  For the audience, though, retransmission, we're going to continue into overdrive a few minutes, and then we're going to retransmission at infowars.com.
[3:58:36.940 --> 3:58:39.940]  So please stay with us. I want to say bye to the Genesis Network and all those listeners.
[3:58:39.940 --> 3:58:51.940]  Here we go with Russell Mainz. Stay with us.
[3:58:51.940 --> 3:58:58.940]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[3:58:58.940 --> 3:59:04.940]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[3:59:04.940 --> 3:59:08.940]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[3:59:08.940 --> 3:59:10.940]  Back in one minute, Russell.
[3:59:38.940 --> 3:59:59.940]  Okay, Russell, you got cut off by the music there at the end. We have a substantive audience watching live at prisonplanet.tv and listening over the streams.
[3:59:59.940 --> 4:00:04.940]  And frankly, what you've been saying, I think I'm going to take a little bit of a clip of it and put it in a little Obama thing I'm working on.
[4:00:04.940 --> 4:00:11.940]  So I'd like you to repeat that key thing you were saying there at the end that the end of the show cuts you off on police.
[4:00:11.940 --> 4:00:14.940]  Wait a minute. What was it?
[4:00:14.940 --> 4:00:19.940]  That was so ad hoc.
[4:00:19.940 --> 4:00:30.940]  Well, I mean, it'll pop in your head a minute. The point is, they think you're a right-wing extremist, or they think I am.
[4:00:30.940 --> 4:00:37.940]  Or they think they think we're secretly bush people. I've talked to them that we're trying to horn in on their fun.
[4:00:37.940 --> 4:00:41.940]  And that's what a con artist does. They make them feel like they're part of it.
[4:00:41.940 --> 4:00:45.940]  And I've had friends and family that have signed on to Ponzi schemes before.
[4:00:45.940 --> 4:00:50.940]  And I've said, look, it's a scam. Don't do it. And they go, oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
[4:00:50.940 --> 4:00:53.940]  You're just, you're just, you know, upset that I've got a good deal going.
[4:00:53.940 --> 4:01:00.940]  And I'm like, no, I've experienced this. This is a scam. And they just can't believe it's happening to him.
[4:01:00.940 --> 4:01:06.940]  And he's, he is total new world order. And like you said, they're like comparing him to Lincoln and George Washington.
[4:01:06.940 --> 4:01:10.940]  And really putting their full power behind it.
[4:01:10.940 --> 4:01:18.940]  I can say it in another way. I don't know. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I knew it was heartfelt.
[4:01:18.940 --> 4:01:23.940]  Sure. No, I understand. I mean, I mean, well, just speak from the heart on, I'm trying to reach out to these people.
[4:01:23.940 --> 4:01:27.940]  I know they're being conned. Look at what he's already done.
[4:01:27.940 --> 4:01:39.940]  Okay. You know, the biggest thing about Obama and the obaminization of the people is they are looking for a savior.
[4:01:39.940 --> 4:01:50.940]  But I caution everyone to realize what Einstein said. Einstein said, if you try his definition of insanity,
[4:01:50.940 --> 4:02:00.940]  is if you can continually try the same thing over and over and over again, but you expect different results.
[4:02:00.940 --> 4:02:04.940]  Every time you try something over again, you expect different results.
[4:02:04.940 --> 4:02:12.940]  That's the demo publicans. That's what I call the Democrats and the Republican demo public and it's not working.
[4:02:12.940 --> 4:02:20.940]  Our individual liberty has been stripped. And if you don't understand that, you've got to grab a hope.
[4:02:20.940 --> 4:02:29.940]  Hope is a false word because it keeps you hoping and you're hoping for the next president.
[4:02:29.940 --> 4:02:35.940]  You're hoping for another Obama. You're hoping for another Roosevelt. You're hoping for another Lincoln.
[4:02:35.940 --> 4:02:43.940]  And then they give you a guy that is supposed to embody Lincoln, Roosevelt and Obama.
[4:02:43.940 --> 4:02:49.940]  And he's the answer to everything. And all he's doing is printing phony money.
[4:02:49.940 --> 4:02:55.940]  Well, he's not doing it, but the people who control him are doing it. You've got to take a look at America.
[4:02:55.940 --> 4:03:01.940]  Russell, have you noticed that every time some old woman's begging saying, I'm homeless now, I need help.
[4:03:01.940 --> 4:03:08.940]  I just want a small place with a bathroom. He'll come over and say, oh, honey, I'm sorry, but hey, everybody's, everybody's, you know, it's rough.
[4:03:08.940 --> 4:03:15.940]  Everybody, a lot of people have your problem. And he says, get ready for sacrifice so the bankers can take everything over.
[4:03:15.940 --> 4:03:21.940]  I mean, this is so dark and so evil. We have so many resources and so much.
[4:03:21.940 --> 4:03:27.940]  And then he knows he's a puppet and he knows he's betraying him. Let me ask you this final question.
[4:03:27.940 --> 4:03:31.940]  We'll plug the number in the website again for folks that missed it and then let you go, sir.
[4:03:31.940 --> 4:03:34.940]  And I want to invite you in studio anytime you're in Texas here.
[4:03:34.940 --> 4:03:40.940]  And if you're nearby, we'll get you a hotel room and pay your way to get here. Maybe that'd be fun to do.
[4:03:40.940 --> 4:03:49.940]  But my whole point is this. What is going to happen in two, three, four years when what you said earlier, they're looking around,
[4:03:49.940 --> 4:03:58.940]  they're realizing they were conned. What is going to happen when they realize that they were bamboozled?
[4:03:58.940 --> 4:04:12.940]  The mass psychology that they've perfected is that, see, they can't tell you that it's all over with now because we would rise up as a people for our freedoms.
[4:04:12.940 --> 4:04:24.940]  They're going to let you down easy just like they did to the Indians. They let you down easy and teach you how to be poor and how to accept being poor and poorer and poorer.
[4:04:24.940 --> 4:04:36.940]  And pretty soon you're going to be dependent on the government giving you food, on the government providing you jobs, if their jobs are just few and few, few, few.
[4:04:36.940 --> 4:04:45.940]  That's dependency. It's called colonialism. It's called Indian reservations, but America is the reservation.
[4:04:45.940 --> 4:04:53.940]  That's why they're letting and they're printing all this phony money. Where do you think they're getting this money? We're tapped out. It has no value.
[4:04:53.940 --> 4:04:59.940]  They just keep printing it because they have to let you down easy. Pretty soon it's going to collapse.
[4:04:59.940 --> 4:05:16.940]  Well, in the bill, in the stimulus bill they've passed and is now in joint committee about to be fully passed, it actually says that old people will have health care ration because it's natural for them to go blind.
[4:05:16.940 --> 4:05:21.940]  I have it in Bloomberg. I have the bill. I couldn't believe it when I saw it in Bloomberg two days ago and I went and looked it up.
[4:05:21.940 --> 4:05:31.940]  It actually says that they're not going to give people health care. See, that's what their socialism is and then they'll have the young against the old and the people that have the government jobs.
[4:05:31.940 --> 4:05:39.940]  They're going to defend it and feel like they're part of the winners just like the Indians they had, the Native Americans who sold out, who would be over the other Indians.
[4:05:39.940 --> 4:05:47.940]  I mean, this is a psychology or the house black slave or in Rome they had the house slaves.
[4:05:47.940 --> 4:05:56.940]  Well, you've already got a health policy based upon how the Indian health policy was it was developed.
[4:05:56.940 --> 4:06:07.940]  I'm telling you Indian policy and I'm saying over it is now on the backs of Americans. So yes, you're going to have health care, but it is not going to be very good.
[4:06:07.940 --> 4:06:17.940]  And that's that's just going to be a fact of life. They're going to give you an aspirin when you come in with a heart seizure. It happens to us. It's going to happen to you.
[4:06:17.940 --> 4:06:24.940]  Well, they don't just do that. George Bush before he went and signed the treaty for the one child policy in China for Nixon.
[4:06:24.940 --> 4:06:31.940]  He ran the sterilization of Native Americans in the 70s and they sterilized what upwards of 40% the numbers I've seen.
[4:06:31.940 --> 4:06:33.940]  I didn't believe it and looked up the documents. It was true.
[4:06:33.940 --> 4:06:37.940]  So you're not just going to get bad health care. You're going to get eugenics, aren't you?
[4:06:37.940 --> 4:06:44.940]  Definitely. And this was the whole purpose of classifying our blood quantum.
[4:06:44.940 --> 4:06:54.940]  And that classifies it one eighth or one and they can they can eliminate parts of your blood by stroke of the pen.
[4:06:54.940 --> 4:07:10.940]  If your father is from a different area or your mother is from a different area, they won't count her blood and they will mark you down as one fourth this or one eighth that or three sixteenths that 24, 6, 30 seconds.
[4:07:10.940 --> 4:07:23.940]  I kid you not. And that is how eugenics are used to control populations. And why aren't we we're at zero less than zero population growth.
[4:07:23.940 --> 4:07:29.940]  How long until Native Americans are extinct?
[4:07:29.940 --> 4:07:32.940]  Well, current trends.
[4:07:32.940 --> 4:07:52.940]  There's there's two things. If you don't want to be poor and you want to earn a living, you leave and you go out and you intermarry and all of a sudden you've disappeared into the mosaic that is America.
[4:07:52.940 --> 4:08:03.940]  All right, but it's in America that's controlled, just like the Indian reservations count down on you. The day is here. It's not coming.
[4:08:03.940 --> 4:08:11.940]  The day is here that you are the new Indian of America. It's fact. Look around you.
[4:08:11.940 --> 4:08:25.940]  Look around you. Your quality of life is deteriorating. Nobody's come up with a study yet on how precipitous that decline is since the housing bubble burst.
[4:08:25.940 --> 4:08:31.940]  But we've had some other bubbles burst up leading to that.
[4:08:31.940 --> 4:08:38.940]  So it's a collective effort. The family farmer and family rancher. They're on the front lines. They can tell you.
[4:08:38.940 --> 4:08:42.940]  They're on the front lines of being obliterated.
[4:08:42.940 --> 4:08:48.940]  Wow. Well, Russell means I want to get you back up in the near future and we really appreciate you joining us.
[4:08:48.940 --> 4:08:58.940]  The phone number of folks to call to get involved or support you is 605-867-1111-605-867-1111.
[4:08:58.940 --> 4:09:11.940]  And Russellmeansfreedom.com. The site is back up, I see. And folks can certainly go visit that. And we salute you and wish you a successful mission and all of this.
[4:09:11.940 --> 4:09:13.940]  And we look forward to speaking to you again in the near future.
[4:09:13.940 --> 4:09:15.940]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[4:09:15.940 --> 4:09:17.940]  Thank you. Take care.
[4:09:17.940 --> 4:09:28.940]  Okay, folks. There goes Russell Means. That's it. We're going back into retransmission right now from the first hour of the show right as the state rep joins us coming up in about 10 minutes.
[4:09:28.940 --> 4:09:36.940]  And I'll be back tomorrow live 11 to 3 and back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. What an amazing broadcast today. Good job with the crew and all you the listeners for your support.
[4:09:36.940 --> 4:09:48.940]  Thank you.
[4:10:06.940 --> 4:10:12.940]  Thank you.
