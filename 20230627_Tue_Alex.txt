[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000]  It's Tuesday, June 27th, 2023, and I am still live on InfoWars.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  It's Tuesday, June 27th, 2023, and I am still in Florida, broadcasting to the amazing studios of the River Church here with the great Rodney Howard Brown.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000]  Because I'm not coming home to Austin tomorrow or this week, I have decided to go to Omaha, Nebraska.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  But I'll be broadcasting tomorrow, here live, on an airplane.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  And I'll be broadcasting right through Sunday.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  You won't miss a show. It's all the breaking news.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  But my wife's father is going through heart failure, and he could die.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  And I don't want to be dramatic, but I was going to be with my wife for that.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  And our youngest child.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  And so please pray for John Wolfe.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]  We know the power of God. He's a great guy, a Christian man.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  And he's had a pacemaker for five years, but hadn't been in for a checkup in a year.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]  And he finally went in for one, and he had conjectured heart failure.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  He was really, really sick and having trouble walking.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  And the pacemaker, once they finally read it, said he'd been having a lot of serious heart problems last year.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  And so he's been in and out, and there have been some times where he wasn't fully conscious,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  and didn't want to see visitors and things.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  So it's just a serious situation. A lot of other stuff going on health-wise.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  One of his lungs is completely full of fluid from the heart failure.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  And so we could lose him, so please pray for him.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  But I will be back in studio starting next Monday.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  That said, though, I'm going to be doing a very powerful broadcast there as well from Omaha, Nebraska.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  While my wife's in the hospital with him, and I'll be visiting him at night.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  Wow, we have an incredible broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  To say that everything we talked about has unfortunately now happened is an understatement.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  We are witnessing a corporate world government takeover, an annihilation of our sovereignty,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  a pedophilic, satanic agenda out in the open.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  But we're also seeing mainline talk show hosts and top hosts on Fox, not just Trigger Carlson,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  come right out against the New World Order and say our government's been hijacked by globalist forces.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  They're running giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  They've dissolved the borders. COVID-19 was a fraud.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  They knew the shots were hurting people.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  The mask hurt the children, didn't help you.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]  Everything is coming out, and so that's a very, very positive situation.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  And now last week, and this week, we have FBI whistleblowers, senior-level people coming out and saying,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  we knew about Hunter Biden, we knew the laptop was real three-plus years ago,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  and we were ready to SWAT team him, and it was killed by the Justice Department.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  It was stopped by the Justice Department.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  Trump never got control of the Justice Department.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  At the top, the people at mid-level and even high-level, but not the highest levels, did their jobs.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  So we've got that breaking news with Kev McCarthy saying House will start impeachment inquiries against Merrick Garland in July 6th
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]  over IRS whistleblower evidence regarding Hunter Biden, huge developments.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  We also have one of the biggest FBI whistleblowers joining us, coming up in the third hour today, Kyle Serafin.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  He won't just get into the situation with Hunter Biden.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  He's going to look at the persecution of Christians being named, particularly Catholics, the number one terror threat in America,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  with zero evidence of that.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]  Why would this evil Justice Department jump the shark?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  Well, why would Target sell T-shirts saying we're going to cut Christians' heads off and your children belong to us?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  Because this is a spirit.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]  This is an agenda.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  They can't help it.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]  That's coming up.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  We have Shemaine Nugent, an amazing lady who I've been trying to get to come on as a guest for years.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  She's been on many times with her incredible husband, Ted Nugent.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  She's got a new, incredibly important book coming out, but she is a flamethrower of truth and knowledge.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  She'll be in studio in Austin.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  I was supposed to be back last night, but she's still coming down with her son Rocco.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  She's going to be in studio, second hour today, in the Austin studios.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  And I'll be here in these amazing studios in Tampa, Florida.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  And then, of course, we have some other special guests.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  They're going to be in studio with us here in Florida as well.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  This guy is an amazing Russia expert, worked at the National Security Agency, you name it.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  Literally fought the Russians for decades.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  And we'll be talking to Pastor J.C. Hall.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  I was already aware of his work and his wife's work, but didn't know that they actually worked and go to this church.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  When I ran into him, I go, I know you guys.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfoWars Store at InfoWars Live not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  The answer is simple.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  Thank you.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday Worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  I am Alex Jones, your host, Shemaine Nugent, wife of Ted Nugent, an incredible lady.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]  We'll be in studio with us in Austin, Texas, coming up next hour.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  I am remote from Florida at the Great River Church.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  I'll be coming back to Austin next Sunday.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  I'm about to go to Omaha, Nebraska, but I'll be broadcasting live throughout the week visiting some sick family.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  Again, we have Shemaine Nugent coming up.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  We have a major FBI whistleblower coming on the broadcast, Kyle Serafin.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  And then, of course, we have Russia experts and Constitution experts, Chris Ann Hall and her husband, J.C. Hall,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  who worked at the NSA as a Russia expert, coming on about the incredible developments that we see unfolding.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]  We have the U.N. openly announcing control, not just of your health care, but of your speech, and major backlash against that.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  We have the Pentagon caught involved censoring Americans and a major blow against that tyranny.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  Congress has banned, or the House has banned, hasn't passed the Senate yet, but it's in the defense bill,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]  them being involved censoring the American people.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  Thought that would be a no-brainer.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]  Kevin McCarthy says the House will start impeachment inquiries against Merrick Garland by July 6th
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]  regarding Hunter Biden.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  We are also going to get some incredible statements by Trump and even more incredible statements on the side of Ebel by Biden,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]  where he admits in public to selling national security secrets.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  He's gone from just having dementia to being completely, out of his mind, insane.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  We have got all of that coming out.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000]  And then also New York City's banning gas stoves and barbecues and charcoal stoves.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  We told you this was coming.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  It's no joke. It's part of the U.N. plan.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]  California's moving to ban it as well.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  Places in Europe have already banned fireplaces and space heaters years ago.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  And single-family dwelling homes.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  This is total tyranny, cutting off your resources.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  They're also going to put giant congestion taxes on all cars entering the city.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  This is the model.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]  You say, well, that's a hellhole. That's New York.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  It's the model of the takeover.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]  If they get away with it now, there, it's coming to your town next year.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  So that's coming up.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  We've got such a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  But I wanted to air this very, very important report that really strikes at the heart of everything we're dealing with.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]  And now it blew up in their face.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  Peter Hotez stepped in it big time.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  Here's the report.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  No adverse effects for the nose, throat, and sinuses.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  And it comes from a doctor who's been examining a group of Chesterfield smokers.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  As part of a program supervised by a responsible, independent research laboratory.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  Now, after a full year and four months, the doctor reports again.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  No adverse effects for the nose, throat, or sinuses from smoking Chesterfields.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]  A COVID jab shill.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  Peter Hotez attacks Alex Jones.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  Claims he never took money from Big Pharma.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]  He's really jumped the shark on this one.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]  He's playing a shell game.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  He says, I take money from Bill Gates and the NIH.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]  Well, that's the top.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  They pay for policy.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  And then the research is done.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]  The dummy research that they've requested, the outcome they want.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  And then that is given back to Big Pharma.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  That then produces the poison and is given liability protection by the NIH and by the federal government.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  And then the money travels back to Bill Gates and a few other big companies.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  And it's tax-free foundation.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]  Then he pays no taxes.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  About 10 years ago, we got approached by a group at the New York Blood Center, led by Shibu Jiang and Lan Ying Du,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  that had a pretty good idea for coronavirus vaccines.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  And at the time, nobody cared about coronavirus vaccines.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  They were sort of orphaned.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  And so we adopted it.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  What about Big Pharma being tax-exempt?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  And that's really what's happening here, is that Bill Gates brags, oh, I get 21 return on my vaccine investment.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  You've invested $10 billion in vaccinations over the last two decades.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  And you figured out the return on investment for that.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]  And it kind of stunned me.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  Can you walk us through the math?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  It's been $100 billion overall that the world's put in.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  Our foundation is a bit more than $10 billion.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  But we feel there's been over a 20-to-1 return.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  So if you just look at the economic benefits, that's a pretty strong number compared to anything else.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  Potez has a lot.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:23.000]  When I say a lot of nerve, I mean he has a lot of nerve to sit up there and tell the world that I am making this up.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  And what do you have to say to people who think they're vaccine injured?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  Anything for them?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  I mean, do you have anything to say to people that think?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  Do you have anything to say to people?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  Yeah.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  I mean, do you think vaccine injuries are real, Peter?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  Sure. He's worth $35 million on record.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  That's just what he shows on his taxes.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]  $35 million.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  And the man is a pediatrician who runs a children's hospital.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  Think guinea pigs.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  And he thinks your children should be made to take shots.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  It's all about mask compliance.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  That's going to be absolutely critical.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  Because if you don't have masks, remember, this virus aerosolizes.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  So even six feet is not enough.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  It can go 17, 18 feet, several meters.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  What we really have to do is have vaccine mandates in the schools.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  We should have a rule that anyone who walks into a school over the age of 12 has to be vaccinated.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  This is the nature of the anti-vaccine movement in this country.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  It's somehow married now to far right wing extremism and white nationalist group.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  Anyone who's unvaccinated and has been lucky enough to escape COVID, your luck is about to run out.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  And I call it anti-science aggression.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  Coming from Senator Rand Paul, Senator Johnson, members of the House of Representatives,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  in addition to those two senators, are killers.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]  Starting to see now those same anti-vaccine messages that's coming out of the U.S.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  And now we're finding it in Africa and Latin America.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  And remember what the other reason we're seeing this is the Putin government has,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  this has been reported by U.S. and British intelligence,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  has been piling on with this whole systematic program of what's been called
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000]  weaponized health communications, trying to destabilize democracies with anti-vaccine, anti-science messages.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  The Biden administration has to realize that anti-science is a killer, disinformation.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]  It's not even just disinformation.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  This is an anti-science empire right now.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  And we need homeland security.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  We need the Justice Department.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  We've really got health and human services will not be able to figure this out on their own.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  This is so criminal.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]  This is so in America.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  This is so evil.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  Plus, everything they said the last three and a half years was a lie.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  These are epidemiologists.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  These are scientists.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  These are virologists.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  These are pathologists.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  They knew what they were doing, hurting the public and setting the precedent to weaponize Big Pharma
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]  and the media against the people and get away with murder.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  Because you can get away with murder.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]  You can then do whatever you want and you can play God.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  Ted stepped in at big time.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  It's only got 40,000 views, 41,000 views, which isn't paltry, but it needs 4 million views.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  Everyone watching, please.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  They're going to come back with a new pandemic.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  The same criminals are going to launch the same attack again or worse.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  It is a life and death situation.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]  Get ahead of this.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  Go to Band.Video.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  It's free.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  We'll post on the front page of Infowars.com in the live show feed.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  I got busy today and didn't give the crew a live show headline.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  Let's see what live show they came up with.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]  I'm sure the live show headline is great, but I'll also add to it live here on air.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  We're going to add that video under it so you can get it and then share it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]  Remember, they block Band.Video URL.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]  They block Infowars, but you can go to MadMaxWorld.TV and it duplicates all the same links,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  the same videos, and share that link and it's not blocked.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]  MadMaxWorld.TV.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  Let's do it.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  Let's warn people.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  Let's win.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  It's an Infowar.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]  There it is.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  World exclusive.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  FBI whistleblower reveals deep state persecution of Christians and more.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  Yep, that's big.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]  That's huge.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  We should probably add in there that Shemaine Nugent is coming in with huge news.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]  We're also going to have a former NSA, Russia expert, and a constitutional expert on.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  It's just so much, folks.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]  Such a big broadcast today, but I got busy and dropped the ball and did not write up the
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  live show headline.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  How could they know it was coming up?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  A lot of this just got finished last minute.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  Here today.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  Okay, we're going to skip this network break so we have more time.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  Such an emergency situation.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  I'm going to get into the really good news happening with Kevin McCarthy finally and
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  moving to start impeachment of Garland and then of Biden.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  So they're getting their ducks in the row and that's very exciting and incredible.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  Most hardcore statements yet from Trump on the nature of the evil globalist operation
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  and how this country is literally an existential war for its very existence.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]  So that's coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]  But first, let me come right to the listeners with this.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000]  Infowars is a one-of-a-kind operation that conservatively reaches, conservatively with
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  the full show, 5 million people a day and conservatively 20, 30 million people a day
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  with clips and boil downs of what's on the show every day.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]  Conservatively, we are reaching 40 million people a day one way or another.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]  That's a very conservative number and so many times you notice our research, our understanding
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]  is the cutting edge that then others research and then find out is true and duplicate.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  And Media Matters and the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the CIA and the Pentagon
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]  and the Justice Department have all had articles out there saying nine times out of ten.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]  I don't think that's true.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  Seven times out of ten.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  But they said most of the time we track it back to Jones and he needs to be dealt with.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  He needs to be arrested.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]  He needs to be shut down.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]  All this.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  You know the fight we've been in.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]  So I see our greatest work ahead, but quite frankly, we've already done some devastating
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  work together.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  You, the listeners, spreading the word, praying for the broadcast and keeping us on air by
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  buying product.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  So you've noticed I've been skipping a lot of breaks and I have been not plugging a lot.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  I've got so many big guests on and so many calls.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]  We are in the hole.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]  We're staying the way we are.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]  $500,000 right now.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]  And we're in Chapter 11, Subchapter 5 bankruptcy.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  That's a reorganization.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]  So the product's there.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  We're staying open.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  You know, it's all going forward.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]  The only problem is if I don't come to you and sell a great product and you don't buy
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  it, then we won't be able to have enough money to say we can operate.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  And the reorganization that's going to be complete in about a month and a half or less
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]  won't go through.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]  So the big problem is me not selling the great products we have and not, you know,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]  getting you to get them.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]  I don't blame you.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]  These are products you really need.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  And good news, normally it's the second largest sale of the year.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  This year, it's as good as the Christmas sale.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]  And that is, we've been doing this for over 20 years.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]  Fourth of July, super sales starts yesterday.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  It's now up to 60% off plus double Patriot points.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]  That's 10% off on your next order.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  You have your little profile on the shopping cart and you can use the Patriot points you've
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]  got right now.

[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  60% off.

[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]  And that's how you keep us on air.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]  It takes money to fight a war.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]  We don't take your money like the feds and use it against you.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  We're just simply asking you to support us in this fight.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]  We cannot do it without you.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]  Please take action today.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]  That's not that big a hole to get out of, okay?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]  We were back in the black a little bit.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]  I'm like, oh, we're going to be able to hire some crew back
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  and send reporters to the border and send reporters to this and that.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]  That's not going to happen.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]  Nothing's going to happen other than Infowars shutting down
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]  and then I work somewhere else and do the show,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]  but it will take a while to build it back up.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]  We have a brain trust here and archives and work.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  In this key battle, the enemy will see it as a major victory
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]  if they're able to shut us down.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]  And so please, we have gone through so much together.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]  Make the decision to keep us on air now against the globalists.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]  I want to thank those of you that supported us in the past.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]  Go to Infowarsstore2 and just make a donation,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]  and you can make it one time or recurring.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]  You have a little profile there.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]  Cancel anytime.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]  Every 15 days, every month, every three months, every six months,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]  up to nine months, you can go in and every month or every week,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]  whenever you want, you program it.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]  You just click it and make a donation.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]  So please do that as well.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]  instead of making 20%, 30%, 40% like we do on the products.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]  But these really are amazing products.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]  The enemy is out in the open.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]  We're vindicated.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]  People are listening more than ever.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]  But in this major recession, going into depression,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]  I know times are tough.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]  So thank you for your support.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]  and share the articles and the videos.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]  That you can do for free, and that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]  So however God leaves you in your heart to support us,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]  please support us now, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]  God bless you.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  Now let's get into some of the good news,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]  and then I'm going to get into the really sick news
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]  because it's got to be covered.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]  I've been seeing this stuff for about a week,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]  and I mean it's going on all the time,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]  but Pride Month's been going on for quite a while,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]  and in the last week I've not covered it.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]  And so this morning I got up and I started going back
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]  and looking at what we didn't cover late last week and this week.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]  And it's staggeringly bad and staggeringly evil,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]  but the good news is people are waking up and saying no.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]  So that's coming up next segment.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]  And viewer discretion is advised, okay?
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]  This is what's being shown to babies, to 2-year-olds, to 5-year-olds,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]  and we're not showing you the worst stuff, okay,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]  because we're not going to do it.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]  Plus I don't have time to blur out all this stuff.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]  So it's very hard to show one of these pedo parades
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]  where they're not shaking their genitals in 2-year-olds' faces.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]  And they have the children marching in front of them like captives.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]  It's just so horrible.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]  But we have to know this is going on to stop it.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]  The good news is America and the world is waking up and is rejecting it.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]  So we'll give you the latest news on the boycotts,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]  where that all is next segment.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]  But let's get into some good news here.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]  President Trump is an imperfect vessel like I am and like you are.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]  He's been through hell.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]  The enemy, the New World Order, the globalists
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  are throwing everything they've got at him
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]  with state-level and federal indictments.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]  Now they've got new January 6th indictments ready for Trump.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]  Claiming he commanded me to attack the Capitol.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]  Yes, they're trying to indict me.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]  That's a 20-page Washington Post article.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]  It's preposterous. It's insane.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]  Trump thought he was going to speak at a stage that was set up
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]  on the northeast side of the Capitol.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]  You know the rest of history.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]  The D.C. police dressed as Antifa.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  I mean, along with Antifa, dressed as patriots.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]  And then got a few fools to follow him in, broke in.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]  Congress people have the video.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]  That's all coming out. It's insane.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]  It's a lot worse than just Ray Epps.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]  That's coming up as well.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]  But the reason they hate Trump is because he's so hardcore
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]  and he's taking them on and now understands the deep state.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  Something he didn't understand six-plus years ago
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]  when he first got in.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]  Now he knows I was right when I warned him.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]  Now he understands how to beat him.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]  And it shows that the attacks on Trump
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]  have only made him go up in the polls
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  where he's now 35, 40 points ahead of DeSantis.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]  Where he's now 25, 30 points ahead of Biden.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]  RFK, and now most polls, is ahead of Biden.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]  So it shows the people are hungry for real leadership.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  Trump came out and said some really nice things about RFK.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]  He said he respects RFK Jr.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]  and believes Biden will refuse to debate him.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]  Went on to say he's a good man who has a good heart
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]  and who is trying to do good.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]  So RFK sounds like Alex Jones, RFK Jr.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]  Trump does.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]  It's not about me getting the credit.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]  It's about we told you the truth.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]  We were the fulcrum, the center point to educate others.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]  And our worldview was the most accurate.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  And so that's why the enemy wants us off air.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]  So we don't discover the next enemy plan
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]  and get it out to the world.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]  Because people didn't really listen and believe me
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  30 years ago, 29 years ago.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]  They listen now.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]  They know I'm not playing games now.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]  And the good people in the military listen.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]  And the good people in the Justice Department listen.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]  And we're a rallying cry for federal judges
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]  and federal marshals and good FBI agents.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]  And the good people in the government
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]  that are forming a coalition inside the government
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]  to resist this tyranny.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]  It didn't magically exist like a few people said before,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  but now it's actually forming.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]  And it's forming around this broadcast and President Trump.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]  So Trump's bigger than just himself.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]  It's that movement and the fact that globalists
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]  stole the election from him.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]  So Trump is our focal point now.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]  That's why I'm supporting him 100 million percent
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]  for president.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]  He's going to be persecuted.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]  We're going to be persecuted with him.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]  All right, but let's go to a few of these clips.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]  Here is Trump really taking it to the New World Order.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]  This is the final battle.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]  With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  We will expel the warmongers from our government.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]  We will drive out the globalists.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]  We will cast out the communists, Marxists, and fascists.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]  And we will throw off the sick political class
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]  that hates our country.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]  We will rout the fake news media.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]  And we will defeat crooked Joe Biden.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]  We will liberate America from these villains
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]  once and for all.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]  And I will sign a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]  in all 50 states.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]  Prohibited.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]  And on day one, I will reinstate the Trump ban
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  on transgenders in the military.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]  We had it banned.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]  Because our warriors should be focused
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]  on crushing American enemies,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]  on being strong,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]  on having the image of being strong.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]  They have to be powerful.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]  They have to be strong.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]  Especially when you see what's happening in the world today.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]  Not catering to radical gender ideology.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]  Now, that's powerful on the good side.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]  That's pure truth.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  That scares the enemy so bad.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]  Their facade, their bullying,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]  the insanity of chopping little boys' genitals off
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]  and little girls' breasts off,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]  and having weird men in dresses say,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]  I'm an admiral.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]  Your children must have their genitals cut off
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]  or they'll commit suicide.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]  When the National Institutes of Health showed
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]  it's cutting the genitals off
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]  that makes them commit suicide.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]  I've never been suicidal,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]  but if somebody cut my genitals off
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]  and then put a giant plastic object in me
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]  to never let the wound heal,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]  I'd probably kill myself.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]  I mean, folks, folks.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]  If I had my,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]  if I was a girl and had my forearms
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]  and part of my thighs cut off
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]  to make a giant stinking artificial male member
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]  that rots and falls off,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]  almost always within months,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]  always within years,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]  with a piece of PVC pipe through it.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]  I'd probably commit suicide.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]  And then that preacher, Levine,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]  coming up next segment,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]  says, oh, the children commit suicide
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  if you don't let me chop it off.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]  A psycho?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]  He should be in a Rob Zombie movie.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]  A psycho in a wig
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]  wanting to chop kids' parts off?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]  It's House of the Lambs.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]  It's a psycho in a wig
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]  wanting to cut people's skin off.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]  Everybody knows who these people are.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]  But here's Biden,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  the real American psycho,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]  in a press conference yesterday
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]  admitting that he sells state secrets.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]  He's completely out of his mind.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]  Here it is.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]  I was just thinking, uh, uh,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]  anyway,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]  I started off without you.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]  And I sold a lot of state secrets
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]  and a lot of very important things
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]  that I wanted to share.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]  By the way,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]  people are saying that's a deepfake.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]  I went and checked the White House.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]  It's at WhiteHouse.gov right here.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]  WhiteHouse.gov right here.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]  It officially says that.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]  President Biden, okay,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]  I was just thinking, anyway,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]  I started off without you.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]  I sold a lot of state secrets.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]  All the very important things
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]  that we shared.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]  Laughter.

[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]  and rotting brain.

[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]  for 50% off since last Christmas.

[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]  effect to the body.

[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]  Superfemale Vitality is selling out.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]  It's an incredible formula
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]  for stamina, energy, libido.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]  Only a few hundred bottles left,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]  but the good news is
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]  we have several thousand bottles left
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]  of Superfemale Vitality
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]  that's the same formula.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]  It boosts men.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]  It boosts women.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]  It works great,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]  but women like pink labels,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]  men like different color labels,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]  so it works for men as well.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]  It's the same formula.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]  It's an incredible formula

[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]  and here's another important part

[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]  at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]  We have three original,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]  one-of-a-kind toothpaste
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]  designed by my father, a dentist,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]  at InfoWarsTore.com
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]  that don't have fillers,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]  that are filled with high-quality
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]  essential oils and more.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]  We have the turmeric toothpaste.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]  with coral calcium toothpaste,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]  and we have the amazing
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]  activated charcoal toothpaste,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]  again, with a whole bunch
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]  of key essential oils
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]  that are so good,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]  not just for your teeth
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]  and your gums,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]  but your whole mouth,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]  your throat, and more.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]  These are really game-changing toothpaste.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]  They're very, very strong.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]  Most over-the-counter toothpaste
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]  have fluoride.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]  Ours don't,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]  and it doesn't have fillers in it.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]  It is just chock full
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]  of incredible things
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]  that God gave us
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]  through Mother Nature.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]  So, it's now back in stock.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]  It became a bestseller.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]  The turmeric toothpaste
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]  is available again
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]  at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]  We're selling out
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]  of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]  We've got some of that left,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]  and we also have some
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]  of the amazing
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]  activated charcoal toothpaste
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]  in stock,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]  but it's running out as well.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]  So, all three toothpastes in stock
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]  for a limited time
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]  at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]  I talk a lot about
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]  the great successes
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]  InfoWars has had.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]  I don't think anybody
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]  can deny it,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]  and it is because
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]  of listeners and viewers
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]  supporting us.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]  When we talk about
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]  the crew at InfoWars,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]  people behind the scenes,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]  the researchers,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]  the writers,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]  they really have been
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]  the MVPs in this fight.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]  And when you look
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]  at Harrison Smith
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]  and Owen Schroer
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]  and the hard work
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]  they engage in every day,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]  five, six, seven days a week,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]  it's really just incredible.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]  So, for myself
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]  and the whole InfoWars crew,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]  I thank you
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]  for your past support.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]  I only encourage you now
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]  to realize that
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]  InfoWars cannot stay on air
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]  if you do not support us.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  I know you spread the word.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]  I know you pray for us,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]  and that's wonderful.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]  Keep doing it.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]  But most viewers and listeners
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]  never go to InfoWarsTore.com
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]  and you never buy great products
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000]  that enrich and empower your life
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]  all at the same time
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]  keeping us on air.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]  I know that less than 1%
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]  of our listeners
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]  actually go buy products
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]  at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]  If just 1% more of you
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]  took action
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]  and went to InfoWarsTore.com,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]  our funding problems
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]  will be over.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]  Please take action now.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:34.939]  Again, I'm very, very honored and blessed to be here talking to millions of people.
[00:33:34.939 --> 00:33:37.939]  And I just want to remind listeners that we're in a total information war.
[00:33:37.939 --> 00:33:42.379]  The entire New World Order plan hinges on the public not knowing what's happening.
[00:33:42.379 --> 00:33:45.500]  Christ said the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.580]  And it is really up to all of you, if you want to stop this evil, to get the word out.
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.699]  And I know that's a very simple statement.
[00:33:52.699 --> 00:33:53.699]  You know that.
[00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:56.060]  But seriously, you are not the tail.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.340]  You are the dog.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.260]  And if you don't take action, the dog doesn't hunt.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.939]  If you do take action, it's game over.
[00:34:02.939 --> 00:34:06.740]  That's why the Globalist Worldwide tried to keep churches locked down for years and said
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:11.660]  singing is bad, but you can go to a Black Lives Matter protest and burn some buildings
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.660]  down.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.779]  They put out fake studies saying that was good to stop COVID.
[00:34:15.779 --> 00:34:18.740]  It's all about murdering logic.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:19.819]  Two men can have a baby.
[00:34:19.819 --> 00:34:21.380]  We're going to cut your child's genitals off.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:25.140]  We're going to open the borders up, but TSA is going to grope you when you go through
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.400]  a checkpoint.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.440]  It's all about getting you to give up and roll over.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.620]  But we're not rolling over, and we're particularly not rolling over to this.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:41.420]  So we've got Pride Month, and now the new talking point all over the corporate media
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:47.859]  and from Rachel Levine, the man in a dress wearing an admiral outfit with fruit salad
[00:34:47.859 --> 00:34:53.859]  on his chest, is it's no longer Pride Month, it's Pride Summer.
[00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:58.339]  Justin Trudeau just said that last week in Canada.
[00:34:58.339 --> 00:35:00.020]  Government officials said it all over the world.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.980]  This is their ideology.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:08.420]  It's a global government pervert cult of sexualizing children.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.319]  That's what they have to offer, is mutilating children, sex with children.
[00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:18.859]  This is a pedo cult, and I was the first to say it's a worldwide pedophile army.
[00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:19.859]  That's what Satan wants.
[00:35:19.859 --> 00:35:23.740]  That's the spirit, and now it's all over the news.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.299]  In fact, there was a clip here in my list where I predicted all of this, and I think
[00:35:27.299 --> 00:35:28.940]  we're going to play that coming up.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:34.779]  It's like from 10 years ago, but video, Biden trans health official claims gender surgery
[00:35:34.779 --> 00:35:37.819]  on kids is literally suicide prevention care.
[00:35:37.819 --> 00:35:42.680]  We're going to get to that, but first, you understand that we've got compilations of
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.859]  your new viewer that are six, seven, eight minutes long of clip after clip after clip
[00:35:46.859 --> 00:35:51.339]  after clip after clip after clip after clip after clip after clip after clip at Baton
[00:35:51.339 --> 00:36:00.779]  Rouge, Louisiana, and Buffalo, New York, and Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, and
[00:36:00.779 --> 00:36:04.500]  Minneapolis, St. Paul, just everywhere.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.100]  In the last few years saying, we're grooming your children, we're taking your children,
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.380]  and we're going to have sex with them, and you're not going to stop us.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.779]  And now in Target, they have shirts with a male adult skeleton handing a baby skeleton
[00:36:15.779 --> 00:36:20.700]  the fire of transgenderism and saying, join my Satan cult, let's have sex.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.580]  And if your parents don't like it, we're going to chop their heads off.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:29.660]  And they've got kids throwing bricks and training for violence against Christians and conservatives.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.660]  There it is.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.580]  Pride Seattle adults encourage children to throw bricks at pictures of Republicans.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.299]  Meanwhile, that same parade, it was naked men on bikes riding around in front of little
[00:36:39.299 --> 00:36:40.299]  kids.
[00:36:40.299 --> 00:36:43.859]  I mean, imagine you're a child, you're taking around a bunch of adults dancing and shaking
[00:36:43.859 --> 00:36:45.819]  their genitals at you.
[00:36:45.819 --> 00:36:51.100]  Now if a pedo goes to the park and shakes their penis at a child, they get five years
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.859]  in prison.
[00:36:52.859 --> 00:36:58.819]  But if you do it at a pedo parade in these areas, well, then it's okay.
[00:36:58.819 --> 00:37:03.859]  They also beat people's brains out in places like New York, just independent camera people
[00:37:03.859 --> 00:37:06.980]  got hit on the head with bricks, speaking of bricks, we've got it all.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:11.420]  But here's just one of the latest clips in, is this in New York or Boston?
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.420]  This is in New York.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.700]  Oh, I have one in New York and Boston.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.500]  So here's one of the newest clips.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.500]  We're coming.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.500]  We're going to get your children.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:41.500]  So
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.420]  these are unhappy zombies that have got every weird fetish there is.
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.340]  None of it excites them anymore.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.700]  Not peeing on each other, not eating poop.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.540]  And I'm sorry to tell you that, but that's what they do.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.220]  And it's a fetish about your children.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.020]  The zombie spirit in them wants your children.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.980]  They don't have children, but they want to have CPS take Christian children and give
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.980]  them the children.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.580]  And in many cases they get caught selling the children out into sex slavery.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.859]  But now they've got the millions of little children coming in across the border and Biden's
[00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:10.100]  no longer giving them IDs or checking their DNA.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.660]  So they're in no database.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.660]  They're just disappearing.
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.259]  That's why Congress even says, do you know the federal government now?
[00:38:16.259 --> 00:38:20.380]  Sex smuggles, sex traffics, children.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.819]  Here's a guy got hit in the back of the head by a glass bottle and the left's very proud
[00:38:24.819 --> 00:38:25.819]  of it.
[00:38:25.819 --> 00:38:28.380]  Nobody gets in trouble because they're the abused left.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.380]  They get your children.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.740]  They get to wear admiral outfits and cut your children's genitals off.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.180]  They're so liberal.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.420]  So let's go to the next clip.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.420]  There's just so many of these.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:42.259]  Speaking of that, let's go ahead and go to clip 22.
[00:38:42.259 --> 00:38:47.580]  This is Seattle pride kicks off by being led boys and girls, scouts of America.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:51.700]  So here's when the Romans used to bring slaves back to Rome and from conquered countries,
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.180]  they'd have the slaves up front leading the parade to show the spoils.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.180]  Here's the spoils.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.980]  They've already destroyed the boy scouts of America, sexualizing it.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.100]  It's already imploded because of all the pedophilia.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:08.340]  Here it is.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.980]  Five-year-old, six-year-old, seven-year-old, eight-year-old children having no idea wearing
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:19.020]  transgender flags, being led like prisoners into this, into this situation.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.420]  Let's just keep going to the clips.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.700]  Here's a clip.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.700]  Here's clip 21.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.580]  Here's clip 21, attending Seattle pride parade, rip up street preachers, Bible.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.580]  What nice people.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.580]  You can't do that.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.580]  That's my property.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.580]  And that's God's word.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.580]  Have fun doing this at a pride event when nobody wants you doing that.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.580]  You're full of hate.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.859]  You're probably a teacher.
[00:39:37.859 --> 00:39:43.859]  What is wrong with you?
[00:39:43.859 --> 00:39:49.620]  That's who these people are.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.040]  They want to get our free speech, our children.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.040]  They want it all.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.040]  They're gonna conquer us.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.420]  We let them on a bunch of pathetic people.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.340]  We're letting these even more pathetic people conquer us.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.340]  Here's clip 24.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.340]  Bud Light.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.340]  Eclipse, Bud Light all over the country.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.740]  The stages are Bud Light, they have floats of Bud Light.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.700]  Bud Light wants you to know that they love marching
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.819]  five-year-old children at these events.
[00:40:12.819 --> 00:40:14.220]  We're not gonna show you the naked people,
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.660]  people pooping, urinating, people having simulated sex,
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.180]  people having simulated sex on the cross.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.259]  Not gonna show you all that, but little children.
[00:40:23.259 --> 00:40:24.620]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.340]  We're not gonna put it out over broadcast TV here.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.460]  But let's go ahead now and start going to
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.660]  the Admiral, Health and Human Services Deputy Head,
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.540]  wearing all the fruit salad on their chest.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.380]  Let's go to Eclipse 16, 17, 18, back-to-back.
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.859]  Hello, my name is Admiral Rachel Levine,
[00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:46.140]  and I have the honor of being
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.460]  the Assistant Secretary for Health
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.060]  at the United States Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.460]  Happy Pride, happy Pride Month,
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.500]  and actually, let's declare it a Summer of Pride.
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.400]  Happy Summer of Pride.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.240]  So, you know, let's talk for a moment
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.759]  about the trans healthcare that our community needs,
[00:41:04.759 --> 00:41:07.920]  and transgender medicine and gender-affirming care.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.200]  I mean, that term is important,
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.759]  although our opponents have weaponized it.
[00:41:11.759 --> 00:41:14.480]  You know, it's such an important issue
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.720]  for our youth and adults.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.120]  As you said, some of these laws
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.480]  are actually extending into adulthood.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.680]  You know, we often say that gender-affirming care
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.359]  is healthcare, gender-affirming care is mental healthcare,
[00:41:26.359 --> 00:41:27.480]  and gender-affirming care
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.920]  is literally suicide prevention care.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.560]  Would that be your view as well?
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.040]  I 100% agree.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.680]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.840]  and it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.200]  Here's the Secretary, Xavier Becerra,
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.600]  talking about that Biden is gonna go after the states
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.840]  that try to keep them from brainwashing children
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.240]  who can't buy a pack of cigarettes or a gun
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.200]  and join the military,
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.240]  and letting the state cut their genitals off.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.560]  We're gonna go to break and we're gonna come back with that.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.920]  I see the break is nigh.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.359]  And then I'm gonna get into the situation in Russia,
[00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:07.240]  the latest developments in the economy,
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.680]  the latest development with FBI whistleblowers.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.680]  We got Shemaine Nugent in studio coming up next hour
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.720]  on a host of incredible issues.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.080]  Like, let me tell you some of the stuff
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.359]  that Shemaine is coming on about.
[00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:22.960]  She sent me a whole list of things.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.399]  I don't know where that is in my list.
[00:42:24.399 --> 00:42:26.040]  Well, she's a firecracker.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.680]  She's gonna cover it all.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.759]  So that's, I'll find that and I'll get to that.
[00:42:30.759 --> 00:42:32.960]  Coming up, InfoWars.com.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.560]  Tomorrow's news today, Bandot Video.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.560]  Remember, those URLs are hard to share,
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.120]  but you can go to MadMaxWorld.tv,
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.359]  and that creates a clone of Bandot Video
[00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:43.240]  with the same links.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.880]  It just changes the links out to MadMaxWorld.tv.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.279]  You're able to share it on Twitter, Instagram,
[00:42:47.279 --> 00:42:48.319]  Facebook, everywhere else.
[00:42:48.319 --> 00:42:49.720]  You can always, by word of mouth, tell people,
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.480]  hey, you know the most banned guy in America?
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.759]  Wanna turn out to be right?
[00:42:52.759 --> 00:42:55.440]  He's still on air with more important info than ever
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.480]  at InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.840]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters,
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.480]  are now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.640]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.680]  when you get them together,
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.440]  or 40% off when you get them individually.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.080]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.800]  Two separate formulas.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.640]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.600]  One is a four- to six-hour good base of clean energy,
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.359]  again, with no hangover or letdown.
[00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:28.440]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula,
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.000]  that's Brain Force Ultra, that hits really, really quick.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.880]  And I love it, it wears off in two to three hours.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.080]  So if I've gotta work at night,
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.120]  but don't wanna stay up all night,
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.200]  I can take it and say nine o'clock at night,
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.279]  gotta stay up till midnight working,
[00:43:38.279 --> 00:43:39.800]  doing a radio interview or something,
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.840]  and boom, writing an article or writing a book,
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.920]  and then I get two, three hours of energy,
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.279]  and then you go right to bed after it.
[00:43:46.279 --> 00:43:48.120]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus,
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.680]  both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.040]  A lot of people love these products,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.240]  they've got five-star reviews,
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.000]  but if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.960]  50% off, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:04.359]  ♪♪
[00:44:04.359 --> 00:44:05.840]  I wanna say Brain Force is great.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.680]  I wanna say Turbo Force is amazing.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.520]  It is.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.000]  But if you took it with fish oil,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.240]  it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.560]  The fish oil's better than it.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.399]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:44:16.399 --> 00:44:18.880]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.960]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.800]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.680]  And I'm just sorry, you want something like this,
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.640]  you don't get stuff for free.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.800]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.080]  I'm not making a medical statement here,
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:32.920]  but let me tell you something,
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.800]  and I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.680]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:44.160]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.640]  So we don't make a big profit off of it,
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.759]  but you notice I just obsess,
[00:44:49.759 --> 00:44:51.480]  because whatever the best is we've got,
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.560]  I just can't lie to you.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.840]  I just can't do it.

[00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.920]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.960]  Do you like RainForce?
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.240]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.520]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.399]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz,
[00:46:07.399 --> 00:46:09.520]  four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.840]  and now two books with Alex Jones.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.240]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.560]  What I always need is I always need
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.279]  some sort of boost in the morning,
[00:46:19.279 --> 00:46:23.200]  and so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins,
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.880]  but the one thing that I have really found
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.720]  that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.040]  I'll take RainForce in the morning
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.880]  right before I go to my computer,
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.440]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.440]  writing a whole lot of stuff,
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.200]  so it really is true that RainForce
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.920]  is something I use every day,
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.560]  and it helps me with my writing.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.399]  All right, we love you.
[00:46:43.399 --> 00:46:44.240]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.359]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra,
[00:46:46.359 --> 00:46:49.000]  and TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.800]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.200]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.040]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.800]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.399]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:57.399 --> 00:46:59.080]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.600]  of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:34.770]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen, so here is the federal official, openly, Secretary
[00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:40.529]  Xavier McCarra, talking about what Biden is going to do to protect health care access
[00:47:40.529 --> 00:47:50.330]  to LGBTQ, P.S. Americans, P.S. literally pedophile, Satanist, and again, that's not me being funny.
[00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:57.730]  They have officially adopted a devil worship stance, and they get most leftists who weren't
[00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:01.009]  originally devil worshipers to do it, to go, oh, we're just going to make the right-wingers
[00:48:01.009 --> 00:48:04.210]  mad at this event, we're going to say we're devil worshipers.
[00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.410]  And they have these movies like Hell's Satan that make it a big joke, but then they actually
[00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:08.410]  believe it, they do it.
[00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:13.529]  I mean, saying children don't have rights, and we're going to take them from their parents
[00:48:13.529 --> 00:48:17.009]  and convince them to have their genitals cut off, and now they're taking them from parents
[00:48:17.009 --> 00:48:20.609]  in Canada, convincing them to be euthanized because they're, quote, depressed, that's
[00:48:20.609 --> 00:48:26.250]  murdering children, wake up, people, see how bad it's gotten.
[00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.950]  See how crazy it's gotten.
[00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.250]  See how far they've taken us.
[00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:34.089]  This is psychological warfare, Tavistock Institute, MI6.
[00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:40.370]  I told you about it 25 years ago, because Dr. Michael Kaufman, who was in my Endgame
[00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:44.690]  films, found all the federal documents about the Tavistock Institute developing this plan.
[00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:49.370]  This is a total weaponization plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:56.009]  So here he is saying, we're going to get your kids, oh, we're going to protect their health
[00:48:56.009 --> 00:48:59.810]  care, to have their breasts cut off, to have their uteruses cut off, to have their body
[00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:00.810]  parts cut off.
[00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:06.089]  Again, a child can't buy a gun or a can of chewing tobacco, a pouch of chewing tobacco,
[00:49:06.089 --> 00:49:10.290]  or join the military, but as young as seven, because they want it, because they got told
[00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:15.609]  this when they were little, and they got brainwashed, they got attention by psychologists and brainwashers
[00:49:15.609 --> 00:49:19.810]  targeting them in the school, and in many cases, keeping it from the parents, knowledge,
[00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:26.130]  secret files on them to destroy their productivity, to destroy their creativity, to destroy their
[00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:32.330]  ability to procreate, their fertility, to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:34.750]  They couldn't kill them in the womb.
[00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:40.250]  They want to kill them and their ability to replicate.
[00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:43.490]  This is so fundamental.
[00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:44.490]  Here's the clip.
[00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:50.690]  Gender affirming care is not only validated care, but it also keeps people healthy and
[00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:51.690]  it saves lives.
[00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:55.890]  And so we're out there, we're going to do everything we can to make sure that we continue
[00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:59.690]  to offer Americans the healthcare that they have a right to get, and that includes gender
[00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:00.850]  affirming care.
[00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:06.210]  So can you give us some behind the scenes insights into what, I failed the last time,
[00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:12.049]  so I'm going to try again, into what the Biden administration plans to do to support those
[00:50:12.049 --> 00:50:13.049]  actions?
[00:50:13.049 --> 00:50:20.890]  Well, we, we have issued some guidelines that say that a provider who receives Medicare
[00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:25.649]  funding, Medicaid funding, must be prepared to offer gender affirming care.
[00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:30.410]  We unfortunately ran into a couple of circuit courts that said differently.
[00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:36.609]  And so we're now in the process of having to work under those rulings.
[00:50:36.609 --> 00:50:40.970]  But we're not going to stop everywhere where we have an opportunity at the federal level.
[00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:45.490]  And again, I go back to yesterday's conversation where we don't control healthcare.
[00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:50.450]  We don't control how gender affirming care is provided or if it is provided.
[00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:55.170]  But where we have laws that require you to fulfill your obligations, if you want that
[00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:59.250]  Medicaid dollar to come to your state, we're going to make sure you check the box.
[00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:03.009]  Are you feeling hopeful that that will succeed?
[00:51:03.009 --> 00:51:07.009]  Look, I'm the son of immigrants.
[00:51:07.009 --> 00:51:08.330]  Optimism runs in my...
[00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:09.330]  That's enough.
[00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:10.330]  Just shut it off.
[00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.330]  Shut it off, please.
[00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:16.049]  It's all about, we've got to help the children that are committing suicide.
[00:51:16.049 --> 00:51:17.130]  We've got to give them this care.
[00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:21.049]  They kill themselves because that demographic kill themselves because they're having their
[00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:22.049]  genitals cut off.
[00:51:22.049 --> 00:51:23.529]  They're being given hormone blockers.
[00:51:23.529 --> 00:51:28.730]  I mean, it's hideous, ladies and gentlemen, what they push, what they do, what they create.
[00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.770]  It's absolutely hideous.
[00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:36.089]  Here is a headline being celebrated by major newspapers and magazines.
[00:51:36.089 --> 00:51:40.250]  Look how beautiful it is that this man is pregnant with a baby.
[00:51:40.569 --> 00:51:50.410]  No, it is a black woman that takes testosterone and grows a beard being kissed by a woman
[00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:51.410]  on the stomach.
[00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:54.649]  Do you have any idea what taking hormones does to pregnancies?
[00:51:54.649 --> 00:51:55.970]  Screws them up.
[00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:57.770]  They're abusing that baby.
[00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.850]  If you smoke marijuana and they find you smoking marijuana, they'll take the baby at birth.
[00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:04.130]  But if you take all these gender blocking drugs that screw them up even worse, you get
[00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.009]  an award.
[00:52:07.009 --> 00:52:11.890]  They know exactly what they're doing and they're monsters, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:14.730]  Let's play two clips here.
[00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:17.089]  One we've already played, but one of them I want to play again.
[00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:21.290]  Let's play clips three and four back to back.
[00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:25.770]  One is pride marchers carry banner near Washington Square Park in New York City saying, thank
[00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:26.770]  God for abortion.
[00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:27.770]  Here it is.
[00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:53.930]  And they always say, don't ban drag.
[00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.850]  Nobody's banning people dressing up in dresses, men.
[00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:00.930]  We're banning you giving child porn magazines to children, tell them how to have sex with
[00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:01.930]  adults.
[00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:02.930]  Yeah.
[00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:03.930]  Go ahead and start.
[00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:04.930]  Clip.
[00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:05.930]  Let's start.
[00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:06.930]  Clip four over with audio.
[00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:19.930]  Here it is.
[00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:33.130]  Now play clip 22.
[00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:38.970]  This is the Boy Scouts being led like prisoners in front of this girl scouts, little babies,
[00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:44.730]  young as four and five, immersed in a sea of men shaking their penises and people riding
[00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:45.730]  around naked on bikes.
[00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:49.649]  I mean, we're not going to show you how the men come up and literally hump in front of
[00:53:49.649 --> 00:53:50.649]  the children.
[00:53:50.649 --> 00:53:54.970]  We can't even put this on television for adults to say, but it's all done right out
[00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:56.130]  in the open.
[00:53:56.130 --> 00:54:00.370]  But somebody does this in a regular jurisdiction at a park in front of a child in decent exposure
[00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:03.009]  with a child, five years in prison.
[00:54:03.009 --> 00:54:07.230]  But it's done in these cities of evil, these blue cities collapsing with feces and needles
[00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:11.870]  and homeless and then weird goblin people marching around with their children and other people's
[00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:12.870]  kidnapped children.
[00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.730]  Half these leftists didn't biologically have their kids.
[00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:21.250]  They use the CPS to literally go out and call them from Christian populations.
[00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:27.970]  If the CIA in Germany from the sixties until the nineties kidnapped over 30,000 children
[00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:33.690]  through CPS and gave it to convicted pedophiles to create a new family, boys with men, girls
[00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:40.130]  with women in a sexual relationship with an adult as the new family, New Yorker magazine
[00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:43.410]  reported on it decades after we did and said, oh, it's terrible.
[00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.410]  It's terrible.
[00:54:45.089 --> 00:54:47.009]  Oh, so some of you still have a soul.
[00:54:47.009 --> 00:54:49.649]  This is government run to break up society.
[00:54:49.649 --> 00:54:50.649]  This is planned.
[00:54:50.649 --> 00:54:51.649]  This is corporate backed.
[00:54:51.649 --> 00:54:59.330]  John, the clips are two clips of the stages being Bud Light stages.
[00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:04.730]  What in New York, in Boston, in Toronto, all over Bud Light after they lose trillions of
[00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:05.730]  dollars.
[00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:12.490]  There they are, folks, letting, you know, not just Dylan Mulvaney.
[00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:15.930]  He's a he's a woman celebrating womanhood.
[00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:16.930]  It's woo.
[00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:17.930]  Drink your Bud Light.
[00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:18.930]  You're the future.
[00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:23.089]  You lost twenty four billion dollars.
[00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:26.330]  They don't care.
[00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:27.930]  They don't care.
[00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:29.810]  This is sick.
[00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:32.009]  Just look how weak these zombie people are.
[00:55:32.009 --> 00:55:36.009]  All right, folks, let's let's go to break.
[00:55:36.009 --> 00:55:41.370]  We're going to get Chimane Nugent in here at six after I want to air the incredible important
[00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:45.330]  Peter Hotez video, not the one we just put out that just as powerful, but the one from
[00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:46.330]  last week.
[00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:49.210]  So amazing showing him and all his scams, all his fraud next segment.
[00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:50.210]  So we'll come in.
[00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.210]  If you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:57.170]  And then the latest Peter Hotez video from last week and then Chimane Nugent is going
[00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.569]  to knock it out of the park.
[00:55:58.569 --> 00:56:07.049]  She is just as fiery and amazing as the great Rivers Motor City madman Ted Nugent.
[00:56:07.049 --> 00:56:10.970]  And she is going to be in studio with us next hour.
[00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:16.689]  And she's going to be talking about everything, the new world order, the globalist, just how
[00:56:16.689 --> 00:56:20.330]  to fight back the campaign, Trump.
[00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:26.170]  So much more next hour than we have Russia experts, the NSA, you name it.
[00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:30.130]  We've got a major FBI whistleblower that's going to be newsmaking joining us as well.
[00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:35.170]  Tell everybody, you know, tune in to Infowars.com forward slash show and band video.

[00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:54.049]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowars Store and Infowars Life not at a probiotic
[00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:55.049]  for more than three years?
[00:57:55.049 --> 00:57:56.450]  The answer is simple.
[00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:59.370]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:03.850]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:07.810]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr.
[00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:09.290]  Jones, anymore.
[00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:15.250]  Finally, we've got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:34.569]  it funds our entire operation.
[00:58:34.569 --> 00:58:38.770]  So get your Infowars MD probiotic today at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:41.330]  It's a high quality formula and it keeps us on the air.
[00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:49.569]  Take action now at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:58:49.569 --> 00:58:54.970]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:56.330]  supply.
[00:58:56.330 --> 00:59:00.970]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[00:59:01.049 --> 00:59:05.210]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:08.009]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:59:08.009 --> 00:59:11.370]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:16.569]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[00:59:16.569 --> 00:59:19.290]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:24.569]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[00:59:24.569 --> 00:59:30.250]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:36.330]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:42.170]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:48.090]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:56.890]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:12.890]  One of the things that we're not hearing a lot about is the unique potential safety problem
[01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:14.890]  of coronavirus vaccines.
[01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:16.890]  And then something changed.
[01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:23.609]  Any vaccine released by emergency use authorization by the FDA is an outstanding vaccine.
[01:00:23.609 --> 01:00:27.210]  J&J's vaccine has a risk of life-threatening blood clots.
[01:00:28.009 --> 01:00:30.890]  When you hear the beep, that's the sound of safety.
[01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:32.649]  So don't overthink it.
[01:00:32.649 --> 01:00:34.490]  They're both really good.
[01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:37.049]  They're all really good vaccines.
[01:00:37.049 --> 01:00:38.090]  Get vaccinated now.
[01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:39.130]  You got a call now.
[01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:42.090]  If you wait, it's going to be really too late to protect your child.
[01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:46.490]  If this was your child, what happens next could make it the worst day of your life.
[01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:49.529]  So even though COVID poses zero threat to healthy children...
[01:00:49.529 --> 01:00:50.649]  Vaccinate your children.
[01:00:50.649 --> 01:00:52.009]  Do the right thing.
[01:00:52.009 --> 01:00:53.689]  Be safe and not sorry.
[01:00:53.689 --> 01:00:58.730]  I'm strongly recommending for adolescents to get their two doses of vaccine fully immunized
[01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:59.850]  after those two doses.
[01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:02.569]  Advanced technology that can help save lives.
[01:01:02.569 --> 01:01:04.410]  This is going to be a long-lasting vaccine.
[01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.170]  A long-lasting vaccine.
[01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:08.009]  A few moments later...
[01:01:08.009 --> 01:01:13.290]  We're seeing that two doses is not holding up well for emergency room visits.
[01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:15.850]  It's not holding up well for hospitalizations.
[01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:18.330]  Here we are again.
[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:20.090]  Everyone's going to need a booster.
[01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:21.850]  You need that third immunization.
[01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:22.730]  Triple the amount.
[01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:24.170]  Get that third immunization.
[01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:27.130]  The two mRNA vaccines were always a three-dose vaccine.
[01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:30.250]  The two mRNA vaccines were always a three-dose vaccine.
[01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:32.649]  I've always said this is a three-dose vaccine.
[01:01:32.649 --> 01:01:34.810]  I've always said this is a three-dose vaccine.
[01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:36.410]  This is a three-dose vaccine.
[01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:37.689]  But I'm not done yet.
[01:01:37.689 --> 01:01:42.250]  That third immunization, the problem is it's not holding up.
[01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:46.009]  So we may have to look at sort of innovative solutions.
[01:01:46.009 --> 01:01:47.609]  Oh God, not this again.
[01:01:47.609 --> 01:01:49.210]  A fourth immunization.
[01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:51.049]  Just to keep them going.
[01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:52.410]  Keep the country going.
[01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:54.170]  We have to consider some out-of-the-box things.
[01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:55.689]  A fourth immunization.
[01:01:55.689 --> 01:01:56.250]  Fourth!
[01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:57.370]  A fourth immunization.
[01:01:57.370 --> 01:01:58.410]  Get that second boost.
[01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.810]  A second boost to keep the country going.
[01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:02.410]  I've made that recommendation.
[01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:03.770]  A fourth immunization.
[01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:05.049]  But I'm still not done!
[01:02:05.049 --> 01:02:06.810]  One semester later...
[01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.450]  Unfortunately, the numbers are starting to trend up again.
[01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:11.130]  So the hospitalizations are up.
[01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:14.250]  And so the most important message that I have this morning
[01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.250]  is get your new bivalent booster.
[01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:19.130]  Willie and Lise were saying they got their booster.
[01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:21.049]  And I was like, oh, I need to get mine.
[01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:24.170]  And then I found out they're talking about the third shot.
[01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:26.970]  And is that the bivalent?
[01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:28.250]  Or is it the fourth booster?
[01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:29.529]  Or does it matter?
[01:02:29.529 --> 01:02:31.049]  Don't worry so much about the number.
[01:02:31.049 --> 01:02:32.569]  There's no wrong way to use it.
[01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:33.529]  You have to get it.
[01:02:33.529 --> 01:02:34.810]  This new bivalent booster.
[01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:36.810]  You can double or triple stack them.
[01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:39.529]  The new bivalent one is doing a much better job.
[01:02:39.529 --> 01:02:40.410]  You have to get a booster.
[01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.490]  You need to get this new bivalent booster.
[01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:43.930]  That bivalent booster for COVID.
[01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:47.130]  But does everyone ages 12 and older need a booster?
[01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.170]  The answer is yes.
[01:02:49.049 --> 01:02:52.330]  And by the way, if you're over 15 and have gotten two boosters
[01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:55.290]  and more than two to four months out,
[01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:57.370]  you're going to need a third booster as well.
[01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.130]  A fifth immunization.
[01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:00.490]  Five!
[01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:04.170]  I don't think we're going to need an annual booster like flu.
[01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.370]  Eventually.
[01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:08.810]  Dr. Hotez supports yearly boosters just like flu.
[01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:10.170]  But I'm still not done!
[01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:14.490]  It looks as though the boosters are not holding up quite as well as we'd like.
[01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.330]  And I think our thinking is going to change.
[01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:22.330]  And that what's going to happen is every, you know, few months,
[01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:23.850]  we may need another booster.
[01:03:25.049 --> 01:03:27.210]  Perfect results each and every time!
[01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:31.130]  You know, we just could not overcome that massive disinformation campaign.
[01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:34.330]  These fake concepts of herd immunity and discrediting masks.
[01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:36.250]  Dr. Hotez, you are a national treasure.
[01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:38.890]  It is picking off young people like we've never seen.
[01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:41.770]  Dr. Peter Hotez, that was extremely informative.
[01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:45.370]  Disinformation that you're hearing that kids are fine, it's nonsense.
[01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:47.450]  Kids need to get that vaccination.
[01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:49.450]  You healthcare workers have been our saviors.
[01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:51.130]  Watch out for that misinformation.
[01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:54.810]  Dr. Peter Hotez is probably one of the smartest people on this topic.
[01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:57.930]  If you haven't gotten your five and ups vaccinated yet,
[01:03:57.930 --> 01:03:58.970]  now's the time to do that.
[01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:01.370]  Dr. Peter Hotez, thank you for saving the world.
[01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:05.049]  We also support giving that third immunization for the 12 to 17 year olds.
[01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:06.330]  People have to feel safe.
[01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:08.410]  Dr. Hotez, you are a voice of reason.
[01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:10.090]  Take down the fake information.
[01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:11.850]  These fake concepts of herd immunity.
[01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.250]  Our last hope is to vaccinate our way through this.
[01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:17.450]  Make certain that everybody's vaccinated, including their kids.
[01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:21.130]  That's the single most important thing right now the American people have to do.
[01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:26.009]  Dr. Peter Hotez was a person that we'd like to go to for this sort of expertise.
[01:04:26.009 --> 01:04:28.330]  The single most impactful thing you can do
[01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:32.009]  is make certain that you're fully boosted and preferably too boosted.
[01:04:32.009 --> 01:04:32.569]  Later.
[01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:35.450]  Lucky Pox is a global emergency.
[01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:41.370]  And it's accelerating among a specific social network of men who have sex with men,
[01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:43.290]  not because it's sexually transmitted.
[01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:48.330]  Monkeypox is sexually transmitted almost exclusively.
[01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.490]  Before we let you go, we have to stop and applaud you,
[01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:53.450]  because a lot of MSNBC viewers who have watched you
[01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:56.649]  constantly for the last three years or so and have come to trust you.
[01:04:56.649 --> 01:04:58.569]  I don't know if they fully appreciate what you have done.
[01:04:59.609 --> 01:05:04.330]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:06.330]  We want to have all the best brands.
[01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:08.250]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:10.810]  So I get constant questions online in person.
[01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:11.689]  Hey, what's better?
[01:05:11.689 --> 01:05:12.490]  Knockout.
[01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:13.130]  What's better?
[01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:14.569]  Down and out.
[01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:15.130]  What's better?
[01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:17.290]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:20.009]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[01:05:20.009 --> 01:05:22.410]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:25.370]  So one person might like this coffee.
[01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:26.970]  Another person likes that coffee.
[01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:28.330]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:29.529]  They're all very diverse.
[01:05:29.529 --> 01:05:32.729]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller
[01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:34.009]  that's been sold for many years.
[01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:39.850]  And sold for a lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.
[01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:43.609]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds.
[01:05:43.609 --> 01:05:46.090]  Give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:50.649]  And it's in stock available right now of 25% off out of the gates.
[01:05:50.649 --> 01:05:53.850]  So get your Infowars MD Good Night Sleep today.
[01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:54.890]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:16.090]  Infowars.
[01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:17.689]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.930]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowars and say,
[01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:32.009]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[01:06:32.009 --> 01:06:33.290]  but you want to fight?
[01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.370]  You better believe you got one.
[01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:49.370]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:49.529 --> 01:07:08.250]  Well, I'm very excited to be here with you on this live broadcast today.
[01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:11.850]  We are going to be here again for the next three hours.
[01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:14.490]  We just completed hour number one.
[01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:17.210]  One of my favorite guests is in studio.
[01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:18.649]  And I was supposed to be back today.
[01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:20.490]  I've had some family issues.
[01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:22.649]  My wife needs to visit her father in the hospital in Omaha.
[01:07:22.649 --> 01:07:23.689]  So we're going to go there tomorrow.
[01:07:23.689 --> 01:07:24.729]  I'll do my show from Omaha.
[01:07:24.729 --> 01:07:29.290]  I'm doing this from the River Church Media Complex in Tampa, Florida.
[01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:30.250]  Revival.com.
[01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:31.370]  The great Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:33.290]  Be sure and check out Revival.com.
[01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:37.450]  But Shemaine Nugent in studio for the rest of the hour.
[01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:40.890]  And we may even get her son Rocco to be popping in with us as well.
[01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.050]  ShemaineNugent.rocks.
[01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:44.569]  She's got so much to talk about.
[01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:47.930]  Faith, freedom, spiritual warfare, killer house books.
[01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.370]  She's got a book called The Killer House.
[01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:50.649]  It's so important.
[01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:53.689]  Also, bow hunting, health, politics, the whole world.
[01:07:53.689 --> 01:07:56.009]  So Shemaine, wish I was there with you.
[01:07:56.729 --> 01:07:58.810]  But I know you also live in Florida as well.
[01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:00.649]  You're almost about to be in Florida right now.
[01:08:00.649 --> 01:08:02.890]  But you stayed in Texas to hang out with me.
[01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:03.930]  But you look amazing.
[01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:05.370]  And I feel like we're in the same room.
[01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:06.890]  So it's great to have you here with us.
[01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:08.729]  Well, thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[01:08:08.729 --> 01:08:10.250]  I'm taking over your studio.
[01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:11.850]  I come bearing gifts.
[01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:12.729]  My killer house book.
[01:08:12.729 --> 01:08:19.050]  But also some organic vegetables and also herbs from my own garden.
[01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:21.370]  And I wanted to give them to you in person.
[01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:22.889]  But this is the next best thing.
[01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:24.410]  So thank you so much for having me.
[01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:25.530]  I'm honored to be here.
[01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:27.930]  Well, I'm honored, too.
[01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:31.210]  You know, your husband, you've been fighting for decades with him like nobody else.
[01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:33.450]  Your husband literally was the original Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:34.010]  Yes.
[01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.290]  70-something years old.
[01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:36.889]  It looks like he's 60.
[01:08:36.889 --> 01:08:39.610]  Great shape, thanks to you and all the things you do for him.
[01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:40.809]  You're an expert on health.
[01:08:40.809 --> 01:08:42.809]  Those who don't know, with your popular shows on it.
[01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:47.690]  But man, he was battling the woke-ism in the late 1960s.
[01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:50.170]  Where would we be without the amazing Ted Nugent?
[01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:51.530]  You know what I remember?
[01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:53.050]  We've been married 34 years now.
[01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:56.969]  And whenever he was doing radio interviews, they always said, don't talk about guns.
[01:08:56.969 --> 01:08:58.010]  Don't talk about hunting.
[01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:59.130]  And he said, screw that.
[01:08:59.130 --> 01:08:59.690]  So you're right.
[01:08:59.690 --> 01:09:02.010]  He was the original Alex Jones.
[01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:05.370]  And I've learned so much from watching him now.
[01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:08.330]  Alex, you know, this is a spiritual war.
[01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:14.570]  We are commissioned by God to stand up for Christian beliefs, for what this country is
[01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:15.690]  founded upon.
[01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:18.010]  So God bless you for doing what you're doing.
[01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:22.410]  Remember who told you, you should come up with a T-shirt that says Alex Jones was right.
[01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:23.370]  Who was that, Alex?
[01:09:24.969 --> 01:09:26.570]  It was the great Shemay Nugent.
[01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:29.450]  Well, I'll take partial credit for it.
[01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:32.090]  But yeah, I think you were right.
[01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:33.610]  You're on the right track.
[01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:35.610]  And we've known each other for a few years.
[01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:36.570]  What, 10 years?
[01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:37.210]  15 years?
[01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:38.809]  And I've seen-
[01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:39.530]  A little more than 10.
[01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:41.450]  Almost there.
[01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:43.370]  I've seen such a change in you, Alex.
[01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:46.809]  And I'm so grateful for what you're doing.
[01:09:46.809 --> 01:09:49.690]  You're spreading this Christian belief.
[01:09:49.690 --> 01:09:52.969]  And not only Christian belief, but what needs to be done.
[01:09:52.969 --> 01:09:56.170]  Satan is here to kill, steal and destroy.
[01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:57.450]  And that's exactly what he's doing.
[01:09:57.450 --> 01:09:59.850]  He's trying to divide this country.
[01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:05.690]  And he's doing it with the LBGTQRS, whatever it is at this point now.
[01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:10.170]  And you notice the blue and pink stripes that were added to that rainbow flag.
[01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:11.290]  You know what that's for, right?
[01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:13.850]  Yes, tell us.
[01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:17.290]  Well, it's the little boys and little girls.
[01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:19.930]  And they did it to us while we were sleeping.
[01:10:19.930 --> 01:10:26.330]  We have to stand up right now more than ever for the rights that we have
[01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:28.410]  and that we don't want to have taken away.
[01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:30.330]  I'm banned on Twitter, Alex.
[01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:30.969]  Ted is not.
[01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:35.770]  I think it's because I share my faith openly.
[01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:39.290]  And even with Elon, I'm still banned on Twitter, but I'm not going to stop.
[01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:43.450]  I feel like now more than ever, God has called us, as Esther 414 says,
[01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:46.010]  for just such a time as this.
[01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:52.410]  Well, I'm not defending Elon, but he said he's not in full control yet.
[01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:56.410]  And when people raise it to him, a lot of times he's able to go in and tell
[01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:59.050]  the kind of stay behind network of leftists to take it down.
[01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:01.770]  But there's no reason that you shouldn't be on Twitter.
[01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:04.889]  But regardless of that, you're reaching more people than ever.
[01:11:04.889 --> 01:11:08.650]  Tell us about all the different shows and things you and Ted are doing,
[01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:10.010]  and then we can start wherever you want.
[01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:15.370]  Because you warned us years ago about mold and about what a serious issue it is.
[01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:18.170]  And now they admit that mold is one of the biggest killers in the world.
[01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:20.809]  You've written a new book that people can read and understand
[01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.889]  and really find out what's going on.
[01:11:22.889 --> 01:11:25.290]  So Shemain, there's so many places to go.
[01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:28.410]  We can get into Trump and how they're trying to put him in prison,
[01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:30.010]  but how that's backfiring on them.
[01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:32.010]  A McCarthy has come out.
[01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:33.050]  So they're going to go ahead and move forward.
[01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:37.210]  The attorney general, Merrick Garland.
[01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.290]  So a lot of huge topics to tackle.
[01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:40.570]  What do you want to jump into first?
[01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:45.210]  Well, I'll start with mold, because I think that was my spiritual awakening.
[01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.130]  You know, I never wanted to be known as the mold lady when I was a little girl.
[01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:52.010]  But now I think this is where God can use me.
[01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:58.010]  I am spreading the word and sharing what I have learned about toxic mold with everyone else.
[01:11:58.010 --> 01:12:00.170]  And it's prevalent.
[01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:03.610]  At least 80% of buildings have some form of toxic mold.
[01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:08.570]  And in my book, Killer House, I share my story about what happened to us,
[01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:11.370]  Ted and I and our son Rocco, who you'll see in a minute,
[01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:16.730]  and our beautiful MTV Cribs home that was contaminated with toxic mold between the walls.
[01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:17.930]  We never saw anything.
[01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:20.170]  We just kept getting sicker and sicker.
[01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:22.730]  And if you're on, I know you're a health proponent, too.
[01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:27.130]  If you're on any type of allergy medication, migraine medication, headache medication,
[01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:32.090]  you have lupus, you have inflammatory diseases, you have joint pain, fibromyalgia,
[01:12:32.650 --> 01:12:36.330]  even cancer can be attributed to toxic mold.
[01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:39.770]  So in my book, Killer House, I share the devastating,
[01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:43.290]  heartbreaking story of losing our MTV Cribs home.
[01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:50.490]  And I'm here as a proponent of health and a living testimony that, you know,
[01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:54.969]  God is good and that the human body has an amazing ability to heal.
[01:12:57.850 --> 01:13:00.250]  Lay out the book, because I can't wait to read it.
[01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.450]  I mean, years ago, you warned my wife and I, you know, we did the testing.
[01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:04.730]  Thank goodness it wasn't our house.
[01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:06.010]  Then we warned some family.
[01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:07.370]  They found out it was.
[01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:10.330]  And then obviously, you know, there's things that can then be done to mitigate it.
[01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:13.530]  But you destroyed a whole house and then, you know, rebuilt it.
[01:13:14.969 --> 01:13:18.570]  And has mold always been this bad or is it in our industrialized world?
[01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:19.770]  Is it the building materials?
[01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:23.450]  It's the building materials, faulty building, faulty craftsmanship.
[01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:25.850]  You know, there might be a few good builders out there.
[01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:28.010]  I personally don't know any.
[01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:32.330]  And the problem is a lot of the inspectors, a lot of the testers nowadays
[01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:37.370]  are in bed with the builders who just try to cut corners, try to cheapen what they're doing.
[01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:40.650]  And that's what my book talks about.
[01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:43.210]  I start from a story of what happened to me.
[01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:48.250]  And in my book, I share very, very personal aspects of my relationship with Ted.
[01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:51.450]  But I do that not to, you know, expose anything.
[01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:52.969]  I've talked about it before.
[01:13:52.969 --> 01:13:55.130]  I don't know anybody who has a perfect relationship.
[01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:59.770]  But what it does is it sets the stage for it really.
[01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:02.570]  When I had some emotional turmoil in my life,
[01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:07.130]  it really caused an environment that I got sicker faster.
[01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:10.170]  And so I set up the book as a storytelling book.
[01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:14.969]  I didn't want it to just be, you know, information and talk about stachybacterias
[01:14:14.969 --> 01:14:18.010]  and all the different types of mold which would bore people to death.
[01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:20.730]  But it's written more like a story, a novel.
[01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:22.730]  And it's the story of my life.
[01:14:22.730 --> 01:14:27.130]  And I just want to expose the dirty little secret about toxic mold,
[01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.130]  that it's alive and well and prevalent.
[01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:34.809]  And I even have a chapter on spiritual warfare in my book about toxic mold.
[01:14:38.889 --> 01:14:42.410]  Again, give people the title, how people get the book and speak more about.
[01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:44.809]  Because Jimmy, you've got a lot to say.
[01:14:45.450 --> 01:14:47.370]  It's amazing when you get going on mold.
[01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:48.730]  Yeah, it's not only mold.
[01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.889]  But again, it's my awakening.
[01:14:50.889 --> 01:14:52.490]  I had to fight for my life.
[01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:55.050]  I was once named Detroit's most physical female.
[01:14:55.050 --> 01:15:00.330]  And I got to the point where I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs because of toxic mold.
[01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:06.250]  We found out that Ted and I both had four different types of mold in our bloodstream.
[01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:08.410]  And I was also diagnosed with having pre-emphysema.
[01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:09.450]  And I don't smoke.
[01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:15.770]  I was teaching 10 to 15 group high intensity aerobics classes every week.
[01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:20.650]  And I was just popping pills, migraine medication like there was no tomorrow.
[01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:23.690]  And I thought, this is not the way it should be.
[01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:27.770]  And while Ted was on tour for rock and roll, I was on the doctor tour.
[01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:29.450]  And no doctors could help me.
[01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:32.809]  So I had to become my own investigative sleuth.
[01:15:32.809 --> 01:15:36.250]  And that's what I lay out in my book, how you can be too.
[01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:40.809]  If you have any illnesses, you need to get to the root cause.
[01:15:40.809 --> 01:15:44.010]  By the way, did we ever find the root cause of immigration?
[01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:46.090]  Because that was talked about a lot.
[01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:48.969]  Anyway, I digress.
[01:15:48.969 --> 01:15:52.330]  In my book, I talk about the root causes of toxic mold
[01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:56.650]  and how to recognize, remediate, and recover from that.
[01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:01.130]  Wow, man, it is great to see you in studio.
[01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:02.090]  I wish I was there with you.
[01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:05.210]  But I also love Pastor Rodney Howard Brown here at the River Church.
[01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:09.050]  Tens of thousands of folks have come through here in the last week that I've been here.
[01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:10.010]  Just amazing.
[01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:11.850]  Are you aware of the River Church up here in Tampa?
[01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:14.010]  Because I know you're down in Naples, right, when you're in Florida.
[01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:17.290]  Yes, down in Naples with Pastor Anthony Thomas, who is,
[01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:20.250]  if Ted was a pastor, he'd be Pastor Anthony Thomas.
[01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:23.930]  I haven't met that pastor in Tampa, but I am all for it.
[01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:24.410]  You know what?
[01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:27.770]  Unfortunately, at many churches, we get milquetoast.
[01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:30.730]  We don't listen to spiritual warfare.
[01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:34.650]  And now more than ever, we need to talk about it.
[01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:39.610]  We need to be equipped and fight the demonism and the Satanism
[01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:42.330]  that is alive and well in this country.
[01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:47.050]  And now more than ever, again, Esther 414, it's kind of exciting, Alex.
[01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:50.650]  I just got goosebumps, or maybe because it's like 20 degrees in the studio.
[01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:53.770]  We were born for such a time as this.
[01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:55.610]  Is it not 20 degrees in the studio?
[01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:56.330]  Maybe 30?
[01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:00.090]  I like to keep it about 67.
[01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:05.690]  You know, the problem is if you ever let it get up to too high a temp
[01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:07.610]  with all those TVs and equipment, it'll...
[01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:09.370]  I mean, look, it's only 105 outside, though.
[01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:09.930]  Would you rather...
[01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:10.570]  I know.
[01:17:10.570 --> 01:17:11.370]  I'm with you.
[01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:11.850]  I'm with you.
[01:17:11.850 --> 01:17:12.410]  That's all right.
[01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:15.530]  I got my sweater here, and I put my hands in it.
[01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:19.530]  But it's comfortable because I'm on fire for God, Alex.
[01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:20.730]  I'm on fire for God.
[01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:23.450]  Well, you're amazing.
[01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:28.330]  I want to now shift gears just into how much you love Trump, how much Ted loves Trump.
[01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:31.050]  I know we always talk about Trump when I'm at your house for dinner and stuff
[01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:35.050]  there outside Waco at your ranch, about how he's doing right now.
[01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.090]  I've talked to Roger Stone.
[01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:38.010]  He says Trump's doing stronger than ever.
[01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:38.730]  He's committed.
[01:17:39.370 --> 01:17:44.490]  I said on a podcast this weekend, Patrick, Bet David, that I think that if Trump keeps
[01:17:44.490 --> 01:17:47.290]  winning and all these indictments don't work, they will try to kill him.
[01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:49.530]  Well, they've had Democrats say they want to kill him.
[01:17:49.530 --> 01:17:51.610]  It doesn't mean I believe he'll be killed.
[01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:53.690]  It's not Alex Jones predicts he'll be killed.
[01:17:53.690 --> 01:17:56.570]  But obviously, assassination is something they did to JFK.
[01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:59.450]  They did it to RFK Jr.'s dad.
[01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:01.050]  RFK Jr.'s worried about being killed.
[01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:05.610]  To think that there aren't leftists wanting to kill the president, or if we've seen the
[01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:09.290]  deep states say we're going to take him out, I'm really concerned about Trump because they
[01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:13.130]  keep failing with all their impeachments and all their hoaxes and all their indictments,
[01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:14.410]  but they just keep doubling down.
[01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:16.090]  And where does that logically lead?
[01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:17.850]  Chimay Nugent, what's your take on that?
[01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:21.450]  Well, if he wasn't such a threat, do you think they'd even try that?
[01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:24.330]  And you know, there have been attempts before on his life.
[01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:29.290]  And when we had dinner with him at the White House, it was just an amazing, you know, Ted
[01:18:29.290 --> 01:18:30.410]  likes to say shit kicker.
[01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:32.730]  Can I say that here on your show, shit kicker?
[01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:33.230]  Sure.
[01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:37.210]  It was just it was an amazing opportunity to get to know him.
[01:18:37.210 --> 01:18:39.370]  We've been with him for many times.
[01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:41.530]  And Ted has has played the national anthem.
[01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:45.930]  He just did at the Lincoln celebration in Michigan.
[01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:52.570]  And he likes to say that right after he performed the national anthem, it was just on Sunday,
[01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:57.210]  right after he played the national anthem before President Trump came on, they lost
[01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:57.690]  power.
[01:18:57.690 --> 01:18:58.809]  There was a bad storm there.
[01:18:58.809 --> 01:19:02.090]  But Ted likes to say that it was because of him that they lost power.
[01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:07.130]  But, you know, now more than ever, like you said just a moment ago, Alex, there's no
[01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.930]  perfect candidate.
[01:19:07.930 --> 01:19:09.370]  There's no perfect human being.
[01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:14.490]  If they weren't concerned about President Trump, do you think they would be attacking
[01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:15.050]  him so much?
[01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.610]  And you know what?
[01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:16.889]  I don't know if you've said this before.
[01:19:16.889 --> 01:19:19.370]  I listen to a lot of your podcasts, watch a lot of your shows.
[01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:21.450]  I'm going to say it right here.
[01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:24.490]  And so maybe you can attribute to me if it actually does happen.
[01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:26.330]  You know what I think would be a great ticket?
[01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:29.370]  Tell me.
[01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:30.250]  Trump Kennedy.
[01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:32.330]  Just saying.
[01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:33.450]  Oh, I've been set up.
[01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:34.730]  Have you had a great idea?
[01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.850]  I have said it.
[01:19:37.930 --> 01:19:42.170]  But I mean, I think that's a common sense thing, because they're going to steal the
[01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:43.050]  nomination from Kennedy.
[01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:45.930]  They stole it from Bernie Sanders, who was a terrible guy, but he did win it.
[01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:47.930]  I mean, they publicly said, we're not giving you the electors.
[01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:50.170]  And they're going to try that.
[01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:54.650]  And so if Kennedy swung his support over to Trump, once he's basically, you know, gone
[01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:59.130]  through the first primaries, because they're saying in Iowa and New Hampshire, where they're
[01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:03.210]  supposed to have the democratization, as you know, of the most popular person winning that
[01:20:03.210 --> 01:20:07.770]  straw poll, they're not going to let them do that this coming year to try to suppress
[01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:08.330]  Kennedy.
[01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:10.730]  So I think that would be an amazing move.
[01:20:10.730 --> 01:20:15.050]  The most important thing that we can do right now as patriots, a lot of people ask me, ask
[01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:16.650]  Ted, ask you, I'm sure.
[01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:18.090]  What can we do?
[01:20:18.090 --> 01:20:20.090]  We know the last election was stolen.
[01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:22.969]  What can we do to prevent it from happening again?
[01:20:22.969 --> 01:20:27.610]  The most important thing, I think, is for us to get involved in local politics, local
[01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:29.690]  elections, get on the school board.
[01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:32.010]  And when you see something, say something.
[01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:39.050]  You know, in Waco, Texas, we had a drag queen story time where they were thrusting half
[01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:41.130]  naked men in front of children.
[01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:42.490]  And you know what, Alex?
[01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:44.010]  We found out about it.
[01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:49.530]  We saw the flyer and the company that cleans our pool was actually sponsoring that event.
[01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:52.010]  So we called them up and we said, guess what?
[01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:54.090]  We're not going to utilize your services anymore.
[01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:55.130]  And they hung up on us.
[01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:57.530]  But that's where we need to get involved.
[01:20:57.530 --> 01:20:59.530]  When you see something, say something.
[01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:04.330]  And it starts with everybody doing what they can do.
[01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:05.850]  Not everybody can be an Alex Jones.
[01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:09.370]  Not everybody can be a Ted Nugent and or President Trump.
[01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:11.130]  But we need to get involved.
[01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:13.690]  God is calling you for such a time as this.
[01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:16.010]  Absolutely.
[01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:16.969]  Shemaine Nugent.
[01:21:16.969 --> 01:21:17.530]  Wow.
[01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:22.650]  And just expanding on that, it's not just the boycott power, but I've gotten in my own
[01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:24.170]  life like this with my wife and family.
[01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:28.730]  I go, look, we got to go through every company we use from pool cleaners to you name it.
[01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:31.530]  And we got to make sure they're at least not communist.
[01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:35.770]  We got to see what they're giving to because they have their own ESG system out of the
[01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:41.610]  UN and BlackRock that is going to track us through the computers and penalize us because
[01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:45.290]  we're Christian, we're populist, we're just not communist.
[01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:46.490]  We got to battle that.
[01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:51.129]  But we have our own ESG where we do not support globalist companies.
[01:21:51.129 --> 01:21:52.490]  Sometimes you can't help it.
[01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:53.610]  You need a digital camera.
[01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:55.370]  All of them are globalist owned.
[01:21:56.170 --> 01:21:57.530]  You need to fly internationally.
[01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:58.410]  They control all that.
[01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:02.250]  But when it comes to everything else, anybody that supports this evil, they're trying to
[01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:02.650]  bully us.
[01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:03.850]  They're trying to bankrupt us.
[01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:04.969]  We just don't support them.
[01:22:04.969 --> 01:22:07.210]  We were in the world, but not of the world.
[01:22:07.210 --> 01:22:09.049]  And but then there's the boycott.
[01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:11.129]  People need to get your book and share it with others.
[01:22:11.129 --> 01:22:12.889]  You need to support InfoWars.
[01:22:12.889 --> 01:22:17.129]  People need to I mean, people don't know this because, you know, you guys haven't complained
[01:22:17.129 --> 01:22:23.129]  a lot, but had and you've obviously lost 20, 30, 40 million dollars a year by all the big
[01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:26.650]  booking companies saying, no, we know you're a hot ticket.
[01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.170]  We're not going to let you be in our arenas.
[01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:29.770]  We're not going to even, you know, do that.
[01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:33.930]  But still, you go around the country at, you know, giant public arenas and fill them up.
[01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:36.730]  But you have paid an incredible price.
[01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:39.610]  I paid an incredible price, but it's worth it to pay that price.
[01:22:39.610 --> 01:22:44.250]  But instead of us being persecuted and the Christians and conservatives being isolated,
[01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:48.490]  we need to be prosperous and support each other and build our own infrastructure and
[01:22:48.490 --> 01:22:49.450]  our own communities.
[01:22:49.450 --> 01:22:52.490]  They got Clinton documents when they first got into the 90s.
[01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:56.570]  And they said our main fear is conservatives and Christians will build their own economy
[01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:58.889]  and build their own media and build their own entertainment.
[01:22:58.889 --> 01:23:03.530]  But look at how the Christian movies now are the most profitable and Hollywood's collapsing.
[01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:05.450]  So it's already begun.
[01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:07.770]  And this is how we're going to beat them, in my view.
[01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:10.090]  Can you talk about boycotts and boycotts?
[01:23:10.650 --> 01:23:11.930]  Absolutely.
[01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:16.969]  You know, Ted went through a string of those a couple of years ago when his booking agent
[01:23:16.969 --> 01:23:18.570]  wanted to cancel him.
[01:23:18.570 --> 01:23:20.490]  And now he's on his last tour.
[01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:25.210]  And I promise you, a lot of people have said, OK, you know, Garth Brooks or Kiss, whatever,
[01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:28.490]  they've had a last tour for 10 or 20 years, I think.
[01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:30.650]  But this is Ted's last tour.
[01:23:30.650 --> 01:23:36.250]  So if you want to see him for the last time on a public tour, you can go to TedNugent.com
[01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.129]  and grab your tickets.
[01:23:37.129 --> 01:23:38.969]  And there are backstage passes available.
[01:23:38.969 --> 01:23:41.450]  They're called danger zone tickets.
[01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:44.090]  And the reason being, it's not because he doesn't love the music.
[01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:45.290]  He loves the music.
[01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:46.330]  You know that.
[01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:47.610]  It's just the travel.
[01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:49.129]  And you know about that as well.
[01:23:49.129 --> 01:23:51.049]  We want to stay home with our dogs.
[01:23:51.049 --> 01:23:56.730]  We want to stay in the comforts of our home and our community and our garden.
[01:23:56.730 --> 01:23:57.530]  We have our own.
[01:23:57.530 --> 01:24:00.410]  I got you some lavender here, Alex.
[01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:03.610]  Lavender and mint and basil from my garden.
[01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:04.090]  I can't.
[01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:07.290]  I mean, it's like I wish you had smell-o-vision because you can smell it.
[01:24:07.290 --> 01:24:08.250]  It's amazing.
[01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:12.650]  But I've learned from you from watching your shows for the years over the years that you
[01:24:12.650 --> 01:24:18.730]  are a big proponent of living off the land and becoming responsible stewards of this
[01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:20.570]  ground as Ted and I are.
[01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:25.530]  And I've never been more proud to be a bow hunter because we don't have to worry about
[01:24:25.530 --> 01:24:30.650]  going to the store and buying meat or getting our vegetables or our herbs and being afraid
[01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:33.530]  of what they are fed up with chemicals and steroids.
[01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:34.730]  We live off the land.
[01:24:34.730 --> 01:24:37.690]  And that's where more of your audience needs to go to.
[01:24:37.690 --> 01:24:43.930]  They need to go to Infowars.com, Infowarsstore.com and get your products because we need to support
[01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:44.490]  one another.
[01:24:44.490 --> 01:24:50.410]  We need to uplift each other and do the boycott by products that you know and love that are
[01:24:50.410 --> 01:24:56.650]  made in America and support your idols and your ideology and this great country.
[01:24:58.330 --> 01:24:58.969]  Absolutely.
[01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:02.490]  And just expanding on that, the enemy is more afraid of that than anything.
[01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:07.370]  That's why they did the lockdowns of small businesses and churches and things because
[01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:09.129]  they're literally at war with us.
[01:25:09.129 --> 01:25:10.809]  This is everything.
[01:25:10.809 --> 01:25:14.090]  And also, I know that you and Ted do interviews every day.
[01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:17.450]  You do your own shows, talking to you guys before.
[01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:22.170]  Cutting back on the music, even though that's the real love, is you guys are not going to
[01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:25.610]  slow down on fighting for America and the world against the globalists.
[01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:27.290]  You're going to accelerate that.
[01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:29.129]  What another major sacrifice.
[01:25:29.129 --> 01:25:29.610]  You know what?
[01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:33.850]  I've learned one thing from Ted and that's you can criticize him all you want.
[01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:35.770]  It actually adds fuel to his fire.
[01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:39.690]  Last year, I had a pretty serious death threat, had a couple of them.
[01:25:39.690 --> 01:25:43.049]  And I know you probably get them hourly, if not daily.
[01:25:43.049 --> 01:25:48.250]  And it kind of paused me for a minute like, wow, do I even need to go here or go there?
[01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:51.450]  And then I had some people tell me, you're a target.
[01:25:51.450 --> 01:25:57.690]  You're going to be known for not who you are as Ted Nugent's wife, but who you are
[01:25:57.690 --> 01:25:58.969]  as a child of God.
[01:25:58.969 --> 01:26:02.250]  And I said just a second ago about supporting idols.
[01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:04.330]  There's only one idol support to support.
[01:26:04.330 --> 01:26:06.889]  And that's Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior.
[01:26:06.889 --> 01:26:08.730]  And I think that's what we need to get back to.
[01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:12.410]  That's what I see you talking about a lot in your podcast as well.
[01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:15.290]  Absolutely.
[01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:19.770]  Let's talk about a really central issue when we go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:26:19.770 --> 01:26:20.410]  I want to come back.
[01:26:21.450 --> 01:26:28.570]  What you expect to happen in the next 15, 16 months out of this next election and what
[01:26:28.570 --> 01:26:32.889]  you expect to see in Congress and McCarthy finally with enough pressure on him saying
[01:26:32.889 --> 01:26:34.650]  they're looking at the impeachment of Biden.
[01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:40.410]  They're looking at the impeachment of the Attorney General.
[01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:44.570]  And whether that's a good idea or not, should we have hearings and expose them
[01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:48.969]  for the election or is trying to impeach them, turning them into victims?
[01:26:48.969 --> 01:26:50.410]  I think justice be done.
[01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:54.809]  May the heavens fall and just go ahead and go after them all because it's the right thing
[01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:55.129]  to do.
[01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:56.170]  The border is wide open.
[01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:57.290]  They're human smuggling.
[01:26:57.370 --> 01:26:58.410]  We have all the witnesses.
[01:26:59.290 --> 01:27:01.690]  But is that a favor getting rid of Biden?
[01:27:01.690 --> 01:27:04.090]  And then it's a Gavin Newsom or Big Mike.
[01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:08.090]  We're going to play this clip, go to break and then come back and get your take on it.
[01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:14.250]  But here's Kevin McCarthy, House Speaker, says he will start implementing the beginning
[01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:20.010]  of the investigation and the committee hearings on the impeachment of the Attorney General.
[01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:22.170]  If anybody deserves it, it's Merrick Garland.
[01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:23.129]  Here's the clip.
[01:27:23.129 --> 01:27:30.410]  Miranda Devine says that Joe Biden met with his business partners 12 times, 12 different
[01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:32.250]  times and 12 different deals, perhaps.
[01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:35.370]  So it's called, you know, Rob Walker, who was in on all this stuff.
[01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:35.930]  Good friend.
[01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:38.410]  He's all over all over the laptop.
[01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:42.170]  So will this prompt you to do a impeachment inquiry?
[01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:47.770]  Well, you apparently don't follow me on Twitter because yesterday I laid out very, very clearly
[01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:53.610]  by July 6th, because of the allegations from the IRS, because of the whistleblowers and
[01:27:53.610 --> 01:27:59.530]  the DOJ are Garland, what he is saying and what David Weiss are saying privately are
[01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:00.410]  two different things.
[01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:00.730]  Right.
[01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:05.049]  And if it comes true, what the IRS whistleblower is saying, we're going to start impeachment
[01:28:05.049 --> 01:28:06.490]  inquiries on the attorney general.
[01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:09.450]  Well, all right.
[01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:12.809]  We're going to come back after break and talk about this.
[01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:14.570]  And of course, what the whistleblowers are saying are true.
[01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:19.290]  We have one of the whistleblowers with us next hour after Chimane Nugent leaves us in
[01:28:19.290 --> 01:28:19.850]  30 minutes.
[01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:23.210]  We got 30 minutes left with the amazing Chimane Nugent straight ahead.
[01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:24.650]  Chimane Nugent rocks.
[01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:25.610]  Not dot com.
[01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:28.090]  Chimane Nugent dot rocks.
[01:28:28.090 --> 01:28:29.370]  Not hard to remember.
[01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:31.049]  Chimane Nugent dot rocks.
[01:28:31.049 --> 01:28:35.610]  All the hunting shows, all the gardening shows, the exercise shows, the stretching shows.
[01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:37.290]  This lady is a genius.
[01:28:37.290 --> 01:28:38.969]  She's on fire for freedom.
[01:28:38.969 --> 01:28:39.770]  Check it out today.
[01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:42.250]  Chimane Nugent dot rocks.
[01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:42.889]  We'll be back.
[01:28:42.889 --> 01:28:43.370]  Don't forget.
[01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:44.490]  Our websites are banned.
[01:28:44.490 --> 01:28:45.770]  Video and infowars.com.
[01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:48.330]  But they blocked those URL on Twitter and many other places.
[01:28:48.330 --> 01:28:51.850]  But Mad Max World on screen and Max World TV.
[01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:55.210]  One word leads you to our full video site and links and everything.
[01:28:55.210 --> 01:28:56.410]  It's a clone of the other side.
[01:28:56.410 --> 01:28:57.290]  The exact same site.
[01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:58.090]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:58.090 --> 01:29:02.809]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:29:02.809 --> 01:29:04.809]  We want to have all the best brands.
[01:29:04.809 --> 01:29:06.809]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:29:06.809 --> 01:29:09.290]  So I get constant questions online in person.
[01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:10.170]  Hey, what's better?
[01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:10.969]  Knockout.
[01:29:10.969 --> 01:29:11.610]  What's better?
[01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:13.129]  Down and out.
[01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.690]  What's better?
[01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:15.850]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.570]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:20.969]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:23.930]  So one person might like this coffee.
[01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:25.530]  Another person likes that coffee.
[01:29:25.530 --> 01:29:26.889]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:29:26.889 --> 01:29:28.090]  They're all very diverse.
[01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:32.570]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years
[01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:38.410]  that people love and sold for a lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.

[01:30:06.969 --> 01:30:11.210]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:12.969]  These are amazing products.
[01:30:12.969 --> 01:30:15.210]  And for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:19.930]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes, only lasts three hours with no hangover.
[01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:21.290]  It is a game changer.
[01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:22.969]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[01:30:22.969 --> 01:30:26.889]  Then our Brain Force Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[01:30:26.889 --> 01:30:31.690]  Gives you four to six hours of amazing energy, again, with no hangover, no jitters.

[01:30:35.770 --> 01:30:37.530]  And it funds the Infowar.

[01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:44.010]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:44.010 --> 01:30:49.610]  And know, you're funding the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:52.889]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:30:52.889 --> 01:30:55.290]  And the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[01:30:58.330 --> 01:31:04.170]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:04.670]  supply.
[01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:10.250]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:14.250]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:17.129]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:31:17.129 --> 01:31:20.410]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:31:20.410 --> 01:31:25.930]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally

[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.280]  Whether you spread the word, whether you pray for us, whether you buy the product, whether

[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.280]  Now that everybody knows we were right, a lot of folks are like, well, I'll just lay back
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.280]  now that it's all out in the open.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280]  No, we've got to fight even harder now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.280]  Thank you for your support.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:52.280]  We have delivered on every front, thanks to God and thanks to you.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:36:08.280]  I need your help to keep fighting, take action, make the decision now, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:12.040]  Going back to Shemay Nugent in the Austin studios, I don't want to call it awkward,
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.040]  it's kind of cool.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.040]  I'm in Florida, she's in the studios.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:19.200]  I was supposed to be back yesterday, about to visit my wife's father, who's in the hospital
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.200]  in Nebraska.
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:23.800]  We leave tomorrow, but I'll be on air once I'm there, folks.
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.320]  But going back to Shemay Nugent, what do you make of McCarthy?
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:31.080]  Should we go for impeachment, or is he so weak he makes them look bad?
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.080]  Don't.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:38.200]  Don't interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves, to quote Napoleon Bonaparte.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:43.480]  What is your view just on the whole shenanigan fiascos of them, all these indictments, and
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:49.480]  he only goes up in the polls, national Gallup polls, and other scientific polls.
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:55.639]  He's getting upwards of 70% in the Republican field, 25, 30 points ahead of Biden, 35 points
[01:36:55.639 --> 01:36:56.639]  ahead of DeSantis.
[01:36:56.639 --> 01:36:58.800]  I mean, Trump is just slamming it.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.639]  Since the history of polling in the last 100 years, we've never seen numbers of popularity
[01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:03.639]  at this level.
[01:37:03.639 --> 01:37:07.280]  Not even FDR during World War II was slamming numbers like this.
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.160]  Yeah, they stole the last one, clearly, but I'm told by the experts, if there's a massive
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:17.440]  red tsunami, they don't have enough dead people and enough fraud to put it over the top.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.440]  What does Shemay Nugent think about that?
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:23.599]  Well, every day, I'm just getting, my neck is really sore because I'm constantly shaking
[01:37:23.599 --> 01:37:24.599]  my head.
[01:37:24.599 --> 01:37:30.639]  We forgot about what happened in Afghanistan, and meanwhile, you know, we're suddenly supporting
[01:37:30.639 --> 01:37:33.960]  a war in Ukraine, which we have no business doing.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.960]  We need to take care of our veterans first.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.719]  We need to take care of our own people first.
[01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:40.380]  We've got an open border.
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:45.580]  Our country has been infiltrated, and if you look at any of the video of the young men,
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:49.980]  the military-age fighting men coming across the border, that should have many people shaking
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:51.340]  in their boots.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:52.980]  What is going on here?
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:55.420]  McCarthy, you know, God bless him.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:38:00.820]  I don't really know what the ultimate endgame is for him, but he is making some headway.
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:06.480]  You know, if he goes after Biden, let's say they go to impeach Biden, doesn't that lend
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:13.440]  credibility to the fact that Biden was elected president?
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:22.360]  No, I mean, I really respect him, Gigi, and she's been fighting with Boebert people.
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:27.360]  I'm nothing against Boebert, but I mean, I'm friends with him, Gigi, and I've seen her
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:32.040]  be right over and over again, and she says that she thinks McCarthy's right, that we
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.200]  should at least have more hearings and expose them that way.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.040]  They've got to get all their ducks in a row, and then they can probably impeach him.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.040]  It needs to be done.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.240]  I'm the type of guy that's like, hey, it's the right thing to do.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:45.519]  Do it over the border, over Afghanistan, but at the end of the day, I respect him, T.G.,
[01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:48.360]  and you just raised that point there, so I think this is something we should have a
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.360]  debate about.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:56.120]  Yeah, and we should question why they're going after President Trump so immensely, everything
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.120]  he does.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:00.760]  You know, they raided Mar-a-Lago first, and it was a big deal, and then when they raided
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:03.799]  the Biden residences, it's not such a big deal.
[01:39:03.799 --> 01:39:09.280]  So they arrest Hunter, they're trying to arrest President Trump over and over and over.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:13.719]  They got a whole slew of arrest warrants for him, and it makes you wonder, what are they
[01:39:13.719 --> 01:39:15.280]  really going after?
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:20.080]  They want to see him in prison, like you said, they want to see that mugshot, and they don't
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:24.960]  want him to run for president again, which we all know what's really going on there,
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.519]  but I think that what the Republicans were doing, you know, it wasn't the red wave that
[01:39:29.519 --> 01:39:32.679]  everybody talked about, but we are making progress.
[01:39:32.679 --> 01:39:38.480]  And what I want everybody to think about is, you know, if Hunter Biden has had the
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:43.160]  last name of Trump, what would be going on with his arrest right now?
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:47.400]  What would be going on with, and he shows up at a State Department dinner, and it was
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:53.559]  unbelievable that he has the gall, and Biden has the gall to bring his son there for that.
[01:39:53.559 --> 01:39:58.240]  I just don't understand it.
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:04.400]  I don't understand it either, but that's why we have to have a larger discussion about
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.920]  this.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:10.400]  I know you talked to the President quite a bit, at least I know you did in the past.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.080]  I've been told by a lot of folks who've talked to him quite a bit, that he is stronger now
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.540]  and more determined than ever, and that really makes me be proud of President Trump.
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:21.840]  But even though I'm mad at him about the shots and things like that, he's pigheaded and won't
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.639]  admit he's wrong, the fact that he was elected, we know they stole it, and now they're trying
[01:40:26.639 --> 01:40:32.000]  to take our right to vote for him away by falsely indicting him, and the polls show
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.960]  people see through that, this is who the people elected.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:38.519]  So even if I didn't think he was the best guy, I think he is a good guy, I would support
[01:40:38.519 --> 01:40:42.639]  him now because this is the deep state trying to take the person America elected away.
[01:40:42.639 --> 01:40:47.000]  It's very simple, I'm 100% behind Trump, that's made me really understand that I need to support
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  him.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.200]  Isn't it interesting that before the election, Kamala Harris and Biden and all the Democrats
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:57.719]  were against a President Trump vaccine, but suddenly since they pushed it forward with
[01:40:57.719 --> 01:41:02.320]  Operation Warp Speed, where there's another theory about why he did that, I'm with you,
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.440]  I'm not happy about that.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.240]  We all know what happened with that, there are millions of people who have died because
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:13.920]  of blood clots and because of the shot, I don't even want to call it a shot, the jab,
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:21.440]  whatever, but it's amazing to me that people are getting away with murder, and they're
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:27.240]  not being called upon, like Fauci's got his own TV show now, and he's going to be teaching
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.000]  college courses.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.320]  Why isn't he in jail?
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.599]  I don't understand.
[01:41:33.599 --> 01:41:37.519]  Well I totally agree with you, and Senator Paul did call out Trump last week, and say
[01:41:37.519 --> 01:41:42.240]  why isn't he going after Fauci more, why didn't he go after Fauci, well Rand Paul went along
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.679]  with the shots too, and I like Rand Paul, but let's not, that's really a cheap shot by
[01:41:45.679 --> 01:41:50.240]  Rand Paul, and I'm not trying to be the guy that calls it, and I'm not attacking Rand
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.080]  Paul, but he needs to come out against the shots too.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:42:01.160]  Nobody in the government is coming out against the shots, and I think what is going for President
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:07.480]  Trump, he never made it mandatory, he said if you want it, take it, but we need to have
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:11.880]  some more exposure about what's going on, it seems like only your show and a few others
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.380]  are talking about the side effects of what really happened.
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:20.820]  We need to get back control of mainstream media, and you know, it's MSN, mainstream
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:28.019]  news lies, and it's really unfortunate that it's divided, and again, going back to spirituality,
[01:42:28.019 --> 01:42:33.679]  spiritual warfare, Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy, and divide us, and that's exactly
[01:42:33.679 --> 01:42:39.340]  what they're doing with racism, and trying to divide us, and pit father against son,
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:44.460]  and neighbor against neighbor, and that's not who we are, Alex.
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:51.059]  I totally agree, incredible, Shemay Nugent, stay there, and we've got Rocco Nugent, straight
[01:42:51.059 --> 01:42:54.940]  ahead, he, I've seen him on TV, a really smart fella, we'll talk to him straight ahead, stay
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:56.179]  with us.
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:03.019]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:43:03.019 --> 01:43:08.219]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at infowarestore.com.
[01:43:08.219 --> 01:43:13.380]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:18.139]  supplement maker that are Lister's and Patriot's, that are allowing us to private label it at
[01:43:18.139 --> 01:43:20.580]  a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:24.700]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:30.620]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain, and to also make
[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:35.580]  your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated, and are
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:37.620]  more inductive to pain.
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:39.900]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:47.019]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWars MD and Nerve Renew from InfoWars MD exclusively
[01:43:47.019 --> 01:43:50.099]  at infowarestore.com right now.
[01:43:50.099 --> 01:43:55.299]  Introducing them both, 25% off, you'll find them exclusively at infowarestore.com, and
[01:43:55.299 --> 01:43:58.340]  they fund their operation.
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:04.620]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:05.740]  the atmosphere.
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:08.500]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:14.900]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:19.340]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:24.139]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to
[01:44:24.139 --> 01:44:25.219]  dispose of it.
[01:44:25.219 --> 01:44:30.179]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[01:44:30.179 --> 01:44:33.660]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:40.179]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:44:40.179 --> 01:44:42.540]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:47.820]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:54.260]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:58.219]  Available now at infowarestore.com.
[01:44:58.219 --> 01:45:02.099]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reese of The

[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:32.660]  Absolutely.
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:37.700]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:42.380]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?

[01:45:59.299 --> 01:46:04.260]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:06.400]  We made it even stronger.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:11.980]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, Turbo Force is back in stock
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:17.059]  at infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:17.059 --> 01:46:23.580]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours, should be
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:25.219]  called 10-hour energy.
[01:46:25.219 --> 01:46:30.660]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:35.820]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:36.820]  it.
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:40.219]  It is the super fuel.
[01:46:40.219 --> 01:46:41.700]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:42.700]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:43.700]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:47.580]  They go good with this, but this is the King Kong.
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:48.980]  This is the boss.
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:53.540]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, infowarestore.com.
[01:46:53.540 --> 01:47:00.740]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:06.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:29.620]  Well, time flies when you're fired up for freedom and learning a lot, and it's our final
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:33.620]  segment with Shemaine Nugent, and I asked her since her son was, you know, bringing
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:34.620]  her in today.
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:39.900]  You know, they're taking care of mom to drag Rocco in and to get his take on just the world
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:43.520]  in general and being such a big part of your TV shows and programs, what you guys are doing
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:48.540]  to get people self-sufficient in bow hunting and hunting and gardening.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:51.180]  It's so important what you guys do.
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:52.260]  You said, I do that.
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:54.740]  I tell people they should do it, but I'm not really good at it.
[01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:56.820]  I mean, I'm okay at hunting, but not the other stuff.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:59.980]  I do some gardening and things, but you guys are really front and center on that.
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:05.780]  And then Kyle Serafin, folks, is a gigantic whistleblower from the FBI on the government
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:11.140]  branding Christians and conservatives as terrorists on the pipe bomb and a bunch.
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:13.100]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:15.220]  He's testified to Congress, all of it.
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:17.100]  He's joining us next hour.
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:21.060]  But Shemaine introduced our audience for folks that don't know him, Rocco.
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:26.700]  Well, my number one bestselling book on Amazon in two different categories, Killer House.
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:32.100]  I talk about the story of recovering and remediating from toxic mold.
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:36.180]  And really it's both of our journeys of finding health.
[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:38.180]  Rocco writes a little bit in this book as well.
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:43.460]  So I wanted to bring him in and talk about his journey for health and wellness as well.
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:46.340]  Yeah, I'm honored to be here.
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:51.340]  And Alex, as you got it, I'm just supporting my mom and her mission.
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:54.100]  I see how God is just calling her card.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:58.300]  We have this last name and people usually know what that means.
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:02.860]  But her calling is the health and the wellness sector and her spiritual journey started with
[01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:05.980]  our home basically being taken from us.
[01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:10.420]  And I grew up in that environment, but I saw my mom get a master's degree in metaphysics
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:15.700]  and I saw my dad ride a buffalo with a guitar in his hand.
[01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:20.100]  So I'm somewhere in the middle of that, long story short.
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:22.420]  Well, people need to read the book.
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:23.820]  In fact, please leave a copy.
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:25.260]  I've been intending to get it and read it.
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:27.380]  Where do people get the book, Hiller House?
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:30.980]  It's number one in two categories on Amazon.
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:36.140]  And I would like to get this message out about this book because I do believe that many people
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:41.780]  are needlessly taking medication and it's really causing more harm than good.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:47.700]  And if we get back to our roots, our roots, our health, living off the land.
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:49.100]  And that's what this book talks about.
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:55.540]  I go into some detail about the alternative medicine that I used or functional medicine.
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:59.100]  Now they call it like infrared sauna, vitamin IVs and oxygen.
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.140]  I was doing that 20 years ago, Alex.
[01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:02.980]  So I talk all about those things.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:06.180]  And here's a big one that people don't think about.
[01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:10.940]  Getting rid of chemical cleaners, getting rid of downy fabric softener, getting rid
[01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:11.940]  of potpourri.
[01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:17.940]  I can walk into a room and tell if it's freshly painted with volatile organic compound paint,
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:20.300]  low VOC or no VOC.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:22.580]  I've become the canary in a coal mine.
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:27.220]  And Rocco grew up with me kind of hovering, the hover mom.
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:28.220]  Don't eat a hot dog.
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:29.220]  Oh my gosh.
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:30.220]  You don't know what's in that.
[01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:37.940]  So now he's on an incredible journey of sharing his health with his demographic and age group.
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:38.940]  Would you be in my way?
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:42.300]  I don't want to just go ahead.
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:45.380]  I don't want to just glaze over this because this really should have been front and center
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:46.940]  in the whole hour today.
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:49.740]  Because I know this stuff, but I'm not good at remembering to stay out of it.
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:50.740]  I'm a tough man.
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.780]  I'm just going to do whatever.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.780]  But I'm not really.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:56.860]  And the truth is, the globalists admit they're hitting us with the chemicals in the food
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:51:00.800]  and water on purpose, the chemicals that are in the construction materials.
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:02.660]  This stuff is everywhere.
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:08.020]  And they're allowing it all to destroy us while banning carbon dioxide, while banning
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:14.180]  wood-fired stoves or charcoal-fired pizza ovens or gas-powered stoves, saying they're
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:15.180]  toxic.
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:16.180]  I know a gas-powered stove.
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.180]  They've done the studies.
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:19.060]  It puts nothing off the carbon dioxide.
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:23.780]  And so here is California banning, trying to ban coal-powered stuff.
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:26.780]  Now even in the pizzerias, New York's doing it.
[01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:28.780]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:29.780]  Extraordinary.
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:33.300]  New York cracks down on wood-fired pizzas to cut carbon emissions.
[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:34.660]  We exhale carbon dioxide.
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:35.900]  We are the carbon.
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:36.900]  They want to cut.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:37.900]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:44.460]  So they let all the toxins, the bisphenol A, the glyphosate, the atrazine hit us.
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:45.740]  Don't tell people to filter their water.
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:47.740]  Almost all water supplies have it.
[01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:49.900]  And then say, I'm a cook for telling people to filter.
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:53.260]  They have just a little bit of arsenic in the public water systems.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:56.700]  It's okay, isn't it, Alex?
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:57.700]  It's just a little bit of radon.
[01:51:57.700 --> 01:51:59.540]  It's a little bit of radioactive isotope.
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:00.940]  And there's just a little bit of chemtrails.
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:04.020]  Do you know that they put mold in chemtrails as well?
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:07.100]  And the 5G, they are slowly trying to kill us.
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:10.580]  And that's what I talk about in this book, Killer House.
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:13.380]  Is the air in your home killing you?
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:16.260]  And is the air outside that we're breathing?
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:19.300]  We need to clean our air, soil, and water.
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:24.140]  And I'm so glad that Rocco's here on this journey with me to share with his demographic
[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:26.420]  and his age group about what has happened.
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:29.540]  This is a lot bigger than just the mold.
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:30.580]  Look at the movie.
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:36.100]  Look at the movie with, what's his name, Interstellar, where mold takes over and kills
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:37.940]  the earth because it's in the atmosphere.
[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:40.780]  And the globalists are doing all sorts of crazy stuff.
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:42.980]  Rocco, I know you don't like to get political.
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:43.980]  But I've watched you.
[01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:44.980]  I've read your stuff.
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:45.980]  You're really a dialed-in guy.
[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.100]  And I think we've talked before about some stuff.
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:52.740]  But the point is, is that, what is it like to be the son of Shemaine and Ted Nugent?
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:55.700]  And what is it like to see everything your dad and mom warned of coming true, but see
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:57.860]  humanity wake up and battle it?
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:02.860]  You know, it's stressful when you're early because it's a smaller group to belong to.
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:04.860]  And I know you know what that feels like.
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:09.580]  And I found this book called, it's by Ayn Rand, called The Fountainhead.
[01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:14.420]  And it helped me understand my family a little bit more because it's a lonely place when
[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:22.540]  you get away from herd mentality and you put your health and your connection to spirit,
[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:24.940]  your connection to God first and foremost.
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:28.300]  And I live in the shamanic space a lot.
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:29.420]  I'm a coach and a teacher.
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:35.660]  I help people understand what Christ consciousness is from a Raja and Kriya yoga background.
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:36.820]  And sometimes that's through trauma.
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:41.020]  And sometimes that's through the wellness that we access through nutrition.
[01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:46.060]  And I see metaphor speak so loudly, sometimes more directly than plain English and plain
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:47.140]  language.
[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:52.860]  And mold is kind of what, in my family, my mom woke up through this situation.
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:54.780]  But how does mold happen?
[01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:57.940]  It's when water doesn't flow properly.
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.060]  And look at the country.
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:00.060]  Look at the culture.
[01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:04.260]  Look at all the stagnation and look at where things have stopped working.
[01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:07.260]  The consciousness is killing us.
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:08.260]  The air in your home is killing us.
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:09.260]  The consciousness is the swamp.
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:10.260]  The swamp, yeah.
[01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:12.380]  You're saying we're becoming a swamp.
[01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:13.380]  Yeah.
[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:18.460]  So, I mean, I'll go political, but I can't help but notice that the political has roots
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:19.460]  somewhere.
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:23.140]  And you got to talk about the roots if you want to, you know, otherwise you're just going
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:25.180]  to be snipping all the weeds nonstop.
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:29.460]  But I saw my mom go through a near-death experience with health.
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:33.760]  I saw my dad, you know, be on these front lines all the time and speaking about all these
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:34.760]  touch points.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:39.040]  And ultimately it would come back to his connection to nature, his connection to spirituality
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:40.840]  and his ability to express himself.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:43.160]  It relies on his health and his wellness.
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:47.680]  Now he's just a rare cookie, but my mom really emphasized the connection to Christ being
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:52.360]  super, super necessary for you to be able to do anything well in the world.
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:57.280]  And I feel like what you help spotlight so well and what my family is passionate about
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:03.520]  in spotlighting is that culture constantly takes us away from that inner dwelling space
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:08.440]  where we meet God, where our sense of I am meets the Creator.
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:13.980]  And so all the stuff where we get brought out of ourself into the world and we start
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:19.240]  dissecting how we identify and then it's like a competition war of identities.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:25.360]  But we talk about health, wellness, and the space that you're living in as it must be
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:26.360]  clean.
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:27.360]  You have to be clean.
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.960]  You have to do the checks and balances on your home first before you go out into the world
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:30.960]  and try to do that.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:35.800]  I saw Jordan Peterson talk about this really nice intellectual breakdown, the philosophical
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:42.280]  differences between conservativism and liberal polarities and the idea of the socialism or
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:47.760]  the communism or the very left-leaning idea of go out in the world and fix everybody else.
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.160]  It leans on group thought as opposed to the conservative, from what I gather, it focuses
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.620]  on why should you be telling anybody else how to work their life if you don't have your
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:55:58.000]  shit together?
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  Get your shit together.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:05.160]  I watched my mom and dad go through all kinds of stuff and my mom, it took her to her health
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:08.240]  first and foremost and she ends up educating my dad.
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.800]  He might have been in front of the family, so to speak, but all of a sudden she's like,
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:13.600]  what are you brushing your teeth with?
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.160]  You don't know what fluoride is.
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.840]  You don't know what's in that Coca-Cola or that sugary cereal.
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:20.560]  You don't know what those empty carbs are doing to you, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:25.480]  So I've been witness to a profound level of education, very privileged and identifying
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:27.160]  as an indigo kid rather early.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.040]  It was on me to find my dharma, my purpose, and how I could help my family and the greater
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:34.920]  collective come back to God, basically.
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:38.320]  All right, well, very interesting, Rocco.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.680]  Thank you so much.
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:42.280]  Where's the best place, Shemaine, for people to find the book?
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:45.240]  Obviously, Amazon, or they want to buy it directly from you, that gives you guys more
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.240]  support?
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.240]  ShemaineNugent.rocks?
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:52.320]  ShemaineNugent.rocks is a place where they can get more information, free information
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:53.320]  on toxic mold.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:56.040]  I'm starting a community of like-minded people.
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:01.200]  You got to go through an interview with me in order to get in, because I want to welcome
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.200]  people.
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:04.120]  I want to help people, but we got to be on the same level.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:07.640]  I want to make sure that my goals are aligned with your goals.
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:09.800]  So check out ShemaineNugent.rocks.
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:13.480]  Get my book on Amazon today.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:16.880]  And then last thing, Alex, next time I come on here, I'm going to talk about how FOMO
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:19.480]  is the number one killer of all human beings.
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:24.240]  FOMO disconnects us from God, and I just want to say specifically to you, thank you so much,
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:26.280]  brother, for stepping into this calling of yours.
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:30.720]  I know so many people who are not on this with you today, right now, that want me to
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:33.360]  tell you thank you, and we pray for you.
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:35.760]  Thank you, brother.
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:36.760]  Thank you, brother.
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:37.760]  Well, I need the prayer.
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:42.280]  I need people to intercede with God, because the enemy is attacking, but Christ is a trillion
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:43.280]  times more powerful.
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:44.280]  God bless you.
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.280]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.280]  Whistleblower.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:47.280]  Next hour, only minutes away.
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:48.280]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:49.280]  Thank you.
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:56.280]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters, are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:01.280]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together, or 40% off when you
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.280]  get them individually.
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:06.280]  BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra, two separate formulas.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:09.280]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:14.880]  One is a four- to six-hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown.
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.920]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula.
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:19.920]  It's BrainForce Ultra that hits really, really quick.
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:20.920]  And I love it.
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:21.920]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:24.920]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:25.920]  stay nine o'clock at night.
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.920]  I've got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview or something, and
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:31.920]  boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:35.920]  And then I get two, three hours of energy, and then you go right to bed after it.
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:40.920]  BrainForce Ultra, BrainForce Plus, both 50% off by themselves, or 40% off individually.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:41.920]  A lot of people love these products.
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:42.920]  They've got five-star reviews.
[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:44.920]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:45.920]  50% off.
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:46.920]  Infowars.
[01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:47.920]  Store.com.
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:48.920]  You wanted to plug BrainForce.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:49.920]  Do you like BrainForce?
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:50.920]  Yeah.
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:52.920]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:54.920]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:58.920]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:00.920]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:04.920]  That's because I use BrainForce every day.
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:08.920]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:12.920]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:17.920]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is BrainForce.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:21.920]  I'll take BrainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.920]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:31.920]  So it really is true that BrainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:32.920]  All right.
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:33.920]  We love you.
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:34.920]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:38.920]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at Infowars.Store.com.
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:39.920]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:47.920]  ♪♪♪
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:56.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:02.920]  ♪♪♪
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:14.920]  No adverse effects to the nose, throat, and sinuses.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:19.920]  And it comes from a doctor who's been examining a group of Chesterfield smokers
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:26.920]  as part of a program supervised by a responsible, independent research laboratory.
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.920]  Now, after a full year and four months, the doctor reports again.
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:40.920]  No adverse effects to the nose, throat, or sinuses from smoking Chesterfields.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:45.920]  A COVID-jabbed shill Peter Hotez attacks Alex Jones, claims he never took money from Big Pharma.
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:47.920]  Now, he's really jumped the shark on this one.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:49.920]  He's playing a shell game.
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:51.920]  He says, I take money from Bill Gates and the NIH.
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:53.920]  Well, that's the top.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:54.920]  They pay for policy.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:00.920]  And then the research is done, the dummy research, that they've requested, the outcome they want.
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:07.920]  And then that is given back to Big Pharma that then produces the poison
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:11.920]  and is given liability protection by the NIH and by the federal government.
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:16.920]  And then the money travels back to Bill Gates and a few other big companies
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:17.920]  and his tax-free foundation.
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:19.920]  Then he pays no taxes.
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.920]  About 10 years ago, we got approached by a group at the New York Blood Center,
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:29.920]  led by Shibu Jiang and Lan Ying Du, that had a pretty good idea for coronavirus vaccines.
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:32.920]  And at the time, nobody cared about coronavirus vaccines.
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.920]  They were sort of orphaned.
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:36.920]  And so we adopted it.
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:39.920]  What about Big Pharma being tax-exempt?
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:42.920]  And that's really what's happening here, is that Bill Gates brags,
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:45.920]  oh, I get 20 to 1 return on my vaccine investment.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:49.920]  You've invested $10 billion in vaccinations over the last two decades.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:51.920]  And you figured out the return on investment for that.
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:52.920]  And it kind of stunned me.
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:53.920]  Can you walk us through the math?
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:57.920]  It's been $100 billion overall that the world's put in.
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:01.920]  Our foundation is a bit more than $10 billion.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:04.920]  But we feel there's been over a 20 to 1 return.
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:10.920]  So if you just look at the economic benefits, that's a pretty strong number compared to anything else.
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:14.920]  Potez has a lot, when I say a lot of nerve,
[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:23.920]  I mean, he has a lot of nerve to sit up there and tell the world that I am making this up.
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:26.920]  And what do you have to say to people who think they're vaccine injured?
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:28.920]  Anything for them?
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:32.920]  I mean, do you have anything to say to people that think?
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:35.920]  Do you have anything to say to people?
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:36.920]  Yeah.
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:39.920]  I mean, do you think vaccine injuries are real, Peter?
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:40.920]  Yeah, sure.
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:43.920]  He's worth $35 million on record.
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:45.920]  That's just what he shows on his taxes.
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:46.920]  $35 million.
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:50.920]  And the man is a pediatrician who runs a children's hospital.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:52.920]  Think guinea pigs.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:54.920]  And he thinks your children should be made to take the shots.
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.920]  It's all about mask compliance.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:59.920]  That's going to be absolutely critical.
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:02.920]  Because if you don't have masks, remember, this virus aerosolizes.
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.920]  So even six feet is not enough.
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:07.920]  It can go 17, 18 feet, several meters.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:10.920]  What we really have to do is have vaccine mandates in the schools.
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:16.920]  We should have a rule that anyone who walks into a school over the age of 12 has to be vaccinated.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:19.920]  This is the nature of the anti-vaccine movement in this country.
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:26.920]  It's somehow married now to far right wing extremism and white nationalist group.
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:34.920]  Anyone who's unvaccinated and has been lucky enough to escape COVID, your luck is about to run out.
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:36.920]  And I call it anti-science aggression.
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.920]  Coming from Senator Rand Paul, Senator Johnson, members of the House of Representatives,
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:44.920]  in addition to those two senators, are killers.
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:50.920]  Starting to see now those same anti-vaccine messages that's coming out of the U.S.
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:53.920]  And now we're finding it in Africa and Latin America.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:58.920]  And remember what the other reason we're seeing this is the Putin government has,
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:00.920]  this has been reported by U.S. and British intelligence,
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.920]  has been piling on with this whole systematic program of what's been called weaponized health communications
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:11.920]  trying to destabilize democracies with anti-vaccine, anti-science messages.
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:15.920]  The Biden administration has to realize that anti-science is a killer.
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:18.920]  Disinformation, it's not even just disinformation.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:22.920]  This is an anti-science empire right now and we need homeland security.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:23.920]  We need the Justice Department.
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:25.920]  We've really got to figure this out.
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:30.920]  And Health and Human Services will not be able to figure this out on their own.
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:31.920]  This is so criminal.
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:32.920]  This is so un-American.
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:33.920]  This is so evil.
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:36.920]  Plus everything they said the last three and a half years was a lie.
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:38.920]  These are epidemiologists.
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:39.920]  These are scientists.
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:40.920]  These are virologists.
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:42.920]  These are pathologists.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:47.920]  They knew what they were doing, hurting the public and setting the precedent to weaponize Big Pharma
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:51.920]  and the media against the people and get away with murder.
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:55.920]  If you can get away with murder, you can then do whatever you want and you can play God.
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:02.920]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:04.920]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:06.920]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:09.920]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:10.920]  Hey, what's better?
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:11.920]  Knockout.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:12.920]  What's better?
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:13.920]  Down and out.
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:14.920]  What's better?
[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:15.920]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:21.920]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:23.920]  So one person might like this coffee.
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:25.920]  Another person likes that coffee.
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:26.920]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:27.920]  They're all very diverse.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:33.920]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love

[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:17.920]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.920]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:31.920]  Let's play a short clip before we go to our very special guest, Kyle Serafin, a high-level FBI whistleblower
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:38.920]  who's devastated much of the deep state's criminal operations so far and really helped trigger others to go public.
[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:43.920]  The short clip of President Trump saying he will liberate America from these villains once and for all.
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:44.920]  Here it is.
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:45.920]  This is the final battle.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:48.920]  With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state.
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:51.920]  We will expel the warmongers from our government.
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:53.920]  We will drive out the globalists.
[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:57.920]  We will cast out the communists, Marxists and fascists.
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:02.920]  And we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country.
[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:05.920]  We will rout the fake news media.
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:08.920]  And we will defeat crooked Joe Biden.
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:14.920]  We will liberate America from these villains once and for all.
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:22.920]  You know what's amazing about that?
[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:24.920]  That is not rhetoric.
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:26.920]  And that's what I've been saying for years here.
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:30.920]  You have to admit how much trouble we're in if we have any hope of turning this around.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.920]  And God's going to be at the heart of that.
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:33.920]  And the enemy knows that.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:37.920]  That's why they're attacking God and churches and people getting together and saying,
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:41.920]  we're going to send Homeland Security to school board meetings if parents raise their voices.
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:46.920]  And it turned out Homeland Security prompted the teachers' union to do that.
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:48.920]  And this is so dangerous.
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:51.920]  And I've been familiar with his work for a while.
[02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:54.920]  He's one of the most prominent FBI whistleblowers.
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:58.920]  And I'm not going to read Kyle's whole bio, but it's a lot in the Air Force.
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:00.920]  And before that, he didn't enlist until he was 27.
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:03.920]  A lot of private sector success and work.
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:06.920]  He was in the real world first before he got into the crazy world.
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:10.920]  And then he just discovered what was going on, refused the COVID shot.
[02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:14.920]  It's all right here, exposed the illegal activities.
[02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:17.920]  I mean, look, it's too hard to go over it all myself.
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:19.920]  He's the expert. I'll get it wrong.
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:22.920]  But exposing the targeting of Christians and conservatives, particularly Catholics.
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:27.920]  Exposing them branding any political oppositionist terrorist.
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:29.920]  He's at the tip of the spear exposing that.
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:31.920]  Exposing the pipe bomb.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:35.920]  Obviously being part of a drill and being an innate object.
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:37.920]  And them trying to cover that up.
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:39.920]  Just all over the map.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:43.920]  So I think it's best if I just shut up and give him the floor until the bottom of the hour at least.
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:44.920]  And I'll come back with questions.
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:47.920]  To start about himself or wherever he thinks best.
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:50.920]  And then walk through what's happening because he is an insider.
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:52.920]  And he sees the big picture.
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:57.920]  I'm on the outside looking at it and see the system setting up for war of the American people.
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:02.920]  And that national security memorandum put out by Biden in June of 2021.
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:05.920]  Saying white supremacists are the number one terror threat.
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:10.920]  And then defining people that are against open borders, election fraud, forced shots, lockdowns.
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:13.920]  And other things as white supremacists.
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:19.920]  So designating us like we were the Taliban or Al Qaeda as enemy combatants basically.
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:24.920]  And then turning loose all this surveillance and censorship.
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:27.920]  Which they now admit is being run out of the U.N. that sets the policy.
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:33.920]  And then is implemented by the Pentagon, the Justice Department and others.
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:37.920]  To implement the spying and then censorship.
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:39.920]  Because they have to spy on you and then censor.
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:40.920]  You understand that's just as big.
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:46.920]  That's the government then funding the quote fact checkers with what they say are facts to silence the people.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:49.920]  That's the government contracting the Pentagon.
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:51.920]  Contracting to try to force us to make a shot.
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:53.920]  None of the Pentagon's bad.
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:56.920]  Not that even the FBI itself is bad, the average person.
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:58.920]  But the people running it are.
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:09:59.920]  It's been hijacked.
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:03.920]  It's captured agencies that have weaponized the medical system against us.
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:04.920]  So that's my two cents.
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:09.920]  I'd like him to start wherever he'd like because his whistleblowing is so prolific.
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:16.920]  He also hosts his own popular show that we'll tell you about and tell you how you can find that as well.
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:19.920]  And it's very important for you to write.
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:20.920]  Oh, and he's in studio.
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:22.920]  I didn't even know that Shemaine Nugent was there.
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:23.920]  I was supposed to be back last night.
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:24.920]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:25.920]  My wife's dad's in the hospital.
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:26.920]  I'll go see him tomorrow.
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:30.920]  But Kyle Serafin, man, I'm bummed out not being in Austin now.
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:31.920]  Because I love Shemaine.
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:33.920]  But I've got to hang with her a lot.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:34.920]  She's awesome.
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:36.920]  I've never gotten to meet Kyle Serafin, a real hero in person.
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:44.920]  You can find him at thekyleserafinshow.podbean.com, thekyleserafinshow.podbean.com.
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:47.920]  Or just type in listen to Kyle Serafin.
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:50.920]  Okay, I'm ranting here because there's so much information.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:51.920]  Let's put an expert on.
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.920]  Kyle, thank you so much.
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:55.920]  We go to break in about 15 minutes.
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:56.920]  You've got the floor.
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:58.920]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:10:59.920]  I really appreciate it.
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:02.920]  I've been looking forward to this for the last couple weeks since we talked about it.
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:05.920]  And, yeah, so I think you nailed down something really important.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:07.920]  I started in private industry.
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:09.920]  I got out of college like most people.
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:11.920]  And I went to go get a job like a normal person.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:12.920]  I applied for it.
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:13.920]  And I did work.
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:14.920]  I sold furniture.
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:15.920]  I sold computers.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:16.920]  I ran a restaurant.
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:24.920]  And I did some finance for a movie studio, which are all totally incompatible with most people's vision of what FBI agents go and do and how they come out of there.
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:30.920]  And then I enlisted when I was 27, which was probably the first time when I actually got my feet underneath me and started making sense.
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:42.920]  And because I had that background, because I started off knowing what it was to go out and interview for a job, it didn't scare me when the opportunity came up that I was probably going to lose my FBI job.
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:47.920]  It didn't concern me that that was going to be the last time that I was able to go and do these things.
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:49.920]  And so when they came out and said, you're going to get these shots.
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:52.920]  And, by the way, at the same time, we're going to be investigating parents at school board meetings.
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:54.920]  And here's the threat tag we're going to use.
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:56.920]  Both of those things happened almost simultaneously.
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:01.920]  And I've heard you speak about God a lot in the last couple 45 minutes or an hour.
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:02.920]  And it's true.
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:03.920]  This is one of those things.
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:08.920]  You get an opportunity to do something right, especially if you're going to look down the line and see, I've got young kids.
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:16.920]  So am I going to live in a world where I didn't do the right thing, where I didn't set the example that I want them to live by as well?
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:22.920]  And that would be a real difficult thing for me to go and try to tell them to follow on an example that I couldn't follow myself.
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:23.920]  And that was really easy.
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:27.920]  I went to Congress with some information saying that we were going to be investigating parents at school boards.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:31.920]  To be really specific, you mentioned earlier about the possible impeachment of Merrick Garland.
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:34.920]  And that was actually the thing that I brought forward.
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:37.920]  It's bad that the FBI was going to be going after parents at school board meetings.
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:41.920]  But there is at least a federal nexus and a possible crime you could do.
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:42.920]  It would be an interstate threat case.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.920]  And we generally don't do those.
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:45.920]  But we could.
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:49.920]  As FBI agents, we could be doing investigations into that.
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:54.920]  What we can't do is have an attorney general get up in front of Congress and say, I'm not going to do something.
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:59.920]  Specifically, use counterterrorism resources and Patriot Act tools to go after parents.
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:04.920]  And then get an e-mail from the assistant director of counterterrorism at the FBI as an FBI agent.
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:05.920]  I saw that.
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:08.920]  And so it's like, well, you may have perjured yourself.
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:11.920]  And so that was what my credible allegation was to Congress.
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:14.920]  You've got to come forward with a concrete and credible allegation.
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:18.920]  You'll be shocked to learn that the FBI investigated itself and the DOJ investigated themselves.
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:24.920]  And they found that they were not culpable for anything that was malfeasant or wrongdoing in front of anybody.
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:28.920]  So, you know, the government protects itself, it turns out.
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:29.920]  And most whistleblowers have that experience.
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:31.920]  And I said I wasn't going to interrupt you.
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:32.920]  I said I wasn't going to interrupt you.
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:34.920]  And I'm going to shut up.
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:36.920]  You are the consummate whistleblower.
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:38.920]  Because I know that from reading the news, the documents.
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:39.920]  I mean, you are.
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:41.920]  There's a lot of great men and women that have blown the whistle.
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:42.920]  But you've been one of the first.
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:45.920]  And you've had the most credible cases that are cut and dry.
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:49.920]  Like, we wouldn't know they were creeping around spying on parents at school boards without you.
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:58.920]  We wouldn't know that the FBI director was basically illegally using private jets for his own private interest, which is $50,000, $100,000 per trip.
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:13:59.920]  We wouldn't know.
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:01.920]  I mean, just it's a laundry list without you.
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:13.920]  So maybe you should start, now that you've told us about yourself, with the laundry list of things, the torpedoes that you fired into the side of this corrupt, rotting Justice Department.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:19.920]  I don't think to destroy it, but to fix it and somehow have it be reborn, or does it have to be abolished?
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:21.920]  Yeah, it's really straightforward.
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:23.920]  People need to be asking a very specific question.
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:24.920]  And the question is this.
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:27.920]  We spend about $11 billion a year on the FBI.
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:34.920]  And are the American people getting the $11 billion that they expect when they spend that money on the Bureau?
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:38.920]  And if the answer is no, then it needs to either be reimagined or destroyed.
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:40.920]  Both of those things are possibilities.
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:42.920]  We shouldn't have any sacred cows in this country.
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:46.920]  The founding fathers came in and set up a country where we were not going to be relying on government.
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:48.920]  We're supposed to be relying on ourselves.
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:52.920]  So the Bureau answered a basic question in the 1930s.
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:54.920]  It goes back a little bit before that.
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:15:01.920]  But basically what they were trying to do is they were going after interstate crime before the Internet, before phones were prevalent anywhere, before cell phones for sure,
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:05.920]  before competent radio signals going back and forth between different police departments,
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:10.920]  and before interstate communications were as easily available as they are today.
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:18.920]  And so the question that it was answering then was what happens if a gangster robs a bank in Louisiana and then goes and does it in Texas and then goes up and does it in Oklahoma?
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:19.920]  How do you deal with that person?
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:20.920]  Well, you have the FBI.
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:21.920]  That's what they did.
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:24.920]  They went interstate, and they went after people that were doing interstate crimes.
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:26.920]  But today we have a very different world.
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:30.920]  We have a lot of sheriff's departments that can go 50 miles into a state that is beyond their borders.
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:33.920]  We have sheriffs that have intercooperations.
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:34.920]  They've got mutual aid.
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:39.920]  So we shouldn't just assume that there needs to be this federal law enforcement agency the way that we see it.
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:41.920]  And that's the question that I always open, and I'm a skeptic.
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:45.920]  I'm an investigator, and skepticism is sort of the hallmark of that.
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:48.920]  And then, of course, your folks came and printed out all the articles I sent forward.
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:52.920]  It's actually kind of overwhelming to see it in person because I don't actually go and pull these up.
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:54.920]  These are usually just links on a screen to me.
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:55.920]  But what do we start with?
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.920]  We started off talking about the parents at threats that were being threatened.
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:03.920]  We talked about Project Veritas being a member of the media.
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:05.920]  I've spoken publicly about that now.
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:10.920]  We went after a thing called the Militia Violent Extremist Symbols Guide,
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:17.920]  which was something that someone sent me over knowing that the Bureau was going to be investigating basically veterans and cops.
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:18.920]  That's the people who have these.
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:28.920]  I mean, all my friends have either one of these symbols from this symbols guide, the Betsy Ross flag, the Punisher skull, the Second Amendment 2A, something like that.
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:31.920]  They all have this either on their T-shirts.
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:34.920]  They've got it hanging in their gyms, or it's tattooed upon their bodies.
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.920]  These are people that put everything on the line for this country.
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:40.920]  So you're going to tell me those people are potential extremists?
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:42.920]  They're going to go underneath the domestic terrorism symbols?
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:44.920]  That's a big problem.
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:46.920]  We've got a whole bunch of other things out there.
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:51.920]  We talked about how they were putting forward that misinformation and disinformation are potential federal crimes.
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:54.920]  There's a very, very narrow window where that's a possibility.
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:55.920]  So that's kind of scary.
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:01.920]  We found out that there was an LGBTQ gender ideology thing that they were pushing down on a bunch of Bureau employees.
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:04.920]  I actually remember it because they said that everyone had to take it.
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:07.920]  I was in the middle of having my third child.
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:09.920]  My wife was having our third child.
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:12.920]  We were bringing him home, and I thought, man, I'm not going to go do that thing.
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:13.920]  It's stupid.
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:16.920]  It's a bad PowerPoint that's going to be pushing something that is antithetical to my religion.
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:18.920]  So no thanks to that.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:21.920]  And the Bureau had such a negative reaction internally that they actually scrubbed it.
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:29.920]  But one of the brave whistleblowers that I work with, and there's a number of sources that I have within the Bureau that have been coming forward, all unclassified, all appropriate channels.
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:34.920]  We bring these things to Congress, and then a number of them make it to the light through different media outlets.
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:36.920]  And I'm glad they do, because this is America's information.
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:38.920]  It doesn't belong to the FBI.
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:39.920]  It doesn't belong to me.
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:42.920]  It belongs to the people that pay for it, which is the American taxpayers.
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:44.920]  And then we put out some other stuff here.
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:45.920]  I'm just going around the horn here.
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:52.920]  But we've got this piece that Tracy Beans did at Uncover DC called Terminating Dissent, where they merged – and this is very threatening –
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:56.920]  they merged the whistleblower protection training, which we get annually as federal employees,
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:00.920]  and the insider threat training, which people can imagine are kind of like spies and traitors.
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.920]  So that's like a Robert Hansen type or an Alter James.
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:08.920]  And they merged those together, and they kind of showed how if you're one, you might be the other as well.
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:10.920]  And so be cautious.
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:13.920]  And this was also coinciding with the Attorney General sending out a letter saying don't go to Congress.
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:15.920]  Jim Jordan's office came forward.
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:20.920]  The Republican from Ohio was very clear about saying you do have a right to go to Congress if you're a whistleblower.
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:22.920]  There's federal law that says you can.
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:24.920]  And then it just continues down.
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:28.920]  We found out that they were investigating Catholics in the Richmond field office,
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:36.920]  and that some intelligence analysts put out an intel product essentially saying that if you are a traditional Latin mass Catholic,
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:40.920]  if you like to go to a pre-Vatican II style Catholic church,
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:46.920]  then you are potentially fertile grounds for white supremacy for exactly the reasons you mentioned,
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:52.920]  border policy, LGBTQ plus stuff, your abortion stances, which are really not Catholic positions.
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:54.920]  They're certainly not radical Catholic positions.
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:57.920]  They're kind of like generally Christian positions in this country.
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:00.920]  So I would imagine that's actually a majority of people in a lot of ways.
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:03.920]  I spoke about the pipe bomber early on, the fact that it was very clear to us.
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:05.920]  We had some leads.
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:09.920]  We were pulled off those leads to go after some nonsense about January 6th investigations
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:13.920]  where people were calling into the 800 number in West Virginia,
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:15.920]  and they were basically just complaining about their neighbors and saying they didn't like them,
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:18.920]  they didn't like their politics, and that the FBI should investigate them.
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:20.920]  And unfortunately, the FBI actually obliged.
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:22.920]  There was something like 500,000 tips.
[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:25.920]  I talked to Matt Taibbi, who's an independent journalist, and that was what he found out.
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:29.920]  There was about 500,000 or more tips in just a couple of weeks, which is insane.
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:33.920]  I think they said it was a 750% increase in tips coming in.
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:35.920]  And they were just mean-spirited.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:38.920]  A lot of them had nothing to do with real allegations of federal crime.
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:40.920]  They were just saying, I don't like this person.
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:42.920]  I don't like their takes.
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:45.920]  They're just kind of a MAGA type or maybe a MAGA type,
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:47.920]  or maybe they liked Reagan, and they probably liked Trump.
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:49.920]  So that's pretty gross.
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:51.920]  Some of our actions have actually borne some fruit.
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:53.920]  We've got some people looking into, members of Congress are looking into
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:55.920]  the piece about Chris Wray using the jet the way he does,
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:59.920]  which has probably been wasting maybe upwards of $2 million of taxpayer money
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:01.920]  for his personal travel and for his personal preferences.
[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:03.920]  And just so people understand what he did,
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:08.920]  he took an FBI jet, which is a $60 million aircraft funded by counterterrorism resources,
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:11.920]  and had it fly to Reagan National from Manassas.
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:14.920]  It's about a 15-minute trip, tops.
[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:17.920]  And he had it pick up and fly from the hangar where it lives
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:20.920]  to the federal airport that is closer to D.C.
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:24.920]  simply so he could avoid 45 minutes to an hour in traffic going out on I-66.
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:26.920]  And it's not like the man is driving.
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:30.920]  If anybody has any illusions about the fact that Chris Wray is not driving anywhere,
[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:33.920]  he's got a three-vehicle motorcade full of FBI agents that are armed,
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:35.920]  and they drive him, and he's got Wi-Fi and all the other capabilities,
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:37.920]  so he's always in touch.
[02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:39.920]  But he just didn't want to do that inconvenient trip,
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:41.920]  so they fly the jet to him, they pick him up,
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:45.920]  and that costs us a minimum of $2,500 when it touches down on the runway.
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:48.920]  And then whatever the wear and tear on the jet is, and it's not a cheap aircraft.
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:50.920]  It's a Gulfstream 550.
[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:53.920]  Well, the point is he's not supposed to do that legally.
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:58.920]  And I said I would interrupt, but don't you notice how that's why I print all the articles
[02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:02.920]  is because when you're clicking online, you don't realize how much it is
[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:05.920]  until you print them and then you look at it all,
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:07.920]  and then it reminds you to actually cover all of them.
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:10.920]  And I'm sorry to interrupt, but what you're painting here is a picture of corruption,
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:16.920]  a picture of arrogance, an image of a system trying to criminalize dissent
[02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:21.920]  and demonize the most patriotic Americans and make us a political enemy.
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:25.920]  I mean, this is classic authoritarian totalitarianism. Please continue.
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:28.920]  Yeah, no, you're right. It's a police state. That's exactly what we're looking like.
[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:32.920]  And the other thing is that we just found out, and people come to me and share information.
[02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:36.920]  I found out from two independent sources, which is kind of the minimum number of people you want to hear,
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:41.920]  that the FBI is currently investigating internally 700 plus FBI agents.
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:44.920]  There's about 14,000, a little bit less than 14,000 agents total.
[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:50.920]  So about 5% of the workforce is being investigated now as possible extremists and threats to the FBI.
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:52.920]  And that's pretty disturbing.
[02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:56.920]  And what I also found out is that internally they are recruiting from the headquarters building.
[02:21:56.920 --> 02:22:00.920]  These are going to be the people that actually are kind of good acolytes,
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:05.920]  and they believe that their loyalty to the Bureau is much higher than maybe their loyalty to the Constitution.
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:10.920]  But they're recruiting internally to the Hoover building, getting more agents to go be part of this internal affairs unit,
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:14.920]  which is known as the Office of Professional Responsibility and the Insider Threat Units.
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:18.920]  So they are investigating their own at a rate that obviously there's an opportunity cost.
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:21.920]  They're not going after terrorists that are legitimately in other countries,
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:25.920]  and they're not going after federal crimes like people stealing Americans' money.
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:28.920]  There's just a whole host of these things where when you weaponize the government,
[02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:32.920]  you turn it against the people, and then you turn it against the people that are trying to keep it straight,
[02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:34.920]  which there are some good people in the FBI. There's no doubt about it.
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:36.920]  And they're now targeted, too.
[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:41.920]  Well, I noticed in your stack, you know, they're continuing to double down with a white supremacist,
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:43.920]  and then they list all these things that make you a white supremacist.
[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:44.920]  Right.
[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:47.920]  Being a Trump supporter, you're a white supremacist, so it's a way to demonize.
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:53.920]  And really the classic sign of a totalitarian state is spying on your own people internally.
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:55.920]  I mean, this just sounds like a nightmare for everybody.
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:01.920]  I think it shows real weakness in the so-called corrupt ruling class like the Bidens.
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:06.920]  Did you see Biden yesterday come out and say, or a couple days ago, but it went viral yesterday,
[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:09.920]  he said, yeah, I sell state secrets to other governments. Big deal.
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:12.920]  He's so out of his mind, it's bizarre.
[02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:16.920]  And even though he's joking, which we know he's not, this is insanity.
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:18.920]  This is like Caligula.
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:24.920]  Later stage, final stage tyranny is when they start, lack of a better term, pissing on our faces, sir.
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:26.920]  Yeah, and they're doing that.
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:28.920]  So the thing is, is they've got to balkanize us, right?
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:30.920]  They've got to divide and conquer.
[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:32.920]  They've got to make sure they other you.
[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:33.920]  And I've been making some parallels.
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:37.920]  I was told I wasn't allowed to quote Adolf Hitler the other day, which made me want to quote Adolf Hitler,
[02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:42.920]  because he's a great cautionary tale of some of the things that he said and some of the playbook that is being laid out.
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:44.920]  You can see what totalitarian regimes do.
[02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:45.920]  They all do the same thing.
[02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:47.920]  It's not like it's specific to Hitler.
[02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:52.920]  So I did a whole podcast just quoting things from Hitler and showing how they are in real time.
[02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:53.920]  They didn't start with death camps.
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:55.920]  They started off by creating a quote unquote other.
[02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:57.920]  And so that other is a Trump supporter.
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:23:58.920]  It's a MAGA.
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:01.920]  I'm using the term MAGA to talk about people that support President Trump.
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:04.920]  And, you know, I'm neither here nor there when it comes to President Trump.
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:06.920]  But I'm a guy that's very big on fundamental fairness.
[02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:09.920]  And what I saw that happened at Mar-a-Lago was not fair.
[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:10.920]  It is not normal.
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:12.920]  And it was outside the range of what normally happens.
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:18.920]  And you're slowly seeing guys like Steve DeAntonio, who was the assistant director of the Washington field office,
[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:22.920]  and in charge of the squad that went down and did the Mar-a-Lago raid.
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:27.920]  What we saw was he's starting to come out and say some things were abnormal, because here's the thing you've got to imagine.
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:32.920]  If you're an FBI agent and you get flown down to Miami, where, by the way, they've got plenty of FBI agents, it turns out,
[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:35.920]  and you're going to go do this raid at the former president's house,
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:38.920]  which is beyond everything you can imagine ever doing.
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:39.920]  It's never been done before.
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:40.920]  So that's a big deal.
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:43.920]  And then you're going to have to sit in front of, you know, a jury.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:44.920]  You're going to have to have a defense attorney.
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:46.920]  And I'm sure Trump's got good ones.
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:51.920]  They're going to ask you, have you ever flown to another area of responsibility, another field office's jurisdiction,
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:53.920]  and conducted a search warrant?
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:54.920]  Is that normal for you?
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:56.920]  And they're going to have to say no, it's not.
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:24:58.920]  So why do you think you did it?
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:01.920]  And they're going to have to come up with some reason, or they're going to have to say they don't know,
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:04.920]  why they actually flew out there and conducted a raid.
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:09.920]  Well, wasn't it the same unit that ran the whole Russia hoax thing?
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:11.920]  It's CI-14.
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:13.920]  It's Counterintelligence 14, which was the sixth floor.
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:15.920]  It was right next to where I used to sit.
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:17.920]  I spent two years working counterintelligence.
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:19.920]  I was on the Chinese side of the house.
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:21.920]  The Russian squad, they did Russian espionage.
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:24.920]  So, yeah, it's the same group, although a lot of that, I think, was run out of headquarters.
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:29.920]  Kind of interestingly and sort of parallel to what we're seeing on this desk in front of me,
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:31.920]  they also were the first ones that got the pipe bomber case.
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:32.920]  I don't have no idea why.
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:34.920]  I think it was just a bandwidth issue.
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:42.920]  But for some reason, they actually assigned a bunch of counterintelligence agents to the pipe bomb case right off the jump.
[02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:45.920]  And I don't need anyone to get it out like, you know, oh, that means something.
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:46.920]  It may mean nothing.
[02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:48.920]  Oftentimes, it just means that they just didn't know what to do.
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:50.920]  They were overwhelmed by January 6th.
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:55.920]  And for me, it's actually kind of indicated that the bureau was caught flat-footed by what happened on J6.
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:57.920]  I don't think the bureau actually planned it.
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:25:59.920]  I'll go out there and say that very clearly.
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:03.920]  But that doesn't mean the government wasn't deeply involved, that they didn't have significant sources.
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:06.920]  And my instinct has always been that it was somewhere in Department of Homeland Security,
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:09.920]  which doesn't have any of the shackles that the FBI has.
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:11.920]  They don't have the attorney general guidelines governing their—
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:12.920]  Incredible.
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:14.920]  Stop right there because you've got military background.
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:16.920]  You've got FBI intelligence background.
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:17.920]  I'm not just regular FBI.
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:19.920]  That's exactly what I believe.
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:24.920]  They're not going to use the Justice Department because that's got too much oversight in it.
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:25.920]  Yep.
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:31.920]  But when you look at all these—it's just like they use a regular Navy deepwater team to blow up the pipeline,
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.920]  not the Navy SEALs and SEAL Team 10 because that's under congressional oversight.
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:37.920]  We now know Cy Hirsch has all the whistleblowers.
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:38.920]  So it's the same thing.
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:41.920]  And I don't think they—even that group didn't purely run it.
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:47.920]  They had D.C. police who were on board, who came in and helped break in.
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:52.920]  They had auxiliary re-eps types who were there saying go into the Capitol and helping ram signs in.
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:56.920]  Then they had provocateurs within the other groups, and they had Q groups saying,
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:26:58.920]  oh, yes, Trump's about to storm it.
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:26:59.920]  Go in.
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:00.920]  And so there was enough hysteria.
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:04.920]  And because they sent half of the Capitol police who were set up to crowd control
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:07.920]  and to traffic control at the ellipse, they were able to break through.
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:08.920]  And I saw the whole thing.
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:15.920]  I'm not an FBI agent, but I've sure learned a lot since then how they started attacking right when Trump started speaking.
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:19.920]  The minute they broke in, I was then told by people obviously compartmentalized,
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:21.920]  OK, Jones, now you go lead the march.
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:22.920]  And I felt the setup.
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:25.920]  I was like, well, how am I supposed to lead when 200,000 have already gone down the road?
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:28.920]  And then I get there, and I'm like, oh, my God, we've been set up.
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:32.920]  And now I've learned the 20-page article in The Washington Post—I'm ranting now—
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:36.920]  about how they've been trying to have, you know, Jack Smith and all of them indict me and Trump.
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:40.920]  It is just insane to know how innocent I am and to know the FBI knows that.
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:43.920]  They've got all our phones, everything, and they know we try to stop it.
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:48.920]  And they are probably going to indict Trump and other people who are completely innocent.
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:50.920]  It makes me—it's not even a feeling of being angry.
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:52.920]  It's a feeling of just being blown away.
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:53.920]  It's betrayal.
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:54.920]  I mean, that's what that feels like.
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:58.920]  And I know that feeling because that's what happened when I, you know, got walked out the door.
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:00.920]  It's like, OK, that's what happens when you've been betrayed.
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:03.920]  You feel—it hurts more because you had a sense of initial trust.
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:07.920]  You know, if it's somebody that you couldn't trust, if some random person comes up,
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:09.920]  puts a gun in your face and takes your wallet, you don't like it.
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:11.920]  It makes you, you know, cautious.
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:13.920]  But it's not the same as if somebody in your family had done it.
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:15.920]  And when your country does it to you, it's definitely bad.
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:18.920]  It reminded me what you just said.
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:21.920]  Like, January 6th always seemed like it was going to be a trap, even before that.
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.920]  And I talked, you know, members of the FBI, friends of mine who are either, you know,
[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:28.920]  former agents or that were agents at the time and have retired since,
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:33.920]  not to go down to that speech, even though it's a First Amendment-protected activity.
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:34.920]  Sir, this is incredible.
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:35.920]  This is incredible.
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:37.920]  This is one of the most amazing interviews ever.

[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:46.920]  Yes, it is.
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:47.920]  Wow.
[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:48.920]  All right.
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:50.920]  Well, let's—man, I could interview this guy for 10 hours.
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:54.920]  And we've got a former NSA guy and others coming in next hour.
[02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:56.920]  Maybe he'll be able to ride shotgun with us some.

[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:01.920]  A lot of people have asked me, why is MFulware's store and MFulware's life

[02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:28.920]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:29.920]  Ours don't.
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:31.920]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:37.920]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.

[02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:40.920]  It became a bestseller.
[02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:43.920]  The turmeric toothpaste is available again at MFulwarestore.com.
[02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:45.920]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[02:31:45.920 --> 02:31:46.920]  We've got some of that left.
[02:31:46.920 --> 02:31:50.920]  And we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running out as well.
[02:31:50.920 --> 02:31:54.920]  So all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time at MFulwarestore.com.
[02:31:57.920 --> 02:32:02.920]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:05.920]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:07.920]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:08.920]  Period.
[02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:09.920]  Case closed.
[02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:11.920]  Out to get you and your family.
[02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:16.920]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:17.920]  It's been around about 15 years.
[02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:19.920]  It became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:25.920]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:28.920]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:30.920]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels.
[02:32:30.920 --> 02:32:31.920]  Thousands of chemicals.
[02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:33.920]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:36.920]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:41.920]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:47.920]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:48.920]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:50.920]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:51.920]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:54.920]  The point is you get the filters at MFulwarestore.com.
[02:32:54.920 --> 02:32:55.920]  They're discounted right now.

[02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:04.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:26.230]  Well, we've got Kyle Serafin, the FBI whistleblower, so many other great whistleblowers as well.
[02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:30.950]  That's why I've said on air, the federal government's not our enemy, but it's the hijackers at the
[02:33:30.950 --> 02:33:34.790]  top of it that have made us the enemy, because they know we're going to legitimately take
[02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:35.790]  this country back.
[02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:38.950]  I said I'd give him the floor, and I shut up most of the time, but wow, I mean, I'm
[02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:43.590]  so intimately involved in all this, I've been in the crosshairs, that I have a lot of selfish
[02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:48.470]  things I want to know his view on, but Kyle Serafin, KyleSerafin.com does his own show
[02:33:48.470 --> 02:33:49.470]  as well.
[02:33:49.470 --> 02:33:53.790]  Finish up with J6, the branding of Americans as terrorists, where do you think the deep
[02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:55.590]  state's going with this?
[02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:57.410]  What do you think's going to happen to Trump?
[02:33:57.410 --> 02:34:00.070]  How do we peacefully fix this?
[02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:03.430]  They kept saying, oh, when we indict Trump, his approval rating will go down.
[02:34:03.430 --> 02:34:05.190]  It's backfired.
[02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:06.950]  I can tell them that's going to backfire.
[02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:08.310]  They seem to be in their own bubble.
[02:34:08.310 --> 02:34:09.550]  I don't want a civil war.
[02:34:09.550 --> 02:34:13.510]  I don't want a confrontation, but when your government's hijacked by criminals that are
[02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:18.590]  trying to put you in jail when they know you're innocent, and they know the president's innocent,
[02:34:18.590 --> 02:34:19.750]  it's beyond being angry.
[02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:22.750]  Like you said, you really are, I'm impressed, because I couldn't think of the word.
[02:34:22.750 --> 02:34:30.990]  It's betrayal, and it's a feeling of just amazement, and also resolve to do something,
[02:34:30.990 --> 02:34:32.030]  and I appreciate your resolve.
[02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:33.870]  So I will shut up now.
[02:34:33.870 --> 02:34:34.870]  Just cover the waterfront.
[02:34:35.550 --> 02:34:36.550]  You're a classic FBI agent.
[02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:39.390]  You come in with all these points and tell us what you know about each thing that happened,
[02:34:39.390 --> 02:34:44.430]  but as a citizen, as a father, as a veteran, we want, as a Christian, your 35,000-foot
[02:34:44.430 --> 02:34:46.750]  view on what you think we should do.
[02:34:46.750 --> 02:34:48.550]  So I'm always really specific.
[02:34:48.550 --> 02:34:50.670]  I know the term deep state has a lot of following.
[02:34:50.670 --> 02:34:53.770]  Unfortunately, it's kind of what I would call an emotional word, so I tend to stay away
[02:34:53.770 --> 02:34:57.950]  from it, and I use the word administrative state, and I actually met with Vivek Ramaswamy
[02:34:57.950 --> 02:35:00.790]  the other day and talked to him about it, and he immediately was on board with using
[02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:04.590]  that terminology, and I think it's more accurate, because the deep state kind of conjures up
[02:35:05.310 --> 02:35:09.670]  this sexy kind of spy world, people handing off dossiers in a dark alleyway, or they're
[02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:14.070]  doing it in a parking garage, or the 90s X-Files with the Cancer Man and all this stuff, and
[02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:15.550]  people making decisions.
[02:35:15.550 --> 02:35:18.710]  The administrative state is actually much more nefarious, and it's far more insidious
[02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:19.710]  and more dangerous.
[02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:23.590]  It's a lot of people that don't know each other that have independently aligned goals,
[02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:24.670]  and those goals are really simple.
[02:35:24.670 --> 02:35:27.090]  It's really the oldest thing of corruption that's ever been.
[02:35:27.090 --> 02:35:30.110]  It's to get a little bit more money on their pension, and to be able to find themself in
[02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:34.430]  a place where they are going to make a little bit more money, or they're going to have
[02:35:34.430 --> 02:35:38.790]  a better shot at a retirement gig, so government employees doing that are clearly the enemy,
[02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:43.310]  but we cannot rule out the fact that it takes every level, and I've been spending a bunch
[02:35:43.310 --> 02:35:46.670]  of time looking into the Holocaust, because I just think it's so important that we understand
[02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:51.870]  what has happened, the way things go, and basically it looks like this.
[02:35:51.870 --> 02:35:56.030]  You don't get the FBI knocking down the door of a pro-life activist, or coming in and raiding
[02:35:56.030 --> 02:35:59.830]  a Mira Lago without people saying yes, all the way down the line, to the frontline agents,
[02:35:59.830 --> 02:36:04.790]  to the GS-13 guys, like I was, who were knocking on the door and serving that warrant.
[02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:09.230]  Somebody has to come up with the idea, somebody has to get it approved, then it's got to go
[02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:13.430]  down to supervisors who are going to tell their people to go do it, drop an ops plan, file
[02:36:13.430 --> 02:36:17.630]  the FD-888, which is the operations arrest warrant plan, and then they got to go do that
[02:36:17.630 --> 02:36:19.030]  thing, right?
[02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:22.270]  Everybody's got to be on board all the way down the line, and I had a really front row
[02:36:22.270 --> 02:36:25.990]  seat to this with a supervisor who I thought was a great guy, and I have no personal qualms
[02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:27.390]  with the man at all.
[02:36:27.390 --> 02:36:31.510]  He was my boss, and what he said was, I basically agree with you and your stance on the vaccine
[02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:36.950]  mandates, but I've got alimony, and I've got a mortgage, and I've got a new wife, and
[02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:42.070]  I've got to be able to pay my bills, and so I can't do this, and you're out the door, that's
[02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:45.610]  what's going to happen to you, and when that is the case, and then they wrote some things
[02:36:45.610 --> 02:36:47.310]  about me that were pretty amazing.
[02:36:47.310 --> 02:36:50.470]  They said that I was an insider threat, that I was dangerous, that I was volatile, that
[02:36:50.470 --> 02:36:55.270]  I was unhinged, and I was scaring my coworkers, so they did the natural thing that you would
[02:36:55.270 --> 02:36:58.870]  do when you find someone who's dangerous working for the FBI, you take them from something
[02:36:58.870 --> 02:37:02.790]  criminal matters, I used to work Indian crimes for my last gig, so I'm literally driving
[02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:07.550]  out to an Indian reservation and investigating murders, or suicides, or domestic violence,
[02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:09.750]  and then they put me on a national security squad, because that's where you want your
[02:37:09.750 --> 02:37:10.750]  potential traitors.
[02:37:10.750 --> 02:37:16.910]  They put me on this thing, it's totally illogical, and it's absurd on its face, and so when they
[02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:20.190]  start doing things like that, they're tipping the hand that, look, everybody's on board,
[02:37:20.190 --> 02:37:24.690]  they all agree to it, and it doesn't mean that they're bad people, it means that their interests
[02:37:24.690 --> 02:37:28.250]  are aligned with just basically saving their skin, keeping their paychecks, moving towards
[02:37:28.250 --> 02:37:31.850]  that pension, we call it the golden handcuffs in the federal service.
[02:37:31.850 --> 02:37:35.570]  It's once you get to 10 years, you got another 10 years before you can retire, you're kind
[02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:39.050]  of going to do everything, and so a lot of people are sticking around knowing that they're
[02:37:39.050 --> 02:37:43.170]  18 months out from retirement, that they're 24 months away from getting a pension for
[02:37:43.170 --> 02:37:46.850]  the rest of their life, and it's a good pension, by the way, it's 50, 60 grand, plus you get
[02:37:46.850 --> 02:37:52.370]  a true up from the social security piece of it, so they're making maybe 75 to $85,000 a
[02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:56.530]  year for life, and that's a hard thing to walk away from, knowing that you put in a
[02:37:56.530 --> 02:38:00.170]  decade or a decade and a half worth of service, and many of them started off in the right
[02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:04.130]  heart, but they end up just serving the agency, and that's what's really dangerous, I would
[02:38:04.130 --> 02:38:05.130]  say.
[02:38:05.130 --> 02:38:07.810]  The other thing I'll say, and this is January 6th specific, and I think you're going to
[02:38:07.810 --> 02:38:13.750]  appreciate this, the FBI has a lot of sources, there's a piece in front of me that your folks
[02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:19.450]  printed out, Julie Kelly wrote it in American Greatness, and she talked about the FBI spends
[02:38:19.450 --> 02:38:27.450]  on average $40 million U.S. currency, and they pay it in cash to their sources, okay?
[02:38:27.450 --> 02:38:30.610]  So when you pay out your sources, and you pay them out in cash, there are people that
[02:38:30.610 --> 02:38:32.610]  get paid more than people that get paid less.
[02:38:32.610 --> 02:38:38.690]  If you're reporting on the Hells Angels, you might get $1,000, you might get $5,000, which
[02:38:38.690 --> 02:38:42.410]  includes some operational expenses, they'll pay for you to go to a trip, you can go to
[02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:46.370]  Sturgis or something, they'll buy you a motorcycle that's cheap and crappy or whatever that is,
[02:38:46.370 --> 02:38:51.130]  but if you're working the big deal cases, where the big money is, you can get big time
[02:38:51.130 --> 02:38:56.030]  payouts, and we're talking six figures in cash, some people getting paid out annually.
[02:38:56.030 --> 02:39:00.170]  The American people got a little taste of that hearing about the Biden FD 1023, talking
[02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:03.550]  about the corruption scandal, and they said that this whistleblower has been paid upwards
[02:39:03.550 --> 02:39:10.130]  of $200,000 over the last 10 years, so that's $20,000 on average per year, and that's a
[02:39:10.130 --> 02:39:14.870]  very mid-level, solid source, no question about it, somebody that's reliable and you want
[02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:18.710]  to pay them that kind of cash, but that is not professional source material.
[02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:22.830]  There are people that work in the domestic terrorism space that do this for a living,
[02:39:22.830 --> 02:39:25.310]  and they probably don't file it with the IRS, we can imagine.
[02:39:25.310 --> 02:39:28.830]  There's always this wink and a nod moment when you pay somebody cash, and you go, make
[02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:32.470]  sure you report it on your taxes, because that's how, we're not responsible for that,
[02:39:32.470 --> 02:39:33.470]  that's the IRS's problem.
[02:39:33.470 --> 02:39:37.270]  The FBI pays in cash, and the reason why is because if we wrote a check, it would tie
[02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:40.950]  them back to us, so we're doing it for their safety and for their protection, but it's
[02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:45.470]  become the same thing where classification is now defending documents away from the American
[02:39:45.470 --> 02:39:50.150]  taxpayer's eyes, by keeping people on a cash payroll, you are keeping them away from the
[02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:51.310]  American people as well.
[02:39:51.310 --> 02:39:55.310]  They're not easily investigated or exposed, and the FBI fights tooth and nail for what
[02:39:55.310 --> 02:39:58.470]  they call sources and methods, keeping that away from people.
[02:39:58.470 --> 02:40:02.070]  So this is, a lot of this stuff needs to be reimagined, it's really dangerous, and they're
[02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:03.470]  incentivized to make cases.
[02:40:03.470 --> 02:40:08.070]  So this was my instinct about January 6th, you didn't need a big plan.
[02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:12.230]  What you needed was independent operators who are working on behalf of the Bureau in
[02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:16.790]  the domestic terrorism space, and they need to show up, and they need a case, because
[02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:20.790]  if there's a domestic terrorism case and a prosecution, that means that it justifies
[02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:22.270]  a big budget.
[02:40:22.270 --> 02:40:27.790]  Last year, it was something like $300 or $400 million for just international terrorism that
[02:40:27.790 --> 02:40:28.790]  was being funded.
[02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:31.910]  That's just for operations alone, that's for the investigations, that's not for salaries
[02:40:31.910 --> 02:40:34.430]  and everything else, that's for running these cases.
[02:40:34.430 --> 02:40:38.270]  And so that was for international terrorism, similar budgets for domestic terrorism.
[02:40:38.270 --> 02:40:42.430]  If you don't meet the numbers, if you don't have that much casework, you don't get that
[02:40:42.430 --> 02:40:44.950]  money renewed the next time when Congress goes for it.
[02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:46.250]  You have to justify.
[02:40:46.250 --> 02:40:48.190]  And so here's something that'll blow your mind a little bit.
[02:40:48.190 --> 02:40:53.710]  The FBI projected that in 2022, they were going to disrupt, that's the word, it's a
[02:40:53.710 --> 02:41:01.230]  statistical accomplishment or a stat, they need to disrupt 600 domestic terrorist organizations,
[02:41:01.230 --> 02:41:06.190]  600 counterterrorism investigations need to result in disruption, and they fell short.
[02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:08.790]  They fell short, and they only had 397.
[02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:10.510]  That was the claim that came back to Congress.
[02:41:10.510 --> 02:41:15.710]  So you have to believe, as the American taxpayer, that the FBI interrupted a terrorist operation
[02:41:15.710 --> 02:41:19.870]  every single day of the year and twice on every Sunday.
[02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:22.070]  That's the actual numbers.
[02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:23.430]  I mean...
[02:41:23.430 --> 02:41:28.070]  And that's why we have the classic cases of agents going in and provocateuring stuff in
[02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:32.630]  like Michigan and trying to get idiots to go kidnap the governor, because if you get
[02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:35.070]  them to just talk about it, now you've got that threat.
[02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:38.630]  Well, what about the statement that domestic terrorism is the number one threat?
[02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:42.550]  I mean, I look around and we do see some real domestic terrorism, like the black shopping
[02:41:42.550 --> 02:41:47.270]  center with the guys shooting people and whatever, and it's terrible, but it's still pretty rare
[02:41:47.270 --> 02:41:48.590]  compared to everything else.
[02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:52.430]  And then I hear that there's just white supremacists running around murdering people everywhere.
[02:41:52.430 --> 02:41:54.310]  There's like a few examples I can find.
[02:41:54.310 --> 02:41:58.950]  And then I saw manipulation of crime statistics, where if just a white person commits a crime,
[02:41:58.950 --> 02:42:02.790]  then they just call it terrorism or how does that work?
[02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:03.790]  They're cherry picking data.
[02:42:03.790 --> 02:42:04.790]  So you're correct.
[02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:07.630]  It is a way of moving the stats around.
[02:42:07.630 --> 02:42:11.230]  It's a way of moving the numbers to facilitate a narrative.
[02:42:11.230 --> 02:42:13.910]  So you can have two things be true at once.
[02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:18.310]  You can have white supremacy based terrorism, domestic terrorism, be incredibly rare, like
[02:42:18.310 --> 02:42:20.310]  lightning strike rare.
[02:42:20.310 --> 02:42:25.110]  And at the same time, it can also be the most dangerous and most prevalent version
[02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:26.430]  of domestic terrorism.
[02:42:26.430 --> 02:42:30.270]  But what we have to say is, is how big is that threat and how realistic is it that normal
[02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:31.670]  people are going to experience it?
[02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:32.830]  So here's the numbers.
[02:42:32.830 --> 02:42:38.190]  The FBI's own numbers said that for the last decade or so, there were 77 homicides that
[02:42:38.190 --> 02:42:41.150]  were specifically tied to white supremacist ideology.
[02:42:41.150 --> 02:42:42.150]  Okay.
[02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:44.090]  77 homicides over about a decade.
[02:42:44.090 --> 02:42:47.230]  And then somebody else shared with me context, and that's the thing that's always missing
[02:42:47.230 --> 02:42:48.230]  in these reports.
[02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:51.590]  And the context is about 90 people a year die because they've messed around with their
[02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:54.710]  lawnmower and they decided to participate in the Darwin Awards.
[02:42:54.710 --> 02:43:01.230]  So that's a really specific small number when you think about 77 over a period of a decade.
[02:43:01.230 --> 02:43:04.430]  But it is the highest piece of the biggest piece of that pie.
[02:43:04.430 --> 02:43:06.670]  That pie is just really, really small, right?
[02:43:06.670 --> 02:43:09.390]  So they're playing with the numbers and they're playing on the emotional.
[02:43:09.390 --> 02:43:12.830]  So they create a special little pie with special definitions.
[02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:15.910]  And then of course, it's this rare thing in a rare pie.
[02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:16.910]  So what about this?
[02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:17.910]  You're a Christian.
[02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:18.910]  You're Catholic.
[02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:19.910]  I'm familiar with your work.
[02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:24.070]  Why would you, like, Catholics are like some of the nicest people I've ever known.
[02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:27.030]  Just they're always, I mean, I'm going to stereotype, but Catholics are really nice
[02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:28.030]  family people.
[02:43:28.030 --> 02:43:33.390]  And to just say, I mean, every time I go volunteer for something, it's like half Catholics there.
[02:43:33.390 --> 02:43:39.110]  To say that Catholics are this big terror threat with zero, like zero, while Catholic
[02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:43.590]  churches and pro-life centers are being attacked just everywhere.
[02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:47.230]  The left's running around burning billions down, shooting people.
[02:43:47.230 --> 02:43:49.390]  Democrats are saying mostly peaceful.
[02:43:49.390 --> 02:43:51.030]  They're doing plays about killing Trump.
[02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:52.990]  They're running around foaming at the mouth.
[02:43:52.990 --> 02:43:55.030]  Antifa's pointing guns at people, shooting people.
[02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:57.630]  I've driven through it in Austin where they're waving guns around.
[02:43:57.630 --> 02:44:00.750]  I mean, I had no idea I was driving down a road with people with guns waving around.
[02:44:00.750 --> 02:44:04.530]  I mean, if I saw conservatives doing that one place, I'd say don't act like this is terrible.
[02:44:04.530 --> 02:44:09.670]  But I'm sitting here as a Christian conservative, knowing statistically we are like, you know,
[02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:12.230]  like conciliatory owners, like the best people there are.
[02:44:12.270 --> 02:44:13.590]  I'm not saying I'm a great person or perfect.
[02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:17.830]  I don't mean I don't look at a girl in a short skirt, but at the end of the day, to say that
[02:44:17.830 --> 02:44:23.110]  Catholics and Christians are running around like demons, but MS-13 are all God's children.
[02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:24.230]  It's just preposterous.
[02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:27.910]  Why would the Justice Department jump the shark and wake up people?
[02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:28.910]  Because here's the deal.
[02:44:28.910 --> 02:44:31.350]  I don't know if the FBI knows how hated they are now.
[02:44:31.350 --> 02:44:35.250]  I don't know if the Justice Department knows they're doing all this dirty work for crazy
[02:44:35.250 --> 02:44:39.110]  people that march kids around at naked pedophile parades.
[02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:41.670]  I mean, it's like the government's committing suicide.
[02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:42.670]  Why is it doing it?
[02:44:42.670 --> 02:44:43.910]  Sorry, I'm ranting here.
[02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:44.910]  Yeah.
[02:44:44.910 --> 02:44:45.910]  Part of it is I don't think they are aware.
[02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:46.910]  I think you're correct.
[02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:48.790]  And I just was talking to one of the gentlemen in the studio here.
[02:44:48.790 --> 02:44:50.910]  It's like they don't actually know.
[02:44:50.910 --> 02:44:52.910]  My buddies and I that are that are whistleblowers.
[02:44:52.910 --> 02:44:53.910]  There's a guy named Steve Friend.
[02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:54.910]  There's a guy named Garrett Boyle.
[02:44:54.910 --> 02:44:55.950]  They've all been in front of Congress.
[02:44:55.950 --> 02:44:59.830]  My buddy, George Hill, guys I never met when I was actually working for the bureau.
[02:44:59.830 --> 02:45:00.830]  We've come together.
[02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:03.670]  We've sort of coagulated afterwards because we've got to stick together because there's
[02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:04.670]  not very many of us.
[02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:06.230]  So we can watch each other's backs.
[02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:08.950]  And one of the things we realize is we send this meme back and forth, but it's always
[02:45:08.950 --> 02:45:12.310]  like the FBI agents looking at each other going, are we the bad guys?
[02:45:12.310 --> 02:45:13.310]  And they don't know.
[02:45:13.310 --> 02:45:15.910]  They really don't know that they're being the bad guys.
[02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:18.590]  But then at the same time, we know they sort of do know that because they're putting out
[02:45:18.590 --> 02:45:22.510]  these statements saying every field office needs to do a headcount and accountability.
[02:45:22.510 --> 02:45:25.950]  This is something you do in the military, what they call a recall roster to make sure
[02:45:25.950 --> 02:45:27.270]  that everybody is safe every weekend.
[02:45:27.270 --> 02:45:31.710]  And we want to hear the first instances of any threat needs to go directly to headquarters.
[02:45:31.710 --> 02:45:35.110]  So they do actually sort of know, but they don't accept it.
[02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:36.470]  They don't emotionally know it.
[02:45:36.470 --> 02:45:39.990]  They sort of like intellectually know that they're acting like the bad guys.
[02:45:39.990 --> 02:45:41.910]  And the reason why they do it is this.
[02:45:41.910 --> 02:45:45.350]  The reason why you're going to come after Catholics specifically, that was your original
[02:45:45.350 --> 02:45:48.190]  question is because you need to balkanize.
[02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:49.710]  You need to factionalize.
[02:45:49.710 --> 02:45:51.670]  You need to break things into parts.
[02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:52.670]  There's that.
[02:45:52.670 --> 02:45:53.670]  And I can't think of the guy's name anymore.
[02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:57.030]  I know he's a German that said basically, you know, they came for the whatever.
[02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:58.030]  They came for the communists.
[02:45:58.030 --> 02:45:59.030]  They came for the socialists.
[02:45:59.030 --> 02:46:00.030]  They came for the fill in the blanks.
[02:46:00.030 --> 02:46:01.030]  And it wasn't me.
[02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:02.270]  And so I just let it happen.
[02:46:02.270 --> 02:46:04.390]  They are coming for the radical traditional Catholics.
[02:46:04.390 --> 02:46:05.390]  That's a made up term, by the way.
[02:46:05.390 --> 02:46:06.390]  That's not a thing.
[02:46:06.390 --> 02:46:07.390]  That's real.
[02:46:07.390 --> 02:46:10.030]  But they're coming for the Catholics because you look at yourself, well, I'm not a radical
[02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:11.030]  traditional Catholic.
[02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:12.910]  I go to a mass that doesn't do Latin.
[02:46:12.910 --> 02:46:15.150]  OK, now they're going to now they've got their foot in the door.
[02:46:15.150 --> 02:46:18.670]  It's a pry bar to come after all Christianity, because the things that you're talking about.
[02:46:18.670 --> 02:46:20.430]  Let me explain this to people that don't understand it.
[02:46:20.430 --> 02:46:21.430]  Hitler did this first.
[02:46:21.430 --> 02:46:23.550]  That's correct.
[02:46:23.550 --> 02:46:25.510]  You pick a major group.
[02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:28.550]  Then you say, oh, it's only a certain group that's extreme in that.
[02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:32.150]  And when the group doesn't stand up for their own group, now the whole group's demonized.
[02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:33.150]  Correct.
[02:46:33.150 --> 02:46:34.150]  And now the whole group can be attacked.
[02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:35.910]  Exactly.
[02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:38.790]  So it's it's it's it's not just dividing groups against each other.
[02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:43.110]  It's dividing major blocks against themselves and letting the Justice Department run by
[02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:47.190]  a bunch of crazy leftists define what a Catholic is and what it isn't.
[02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:50.150]  You've now made this the government, the head of the church.
[02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:51.710]  It's very, very slick.
[02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:52.710]  No, it's really smooth.
[02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:53.710]  I mean, it's a thing.
[02:46:53.710 --> 02:46:54.710]  And here's here's the fun part about it.
[02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:59.110]  We know that the person who wrote that document was, in fact, a Catholic intelligence analyst.
[02:46:59.110 --> 02:47:01.430]  You know, I've got some access to information.
[02:47:01.430 --> 02:47:02.430]  So I did.
[02:47:02.430 --> 02:47:04.030]  It's a young man that graduated college recently.
[02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:07.750]  He went to Georgetown University, which is a Catholic university to Jesuit university.
[02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:11.390]  And the Jesuits are kind of a kind of a radical fringe within the Catholics on the liberal
[02:47:11.390 --> 02:47:12.390]  side of things.
[02:47:12.390 --> 02:47:13.390]  They are very left leaning.
[02:47:13.390 --> 02:47:17.790]  They believe in a thing that's called liberation theology, which is essentially Marxism.
[02:47:17.790 --> 02:47:20.030]  That's wearing Christianity, wearing Catholicism.
[02:47:20.030 --> 02:47:21.030]  And so that's who you have.
[02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:22.030]  Locusts.
[02:47:22.030 --> 02:47:25.650]  Yeah, it's 100 percent is a lot of those guys cut their teeth in, you know, in Latin America
[02:47:25.650 --> 02:47:27.230]  where things were unjust.
[02:47:27.230 --> 02:47:30.910]  But that doesn't mean that you can come in the United States and move Marxism into us.
[02:47:30.910 --> 02:47:34.830]  So they were they were basically drawing a line around one thing, OK?
[02:47:34.830 --> 02:47:40.630]  It's their positions on on abortion, their positions on the sort of gender ideology slash
[02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:44.630]  LGBTQ agenda and their their border security positions.
[02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:48.750]  Those things were the reasons that they said that these radical traditional Catholics, again,
[02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:51.750]  that's kind of trademark to the bureau, their own made up term.
[02:47:51.750 --> 02:47:57.470]  These RTCs were fertile breeding grounds for white supremacy recruitment.
[02:47:57.470 --> 02:48:02.030]  But if if that's the case, right, if that is the case, that these particular stances
[02:48:02.030 --> 02:48:06.990]  on these public issues make you a potential white supremacist, that that's not just all
[02:48:06.990 --> 02:48:07.990]  Catholics.
[02:48:07.990 --> 02:48:08.990]  It's all Christians.
[02:48:08.990 --> 02:48:11.630]  And like I said, it's a pry bar to get into mainstream religion.
[02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:15.950]  And my take on it is and this may be a little bit nuanced, but I think that we are seeing
[02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:20.790]  in real time right now progressive leftism, which means all the all the categorical definitions
[02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:23.070]  of Title seven as a religion, a religion.
[02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:24.070]  It is a religion.
[02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:25.070]  And it's a religion without God.
[02:48:25.070 --> 02:48:28.510]  Although they now officially say it's a religion, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you are just dead
[02:48:28.510 --> 02:48:29.510]  on and so impressive.
[02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:33.150]  We've only got to do five more in the next hour that I'm going to bring my other special
[02:48:33.150 --> 02:48:34.150]  guests in here.
[02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:35.150]  But please come back.
[02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:36.150]  It's so gracious you're here.
[02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:38.310]  Please get us in touch with all the other amazing whistleblowers.
[02:48:38.310 --> 02:48:39.310]  Very impressed.
[02:48:39.310 --> 02:48:41.470]  I'd love to think of the FBI as a bunch of men and women like you.
[02:48:41.470 --> 02:48:46.270]  I would get behind that smart, caring, intelligent, nuanced.
[02:48:46.270 --> 02:48:47.270]  That's what we need.
[02:48:47.270 --> 02:48:49.710]  Not a bunch of people carrying out a leftist takeover ideology.
[02:48:49.710 --> 02:48:53.350]  But the ten minutes we have left when the full audience is there, some stations don't
[02:48:53.350 --> 02:48:56.470]  care that first five cover the waterfront.
[02:48:56.470 --> 02:48:59.790]  Other things that need to be hit on where you think this Trump thing's going, what we
[02:48:59.790 --> 02:49:02.670]  do to save this country because of America goes down.
[02:49:02.670 --> 02:49:03.670]  The world's going down.
[02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:06.570]  I mean, just as a citizen, as a father, as a Christian.
[02:49:06.570 --> 02:49:07.570]  What do you think we should do?
[02:49:07.570 --> 02:49:08.570]  All right.
[02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:09.570]  So big pieces here.
[02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:10.570]  702 fives has got to go.
[02:49:10.570 --> 02:49:12.230]  Look, we may not have the political energy.
[02:49:12.230 --> 02:49:14.470]  There may not be a conservative movement to get rid of the bureau.
[02:49:14.470 --> 02:49:15.470]  I'm OK with that.
[02:49:15.470 --> 02:49:16.470]  I understand it.
[02:49:16.470 --> 02:49:17.470]  I think it should probably go.
[02:49:17.470 --> 02:49:20.230]  I think it's tarnished the brand and the badge to the point where, you know, if you went
[02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:23.990]  and bought a salad brand and you got sick with E.coli or a family member died, you wouldn't
[02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.990]  go back and buy that again.
[02:49:24.990 --> 02:49:26.430]  They'd have to change the name.
[02:49:26.430 --> 02:49:29.430]  So that's probably what should happen to a group like the FBI at this point.
[02:49:29.430 --> 02:49:30.430]  But I don't think it will.
[02:49:30.430 --> 02:49:32.350]  So FISA 702 is incredibly dangerous.
[02:49:32.350 --> 02:49:34.630]  I'll break it down for your for your audience very simply.
[02:49:34.630 --> 02:49:39.070]  As someone who used 702 FISA, there are two versions of the FISA, the Foreign Intelligence
[02:49:39.070 --> 02:49:40.670]  Surveillance Act.
[02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:45.510]  Part of it is something that we use domestically on people that are confirmed to be either
[02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:49.750]  tied to an intelligence agency or they're part of a foreign terrorist organization.
[02:49:50.270 --> 02:49:51.270]  They're kind of liberal with that definition.
[02:49:51.270 --> 02:49:52.550]  It goes in front of a secret court.
[02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:54.890]  That's the whole thing they did going after Carter Page and Trump.
[02:49:54.890 --> 02:49:58.890]  That's the quote unquote full FISA 702 is something else altogether.
[02:49:58.890 --> 02:50:04.750]  And while a full FISA takes weeks and sometimes months to put together, a 702 FISA can be done
[02:50:04.750 --> 02:50:05.750]  in the morning.
[02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:08.030]  I can I've done them in the morning, literally before noon.
[02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:11.070]  I'm filing it and we're getting it approved, you know, within a couple of days.
[02:50:11.070 --> 02:50:17.190]  And what it targets are non-U.S. persons, OK, that are non-U.S. based.
[02:50:17.190 --> 02:50:20.070]  So imagine film a blank country and a spy from that country.
[02:50:20.070 --> 02:50:21.750]  We can go get a 702 on them.
[02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:24.790]  When we do so, we're going to get all the information and all the things they touch
[02:50:24.790 --> 02:50:26.650]  on U.S. telecom services.
[02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:27.650]  That's going to be emails.
[02:50:27.650 --> 02:50:28.650]  That's going to be phone calls.
[02:50:28.650 --> 02:50:31.170]  If they have unencrypted Skype, all that stuff that all gets out there.
[02:50:31.170 --> 02:50:35.230]  We can bring it into a little, you know, program called DWS and we can read it and we can look
[02:50:35.230 --> 02:50:36.230]  at it.
[02:50:36.230 --> 02:50:37.230]  We can find out what they're doing.
[02:50:37.230 --> 02:50:38.230]  Here's the problem.
[02:50:38.230 --> 02:50:41.070]  When you have an FBI agent, their actual job is not special agent.
[02:50:41.070 --> 02:50:42.070]  That's not a real thing.
[02:50:42.070 --> 02:50:43.270]  Their job is criminal investigator.
[02:50:43.270 --> 02:50:44.750]  So they are looking for that thing.
[02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:46.150]  They are looking for crimes.
[02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:47.150]  All of us are.
[02:50:47.150 --> 02:50:48.570]  That's the way we think.
[02:50:48.570 --> 02:50:52.350]  And so they're going to go after and try to find the U.S. citizens that are actually involved
[02:50:52.350 --> 02:50:56.150]  in that net with this particular spy who's documented as a spy.
[02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:58.910]  And we want to find out what Americans are talking to them, OK?
[02:50:58.910 --> 02:51:02.670]  But that's expressly illegal under the 702 statute underneath the FISA.
[02:51:02.670 --> 02:51:04.590]  It's called reverse targeting and it's illegal.
[02:51:04.590 --> 02:51:09.270]  So imagine you've got people from a, you know, take your pick, TSA, right?
[02:51:09.270 --> 02:51:11.430]  They're going to send everybody through a metal detector.
[02:51:11.430 --> 02:51:12.430]  You're going to use the metal detector.
[02:51:12.430 --> 02:51:15.550]  Everyone's got to walk through and you can not allow to bring a gun on an airplane.
[02:51:15.550 --> 02:51:17.430]  But the TSA also has this other problem.
[02:51:17.430 --> 02:51:20.230]  You're not allowed to use the metal detector to find guns, but don't let anyone bring a
[02:51:20.230 --> 02:51:21.230]  gun on the plane.
[02:51:21.230 --> 02:51:22.230]  You can't do it.
[02:51:22.230 --> 02:51:24.170]  You can't use that tool in a lawful way.
[02:51:24.170 --> 02:51:26.270]  And so 702 FISA is the basics of it.
[02:51:26.270 --> 02:51:30.030]  The longer mission of it is we should be getting rid of the domestic intelligence mission
[02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:31.270]  for the FBI.
[02:51:31.270 --> 02:51:33.550]  If it's going to be another agency altogether, great.
[02:51:33.550 --> 02:51:35.430]  If it's not going to happen at all, I think that's better.
[02:51:35.430 --> 02:51:36.550]  I'm pro freedom.
[02:51:36.550 --> 02:51:39.430]  And then the last real piece that we can do actually, and this is what people can actually
[02:51:39.430 --> 02:51:40.430]  do.
[02:51:40.430 --> 02:51:41.550]  Go out and meet your local sheriff.
[02:51:41.550 --> 02:51:44.190]  Go out and meet the law enforcement people that are in your world.
[02:51:44.190 --> 02:51:47.350]  And you need to convince them to stay away from federal task force.
[02:51:47.350 --> 02:51:49.750]  We need to have a 10th amendment revolution in this country.
[02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:51.590]  That's the only way that this war stays bloodless.
[02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:52.910]  We're already in a war.
[02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:54.470]  You know, it's a fifth generation war.
[02:51:54.470 --> 02:51:58.270]  Your, your, your channel has been well ahead of the curve by calling it info wars.
[02:51:58.270 --> 02:51:59.710]  5GW is a real thing.
[02:51:59.710 --> 02:52:01.230]  It's been going on for a long time.
[02:52:01.230 --> 02:52:05.750]  People always talk about the quote unquote PSYOP, the PSYOP is a battle 5GW is the war
[02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:10.050]  and we are dealing with a civil war that is right now, you know, going after everybody.
[02:52:10.050 --> 02:52:11.230]  So how do we fix that?
[02:52:11.230 --> 02:52:15.150]  You do it locally and you get the federal government out of our local law enforcement.
[02:52:15.150 --> 02:52:16.150]  That's the weapon.
[02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:19.130]  That's the teeth of the federal government to touch you in a meaningful way.
[02:52:19.130 --> 02:52:22.870]  So pull out a task force that have the IRS pull out of the DEA task force.
[02:52:22.870 --> 02:52:25.550]  You don't need local sheriffs and you don't need sheriff's deputies.
[02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:28.090]  You don't need local police departments doing that.
[02:52:28.090 --> 02:52:32.670]  And that happens by you agitating, you know, at the base level in your own community and
[02:52:32.670 --> 02:52:34.790]  try to keep these things away.
[02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:38.510]  And when the federal government is neutered in that way, and it is a big neutering, if
[02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:42.110]  you go listen to what the ATF director said the other day, Merrick Garland said a number
[02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:45.770]  of times, we can't do our jobs unless we get local law enforcement support.
[02:52:45.770 --> 02:52:47.150]  So take that support away.
[02:52:47.150 --> 02:52:49.150]  We actually have the ability to do things like that.
[02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:50.990]  So that is something that we can do to keep it bloodless.
[02:52:50.990 --> 02:52:52.830]  Let me shift gears just a minute.
[02:52:52.830 --> 02:52:57.070]  Just as a citizen, but also former FBI agent, what do you see with the obvious persecution
[02:52:57.070 --> 02:53:00.270]  of Trump that they admitted they sent these special units to do it?
[02:53:00.270 --> 02:53:01.270]  It's ridiculous.
[02:53:01.270 --> 02:53:03.190]  And now they're going to try to indict him.
[02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:06.710]  They're saying for J6, just totally bizarre.
[02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:08.670]  Democrats have created alternate delegates before.
[02:53:08.670 --> 02:53:09.670]  They've challenged elections before.
[02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:13.070]  They were following set deals.
[02:53:13.070 --> 02:53:14.470]  What do you think about Jack Smith?
[02:53:14.470 --> 02:53:20.790]  I mean, he was really shaken in his one little statement the day after he indicted Trump
[02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:21.990]  or the day of.
[02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:24.870]  I mean, is he being, is there a gun to his head?
[02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:26.550]  I mean, how are they getting this guy to do this?
[02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:30.550]  I know he was trained over at the UN as one of their prosecutors.
[02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:32.910]  But I mean, this is backfiring with everybody.
[02:53:32.910 --> 02:53:35.110]  And now they're saying more indictments.
[02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:38.990]  I mean, you're just saying the FBI is disconnected.
[02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:40.630]  Where do you see this going?
[02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:43.510]  I think that they've pretty much confirmed that Trump's going to be the nominee by doing
[02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:44.510]  this kind of stuff.
[02:53:44.510 --> 02:53:45.790]  It's kind of like the Harry Potter thing, right?
[02:53:45.790 --> 02:53:48.830]  Like they chose their enemy and they ordained him to be the thing that they wanted him to
[02:53:48.830 --> 02:53:49.830]  be.
[02:53:49.830 --> 02:53:51.230]  And now he's going to have all the spotlight of it.
[02:53:51.230 --> 02:53:52.430]  And Trump, you know, he's a mud monster.
[02:53:52.430 --> 02:53:55.030]  He's going to soak up all the stuff that's not going to hurt the Trump brand of people
[02:53:55.030 --> 02:53:56.030]  that love Trump.
[02:53:56.030 --> 02:53:58.550]  And it's also going to make people look at it and go, that is very unfair.
[02:53:58.550 --> 02:54:01.190]  The American people do not like to see fundamental unfairness.
[02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:04.790]  And so if people are at least open minded enough to see that this is totally outside
[02:54:05.470 --> 02:54:08.670]  the bounds, that's what needs to be hammered, at least on the any alternative media.
[02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:12.510]  It needs to be explaining, you know, the mainstream media is full on accepting the spoon fed
[02:54:12.510 --> 02:54:16.710]  narrative from the from the Justice Department, from the Biden administration, which I think
[02:54:16.710 --> 02:54:18.630]  are really, really dangerous stuff.
[02:54:18.630 --> 02:54:20.070]  So we need to just hammer home.
[02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:23.070]  And Fox's ratings are down almost 60 percent.
[02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:26.030]  Sorry to interrupt. Fox is down 60 percent.
[02:54:26.030 --> 02:54:30.430]  Anheuser-Busch has lost 40 something billion target or 20 something billion target, 20
[02:54:30.430 --> 02:54:34.750]  something billion. They are falling apart in front of us and they just keep like
[02:54:34.750 --> 02:54:36.870]  zombies attacking no matter what.
[02:54:36.990 --> 02:54:38.150]  Yep. They don't know any better.
[02:54:38.230 --> 02:54:40.430]  I'll tell you this, Alex, this is the thing that I think is really important.
[02:54:40.430 --> 02:54:41.950]  A lot of people get what they call black pilled.
[02:54:42.070 --> 02:54:44.870]  We've had a lot of people sort of open their eyes up and be red pilled in the world.
[02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:46.950]  And, you know, I always believe that there's a lot of hope.
[02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:51.070]  And the reason why I think there's hope is because in 2020 and in 2021, the federal
[02:54:51.070 --> 02:54:54.470]  government and all the mechanisms behind it that were corrupted and they were doing
[02:54:54.470 --> 02:54:55.950]  things like, you know, working with big tech.
[02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:58.310]  We've seen all that stuff. But people saw it with their own eyes.
[02:54:58.430 --> 02:55:00.150]  The goalposts were moved in real time.
[02:55:00.430 --> 02:55:03.750]  They skipped probably 10 years worth of slow, progressive marching.
[02:55:03.870 --> 02:55:05.350]  And they said, we've got a moment.
[02:55:05.390 --> 02:55:06.510]  We're going to press our advantage.
[02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:07.830]  And everybody saw it.
[02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:12.710]  And so people have opened their eyes up in a way that was not common before that,
[02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:14.070]  because it was much more incremental.
[02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:15.430]  It was much more insidious.
[02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:19.430]  And since that's happened, it gives everybody in the you know, that just wants to
[02:55:19.430 --> 02:55:22.030]  free America, that just wants to be left alone so we can raise our kids the way we
[02:55:22.030 --> 02:55:25.390]  want and, you know, teach them the things that we think are our values.
[02:55:25.470 --> 02:55:29.470]  It's given us an opportunity and a break in that action to really disrupt the cycle
[02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:30.550]  of indoctrination.
[02:55:30.670 --> 02:55:32.070]  So that's a big deal to me.
[02:55:32.590 --> 02:55:33.750]  It keeps me hopeful.
[02:55:33.790 --> 02:55:36.070]  It doesn't mean I don't go to bed defeated almost every night I do.
[02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:39.350]  I'm exhausted. You know, you put all this stuff out here in front of me and and this
[02:55:39.350 --> 02:55:41.150]  stuff is what I do for free for a while.
[02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:42.750]  And now I'm getting paid to do it. And so that's even better.
[02:55:42.750 --> 02:55:47.390]  But, you know, the message is that there is hope because all the struggle is worth
[02:55:47.390 --> 02:55:49.990]  it. You know, my wife is pregnant right now and she signs on for it, too.
[02:55:49.990 --> 02:55:51.550]  She's like, you've got to get to work.
[02:55:51.550 --> 02:55:52.550]  You've got to talk to people.
[02:55:52.670 --> 02:55:55.190]  She's got all my kids at a OB appointment right now.
[02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:57.150]  And when you say you get let me interrupt you.
[02:55:57.430 --> 02:56:00.230]  When you say you do it to be paid, they'll say, I paid you to come on and say this.
[02:56:00.350 --> 02:56:01.830]  You have your own popular show.
[02:56:01.830 --> 02:56:03.110]  Correct. Everybody's got to check out.
[02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.750]  A hundred percent.
[02:56:03.750 --> 02:56:05.550]  Sheriff and I want to say this.
[02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:07.030]  I've known FBI agents growing up.
[02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:09.790]  They're friends of my family. And I'm coming to the office and ask questions.
[02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:11.390]  Seem like nice gals and people.
[02:56:11.390 --> 02:56:13.310]  But you've seen the quality go down over the years.
[02:56:13.310 --> 02:56:17.350]  More and more political, more and more slob like in the old days when I was a kid.
[02:56:17.350 --> 02:56:18.950]  The FBI just came over to play chess with my dad.
[02:56:18.950 --> 02:56:20.390]  We're like really smart, cool guys.
[02:56:20.710 --> 02:56:24.550]  And so you see that the lowering of quality across the board.
[02:56:24.750 --> 02:56:28.190]  But you seem like a really smart, slick guy.
[02:56:28.430 --> 02:56:30.150]  By slick, very well spoken.
[02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:33.270]  Are you the exception or kind of the midline?
[02:56:33.430 --> 02:56:35.710]  And I mean, I would say no wonder they were upset by you
[02:56:35.710 --> 02:56:37.950]  because you were in there challenging their narratives.
[02:56:37.950 --> 02:56:39.070]  I mean, I'm not kissing your ass.
[02:56:39.070 --> 02:56:42.350]  You just seem like a really smart guy because I'm immersed in this.
[02:56:42.550 --> 02:56:43.510]  And we're just clicking.
[02:56:43.510 --> 02:56:45.470]  Everything you're saying is actually teaching me a lot
[02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:48.230]  because I already know what's going on, but I'm actually learning something.
[02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:49.510]  A lot of guests, I don't learn anything.
[02:56:49.510 --> 02:56:50.950]  I'm learning a lot today.
[02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:55.470]  And so are you the average of the FBI or where would you place yourself in
[02:56:55.470 --> 02:56:57.350]  understanding, you know, to be candid?
[02:56:57.350 --> 02:56:58.870]  I don't think I'm the average anywhere I go.
[02:56:58.870 --> 02:57:00.110]  So I just kind of say that.
[02:57:00.110 --> 02:57:01.870]  And it's not very humble to say, but I think it's accurate.
[02:57:02.190 --> 02:57:03.590]  But I'm not unique within the FBI.
[02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:05.110]  There's a lot of very talented people.
[02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:07.470]  But a lot isn't the majority by any means.
[02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:10.070]  There's a lot of you know, there's there's also a fair number of people,
[02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:12.950]  you know, that are below average for FBI standards.
[02:57:13.110 --> 02:57:14.310]  Bigger FBI agents go in.
[02:57:14.310 --> 02:57:18.230]  They're probably 75th percentile capabilities in most places and above.
[02:57:18.470 --> 02:57:20.550]  So, you know, you're going to have one percenters in there,
[02:57:20.550 --> 02:57:22.310]  but you're going to have 75th percenters.
[02:57:22.310 --> 02:57:24.470]  I had a guy in my class whose last job he was, you know,
[02:57:24.470 --> 02:57:26.230]  unarmed security guard at the Detroit Zoo.
[02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:26.870]  He's still an agent.
[02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:28.030]  He probably doesn't have any problems.
[02:57:28.030 --> 02:57:30.030]  I've got other friends that were special operations guys.
[02:57:30.030 --> 02:57:32.990]  And, you know, they're highly capable and they probably run into problems
[02:57:32.990 --> 02:57:34.390]  because they're outside the box thinkers.
[02:57:34.390 --> 02:57:35.190]  They're gray area guys.
[02:57:35.190 --> 02:57:37.350]  So it's not all that common, but we're not unique either.
[02:57:38.910 --> 02:57:40.110]  All right. Five more minutes.
[02:57:40.110 --> 02:57:41.430]  Very impressive.
[02:57:41.430 --> 02:57:42.150]  Be good, guys.
[02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:43.430]  The FBI on the whistle.
[02:57:43.430 --> 02:57:44.070]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:44.070 --> 02:57:46.950]  We have more experts coming as well this time from the NSA.
[02:57:48.950 --> 02:57:52.430]  Two of our best selling nootropics or brain boosters
[02:57:52.710 --> 02:57:56.270]  are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com for a limited time.
[02:57:56.350 --> 02:57:59.350]  They're 50 percent off when you get them together or 40 percent off
[02:57:59.350 --> 02:58:00.310]  when you get them individually.
[02:58:00.310 --> 02:58:04.510]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, two separate formulas.
[02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:07.150]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[02:58:07.470 --> 02:58:11.310]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy.
[02:58:11.470 --> 02:58:13.190]  Again, with no hangover or letdown.
[02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:16.190]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula.
[02:58:16.310 --> 02:58:18.670]  That's Brain Force Ultra that hits really, really quick.
[02:58:18.830 --> 02:58:19.310]  And I love it.
[02:58:19.310 --> 02:58:20.750]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[02:58:20.750 --> 02:58:22.830]  So if I've got to work at night, I don't want to stay up all night.
[02:58:22.990 --> 02:58:25.030]  I can take it and say nine o'clock at night.
[02:58:25.070 --> 02:58:27.470]  I stay up till midnight, working, doing a radio interview or something.
[02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:30.470]  And boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:32.830]  And then I get two, three hours of energy.
[02:58:32.830 --> 02:58:34.150]  And then you go right to bed after it.
[02:58:34.150 --> 02:58:37.630]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50 percent off by themselves
[02:58:37.790 --> 02:58:39.550]  or 40 percent off individually.
[02:58:39.550 --> 02:58:40.950]  A lot of people love these products.
[02:58:40.950 --> 02:58:42.110]  They've got five star reviews.
[02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:43.870]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[02:58:43.870 --> 02:58:46.630]  50 percent off InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:46.830 --> 02:58:47.990]  You wanted to plug Rainforce.
[02:58:47.990 --> 02:58:48.990]  Do you like Rainforce?
[02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:49.510]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:51.510]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Lavigne.
[02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:53.830]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[02:58:53.830 --> 02:58:55.670]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz.
[02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:57.830]  Four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:59.830]  And now two books with Alex Jones.
[02:59:00.110 --> 02:59:03.390]  That's because I use Brain Force every day.
[02:59:03.470 --> 02:59:07.550]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[02:59:07.550 --> 02:59:11.470]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[02:59:11.470 --> 02:59:16.750]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Brain Force.
[02:59:16.950 --> 02:59:20.910]  I'll take Brain Force in the morning right before I go to my computer
[02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:24.710]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:29.190]  So it really is true that Brain Force is something I use every day.
[02:59:29.190 --> 02:59:30.790]  And it helps me with my writing.
[02:59:30.790 --> 02:59:31.590]  All right. We love you.
[02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:32.190]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:32.190 --> 02:59:37.270]  Get your Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra and Turbo Force at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:37.270 --> 02:59:38.430]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[02:59:38.950 --> 02:59:48.950]  .
[02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:53.230]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:53.470 --> 02:59:55.150]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:56.700 --> 03:00:16.060]  Quick, we really appreciate Kyle Serafin of KyleSerafin.com, former FBI agent, major
[03:00:16.060 --> 03:00:17.060]  whistleblower joining us.
[03:00:17.060 --> 03:00:21.020]  I'm about to move my other guest who are in studio in here, so I'm going to let him host
[03:00:21.020 --> 03:00:22.420]  the next five minutes, sir.
[03:00:22.420 --> 03:00:25.220]  You'll close out this five minutes, you're a talk show host.
[03:00:25.220 --> 03:00:26.220]  You can do it.
[03:00:26.220 --> 03:00:27.220]  You don't need me to pop in.
[03:00:27.220 --> 03:00:28.220]  I'll be sitting right here.
[03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:30.780]  But Kyle Serafin, you've got the last four and a half minutes, sir.
[03:00:30.780 --> 03:00:31.780]  I really appreciate it.
[03:00:31.780 --> 03:00:34.500]  And Alex, thanks for sharing your audience with me.
[03:00:34.500 --> 03:00:37.020]  It's very appreciated in a big way.
[03:00:37.020 --> 03:00:39.540]  I think it's really important that people don't give up hope.
[03:00:39.540 --> 03:00:42.760]  I think that it's important that people understand that this is a conflict and it's a bloodless
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:44.160]  conflict right now.
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:49.580]  We are in a non-kinetic war, kinetic being the movement and using actual ordinance, using
[03:00:49.580 --> 03:00:50.580]  weapons.
[03:00:50.580 --> 03:00:54.500]  We are using the mind right now, we're using the microphone, we're using public communications,
[03:00:54.500 --> 03:00:57.780]  we're on Twitter, we're on true social, we're on these places, social media.
[03:00:57.780 --> 03:00:59.300]  And we are pushing back against an agenda.
[03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:04.140]  It's very critical that people understand that while those things are kind of not real,
[03:01:04.140 --> 03:01:05.140]  right?
[03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:08.460]  There's just a, this is our fellow Americans from, and a lot of them are bots and coming
[03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:09.460]  in from other places.
[03:01:09.460 --> 03:01:14.240]  But it is, it is a fight for the, for the narrative and it's a fight for putting truth
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:15.240]  out there.
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:18.100]  We've got a couple of good footholds in there that we can, that we can use.
[03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:20.580]  And I really encourage people not to give up hope.
[03:01:20.580 --> 03:01:23.140]  I keep running into people that do it and every time I talk about them, they get fired
[03:01:23.140 --> 03:01:24.140]  up again.
[03:01:24.780 --> 03:01:27.300]  We need to continue to keep each other motivated to share information.
[03:01:27.300 --> 03:01:31.100]  That's one true to, we need to be nuanced in our approaches.
[03:01:31.100 --> 03:01:35.740]  We need to be, you know, watching our rhetoric for emotional language, which I'm always kind
[03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:36.740]  of cautious of.
[03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:37.740]  I'm Alex.
[03:01:37.740 --> 03:01:38.740]  I'm more built like you.
[03:01:38.740 --> 03:01:42.140]  I tend to get like really fired up and I tend to say things that are more emotionally charged.
[03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:45.220]  But if we're really smart about this thing, the people that are in the middle that need
[03:01:45.220 --> 03:01:50.620]  to be won over, they need to hear balanced, intelligent, articulate thoughts.
[03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:55.780]  They need to hear the truth in a way that is non-inflammatory and they need to be given
[03:01:55.780 --> 03:02:00.660]  an opportunity without being attacked to be able to join, you know, at least common cause
[03:02:00.660 --> 03:02:01.660]  with most of it.
[03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:05.220]  I heard Vivek Ramaswamy in front of a bunch of libertarians the other day, he said something
[03:02:05.220 --> 03:02:06.220]  really, really critical.
[03:02:06.220 --> 03:02:10.540]  I think he said, if you agree with 75% of what I say, then we're on the same team.
[03:02:10.540 --> 03:02:11.900]  And that's really it.
[03:02:11.900 --> 03:02:13.140]  America is the same team.
[03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:14.140]  It's always been.
[03:02:14.140 --> 03:02:16.100]  It's still the best place to live in this world.
[03:02:16.100 --> 03:02:18.100]  As far as I could tell, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
[03:02:18.100 --> 03:02:19.100]  I have traveled.
[03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:21.660]  I've seen what kind of threats exist in other nations.
[03:02:21.660 --> 03:02:25.740]  I've worked with friends who are working counterintelligence when it comes to, you know, global threats
[03:02:25.740 --> 03:02:26.740]  and so on.
[03:02:26.740 --> 03:02:29.660]  And I don't want to raise my kids in any other environment, but I would love to raise my
[03:02:29.660 --> 03:02:33.580]  kids like 30 or 40 years ago, the way I was raised, because that was a much better America.
[03:02:33.580 --> 03:02:37.300]  It was much more homogenous and we all understood that there were these same values.
[03:02:37.300 --> 03:02:40.540]  Right now we're fighting against sort of leftist values and they are incredibly dangerous.
[03:02:40.540 --> 03:02:45.840]  So we have to do so in a way that's both fair, but we cannot pull punches.
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.000]  We cannot walk away from the truth because it's inconvenient or because it's not palatable
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:51.560]  or because it doesn't pull well.
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:54.920]  I had somebody tell me the other day, we can't quote Hitler because it's a third rail.
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:02:55.920]  No, that's not.
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:02:56.920]  That's incorrect.
[03:02:56.920 --> 03:02:57.920]  That's false.
[03:02:57.920 --> 03:02:58.920]  We have to do that sort of thing.
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:00.640]  We have to engage where the battle is.
[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:03.360]  And if people are acting like Hitler, then we need to expose it.
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:05.240]  And of course, the left has no problem.
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:08.840]  The political left has no problem right now, you know, declaring that all of their opponents
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:10.680]  are in fact Hitlerian.
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:12.800]  We all remember the orange man bad situation.
[03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:14.360]  This is what they declared about Trump.
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:15.560]  And it's obviously untrue.
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:19.820]  So we've got to continue to push the envelope where it is in ways that are fair, in ways
[03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:23.680]  that are just, in ways that are truthful and honest, and in ways that are also, you know,
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:26.600]  respectful, except when it doesn't need to be respectful.
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:31.440]  I think a great analogy would be the way that Patrick Swayze's character did in Roadhouse.
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:34.640]  You know, people do something to you and you be nice.
[03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:37.300]  You do, you know, they say something else and you be nice.
[03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:40.320]  You continue to move them along nicely until it's time to not be nice.
[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:43.280]  And there are plenty of times that we're all going to see when it's time to not be nice.
[03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:44.640]  But we need to be smart about when that is.
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:49.840]  We need to be judicious with our aggression, which can be mostly verbal right now, luckily.
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:51.400]  And people need to act locally.
[03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:52.800]  Like I said, they need to go to their sheriff's departments.
[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:54.120]  They need to make these things happen.
[03:03:54.120 --> 03:03:55.600]  We are not beyond the pale.
[03:03:55.600 --> 03:03:57.760]  We are not beyond a place where we can be recovered.
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:03:59.840]  But it's going to take some really tough times.
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:03.120]  My good friend George Hill, who was an FBI whistleblower and testified in front of Congress,
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:05.080]  he brought forward some stuff about Bank of America.
[03:04:05.080 --> 03:04:06.080]  People have seen it.
[03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:10.300]  One of the things he said was that right now we are in a stagnant air situation and there's
[03:04:10.300 --> 03:04:11.960]  a cold front coming in.
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:15.040]  When cold fronts come in, you get aggressive weather.
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:16.040]  You get storms.
[03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:17.040]  You get lightning.
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:18.040]  Tornadoes.
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:19.040]  Yep.
[03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:20.040]  All these things can happen.
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:21.040]  And guess what?
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:22.040]  At the end of it, you wake up in the morning.
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:23.200]  Kyle, very, very impressive, my friend.
[03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:24.200]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:25.200]  You give me a lot more hope.
[03:04:25.200 --> 03:04:29.840]  And when I see the FBI agents up there in Congress, it gives me hope.
[03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:33.160]  And I just hope the establishment pulls back with their arrogance before it's too late for
[03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:37.520]  everybody because this is the unstoppable force meets the immovable object, and it's going
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:40.800]  to be explosive if people don't get some sanity now.
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:41.800]  KyleSerafin.com.
[03:04:41.800 --> 03:04:42.800]  God bless you.
[03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:43.800]  Be safe.
[03:04:43.800 --> 03:04:44.800]  And hopefully, we can talk again soon.
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:45.800]  And hopefully, you can come back to Austin.
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:46.800]  I can shake your hand.
[03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:47.800]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:48.800]  You bet.
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:49.800]  I'd love to.
[03:04:49.800 --> 03:04:50.800]  Smart guy, folks.
[03:04:50.800 --> 03:04:51.800]  Wow.
[03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:52.800]  The type of guys like that built this country.
[03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:53.800]  And now we're overrun by a bunch of pedophiles.
[03:04:53.800 --> 03:04:54.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[03:04:54.800 --> 03:04:55.800]  book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:04:55.800 --> 03:04:56.800]  That is a hellish future.
[03:04:56.800 --> 03:04:57.800]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:04:57.800 --> 03:04:58.800]  you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, you'll
[03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:11.320]  always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get
[03:05:11.320 --> 03:05:15.360]  an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or
[03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:16.760]  Infowarshore.com.
[03:05:16.760 --> 03:05:20.880]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[03:05:20.880 --> 03:05:22.320]  we got run out.
[03:05:22.320 --> 03:05:24.880]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:30.280]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarshore.com.
[03:05:30.280 --> 03:05:34.200]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:05:34.200 --> 03:05:38.040]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[03:05:38.040 --> 03:05:39.720]  you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:43.320]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[03:05:43.320 --> 03:05:44.320]  copies.
[03:05:44.320 --> 03:05:48.920]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed
[03:05:48.920 --> 03:05:53.360]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the
[03:05:53.360 --> 03:05:54.360]  local school.
[03:05:54.360 --> 03:05:55.360]  This is an Infowar.
[03:05:55.360 --> 03:05:56.360]  I'm counting on you.
[03:05:56.360 --> 03:05:58.360]  And thank you for your support.
[03:06:10.360 --> 03:06:12.360]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:06:12.360 --> 03:06:14.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:15.360 --> 03:06:24.360]  Well, when I came here last week and had time to actually be at the River Church with
[03:06:24.360 --> 03:06:28.360]  the great Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, Revival.com, I got to meet a lot of people that I didn't
[03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:29.360]  know.
[03:06:29.360 --> 03:06:30.360]  A lot of amazing people.
[03:06:30.360 --> 03:06:33.360]  Thousands and thousands and thousands have come through here, even when they're not having
[03:06:33.360 --> 03:06:34.360]  church.
[03:06:34.360 --> 03:06:38.360]  But I already knew who Pastor J.C. Hall was, I already knew his wife, his constitutional
[03:06:38.360 --> 03:06:44.360]  lawyer, Chris Ann Hall, because I've promoted and seen their constitutional sheriff's film.
[03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:49.360]  You just heard the last guest, huge whistleblower, FBI agent saying, this is the answer.
[03:06:49.360 --> 03:06:52.360]  And so I wanted to get them on.
[03:06:52.360 --> 03:06:56.360]  But then talking to her husband, I'd seen him on air before, but I wasn't familiar with
[03:06:56.360 --> 03:06:57.360]  his background.
[03:06:57.360 --> 03:07:03.360]  He was telling me that he agreed with my analysis last weekend on the whole Russia attempted
[03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:04.360]  coup by Purgogin.
[03:07:04.360 --> 03:07:06.360]  And I said, oh, really?
[03:07:06.360 --> 03:07:07.360]  Why?
[03:07:07.360 --> 03:07:08.360]  And then he sent me his bio.
[03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:12.360]  He speaks fluent Russian, and he worked in the United States Navy.
[03:07:12.360 --> 03:07:13.360]  He worked at the NSA.
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:15.360]  It would take an hour to go over his whole bio.
[03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:19.360]  But he was actually over some of the programs there, over the training, and he's really,
[03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:20.360]  really smart.
[03:07:20.360 --> 03:07:22.360]  A lot of points on that.
[03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:25.360]  So I wanted to bring this fellow in here with his wife, because I was first wanting
[03:07:25.360 --> 03:07:28.360]  to get her on, and then after talking to him, I'm like, wow, this is amazing.
[03:07:28.360 --> 03:07:29.360]  So he's sitting right next to me.
[03:07:29.360 --> 03:07:31.360]  She's sitting right over there.
[03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:34.360]  Pastor J.C. Hall and Chris Ann Hall are with us.
[03:07:34.360 --> 03:07:35.360]  A lot of points to go over.
[03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:37.360]  A lot to talk about.
[03:07:37.360 --> 03:07:41.360]  But just first off, ending that last interview, you guys were sitting over there in the dark
[03:07:41.360 --> 03:07:44.360]  of the studio as the studio audience.
[03:07:44.360 --> 03:07:46.360]  What did you make of Kyle Serafin?
[03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:48.360]  I've seen him in front of Congress.
[03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:49.360]  I knew he was one of the main whistleblowers.
[03:07:49.360 --> 03:07:53.360]  But man, that guy was very smart, very impressive, because I'm immersed in this.
[03:07:53.360 --> 03:07:54.360]  So are you.
[03:07:54.360 --> 03:07:55.360]  And so we do this full time.
[03:07:55.360 --> 03:07:58.360]  We know and we talk to so many people in the government.
[03:07:58.360 --> 03:08:00.360]  They don't even seem to know what planet they're on.
[03:08:00.360 --> 03:08:02.360]  If they knew, they'd be really concerned like we are.
[03:08:02.360 --> 03:08:05.360]  But this guy was really dialed in and he was saying a lot of folks are dialed in.
[03:08:05.360 --> 03:08:08.360]  So that was really hopeful for me.
[03:08:08.360 --> 03:08:09.360]  Yeah.
[03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:10.360]  Yeah.
[03:08:10.360 --> 03:08:11.360]  It's encouraging.
[03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:12.360]  What did you think?
[03:08:12.360 --> 03:08:17.360]  Well, you know, I have the opportunity to actually work sometimes with FBI agents.
[03:08:17.360 --> 03:08:22.360]  I actually had an FBI agent just sitting in my office a few weeks ago.
[03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:28.360]  And I looked her straight in the eye and I said, what do you think about all of these
[03:08:28.360 --> 03:08:32.360]  misconducts, all this misdeed being brought forward about the FBI?
[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:38.360]  I mean, how do you find yourself able to go to work every day knowing that the public
[03:08:38.360 --> 03:08:45.360]  perception is the FBI is this completely rogue, corrupt agency?
[03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:47.360]  And she told me, I'll be honest with you.
[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:51.360]  There are days where I cry every day.
[03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:56.360]  But she says, I still believe there's only one thing I've ever wanted to do.
[03:08:56.360 --> 03:08:57.360]  This is what I wanted to do.
[03:08:57.360 --> 03:08:59.360]  This is the call on my life.
[03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:04.360]  And I'm going to do it to the best of my ability, to the clearest of my conscience,
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:09.360]  regardless of the bad players that are giving us bad press.
[03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:13.360]  Well, we're seeing hundreds of whistleblowers, thousands total across the government.
[03:09:13.360 --> 03:09:15.360]  I don't know how the system is going to survive this.
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:19.360]  I think they're just they know they're all going to jail at the top of the Clinton,
[03:09:19.360 --> 03:09:23.360]  Obama, New World Order crime machine, the Klaus Schwab crime machine, the Bill Gates crime machine.
[03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:26.360]  So they have really the answer is they don't have any other choice.
[03:09:26.360 --> 03:09:30.360]  So historically, this is going to get bad, but it's going to get better after that.
[03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:31.360]  Your take on that?
[03:09:31.360 --> 03:09:33.360]  Yeah, I think it's interesting.
[03:09:33.360 --> 03:09:39.360]  We look back at the origin history of the FBI and we get to the church committee hearings
[03:09:39.360 --> 03:09:42.360]  and you start to see these reforms and different things they did.
[03:09:42.360 --> 03:09:44.360]  It's almost like we're rewinding the clock.
[03:09:44.360 --> 03:09:45.360]  We've gone back to the J.
[03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:47.360]  Edgar Hoover days of the FBI.
[03:09:47.360 --> 03:09:50.360]  So you have is so corrupt and leadership at the top.
[03:09:50.360 --> 03:09:52.360]  And we run into people like that.
[03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:55.360]  There's still good people trying to do the right thing, trying to be, you know,
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:09:57.360]  that are patriots that love America.
[03:09:57.360 --> 03:10:01.360]  But they're stuck in this organization with absolutely,
[03:10:01.360 --> 03:10:06.360]  totally corrupt to the core leadership that is defending all the corruption.
[03:10:06.360 --> 03:10:07.360]  Absolutely.
[03:10:07.360 --> 03:10:09.360]  And have no like back to J.
[03:10:09.360 --> 03:10:13.360]  Edgar, who have no restraint, spy on citizens, lock them up, destroy their lives,
[03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:15.360]  go after them for these political motivations.
[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:17.360]  It's unreal what we're seeing.
[03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:23.360]  It is your take on Trump and McCarthy saying he's finally going to try to impeach the
[03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:24.360]  attorney general.
[03:10:24.360 --> 03:10:25.360]  That's what we need to see.
[03:10:25.360 --> 03:10:29.360]  But, I mean, this is making Trump explode in popularity every time they
[03:10:29.360 --> 03:10:31.360]  indict him to record numbers never before seen.
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:33.360]  And they're still going to indict him more.
[03:10:33.360 --> 03:10:34.360]  They're crazy.
[03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:39.360]  Well, that is really lunacy because we have seen throughout Trump's career,
[03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:45.360]  every attack on Trump has always empowered his base, lifted his popularity.
[03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:49.360]  I mean, we've actually seen the fact that people who come out of the woodwork
[03:10:49.360 --> 03:10:51.360]  say, hey, I'm libertarian.
[03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:52.360]  I'm a Democrat.
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:54.360]  I don't like what's being done with Trump.
[03:10:54.360 --> 03:10:58.360]  I'm going to support Trump because I don't want a government that could maybe do
[03:10:58.360 --> 03:11:00.360]  that same thing to me.
[03:11:00.360 --> 03:11:02.360]  And that's really where we're at.
[03:11:02.360 --> 03:11:08.360]  I mean, as a constitutional attorney who's been steeped in this for over a decade
[03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:15.360]  now, I can tell you very clearly that what the FBI is doing to Donald Trump,
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:22.360]  they've been doing to everyday Americans at least since 2001 in the Patriot Act,
[03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:23.360]  right?
[03:11:23.360 --> 03:11:28.360]  But now everybody's saying and seeing and feeling if they can do this to someone
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:34.360]  as high profile as Donald Trump, then what's to stop them from doing it to me?
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:36.360]  And it's really shining the light everywhere.
[03:11:36.360 --> 03:11:38.360]  By the way, Donald Trump is a boy scout.
[03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:41.360]  I know people that have known him well his whole life, other than the women thing,
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:43.360]  that he literally is by the book.
[03:11:43.360 --> 03:11:44.360]  Plus, he's not stupid.
[03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:45.360]  You're not going to get this.
[03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:48.360]  I mean, it's just crazy with all his enemies that they've done all the fake impeachments,
[03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:51.360]  all the fake garbage, and literally none of it's true.
[03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:56.360]  So shifting gears into the Russian thing, we've now had some time to look at Purgogin.
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:57.360]  What happened?
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:02.360]  I agree with the analysts like Tony Schaefer, Colonel Schaefer.
[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:07.360]  I mean, I agree with them that I don't think the U.S. government was backing Purgogin.
[03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:09.360]  He went crazy, tried to grab the power himself.
[03:12:09.360 --> 03:12:12.360]  Now, the left and Biden tried to jump on the bandwagon and say,
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:16.360]  we'll be for Purgogin now, which is even more ridiculous.
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:22.360]  But Pastor J.C. Hall, in your more recent incarnation, the last decade or so,
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:25.360]  an amazing pastor, amazing church, the word you do, GodGunsLiberty.com,
[03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:27.360]  GodGunsLiberty.com, got to love that URL.
[03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:33.360]  You've got an amazing background and bio at the U.S. Navy, the National Security Agency,
[03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:37.360]  teaching people how to literally in the Cold War fight the Russians and beyond.
[03:12:38.360 --> 03:12:44.360]  And your instructor at the prestigious Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California,
[03:12:44.360 --> 03:12:45.360]  on and on.
[03:12:45.360 --> 03:12:49.360]  I'm not going to go over your whole background, expert on the Marxist for three decades.
[03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:50.360]  You're a Russia expert.
[03:12:50.360 --> 03:12:52.360]  That's what you worked in these agencies.
[03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:54.360]  Give us your expert take.
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:55.360]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[03:12:55.360 --> 03:12:56.360]  I think you're right on target.
[03:12:56.360 --> 03:12:58.360]  I'm hearing you the other day.
[03:12:58.360 --> 03:13:02.360]  And I listen to so many talking like it sounds like they don't know what they're talking about.
[03:13:02.360 --> 03:13:05.360]  And then I heard you in the interview and you said, you know,
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:08.360]  the Russians are all together until the knives come out.
[03:13:08.360 --> 03:13:10.360]  And that's exactly right.
[03:13:10.360 --> 03:13:12.360]  I saw this whole episode is very typical Russian.
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:17.360]  When you look back in their history, Russians respect, you know, a strong leader in power.
[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:20.360]  There's really no populist sentiment in Russia.
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:24.360]  It's they got to have a strong leader, you know, who's just going after it.
[03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:30.360]  And so this is how power swap, you know, the next alpha predator rises up and takes it by force.
[03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:42.360]  So I think, you know, who's gone along and built himself billionaire restaurateur and all this big background connected with the casinos and the mafia and the oligarchs got close to Putin.
[03:13:42.360 --> 03:13:46.360]  And he, I think, became convinced of his own legend.
[03:13:46.360 --> 03:13:50.360]  And he's out there on the front with his mercenary group, you know, fighting.
[03:13:50.360 --> 03:13:55.360]  And he's kind of a hero in his own mind and just decided, you know, I'm going to I'm going to rise up.
[03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:58.360]  I'm going to go punish the military leadership of Russia.
[03:13:58.360 --> 03:14:04.360]  Now, he never he never came out and specifically targeted Putin in his work.
[03:14:04.360 --> 03:14:06.360]  He never said, I'm going to overthrow Putin.
[03:14:06.360 --> 03:14:12.360]  He talked particularly about the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff of the army in Russia.
[03:14:12.360 --> 03:14:15.360]  And he was basically coming, he said, to bring just.
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:18.360]  And they said that was part of the deal that the head of the military would have to be fired.
[03:14:18.360 --> 03:14:20.360]  He's suddenly not in his military uniform.
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:23.360]  He's suddenly in a suit.
[03:14:23.360 --> 03:14:27.360]  It's it's. Yeah. So it's kind of like, you know, sketchy.
[03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:35.360]  Like, what's what's going to happen? I thought it very odd and interesting to where Purgosians never said Putin's name.
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:37.360]  But then Putin never said Purgosians name.
[03:14:37.360 --> 03:14:43.360]  So even when Putin came out after the fact, and these are traitors that did this, he never mentioned Purgosians specifically.
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:46.360]  So it's a weird thing. They have this long connection.
[03:14:46.360 --> 03:14:52.360]  And even as Putin speaking about it, it's like he's trying he was trying to give Purgosians space to save face or whatever.
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:57.360]  But then at the same time, for a Russian leader, he can't show weakness.
[03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:02.360]  He's got to do something. I'm surprised they didn't attack that highway of death more.
[03:15:02.360 --> 03:15:07.360]  Yeah. And but I can see Putin's statement that he didn't want to have Russians killing Russia. Right.
[03:15:07.360 --> 03:15:10.360]  So this shows me just how dangerous the whole thing is out of control.
[03:15:10.360 --> 03:15:15.360]  You're a half in. Correct. Well, as a Russia expert, a guy that did this for decades inside the government,
[03:15:15.360 --> 03:15:22.360]  the top classes on the government, just other angles or the whole Ukraine war, where you see this going.
[03:15:22.360 --> 03:15:25.360]  You know, there are a lot of questions now. Right.
[03:15:25.360 --> 03:15:32.360]  You have to think about you saw Purgosian with twenty five thousand troops apparently marching on Moscow.
[03:15:32.360 --> 03:15:37.360]  So you think, OK, who are they supporting? They're behind him. He's rolling the rostov on the Don.
[03:15:37.360 --> 03:15:40.360]  Regular soldiers are embracing him. The people are embracing him.
[03:15:40.360 --> 03:15:45.360]  Putin comes out and, you know, he's spinning this thing of everybody was united and everybody stood together.
[03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:54.360]  But that that's not what happened. So you have to wonder, how does this affect the cohesion within the Russian military,
[03:15:54.360 --> 03:15:58.360]  even within the Russian Russian society, Russian political system?
[03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:01.360]  Wonder how much is it now fractured.
[03:16:01.360 --> 03:16:07.360]  And then as incompetent as as it seems, the military, regular army leadership has been.
[03:16:08.360 --> 03:16:14.360]  Now you have this split within the troops. How is this going to affect how this conflict is being prosecuted?
[03:16:14.360 --> 03:16:20.360]  You know, and then obviously you throw in the ingredients of all that the West is funding, throwing money at.
[03:16:20.360 --> 03:16:28.360]  You know, are they now trying to funnel money into Russian forces to take advantage of what they see as these fractures?
[03:16:28.360 --> 03:16:36.360]  So I think you really see, which is very typical of CIA and these Western forces of a tremendous disruption.
[03:16:36.360 --> 03:16:42.360]  Which is scary when you create these fractures, take advantage of the fractures,
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:49.360]  because you're talking about a major nuclear power with some insane hardliners sitting in the shadows around Putin,
[03:16:49.360 --> 03:16:56.360]  ready to take control, who all have said, including Purgosian, that they want to literally nuke the West, nuke Europe, nuke United States.
[03:16:56.360 --> 03:17:03.360]  So I think this thing has actually brought us to a more dangerous position, whereas Russia is concerned.
[03:17:03.360 --> 03:17:07.360]  If if Putin is now seen as weaker, so who are there?
[03:17:07.360 --> 03:17:10.360]  There are a lot of people, despite what the narrative of the West is.
[03:17:10.360 --> 03:17:19.360]  There are so many hardline Russians, former Soviets in there that are so much more crazy than they portray Vladimir Putin.
[03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:23.360]  Vladimir Putin is a moderate compared to somebody like Purgosian and the rest of these hardliners.
[03:17:23.360 --> 03:17:25.360]  So that's what I was saying. Got more danger.
[03:17:25.360 --> 03:17:27.360]  That's what I was saying Saturday and Sunday that you said you agree with.
[03:17:27.360 --> 03:17:31.360]  And now I even see mainline analysts going, well, we probably that's got to be.
[03:17:31.360 --> 03:17:39.360]  I mean, the establishment's just out of their minds if they think that because that's what I've heard from the churches that you guys are in contact with.
[03:17:39.360 --> 03:17:41.360]  And also the numbers I've seen, I've talked to some Russian Americans.
[03:17:41.360 --> 03:17:46.360]  They know they say the Russians are mad at Ukraine and want more war and want war with it.
[03:17:46.360 --> 03:17:50.360]  And are like like 80, 90 percent of Russians are ready to go.
[03:17:50.360 --> 03:17:52.360]  Listen, people don't get it.
[03:17:52.360 --> 03:17:57.360]  This is all Russia and Ukraine has known for fifteen hundred years.
[03:17:57.360 --> 03:17:58.360]  I mean, go study the history.
[03:17:58.360 --> 03:18:00.360]  There's never been a time they didn't hate each other.
[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:01.360]  They didn't hate each other.
[03:18:01.360 --> 03:18:03.360]  We're at some wars, whatever.
[03:18:03.360 --> 03:18:05.360]  So this is cultural now.
[03:18:05.360 --> 03:18:10.360]  It's almost an ingrained cultural bloods.
[03:18:10.360 --> 03:18:11.360]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:18:11.360 --> 03:18:17.360]  So I don't I don't know how you dial this back, especially with NATO in the West.
[03:18:17.360 --> 03:18:20.360]  They're provoking and stirring things up.
[03:18:20.360 --> 03:18:23.360]  Very dangerous. I don't I don't know.
[03:18:23.360 --> 03:18:30.360]  Outside of total annihilation and just insane bloodshed that they could bring us to the edge of World War three,
[03:18:30.360 --> 03:18:33.360]  which I suspect is probably what some of them want.
[03:18:33.360 --> 03:18:35.360]  I don't know how you pull this back.
[03:18:35.360 --> 03:18:37.360]  Oh, we've got to get out yet.
[03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:39.360]  You have a month ago said we'll just have a nuclear war.
[03:18:39.360 --> 03:18:41.360]  This is good. Yeah.
[03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:42.360]  Russians aren't the same.
[03:18:42.360 --> 03:18:44.360]  The Russian political psyche.
[03:18:44.360 --> 03:18:46.360]  It's not the same as Western politics.
[03:18:46.360 --> 03:18:48.360]  And I don't think most people comprehend that.
[03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:55.360]  We try to put this Western perspective and lay that over on Russian politics and Russian thinking and Russian culture.
[03:18:55.360 --> 03:18:57.360]  And it just doesn't work.
[03:18:57.360 --> 03:19:02.360]  Why do you think Biden came out finally yesterday and said we were not involved and we're not involved?
[03:19:02.360 --> 03:19:07.360]  You know, it's weird because every time Biden says something, I think probably the opposite is true.
[03:19:07.360 --> 03:19:11.360]  So maybe the reason he said we're not involved is because they were involved.
[03:19:11.360 --> 03:19:16.360]  Why do you think the globalists overthrew Ukraine nine years ago and have been obviously starting this?
[03:19:16.360 --> 03:19:19.360]  I mean, why did they think in the end this would be good for anybody?
[03:19:19.360 --> 03:19:21.360]  Because I don't think the globalists I mean, we have a real nuclear war.
[03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:28.360]  Obviously, it's going to lead to all the way to 43 on the Rand Corporation threat chart of total nuclear war.
[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:31.360]  Nuclear winner. Five billion dead.
[03:19:31.360 --> 03:19:37.360]  Well, one thing I can say for sure, you look back at Soviet history and Cold War war history.
[03:19:37.360 --> 03:19:42.360]  When the collapse of the Berlin Wall happened, collapse of the Soviet Union happened.
[03:19:42.360 --> 03:19:44.360]  This is a great opportunity.
[03:19:44.360 --> 03:19:47.360]  Right. That was supposed to be the end goal of the Cold War.
[03:19:47.360 --> 03:19:52.360]  So it's a great opportunity for the West to say, OK, let's bring Russia into the first world.
[03:19:52.360 --> 03:19:56.360]  Let's bring Russia into the fold. Let's have an ally. Let's have a peaceful world.
[03:19:56.360 --> 03:20:03.360]  But the fact of the matter is the war machine of the West didn't see it that way.
[03:20:03.360 --> 03:20:09.360]  They they wanted total domination. We got to go in and take out Moscow, take out Russia.
[03:20:09.360 --> 03:20:16.360]  That's the last piece. And so there was never really a backing off of for the Western powers in the Cold War.
[03:20:16.360 --> 03:20:19.360]  It wasn't as crazy. It never ended for them. And it's crazy how history repeats.
[03:20:19.360 --> 03:20:23.360]  Napoleon goes, he's got to run everything. Hitler goes there. He's going to run everything.
[03:20:23.360 --> 03:20:27.360]  And now the globalists are doing it again. Exactly. See, that's not smart.
[03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:33.360]  They never let off. And you think about and they hate to hear that, you know, NATO making the promise.
[03:20:33.360 --> 03:20:38.360]  We won't go any any further. And then you look at all of a sudden these reports.
[03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:41.360]  Oh, my goodness. Putin's stationing troops on the border.
[03:20:41.360 --> 03:20:45.360]  Like, look, you've rolled all the way up to his borders.
[03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:48.360]  Ukraine's like the last piece of land that NATO doesn't occupy.
[03:20:48.360 --> 03:20:53.360]  What did you think was going to be his reaction? That'd be like North Korea is in Canada, is in Mexico.
[03:20:53.360 --> 03:20:56.360]  Don't you think we would deploy troops to the border? Of course.
[03:20:56.360 --> 03:21:04.360]  Well, the United States will attack. So we so we provoked Putin and we've provoked this very thing that we're seeing happen over there.
[03:21:04.360 --> 03:21:09.360]  The West provoke this and they're still provoking it. They're still stoking the fire.
[03:21:09.360 --> 03:21:14.360]  They don't care about all the Ukrainian lives being lost, the Russian lives being lost.
[03:21:14.360 --> 03:21:19.360]  And isn't it crazy how they've turned leftists to the one of the few good things they were good for is they were against wars.
[03:21:19.360 --> 03:21:22.360]  And now they love it. Right. They love it.
[03:21:22.360 --> 03:21:27.360]  Like like like in Egypt, a Russian tourist got eaten by a shark right off the shore.
[03:21:27.360 --> 03:21:31.360]  And they're all celebrating a Russian got eaten. They don't even know. I mean, it's just crazy.
[03:21:31.360 --> 03:21:39.360]  I think it shows that one, the power and the danger of this ideological brainwashing time that we've entered into.
[03:21:39.360 --> 03:21:47.360]  It's no longer about look at the facts, analyze what's going on, think it's whatever, whatever the tribe says, whatever the tribe points you to.
[03:21:47.360 --> 03:21:52.360]  We're going to do that. Damn the consequences. And so you have this blind tribal cult.
[03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:56.360]  It's a cult. So where it used to be, we're against war in principle.
[03:21:56.360 --> 03:21:59.360]  Now, you know, as long as it's somebody that our tribe wants to kill.
[03:21:59.360 --> 03:22:03.360]  We're for that. Sean Penn has said we should have a nuclear war. It's survivable.
[03:22:03.360 --> 03:22:08.360]  He knows nothing. Amazing. Pastor J.C. Hall, God, guns, liberty dot com.
[03:22:08.360 --> 03:22:12.360]  Can't forget that. Let's bring your amazing constitutional lawyer wife into this.
[03:22:12.360 --> 03:22:15.360]  What's your view about all this? You also were you actually that's how you met him.
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:19.360]  We're trained the military on this as well. So, you know, a little bit about this as well.
[03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:28.360]  I'm just a little bit more curious about the money that went to fund this whole protest. Right.
[03:22:28.360 --> 03:22:36.360]  You've got a protest against the Russian military leadership, which is actually a coup.
[03:22:36.360 --> 03:22:41.360]  Right. It's actually a rising up with military forces.
[03:22:41.360 --> 03:22:46.360]  And now we know 10 billion of our dollars went to this. It's a real insurrection.
[03:22:46.360 --> 03:22:52.360]  It is. Yeah. Right. It's a real insurrection, as opposed to January 6th, which was a real protest.
[03:22:52.360 --> 03:22:57.360]  Now we have a real insurrection that's being called a protest just because it's not here.
[03:22:57.360 --> 03:23:02.360]  And it's not our missile shooting down planes, tank wars.
[03:23:02.360 --> 03:23:07.360]  That's a protest. But then somebody stealing Nancy Pelosi's beer is the end of the world.
[03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:19.360]  Right. Exactly. Not only that, we have to persecute and prosecute people that were invited into the Capitol building in Washington, D.C.
[03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:28.360]  Yet we fund our money, funds, the actual bombing and the actual rockets.
[03:23:28.360 --> 03:23:33.360]  And let's not glaze over that. They sent three billion dollars extra a month ago and six million they forgot about.
[03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:37.360]  And they're now saying it looks like it was somehow involved in this.
[03:23:37.360 --> 03:23:42.360]  Oh, my goodness. Well, if that's true, Pergoja is not going to be alive very long in Belarus.
[03:23:42.360 --> 03:23:46.360]  Yeah, that's it. That's the sort of next thing, because you look at.
[03:23:46.360 --> 03:23:52.360]  You know, anybody sort of cross Putin, he ends up taking him out within months or a few years.
[03:23:52.360 --> 03:23:58.360]  And then, you know, like I said, he is a Russian leader and how the public in Russia is going to look at this.
[03:23:58.360 --> 03:24:00.360]  You're weak if you don't do something about it.
[03:24:00.360 --> 03:24:04.360]  So if Pergoja is dead in a couple of weeks, then somebody might make another trial on Putin.
[03:24:04.360 --> 03:24:11.360]  Yeah. He either has to fire Putin, either has to fire the two military leaders that Pergoja, you know, was was mad about.
[03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:14.360]  That makes him look weak. He's taking orders from Pergoja.
[03:24:14.360 --> 03:24:18.360]  So he fires him and kills Pergoja. Or he keeps them and kills Pergoja.
[03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:21.360]  Or he fires both of them and kills Pergoja. Like, look, I'm the top dog.
[03:24:21.360 --> 03:24:25.360]  I'm killing everybody. And then the Russians are going to go, yeah, we have our strong leader back.
[03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:29.360]  Yeah. So he'll so then he'll probably fire the generals and then kill Pergoja.
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:31.360]  That would be the very Russian leader thing to do.
[03:24:31.360 --> 03:24:34.360]  And maybe Putin's trying to change things. I'm not saying he's a good guy.
[03:24:34.360 --> 03:24:37.360]  It's quite possible. That's we were debating about that.
[03:24:37.360 --> 03:24:42.360]  Like driving up here, like what's going on? Maybe Putin's change as Russian society change.
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:49.360]  But but it's very odd for him to be really silent about Pergoja and never say his name.
[03:24:49.360 --> 03:24:56.360]  I know they were close buds, you know, but it's odd for him to to be inactive.
[03:24:56.360 --> 03:24:59.360]  He's not firing these two guys. He's not taking out Pergoja.
[03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:03.360]  He just forgive everybody. It's not going to be criminally prosecuted.
[03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:06.360]  So it's a it's a really strange scenario.
[03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:12.360]  It makes me want to think if if he's going to operate in typical Russian facts back, you know, way,
[03:25:12.360 --> 03:25:17.360]  then something's he's planning something behind the scenes. Somebody is going to get taken out.
[03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:19.360]  All right. Well, what about you talk about twelve hundred, fifteen hundred years?
[03:25:19.360 --> 03:25:23.360]  I'm not a huge Russian expert, but I've read five or six books about a few hundred articles.
[03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:27.360]  It's very interesting. Slav the Great is what it translated into that founded Russia.
[03:25:27.360 --> 03:25:33.360]  What a thousand years ago in Ukraine. And and they've they've stopped and been overrun by the Mongols
[03:25:33.360 --> 03:25:38.360]  and by the Muslims and by the Huns. And then they're attacked by everybody.
[03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:42.360]  So anybody that didn't fight or didn't organize behind each other has been killed.
[03:25:42.360 --> 03:25:46.360]  You know, twenty seven million or whatever it was, Russians died in World War Two.
[03:25:46.360 --> 03:25:51.360]  So you talk about it. I mean, it is true that Russia is that is the battleground between East and West constantly.
[03:25:51.360 --> 03:25:56.360]  And then it's now they've got the biggest nuclear weapons force in the world with submarines off our coast.
[03:25:56.360 --> 03:26:02.360]  This is insane. But looking at Russian history, is Russia cursed like all thousand years being attacked constantly?
[03:26:02.360 --> 03:26:05.360]  Or is it just geographically where they are? This is a great question.
[03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:10.360]  There's actually a great book called Prisoners of Geography that I highly recommend in the section on Russia there.
[03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:15.360]  And talked about that. Very insightful. If you look at how Russia responded to the Ukraine,
[03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:19.360]  you know, had to do what they hadn't. They have no warm water port open to the sea.
[03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:22.360]  And so, you know, you've cut off Sevastopol in the Black Sea over there.
[03:26:23.360 --> 03:26:27.360]  They're seriously exposed. And then that area of Ukraine, you know, you have this.
[03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:29.360]  So NATO knowingly put them in a position where they had.
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:39.360]  They know that like they Russia historically knows how it's physically exposed unless it has that space of Ukraine all the way to the map,
[03:26:39.360 --> 03:26:44.360]  that mountain range that that creates the bottleneck. Otherwise, it's open plain all the way to Moscow.
[03:26:44.360 --> 03:26:47.360]  So you start, you know, the West starts working in Ukraine.
[03:26:47.360 --> 03:26:51.360]  You have this idiot clown who they elect president starts saying, oh, you know, we're we're going to join.
[03:26:51.360 --> 03:26:54.360]  When he's not when he's not playing the piano with his penis.
[03:26:54.360 --> 03:27:05.360]  So he it's like the guy's such a moron that he's signaling to Russia that now you're only geographical projection or protection.
[03:27:05.360 --> 03:27:08.360]  We've now joined the other side. And as you say, the West knows this.
[03:27:08.360 --> 03:27:13.360]  And NATO knows this. This this basically exposed belly of Russia.
[03:27:13.360 --> 03:27:17.360]  And it has them feeling like, you know, we're vulnerable.
[03:27:17.360 --> 03:27:21.360]  So Putin had to do something. Putin, this thing with Ukraine.
[03:27:21.360 --> 03:27:26.360]  There's no way that it could not have happened with what NATO in the West was doing.
[03:27:26.360 --> 03:27:29.360]  And then George Soros goes five years ago and reads our car and brags him.
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:33.360]  The State Department did all this and he called himself the czar of Russia.
[03:27:33.360 --> 03:27:37.360]  So how is it going for the globalist? Is it going well? Is it going bad?
[03:27:37.360 --> 03:27:39.360]  Why do they want World War Three? How do you think this ends?
[03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:42.360]  I don't think it's going well for them.
[03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:47.360]  I feel like they see where they're failing so much.
[03:27:47.360 --> 03:27:55.360]  But that very sense of their their failure, I think, is what has made them dangerous and desperate.
[03:27:55.360 --> 03:27:58.360]  Russia and the globalist, the whole thing, the globalist, the whole plan.
[03:27:58.360 --> 03:28:02.360]  You know, when you when you feel like you're failing, when you feel like the walls are closing on both sides.
[03:28:02.360 --> 03:28:05.360]  Yes. Then it makes it more dangerous.
[03:28:05.360 --> 03:28:08.360]  And again, I know analysts like you from the NSA and the military.
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:11.360]  But I said this before it even started. I mean, you can look at this mess.
[03:28:11.360 --> 03:28:13.360]  That's how it always ends over there.
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:18.360]  Exactly. That's all they know. I'm telling you, all they know, it's all that it's ever been.
[03:28:18.360 --> 03:28:23.360]  And they're about that protection. You can't make Putin or these guys feel vulnerable.
[03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:24.360]  They're going to react.
[03:28:24.360 --> 03:28:29.360]  If in your grandparents day, a third of the people died, you would be like completely, you know.
[03:28:29.360 --> 03:28:33.360]  And Putin talks about the Russian experience of that. And don't you know, we're not going to stop.
[03:28:33.360 --> 03:28:36.360]  And that's how the Russian thing goes. They always get beat at first and they win in the end.
[03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:38.360]  Correct. They're not just going to roll over.
[03:28:38.360 --> 03:28:41.360]  And this time it's nuclear weapons. Do you think the globalists can be stopped?
[03:28:41.360 --> 03:28:43.360]  Is there any tactics you guys got the ideas on?
[03:28:43.360 --> 03:28:45.360]  We've got to go to break. We're going to come back and talk about ways.
[03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:47.360]  And then we're going to talk about liberty in America.
[03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:49.360]  Now we get our country back from the pedo world.
[03:28:49.360 --> 03:28:51.360]  And they notice Russia's staying there against that as well.
[03:28:51.360 --> 03:28:54.360]  So it's quite a time to be alive. Stay with us at Infowars.com.

[03:30:54.360 --> 03:30:58.360]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:30:58.360 --> 03:31:00.360]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:31:00.360 --> 03:31:04.360]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:31:04.360 --> 03:31:09.360]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:31:09.360 --> 03:31:13.360]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:17.360]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:31:17.360 --> 03:31:21.360]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:31:21.360 --> 03:31:24.360]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:31:24.360 --> 03:31:30.360]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:31:30.360 --> 03:31:33.360]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:31:33.360 --> 03:31:38.360]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great products
[03:31:38.360 --> 03:31:42.360]  that enrich and empower your life all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:31:42.360 --> 03:31:46.360]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:47.360 --> 03:31:50.360]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[03:31:50.360 --> 03:31:52.360]  our funding problems will be over.
[03:31:52.360 --> 03:31:53.360]  Please take action now.
[03:31:53.360 --> 03:31:57.360]  A lot of people have asked me, why has Infowars store and Infowars Life
[03:31:57.360 --> 03:31:59.360]  not had a probiotic for more than three years?

[03:33:50.420 --> 03:33:51.420]  the fourth hour.
[03:33:51.420 --> 03:33:56.660]  Today, don't forget, Owen Schroyer, political prisoner, not in jail yet, but they're trying

[03:33:57.660 --> 03:34:04.060]  He'll be hosting the War Room coming up in about 30 minutes, about 27 minutes at Infowars.com
[03:34:04.060 --> 03:34:05.060]  forward slash show.
[03:34:05.060 --> 03:34:10.620]  Now, I got so focused last hour and so focused that I didn't even plug, and if we don't plug,
[03:34:10.620 --> 03:34:12.100]  we don't sell product, we don't stay on air.

[03:35:05.420 --> 03:35:08.660]  That's why I love it, because I got to stay up until, say, two in the morning, 10 o'clock
[03:35:08.660 --> 03:35:09.660]  at night.
[03:35:09.660 --> 03:35:13.460]  Boom, I can take this and then go right to bed, whereas if I took Turbo Force, it's 25%

[03:35:39.140 --> 03:35:40.140]  I want to thank all of you that have gotten the products in the past, but you really need
[03:35:40.140 --> 03:35:41.140]  these.

[03:36:06.020 --> 03:36:08.540]  It doesn't have a 100% markup in it.
[03:36:08.540 --> 03:36:09.540]  Okay?
[03:36:09.540 --> 03:36:15.820]  So, it's amazing when we offer 10% off, no excuses, in stock, ready to ship, Alexa Pure,

[03:36:32.580 --> 03:36:33.580]  Thank you for your support.
[03:36:33.580 --> 03:36:38.540]  All right, going back to Pastor J.C. Hall of GodGunsLiberty.com and his constitutional
[03:36:38.540 --> 03:36:42.260]  wife, lawyer, also a veteran, Chris Ann Hall, ChrisAnnHall.com.
[03:36:42.260 --> 03:36:46.380]  We've got some important domestic things to talk about and really how America is the best
[03:36:46.380 --> 03:36:49.700]  house in the bad neighborhood and we can kill the whole globalist agenda if we can save
[03:36:49.700 --> 03:36:50.700]  this country.
[03:36:50.700 --> 03:36:51.700]  They know that.
[03:36:51.700 --> 03:36:52.700]  We know that.
[03:36:52.700 --> 03:36:56.460]  But finishing up on Russia, on your predictions of what you think is going to happen.
[03:36:56.460 --> 03:37:05.340]  I look for the West to continue to try to provoke and stoke what's going on there unless
[03:37:05.340 --> 03:37:08.820]  we can get the zombie out of the White House.
[03:37:08.820 --> 03:37:18.180]  I really think that's probably the only hope on that level is we have to take on this administration
[03:37:18.180 --> 03:37:20.340]  and take them down.
[03:37:20.340 --> 03:37:23.040]  That's how we stopped World War III.
[03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:28.740]  That's how we stopped the chaos that is to come, which is primarily due to the meddling
[03:37:28.740 --> 03:37:32.500]  of Biden's globalist overlords and their agenda.
[03:37:32.500 --> 03:37:34.540]  So this election really is do or die?
[03:37:34.740 --> 03:37:39.500]  I believe worldwide, not just for America, for the entire globe.
[03:37:39.500 --> 03:37:42.860]  We've said that kind of stuff about previous elections.
[03:37:42.860 --> 03:37:46.420]  And I think people were speaking about America first and foremost.
[03:37:46.420 --> 03:37:52.660]  But we're talking about do or die for all of humanity, our entire planet.
[03:37:52.660 --> 03:37:59.100]  This particular administration is just like, you know, 2.0 of all the previous bad administrations
[03:37:59.100 --> 03:38:04.420]  have taken it to a global level, not just trying to destroy America, but they're going
[03:38:04.420 --> 03:38:09.860]  to absolutely destroy humanity if we do not get that out of them.
[03:38:09.860 --> 03:38:13.220]  And I don't just intellectually see it or politically see it.
[03:38:13.220 --> 03:38:14.660]  I gut level feel it.
[03:38:14.660 --> 03:38:16.220]  I mean, I don't call it fear.
[03:38:16.220 --> 03:38:19.700]  It's more of a sadness, a betrayal, a sickness.
[03:38:19.700 --> 03:38:21.100]  Like people, you better take this serious.
[03:38:21.100 --> 03:38:22.900]  Like we're not just up here saying it.
[03:38:22.900 --> 03:38:24.620]  And we know this is all we do is research this.
[03:38:24.620 --> 03:38:25.620]  We're not playing games.
[03:38:25.620 --> 03:38:26.780]  Want to comment on this?
[03:38:26.780 --> 03:38:27.940]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[03:38:27.940 --> 03:38:33.340]  And I think that one thing that we have to really work on domestically, right, because
[03:38:33.340 --> 03:38:36.860]  my husband's the foreign policy, foreign relations guy.
[03:38:36.860 --> 03:38:39.180]  I'm the one that knows the Constitution.
[03:38:39.180 --> 03:38:41.980]  I know what we can do domestically.
[03:38:41.980 --> 03:38:48.820]  What we as a people, Alex, really need to understand is, number one, constitutionally
[03:38:48.820 --> 03:38:56.020]  speaking, the president of the United States and the executive department do not hold this
[03:38:56.060 --> 03:39:00.180]  authority to do what they're doing overseas.
[03:39:00.180 --> 03:39:08.100]  There's absolutely no constitutional authority for Biden to be sending money overseas without
[03:39:08.100 --> 03:39:09.700]  congressional approval.
[03:39:09.700 --> 03:39:15.300]  And I'm going to tell you, and I fully understand this as as I'm not just simply a constitutional
[03:39:15.300 --> 03:39:20.500]  scholar now, but I'm also an historian.
[03:39:20.500 --> 03:39:22.540]  So I've studied thousands of years of history.
[03:39:22.540 --> 03:39:24.540]  I know how government operates.
[03:39:24.580 --> 03:39:26.260]  I know how people operate.
[03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:31.380]  And I also know that those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat its mistake.
[03:39:31.380 --> 03:39:33.220]  And I watched that happen.
[03:39:33.220 --> 03:39:41.260]  So I believe that if the American people are not educated and informed on the limit of
[03:39:41.260 --> 03:39:47.420]  federal authority, constitutionally speaking, this Biden administration is going to, as
[03:39:47.420 --> 03:39:50.540]  J.C. said earlier, is feeling the desperation.
[03:39:50.540 --> 03:39:52.540]  We're coming up on a new election.
[03:39:52.540 --> 03:39:59.980]  The populace is not in favor of what's happening, regardless of what the media is pushing.
[03:39:59.980 --> 03:40:09.100]  This administration is going to push us into something globally violent before the election
[03:40:09.100 --> 03:40:16.300]  so that they can gather up all the patriotism, oh, well, you have to back the president because
[03:40:16.300 --> 03:40:18.300]  everybody backs a president when we're at war.
[03:40:18.300 --> 03:40:20.940]  You're saying October Surprise is an accelerated war.
[03:40:20.940 --> 03:40:21.940]  Absolutely.
[03:40:22.340 --> 03:40:24.340]  But we can stop it.
[03:40:24.340 --> 03:40:33.540]  We can stop it if the American people understand that Congress can stop the funding now.
[03:40:33.540 --> 03:40:43.700]  Congress is actually the power that is in control of forces when there is no declaration
[03:40:43.700 --> 03:40:44.700]  of war.
[03:40:44.700 --> 03:40:49.860]  We have this whole misconception in America that the commander in chief is the president.
[03:40:49.860 --> 03:40:50.860]  That's right.
[03:40:50.860 --> 03:40:52.300]  And that power is being totally ignored.
[03:40:52.300 --> 03:40:53.740]  What you're saying is so central.
[03:40:53.740 --> 03:40:56.540]  I've seen polls of 80 plus percent of Americans against this war.
[03:40:56.540 --> 03:40:58.100]  We're being gaslit that we want this.
[03:40:58.100 --> 03:40:59.100]  And it's unconstitutional.
[03:40:59.100 --> 03:41:00.100]  You're absolutely right.
[03:41:00.100 --> 03:41:02.700]  As a constitutional lawyer, we need to push harder to make Congress withhold the purse
[03:41:02.700 --> 03:41:03.700]  strings.
[03:41:03.700 --> 03:41:04.700]  Exactly.
[03:41:04.700 --> 03:41:12.500]  And at the state and local level, at the state and local levels, our governors, our sheriffs,
[03:41:12.500 --> 03:41:21.380]  our state legislators can take back power from the federal government and start exercising
[03:41:21.380 --> 03:41:23.700]  defense domestically.
[03:41:23.700 --> 03:41:29.700]  Our state governors, our state sheriffs have the authority, Alec, to lock down our borders
[03:41:29.700 --> 03:41:30.700]  now.
[03:41:30.700 --> 03:41:33.340]  And for folks that don't know, I saw this when it came out.
[03:41:33.340 --> 03:41:39.580]  This is an amazing film, christianhall.com, the sheriff, noncompliant to the sheriff.
[03:41:39.580 --> 03:41:41.300]  He put up several of these.
[03:41:41.300 --> 03:41:42.300]  Everybody should get this.
[03:41:43.100 --> 03:41:44.100]  Everybody should share it.
[03:41:44.100 --> 03:41:47.820]  Everybody should, you know, air it locally, show it to your church group and get it to
[03:41:47.820 --> 03:41:48.820]  your sheriff.
[03:41:48.820 --> 03:41:49.820]  Absolutely.
[03:41:49.820 --> 03:41:54.260]  What we have to understand is that we are not powerless.
[03:41:54.260 --> 03:42:03.300]  You see, 150 years of government led education has trained the people to believe that their
[03:42:03.300 --> 03:42:06.860]  only course of controlling government is elections.
[03:42:06.860 --> 03:42:08.220]  That's a lie.
[03:42:08.220 --> 03:42:15.140]  Our federal system as a system of federalism, not a federal government, a system of federalism
[03:42:15.140 --> 03:42:22.820]  actually places the state and local government in a higher authority than the federal government.
[03:42:22.820 --> 03:42:23.820]  Absolutely.
[03:42:23.820 --> 03:42:24.820]  It's another one of the checks and balances.
[03:42:24.820 --> 03:42:26.820]  We have juries, grand juries.
[03:42:26.820 --> 03:42:31.260]  We have the sheriffs and we have the legislatures and incredible.
[03:42:31.260 --> 03:42:32.260]  Stay right there.
[03:42:33.060 --> 03:42:38.500]  Segment with Chris and hall christianhall.com to find the sheriff documentary more her amazing
[03:42:38.500 --> 03:42:39.500]  husband.

[03:42:40.500 --> 03:42:41.500]  Pastor J.C.
[03:42:41.500 --> 03:42:42.500]  Hall.
[03:42:42.500 --> 03:42:43.500]  God, guns, liberty.

[03:42:44.500 --> 03:42:45.500]  Wow.
[03:42:45.500 --> 03:42:46.500]  Love that URL as well.
[03:42:46.500 --> 03:42:49.900]  We'll be right back with the final segment of this four hour powerhouse transmission
[03:42:49.900 --> 03:42:59.180]  that Owen Troyer takes over in full wars.com forward slash show two of our best selling
[03:42:59.180 --> 03:43:04.780]  new tropics or brain boosters are now back in stock at info or store.com for a limited
[03:43:04.780 --> 03:43:05.780]  time.
[03:43:05.780 --> 03:43:09.500]  They're 50% off when you get them together or 40% off when you get them individually.
[03:43:09.500 --> 03:43:13.740]  Brain force plus and brain force ultra two separate formulas.
[03:43:13.740 --> 03:43:16.740]  They both give you good clean energy without the crash.
[03:43:16.740 --> 03:43:22.340]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy again with no hangover or letdown and
[03:43:22.340 --> 03:43:25.380]  the other is a very special proprietary formula.
[03:43:25.380 --> 03:43:28.300]  That's brain force ultra that hits really, really quick and I love it.
[03:43:28.300 --> 03:43:31.220]  It wears off in two to three hours, so I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay
[03:43:31.220 --> 03:43:32.220]  up all night.
[03:43:32.220 --> 03:43:35.260]  I can take it and say nine o'clock at night and I stay up till midnight working, doing
[03:43:35.260 --> 03:43:39.860]  a radio interview or something and boom or writing an article or writing a book and then
[03:43:39.860 --> 03:43:43.540]  I get two, three hours of energy and then you go right to bed after it.
[03:43:43.540 --> 03:43:48.460]  Brain force ultra brain force plus both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[03:43:48.460 --> 03:43:49.780]  A lot of people love these products.

[03:43:52.980 --> 03:43:55.460]  50% off info or store.com.
[03:44:01.180 --> 03:44:02.660]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:44:02.660 --> 03:44:04.660]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:44:04.660 --> 03:44:10.140]  It is, but if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:44:10.140 --> 03:44:13.340]  The fish oil is better than that and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:44:13.340 --> 03:44:19.020]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:44:19.020 --> 03:44:22.820]  Krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm just sorry you want
[03:44:22.820 --> 03:44:23.820]  something like this.
[03:44:23.820 --> 03:44:24.820]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:44:24.820 --> 03:44:25.820]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:44:25.820 --> 03:44:26.820]  It's so good.
[03:44:26.820 --> 03:44:27.820]  In my view.
[03:44:27.820 --> 03:44:30.500]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something and I eat five
[03:44:30.500 --> 03:44:32.620]  capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:32.620 --> 03:44:36.100]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:44:36.100 --> 03:44:43.620]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:43.620 --> 03:44:47.060]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[03:44:47.060 --> 03:44:49.420]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:49.420 --> 03:44:55.900]  I just can't do it.

[03:48:12.720 --> 03:48:16.800]  live in leftist areas, not any good churches, well, make this church their church. They've
[03:48:16.800 --> 03:48:20.560]  also got a lot of other affiliated churches around the country who are doing a great job
[03:48:20.560 --> 03:48:24.880]  winning souls and really taking care of people. So, be sure to check it out at the website
[03:48:24.880 --> 03:48:28.800]  revival.com. I want to thank them. In the 10 minutes we've got left, you guys are really
[03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:34.880]  smart constitutional lawyer, you know, former NSA, a military Russia expert. What else do you
[03:48:34.880 --> 03:48:39.679]  want to impart to the listeners out there about the world right now? I would say something
[03:48:39.679 --> 03:48:44.640]  encouraging. You know, we've been traveling, doing, teaching the constitution, the history,
[03:48:44.640 --> 03:48:52.720]  and this stuff for over a decade now. And one thing a few years ago, once the Snowden revelations
[03:48:53.599 --> 03:49:01.359]  came out, we saw this reaction and this rise of young people in America. So, a lot of the,
[03:49:01.359 --> 03:49:06.960]  you know, so-called millennials and Gen Z and whatever, they all get lumped in with David Hogg
[03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:12.800]  and just, you know, a bunch of crazy lefty young people. But we've seen all over the country,
[03:49:12.800 --> 03:49:19.279]  Chris Ann taught something like 260 meetings in 22 states every year for at least six years.
[03:49:19.599 --> 03:49:25.599]  We've traveled everywhere and we see this rise in what we call the liberty generation. So,
[03:49:26.320 --> 03:49:32.240]  this young generation is not monolithic. And there's so many young people that are sick of
[03:49:32.240 --> 03:49:39.920]  this liberal nonsense, this pedophilia, this pervert society that's out there going nuts.
[03:49:39.920 --> 03:49:47.519]  And so, we've been very encouraged, particularly the last five or six years, over the rise and
[03:49:47.519 --> 03:49:52.640]  the engagement of our youth, of our young people, 20-somethings and below, the teenagers. We have
[03:49:52.640 --> 03:50:02.240]  a son, 17. I mean, he loves you, Jordan Peterson, you know, Joe Rogan. I mean, he's totally not
[03:50:02.240 --> 03:50:07.759]  into this stuff. And all his friends are. Rediscovering freedom and God is the new
[03:50:07.759 --> 03:50:11.840]  avant-garde. It's the new counterculture. Absolutely. Absolutely. So, that's encouraging
[03:50:11.840 --> 03:50:16.480]  us. I don't know if people see that everywhere, where they are, but we see this all over.
[03:50:16.480 --> 03:50:20.000]  You're out in the field. So, people alone think we're losing. We're actually winning.
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:20.400]  Correct.
[03:50:20.400 --> 03:50:23.119]  See, the enemy wants to overwhelm us, make us be demoralized and give up.
[03:50:23.679 --> 03:50:25.039]  But instead, they're losing.
[03:50:25.039 --> 03:50:25.519]  Absolutely.
[03:50:25.519 --> 03:50:32.000]  Well, here's Jefferson wrote, people are willing to suffer evil as long as evil is
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:35.920]  sufferable. That's in the Declaration of Independence. But after a long train of
[03:50:35.920 --> 03:50:41.679]  abuses and usurpations, then the people will rise up. See, that's how the enemy loses.
[03:50:41.679 --> 03:50:48.080]  The enemy loses with oppression, right? The enemy loses with censorship. The enemy
[03:50:48.080 --> 03:50:54.560]  loses with persecution because the more persecution that comes against the church
[03:50:55.119 --> 03:51:02.080]  strengthens the body of Christ. It ignites the Holy Spirit within us to stand up.
[03:51:02.080 --> 03:51:10.720]  And the most powerful, formidable force against oppressive government has always been
[03:51:11.359 --> 03:51:20.000]  the educated, organized, united, Holy Ghost filled body of Christ. You also add to that,
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:28.880]  that all of the extremist ideology that's being taught in our schools, the alienation of our
[03:51:28.880 --> 03:51:33.599]  children who think differently from the mainstream status quo.
[03:51:33.599 --> 03:51:35.039]  Well, the bullying of our children.
[03:51:35.039 --> 03:51:39.840]  Yes. It's actually driving people to the truth.
[03:51:39.840 --> 03:51:43.279]  Well, we've seen the videos everywhere, even in the UK and Europe. They show them this horrible
[03:51:44.000 --> 03:51:48.640]  pedo stuff and the kids go, no, no, we ain't. And they're like, you're in trouble.
[03:51:48.640 --> 03:51:49.920]  You're going to look at this.
[03:51:49.920 --> 03:51:56.320]  Right. I mean, and think about children have that natural rebellion in them. So that becomes
[03:51:56.320 --> 03:52:01.679]  the thing that they're being forced to do and forced to gobble up in that sort of bullying
[03:52:01.679 --> 03:52:07.279]  manner. They're going to rebel against that. So I think I told you earlier, bad news these days is
[03:52:07.279 --> 03:52:13.199]  good news because the more stuff they break, the more out of control it gets. The globalists are
[03:52:13.199 --> 03:52:16.960]  building the army against them by their own actions.
[03:52:16.960 --> 03:52:21.199]  Six months ago, they said nobody wants to ban your gas stoves. It was official policy proposal.
[03:52:21.199 --> 03:52:28.800]  Now they're banning gas stoves and fireplaces, barbecuing and cold fired pizza ovens. I mean,
[03:52:28.800 --> 03:52:32.480]  they're going to take your pizza oven away saying it's bad. We put out carbon.
[03:52:32.480 --> 03:52:39.679]  Here's the thing, though, right? Our founders had such a level of wisdom and understanding
[03:52:39.679 --> 03:52:44.800]  of human nature, government and history as well. They actually gave us the tool.
[03:52:45.439 --> 03:52:54.160]  But Samuel Adams remarked that it ignorance that will cause us to come to our own destruction.
[03:52:54.160 --> 03:52:58.880]  He said no people will tamely surrender their liberties nor be easily subdued
[03:52:58.880 --> 03:53:03.840]  when knowledge is diffused and virtue is preserved. He said, on the contrary,
[03:53:03.840 --> 03:53:07.679]  when the people become universally ignorant and debauched in their manners,
[03:53:07.679 --> 03:53:12.880]  they will sink underneath their own weight without the aid of foreign invaders.
[03:53:12.880 --> 03:53:21.519]  The federal government unequivocally constitutionally has no authority to regulate
[03:53:21.519 --> 03:53:28.880]  charcoal gas ovens or any of that. The response and the cure to this overreach
[03:53:28.880 --> 03:53:36.480]  is the knowledge that the American people must acquire that they do not have to submit
[03:53:36.480 --> 03:53:41.840]  to these federal regulations when they are inconsistent with the Constitution.
[03:53:41.840 --> 03:53:46.960]  We don't need the Supreme Court of the United States on our side. As a matter of fact,
[03:53:46.960 --> 03:53:52.640]  the Supreme Court has been more wrong about the Constitution than they've been right throughout
[03:53:52.640 --> 03:53:59.439]  history. Article six clause two of the Constitution declares anything the federal
[03:53:59.439 --> 03:54:05.519]  government does that is contrary or not made consistent with the Constitution.
[03:54:05.519 --> 03:54:11.439]  The state and the people are not bound by that. And that's the amendment.
[03:54:11.439 --> 03:54:14.640]  That's it's Article six clause two, which is called
[03:54:14.640 --> 03:54:18.560]  ironically Amendment restates that. Yes, the Tenth Amendment restate.
[03:54:18.560 --> 03:54:24.320]  But what I'm referring to is the supremacy clause. But since 1830, the American people
[03:54:24.320 --> 03:54:29.840]  have been taught that the supremacy clause actually means the federal government is supreme.
[03:54:30.480 --> 03:54:36.240]  But in reality, it's the other way around. The federal government is inferior to the
[03:54:36.240 --> 03:54:38.880]  Congress. Will you come on? And I know your husband doesn't with you as well.
[03:54:38.880 --> 03:54:41.840]  Will you come on and teach a constitution class on my show? Absolutely.
[03:54:41.840 --> 03:54:43.599]  You guys are going to Texas to do that as well. A few weeks.
[03:54:43.599 --> 03:54:51.199]  Yeah. And we will be in Dallas on July 8th. We will be in Plano, Texas on July 7th.
[03:54:51.199 --> 03:54:54.960]  Come to Austin and come in studio. Oh, absolutely. We can do that.
[03:54:54.960 --> 03:54:58.240]  We're doing it. Wow. Please keep going. I'm I'm I'm wrapped here.
[03:54:58.240 --> 03:55:03.039]  Yeah. No, we actually have classes online that teach the American history,
[03:55:03.039 --> 03:55:06.160]  American Constitution, the way our founders before.
[03:55:06.160 --> 03:55:10.640]  Yeah, I've I've been I'm so honored to be here today. This is really
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:15.920]  impassioned around this whole crew. Amazing. They are amazing. We are honored to be here,
[03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:22.320]  a part of this. And what what's really amazing, Alex, is I could not sit under any other pastor
[03:55:22.320 --> 03:55:29.439]  than the one that I have because we have too many pastors that have been deceived by this
[03:55:29.439 --> 03:55:35.279]  whole rhetoric of the misteaching of Romans 13 that the church is supposed to slavishly
[03:55:35.359 --> 03:55:39.279]  submit to government. It's God. It's the truth. And it goes down.
[03:55:39.279 --> 03:55:45.840]  Absolutely. Absolutely. And that's what we need to reattach to. The globalists will lose in
[03:55:45.840 --> 03:55:49.359]  America. They're going to get frantic. They're going to get nervous. They're going to get
[03:55:49.359 --> 03:55:54.640]  extreme. They're going to get more extreme, but they will lose because America was built on the
[03:55:54.640 --> 03:56:02.560]  principle of of multiple constitution. We have a federal constitution that creates a very limited
[03:56:02.560 --> 03:56:10.800]  and defined federal government. But we have 50 constitutions of state that are designed to not
[03:56:10.800 --> 03:56:18.160]  work in conjunction with U.S. Constitution, but also to empower and reserve power to the state
[03:56:18.160 --> 03:56:22.480]  separation of power to limit the federal government. And again, that's like firewalls
[03:56:22.480 --> 03:56:26.160]  in an apartment building. Absolutely. Absolutely. Elon Musk a few months ago told the World
[03:56:26.160 --> 03:56:30.000]  Government Forum, we need like the American Constitution. We need division of power.
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:34.320]  Well, that's why the globalists hate America so much, because they can go into Europe and take
[03:56:34.320 --> 03:56:40.000]  over the prime ministers of these countries. They got it with one person with America.
[03:56:40.000 --> 03:56:45.679]  They cannot do that. This power is distributed. Power is distributed. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[03:56:45.679 --> 03:56:50.880]  Wow. OK, incredible. Thank you so much, Pastor J.C. Hall. Thirty second closing comment.
[03:56:51.759 --> 03:56:56.400]  I'm encouraged. I've heard Chris Ann say we are as encouraged as we've been in 10 years.
[03:56:56.960 --> 03:57:01.119]  The more they break, the more it stirs up the appetite for the American people to fix
[03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:06.400]  the problems. I see an awakening happening as we travel all over the country,
[03:57:06.400 --> 03:57:12.480]  amongst our young people, amongst our churches, amongst the so-called minority communities.
[03:57:12.480 --> 03:57:18.880]  So people are are under the gun of this abuse and oppression. And all it does is stir up the
[03:57:18.880 --> 03:57:26.000]  spirit of liberty within them. And the spirit of liberty is rising and the globalists are coming
[03:57:26.000 --> 03:57:32.080]  down. Praise God. All right. Thank you all so much. Owen Troyer takes over in 15 seconds.
[03:57:32.080 --> 03:57:36.720]  Infowars.com forward slash show band video. You're watching on TV. Infowars.com got a great

[03:57:45.119 --> 03:57:49.920]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce? Yeah. So my name is Ken Hecken-Ladley.
[03:57:49.920 --> 03:57:54.720]  How do I write all the books that I do? Four books with Dr. Judy Mykowitz, four books with
[03:57:54.720 --> 03:58:00.080]  Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones. That's because I use
[03:58:00.080 --> 03:58:05.840]  RainForce every day. What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:58:05.840 --> 03:58:11.359]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins. But the one thing that I have
[03:58:11.759 --> 03:58:18.640]  really found that makes a difference is RainForce. I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I
[03:58:18.640 --> 03:58:23.920]  go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff. So
[03:58:23.920 --> 03:58:29.439]  it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[03:58:29.439 --> 03:58:33.279]  All right. We love you. We'll be right back. Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra
