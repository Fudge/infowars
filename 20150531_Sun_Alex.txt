[00:49.920 --> 00:58.000]  may 2015 we're just about to be halfway through 2015 2016 and beyond
[01:00.960 --> 01:06.560]  i saw some emails and some comments on thursday and friday at info wars.com
[01:07.840 --> 01:16.400]  with trolls saying you better watch it claiming the hazards of pedophile you crazy conspiracy
[01:16.400 --> 01:22.560]  theorist none of the media is saying why he was paying somebody allegedly to hush him up
[01:24.640 --> 01:30.240]  really we had an investigative journalist on who documented it and said that they were basically
[01:30.240 --> 01:35.440]  blackmailing him that's why he was chosen as a wrestling coach to suddenly be run for the state
[01:35.440 --> 01:41.040]  house and then into the house of representatives and then be made a speaker of the house even
[01:41.040 --> 01:48.240]  though his tenure was incredibly junior and now the hill is talking about denise hasard's weird
[01:48.240 --> 01:55.360]  call from 2014 on c-span when somebody called in and said remember me denny well everybody can eat
[01:55.360 --> 02:01.680]  crow yet again here it is in the precious new york times yorkville where hasard's taut is shaken by
[02:01.680 --> 02:08.160]  charges for denny former house speaker denise hasard accused of hiding sex abuse of former
[02:08.160 --> 02:13.440]  student you better believe it's students and this guy is in the club folks the sandusky club
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.920]  like the rest of republican leadership hasard star wrestler standing behind indicted mentor though
[02:21.920 --> 02:27.200]  so everything's okay here's the headline out of seeing an hasard's hush money was to cover
[02:27.200 --> 02:34.960]  up sexual misconduct with former student sources say as if it took the media three four days to
[02:34.960 --> 02:41.760]  figure this out they all know notice rand paul is one of the only republicans
[02:43.360 --> 02:49.520]  saying he won't go along with the patriot act nsa spying he set the filibuster tonight we're
[02:49.520 --> 02:53.440]  going to break all that down today and that's because i'll guarantee you the worst he's got in
[02:53.440 --> 02:58.800]  his closet is taking hot chicks down to the river as a college student and smoking pot with him and
[02:58.800 --> 03:06.160]  talking about aqua budam that's it smoking pot and taking out cheerleaders that's all you got
[03:08.320 --> 03:14.400]  take the marijuana out of the equation he's a man of my own heart uh but it's just it's just
[03:14.400 --> 03:19.760]  classic and you add in the wall turkey into the equation in college and now you're where i was at
[03:19.760 --> 03:24.160]  but and i'm not even defending any of that it's just they have gone over his record with a fine
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.880]  tooth comb they can't find anything and that's why i'm telling you rand paul is the guy and he's
[03:28.880 --> 03:34.640]  being demonized in the media today from fox news to see an end because he is good
[03:36.480 --> 03:41.120]  and that's where i stand on that front we've got omali announcing that he's going to run against
[03:41.120 --> 03:47.600]  hillary hope he doesn't get on any airplanes soon uh but uh he may just be a ringer though
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.720]  so we're going to uh obviously follow that he says that leadership is what he's going to bring
[03:52.720 --> 03:59.280]  how about the constitution that'd be nice now that said we've got one minute to break i haven't
[03:59.280 --> 04:05.520]  even gotten into the news that's here the other meme i see from the trolls is where's the gun control

[04:10.400 --> 04:16.800]  obama care prices oh it's even in politico today that the prices are exploding under obama care
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.160]  where's the nsa spying oh i guess it is there oh where's the license plate readers oh i guess it
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.320]  is there where's the floor i'm causing cancer oh i guess they admit that now where's the where's

[04:39.040 --> 04:43.760]  i'm right i'm proving correct over and over again just because what we're covering hides in plain

[07:00.640 --> 07:05.920]  sunday news update because there's always so much news that breaks up with the weekend that the system
[07:05.920 --> 07:12.000]  tries to bury under the proverbial carpet okay let me just do it this way it's so over the top
[07:14.400 --> 07:18.480]  every day exponentially the news gets more insane i'm not the only one noticing that
[07:19.040 --> 07:27.360]  dennis haschert wasn't rocket science it's a pedophile cover up there's a whole ring up
[07:27.360 --> 07:31.920]  there in congress democrats and republicans they recruit their own people in they go right to the
[07:31.920 --> 07:36.880]  top because they're totally compromised we're going to play a clip that the hill newspaper
[07:36.880 --> 07:45.120]  is reporting on where dennis haschert's weird 2014 phone call on c-span we told you on thursday
[07:45.120 --> 07:51.360]  when it broke and on friday with the investigative journalist that broke all this in 2006 that haschert
[07:51.360 --> 07:57.680]  was covering up basically a pedophile ring so it's not just him having sex with people on the
[07:57.680 --> 08:05.280]  wrestling team allegedly and allegedly bill clinton's a liar and allegedly obama care increases
[08:05.280 --> 08:11.200]  your prices no it's not a legend where there's smoke there's fire congress is just chopped full
[08:11.200 --> 08:17.440]  of these predators it's a predator cult shame cult took over much of the catholic church it'll
[08:17.440 --> 08:22.400]  take over your school it'll take over your police department that's how evil operates
[08:22.400 --> 08:29.120]  so we're gonna be breaking all that down singing in haschert's hush money was to cover up sexual
[08:29.120 --> 08:36.560]  misconduct with former student sources say really think so we broke it all here in 2006
[08:36.560 --> 08:42.320]  on record with wane madson and i'm not bragging but we broke the nsa we broke the gun grabs we
[08:42.320 --> 08:50.480]  broke the carbon taxes we broke it all all of it but not because we're special the mainstream media
[08:50.480 --> 08:55.600]  lies and deceives on purpose their jobs to cover up what's really happening until it's too late
[08:55.600 --> 09:00.400]  then they try to spin it and that's why newspaper circulation in just the last 12 months what they
[09:00.400 --> 09:08.320]  had left is down 50 plus and hundreds of newspapers are closing as we speak afp reports on it newspapers
[09:08.320 --> 09:15.040]  struggle to find path in digital age well there are print publications that tell the truth that
[09:15.040 --> 09:22.480]  are also digital that are doing just fine look at info wars while we're just exploding
[09:24.640 --> 09:28.800]  all right i just hit one story there let me just give you the other headlines
[09:30.320 --> 09:35.040]  this is so big i'm not going to cover it till the start of the next hour administration preps new
[09:35.040 --> 09:42.800]  gun regulations from the hill newspaper up in dc of course the headline should be obama
[09:42.800 --> 09:51.040]  announces draconian unconstitutional executive bands on guns or obama becomes more of a dictator
[09:51.040 --> 09:57.280]  and vows to restrict the second amendment outside of law but see no one calls it that now when he
[09:57.280 --> 10:03.120]  erases the border and orders the border patrol to quote complete the smuggling process in their
[10:03.120 --> 10:09.600]  words that's from the border patrol and the border patrol it turns out called the new york times
[10:09.600 --> 10:18.080]  the washington post they called everyone including bright bart who does some good work on the border
[10:18.800 --> 10:23.760]  and no one would send reporters down to show the illegals being loaded on buses last year
[10:25.280 --> 10:29.520]  to be then shipped around the country and the board patrol being ordered to pay for it
[10:30.880 --> 10:35.920]  we went we did the interviews we showed the buses we talked the emergency manager mcallin
[10:35.920 --> 10:39.040]  he said none of this is hidden they've been doing it for the last few months we load the
[10:39.040 --> 10:42.880]  illegals on the board patrol gives them the vouchers they're sent to democratic party
[10:42.880 --> 10:47.040]  facilities and then they're given basically their voter id cards and you know the rest is history
[10:49.040 --> 10:55.840]  and what i'm getting in here is we break all this most of the time because no one else will do it
[10:55.840 --> 11:02.720]  because people are such cowards and so more and more the military you name it reach out to us
[11:02.720 --> 11:08.080]  with the key information because they know we're crazy enough to publish it and by crazy enough
[11:08.080 --> 11:13.760]  crazy like a fox crazy like thomas jefferson and george washington you'd have to be crazy
[11:13.760 --> 11:19.600]  to let the crux running wild continue you'd have to be crazy to lay down and die basically
[11:19.600 --> 11:27.840]  as a society i'm not doing it i'm actually sane take one look at haftord sees a big giant
[11:27.840 --> 11:35.680]  pus filled pedophile you can take a pedophile's have a look folks and the way he shot right to the
[11:35.680 --> 11:43.520]  top but i never went with that until we had the intel and the specifics and we again nine years
[11:43.520 --> 11:48.080]  ago broke it all down in an hour long interview about haftord and the pedophile ring and the pages
[11:48.080 --> 11:54.000]  and all the rest of it and this is only coming out now so they can scare the daylights out of
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.640]  congress to go along with the tpp and all the rest of it the trans-pacific partnership but look at
[12:00.640 --> 12:08.400]  this administration preps new gun regulations oh there's nobody coming after your guns
[12:12.880 --> 12:22.320]  i've had cbs news and algezera cbs news over the phone algezera here in person in the last couple
[12:22.320 --> 12:26.800]  weeks and they'll look you straight in the face and go there's no gun control in america no one
[12:26.800 --> 12:31.280]  wants your guns mr jones what do you say to that and i just i'm sitting with a tv camera on me and
[12:31.280 --> 12:35.760]  i go well a whole bunch of cities have totally banned them the you and admits under unidire they
[12:35.760 --> 12:42.240]  want the civilian ownership of firearms to be banned and i quoted them unidire they go no it's not
[12:42.240 --> 12:51.840]  and then they had the producer start laughing at me like like their peer pressure was going to affect
[12:51.840 --> 12:57.120]  me and make me feel like i was insane they were involved in gaslighting it's a total joke your
[12:57.120 --> 13:03.760]  mind control doesn't work on me jerks do you understand that other than making me want want
[13:03.760 --> 13:09.440]  to punch you in the face i mean yes it makes you want to break your job so i guess in a way it is
[13:09.440 --> 13:15.200]  working but the difference is i don't act on that i act on information warfare and i assault you that
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.960]  way with the truth up one side and down the other viciously because you're the ones attacking us
[13:20.960 --> 13:25.200]  you're the ones stealing our freedom you're the ones turning us into slaves you're the ones
[13:25.200 --> 13:30.240]  bankrupting our country and shutting down our industry you people are a pack of criminal scum
[13:30.800 --> 13:38.160]  i am saying i see you and i'm saying no no no no no more
[13:41.360 --> 13:45.840]  look at this they've got more than 15 bills that have been introduced in the congress
[13:45.840 --> 13:52.560]  bill would require gun owners to have liability insurance or pay $10,000 fine that's out of
[13:52.560 --> 13:58.960]  alabama.com hey let's expand on that here it is right here the justice department not congress
[13:58.960 --> 14:04.640]  plans to move forward this year with more than a dozen new gun related regulations according to a
[14:04.640 --> 14:12.400]  list of rules see hitler had rules these got rid of the voting after a while just he made rules
[14:12.400 --> 14:18.080]  and regulations the justice department plans to move forward this year with more than a dozen
[14:18.080 --> 14:25.440]  new gun related regulations not laws according to a list of rules rules like you have for your
[14:25.440 --> 14:30.240]  kids because your house is a dictatorship but not the country the justice department plans to
[14:30.240 --> 14:34.560]  move forward this year with more than a dozen new gun related regulations according to a list of
[14:34.560 --> 14:39.520]  rules the agency has proposed to enact before the end of the obama administration
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.960]  and we'll tell you about those coming up of course they're not releasing all of them now but we know
[14:44.960 --> 14:49.120]  what they've done every other time and we know what they just tried a month and a half ago
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.600]  the ar-15 or 556 223 uh bullet man
[14:56.400 --> 15:02.640]  so that's coming up i mean i've now read four stories out of about 150 um oh here's what i
[15:02.640 --> 15:11.520]  mentioned politico oh oh look there's the nice lady going in on the cover of it and she's she's
[15:11.520 --> 15:18.560]  basically crying as wendy gonzalez learns that her her prices are doubling and of course that's on
[15:18.560 --> 15:23.600]  top of the doubling that already happened and uh the lowest per uh uh increases are only 50% don't
[15:23.600 --> 15:28.160]  worry the cost of obama care could rise for millions of americans next year with one insurer
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.880]  proposing a 50 percent hike in premiums feeling the controversy of just about how affordable
[15:32.880 --> 15:38.400]  the affordable care act really is at first it was free then it was the price of a phone bill
[15:38.400 --> 15:43.520]  then a cable bill then you can keep your doctor let me give her by a little newsflash for so-called
[15:43.520 --> 15:49.440]  liberals that tune in to hear let me explain something foreign corrupt insurance companies
[15:49.440 --> 15:54.240]  wrote the patriot act they basically wrote the obama care act they wrote it all because they
[15:54.240 --> 16:01.120]  run the country and their profits are up almost 50 percent each year on top of each other hey how you

[23:05.040 --> 23:11.760]  down to age 11 children don't have consent till 18 there's a reason because sick freaks can
[23:11.760 --> 23:16.320]  convince them what's next that's right england and australia are trying to pass laws that down
[23:16.320 --> 23:21.440]  to age 12 or 13 depending on the country if your child gives consent they let me tell you somebody
[23:22.240 --> 23:26.160]  you go out to one of my daughters when they're 13 and i've got one that's 11
[23:26.160 --> 23:31.200]  and you say you had consent you're some 30 year old pervert i don't care what the law is you're
[23:31.200 --> 23:38.080]  going to be pushing daisies and oh but then i'll be a pedofobe that in fact that's already starting
[23:38.080 --> 23:44.480]  see let some old man love my seven-year-old daughter i got a seven-year-old daughter
[23:45.440 --> 23:50.080]  you know what a ball peen hammer is going to love your head when i knock you upside the head
[23:50.080 --> 23:57.680]  about a hundred times i'm sick of it i don't belong to you my children don't belong to you you control
[23:57.680 --> 24:04.880]  freak saxapus now let's go ahead and play a little call that the hill newspaper is reporting on
[24:05.440 --> 24:11.920]  from last year to denny haschert denny who was taken from nowhere and put the state house and
[24:11.920 --> 24:17.040]  then brought right in and it was only in congress three or four years before he's in leadership
[24:17.040 --> 24:20.320]  and then a few years after that he's the speaker unheard of
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.640]  let's go ahead and go to that clip uh illinois is our next call here's bruce uh independent line
[24:28.640 --> 24:36.960]  hi hello denny hey how are you doing pretty good remember me from yorkville bruce you're on go
[24:36.960 --> 24:47.200]  ahead with your question coming i think he's gone and see they had to burn haschert because they
[24:47.200 --> 24:52.480]  can't have the whole ring come out just like they send the former head of the fbi to cover up
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.280]  pen state that's basically the one of the major pedophile command bases and it'll all come out
[24:59.280 --> 25:03.600]  just like the vatican none of you guys are going to stop any of it you know this year they called
[25:03.600 --> 25:08.560]  it two months ago national security the prime minister of england said it's now a national
[25:08.560 --> 25:14.960]  security emergency and that they have to basically seal the pedophile scandal because of national
[25:14.960 --> 25:20.640]  security because it goes from the royal family right through parliament right into local government
[25:22.080 --> 25:29.280]  you say statistically maybe only one out of 200 people if you look at the criminology is a pedophile
[25:29.280 --> 25:35.120]  why are they seem to be every other person in government worldwide because it's a cult people
[25:36.000 --> 25:43.040]  rome got taken over by perv cults you know during the stoic rise of rome when they start stopped
[25:43.040 --> 25:49.440]  having kings and we're talking 200 bc or so in the golden age of rome if you'd shoot on your wife
[25:49.440 --> 25:55.120]  they would execute you and you know why because they'd already been through all the decadence and
[25:55.120 --> 26:01.040]  their society collapsed so then that's where the word stoic comes from is the roan the romans
[26:01.040 --> 26:08.160]  then by their fall what are they doing all the same stuff we see now and what architecture is dc
[26:08.160 --> 26:14.720]  it's romanesque the whole thing is classical not greek but roman architecture from the greek
[26:14.720 --> 26:23.520]  and they're just up there in a big caligula nero party
[26:25.520 --> 26:30.000]  out of touch but this time they've got nuclear weapons it's not like rome can just fall this
[26:30.000 --> 26:38.240]  time it's got nuclear weapons it's run by crazy people and you gotta ask
[26:38.240 --> 26:48.960]  why is it coming out now to blackmail congress oh by the way i was covering obama care out of
[26:48.960 --> 26:57.520]  politico when obama care started kicking in about two years ago i go i have a medical doctor i see
[26:57.520 --> 27:01.920]  maybe every four or five years for a checkup but i go to a local clinic my dad's a physician
[27:01.920 --> 27:06.160]  one of his friend zones and i'll go there if i got a sore throat or a sprain ankle or you know
[27:06.160 --> 27:10.240]  something like that to get checked on and i was there a couple times last year and i was there
[27:10.240 --> 27:14.800]  a few of the times with my kids and every time there were obama supporters they would say you
[27:14.800 --> 27:19.440]  know i'm a democrat but i don't like this obama care what do you mean my insurance just went up 100
[27:19.440 --> 27:26.080]  percent or 200 percent or 50 percent it varied and it was mainly every time i saw mainly black women
[27:26.080 --> 27:31.680]  in this big clinic i go to but it was just some hispanic women as well complaining going and
[27:31.680 --> 27:35.440]  they're like we're sorry man you've got to call your insurance company and they get on their phone
[27:35.440 --> 27:39.600]  well i'm sitting there for an hour waiting and they call and go what do you mean it's going up
[27:39.600 --> 27:47.840]  well that's just what it is under law insurance companies wrote obama care with the republican
[27:47.840 --> 27:54.480]  leadership and the democratic leadership to gang rape you and take your health care and create
[27:54.480 --> 28:00.400]  death panels and ration care and two that have computers when they're done with it and it's
[28:00.400 --> 28:06.640]  already phasing in tell doctors what they can do you will not get eye surgeries you will not get
[28:06.640 --> 28:12.000]  knee surgeries you're not when they're done you're not going to get jack squat and you're going to
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.360]  love it and guess what they've announced executive action on new taxes outside of law and they're
[28:17.360 --> 28:22.000]  announcing executive action on grabbing pension funds public and private and the supreme court
[28:22.000 --> 28:29.360]  just ruled last week they can do it they didn't used to rule that but next they might rule that
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.360]  you know you've got to have prima noctua and i guess when you have a child is born you've
[28:33.360 --> 28:37.840]  got to offer it up to the politicians you know prima noctua in old europe you had to offer your
[28:37.840 --> 28:42.640]  daughter up on her wedding night for the local lord but now maybe you'll just offer we already
[28:42.640 --> 28:47.600]  offer our children up the state anyways with vaccines maybe you're a pedofobe next if you

[35:08.240 --> 35:15.200]  in dung and torn to be sold at christie's auction you know there's such a thing as good taste
[35:15.200 --> 35:18.720]  if somebody wants to do that at free speech but why does christie's have to sell it
[35:20.880 --> 35:24.400]  oh but you're not hearing christians or catholics saying they're gonna blow it up though
[35:24.400 --> 35:32.240]  and speaking of that joe begs was at the draw mohammed free speech event in phoenix outside
[35:32.240 --> 35:39.360]  the mosque where the two shooters came from that attacked the similar event a few weeks ago in
[35:39.360 --> 35:45.600]  garland outside dallas the four hour archive of the live stream is on info wars dot com and
[35:45.600 --> 35:53.040]  prison planet dot com joe was going to be here today but one of his friends military veteran

[35:59.040 --> 36:05.840]  right now there are 22 suicides a day by veterans in this country and of course it's not a big news
[36:05.840 --> 36:15.680]  story just like uh we have the crisis of the no treat list the death penalty for veterans
[36:16.480 --> 36:21.680]  all over the country and we of course help break that here with dr dug rocky and others and
[36:21.680 --> 36:26.560]  for even knew the name of the program uh the Watson computer as it's called from IBM besides
[36:26.560 --> 36:32.400]  who lives and who dies but the people can all feel good because a computer program by the eugenicist
[36:32.400 --> 36:39.120]  cult the death cult uh said that you don't get treatment even though it's viable treatment you
[36:39.120 --> 36:44.960]  just die play ball with the globalist and you might get health care this is the new future where
[36:44.960 --> 36:50.560]  all of the resources are controlled i want to get to the tpp here in a moment and then rand paul
[36:50.560 --> 36:56.480]  set the filibuster in the senate the midnight passage of the patriot act that expires today
[36:56.480 --> 37:01.680]  i wonder if the isis teams uh the criminal elements and the government have brought in
[37:01.680 --> 37:07.680]  i wonder if they'll attack tomorrow uh if the patriot act expires how obvious will that be
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.840]  and then they've got push polls out you know rand paul doesn't want to keep you safe and
[37:11.840 --> 37:17.840]  doesn't want to be able to spy on terrorist groups do you think that's good oh no sixty some percent
[37:17.840 --> 37:23.760]  don't think it's good it's it's how they frame these things
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.240]  and there's just amazing fear mongering going on that we're all going to be attacked any minute
[37:32.240 --> 37:37.840]  if we don't let them spy on us without warrants to see the truth is the patriot act did legalize a
[37:37.840 --> 37:43.680]  bunch of this they just denied that it did that i mean it lets the government break in your house
[37:43.680 --> 37:48.640]  without warrants and plant stuff in the sneak and peak provision i mean it and then if you
[37:48.640 --> 37:54.320]  catch them you can't tell anybody or it's a felony violates the first amendment i mean it is just
[37:54.960 --> 38:00.640]  so unconstitutional north korea doesn't put stuff like this on paper the nazis didn't put
[38:00.640 --> 38:06.960]  stuff like this on paper the the communists in russia didn't do this they just did it only
[38:06.960 --> 38:12.800]  would our government run by a bunch of corrupt lawyers put it on paper rand paul declared surveillance
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.560]  war and hence it fellow buster for nsa reform justin amash and others in the house say they're
[38:18.560 --> 38:22.560]  going to be watching for a secret midnight attempted passage like happened last year
[38:26.800 --> 38:35.280]  but since i mentioned obama care here's the political article about well in 2014 it went
[38:35.280 --> 38:41.840]  up some in the 2015 and now in 2016 blue cross blue shield is announced in most states at least
[38:41.840 --> 38:47.040]  a 50 increase yeah my parents who never use their insurance never
[38:50.000 --> 38:58.320]  not since the late eighties got the word that over the next year it's about a year ago that
[38:58.320 --> 39:05.040]  would go up over a hundred percent and it's now gone up a hundred percent but again it's racist
[39:05.040 --> 39:12.800]  as msnbc said if you say that alex jones just like they said doesn't like obama care because he
[39:12.800 --> 39:19.920]  doesn't like a black president really i'd wash the feet of a black president that was a patriot
[39:19.920 --> 39:24.560]  i could care less what color they were that that's such an insult that i have to deny i'm a racist
[39:24.560 --> 39:28.560]  because i read a bill and know it's a screw job written by insurance companies how they just
[39:28.560 --> 39:37.760]  change the subject it's so discrediting how they do that here's the other article cnbc
[39:37.760 --> 39:46.320]  obama cares big overhead cost to top 270 billion dollars or a quarter of a trillion
[39:51.360 --> 39:52.560]  and that's just each year
[39:52.560 --> 40:02.480]  here why do you think the insurance companies wrote obama care and spent two billion dollars
[40:02.480 --> 40:06.160]  getting it passed because they wanted to help little old ladies and they cared about you
[40:07.680 --> 40:14.160]  the insurance companies the big ones are owned by the big mega banks that own the big defense
[40:14.160 --> 40:18.720]  contractors that run the whole show they're the ones funding going after your guns they're the
[40:18.720 --> 40:23.840]  ones funding teaching your five-year-old that they should be able to have sex with men you know
[40:23.840 --> 40:30.400]  when they're six they're the ones just just the whole sick agenda they're it a bunch of totally
[40:30.400 --> 40:36.640]  disconnected from reality banking families less than 20 families who basically own the world through
[40:36.640 --> 40:42.240]  fraud all the reason they put bernie made off in jail was because bernie made off cheated
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.840]  some of the elite themselves and then notice i predicted he'd you know commit suicide and so
[40:47.840 --> 40:52.880]  with his son and all the rest of it and you know the rest is history that's what they do
[40:55.680 --> 40:56.720]  that's how they operate
[40:59.920 --> 41:06.000]  and we just sit here now these bankers haven't mopped up russia they haven't fully taken over
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.280]  china they're competing with other criminal networks but they're the big boy on the block
[41:11.280 --> 41:18.240]  and they've dreamed of this total takeover plan to micromanage everything we do track everything
[41:18.240 --> 41:23.520]  we do shut down all competition so they can socially then do whatever they want to us which
[41:23.520 --> 41:29.920]  is just hellish that they now are willing to start world war three to get total hegemonic global
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.920]  domination and then the mainstream media goes i got a big joke for you this crazy guy and almost
[41:35.920 --> 41:44.240]  shown he claims mega banks central banks as if those exist he claims that they want total world
[41:44.240 --> 41:50.640]  domination everybody knows no one's ever wanted that and the average person does a double take
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.880]  who's even historically ignorant goes what do you mean the whole history of the world
[41:56.000 --> 42:03.120]  julia caesar ginges kahn a teller the hun and british empire the nazis the communists
[42:03.120 --> 42:09.920]  there's always sociopathic psychopathic control freak elites that lust to dominate and take over
[42:09.920 --> 42:16.240]  the whole world i mean that's a no-brainer and they just sit here and go no the sun does not
[42:16.240 --> 42:20.560]  come up in the morning there is no corruption no powerful groups creating together in special
[42:20.560 --> 42:25.920]  interest it doesn't exist no one thing as you grow up nothing's wrong nothing's happening
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.480]  don't investigate just keep your eyes closed and let us run your lives we'll take care of you
[42:30.480 --> 42:36.880]  and now we discover they won't take care of us we come back my son rex jones went out

[42:43.520 --> 42:50.960]  of more than 20 did not know what the tpp was and some of them got angry when um
[42:50.960 --> 42:55.040]  there'll be a part two there's just too many of these to put it on one report uh when when

[47:46.000 --> 47:54.720]  way i need to get him to do some more liners for us by the way i went back and got a glass of water
[47:55.520 --> 48:01.520]  during the last break in the break room and we keep seeing in on in there and fox news as well to
[48:01.520 --> 48:09.840]  monitor establishment propaganda and i took a double take they had the host interviewing someone
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.600]  and it's just about five minutes ago or three minutes ago now on on the dvr if somebody has
[48:15.600 --> 48:20.640]  the kind of a skeleton crew on sundays but somebody can go try to queue that up at least for tomorrow
[48:20.640 --> 48:31.120]  mark the time for about 447 446 or so or 445 maybe and the host but i mean it's the talking
[48:31.120 --> 48:35.680]  point it's everywhere it was like it's really not controversial everybody agrees with it and
[48:35.680 --> 48:41.760]  it's in the constitution that we have the patriot act and we need the nsa to do this inverted reality
[48:43.120 --> 48:49.280]  and i was thinking about the speech from obama's uh white house address we're gonna play a clip
[48:49.280 --> 48:54.640]  of this in a moment and he says look this is not controversial everybody loves it only a few senators
[48:54.640 --> 49:00.640]  that are you know bad guys don't like it like everybody loves drinking cyanide everybody loves
[49:00.640 --> 49:05.840]  jim jones kool-aid everybody loves sticking their hands down garbage disposals everybody loves being
[49:05.840 --> 49:10.800]  covered with lice everybody loves being run over by cars everybody loves dying everybody loves
[49:10.800 --> 49:16.800]  being slaves everybody loves having their double or triple their prices i mean i'm just i'm just sick
[49:16.800 --> 49:24.160]  of it but that's all they've got now is this wall of fraud this wall of incessant lying but they
[49:24.160 --> 49:30.960]  wouldn't be getting away with it if maybe 40 percent of the public i'm surprised can even tie
[49:30.960 --> 49:37.280]  their shoelaces or wipe their own hind ends if you go to a blue collar working area you'll find
[49:37.280 --> 49:41.440]  folks that are somewhat informed if you go to a conservative libertarian area you'll find folks
[49:41.440 --> 49:47.360]  that are informed you go to the university of texas or you go to a trendy area you go to downtown
[49:47.360 --> 49:55.600]  austin you'll find people that are in to being stupid and not caring every person we talk to
[49:56.400 --> 50:04.160]  that my 12 year old son talked to a reporter for info wars dot com thursday we heard this
[50:04.160 --> 50:09.040]  trotting on italy knows did not know basically what planet they were on or what the tpp is the
[50:09.040 --> 50:14.560]  trans-specific partnership that that is more of a conquering than king george because the
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.520]  regulations are worse than what he had on the colonies i mean we're being conquered
[50:21.600 --> 50:22.720]  and these people don't care
[50:25.040 --> 50:29.520]  because they've been raised with their apple products and their fluoride in the water and
[50:29.520 --> 50:36.560]  their tv and they're they're not conscious but they are alive enough to go vote for collectivism
[50:36.560 --> 50:41.920]  that the globalists are exempt from to screw us all over we are in grave danger we're not a democracy
[50:41.920 --> 50:49.920]  if 51% vote that the other 49er slaves we have a bill of rights it's a republic you can't do that
[50:50.480 --> 50:53.840]  there's a veto on certain basic things the country's founded on
[50:57.840 --> 51:04.400]  you know they claim that north korea is democratic hitler was elected i'm not gonna sit here and be
[51:04.400 --> 51:10.400]  these these idiot slaves let's go ahead and play this report rex jones the full videos on info wars
[51:10.400 --> 51:20.800]  dot com what do you think the tpp is ttp now what is tkp the dpp the what tpp i have no idea

[51:27.120 --> 51:41.520]  heck the tpp is no no nobody knows what this is i have no idea the toilet paper products the texas
[51:41.520 --> 51:49.040]  petroleum by the way hit pause back it up 10 seconds please rt did this in new york and got the
[51:49.040 --> 51:59.440]  toilet paper comment i mean that's real that's not an actor how about mind in the gutter these
[51:59.440 --> 52:06.320]  people are helpless but believe me you get into political debates with them they'll go uh races
[52:08.080 --> 52:14.880]  i mean they just they're not even alive let's go back to the clip i have no idea the toilet paper
[52:14.880 --> 52:25.200]  products the texas petroleum uh people the terrorist group i don't know and my name is a wwe
[52:25.200 --> 52:32.720]  thunderstorm roller coaster god bless at least he had some poetry words of wisdom i would honestly
[52:32.720 --> 52:42.560]  have no idea well she it gives information and and entertaining well i don't know exactly the
[52:42.560 --> 52:50.640]  words in in in english and that's what we call guessing probably some congress thing about homeless
[52:50.640 --> 52:57.840]  men tyrannical people in power actually pretty close actually pretty darn close toilet paper
[52:57.840 --> 53:04.640]  the tpp or the trans specific partnership trans trans what pacific partnership is a alliance of
[53:04.640 --> 53:11.520]  corporate global businesses that will then be able to and any of the three segments asian pacific
[53:11.520 --> 53:18.480]  european or american will be able to bypass any or all of the laws and rules in that place
[53:18.480 --> 53:23.520]  and be able to deal with currency and due process what do you think about that reminds me of what
[53:24.240 --> 53:29.360]  china does with their free market zones um i would definitely have to hear a lot more
[53:29.360 --> 53:36.000]  information because this sounds a lot like a bit of conspiracy theory to me i think it sounds a
[53:36.000 --> 53:44.160]  little bit farfetched i'm being totally honest i just don't care right now is that bad like i was
[53:44.160 --> 53:53.280]  just so unprepared for this uh i think that's awesome dude i think it's awesome why um i mean
[53:53.280 --> 54:00.000]  because we need people like that i guess i literally have no clue i've never i've been watching news
[54:00.000 --> 54:08.720]  is no all man okay well there you have it you guys don't watch news none of us have we just vote for
[54:08.720 --> 54:14.720]  obama and pray that he doesn't smite us with his mighty hand of vengeance um my first question for
[54:14.720 --> 54:23.840]  you is which party do you uh support third party libertarian okay okay good okay good i wanted to
[54:23.840 --> 54:29.600]  make sure i didn't end up on some like anti obama or something because it is texas
[54:33.440 --> 54:38.400]  oh my goodness and we've got part two of it where they get mad when it's when a 12 year old young
[54:38.400 --> 54:45.120]  man knows stuff they don't know because information now has become racist discernment any type of
[54:45.120 --> 54:50.640]  decision making and you look in the eyes of these people black or white there's nobody home
[54:50.640 --> 54:58.320]  in fact put that young lady that last one back up if you can there's a shot earlier in the when
[54:58.320 --> 55:02.800]  he first talked to her where she's looking straight onto the camera and man there's no body home
[55:03.920 --> 55:09.840]  i've seen dead bodies i've seen grandparents dead uh before when they're dead at the hospital i've
[55:09.840 --> 55:15.200]  seen my friend dead at the hospital i've seen quite a few dead people i saw a guy get his head
[55:15.200 --> 55:19.760]  basically chopped off almost severed on the side of the highway and a car wreck and i was there when
[55:19.760 --> 55:24.720]  he died and saw the light go out of his eyes i mean i'm all about getting that gleam in the eyes
[55:24.720 --> 55:29.680]  you look at her though when she's looking straight on the camera it's about halfway into the video
[55:29.680 --> 55:35.840]  and there's nothing there i've seen dead people's eyes and i'm telling you she's got the eyes of
[55:35.840 --> 55:43.840]  a dead person it's super scary when i first saw that video after they shot it raw i my heart fluttered
[55:43.840 --> 55:51.840]  at it because he's she's dead folks she's dead go ahead and hit play and then watch this look in her
[55:51.840 --> 56:00.480]  eye back it up again just just for tv viewers info wars.com forward slash show good player
[56:01.520 --> 56:06.080]  when she starts talking and repeating the establishment line that's when that's when
[56:06.080 --> 56:09.680]  her eyes go dead no it's it's it's another clip in there and the point is i don't think she's
[56:09.680 --> 56:14.480]  totally dead all the time but she goes in this trans look when she when she repeats the party
[56:14.480 --> 56:20.480]  line and it's like she's like we have come to your planet to assimilate you it is there's no
[56:20.480 --> 56:31.600]  way to resist us i mean it is it is it is truly cult like you know i don't think dead's the word
[56:31.600 --> 56:37.760]  though it's close to dead it's like a sleep it's like they're asleep i mean where's the gleam in
[56:37.760 --> 56:43.600]  the eye info wars.com it'll put the gleam back in your eye and that's what i'm looking for is
[56:44.480 --> 56:48.640]  people that are conscious and awake and have an instinct not to be slaves we're going to go to
[56:48.640 --> 56:54.080]  break come back and i'm going to get into the fellow buster coming up tonight with ran paul

[56:58.480 --> 57:03.200]  but that's the word as they try to sneak through the patriot act saying there's no bill of rights
[57:03.200 --> 57:08.480]  and constitution that they claim they've done all this illegal stuff on the back of though the fbi
[57:08.480 --> 57:13.600]  admits they've never stopped one terror attack using the patriot act but they have used it in
[57:13.600 --> 57:18.640]  hundreds of thousands of drug cases domestic violence uh white collar stuff you name it
[57:20.240 --> 57:25.600]  obama again swipes it hand full of senators holding up patriot act and says there's no
[57:25.600 --> 57:31.120]  controversy everybody loves it that clip is coming up today and more in the second hour

[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:41.840]  constitution the joke is they're using it as a instruction manual or an operations manual
[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:50.640]  but this is reality inverted of course your tv watches you of course there's death panels
[1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:56.240]  of course we don't give veterans health care of course the computers aside who dies of course it
[1:00:56.240 --> 1:01:01.600]  doubles and triples your prices i mean what's wrong with you racist obama care was always
[1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:08.480]  supposed to do that and you just sit here going to the dumb sheeple do you see what they're doing to
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:13.120]  you no one wants your guns nobody's coming after shotguns rifle semi-auto we're not gonna
[1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:18.240]  introduce one piece of gun legislation we believe in the second amendment vote biden vote obama
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:27.520]  and then bloomberg comes out last year it says headline bloomberg i'm the strongest supporter
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:34.080]  of bloomberg i'm the strongest supporter of the second amendment there he is he goes i believe
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:41.440]  in your right to have guns don't resist me like i'm saving private ryan when they're wrestling
[1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:46.160]  around the german soldier goes let's not fight anymore and the guy gives up for me just stabs him
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:51.920]  it's like no one's coming no there's no obama cares free it's all free everything's free
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:58.080]  okay actually the bill says it increases prices shut up but it says it shut up man i tell you

[1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:09.760]  and it's so mindless but then you realize the general public especially young people
[1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:16.160]  who are i mean as bad as older folks are who were raised in front of televisions their whole life
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:26.480]  in video games and are spoiled completely rotten i have seen young people at restaurants
[1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:31.680]  just in a days of decadence in tables next to me go
[1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:36.640]  like 10 year olds go where's my food where i wanted macaroni they're like there it is in your
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:41.680]  place where where and you think they're autistic they're not they're like where and their parents

[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:52.880]  watching two days of tv they can't even navigate the real world they walk and fall into fountains
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:59.440]  they walk into front of traffic i saw a video this weekend it's on info wars dot com and maybe
[1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:05.680]  you guys can pull it up the guy is on his smart phone his slave phone driving texting reading
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:13.200]  wrecks and is on the ground while he's you know hurt and the and the motorcycles crashed texting

[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:58.480]  i imagine as the public gets dumber and dumber and more and more brain damaged and more and more
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:08.160]  mindless imagine they're gonna hate us more and more i mean if we're able to talk we have
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:10.960]  they already think it's weird and fancy if you have a big vocabulary
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  they already think it's extreme like we got one that can read what a genius mic judge is with
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:32.320]  idiocracy where he talks like a fag and his own attorney is sitting there you'll make it up crap
[1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:38.560]  about him in the courtroom i mean that's what it's coming down to welcome to cosco i love you
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:47.040]  welcome to cosco i love you and then of course the argument is maybe the eugenicists have it right
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:51.600]  except then you realize wait they're trying to dumb down the smartest people and they themselves
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:56.480]  are getting hit by it they just hate humanity i mean we're in trouble we got a bunch of fat
[1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:02.400]  pedos running stuff it's planet pedo hey how you doing good brother just recently started using your
[1:05:02.400 --> 1:05:07.520]  products everything you said about is correct me and my wife both use a lot of them and that's made
[1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:11.440]  a lot of changes in our lives here well thank you brother it's because it also funds our operation
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:16.480]  but doing that i know i've got to have the highest quality super male vitality was developed to
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:22.720]  activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals we do the
[1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:27.920]  super male and the super female vitality big changes a lot of energy we've gotten off the
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:34.240]  cheap energy drinks energy shots they've got a ton of money there sourced from powerful organic herbs
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:41.440]  harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency they want to stun and dumb down
[1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:45.760]  and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience
[1:05:45.760 --> 1:05:50.400]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty
[1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:55.920]  exciting and i love it visit info wars at life dot com today to secure your super male vitality
[1:05:55.920 --> 1:06:09.600]  and other powerful products from info wars life
[1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:20.880]  it is only fitting that a free screen should sound the alarm against those who would destroy
[1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:29.120]  freedom for in its power to deceive and inflame or enlighten and inspire the motion picture has no
[1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:40.880]  equal and info wars dot com is classic hardcore libertarian constitutionalist pro freedom pro
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:50.240]  human radio fused into television and we pioneered it by necessity they say that necessity is the
[1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:58.880]  mother and the father of invention that's why info wars pioneered it 20 years on air at least
[1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:08.160]  17 years simulcasting at least part of the time radio with television thank you so much for joining
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:13.200]  us on this worldwide broadcast we're now well into hour number two joe begs is going to pop in
[1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:21.920]  on his busy schedule uh he was going to be in studio today but he had a friend military veteran
[1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:29.120]  that committed suicide so he's driving a couple hours to visit friends in a rural area of texas the
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:35.360]  grieving family he went to the draw the prophet mohammed demonstration in phoenix yesterday
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:42.640]  and flew with his um we didn't intend to do this but i guess he just thought to do it
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:49.040]  but you can you can fly with it you just check it i think he took a triton or maybe maybe took a
[1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:54.720]  provectus uh head down firearms dot com or a sponsor their accessories are amazing as well
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:59.920]  be sure and check those out head down firearms dot com but uh it was about 300 people out there
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:04.960]  strapping there at the mosque where the two shooters reportedly came from uh just letting
[1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:09.520]  folks know the first one that's alive and well and i get it it's trolling for radical muslims
[1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:17.920]  but at the same time first amendment is king second amendment uh is uh basically tan amount
[1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:24.400]  or a twin peak to it but the first amendment is even more powerful this is what mobilizes hearts
[1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:29.520]  and minds to then physically do something of need be it is greater not much but greater
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:37.280]  and uh i support it they're now saying they're going to kill the folks involved well you know
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:42.800]  what that's why we have a second amendment we're very welcoming open country but we're not going to
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:52.800]  adopt um dark age political views stone age political views um i'm a renaissance supporter
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:57.440]  and i do not support the dark ages and i'm not saying all muslims want the dark ages
[1:08:57.440 --> 1:09:00.880]  a lot of interesting things have come out of the middle east a lot of mathematics and science
[1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:09.200]  most of it pre islamic not saying there have been developments since then but it is certainly
[1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:15.600]  a problem so we're not going to just have some quiet slow death of the republic where we've
[1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:20.240]  got to give up our speech because it might offend radical muslims no we're going to exercise our
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:25.200]  our free speech and our second amendment to defend our first amendment that's why the two
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:30.800]  go together like a horse and carriage what's more important the carriage of the horses i
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:37.520]  think it's probably the horses but what would the horses do without a carriage
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:44.880]  that said let's start getting into senator rand paul is being demonized with the left
[1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:50.160]  and the right on fox cnn msnbc on monitoring they just get up there in a total confidence game
[1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:54.960]  that the world is flat and go look everybody supports it it keeps us safe it's in the constitution
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:10:03.520]  patriots away to go how dare this extremist i mean there's not a controversy everybody loves

[1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:58.240]  civil liberties enshrined in our constitution um but tomorrow sunday at midnight some important
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:03.920]  tools we use against terrorists will expire oh that's because congress has not renewed them
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:11.360]  and because legislation that would the usa are they pause is the usa freedom that it's freedom
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:15.440]  like the affordable care act that doubles and triples prizes and cuts the quality of care and
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:20.960]  rations and has death panels yeah it's got a great sound in there oh so it's pretty good to me
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.360]  it expires because people now know what's in it dirtbag
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:33.760]  oh my gosh i'm gonna have to control myself

[1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:06.160]  joe biggs really hardworking great reporter was covering maryland baltimore covering
[1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:13.440]  cleveland and then demonstrations there on police shootings and then he ran out to phoenix to cover
[1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:18.800]  that he was going to be here today but uh a connection he has the military committed suicide
[1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:23.040]  he's there he's trying to get there right now inside texas he's driving or he may have gotten
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:28.320]  there now i talked to him an hour ago uh so he was going to come on about the draw Muhammad contest
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:34.640]  and uh what happened there a tyranny is in america anti muslim armed rally organizer says he's
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:38.800]  headed into hiding after getting death threats i don't know what the former rain thought was
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:44.640]  going to happen when he did this but i just didn't show his ugly head at this event uh and whether
[1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:51.280]  you think it's trolling islam or not folks it is it is a first amendment so you have to support
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.840]  the right to exercise it joe biggs was there we can actually roll some background video from info
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:25:00.720]  wars dot com on the youtube channel where he was four hours of it right there but uh joe biggs you
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:05.360]  want to tackle the the first amendment issue and then this historic event in phoenix or do you want
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:12.160]  to get into 22 suicides in the military every day an all-time record high you add that to the don't
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:19.120]  treat list uh it's just it's just a true crisis well i'll get to the uh the uh the draw the profit
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:25.040]  event in phoenix first and one of the things that the the first amendment the second amendment
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:28.960]  well the second amendment was huge in play in this event because you have to look back at the uh
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:34.320]  the access to call ahead though now these people don't have the right to carry and they were
[1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:39.760]  essentially slaughtered and i think you know when when the the attacks in garland happened
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:45.440]  you know we have the right to protect ourselves uh you know the police officers will were well armed
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:53.520]  that they neutralize the situation and when they promoted this event in phoenix they said hey we're
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:59.760]  gonna have open carry as well so you think a couple low wolf gunmen are going to show up to an event
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:07.040]  when there's upwards of 50 to 60 people packing assault rifles handguns bossberg 500 shotguns
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:10.080]  they're gonna call something knows because they know they're gonna get taken down and let's be
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:15.120]  clear let's be clear i saw the chopper footage looked like about 500 people conservatively
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:20.080]  you're saying about 60 of those were armed yeah on the side that i was on because the police
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:26.480]  have split up both sides they had the uh the muslim uh pro muslim side on the side of where the
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:32.320]  mosque was and then we were essentially pushed on to another side and separated now both sides had
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:37.440]  peaceful people and both sides had extreme people there was a group of young muslim men
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:41.760]  who are calling to game rate some of the girls are on the side that i was standing on now that's
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:46.640]  not very peaceful yeah what is it about radicalism that it's into raping women i see that all the time
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:52.960]  how is why do feminists promote that i know feminists love radicalism why are they so into it i just
[1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:58.800]  don't understand it i mean the entire thing about feminism is to empower women uh rape completely
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:04.400]  to grades i mean that's wrong so i don't get how that somehow crosses over into that whatsoever but
[1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:09.600]  i mean i heard some bolder stuff on both sides and i can understand both sides you know the side
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:15.840]  on the muslim side they said they had a sign that said f is our isis uh but not islam which means
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:20.720]  the police said she can't demonize an entire religion because of a few bad apples just like
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:25.840]  with christianity there's been some extreme people on that side as well so i you know a lot of people
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:30.720]  out there think that you know because we're out there covering it and i was uh supporting the
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:36.880]  second amendment by having my hd firearm on me that i was basically trying to uh incite violence
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:42.720]  negative the reason that we carry guns is because there was a legitimate threat that isis could come
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:46.880]  and they had vowed to attack that area i'm not going to be a victim and i'm not going to let
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:52.640]  american lives be lost by a bunch of cowards who are just going to roll up and just start shooting
[1:27:52.640 --> 1:27:57.040]  well joe you're defending the republic now in america with that gun on your back
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:00.560]  even more than when you were in iraq and afghanistan so we salute your continued servant
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:08.560]  service as a servant to the republic so great job thank you i mean it was a great show to
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:13.680]  show people across the world that when you have an armed society there's going to be less things
[1:28:13.680 --> 1:28:18.560]  it's like i went to the gun show last week and i flew back from cleveland i was in austin for a day
[1:28:18.560 --> 1:28:22.880]  or so right before the flooding happened and then flew back to cleveland i went to a gun show
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:27.440]  no one was killed no one was shot there were guns everywhere people were carrying rifles
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:31.920]  everything was fine and peaceful people were out there just wanted to buy weapons nothing happened
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:37.920]  and just like the fact that we showed up to phoenix with our gun nothing happened people were able
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:43.840]  to demonstrate people were able to protest peacefully yes that's right the second amendment
[1:28:43.840 --> 1:28:49.280]  was there clearly defending the first we'll be right back with joe biggs i want to finish up with
[1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:55.520]  the draw prophet mohammed demonstration that was uh really huge and then we're going to get briefly
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:29:02.880]  into the mass suicides we see happening inside the u.s military the pentagon admits it accidentally

[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:20.880]  general public the anthrax samples were shipped from an army facility in utah to government and

[1:29:26.880 --> 1:29:32.880]  and virginia the labs were working as part of a pentagon effort to develop a new diagnostic test
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:39.680]  to identify biological threats in the environment dead or inactivated agents were expected but one
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:45.280]  lab reports being able to grow live axillus anthraxus the safety failure comes on the heels
[1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:51.200]  of increased scrutiny of bioterror agents and their oversight around the country last june
[1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:57.520]  more than 80 people may have been exposed to live anthrax when a cdc lab sent it by a mistake

[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:13.200]  i'm arrogant i'm bold in my fight against the globalist because that's what it takes
[1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:19.600]  to get people out of their trance and to lead folks and it's bold to see 60 something people
[1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:24.880]  armed out of 500 plus folks demonstrating for the first amendment when two men from a mosque
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:33.200]  went to a free speech event in garland texas and tried to kill people in cold blood
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:39.680]  including police who were just there to provide security under orders
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:47.440]  it's good to stand up against that now are some of the folks filled with hate for radical islam
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.560]  certainly or islam in general yes am i somebody that wants to wage war against muslim countries
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:57.040]  and destabilize their countries and put isis in control no that's our government doing that
[1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:04.160]  i don't want the clash of civilizations i don't want the war with islam
[1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:10.320]  but that's where all this is going joe begs finishing up on your four hours of live coverage
[1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:15.440]  friday night that was excellent as hundreds of thousands tuned in just to watch the streams alone
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:21.440]  other points you want to add then i want to shift gears into uh the sad errand that you're on today
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:27.040]  yeah so like we said earlier the second amendment really helped protect the first amendment in
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:34.720]  this event and it showed that other countries need to come and take on that american experience
[1:35:34.720 --> 1:35:40.320]  you know uh that spirit the fact that to be able to arm yourself that deters other people who want
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:45.680]  to do harm you know that shows what we did in phoenix coming out their arms and everyone still
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:51.040]  was able to peacefully protest yet there was no isis attack they always looked their cowards isis
[1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:58.000]  looks for weak spots that was not a weak target that was not a soft target we made it very hard
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:02.400]  for something like that to happen and i have to come in the police in that area too as well because
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:08.640]  the last threat from isis was that your guns are not going to be able to stop us they said no rounds
[1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:14.720]  even though you guys are able to open tary in a lot of states that will not stop our our our fighters
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:22.960]  and what that means is that the the idea of they were going to use most likely a vb id a vehicle
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:29.200]  born improv improvising closer device now when the cops not had any vets and known what that meant
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:33.760]  like i did because when i showed up i was like man i hope there's no big road where a vehicle
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:39.120]  could drive up part and set off a huge car bomb that would have taken out both muslim christians
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:43.360]  catholic whoever was out there they would have wiped out a whole lot of people and the police
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:47.760]  probably had a veteran on their side that the experience that i did so when i showed up there
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:53.440]  was no way within a mile to get close and bring a vehicle to that event so that stopped that threat
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:57.920]  and the fact that then we had armed citizens out there protecting people's rights to be able to
[1:36:57.920 --> 1:37:04.080]  speak that stopped that ice but and i just had said it was national news they were going to attack
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:08.320]  the event and we know isis has been allowed into the country they've been allowed to recruit inside
[1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:12.800]  the united states that's how they're different than their their father al-qaeda is that was pretty
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:18.720]  much a synthetic threat unless you were in country this is a real multi hundred thousand person
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:24.400]  organization that is being allowed to recruit by the west joe bigs how big was it if you're a new
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:29.600]  listener you can just search engine defense intelligence documents judicial watch west
[1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:35.600]  created al-qaeda and isis used them against syria how big is it that somebody leaked that from the
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:41.440]  military to judicial watch and now it's admitted what we already knew that the west is actually
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:46.800]  funding radical islam to take over the middle east oh yeah they wanted to destabilize the
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:50.960]  assault regime you know it was about two years ago when obama was trying to ask for permission
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:55.840]  to be able to go in Syria and they were denied and what happened they had to create the frankenstein
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:38:03.040]  they had to make a bad guy to be able to go in and do that so that's how isis was born isis was
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:07.760]  born from the fact that our government is so greedy they wanted to take out someone else they
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:12.160]  wanted to put in one of their western puppets to take over that area so they can get one step closer
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:16.720]  to their end game which i believe is iran they want to move closer and closer and take out those
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:21.600]  areas around there so they can eventually get their bases their planes in there and take out that
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:26.480]  area but these guys have created the problem and like i've said time and time again i've got a lot
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:32.640]  of friends in the air force to do air drops and they are on target now the only way that you can
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:39.440]  actually drop these supplies i'd highly doubt these air force pilots who are making these drops
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:43.840]  knowingly dropped them in the hands of ice if they were well they're told let's come out in the
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:48.080]  iraqi government they're told to drop at one spot they're told it's the Kurds or whatever and really
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:53.440]  it's al-qaeda exactly so they're given wrong coordination they're given wrong coordinates
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:56.480]  to drop those no like hey these are going to go to the rebels these are going to go to the guys
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:01.440]  who are going to fight isis and then we see all these videos on youtube live a week on the news
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:06.720]  where you see isis fighters holding american weapons american grenades american ammunition
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:11.600]  you know that's what's out of control well this is this is jumping with sharks though because it
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:17.760]  was the military two years ago that said no to a air war to take out a sod for al-qaeda that became
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:24.000]  isis so i think they've really gone too far in that the elites think they can fund al-qaeda and
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:29.120]  isis to murder every christian they find turn the world over to them and then our own military isn't
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:33.840]  going to wake up they're gravely mistaken joe finishing up tell us about why you couldn't be
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:38.320]  here in studio with us today because it shines a light and personalizes what's happened to our
[1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:44.640]  military well i've lost my second friend and the army to suicide now in the past uh two and a half
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:50.400]  months uh buddy of mine uh yesterday shot himself and he was struggling with depression
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:55.680]  and as we've talked about i've done a few reports and often we don't have the the greatest health
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:02.480]  care with the va we don't have the greatest air and they put in this watch in this ibm program
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:09.760]  named after the hollerous machine that killed tons of people millions of jews you know homosexual
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:15.120]  gypsies all these people let's be clear we're not joking they have ibm machines that decide not to
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:20.560]  treat us veterans even if you're healthy they just decide you don't get treatment and so the you
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:24.320]  can't get treatment for what's wrong with you coughing up blood all the other stuff you're
[1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:28.880]  saying that was connected to your friend uh it has to be because this is someone like when
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:32.720]  him and i would meet we would have in-depth conversations and it would kind of help him
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:38.320]  it would help me or be therapy for the both of us and i've been working on some uh you know uh
[1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:43.840]  some projects as well with people uh dealing with ppsd trying to reach out to veterans and let
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:47.040]  them know that there's other people out there that are going to be exact same thing as them
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:52.000]  and i've done some videos and i've talked with people and this was one of the guys that was
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:56.160]  part of that and i would speak to him on a daily basis and you know many times that we both kind
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:41:00.560]  of break down and cry because we both dealt with a lot of the same depression a lot of the
[1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:07.680]  being sensitive these pointless wars to fight for something that was all a lie and after that
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:11.920]  depression that's been to know that you went out and you fought for your country and then your
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:15.360]  country lied to you the fact that you went out there and you fought and you watched your brother
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:21.760]  and sister die beside you and were murdered because of a lie well sure plus these these
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:27.120]  watson computers are already saying don't give these veterans treatment robots then are already
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:33.200]  killing humans right now not just autonomous drones robots are already killing humans and it's
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:39.520]  the thomas watson computer named after the guy that gave hitler the computers to sit there and
[1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:44.640]  decide who lived and died i mean you can't make this up jay yeah exactly i mean that's what people
[1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:49.680]  don't understand there is a real war on against veterans in this country a lot of people think
[1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:53.920]  it's bs they think oh you know you guys are just being really extreme about it i mean it's not
[1:41:53.920 --> 1:41:59.600]  extreme you know i've already had five of my appointments with a v8 i have my foot it's been
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:04.080]  mangled to look at and i keep getting a letter in the mail every every two weeks saying that

[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:47.920]  make us stronger quote nichey what is the vote 76 to 15 or something right now they're about to
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:53.840]  finish voting with senate to limit debate and try to stop senator rand paul from blocking it tonight
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:57.520]  when they try to sneak the vote to reauthorize the patriot act through
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:05.920]  and we've got a full court press by mainstream trader media corporate globalist propaganda
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:12.960]  tokyo rose wannabes knowing it just protects the constitution it just gives you freedom it
[1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:19.040]  keeps terrorists from blowing you up just let us spy on you and put microchips and everything

[1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:58.160]  did you get your free health care did you get your goodies no you didn't
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:08.080]  the globalists want to conquer the planet to then control all the fruits of human development for
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:14.720]  themselves not for humanity they are horrible there is an epic battle going on for the future
[1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:22.720]  of those species now you're living in a real hardcore three and fourth dimensional science fiction
[1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:31.600]  movie it's incredible it's bigger than espn it's bigger than acting cool in front of your friends
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:40.000]  it's bigger than botox injections it's big it's as big as the universe and i'm tuned into that
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:45.600]  so they call me eccentric than i am let's go to obama's lies though from his little uh

[1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:08.880]  let's just play the three-minute clip and then i'll come back and go over the lies here is
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:17.600]  courted jamie fox our lord and savior barack obama hi everybody as president and commander in
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:23.040]  chief my greatest responsibility is the safety of the american people and in our fight against
[1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:30.000]  terrorists we need to use every affected tool at our eyes both to defend our security and to
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:37.360]  protect the freedoms and civil liberties enshrined in our constitution but tomorrow sunday at midnight
[1:51:37.920 --> 1:51:43.360]  some important tools we use against terrorists will expire that's because congress has not
[1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:50.640]  renewed them and because legislation that would the usa freedom act is stuck in the senate freedom
[1:51:50.640 --> 1:51:56.560]  want to be very clear about what this means today when investigating terrorist networks
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:52:01.280]  our national security professionals can seek a court order to obtain certain business records
[1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:06.080]  our law enforcement professionals can seek a roving wiretap these that were professional
[1:52:06.080 --> 1:52:10.800]  like it when they switch cell phones just call sandusky a professional wiretap on so-called
[1:52:10.800 --> 1:52:15.680]  lone wolves suspected terrorists who may not be directly tied to a terrorist group
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:22.320]  these like you funding al-qaeda controversial since 9 11 they've been renewed numerous times
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:28.880]  fbi director james comey says they are essential and that losing them would severely impact
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:32.960]  terrorism didn't stop one terror attack fbi but if congress doesn't act by midnight tomorrow
[1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:39.760]  these tools go away the usa freedom act also accomplish something i can't help back it up
[1:52:39.760 --> 1:52:43.520]  this is the guy that erased the southern border and pays to bring illegals in i mean
[1:52:43.520 --> 1:52:49.760]  i mean but again his supporters can't even hardly talk all they do is cash welfare checks
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:56.960]  so it's like game over man game over the country zombies dude there it is washington
[1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:03.280]  times fbi men's no major cases crack the patriot act snipping powers let's go back to the uh
[1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:12.400]  kleptocrat congenital liar in chief here it is terrorism investigations oh yeah but if congress
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:19.280]  doesn't act by midnight tomorrow these tools go away the usa freedom act also accomplish is something
[1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:26.240]  i called for a year and a half ago it ends the bulk metadata program collection of phone records
[1:53:26.240 --> 1:53:32.080]  as it currently exists and puts in place new reforms oh the government will no longer hold
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:37.120]  these records impossible telephone total lie they call it metadata they record all the phone calls
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:43.520]  everything they built giant spy centers everywhere obama has accelerated everything i mean it's just
[1:53:43.520 --> 1:53:48.240]  like everything he says is a lie it's like what he said i'm gonna stop militarization of police
[1:53:48.240 --> 1:53:52.800]  when he's troubled the funding for it and then you read oh i'm federalizing him but they still get
[1:53:52.800 --> 1:54:01.600]  everything let's go back to the club providers will the act also includes other changes to our
[1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:06.640]  surveillance laws including more transparency to help build confidence among the american people
[1:54:06.640 --> 1:54:11.920]  confidence that your privacy and civil liberties are being protected but if congress doesn't act
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:19.200]  by parallel construction with the dea for decades creates fake court cases with illegally gained data
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:24.960]  and fake announcements and fake filings on how they got the evidence with fake informants because
[1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:30.960]  it's all really from computers and phone records and recordings i mean it's all a manifest premeditated
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:36.800]  fraud with this con man they're praying on his mindless idiot supporters let's go back to it
[1:54:36.800 --> 1:54:42.640]  tomorrow at midnight these reforms will be in jeopardy as well oh no it doesn't have to be this
[1:54:42.640 --> 1:54:48.640]  way the usa freedom act reflects ideas from privacy advocates our private sector partners
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:54.880]  and our national security experts it already passed the house of representatives with overwhelming
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:55:02.240]  bipartisan support republicans and democrats that doesn't happen very often a majority of the senate
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:08.800]  all right it was and democrats have by the way in 2011 he signed an authorization of the same
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:13.040]  patriot act so his claim that he was against it when he ran for office then he went ahead and went
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:20.560]  for it i mean i'm just documenting lies here let's continue voted to move it forward so what's the
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:27.040]  problem good post a small back it up he's like listen the pedophiles that we stabled and trained
[1:55:27.040 --> 1:55:31.040]  and hired when they got busted at high schools that's why most of them are either lawyers or
[1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:34.960]  pedophiles from high schools that got caught raping kids he's like listen we spent a lot of time
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:39.680]  hiring and promoting a bunch of pedophiles that we can destroy anytime we want up there and they're
[1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:45.120]  all for passing it so the problem is we got a few senators that aren't pedophiles and a few
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:50.320]  house members that aren't pedophiles that we can't destroy right away so we're trying though don't
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:55.520]  worry and and they're the reason we haven't passed this in fact let's go back to the clip or
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:02.640]  republicans and democrats that doesn't happen very often a majority of the senate republicans
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:09.040]  and democrats have voted to move it forward so what's the problem a small group of senators
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:14.000]  who aren't pedophiles in the way and unfortunately some folks are trying to use this debate to score
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:20.320]  political points but this shouldn't and can't be about politics oh no it's a matter of national
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:25.520]  security oh terrorists like al-qaeda and isle aren't suddenly going to stop plotting against us at
[1:56:25.520 --> 1:56:30.800]  midnight tomorrow oh no and we shouldn't surrender as your air drop them weapons are safe it would be
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:37.600]  irresponsible it would be reckless yes we shouldn't allow it to happen so today i'm calling on americans
