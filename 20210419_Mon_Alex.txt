[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  It's the worst, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:22.000 --> 00:34.680]  I've known this since I began studying the globalist operations 30 years ago, plus, but
[00:34.680 --> 00:43.560]  it just so happened sitting in my hotel room down in McAllen, Texas at night after we'd
[00:43.560 --> 00:49.000]  been out on the border all day, surveilling the control collapse of our nation and ringing
[00:49.000 --> 00:58.480]  the alarm bells that I saw on one of the old history channel pieces, an hour-long documentary
[00:58.480 --> 01:01.680]  about Joseph Stalin that was pretty accurate from the books I've read and the research
[01:01.680 --> 01:07.360]  I've done, even from the Allied and then also Nazi perspective.
[01:07.360 --> 01:10.280]  But I was watching, and it was all about Stalin and his life.
[01:10.280 --> 01:14.320]  It was a documentary not about World War II but about Stalin, so the last third was
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.920]  World War II, the rest of it was him growing up and then rising to power.
[01:18.920 --> 01:27.200]  And I was watching the lion's share of it being about the Bolshevik overthrow of Russia
[01:27.200 --> 01:34.320]  and how it took them 15 years to get control of Russia and how they did it.
[01:34.320 --> 01:43.160]  And it's an exact carbon copy, just lower tech, of what the left is doing here today.
[01:43.160 --> 01:50.520]  And just like the Bolsheviks were funded by extremely rich, powerful central banks, the
[01:50.520 --> 01:56.840]  same people funding the Bolsheviks funding the globalist system today, it just hit me
[01:56.840 --> 01:59.640]  how amazing the parallels were.
[01:59.640 --> 02:11.040]  And even the left said from the October Revolution 1918, the end of World War I, that they'd been
[02:11.040 --> 02:15.480]  launching their new October Revolution and that's why they're preparing race war in this
[02:15.480 --> 02:20.520]  country as the cover for their breakdown of society, their takeover of the police departments.
[02:20.520 --> 02:24.480]  And once they've got control of local police departments, which Soros is spearheading, they
[02:24.480 --> 02:32.400]  plan to persecute and purge the American people and they've got a systematic plan to do it.
[02:32.400 --> 02:36.360]  And the new world order globalists are going to set off shore while millions of their own
[02:36.360 --> 02:40.400]  minions die fighting us.
[02:40.400 --> 02:45.760]  And so the left is putting themselves into a position of total destruction to carry this
[02:45.760 --> 02:47.680]  operation out.
[02:47.680 --> 02:53.200]  And you see, oh Biden, say we're going to use the CIA and the military against the American
[02:53.200 --> 02:54.200]  people.
[02:54.200 --> 02:59.160]  And you see them, you see Congressman Nunez, the ranging Republican on the House, intelligence
[02:59.160 --> 03:02.320]  committee warning of them saying they're going to do this to us.
[03:02.320 --> 03:04.320]  I mean, this is really happening.
[03:04.320 --> 03:10.280]  And of course, Stalin was funded out of New York City and out of London with hundreds
[03:10.280 --> 03:13.480]  of millions of dollars at that time, that'd be billions today.
[03:13.480 --> 03:22.480]  He was the bag man for Lenin, but directly working for, I mean, it was even in the documentary
[03:22.480 --> 03:28.280]  that top U.S. financiers and British financiers were funding Lenin and Stalin the whole time.
[03:28.280 --> 03:31.440]  And this is on the history channel.
[03:31.440 --> 03:32.440]  Just amazing.
[03:32.440 --> 03:37.240]  In fact, I wrote down the name of the documentary and then I somehow it's a race out on my phone.
[03:37.240 --> 03:38.400]  I'm going to find it during the break.
[03:38.400 --> 03:41.640]  I was looking just during about a minute before we went live.
[03:41.640 --> 03:44.360]  I couldn't find it and I was getting flustered by that, but I'll tell you the particular
[03:44.360 --> 03:45.360]  name of it.
[03:45.360 --> 03:46.360]  It's a three-parter.
[03:46.360 --> 03:49.400]  But let me do this.
[03:49.400 --> 03:52.280]  I'm starting to show a little bit different than I normally do because we really do need
[03:52.280 --> 03:55.040]  to have funding plus these are great products.
[03:55.040 --> 03:58.120]  We've launched the new sales and you can see those here in front of me.
[03:58.120 --> 04:00.880]  I'll tell you about that a little bit more in the next segment.
[04:00.880 --> 04:05.360]  But right now, I want you to know that I've extended the bottom mineral fusion sale at
[04:05.360 --> 04:10.760]  40% off, even though we're about to sell out for one more day and that it's going to go
[04:10.760 --> 04:11.760]  off sale.
[04:11.760 --> 04:12.760]  It's very close to selling out.
[04:12.760 --> 04:16.280]  We won't get more for a few weeks, maybe longer, but we've got a lot of new products
[04:16.280 --> 04:24.040]  that are on sale, Prostagard, Alpha Power, Rocket Rest, and we have plenty of X2.
[04:24.040 --> 04:25.040]  It's on sale.
[04:25.040 --> 04:29.880]  We have plenty, of course, of Winner, Son, the highest quality bottom and D3 for your
[04:29.880 --> 04:30.880]  family.
[04:30.880 --> 04:32.240]  It's 40% off as well.
[04:32.240 --> 04:37.040]  And we have in-game, a back-in-print, the film that predicted it all, more important
[04:37.040 --> 04:38.040]  now than ever.
[04:38.040 --> 04:41.760]  It is being sold as low as $395 per DVD, so you give them to your friends and family.
[04:41.760 --> 04:45.920]  There's a zero country code on it, so you can make copies of it everywhere you are in
[04:45.920 --> 04:46.920]  the world.
[04:46.920 --> 04:50.320]  I want you to get it, and I want you to make copies and say, hey, here is the DVD you're
[04:50.320 --> 04:51.320]  not supposed to see.
[04:51.320 --> 04:55.360]  Most folks still have DVD players, and it's a really great way to wake people up, so please
[04:55.360 --> 04:59.200]  get in-game while you still can, massively discounted, in Full War Store.
[04:59.200 --> 05:03.960]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[05:03.960 --> 05:08.200]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[05:08.200 --> 05:09.200]  pass.
[05:09.200 --> 05:12.360]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[05:12.360 --> 05:16.560]  a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold, being
[05:16.560 --> 05:17.560]  totally enslaved.
[05:17.560 --> 05:21.360]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[05:21.360 --> 05:22.360]  that move.
[05:22.360 --> 05:26.360]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[05:26.360 --> 05:32.040]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[05:32.040 --> 05:36.960]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[05:36.960 --> 05:42.640]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[05:42.640 --> 05:47.240]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[05:47.240 --> 05:53.240]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't
[05:53.240 --> 05:59.080]  get more IMF and World Bank money, and that's why we have to really get educated about the
[05:59.080 --> 06:28.280]  globalist.
[06:28.280 --> 06:34.840]  It's Monday, April 19th, the year is 2021, I am your host Alex Jones, and this makes
[06:34.840 --> 06:43.720]  me remember what happened back in 1995, how so many, so many years ago, I guess that would
[06:43.720 --> 06:56.640]  be 26 years ago, or is it 27 years ago, the Oklahoma City bombing, which if you study
[06:56.640 --> 07:02.000]  it, had not just federal fingerprints all over it, we know exactly who bombed the building,
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.320]  how they bombed it, we had witnesses of the men planting the bombs inside, we had police
[07:06.320 --> 07:11.360]  officers tortured and murdered who also reported what they saw, I've had police officers on,
[07:11.360 --> 07:15.000]  the FBI came to their offices and said, we'll kill you and your wife, if you keep talking
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  about what you saw that day, Don Browning, the K9 unit head, a Marine Corps veteran,
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.920]  came on my show and named the FBI agents' names, they came to his office and said,
[07:24.920 --> 07:31.760]  we will kill you and your wife, you know, my show and named them, so that's the reality
[07:31.760 --> 07:39.560]  of all of this, ladies and gentlemen, just always remember, we are in the season of false
[07:39.560 --> 07:45.320]  flags right now, thank you for joining us, and we have quite the headline up on infoawards.tombaday
[07:45.320 --> 07:53.720]  for the live show, the Democrat deep state is announcing plans to burn down the United
[07:53.720 --> 07:59.240]  States, they've got Chris Cuomo saying white people need to die, they've got Maxine Waters
[07:59.240 --> 08:05.600]  saying it's time to have violent riots, we have got all the different surrogate Democrats
[08:05.600 --> 08:11.040]  on TV, from everywhere from MTV to the hip hop radio channels, saying go out and attack
[08:11.040 --> 08:18.880]  white people, shoot police, burn down buildings, the manyapolis police department officer
[08:18.880 --> 08:26.800]  does not get convicted in the chauvin trial where they start final arguments today, so
[08:26.800 --> 08:30.160]  we can potentially have a verdict by the middle of the week, end of the week, depending on
[08:30.160 --> 08:34.120]  how long these final arguments go, and then depending on how long the jury is out, they
[08:34.120 --> 08:38.440]  can be out an hour, they can be out a week, they can be out a month, but imagine you've
[08:38.440 --> 08:42.840]  got all the serious things going on, the country being destroyed, thousands and thousands
[08:42.840 --> 08:49.400]  dying from vaccine complications, martial law going in worldwide, open borders, the
[08:49.400 --> 08:55.000]  dollar being devalued and the big corporate establishment media, just like WikiLeaks tells
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.960]  us they would do, is busy trying to cause the breakdown of society, and then the media
[08:59.960 --> 09:03.840]  will say whoever is killing cops or burning down police stations are angels, and the
[09:03.840 --> 09:08.320]  answer is having those departments go under strong city training, started by Obama to
[09:08.320 --> 09:12.800]  put them under UN training manuals, and then as long as they operate as political officers
[09:12.800 --> 09:16.680]  like they do in Canada, or like they do in England, or like they do in Australia, then
[09:16.680 --> 09:21.880]  there won't be any more demonization of the police, as long as they become political commasars,
[09:21.880 --> 09:28.520]  like in the old Soviet Union, and persecute gun owners, conservatives, Christians, men,
[09:28.520 --> 09:35.880]  and others, and so that is the divide and conquer plan, coming up next segment, I'm
[09:35.880 --> 09:40.840]  going to play you the latest riot footage out of Minnesota, out of Portland, out of
[09:40.840 --> 09:47.920]  other areas, it's become a backdrop, now burning police stations, burning Apple stores, burning
[09:47.920 --> 09:54.160]  government buildings, people dead, people shot, ball of cocktails, bricks being thrown
[09:54.160 --> 10:04.960]  at police, all of this is good and loving and liberal, but when a million people show
[10:04.960 --> 10:09.320]  up in DC, a couple hundred thousand go to the Capitol, a couple hundred break into the
[10:09.320 --> 10:14.640]  Capitol led by Antifa, then the few hundred that go in in the velvet robes, they get
[10:14.640 --> 10:20.440]  charged, many of them are still in jail, two, three months later, and Maxine Waters talks
[10:20.440 --> 10:24.360]  about how dangerous they are, and how bad they are, and how they're the most evil people
[10:24.360 --> 10:34.840]  in the world, but then, there she is, ladies and gentlemen, here's some of the headlines,
[10:34.840 --> 10:40.760]  let this rush to defend Maxine Waters as expulsion petition circulates, ever she incited scores
[10:40.760 --> 10:48.080]  of violent rioters and insurrectionists, with her long history of saying, you confront people,
[10:48.080 --> 10:51.000]  you get in their faces when they're eating dinner, when they're getting gasoline, when
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.040]  they're at the store, you go after them, and they do do what she says, and there she is
[10:55.040 --> 11:02.760]  wearing the clown outfit, of a pink leopard print mask, and big face goggles, that goes
[11:02.760 --> 11:09.400]  all the way over her mouth and her face, like she's in the NFL to protect her from the virus.
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.560]  Coming up, I've got a bunch of videos of Jeb and her wolf off camera with this other state
[11:14.560 --> 11:18.000]  reps in Pennsylvania saying, yeah, it's all theater, just put your mask on, and then take
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.160]  it off, and you go to the podium, and then you've got last week, the Justice Department
[11:22.160 --> 11:28.000]  official caught no mask on behind the curtain, puts it on to walk out and wear it, and you've
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  got them admitting it, and now that's why Fauci wears mask on TV, because right when
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.680]  you start pushing to have them taken off, oh no, no, no, no, no, it's all the symbol
[11:39.680 --> 11:45.080]  of your enslavement, that's why Fauci now said, oh, you got to take vaccines, but they
[11:45.080 --> 11:48.920]  don't protect you in a new quote, it's the mask that does, because that's the symbol
[11:48.920 --> 11:53.040]  of the emergency, that's the symbol of the fear, that's the symbol like an Islam that
[11:53.040 --> 11:59.560]  they own you when you're a woman. All the stories are up on inforwars.com right now,
[11:59.560 --> 12:06.160]  look at this, leftist rush to defend Maxine, here's another one, get more confrontational
[12:06.160 --> 12:17.000]  Maxine Waters across the state lines inside BLM protesters. If Pelosi doesn't take action
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.560]  against Maxine Waters, McCarthy promises he will, oh yeah, McCarthy and the Republicans
[12:21.560 --> 12:25.600]  said that everybody at the Capitol was like Hitler and Satan, even if they weren't violent
[12:25.600 --> 12:31.080]  and deserve 50 years in prison, so at least he's consistent, now that Maxine as a leader
[12:31.080 --> 12:35.920]  goes way beyond what Trump did, he did golfer violence, he's now at least growing a little
[12:35.920 --> 12:40.840]  bit of wave-os I guess, but yeah, she should get in serious trouble. We also have the audio
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.800]  of this coming up next segment, National Guard targeted and drive-by shooting hours after
[12:45.800 --> 12:53.760]  Maxine Waters told BLM to be more confrontational. Again, coming up to the NationalFall.com police
[12:53.760 --> 12:59.160]  dispatch response, Minneapolis shooting after Maxine Waters, incites riot, 10 to 15 shots
[12:59.160 --> 13:06.240]  happens within an hour and it goes on and on and on and that ties in to Marjorie Taylor
[13:06.240 --> 13:12.400]  Green proposes expelling Maxine Waters from Congress and this is where it really gets
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.480]  sick, we'll cover this when we come back. Document show Maxine Waters requested police
[13:16.480 --> 13:23.520]  escort before screed advocating for violence and that's what's really sick about all of
[13:23.520 --> 13:29.640]  this is. They all have private bodyguards in Minnesota when they defunded what, half
[13:29.640 --> 13:33.560]  the police department money a couple years ago, or I guess just last year, it's like
[13:33.560 --> 13:38.240]  a million years ago, so much has happened, they then did a multi-million dollar contract
[13:38.240 --> 13:43.560]  to have 24 hour private armed security for all of the city council. They don't see any
[13:43.560 --> 13:52.040]  hypocrisy or paradoxical thing there because it's all about being in your face, it's all
[13:52.040 --> 13:59.840]  about flouting all of this in your face and they do it more and more and more. They have
[13:59.840 --> 14:05.200]  protection, they have gates, they have walls, they have fences, they have surveillance, they
[14:05.200 --> 14:11.200]  have helicopters, they have tanks, they have jets, they have nukes, they have moats, they
[14:11.200 --> 14:20.120]  have castles, they have parapets, they've got food on the table, they've got transportation,
[14:20.120 --> 14:26.000]  they got medicine, but you don't and while they steal everything from everybody and devalue
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.480]  the dollars as fast as they can, just like the Bolsheviks did, they promised everybody
[14:32.480 --> 14:37.120]  in Russia, let us have control over the czars and you'll all not have to work anymore, you'll
[14:37.120 --> 14:44.760]  lose your chains, all it loses is your chains and you will have a chicken in every pot and
[14:44.760 --> 14:47.480]  they ended up starving tens of millions of deaths and murdering millions and millions
[14:47.480 --> 14:54.160]  of millions with enjoyment, with pleasure, on purpose and it's the very same satanic
[14:54.160 --> 14:59.680]  globalist order that funded the French Revolution, that funded the second round of that at the
[14:59.680 --> 15:06.560]  World War I in Russia, it's in mainline history books that the modern left comes from the
[15:06.560 --> 15:13.240]  French Revolution which was a group of Satanist Illuminati, that's in mainline history, people
[15:13.240 --> 15:18.080]  think I just get up here and say 25 years ago they're growing animal human monkey clones
[15:18.080 --> 15:23.600]  and pig clones and cow clones so they can implant them in the uteruses of monkeys, pigs
[15:23.600 --> 15:29.520]  and cows, a monkey will reject a clone unless it's part of it, a cow will reject the clone
[15:29.520 --> 15:33.280]  unless it's part of it, so you put enough cow genes in a humanoid, it still looks like
[15:33.280 --> 15:37.040]  a person but it will grow in a cow now and you can then harvest its organs, it's been
[15:37.040 --> 15:42.080]  going on for 50 years, I learned about it 25 years ago, just like I'm telling you about
[15:42.080 --> 15:46.920]  the Illuminati and these devil worshipers, everything I'm telling you is as real as
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.760]  it gets and now it's all out in the open because they're getting ready to roll it out publicly
[15:52.760 --> 15:57.400]  and declare these clones have rights, that's the whole transgender things about, you'll
[15:57.400 --> 16:00.200]  accept a man being a woman, you'll accept anything, hey everybody.
[16:00.200 --> 16:08.360]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association
[16:08.360 --> 16:13.000]  and they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.600]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering, that's why they've been massively
[16:17.600 --> 16:22.200]  expanding their services, so whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want
[16:22.200 --> 16:26.800]  help building a website or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all
[16:26.800 --> 16:32.720]  and they're expanding and if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their
[16:32.720 --> 16:39.320]  services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move
[16:39.320 --> 16:44.120]  goes to fund the info war and then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type
[16:44.120 --> 16:49.160]  of services that you get from them so it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet
[16:49.160 --> 16:55.800]  again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free, so infowarsdomains.com
[16:55.800 --> 17:00.800]  the revolution starts there, infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[17:00.800 --> 17:06.320]  Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have it in stock in our warehouse in Austin,
[17:06.320 --> 17:10.560]  Texas, every product, so if you order it, you've got it shipped out in a couple of days,
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.000]  sometimes the same day, let's just get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.360]  the supply chain's breaking down and it's future orders, it's product we're trying
[17:20.360 --> 17:25.840]  to reorder to get back in that we're having trouble with, I mean I'm talking about double,
[17:25.840 --> 17:30.960]  triple, quadruple delivery times and it's across, not just the supplement, vitamin,
[17:30.960 --> 17:36.120]  mineral industry, it's across every industry so the globalists have successfully devastated
[17:36.120 --> 17:41.320]  the economy, that's why I'm saying you need to visit infowarsdomains.com today and get
[17:41.320 --> 17:46.080]  high quality supplements while you still can and storeable food at infowarsdomains.com
[17:46.080 --> 17:50.440]  because we have it in stock, it's ready to ship but with the supply chain breakdowns,
[17:50.440 --> 17:55.640]  prices are going up, availability is going down and it's just crazy, so please get products
[17:55.640 --> 18:21.640]  while you still can and support the infowars, infowarsstore.com.
[18:21.640 --> 18:33.640]  What's your location?
[18:33.640 --> 18:41.120]  The White S.U.V. just took off Westbrook on Broadway from Penn, our guard is defenseless
[18:41.120 --> 18:46.120]  at that intersection, we're trying to catch up with it.
[18:46.120 --> 18:53.800]  Minneapolis squads, Westbrook and Penn, officer needs help, they were just shot at by a White
[18:53.800 --> 18:54.800]  S.U.V.
[18:54.800 --> 18:55.800]  I think we're going.
[18:55.800 --> 19:11.240]  Copy, apparently there's a security guard at that intersection that's left unattended
[19:11.240 --> 19:17.800]  by the police officers, the whole video, full audio is at infowars.com where they're going
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.520]  to learn that they shot at and almost hit police officers and national guard guarding
[19:22.520 --> 19:28.000]  a neighborhood because people are trying to burn the neighborhoods down if any White people
[19:28.000 --> 19:34.880]  live in them, carjackings are up 300% now in those areas of Minneapolis, it is racially
[19:34.880 --> 19:38.920]  motivated, it is the media saying that White people are inherently evil, you can turn on
[19:38.920 --> 19:46.000]  any MSNBC, CNN, PBS, any college training, corporate training, Coca-Cola says, Whites
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.400]  are inherently bad and these are big ruthless mega corporations that don't pay taxes in
[19:52.400 --> 19:56.840]  the U.S. basically and are totally ripping us all off using divide and conquer on us
[19:56.840 --> 20:03.880]  to distract us while they do this to us and you've got Mad Maxine who has stolen tens
[20:03.880 --> 20:08.720]  of millions of dollars to her and her husband with their bank and you've got her involved
[20:08.720 --> 20:13.200]  with all this corruption above the law, race baiting for decades when she doesn't even
[20:13.200 --> 20:19.040]  live in her own black district and she's told to do this by the social engineers, they're
[20:19.040 --> 20:29.360]  following a script and she's out there wearing the face mask and wearing the COVID burka,
[20:29.360 --> 20:34.000]  virtue signaling to all the crap to tell black people it's all have a big street party and
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.600]  come out here and talk about how bad the police are but in almost every case whether it's
[20:38.600 --> 20:42.760]  George Floyd or this latest case in Georgia where the two black cops shoot the crazy black
[20:42.760 --> 20:46.560]  guy with a knife and the media even asked the question, well maybe these black cops
[20:46.560 --> 20:47.960]  should be indicted.
[20:47.960 --> 20:54.240]  Somebody calls about a guy running around outside waving a butcher knife, it's black
[20:54.240 --> 21:00.080]  people that call, it's black people that live in the house, he runs at them with a knife,
[21:00.080 --> 21:04.160]  tries to stab them, runs in the house, they've got a check and see make sure nobody else
[21:04.160 --> 21:09.360]  is in there, they begging 40 something times and he tries to kill them and they kill him
[21:09.360 --> 21:14.440]  and the media is like well maybe it's racist.
[21:14.440 --> 21:23.680]  The country is falling apart ladies and gentlemen, people are going crazy, it's absolutely insane.
[21:23.680 --> 21:29.640]  There's another video up on infowars.com where a young white woman on drugs, she's like 18
[21:29.640 --> 21:33.400]  years old ran off with her boyfriend from Omaha, Nebraska to Florida, they were involved
[21:33.400 --> 21:38.600]  in a bunch of crime sprees stealing money for drugs, cops got called on them, they're
[21:38.600 --> 21:43.680]  running from the cops, they start shooting at the cops, cops kill her, the dad invites
[21:43.680 --> 21:47.920]  the police to the funeral and says I know it was horrible having to shoot her and the
[21:47.920 --> 21:52.000]  police broke down and cried and said yes it's terrible, we hated it but of course he's
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.720]  white, his dead daughter's white and nobody's happy that she's dead, nobody's happy that
[21:56.720 --> 22:02.400]  the black man out of his mind on drugs was killed in Georgia but that's what's happening
[22:02.400 --> 22:05.200]  in this society falling apart.
[22:05.200 --> 22:09.520]  When you've got crack heads whether they're black or white, running around crazy waving
[22:09.520 --> 22:16.000]  guns, people are going to start getting killed and when you've got total meth head, speed
[22:16.000 --> 22:25.720]  ball, fentanyl addicts, running around crazy, you're going to end up having a disaster and
[22:25.720 --> 22:30.960]  the system knows and they want a big explosion in this country to then federalize the police
[22:30.960 --> 22:34.920]  so their political officers on the left, that's what Soros wants, they've done it in Europe,
[22:34.920 --> 22:37.840]  they've done it in Australia, they've done it in New Zealand, they've done it in Canada
[22:37.840 --> 22:42.160]  and in Canada we're going to play footage for you next segment that is bone shilling
[22:42.160 --> 22:47.600]  martial law, the craziest thing as my crew said they've ever seen, they're just announcing
[22:47.600 --> 22:50.080]  you're under martial law.
[22:50.080 --> 22:54.920]  So it is on, this is their pretext, this is their excuse, now they're saying it's a public
[22:54.920 --> 22:58.600]  health thing, we've got to take your guns too, this is not about liberties, it's about
[22:58.600 --> 23:04.440]  safety and COVID, you cannot leave your house, it's about bankrupting western economies
[23:04.440 --> 23:08.840]  to put you on a universal income to control you, they admit, they lied about COVID, it's
[23:08.840 --> 23:13.920]  numbers, the deaths, everything and until they start going to prison and until your government
[23:13.920 --> 23:18.880]  whether they be Australian or Canadian or British or German, stop following the UN model, it's
[23:18.880 --> 23:25.040]  only going to get worse, now here's Maxine Waters, just like with the bullshit revolution
[23:25.040 --> 23:30.160]  trying to stir the public up for riots nationwide to bring down the elected government, they've
[23:30.160 --> 23:33.100]  already brought down the elected government with election fraud, they've already got their
[23:33.100 --> 23:38.240]  puppet Biden in there, now they want to fully bring down the final institutions they don't
[23:38.240 --> 23:42.400]  control completely the police departments, so they will now be political and do whatever
[23:42.400 --> 23:43.400]  they're told, here it is.
[23:43.400 --> 23:55.720]  Yes, I would like to see the bill in Congress passed on police reform, but I know that the
[23:55.720 --> 23:58.720]  right wing, the racist are opposed to it and I don't know what's going to happen to it,
[23:58.720 --> 24:04.720]  but I know this, we've got to stay in the street and we've got to demand justice.
[24:04.720 --> 24:10.520]  That's a black man despite all of the efforts, I feel like nothing changes and George Floyd
[24:10.520 --> 24:17.080]  is waking so many people up, yet nothing has happened, despite the rhetoric, what needs
[24:17.080 --> 24:20.080]  to happen that's different this year than all the years before?
[24:20.080 --> 24:26.600]  We're looking for a guilty verdict, we're looking for a guilty verdict and we're looking
[24:26.600 --> 24:33.000]  to see if all of the fault that took place and has been taking place after they told
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.280]  what happened to George Floyd, if nothing does not happen then we know of that, we've
[24:39.280 --> 24:46.280]  got to not only stay in the street, but we've got to fight for justice, but I am very hopeful
[24:46.280 --> 24:54.120]  and I hope that we're going to get a verdict that says guilty, guilty, guilty and if we
[24:54.120 --> 24:56.600]  don't, we cannot go away.
[24:56.600 --> 24:57.600]  And not just manslaughter, right?
[24:57.600 --> 24:58.600]  I mean...
[24:58.600 --> 25:02.600]  Oh no, not manslaughter, no, no, no, this is guilty, this is guilty for murder.
[25:02.600 --> 25:06.400]  I don't know whether it's in the first degree, but as far as I'm concerned it's first degree
[25:06.400 --> 25:07.400]  here.
[25:07.400 --> 25:10.640]  What happens if we do not get what you just told, what should the people do, what should
[25:10.640 --> 25:11.640]  protesters do?
[25:11.640 --> 25:13.440]  I didn't hear you.
[25:13.440 --> 25:14.440]  What happens?
[25:14.440 --> 25:15.440]  What should protesters do?
[25:15.440 --> 25:21.240]  Well, we've got to stay on the street and we've got to get more active, we've got to
[25:21.240 --> 25:28.160]  get more confrontational, we've got to make sure that they know that we need justice.
[25:28.160 --> 25:33.000]  More confrontational, police stations shot up all over the country, cop shot, burning
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.880]  buildings, everything else, you notice she wants police reform, globalist federal control
[25:37.880 --> 25:43.840]  over police to do COVID lockdowns and to take your guns and they admit that's the model.
[25:43.840 --> 25:46.000]  That's the Soros model, it's all admitted.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.880]  We're going to go to break and come back and lay out so much more.
[25:49.880 --> 25:53.920]  There is just so much to get to, it makes my head spin.
[25:53.920 --> 25:59.120]  Separately, all T-shirts, all Info Wars T-shirts, don't spread the word and support the broadcast
[25:59.120 --> 26:06.440]  are 1776 on the big sale, but daily we're going to have a new shirt that's sold at cost.
[26:06.440 --> 26:10.520]  This is XXL, it costs like eight bucks or whatever, so smaller ones are cheaper, but
[26:10.520 --> 26:13.480]  it's at cost after all the shipping and all the rest of it.
[26:13.480 --> 26:19.240]  It's a wake up shirt, black on white, really simple, wake up on the front, infowars.com
[26:19.240 --> 26:26.800]  on the back, it's $9.95, it's the wakeupinfowars.com shirt at infowarsstore.com, we've also got
[26:26.800 --> 26:30.040]  mask free, because I'm allergic to tyranny.
[26:30.040 --> 26:35.440]  We are all essential shirt, F Biden, and we are all Alex Jones, this is a very popular
[26:35.440 --> 26:38.040]  shirt we brought back.
[26:38.040 --> 26:42.720]  It's all available at infowarsstore.com and this is the absolute last day I've extended
[26:42.720 --> 26:47.360]  it one day to get Vital Immuneral Fusion for 40% off all the vitamins, all the minerals,
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.120]  the amino acids in one powder form, so it's liquefied, so you absorb it more.
[26:52.120 --> 26:59.920]  First day, Vital Immuneral Fusion, 40% off, stay with us, we'll be right back.
[26:59.920 --> 27:07.800]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden, and now that all the
[27:07.800 --> 27:11.920]  lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[27:11.920 --> 27:19.400]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing, they will do whatever they are told, as if
[27:19.400 --> 27:27.120]  obedience is a virtue, it is the patriot of the world versus everybody else.
[27:27.120 --> 27:33.840]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[27:33.840 --> 27:40.040]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance
[27:40.040 --> 27:46.480]  to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation for purpose
[27:46.480 --> 27:53.480]  of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can, so help
[27:53.480 --> 27:54.480]  me God.
[27:54.480 --> 27:57.480]  infowars.com, fans.video.
[27:57.480 --> 28:03.480]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[28:03.480 --> 28:04.480]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[28:04.480 --> 28:08.680]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason, and amongst all
[28:08.680 --> 28:09.680]  this stupidity.
[28:09.680 --> 28:13.080]  I wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[28:13.080 --> 28:19.800]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that will never go away.
[28:19.800 --> 28:21.280]  Living defense saved my life.
[28:21.280 --> 28:25.600]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[28:25.600 --> 28:27.040]  Living defense brought me back.
[28:27.040 --> 28:32.560]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[28:32.560 --> 28:39.760]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[28:39.760 --> 28:45.680]  you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be
[28:45.680 --> 28:49.760]  offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[28:49.760 --> 28:51.600]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[28:51.600 --> 28:56.040]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[28:56.040 --> 29:01.080]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[29:01.080 --> 29:03.880]  The equation is very simple.
[29:03.880 --> 29:10.440]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control
[29:10.440 --> 29:15.920]  the military, industrial complex, they control big tech, and everywhere that they have been
[29:15.920 --> 29:23.680]  in control in the third world, the hipster, was absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[29:23.680 --> 29:29.280]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[29:29.280 --> 29:32.200]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[29:32.200 --> 29:37.760]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside
[29:37.760 --> 29:45.160]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[29:45.160 --> 29:48.000]  that threatens their monopoly of control.
[29:48.000 --> 29:52.160]  That's why they target info wars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[29:52.160 --> 29:57.760]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[29:57.760 --> 29:58.760]  So redouble your efforts.
[29:58.760 --> 30:00.760]  We're all in this together.
[30:00.760 --> 30:05.520]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[30:05.520 --> 30:07.240]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[30:07.240 --> 30:09.600]  Really they're a super computer that's handheld.
[30:09.600 --> 30:14.040]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS
[30:14.040 --> 30:20.600]  especially are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets
[30:20.600 --> 30:24.400]  when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict
[30:24.400 --> 30:27.920]  on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[30:27.920 --> 30:34.400]  Bringing them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[30:34.400 --> 30:35.800]  In their own words, they admit it.
[30:35.800 --> 30:39.760]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than
[30:39.760 --> 30:40.760]  a decade.
[30:40.760 --> 30:44.280]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[30:44.280 --> 30:47.120]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great.
[30:47.120 --> 30:52.480]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[30:52.480 --> 30:55.640]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because
[30:55.640 --> 30:56.640]  it's not their business.
[30:56.640 --> 31:04.040]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[31:04.040 --> 31:30.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:30.400 --> 31:46.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones broadcast, and I forgot to tell you, James O'Keefe's
[31:46.880 --> 31:52.680]  scheduled to be with us in studio the whole next hour with some big breaking news right
[31:52.680 --> 31:56.360]  here in the ATX.
[31:56.360 --> 32:00.360]  Well there's the name of the special broadcast today, Emergency Monday broadcast, Democrats
[32:00.360 --> 32:07.600]  slash Deep State announced plan to burn down the United States using the Bolshevik Revolution
[32:07.600 --> 32:14.920]  model, the Globalist and the Democratic Hollywood slash Chai Comm minions have launched their
[32:14.920 --> 32:18.520]  final assault on our embattled Republic.
[32:18.520 --> 32:27.360]  So again, using the Revolution model, the Globalist, their Democrat Hollywood and Chai
[32:27.360 --> 32:34.080]  Comm minions have launched their final assault on our embattled Republic.
[32:34.080 --> 32:37.880]  But being aware of it and resisting it will stop it, ladies and gentlemen, but you've
[32:37.880 --> 32:42.880]  got to admit how much trouble you're in.
[32:42.880 --> 32:48.280]  I found the name of that show I was watching about Stalin the other night.
[32:48.280 --> 32:50.360]  I'd forgotten the name, but the crew was able to find it.
[32:50.360 --> 32:56.400]  It's Apocalypse Stalin 2016, a three-part series.
[32:56.400 --> 33:01.960]  And if you watch that and you compare it to what's happening today, it's the exact Democrat
[33:01.960 --> 33:08.160]  blueprint, which they admit it's a Bolshevik model, mixed in with the Maoist model.
[33:08.160 --> 33:16.160]  But it is just so important to watch that 7.8 stars on IMDB.
[33:16.160 --> 33:21.080]  And the three real factions in World War II are exposed, they even admit the three factions.
[33:21.080 --> 33:23.880]  So you have to do a lot of research to get into that level of information, this is much
[33:23.880 --> 33:27.000]  better than most of the things you see on mainline TV.
[33:27.000 --> 33:30.800]  And the colorization of the footage is just stunning.
[33:30.800 --> 33:35.680]  I don't own a position in the movie, I just watched part of it and thought it was very
[33:35.680 --> 33:38.760]  accurate.
[33:38.760 --> 33:41.600]  History repeats itself, folks, you better learn about it right now.
[33:41.600 --> 33:49.400]  Speaking of double-think and double-speak, when Maxine Waters says arrest anybody that
[33:49.400 --> 33:53.480]  even walked into the Capitol peacefully, waved him by police, throw away the key, but she
[33:53.480 --> 33:58.320]  says get more aggressive, attack more than what we've already seen out in the middle
[33:58.320 --> 34:03.720]  of a crowd and then the military gets shot at just hours later in the same town.
[34:03.720 --> 34:08.040]  Police station has been shot up, people have been killed, I mean it's a massive carjacking
[34:08.040 --> 34:10.840]  of white people, this is what they've triggered.
[34:10.840 --> 34:15.640]  Meanwhile, we're going to play this clip coming up, YouTube CEO wins free expression
[34:15.640 --> 34:25.000]  award sponsored by YouTube, then boasts how platform censors users, oh we don't censor
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.960]  just anything we don't like, we hide, but we don't take anything down when everyone
[34:29.960 --> 34:36.680]  knows they take basically anything and everything down including congressmen's congressional
[34:36.680 --> 34:42.040]  reports, Senate and House hearings, Governor DeSantis is a round table with scientists
[34:42.040 --> 34:48.160]  in the state house in a live committee hearing and they point out that COVID was 9999 times
[34:48.160 --> 34:55.680]  weaker than what they said, they say that's not the law, that's not the UN.
[34:55.680 --> 35:01.960]  Just like that, we're totally under UN surveillance, that's what Big Tech's doing and UN censorship.
[35:01.960 --> 35:09.600]  And then another incredible video of where now at strip bars where they have drag queen
[35:09.600 --> 35:14.600]  events, they're bringing children up on stage to be cheered at and hollered at sexually
[35:14.600 --> 35:17.800]  by a bunch of men.
[35:17.800 --> 35:21.120]  This is just incredible, you know what the boys always say to the girls, you can't ever
[35:21.120 --> 35:25.120]  beat us, you're not going to have your own swimming, your own basketball, your own football,
[35:25.120 --> 35:32.720]  your own track, your own wrestling, your own everything, I'll just put a wig on sweetheart.
[35:32.720 --> 35:38.560]  In fact, I think I'm going to join the UFC and I think I might end up being the top woman
[35:38.560 --> 35:41.800]  because I've watched them fight, I think I can take even their best women, not the guys,
[35:41.800 --> 35:45.200]  my god they kicked my ass about 10 seconds, but the girls, I've watched some of their
[35:45.200 --> 35:50.400]  top people, I can beat their ass, well guess what, I'm going to have a potbelly, beard,
[35:50.400 --> 35:51.400]  everything.
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.520]  Haha, I'm a woman, I am the UFC champion.
[35:55.520 --> 36:01.520]  Woo, we can laugh about this but I'm telling you, I wonder if Dana White, I've met Dana
[36:01.520 --> 36:07.840]  White a few times, you know, I wonder if Dana will let me, like, I'm Caitlyn Jenner, I'm
[36:07.840 --> 36:12.880]  stunning and brave, so that's coming up next segment but let's get serious here with the
[36:12.880 --> 36:19.720]  incredible news that we've got for you.
[36:19.720 --> 36:25.480]  This is a clip, this is what's being broadcasted, what's being put out in Ontario, Canada is
[36:25.480 --> 36:29.080]  now officially a police state, here it is.
[36:29.080 --> 36:35.200]  We have implemented the strictest measures in all of North America and the difficult
[36:35.200 --> 36:43.520]  truth is, every public health measure we have left comes with a massive cost to people
[36:43.520 --> 36:46.200]  and their lives.
[36:46.200 --> 36:49.560]  But we have never shied away from doing what's necessary.
[36:49.560 --> 36:54.880]  We have made the deliberate decision to temporarily enhance police officers authority for the
[36:54.880 --> 36:57.680]  duration of the stay at home order.
[36:57.680 --> 37:03.000]  Moving forward, police will have the authority to require any individual who is not in a
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.160]  place of residence to first provide their purpose for not being at home and provide
[37:09.160 --> 37:11.240]  their home address.
[37:11.240 --> 37:16.040]  Police will also have the authority to stop a vehicle, to inquire about an individual's
[37:16.040 --> 37:18.720]  reason for leaving their residence.
[37:18.720 --> 37:23.280]  And our inspectors will also be ensuring that those who absolutely must come to work
[37:23.280 --> 37:27.000]  are strictly following the public health measures.
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.440]  For our employers and employees, take note, this is your last warning.
[37:32.440 --> 37:37.120]  I'm wondering about these new police powers to just randomly stop someone walking down
[37:37.120 --> 37:39.440]  the street or to pull over a car.
[37:39.440 --> 37:45.360]  What happens if a person refuses to answer the police questions?
[37:45.360 --> 37:51.480]  So by issuing these new additional enforcement measures, it allows police officers to ask
[37:51.480 --> 37:56.320]  the person why they are not at their place of residence and what their place of residence
[37:56.320 --> 37:57.320]  is.
[37:57.320 --> 38:03.320]  Specifically to your question, if you are not willing to comply, then you are breaking
[38:03.320 --> 38:04.320]  the law.
[38:04.320 --> 38:12.080]  If someone sees their neighbors breaking these new regulations and having a party in their
[38:12.080 --> 38:16.440]  yard, that sort of thing, should people call police on their neighbors?
[38:16.440 --> 38:26.040]  In terms of people calling to snitch, to inform, look, we all have a personal responsibility.
[38:26.040 --> 38:31.880]  If it means saving lives, then I think we have to think about what your social responsibilities
[38:31.880 --> 38:38.640]  are as an individual to make sure that you don't empower other people and invite a whole
[38:38.640 --> 38:40.800]  bunch of individuals to your home.
[38:40.800 --> 38:44.880]  So this is permanent martial law, all based on a lie, almost all the death numbers are
[38:44.880 --> 38:45.880]  fake.
[38:45.880 --> 38:46.880]  Everybody knows that now.
[38:46.880 --> 38:48.480]  This is the UN takeover.
[38:48.480 --> 38:53.880]  Remember Toronto's crack mayor who died, his brother Doug Ford has been elected Ontario
[38:53.880 --> 38:54.880]  Premier.
[38:54.880 --> 38:59.600]  So I'm not saying he's a pedophile, but I mean, would you let your kids be babysit
[38:59.600 --> 39:00.600]  by him?
[39:00.600 --> 39:01.600]  I mean, we put him back on screen.
[39:01.600 --> 39:04.600]  I mean, he just looks like a disingenuous sack of garbage.
[39:04.600 --> 39:10.320]  But hey, we don't know if he's a pedophile, we just know he looks like somebody totally
[39:10.320 --> 39:11.320]  controlled by evil.
[39:11.320 --> 39:13.520]  He looks like a minion, a controlled man.
[39:13.520 --> 39:18.960]  And if you believe they really elected him, think again, I mean, look at that monster.
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.120]  Putting you under permanent martial law, it's never going to end, their internal documents
[39:24.120 --> 39:25.120]  show it.
[39:25.120 --> 39:26.120]  It's all a fraud.
[39:26.120 --> 39:28.040]  They go, oh, people in Canada love the martial law.
[39:28.040 --> 39:29.920]  Oh, they love it in England.
[39:29.920 --> 39:30.920]  Those are fake polls.
[39:30.920 --> 39:33.440]  Their internal polls show it's wildly unpopular.
[39:33.440 --> 39:40.320]  We have footage coming up of giant crowds just surging, massively surging, Herod's
[39:40.320 --> 39:44.280]  department store in London.
[39:44.280 --> 39:48.800]  Now the police themselves all over Canada are saying, we're not busting churches.
[39:48.800 --> 39:50.440]  We're not going and doing this anymore.
[39:50.440 --> 39:51.640]  You're killing the country.
[39:51.640 --> 39:54.000]  They don't have family going bankrupt.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  What are we going to say?
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  No.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  And you notice, if you're a radio listener, you couldn't see it, you're lucky because
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  these are some ugly-looking people.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.800]  And I mean, just don't, by ugly, I mean, just demonic little monsters.
[40:02.800 --> 40:05.400]  They know they're criminals.
[40:05.400 --> 40:08.360]  They just, every time they speak to put the mask back on, when they don't speak, they
[40:08.360 --> 40:09.360]  take it back off.
[40:09.360 --> 40:10.360]  It's all this theater.
[40:10.360 --> 40:14.440]  We have the footage of the Justice Department official off camera, doesn't have a mask on,
[40:14.440 --> 40:19.760]  puts it on to go on camera, takes it off when he leaves camera, YouTube and Twitter is taking
[40:19.760 --> 40:20.760]  that video now.
[40:20.760 --> 40:28.240]  And then we also have the footage of one of the state reps there in Pennsylvania on the
[40:28.240 --> 40:29.240]  stage with the governor.
[40:29.240 --> 40:34.320]  And the governor says off the stage to her, listen, put your mask on when you go on stage.
[40:34.320 --> 40:36.080]  It's part of the theater.
[40:36.080 --> 40:37.560]  It's for public consumption.
[40:37.560 --> 40:42.960]  There are a bunch of scamming bureaucrats robbing you on the payroll of foreign banks.
[40:42.960 --> 40:45.480]  It's all a giant chicken little Psyop.
[40:45.480 --> 40:46.480]  Period.
[40:46.480 --> 40:52.120]  We need to start pushing back now or it's never going to end, we'll be like Canada and
[40:52.120 --> 40:55.280]  Australia and the UK, they'll never let us off the leash.
[40:55.280 --> 40:56.280]  Hold it right back.
[40:56.280 --> 40:57.280]  Stay with us.
[40:57.280 --> 41:03.480]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful

[41:59.040 --> 42:00.040]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[42:00.040 --> 42:01.040]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[42:01.040 --> 42:02.040]  I'm trying to move quicker.
[42:02.040 --> 42:03.040]  Hey Alex.
[42:03.040 --> 42:04.040]  Welcome.
[42:04.040 --> 42:07.600]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this
[42:07.600 --> 42:08.600]  stupidity.
[42:08.600 --> 42:11.800]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[42:11.800 --> 42:18.560]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[42:18.560 --> 42:20.040]  Living defense saved my life.
[42:20.040 --> 42:24.360]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[42:24.360 --> 42:25.800]  Living defense brought me back.
[42:25.800 --> 42:31.520]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[42:31.520 --> 42:38.320]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[42:38.320 --> 42:43.240]  kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[42:43.240 --> 42:48.600]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[42:48.600 --> 42:50.360]  That's right where we're at brother.
[42:50.360 --> 42:54.800]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[42:54.800 --> 43:00.280]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[43:00.280 --> 43:03.840]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also an old person.
[43:03.840 --> 43:08.120]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity, of all the terrible things
[43:08.120 --> 43:13.640]  that are unfolding, I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[43:13.640 --> 43:17.120]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[43:17.120 --> 43:22.840]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood
[43:22.840 --> 43:29.520]  or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[43:29.520 --> 43:32.480]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared.
[43:32.480 --> 43:33.640]  They're looking for leadership.
[43:33.640 --> 43:36.280]  Well, that's where info comes in.
[43:36.280 --> 43:37.280]  You fund us.
[43:37.280 --> 43:38.280]  You support m4store.com.
[43:38.280 --> 43:40.600]  You get great policy at the same time.
[43:40.600 --> 43:45.600]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target
[43:45.600 --> 43:50.400]  you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[43:50.400 --> 43:51.400]  That's our job.
[43:51.400 --> 43:56.760]  So please keep us on air so we can hit the bar wire so we can be the shock groups in
[43:56.760 --> 43:57.760]  the information war.
[43:57.760 --> 44:00.560]  Fund us at m4store.com.
[44:00.560 --> 44:04.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.200]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[44:08.200 --> 44:11.400]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[44:11.400 --> 44:14.480]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[44:14.480 --> 44:15.800]  can to shut us down.
[44:15.800 --> 44:20.120]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're
[44:20.120 --> 44:21.120]  listening to as well.
[44:21.120 --> 44:27.240]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[44:27.240 --> 44:32.120]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[44:32.120 --> 44:33.600]  in the face of this thing.
[44:33.600 --> 44:35.720]  I need your help more than ever now.
[44:35.720 --> 44:40.040]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[44:40.040 --> 44:45.040]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy
[44:45.040 --> 44:50.200]  great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.

[44:55.200 --> 45:00.160]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[45:00.160 --> 45:03.560]  Thank you so much.
[45:03.560 --> 45:10.560]  Please support listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:33.560 --> 45:59.560]  Let me get back to the crackhead mayor's brother who looks just like the brother, Doug Ford
[45:59.560 --> 46:05.440]  has been elected Ontario premier and he looks like Sylvester when he just got caught eating
[46:05.440 --> 46:06.440]  tweedie bird.
[46:06.440 --> 46:11.520]  I mean, he looks like the most guilty, lying, just disingenuous sack of garbage.
[46:11.520 --> 46:12.520]  I mean, look at him.
[46:12.520 --> 46:14.520]  It's like a giant demonic ferret.
[46:14.520 --> 46:18.160]  It's like an evil hedgehog that just ate your freedoms.
[46:18.160 --> 46:19.160]  Well, guess what?
[46:19.160 --> 46:22.400]  He just declared martial law and we played the clip earlier.
[46:22.400 --> 46:25.560]  Why do they all look like cartoon characters?
[46:25.560 --> 46:32.080]  He looks like Brian Stelter's alter ego or something.
[46:32.080 --> 46:37.440]  Brother of notorious Rob Ford takes over Ontario and declares martial law.
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.240]  Every blue city will never end the lockdown, will never stop the power.
[46:42.240 --> 46:45.120]  It's always about more, more, more, more power.
[46:45.120 --> 46:46.960]  They want power over you.
[46:46.960 --> 46:52.200]  Speaking of that, here's Fauci suggests masks were effective than COVID vaccine.
[46:52.200 --> 46:58.160]  Even though he said mask a year ago or no good, says vaccinated people can still inadvertently
[46:58.160 --> 46:59.160]  infect.
[46:59.160 --> 47:01.520]  But all the studies show this mask don't stop viruses.
[47:01.520 --> 47:02.520]  But it doesn't matter.
[47:02.520 --> 47:03.960]  He later said, well, it makes you feel good.
[47:03.960 --> 47:09.600]  It shows respect for those that have died, that he cares so much about all the people
[47:09.600 --> 47:13.880]  that had heart attacks and cancer and diabetes and were 85 years old that didn't die of it.
[47:13.880 --> 47:18.160]  He's not too worried about all those that died.
[47:18.160 --> 47:19.560]  Sent to the nursing homes infected.
[47:19.560 --> 47:22.280]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[47:22.280 --> 47:23.840]  A true mad scientist monster.
[47:23.840 --> 47:31.520]  Well, here's Fauci talking about how you need the mask, not the vaccine.
[47:31.520 --> 47:36.320]  I don't think Americans, liberties have been threatened the last year, Dr. Fauci.
[47:36.320 --> 47:37.440]  They've been assaulted.
[47:37.440 --> 47:39.360]  Their liberties have.
[47:39.360 --> 47:42.560]  I don't look at this as a liberty thing, Congressman Jordan.
[47:42.560 --> 47:46.240]  Well, that's obvious as a public health thing.
[47:46.240 --> 47:51.680]  So hearing comments like these have real sway with some people out there.
[47:51.680 --> 47:56.880]  New poll this week shows that 43% of Republicans still don't want to get the vaccine.
[47:56.880 --> 48:01.720]  How frustrating is this for you, Dr. Fauci?
[48:01.720 --> 48:08.400]  You know, Dana, it is quite frustrating because the fact that one may not want to get vaccinated,
[48:08.400 --> 48:15.080]  in this case, a disturbingly large proportion of Republicans only actually works against
[48:15.080 --> 48:16.800]  where they want to be.
[48:16.800 --> 48:22.120]  They want to be able to say these restrictions that are put on by public health recommendations
[48:22.120 --> 48:24.160]  are things that they're very concerned about.
[48:24.160 --> 48:25.880]  We're all concerned about that.
[48:25.880 --> 48:27.640]  We share that concern.
[48:27.640 --> 48:33.560]  But the way you get rid of those restrictions is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly
[48:33.560 --> 48:38.960]  and as expeditiously as possible because when that happens, for absolutely certain, you're
[48:38.960 --> 48:44.520]  going to see the level of virus in the community go down and down and down to the point where
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.080]  you would not have to have those public health restrictions.
[48:48.080 --> 48:49.080]  So that's enough.
[48:49.080 --> 48:50.080]  That's enough again.
[48:50.080 --> 48:51.080]  Please save him off my screen.
[48:51.080 --> 48:52.080]  That's how the trap works.
[48:52.080 --> 48:53.320]  Everything he told you has been a lie.
[48:53.320 --> 48:55.040]  The numbers he told you were total lies.
[48:55.040 --> 48:57.200]  The death numbers, who really died of it lies.
[48:57.200 --> 48:58.200]  The PCR test lies.
[48:58.200 --> 49:02.680]  And then he tells you some magical, mythical day out there.
[49:02.680 --> 49:04.320]  Vaccines don't help now.
[49:04.320 --> 49:05.600]  They were 100% before.
[49:05.600 --> 49:06.600]  The mask will save.
[49:06.600 --> 49:10.360]  You know, it's a symbol of fear, a symbol of their dominance, a symbol of their oppression
[49:10.360 --> 49:12.160]  like Islam over women.
[49:12.160 --> 49:15.360]  But now we all wear the burkish.
[49:15.360 --> 49:16.720]  Our faces are all unclean.
[49:16.720 --> 49:18.320]  Our faces are all evil.
[49:18.320 --> 49:19.320]  We're bad.
[49:19.320 --> 49:23.880]  Only Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the UN can save us with their deadly poison vaccines
[49:23.880 --> 49:27.880]  where they waved the trials because in secret trials, it killed almost all the animals.
[49:27.880 --> 49:29.520]  In the ferret trials, all the animals.
[49:29.520 --> 49:34.040]  And you see the giant death and giant disease, but oh, YouTube and Facebook will censor you
[49:34.040 --> 49:36.000]  because the UN didn't say so.
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.600]  It doesn't matter how many universities, how many scientists, how many top experts.
[49:40.600 --> 49:44.080]  They don't have speech either.
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.640]  Because after all, I was going to play a clip of him talking about guns are public safety.
[49:49.640 --> 49:50.640]  They're public health.
[49:50.640 --> 49:52.240]  You know, this isn't about your rights to guns.
[49:52.240 --> 49:57.080]  It's about people having a right not to be shot by guns and then it's, oh, cars kill
[49:57.080 --> 49:58.080]  people.
[49:58.080 --> 50:00.120]  We need everybody to be robot driven because they're quote saver.
[50:00.120 --> 50:03.280]  This is a logical extension of all of this, making us obsolete.
[50:03.280 --> 50:06.200]  It's been there playing the whole time with the nanny state.
[50:06.200 --> 50:11.200]  Oh, but when their drugs or their chemicals kill us, then it's censored.
[50:11.200 --> 50:15.400]  But oh, if somebody dies of a shooting, even though it may be it's one, one hundredth
[50:15.400 --> 50:21.640]  die of shootings by a die of bad drug overdoses every year or bad medicine every year, seriously,
[50:21.640 --> 50:24.640]  way overshadows it.
[50:24.640 --> 50:25.640]  Medical malpractice.
[50:25.640 --> 50:26.640]  Oh, you don't hear about that.
[50:26.640 --> 50:27.640]  That's all kept quiet.
[50:27.640 --> 50:37.160]  One of the big corporations doing it, but when it's when it's gone, oh, it's totally
[50:37.160 --> 50:42.240]  hyped up or when it's a cop that might have shot somebody in a wrong position, oh, well,
[50:42.240 --> 50:43.240]  then it's racial.
[50:43.240 --> 50:44.240]  Then it's the end of the country.
[50:44.240 --> 50:47.640]  Then that one life matters so much, we're going to hear about it forever and ever and
[50:47.640 --> 50:48.640]  ever.
[50:48.640 --> 50:51.000]  So we can give George Soros control over all the police departments.
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  Incredible.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.540]  So let's before we play the gun clip, let's play the YouTube CEO, the one that bragged
[50:55.540 --> 50:59.080]  about taking me off the internet because she didn't like her son listening to me.
[50:59.080 --> 51:05.080]  The YouTube CEO in a perfect double speak statement says, oh, I'm getting an award for free speech
[51:05.080 --> 51:07.760]  and free expression, but we don't censor.
[51:07.760 --> 51:09.520]  We just hide stuff we don't like.
[51:09.520 --> 51:10.680]  Well, you do more than that.
[51:10.680 --> 51:11.680]  You ban it.
[51:11.680 --> 51:12.680]  You take it down.
[51:12.680 --> 51:13.680]  You demonetize it.
[51:13.680 --> 51:19.200]  You bully people in mass, but here you are the big liberal who gets awards.
[51:19.200 --> 51:21.440]  It's like giving Barack Obama a peace prize.
[51:21.440 --> 51:26.960]  We never even been involved in any type of war planning or stopping wars as an executive.
[51:26.960 --> 51:30.520]  And then he launches all the wars and they talk about giving him another peace prize.
[51:30.520 --> 51:34.080]  I mean, these people are immoral jokes.
[51:34.080 --> 51:37.120]  They're empty scum and they will bring us down.
[51:37.120 --> 51:44.120]  So here's Susan Wojcinski, the CEO of Google video platform YouTube, was awarded the Freedom
[51:44.120 --> 51:47.280]  Forum Institute's Freedom of Expression Award.
[51:47.280 --> 51:52.240]  Well, maybe the ADL should give Hitler an award on Friday in a ceremony sponsored by
[51:52.240 --> 51:55.600]  her company despite YouTube's track record of censorship.
[51:55.600 --> 52:02.480]  Yeah, that's like in Foxcatcher, it's an excellent film, very accurate about DuPont.
[52:02.480 --> 52:08.000]  He would have wrestling matches sponsored by him and then they'd have a wrestling match
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.840]  where he would win the wrestling match so he would get an award.
[52:11.840 --> 52:14.320]  That's not a real award, DuPont.
[52:14.320 --> 52:17.240]  And having YouTube give you an award, lady, it's not an award.
[52:17.240 --> 52:23.760]  You're a joke, you're a fraud, you're a tyrant, you're a danger and you help cover up for
[52:23.760 --> 52:28.120]  communist China's mass murder and it's on your filthy hands, woman, but they use women
[52:28.120 --> 52:32.120]  now as the corporate fronts for everything.
[52:32.120 --> 52:36.280]  And they do it over and over and over again, like, you know, Mel Gibson now is going to
[52:36.280 --> 52:39.320]  make new movies, but it's not going to be his name on it.
[52:39.320 --> 52:42.640]  It's going to be his new wife's name on it.
[52:42.640 --> 52:45.800]  He said that he goes, well, women now, you know, are all the directors of producers
[52:45.800 --> 52:50.160]  now, so I'll just have her put her name on it.
[52:50.160 --> 52:51.160]  That's what you do now.
[52:51.160 --> 52:54.400]  It doesn't mean there aren't good female directors or producers.
[52:54.400 --> 52:56.800]  It's just that this is all a joke.
[52:56.800 --> 53:01.680]  It's all rich, ultra rich men using women and black people as their front while they engage
[53:01.680 --> 53:02.680]  in all this tyranny.
[53:02.680 --> 53:06.400]  I'm not saying Mel Gibson's engaged in tyranny, she's using him as an example.
[53:06.400 --> 53:10.640]  So here's Susan telling one whopper of a joke.
[53:10.640 --> 53:17.680]  And so I've just seen the real benefits that freedom of speech has as well as representing
[53:17.680 --> 53:22.480]  all people of all different backgrounds and all different perspectives, and that the freedoms
[53:22.480 --> 53:26.960]  we have, we really can't take for granted that we really have to make sure that we're
[53:26.960 --> 53:29.640]  protecting them in every way possible.
[53:29.640 --> 53:35.480]  And I feel because of my family history, a deep connection to those freedoms, and I'm
[53:35.480 --> 53:40.840]  very thankful for the freedoms that I have.
[53:40.840 --> 53:43.760]  Absolutely, as we all should be.
[53:43.760 --> 53:48.800]  Now when I started on YouTube, all I really wanted to do was just be authentic and share
[53:48.800 --> 53:49.800]  my story.
[53:49.800 --> 53:56.280]  But of course, as I've grown, there's been more pressure to speak for others in my community.
[53:56.280 --> 53:58.960]  And with that becomes a lot of responsibility.
[53:58.960 --> 54:04.400]  And I know at YouTube, you guys are always juggling responsibility at such a high level,
[54:04.400 --> 54:09.560]  always needing to try to balance people's right to free speech with protecting our community
[54:09.560 --> 54:11.520]  from content that can be harmful.
[54:11.520 --> 54:14.280]  So can you talk to us a little about that?
[54:14.280 --> 54:15.280]  Sure.
[54:15.280 --> 54:17.400]  Well, first of all, we want to...
[54:17.400 --> 54:18.400]  Sure.
[54:18.400 --> 54:23.040]  Taking speech away is how you protect people while we help keep the Uyghurs at death camps.
[54:23.040 --> 54:29.160]  Yes, we protect you from Alex Jones, and then we have Drag Queen Storytime, that's on InfoWars.com,
[54:29.160 --> 54:33.640]  with children at strip clubs now having men put money in their G-strings.
[54:33.640 --> 54:39.200]  Little boys dressed like girls with men whooping and hollering sexually.
[54:39.200 --> 54:42.120]  That is pedophilia.
[54:42.120 --> 54:47.040]  To sit there, I mean, imagine putting your child on the stage, little girl, little boy,
[54:47.040 --> 54:50.640]  and then men hoot and holler and beg.
[54:50.640 --> 54:52.080]  I'm going to play more of this coming up.
[54:52.080 --> 54:55.360]  James O'Keefe's a little bit late, office flight, he'll be with us coming into the next
[54:55.360 --> 54:56.360]  hour.
[54:56.360 --> 54:59.880]  I look forward to that and so much more, but I'll play you the latest outrageous behavior.
[54:59.880 --> 55:04.960]  Imagine going to a normal topless bar and there's little 12-year-old girls, 10-year-old
[55:04.960 --> 55:05.960]  girls on stage.
[55:05.960 --> 55:06.960]  You call the police.
[55:06.960 --> 55:10.280]  But, oh, little boys dressed like girls, they go, tough it up, boy.
[55:10.280 --> 55:11.280]  Woo!
[55:11.280 --> 55:12.760]  Guys, get your money out.
[55:12.760 --> 55:17.080]  We're bleeping this out right now because there's so much cussing and sexual stuff.
[55:17.080 --> 55:20.280]  But oh, yeah, shake your ass, little boys.
[55:20.280 --> 55:24.560]  Up there, you're little boys dressed like girls with a bunch of men in a strip bar.
[55:24.560 --> 55:25.560]  Yeah!
[55:25.560 --> 55:27.560]  Woo!
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.200]  We can't stay on air without your support, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:31.200 --> 55:32.200]  And we've got one more day.
[55:32.200 --> 55:34.440]  And this is the final day of vitamin mineral fusion.
[55:34.440 --> 55:38.200]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, all the amino acids for your immune system and more.
[55:38.200 --> 55:43.160]  And 40% off at infomerstore.com, there's a new big special up there as well, restocked
[55:43.160 --> 55:49.200]  and reloaded out of power and prostaguard back in stock.
[55:49.200 --> 55:54.600]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April, 2021, and I just want to say something.
[55:54.600 --> 55:58.960]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[55:58.960 --> 55:59.960]  the years.
[55:59.960 --> 56:03.640]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the
[56:03.640 --> 56:04.640]  listeners of this show.
[56:04.640 --> 56:07.280]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[56:07.280 --> 56:10.880]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got
[56:10.880 --> 56:11.880]  red blood.
[56:11.880 --> 56:16.760]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[56:16.760 --> 56:21.120]  and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you
[56:21.120 --> 56:22.120]  over the years.
[56:22.120 --> 56:25.560]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[56:25.560 --> 56:29.160]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[56:29.160 --> 56:34.160]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[56:34.160 --> 56:36.560]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[56:36.560 --> 56:40.120]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[56:40.120 --> 56:41.120]  done.
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.680]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and hopefully
[56:45.680 --> 56:48.040]  God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for us.
[56:48.040 --> 56:49.040]  God bless.
[56:49.040 --> 56:54.760]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[56:54.760 --> 56:59.280]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including
[56:59.280 --> 57:04.560]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune
[57:04.560 --> 57:05.560]  system.

[57:30.160 --> 57:35.400]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support

[57:53.600 --> 58:13.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:13.800 --> 58:31.560]  I'm going to give some time to the CEO of YouTube getting an award for free speech and
[58:31.560 --> 58:44.520]  now I'm going to put us under tyranny, is that what she's saying?
[58:44.520 --> 58:49.520]  We're going to be talking about that more James O'Keefe's on his way here right now,
[58:49.520 --> 58:51.040]  and we've got so much breaking news.
[58:51.040 --> 58:54.640]  We've got the drag queen story times taking place at strip clubs with little children
[58:54.640 --> 58:59.520]  basically under Stockholm syndrome, mind control, that's coming up, but I want to spend
[58:59.520 --> 59:04.720]  some time here talking to viewers and listeners about counting the cost.
[59:04.720 --> 59:09.280]  We're not bankrolled by George Soros, we're not bankrolled by the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers
[59:09.280 --> 59:16.160]  or Bill Gates, we're bankrolled by you, plus we sell products that get the word out and
[59:16.160 --> 59:21.800]  that make your life healthier, better, and wiser, and we've got a lot of specials we've
[59:21.800 --> 59:29.600]  launched over the years, but I tell you the most popular one we've had is vitamin mineral
[59:29.600 --> 59:36.000]  fusion discounted, and we're here again in the twilight of this big sale right now, not
[59:36.000 --> 59:42.080]  much time left because we're selling out of it, but it's still available at infowarstore.com,
[59:42.080 --> 59:45.760]  vitamin mineral fusion for 40% off, but let me tell you what else is available and we
[59:45.760 --> 59:49.760]  do have a good stock of, and that's just as important as vitamin mineral fusion, it's
[59:49.760 --> 59:56.200]  vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system, very strong, very organic, high end,
[59:56.200 --> 1:00:01.600]  winter sun, everybody needs it, old, young, but especially the old, especially if you
[1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:04.760]  have darker skin and aren't getting enough sun.
[1:00:04.760 --> 1:00:11.680]  Vitamin D3 is beyond critical, even Bill Maher is talking about it now, and it is 40% off
[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:17.160]  at infowarstore.com as well, but here's what's back in stock, alpha power is basically the
[1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:22.440]  dry version of supermail vitality, supermail vitality is excellent, it's cold pressed,
[1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:25.560]  it takes three to four times the herbs to do it, because it's cold pressed, they don't
[1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:31.600]  even boil it or cook it down, if the herbs out, it's like wine, it's never been heated.
[1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:36.200]  This is high end, high quality herbs, but it's powdered, so it's a much stronger dose,
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:39.480]  but again per capita not as strong, but it's apples and oranges.
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:45.040]  I have a stronger effect on it, and I lose weight on it, I get aggressive on it, I can't
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:49.440]  take it, it's so strong, but if I take it I lose 30, 40 pounds, I just can't do it.
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:53.000]  A lot of you can handle it, I can't handle it, because I've already got high testosterone
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:56.720]  for my age, most men don't, I've still got a healthy amount of testosterone, so I don't
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:01.600]  take it, but if you're having issues, I'd check it out, it is, alpha power, it's back
[1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:09.280]  in stock, 40% off at infowarstore.com, cross the guard, sells out all the time, because
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:14.000]  women know that salpal meadows good for their glands, not just for men's prostate, but it's
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.440]  proven to be excellent for the prostate, and then it's got a bunch of key vitamins, a bunch
[1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:22.600]  of key minerals in it, it's got all the trace things you need basically to boost your immune
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:27.440]  systems, let me tell you about some of the things that are in there, and again it's got
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:33.240]  the D3, it's got a whole bunch of stuff, so really what it is, is a multivitamin at the
[1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:41.000]  same time, with salpal meadow, it's all available at infowarstore.com for 40% off, and rocket
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:46.280]  rest, the amazing sleep aid, it's way stronger than knockout, which I take knockout while
[1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:51.000]  I eat it, because rocket rest is so strong, it's different strokes for different folks,
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:02:00.520]  but instead of having one gram or one milligram of melatonin, it's got four, and so everything
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:07.680]  that is basically in knockout, it's got even stronger, there are eight ingredients in knockout,
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:11.440]  so how many ingredients are in this, there's a whole bunch of ingredients in this as well,
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:16.320]  they're all natural, and it's amazing, everything known to give you deep, clean, restful sleep,
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:21.320]  it's in rocket rest, so be sure and check it out, research it for yourself, it's all
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:28.680]  back in stock at infowarstore.com, and we have the original OG documentary about the
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:35.560]  New World Order Great Reset Takeover made 14 years ago, even more popular today, and

[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:47.560]  them in bulk, I have one copy for 14.95 to support the broadcast, it has a zero country

[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:55.200]  we're going to have to get more into this as the censorship intensifies, have the hard
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:58.320]  copy in your library today.
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:03.000]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world, they are creating insecurity, crime,
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:09.080]  war, and famine, all of this should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:14.320]  and our family's sake, but also our community, and citizensstronghold.com is the best place

[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:19.160]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:23.640]  We're now into hour number two, and James O'Keefe is here, he's coming up with us next
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:28.720]  segment to give him the chair, maybe right now, but first, it's an important report at
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:34.720]  band.video in the John Bounds section, very important, the COVID rollout crashes and burns,
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:35.720]  here it is.
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:42.000]  Hockingbird Media is clamped down tight on why Denmark's top health official, Tanya Erickson,
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:47.240]  suddenly fainted, during a press conference halting the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine
[1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:51.840]  during an uptick of severe side effect injuries due to blood clotting.
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:58.320]  Whether the feigning was a result of nerves or the vaccine is moot, as the public perception
[1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:01.280]  was once again permanently damaged.
[1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:06.760]  And that is where the entire public rollout of the COVID lockdown and vaccine confusion
[1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:13.240]  has gone, driven into a place of overwhelming suspicion, while the truth slowly seeps out
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:19.280]  as it did when Pfizer's former vice president and chief scientist for allergy and respiratory
[1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:25.560]  who retired from the pharmaceutical giant with quote, the most senior research position
[1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:31.880]  and quote in his field addressing the demonstrably false propaganda from governments in response
[1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:37.280]  to COVID-19 and the strong possibility we are dealing with a conspiracy which could
[1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:44.280]  lead to something far beyond the carnage experienced in the wars and massacres of the 20th century.
[1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:50.520]  Its response to emergencies is guided by the scientific group who sit together under the
[1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:56.520]  strategic advisory group for emergencies or SAGE, so they should provide scientific
[1:05:56.520 --> 1:06:00.080]  advice to the government about what's appropriate to do.
[1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:07.400]  SAGE has got several fundamental things wrong and that has led to advice that's inappropriate
[1:06:07.400 --> 1:06:14.560]  and not only has had horrible economic effects but has had continuing of medical effects
[1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:17.840]  in that people are no longer being treated properly.
[1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:24.960]  Dr. Michael Yedin warns of the non-vaccinated becoming pariahs in an emerging digitized world,
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:29.680]  a sentiment straight from the script we are presented day in and day out.
[1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:35.200]  Less than 40% of the population who are susceptible, even theoretical epidemiologists would tell
[1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:41.200]  you that that's too small a number to support a consolidated and growing outbreak, a community
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:43.880]  immunity, a herd immunity.
[1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:48.520]  So SAGE says that we're not even close and I'm telling you that the best science by
[1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:53.800]  the best scientists in the world published in the top peer-reviewed journals says that
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:07:00.360]  they're wrong, that more than 60% of the population are now immune and it's simply not possible
[1:07:00.360 --> 1:07:02.800]  to have a large and growing pandemic.
[1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:07.600]  Yes, this is the question that's been flooding our verify inbox.
[1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:12.120]  Does the COVID-19 vaccine cause sterilization in women?
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:14.960]  And this is why so many people have been asking that question.
[1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:20.680]  It's a Facebook post that's widely circulating right now claiming a head researcher for vaccine
[1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:26.280]  manufacturer Pfizer is warning that the company's new COVID vaccine would cause sterilization
[1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:27.280]  in women.
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:32.480]  And Yedin along with a German doctor did send a letter to the European Medicines Agency
[1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:38.080]  asking the EMA to stop clinical trials of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.
[1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:43.320]  They said the vaccine might block a protein that's important in the formation of a placenta
[1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:48.040]  and the doctors claim that could possibly result in vaccinated women essentially becoming
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:49.040]  infertile.
[1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:51.000]  Is that a real possibility?
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.700]  Well 13 News reached out directly to Pfizer for answers.
[1:07:54.700 --> 1:07:57.960]  The company's response, not exactly helpful.
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.960]  Simply stating we are not commenting on that.
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:06.820]  Dr. Fauci and his World Health Organization cohorts clear disregard for our God given
[1:08:06.820 --> 1:08:14.320]  natural rights in favor of their vague totalitarian marching orders was on full display at a recent
[1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:17.880]  House coronavirus crisis subcommittee.
[1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:23.220]  Can you give us a specific measurement that will have to be attained some outcome some
[1:08:23.220 --> 1:08:28.080]  result that we have to reach so that Americans know they're going to get their liberties
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:32.240]  back and be able to move on with their lives?
[1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:37.920]  The more people that get vaccinated in the community, the lower the level of infection
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:38.920]  will be.
[1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:39.920]  I understand.
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:40.920]  I understand.
[1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:41.920]  Well give us an idea.
[1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:43.680]  I mean look, you've given us thoughts on all kinds of subjects.
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:46.200]  You've opined on all kinds of issues.
[1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:47.960]  Give us your best guess then.
[1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:48.960]  I just did.
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:49.960]  No you didn't.
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:50.960]  You didn't give us the time.
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:55.040]  When do you think this is going to, are we going to be here two years from now wearing
[1:08:55.040 --> 1:08:56.040]  masks?
[1:08:56.040 --> 1:08:59.040]  You aren't asking Dr. Fauci the same question?
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:00.960]  Let me, let me answer your ranting again.
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:01.960]  Let me just...
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:02.960]  I'm not ranting?
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:03.960]  Yes you are.
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:06.480]  No, here's how it works, Dr. Fauci.
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:07.720]  I get to ask you the question.
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:10.320]  You're the highest paid official in the United States government.
[1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:14.840]  You've given us your advice on baseball, on dating apps, on cruise ships.
[1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:18.400]  You told us zero masks, one mask, two masks, now back to one mask.
[1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:20.880]  I'm just asking you, when is it going to end?
[1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:22.040]  You can say I'm ranting.
[1:09:22.040 --> 1:09:25.840]  I'm actually asking the question that the citizens, I get the privilege of representing
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:27.320]  and my name actually goes on a ballot.
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:29.280]  I don't think your name's ever been on a ballot.
[1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:30.280]  My name goes on a ballot.
[1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:34.320]  The citizens I represent want to know the answer to when they can get their liberties
[1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:35.320]  back.
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:36.320]  You know, I...
[1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:37.320]  You can call that ranting.
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:42.040]  I actually call it standing up for the Constitution, which I take an oath to uphold Dr. Fauci every
[1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:45.480]  year, every term that I serve in this Congress representing the folks in the Fourth District
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:46.480]  of Ohio.
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:49.560]  So it is not ranting, it is defending the First Amendment.
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:50.560]  Badgering.
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:53.920]  You know, you're indicating liberty and freedom.
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:58.120]  I look at it as a public health measure to prevent people from dying and going to the
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:09:59.120]  hospital.
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:01.600]  You don't think Americans' liberties have been threatened the last year, Dr. Fauci?
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:02.720]  They've been assaulted.
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.600]  Their liberties have.
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:07.760]  I don't look at this as a liberty thing, Congressman Jordan.
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:09.260]  Well, that's obvious.
[1:10:09.260 --> 1:10:11.440]  As a public health thing.
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:13.840]  I disagree with you on that.
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:18.680]  You think the Constitution is suspended during a virus during a pandemic?
[1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:20.360]  It's certainly not, Dr. Fauci.
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:24.560]  Over the last year, Americans' First Amendment rights have been completely attacked.
[1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:27.960]  Your right to go to church, your right to assemble, your right to petition your government,
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:31.360]  freedom of the press, freedom of speech have all been assaulted.
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:34.160]  For a year now, Americans haven't been able to go to church.
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:37.920]  Even today, when they go to church, they're limited in the size of worshipers who can
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:38.920]  meet.
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:41.360]  You're making this a personal thing and it isn't.
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:42.360]  It's not a personal thing.
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:43.360]  No, you are.
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:45.200]  That is exactly what you're doing.
[1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:46.200]  No, you're right.
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:47.440]  I don't want you to answer my question.
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:50.520]  The American people want Dr. Fauci to answer the question.
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:51.520]  What does it have to be?
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:55.960]  But you might expire, sir, if you need to respect the chair and shut your mouth.
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:11:02.720]  The plan, like every other incompetent project, the power mad conjure up, is failing miserably,
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:06.880]  which only means that they will simply continue to make it worse.
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:11.640]  Dr. Fauci, does this look like social distancing to you that you require when you talk about
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:12.640]  six feet?
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:13.640]  No.
[1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:18.760]  So in these cells, as you just said, they're violating the very guidance that you tell
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:20.080]  Americans to follow.
[1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:24.680]  A restaurant in the United States would be shut down today if they were being run like
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:25.680]  this.
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:28.680]  Yet the federal government, the Biden administration, is running this facility.
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:34.200]  You can see all of these young children who are next to each other six inches apart.
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:35.960]  Many without masks, by the way.
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:38.360]  Does that follow your guidance that you've issued?
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:39.360]  No.
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:44.880]  Well, then why would the Biden administration not go and stop this?
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:48.640]  I think one of the reasons is to President Biden and Vice President Harris won't even
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:50.440]  go see this for themselves.
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:53.840]  That's why I keep urging strongly that they go to the border.
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:55.160]  John Bown reporting.
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:12:00.120]  I remember many years ago, the London Guardian and others reported, thanks to you kids, we
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:02.400]  now know the virus is a hoax.
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:06.560]  They included flu, pneumonia and other infections to boost the numbers.
[1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:08.600]  Let's find out who is really behind it all.
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:12.320]  President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:13.320]  Shishie Pink.
[1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:14.320]  Dr. Fauci.
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:23.800]  Like I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not scare them.
[1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:25.720]  Microsoft's Bill Gates.
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:31.080]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:32.080]  population.
[1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:33.080]  I get it.
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:36.960]  So Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:37.960]  disease outbreak.
[1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:38.960]  That's diabolical.
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:39.960]  Yeah.
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:40.960]  That sounds pretty bad.
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:45.840]  Don't worry kids, these globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:46.840]  where they're going.
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:50.840]  They'll be locked up for a long good while in the big house.
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:51.840]  Yeah.
[1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:55.840]  Better than a rock round at home.
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:13:13.080]  The answer through 1984 is 1776.
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:25.680]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:35.840]  The great awakening is here, go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:54.520]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[1:13:54.520 --> 1:14:06.680]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:11.160]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:14.600]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:17.580]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[1:14:17.580 --> 1:14:21.360]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:26.080]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:31.840]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:38.080]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:39.080]  the info war.
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:43.560]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:44.560]  from them.
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:48.560]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:51.000]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:58.240]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there, infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:02.840]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person but because of the globalists
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:03.840]  they're attacking humanity.
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:08.480]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and we've given the globalists
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:11.560]  one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:15.040]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:16.040]  a break.
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:17.040]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:21.040]  It's always been a Christian but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is
[1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:22.040]  so clear.
[1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:23.040]  And I get it.
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:24.040]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:28.960]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system and I get it.
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:29.960]  Me too.
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:35.480]  Believe me I'm one of them but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:40.800]  created that is so essential and God created the universe for us to have communion with
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:44.520]  God through and to have life and so that's what infowarsdomains.com is really all about.
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:48.280]  So thank you all for your word of mouth, thank you for spreading the word about infowarsdom,

[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.640]  So thank you for the support infowarsdom.com.
[1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:20.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:34.840]  Wow, well for the next 45 minutes or so, the one and only James O'Keefe of Project Veritas
[1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:38.480]  is in studio and he's got his amazing crew with him and we've also run into a lot of
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:43.480]  us under covers like Wink Wink where Veritas down at the border that is totally clapped
[1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:47.040]  and they break so many huge stories now I can't even keep track of them all so I gotta
[1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:51.720]  visit Project Veritas every day again thanks for joining us here, James good to see you
[1:16:51.720 --> 1:16:52.720]  again in person.
[1:16:52.720 --> 1:16:53.720]  Great to see you Alex.
[1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:57.420]  The great thing about you is after all my demonization and deplatforming you never
[1:16:57.420 --> 1:17:02.440]  betrayed me you still came on the show still supported us didn't believe the lies and disinformation
[1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:06.480]  I want to get into your latest visit with President Trump you just won a big victory
[1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:11.400]  in a lawsuit with the New York Times defaming you they're the fake news not you you also
[1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:15.240]  are filing a big suit on Twitter you were deplatformed off there last week but first
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:19.320]  off I want to ask the question you have the instinct to not run away from other patriots
[1:17:19.320 --> 1:17:24.400]  other investigative journalists that get demonized by MSM the rest of the Republicans and patriots
[1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:29.560]  and nationalists did that we would all still be standing instead they let us pick they
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:34.160]  let the system pick us off one at a time what was your instinct over the years when you
[1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:39.040]  got put under major pressure I know to not associate with info wars to say screw you.
[1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:42.560]  Well Alex I just want to say it's great to see you I don't think we've met in the flesh
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:47.640]  and one time maybe one time but not in your studio in Austin Texas and I just I just want
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:55.760]  to say this has been a really important week in history of Veritas and what we stand for
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:18:00.240]  these tapes Alex of CNN and what this man was saying maybe the most devastating thing
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:05.400]  we've ever done it's the nexus between what would they would call news although I don't
[1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:10.640]  call it that propaganda is what he calls himself propaganda the CNN director and big tech and
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:16.760]  there's only one truth there's only one reality and I don't I don't cower down I don't I don't
[1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:21.600]  understand why people are so afraid it's importantly fight back I think to answer your question
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:27.400]  Alex I think a lot of people fear being disliked they want secretly to be approved by these
[1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:33.000]  people and we took we took the curtain off of CNN our brave undercover people they're
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:37.600]  revealing who they actually that's it you're literally like Toto pulling back the curtain
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:43.880]  yeah and that's their words not mine I mean Twitter took me down on Thursday for quoting
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:48.880]  people or just reporting what they're saying so this is a really I think we've crossed
[1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:55.520]  the Rubicon here and I've seen an engagement a passion a overwhelming outpouring of support
[1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:00.240]  and you've been fighting for as long as you have 20 30 years I've been fighting for a
[1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:04.880]  decade but it seems like people are finally starting to understand what they're up against
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:11.600]  right now and oh it's incredible my deep platforming I used to be like kind of 60% positive 40%
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:16.040]  negative I get like 90% positive now I don't know what they've done or how the worm is
[1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:20.120]  turned but what you're saying is true just as a person who's recognized the average
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:24.440]  patriot isn't recognized so they don't know how a lot of people are but you're well recognized
[1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:28.640]  have you not seen it go from the majority positive almost completely positive almost
[1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:33.960]  completely positive even people who don't agree or who are not who are moderate or even
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:37.680]  people who are liberal in the classical sense will reach out to us and say what that guy
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:42.640]  said is wrong it speaks to the heart he's talking about one of these tapes as CNN director
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:47.480]  says we want the covert numbers higher on the screen for ratings because it fear sells
[1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:52.400]  if it bleeds it leads like wishing more people would die to increase the ratings that's not
[1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:56.560]  a right wing thing or a left wing it's just and the stuff you're doing is real and it's
[1:19:56.560 --> 1:20:01.360]  more powerful than any Perry Mason show I mean this is like palpable and it's not me
[1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:08.480]  opining or me bombastic on on Twitter it's me quoting him so I think I think we've passed
[1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:15.360]  this Rubicon and people are so fed up and fired up and and I'm announcing on your show
[1:20:15.360 --> 1:20:21.880]  and this isn't exclusive I have not you have a copy of this is a lawsuit against Twitter
[1:20:21.880 --> 1:20:27.040]  this is a lawsuit against Twitter we are filing it today in the next few hours in New York
[1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:31.360]  state and for those of you who think I'm bluffing or you think I'm doing this as a publicity
[1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:36.520]  stunt publicity stunt Alex we've just recently won in the last few weeks a historic motion
[1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:40.640]  and a defamation action against the New York Times we're one of the few people in modern
[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:45.040]  history that have gotten this far in a defamation lawsuit and I'm not going to settle I'm not
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:49.120]  going to hear anything you don't bluff you're the real McCoy and so explain that to people
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:53.400]  you put it on screen to we have a copy of it and they're on our computer you just filed
[1:20:53.400 --> 1:20:58.240]  suit today but but but let's get to that in a minute sure let's talk about the big victory
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:04.840]  with a major judge saying no seeing CNN Freud and slip the New York Times knowingly consciously
[1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:08.480]  lied about you saying you were fake news yes this is very important we're going to get a
[1:21:08.480 --> 1:21:11.680]  little in the weeds here but it's important for your audience to understand the nuances
[1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:15.640]  the New York Times called me deceptive and a disinformation person they say the same
[1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:19.440]  thing about you they say that about a lot of people we fought back this was in October
[1:21:19.440 --> 1:21:24.080]  it was a A1 news section article so we filed a defamation action New York court you might
[1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:29.280]  be thinking how do we get a judge that was rational well the defamation was so bad that
[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:34.760]  the New York Supreme Court a justice named Charles Wood published a 16 page order and
[1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:39.520]  there you have it on your screen this is against the New York Times a defamation action and
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:45.000]  the judge in New York said that it was the New York Times Alex that engaged in disinformation
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.880]  and deception by by calling us and the judge said there's a quote in this order he says
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:56.640]  they interjected their opinion in a news article and Facebook banned our video because of this
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:01.120]  New York Times article which was masking itself as news when it was actually opinion this is
[1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:04.680]  historic and the reason why it matters explain that because your lawyers I thought my lawyers
[1:22:04.680 --> 1:22:09.680]  about this decision they said no James isn't exaggerating this this is as big as as the
[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:14.200]  whole Sullivan case right yes this is assault New York Times he's Sullivan in 1964 established
[1:22:14.200 --> 1:22:18.920]  a malice standard so they can just lie and get away with it this decision is so big and
[1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:22.720]  the reason why it's such a big deal Alex is because we're going to go into depositions
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:26.880]  with the New York Times reporters that means I get to sit down the reporter who wrote that
[1:22:26.880 --> 1:22:31.360]  under oath and I get to ask what's in your mind what's in your notebook and we're going
[1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:35.760]  to put them in front of the hot seat under that's the talking point I mean I remember
[1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:38.400]  another thing it's Joe Rogan I love he's a good friend about about a year ago I said
[1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:42.720]  you want to have James O'Keefe on and he said oh but he's the guy that manufactures
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:47.480]  stuff and then when it when that case came out we were talking he goes hey James O'Keefe
[1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:51.960]  turns out they were lying about him so this is having an effect to say you manufacture
[1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:55.640]  stuff with no evidence I mean they're saying you're a fraud when they're the fraud it's
[1:22:55.640 --> 1:23:00.040]  it's a it's a paradox because people like that and they don't know if Joe is watching
[1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:04.080]  but he's referring or people refer to the New York Times articles and the New York Times
[1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:09.560]  was just held accountable by a judge and and it's the circular sourcing they do well I've
[1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:14.440]  heard that they're they're deceptive well that quote James O'Keefe is deceptive project
[1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:19.640]  veritas is that was itself an opinion admittedly the New York Times when I had to get him under
[1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:24.000]  oath Alex you got to get him under oath because they're narcissists and they can't be held
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:28.080]  accountable for anything they never apologize they never they never apologize for the lies
[1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:31.760]  but when they're under oath penalty of perjury that's when you got him in the hot seat we
[1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:36.280]  got him we're going to go after Twitter we're going to sue CNN we're going to start a people's
[1:23:36.280 --> 1:23:42.360]  defamation defense fund so many people in this country are defamed every day and they
[1:23:42.360 --> 1:23:46.120]  can't I mean the New York Times just called me a white supremacy again yesterday well
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:49.400]  you should go after them you're not a white supremacy no I'm not you're not you don't
[1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:54.080]  you and they lie about it and they get away with it so someone has to do something we
[1:23:54.080 --> 1:23:59.080]  are that someone in a few hours from now this hasn't even been filed yet it's it's the final
[1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:04.180]  draft it's getting filed it's getting filed today beautiful well we're going to go to
[1:24:04.180 --> 1:24:11.560]  break and come back with the latest stuff that is unfolding as well and also talk more
[1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:15.480]  about Twitter because this is a big deal with 36 we have I mean Twitter says you created
[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:21.480]  fake accounts yes with no evidence and then bans you saying you're fraught we'll go we'll
[1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:25.720]  get into details as soon as after the commercial break and again for all the radio listeners
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:31.000]  they all visit but project veritas.com yes yes project veritas.com veritas tips v e r
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:36.400]  i t a v e r i t s tips at protonmail.com is where the whistleblowers go absolutely and
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:39.520]  I tell whistleblowers you can send us stuff but just send it to him because they usually
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:42.680]  get on it better than we do so I'm just glad that he's there we're not in competition we're
[1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:49.000]  all in this together James O'Keefe in studio infowars.com newswars.com and now exploding
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:54.760]  in popularity thanks to you listeners band.video we to give you an account I wish you doppelganger
[1:24:54.760 --> 1:25:01.360]  material over at band.video but right back in the early 1990s there was a really funny
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:09.640]  movie that came out called wainsworld even before I had access to a show in the mid-1990s
[1:25:09.640 --> 1:25:14.480]  I wouldn't call that movie and thought man that was fun I could speak out and have your
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:18.800]  own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining because you're real well
[1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:25.440]  what do they say in wainsworld we're not worthy we're not worthy every day when I cover these
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:29.360]  huge topics I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge are so
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:32.560]  real but I'm trying to tell you the truth I'm trying to get it right and most of the
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:38.560]  time we do the globalists love lying to you they love manipulating you they enjoy destroying
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:44.160]  humanity and enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them that for me
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:48.960]  is really set down and disgusting so you've got to pledge for myself and the hauling for
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:55.200]  worst crew that we will never join the globalists we will never knowingly manipulate you because
[1:25:55.200 --> 1:26:01.760]  we know we're all in this together.

[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:28.720]  war
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:33.960]  well the one the only james o'keep of project veritas is here in studio you know had a chance
[1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:37.280]  to be in some pretty big hollywood movies didn't ask to be in them but rick link later called
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:41.120]  up put me in them and I had a chance to hang out in hollywood been a lot of big tv shows
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:44.520]  and some other films and I really didn't like it and I went from not really caring about
[1:28:44.520 --> 1:28:49.160]  hollywood stars to just can't stand don't want to be around it but when you're talking
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:53.560]  about a james o'keep or back before he turned to the dark side or whatever happened to him
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:58.040]  a matt drudge where you talk about a president trump or you talk about people like that that
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:02.280]  have gone through the fire and really stand for something the globalists hate them I admire
[1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:05.680]  them and we were talking during the break about how you've never settled a lawsuit you've
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:10.760]  never backed down and how you learned that lesson yeah when you pled guilty for simply
[1:29:10.760 --> 1:29:15.880]  exposing corruption yeah alex i mean i've been through a lot in my young life in warlands
[1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:22.280]  i was jailed i was jailed in louisiana i was there trying to ask questions of senator
[1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:26.840]  landrew and i was incarcerated spent three years on federal probation i stood falsely
[1:29:26.840 --> 1:29:33.320]  accused and the prosecutors who came after me were disbarred they resigned in disgrace
[1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:37.560]  and i learned a valuable lesson i'll never make that mistake again i was personally sued
[1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:42.200]  for invasion of privacy for recording an acorn employee 2009 that was a personal litigation
[1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:47.040]  but project veritas has never said a lawsuit i went all the way to jury verdict hillary
[1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:52.280]  clinton campaign and some of their folks sued me all the way to a jury verdict and i won
[1:29:52.280 --> 1:29:58.600]  and i learned a valuable lesson that the only people who can defeat us is ourselves what
[1:29:58.600 --> 1:30:05.040]  we stand for with this cnn twitter it's greater than us personally it's about fundamental
[1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:08.840]  principles i was just about to say that i'm going to rep because it's so true it'll be
[1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:13.560]  midnight i'm exhausted on the road i eat too much drink too much and i'm feeling depressed
[1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:17.760]  which i don't feel a lot i feel weak and i go i'm fighting with james o'keith and president
[1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:21.720]  trump and you know roger stone and so many others who are strong and i literally feel
[1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:26.360]  strength knowing you're there and it's bigger than me it's about all of us our ancestors
[1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:30.400]  where this is i was just thinking that when you saw well i got contacted on you know we
[1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:35.800]  get thousands of message day instagram email and one person messaged me it was really it
[1:30:35.800 --> 1:30:41.400]  was really poignant the person said i was defamed by i think it was pbs news and i and i sued
[1:30:41.400 --> 1:30:46.160]  them but i have a job i have kids and i can't go through all this litigation but you can
[1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:52.720]  she said and i'm living vicariously through your battles because every day every day in
[1:30:52.720 --> 1:30:58.200]  this country people get lied about and run over every day innocent people not just public
[1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:01.880]  figures like me innocent people by the new york times that's why i got started read the
[1:31:01.880 --> 1:31:06.560]  new york times in college and i was disgusted by it and i and everyone's like what can
[1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:11.640]  i do and this is this is what it's all about the most trusted name of news as they call
[1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:16.560]  themselves is partnering with the most powerful companies in the world the algorithms prefer
[1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:20.840]  their news if you want to call it that and i'm fighting we're fighting back and and i'm
[1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:27.400]  telling you alex we're winning the only way we can lose is if we don't stop fighting
[1:31:27.400 --> 1:31:30.360]  and and that's what the problem with that if you want to call them conservatives i don't
[1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:34.560]  even consider myself that the problem with this movement of like the conservative or
[1:31:34.560 --> 1:31:38.960]  the republic they want approval from our enemies in the system that will never give them approval
[1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:43.120]  the only way to change things is not give a damn what they think you i'm glad you said
[1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:48.040]  that i say it in a dissimilar but different way i say the moment you stop caring about
[1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:54.520]  what they think about you is the moment that you are truly free and even people that claim
[1:31:54.520 --> 1:32:00.320]  to be my ally well i might get my twitter account banned why do you care tell the truth there
[1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:03.800]  is only one and that's how they get us all they're always picking people off and no one
[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:07.800]  stands up for them hoping that they're the last to get picked there's no that's there's
[1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:15.680]  only one truth and and and there's only one reality so stop caring about your book being
[1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:21.400]  reviewed by the new york times stop caring that if you embed the thing of the guy saying
[1:32:21.400 --> 1:32:26.240]  they're fraud that you might lose your twitter account do the right thing and the right things
[1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:29.160]  will happen well that's right they didn't take your twitter account because you were
[1:32:29.160 --> 1:32:33.400]  wrong they took it because you were so right because i mean they're scared this is cnn you
[1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:37.560]  know jeff zucker called him you know he called the head ceo and they're like you gotta get
[1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:42.000]  this off this is because this is caught the nails it shows premeditated fraud in the
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:46.440]  election tell about the three parts briefly that yeah i know i know but this is important
[1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:51.240]  to play over and over again these are three part series wednesday tuesday wednesday thursday
[1:32:51.240 --> 1:32:56.440]  last week ceo and director admits to quote propaganda quote we're trying to help paint
[1:32:56.440 --> 1:33:00.840]  biden as a young bariatric with a geriatric with aviator shades quote our focus was to
[1:33:00.840 --> 1:33:06.240]  get trump out of office quote our network is engaged in propaganda because fear sells
[1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:11.680]  and we don't say the quiet part out loud usually and my point is why wouldn't you say the quiet
[1:33:11.680 --> 1:33:18.240]  part out loud why why lie about what your intentions are if you want to be a network that is part
[1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:23.960]  of the biden administration then just say so you have a first amendment right to be part
[1:33:23.960 --> 1:33:28.480]  of a political campaign but don't pretend that you're the most trusted name in news and twitter
[1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:34.200]  banned me for quoting this man i mean think of the implications for being banned for quoting
[1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:40.800]  someone that is so that is so anathema to what our country stands for for what the declaration
[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:47.320]  of independence says to what the constitution says and that's why i say that we can't lose
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:53.240]  as long as we don't compromise on our principles and so many people do and i'm telling you right
[1:33:53.240 --> 1:33:57.080]  here right now usually alex in a motion to dismiss once you get past motion to dismiss
[1:33:57.080 --> 1:34:00.560]  a defamation lawsuit the law for your money they offer nix sandman remember the young
[1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:05.040]  man that was defamed by the washington post he had the hat he settled i say why did you
[1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:10.640]  settle you get to go all the way if you're on offense get discovery sometimes they knew
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:14.640]  he was innocent they knew those guys were screaming racial epithets even the black people they
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:19.040]  knew he came over and got in his face but they decided to lie they decided to lie and
[1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:23.080]  they called the white supremacist nix sandman and i well i'll tell you what if they new
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:27.520]  york times offers me ten million dollars i'll tell them to go to hell because there's no
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:32.160]  amount of money that's going to make me settle this case you cannot buy me i am not for sale
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:37.280]  i have been jailed i have been sued i have been through a crucible and what i've learned
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:42.160]  is as long as you don't stop fighting you will never lose as long as you don't stop
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:47.120]  sending up for truth and i can tell you as a result of the cnn expose and we should play
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:51.600]  some of the clips i've had people within news networks come to me say hey give me one of
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:55.120]  those little hidden cameras i want to i want to blow the whistle i think there's a movement
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:58.920]  budding in this country let's talk about the the the the wind is the dam collapsed it's
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:02.920]  already broken there's already huge holes in it there are systems in crisis they've doubled
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:07.600]  down with manipulation with fraud with with with gaslighting and we're live right now
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:11.800]  in post we will add all three of the little promo clips to this but we're going to play
[1:35:11.800 --> 1:35:15.720]  something when we come back but having you here is you know just as important right pieces
[1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:19.800]  because people get an insight into this but that's the key thing you just said of everything
[1:35:19.800 --> 1:35:26.680]  as we reach critical mass as i go to the border most of our patrol wants to talk to us it's
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:31.400]  whistleblowers galore they're just looking for venues to do it which again shows there's
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:35.160]  not enough people doing what you're doing you people need to support project veritas
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:38.760]  support us but also they have to go out and do it yourself you started doing this 10
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:44.200]  years ago and you folks this is so so critical mass the moment where there's so much whistleblowing
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:48.280]  so much coming out what happens i think alex that if we haven't reached the tipping point
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:52.240]  we are about to because i have these federal agents just like you on the border here in
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:57.400]  donna mcallon texas and and they come to me and they say james there's nowhere else for
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:03.120]  me to go i trust you because you have not settled the litigation i trust you because
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:11.360]  you do fight back and there's so many people like this that that come to us now and i have
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:17.000]  an obligation to fight on their behalf i'll sue people on your behalf have you been defamed
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:22.280]  by the media it's time for us to start suing and there's this fear and i say what are you
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:28.400]  afraid of stop being afraid of them they're afraid of us okay i can tell you right now
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:32.440]  you know who's afraid of us right now the executive editor of the new york times because
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:38.000]  never in his life has he been under oath on videotape that's what they fear and they've
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:42.960]  lied for too long and and i'm telling you i i'm not bluffing i'm not kidding this is
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:47.680]  all going to happen well i mean i've seen you in case after case after case after case
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:51.360]  after case so god's definitely with you i'll tell you one more thing twitter this week
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:55.320]  we were in the number two trending thing on twitter alex that's in the trending section
[1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:59.560]  and i told my team on monday say guys on number one goal this week is to be top trending on
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:02.320]  twitter they said and people say you're crazy james i mean you're not going to get trending
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:07.480]  on twitter they ban you they shadow ban i said content is king if the content is strong
[1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:10.800]  if all of you talk about his content if all of you push it you'll be number one you'll
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:14.560]  be number one and i'm not it's not about it's about overriding the censors it's about let's
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:20.560]  make project veritas number one james oakie number two cnn expose a number three and info
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:25.960]  wars dot com number four yeah because it's about it's about earning their turf it's about
[1:37:25.960 --> 1:37:29.960]  making them come they want to silence us they want to lie about us it's about fighting back
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:35.680]  and we project veritas was banned on twitter alex a month ago and yet project veritas was
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:39.480]  trending as a result of these exposés and then you just got banned last week and jack
[1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:45.320]  dorsey you know jack dorsey in concert in concert with jeff sucker at cnn and that's that's
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:50.360]  the unholy alliance the oligarchy banned us as a result of that's the cartel and that's
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:57.360]  key so first they brand veritas then they ban you it's a total message that you didn't
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:01.520]  back down stay with us the world is awakening the world is beginning to understand the globalist
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:07.800]  paradigm they are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the cfr the trilateral
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:14.840]  commission the bill de berg group the behemian grove the club of rome and so even though
[1:38:14.840 --> 1:38:19.720]  it seems like the globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open
[1:38:19.720 --> 1:38:26.520]  to attack human freedom because they're actually losing we have forced them out in the open
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:31.480]  so as bad as these times are a lot of negative things are about to happen realize humanity
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:37.360]  is winning you've got to trust in the plan of god and trust in the plan of god's justice
[1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:43.880]  that is invincible that is ethereal timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man trust
[1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:48.120]  in god to lead god and direct your soul and then take action against the globalists and
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:53.280]  realize you've got my commitment from alex jones and my crew to you we will never back
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:58.240]  down from the globalist and we will never surrender gerald and south surelina go ahead
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:02.480]  you're on the air trying to move quicker hey alex welcome would like to say first off thanks
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:07.000]  for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people i've
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:13.040]  been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:18.800]  infection on my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my life they had me on
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:23.720]  antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted
[1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:29.640]  to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:36.760]  24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you
[1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:43.120]  shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:48.040]  betray one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:52.440]  because god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:59.600]  why the enemy hates it because god created this country i'm a very humble person but
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:04.320]  i'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:08.960]  with all the terrible things that are unfolding i want you to know a lot of positive things
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:13.880]  are happening as well i'm a public figure so i get to see things the general public

[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:24.800]  or even folks in hollywood or or or mainstream media or industry people are really really
[1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:29.200]  awake in the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalist but they're

[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:04.720]  bittersweet everything we've talked about this happened just like we said it would
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:07.680]  and now we have a lot of credibility but i don't care about that i care about beating
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:12.080]  the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:16.320]  stay on air much longer and i don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:20.320]  for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this we're going to see
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:25.680]  this through the end we're going to stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:30.560]  buy the products and then for store.com they're great products plus they fund the operation so

[1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:40.640]  don't these are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:45.280]  and looking for truth that's why the globalists are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:49.280]  and leave people like us on the air so while you're at it don't just financially support us and
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:53.840]  spread the word download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how
[1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:57.440]  long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[1:41:57.440 --> 1:42:24.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:42:55.040 --> 1:43:00.640]  hands in a crowded room but i feel like i know you have any on the show for 10 years but i said
[1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:06.720]  what's victory how do we win how do we leverage this tipping point do you said a key term so we
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.960]  say a lot of important stuff here but we talk fast highlight what you're about to hear this what he's
[1:43:10.960 --> 1:43:16.320]  saying is x caliber what i'm saying is distribution by proxy and i want you to think existentially

[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:25.920]  growing if i embed those clips of these people talking saying the fraud and all of you were to

[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:03.120]  like cloward pivot in reverse and let's explain this take your time on this because this is me
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:09.360]  cited the listeners are so humble and so loyal they're like i get emails every five minutes is it
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:13.360]  okay if i put a clip of you out because it lets me do two minutes alex is it all right if i put
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:18.720]  info words on my barn do it don't wait it's free to air he's saying the same thing imagine i want
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:22.880]  you to think big imagine if let's say a quarter million people do this a quarter million people
[1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:29.520]  upload this bit of uh we have most talks you host exaggerate their listenership we conservatively
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:34.160]  on amen at them stations have one million listeners right now okay we'll order half of those people
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:38.880]  500 000 people upload the bit to twitter of brian stelter being confronted which i think we'll
[1:44:38.880 --> 1:44:45.120]  play in a minute and he and he's just pathetic and he's saying i feel sorry and and for for you and
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:50.800]  imagine if you all uploaded that on twitter and tagged him you guys would create a truthful
[1:44:50.800 --> 1:44:55.280]  revolution what's stopping you from doing that nothing literally you have your phone in your
[1:44:55.280 --> 1:44:59.920]  possession you go to our telegram page download the clip and do it right now have eric upload it
[1:44:59.920 --> 1:45:05.440]  right now i mean and he is the guy and he is the guy that polices everybody when he talks about you
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:10.000]  get banned yeah i mean they have a cone of silence at cnn like the soviets did by the way he put that
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:14.720]  picture on himself what kind of disconnect does he have to put a photo like well i don't know if
[1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:18.880]  you i know he's not the most telegenic of individuals but if you have the clip of him being
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:24.080]  confronted by our reporter he's in he's in the the basement of the building and he calls the
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:29.600]  maintenance worker on us they they're they're cowardly there he is cowards and we confront him
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:34.560]  and he says he says i feel sorry for you guys i was like we're not the one and did you see that
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:40.880]  disdainful hateful look because because you guys are real journalists we're we're if all of you
[1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:47.120]  upload this to your twitter accounts and tag brian stelter and say we demand answers and by the way
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:53.680]  we're not bullying stelter he and the others at cnn command the censorship system of us cnn confronts
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:58.160]  people all the time on their blondes and front lawns he says i feel sorry for you like like
[1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:02.640]  you should be ashamed a lot of the left always says they shame us shame on you you shameful
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:06.320]  creature or they don't have shame they don't have they're again they're narcissists they don't take
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:12.000]  responsibility for anything but i think that's what this distribution by proxy if you don't remember
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:17.280]  anything that i say today please do this do not be afraid do not ask for permission that's right
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:24.800]  so the headline is james oakheaf visits alex jones with the message of distribution oh no
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:30.640]  distribution by proxy will save the world will save will save the truth because there is only
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:36.480]  one truth and it's telegram you can download the little thirty second bit my my my colleague is
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:42.640]  standing here he's about to upload it eric right now and you all can tweak this out and trend on
[1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:46.960]  their turf i tried to pull up our telegram i'm not bad about not promoting telegram we barely
[1:46:46.960 --> 1:46:50.880]  promoted everybody should join us at telegram i tried to kick off twitter i didn't promote in
[1:46:50.880 --> 1:46:55.280]  these social medias but i like telegram put up the info wars the alex jones telegram we will
[1:46:55.280 --> 1:47:00.000]  we will retelegram what they're saying and then grab our telegrams and tweak those as well hit them
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:05.840]  a thousand different ways on facebook twitter youtube download this interview cut it up put it
[1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:10.320]  out on youtube get it up with the judges sound bite from this new york state judge on telegram
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:16.240]  and you can share that there is only one truth and you can share and distribute and circulate it
[1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:20.160]  and they won't be able to ban it yes they can ban you off this platform another platform will come
[1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:24.240]  up and we'll keep overwhelming it and that's and that's what's going to happen that's what
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:28.400]  must happen for us to be victoria you're right you're smart there's so many fan accounts on
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:32.800]  them fours that's not the one we've done there too i think we got like 300 000 200 000 on there
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:36.640]  but yeah folks go to whatever whatever our telegram is i should be involved in all this
[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:43.200]  i should be using it but you're absolutely right and again distribution by proxy yeah they can ban
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:47.680]  an individual for something but they can't ban you for carrying the ball they can't ban the truth
[1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:52.080]  and that's why this is the rubicon they they cross because i didn't opine i didn't offer my opinion
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:58.080]  alex it was the director of cnn saying what he said that they banned so they banned something
[1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:04.320]  so fundamental to who we are as americans it's a principle uh i know that two principles right
[1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:10.000]  now are under threat particularly equal justice under the law but they can't defeat a principle
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.480]  as long as we don't back down from that principle that's what i've learned in my life being jailed
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:20.560]  and sued and attacked and defamed is that they actually can't defeat me as long as as long as i
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:26.240]  don't compromise on what i believe in because i'm quoting the guy wasn't me saying cnn's propaganda
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:33.840]  it was cnn saying cnn's propaganda alex distribution by proxies where it's at absolutely so listeners
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:38.720]  are always asking oh alex you're so great very nice so great what do we do i just i just gave you
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:43.440]  something from has been cut off everywhere how does he get out now when he goes to a republican event
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:48.080]  or a wedding and he gets five million views somebody with a camera shoots it that's distribution
[1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:53.680]  by proxy right he's not allowed to have a twitter or facebook but you are so use it you've got email
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:57.600]  and you've got text messages you shoot a video share it with friends and family that have big
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:03.680]  facebook and have big twitters i go out to any event the border of a political event i have no
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:08.160]  accounts and will end up all over hundreds of things sometimes with 10 million views five
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:12.480]  million views but it doesn't matter whether it's a 10 000 or whatever the truth is getting out but
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:16.400]  it's not enough it's not enough they're doing it they're doing it and you said it yourself some
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:21.280]  people like well timid should i do it alex kind of am i allowed to upload your clip you're like
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:26.560]  sure i mean do it more do it tenfold i saw trump at the moro lago after this new york times about
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:31.120]  that's my next question and and he you know he was he was in good spirits he he he was very
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:34.720]  we're not allowed to bring phones into his office but when he saw the new york times victory he said
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:40.320]  bring your phone in and he filmed a video with us uh that means he trusts you yeah yeah and he said
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:44.800]  and he said let's film a video on this new york times victory because i want you to go all the
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:49.280]  way on this new york times defamation action so trump and i talked about this this new york times
[1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:54.560]  loss it is a big deal and i think there's the fact that alex at cnn has not uttered a word except
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.040]  ryan stelter is saying he feels sorry for me or sorry for us they haven't uttered a word means
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:04.000]  they can't defend what this guy well they're such liars that means i admire you i wish i was real
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:10.080]  i wish i wasn't propped up i wish i had viewers i mean stelter has 200 000 viewers uh i mean that's
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:15.600]  that's that's not even a dead cat bounce that he's a joke he is but the the issue alex is that they
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:20.800]  partner with the tech companies so the twitter and the big tech force feed and then the tech has
[1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:26.160]  all the power cnn has no power but tech has the power and they leverage the content via their
[1:50:26.160 --> 1:50:29.600]  algorithms but you notice that almost all the comments hate them that that's why they're even
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:34.960]  getting rid of comments on cnn pages and joe biden pages and they're getting rid of the of the the
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:40.640]  the dislike button your your motto is info wars and i can tell you that this week i've had people
[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:47.840]  who don't agree with me say those cnn tapes changed my mind it was wrong for them to promote the
[1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:54.080]  covid deaths and want more people to die so the ratings go up that's universally disgusting to even
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:59.280]  people who don't agree with you that is an info war that is information that can change hearts and
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:03.920]  minds and that's why zucker has basically given this cone of silence and told the staff don't
[1:51:03.920 --> 1:51:10.960]  say a word about okif this week they can't defend what we've exposed they are they they so i'm
[1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:15.600]  gonna sue them i'm gonna sue anna cabrera for defamation she said i was i was i was banned from
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:20.400]  twitter for for for disinformation which is untrue she said project veritas was banned
[1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:25.760]  from twitter for disinformation that's a defamatory statement and i'll put stelter and if i can and
[1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:29.840]  certainly anna cabrera under oath in a hot seat and i'll say what do you guys what are you guys
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:34.640]  doing and you know what i think they'll do alex i think they'll throw each other under the bus how
[1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:40.800]  bad has it hurt seeing and who almost has no viewers already all your exposition i mean these
[1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:45.840]  are devastating i i think it's i think the i mean if my listeners saw one video of me saying i lie
[1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:50.320]  to people and screw them and oh my god we're up that they beat them i don't talk like that and i know
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:55.120]  you because we talk offline and one of the things i respect about you and i and i will and i i'm your
[1:51:55.120 --> 1:52:00.480]  friend is that you are the same person off camera as you are on camera you're an authentic person you
[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:08.400]  believe in what you do these people i mean sick twisted narcissistic garbage he's saying i know
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:14.000]  it's wrong i lie to people i propagate you you would never say that i mean this is crazy so i
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:19.200]  respect you because you're real you're not phony but our brains don't even work we're not even i'm
[1:52:19.200 --> 1:52:23.200]  not perfect i mean i get mad i do think but i don't think they're like scheme how to screw people
[1:52:23.200 --> 1:52:28.080]  over you don't want to deceive your audience and this and and there are laws in this country oh and
[1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:31.680]  that's why they say you deceive everybody and i deceive because they're masters of projection
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:35.840]  yes because they project on to us and they and it's a psychological thing i've read a couple

[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:41.440]  say it in a different way so you understand what i'm saying you don't have to ask me permission
[1:56:41.440 --> 1:56:47.680]  cut the thing down and distribute it because you will trend on twitter and and and project veritas
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:53.440]  will never be defeated project veritas is truth dean backe not the true dean backe is the executive
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:56:58.000]  out of the new york times cnn not the truth that's why project veritas cannot be defeated
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:03.520]  it as long as you guys don't ask permission to share this stuff you know so i i'm we're gonna i
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:07.760]  want you to do well here's an action item what can i do james oakheath go to telegram if you
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:13.440]  don't have it download it we'll upload the clip we've got more bombshell reports coming out this
[1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:19.520]  week and you upload it into your twitter the jack dorsi can't ban all of you and if he does that
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:24.560]  will be an extraordinary series of events that will just draw more attention to what we're doing
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:29.280]  alex in the old days before they change their algorithm we can do something called google bombs
[1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:34.080]  where i would say a term all our listeners would search it and we go to number one we should start
[1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:39.120]  every month or so doing a twitter bomb a facebook bomb but twitter is really the one to go after
[1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:43.760]  and we can exactly upload some clips right certain topics and then we can the listeners do it will
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:47.920]  be number one i'm gonna ban your whole audience that reminds me of the ron paul money bombs from
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:53.760]  2008 you know 250 000 people upload the bombshell clip it goes viral they're gonna have to ban all
[1:57:53.760 --> 1:57:58.880]  the clips of the people talking when we get federal judges on tape taking bribes and exposing this
[1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:04.880]  corruption that what project veritas does so well they can't ban all of you you just need to have
[1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:11.280]  the courage to share the videos because you're still out there veritas banned on twitter but we
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:17.280]  got a lot of people who aren't you've only begun to fight as john paul joneson we're not we're just
[1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:21.360]  getting started alex i mean well i'm not glad the texas borders collapsed but i'm glad to have you
[1:58:21.360 --> 1:58:25.440]  around texas more yeah we guys are really kicking ass yeah we have a lot of federal whistleblowers on
[1:58:25.440 --> 1:58:29.200]  the border we're just getting started we got whistleblowers coming to us every day and we're
[1:58:29.200 --> 1:58:33.440]  just getting started and then they do fear us they fear us a lot more than we fear them because i
[1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:36.960]  don't i don't really care what they think about me and i want to say this again because this is
[1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:42.960]  the other thing i want to emphasize on your show the moment you stop caring about what new york
[1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:48.960]  times and jack dorsi thinks about you is the moment you are able to tell the truth the moment
[1:58:48.960 --> 1:58:54.720]  that you're free and i still think there's a lot of people that they still filter yeah they're losing
[1:58:54.720 --> 1:58:59.280]  the country in the world because of the self-censorship folks the only thing you have to lose is your
[1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:03.840]  change to use a linen quote but i mean for real because it's the leftist change going on and i'm
[1:59:03.840 --> 1:59:08.800]  glad you came here with a mission i'm glad you came here with this term tell them one more time
[1:59:09.440 --> 1:59:16.880]  distribution by proxy download telegram download the 30 second to 50 second clips and upload them
[1:59:16.880 --> 1:59:21.360]  everywhere nobody can stop you and i've not promoted our telegram but so it's only got a
[1:59:21.360 --> 1:59:25.440]  10 000 here 50 000 there but we should be on that we are we're going to be on that more too
[1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:28.800]  putting clips stuff that's a great idea because i have a section of hot clips on band off any
[1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:33.680]  folks who grab it it's better to do it on the free or social media i hope frank uh his his new
[1:59:33.680 --> 1:59:38.000]  system i know lindell just wants that today yeah sure i we i support all the platforms
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:42.240]  i mean andrew brybert once said cannibalize the content i don't care upload it everywhere
[1:59:42.240 --> 1:59:47.520]  parlor twitter that one franks my pillow listen your message is pure victory truth is victory

[2:00:36.880 --> 2:00:43.200]  once it hits us once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us we just have to
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:49.280]  point out we try to stop it so prepare yourselves america you're going under judgment just like
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:01:05.200]  all the children that were aborted this is the truth this is the info war
[2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:16.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[2:01:16.880 --> 2:01:21.520]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:33.360]  just months after hiring former biden transition official andrew lorenzen straight texas nonprofit
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:38.800]  family endeavors won a no big contract for as much as five hundred and thirty million dollars
[2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:46.000]  to provide care for the migrant children arriving at the u.s border former ice official and the
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:52.320]  country's first national migrant public advocate lorenzen straight worked for lutheran immigration
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:59.280]  and refugee service leers where he oversaw a national network of foster care for unaccompanied
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:04.800]  immigrant children which seems to be exactly what he is doing for endeavor through the mccallan
[2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:10.240]  respite center where thousands of unaccompanied illegal immigrant minors are being shipped off
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:17.280]  to cities across america each week to live with whoever signed up on their website family endeavors
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:22.720]  confirmed this they said the work is a continuation of services we have delivered to the migrant
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:30.400]  population since 2012 family endeavors recently hired basal musli as their deputy director for
[2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:36.960]  migrant services who formerly worked for sarc the syrian era of red crescent who partnered with the
[2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:45.520]  united nations and open border ngo's in the evacuation of syrian refugees into europe it seems
[2:02:45.520 --> 2:02:51.120]  the endless pipeline of immigrants coming into the u.s through mccallan texas are coming in as
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:58.960]  refugees and the amount of refugees we take in is decided by our senile puppet president our
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:05.440]  corrupt congress and globalist government agencies who all seem to now be aligned with the united
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:11.360]  nations and according to the united nations replacement migration program the u.s should
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:19.120]  have 593 million so don't expect anything to be done about the endless import of these so called
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:26.640]  refugees all coming in to receive years of taxpayer dollars from our broken welfare system it's all
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:32.640]  part of the plan to destroy the national sovereignty of western nations and if you still have a
[2:03:32.640 --> 2:03:38.240]  survival instinct that causes you to question this then you are labeled a heartless right wing
[2:03:38.240 --> 2:03:45.360]  bigot there is no more common sense americans along with the rest of the modern western world
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:53.280]  are being conquered by way of name calling and tragically it's working for info wars dot com
[2:03:53.280 --> 2:04:08.000]  this is greg reese and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.880]  what's going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:28.800]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:04:43.600 --> 2:04:52.080]  well listen i just told the story earlier mainstream media government cover-ups you want
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:59.760]  to stop tyranny well so does he lie from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:04.160]  a little late get into this segment i appreciate roger stone being with us we hear the powerful
[2:05:04.160 --> 2:05:08.160]  greg reese report they didn't put in the greg reese section that's in the border crisis section
[2:05:08.160 --> 2:05:14.320]  of bandai videos i hope you share it it is cough and nails to the globalist claiming
[2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:19.680]  that the borders are open for humanitarian purposes but i wanted to get roger on i
[2:05:19.680 --> 2:05:27.760]  appreciate the embattled former president's consigliere uh coming on with us i uh woke up
[2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:35.920]  i guess saturday morning to learn that oh major justice department lawsuit for millions of secret
[2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:40.720]  tax lush funds and of course i know all about roger's background history number that's true so
[2:05:40.720 --> 2:05:44.320]  i thought we'd get him on to respond to it but also talk about the fact this is what it's like to be
[2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:48.400]  in the crucible and and i'm just talking to roger last night i said we got to come on top of this
[2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:54.160]  how thankful he is to the listeners and viewers and and his fans that have kept him even alive
[2:05:54.160 --> 2:05:57.440]  they believe and have a small apartment just hanging with project veritas the funding you're
[2:05:57.440 --> 2:06:02.080]  giving him the funding you fund us you are our boosters you are our backers and i'm under major
[2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:06.560]  attack okay thunder major attack roger's under major attack but what we've got is the fighting
[2:06:06.560 --> 2:06:12.800]  spirit and sometimes when i feel tired or exhausted or bummed out which is an awesome it happens i
[2:06:12.800 --> 2:06:18.880]  think of roger stoner think of president trump i think of uh you know i think of the my pillow guy
[2:06:18.880 --> 2:06:23.440]  i i think of all these fighters that have gone through hell and i am so honored to be amongst
[2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:28.400]  these fighters and to be demonized by the globalist so roger thanks for joining us i know your wife's
[2:06:28.400 --> 2:06:33.360]  probably not happy about a whole new giant lie a whole new giant attack but my god you certainly
[2:06:33.360 --> 2:06:39.200]  are known by your enemies my friend well i appreciate that alex look this is driven by the
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:47.200]  hysteria of the left i mean there's just lunatic brain for my blood that it dominates twitter
[2:06:47.200 --> 2:06:53.040]  these people are angry that the president trump had the courage and the wisdom to recognize the
[2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:59.920]  epic corruption and political motivation of the charges that brought against me he recognized
[2:06:59.920 --> 2:07:05.520]  that it was a railroading to a death sentence and by the hand of god he stepped in and saved my life
[2:07:06.160 --> 2:07:13.040]  these people uh despise me because i oppose them and i have challenged them and i have beaten them
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:20.560]  and publicly i question them they hate that the most so this is witch hunt 3.0 first it was the
[2:07:20.560 --> 2:07:29.840]  russian collusion hoax then i had to bear hundreds of stories saying man seen with roger stone arrested
[2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:37.680]  in january 6 insurrection uh and an entire complex uh i should say uh coordinated campaign
[2:07:38.240 --> 2:07:45.120]  of of guilt by association and innuendo with abc news and it's like working hounds hundreds of
[2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:51.920]  thousands of tweets a day saying arrest jones arrest stone put them in prison take their families i
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:56.880]  mean and it doesn't even scare us it makes us feel sorry that there are these armies of unamerican
[2:07:56.880 --> 2:08:02.960]  scum roger well but that it's important for people analytically to understand how this works
[2:08:03.520 --> 2:08:09.520]  as soon as any notion uh for example despite there is no evidence to it roger stone should be
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:17.120]  charged in the january 6 unlawful acts which i categorically deny knowing anything about uh or
[2:08:17.120 --> 2:08:25.920]  a approving of uh and it's it is uh it but it's flung out there now uh suddenly uh they they will
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:31.280]  ride that despite the fact that it's baseless but once it reaches critical mass on twitter
[2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:36.880]  the newsrooms at the new york times and the washington post where the where the new york times
[2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:43.680]  has two thousand reporters working and we're only 20 percent of their output is going on the new york
[2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:51.600]  times uh in the newspaper uh where another 80 percent are going online uh this is also true
[2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:57.760]  at the washington post most by the way extremely profitable digital operations but once they get
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:02.960]  their marching orders from twitter they want to prove they want the approval of the rabble
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:07.760]  they are they are you know they're attuned to the demands of the rabble and these people are just
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:14.160]  like those in the french revolution off with his head man seen with roger stone off with his head
[2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:20.240]  you know roger was crazy as i've been around these new york times writers they are frothing
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:25.040]  with hatred of me i've seen some of them hate you as well they even believe they're bs they're like
[2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:31.360]  mentally ill what happened to these people well alex i saw that they had a new pope a new story
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:36.400]  up about you but unfortunately i wasn't able to read it because i refuse to pay for a subscription
[2:09:37.280 --> 2:09:43.200]  and their stories are behind a paywall i'm not paying these some bitches so if somebody who
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:48.240]  has a subscription wants to uh cut and paste it into an email and send it to me i'll be happy
[2:09:48.240 --> 2:09:54.720]  to read it but i'm not paying for it that's all i read it it's all a bunch of crap but this is just
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:10:01.600]  this is the third attempt to to take me down let's be very clear uh you know i that i had a very
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:09.520]  large tax debt has been a matter of public record for years uh in fact if you go not long ago uh
[2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:15.600]  a lien against me and my life for over one million dollars that was filed in miami dade county where
[2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:24.640]  we do not live uh was uh was uh cancelled uh and then all the media jumped to a trump irs cancels one
[2:10:24.640 --> 2:10:31.040]  million dollar tax debt for stone of course none of them were pointed that it was refiled the very
[2:10:31.040 --> 2:10:38.080]  same day in the county that i do live in for hours so i've gotten no favors but i have been paying
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:44.560]  down this tax debt on a payment plan for over three years sure it's a cheap headline to hurt you
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:49.040]  further and people say okay well yeah that's a war these people stay there we got to go to break
[2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:58.080]  stay there we'll go right back roger stay there epic is one of only a handful of domain registers
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:04.880]  that promote free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech is buying up almost
[2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:10.160]  all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering

[2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:12.880]  go to the doctor they fix it that's not negative i'm not living in denial and so think of globalism
[2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:17.840]  as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet but now it's come to the surface that's
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:23.680]  actually a positive thing and so yeah trump did an overall great job they stole the election we can't
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:30.880]  get down about that we have forced them out in the open so now they're trying to suppress us
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:34.880]  because they know they've been exposed they're scared that's why instead of saying oh we're
[2:12:34.880 --> 2:12:39.120]  a bunch of losers look what happened no we're a bunch of winners they're trying to suppress us

[2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:37.840]  Nancy Pelosi uh giving a pass to maxine waters calling for open insurrection war and what the
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:41.680]  democrats are planning to burn down this country to take over the police departments we'll explain
[2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:46.480]  that next segment but this is like a sci-fi nightmare i couldn't have imagined her in like a
[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:50.720]  space helmet out there and just all the fear and all the lies going back to roger stone you got
[2:13:50.720 --> 2:13:56.640]  cut off by that hard break what were you trying to say my friend uh well alex the way that they
[2:13:56.640 --> 2:14:04.560]  media hyped this i was walking into a uh an event for uh trump arilla in tampa florida in eber city
[2:14:04.560 --> 2:14:10.960]  had a hundred charged up fans i was going to speak about our epic and ongoing fight for liberty
[2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:16.080]  and when my lawyer tried to get through to me a couple times and and told me the news that the
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:21.520]  justice department had filed a civil suit against me claiming that i owed two million dollars in
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:28.000]  taxes that i owe a huge amount of taxes is not a secret uh is a matter of public record i had
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:33.440]  been paying it down for three years on a monthly basis with an escalating size in each monthly
[2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:40.160]  payment until such time that the deep state investigation of me and my legal defense sucked
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:48.400]  me dry and i had no more money to pay them with uh in order to do anything else including uh you
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:55.760]  know drive a car which i don't own so we lost our home our savings most of our insurance the idea
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:02.000]  that we were hoarding or hiding or funneling money is categorically false it is a complete uh
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:06.960]  misrepresentation of what has been done regarding our taxes and how it's for a hundred to get
[2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:11.200]  billions from the ukrainians and the communist chinese and the midis laptops real and it's fine
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:15.280]  to kill the keystone pipeline and smuggle kids in by the hundreds of thousands and it's it's fine
[2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:20.000]  to give them the sex predators but but but your bad from a 15 year old tax debt you've been paying
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:26.400]  down the last three years yes sure i mean it's just it's disgusting well it's not only that but we
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:33.040]  were in good faith negotiations to the irs which suddenly their side went went dark the day after
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:39.680]  joe biden became president how about that so you know obama used the irs a thousand times worse than
[2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:43.680]  hell nixon just had a list of what a hundred something people he was thinking about harassing
[2:15:43.680 --> 2:15:50.000]  obama harassed millions of conservatives thousands of nonprofits with the irs and msnbc said good you
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:56.560]  deserve it we hope you're all arrested they admit to doing what they claim nixon did it's absolutely
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:16:02.880]  true but i mean alexa it is just this is which hunt 3.0 first was the russian collusion hoax
[2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:09.200]  then the january 6 hopes as far as you and i and a number of others know nothing about it don't
[2:16:09.200 --> 2:16:16.960]  approve of it denounced it immediately stupid and then now i have to contend with this it's it's
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:23.200]  legal harassment it is once again the weaponizing of the justice department and i'm being held to
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:30.080]  a different standard this is the most important point which is why is hunter biden oh millions of
[2:16:30.080 --> 2:16:38.160]  dollars why is he just moved into a 2.5 million dollar home that rents for 25 000 a month why
[2:16:38.160 --> 2:16:46.160]  does the reverend now sharpen oh eight million eight million uh why is he not being civilly sued by the
[2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:53.760]  justice department at a minimum uh reverend now is uh is a hell of a dresser but somebody's paying
[2:16:53.760 --> 2:17:00.480]  for those suits so uh the truth of this is that we're on the verge of bankruptcy and i've got to
[2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:05.760]  go out and raise the money to fight this so once again i need to go to the ramparts and ask people
[2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:13.680]  to go to stonedefensefund.com stonedefensefund.com someone in your control room has a uh graphic of
[2:17:13.680 --> 2:17:18.960]  that i uh there you go uh but that's that's from the website which is not what we want to show of
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:26.800]  course uh but in any event uh we are uh you know i am only here as you are alex because of the

[2:27:28.560 --> 2:27:35.040]  shooting of its democrat controlled area and the police are doing their political enforcement
[2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:39.920]  the left wants this is their model they admit this so the police aren't perfect and we don't
[2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:43.840]  defend them when they're not perfect robert barns a lawyer he sued the police a bunch of one when
[2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:49.280]  they're wrong a lot of times jail guards are particularly bad but this is something much
[2:27:49.920 --> 2:27:54.320]  much bigger it's a takeover and and and they really want to burn the country down maxine waters
[2:27:54.320 --> 2:27:58.880]  the rest of we'll talk to him in just a moment but first you know you heard roger stone they're
[2:27:58.880 --> 2:28:03.280]  persecuting and and he's a symbol they want to take down well info wars is a symbol they want to
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:08.960]  take down just as bad probably worse i mean the attacks on us are just insane that's why you need
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:13.840]  to go to info or store.com and get products you already need and realizing it's in defiance to the
[2:28:13.840 --> 2:28:20.160]  tyrants when you buy from us so you have a new big special and the old special was supposed to

[2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:34.160]  adults but especially old folks and people of color need extra vitamins and minerals especially
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:39.600]  vitamin d3 because you only get it from the sun or absorption through the gut at a limited level
[2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:44.880]  and and the mouth particularly we also have winter sun still in stock 40 off taking vitamin d3 out
[2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:52.400]  of the tongue 40 off rocket rest the amazing sleep aid 40 off way stronger than knockout but
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:56.240]  a different formula different strokes different folks are both excellent you know some people

[2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:03.360]  some people want to drive a Ferrari some folks want to drive a forward lpd they're both excellent
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:08.880]  uh an operation in game get our amazing film that exposes the whole global reset 14 years ago

[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:21.280]  in the world get 10 copies at 395 each and make copies and give them to folks operation in game
[2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:28.240]  info war store dot com and all t-shirts 1776 at a bare minimum some are being sold at cost
[2:29:28.240 --> 2:29:35.280]  check it out infowarstore.com all right going back to constitutional lawyer i've also worked
[2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:39.280]  with trump on the whole recount an election fraud expert and we'll get an update with him
[2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:44.240]  next segment on that but this maxine water is coming out calling for be more aggressive more
[2:29:44.240 --> 2:29:49.600]  confrontational national gargets shot at right after uh you've got Cuomo saying we need to kill
[2:29:49.600 --> 2:29:54.160]  white people the cops need to kill white people i mean they are really pushing for something
[2:29:54.160 --> 2:29:59.520]  what are they doing where are they hoping this goes Robert Barnes well you saw it today in the
[2:29:59.520 --> 2:30:04.560]  closing arguments of the prosecution where the prosecution kept telling the jury to quote believe
[2:30:04.560 --> 2:30:10.560]  your eyes and what they really mean is to say believe the media's lies because the chauvin
[2:30:10.560 --> 2:30:15.520]  trial is unique the george floyd death trial is unique and that the degree to which the prosecution
[2:30:15.520 --> 2:30:20.960]  is trying to persuade the world through the jury of the media's fake news narrative
[2:30:20.960 --> 2:30:25.920]  or surrounding the case and so that's why you know and their version of the prosecution's
[2:30:25.920 --> 2:30:30.720]  version of the events that george floyd did nothing wrong he's a hagiographic character
[2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:36.640]  worthy of a great civil rights hero a heroic status whereas chauvin is solely a pure evil
[2:30:36.640 --> 2:30:41.920]  doer who was acting maliciously and malevolently and the problem is the evidence doesn't support
[2:30:41.920 --> 2:30:46.720]  that the evidence refutes that and rebuts that all the way along as the defense cross examination
[2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:51.840]  is going into in great detail so their fear is that when a jury sees the real evidence
[2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:57.200]  they won't believe the media's lies they'll know that they can't trust believe their own eyes because
[2:30:57.200 --> 2:31:02.720]  they were lied to leading up to the trial and that that will lead to the only verdict that the facts
[2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:08.240]  and the law justify in this case which is a not guilty verdict and they're so terrified of that
[2:31:08.240 --> 2:31:14.000]  possibility that's why mad max is up there threatening them just yesterday and over the weekend
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:19.040]  leading up to them going in to sit in the jury saying if you acquit then we're going to riot
[2:31:19.040 --> 2:31:22.960]  we're going to have an increase the level of rioting we're going to increase the level of
[2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:29.280]  quote unquote confrontation we're going to take to the streets in her own words and it was clear
[2:31:29.280 --> 2:31:35.680]  what that meant because she did so in the middle of rioting looting arsons attacks people not even
[2:31:35.680 --> 2:31:40.480]  be able to go back to their own homes in minneapolis so this is the first test case as to the degree
[2:31:40.480 --> 2:31:47.360]  to which the prosecution can gaslight a jury into believing the media's own fake narrative
[2:31:47.360 --> 2:31:53.360]  surrounding a particular crime that has broader social and public policy effects and if they are
[2:31:53.360 --> 2:32:01.040]  unable to do so they're willing to extort the jury through mob threats of mob violence right on the
[2:32:01.040 --> 2:32:05.520]  eve of jury deliberation and so this is like the most revolution where they hyped up the general
[2:32:05.520 --> 2:32:10.080]  public to overthrow things so they would quote all this free stuff but they didn't clearly they
[2:32:10.080 --> 2:32:14.240]  want to take control the police let the police know the media can turn it on like a light switch
[2:32:14.240 --> 2:32:18.400]  and off like a light switch to overthrow your department whenever we want so do what we say
[2:32:18.400 --> 2:32:23.520]  politically go after conservatives go after guns do what we want or we're going to destroy you
[2:32:23.520 --> 2:32:29.360]  i mean the democrats admit that police reform is turning full power over to soros well if you're
[2:32:29.360 --> 2:32:34.640]  a police officer today and you're watching these closing arguments you're terrified at the ability
[2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:40.800]  of the political process to weaponize the prosecutorial process against you even in the least
[2:32:40.800 --> 2:32:47.120]  justifiable circumstances here they're seeking felony murder charges a 40-year state prison
[2:32:47.120 --> 2:32:53.280]  sentence solely for doing something that police officers do all around the world on an almost
[2:32:53.280 --> 2:32:57.440]  daily basis like the slightest footage out of georgia two black cops get caused called
[2:32:57.440 --> 2:33:01.680]  because of black down drugs waving a knife around at people they get there he tries to stab them they
[2:33:01.680 --> 2:33:06.080]  don't defend themselves begging 40 plus times to stop he rushes them again they're killing
[2:33:06.080 --> 2:33:10.560]  and the media is like well maybe the cops are bad i mean how could you even have a job
[2:33:10.560 --> 2:33:14.480]  where you're this paranoid about defending yourself because people now think it's like
[2:33:14.480 --> 2:33:21.360]  heroic to attack the police well i mean and think about what the end game here is because you know
[2:33:21.360 --> 2:33:26.000]  that down deep they don't really want to defund and destroy the police so how do they solve the
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:32.320]  problem of human discretion they're building this up so they can introduce ai and robotic
[2:33:32.320 --> 2:33:37.440]  type police services to no longer have people involved that's what it is yeah humans can't
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:42.240]  drive cars or fail they can't fly planes or fail the military sabotage it can't exactly
[2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:47.280]  this is a post human system they admit it very astute smartest thing i've heard in months that's
[2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:51.520]  true and it works it's going to work very well there's already talked about it in different
[2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:56.480]  places around the world different robot ai capabilities that could provide police services
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:01.200]  because they know they can never fully purge the police and the military and then they'll say oh
[2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:08.320]  sorry it's not a white person it's a robot but who programs it exactly and if they control the
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:13.440]  programming i mean they've tried to have human programming it just doesn't work consistently
[2:34:13.440 --> 2:34:17.600]  and that's their problem they cannot limit the capacity of the human mind and the human
[2:34:17.600 --> 2:34:22.400]  conscience to act on that human mind and the human conscience the two great schools of learning
[2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:27.680]  that no one can close the archives of nature and the rights of man the what god imprinted on our
[2:34:27.680 --> 2:34:32.080]  soul and what god imprinted on the world around us these are schools that can't close but they
[2:34:32.080 --> 2:34:36.480]  could close them if they just have robots they get to completely program completely control
[2:34:36.480 --> 2:34:40.800]  the programming oven for and this is what this looks like it's building for it's to make it
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:47.360]  impossible to be a policeman to make it so that no rational person would want to be a fighter jet
[2:34:47.360 --> 2:34:52.400]  and transgender training all of it is to sabotage human readiness human cohesion everything is
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:58.000]  a sabotage the human system it's ultimately the goals that were no different the matrix was
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:03.200]  foresightful as a film that the goal is to ultimately treat humans as nothing more than consumers
[2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:09.840]  not even labor providers as simply docile uh deferential consumers to the state and and basically
[2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:15.840]  like in a machine just batteries exactly batteries i mean literally like like batteries and that's
[2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:19.360]  how they and that's how they see that's how a lot of the people in the system view us in particular
[2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:24.000]  the big tech people view humanity your bill gates of the world don't see human beings
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:28.080]  they see little automatons they see little pieces on the can they say that stay there
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:33.120]  robert barnes let's talk about how we counter this how far off are we to a verdict probably
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:38.400]  what's gonna happen that the democrats are priming violence everywhere uh and then meanwhile whining
[2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:43.760]  about the capital all day long the paradox is incredible hypocrisy robert barnes straight
[2:35:43.760 --> 2:35:50.880]  out of all the shows within foe wars dot com and news wars dot com did you share the link today
[2:35:53.280 --> 2:35:59.520]  every product you hear me on air advertising we have it stock in our warehouse in austin texas

[2:36:04.720 --> 2:36:09.600]  lizards get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's bringing down
[2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:16.480]  and its future orders its product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're having trouble
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:22.880]  with i'm talking about double triple quadruple delivery times and it's across not just the
[2:36:22.880 --> 2:36:28.160]  supplement vitamin mineral industry it's across every industry so the globalists have successfully
[2:36:28.160 --> 2:36:34.080]  devastated the economy that's why i'm saying you need to visit info or store dot com today and get
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:39.200]  high quality supplements while you still can and storeable food at info or store dot com because we

[2:36:57.120 --> 2:37:03.760]  as things can be you have to understand that this is all a test this experience this life on this
[2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:11.440]  planet is a reckoning it's god giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension
[2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:17.120]  so we can decide where we want to spend eternity at what level we want to go to and it really does
[2:37:17.120 --> 2:37:22.080]  come down to that so as sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:28.400]  world as well and realize that god is the author of our consciousness god is the author of us having
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:35.600]  our own will god is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing
[2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:39.440]  and when you look at mainstream media in hollywood and this whole evil culture
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:45.600]  in washington dc and fauci and the and the mass cult it's all about dominating your free will

[2:40:24.480 --> 2:40:29.200]  you've got max keiser pop it up for two segments because it's a huge reversal channel
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:34.240]  calls bitcoin investment alternative after years of crackdowns then salinity takes over for about
[2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:39.680]  45 minutes and then i think i'm going to get on the war room with all of today because the admission
[2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:44.960]  they've had to close not one but several of the emergency migrant centers because of rapes and
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:51.520]  murders and they tried to deny that to the governor and now on the dead of night um friday night
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:57.360]  we learned about till saturday it broke they moved thousands of girls out of a use of facility
[2:40:57.360 --> 2:41:03.920]  little girls ages 12 and up to 17 because it was a murder someone killed not just rape
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:08.080]  and they've moved them to secret locations they've got jets landing in secret this is all human
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:15.200]  smuggling and the new york times is an article going jones was shut down by a nun helping children
[2:41:15.200 --> 2:41:22.000]  he's faking a nun with angel of death tattoos on every limb illegally putting people on planes
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:27.440]  with no background check it's all illegal idiots of the new york times the whole thing it's all
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:32.320]  coming down like a house of cards biden now admits it's a crisis the fbi admits it's all
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:37.520]  illegal it's just insane uh but biden got told to charge the border i'll ask barns about that
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:43.120]  the moment but barns this big plan of the democrats to burn down the cities how do we stop it what
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:48.640]  do you expect to happen you know being knowing a lot of sources uh you know final arguments
[2:41:48.640 --> 2:41:53.680]  happening today and tomorrow how long do you think the deliberation will be and then how
[2:41:53.680 --> 2:41:58.640]  do democrats get away with the fact if he isn't convicted what's going to happen if he is convicted
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:04.960]  what happens so the closing arguments will wrap up today the jury will get its final instructions
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:10.480]  today and they will begin their deliberations today their deliberations will be sequestered
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:15.520]  so they will be uh not you know they won't be allowed to go home uh after today after today
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:21.920]  they have to stay in an isolated location until they make a verdict i think it will be
[2:42:21.920 --> 2:42:27.040]  usually if the jury comes back quickly that usually means connection in a case like this
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:31.920]  not always the oj verdict was also was a quick verdict it was acquittals but normally it means
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:38.720]  a conviction jury if it's quick if it takes all week then it's more likely going to be either
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:44.400]  a hung jury or at least partial acquittals or maybe full acquittals the minnesota school system
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:49.680]  uh in fear of what might happen in response to the verdict has shut down their schools for the
[2:42:49.680 --> 2:42:54.240]  rest of the week so that gives you an idea of what they think is coming uh people that have
[2:42:54.240 --> 2:43:00.000]  been close observers have said that they believe there's a real chance of acquittal those lawyers
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:04.880]  who fall the case in detail think that's actually the proper outcome but the media has been pitching
[2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:10.240]  a different story so the country as a whole is completely on here's the deal even if he's guilty
[2:43:10.240 --> 2:43:14.560]  which overall i don't think he did it on purpose floy was all in the drugs i mean i think bare
[2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:20.640]  minimum manslaughter tell me what you think but regardless once polosi saying you better convict
[2:43:20.640 --> 2:43:24.160]  once waters are saying be violent if it's not convicted once they give twenty seven million
[2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:29.680]  dollars to the family once they run millions in psas the city does saying he's guilty this is
[2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:35.200]  public jury tampering in the old days i'm not a lawyer like you but if the paper leak details
[2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:40.880]  or if locals said things that could get to the jury you missed trial now it's like soviet show
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:47.760]  trials it's very much a soviet show show trial because the in fact they could have got a plea
[2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:52.880]  deal before the case even began where chauvin was willing to do ten years in prison which is
[2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:58.480]  longer than normal for facts like these if he was a private citizen and this had led to a death it
[2:43:58.480 --> 2:44:02.960]  would have normally been a five to six year sentence in circumstances like these and they
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:10.000]  turned it down because they wanted a a show trial with a big verdict with a crazy sentence that they
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:15.680]  could use to terrorize the rest of the world into political compliance including the police
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:21.120]  and so that's why we're here i think from a legal perspective there's issues with causation it doesn't
[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:27.280]  appear that chauvin actually caused floyd's death that a combination of a drug overdose a heart problem
[2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:34.240]  and a tumor likely caused floyd's death in the same sense it does not appear that chauvin intended
[2:44:34.240 --> 2:44:39.120]  to cause any serious bodily harm or bodily yeah why would you want to kill somebody and call blood
[2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:44.800]  go to prison exactly well i mean he knew during this entire time that he's being watched by dozens
[2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:49.600]  of people he's being videotaped by his own body cameras videotaped by the body cameras of his
[2:44:49.600 --> 2:44:54.640]  fellow officers yeah he looked bad he died of a drug overdose it looks like he killed him he didn't
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:59.760]  him correct and what they did is the media hid the key evidence the fact that floyd was saying he
[2:44:59.760 --> 2:45:05.200]  couldn't breathe or he was afraid to die for 25 minutes long before he was ever on the ground
[2:45:05.680 --> 2:45:09.680]  well so the the idea that it was because he was on the ground that he was saying these things
[2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:14.480]  simply not true they can hear him repeatedly saying i'm gonna die i can't breathe i've gotten
[2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:18.480]  judgments you've been involved in big cases where particularly jail guards kill people
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:24.080]  i mean so so you're you the real bad stuff happens but the media goes around looking for
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:30.000]  stuff now to exercise their power over culture and create explosions and divert from the globalist
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:35.600]  robbing us all it's like what they did to trump for four years it's a fake narrative they took a
[2:45:35.600 --> 2:45:40.720]  tiny slice of the story stripped it of all its context and so that people didn't know the whole
[2:45:40.720 --> 2:45:45.200]  story that people did people would have known from the beginning that george floyd was saying i
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:49.760]  can't breathe while he's sitting in the back of a car well if that he was saying oh i'm going to
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:56.320]  please put me on the ground repeatedly about more than about a half a dozen times he says please
[2:45:56.320 --> 2:46:01.600]  put him on the ground so if they would have known that he was uh making those complaints long before
[2:46:01.600 --> 2:46:07.040]  he was on the ground that he actually asked to be placed on the ground that he while he was on the
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:12.720]  ground he kicks and kicks and kicks for minutes and that in fact it isn't the only time he stops
[2:46:12.720 --> 2:46:17.600]  resisting appears to have been when he died because he may have been experiencing a heart attack from
[2:46:17.600 --> 2:46:24.240]  a overdose of a sudden ingestion of a lethal amount of fentanyl just minutes before this
[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:29.760]  with that let's be clear maybe the handcuffs push him over the edge black people call the cops on
[2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:34.240]  him so i mean you know the cops get called to do this and i'm not worshiping the cops there's
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:39.360]  some bad cops out there but they get called they deal with this he dies then it's their fault
[2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:45.840]  well yeah he said they've deliberately chosen a divisive case which blm does a lot of blm chooses
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:50.080]  cases where you dig into the facts and you find out it's a lie what they've told you know as mark
[2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:55.680]  dice had a little video saying black lies matter about what the media does involving blm cases and
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:47:00.720]  that's true in my cases where i had abusive cops misconduct including against african-american
[2:47:00.720 --> 2:47:05.360]  defendant blm refused to help because they don't want a case that unites people they want a case
[2:47:05.360 --> 2:47:10.080]  that divides people and that's why they took selective and i'll say this they say it's on the
[2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:15.040]  back i think the cops exhausted wrestling over 25 minutes it knows him isn't paying attention
[2:47:15.760 --> 2:47:20.560]  does this all the time gets on one carotid i mean i think it contributed probably he obviously
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:24.160]  didn't want this to happen he obviously thinks that it kills somebody in front of 50 people
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:29.040]  i mean it no it just it's a mess i mean it's like this latest guy that got shot he's out
[2:47:29.040 --> 2:47:33.520]  there after him on arm robbery he's fighting with the cops he says pull taser she pulls the wrong
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:38.640]  i mean it's hysteria what and what's going to happen during riots nationwide and the blow-up
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:41.440]  you know some innocent people are going to get killed where they're going to have the
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:47.120]  ongoing cycle for the media oh exactly i think that's the goal and the objective to have constant
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:53.280]  recycled stories of partially fed media narratives now their big risk is if the jury comes back and
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:58.080]  votes not guilty in the fluid case the reason why they're paranoid of that result is it might
[2:47:58.080 --> 2:48:02.880]  lead at least some percentage of the public to dig in deeper and realize how much the media is
[2:48:02.880 --> 2:48:06.800]  lying to them and has been lying to them and lead them to distrust the media so that's why
[2:48:06.800 --> 2:48:11.920]  they're scared they need this fake narrative to keep recycling and recycling and recycling
[2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:19.600]  and they need a jury particularly a liberal democratic jury that is a half minority jury
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:25.040]  they need that jury especially to come back and vote convict across the board if they don't
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:29.200]  it means that people are going to at least some portion of the public's going to be like hold on
[2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:33.600]  a second i'm telling you and let's go back to the latest guy what's the guy's name the
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:37.200]  black young black man that just got shot in minnesota's welder in the riots and
[2:48:37.200 --> 2:48:42.080]  had a warrant for his arrest uh i believe it's don't tell you right don't tell you right i believe
[2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:46.960]  nothing against women i can't have a baby i don't look pretty like they do and women at the olympics
[2:48:46.960 --> 2:48:51.920]  are just as good as shots as men or better but women have three times the connections between
[2:48:51.920 --> 2:48:56.000]  left and right hemisphere that's why they've never been in the military in any military that operates
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:01.520]  so in a crisis women get hysterical and make more mistakes and men men make a lot of mistakes
[2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:06.000]  you know fumble of football whatever but she says pulling taser men have done that too
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:09.920]  but statistically women make the mistake more she's all adrenaline it's all crazy
[2:49:09.920 --> 2:49:14.480]  pulling taser pulls a gun and shooting well that's because women have three times the connection
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:19.920]  between left and right hemisphere the science shows women make more of those mistakes hence why
[2:49:19.920 --> 2:49:24.000]  you see women with a higher rate of mistakes in law enforcement she sure as hell didn't kill
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:29.520]  him on purpose she's going to prison why would she do that well you know what the system's uh
[2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:33.200]  answer is going to be it's going to be that there's too much of a risk of human error
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:37.680]  even though they help create that error by creating a uh doing a taser that looks and
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:42.080]  feels like a gun the local political vendors that's what they did uh sort of putting her
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:45.760]  in this potential risk they're going to come back and say the solution to all this is to not have
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:49.600]  human beings with power but i've noticed a lot of the tasers look like guns now that's dangerous
[2:49:49.600 --> 2:49:54.560]  completely they were they were not supposed to do that but it appears like they keep setting the
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:59.520]  system up where these people have no choice but to fail because it appears that the real answer
[2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:05.280]  is neither no police nor more police it's to have automated police it's to have AI police it's to
[2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:09.680]  have robotic police that are completely in the subservient control that's right you can't have
[2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:13.440]  humans making a mistake with a car robots gotta do it can't have cops making a mistake can't have
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:17.760]  military that's the whole plan they admit it you're on to the key robert barnes going to be popping

[2:51:48.320 --> 2:51:53.440]  would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[2:51:53.440 --> 2:51:58.320]  wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee
[2:51:58.320 --> 2:52:05.120]  and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my life they
[2:52:05.120 --> 2:52:11.360]  had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted
[2:52:11.360 --> 2:52:18.400]  to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse
[2:52:18.400 --> 2:52:26.080]  nine then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:32.560]  nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:37.840]  hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding
[2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:42.800]  of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created this country
[2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:52.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:53:12.800 --> 2:53:22.960]  oh
[2:53:26.880 --> 2:53:31.200]  all right there's a lot of big breaking video but one thing i didn't get to
[2:53:31.200 --> 2:53:47.920]  do was this particular clip that is bone showing and that is sick video children paraded on stage
[2:53:47.920 --> 2:53:53.680]  at late night drag queen show in california this is a bunch of little boys i guess as young as h10
[2:53:53.680 --> 2:53:58.000]  dressed up like girls shaking their ass to a bunch of men that throw money at them
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:04.800]  and i can't show much of this it gets here it's it's really really bad but this is the dehumanization
[2:54:04.800 --> 2:54:09.520]  this is the destruction of our youth and this is pure satanism and this is what god hates
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:18.560]  meanwhile i've got all these articles where they're having to shut down migrant centers
[2:54:18.560 --> 2:54:23.760]  because of death and rape taking place use a facility for migrant girls 30 to 17 abruptly
[2:54:23.760 --> 2:54:29.040]  shuttered them in concerns employee death rapes you name it prove the governor right we're going
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:33.200]  to play this clip that we got max keiser coming on we just got him connected with some huge news
[2:54:33.200 --> 2:54:38.320]  but here's what's going on with our children why in the hell do these people got these little
[2:54:38.320 --> 2:54:58.480]  big ass kids at this drag show y'all but it's 11 40 at night if people have children in a drag show

[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:18.800]  look at this look at this
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:23.680]  those children are trophies i'm gonna give them this more later after we're done talking
[2:55:24.480 --> 2:55:29.040]  to max keiser but the story's up on info wars dot com now shifting gears
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:36.160]  we're joined by max keiser for this little segment the next segment to talk about this
[2:55:36.160 --> 2:55:41.120]  zero hedge article it's also in the times of london cnbc is reporting it in a huge reversal
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:47.200]  china now calls bitcoin investment alternative after years of crackdown so is this bitcoin
[2:55:47.200 --> 2:55:53.840]  capitulation by the communist chinese is just the biggest move yet in sovereign systems joining
[2:55:53.840 --> 2:56:00.080]  bitcoin max keiser yeah alex uh it sure is you know i've been saying this for a number of years
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:07.440]  that we are heading to a bitcoin war uh you know he who has the most bitcoin will make the laws
[2:56:07.440 --> 2:56:12.480]  will rule the world and china understands this i think they've known it for quite some time
[2:56:13.040 --> 2:56:19.120]  and they're making their move so over the weekend we had a big crash in the miners that are in china
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:25.680]  that took 25 of the mining capacity offline there was a 10 15 correction in the price of bitcoin
[2:56:25.680 --> 2:56:30.720]  because of this move in china uh it looks like now china is using that as an opportunity to
[2:56:30.720 --> 2:56:35.040]  accumulate bitcoin they just came out with this announcement that they now see bitcoin as an
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:40.560]  investable asset they're also importing hundreds of tons of gold very recently so i think we're
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:45.920]  going to see china make a move with a gold back digital currency central bank digital currency
[2:56:45.920 --> 2:56:52.080]  well that'll attract a lot of capital from around the world and start hoarding and mining bitcoin
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:57.760]  because they realized that in the 21st century we're heading into the hash wars or the the global
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:03.440]  bitcoin wars uh where countries the country with the most bitcoin will win essentially world war
[2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:08.240]  three it used to be territorial it used to be gold used to have armies that used to be the
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:13.680]  definition of your nation state but now it's going to be bitcoin bitcoin is going to define who
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:18.640]  is the world war b well you were on three weeks ago and again two weeks ago and you said
[2:57:19.280 --> 2:57:24.160]  as soon as china signs on the u.s will completely sign on when we come back with that inside
[2:57:24.160 --> 2:57:28.800]  knowledge or how did you know and in fact if we got the crew somebody ought to go somebody should
[2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:34.320]  go back to him almost three weeks ago two weeks ago where he said that because it's happening
[2:57:34.320 --> 2:57:39.040]  right now but listeners all heard it you all saw it we'll talk to max keiser in one minute
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:44.400]  and see how he knew that when we come back i'm alex jones with info wars dot com and news wars
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:49.040]  dot com and you can find me at swan bitcoin dot com holds my balance
[2:57:52.480 --> 2:57:59.680]  the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big pharma they control
[2:57:59.680 --> 2:58:06.800]  academia they control the military industrial complex they control big tech and everywhere
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:11.920]  that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute total
[2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:19.040]  despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea of human freedom that ended
[2:58:19.040 --> 2:58:24.000]  slavery and then promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:30.400]  they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:37.200]  the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens
[2:58:37.200 --> 2:58:42.480]  their monopoly so control that's why they target info wars because we understand the
[2:58:42.480 --> 2:58:47.360]  keys to defeating them but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info
[2:58:47.360 --> 2:59:03.920]  wars and that video so we double your efforts we're all in this together live from austin
[2:59:03.920 --> 2:59:12.880]  texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones all right we've got one segment with max keiser
[2:59:12.880 --> 2:59:17.680]  who was on three weeks ago and again two weeks ago and he said there will be bitcoin capitulation
[2:59:17.680 --> 2:59:23.520]  will end up being the world currency he said i expect china will soon reverse itself claiming
[2:59:23.520 --> 2:59:28.480]  it's against bitcoin and go for bitcoin he goes i'm only wondering if the federal reserve will
[2:59:28.480 --> 2:59:32.800]  capitulate first so you called it again three weeks ago when nobody else was saying that
[2:59:33.680 --> 2:59:37.440]  you told me 10 years ago get involved in bitcoin told me two years ago do it i mean
[2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:41.760]  you've definitely got your ear on the ground and beyond that how did you make the prediction
[2:59:41.760 --> 2:59:47.360]  how big is this move by china well i've been studying bitcoin for 10 years i've been investing in
[2:59:47.360 --> 2:59:52.560]  bitcoin since it was a dollar as you know and there's a part of bitcoin which is called game
[2:59:52.560 --> 2:59:57.360]  theory and where all the incentives that make the network are equally balanced and it attracts
[2:59:57.360 --> 3:00:02.960]  all players global players corporate players municipal players to try to game the system
[3:00:02.960 --> 3:00:08.000]  and it all ends up in the same way people accumulating bitcoin is the way you game the system
[3:00:08.000 --> 3:00:13.040]  so i knew that this would graduate to the nation state level and i knew that china is looking for
[3:00:13.040 --> 3:00:18.560]  a way to get out of the us dollar as world reserve currency because the us dollar is weaponized by the
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:23.680]  us government with sanctions and other things so going forward all fiat money around the world
[3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:28.400]  is going to be retired the dollar yuan euro it's all going to be retired as part of what they call
[3:00:28.400 --> 3:00:34.320]  the great reset or the new brenton woods and we're going to go to a new global bitcoin standard
[3:00:34.320 --> 3:00:39.680]  and so smart countries like china are preparing themselves for the global bitcoin standard
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:45.120]  by starting now to accumulate bitcoin they already have a nice percentage of the mining of bitcoin
[3:00:45.120 --> 3:00:51.680]  in china but other countries are open to start competing with them in texas now you have a lot
[3:00:51.680 --> 3:00:56.480]  of bitcoin miners because the energy costs in texas are very cheap so the us if they want to be
[3:00:56.480 --> 3:01:01.040]  competitive they need to subsidize bitcoin mining right now they need to make it an initiative they
[3:01:01.040 --> 3:01:05.760]  need to understand that the world war three is going to be played out in terms of bitcoin
[3:01:05.760 --> 3:01:10.480]  and and they need they stopped looking backwards and fighting yesterday's war they need to fight
[3:01:10.480 --> 3:01:17.280]  today's war and get into the bitcoin competition to own as much as possible before they find
[3:01:17.280 --> 3:01:23.120]  themselves completely out of the out of the race alex explain the latest dip in bitcoin you were
[3:01:23.120 --> 3:01:29.200]  doing before the break with some stations joined us right so over the weekend there was a fire in
[3:01:29.200 --> 3:01:36.000]  china and some of the coal miners went down and a lot of the mining that goes on that's the amount
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:42.480]  of electricity that you're creating bitcoin is in china and it went offline and so you had a dip
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:48.240]  in price because the electrical capacity of the network went down two things came out of this number
[3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:53.040]  one it shows that actually the percentage of concentration of mining of bitcoin is less
[3:01:53.040 --> 3:01:58.080]  than people thought number two as of may 1st you'll have what's called a difficulty adjustment
[3:01:58.080 --> 3:02:03.280]  which would just readjust the network to account for this slippage in energy output
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:10.000]  and number three it also at the same time china said that they actually have reversed their
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:16.480]  position they are now looking at bitcoin as a reserve currency and that is a big signal to the
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:22.240]  world this is kind of like the shot heard around the world this is what is now i think officially
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:27.760]  started global hash war and so the u.s. is hopefully they'll get into it sooner than later
[3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:33.440]  china has now fly the bitcoin flag and they're saying look where would you go this was about
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:40.960]  to happen you said it was imminent well you know i i keep my ear to the ground uh peter teal made
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:46.960]  a big speech in washington last week and said that he encouraged policymakers in washington
[3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:52.880]  to be aware of what's happening in china and bitcoin so he was also aware of what was happening
[3:02:52.880 --> 3:02:58.160]  and he's trying to get the message through to policymakers in washington that this is happening
[3:02:58.160 --> 3:03:03.360]  now they need to take this seriously right now or they're going to find themselves at a huge
[3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:08.240]  disadvantage bitcoin is the scarcest commodity in the world it's emerging as a world reserve
[3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:15.120]  currency it has no counterparty risk the verification is in the transaction it's better than gold
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:19.920]  and cross innumerable different variables and it's becoming the world reserve standard
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:25.040]  and what will happen is all other currencies around the world will essentially be backed or
[3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:31.040]  built on top of the bitcoin layer uh in china they're hedging their bets because they're also
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:36.000]  bringing in hundreds more tons of gold and i think that they're going to announce that their
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:41.360]  central bank digital currency will be backed by gold but it's right it shows me the dollar and
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:46.000]  other major currencies are weak and inflated that gold and bitcoin that all these institutions
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:51.040]  are rushing into it well the figure out money are all going to be retired because they realize that
[3:03:51.040 --> 3:03:56.720]  there's no way to keep printing debt to get out of a debt problem and is that why they're so busy
[3:03:56.720 --> 3:04:02.240]  trying to quote everybody free money right now is a politically good and get it well they're trying
[3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:10.160]  to politically paper over the fact that the american economy is effectively insolvent and
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:17.600]  that there's no way to create any gdp sufficient to pay down the debt that america has so they're
[3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:23.440]  going to reserve mean to say we're at an inflection point means that they have painted themselves
[3:04:23.440 --> 3:04:29.040]  into a corner and that there's no way that they can use any policy tool not even negative interest
[3:04:29.040 --> 3:04:35.200]  rates to create enough gdp or enough economic activity to solve the debt problem the debt
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:41.120]  problem is now is officially according to the central bankers intractable it's unsolvable
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:45.920]  and they are going to have to get rid of all the fiat money simultaneously around the world
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:51.600]  and bring in a whole new reset and part of that what china is saying is you know what we're going
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:55.600]  to front run you guys and we're going to buy bitcoin because we know at the end of the day
[3:04:55.600 --> 3:05:00.160]  gold's not going to solve your problem you're all going to end up into a bitcoin standard so we're
[3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:06.320]  going to be there first haha you know and they're making a right move alex what is elon musk doing
[3:05:06.320 --> 3:05:12.800]  pushing this other coin well that's a bit of a toy that he likes to have fun with it's not a
[3:05:12.800 --> 3:05:18.560]  serious project it's it's it can blow up at any second anything that's not bitcoin is essentially
[3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:24.480]  kids playing around in silken valley with toys they're projects that are unsound or they're
[3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:30.480]  not secure and it's the reddit board the wall street bets guys they like playing around with these
[3:05:30.480 --> 3:05:36.720]  online with these different things so you can't compare the two um bitcoin is comparable to gold
[3:05:36.720 --> 3:05:40.640]  and everything else it's not bitcoin you have to look at it like just another fiat money it's just
[3:05:40.640 --> 3:05:46.880]  another toy money play money and they come and they go and there's thousands of them and uh it's
[3:05:46.880 --> 3:05:53.200]  their knockoffs they're right they're well when folks go to info wars dot com they see a bitcoin
[3:05:53.200 --> 3:05:57.440]  icon that pops up and you make donations to us there in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency to

[3:06:12.480 --> 3:06:16.080]  for years i should have done it years ago he told me about it but we are now a lot of folks are

[3:06:27.360 --> 3:06:32.720]  what else would you like to impart to us oh great oracle and wizard of bitcoin max keiser
[3:06:34.160 --> 3:06:37.840]  well ask me anything you know i'm here to answer your questions you know i've been
[3:06:38.400 --> 3:06:42.480]  well it was three weeks ago china is probably about to get big into bitcoin and the government
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:48.240]  just basically endorsed it so how's the federal reserve respond to that well they're they're
[3:06:48.240 --> 3:06:53.360]  panicking and so they're bringing people like peter teal and others who have the you know some
[3:06:53.360 --> 3:06:57.440]  knowledge about this so they're trying to figure out a strategy but you know they're in america
[3:06:57.440 --> 3:07:03.040]  is caught up in a cultural war similar to what china went through in the 1950s where the left is
[3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:11.280]  trying to create essentially a dystopian nightmarish state of conformity where all individualism
[3:07:11.280 --> 3:07:15.600]  and free thought is canceled so that's what their preoccupation is right now and we know
[3:07:15.600 --> 3:07:19.440]  yeah they're fighting the last war they've already conquered america but they want to
[3:07:19.440 --> 3:07:23.840]  hurt the midwest so bad and hurt the churches and because they've taught this at the universities
[3:07:23.840 --> 3:07:29.680]  that they're not even involved in reality they're fighting the last war alex exactly china is is
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:36.880]  emerging and starting the current war with the current weapon they're massing bitcoin and without
[3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:43.680]  it america is going to find itself completely uh as we used to say an old expression sucking
[3:07:43.680 --> 3:07:48.080]  hind tit i don't know if that's politically correct no it's been sucking on a little titty
[3:07:49.120 --> 3:07:53.920]  that means you're way back in the line you know you're at the end of the ringers up top yeah you
[3:07:53.920 --> 3:07:58.640]  don't well it's just i don't know a bore or anything but the hind tip even on a cow that's the little
[3:07:58.640 --> 3:08:04.480]  one that yep you're on the end of the receiving line you know america if they want to stay
[3:08:04.480 --> 3:08:10.240]  irrelevant what the relevant they need to understand that what's happening and start amassing
[3:08:10.240 --> 3:08:15.840]  and start a policy where they're going to start subsidizing mining uh and and start to accumulate
[3:08:15.840 --> 3:08:21.200]  a big big position otherwise you know f i think teddy roosevelt said speak softly and carry a big
[3:08:21.200 --> 3:08:26.240]  stick that's going to be speak softly and have a big bitcoin position well i'll tell you what shows
[3:08:26.240 --> 3:08:30.880]  you how things are trump was bad for standing up in china then biden is like waffling and does it
[3:08:30.880 --> 3:08:35.760]  gets his ass kicked it just shows they want the power without actually exercising it max geyser
[3:08:35.760 --> 3:08:40.400]  thanks for the time we'll talk to you again soon all righty thanks alex jerry palente takes over
[3:08:40.400 --> 3:08:45.760]  just a few minutes and he's always loaded for bear so get ready for jerry palente and don't forget
[3:08:45.760 --> 3:08:53.040]  what james o' cube talks about here with us on here it's cute the people are awakening they're
[3:08:53.040 --> 3:08:58.160]  taking control of their own environment cell phones are an amazing tool really they're a
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:03.600]  super computer that's handheld but big tech large corporations hackers governments foreign
[3:09:03.600 --> 3:09:09.680]  governments the chai comms especially are using this to steal your data to share your data to
[3:09:09.680 --> 3:09:14.480]  be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data they can actually
[3:09:14.480 --> 3:09:21.600]  predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements cutting them out of that data stream
[3:09:21.600 --> 3:09:27.520]  absolutely devastates their ai takeover in their own words they admit it so i've been selling
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:32.000]  privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade and now the units
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:36.240]  have gotten really lightweight they're faraday cages they just look like a cloth on the lobe they
[3:09:36.240 --> 3:09:41.840]  work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:46.000]  over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to

[3:12:09.280 --> 3:12:13.280]  you know they're they're selling this uh covet war and they just don't stop with it
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:20.640]  um this is a headline from ap global covet 19 debts surpass three million
[3:12:20.640 --> 3:12:28.240]  all right this is for over a year so they keep adding them up so last year it's not like this
[3:12:28.240 --> 3:12:34.080]  starting the new year and saying how many covet debts this year no they're just adding them up
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:41.440]  and adding them up so let's look at some of the covet other debts that aren't covet related
[3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:51.360]  about eight point seven million people died of air pollution last year now do they add those
[3:12:51.360 --> 3:12:59.440]  up every year for the last century probably you got you know how many millions could have been
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:09.520]  dead by them how many people are dying of um pesticide poisoning each year do they add those
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:17.200]  up each year about 200 000 americans died last year of air pollution how about the year before the
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:22.720]  year before the year before the year before how come they don't add that up i'll tell you why
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:26.480]  because they're low life pieces of scum crap selling fear in austria
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:33.520]  the this is the kind of headlines that are going out
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:39.920]  out to the wall street journal new york city targets reluctant residents for coven oculate
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:47.680]  inoculations how dare you be a reluctant resident why don't you swallow the crap that
[3:13:47.680 --> 3:13:55.760]  they're shoving down your throat and boy are they shoving it down my generation the baby boomers
[3:13:55.760 --> 3:14:07.280]  forget about it totally sold out cats man and kittens you look at the numbers some 80 percent
[3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:27.040]  of them have gotten the shot that's right 80 percent and almost 70 two shots but yet fouchy at nascar
[3:14:27.040 --> 3:14:37.040]  white house looks to appeal to vaccine hesitant conservatives and evangelicals
[3:14:40.480 --> 3:14:46.560]  white house press secretary jen sake said the biden administration was looking
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:53.840]  ways to conduct outreach to white conservative communities where coronavirus vaccine hesitancy
[3:14:53.840 --> 3:15:03.520]  runs high what does it have to do with being an evangelical or white
[3:15:04.640 --> 3:15:10.160]  or being in a political story has nothing to do with it there are people that don't want to get
[3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:15.200]  the vaccination because number one it has not been approved by the food drug administration
[3:15:15.200 --> 3:15:24.400]  this is an emergency act operation warped speed so to me you have to be warped to take the facts and
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:29.760]  then it goes on this is from i want to read you this this is from the financial times
[3:15:33.520 --> 3:15:36.800]  on the 17th so this is an ancient
[3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:48.160]  current covid vaccines you ready show government can be a force for good this is by

[3:21:17.920 --> 3:21:23.840]  i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus sustained as to where we are right now this is
[3:21:23.840 --> 3:21:31.920]  matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall
[3:21:31.920 --> 3:21:38.560]  be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one
[3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:43.920]  another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's
[3:21:43.920 --> 3:21:48.160]  name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it

[3:29:32.160 --> 3:29:38.720]  we have reason to be hopeful however until more of the u.s population is fully vaccinated
[3:29:38.720 --> 3:29:45.440]  consistent use of prevention strategies ready such as universal and correct use of masks
[3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:52.240]  not correct use of masks you mean these masks that everybody are wearing these these ones with

[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:13.040]  in the sun like me i was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since
[3:36:13.040 --> 3:36:18.880]  taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think
[3:36:18.880 --> 3:36:25.360]  i'm 55 years old and i was already taking your other supplements but i thought you know well
[3:36:25.360 --> 3:36:29.920]  maybe that's what i need to do because i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i
[3:36:29.920 --> 3:36:34.720]  started taking it i mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time
[3:36:34.720 --> 3:36:40.560]  i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is wonderful you know i don't
[3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:47.440]  i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really
[3:36:47.440 --> 3:36:56.400]  has totally cleared up my skin epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote
[3:36:56.400 --> 3:37:01.920]  free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech is buying up almost all the
[3:37:01.920 --> 3:37:06.880]  other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering
[3:37:06.880 --> 3:37:11.600]  that's why they've been massively expanding their services so whether you have domains or want to
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:16.880]  register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other major service they've
[3:37:16.880 --> 3:37:22.720]  got it all and they're expanding and if you go to info wars domains dot com and follow that link
[3:37:22.720 --> 3:37:28.960]  you get all their services at the lowest price and 25 percent of your sign up for a new domain or a
[3:37:28.960 --> 3:37:34.160]  domain you move goes to fund the info war and then we get five percent as well for any servers or
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:39.520]  any other type of services that you get from them so it's a win-win as we build a true open free
[3:37:39.520 --> 3:37:43.440]  internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free
[3:37:43.440 --> 3:37:50.560]  so info wars domains dot com the revolution starts there info wars domains dot com take action now

[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:11.440]  what we do with the trends journal and again just as you support the uh info wars of course if you
[3:40:11.440 --> 3:40:16.720]  want to know what's going on what it means and what's next there's no magazine like the trends
[3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:21.520]  journal last one was 175 pages because i can't read on just sorry but you don't have to read the
[3:40:21.520 --> 3:40:27.120]  whole thing you read what you want it's about the economy i'm gonna stop on the economy right now
[3:40:27.120 --> 3:40:34.960]  geopolitics are going to the economy the markets down today the markets are totally inflated the
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:40.640]  markets are going to stay high as long as interest rates stay low and the story is going to keep
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:46.160]  pumping cheap money and they'll do anything they can to keep pumping them up uh the bitcoin you
[3:40:46.160 --> 3:40:53.120]  know we're looking at it to go easily 100 000 plus again that's if the governments don't come in
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:58.720]  and try to stop it from happening just like they made us make people bring turn in their goal to the
[3:40:58.720 --> 3:41:06.560]  government 1933 when fdr came in so absent government intervention bitcoin's going to
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:11.360]  keep going and the money that's going into cryptocurrencies is not going into gold and
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:16.720]  silver however gold and silver prices are going to keep going up because now more central banks
[3:41:16.720 --> 3:41:24.080]  are buying it and also india which is one of the biggest jewelry makers of gold people love it
[3:41:24.080 --> 3:41:33.600]  and china same thing you buy it up more and more gold gold silver bitcoin those are and the other
[3:41:33.600 --> 3:41:39.600]  cryptocurrencies and i'm not an expert in that field in which ones are going to keep moving higher
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:43.520]  people are going to be looking for alternatives for those that know the whole thing is a fraud
[3:41:44.960 --> 3:41:49.840]  and talking about the fraud and how they're putting the numbers so in the united states
[3:41:49.840 --> 3:41:55.840]  582 000 people died of the virus this is over a year ago they keep adding the numbers up
[3:41:55.840 --> 3:42:00.480]  but they don't keep adding the numbers up of what you die from eating from pesticides and
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:06.800]  all the crap that they're putting it off they don't put that in air pollution now so you know
[3:42:06.800 --> 3:42:20.080]  what the death rate is in the united states it's a nation of 332 550 000 people 0.175 percent
[3:42:22.160 --> 3:42:27.600]  what are you causing everything down for you know if people do die and particularly older
[3:42:27.600 --> 3:42:32.160]  people and most of the people that are dying are elderly or from nursing homes but of course once
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:38.160]  you get out of a nursing home then they send you to daycare right i think that's it yeah no they
[3:42:38.160 --> 3:42:51.040]  can't you go to camp they can't India one point almost one almost 1.4 billion people right 1.4
[3:42:51.040 --> 3:43:02.480]  billion people last year almost 2 million died of air pollution related diseases 2 million
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:10.400]  they're locking down New Delhi as i mentioned before 40 million people there the middle class
[3:43:10.400 --> 3:43:20.800]  is shrinking they keep locking it down anytime they want 180 000 people in a country of 1.4
[3:43:20.800 --> 3:43:32.160]  billion that died over the virus over a course of a year it equals you ready 0.0128 percent of its
[3:43:32.160 --> 3:43:41.840]  population that's why i'm holding a rally because they can keep robbing us of our freedom peace and
[3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:50.480]  justice how could people put up with this crap look at the low lives that are destroying our life
[3:43:51.520 --> 3:43:55.920]  these are freaks you don't believe me look at their faces
[3:43:59.440 --> 3:44:07.840]  cnn where we're off the air many evangelicals say they won't be vaccinated against COVID-19
[3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:14.880]  some experts say distressed in this information and played a role at Pastor Tony Spells Sunday
[3:44:14.880 --> 3:44:20.960]  sermon last week he preached a different kind of message that usual that's usual in his congregation

[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:28.240]  those moronics goes on to say i'll be anti-mask and anti-vaccine
[3:45:28.240 --> 3:45:35.680]  is anti-government and i'm proud to be anti-government then here's what cnn says he
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:46.720]  goes on to falsely state if you have a 99.6 survival rate why do you want somebody to
[3:45:46.720 --> 3:45:52.400]  contaminate your bloodstream with something that may or may not hurt you
[3:45:52.400 --> 3:45:58.400]  yep he was wrong
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:07.760]  you know how much he was off according to the statistics that we found the grand total love
[3:46:07.760 --> 3:46:19.840]  you said 99.6 98 recovery rate that's at the
[3:46:22.560 --> 3:46:29.600]  the lowest 98 recovery rate and you're locking down everything
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:42.640]  this is the kind of headlines they have and this is what people kill Nova Scotia one new death
[3:46:43.280 --> 3:46:53.680]  from COVID-19 six new cases reported ready look up who died a woman who was over 80 years old
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:47:01.040]  or Australia i want to play this clip
[3:47:03.920 --> 3:47:09.040]  next time i come on but right now i want to introduce owens shawyer he's taken over he
[3:47:09.040 --> 3:47:15.280]  does such a great job and boy i'm i love being on with him and here's owen take it away owen
[3:47:16.640 --> 3:47:22.960]  well gerald we've got a loaded broadcast coming up in the war room today and specifically what
[3:47:22.960 --> 3:47:28.720]  the media and the democrats are doing with the George Floyd Derek Chauvin trial is really just
[3:47:28.720 --> 3:47:35.120]  despicable they want america to burn the lies that they've told throughout this case the lies that
[3:47:35.120 --> 3:47:40.000]  they told on the outset the lies that they're telling now it's quite apparent maxine waters
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:44.560]  and the mainstream media and the democrat party want to see america burn i don't know if that's
[3:47:44.560 --> 3:47:49.200]  they think it has a political value for them or the value for the media ratings but that's clearly
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:55.120]  what they want and so if justice is served here there's no way shawvin is going to get a murder
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:48:00.480]  charge which is what maxine waters admits that they're uh demanding because that's what terrorist
[3:48:00.480 --> 3:48:06.000]  groups do is make demands gerald you know that so uh the chances are shawvin's not going to get that
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:10.240]  so you know what that's going to mean you've seen what minneapolis looks like a third world country
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:15.920]  all boarded up i'm sure they'll do the same thing in your area gerald soon as well we've also got the
