[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:38.080]  it is Friday the 12th day of March 2010 we're gonna be live here for the next
[00:38.080 --> 00:42.960]  four hours Bob Chapman joins us in the next hour with his once a month visit
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.120]  on the economic and New World Order front former Minnesota governor and best-selling
[00:47.120 --> 00:53.080]  author Jesse Ventura will be joining us and this is going to be a very
[00:53.080 --> 00:57.400]  interesting interview I have a lot of key questions for the governor and then
[00:57.400 --> 01:01.880]  the last 30 minutes of the show we're so we've got Gary fielder on he's the
[01:01.880 --> 01:07.000]  constitutional lawyer out in Colorado who went in and protested the naked body
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.160]  scanners and made them change their policy at the courthouse there in Denver
[01:11.160 --> 01:16.600]  he's gonna be speaking this weekend in Austin Texas so I thought we'd have him
[01:16.600 --> 01:20.640]  in studio to talk about a host of constitutional issues towards the end of
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.880]  the broadcast today but on the Jesse Ventura front we're gonna go through his
[01:25.880 --> 01:31.520]  book we're gonna talk about I was told about this five six months ago but I
[01:31.520 --> 01:34.360]  couldn't talk about at the time and I don't know much about it but he's in a
[01:34.360 --> 01:41.240]  new Wachowski brothers movie that's coming out sometime the next year the
[01:41.240 --> 01:46.580]  folks that brought you V for Vendetta the Matrix so Jesse Ventura back on the
[01:46.580 --> 01:52.800]  big screen of course from Running Man Predator and many other films I've never
[01:52.800 --> 02:00.040]  seen so much 9-11 truth getting out on the view and on the morning shows on
[02:00.040 --> 02:04.600]  national television on the news shows I mean he is there talking about building
[02:04.600 --> 02:10.520]  seven the control demolition and we have 1,100 architects and engineers a few
[02:10.520 --> 02:17.360]  weeks ago doing international telecast putting on their evidence that the
[02:17.360 --> 02:21.200]  towers were destroyed with control demolition particularly building seven
[02:21.200 --> 02:25.560]  that's an open and shut case just so much is happening and that's why the
[02:25.560 --> 02:31.000]  establishment is so scared you see just like the national polls have shifted
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.840]  and that's in the news today from 70 plus percent on average believing man-made
[02:36.840 --> 02:43.360]  global warming was real to now over 60 percent some polls 70 percent but four
[02:43.360 --> 02:52.600]  out of seven in the latest poll so that's 60 plus percent believing that
[02:52.600 --> 02:58.520]  global warming is a fraud and a hoax to tax people see overnight if you can get
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.360]  the population to actually look at evidence for themselves instead of the
[03:03.360 --> 03:10.520]  hype these type of hoaxes can be destroyed very quickly and the 9-11
[03:10.520 --> 03:18.040]  fraud that hoax is falling in on itself in every major poll and more and more
[03:18.040 --> 03:21.480]  scientists are getting on board researching what really happened more
[03:21.480 --> 03:25.000]  more political researchers more and more 9-11 Commission members more and more
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.720]  heads of state are coming out and this has got the system really worried
[03:30.720 --> 03:35.760]  because of 9-11 implodes if that lie falls apart which is now happening they
[03:35.760 --> 03:40.760]  can't stage more terror attacks in the future and it will cause a complete loss
[03:40.760 --> 03:44.360]  of confidence in the new world order and all these fraudulent wars they
[03:44.360 --> 03:54.400]  launched on the back of 9-11 so we're excited about Ventura coming up later
[03:54.400 --> 04:02.320]  in the broadcast today obviously okay I absolutely have to discipline myself
[04:02.320 --> 04:06.080]  today though I would like to rant endlessly on each one of these articles
[04:06.080 --> 04:12.200]  we're gonna see if I can do it I'm gonna attempt to come back and in a focused
[04:12.200 --> 04:20.880]  fashion just read the headlines I've never succeeded we'll see if I do today
[04:20.880 --> 04:27.480]  and then go back through them in more detail now I have known for a long time
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.960]  because I read the newspapers really never made national news that Mexican
[04:31.960 --> 04:36.520]  troops have been attacking and killing US citizens burning down houses shooting
[04:36.520 --> 04:42.520]  police military robbing sheriff's departments but now it's finally getting

[08:02.000 --> 08:08.200]  political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:11.000 --> 08:17.640]  Friday the 12th day of March 2010 thank you so much for joining us today let me
[08:17.640 --> 08:22.160]  just run through the headlines here House Democrats look at slaughtered
[08:22.160 --> 08:28.400]  solution to pass Obamacare without a vote on Senate bill update that's the
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.440]  violation of Constitution and a federal law bills spending bills have to
[08:33.440 --> 08:38.040]  originate in the House the House bill is separate from the Senate bill but
[08:38.040 --> 08:41.880]  they're saying that they're gonna let the Senate just basically send this to
[08:41.880 --> 08:47.360]  Obama without it passing the House again completely illegal but they don't
[08:47.360 --> 08:52.720]  care once you start breaking the law why stop and it's just a lawless rogue
[08:52.720 --> 08:58.800]  criminal government every day Obama delays Asia trip to deal with health care
[08:58.800 --> 09:02.440]  AP they're very close
[09:02.680 --> 09:08.680]  continuing if Democrats ignore health care polls midterms will be costly the
[09:08.680 --> 09:12.760]  Washington Post reports it will be political suicide for them to do this
[09:12.760 --> 09:17.160]  but they don't care they've been bought and paid for to get this through to
[09:17.160 --> 09:22.280]  further expand the power of the banks and the insurance companies the banks and
[09:22.280 --> 09:28.040]  insurance companies wrote this bill the propaganda angle is the insurance
[09:28.040 --> 09:31.720]  companies don't want it just like a 1913 they were able to pass the fellow
[09:31.720 --> 09:35.000]  reserve act letting the private banks take over the issuance of currency and
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.200]  credit another violation of the Constitution supposed to be Congress
[09:38.200 --> 09:44.840]  again by posing in the media as if the banks were against it very elementary
[09:44.840 --> 09:49.360]  trick please don't throw me in the briar patch health care bill faces new
[09:49.360 --> 09:54.960]  hurdle Republicans say and they said they want a parliamentary fight over that
[09:54.960 --> 10:01.360]  that is coming up so that's what we've got here on the health care front
[10:01.360 --> 10:06.840]  separately on health care flu shots futile study shows there was a US study
[10:06.840 --> 10:11.080]  last month by a major university crunching number showing there was no
[10:11.080 --> 10:16.120]  proof that the vaccine even protected you from the H1N1 well a separate new
[10:16.120 --> 10:21.320]  Canadian led study has added to the simmering scientific dispute over flu
[10:21.320 --> 10:25.480]  shot campaigns concluding that immunizing nursing home workers did nothing to cut
[10:25.480 --> 10:30.760]  the number of confirmed influenza cases among the homes elderly residents and
[10:30.760 --> 10:36.240]  there's another big report was out last Thursday in the Wall Street Journal that
[10:36.240 --> 10:43.000]  there were record numbers record low numbers in the last 20 years of regular
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.720]  seasonal influenza and record low numbers for the H1N1 it was much lower
[10:49.720 --> 10:53.960]  than even thought now it looks like maybe 3% of the population got it was very
[10:53.960 --> 10:59.160]  very mild first they were seeing 10 to 12% now why is that well it's very clear
[10:59.160 --> 11:04.840]  we know that high levels of flu inoculation results in high levels of
[11:04.840 --> 11:11.040]  people getting the flu so record numbers of people got spooked by it we
[11:11.040 --> 11:15.000]  warned them our listeners warned them many others did all the news came out of
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.680]  how dangerous the shots were and so you had record low numbers of people taking
[11:18.680 --> 11:25.560]  H1N1 and the regular seasonal flu and so you had a record low flu season now
[11:25.560 --> 11:29.200]  you've all seen anecdotal evidence of this how many people do you know who
[11:29.200 --> 11:32.400]  never get the flu so they take the flu shot and they almost died or they do
[11:32.400 --> 11:38.240]  die my mother for a triathlon what a decade ago she got talked into taking a
[11:38.240 --> 11:42.800]  flu shot and she was seriously ill for two weeks the sickest she's ever been
[11:42.800 --> 11:47.720]  with the flu it just continues ladies and gentlemen one of my grandmother's
[11:47.720 --> 11:55.560]  best friends who's a nurse retired took the new shingles vaccine and almost
[11:55.560 --> 12:00.560]  died from the shingles they admitted oh this gave you the shingles but this is
[12:00.560 --> 12:07.120]  now starting to come out some good news from New York Daily News NYPD stop and
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.360]  frisk policy feels heat from city council members pointing out at some
[12:11.360 --> 12:16.640]  constitutional yeah cops for at least five years all over New York City just
[12:16.640 --> 12:20.720]  randomly pull you over or randomly stop you and demand to patch you down and
[12:20.720 --> 12:29.960]  empty your pockets total violation of the fourth amendment continuing we have
[12:29.960 --> 12:35.120]  senator Graham who really needs to be removed from office he's about as
[12:35.120 --> 12:40.880]  republican as bill clinton about his conservative as mouse a tongue he is
[12:40.880 --> 12:44.520]  saying that they've got to get their guest worker ID program through but when
[12:44.520 --> 12:49.480]  you read the bill it's a worker ID card for the American people and Obama has
[12:49.480 --> 12:54.680]  now put a moratorium on deportations of non-criminal illegals that is
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.440]  illegals that haven't committed some violent crime they're illegal being
[12:58.440 --> 13:03.600]  here period and you notice they've basically halted all of the raids on
[13:03.600 --> 13:10.960]  businesses they don't need new laws to enforce the current laws on immigration
[13:10.960 --> 13:15.920]  so they're pushing a worker ID card where everyone will have to have a card
[13:15.920 --> 13:19.640]  to be employed and the government will track everything you're doing at an
[13:19.640 --> 13:29.480]  even greater level so we're going to be going over some of that today as well
[13:29.880 --> 13:36.080]  here is another important report out of the San Antonio Express news Mexican
[13:36.080 --> 13:44.320]  military copter over US neighborhood and there is a detailed report by Paul
[13:44.320 --> 13:49.840]  Joseph Watson at prisonplanet.com while government treats citizens as
[13:49.840 --> 13:58.280]  terrorist Mexican military invades us because every time it ends up in Texas
[13:58.280 --> 14:07.760]  Arizona New Mexico or California articles news reports or TV that Mexican
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.080]  troops have fired on citizens or come across the border in a Texas case we
[14:12.080 --> 14:15.760]  have the sheriff on a few years ago three miles across the border to grab a
[14:15.760 --> 14:21.040]  truckload a dump truckload full of marijuana and the Mexican troops came
[14:21.040 --> 14:26.400]  three miles over the border onto the highway surrounded in their Humvees the
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.240]  sheriff's department at gunpoint and said give us the marijuana or we're going
[14:30.240 --> 14:36.880]  to kill you and I had the sheriff on who was there at gunpoint and it made the
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.960]  local newspaper and no and and I think Lou Dobbs mentioned it but that was it
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.520]  imagine Mexican troops come three miles over the border onto a US highway they
[14:48.520 --> 14:53.600]  knew where they were and do this and that's the point that the San Antonio
[14:53.600 --> 15:01.640]  Express news makes is that well here's a quote it's always been said the Mexican
[15:01.640 --> 15:06.640]  military does in fact cross the border there have been incursions Gonzalez the
[15:06.640 --> 15:11.440]  sheriff said but this is not New Mexico Arizona here we've got a river there's a
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.080]  boundary line and then of course having Falcon Lake Falcon damn it's a lot
[15:16.080 --> 15:21.520]  wider it's not just a trickle of river it's an actual dam you know where the
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.680]  boundaries at now you heard the calls in the last few months from this very area
[15:26.680 --> 15:33.720]  and other border towns saying there are Russian helicopters landing and taking
[15:33.720 --> 15:40.560]  off gray and black helicopters and these have now been videotaped by the
[15:40.560 --> 15:45.000]  sheriff's department it's in the newscast that Watson has up at prison
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.520]  planet.com and I didn't have time and I saw this this morning to go look up
[15:50.520 --> 15:54.120]  types of helicopters but it does look like one of the Russian designed it
[15:54.120 --> 15:58.120]  almost looks like a hind helicopter also they've also got some some classic
[15:58.120 --> 16:05.160]  Vietnam era Huey's but so the listeners kept calling saying we've got black we've
[16:05.160 --> 16:09.600]  got gray oh and I forgot white helicopters landing everywhere doing weird
[16:09.600 --> 16:15.320]  things they're over our houses we think they're Russians no they're not Russians
[16:15.320 --> 16:23.160]  they are Mexicans and they're hanging out the side with weapons and in fact
[16:23.160 --> 16:28.200]  that's in the San Antonio Express news that the weapons are visible so imagine
[16:28.200 --> 16:32.640]  in this case they're reporting five miles over the border and over the river
[16:32.640 --> 16:38.080]  and over the dam you've got helicopters flying around watching you and then
[16:38.080 --> 16:43.320]  Watson just added a few cases at the end of the article where the troops have
[16:43.320 --> 16:47.000]  been videotaped as much as six miles over the border in Arizona they've shot
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.720]  at US Border Patrol Border Patrol has been killed before and the media covers
[16:50.720 --> 16:55.840]  up that was Mexican troops the Mexican troops guard the drug shipments when you
[16:55.840 --> 16:59.720]  hear Mexican troops are fighting drugs they're fighting cowboys that haven't
[16:59.720 --> 17:05.360]  paid their cut so let's go ahead and go out to break with this clip from a
[17:05.360 --> 17:13.200]  local news TV station on this subject here it is say it's an incursion the
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.360]  Mexican Navy caught on the United States side of the border doing surveillance in
[17:17.360 --> 17:22.200]  Starr County ten five stephanie stone has the proof and she's live with more
[17:22.200 --> 17:27.560]  Stephanie the proof in this case is in the pictures and it's proof the
[17:27.560 --> 17:33.080]  Mexican military sees no boundaries this is not the first time it happens it's
[17:33.080 --> 17:36.960]  much that has happened before and it's not the first time and it won't be the
[17:36.960 --> 17:42.080]  last Zapata County Sheriff Sige Gonzalez says he's seen the military before
[17:42.080 --> 17:49.120]  heard about what happened last night just across the lake from Zapata sits
[17:49.120 --> 17:56.280]  Falcon Heights 14 miles from Roma 27 miles from Rio Grande City it's remote
[17:56.280 --> 18:02.640]  Starr County and it's here that most everyone saw La Marina these pictures
[18:02.640 --> 18:07.400]  were taken shortly after six o'clock some more clear than others they're
[18:07.400 --> 18:11.840]  marking so I understand red marina which is equivalent to the Mexican Navy the
[18:11.840 --> 18:16.080]  folks in Falcon Heights are staying as quiet as their storefronts no one will
[18:16.080 --> 18:20.000]  go on camera they will only say the helicopter was here for about 10 or
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.680]  15 minutes it circled over a house just down the street here a house where a
[18:24.680 --> 18:29.400]  known criminal once lay had some armed individuals in the helicopter had an
[18:29.400 --> 18:33.920]  open ramp in the rear of the helicopter with armed individuals very military
[18:33.920 --> 18:37.280]  looking very military style and very military prepared we tried to get a
[18:37.280 --> 18:42.520]  comment from nearly a dozen government agencies on this side of the border the
[18:42.520 --> 18:47.040]  FAA directed us towards customs and border protection who would only say
[18:47.040 --> 18:53.680]  they knew about it and the Falcon Bridge was not affected so it seems that the
[18:53.680 --> 18:59.760]  only people who really know why La Marina were in our airspace are sitting
[18:59.760 --> 19:05.920]  on the Mexican side of the lake we also tried to get answers from various state
[19:05.920 --> 19:10.840]  and local representatives as of news time no one had returned our phone calls

[24:29.080 --> 24:33.880]  last two months we've had all these calls from the border in Texas with
[24:33.880 --> 24:38.160]  people saying Russian helicopters and during the break we pulled up some
[24:38.160 --> 24:42.600]  Russian helicopter designs and googled the term Mexico buys Russian
[24:42.600 --> 24:47.760]  helicopters and pulled up the very helicopter that's on the video with men
[24:47.760 --> 24:52.800]  hanging out the sides with automatic weapons flying over the United States
[24:52.800 --> 24:58.120]  and on record coming across over and over again at gunpoint and taking drugs
[24:58.120 --> 25:03.200]  back from sheriff's departments that bust their people and we've had cases
[25:03.200 --> 25:09.800]  hundreds of cases of scores of homes burned down by Mexican troops and the
[25:09.800 --> 25:16.720]  media keeps it real quiet can you imagine if say a militia of black guys or
[25:16.720 --> 25:23.320]  white guys or Hispanic Americans anywhere in the US came up to say a state
[25:23.320 --> 25:29.760]  police drug bus in Ohio and aimed the guns at sheriff's deputies and took the
[25:29.760 --> 25:35.280]  drugs away it would be top news everywhere hand ringing they would say
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.480]  every American needs national ID cards every American basically has to be a
[25:39.480 --> 25:44.240]  prisoner now oh my gosh it's the end of the world our precious police were at
[25:44.240 --> 25:49.160]  gunpoint what are we gonna do these evil American people are so bad but the
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.520]  Mexican government ladies and gentlemen college students in Texas don't even go
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.640]  down to Mexico anymore I've been down there it's all boarded up on both sides
[25:57.640 --> 26:01.640]  of the border everything is shutting down the hotels have all shut down I mean
[26:01.640 --> 26:07.440]  almost every hotel it's it large cities are like ghost towns and rocket attacks
[26:07.440 --> 26:13.120]  on newspapers on both sides hang grenade attacks murders you saw the locals in
[26:13.120 --> 26:18.640]  that town from that newscast none of them would come out and talk to the news
[26:18.640 --> 26:26.000]  cameras about the helicopter over their house none of them scared to death of the
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.360]  federales of the Mexican Navy flying around heavily armed with weapons
[26:32.360 --> 26:40.600]  systems hanging out the open base and it goes on and on and Mexico has the
[26:40.600 --> 26:46.960]  richest man in the world mr. Slim and Forbes reported that the majority of
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.520]  public billionaires are from Latin America why is that because these are
[26:52.520 --> 26:56.640]  slaves and we're now going to be slaves to the banks and we're now going to have
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.720]  troops on the streets heavily armed and militarized police like Mexico see when
[27:01.720 --> 27:05.880]  you have troops in black masks walking around the street you live in a third
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.720]  world country and the banks rob you and the taxes are high and you have no
[27:10.720 --> 27:21.640]  freedom it's like if you have a certain disease it has certain symptoms and
[27:21.640 --> 27:30.960]  these are the symptoms of this while government treats citizens as terrorists
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.600]  Mexican military invades us Navy chopper with armed troops conducts
[27:35.600 --> 27:40.600]  surveillance in south Texas border town authorities could care less that's because
[27:40.600 --> 27:43.000]  they're all scared to death they get killed all the time and then they say
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.480]  oh a drug dealer a hit man must have killed him no the Mexican troops have
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.560]  been reported even the Dallas Morning News killing people in Indiana in Dallas
[27:52.560 --> 27:57.000]  it's just just everywhere they just do what they want all the US government and
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.960]  federal authorities busy themselves targeting American citizens as
[27:59.960 --> 28:03.080]  domestic terrorists it seems they could care less about the fact that the
[28:03.080 --> 28:07.440]  military of a foreign power is flying around American airspace with wanton
[28:07.440 --> 28:11.880]  abandoned residents of Falcon Heights a south Texas border town saw a Mexican
[28:11.880 --> 28:15.920]  helicopter this is happen many times hovering over a house shortly after 6
[28:15.920 --> 28:20.360]  p.m. on Tuesday night the chopper conducted surveillance for about 15
[28:20.360 --> 28:24.120]  minutes before flying back to Mexico they had armored individuals in the
[28:24.120 --> 28:28.840]  choppers open ramp very military looking and style and preparation said
[28:28.840 --> 28:34.280]  Zapata County Sheriff Gonzalez it's proof the Mexican military sees no
[28:34.280 --> 28:40.240]  boundaries reports local KRGV TV Stephanie Stone adding that the incident
[28:40.240 --> 28:44.320]  wasn't the first of its kind and wouldn't be the last the markings I
[28:44.320 --> 28:48.920]  understand read La Marina which is equivalent to Mexican Navy said Gonzalez
[28:48.920 --> 28:52.680]  local residents who saw the chopper refused to talk to anyone on camera but
[28:52.680 --> 28:58.440]  the news report showed images of the Russian chopper KRGV contacted nearly a
[28:58.440 --> 29:02.240]  dozen government agencies in an attempt to get answers after contracting with the
[29:02.240 --> 29:06.360]  FAA about the chopper the KRGV was told the talk to customs and border
[29:06.360 --> 29:10.280]  protection who say they knew about the incursion but were apparently unconcerned
[29:10.280 --> 29:13.840]  it's like all the urban warfare drills the Pentagon has run all over the
[29:13.840 --> 29:17.400]  country including stop Texas and then internal documents come out that they're
[29:17.400 --> 29:21.760]  acclimating the public for when there's a real martial law takeover we will stand
[29:21.760 --> 29:26.560]  down great example of that of course is how they always practicing over city

[34:37.120 --> 34:43.560]  cases of our troops running when the Mexican troops open up on them because
[34:43.560 --> 34:48.680]  Mexico believes the Southwest from Texas to California belongs to Mexico
[34:48.680 --> 34:55.400]  because of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
[34:55.400 --> 34:59.800]  Texas wanted independence then Mexico came up into Oklahoma killed a bunch of
[34:59.800 --> 35:05.360]  US troops the United States invaded took over Mexico City that's why you have

[35:33.960 --> 35:40.600]  Mexican forces because the Mexican forces are so incredibly corrupt now
[35:40.600 --> 35:45.440]  Mexico only had a few outposts in these states most the indigenous populations
[35:45.440 --> 35:51.400]  who were Mexican wanted to be American but our media and our corporations and
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.520]  the universities for 50 years have taught liberation theology in the
[35:55.520 --> 35:59.120]  colleges and now high schools US government grants have paid for millions
[35:59.120 --> 36:03.680]  of comic books for sixth graders because the average final year of education
[36:03.680 --> 36:07.800]  Mexico is sixth grade teaching that America is evil and that one day the
[36:07.800 --> 36:11.600]  Southwest will be taken back why would our government finance that because
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.080]  banks run our country they want to break it up they want to break it up in and
[36:16.080 --> 36:21.800]  then put it into a larger North American Union by stealth and in 2000 and then
[36:21.800 --> 36:26.120]  again in 2008 this was in Toronto Star Associated Press it's in my film road
[36:26.120 --> 36:31.760]  to tyranny 2002 there were more articles two years ago on it that the Mexican
[36:31.760 --> 36:35.600]  government and the Canadian government have contracted to use their troops in
[36:35.600 --> 36:42.080]  the US to quote suppress US uprisings and Mexico's contracted with the US to
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.680]  bring our troops into Mexico during uprisings our vice versa remember
[36:46.680 --> 36:50.800]  during the winter Olympics US troops that was in the headline US troops to
[36:50.800 --> 36:57.280]  patrol US troops to be in Canada another headline yesterday in the Washington
[36:57.280 --> 37:03.840]  Post homeland security to decide if Canadians can fly to US inside their
[37:03.840 --> 37:08.720]  own airports see they're just merging and all into these unelected regional
[37:08.720 --> 37:13.920]  systems and it's really happening and see folks hear this stuff proposed or
[37:13.920 --> 37:17.240]  they hear us talk about an article and then the globalist incrementally put
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.320]  it in so people like oh Alex that's not gonna happen just like I remember
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.280]  reading ten years ago they were gonna put taxes on all soft drinks and then
[37:25.280 --> 37:29.040]  fattening foods and then track what you eat and what you purchase that's the
[37:29.040 --> 37:32.320]  real tyranny people didn't believe it could happen now it's in the stimulus
[37:32.320 --> 37:37.560]  bill it's passed in the stimulus bill people didn't believe they try to put
[37:37.560 --> 37:43.480]  taxes on salt New York's on the verge of passing a bill to give you $1,000
[37:43.480 --> 37:50.400]  fines if you have salt on your food I've got a newscast I mean this is really
[37:50.400 --> 37:57.680]  happening $5,000 fines in 2012 if you have fluorescent light bulbs in your
[37:57.680 --> 38:02.640]  house those aren't joke Audi ads with the green police arresting people and
[38:02.640 --> 38:09.160]  swat teaming people that have regular fluorescent beautiful light bulbs instead
[38:09.160 --> 38:14.080]  of the green headache bulbs in fact I had the mayor of San Francisco where a
[38:14.080 --> 38:17.840]  company in San Francisco produced those ads saying oh this is what we want see
[38:17.840 --> 38:24.600]  you're just being acclimated when you see that green police ad it's so over the
[38:24.600 --> 38:27.760]  top though people can't believe it and the public doesn't see it as their
[38:27.760 --> 38:34.240]  place to get involved and say no to this it's like I told people six seven
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.320]  years ago and then it was mainstream news four years ago that laptops regular
[38:38.320 --> 38:43.000]  computers cameras microphones built into them are watching you they're using
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.320]  computers to record everything going on in your home now it's mainstream news now
[38:47.320 --> 38:49.840]  the schools just come out in the open and go yeah we're watching your kids at
[38:49.840 --> 38:52.960]  home we're watching you and your veteran what's the big deal yeah we've got
[38:52.960 --> 38:58.840]  cameras in the toilets in the toilet stalls in the showers in England in
[38:58.840 --> 39:07.760]  Europe in the US in Canada what's the big deal they're just doing it I live in
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.520]  Texas I live here where a truck bomb went off four years ago killing a bunch
[39:12.520 --> 39:16.040]  of people in Dallas and it was a minor footnote the Dallas morning news when
[39:16.040 --> 39:21.520]  the Mexican military killed a drug dealer I live here in Austin where every day
[39:21.520 --> 39:26.080]  illegal aliens run over and kill people at DW eyes and don't even get charged or
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.480]  rob and kill old ladies and they won't even say they're illegals in the news
[39:30.480 --> 39:34.360]  article you've got to go do research to find that out I was talking to a Travis
[39:34.360 --> 39:38.320]  County person I'll just say that in the attorney's office in the district
[39:38.320 --> 39:43.240]  attorney's office in fact their card is somewhere here I want to put it on my
[39:43.240 --> 39:48.640]  desk and moved it and they were saying as soon as I want to talk to them they'll
[39:48.640 --> 39:52.760]  give me the documents that I've already seen in the news here in there that the
[39:52.760 --> 39:58.240]  illegal aliens can drunk drive kill people attack murder and if they are
[39:58.240 --> 40:04.000]  arrested they're given a $1 fine for DW I and they let one guy out who'd been in
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.000]  a crash been in jail for a week he was given a $50 fine and then he got out
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.800]  again in two days later ran into a police officer carrying a suspect and
[40:12.800 --> 40:18.480]  almost killed the cop and the suspect and himself in the wreck I mean they
[40:18.480 --> 40:24.960]  just throw the book at US citizens just absolutely beat you over the head with
[40:24.960 --> 40:28.800]  it and I've seen it all over the news where sheriffs will arrest a van load
[40:28.800 --> 40:32.600]  of illegals and ice won't even come pick them up or how about what was in the
[40:32.600 --> 40:37.320]  Wall Street Journal last year that when ice does do these fake raids of
[40:37.320 --> 40:42.240]  businesses they take them to the INS and give them green cards on the spot with
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.240]  no identification whatever identity they want and then it came out when they
[40:47.240 --> 40:52.920]  built what 55 miles of the 2,200 mile fence they just built it for news media
[40:52.920 --> 40:58.920]  as a stunt that illegal aliens with the main contractors building it this is
[40:58.920 --> 41:02.840]  your lawless government and I called Watson up this morning because he wrote
[41:02.840 --> 41:07.680]  a story just about the Mexican helicopter and I said will you please add he
[41:07.680 --> 41:10.840]  does a great job but I said will you please add in there where they rob
[41:10.840 --> 41:14.520]  sheriffs at gunpoint where they come across the border where they kill
[41:14.520 --> 41:17.920]  people and he added a few of them but we're taking hours to add the hundreds
[41:17.920 --> 41:24.120]  I mean somebody's got to create a compendium or a boil down of all of this
[41:24.120 --> 41:30.080]  because it's just such an example of how not only are all these laws used against
[41:30.080 --> 41:37.000]  citizens authoritarian oppressive draconian unconstitutional color of
[41:37.000 --> 41:44.120]  law frauds just meant to get people into the system and raise revenue but it's
[41:44.120 --> 41:48.880]  then not enforced against the precious 30 million illegal aliens and now that
[41:48.880 --> 41:56.320]  Mexico and much of Latin America are completely collapsing I mean collapsing
[41:56.320 --> 42:02.040]  into just bedlam with the criminal government fighting with other criminal
[42:02.040 --> 42:07.720]  elements that won't pay their cut the level of illegals pouring across is
[42:07.720 --> 42:11.320]  accelerating and here's our country going bankrupt but the banks love it
[42:11.320 --> 42:17.200]  because it's all all the welfare all the loans all the free births all the anchor
[42:17.200 --> 42:21.440]  babies all the welfare that just bankrupt things further and then Obama
[42:21.440 --> 42:28.160]  creates the coffee party two weeks ago with one of his operatives it gives
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.880]  unlimited media coverage to it and then I watched videos of the coffee party
[42:31.880 --> 42:36.720]  rallies led by the Obama front woman and it's literally almost all illegal
[42:36.720 --> 42:43.800]  aliens they got Mexican flags I mean this is the type of folks the public
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.160]  thinks you can just sit there on your butt everything's gonna get better no
[42:47.160 --> 42:52.080]  no no no you can't just sit here while I'm on the radio or making films or
[42:52.080 --> 42:55.840]  talking about this the whole point of me talking is to get you to go research
[42:55.840 --> 43:01.480]  find out I'm telling you the truth and then do something do something I mean
[43:01.480 --> 43:07.400]  everyone should go to their city council and file discrimination lawsuits any of
[43:07.400 --> 43:11.680]  you out there that have had the book thrown at you for maybe you had two
[43:11.680 --> 43:15.840]  beers at happy hour the cop pulls you over you tell the truth that you drank
[43:15.840 --> 43:21.720]  two beers they give you a DWI and then you just go find in the court record
[43:21.720 --> 43:25.160]  cases of the illegals being let go and you've got an incredible discrimination
[43:25.160 --> 43:29.440]  case see hard-working Americans whether you're Hispanic black white Asian it
[43:29.440 --> 43:33.640]  doesn't matter we just pay the ticket or go to jail or do what they say and go
[43:33.640 --> 43:37.640]  along with it we don't file lawsuits we don't get angry we don't rally we don't
[43:37.640 --> 43:41.760]  get upset we're too busy working to pay all the tax money for all these
[43:41.760 --> 43:48.600]  illegals and everybody else barely make it ends me you're going to have to get
[43:48.600 --> 43:53.520]  angry and get involved in major polls over 80% of Americans don't want
[43:53.520 --> 43:59.800]  flooded water the head EPA scientist in their union went public seven years ago
[43:59.800 --> 44:05.160]  with all the poisons they put in the water the EPA doesn't want it in there
[44:05.160 --> 44:08.960]  the FDA doesn't want it in there but the heads of the groups do I mean how how
[44:08.960 --> 44:12.320]  does the Austin City Council keep fluoride in your water and pay over a
[44:12.320 --> 44:16.440]  million dollars a year for it when it's nothing but cheap toxic waste the by
[44:16.440 --> 44:24.920]  product of aluminum and purification and what's happening with the production
[44:24.920 --> 44:32.520]  of fertilizer they're poisoning you you know they are why don't you stop them
[44:32.520 --> 44:39.120]  they have no authorization to forcibly medicate you and they could say well
[44:39.120 --> 44:42.160]  you can just drink filtered water folks when you take a shower a bath you're
[44:42.160 --> 44:46.640]  breathing it and you're absorbing it the skins the biggest organ in the body see
[44:46.640 --> 44:50.800]  if if they can let the illegals be above the law and then you get the book
[44:50.800 --> 44:54.920]  thrown at you for no reason then why not go ahead and use laptops to watch you
[44:54.920 --> 45:00.920]  at home why not go ahead and let farm bank steal 28 trillion why not just go
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.600]  ahead and do all this if you're going to go along with it if you're going to put
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.120]  up with it in the sky's the limit they're not gonna stop I want to get into

[48:17.040 --> 48:20.040]  government all of it on interest of bankers that made the money out of
[48:20.040 --> 48:23.040]  nothing then they implode your country and the bankers take over the whole
[48:23.040 --> 48:27.480]  infrastructure your islands your roads your water your national parks everything
[48:27.480 --> 48:32.120]  meanwhile you could daily mail reports Lehman brothers chiefs concealed losses
[48:32.120 --> 48:38.520]  with accounting gimmick days before a 700 billion dollar collapse and it goes
[48:38.520 --> 48:44.440]  on to say a government 2,200 page report concludes that was basically illegal at
[48:44.440 --> 48:48.640]  the Federal Reserve and Treasury worked with them to conceal this so that the
[48:48.640 --> 48:52.640]  Lehman brothers executives all got their money out before it collapsed and they
[48:52.640 --> 48:59.320]  stuck their shareholders with it just just absolutely criminal and here's
[48:59.320 --> 49:03.320]  another Washington blog article about it Lehman fraudulently cooked its books
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.240]  accounting giant Ernst and Young helped Geithner Bernanke winked and slapped them
[49:08.240 --> 49:13.320]  on the back meanwhile we have disgusting propaganda like this article the Wall
[49:13.320 --> 49:17.360]  Street Journal and I see this everywhere this type of up is down down is up
[49:17.360 --> 49:26.280]  propaganda economist credit fed for alleviating crisis and then the first
[49:26.280 --> 49:32.800]  lines another line it's 28 trillion not 787 billion that was just the first
[49:32.800 --> 49:37.140]  payment of a revolving door and only one form of money they got a three the
[49:37.140 --> 49:42.000]  787 billion stimulus package was a good for the economy but the Federal Reserve
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.480]  played the biggest role in resurrecting the US economy from the financial crisis
[49:46.480 --> 49:50.200]  according to the majority of economists in the latest Wall Street Journal
[49:50.200 --> 49:54.160]  forecasting survey yeah the people they go out and ask her all in the government
[49:54.160 --> 49:58.760]  payroll or corporate payroll meanwhile we're gonna be just like Mexico with the
[49:58.760 --> 50:01.680]  richest man in the world of course he's not really the richest but riches
[50:01.680 --> 50:05.880]  publicly the real rich keep their money secret the Dutch royal family the
[50:05.880 --> 50:09.400]  British royal family the Rockefeller's Rothschilds the third world is a
[50:09.400 --> 50:13.560]  bastion of billionaires Forbes magazine is out with its annual roundup of the
[50:13.560 --> 50:18.360]  world super rich and what you know the surprising number of heavy hitters can be
[50:18.360 --> 50:22.600]  found in that part of the planet we used to refer to as the third world third
[50:22.600 --> 50:26.080]  being a polite vague way of saying poor they're poor because of these people
[50:26.080 --> 50:31.160]  today that's a dated term in more ways than one business one and it goes on
[50:31.160 --> 50:35.320]  to mention all the richest people and I want to go over this when we come back
[50:35.320 --> 50:40.000]  and we'll get into more of what's happening with health care Bob Chapman
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.240]  is coming on we're also gonna get into so-called brain scanners that the
[50:45.240 --> 50:48.440]  government's pushing that they're gonna force citizens to be hooked up to without
[50:48.440 --> 50:54.120]  a warrant oh you're going to prison this says you're a terrorist for safety you

[56:12.520 --> 56:20.120]  the Senate and be signed by the president that's illegal on its face it's as

[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.560]  in the country lived in South Africa France Germany you name it he then had
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.960]  the biggest newsletter up until the 1990s he retired for a while and came back
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:48.040]  with the international forecaster and he joins us for the next 51 minutes Bob
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.200]  good to have you here with us well thank you very nice to begin bet be back
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:59.720]  again this week and lots to talk about is we well know I want to get into the
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.200]  economy with you I want to get into all these hundreds of new taxes on
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:10.120]  food on salt on sugar on fattening foods I want to get into where you see the
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.880]  banks going with all this the immigration reform which means a
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:18.760]  national ID card to work for the American people but the illegals are
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.240]  basically all legalized and given this system I want to get into a host of
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.120]  issues but I want to ask you Bob what's most important on your radar right now
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:35.040]  well I think we're seeing very desperate moves by the US Treasury and the
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:42.880]  Federal Reserve because of the ongoing almost every week now auctions of US
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:48.480]  Treasuries as well as agency securities the agency securities being Fannie Mae
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:56.320]  Freddie Mac Ginny May and FHA and last year 80% of that paper was bought by the
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:02.600]  Federal Reserve which creates money out of thin air but that said this week they
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:08.240]  had a 10-year auction a bill auction which is short a term paper under a
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:14.920]  year and they also are having a 30-year auction this week and when every time
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:21.520]  those auctions come up the Fed and in the Treasury go into the market and they
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.800]  try to knock gold and silver down and they also attack the shares as well and
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:33.880]  it's becoming so obvious that even main lie writers are starting to talk about
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:39.560]  it any analysts and economists the activity of the Fed and the Treasury in
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:45.320]  the markets and and so that I think that's very important because if they
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:50.320]  weren't in there the situation would be totally different we also was seeing the
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:56.880]  same thing in the stock market as it levitates again in the high 10,000s you
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.600]  know if they weren't in there the market would be lower we've had a lot of
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:10.080]  business news this week pertaining to the giveaway or lending of money tax
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:17.320]  free or money to Wall Street and banking and the the bankruptcy of Lehman
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:24.440]  which turns out that the president of former president Lehman brothers was
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:31.280]  lying of course and and and he says he wasn't but he was lying and and at the
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:38.440]  same time we know now that in order to take over Lehman JP Morgan Chase and
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:43.000]  Goldman Sachs cut off their lines of credit and started a run on the company
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.080]  and that's actually what you said several months before that even began
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.080]  here on air a couple years ago that this was a staged event and now it's in
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.920]  major newspapers I covered it last hour the mail the Associated Press are
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:02.440]  reporting that even federal regulators put out a 2,200 page report saying that
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:08.040]  they lied and engaged in fraud but the Federal Reserve allowed them to do this
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:12.400]  but I guess that was the payoff because Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan were going to
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:18.000]  absorb or feed this company into their mouth Lehman brothers so they allowed
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.520]  their executives to get away with some cash exactly and that's a good summation
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:32.320]  and we haven't seen the end of that nor have we seen the end of the hijinks that
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:37.480]  are going on and that's why it's so important that in this pending bill in
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:42.080]  the Senate that the HR 1207 which is passed in the house which is part of
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.640]  that bill now is not stripped out because we've got to show the public what
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.920]  the Federal Reserve has been doing all these years and we have to do away with
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.040]  it we can call it the Federal Reserve but it will belong to the US Treasury and
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:01.000]  be staffed by Treasury people that are answerable the people at the Fed are not
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.480]  answerable to anything and we got to stop the revolving door between Wall
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.800]  Street and banking and Washington there's qualified people all over the
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.320]  country who can fill the shoes of those people in the Treasury Department etc.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.280]  but they don't have a monopoly on brain power two years ago right around this
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:26.240]  time a few months before the banker bailout the controlled financial
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.360]  terrorism they engaged in to get the Congress to go along with giving them
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.680]  even more power we began to see more PR about how great the Federal Reserve was
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.760]  how they're gonna save us how they love us now the Federal Reserve admits they
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:42.240]  recruited tens of thousands of executives and professors to go out and
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:47.880]  propagandize to Rotary Clubs City Councils community organizations we see
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.360]  stories like this one today out of the Wall Street Journal economists credit
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:56.120]  Fed for alleviating crisis went on record they're the ones that engineered it and
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.120]  so the feds through this crisis are now calling for more power the Federal Reserve
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:08.200]  instead of getting in trouble as they should so this is really a big battle
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.920]  and on top of that we see Strauss-Kahn the head of the IMF saying look we can't
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.560]  pass Copenhagen so we're gonna do it Gordon Brown said at the G20 we are
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:23.320]  going to just go ahead and levy taxes through the executive at the wellhead
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:28.760]  on oil and on other energy systems and pay it to the IMF and World Bank who
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:32.000]  will then not even say where the money went I mean this is really getting
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.600]  transparent yeah it's it's a total arrogance and they just don't care but
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:42.160]  we're gonna do what we want to do because we run the world and you don't
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:48.120]  and how you stop them is you get rid of most of the people in Congress in
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:52.600]  November and then we can go after all these things there's a whole litany of
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:58.240]  things in which I don't have to repeat you know and so doesn't the audience it's
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:04.920]  so key for us to kick all those people out very very important but the things
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.960]  that Wall Street are doing and banking is doing along with the Federal Reserve
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.200]  and the Treasury Department they're not going to get away with it and I know my
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:18.520]  point is Bob himself my point is Bob as you and Ron Paul and myself many others
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.280]  have said in the last decade when the bankers bring us to this global crisis
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.600]  which in all their documents they say they plan to do we're now here to then
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.840]  scare the world into accepting a bank of the world a world government a world
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:36.020]  constitution run by the banks now being openly proposed by all the global
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:40.680]  leaders Ban Ki-moon Herman von Rompey Gordon Brown Al Gore Barack Obama all
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:46.400]  of them that it's an info war everybody out there if they can just wake up one
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.400]  person to the fractional reserve banking fraud and identify these criminals
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.160]  then they're not going to be able to get away with this just like the global
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:58.680]  warming hoax in all the polls is completely imploding or the flu hoax
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:04.560]  completely imploded it is a life-and-death situation economically to expose these
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:12.000]  people never ever been more right and you know the other night I was on WVL
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:19.160]  VON in Chicago which is one of the largest if not the largest black radio
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:28.720]  station in America and questions came in and I was absolutely floored at the
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:34.160]  knowledge that these callers had and three of the women who called in all
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:39.360]  wanted to discuss the Illuminati now I wouldn't have ever thought in my
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:45.320]  wildest dreams that the penetration of the things that we've been doing have
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:52.240]  reached that level the world is waking up now I hope we have enough time to
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:57.040]  wake up enough to people and we do the right things to stop these people at
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.440]  the past Bob I want to get back into the economy we come back and then a host
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:07.120]  of other issues health care taxes immigration reform IE total open
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.640]  borders North American Union that's what this bill does and why they want to
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:16.040]  work her ID card for all citizens but that the illegals are selectively left
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:21.280]  alone but separately we're seeing massive coordinated intensifying
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.640]  demonization of 9-11 truth they're scared of the 1100 architects and
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.040]  engineers going public saying it's an inside job they're scared of the poll
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.480]  number showing more people are waking up they're scared of the fact that the
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.240]  number one yahoo search in the last decade is basically 9-11 conspiracies
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:41.560]  they're scared of this conspiracy culture taking over that's really just
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:49.360]  people becoming informed the system knows they're losing control and they are
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:54.120]  on the run and we're going to run them right off the end of the pier how do
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.960]  you see that unfolding though this is going to be a tough road it's always a
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:05.320]  tough road and that's when the tough get going and we just got to keep on
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:10.040]  getting the message out of what these people are doing it's just dissemination
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:16.160]  and info war of the truth and that's all we need and you know it will make sense
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:21.560]  to people who have never thought about things in the way that we're explaining
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:26.960]  them now and giving them the proof as to who's doing what to whom and we'll get
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.720]  there and they know that and they're terrified because they know this time
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:37.760]  they're going down with the ship they reached for the world but in the
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:41.320]  process began their destruction we're going to break but I want to start
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.880]  getting into this now how big of a deal is it for freedom that Iceland had a
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:53.280]  referendum last weekend 93% voting saying we will not pay privately for these
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:59.560]  debts that the banks came in and fraudulently set up it's stupendous
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:05.280]  especially coming from essentially a European country and I've been Iceland
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:12.800]  several times and I didn't spend a lot of time there but their typically Nordic
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:19.760]  people and right is right wrong is wrong it's very simple to them and they
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:25.680]  didn't create the debt the people who had the banks did that they were the ones
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:31.920]  that went under not the public and now Greece is into several months of
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:38.040]  rioting and strikes the AP reported the entire air system is at a standstill
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.680]  doesn't look it's going too well for the bankers will they be able to do what
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.720]  they've done in the Latin America and other countries we'll be right back with

[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:11.280]  back to Bob Chapman Bob when we get up here every week we tell people the
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:17.920]  future of the world's destiny is being set up right now we're not joking around
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:22.040]  with people we've had this predatory banking system in control of the US for
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:27.160]  close to a hundred years they've been in control of Europe for over 200 they
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:31.320]  have built massive power out of this they have used our military to be their
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:37.760]  their muscle they are setting up a police state worldwide they are eugenicist
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:41.400]  to boot that once they get total control they want to carry out the orderly
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:46.040]  extermination of the population that sounds crazy but that's the reality and
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:51.920]  truth is stranger than fiction I just can't telegraph the listeners out there
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:57.440]  especially new listeners how dire the situation is and yes it's positive that
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.120]  people are waking up but if we could only educate people fully on just how
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:06.800]  serious it is and just how corrupt this elite is I know we could beat it even
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:12.960]  faster because the globalist aren't gonna go down without a fight what do you
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:18.440]  see them doing in the next few years to try to successfully launch the open
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:23.040]  takeover by world government when you're seeing the beginnings of it in a big way
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:30.560]  with the anti anti-campaign the 9-11 truth is that there are terrorists and
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.360]  and mad people and things like that and they're going to continue that propaganda
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.160]  barrage people like us are going to come you and I and others are going to come
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.800]  under tremendous pressure they'll do everything they can to keep us from
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.920]  getting the message out but the propaganda machine is being cranked up in
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:55.360]  it and it's going to go full bore and we have to meet it head-on with the truth
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:03.000]  and that's what we're doing your videos and tapes the things that you do are
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.560]  extraordinarily important you meet where you're reaching millions and millions of
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.280]  people all over the world I have a publication but I don't have that
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:17.440]  ability like you do and so it's very very important that you continue to do
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:23.280]  what you're doing because you have to be the spearhead of meeting the enemy
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.160]  because you've got the equipment to do it and the knowledge and and the
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.640]  following as well to continue to do what you're doing and so I think that's the
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:39.080]  most important factor is challenging them and going ahead coming up with new
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:45.040]  ideas and telling the public beat on the door of Congress and in the process
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:51.400]  throw the old guys and gals out and put new people in now you talked several
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.400]  years ago actually 10 years ago you wrote about what happened in Europe you
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.960]  picked Greece to go first and it's come out in the news now that they knew this
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:03.120]  was going to happen it was all engineered EU wants answers on Wall Street
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:10.520]  roll and Greek debt EU observer today so we know their battle plan going into
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.960]  the future what chain of events do you see happening what nations will go
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:21.280]  under next as snacks to the bankers and when will they try to fully pull the
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.960]  US down and we know they started the process in 2008 but when do they plan
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:32.840]  to fully decapitate the Republic well I've spoken on the program here before
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:38.520]  about this and I think what they're going to do there are 19 nations on the
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:45.000]  edge of bankruptcy Iceland is probably the leader of the pack and that includes
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:52.400]  the United States and Great Britain and I think by the end of next year they
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:28:01.680]  will try to bring about a meeting which will allow all of the players nations to
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:08.240]  devalue the occurrences simultaneously and default on debt and they'll be
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.080]  ratios with they'll use it they've already figured out how they're going to do
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:20.760]  it and I think that's the way that they will finally try to bring the world and
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:24.560]  particularly the United States and Western Europe to its knees and because
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.480]  that will usher in a deflationary depression and this is what I think that
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:37.880]  they're planning the tip of the iceberg has been Iceland and Greece and then you
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.720]  have all the other underlying players and they're going to bring them all down
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:47.520]  together I think and because that's more acceptable to people if you pick off
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:54.400]  Greece or Iceland or any other country one at a time there's great
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:59.560]  consternation among the people who are within that country and you're seeing
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:04.200]  that in Greece with the riots etc. and the stoppages and that's going to
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:09.400]  continue indefinitely and they really don't want that so they'll shut them up
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:13.680]  by saying oh his your austerity merit measures we're going to give you some
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:19.000]  credit and that they'll keep them subdued for a year or two years on on their
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.240]  planning schedule okay Bob stay there let's come back and finish up with that
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.760]  and then how the banks have done this in the third world over and over again and
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:34.080]  in the first world in some cases what the tax system will look like under this of
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:40.800]  their successful what percentage of GDP will go to debt to the criminal bankers
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:46.840]  stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:53.760]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.200]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:02.200]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:06.120]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:10.120]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:22.520]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:26.120]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:30.480]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:33.600]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:07.800]  questions on the economy or the new world order's activities he can speak on a
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:17.520]  wide range of subjects 1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231 his website is the
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:22.200]  international forecaster dot com our websites of course are info wars dot
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:30.000]  com and prison planet dot tv okay Bob continuing where you got cut off about
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.880]  what you see the big central banks doing that then I want to talk about their
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:39.120]  plan we know what their plan is and it's literally taxes on light bulbs taxes
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:44.040]  on salt taxes on all food which a bunch of states are already passing laws to
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:49.640]  do very draconian the head of the IMF saying literally that we will pay them
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.000]  money and they won't say where it went just like Congress asking the Federal
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.800]  Reserve where's the money and they say we're not going to tell you I mean this
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:03.960]  is so incredibly transparent that it's illegal it's like the Senate saying we
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:08.720]  don't need the house to pass our version for the first 230 years of the nation it
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:12.800]  was illegal it is illegal but they're saying they'll just go ahead and pass it
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.800]  out of the Senate now over to Obama because they can't get the House
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:21.840]  Democrats to go along with the Senate version I mean that's illegal and my
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:25.640]  whole point is this is so lawless Bob having school districts everywhere
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:29.560]  admit they're giving the kids free laptops that taxpayers paid for and then
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.840]  watching them in their bedrooms and their parents I mean that's a no-brainer
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:38.120]  but then you and I are called conspiracy theorist not that the media doesn't
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.600]  admit that's happening but we're conspiracy theorists for not liking it
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:46.680]  having an opinion against corruption or an opinion for common sense or an
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:52.040]  opinion for liberty is Prasad and Angrada and I just don't see it working it's
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:59.640]  so asinine Bob but you know desperate people do desperate things and again
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:04.760]  harking back to what we were talking about earlier if we can get a new
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:11.560]  Congress so to speak and a Senate that we can deal with that is not totally in
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:16.520]  the back pocket of these very wealthy people on Wall Street in these bankers
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.680]  we can get rid of Patriot Act 1 and 2 the Federal Reserve campaign
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:28.640]  contributions lobbying executive orders and the list goes on we get a shot at
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:35.720]  it and it's our only shot and we have to during this period of time between now
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:42.320]  in the beginning of November we have to have an all-out war on getting that in
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.440]  message out to the people of the world nevermind America I mean we've got
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:52.880]  hundreds of new subscribers coming in from everywhere I mean I'm even getting
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:36:00.840]  checks from the Bank of China anyway that's that's what we got to do so the
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:05.280]  Chinese government is reading your newsletter well you know the last two
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:09.440]  bestseller books the number one and number two bestselling the last year
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:14.640]  running are books about the New World Order and the private Federal Reserve in
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:23.240]  China that's terrific so I mean that's what I'm saying Bob you're exploding we're
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.840]  exploding everybody else talking about the New World Order is exploding and
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:31.840]  that brings the next subject people can't believe it because it's so un-American
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.800]  but they're openly saying I have a new article today oh this Jihad Jane got
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.960]  radicalized on the internet and they have the Pentagon before Congress in the
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:45.080]  last part of the Hill article saying we need to do something about this upstream
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.880]  to shut down this stuff on the internet but then when you look at it as Wired
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.240]  magazine reports they're targeting the American people in free speech they're
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:58.800]  not going after their CIA jihadist that's right and that's part of the
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:05.880]  overall plan to bring people to their knees shut them up call them a terrorist
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.360]  people don't want to do things that aren't acceptable people are decent
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:16.760]  human beings in America 95% of them the other 5% are in jail and they deserve to
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:24.320]  be there most of them and and so that's part of the plan I mean there's nothing
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:29.280]  is going to be left unturned they're going to try everything they can they
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:35.320]  can't get a value-added tax the VAT in the United States and they know that so
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:39.560]  what they're doing is what you pointed out just a few minutes ago is they're
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:44.040]  going to tax this that the other thing the money's going to flow to the UN of
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:49.520]  the IMF and that and there'll be no reporting or responsibility of what
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.120]  went there and how it was spent and they admit there'll be no reporting I mean
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:58.280]  this is incredible just like the Fed they say how dare you ask us what we're
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:05.240]  doing it's a state secret Bob I want to hit a bunch of other subjects and then
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:11.960]  go to calls here with you explain as an economist and researcher your view on
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:17.960]  this but they always do bait and switches and they tried the last four
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:24.080]  times with immigration reform in 2000 and what four five six seven and eight to
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.400]  legalize all the illegal aliens it would fix illegal immigration because it
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:31.120]  would just make them all legal and then give them a national ID card now we
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:35.400]  under the real ID act our local state driver's license are already federally
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.680]  standardized so when the media has headlines in the news the last few
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:47.280]  days here's one national worker ID proposed in comprehensive immigration bill
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:52.320]  and it says that citizens will have to have a federal ID and be in good
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.880]  standing when all employers swipe it with their taxes and everything or it's
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.280]  like a no-fly list you won't be able to have a job and it's written for
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.440]  citizens and then the illegals will just be legalized if they choose and be
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:11.280]  given the card but they're selling it like oh this will fix illegal immigration
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:14.880]  explain to people because they're moving into shut down garage sales
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:21.320]  bazaars swap meets without a law there's having federal regulators show up with
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:27.600]  million dollar fines fact that's Fox News again it's all unbelievable the
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:33.080]  globalist want this worker ID explain why because I want to be able to track
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:38.320]  every single financial transaction that's made including your source of
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.360]  income and how you sell it a save it or spend it and then what you say or what
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:48.160]  your investments are because they believe that everything that you have
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:55.000]  belongs to them and there's nothing short of that and so they want to be able
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:03.040]  to be in a position let's say I work at a meat packing plant in Kansas City and
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:07.680]  I am very vocal about all these things that the government's doing that I
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:15.560]  disagree with bingo your card doesn't work anymore and they're saying that
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:18.920]  that's what they're going to do I mean we go back a decade ago when the
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:23.840]  Department of Commerce said they want to tax everything that they say isn't good
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:27.280]  for you and they sell it as oh the health care costs are too high we're
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.760]  going to run your life we're going to tax french fries ice cream beef salt
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:37.640]  soft drinks then all sugar drinks then orange juice and we're going to go in
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:42.560]  and raid businesses that don't take your information and your data and through
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.960]  the national ID card they're going to make you swipe the card to track what
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:50.840]  you're eating what you're doing there I mean they're now admitting that this is
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.600]  the plan I want to play a clip from New York television where they're openly
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:02.240]  saying they're going to tell restaurants what they can and can't serve and then
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:08.040]  if you add any salt and I have another article where all over the country people
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:11.200]  buy their liquor license they pay the liquor tax they pay the tax on the
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:17.160]  alcohol it's totally legal and they're using a 1933 law and they swat team
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:21.840]  raid them and seize the money and all the alcohol and this is happening all
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:28.800]  over the country again citizens doing nothing wrong with ancient laws that
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:32.240]  weren't ever even enforced no one even knows about are being swat team but
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:36.080]  meanwhile the illegal aliens are above the law and they're going to give you a
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.040]  thousand dollar fine if they think they're gonna have inspectors that test
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:46.160]  it that you've added salt to your food here it is it's yet another assault on
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.680]  salt a bill introduced by Brooklyn Assemblyman Felix Ortiz would ban the
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.480]  use of salt in every dish in every drink on every plate in every restaurant in
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:59.160]  every single part of New York State diners would still be able to add salt
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:04.160]  to their food on their own once it gets to the table violators of this proposed
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.360]  legislation would be hit with a 1,000 dollar fine for each salty dish Ortiz
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:13.080]  says the bands designed to save lives he says it would save billions of dollars
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.840]  in health care costs critics argue the restaurant business would suffer and a
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:21.240]  total ban on salt may be impractical given how much food arise in the state
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:28.920]  with salt already included is now Bob again this sets the precedent where
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:34.160]  government regulators decide what chefs can do I mean this is a level worse than
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:41.320]  1984 they're getting right down to brass tax there's no question about that they
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:45.880]  want to control everybody and everything and as you said this is the excuse they
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:52.080]  giving it's not good for you and in all of the items that you mentioned are not
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.840]  good for you so we have to regulate them and in that process we're going to
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:00.560]  regulate how the food companies produce the food to go to the restaurant or go
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.400]  to your table at home what's going to be in it and and whether you can have it
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:16.200]  or not it it's endless and by the way people out there have trouble believing
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.000]  that this could actually happen if they can and it passed in the stimulus bill
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:27.200]  I don't know how they're gonna enforce it taxes on soft drinks if they are able
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:31.760]  to do this of course they're gonna be able to regulate vitamins and minerals
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:37.200]  what many countries in Europe and now Canada have announced that without even
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:42.880]  having a law in Canada they announced two weeks ago you just can't have over the
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.920]  counter vitamins and minerals now we're just not allowing it I mean this is so
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:55.240]  draconian well the the amaryllis I have a wrong
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:44:00.120]  pronunciation on that but anyway that that has been going on for the last 18
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:07.320]  20 years and I've been reporting on it and yeah codex elementaries exactly and
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:11.560]  the what they want to do through that of course is take away all the vitamins
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:17.960]  minerals and herbs from the counter from the dispensers and they will all like
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:22.800]  they are in Europe to some extent they will all become items by
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:30.160]  prescription and it's so that the medical companies and the doctors make
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.960]  more money but more importantly though all of those things will then only be
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:39.240]  produced by pharmaceutical companies because they'll have to be pharmaceutical
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:44.040]  great of course and they will make a lot of money and that's a tremendous
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:50.440]  market worldwide presently and they want to steal it all now let's expand on that
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:56.280]  briefly and then go to calls this gives the SWAT teams this gives the police
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:59.960]  something else to be illegal and contraband I've seen articles where
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:07.280]  they raid aloe vera fields saying it could get you high where they're I mean
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:15.120]  here's philly.com beer raid flap coming to a head hearing ordered faced with
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:18.520]  anger confusion disbelief from beer drinkers in the beer industry pencil
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:21.720]  wing lawmakers are pressing for an explanation of a recent state police
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:26.360]  raids on bars and distributors over allegedly unregistered brands and it
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:33.080]  says they paid the tax it was legal but there was a 1933 prohibition era law
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:37.960]  saying that they had to pay a fee for each beer they serve but but wasn't
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:42.280]  enforced since prohibition but they never got rid of it and it doesn't but
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:47.480]  the point is they rated them with armed police in SWAT team raids and seized
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:53.000]  everything I mean it's just this passing all these laws are enforcing laws in
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:01.280]  our constitutional to harass people it's terrorism terrifying the people it's not
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:06.320]  terrorists that we have running around the country that are citizens it's
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:11.960]  terrorist that are in Washington and in law enforcement and in other agencies
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:17.080]  of government they're the terrorists and that we got to turn the tables on them
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:21.320]  we have to make people understand that they had deliberately being terrorized
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:27.120]  to be brought into submission so that they will believe that one world
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.800]  government is the only solution well I mean look government is growing like a
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:36.920]  cancer everywhere people are losing their freedoms everywhere the same
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:41.720]  regulations are being put in worldwide by these big corporations and the
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:44.920]  countries are going bankrupt and government's answer is to grow even
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:50.800]  faster it's all coming to a head let's talk to Phyllis in Pennsylvania you're
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:56.360]  on the air with Bob Chapman hi I have a question I've been reading on the
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:00.520]  internet a little bit and I found a new word it's called
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:05.920]  technocracy and apparently from technocracy it looks as though there we're
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:10.240]  going to go into a position where we're going to have actually a dictator and the
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:13.920]  dictator action there will be no money it'll be actually everything will be
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:18.680]  dictated by science and technology and so there yes it's called a scientific
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:24.680]  dictatorship or a technocracy where they control all the means of production
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:29.000]  all the food everything is tracked and then the technocrats say in every
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.280]  report once they've got this in place they're going to scientifically play
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:37.600]  people off against each other cut back the resources start new wars to
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:43.360]  exterminate 80% of us Bob Chapman I think if you go back and look at foreign
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.920]  affairs which is the literary household and all the council and foreign
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:52.240]  relations absolutely and go back 50 years and they talk about their
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:57.720]  technocracy they talk about all the things that Alex and I talk about only
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:02.960]  we looked at it and we read that years and years ago and people are now
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:08.600]  discovering technocracy is a word as a way of doing things as a way of control
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:13.120]  Zbigniew Brzezinski has written multiple books between two ages how they're
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.440]  going to enslave us how they're going to dumb us down how they're going to have
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:21.120]  one child policies how they set up the modern communist Chinese system they
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:27.400]  all brag about it and exactly they've written hundreds of books patriots have
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:31.240]  read them and said look the world leaders say they're going to build this we
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:35.160]  warned you and got called conspiracy theorist because the media was counting
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:39.200]  on you to not go look into what we were saying all Bob and I were doing was
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:45.040]  going off what they swore and they swear to do this to us Bob absolutely and
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:49.680]  and the extension of that is all of these things that we're talking about
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:57.560]  they all fit in to a mosaic which to the people who are doing these things ends
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:03.760]  up being world government so each one of these things is a cog in technocracy is
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:10.920]  one of them you might call it the overriding idea of what will bring about
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:14.480]  their world government yeah it's the control room how them to do that
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:18.520]  absolutely fellas anything else
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:24.640]  yeah this whole thing work with gold and silver how does that fit into this
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:31.480]  game and how does and how does how does this new federal ID system fit into this
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.560]  well it makes you use that to buy and sell and work it's like there's a no fly
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:39.720]  list there'll be a no work list a no buy list a no gun buy list this is all
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:43.720]  being publicly proposed they admit this is going to control every fast year
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:47.720]  life they want to get rid of silver and gold because that is a black market i
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:52.800]  eat something they don't control Bob Chapman exactly and it's been that way
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:59.760]  for 6,000 years gold and silver are something that are considered currencies
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:06.240]  things of value they don't owe anybody anything and that's what's so important
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:11.040]  about them they are a store of value they're not attached to a debt i mean
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:15.040]  used to owning private property was like gold or silver but now they have a
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.800]  property tax so you don't really owe it that gold they don't have a property
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:24.840]  tax on they can't control it and that's why they're in the markets today trying
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:30.160]  to control it and they are not going to be successful fill us the body scanners the
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:35.480]  laptops watching your kids it's all the technocracy scientifically designed
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:40.280]  they're on record the poison they put in your water to sterilize you and brain
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:44.240]  damage you and give you cancer on record everything they do the forced
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:48.200]  inoculations they're trying to push through it's a technocracy they are
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:54.480]  playing God we'll be right back with Bob Chapman is it safe to breathe anymore
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:58.320]  crowded public places global pandemics and news reports of potential new

[01:53:56.120 --> 01:54:02.240]  we are back live Bob got cut off by the break there bottom line a
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:07.800]  technocracy is a scientific dictatorship by definition the elites in
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:11.600]  thousands of white papers hundreds of books public human meetings say they're
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:17.160]  building it people say oh it's a loving technocracy no it's designed to enslave
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:23.720]  and ultimately kill you and that's the whole issue Bob Chapman there's too
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:27.440]  many people in this world as far as they're concerned and they want to whittle
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:32.320]  it down to about 20 or 30 percent of what's here right now and not only that
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:38.800]  well they use selective breeding people will be told who can marry to whom
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:44.920]  they'll marry how many children they can have and then the next step will be how
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.120]  they have to be educated they will be tested and they will it'll be shown
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:53.680]  that their proclivities are in certain areas and that's of course a study that
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:59.360]  they'll take and then once they go through university which would be state
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:05.640]  sponsored they'll be told where they're gonna work and again the whole cycle
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:13.320]  starts all over again and this truly is what they were looking for and this has
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:18.520]  been common knowledge for a long long time except we were not able to get the
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:23.160]  word out you know back in the 60s and 70s and 80s because we didn't have the
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:27.840]  equipment we've got today but they built what we told people they were gonna
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.840]  build so our credibility is very high now we're telling folks what the next
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.800]  phase is and anybody can go research this for themselves we're all in this
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:43.800]  together folks John and Florida you're on the air with Bob Chapman go ahead go
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:50.680]  ahead John yes thank you both for all you do for for the citizens of the world
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:56.400]  for that matter much less the citizens of the United States couple questions Bob
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:03.560]  had indicated in late last year discussion he had with a banker regarding
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:11.360]  devaluation and a new currency and I guess if you could take a wild guess in
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:16.480]  terms of when valuation devaluation would happen and if in fact that does
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:23.920]  happen would your loan amount that you have out be reduced proportionately or
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:32.760]  do they just don't even change that well first of all I have said that there
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:39.560]  was a possibility that late this year and of course I was speaking from last
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:44.600]  year but late this year and or by the end of this coming year which would be
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:50.440]  2011 that there was a good chance that the FDIC might not be functioning and
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:56.120]  there was a good chance that they would be an official dollar devaluation and I
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:01.840]  still believe that so and that this these are conversations that would kicked
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:07.120]  around it at at Federal Reserve meetings and now we see open discussion in the
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:11.720]  news about devaluation we see Citibank talking about under federal regulation
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:16.000]  seven days holding your money even after it's deposited and in the bank we see
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.760]  them saying your different types of bank accounts like money markets won't be
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:23.800]  insured we're hearing about the government taking over private pension
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:27.400]  funds and then only giving you part of it back they're clearly moving in this
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:35.200]  direction and the answer to either part of your question logic says that if you
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:42.000]  got one new a new dollar for three old ones then your debt perhaps would be
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.600]  reduced say from a hundred thousand to thirty two thousand five hundred dollars
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:53.920]  that's logic and we don't expect that Washington or banking or the people who
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:57.440]  control things from behind the scenes are going to allow that to happen because
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:02.520]  if you look at the other side of it with a devaluation if everybody is is forced
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:09.720]  to meet the legal contractual obligations of say a mortgage or are any
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:14.280]  other kind of debt that's been occurred in the form of a loan even credit cards
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:21.840]  if they were to use logic and do it the right way everybody would slide by but
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:24.960]  on the other hand if they don't they can bring them to their knees financially
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:28.280]  and that's what we want we're out of time God bless you thanks for joining us

[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:23.760]  for the next hour and 15 minutes an extended in-depth interview with former
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:29.240]  Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura movie star wrestler mayor best-selling
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:33.240]  author you know I bought 3,000 of his book we've already sold a thousand of
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:37.040]  them and I got a call from the salesman from Skyhorses they said you better

[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:51.200]  them at info wars.com and let me tell you this is a scary book because I've
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:56.000]  done the research it's all accurate and I've never seen somebody of Ventura's
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.560]  caliber go this far we had Dick Russell on two days ago part of the books being
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:04.560]  censored by the Huffington Post we'll talk about that fourth on Amazon in the
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:09.880]  top ten of all the other nonfiction charts this is very very exciting it
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:13.040]  shows the hunger people have for alternative information so for the
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:16.680]  next hour and 15 minutes Jesse Ventura back in the States good to have you
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:21.960]  with us great to be here Alex man there is so much going on before I ask a
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:26.960]  bunch of questions what is tippity-top on the mind of Jesse Ventura well nothing
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:31.160]  really you know it was kind of a culture shock for me because when I lived
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:35.840]  down in Mexico you know I could rock some days three miles on the beach and
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:39.400]  never see another human and I drop on a plane and land right in the heart of
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:46.640]  Manhattan that's a culture shock oh I will tell you one fun story Alex before
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:51.800]  we get to the serious stuff I didn't watch television from December 31st
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:56.720]  over Sunday and I did that on purpose just to flush my brain out a little but
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:03.840]  I was playing golf and I was about two in the afternoon and the Ranger came up
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:07.560]  to me and he said governor did you hear what happened I said no what happened
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:12.920]  he said an 8.5 Richter earthquake hit chili and that there's a tsunami
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:18.760]  heading here and it's gonna hit you at 540 I said really I said I'm done I
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:24.360]  hurried to my car left my car through my clubs in I drove my hour and a half home
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:29.120]  down the dirt roads over the hill rushed home or my wife carry in my drug
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:35.000]  were with a tsunami coming got in the house grab my surfboard headed to the
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:42.300]  beach waited Alex and nothing happened yeah for those that don't know surfers
[02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:46.160]  love to go to the tsunamis everybody else is running the other way you're
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:50.920]  running towards it well hey it's when in a lifetime do you get a chance to surf
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:57.040]  a tsunami Jesse Ventura'd well maybe someday you'll get to serve a
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:03.400]  tsunami well just as long as it's not too big you know I was watching videos
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.600]  online of surfers surfing tsunamis I mean some of those things a hundred feet
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:12.320]  tall well you know Laird Hamilton is the greatest big wave surfer in the world
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:17.280]  and I read his book and I'll tell you one thing that's interesting Laird said
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:22.080]  that when he ever does these TV shows and radio they always introduce him as
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:27.520]  fearless and Laird said that's the equivalent of calling me an idiot
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:33.240]  every big wave I ride I experienced fear but he said I'm I'm a person who can
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:38.120]  take that fear and channel it into performance and there are people that
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.120]  are capable of doing that but I found it interesting when he said that that
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:47.120]  calling me fearless is like calling me an idiot absolutely it's fear that
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:53.240]  keeps us on our toes exactly we're gonna go to break governor but again I'm I
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:58.240]  am so excited that this book is number four and I'm sure it's gonna hit number

[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.800]  gonna ask you when we get back is he worried about the globalist coming
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:38.720]  after him is he worried because I was talking to his co-author Dick Russell
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:43.360]  about all the people he interviewed for the JFK assassination that got murdered

[02:07:49.280 --> 02:08:04.400]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network man let
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:08.520]  me tell you Ventura is so recharged being with him in person I never met
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:13.800]  anybody that has as much energy it's not a put-on it's just a just a dynamism
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:18.240]  but he was still overshadowing everything before he went back to Mexico for
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:21.920]  three months to recharge I could tell he was a little little little more tired
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:26.680]  than normal but he is definitely back and blasting with both barrels full power
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:31.840]  he just gave me some very exciting news I heard about this a few weeks ago but
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:35.160]  was told not to talk about it from some of the folks involved with the show but
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:39.720]  Jesse can now tell you because the emails the Twitter's coming in or asking
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:45.000]  me is Jesse Ventura's top rated on true TV beat out all the news networks but
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:50.760]  Fox out of the gates that's unheard of conspiracy theory Jesse Ventura is your
[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:56.280]  show coming back to television and win yes it is they far true TV with the
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:00.480]  grand let's give them credit because what they're doing shows a lot of courage
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:07.480]  true TV is re-op for at least eight and possibly ten more shows we're starting
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:11.640]  to put things together now we will probably actually ramp up and begin
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:17.520]  around June man that is exciting governor well they are kind of excited
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:23.080]  over it then my son Tyrell now will be a field producer he's gotten a nice big
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:28.520]  boost in position because they like his work and so you know things are going
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:32.800]  forward as soon as we choose June comes probably and a lot of people are
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:37.760]  emailing asking will Mr. Jones be involved well you know Alex you're such a
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:42.040]  fountain of information I don't think that there's any way on eight to ten
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:46.760]  conspiracies that you wouldn't have some great knowledge or nowhere to send us
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:52.720]  places to get knowledge so I'm certain that guy that you'll have a role in the
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:10:00.240]  in the second season man you're a sweetheart Governor Ventura now you were
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:03.200]  telling me off air you guys have got it what pared down to about 20 but they're
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:08.520]  talking about 8 10 12 episodes talking they said 8 for sure and possibly 10
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:14.040]  possibly 10 any sneak peeks on some of the things that are in the hopper being
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:18.560]  looked at right now no Alex I won't go that far because I hate to see though a
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:23.600]  battle will happen it always does between what what I want to do and what
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:29.960]  true TV wants to do but contrary to the Democrats and Republicans we will reach
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:34.480]  a compliment compromise and the show will go on the air but we'll we'll have to
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:39.640]  fight those battles yeah because I'm certain they'll be some and in light of
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:43.320]  that I would I would not want to say anything that will do because then if
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:47.560]  it doesn't come true it hurts my credibility absolutely certainly don't
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:54.080]  tip your hand people ask me they said how can mainstream television put on a
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:58.880]  truly objective program and I said I know Governor Ventura well he's a man of
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:03.200]  his word he's gonna produce this truthfully and follow the facts wherever
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:08.600]  they lead and then it basically just won't air if it if he has to compromise
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:14.400]  and it came out and people were stunned this is trailblazing nothing like this
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:20.000]  has ever been on national television I mean I want listeners to realize this
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  was a true first Governor Ventura how are you able to get something done that
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.880]  no one before it ever done well I guess you'd have to put that like this Alex
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:34.120]  how was I able to defeat the Democrats and Republicans and become the governor
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:39.040]  of Minnesota and only raised three hundred thousand dollars to do it
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:47.400]  perseverance smarts will it's just ideas and passion in that and again I can't
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:51.520]  really fully answer it because like I said when we first thought we could do
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:55.880]  this show I told my crew I had a gentleman's bet with them and I said you
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:00.200]  know we're gonna do all these and we'll all get paid but I said I believe at the
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.520]  11th hour they're gonna pull the plug on this thing and it'll never see the
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:09.120]  light of day well I'm happy to say I lost that bet because as I said two TV
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:13.400]  showed great courage and they aired a mile and they didn't edit them and they
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:18.760]  did nothing because we we did a mile out in California and sent them all to
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:23.160]  them and we got them ready to go and they got on board and didn't I just spoke
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:27.800]  to Mark Juris who's the head of two TV and this guy's beside himself so
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:33.480]  excited to do another eight to ten Wow well yeah and their number one hit show
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:40.120]  almost beating Fox I mean you talk about royal flush here and and I talked to
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:45.360]  Braverman when you were back in Mexico hyping one of the last shows on air if
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:48.720]  those that don't know one of the fellows involved and he said Alex you would
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:52.080]  believe the big stars that are contacting us and I went through some of the
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:55.200]  names because I know some of them and he goes wow yeah that's that's some of them
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:59.920]  but he said he described it as Hollywood wants to keep it in the left
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:04.080]  right paradigm Jesse Ventura is shattering that left right paradigm the
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:08.000]  media calls questioning anything the government does a conspiracy theory
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.720]  that's outside that left right orthodoxy and that there's a war inside Hollywood
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:17.240]  in the media where most of the big names we know and see even in news not just in
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:21.320]  entertainment know about the New World Order know about eugenics know about
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:24.960]  population reduction know about what's happening and they don't want to be put
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:30.000]  in the left right box but Braverman said there is big Hollywood pressure from
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:36.880]  people like Steven Spielberg to keep it left right and and because as Hollywood
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:41.280]  goes so goes the rest of the world and now they just can't put this label on
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:44.360]  people that are questioning the official story and who have government
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:47.800]  documents I mean every time you go on TV they say you're just a conspiracy
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:51.680]  terrorist or you know you're making this up and you point out no I'm not I'm
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:55.760]  going off things like Operation Northwoods I mean here's Operation Northwoods
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:00.360]  the actual document right here and we got ABC News US government plan to
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:05.040]  terrorize and stage fake terror attacks what can you say about the huge paradigm
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:08.240]  shift that's happening and the type of feedback you're getting from Hollywood
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:13.040]  well I haven't really been to Hollywood as you said as I said Alex I flew from
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:18.000]  Mexico straight to New York and I'll go to I'll go to Los Angeles Sunday and I'll
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:23.200]  be there through Wednesday so you know I probably get a better feel for it when
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:26.680]  I get out there and I really wouldn't want to speculate as I said I haven't had
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:31.720]  any contactors where I live in Mexico I don't have a phone or any of that stuff
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:35.800]  so I really haven't spoken to anybody but Alex you want to hear another good
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:40.640]  one that's a little you know off the subject for a second sure my book right
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:47.480]  now and I urge everybody there's three new books out this week I have mine
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:52.880]  dog the bounty hunters got one out and I don't care if dog beats me or not I
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:57.280]  kind of like dog he's kind of an interesting guy but here's the one we're
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:04.680]  beating the crap on a Carl Rose book and that's the guy I want to beat I want
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:10.080]  this book to beat Carl Rose because Carl Rose book I haven't read it yet but a
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:14.040]  friend of mine read it and he told me that the book is trying to rewrite
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:20.240]  history oh yeah saying basically that Saddam had WMD's and things you know you
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:25.400]  said you'd like to waterboard Cheney what about Rove you know I actually saw
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:30.960]  Rove when I did the today's show Matt Lauer introduced it right before I my
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.800]  segment I was standing there I just stood back and kept watching it but I will
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:42.400]  give Rove one bit of credit he has lost a great deal await well I guess that is
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:48.080]  credit for him but he is such a wicked person well he sure wasn't to me he came
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:52.480]  almost running over to me to shake my hand so I don't know what that was all
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:57.280]  about well he knows you're a big political contender but as Tyrell said
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:01.040]  you want to do the TV show and some more books but you're leaning towards
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:05.760]  riding off into the sunset I hope that's not the case well you know I'll tell you
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:12.400]  what actually happened and you can thank Dick Russell for this in my in my
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:16.640]  last book don't start the revolution without me you remember I wrote that
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:21.480]  last chapter of fiction yes you know I made the run for the president with
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:27.360]  Robert Kennedy Jr. and I get shot and all that stuff well I was gonna end it
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:31.480]  right there I was going to die in the end of that book and I was never going
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:36.480]  to do anything public again I was gonna destroy Jesse Ventura I created him and
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:40.920]  I was gonna destroy him then and then go on and you can thank Dick Russell
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:45.720]  because he taught me out of it and he only put me in a coma so obviously I've
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:51.520]  came back from the coma oh wait a minute are you starting to starting to maybe
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:57.080]  think about 2012 no no no no no I just mean it's still considered to be in the
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:02.160]  public no Alex I I have no desire at this time to run for public office at all
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:07.160]  I think that in many ways I can be as much or more effective in what I'm
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:10.840]  doing right now that's right you can go off and cogitate kind of in the
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:14.160]  mountains like a prophet and then occasionally come back to the wicked
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:19.040]  city and enlighten us well and then what's good about it Alex is I can come
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:22.800]  up here and stir everything up and then all this stuff and then I can run back
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:29.560]  to Mexico and leave you without a collateral damage you know I well I mean
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:32.480]  I probably shouldn't bring stuff up on air without asking you but I don't want
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:35.800]  to give you more work to do but may we ever see Jesse Ventura sitting in the
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:42.000]  Alex Jones broadcast seat for me you know like I said you need a vacation you
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.120]  know maybe if you want to take a vacation sometime I won't promise anything but if
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:50.480]  you want to take a vacation sometime I might sit there but the people who
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:54.520]  last understand something it'll be different half are the knowledge that
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:59.360]  you have oh yes you do you have a lot of different knowledge I don't have I
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:03.120]  have some knowledge you don't have well okay and together we'll make a hole I
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:08.720]  guess exactly are you kidding Jesse I would that's such a great idea I hope
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:13.880]  you do it listen so much is going on so much is happening I want to put the
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:17.680]  call out again for people to buy the book not just to beat Carl Rove your
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:21.600]  show being number one on true TV one of the top shows on cable for a new show
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.720]  is unheard of the fact that your books are bestsellers that this one's a best
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:29.840]  seller I mean this is really the alternative media and alternative views
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:34.240]  starting to supplant the mainstream media the new numbers came out last month
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.080]  that now the alternative media together is bigger than the mainstream media so I
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:43.080]  think we see these dinosaurs really starting to realize that their time has
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:48.000]  ended well I'm not sure about that or maybe that it's the fact that even
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.800]  better maybe this country is starting to wake up absolutely or maybe this
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:56.800]  country is starting to people are starting to get finally frustrated
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:02.320]  enough with the media that we have and the status quo that's going on and
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:06.520]  has been for years and years that hopefully we're accomplishing that
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:11.440]  because you know one thing I don't agree with them totally but because of some
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:16.360]  of the people in it but I actually like the idea that the tea parties out there
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:21.360]  stirring it up too absolutely we're going to break I want to come back and ask
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:24.580]  you that big question that dick Russell brought up quite a bit all people he
[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:27.920]  knows that have been killed who exposed this stuff and why you've made the
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:32.920]  decision to be so bold because folks when I say this book is hardcore we'll go
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:36.360]  over some of the chapters later we'll also open the phones up and I've got a

[02:23:55.800 --> 02:24:01.280]  introduction he is our guest thank you for joining us governor we've seen
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:06.760]  massive demonization and censorship of 9-11 truth I've never seen such a blitz
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:11.200]  but now we have 1100 architects and engineers going public saying inside
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:15.760]  job the evidence is coming out it looks like we've got the establishment on the
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:20.680]  defense right now well you know Alex that's a great lead-in because you know
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:25.960]  usually we're on the defense and I think it's time we go on the offense what I'd
[02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:31.680]  like to do as you know the Huffington Post censored the Arianna Huffington had
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:36.280]  been on my case for about two years to contribute to the Huffington Post so I
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:40.880]  did my first article and then I followed it up with my second one and of course
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:45.200]  they censored it they had it on for an hour and then pulled it what I'd like to
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:50.680]  appeal to go on the offense to all your listeners email the Huffington Post and
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:56.600]  demand to know right Jesse Ventura was censored on the Huffington Post and I
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:00.440]  really would like to appeal to all your listeners to do that let's go on the
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:06.720]  offense stick it to them absolutely the Huffington Post requested that I write
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:11.280]  an article for them about a year ago we sent it to them they said make changes
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:15.720]  and I just said forget it you asked for this and and you were nice enough to
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:19.440]  write two articles for them and they took the first one about government drug
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.600]  dealing but posted your 9-11 article about building seven for about an hour
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:30.640]  and then pulled it it's just amazing yeah and so you know again I know what
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:35.560]  your listeners are like out there they're very loyal to you Alex and so send
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:40.400]  those emails to the Huffington Post and send a barrage of them imagine if they
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:45.040]  got a hundred thousand or more emails demanding no to know why Jesse Ventura
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:49.120]  was censored from the Huffington Post well I think more than that we need to
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:53.120]  vote by buying the book and not let them censor it and we also if you want to
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:56.880]  get serious go after their sponsors because they might just like to traffic
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:01.240]  from emails overall and and and think they're getting attention of it but I
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:05.640]  mean that's a good idea but there's got to be some other way to punish these
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:09.760]  people how about folks go get the article that we reposted at info wars
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:13.200]  dot com in fact print it for me so I have the title what was the title Jesse
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:17.040]  people can find it all over the web and then that way we can email it out to all
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:21.320]  the media I think that's the best way to really protest this is to make sure
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:26.640]  that's in everybody's email inbox well it on the top it says Huffington Post
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:32.280]  Jesse Ventura article to American and in parentheses American conspiracies and
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:37.920]  and the title is what really happened on September the 11th what really happened
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:42.080]  on title what really happened on September 11th what really happened on
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:46.240]  September 11th Jesse Ventura search that find the article that was censored
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.520]  it's all over the web now and get it out to even more people but you know what
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:53.880]  Jesse I think them censoring it only backfired on them well I'm hoping so
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:58.680]  we can make it backfire on them I think so too and I'll tell you this I won't
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:03.720]  ever write for him again absolutely I mean they come to you and then they
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:07.560]  censor it getting back to what Dick Russell was saying two days ago he was
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:12.600]  for those that don't know a top JFK researcher several best-selling books he
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:15.120]  was talking about all these witnesses he would interview who they would then
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:19.280]  murder and we know how many people the that the establishment is assassinated
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:24.280]  and you really are coming out bold now do you want to say on record that Jesse
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:29.760]  Ventura will never commit suicide yes I'll say on the record absolutely Jesse
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:37.120]  Ventura will never ever commit suicide and I second that I will never commit
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:41.480]  suicide I had the DC madam on air say that three months before they killed her
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:47.640]  and I had been talking for a month before they killed Gary Webb the pulled
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:51.160]  surprise winner on CIA drug dealing that they've been breaking into his house and
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:54.520]  and he was getting ready to come on the show when his new book came out and they
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:59.400]  shotgunned him twice in the head and the police said Jesse it's very normal to
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:06.320]  shoot yourself twice in the head as a train Navy SEAL is that poppycock
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:15.240]  that's about the only answer I could give you Alex is to burst out laughing it
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:20.960]  is ridiculous come on man you are the only way you could shoot yourself twice
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:28.960]  in the head is if you missed with the first one I know it's incredible it they
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:33.920]  just think we're so stupid well you know Alex that they did that's how they
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:38.760]  survived is an apathetic public you know a public that doesn't want to be
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:42.480]  involved a public that doesn't want to pay attention and that's what's wrong
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:47.080]  with so much of America today everybody looks around in their little tiny world
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:51.560]  and they think well everywhere I see everything is good and as long as it
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:56.360]  doesn't upset what I can see I'm not gonna get involved and the thing is in
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:01.120]  our country you should get involved if you don't get involved a bunch of
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:05.720]  crooks will take over that's right you know if you don't hold government's
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:09.920]  feet to the fire you will get bad government we're going to break long

[02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:22.840]  paper today flu shots futile government study finds that it didn't even protect
[02:33:22.840 --> 02:33:28.200]  people and the shot was dangerous this is directly for the document cam folks
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:34.280]  watching at prisonplanet.tv FDA US Food and Drug Administration recall FDA
[02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:39.600]  dot gov see that folks they're recalling all the vaccine a month ago we had the

[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:48.840]  bad and hurting people governor you've been proven right again why did you
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:55.360]  instinctually come out against the flu shot well I just exactly what you said
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:34:01.840]  instinct I never got a flu shot I refuse to get that flu shot and I don't know I
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:07.000]  never touched the flu so why would I need a shot to prevent it now I'm not
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:11.120]  saying I couldn't catch the flu I certainly I guess could but I don't
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:15.320]  know it just doesn't you know with all with all the bad stuff that they can
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:21.800]  stick in those things I don't need that stuff in my body absolutely I want to
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:25.520]  get into the book in a moment but I've got a lot of questions that I wanted to
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:34.440]  raise to you getting back to the media attacks how they're bouncing off of you
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:40.280]  I mean you're being attacked by Fox News radio other TV networks you go on these
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:45.600]  shows they try to criticize you and then you just completely take the air out of
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:50.080]  their sails laying out the facts it's it's it's almost like we're fighting
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:53.600]  paper tigers and we're beginning to see that these people aren't invincible
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:58.560]  well and the thing is most of them have never done any research other than
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:03.160]  soundbite television and what they what they sent to him over a teleprompter you
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:07.240]  know to read a couple soundbites like that did you happen to catch me on the
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:13.400]  view it was an incredibly powerful well the thing was I was amazed Barbara
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:20.200]  Walters was my main adversary and I found that funny because she says to me
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:25.440]  governor you're telling me they would intentionally kill 3,000 people blah blah
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:31.720]  blah blah blah and I said Barbara I'll give you another example the Gulf of
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:37.560]  Tonkinance it never happened they killed 58,000 of my generation in Vietnam and
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:41.480]  who knows maybe a million Vietnamese
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.760]  Miller Riley called you a pinhead last night I mean this is a guy with his past
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:52.960]  that I don't think really has any credibility what do you call this is
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:57.520]  the second time now he's called me a pinhead yes he called me a pinhead for
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:02.960]  he played the clip from the view and basically called you a pinhead well you
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:07.800]  know I ran into a Riley at Fox and not boy he sure doesn't do that to me when
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:12.080]  he's face-to-face with me because Bill O'Reilly's afraid to have me on his
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:16.600]  show because I don't call us to him and I'll tell you I'll give you I'll give
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:22.880]  you listeners a good lie from Bill O'Reilly he had Ted Turner on once and
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:26.200]  I don't know Ted looked like he was really out of it when he was on there
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:30.920]  because he didn't seem sharp and O'Reilly made the statement that the
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:38.800]  killing fields in Cambodia were caused because we left Vietnam too soon the
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.320]  first thing is we weren't at war technically in Cambodia or Laos we are
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:49.160]  war in Vietnam and the killing fields were caused because Richard Nixon and
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:54.240]  Henry Kissinger secretly carpet bombed the country into the stone age that's
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:36:59.080]  how come the camera was able to come down and do that ethnic cleansing so
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:03.920]  you've got Bill O'Reilly all the time rewriting history and I confronted him
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:08.640]  with that in the in the in the Fox lobby and he wouldn't say anything and I
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:14.720]  said O'Reilly I first said to him when were you in Vietnam and he couldn't you
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:18.800]  know of course he's never been in Vietnam or if he was in Vietnam it was
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:23.320]  probably recently you know he wasn't back in there when the war were going on
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:28.040]  so how would he know what the hell went on over there well Zabigny Brzezinski
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:34.720]  who was running that as you know it advising Nixon and others he wrote a
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:39.400]  book two years ago bragging and people can pull the quotes up where he said we
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:43.600]  funded the Khmer Rouge against the Communist and that the US government
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:47.840]  gave him four billion dollars so it was actually our criminal government that
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:51.240]  didn't just carpet bomb the government so that the Khmer Rouge could come in
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:56.160]  they financed the Khmer Rouge to do it yeah and I you know I'm not going to
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:38:01.800]  that's not have you read the book by Colonel Fletcher County yes I have well
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:05.560]  isn't that interesting when he talks about what happened at the end of
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:09.480]  World War two with that meeting that took place between Shanghai Shet
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:16.680]  Stalin Churchill and Roosevelt were they literally laid out what was going to
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:21.600]  happen to war from that point on they said all wars after World War two would
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:25.880]  be fought in third world countries they would be fought with the military
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:31.080]  having no direct objective to achieve victory in the war now isn't that
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:35.920]  exactly what's happened since World War two with every war since sure it's these
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:40.520]  phantom menace covert wars just meant to destabilize the third world so they
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:44.040]  can't ever industrially develop the threat in the West and that's actually
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:50.720]  in the British Royal Commission plan 1949 yeah you know it's just amazing to
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:55.160]  read about Proudie's book and everything he said when you look at history has
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:59.800]  come to pass absolutely and he clearly put out the evidence that the military
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:03.680]  industrial complex killed Kennedy that's another example they can laugh at you
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:07.960]  and I call conspiracy theorists when we have all the facts but over 90% of
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:12.480]  Americans now in major polls believe the government's lying about Kennedy so
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:18.760]  again that I saw that one I think it was a CBS other poll where people said it's
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:22.400]  now a majority the people that don't believe the government's told us the
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:28.160]  truth about 9-11 exactly and I saw an Angus and Reed New York Times poll four
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:33.920]  years ago in 2006 where 84% want a new investigation and believe they're being
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:40.600]  lied to so 84% of us are kooks 84% of us are bad look you did an episode on
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:43.640]  mind control and it's been declassified they do have these candidates they're
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:47.720]  always in psychiatric care and they always disappear for a few weeks or a
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:53.880]  few months this bedel guy has all the earmarks and the reason I predicted in
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:57.440]  the last three months that that they were gonna have 9-11 truthers stayed
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:01.280]  some type of terror attack is there was no history of 9-11 truthers ever being
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:05.600]  violent or doing anything wrong you have the majority the public waking up to
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:11.120]  this and I saw Glenn Beck Bill O'Reilly Chris Matthews and others with a
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:15.920]  talking point the last three months saying 9-11 truth are gonna stage terror
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:20.520]  attacks mark my words now how would they out of the blue just say this if they
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:25.000]  weren't prepping people and then you have bedel and the whole thing is very
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.280]  suspicious his parents warned him he was under psychiatric care he disappeared
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:33.400]  for months governor your take on what happened with the Pentagon shooting
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:39.160]  well yeah that's exactly it and I thought I thought I was going crazy when
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:44.040]  because when that happened my first reaction was oh my god a Manchurian
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:48.480]  candidate and then I had to like stop myself ago I must be getting in too
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:54.720]  deep into this stuff but Lord be old I probably am not okay well here's an
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:41:00.880]  article you know Alex I gotta ask you a question here sometimes this stuff gets
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:06.240]  so overwhelming to me that I really and I gotta tell you honestly there's
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.400]  certain times I start to question myself on this how do you stay away from
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:17.440]  filing into that syndrome well what you do is you just look at the evidence you
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:22.000]  analyze it and if it isn't a staged event the evidence will come out to that
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.440]  if it is a staged event you will see the airmarks I mean here's an example
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:30.400]  Christmas Day we'd forgotten eggs I was driving around looking for a place that
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:34.640]  was open my wife sent me out to get eggs and I'm listening to the radio and they
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:38.040]  announced there's been an underwear bombing on a flight from Amsterdam to
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:42.760]  Detroit I go in by the eggs come back out and they're already got shirt off on
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:48.040]  Fox News radio who by the way makes a bunch of money off of it saying don't
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:52.160]  worry we just decided to put in naked body scanners though I knew he'd ordered
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:56.320]  them a year before when he'd still been in office the head of Homeland Security
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:42:02.440]  and then immediately several witnesses Kurt Haskell and others a lawyer said a
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:06.960]  sharp-dressed man led the underwear bomber in Amsterdam up through the body
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:11.040]  scanners he didn't have to show ID didn't have to show passport argued with
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:16.560]  them basically had a security clearance got him on the plane without ID so then
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:20.480]  I said this is a weekend to it I had Haskell on I said okay you want to
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:24.180]  interview him for the show it's amazing his wife saw it other witnesses then the
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:28.280]  FBI showed up and basically threatening called him a liar in the media then
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:31.800]  other witnesses came out about the sharp-dressed man then Haskell said once
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:36.360]  they were put into the customs the dog ran over and alerted to this other man
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:41.760]  who previously it looked like had been with the bomber and his bag had a bomb
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:45.600]  they said get out there's a bomb they arrested the guy the FBI lied and said
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:50.160]  we arrested no one then a month later they had to admit we did arrest somebody
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:55.960]  it's national security and here's the Detroit news undersecretary of the State
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:01.800]  Department Kennedy Patrick F. Kennedy said that an unnamed US intelligence
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:06.200]  agency this is on screen right now true a terrorist suspect kept visa to avoid
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:10.640]  tipping off larger investigation and then when you read it it says they were
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:17.320]  ordered to let him get on the plane and wave his visa so boom same thing with the
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:21.080]  Fort Hood shooter they wanted to busting they were ordered for two years to leave
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:26.360]  him alone same thing with all of these events so once you know how they do it
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:32.120]  and and and once you see them really promote something and push it and and I
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:35.000]  don't want to waste I mean we want to hear from you said to me ranting but it
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.120]  was the same story with the Joe Stack flying into the IRS building all the
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:46.120]  same story Jesse okay well that cleans it up a little bit but I mean my point is
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:50.480]  I went on air in the week after that happened and I said no it may just be a
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:56.360]  lone Muslim nut but then in every case it's like the 9-11 hijackers I've had
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:00.160]  the head of the US Embassy in Jeddah Saudi Arabia on they were ordered even
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:04.320]  though they were on a terror list to let them in and the CIA called and said they
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:12.480]  work for us this is part of national security that's on record too how do
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:18.040]  you find all this stuff Alex well I become completely obsessed and addicted
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:22.320]  to researching it and you know I saw springman that the head of the Embassy
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:26.280]  in the Toronto Star the month after 9-11 I interviewed him then I've
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:30.120]  interviewed him many other times since then I had him on a month ago and he said
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:34.440]  clearly the underwear bomber is the same deal and he was the head of the Embassy
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:40.680]  interesting stuff well but but you know how criminals work though they do things
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:45.200]  in a pathological way meaning yeah over and over again so it's well and the
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:50.640]  other thing is to if it works one time it'll work again exactly I mean take
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:55.040]  Northwood's Kennedy says no in 63 but then what do they do a year later at
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:58.880]  Tonkin what do they do a few years later in 67 with the Liberty I mean they do
[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:02.360]  the same thing over and over again what is what is Northwood's right here in my
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:06.320]  hand folks what does Operation Northwood's say they'll do they'll bomb DC
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:13.600]  bomb Miami graze troops at US bases wound them grazing troops what did we see at
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:16.000]  the Pentagon
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:26.200]  we exactly what you said and and and who sat at the feet of LL Limonser who set
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:31.360]  up the continuity of government plan under Nixon but Dick Cheney and Donald
[02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:36.440]  Rumsfeld yeah well then I love that thing in 92 when they were part of that
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:42.080]  think tank you know where they where they did that the experiment or
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:46.880]  whatever rumsfeld were for which Cheney the whole thing and they get on and the
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:51.880]  question was how do we keep the United States the soul superpower now with the
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:55.920]  fall of the Soviet Union and they go through this litany of everything and
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:00.560]  in the end it's got the summary to implement everything we've recommended
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:05.120]  will take many many many years unless the Pearl Harbor type of event were to
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:11.160]  occur and they said 3,000 dead like Pearl Harbor what happened on 9-11
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:18.120]  exactly oh it's incredible but but see that's the problem you hit on something
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:23.440]  key here most the so-called conspiracy theorist do just say everything's a
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:27.280]  conspiracy without evidence and so I'm a conspiracy you're a conspiracy Ron
[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:32.280]  Paul's a conspiracy with no evidence ignoring the fruit of what we do but
[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:35.760]  that's not really the public's fault if the government has been caught lying
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:39.320]  more than they tell the truth and there's a total loss of confidence then
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:41.480]  there's just going to be a loss of confidence in everything what do we do
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:46.240]  about that you know how I counter that Alex I got that again today where they
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:51.040]  said are you a conspiracy theorist and I looked at who Alan Holmes asked me that
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:56.560]  and I look back at him so Alan the government's a conspiracy theorist too
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:02.120]  they've never proved anything I said look at all the murders that took place in
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:07.200]  the 60s nearly 70s all those assassinations Martin Luther King you
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:13.480]  know Bobby Kennedy Jack Kenny dog there was never a trial for any of these guys
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:19.920]  notice how there's never a trial for any of these assassins that happened well
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:23.920]  we know under Cohen tell pro they got declassified in 77 that the FBI would
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:28.720]  stage events stage crimes and blame it on people we know Obama's regulations
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:33.080]  are cast Sunstein wrote a big policy paper saying infiltrate 9-11 truth and
[02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:37.720]  commit acts of violence so we can put them in jail yeah I couldn't believe
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:42.560]  when I read that about that guy from Harvard that that wrote that paper saying
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:47.000]  that the 9-11 truth there's no other stuff that they should be you know put
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:52.600]  under surveillance and all this other stuff why because we question our
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:59.240]  government you know I can't I have to sit and think that all the founding
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:02.880]  fathers of this country have got to be turned it over in their graves right
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:07.280]  now they are we're gonna skip this break coming up with Jesse Ventura be with
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:11.120]  us into the next hour I want to start getting into the book here in just a
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:15.200]  moment chapter by chapter because believe me folks when I tell you you need to get
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:19.200]  this book when I was sent an advance copy I didn't carry Ventura's last book
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:22.680]  because when I did call to get it it was sold out I got involved early because I
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:27.280]  want people to read this I mean this is just incredible information but let's
[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:32.320]  bring up a few other issues we know Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97 told
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:36.680]  the Army Times we have earthquake weapons we have weather weapons so do
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:39.960]  other governments a lot of that's been declassified the new White House
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:44.360]  science are says they are geoengineering the earth manipulating the weather right
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:47.880]  now that'd be a great episode because it's all pretty much admitted but but we
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:52.320]  could go deeper into it well we kind of did that with heart and that's where I'm
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:57.000]  going yep with the chilly earthquake and with the and this is even on seeing
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:03.200]  in and with the Haiti earthquake they reported the sky had like an aurora
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:07.560]  borealis even during the day in the minutes before the earthquake and I'm
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:11.000]  not saying these were staged but if the government admits they have these
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:16.600]  systems I mean do we at least investigate it yeah it's very interesting
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:20.720]  they did that that it was the same thing in Indonesia too when they have the huge
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:25.400]  tsunami there there was no indication of it there was no earthquake before and
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:30.840]  I remember when I was doing my show of course Alex not you but Alex on the show
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:35.000]  who's always the cynic he said to me governor are you trying to say that they
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:41.920]  would intentionally kill all these people for no reason and I said Alex I'm not
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:46.400]  saying that but I'm saying they could just be testing this thing out and maybe
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:50.360]  when they test it out this is the result what do you think they're gonna come back
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:56.040]  then and say oops exactly some mathematicians we posted this on info
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:00.480]  wars in prison planet a few weeks ago have looked at the frequency of mega
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:05.720]  earthquakes these big earthquakes eight and above and it's mathematically getting
[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:11.320]  very suspicious that they keep hitting right in population centers yeah that's
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:16.280]  what that is pretty interesting man but then again of course I'm playing the
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:20.120]  devil's advocate Alex not necessarily big but you know we've always had
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:24.680]  earthquakes even before we have the technology so it may not be fair to
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:29.200]  attribute every earthquake to them oh no I totally agree with you I mean I think
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:32.880]  these are probably just natural but if the government admits they have this
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:37.680]  then you've got to start looking into it I mean we are in the 21st century you
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:41.560]  know what's interesting about it too was that treaty that everybody signed years
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:46.680]  ago saying that they would not use if anyone developed the capability to
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:52.400]  control the weather that it could not be used in a situation of war or in all
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:57.680]  that but I suppose they view it as well or not at war well that's another great
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:51:02.480]  point that you just made and let's get into something that's a little bit more
[02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:08.280]  fun and not so hardcore but also interesting I heard months ago that
[02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:12.760]  you'd been involved in a secret film project we now know what it is what more
[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:15.960]  can you tell us about your project with the Wachowski brothers of course of
[02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:19.800]  Matrix and V for Vendetta fame
[02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:27.920]  I'll tell you what that was the most bizarre movie shoot I've ever been on in my life I have no
[02:51:27.920 --> 02:51:35.080]  idea what the end result of this movie will be I haven't got a clue and I and
[02:51:35.080 --> 02:51:41.000]  I'll tell you why these guys they're way out there but they're great people I'll
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:44.720]  tell you that but these guys are on another level when it comes to
[02:51:44.720 --> 02:51:51.640]  creativity Alex what they did to me here was my role they brought me in and I
[02:51:51.640 --> 02:51:56.960]  spent an hour and what here's what I do know the movie will take place a hundred
[02:51:56.960 --> 02:52:03.280]  years in the future so I come in and they they do an hour and a half makeup
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:09.400]  job on me to where they put me in almost like a wret suit type thing they gave me
[02:52:09.400 --> 02:52:14.200]  multi-colored dreadlocks all the way down to the middle of my back and my
[02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:20.560]  shoulders I get a big huge blue man shoe type goatee beard with the beads in it
[02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:24.880]  and all that stuff and then they gave me in the center of my forehead almost it
[02:52:24.880 --> 02:52:33.320]  looked like almost a bird eye right and here was my part I didn't have to
[02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:43.760]  memorize the line a lot of Wachowski sat across from me and simply all they
[02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:49.720]  wanted to do is ask me questions about how I felt about the war in Iraq and the
[02:52:49.720 --> 02:52:55.360]  whole Bush Cheney thing and all of that stuff and they allowed me to just vent
[02:52:55.360 --> 02:53:00.880]  but the way I looked did you ever see John Travolta when he what he looked
[02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:05.360]  like and it was a bomb of a movie but that thing battlefield earth oh yes that's
[02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:11.160]  on that's about what I looked like even more bizarre and so I'm sitting there
[02:53:11.160 --> 02:53:17.960]  looking this bizarre talking about things that are a passion to me right now
[02:53:17.960 --> 02:53:24.800]  and just allowed to freewheel so I'm gonna be very very interested I can't
[02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:29.960]  wait to see what in the hell this movie's about and I'll get us back to the
[02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:37.280]  Huffington Post for a moment Ariana Huffington was next and they had heard
[02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:42.880]  they had heard decked out she looked like the Queen of Sheba or Cleopatra and I
[02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:49.120]  assume they did the same thing with her now was there blue screen behind you or
[02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:53.800]  did they tell you anything else about well no I did it you there wasn't any
[02:53:53.800 --> 02:53:57.800]  blue screen or everything but then they took me in another room and they did
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:01.840]  that modern technology where they have you face all different forward
[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:06.360]  directions and do all that stuff with your body to where they can actually
[02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:12.360]  recreate you without you being there yeah so they're gonna insert the virtual
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:17.640]  reality version of Jesse Ventura into whatever dreamscape they want exactly
[02:54:17.640 --> 02:54:22.400]  I can't wait for this film to come out because it was one of them it was the
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:27.800]  most bizarre shoot that I've ever been on in my life the only shoot that could
[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:37.560]  all compare to it was when I did that episode on the X-Files, Jose Chung's The
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:41.840]  M outer space which I might add by all the X-Files crazy people that watch
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:45.920]  that shouldn't come crazy but all the you know the passion people that watch the
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:50.720]  X-Files and all that it made that one made it into I think the top 10 X-Files
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:56.200]  of all time but this shoot was the the X-Files were strange but this shoot
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:01.360]  would beat the X-Files by 10 Wow well it I mean you don't get bigger than the
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:05.960]  Wachowski brothers right and so I mean hell you start alongside Arnold
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:10.360]  Schwarzenegger and Running Man and Predator but but but now it's Jesse
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:13.960]  Ventura and a Wachowski brothers movie do you have any idea when it's coming out
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:18.240]  no idea whatsoever like I said I don't even know what the whole script is I
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:22.760]  you know I went there I did what they asked me to do I was happy to do so as a
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:27.080]  great experience that day they're super professional they're great people and I
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:34.840]  have great respect for them were they secretive about it yeah I'd say they
[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:39.600]  were because you never saw a script they just told me what they wanted me to do
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:43.400]  they just here here would they put me into the wardrobe they made me up look
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:48.160]  like like I said John Travolta and Battlefield Earth I most and then they
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:52.720]  just I just sat there you know and it was so funny Alex because when I got in
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:56.920]  to talking about it and I think I achieved what they want I completely
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:03.640]  forgot about what I looked like and I'm sure that's what they wanted out of it
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:08.880]  well certainly if it's criticizing the Iraq war it's gonna be powerful I guess
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:14.040]  it's probably gonna be like Android you know robotic humans a hundred years
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:18.640]  from now with some history of what happened in our times I would imagine
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:24.280]  Alex that's exactly what it is basically it's it's them assessing and
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:30.480]  analyzing what happened now so it's gonna be like a history of what happened
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:35.400]  in our times yeah only a hundred years from now it's strange people like what
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:39.560]  you'll see what I look like and it'll probably I'm just guessing we'll see if
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:42.880]  I'm right in a year or two whenever this comes out it will probably then morph
[02:56:42.880 --> 02:56:47.520]  into the future and then a fictional future kind of the Wachowski brothers
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:52.720]  guessing what human development and merger with the machines like Ray Kurzweil
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:58.760]  talks about happening well that's as good as mine well we're gonna find out as
[02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:02.520]  soon as this movie comes out and I guess you don't know what a tentative name is
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:08.240]  either nothing all I did it was a one-day shoot they did they did what
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:13.320]  they called a favorite nations contract that's where when you go who else oh
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:17.920]  they had Salman Rushdie to I didn't see him I saw I'm trying to recall the list
[02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:23.640]  of all the people they got but Salman Rushdie is gonna be in it and and so
[02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:28.040]  all I know and when I mean favorite nations that me that's where they go
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:34.200]  out and if they hire about ten stars to do cameos you all get the pay the same
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:38.400]  amount of money I mean they got a flat rate of money here it is if you want to
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:41.280]  do it and so but but there's no real you know
[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:45.840]  that's what happened with scanner darkly that I was in I basically got paid
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:49.320]  the same thing as Keanu Reeves or Woody Harrelson would own a rider and it was
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:53.520]  the same thing in waking life Rick Linklater just said I want you to rant
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:57.160]  about the left-right paradigm and I drove around for a few hours and that's
[02:57:57.160 --> 02:58:01.320]  basically was edited down into the film so that sounds sounds pretty exciting
[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:07.600]  oh yeah I'm gonna be real interested to see this film incredible Jesse we're
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:11.320]  gonna come back we got two more segments with you I want to start in depth
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:14.760]  getting into the book already a best-seller folks only been out what

[02:58:34.360 --> 02:58:41.040]  decade we are the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good
[02:58:41.040 --> 02:58:45.040]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[02:58:45.040 --> 02:58:48.840]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:52.920]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:58:52.920 --> 02:58:57.160]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[02:58:57.160 --> 02:59:01.440]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:59:01.440 --> 02:59:05.400]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:59:05.400 --> 02:59:09.800]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:13.520]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:17.680]  power from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:21.480]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[02:59:21.480 --> 02:59:24.960]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:30.160]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[02:59:40.640 --> 03:00:00.000]  Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCM Radio...
[03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:21.240]  I tell you Jesse Ventura he is the real deal and he said I'm gonna produce this
[03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:25.280]  show the way I want I'm gonna find out the truth he believed global warming was
[03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:30.400]  real found out it was a fraud admitted he was wrong he didn't really believe
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:35.040]  Manchurian candidates were real went to the research it was there heart I mean
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:40.240]  the global death plot the global extermination plan and now the show is
[03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:43.920]  picked back up will be back on I guess the next year or so looking to start
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:48.320]  shooting again coming up in the middle of the summer we've only got this
[03:00:48.320 --> 03:00:52.680]  segment one more with Jesse Ventura and Jesse let's let's walk through the
[03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:57.520]  book here I'm gonna get a document cam shot for prisonplanet.tv viewers I don't
[03:00:57.520 --> 03:01:01.720]  want to say what what is your favorite chapter but what chapter do you think is
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:06.560]  the most most hardcore or the most frightening
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:11.640]  hard core of the most frightening well to me in our modern times you know
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:16.920]  naturally 9-11 because that's what set the table for everything that's going on
[03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:22.680]  right now now sir for in my lifetime I think it was the assassination of Jack
[03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:27.920]  Kennedy because I believe when they when they could take out our president
[03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:32.120]  that gave them great courage to do anything they wanted take out our
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:36.200]  president get away with it that gave them great courage that if you could kill
[03:01:36.200 --> 03:01:41.320]  the president get away with it you can get away with anything
[03:01:41.320 --> 03:01:46.280]  absolutely I mean if they could kill him in plain view as a message to those that
[03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:50.040]  are informed that hey this is a dictatorship of the CIA what do you
[03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:52.840]  think well you you may not have seen it about a month ago Ron Paul gave a
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:57.320]  speech and said there's been a coup in America the CIA ships in the drugs and
[03:01:57.320 --> 03:02:02.840]  they run America well I don't know if they run America but they damn sure do
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:06.880]  the drug business because that's how they're able to do the clandestine
[03:02:06.880 --> 03:02:10.480]  things that they can do without having to report it to the Congress see the
[03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:15.000]  Congress allocates all the money but if they can get money from an outside
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  source well then they're not responsible to Congress so then then they
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:23.080]  become rogues or cowboys out there and they can literally do any type of
[03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:29.920]  operation they want without clearing it with anything is this what book are you
[03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:38.680]  most proud of creative wise I'm most proud of that don't start the revolution
[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:44.720]  without me but excitement the interest wise I like this one the best because
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:49.720]  this one is not about Jesse Ventura you know my first three books were all
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:54.400]  about me and so this is the first book I've done where I'm not the focus of
[03:02:54.400 --> 03:02:59.600]  the book the book the focus of the book is the 14 conspiracies so it's a new
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:03.800]  level of my writing now along with dick of going to something that doesn't
[03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:08.720]  necessarily me is about Jesse Ventura that it's about something else and
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:12.680]  folks you may think you know it all but you'll learn something of this book it's
[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:17.480]  a great quick read it's a thick book but it goes very quickly you get addicted
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:20.840]  to each chapter wanting more of the information buy the book read it then
[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:26.280]  give it to a family or member or somebody at work wake somebody up because the
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:30.600]  people are ready to be awakened now Jesse can you feel the awakening taking
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:36.120]  place well I yeah I really am and I can feel it in many many ways and I'll give
[03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:43.640]  you two two easy ways every time I fly to Chicago here I get recognized and all
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:47.520]  the people in Illinois come up to me and say hey we need you to be our governor
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:52.000]  because of course the last two governors they've had governor Ryan and the other
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  guy are going to jail or they you know now I'm in New York you can't believe
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:02.760]  all the New Yorkers in Manhattan begging me to move to New York and become their
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:09.000]  governor what I feel happening right now Alex is a true grassroots movement of

[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:21.320]  policy change at the Denver County courthouse where they were naked body
[03:08:21.320 --> 03:08:25.640]  scanning even children now homeland security we played a video from homeland
[03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:28.800]  security two days ago here on air if you missed it it's in the archives at
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:35.000]  prismplanet.tv where they're gonna have mobile naked body scanner trucks and you
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:39.800]  can't make this up brain scanners here's French news agency brain scan can read
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:44.440]  people's thoughts total quackery folks and they ask you are you a terrorist when
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:48.600]  you go in a football stadium you go in a rock concert these are going to be
[03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:52.200]  everywhere governor Ventura you're forced to fly a lot when you're shooting
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:56.480]  your top TV show or when you're traveling in promoting books what are you
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:00.800]  going to do when they try to force you through a naked body scanner well first
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:06.000]  of all alex I've been through one oh my gosh no wait a minute let me explain I
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:12.400]  I had my hip replaced a few years ago got the two years ago so I've got carbon
[03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:17.040]  titanium steel they did hip resurfacing they covered the joint and it with
[03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:23.280]  carbon titanium steel so every time I go through an airport governor Jesse Ventura
[03:09:23.280 --> 03:09:28.760]  gets wanded and searched because I set the beepers off well the way it happened
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:35.680]  to me was I was I was I was late for a flight out of Denver and I wanted to
[03:09:35.680 --> 03:09:40.040]  get down the plane to get home and they told me that if I went through that I
[03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:44.320]  could make the plane faster because I wouldn't have to set a beeper off to
[03:09:44.320 --> 03:09:48.680]  where they could then not have to sit there and wait to be wanded so just
[03:09:48.680 --> 03:09:53.880]  simply to speed the process up I went through one but I I think they're
[03:09:53.880 --> 03:09:58.320]  utterly absurd for the most part but I mean what are you gonna do when you
[03:09:58.320 --> 03:10:02.640]  gotta get on a plane or use a plane if it's required to do it I mean what's
[03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:08.240]  gonna happen to all of us then I don't know mandatory that if you're gonna fly
[03:10:08.240 --> 03:10:12.440]  you have to walk through one of these so it did happen to me once and you know
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:15.200]  you gotta remember though Alex a naked body scanner
[03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:19.840]  truly doesn't bother a Navy SEAL bad because we never wear underwear anyway
[03:10:19.840 --> 03:10:25.280]  and things like skivvy checks all the time so being naked ain't no big deal I
[03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:29.400]  understand that but hurting hurting our families through it going through it to
[03:10:29.400 --> 03:10:33.880]  get into a ballgame this is clearly just meant to dominate us to break our will
[03:10:33.880 --> 03:10:39.240]  to make us submit well yeah and it's all about control it's all about violating
[03:10:39.240 --> 03:10:42.800]  your rights I mean let's look at it now they've shredded the fourth amendment I
[03:10:42.800 --> 03:10:47.760]  read a book down in Mexico where every one of our emails and every one of our
[03:10:47.760 --> 03:10:51.800]  phone calls in this country can be you know go has to pass through the
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:56.400]  government well that's another subject I wanted to raise wire magazine headline
[03:10:56.400 --> 03:11:00.680]  cyber security the end of the open Internet and Cass Sunstein at the White
[03:11:00.680 --> 03:11:05.480]  House and others they're saying they want fines fees taxes on quote conspiracy
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:10.280]  theories of taxes on ideas or maybe it should be made illegal and the Pentagon
[03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:14.520]  is openly taking the Internet over oh yeah no I knew I knew that that would
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:18.760]  happen because I you know because the Internet was the one thing they didn't
[03:11:18.760 --> 03:11:25.480]  ask control over and for a while and you know and so they I knew absolutely that
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:29.120]  that they couldn't let some rogue thing out there because where do you get your
[03:11:29.120 --> 03:11:33.160]  real information now let's be honest there's a lot of BS on the Internet you
[03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:37.400]  gotta shift your way through it you don't know whether that's free speech but the
[03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:41.880]  Internet is truly the only place where you could learn anything real but as
[03:11:41.880 --> 03:11:46.040]  angry as people are and as fast as the awakenings happening every time they
[03:11:46.040 --> 03:11:49.320]  try to censor info wars dot com or prison planet dot com or your Huffington
[03:11:49.320 --> 03:11:53.720]  Post article it only makes people want to find out what the censorship is all
[03:11:53.720 --> 03:11:58.120]  about hopefully and I'll make one last appeal that you say it
[03:11:58.120 --> 03:12:03.880]  Alex Jones listeners out there email that damn Huffington Post and ask
[03:12:03.880 --> 03:12:09.400]  me did you see the articles and it isn't just Philadelphia it's all over the
[03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:13.160]  country taxpayers pay for laptops they give them to the kids at the schools and
[03:12:13.160 --> 03:12:17.280]  the principals are watching the kids in their bedrooms even at home and how do
[03:12:17.280 --> 03:12:21.680]  we learn about this the principals are going on TV bragging about it like it's
[03:12:21.680 --> 03:12:30.000]  a good thing oh yeah I saw that I you know Alex we gotta wake him up man you
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:33.680]  know people need to understand that this is supposed to be the country of
[03:12:33.680 --> 03:12:39.720]  freedom this is not East Germany this is not behind the iron curtain you know
[03:12:39.720 --> 03:12:44.760]  this is it but but we're heading that way it just seems that they sense there's
[03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:49.400]  so many countries in the world for that type of behavior does happen and it
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:53.440]  seems that we're going in that direction rather than being heading in the
[03:12:53.440 --> 03:12:59.320]  direction of freedom his book Jesse Ventura American conspiracies only out
[03:12:59.320 --> 03:13:03.160]  five days already in the top ten bestseller list to get it discounted
[03:13:03.160 --> 03:13:07.800]  with a free film nobody's offering that at info wars.com or by calling toll
[03:13:07.800 --> 03:13:17.920]  free 888-253-3139 governor continuing here with the book but I have one final
[03:13:17.920 --> 03:13:22.320]  question overall you've always questioned the system ever since you you know
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:26.840]  learned about JFK you said 30 years ago started researching it but what has it
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:30.880]  been like for you a transformation really going down the rabbit hole really
[03:13:30.880 --> 03:13:35.040]  going into the matrix really immersing yourself in what they call the
[03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:40.400]  conspiracy culture or the culture of simply asking questions well I I don't
[03:13:40.400 --> 03:13:44.240]  mind it because when I got done being governor you know you get kind of bored
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:48.080]  after that job and you gotta you know I'm young enough to where I need to focus
[03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:53.000]  on something else and now I'm focusing on this and with the thing that I like
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:57.960]  about it is the fact that it's reality you know you're not dealing with what
[03:13:57.960 --> 03:14:02.240]  Tom Clancy writes or what Vince Flynn writes where they write a great espionage
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:07.200]  book but it's all fiction and it's the product of their imagination it's fun
[03:14:07.200 --> 03:14:11.720]  to get into things where you can deal with and read about names where you can
[03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:17.400]  put that name to a face and I find that very intriguing and entertaining to me
[03:14:17.400 --> 03:14:20.600]  when I can do that that's right I mean truth they've always said it's a lot
[03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:26.080]  stranger than fiction and reality is so much more complex and real and it's just
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:30.280]  so empowering to actually be informed and be on a journey of knowledge instead
[03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:34.760]  of just watching a television with a bunch of mindless sitcoms all day exactly
[03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:40.800]  other wait a minute now I do like the young and the restless yet I know
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:44.040]  always read that about you you are certainly a character you are something
[03:14:44.040 --> 03:14:47.560]  else what do you think your dad would think highly decorated World War two
[03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:51.760]  veteran looking down from me you know heaven or from wherever and and and
[03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:56.480]  seeing what his son has done I mean what an amazing life I mean you've had one
[03:14:56.480 --> 03:15:00.120]  of the most interesting lives out there well you know I will tell you this
[03:15:00.120 --> 03:15:06.560]  Alex the major regret of my life is the fact that when I won governor both my
[03:15:06.560 --> 03:15:10.840]  mother and father weren't there to see it yeah you know and there's nothing I
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:15.160]  could do but get this my mother predicted it not that I would win
[03:15:15.160 --> 03:15:20.320]  governor but in the last weekend that one before my mom passed on and we knew
[03:15:20.320 --> 03:15:25.080]  it was going to happen many friends and that came over and all that to talk to
[03:15:25.080 --> 03:15:31.620]  her and they told me she didn't do it in front of me but she said to them you
[03:15:31.620 --> 03:15:37.880]  keep an eye on him because he's going to do something very big and this is back
[03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:44.960]  in 1995 all I had been was a suburban mayor I was doing talk radio then how
[03:15:44.960 --> 03:15:50.400]  did my mother know what was in store for me because you hadn't even thought of
[03:15:50.400 --> 03:15:54.240]  running for governor then that was the farthest thing from my mind I had been
[03:15:54.240 --> 03:15:58.720]  a mayor I was successful but I wanted to go back to the private sector again
[03:15:58.720 --> 03:16:03.520]  which is where I was at at that time but how did my mom could she say that the
[03:16:03.520 --> 03:16:08.520]  last 48 hours of her life well the time always goes by very quick with Jesse
[03:16:08.520 --> 03:16:12.480]  Ventura we've only got about four minutes left 14 chapters in the book I
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:17.320]  expose the fake loan nuts the big money plot overthrow FDR the Bush's
[03:16:17.320 --> 03:16:22.040]  grandfather the Nazi plan Bush seniors dad the Kennedy assassination the
[03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:25.800]  assassination of Malcolm X Dr. Martin Luther King assassination the
[03:16:25.800 --> 03:16:29.720]  assassination of Robert Kennedy Watergate revisited the CIA's war against
[03:16:29.720 --> 03:16:34.240]  Nixon the Jonestown massacre October surprise the first stolen election your
[03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:39.200]  government dealing drugs the stolen elections 2004 and almost 08 what really
[03:16:39.200 --> 03:16:43.200]  happened on September 11th the Wall Street conspiracy and the secret plan to
[03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:47.040]  end American democracy let's talk about 13 and 14 here and what people should
[03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:50.960]  get the book Wall Street conspiracy briefly and then the secret plan to end
[03:16:50.960 --> 03:16:55.920]  American democracy shadow government well you know they are what they are you
[03:16:55.920 --> 03:17:00.560]  know the Wall Street conspiracy to me was an is an attempt to monopolize for
[03:17:00.560 --> 03:17:05.040]  Goldman Sachs they let layman brothers fell on their face and yet we pop up
[03:17:05.040 --> 03:17:09.680]  Goldman Sachs and isn't it interesting that every treasury secretary we've
[03:17:09.680 --> 03:17:15.240]  had how many administrations dollars come out of Goldman Sachs almost everyone
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:19.760]  yeah literally in the last 30 40 years every one of them you're telling me that
[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:23.720]  they got the market cornered on smartness the guy running the grease
[03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:29.760]  collapsed 10 years ago and today is Goldman Sachs exactly you know and so in
[03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:34.120]  and as far as taking away our democracy well you see that right now
[03:17:34.120 --> 03:17:38.360]  happening I mean the shredding of our Constitution the shredding of our
[03:17:38.360 --> 03:17:44.120]  Bill of Rights the suspension of habeas corpus and I will say this those things
[03:17:44.120 --> 03:17:48.520]  are the things that have me most upset about president Obama and then of course
[03:17:48.520 --> 03:17:53.360]  the Patriot Act why haven't those things been repealed he reauthorized it
[03:17:53.360 --> 03:17:58.080]  Democrats supposedly they got both houses they got the president and yet
[03:17:58.080 --> 03:18:02.440]  they're not touching it so it shows you clearly that there is no difference
[03:18:02.440 --> 03:18:06.400]  between the Democrats and Republicans they all have the same thing in mind and
[03:18:06.400 --> 03:18:10.480]  that's the real revolution is taking the states back third parties it's
[03:18:10.480 --> 03:18:14.160]  starting to happen but Obama's created a coffee party to control the left the
[03:18:14.160 --> 03:18:17.240]  Republicans are taking over the tea party what do you think of the tea
[03:18:17.240 --> 03:18:22.960]  parties well but the tea party you know I'll say this Alex I like it when new
[03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:28.320]  parties show up because if they get I may not agree with them necessarily but
[03:18:28.320 --> 03:18:33.160]  as long as they show up that still gives us more choices than to we get beyond
[03:18:33.160 --> 03:18:38.240]  coke and Pepsi and so my only my big criticism of the tea party is that
[03:18:38.240 --> 03:18:42.600]  first of all they're not grassroots they're being highly funded and second
[03:18:42.600 --> 03:18:47.880]  of all is the fact that they're supposed to be a tea party in a
[03:18:47.880 --> 03:18:53.720]  constitutional protector against taxes and all this stuff when Bush was in
[03:18:53.720 --> 03:18:58.000]  office shredding the Fourth Amendment and suspending habeas corpus
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:02.840]  absolutely and Obama's continuing the signing statements the executive orders
[03:19:02.840 --> 03:19:08.280]  all of it showing us that the same big money interest own the entire paradigm

[03:24:07.480 --> 03:24:15.400]  edition I'll be back live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. son never mind them breaks let it all
[03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:20.000]  hang out because we got a run to make we're not shipping a bunch of beer in
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:24.800]  an 18-wheeler we're bringing liberty and freedom and the Constitution well a few
[03:24:24.800 --> 03:24:29.680]  months ago I was amazed to see video of constitutional lawyer very successful
[03:24:29.680 --> 03:24:34.960]  counselor Gary fielder going in to the county where Denver's at and saying no
[03:24:34.960 --> 03:24:37.680]  to the naked body scanner and he got the policy change because it violates
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:42.320]  child porn laws 18 and under they don't scan you people can now be patted down if
[03:24:42.320 --> 03:24:45.560]  they want because you know where the evil prisoners he couldn't even practice
[03:24:45.560 --> 03:24:49.600]  law there without doing this they were blocking his access to the courts
[03:24:49.600 --> 03:24:54.360]  violating his constitutional rights and now we've shown Homeland Security 18
[03:24:54.360 --> 03:24:57.880]  wheeler truck speaking of 18 wheelers and the globalist have got their run to
[03:24:57.880 --> 03:25:01.680]  make they said they're gonna have them at concerts outside malls at highway
[03:25:01.680 --> 03:25:05.920]  checkpoints so as we told you anything they do in the airport is a beta test
[03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:10.360]  for everywhere else so when I heard that this gentleman was coming here to Austin
[03:25:10.360 --> 03:25:14.880]  Texas I wanted to get him in studio so Gary fielder it's great to have you here
[03:25:14.880 --> 03:25:18.800]  with us Alex thank you so much what a wonderful place you have you you don't
[03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:22.280]  really realize how great of an operation is until you get here and get to walk
[03:25:22.280 --> 03:25:25.120]  around a little bit congratulations you've really done a wonderful well it's
[03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:29.160]  not that it's cozy but we just expand and we're building a TV studio but thank
[03:25:29.160 --> 03:25:32.580]  you this is a short segment I'm gonna try to shut up here and get into the
[03:25:32.580 --> 03:25:35.200]  fight against the naked body scanners I've been really not promoting it
[03:25:35.200 --> 03:25:39.080]  fifteen thousand dollars in prizes when you get a banner up on info wars and
[03:25:39.080 --> 03:25:42.280]  prison punted I asked for that we need to get the guys to do that I know they're
[03:25:42.280 --> 03:25:46.880]  busy about the contest to expose the naked body scanners but what you're
[03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:50.240]  doing is legal and you're traveling the country but you're also talking about the
[03:25:50.240 --> 03:25:53.440]  overall attack on our Bill of Rights and Constitution from the unique
[03:25:53.440 --> 03:25:58.040]  perspective as a constitutional lawyer so break down the naked body scanners
[03:25:58.040 --> 03:26:02.000]  and everything else that's happening well the naked body a scanner story
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:06.960]  started when I went down to a local county Douglas County and I and I had
[03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:11.600]  protested a couple of other times and had been just completely searched as I
[03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:16.000]  detailed on your show so there just came a point where there had to there had to
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:18.920]  be a breaking point where I wasn't going to go through the scanner and I wasn't
[03:26:18.920 --> 03:26:22.880]  going to be touched I just got a call a couple of days ago from an oathkeeper on
[03:26:22.880 --> 03:26:28.240]  the plane on the tarmac at San Francisco outraged at what he had just gone through
[03:26:28.240 --> 03:26:33.160]  he refused the scanner and just like we talked about they ran their hands up and
[03:26:33.160 --> 03:26:37.040]  down his legs they grab your genitals I grab your wife's genitals they they they
[03:26:37.040 --> 03:26:42.560]  ran his fingers through his hair and he was on the phone talking to me outrace
[03:26:42.560 --> 03:26:46.640]  that what he had to go through there was no third option of a metal detector a
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:52.200]  wand and clearly it's harassment it's there's no legitimate reason for it name
[03:26:52.200 --> 03:26:58.080]  one instance where an American got on a plane and flew it into a building name
[03:26:58.080 --> 03:27:02.800]  one instance where you know a guy went down to the commercial airline and did
[03:27:02.800 --> 03:27:08.720]  anything other than try to get on to a plane so it's an issue where people are
[03:27:08.720 --> 03:27:11.760]  just gonna have to stand up for their rights and I heard you talking to Mr.
[03:27:11.760 --> 03:27:15.880]  Ventura at first you're going to have to be searched do not go through that body
[03:27:15.880 --> 03:27:20.760]  scanner that's an absolute degradation of your rights the idea of having a
[03:27:20.760 --> 03:27:25.880]  naked picture of me stored on a hard drive is repugnant enough to actually
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:30.400]  have to go through the and a month ago they said it was gonna be voluntary now
[03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:34.400]  they're saying oh maybe it will be mandatory well there's gonna have to be
[03:27:34.400 --> 03:27:38.080]  an alternative we got to thinking about it back in Denver it's not just about
[03:27:38.080 --> 03:27:42.760]  getting on a plane one of you get on a plane and then you can't get back what
[03:27:42.760 --> 03:27:45.920]  about your family what about your business waiting for you what if you get
[03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:48.840]  stranded because you just stand up for your constitutional rights so we all
[03:27:48.840 --> 03:27:51.920]  know where this is going this is going to the federal court they're gonna have
[03:27:51.920 --> 03:27:55.520]  to decide this they're gonna have to decide this on the issue of privacy and
[03:27:55.520 --> 03:28:01.680]  so there's a lot of cases that have come out in favor of reproductive rights and
[03:28:01.680 --> 03:28:06.360]  and things like that which sort of interweave a right to privacy into our
[03:28:06.360 --> 03:28:10.760]  Constitution which some of us have objected to over time we're gonna have
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:16.960]  to use that same case law and put it over into a right to privacy connected
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:19.880]  with the right to travel and a presumption of innocence you know they
[03:28:19.880 --> 03:28:24.600]  sell it like oh we don't discriminate everyone is tracked and traced but then
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:29.040]  in reality that gets rid of any type of probable cause or due process where oh
[03:28:29.040 --> 03:28:32.480]  you have rights to have no rights right you have rights to have no rights now
[03:28:32.480 --> 03:28:36.720]  this is why I'm so excited about the issue of sovereignty because in order to
[03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:40.360]  look somebody in the eye and say no in order to say hey I'd rather not do that
[03:28:40.360 --> 03:28:44.680]  whether it be acting like a monkey on the side of the road at the direction of
[03:28:44.680 --> 03:28:49.160]  a police officer whether it be completely having your body touched or having
[03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:53.240]  your your your naked body photographed at some point you got to be able to
[03:28:53.240 --> 03:28:57.600]  square up and say no sir I'd really rather not do that and that requires the
[03:28:57.600 --> 03:29:02.240]  consciousness of a sovereign not the consciousness of a slave that says you
[03:29:02.240 --> 03:29:05.520]  know no no I don't want to do that I'm scared the consciousness of a sovereign
[03:29:05.520 --> 03:29:09.520]  that stands up and says no sir there's gonna have to be another option because
[03:29:09.520 --> 03:29:13.360]  they're always pushing the boundaries now they say suicide bombers may have
[03:29:13.360 --> 03:29:18.160]  fake breast implants we need to x-ray you and this system already gives you
[03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:21.000]  some radiation but even more we're gonna come back and talk about the event
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:24.480]  you've got coming up in Austin how folks can go to that we're gonna talk about a
[03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:28.680]  lot more and continue to talk about the Bill of Rights and Constitution and now
[03:29:28.680 --> 03:29:32.440]  they want mobile well they have them mobile 18 wheelers where they're gonna
[03:29:32.440 --> 03:29:37.960]  hurt you and your family at checkpoints through these and take your blood we're
[03:29:37.960 --> 03:29:47.480]  on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this
[03:29:47.480 --> 03:29:51.000]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:54.960]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[03:29:54.960 --> 03:29:59.240]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[03:29:59.240 --> 03:30:03.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[03:30:03.520 --> 03:30:07.920]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[03:30:07.920 --> 03:30:11.960]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[03:30:11.960 --> 03:30:16.520]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[03:30:16.520 --> 03:30:20.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[03:30:20.640 --> 03:30:24.600]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[03:30:24.600 --> 03:30:28.440]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[03:30:28.440 --> 03:30:31.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[03:30:58.240 --> 03:31:01.960]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home have tremendous
[03:31:01.960 --> 03:31:07.040]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[03:31:07.040 --> 03:31:12.400]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[03:31:12.400 --> 03:31:17.320]  the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[03:31:25.440 --> 03:31:29.400]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[03:31:29.400 --> 03:31:34.960]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[03:34:21.800 --> 03:34:29.400]  backup dot com now going back to Gary fielder Gary continuing my issue here
[03:34:29.400 --> 03:34:33.200]  is it's not just this act of submission it's you know this pointlessness they
[03:34:33.200 --> 03:34:37.560]  helped the the underwear bomber go on the plane that's now admitted but they
[03:34:37.560 --> 03:34:41.400]  bury it in footnotes in the news now they have you seen the video these big
[03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:46.000]  mobile trucks in fact well we played that what Tuesday try to try to pull that
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:49.520]  up just while he's talking show the mobile trucks with body scanners brain
[03:34:49.520 --> 03:34:54.480]  scanners here's AFP today brain scans can read people's thoughts you know as a
[03:34:54.480 --> 03:35:00.160]  lawyer it took decades to prove that the that the lot of detectors were quackery
[03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:04.480]  it was just a way to send innocent people to present this is even worse so this
[03:35:04.480 --> 03:35:08.680]  as bad as it sounds this is only the beginning these body scanners please
[03:35:08.680 --> 03:35:14.040]  continue well again it comes down to having first of all enough intestinal
[03:35:14.040 --> 03:35:18.360]  fortitude to say no but when you say no then what's going to happen it it sort
[03:35:18.360 --> 03:35:22.400]  of shifts the burden if you will and I don't want to put anybody in danger
[03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:26.840]  nobody wants to get their arm twisted up their back or arrested but when you're
[03:35:26.840 --> 03:35:30.840]  out on airport and you're just simply standing up for your right to privacy the
[03:35:30.840 --> 03:35:34.480]  next issue becomes the alternative they're going to have to give an
[03:35:34.480 --> 03:35:38.560]  alternative to children that's set in stone the British government said that
[03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:43.080]  so if you're going to run 16 and 17 year old young men and women through a
[03:35:43.080 --> 03:35:47.840]  wife and an old 46 year old like me go in that line and just have to put up with
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:52.200]  the search I'll do that twice but at some point the federal courts gonna have
[03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:55.360]  to issue the or your state court I don't think the state court will have
[03:35:55.360 --> 03:36:00.280]  jurisdiction over TSA so ultimately it's gonna have to wind up in it in a
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:02.680]  federal court and we've got a buck this or they're gonna put it in everywhere
[03:36:02.680 --> 03:36:05.920]  like the courthouse well this has to be nipped in the bud now and you had
[03:36:05.920 --> 03:36:09.720]  success well I had success in a courthouse because it was a little bit
[03:36:09.720 --> 03:36:14.400]  different because you had to go to court witnesses were subpoenaed to court
[03:36:14.400 --> 03:36:18.840]  lawyers were were on the docket to be there there's always this issue of well
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:23.320]  just don't get on the plane take a plane drive your car that kind of goes
[03:36:23.320 --> 03:36:26.720]  against the right to travel but they want to use their ability to reasonably
[03:36:26.720 --> 03:36:31.760]  regulate so it all of those different issues are gonna clash so now's the time
[03:36:31.760 --> 03:36:36.640]  to do it now's the time to get in to federal court and get this issue
[03:36:36.640 --> 03:36:41.880]  litigated now what does that mean that means waiting that means being patient
[03:36:41.880 --> 03:36:45.600]  that means picking the perfect plaintiff that means trying to get it into the
[03:36:45.600 --> 03:36:50.280]  jurisdiction that you think is gonna be most favorable not just filing some
[03:36:50.280 --> 03:36:53.960]  injunction tomorrow down at your local courthouse so this is gonna have to be a
[03:36:53.960 --> 03:36:57.400]  sophisticated fight that's what it's gonna have to be but it needs to be done
[03:36:57.400 --> 03:37:01.840]  now before they're all installed I went through Denver International Airport two
[03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:06.720]  weeks ago and they had two lines one with the scanner one without it was about
[03:37:06.720 --> 03:37:11.480]  5050 so I got to choose so they're just trying to integrate them in so that the
[03:37:11.480 --> 03:37:15.960]  next time I go down there there's gonna be two there's gonna have to be a third
[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:20.960]  line for some reasonable alternative so the real issue is what is the reasonable
[03:37:20.960 --> 03:37:25.160]  alternative I think I could convince the federal judge that having your body
[03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:29.640]  touched is just as bad as having your body photographed well there's also the
[03:37:29.640 --> 03:37:33.480]  angle separately to go after Chertoff who made the orders for these billions of
[03:37:33.480 --> 03:37:36.720]  dollars of machines when he was they had a homeland security and now makes money
[03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:40.800]  from it there's more than one way to skin a cat as well well it's not just a
[03:37:40.800 --> 03:37:47.000]  matter of inconvenience we've all been grossly inconvenience just trying to get
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:51.240]  on to a plane so we just stand there and take that for an hour and a half this
[03:37:51.240 --> 03:37:56.680]  is seriously about touching your body or taking a photograph of your naked body I
[03:37:56.680 --> 03:38:02.640]  think that's about as invasive as you can get other than it's extracting bodily
[03:38:02.640 --> 03:38:05.800]  fluid we're right at it well they do that in Texas now they take blood without
[03:38:05.800 --> 03:38:09.520]  warrants at checkpoints right first it was these fake warrants they would swear
[03:38:09.520 --> 03:38:12.640]  out for everybody now that's just legislature said yeah the no more
[03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:15.880]  Fourth Amendment right well you know people come up to me as a criminal
[03:38:15.880 --> 03:38:19.360]  lawyer and they always ask about DUI what should I do when I get pulled over
[03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:23.440]  and you know I don't give that I don't give that advice of crack the windshield
[03:38:23.440 --> 03:38:27.680]  you know slip your driver's license that I don't say that I say roll down your
[03:38:27.680 --> 03:38:33.040]  window be pleasant be nice but be short you you don't need to speak to the
[03:38:33.040 --> 03:38:36.800]  government you don't need to get out of your vehicle you need to show them your
[03:38:36.800 --> 03:38:41.680]  documentation and ask to move forward at every level you have to check that
[03:38:41.680 --> 03:38:45.360]  officer otherwise you're going to be out of that car you're going to be in front
[03:38:45.360 --> 03:38:48.760]  of headlights jumping around on one foot and spending the way to stop the DUI
[03:38:48.760 --> 03:38:51.880]  checkpoints is on the Fourth Amendment obviously but on top of that the illegal
[03:38:51.880 --> 03:38:55.960]  aliens in 800 plus cities are given a free pass that's discriminatory well
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:38:59.600]  that's a whole different issue that's really hitting Denver hard because a
[03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:04.120]  local person whose child was unfortunately killed out of Baskin
[03:39:04.120 --> 03:39:08.440]  Robbins has just sued the city and county of Denver I believe the state of
[03:39:08.440 --> 03:39:12.520]  Colorado and a couple of different agencies or for continuously giving this
[03:39:12.520 --> 03:39:17.680]  particular gentleman who was driving pass after pass after pass on habitual
[03:39:17.680 --> 03:39:21.600]  traffic offender tickets driving under revocation but they just give him a pass
[03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:27.120]  so sure enough let me guess he was an illegal yes I mean in Austin I've
[03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:30.640]  talked to the county officials right they say they're allowed to run people
[03:39:30.640 --> 03:39:34.600]  over and they're let go I mean it's God level right a cop can't be drunk
[03:39:34.600 --> 03:39:38.840]  driving and kill somebody and I mean the this is I mean literally I ought to
[03:39:38.840 --> 03:39:44.320]  change my name to like you know Juan Gonzalez and and just be God it's sent
[03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:48.600]  a shiver through the spine of every police officer and every police chief
[03:39:48.600 --> 03:39:52.160]  and every politician who now has to deal with this issue and so I'm not
[03:39:52.160 --> 03:39:56.560]  encouraging lawsuits but I am as much as we badmouth the federal court that's
[03:39:56.560 --> 03:39:59.160]  why it's down the street we have to bring force to bear on people that are
[03:39:59.160 --> 03:40:02.520]  violating our rights you're not going to find the remedy in state court you're
[03:40:02.520 --> 03:40:06.440]  gonna have to go to the federal court and file either injunctions declaratory
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:11.040]  actions lawsuits I mean if someone touches me I consider that a harm well
[03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:14.200]  Gary fielder I'm asking a lot of questions here we're running out of time
[03:40:14.200 --> 03:40:16.920]  and this is a great interview with you I want to have you back but the time we've
[03:40:16.920 --> 03:40:19.920]  got left the 20 minutes we've got left give us the website tell us about the
[03:40:19.920 --> 03:40:24.600]  event I'm told you got a new DVD out tell us about all that okay I'm working on a
[03:40:24.600 --> 03:40:28.800]  DVD that's coming out hopefully in August I'm traveling the western side of the
[03:40:28.800 --> 03:40:35.120]  country giving seminars on sovereignty part of the the problem that I see is
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:39.120]  that we carry around with us the consciousness of a slave and it's not
[03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:42.720]  our fault we were just brought up like that we've capitulated we're like a
[03:40:42.720 --> 03:40:46.880]  whore who has a pimp beating her up and we've been brainwashed that TV is just
[03:40:46.880 --> 03:40:51.440]  pounding us every day and and and commercials and all of the media that
[03:40:51.440 --> 03:40:56.480]  we see through through newspapers books so subconscious gets bombarded with a
[03:40:56.480 --> 03:41:00.560]  lot of information to think of yourself as a sovereign is one thing to know
[03:41:00.560 --> 03:41:06.320]  legally that you're a sovereign is another so what I make I outline a seven
[03:41:06.320 --> 03:41:10.960]  hour argument with a 200-page handout that absolutely outlines that your
[03:41:10.960 --> 03:41:15.120]  forefathers mr. Jones they they settled this country they spilled their blood
[03:41:15.120 --> 03:41:18.520]  they fought the Revolutionary War and they formed this nation and they were
[03:41:18.520 --> 03:41:23.120]  declared sovereigns and they were mental giants celebrated the world over we're
[03:41:23.120 --> 03:41:27.040]  gonna do with they've set up we're not gonna follow this tyranny their
[03:41:27.040 --> 03:41:31.400]  posterity is you their posterity is me so when I start talking about sovereignty
[03:41:31.400 --> 03:41:34.480]  everybody always wants to talk about whoa that makes me better or that makes
[03:41:34.480 --> 03:41:38.840]  me more immune it's not about that anymore it's the responsibility that a
[03:41:38.840 --> 03:41:42.720]  sovereign has it's the duty that a sovereign has I'm missing a volleyball
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:46.800]  game tonight I don't want to miss that volleyball game but as a sovereign it's
[03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:50.080]  my duty you've got to do what you got and it's that sense of duty I mean it's
[03:41:50.080 --> 03:41:53.440]  not like it's even work once you're possessed by the animating spirit of
[03:41:53.440 --> 03:41:57.280]  liberty as Thomas Jefferson said with a fire of liberty in your mind and then
[03:41:57.280 --> 03:42:01.360]  it spreads tell us about the event coming up in Austin okay I'm at the AT&T
[03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:08.480]  event center tomorrow check-in is at 8 30 the the seminar lasts from 9 to 4
[03:42:08.480 --> 03:42:11.880]  there's breaks in the morning and there's a break in the afternoon and
[03:42:11.880 --> 03:42:16.160]  lunch the AT&T event center is at I believe the bottom of the tower by the
[03:42:16.160 --> 03:42:20.720]  water fountain down there we've got a room set up for 65 and so it's a
[03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:24.600]  PowerPoint presentation with moving video and a handout oh you shouldn't
[03:42:24.600 --> 03:42:28.520]  come on the show you're gonna turn away 500 but people should still try to get
[03:42:28.520 --> 03:42:33.680]  in well I do charge tuition of $100 which a lot of people criticize but it does
[03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:36.720]  cost me a lot hey you had to pay to drive here you had to pay the flyer you
[03:42:36.720 --> 03:42:40.800]  know what that's an enemy conditioning operation you shouldn't sell a Jesse
[03:42:40.800 --> 03:42:44.200]  Ventura book you shouldn't produce films and have your own operation how are we
[03:42:44.200 --> 03:42:47.400]  ever gonna fund ourselves when the government uses our own tax money to
[03:42:47.400 --> 03:42:51.320]  enslave us no people need to spend more money they need to support everybody
[03:42:51.320 --> 03:42:55.440]  look that's what my show is a platform for people like you well I really
[03:42:55.440 --> 03:42:59.400]  appreciate it just to get a flavor of what it will be like there's a free
[03:42:59.400 --> 03:43:03.640]  video called gig is up it's on my website gig is up net and that kind of
[03:43:03.640 --> 03:43:06.400]  gives you an idea of where we're going with this because this starts when in
[03:43:06.400 --> 03:43:11.560]  the morning this the check-in is at 8 30 and the the seminar starts at 9 but I
[03:43:11.560 --> 03:43:17.040]  typically don't get going to about 9 10 or 9 15 so come by and I think everybody
[03:43:17.040 --> 03:43:21.560]  that's been to the seminars I've given one in Denver Omaha and LA have come
[03:43:21.560 --> 03:43:25.960]  out come out of there feeling an entirely different way they walk out of
[03:43:25.960 --> 03:43:29.120]  there with their shoulders pinned back thinking all right I'm gonna find out
[03:43:29.120 --> 03:43:32.440]  about my family that's right people think that it's our position to be slaves
[03:43:32.440 --> 03:43:36.720]  and to be tasered and beat up and and and screamed at for people to be rude to
[03:43:36.720 --> 03:43:40.960]  us that that that government's God and their paychecks go up our paychecks go
[03:43:40.960 --> 03:43:45.240]  down that's not the case okay in the 15 minutes we've got left let's launch into
[03:43:45.240 --> 03:43:49.080]  your legal arguments against the naked body scanners and and other
[03:43:49.080 --> 03:43:54.280]  unconstitutional issues and where you see this society going well the the hard
[03:43:54.280 --> 03:43:59.040]  thing to get in federal court is standing you can't just go into federal court
[03:43:59.040 --> 03:44:02.000]  and say hey your honor I want these body scanners out of the airport I want them
[03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:05.680]  out of the courthouse well you have to have harm there has to be a remedy
[03:44:05.680 --> 03:44:09.280]  because you've suffered a violation of either your constitutional rights or
[03:44:09.280 --> 03:44:16.080]  your your personal body I think having to involuntarily be subject to a search
[03:44:16.080 --> 03:44:20.920]  when I've done absolutely nothing wrong and the night circuit just ruled two
[03:44:20.920 --> 03:44:24.080]  weeks ago the police can break in your house without a warrant with no
[03:44:24.080 --> 03:44:29.080]  presumption no probable cause I mean this is insane now I'm not saying I'm
[03:44:29.080 --> 03:44:33.840]  going to be the one to do it but I'm just saying if I were to be a plaintiff
[03:44:33.840 --> 03:44:38.600]  what would be my legal status my legal status would be of a sovereign I wouldn't
[03:44:38.600 --> 03:44:44.360]  come to the court as a you know lowly citizen begging for mercy I'd walk in
[03:44:44.360 --> 03:44:49.160]  there as a sovereign and say your honor I need redress I need remedy I need to
[03:44:49.160 --> 03:44:52.520]  get on a plane every now and then for my business or it's going to be hard because
[03:44:52.520 --> 03:44:56.240]  rights aren't given they're demanded they're taken well they they've been
[03:44:56.240 --> 03:45:01.120]  bestowed upon us by our creator and they're inalienable and that's what we
[03:45:01.120 --> 03:45:06.280]  have to stand upon that's not a document fancy handwritten thing that you hang
[03:45:06.280 --> 03:45:11.240]  on the wall if you go to the statutes at large volume one page one is the
[03:45:11.240 --> 03:45:15.400]  Declaration of Independence it's as good a law as any law you're gonna find it's
[03:45:15.400 --> 03:45:20.240]  a supreme law so I'm here in law I'm here I'm a federal judge you've been
[03:45:20.240 --> 03:45:23.160]  forced to go through a naked body scanner or they've groped you because you
[03:45:23.160 --> 03:45:26.280]  wouldn't right what do you say to me if you're the judge I'm gonna say your
[03:45:26.280 --> 03:45:31.440]  honor thank you very much for hearing my case we need redress here because number
[03:45:31.440 --> 03:45:34.400]  one I have a right to travel that's an inalienable right that doesn't have to
[03:45:34.400 --> 03:45:38.240]  be listed in the Bill of Rights I have a right to travel I have a right to be
[03:45:38.240 --> 03:45:43.040]  free from unreasonable searches and seizures now whoever is on the other
[03:45:43.040 --> 03:45:45.800]  side is gonna say well this is reasonable and that's what I'm gonna say
[03:45:45.800 --> 03:45:49.440]  show me an instance I know some people take their sesnes and that very
[03:45:49.440 --> 03:45:53.120]  unfortunate event you had here in your town about a month ago I'm talking about
[03:45:53.120 --> 03:45:57.960]  a commercial airline we go to get on a plane to conduct business or to visit
[03:45:57.960 --> 03:46:03.000]  family we don't go to blow things up they have methods in place which have
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:07.800]  worked for decades and every time they haven't worked it hasn't been one of us
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:14.000]  it hasn't been a person who's born here raised here understands it's here it's
[03:46:14.000 --> 03:46:18.480]  it's always been someone that doesn't necessarily connect with this kind of
[03:46:18.480 --> 03:46:21.280]  there's always above the law like the illegals killing everybody but there's
[03:46:21.280 --> 03:46:28.280]  just this there's this effort to squeeze us down with everybody else show us to
[03:46:28.280 --> 03:46:34.520]  not show favoritism I want favoritism I'm a sovereign of this country and I want
[03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:39.000]  favoritism I've got my American passport I've got my driver's license I've I've
[03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:42.280]  submitted to a lot of the things that I don't necessarily and that's the fake
[03:46:42.280 --> 03:46:46.160]  liberalism is that like citizens are trash everybody else's God I don't
[03:46:46.160 --> 03:46:49.560]  understand government's God illegals are God I just flew out of the country to
[03:46:49.560 --> 03:46:52.760]  Italy about five months ago I was welcomed the gentleman asked me one
[03:46:52.760 --> 03:46:56.440]  question stamped my passport and said have a nice day I try to get back into
[03:46:56.440 --> 03:47:01.440]  my own country and it's a four-hour process of disrobing opening all of
[03:47:01.440 --> 03:47:05.040]  your luggage being question that's why our tourism is dying because people don't
[03:47:05.040 --> 03:47:08.680]  want to come here they know a police state and and so you always ask the
[03:47:08.680 --> 03:47:12.720]  question what's the real underlying policy is there is the underlying policy
[03:47:12.720 --> 03:47:18.280]  really to stop a citizen from committing a terrorist act on a plane no the
[03:47:18.280 --> 03:47:24.040]  real policy as you've exposed is to get us used to being treated like sheep to
[03:47:24.040 --> 03:47:29.560]  get us used to being herded into a line and forced up put our hands up and our
[03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:33.120]  head down and photograph it's a public schools I do that everywhere it's
[03:47:33.120 --> 03:47:37.400]  outrageous is what it is so there always has to be an alternative to get to
[03:47:37.400 --> 03:47:42.160]  degradation that has to be reasonable to what's wrong with the wand I
[03:47:42.160 --> 03:47:46.320]  disrobe I take my belt off I take my shoes off I take my jacket off I got
[03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:51.440]  four buckets all acts of submission and then ultimately though I still have to
[03:47:51.440 --> 03:47:55.480]  be completely patted down without problem I see him at the airport grabbing
[03:47:55.480 --> 03:47:58.640]  people's testicles well they've never done that to me but I'm gonna say get
[03:47:58.640 --> 03:48:02.920]  your hands off that I'm not gonna let him get close anymore now if I get shut
[03:48:02.920 --> 03:48:06.200]  down a plane I don't know what's gonna happen I'm gonna miss a vacation I'm
[03:48:06.200 --> 03:48:09.920]  gonna be really upset I'm gonna miss a business meeting and and have damage but
[03:48:09.920 --> 03:48:14.280]  at some point someone's gonna have to go to the federal court now this is a
[03:48:14.280 --> 03:48:18.880]  problem that I've had cuz I approach all my topics from a legal perspective as
[03:48:18.880 --> 03:48:23.000]  sovereigns we've we we've set up our state and federal governments to have
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:28.680]  shared power we need the judicial branch to start stepping up I'm not here to
[03:48:28.680 --> 03:48:35.240]  criticize judges but they need to step up they're part of this fight they're
[03:48:35.240 --> 03:48:38.800]  part of this movement if you want to know and they're getting promoted for
[03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:41.840]  being political whores the citizens need to put pressure on them in the
[03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:45.600]  elections they're pressurized to just treat everybody the same they're
[03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:50.240]  pressurized to just get everybody through I go to court every day all day
[03:48:50.240 --> 03:48:54.960]  else every day all day and I see that the pressure is to prosecute the
[03:48:54.960 --> 03:48:59.240]  pressure is to process the pressures to convict the pressures to convict and
[03:48:59.240 --> 03:49:04.160]  extract we need the judicial people to start stepping up and say hey I've got
[03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:08.600]  this black robe on for a reason and that's to protect the people not the
[03:49:08.600 --> 03:49:13.680]  government created by those people the real people who have the sovereignty in
[03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:17.600]  their blood now that includes everybody I'm not being exclusive here I'm just
[03:49:17.600 --> 03:49:22.000]  saying if you're part of this country then you hold the power in your well
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:24.760]  let's make a deal let's just say we're above the law like the illegals no no
[03:49:24.760 --> 03:49:28.000]  I mean I mean that's unconstitutional but I mean that's what we're talking
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:31.520]  about here well you know people ask me all the time when I start talking about
[03:49:31.520 --> 03:49:34.880]  sovereignty of people say well do you mean a sovereign can drive down the road
[03:49:34.880 --> 03:49:38.640]  100 miles an hour and my response is a sovereign's not gonna drive down the road
[03:49:38.640 --> 03:49:43.640]  on a massage that endangers others that endangers others of course so what I
[03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:49.400] 'm asking regular people and I use that word people particularly is to
[03:49:49.400 --> 03:49:54.600]  understand that it's not just glorified to be a king or queen it holds
[03:49:54.600 --> 03:49:58.960]  enormous duty it holds enormous responsibility and despite the fact
[03:49:58.960 --> 03:50:03.080]  that we want to go watch football and we want to raise our kids in a in a
[03:50:03.080 --> 03:50:07.160]  fashion that were this powerful sovereign we better act like it we now
[03:50:07.160 --> 03:50:14.120]  have a call to arms that may not mean guns and rifles but whatever a person
[03:50:14.120 --> 03:50:18.560]  can do to get involved in the next city council race next da's and we're not
[03:50:18.560 --> 03:50:21.760]  gonna save the world individually or with one action but it's that it's that
[03:50:21.760 --> 03:50:27.840]  spirit of action in your community teaching your children having a
[03:50:27.840 --> 03:50:32.880]  neighborhood session or meetup joining we are changed whatever it takes to just
[03:50:32.880 --> 03:50:38.040]  exercise your sovereignty and in the end it's about mass consciousness and

[03:54:13.600 --> 03:54:17.680]  They're telling you they're special. They're dressing like kings. They're
[03:54:17.680 --> 03:54:23.840]  wearing epaulets and jewels and signants of their power. But in America the power
[03:54:23.840 --> 03:54:27.760]  flows from the people. We have to relearn that. Gary we got four minutes left.
[03:54:27.760 --> 03:54:31.240]  Other key points you want to make and if folks can't make a seminar tomorrow in
[03:54:31.240 --> 03:54:35.120]  Austin, you can look on his website for other places he's having a seminar. Go
[03:54:35.120 --> 03:54:38.320]  ahead. All right. Thank you very much. It's just a couple of final thoughts.
[03:54:38.320 --> 03:54:44.160]  From my opinion it's unquestionable that after the Declaration of
[03:54:44.160 --> 03:54:48.600]  Independence the people of the states were sovereign in each state
[03:54:48.600 --> 03:54:53.880]  constitution. When we signed the Treaty of Paris with Ben Franklin, John Jay, and
[03:54:53.880 --> 03:54:59.320]  John Adams, the sovereignty of King George III was bestowed upon the states.
[03:54:59.320 --> 03:55:04.040]  And so we often think of each state being sovereign. But as the
[03:55:04.040 --> 03:55:09.840]  Constitution was drafted in a case very early on when John Jay who was who signed
[03:55:09.840 --> 03:55:13.640]  the Treaty of Paris was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He issued a
[03:55:13.640 --> 03:55:18.120]  ruling in Chisholm v. Georgia that said although the Treaty of Paris bestowed the
[03:55:18.120 --> 03:55:22.920]  sovereignty onto the quote-unquote states, the states are the people. So even our
[03:55:22.920 --> 03:55:28.360]  states don't hold the quote-unquote sovereignty. We do. Yeah and that's a
[03:55:28.360 --> 03:55:32.040]  fact. I mean we don't have a king here. We don't have a king state or federal and
[03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:35.080]  it's in our blood. So when we look at the Constitution and we look at the
[03:55:35.080 --> 03:55:41.120]  preamble it's we the people to ourselves and our posterity. So I'm not trying to
[03:55:41.120 --> 03:55:46.040]  limit sovereignty or who is in the people. But clearly however you define the
[03:55:46.040 --> 03:55:51.080]  term posterity if our relatives were on the land we don't have to worry about
[03:55:51.080 --> 03:55:56.320]  who's sovereign and who's not sovereign. We definitely are. So instead of arguing
[03:55:56.320 --> 03:56:00.640]  about you know who's better or who's worse I'm simply suggesting that if you
[03:56:00.640 --> 03:56:05.440]  know from tracing your family heritage that your family was on the land and
[03:56:05.440 --> 03:56:10.880]  they helped build this country they were bestowed by the capital direct title
[03:56:10.880 --> 03:56:17.440]  sovereignty direct title so it's not an exclusive game it's an inclusive game
[03:56:17.440 --> 03:56:21.120]  but if you were bestowed with that sovereignty then you're gonna have to
[03:56:21.120 --> 03:56:23.520]  miss some of those football games you're gonna have to miss some of those
[03:56:23.520 --> 03:56:27.880]  movies it's time it's time now everybody's getting called history is
[03:56:27.880 --> 03:56:32.160]  happening now it's minute men time it's minute women time and make no mistake
[03:56:32.160 --> 03:56:36.280]  about it even the Supreme Court cases which came up through the 18th century
[03:56:36.280 --> 03:56:42.120]  were inclusive inclusive of women now there are other issues that have to be
[03:56:42.120 --> 03:56:46.560]  resolved with regard to sovereignty but that's that's on a more technical basis
[03:56:46.560 --> 03:56:49.120]  people will learn more in the seminar we're never gonna have you back for an
[03:56:49.120 --> 03:56:53.040]  hour on the phone just on sovereignty you wanted to talk about Obama briefly
[03:56:53.040 --> 03:56:58.080]  just briefly because part of the sovereignty is knowing who you are and
[03:56:58.080 --> 03:57:03.480]  in the process of knowing who you are you read a couple of cases about what
[03:57:03.480 --> 03:57:07.720]  the term quote unquote citizen of the United States means and what the term
[03:57:07.720 --> 03:57:14.520]  natural born citizen means at the very limit a natural born citizen is one who
[03:57:14.520 --> 03:57:20.320]  has at least both parents as the United States citizens both parents could be
[03:57:20.320 --> 03:57:24.200]  naturalized both parents could be recent immigrants but a natural born
[03:57:24.200 --> 03:57:27.720]  citizen is one born on the land so let's forget about the birth certificate
[03:57:27.720 --> 03:57:32.480]  let's forget about the hawaii thing and and concede that with two parents that's
[03:57:32.480 --> 03:57:35.320]  right we shouldn't have a president whose both parents weren't born here at
[03:57:35.320 --> 03:57:39.720]  least both parents have to be naturalized or themselves natural born so
[03:57:39.720 --> 03:57:44.080]  with all due respect to mr. Obama he can't be the president of the United
[03:57:44.080 --> 03:57:48.120]  States because his father was a British citizen Gary you're a constitutional
