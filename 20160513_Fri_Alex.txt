[00:00.000 --> 00:10.080]  Ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the 13th 2016. This is a live global
[00:10.080 --> 00:15.240]  transmission on this Friday edition. We are going to absolutely cover the
[00:15.240 --> 00:20.800]  waterfront and expose the globalist program for total world domination.
[00:20.800 --> 00:24.800]  Yesterday I got into articles in The Hill and other publications dealing with
[00:24.800 --> 00:29.040]  the plan to take over the suburbs and rural areas and make them unlivable.
[00:29.040 --> 00:33.500]  Let's go to a John Bowne special report that will come back and break this and a
[00:33.500 --> 00:38.440]  lot more down. Community organizing Supreme Commander President Barack
[00:38.440 --> 00:44.120]  Obama hates America so much that even as a lame duck president he intends on
[00:44.120 --> 00:49.960]  taking one last cheap shot at the success of the American dream. Obama and
[00:49.960 --> 00:54.320]  Julian Castro Obama's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in some
[00:54.320 --> 01:00.280]  kind of ongoing likely reported bizarre social agenda 21 experiment aimed to
[01:00.280 --> 01:04.720]  punish the suburbs of America for all of the hard work that fueled their
[01:04.720 --> 01:10.160]  position in life. Ours is a nation like no other a place where great journeys can
[01:10.160 --> 01:14.960]  be made in a single generation no matter who you are or where you come from the
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.480]  path is always forward. The New York Post writes Hillary's rumored running mate
[01:20.480 --> 01:25.560]  Housing Secretary Julian Castro is cooking up a scheme to reallocate funding
[01:25.560 --> 01:30.440]  for Section 8 housing to punish suburbs for being too white and too wealthy. The
[01:30.440 --> 01:35.960]  scheme involves supersizing vouchers to help urban poor afford higher rents in
[01:35.960 --> 01:40.360]  pricey areas such as Westchester County while assigning them government real
[01:40.360 --> 01:46.440]  estate agents called mobility counselors to secure housing in the ex-urbs. Julian
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.880]  Castro who the left is seeing as their Obama 2.0 and Hillary's VP was hand
[01:51.880 --> 01:56.600]  picked by the Obama administration in 2014 from his position as mayor of San
[01:56.600 --> 02:01.280]  Antonio, Texas to oversee Obama's social experimentation on the housing of
[02:01.280 --> 02:06.120]  America. Castro was highly criticized for the sale of thousands of foreclosed
[02:06.120 --> 02:11.680]  homes to Wall Street firms at bargain basement prices using HUD's Distress
[02:11.680 --> 02:17.280]  Assets Stabilization Program. 98% of those homes were sold to Wall Street.
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.480]  Castro had been brought in to assist Obama's 2013 forced diversity HUD
[02:22.480 --> 02:27.760]  ruling where Agenda 21 would receive a tremendous steroid shot resulting in as
[02:27.760 --> 02:32.160]  Stanley Kurtz author of Spreading the Wealth How Obama's robbing the suburbs
[02:32.160 --> 02:36.480]  to pay for the city's rights. The new HUD rule is really about changing the way
[02:36.480 --> 02:40.880]  Americans live. It is part of a broader suite of initiatives designed to block
[02:40.880 --> 02:45.160]  suburban development, press Americans into hyper-dense cities and force us out
[02:45.160 --> 02:50.600]  of our cars. Government mandated ethnic and racial diversification plays a role
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.920]  in the scheme yet the broader goal is forced economic integration. The ultimate
[02:55.920 --> 03:00.160]  vision is to make all neighborhoods more or less alike turning traditional
[03:00.160 --> 03:05.440]  cities into ultra dense Manhattan while making suburbs look more like cities do
[03:05.440 --> 03:10.640]  now. In this centrally planned utopia steadily increasing numbers will live
[03:10.640 --> 03:15.360]  cheek-by-jowl and stack-impact high-rises close to public transportation
[03:15.360 --> 03:21.600]  while automobiles fall into relative disuse. The Hill reports in June 2015 the
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.600]  US Supreme Court ruled five to four that federal housing laws allows people to
[03:26.600 --> 03:31.400]  challenge zoning laws and other housing practices that have a disparate or
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.200]  harmful impact on minority groups even if there is no proof that the
[03:36.200 --> 03:40.560]  discrimination was intentional and two weeks after that Supreme Court ruling
[03:40.560 --> 03:45.000]  HUD issued a regulation intended to help poor people move into communities that
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  are rich with opportunity as HUD Secretary Castro phrased it at the time
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.880]  and now a settlement agreement with Baltimore County Maryland is making
[03:53.880 --> 03:58.480]  those fanatically utopian policies come to fruition. Due to a complaint filed
[03:58.480 --> 04:04.320]  with HUD in 2011 by the NAACP 1,000 units will now be dispersed in the most
[04:04.320 --> 04:09.520]  affluent areas of Baltimore and if that wasn't enough to fundamentally alter the
[04:09.520 --> 04:13.720]  American landscape Castro threatened to sue suburban landlords for
[04:13.720 --> 04:19.120]  discrimination if they refuse Section 8 tenants with criminal records.
[04:19.120 --> 04:24.120]  What what do you think about considering Julian Castro as vice president?
[04:24.120 --> 04:30.320]  Well I think really highly of him and I am thrilled to have his endorsement today
[04:30.320 --> 04:36.440]  both he and his brother the congressman are just among the best young leaders
[04:36.440 --> 04:41.080]  in America. Castro's sucking up the Wall Street was seen as a potential toxic
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.560]  addition to Hillary's campaign but now with this dangerous scheme to once again
[04:45.560 --> 04:49.320]  bring government leaching welfare recipients and criminals in the left
[04:49.320 --> 04:54.240]  wing perception of two white white flight quiet suburbs of America in the
[04:54.240 --> 04:58.400]  name of fighting inequality has the potential of placing the American
[04:58.400 --> 05:00.800]  dreams squarely over the toilet.
[05:00.800 --> 05:06.600]  Katelyn Jenner experienced sex change regret might detransition biographer says
[05:06.600 --> 05:11.600]  it hasn't been easy for Katelyn it's been very hard. Ian Halpern recalls one
[05:11.600 --> 05:18.480]  source telling him well you are a dude dressed like a lady. Katelyn Jenner who
[05:18.480 --> 05:23.120]  announced her transition from man to woman last year has considered detransitioning
[05:23.120 --> 05:26.720]  the author of a new book about the Kardashian family told the rap on
[05:26.720 --> 05:31.080]  Wednesday. Ian Halpern the author of Kardashian dynasty the controversial
[05:31.080 --> 05:36.200]  rise of America's royal family thanks to all you crazy leftists who want to ban

[05:40.840 --> 05:44.680]  confirmed to me Katelyn has made whispers of sex change regret you didn't

[07:03.080 --> 07:08.240]  basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the
[07:08.240 --> 07:13.400]  warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years
[07:13.400 --> 07:18.600]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had
[07:18.600 --> 07:24.080]  drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent
[07:24.080 --> 07:29.040]  weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of
[07:29.040 --> 07:33.920]  plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our
[07:33.920 --> 07:38.600]  journey towards death I personally counter this onslaught with antroplex

[07:45.080 --> 07:50.640]  basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body discover
[07:50.640 --> 07:54.760]  why antroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to take our bodies
[07:54.760 --> 08:01.000]  back in our own hands and it starts at info wars life comm with antroplex
[08:01.000 --> 08:17.200]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[08:17.200 --> 08:30.960]  GCN radio network it is Friday the 13th 2016 on the space
[08:30.960 --> 08:38.080]  13th broadcast I will be here live for the next three hours and then I will
[08:38.080 --> 08:43.520]  also do about 30 minutes into the fourth hour of overdrive because we have the
[08:43.520 --> 08:52.120]  director of 13 hours which I now had a chance to see in which I can only laud
[08:52.120 --> 09:00.800]  because it exposes the fact that Hillary and the State Department ordered a
[09:00.800 --> 09:09.640]  stand-down in Benghazi and the director said this is not a political film we
[09:09.640 --> 09:13.360]  just covered what the facts showed and that's a big deal to see something like
[09:13.360 --> 09:18.320]  that come out of Hollywood so I look forward to interviewing the director
[09:18.320 --> 09:26.000]  coming up the 30 minutes in the fourth hour we're also going to have Mark
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.600]  Meacham on from the UK from Scotland he was arrested even though he's a liberal
[09:33.600 --> 09:44.000]  socialist in his own words for putting out Hitler dog his YouTube account is
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.520]  Count Dracula where he makes joke videos about villains and things and of
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.280]  course John Cleese did a lot of Hitler's kids as well so did Charlie Chaplin and
[09:54.280 --> 09:59.840]  others this this just shows that even if someone is saying how Hitler don't they
[09:59.840 --> 10:02.520]  have the right to do it I mean if you love Hitler isn't that you're right but
[10:02.520 --> 10:09.560]  you don't like Hitler and you make a comedy video and you get arrested he's
[10:09.560 --> 10:20.080]  joining us Les Jameson who heads up the website HR 14.org highly recommended by
[10:20.080 --> 10:27.760]  Congressman Walter Jones and others Les Jameson is working hard to try to get
[10:27.760 --> 10:36.320]  the 28 pages on 9-11 release so he'll be popping in on the transmission as well
[10:36.320 --> 10:44.880]  today there is some really unintentional comedy we're gonna be going over it's
[10:44.880 --> 10:50.600]  the press releases put out today the Associated Press is reporting on it that
[10:50.600 --> 10:56.440]  Facebook is conducting an internal investigation to find out if there's
[10:56.440 --> 11:03.840]  any censorship of conservatives going on or curtailing or governing ratcheting
[11:03.840 --> 11:15.800]  back suppression blockage Zuckerberg is on record with Merkel on a stage saying
[11:15.800 --> 11:20.800]  he's blocking quote anti-immigrant criticisms in Germany of the huge
[11:20.800 --> 11:25.200]  Islamic invasion he's on record meeting with the Communist Chinese over and over
[11:25.200 --> 11:28.880]  again the last few years with their censorship heads on how to do it and we
[11:28.880 --> 11:32.320]  played the clips of him meeting with them we've we've played the clip of him
[11:32.320 --> 11:37.960]  with Merkel it's all in infowars.com they we have internal memos that Facebook
[11:37.960 --> 11:41.120]  didn't even hide where they you know talked about blocking Donald Trump I
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.600]  mean this is going on and they've had mainstream media the last few months is
[11:46.600 --> 11:49.840]  this bubbled under the surface have articles going look you own your company
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.520]  you're allowed to block views you don't like yes but you advertised it as long
[11:54.520 --> 11:59.800]  as someone isn't calling for violence or whatever or selling stolen goods or
[11:59.800 --> 12:04.560]  whatever the case may be or having pornography that you are allowed no
[12:04.560 --> 12:07.720]  matter whether you're a Muslim a Christian a Hindu an atheist a
[12:07.720 --> 12:13.440]  conservative libertarian a agnostic political person whatever you're allowed
[12:13.440 --> 12:16.800]  to have your views and you're allowed to put out memes you're allowed to post
[12:16.800 --> 12:23.160]  videos if they're your videos so they tried to sell the idea of censorship it's
[12:23.160 --> 12:26.200]  blowing up in their face and I just want to say great job to our listeners who
[12:26.200 --> 12:30.160]  were really at the heart of promoting this great job to drudge report calm and
[12:30.160 --> 12:33.800]  that drudge really making this front and center great job to the Facebook
[12:33.800 --> 12:39.880]  employees and contractors that have gone public and great job to my crew for
[12:39.880 --> 12:45.520]  persevering and and just really hammering Facebook and I've had some
[12:45.520 --> 12:49.640]  folks through Facebook reach out to us and just say you know you might want to
[12:49.640 --> 12:53.800]  just leave us alone and we'll let your stuff get spread virally and then all
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.600]  the sudden all our stuff just starts going viral everywhere and then I don't
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.560]  stop criticizing the censorship that's going on for other people and then boom
[13:03.560 --> 13:11.000]  we get turned off again I mean as if if I get left alone I'm gonna let everybody
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.880]  else get censored that's not how I operate and it wasn't like hey buddy do
[13:16.880 --> 13:19.360]  this and we'll leave you alone it was like you might want to stop what you're
[13:19.360 --> 13:22.720]  doing and if you want to keep getting spread virally and you know Facebook's
[13:22.720 --> 13:27.040]  being real nice to you and wants to work with you we've had YouTube do it you
[13:27.040 --> 13:31.360]  know where the vice president calls up and then they all these doors open and
[13:31.360 --> 13:36.360]  then I criticize Google on the doors close I mean like I'm a donkey and
[13:36.360 --> 13:40.800]  there's a stick tied on a pole out in front of my head and I'm out here plowing
[13:40.800 --> 13:46.200]  the fields I bring value to Google to YouTube to Facebook to Twitter I bring
[13:46.200 --> 13:51.080]  content and 30 million dollars of investment a year that's how much it
[13:51.080 --> 13:55.280]  costs to run info wars sounds like a lot it's not medium-sized papers cost more
[13:55.280 --> 14:00.200]  than that I do it on the cheap I go out and you know raise money other ways or
[14:00.200 --> 14:05.360]  some family property gets sold and I put it in info wars or I get a big you know
[14:05.360 --> 14:09.920]  movie deal and you know get a payday on something as a consultant I put it right
[14:09.920 --> 14:14.760]  back in and it's not bad to make money it's that my passion is opposing the new
[14:14.760 --> 14:19.800]  world order exposing baby parts being sold exposing dehumanization because I
[14:19.800 --> 14:23.800]  don't like dehumanization because I'm a human and I take it personal because I
[14:23.800 --> 14:26.440]  have empathy
[14:26.880 --> 14:31.560]  fact I can even barely do the show today but I'm gonna do it because Rob is one
[14:31.560 --> 14:37.000]  of my best friends news director plays basketball really healthy guy and he was
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.360]  out last night with some of the guys after working about seven and said man my
[14:40.360 --> 14:44.720]  whole side feels kind of weird numb I'm gonna go home this whole left side that's
[14:44.720 --> 14:50.240]  usually your brain your heart and all he has a text message from his wife this
[14:50.240 --> 14:53.680]  morning saying hey he's not gonna be in I think he left his phone up there you
[14:53.680 --> 15:00.080]  know quote it's really bad the worst ever so I've sent Buckley to his house or
[15:00.080 --> 15:03.320]  wherever to try to get a hold of him so I can give you an update but I'm really
[15:03.320 --> 15:10.240]  pissed off right now so I'm gonna try to control myself because I care about my
[15:10.240 --> 15:13.600]  friends I care about my family and I care about the general public as well so
[15:13.600 --> 15:17.880]  many people in general public my freedom of respect or I'm nice to them I try to
[15:17.880 --> 15:22.000]  build people up they think it's cuz I'm weak because see they wouldn't try to
[15:22.000 --> 15:28.200]  build me up or you up they wouldn't try to help somebody because they think
[15:28.200 --> 15:33.440]  you're the same way it's just it's bizarre and Texas has its share of
[15:33.440 --> 15:36.520]  corruption historically and problems but it's well known that you've run into
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.920]  good Texans you know handshakes as good as it gets and people are really into
[15:40.920 --> 15:45.600]  being straight and strong and honorable and building a real society and I
[15:45.600 --> 15:48.320]  always heard that growing up it was cynical about it and said all Texans
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.920]  aren't special and I'm sick all this Texas worship and you know oh great my
[15:52.920 --> 15:56.200]  ancestors were the key founders of the state from the very beginning on both
[15:56.200 --> 15:59.560]  sides of the family and I would just you know kind of get tired of hearing about
[15:59.560 --> 16:02.520]  it but once I grew up and learned about the rest of the world the rest of the
[16:02.520 --> 16:08.480]  country and rediscovered all these great Texans I grew up around I had a blind
[16:08.480 --> 16:12.320]  spot I thought everybody was like my grandparents and my great grandparents and
[16:12.320 --> 16:17.160]  and my family members and my cousins and everybody
[16:18.160 --> 16:21.320]  they're not
[16:22.040 --> 16:25.640]  and I'm not a sardonic person I'm not an arrogant person I'm not on a power
[16:25.640 --> 16:32.360]  trip it scares me to think that I'm stronger smarter tougher meaner more
[16:32.360 --> 16:37.880]  honorable than almost anybody I've ever run into or met that's a scary thing
[16:37.880 --> 16:45.960]  and what I do find honorable people like Rob do in those kind of people become
[16:45.960 --> 16:52.760]  your family and that's why I hate the globalist the things they do to innocent
[16:52.760 --> 16:58.560]  children the things they do to our women things they do to our culture the way
[16:58.560 --> 17:01.840]  they're attacking us the way they're trying to destroy our civilization I'm
[17:01.840 --> 17:06.080]  tired of it and half the time I get mad and blow up and explode on air because
[17:06.080 --> 17:09.880]  I'm frustrated with myself that I'm not doing a good enough job to attack these

[24:17.040 --> 24:19.320]  for like an hour when I got into the office this morning and learned about
[24:19.320 --> 24:23.400]  this if she's texted Darren Mcgreen saying he wouldn't be in it was he was a
[24:23.400 --> 24:26.360]  sick of she'd ever seen him and then I said well what happened well last night
[24:26.360 --> 24:30.440]  after the show they were at a restaurant having a couple beers and he said man I
[24:30.440 --> 24:34.720]  feel numb on my left side and I feel terrible I'm gonna go home and then we
[24:34.720 --> 24:37.880]  get a text it's the worst ever I'm thinking is that his heart brain maybe
[24:37.880 --> 24:43.000]  it's a pinched nerve and his wife says it seems to be really really bad flu or
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.960]  something and that but but he's okay so I don't mean to put off a false alarm
[24:48.960 --> 24:52.760]  here I was just sharing with you that I was upset with the clock ticking till
[24:52.760 --> 24:57.200]  luckily got over to his house to find out exactly what was going on but that
[24:57.200 --> 25:02.640]  did happen so now now I'm good it's the suspense of it as everybody knows with
[25:02.640 --> 25:07.160]  family or good friends especially the older you get you see so many friends
[25:07.160 --> 25:11.880]  and family die you see so many healthy people just drop dead you just see some
[25:11.880 --> 25:15.640]  people you love get an infection when they go in for surgery and the day later
[25:15.640 --> 25:20.680]  they're dead and or maybe a lot of folks haven't experienced that I've had
[25:20.680 --> 25:24.640]  friends die with their hand in my hand and watch the light go out of their eyes
[25:24.640 --> 25:31.240]  and it just there is too much death in this world but you know it's it's it's
[25:31.240 --> 25:36.160]  it's the great equalizer and it's what brings your great men and you know great
[25:36.160 --> 25:41.720]  women and common men and women all of us down to the same equalized level now
[25:41.720 --> 25:47.160]  let's get into just a smattering of the news that's coming up I really need to
[25:47.160 --> 25:53.240]  do this there's one telegraph article about where is the world where is the
[25:53.240 --> 26:02.840]  world's new billionaire luxury home hot spot and of course it's New Zealand but
[26:02.840 --> 26:06.040]  in these articles they don't tell you why they're all running there and many
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.400]  others they admit it's because of global crisis global war global meltdown
[26:11.400 --> 26:15.200]  that's what they're saying I'm not the one saying that the elites are saying it
[26:15.200 --> 26:19.640]  Pentagon reports are saying it British Ministry of Defense reports are saying
[26:19.640 --> 26:27.520]  it we're watching it very very closely and we see retail numbers across the
[26:27.520 --> 26:32.760]  world just plummeting production raw material production plummeting a lot of
[26:32.760 --> 26:38.160]  very very very very serious science we're also going to get into this big
[26:38.160 --> 26:41.640]  report when we come back in the next long segment that's up on drudge report
[26:41.640 --> 26:49.400]  dot com WTF TSA viral video that's what the guy says viral video shows
[26:49.400 --> 26:56.760]  unbelievable length of security line some people waiting up to four hours now
[26:56.760 --> 27:00.960]  you talk about being held hostage TSA funding only goes up and up and up they've
[27:00.960 --> 27:08.440]  spent tens of billions every few years on naked body scanners they've got
[27:08.440 --> 27:13.080]  checkpoints on highways and at random bus stations and train stations but the
[27:13.080 --> 27:16.960]  borders are open and we have mainstream news articles admitting that they fly
[27:16.960 --> 27:20.880]  in planes to New York every day out of Mexico and other countries and no one
[27:20.880 --> 27:26.080]  is even checked no IDs are even looked at that we probably put those articles up
[27:26.080 --> 27:31.600]  on screen but for TV viewers we're showing you this giant line and it goes
[27:31.600 --> 27:36.080]  on and on and on and on and on and then now at airports all over they're just
[27:36.080 --> 27:40.960]  losing giant amounts of luggage and then the TSA just so happened to already be
[27:40.960 --> 27:46.240]  scheduled to be testifying yesterday and there's the head of the transportation
[27:46.240 --> 27:52.200]  safety administration the nanny state and they say I saw no foxes this morning
[27:52.200 --> 27:56.360]  the director goes I told you a few months ago we need more money and we need
[27:56.360 --> 28:01.920]  more money to get these lines going well guess what magically they're now going
[28:01.920 --> 28:06.880]  to get more money that'll then be siphoned off the naked body scanners
[28:06.880 --> 28:11.400]  for people like Michael Chertoff former head of Homeland Security Congress
[28:11.400 --> 28:18.120]  approved TSA request for screeners to meet summer crush they're going to get
[28:18.120 --> 28:23.760]  an additional 34 million to hire an additional 768 new officers and pay
[28:23.760 --> 28:30.360]  overtime for 42,000 plus oh is it that great so you can all learn how to go
[28:30.360 --> 28:34.240]  through a checkpoint be checked be searched but the border patrol completes
[28:34.240 --> 28:39.560]  the smuggling process of tens of thousands a month of quote other than
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.680]  Mexicans from the Middle East China you name it ISIS is on the border coming
[28:44.680 --> 28:48.520]  across planes flying from Europe the Middle East and Mexico don't even get
[28:48.520 --> 28:54.040]  searched from Austin Texas to Los Angeles California to New York New York
[28:54.040 --> 28:59.080]  it's in the news whistleblowers go no we're ordered to not even check their
[28:59.080 --> 29:02.720]  IDs we just let them in Donald Trump goes this is outrageous the FBI says we're
[29:02.720 --> 29:06.480]  not vetting any of these people most the passports are fake we're not even
[29:06.480 --> 29:11.200]  checking some of those we need to shut this off until they start checking again
[29:11.200 --> 29:16.360]  and their answer is to say that quote he wants to ban a religion or arrest all
[29:16.360 --> 29:22.800]  the Muslims and all these lies we're gonna play some of those clips coming up
[29:22.800 --> 29:30.080]  but that shows the total fraud give us more funding or we'll make you wait four
[29:30.080 --> 29:34.160]  or five hours or we'll lose your luggage and then you watch no matter how much we
[29:34.160 --> 29:38.840]  pay more and more funding to fund their next rollout because most the funding
[29:38.840 --> 29:43.600]  this is a diversion is for highway checkpoints mobile vans x-ray vans but
[29:43.600 --> 29:47.800]  the borders open you'll have internal checkpoints that's globalism a police
[29:47.800 --> 29:54.520]  statement no more we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:54.520 --> 30:02.840]  GCN radio network the Obama administration has told every public
[30:02.840 --> 30:06.640]  school district in the country that they must allow transgender students to use
[30:06.640 --> 30:11.440]  bathrooms and locker rooms that match their chosen gender identity as opposed
[30:11.440 --> 30:14.720]  to their birth certificate and while the administration's letter doesn't have
[30:14.720 --> 30:18.560]  the force of law it does warn schools that by not abiding by the
[30:18.560 --> 30:22.760]  administration's interpretation they might face lawsuits or loss of federal
[30:22.760 --> 30:27.320]  funds regardless of where you stand on gender identity politics the fact is
[30:27.320 --> 30:31.440]  the federal government is mandating that people abide by their interpretation
[30:31.440 --> 30:35.360]  of a law that has to do with something that frankly everyone is confused by
[30:35.360 --> 30:38.960]  earlier this week the Justice Department in the state of North Carolina filed
[30:38.960 --> 30:42.800]  dueling lawsuits over the state's controversial bathroom loss the DOJ
[30:42.800 --> 30:46.640]  alleges employment discrimination on the basis of sex while North Carolina
[30:46.640 --> 30:50.680]  accuses the administration of baseless and blatant overreach either way we're
[30:50.680 --> 30:54.760]  witnessing an attempt to unilaterally rewrite long-established federal civil

[33:40.760 --> 33:46.880]  that's Chris Peranto army ranger a serve all the world then he was in a CIA
[33:46.880 --> 33:51.120]  annex security team that basically refused the stand-down order they were
[33:51.120 --> 33:56.400]  on the sat phones and over and over again were told stand down by the CIA
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.640]  orders from the State Department now this had always been known I had Colonel
[34:00.640 --> 34:04.680]  Schaefer on the week after it happened he got in a lot of trouble for telling
[34:04.680 --> 34:08.640]  the truth and coming on the show but he had the courage to do it just like he
[34:08.640 --> 34:13.680]  exposed the stand-down order to not kill bin Laden in 2001 with stratus ivy and
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.760]  able danger and we had other sources as well that broke this down they wanted
[34:18.760 --> 34:22.120]  the people they're dead they wanted to say that Al Qaeda had done and it was
[34:22.120 --> 34:27.040]  really the security team that the State Department had hired to run security
[34:27.040 --> 34:31.640]  general security in Benghazi it was ISIS it was Al Qaeda it was
[34:31.640 --> 34:35.840]  Wahhabist before they ever changed their name to ISIS and they wanted the three
[34:35.840 --> 34:39.080]  warehouses full of weapons so they went over thought they'd kill people in a
[34:39.080 --> 34:45.600]  few minutes but the stand-down went for 13 hours the firefight for eight and a
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.720]  half because a few teams of men Navy Seals and Rangers assigned to CIA
[34:50.720 --> 34:55.520]  contractors refused to stand down refused to watch fellow Americans get
[34:55.520 --> 35:00.200]  killed and so we know now what happened so don't forget one of the good things
[35:00.200 --> 35:03.360]  that Megan Kelly's done a few months ago in Fox News was have some of these
[35:03.360 --> 35:08.960]  gentlemen on and here is a club of what they had to say this is coming up in the
[35:08.960 --> 35:15.520]  fourth hour today the CIA station chief where you were at the time told you
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.840]  repeatedly according to the the movie stand down we saw that in the trailer
[35:19.840 --> 35:25.960]  used the words stand down is that how you remember it yeah I mean it was him
[35:25.960 --> 35:29.200]  it was the chief of base deputy chief and our team leader sitting on the front
[35:29.200 --> 35:34.040]  porch and when he told me to stand down it was take take said we're losing the
[35:34.040 --> 35:39.640]  initiative and we were why is it wrong why you know that you're here to
[35:39.640 --> 35:43.640]  protect the the annex they have some security personnel over at the consulate
[35:43.640 --> 35:46.600]  which our viewers should know congressional investigators have already
[35:46.600 --> 35:50.400]  found was woefully inadequate and that we were totally unprepared that state
[35:50.400 --> 35:54.600]  had totally left those guys unprepared to defend themselves but in the moment
[35:54.600 --> 35:57.600]  that station chief at the annex is saying you stand down you're here to
[35:57.600 --> 36:02.160]  protect us this facility not that one well I don't think it was just for us
[36:02.160 --> 36:07.200]  to protect yeah she's whitewashing there there's multiple security situations
[36:07.200 --> 36:10.840]  when we should have left and he never tried to change the subject I was just
[36:10.840 --> 36:15.680]  risk adverse in my opinion his last station he wanted his legacy to be what
[36:15.680 --> 36:19.480]  it was he didn't want to lose anybody I guess you got trained all right Rangers
[36:19.480 --> 36:22.800]  full clips up on info wars calm obviously but the man in the middle is
[36:22.800 --> 36:25.040]  gonna be joining us today talk about this book that was turned into the film
[36:25.040 --> 36:27.440]  we're also we're gonna get the director on I thought we were getting both of
[36:27.440 --> 36:33.880]  them together that's why I was confused earlier but it's just incredible to see
[36:33.880 --> 36:38.400]  those heroes up there because they're not just highly trained they're not just
[36:38.400 --> 36:42.240]  patriots they've not just been through so many tours all over the world before
[36:42.240 --> 36:48.840]  they became contractors with the CIA but it took moral courage to refuse the
[36:48.840 --> 36:53.080]  order to stand down over and over and over again when we now have a culture
[36:53.080 --> 36:59.040]  filled with men especially who will violate their oaths who will in a
[36:59.040 --> 37:03.000]  cowardly fashion turn their back on their fellow Americans and humans and
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.040]  follow illegal orders but Benghazi went too far and people like Colonel Shaffer
[37:09.040 --> 37:12.720]  and others are also heroes because he came on a week after it laid out what
[37:12.720 --> 37:15.360]  happened and man they called him in I'm not supposed to get into it and
[37:15.360 --> 37:19.080]  basically threatening and I'm not gonna say what they threatened him with but
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.760]  you can probably imagine he still comes on the show and you know what he made it
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.120]  through that just like Tosh Plumlee was retiring from the CIA after almost 50
[37:29.120 --> 37:34.760]  years right after Benghazi confirmed with NATO sources pending on sources that
[37:34.760 --> 37:39.320]  were there that they're shipping guns to Al Qaeda and in high-impact weapons
[37:39.320 --> 37:45.320]  tow missiles any aircraft impads you name it not just in Benghazi but directly
[37:45.320 --> 37:48.960]  to him and that he wouldn't be part of it and others wouldn't they called up so
[37:48.960 --> 37:53.840]  we're gonna indict you we're gonna kill you did disinformation operations
[37:53.840 --> 37:58.000]  against him had people calling him up saying they were with me so that you
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.760]  know that we didn't like him just all sorts of dirty tricks to cause end
[38:01.760 --> 38:05.800]  fighting didn't work and obviously we are willing to cover these issues as
[38:05.800 --> 38:12.040]  well because if we don't there's no future if we let them get away with
[38:12.040 --> 38:17.200]  stuff like this folks there's there's no limit the great danger is countering to
[38:17.200 --> 38:24.480]  these people and it's my instinct that I cannot lay down to this right frankly I
[38:24.480 --> 38:30.600]  don't have any fear it's almost like I'm a slave to the truth it's a good
[38:30.600 --> 38:35.640]  feeling though I just I do the right thing it's default and I just don't
[38:35.640 --> 38:41.120]  see how other people don't do the right things in their lives the people think
[38:41.120 --> 38:45.120]  it's cool to sell out to corruption and to betray people and you know what those
[38:45.120 --> 38:50.000]  are soft evil folks you don't really ever find anybody that's really lived and
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.760]  really been involved in anything who continues to be corrupt I see a lot of
[38:53.760 --> 38:56.720]  punks that are corrupt but they go through some real adversity they tend to
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.960]  become men that's why they want this nanny state this artificial society I've
[39:00.960 --> 39:04.680]  got an article here where three Navy SEALs in training before they were SEALs
[39:04.680 --> 39:09.320]  have recently died one in training another flipping their truck another
[39:09.320 --> 39:14.040]  suicide and they go oh should we you know cut back on the training and make it
[39:14.040 --> 39:22.440]  easier and if anything they have made it a little bit easier but not much and the
[39:22.440 --> 39:26.840]  answer is that's why you go through training like this people always die I
[39:26.840 --> 39:30.880]  mean quite frankly you go back 50 60 years ago with Marine Corps training
[39:30.880 --> 39:35.400]  there were just deaths every week at Camp Lejeune just that that's what
[39:35.400 --> 39:40.360]  happens I've talked to family I've got the Army Marines you name it and it was
[39:40.360 --> 39:45.320]  just it was expected people are gonna die you're getting ready to go into
[39:45.320 --> 39:48.200]  situations where even more people are gonna die and a whole bunch more are
[39:48.200 --> 39:54.480]  gonna die if they don't find out who's gonna crack it's that simple so that to
[39:54.480 --> 39:58.960]  bring you right up to battlefields situations over and over again and if
[39:58.960 --> 40:02.160]  you bring somebody into a battlefield situation somebody's gonna get shot
[40:02.160 --> 40:05.240]  somebody's gonna get blown up somebody's gonna fall out of the helicopter
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.400]  somebody's gonna break their neck that's what men do but not in the nanny
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.280]  state you got a band dodgeball got it now they want to band football now they
[40:15.280 --> 40:18.160]  want to restrict everything now everybody in bull riding's got to wear a you
[40:18.160 --> 40:21.520]  know a helmet
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.760]  yeah people say well let's see you bull ride I'm not bull riding though I've
[40:26.760 --> 40:35.320]  attempted it the point is that that's the sport it's macho for a reason look
[40:35.320 --> 40:40.640]  they admit GPS just being in our cars a decade or so suddenly the average human
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.800]  doesn't have any depth perception or a a situational awareness that just think
[40:44.800 --> 40:48.080]  back ten years ago you kind of knew where the sun was different directions
[40:48.080 --> 40:52.360]  hills where you were in a city you kind of just had an idea of where that next
[40:52.360 --> 40:55.160]  street would be because you had a little map in your hand or you wrote down some
[40:55.160 --> 41:01.760]  notes just like calculators are making a stupid just like now automatic you know
[41:01.760 --> 41:06.720]  systems are basically guessing the word on my iPhone when I've half written it
[41:06.720 --> 41:11.520]  forget a spellchecker it's now writing the word for me guessing what the word
[41:11.520 --> 41:17.920]  is and if I want to send a cussword which I usually send or maybe a quote or
[41:17.920 --> 41:23.160]  someone else's text that has a cussword it will change it it's a nanny state
[41:23.160 --> 41:31.040]  it's an AI can every yardstick every meter every gauge we've got every
[41:31.040 --> 41:38.040]  indices shows we're getting stupider and stupider and weaker and weaker and
[41:38.040 --> 41:42.760]  weaker you know used to I was talking to Buckley about this last night you had
[41:42.760 --> 41:46.400]  your quote dark side not an evil side but but but a primal side where you had
[41:46.400 --> 41:49.560]  to go out and get the food and maybe fight other humans that were trying to
[41:49.560 --> 41:53.240]  take your food and you could get really vicious and really mean then you went
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.960]  back to the hut or back to the cave you got the little baby with your wife and
[41:57.960 --> 42:03.520]  everybody loved each other that was the precious side that you know where you
[42:03.520 --> 42:10.360]  wanted to be by the fire with your people but now it's all a fake nanny
[42:10.360 --> 42:13.920]  state where we all act nice and act like we're liberal and act like we love
[42:13.920 --> 42:19.640]  each other and then at home we go and watch TV all day we don't cuddle with
[42:19.640 --> 42:27.720]  each other we're fake and yes there are new studies out in psychology today
[42:27.720 --> 42:31.200]  other publications that show humans now have a shorter attention span than a
[42:31.200 --> 42:38.080]  goldfish humans have shorter attention span than a goldfish thanks to smart
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.720]  phones the one in telegraph science and I'm telling you folks I talk to adults
[42:42.720 --> 42:49.000]  everywhere executives really smart people and folks call a high IQ smart
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.600]  that's only one gauge how about cultural smarts how about
[42:52.600 --> 43:01.640]  semantical IQ how about an oratory IQ what about your social abilities people
[43:01.640 --> 43:04.720]  don't have that more and more they're selfish they're stunted they're
[43:04.720 --> 43:10.040]  unconscious they're bored record numbers are bored and the brain matter is
[43:10.040 --> 43:13.880]  dying when you're excited learning new things even as you get old and lose
[43:13.880 --> 43:21.120]  overall brain mass tissue you expand new systems in the brain new neural
[43:21.120 --> 43:24.360]  pathways and actually become more intelligent they've done many autopsies
[43:24.360 --> 43:28.600]  on top composers top mathematicians and the brain might be a third smaller than
[43:28.600 --> 43:34.960]  when the person was say 20 years old shriveled tiny but that person was doing
[43:34.960 --> 43:40.360]  mathematical equations at 90 years old bouncing off the walls with a 25-year-old
[43:40.360 --> 43:46.040]  girlfriend till the day they had a heart attack and that's a famous case the
[43:46.040 --> 43:51.320]  point is when you let somebody else live for you and you just sit there and
[43:51.320 --> 43:55.880]  watch all day and you don't take action and you don't get involved just like
[43:55.880 --> 44:00.520]  muscles at your feet the mind atrophies and I know I'm telling you something you
[44:00.520 --> 44:05.680]  already know I'm telling myself something I already know I am only going
[44:05.680 --> 44:09.960]  to be involved in TV and media if it's empowering and if it is encouraging
[44:09.960 --> 44:13.680]  people to go outside into nature and to be part of the universe near my house
[44:13.680 --> 44:17.920]  there is a creek and there are thousands of fireflies now they're kind of peaking
[44:17.920 --> 44:22.880]  and I need to go out there with a time-lapse and show it people say well
[44:22.880 --> 44:25.800]  how's that news well I'm gonna discuss while I'm out there and I'm gonna do a
[44:25.800 --> 44:32.120]  voiceover about you know really experiencing the world and if you want
[44:32.120 --> 44:35.680]  to counter globalist disinformation and globalist brainwashing and globalist
[44:35.680 --> 44:40.400]  ugly media and ugly art meant to sabotage your soul that's to classify
[44:40.400 --> 44:44.840]  CIA wants to hurt you make you dumb make you confused they can rule you show you
[44:44.840 --> 44:49.080]  ugly art show you mental illness show you not just short attention span shows
[44:49.080 --> 44:53.800]  for kids but twist it where none of it makes sense and is basically mentally
[44:53.800 --> 44:58.760]  ill to turn you into a gibbering moron and I say CIA and that's a gestalt
[44:58.760 --> 45:03.280]  touchstone big agency that admittedly has been involved in it but it's far
[45:03.280 --> 45:09.160]  beyond that it's the big university think tank combines the Darpo's the the
[45:09.160 --> 45:16.480]  different Scenarian institutes the Pavlovian juggernauts the Tavistock
[45:16.480 --> 45:22.880]  institutes everything you see is their weapons forged against you and your
[45:22.880 --> 45:26.440]  family and they write white papers admitting it and the people running
[45:26.440 --> 45:32.360]  those facilities are just committed to savaging you and your family and they
[45:32.360 --> 45:36.480]  have a wicked hatred of the average person and believe that you are unfit
[45:36.480 --> 45:41.560]  profane and stunted and they're just hurrying your acceleration into oblivion
[45:41.560 --> 45:44.840]  and I've talked to some of these people off record they go listen here that
[45:44.840 --> 45:49.080]  Horde will tear you apart in a moment the mere fact that we've been public
[45:49.080 --> 45:56.360]  about it and they do nothing shows they deserve what's being done to them and I've
[45:56.360 --> 46:00.600]  countered back blah-blah you got some screwed-up kids
[46:01.760 --> 46:05.200]  and they'll say stuff like yeah two of them are screwed up one of them's good
[46:05.200 --> 46:10.080]  that's just how nature works and I say I think you're a cold-blooded bastard
[46:10.080 --> 46:14.560]  Alex you know that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger you know that so
[46:14.560 --> 46:18.640]  why do you sit there and defend these people and I say because it's not fair
[46:18.640 --> 46:22.680]  to put them in front of a TV from birth and give them formula that's two-thirds
[46:22.680 --> 46:26.880]  high fructose corn syrup so their brain is all fried and you never let them get
[46:26.880 --> 46:30.840]  off the starting line that is an attack on a species not even your eugenics
[46:30.840 --> 46:35.800]  based accelerate the species I see you decelerating the species and I say
[46:35.800 --> 46:44.360]  you're a greedy son of a you know why son of the devil and it's the standard
[46:44.360 --> 46:48.800]  speech look you're smart you see it that means you should join us try to reform
[46:48.800 --> 46:53.880]  it from within Alex there's some bad people in the elite but that's because
[46:53.880 --> 47:00.400]  good people aren't working with us yeah and that's all a cover like Emperor
[47:00.400 --> 47:04.800]  Palpatine to use a child's analogy telling Anakin Skywalker he's gonna help
[47:04.800 --> 47:08.280]  him and he loves him and he's gonna teach him something really loving and
[47:08.280 --> 47:15.720]  helpful and good but it's not good is it
[47:15.720 --> 47:24.960]  no and the establishment tells us well that's your perspective your point of
[47:24.960 --> 47:31.760]  view everything's relative isn't it they're relative to all a point
[47:33.720 --> 47:38.760]  alright and I've got just so much news here I've absolutely got to cover the
[47:38.760 --> 47:43.200]  election is it's all over the top a man busted for video threatening Trump
[47:43.200 --> 47:48.040]  family says he thought you'd make him look cool we're gonna play some of that
[47:48.040 --> 47:52.760]  video remember he said I'm gonna kill Trump I'm gonna kill his family he said
[47:52.760 --> 47:55.640]  that for the news says I said that I was quoting him that's how deceptive they
[47:55.640 --> 47:58.040]  are they'll actually run with stuff like that and clip it out of context and
[47:58.040 --> 48:03.000]  media matters and you know CNN the rest of them and see it's all about a fake
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.320]  ride of passage where you get up there and you know announce what you're gonna
[48:06.320 --> 48:09.840]  do and you're this big man everybody says yeah but see it's the real world now
[48:09.840 --> 48:13.440]  what if you were successful and we're able actually to put a bullet in Trump
[48:13.440 --> 48:19.680]  you're going to be in a prison for the rest of your life stupid begging within
[48:19.680 --> 48:26.640]  an hour of having handcuffs put on you to be let out to mommy so stop acting
[48:26.640 --> 48:32.720]  like you're a big tough killer and actually realize you've been brainwashed
[48:32.720 --> 48:36.520]  to not like Donald Trump by the establishment media and that you're a
[48:36.520 --> 48:41.360]  sucker Donald Trump meets with top globalist James Baker curtain I wrote
[48:41.360 --> 48:45.200]  yesterday reportedly it did not go well they argued quite a bit that's in the
[48:45.200 --> 48:49.240]  Hill newspaper and some other publications we're gonna be going to
[48:49.240 --> 48:55.680]  oh good news since the Senate started its investigation announced it on Monday
[48:55.680 --> 48:59.920]  magically our Facebook videos are getting five times the views five times
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.440]  the shares our articles are spreading and it looks like they've removed part of
[49:03.440 --> 49:07.080]  the algorithm or at least the newest algorithm that was totally suppressing
[49:07.080 --> 49:11.120]  us and only have us on an older algorithm that partially suppresses us
[49:11.120 --> 49:14.960]  to see Facebook advertises this is open free market of ideas they should
[49:14.960 --> 49:19.120]  actually then do that or it's false advertising isn't it and then everybody
[49:19.120 --> 49:23.000]  who's a patriot a libertarian a conservative a nationalist a populist can
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.680]  can go somewhere else and build something new and free and not censor
[49:27.680 --> 49:44.920]  anybody so that's what it comes down to there is also another article here how
[49:44.920 --> 49:50.760]  scientists are harnessing the ice-making powers of bacteria that's pretty
[49:50.760 --> 49:56.640]  wild there's another article Wendy's is replacing workers with kiosk in response
[49:56.640 --> 50:03.840]  to fight for $15 an hour yeah they're bringing in higher higher wages all over
[50:03.840 --> 50:09.560]  the world they admit to force the move to automation to phase out humans and
[50:09.560 --> 50:12.360]  they make you totally dependent on your government check so they can make you
[50:12.360 --> 50:15.360]  take all the vaccines and go to government work brigades and basically be
[50:15.360 --> 50:26.800]  uh be quote reformed and also they are moving to remove humans out of the
[50:26.800 --> 50:31.320]  military command structures so that everything's automated decisions are
[50:31.320 --> 50:36.560]  made by algorithms and computers that's why they've now moved a woman into
[50:36.560 --> 50:41.080]  command of the Air Force I think it's women it's just that they are making it
[50:41.080 --> 50:45.760]  obsolete as I've told you they would ahead of the rise of the machines
[50:45.760 --> 50:51.240]  commanded and controlled by a very small group of technocrats less than 100
[50:51.240 --> 50:55.520]  controllers so as soon as they have full AI control I predict we'll start a
[50:55.520 --> 51:00.040]  queue against each other and there will only be one master controller there's

[52:00.240 --> 52:03.520]  was 15 and a half years of age I had two large mercury fillings put into my
[52:03.520 --> 52:07.640]  teeth I got very sick that day and over time the mercury exposure damaged my
[52:07.640 --> 52:11.760]  body my sunny disposition turned to depression and low energy many years
[52:11.760 --> 52:15.400]  later I understood what had happened and in 1991 I replaced these mercury
[52:15.400 --> 52:19.720]  fillings with white composite in 1997 I learned that the homeopathic mercury
[52:19.720 --> 52:23.800]  detox I did years earlier did not remove the mercury from my body I began an
[52:23.800 --> 52:27.040]  effective means of removing mercury from my body my digestion and
[52:27.040 --> 52:31.120]  elimination returned to normal and I began to have my life back from 1999 to
[52:31.120 --> 52:36.040]  2005 I tested the level of mercury in my body and each test showed my mercury
[52:36.040 --> 52:39.800]  burden was high after five years on one-world-way I recently did another
[52:39.800 --> 52:43.480]  mercury test the results showed my body is free of mercury and virtually all

[53:59.960 --> 54:16.760]  we have a bunch of guests coming up today obviously Les Jamison who's been
[54:16.760 --> 54:22.400]  involved in 9-11 Truths for I don't know 15 years or so heads up HR 14.org
[54:22.400 --> 54:27.120]  coming up next Tuesday the head of the CIA says he may declassify parts or all
[54:27.120 --> 54:31.720]  of the 28 pages Saudi Arabia is threatening to pull 800 plus billion
[54:31.720 --> 54:36.120]  out of the US if we quote do and yes I know the rabbit hole goes deeper than
[54:36.120 --> 54:41.720]  Saudi Arabia cover up an involvement but this domino falling will knock all the
[54:41.720 --> 54:46.920]  others down I know a lot of folks are experts on 9-11 but I am the guy that
[54:46.920 --> 54:50.160]  predicted it two months before and came out day one in the morning and said it
[54:50.160 --> 54:54.880]  was an inside job and that the Saudi Arabia was running the operation with
[54:54.880 --> 54:59.640]  the West it's all come out now I was accurate because the FBI was saying
[54:59.640 --> 55:07.240]  what happened at the time they were just being ignored and demoted but and I'm
[55:07.240 --> 55:11.840]  not lionizing the FBI but it was the FBI that was actually exposing it at the
[55:11.840 --> 55:16.200]  bottom not the top so it's a complex issue my point is the feds are not our
[55:16.200 --> 55:20.400]  enemy it's just like us it's made up of people but the globalist have hijacked it
[55:20.400 --> 55:25.160]  at the top we are in occupied countries my point by the Federal Reserve that's
[55:25.160 --> 55:28.600]  the foreign banking cartels name when foreigners take over they don't call
[55:28.600 --> 55:32.560]  themselves foreigners they go where's the Federal Reserve oh there's a TPP it
[55:32.560 --> 55:36.000]  is a foreign agreement you can't see it never mind but we're gonna raise your
[55:36.000 --> 55:41.640]  taxes and Donald Trump goes this is a national sovereignty screwjob I'm not
[55:41.640 --> 55:51.320]  for it oh my gosh he's so racist he's so evil it's the end of the world so that's
[55:51.320 --> 55:58.160]  all coming up as well before I go any further we have almost five-star reviews
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.720]  I think it's like 4.5 stars for vitamin mineral fusion from empoorslife.com it
[56:03.720 --> 56:08.640]  is the best formula out there from our research with the vitamins the minerals
[56:08.640 --> 56:16.800]  from organic base from plant-derived absolutely delicious full of energy and
[56:16.800 --> 56:22.680]  I just personally love it my children love it and I had one child that was a
[56:22.680 --> 56:25.000]  few pounds overweight and not not too much but I had a little bit and I said
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.600]  look stop drinking a carton orange juice every day and then have this and she's
[56:28.600 --> 56:33.320]  lost probably five pounds last month it's amazing and it is concentrated as
[56:33.320 --> 56:37.480]  well so you'll see some other great brands and things out there that you
[56:37.480 --> 56:40.240]  know have containers twice the size it's the same amount of vitamins and
[56:40.240 --> 56:42.560]  minerals in there than a lot of the best-selling brands out there like
[56:42.560 --> 56:46.240]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine that we also promote so and for his health.com so I
[56:46.240 --> 56:50.320]  like both formulas and for his health.com Beyond Tangy Tangerine and then
[56:50.320 --> 56:53.200]  we've come out with our own plant-derived type vitamin mineral fusion
[56:53.200 --> 56:57.120]  and for his life.com but either one you get they're both excellent and it helps

[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:17.440]  all clean and nice in their suits and look at the UK half the time you
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.600]  investigate some preacher be it Catholic or Protestant they're running some
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.720]  pedophile ring and then a lot of times they're killing the kids and the BBC is
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:30.840]  involved the royal family and Jimmy Savelle he ran all these young girls
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:38.440]  charities I mean who would put their young daughters or young foster girls
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.200]  six seven eight nine ten years with Jimmy Savelle can we put them on screen
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:49.160]  for folks I mean he is the definition of the stereotypical pedophile I mean I'll
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:55.800]  be honest I see that face I want to take a warhammer to his jaw and see the whole
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:03.560]  lower mandible just rip away that is as a father I just want image war hammer
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:12.440]  look at him getting awards from the Queen all the corpses here clean that's
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:21.040]  right Franklin child prostitution ring yeah that's the stuff at Omaha, Nebraska
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.000]  I love that Wikipedia says allegations there were indictments arrest you name
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:33.320]  it it's like that line from Lord of the Rings it's in the film too but he does
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:41.640]  Google Lord of the Rings quote you look fair but feel foul but you look foul but
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:48.680]  feel fair I've noticed that in my life a lot of times the things that look foul
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:56.240]  are really the fairest but sometimes the things that look foul are the foulest
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:01.360]  like a Savelle sometimes when evil really unclokes then it's so when it
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.720]  just doesn't even care anymore and shows itself it's like whoa a lot of times
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:13.240]  it's very beautiful isn't and there's also something about twisted evil looking
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:19.760]  beautiful on the surface to the fairest heart Frodo I think a servant of the
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.840]  enemy would look fair and feel foul or there you go I think it's a bigger quote
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:31.040]  in the actual book well if he was one of the enemy he would look fair and well
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.240]  feel foul or if you see what I mean yeah the worst of the enemy do you look
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.640]  pretty fair like psychos I've run out people like American psycho folks actually
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.400]  dealt with him personally they look just like American psycho they act like it
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.040]  and boy they're evil here let's go back and read the rest of quote Aragorn says
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:51.080]  back laughing while I look foul and feel fair is that it Frodo Baggins and
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.600]  Aragorn that's a good book all right ladies and gentlemen a lot of allegories
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:01.720]  turns out old JRR token new a thing or two the Obama administration has told
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.600]  every public school district in the country that they must allow transgender
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.840]  students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their chosen gender
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:13.520]  identity as opposed to their birth certificate and while the administration's
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.200]  letter doesn't have the force of law it does warn schools that by not abiding by
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.480]  the administration's interpretation they might face lawsuits or loss of federal
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.080]  funds regardless of where you stand on gender identity politics the fact is
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.360]  the federal government is mandating that people abide by their interpretation of

[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:50.040]  into 13 hours so that's coming up and we have several other guests as well the
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:55.760]  toll-free number to get is 800-259-9231 please remember that our local
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.640]  MNF affiliates are under siege the establishment is trying to move money
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.760]  away from radio even though it still has some of the biggest audiences out there
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:09.560]  in this atomized system of media and are trying to basically leverage out
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.080]  libertarian and patriot and conservative radio it is key to support your local
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:18.120]  affiliates carrying this show it is key to support their sponsors and to become
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.440]  a sponsor if you can this is a information war you need to be all-in in
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.680]  my view and I know a lot of you are but now is the time to commit whether it's
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.200]  putting up a billboard for the local station or whether it's becoming a
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.200]  sponsor or bare minimum sending them 50 bucks or calling your sponsor and saying
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.200]  I'm buying from you because you are supporting the Alex Jones broadcast or
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:44.200]  any other programs that are telling the truth basic nationalism basic family
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:49.840]  basic Christian values and that doesn't even mean you got to be a Christian okay
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.680]  I'm just saying don't attack Christians don't attack freedom of assembly don't
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.280]  attack the Bill of Rights I don't have to agree with everybody out there just as
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.000]  long as you're not a tyrant as long as you're not a globalist who's trying to
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.160]  take all this tyranny and sell it like it's okay and by the way those of you
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.160]  that have signed on to tyranny there's a reason the globalist want physical
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.920]  oppression and they're trying to get that in place because they got stuff
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:20.080]  planned it's so over the top no amount of PR is gonna sell it and those of you
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.480]  that were on board and in this phase are gonna be sitting in the worst position
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.720]  it's not just history it's currently happening these things follow exact
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:36.040]  paradigms they follow how in criminology can top criminologists predict
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.080]  where serial killers gonna strike next with frightening accuracy now using
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.400]  their mind which is more powerful than any computer because criminals are so
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:53.360]  OCD they follow weird little rituals they do the more psychotic the more evil
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.800]  the more so and following the New World Order I mean I've got their number
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.320]  folks I've been watching them for 25 years closely longer than that I mean
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.680]  I grew up around people that were concerned about this but as a side
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:13.840]  issue and I didn't pay much attention to it till I became a young man and I was
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.640]  going to college and high school and everything I'd been warned about was
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.480]  true but I saw it from the enemy perspective pushing the agenda I was
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.040]  like wow my dad and uncle and family and all those people that come over to the
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.600]  house they were all right I'm thinking who were those people when I was a
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:38.040]  little kid like Dallas cops and FBI agents and CIA people and they'd be
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.120]  sitting around the coffee table my dad really scared and concerned about the
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:48.000]  country worried then I just think back to people before them like Barry Goldwater
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.960]  and all the folks that knew what was happening and in McCarthy was dead on
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.360]  Fox he did some things that you know we see as you know anti-liberty but when
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.680]  you're in a war with people that want to overthrow your government and your free
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:08.600]  system I mean at a certain point when do the gloves come off here they're not
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.000]  wearing gloves for us they got bare knuckles or brass knuckles punches
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.960]  right in the teeth and I want us to have the moral high ground I don't want to
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:23.560]  fight the enemy and turn into them but if you got me down in the ditch kicking
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.520]  me in the stomach I'm gonna throw sand in your eyes and I'll just be honest that
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:31.640]  I'm starting to get to that point
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:41.000]  I mean we really are captured by some really screwed up people really bad
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.200]  people and that's all I'm trying to warn people about for heaven's sakes
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.520]  everybody's to get prepared you need to get family friends focused on what's
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:56.600]  happening people need to if you haven't taken your firearms out and you got a
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.880]  little bit rusty or you don't know how to use a firearm get one go take a safety
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:04.400]  class and just have that bare minimum water filtration storeable food we've
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.040]  got the best products the lowest prices them for store.com but do your own
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:14.240]  research whatever you do get ready but that's defense used to I spent 90% of
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:19.800]  my time on offense 10% on defense now I spent about 70% of my time on offense
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:25.080]  30% on defense and I'm quite frankly not selfish but I have responsibility of my
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:31.120]  family I'm looking very soon at going 50-50 I mean it's good the point where
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:37.160]  Info Wars can't even be my priority my family has to be that's how real this
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:43.560]  is folks and it's very saddening to me it hurts because I know what's on the
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.920]  other side we're trying to block the gate it's on fire the enemy's coming over
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.720]  the top the average person's are trance stumbling around going where's the new
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.280]  world order as the Pope announces it and as societies break down everywhere and
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.560]  his borders are open and there's just burning and pillaging all over Europe
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.920]  and major highways shut down in France and Germany with just hordes of
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:08.640]  thousands robbing everyone and civil emergencies announced and the governments
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.160]  are like bring more and even faster arrest anyone that criticizes it people
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:16.640]  are like where's the depression it's like all over the news sell everything
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.800]  you've got Royal Bank of Scotland elites moving into armored resorts and I'm
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:25.160]  like we're still here in America that is above water but it's rising and I'm
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.120]  getting to the point with like what am I trying to wake zombies up for you know
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:32.720]  it's like we're just walking around sucking their thumbs or sitting on their
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.360]  thumbs and I don't take pleasure in going look at those idiots look at that
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:41.800]  moron look at that dumb out down there give me a little East Texas saying you'll
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.080]  see down there you know look at that look at that you down there
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.640]  nothing funny about it though there's no enjoyment about it it's like if some
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.840]  crazy guy at a park I was talking to a cop once this happened to indolence is
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:02.280]  on PCP and then they've already beat up five or six people they're trying to
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.320]  kill somebody you got to shoot them there's no pleasure in shooting a loon on
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:11.120]  PCP and my pleasure is not even a good feeling you stop the criminal you just
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.600]  stopped a nut they didn't know what they were doing you can't help it feel bad
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.200]  even though you just saved somebody and that's what it's like dealing with this
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.200]  public that just goes ha ha you're a conspiracy theorist I learned that word
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:29.120]  I'm real smart and you're like no you're not you just want to make me feel dumb
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.640]  make yourself feel so superior actually heard that I'm like no I don't want to
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:36.760]  feel superior to you what do you want to feel better than people I don't want to
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.280]  feel like I'm better than other people why frankly I think I'm pretty stupid but
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:43.960]  then I look at people like you and I go my god I'm I'm one of the most informed
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:50.600]  I'm I'm one of the better people oh my gosh wow is our species really that good
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.240]  and people revel in their ignorance they revel it as the evil is just
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.560]  intensifying by the day and every institution is being basically overthrown
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:11.200]  and huge corruptions being set up in its place and used to actually mad at the
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.400]  basic institutions not realizing there were globalists in them using them to
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.960]  discredit them while they prepared new institutions I got more sophisticated
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.560]  the last seven eight years so I go people hate the state or hate the system
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.800]  but you got to understand that's only one facade of the enemy behind it is what
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:33.080]  we're dealing with they'd love it if we went and had some civil war and burned
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.240]  down our local cities they love that they love it they love it when black lives
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:46.040]  matter goes and you know shoot some cop in the back of the head total idiocy but
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.720]  these are epic times that's the I'm just saying it's on I shouldn't even have to
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.600]  prove anything else okay I mean it's just in your face they've got bad will
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:57.440]  they're coming after us they want to shut off our resources and make us dependent
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.440]  not so they can re-engineer us and make us better that always turns into a
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:07.260]  nightmare because I deserve my free will so I'm not turning over to you the
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:11.560]  globalist admit oh no they just want to get control to kind of phase humans out
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:23.400]  as we know it and in an orderly cultural culling so I'll say it again
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:29.920]  what are we gonna do about this situation what are you gonna do for your
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.200]  children what are you gonna do for your family because world government's here
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.800]  and the collapse of the world system by design incrementally is here we're now
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:43.920]  in it and it gets a lot worse the deeper we go so do I even sit here and
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.720]  argue with people about global government or argue with it argue that
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.120]  it's totalitarian I mean what do I do that's a question for listeners I'd like
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:58.200]  to ask some of the articles up on info wars calm Hillary Clinton owned by
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:04.360]  despotic sheikdoms Kurt Nemo corruption quote beyond comprehension her
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.760]  foundation alone has gotten a hundred million dollars from autocratic regimes
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:13.240]  the Middle East and it goes over it I mean crazy town folks that literally keep
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:17.800]  women in dungeons and they're like something out of a you know Disney movie
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:23.800]  like villains hobbling around like demonic ravens feeding on the people's
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:31.280]  souls I mean it's just disgusting and of course it's led by the chief feminist
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.520]  so it's okay it's like Hitler you know you know should get ADL awards you know

[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.320]  to coming out next week will they come out the CIA hasn't told us yet they're
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:29.480]  doing a cliffhanger deal obviously blackmailing the shoddies to see if they
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.120]  agree we're gonna be breaking all of that down as I just mentioned but right
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:37.360]  now let's go to Richard in North Carolina says he's a Trump supporter wants
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.240]  to talk about it go ahead hello Alex is they honored to be able to talk to you
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:47.560]  I'm a first-time caller welcome and I'm also I'm also blackmail and I try to
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.600]  sit in as much as I can really quick so those are the main things I could say
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:56.000]  but I've been listening to you probably for about seven years now and I almost
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.080]  fell victim to the media span at first I thought you were like some kind of
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:08.120]  weird racist guy I actually listen to you and and paying attention and
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:13.520]  everything every single thing that you have said is 100% true and I'm saying
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:17.720]  this because I go back and I research stuff after you say your kind words I
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.280]  mean I'd say I'm probably 96 97% accurate I make mistakes here's the
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.040]  difference I mean you're right I try to tell the truth 100% of the time I get
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.320]  some things wrong sometimes I've got a guest on and I'm not allowed to say
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:32.240]  everything so I'm trying to like get it out but without saying at all and
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.200]  breaking confidence so then I'll say something later that I you know don't
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.680]  quite agree with but I'm trying to tell the truth is the difference so thank you
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:44.240]  for your kind words sir God bless you go ahead well my spidey senses have been
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.440]  going crazy because I was really quick I was born and raised in the inner city
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:53.080]  what you would call the hood I went to Sunday school my mom made us go to
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.480]  church with kids so I learned through church about the newer order it wasn't
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.200]  until I became about probably my 20s when I started hearing Reagan and the
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:07.360]  bushes both bushes talking about the newer order I go into scripture I read
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.760]  all of that everything that is happening right now is taking place today
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:14.920]  they fast forward to this election this is the election is really exposed
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.040]  everything is showing how everything is rigged if people don't see this they're
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.560]  blind I think a lot of people are just hating on Trump because he may you know
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.640]  he's wealthy so people can't see past the wealth to see that he really is our
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:32.280]  only chance to at least we're not gonna look one word government is gonna
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:36.000]  happen cuz it's scriptural is written it's gonna happen but we can fight it
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.920]  is I don't want to just get you know if I would show me doesn't the Bible say
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:44.280]  it's our job to resist it because it's about waking people up the world system
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.480]  is gonna come into place but then it's gonna fall very very quickly according
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.080]  to scripture and that's when people really wake up so we we lose the first
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:58.120]  half the game but we end up winning the game itself yes there is no rapture you
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:01.400]  know people who do make it through tribulation there will be people who
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.240]  will will make it through you have to fight though you can't just lay down and
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.560]  take it you know and I don't think that they're gonna let Trump become
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:13.200]  president because this one world government system is so strong I think
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.280]  they'll try to JFK him or I think that you know there's gonna be some kind of
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.000]  false flag or something like that and I'll say this if he is a deceiver it's
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.040]  one of the most sophisticated deceptions I've ever seen because the
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.080]  globalists are genuinely upset at him what he's doing is hurting their program
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.120]  but he could be as I'm not saying I believe this as super double crosser
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:35.000]  who's another globalist that wants to come in and get a more dominant position
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.640]  maybe at the top of the New World Order by claiming to be a nationalist now I'm
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.240]  not saying that's what's happening is they don't even want a discussion of
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:46.160]  nationalism going on or at a higher level he's probably real and they're
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.440]  letting him do this to try to destroy him later and try to basically defeat a
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:55.160]  populist movement early before the potential for it to win and succeed
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.080]  really peaks because once we're in a full-bore depression and people can't
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:04.480]  deny it Richard that's when a populist like Trump would be invincible and so
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.360]  that's why they may want to basically trigger this revolution early to make
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.920]  sure it fizzles out but let me say this we talk about moral courage with these
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.960]  Navy SEALs and Army Rangers that were in the CIA detail at Benghazi and didn't
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.960]  stand down we have one of them joining us come up an hour and a half amazing
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.320]  courage but somebody like you who has the courage to support Trump a
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.040]  nationalist a populist it takes courage if you're white to do it or Hispanic but
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:33.320]  to be you know a black man and to do it and these black folks and others you
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.320]  know who go out at these demonstrations who get targeted by the justice
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.400]  warriors and the rest of them you know those folks really get a hat tip for me
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:49.160]  so I mean I admire your courage there's way more minorities who are actually
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:53.520]  pulling for Trump than the media to spend it and you have awakened a whole
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.880]  lot of people Alex you don't you might not know it but there are there's I have
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:05.120]  millions of black friends I work with my majority of white folks but there are
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.880]  so many people that are becoming awakened and it's because of you and of
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.720]  course God God is missing the veil on a lot of this stuff oh absolutely just one
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:16.600]  little part of the wave I'm just a few drops in a big wave and Trump's just a
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.200]  few drops but all of us together are the big wave coming in to say no to world
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.160]  government no to what's happening and they may be able to suppress this wave
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:29.360]  but as the Bible shows us the beast rains for one hour one hour and you in
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:33.240]  preachers and saying biblical times that means a season a year a cycle whatever
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:39.400]  one hour he's given one hour so that the whole world is shown what a con artist
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:44.000]  the devil is and we see earlier tremors of this like Obamacare being such a
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.680]  screw job everybody's gonna find out it wasn't free and rips you off you're
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:52.040]  gonna be you're gonna be warned first we're on the March the Empire's on the

[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:57.880]  just come back in because I saw it was sold out yesterday is a female is still
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.320]  available super male is sold out so I guess female came back in so that's some
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.480]  good news and quite frankly super female works just as good on men as it does as
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.360]  women but people want a female formula so it's tweaked a little bit and has a
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.040]  couple things in it that the male doesn't have but quite frankly I think it
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:18.080]  works better than the male it's kind of goofy I take super female I know it's
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.640]  shown by this but if I forget to bring a bottle home of run out there's some
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:25.800]  females sitting around I just ban that back it does the exact same thing with
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:29.600]  wrangling so a super female vitality try it for yourself and your purchase does
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:38.760]  fund the operation info wars live comm info or store.com okay here is the John
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:44.240]  bound report with Richard Reeves that basically began the beginning of the
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:48.680]  end of the Bush candidacy to a great extent Donald Trump took it over the
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.120]  top obviously and deserves great credit for that but but let's look at this in
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:56.320]  context of the 28 pages set to come out next week.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.320]  Thanks, are you doing well?
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.320]  Good to see you.
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.320]  Governor Bush, how are we doing?
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:03.320]  Good, how are you doing?
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.080]  I was wondering would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.920]  the 9-11 Commission report would you be willing to see those released?
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.920]  Yeah, I'd like to see them. Got them?
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.920]  Well, we hopefully we can get them. Thank you.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:18.240]  Would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.240]  9-11 Commission report would you be willing to see those released?
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:23.240]  Yeah, I'd like to see them. Got them?
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.240]  Well, we hopefully we can get them.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.240]  Thank you.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:30.240]  For the few who have seen them, they're known as the 28 pages.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.240]  In those pages are names of people who allegedly help the al-Qaeda killers but
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.240]  who have never been held accountable.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:42.240]  Potential sources of foreign support for the September 11th hijackers
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.240]  classified by the Bush administration.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:49.240]  Why the 28 pages remain hidden from the public remains a mystery.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:53.240]  We know the 28 pages from Senator Graham and Senator Jones that have seen it
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:55.240]  and military we've had on that have seen it.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.240]  It says Saudi Arabia ran the attacks to blame Iraq.
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.240]  That was always the plan.
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.240]  And then our own government bare minimum stood down.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.240]  And of course it was more than that.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:07.240]  But we have the fact that it now to a great extent was an inside job.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:12.240]  I have read the 28 pages and the 28 pages have nothing to do with national security.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.240]  I wouldn't be standing here.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.240]  It's all about relationships and involvement in 9-11.
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:20.240]  I want those documents declassified.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:25.240]  I'm embarrassed to be associated with a work product that is secret.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:31.240]  I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:37.240]  who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.240]  He called it a smoking gun.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:46.240]  And he went on to say the reason for this cover-up goes right up to the White House.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.240]  This sort of shocking when you read it, as I read it, we all had our own experience.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:56.240]  I had to stop every couple pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:02.240]  my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years leading up to that.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.240]  It challenges you to rethink everything.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:10.240]  What do we know is in the 28 censored pages of the 9-11 report?
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.240]  People that have seen it said it would bring down the whole system.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:16.240]  That was the talk to multiple members of Congress who read it.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.240]  They are convinced the American people need to see it.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:23.240]  It has to do with information which is not convenient to the White House, either White House,
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.240]  the Clinton White House, or the Bush White House.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.240]  And it has to do with an ally.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.240]  But since it looked the other way and allowed a lot of support for the terrorists who conducted the attack.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:36.240]  We're here today to call for a release of those 28 pages.
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:42.240]  The survivors, civilian heroes, and families of the victims of September 11 terrorist attacks,
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.240]  some of whom are here today, deserve the full truth.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:51.240]  We cannot let page after page of blanked-out documents be obscured behind a veil,
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:57.240]  leaving these families to wonder if there is additional information surrounding these horrible acts.
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:05.240]  My son, Matthew C. Salido, was murdered September 11, 2001.
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:09.240]  On September 11th, I lost my husband, Tom Strada.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:17.240]  My husband, Victor, was the captain of United Flight 175 that struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11th at 9.03 a.m.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:22.240]  My father never got to see me compete on my horse, cheer me on at a lacrosse scheme,
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.240]  or hear me speak at my middle school graduation.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:36.240]  Don't tell me there's a security risk, and that's the reason you're not making these public.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:42.240]  Mr. President, I call you a liar.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:46.240]  He would be laughing and saying, you go get him, Terry. You go get him.
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.240]  Don't let them get away with this.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:53.240]  Don't let them hide the truth, and don't let the people that were behind it not pay.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:59.240]  Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make.
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:05.240]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.240]  Governor Bush, how are we doing?
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:08.240]  All right, good, how are you doing?
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.240]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission Report?
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.240]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.240]  Yeah, I'd like to see them, go.
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:21.240]  When I dream of my wedding day, I will carry his picture and wish he were there with me.
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:22.240]  Yeah, I'd like to see him, go.
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:28.240]  My son's dead, and I don't know all the facts.
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:30.240]  Yeah, I'd like to see him, go.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.240]  Keeping it a secret about those who facilitated it must end now.
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:37.240]  Well, Andrea may have, hopefully we can get him.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:40.240]  Thank you.
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:47.240]  Now, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to write back to your calls for folks that are patiently holding Leandra, Aaron, Kirby, Debbie, and others.
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:54.240]  But Les Jamesons, I guess I've probably known him for 14, 15 years, putting on 9-11 events, citizen journalists investigations.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:44:01.240]  He's been working since October 2015 to spearhead an effort to generate grassroots support for legislation releasing 28 pages.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:11.240]  HR14.org is the website we've had, obviously, Congressman Walter Jones, as its senator during the report, on a lot of other folks breaking that down.
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:17.240]  Sebel Edmonds have actually heard the NSA chatter, the transcripts of what really happened.
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:25.240]  Criminal elements of our government are working with Saudi Arabia and with Jihadis, and look at what's happened with Obama now, funding it all into Syria.
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:30.240]  And they think that we're ignorant about this, and some people are, and they can get away with it.
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:35.240]  But now we have to have the CIA saying he may release some of it or all of it next week.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:39.240]  What are you expecting to happen next week from all your sources and following this Les Jameson?
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:41.240]  And where do you think this is going to go?
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:45.240]  I mean, obviously, some people will say, hey, it's a lot more than that, bombs in the buildings, everything else.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.240]  Yeah, we get that.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:54.240]  But if you prove there's a cover-up and a standout on 9-11, that blows the door open for the whole investigation.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:57.240]  It's like finding a guy with one dead kid in the back of his car.
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:00.240]  Now you get a search warrant to go into the basement where there's 20 dead kids.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.240]  The point is, we've got a dead kid in the car.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:08.240]  We got this guy pulled over, and he's got a plan to do, right, Les?
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.240]  Yeah, exactly right, Alex.
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.240]  Thank you so much for having me on today.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:22.240]  I think a great illustration of the value of the 28 pages to the overall investigation of 9-11, which needs to be conducted,
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:30.240]  is a recent Rasmussen report poll that came out 15 days after the 60 minutes peak.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:38.240]  So they had 15 days to survey the thoughts and the attitudes of Americans.
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:47.240]  Well, in this report, 74% of Americans want everything to be classified about 9-11,
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:52.240]  and only a quarter feel that they've been told the total truth about 9-11.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:46:02.240]  So 75% know that we've been either lied to, misled, and deprived of all the facts and details.
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.240]  That's huge.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:08.240]  So the 28 pages have had, I think, an immense value.
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:14.240]  And I've seen this building, Alex, the pressure building, especially since December,
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:18.240]  with efforts in Congress to get more and more cosponsors.
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:26.240]  Then late March, there was an article written by Jersey Widow, Christian Breitweiser,
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:31.240]  printed in, published in the Huffington Post called Obama of Arabia.
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:41.240]  Absolutely scathing article about the fact that this government continues to suppress and protect the interests of Saudi Arabia
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:47.240]  over the concerns and the needs and the interests of the American people, and, of course, the 9-11 families.
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:53.240]  So then the 60-minute piece came out on the 10th of April.
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:47:03.240]  And since then, it has been an unbelievable display of high-profile news coverage.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:07.240]  That's pretty much wall-to-wall, just about saturation coverage.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:10.240]  And the controversy is unbelievable.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:21.240]  Where now we have John Brennan, director of the CIA, and Tom Keane, and Lee Hamilton kind of reversing their earlier positions,
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.240]  in which they favored release the 28 pages.
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:32.240]  And so we have also the Obama White House kind of trying to downplay the value of the 28 pages.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:41.240]  It is completely 180 degrees opposite from the statement of the 9-11 commission.
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:44.240]  They said they wanted the 28 pages from the congressional report release.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:46.240]  There was a cover-up going on, 6th of the 10.
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:49.240]  Well, that shows the major pressure, the threats that are being made.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.240]  But the good news is everybody's learning about stand-downs about Saudi Arabia.
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:55.240]  People are going, hey, that's the country where 15 of them came from.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.240]  Why did we attack Iraq?
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:02.240]  And really, regardless, they're losing, in the court of public opinion, whether they cover up or not.
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:08.240]  And Saudi Arabia threatening us to pull $850 billion a few weeks ago, acting so suspicious.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:15.240]  And the fact that people know that ISIS is just al-Qaeda, and the West is funding it as their Jihad army, pretty stabilization-less.
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:19.240]  I mean, this is really an exciting time to see the truth come out.
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:26.240]  And now we've gone from false flag terrorism and inside job being in unknown terms to being ubiquitous out there.
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:33.240]  I think this is evidence that citizen journalists, the whistleblowers that get the real credit in the government and other areas,
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:40.240]  and the families and activists and in countless others, and in Walter Jones, the congressman hammering in on this broadcast,
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.240]  and our audience, millions of people taking action, drudge report linking to it.
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:49.240]  It's not about credit. The point is the people are taking action, and it shows the Associated Press,
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:54.240]  as media has a 6% approval rating now, mainstream media, 6% trust rate.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:49:01.240]  I think you can stick a fork in them. They're done, whether it's this or the TPP or anything else they try to push.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.240]  This establishment has zero credibility.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:06.240]  Yes, yes, very dramatic.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:16.240]  And, well, I think also we're witnessing that within Congress, we have Walter Jones, you know, Steve Lynch,
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:25.240]  Thomas Massey, and then some new faces that have come forth supporting the effort to release the 28 pages,
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.240]  which is very dramatic.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:35.240]  For instance, Bob Sherman of Colorado, who's a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:37.240]  You know, let me add one or two more here.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:46.240]  Devin Nunes, who is a very much kind of a hawk, warmonger, if you hear his interviews on TV.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:52.240]  However, this is significant because he has come out favoring the release of the 28 pages,
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:57.240]  and Alex, he's the head of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:05.240]  And anybody who wants to, within Congress, gain access to read the 28 pages as to put in a request
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:08.240]  to that House Intelligence Committee.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:12.240]  And so there are many very, very dramatic things going on.
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:16.240]  Thomas Drake, NSA whistleblowers has come forth.
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:18.240]  Sure, we've had him on.
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:19.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:20.240]  Very exciting.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:25.240]  An attorney, constitutional attorney Bruce Fine has written a couple of excellent articles
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:28.240]  about the need for Congress to release the 28 pages.
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:35.240]  The truth is, this has given 9-Eleven Truth a giant opening to expose this whole underworld of the West
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:42.240]  working with radical Wahhabis, Saudi Arabian Captain Caveman craziness.
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:46.240]  And it's a very, very exciting time to be alive.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:48.240]  And we look to see what gets released next week.
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:52.240]  Les Jamison, thank you so much, hr14.org.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.240]  We'll be right back.

[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:28.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:59.240]  Just won't quit.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:04.240]  Paid non-attorney spokesperson, Talcom Powder Justice with Principal Office in California is responsible for the content of this ad.

[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:28.240]  Recently, Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $72 million in damages to the family of a woman who died of cancer.
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:31.240]  She said was caused by the company's Talcom Powder.
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:36.240]  The jury found that Johnson & Johnson knew that these products could cause cancer and failed to warn consumers.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:42.240]  If you or a loved one use Talcom Powder and were diagnosed with ovarian cancer, call 1-800-323-1929.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:44.240]  You may be entitled to cash compensation.

[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:48.240]  Call 1-800-323-1929.
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:53.240]  Our toll-free phone lines are open 24-7. Call 1-800-323-1929.

[01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:59.240]  1-800-323-1929.
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:04.240]  Hi, this is Ron Paul. I'm a former 22-year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:08.240]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.240]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse or a serious drought.
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:17.240]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:20.240]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:25.240]  A U.S. company named HarvestRite has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.240]  It's a home freeze dryer.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.240]  With the product, you can preserve the foods your family loves.
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:35.240]  And the best part is, the food will last 25 years and still taste great.
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:37.240]  I've tried it and it's amazing.
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:42.240]  With a home freeze dryer from HarvestRite, you can literally freeze dry anything you eat.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.240]  Even things like ice cream.
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:53.240]  To learn more, call HarvestRite today at 800-594-4635 or go to HarvestRite.com.
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:59.240]  That's 800-594-4635 or HarvestRite.com.
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:17.240]  Some of the new articles up on infowars.com.
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:23.240]  Obama threatens public schools, enact tranny bathrooms or lose funding.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.240]  Don't be fooled.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:28.240]  Politician Obama couldn't care less about individual rights.
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:32.240]  It's about creating confusion so they can talk to your elementary school students and say,
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.240]  maybe you're a man, maybe you're a woman.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:41.240]  Take your parental rights away and convince your 10-year-old son to chop his genitals off.
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:45.240]  And by the way, most of the people that end up having their genitals cut off
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:50.240]  later say they got pressured into it by a cult and that they're very upset about it.
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.240]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:54.240]  Now, if you want to do it, you like it.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:56.240]  I'm not. Whatever.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:00.240]  The point is it shouldn't be reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:03.240]  Not how to have your Johnson cut off.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:09.240]  Not reading, writing, arithmetic and how to have your genitals cut off.
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:11.240]  That's not what the schools are.
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:16.240]  The government shouldn't be talking to 7-year-olds about having two mommies or two daddies
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:19.240]  because everybody needs to be comfortable with it.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:22.240]  Another report here, Trump's wall no different than Ellis Island.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:23.240]  We're going to get to all of this.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:24.240]  There's so much to cover.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:28.240]  I've got a bunch of news I want to get to dealing with Obamacare.
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:32.240]  People are really finding out what an overall bad deal that is.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.240]  Not a bad deal for the foreign banks and insurance companies, though.
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:36.240]  They're going to do quite nicely.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:39.240]  We have the guy that did the joke Hitler dog video.
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:41.240]  They got arrested from Scotland joining us.
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:43.240]  Oh, yeah, that's coming up.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:46.240]  We have one of the heroes of Benghazi joining us.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:47.240]  Talk about the ordered stand down.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.240]  This is big.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:54.240]  But Debbie and Leigh Andra and Suzette and Kirby and Aaron, I'm going to get to all of you before the guests come on.
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:56.240]  Let's go to Leigh Andra in Oklahoma.
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:58.240]  Thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:00.240]  Yes, hello.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:09.240]  I was calling because there's been like a lot of chatter like on your show and on coast to coast about Trump wanting to choose Mary Fallon for like his running mate or whatever.
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.240]  And I think personally that's like a horrible choice.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:21.240]  She just recently, like this past week, vetoed an informed consent bill, which is bill number 3016.
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:28.240]  Like our prisons are running at 122% because we're like at max capacity.
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:33.240]  And like our budget is like $1.3 billion deficit.
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:42.240]  And I don't know, like in the school of the establishment or whatever, I would just say she's maybe not at the cool table, but she's still one of them.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:45.240]  And I was just kind of wanting to relate that to y'all.
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:47.240]  Well, doesn't everybody want to be at the cool table?
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:51.240]  Well, I will look more into the Republican governor of Oklahoma.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:57:00.240]  I think the idea is to get a smart, you know, more conservative woman as his VP to try to neutralize the gimmick that other Hillary's a woman.
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:07.240]  So it's okay that she's got $100 million from sheiks and people that, you know, turn women into total slaves in the Middle East.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:08.240]  But I do get your point.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:10.240]  We will investigate it more.
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:18.240]  Speaking of that, the Republicans in the Senate have approved a budget $200 plus billion bigger than what Obama even asked for.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:25.240]  In fact, it's 261 million bigger, but the budget is in the hundreds of billions.
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:27.240]  I'm going to get to all that coming up right now.
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:28.240]  Thank you, Leigh Andrew.
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:29.240]  We'll investigate it.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:32.240]  Debbie in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:33.240]  Welcome.
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:39.240]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to let you know that the silver bullet saved my mom's life.
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:47.240]  She was hospitalized in mid-March around the same time Meryl Haggard had gotten ill when they had seen a lot of chemtrails in the sky.
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:52.240]  She had gone to the doctor and then two days later fell seriously ill.
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:54.240]  They had to rush her to the hospital.
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:02.240]  She had a really bad lung disorder and the hospital said they didn't think she'd make it out alive.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.240]  She was literally in there for five days.
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:10.240]  By the third day, I rushed my sister up there with silver bullet because I'm not in the same state.
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:15.240]  And my sister started giving her double doses of the recommended dose.
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:24.240]  My mother is now home doing better on oxygen, but they didn't think she would leave the hospital.
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.240]  Wow.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:28.240]  You know, two and a half years ago, my uncle died.
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:30.240]  His son died, got the same stuff.
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:34.240]  It was a mystery illness killing thousands in East Texas.
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:35.240]  Stay there, ma'am.
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:36.240]  I'm going to come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:39.240]  I want to tell you our personal story with what happened.
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:42.240]  And then by the time they were already dead, we're like, we better take a little silver.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:44.240]  My dad was sick from visiting him.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:46.240]  Three rounds of antibiotics wouldn't help him.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.240]  But the clodal silver, we believe, knocked it out.
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:49.240]  Stay there.
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:50.240]  Oh, yeah.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:52.240]  First of all, I want to say, secret 12.
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.240]  That's two SuperMail brain force prostagart silver bullet.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:57.240]  I use them all.
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:58.240]  They're phenomenal.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:00.240]  They work by info.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:01.240]  Thank you, brother.
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:03.240]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:09.240]  I am a relatively short time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:11.240]  Welcome to the InfoWare.
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:16.240]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWare at the same time.
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.240]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.240]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, CascioFX, Nacinide.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:21.240]  Right.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:22.240]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:23.240]  Have they worked for you?
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:26.240]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:27.240]  What products are you taking?
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:33.240]  Everything from SuperMail to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2.
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:35.240]  Even got a little DNA force.
[01:59:35.240 --> 02:00:01.240]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:08.240]  One o'clock Central.
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:11.240]  Our guests are worldwide.
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:14.240]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:26.240]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:29.240]  That's why this song is when the hitman comes.
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:40.240]  He knows that he's been cheated because he's killing a member of his own family.
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:44.240]  Is the money really worth it to sell out humanity?
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.240]  Are you really betting on the right side?
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:51.240]  Only being honorable will fulfill you.
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:54.240]  Nothing else will.
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:58.240]  The bullet hits the bone.
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:00:59.240]  All right.
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:00.240]  I want to go back to Debbie.
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:04.240]  Look, I want to be very, very clear about this the way the law is working this country.
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:07.240]  You should consult a physician before you drink pure spring water.
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:11.240]  You should consult a physician before you inhale oxygen into your lungs.
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:14.240]  You should consult a physician before you walk in the park.
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:21.240]  You should consult a physician because they're God and the FDA's God and they decide what you can and can't do.
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:26.240]  And they're trying to say that you can't say vitamin C is essential if you don't have it, you will die.
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:28.240]  That's a fact.
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:29.240]  It's a known fact.
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:32.240]  Like, if you don't have oxygen, you'll die, but they don't want you saying that either.
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:40.240]  I could sell cans of oxygen to scuba divers and say you need this to live when you're underwater.
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:41.240]  They would say that's a medical claim.
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:42.240]  I can't say it.
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:45.240]  So I agree with them.
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:49.240]  I can't tell you that oxygen is needed or that waters needed to live on this planet.
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:52.240]  I'd be racist if I did tell you that.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:53.240]  Knowledge is racist.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.240]  I can't tell you two plus two equals four.
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:58.240]  It's whatever they say.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.240]  I can't tell you, you know, the flu vaccines are known to kill people.
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:01.240]  We'll be on the insert.
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:02.240]  It says it.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:04.240]  Actually, I will say that and I can tell you that.
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:06.240]  They like us to believe we don't have any speech.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:07.240]  We do.
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:09.240]  But I'm not going to make claims about any of the products in M4sLife.com.
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:13.240]  I mean, some of them are patented ingredients like the bio-PQQ and stuff.
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:15.240]  We can say whatever we want because it's studied.
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:16.240]  It's proven.
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:17.240]  It's fact.
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:20.240]  It's basically a pharmaceutical that's still over the counter.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:24.240]  But when it gets to like colloidal silver, antibiotics don't work on everything.
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:26.240]  Neither does silver.
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:30.240]  It depends on the pathogen, the bacteria you name it.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:34.240]  So I don't want to sit up here and say it's some panacea and make a medical claim.
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:35.240]  I'm not.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:39.240]  I know that I had a bad eye infection this week and I went, you know what?
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:40.240]  I've had this a day.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:41.240]  I'm about to go to the doctor.
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:43.240]  I'm going to put colloidal silver in it.
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:45.240]  Within hours, half the redness was gone.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:47.240]  By the nighttime, 90% was gone.
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:48.240]  The pain was gone in hours.
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:51.240]  The bacteria or whatever it was stopped eating my eye, I believe.
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:58.240]  Now, my dad got sick taking care of my uncle and others and it killed him.
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:00.240]  And my dad kept taking antibiotics.
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.240]  And I'm like, dad, and this is where we were even selling colloidal silver.
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:05.240]  It's the very same stuff we probably labeled.
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.240]  He said, I'm going to get better.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.240]  I'm going to get better.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.240]  He's still trying to go to work and stuff.
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:10.240]  And I poured.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:12.240]  And I don't say do this because this is a toxic amount.
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:14.240]  I'm just being honest with what I did.
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:15.240]  You said you took double the amount.
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:18.240]  You always are going to die hospitals telling you, I mean, whatever.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:20.240]  Desperate times take desperate measures.
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.240]  I'm not saying do that's what I did.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:25.240]  I made him drink two bottles in a week, 30 parts per million.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.240]  And it kicked it.
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:29.240]  We believe he was on his third round of antibiotics.
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:30.240]  Wasn't working.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.240]  He was in bed all the time.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:33.240]  That's how my uncle was.
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:37.240]  And by the time uncle was in the hospital, my aunt couldn't get colloidal silver in it.
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:40.240]  He was the type, you know, just, you know, was in super good shape.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.240]  Didn't take anything.
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:46.240]  So I don't think we can say that your aunt was, you know, fixed by this known antibiotic.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:49.240]  I'm just saying it's part of the arsenal.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:51.240]  More and more mainline science is trying to come out with it.
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:54.240]  Hospitals are starting to use it, but it's so inexpensive.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:57.240]  Big Pharma hates it, but ma'am, finishing your story.
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:58.240]  Debbie, I appreciate your call.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:00.240]  Finish your story.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:03.240]  Um, well, that basically was it.
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:08.240]  She's doing better, but I also give the colloidal silver to my pets when they're not well.
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:10.240]  My neighbor's pet had a UTI.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.240]  She couldn't afford a vet appointment.
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:15.240]  So I gave her a bottle and it cured her dog.
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:20.240]  Silver is extremely toxic to bacteria and it's known to knock out a lot of viruses.
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:23.240]  I mean, it's just, it's very, it's very serious stuff.
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:26.240]  And it's supposedly in low dosages, isn't bad on the body, but high dosages.
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.240]  I mean, it's toxic.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:30.240]  I mean, I'd liken it to chemotherapy really.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:31.240]  It's like bug poison.
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:32.240]  Yeah, it'll kill cells.
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:33.240]  It'll kill cancer.
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.240]  It'll hurt other stuff.
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:36.240]  But silver is a lot milder than that, obviously.
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:38.240]  But I just don't want to say it's a panacea.
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:41.240]  There are some folks that think, but I mean, hey, when other stuff isn't working,
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.240]  isn't it great?
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.240]  God gave us silver.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:44.240]  Absolutely.
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:46.240]  Well, thank you, ma'am, for that info.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:48.240]  I really appreciate that testimony.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.240]  You wanted to comment on the TSA.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:50.240]  If you can hold, that's fine.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:51.240]  But I have a guest popping in.
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.240]  I'll get you on or you can go.
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.240]  But thank God for your aunt and thank God she's better.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.240]  That's very exciting news.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:23.240]  SilverBulletInfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:31.240]  The fact is the federal government is mandating that people abide by their interpretation
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:35.240]  of a law that has to do with something that, frankly, everyone is confused by.
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:39.240]  Earlier this week, the Justice Department and the state of North Carolina filed dueling
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:42.240]  lawsuits over the state's controversial bathroom law.
[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:46.240]  The DOJ alleges employment discrimination on the basis of sex while North Carolina
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:49.240]  accuses the administration of baseless and blatant overreach.
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:54.240]  Either way, we're witnessing an attempt to unilaterally rewrite long-established federal
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:57.240]  civil rights laws in order to suit an agenda.
[02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:25.240]  Right now at infowars.com.
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:32.240]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:36.240]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:41.240]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.

[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:48.240]  skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:04.240]  But where do you get it?
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:09.240]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is
[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:10.240]  like no other.
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:15.240]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking
[02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:20.240]  water, pairing the unprecedented super filtration power of an all-new gravity block core with
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.240]  a hybrid chromatic shell.
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:30.240]  It removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants,
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:33.240]  volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:35.240]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:37.240]  Stainless fuel construction.

[02:07:54.240 --> 02:08:23.240]  Thanks for watching.
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:34.240]  If you haven't seen The Blasphemous Criminal Evil, we're going to play a short clip of
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:35.240]  it coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.240]  Our guest will be gone then.
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:40.240]  At the bottom of the hour, we'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:43.240]  Mark Meakin joins us.
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:50.240]  He's an online gamer, streamer, YouTuber, and leader of the so-called Dank Brigade.
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:55.240]  And I see hammers and sickles and stuff on his YouTube side.
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:09:00.240]  I don't know if that means he thinks Mao Zedong's cute or Lenin's cute or whatever.
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:03.240]  But he describes himself as a liberal.
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:05.240]  And that kind of comes off watching some of his videos.
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:06.240]  And they're funny.
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:07.240]  He's a talented guy.
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:13.240]  You know, John Cleese made skits making fun of Adolf Hitler of Monty Python fame.
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:18.240]  We have Charlie Chaplin famously with his short film The Dictator making fun of Hitler,
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:19.240]  dressed up as Hitler.
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:22.240]  We have Disney doing it.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:25.240]  But this guy isn't allowed to do it.
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:30.240]  The police came and arrested him.
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:33.240]  Mark Meakin, again, joins us.
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:34.240]  I believe he's in Scotland.
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:35.240]  He can tell me where he's at.
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:37.240]  But I know it was all over.
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:38.240]  It's in Scotland.
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:41.240]  That's where the cops went and arrested him, came to his house.
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:45.240]  And just the media with a straight face said, yeah, you don't make a video with your pug
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:47.240]  doing the Hitler salute.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:52.240]  I made a video three years ago when they were banning the JC Penney teapot because someone
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:53.240]  thought it looked like Hitler.
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:57.240]  It's a silver colored teapot with a black handle.
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:00.240]  It looks nothing like Hitler, but but someone could see it.
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:03.240]  Like if you see Hitler in a cloud, do you ban that?
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:10.240]  And so I pointed out that my French Bulldog captain looks like he has a Hitler mustache.
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:13.240]  Will I be arrested?
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:17.240]  If you're a TV viewer, there it is, the Hitler dog, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:21.240]  And again, captain doesn't mean it that he looks like Hitler.
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:23.240]  The question is, why did I pick him as a puppy?
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:25.240]  Maybe that shows my subconscious love for Hitler.
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:29.240]  Maybe I should be taken in interrogated like 1984 until I tell the truth.
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:33.240]  I mean, this is meant to be over the top.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:36.240]  This is meant to where they can ban any speech they want whenever they want.
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:42.240]  While our governments bring in radical jihadists, while they allow all these other disparate
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.240]  groups to come in and spew whatever, anti-semitic garbage, whatever they want.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:51.240]  And quite frankly, I say, if you're a citizen of a country, you've got free speech.
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:57.240]  You can say it as long as you don't hurt somebody.
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:02.240]  But will there be purges of people that maybe look like Hitler, or their dog looks like
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:08.240]  Hitler, or maybe people keep seeing Mary or Jesus in bagels and danishes.
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:13.240]  Probably if someone sees Hitler, maybe in vines growing on your house, will you be arrested?
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:18.240]  And by the way, I'm not joking.
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:22.240]  That's what this is with the teapot and JC Penney.
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.240]  It's reaching that level where now people say, hey, let's get Mexican food.
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:28.240]  Let's go.
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:29.240]  Don't say the word Mexican.
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:30.240]  Or let's go get Chinese.
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:31.240]  Don't say Chinese.
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:32.240]  I've seen it in Austin.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:34.240]  People shouted down.
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:36.240]  Knowledge is now criminal.
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:37.240]  Just like homosexual.
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:38.240]  They say that's a hateful word.
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:43.240]  Robin Page, the BBC, was actually arrested a decade ago, a host of one man and his dog,
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:49.240]  because he said rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Mexicans,
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:51.240]  or Muslims, or anybody else.
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:56.240]  He listed a whole group of people.
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:00.240]  And ladies and gentlemen, because he said homosexual, he was arrested, heterosexual,
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:01.240]  homosexual.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:03.240]  Even if something's hurtful, you should be able to say it.
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:04.240]  But Facebook says no.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:09.240]  So that's where all this is going to shut down free speech, not to stop radicals or whatever,
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:10.240]  or extremists.
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:12.240]  We're going to go to our guest for a moment.
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:17.240]  But first, here's Paul Watson commenting on the viral video from Mark Meakin.
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:21.240]  We'll also give you his YouTube channel and more if you want to see the thought crimes
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:22.240]  for yourself.
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:25.240]  But since then, tens of millions of years, hundreds of articles.
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:29.240]  And I was reading, he said he was sorry.
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:31.240]  I want to hear still if he thinks he's bad.
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:32.240]  I don't think he's bad.
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:34.240]  I think Mark's a funny guy.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:37.240]  He may have bad taste in politics, but hey, that's just right.
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:40.240]  We're going to talk to him in a moment, but here's Paul Watson breaking it down.
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:44.240]  A 28-year-old Mark as Meakin was arrested for hate crimes after posting this joke video
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:48.240]  of his girlfriend's dog reacting to Nazi slogans.
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:54.240]  My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is.
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:59.240]  And so I thought I would turn them into the least cute thing that I could think of,
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.240]  which is a Nazi.
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:03.240]  Buddha.
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:05.240]  Do I gas the juice?
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:09.240]  Gas the juice?
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:12.240]  Juice.
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:14.240]  See Kyle?
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:16.240]  Juice.
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:18.240]  Juice.
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:51.240]  Meakin joins us.
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:55.240]  Mark, I tell you, I don't know if that can be associating with somebody like you.
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:58.240]  I mean, you got a guy fox mask behind you too.
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:02.240]  If you kind of cut off the handlebar moustache along with the middle, that'd be Hitler as well.
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:05.240]  Do you want to, I mean, are you really sad for what you did?
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:07.240]  Are you really sorry?
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:12.240]  I feel in the long run I didn't do anything wrong.
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:14.240]  It was clearly satire.
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:15.240]  It was clearly a joke.
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.240]  I wasn't setting out to cause any harm or offense to any people.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:20.240]  If anything, I was wanting people to laugh.
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:23.240]  And just obviously it was taken the wrong way.
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:25.240]  That was the whole really.
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:28.240]  Maybe you are a bad person.
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:30.240]  Maybe John Cleese should be arrested.
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:34.240]  Have you seen him do his Hitler spuse that I think are probably you could say more distasteful than yours?
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:39.240]  Yeah, I've seen the joke where he actually, you know, done the whole moustache thing
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:42.240]  and he even just stepped out the room and things like that as well.
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:44.240]  I've seen all the jokes like that.
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:48.240]  I've seen various jokes in relation to, you know, Nazis, Jews and things like that as well.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:50.240]  What is the matter if England and the UK fought Hitler?
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:53.240]  Now you've got to take on Hitler's mantle.
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:56.240]  Do you want to apologize for Hitler right now?
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:59.240]  It's not my duty to apologize for Hitler.
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:01.240]  It wasn't my fault or anything like that.
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:04.240]  Do you want to apologize for Jar Jar Binks?
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:07.240]  No, I don't need to apologize for that.
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:09.240]  You are wearing a Star Wars shirt.
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:13.240]  Yeah, I'm not a Jar Jar Binks fan myself, no.
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:17.240]  That's because you're racist against Caribbean lizards?
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:21.240]  No, I'm not racist against Caribbean lizards, I don't know.
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:24.240]  Well, all right, now we're starting to watch you a little closer.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:26.240]  Actually, we may be honest, I'm in here.
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:29.240]  Getting serious, describe what the police did, what ended up happening.
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:31.240]  I mean, did they have straight faces?
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:35.240]  I mean, how could they watch your pug horrified by Hitler?
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:38.240]  I mean, that's a cute pug, by the way.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:41.240]  I mean, what's the issue here?
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:43.240]  Well, they came to my house.
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:45.240]  As soon as they arrived, they said,
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:47.240]  I'm sure you know why we're here.
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:50.240]  They explained why they were here and everything, and I let them in.
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:53.240]  They explained the situation that it's been classed as a hate crime,
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:56.240]  and then they just basically said, well, we're here to arrest you.
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:58.240]  They let me get changed and stuff like that,
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:01.240]  but while I was getting changed, they were going around my house,
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.240]  they were taking photos of everything in my house,
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:06.240]  and stuff like that as well.
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:09.240]  They were taking photos of the wall behind me and everything like that as well.
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:11.240]  So, they were just real justice warriors themselves.
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:13.240]  They thought they had like a thought criminal on theirs.
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:15.240]  I mean, how were they behaving? Were they taking this serious?
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:17.240]  They were taking it serious, yeah.
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:20.240]  They basically, some of the things that they were saying to me as well
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:26.240]  was one of the officers, I felt that the video could actually promote hatred towards Jews.
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:28.240]  They thought it actually promoted Nazi culture,
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:31.240]  and they feel it could actually inspire people to hate Jews
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:35.240]  instead of just see it as a piece of satire, which is what it was.
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:37.240]  Have you heard, it's actually in mainstream news,
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:40.240]  that they're now hiring former Stasi commanders in Germany
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:42.240]  to list people criticizing open borders,
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:45.240]  and the German police are arresting them?
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:47.240]  I mean, this is starting to get scary.
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:51.240]  Yeah. Yeah, it's just that, it just sort of feels that,
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:54.240]  I understand that there's certain things that we actually have to arrest people for,
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:57.240]  and certain things that should be regarded as crimes.
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:00.240]  I don't think hurting someone's feelings is a crime.
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:02.240]  It's not a crime in any sense.
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:05.240]  No, it's never been under common law and Magna Carta or anything else in the West,
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:07.240]  but in Saudi Arabia it is.
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:09.240]  If a woman goes out without a hood on her head,
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:11.240]  they can kill her because that hurts her husband's feelings,
[02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:13.240]  and the left seems to ally with those folks.
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:15.240]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:17.240]  Where are you now? Are you still charged?
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:19.240]  Are they still proud of themselves?
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:21.240]  Are they going to arrest John Cleese?
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:23.240]  I mean, is there a arrest warrant out for him?
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:27.240]  No, as far as I know, the police haven't spoken to me since then.
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:29.240]  I was arrested, I was kept in jail overnight.
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:33.240]  I was kept in jail for court for the next day.
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:35.240]  Just before I was due to go to court,
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:37.240]  I was granted what's called Procurator Fiscal Liberation,
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:40.240]  which means the Procurator Fiscal decided to release me.
[02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:42.240]  This can either be a case of,
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:45.240]  they didn't feel like they had enough evidence to actually bring the child in.
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:48.240]  Sure, but sir, that's a false arrest.
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:51.240]  And under Magna Carta, common law, and the Scottish Constitution,
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:54.240]  you are due serious restoration.
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:56.240]  This is a civil rights violation,
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:59.240]  and if you don't, see, the reason people in the UK are so bullied
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:01.240]  is you're so friendly, you're so nice,
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:03.240]  and you have to stand up for everybody's rights, sir.
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:05.240]  I think you really should bring legal action against them,
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:09.240]  because there aren't thought crimes last time I checked.
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:11.240]  Um, well, I thought that as well,
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:13.240]  but obviously, until all this, you know...
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:17.240]  No, I mean, it's the police that need to be arrested, seriously.
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:19.240]  A lot of people were kind of finding it funny
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:21.240]  because the police thought the video itself was offensive.
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:23.240]  They thought it was going to promote, you know, hatred of Jews,
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:25.240]  people and things like that as well.
[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:28.240]  But instead, all they arrested was actually drew even more
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:31.240]  and more attention towards the video itself,
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:33.240]  like, because it's ever since the arrest.
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:35.240]  Yeah, obviously, I mean, are you out to get Jews?
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:36.240]  I mean, even if you were, it's your free speech,
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:37.240]  but, I mean, are you out to get Jews?
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:39.240]  I mean, you come off as a big leftist on your side.
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:41.240]  No, I don't hate anyone.
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:44.240]  I don't hate any creed or race or anything like that.
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:46.240]  Yeah, no, I mean, it's very stylish in Trendyville,
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:47.240]  and I'm not saying you're a bad guy.
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:48.240]  You are very funny, Trendy.
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:50.240]  You're actually a talented guy.
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:51.240]  To be outrageous, correct?
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:53.240]  I mean, that's kind of the style right now.
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:55.240]  It's short comedy is kind of what I do.
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:57.240]  I make a lot of offensive jokes.
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:59.240]  I laugh about terrible things and stuff like that as well,
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:00.240]  but it is all satire.
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:01.240]  I don't really...
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:02.240]  No, I get it.
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:04.240]  I mean, that's all the rage at any big comedy club.
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:06.240]  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:08.240]  It kind of seems that you actually need to have your job
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:13.240]  listed as comedian, though, to, you know, get away with it.
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:15.240]  Well, we're going to go out to break here
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:17.240]  with just a clip of John Cleese,
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:19.240]  again, committing thought crimes far worse than yours
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:20.240]  of Monty Python.
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:21.240]  And I'm calling for the Scottish police
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:23.240]  to put a warrant out for John Cleese.
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:24.240]  Here it is.
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:26.240]  This is hate speech.
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:28.240]  My entire channel is hate speech.
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:31.240]  It's getting close to where I'm going to have to leave the country
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:34.240]  simply to continue to make YouTube videos.
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:36.240]  They're already arresting people
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:39.240]  who criticise Muslim immigration on Twitter.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:40.240]  Now, satire.
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:43.240]  Frigging satire that's not even malicious
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:45.240]  will not be tolerated.
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:47.240]  And this is by no means a one-off case.
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:50.240]  Just a few days ago, a Muslim police chief in Manchester said,
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:57.240]  freedom of speech does not mean freedom of offending culture.
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:19:59.240]  Because they showed the video for TV viewers,
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:01.240]  but I want to play it for radio listeners as well.
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:03.240]  And John Cleese has come out and said,
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:05.240]  you can't go to a college campus or even on TV
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:07.240]  and say anything now.
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:09.240]  And that's what Seinfeld's daughter came and said,
[02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:11.240]  how dare you say you're moving back to New York
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:13.240]  so I can meet more boys.
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:15.240]  Men and women together is bad.
[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:18.240]  And he thought she was really stupid till he found out.
[02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:21.240]  That's what they're teaching, male, female, he, she.
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:22.240]  Don't say it.
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:25.240]  Someone else might not be a he or a she.
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:27.240]  Well, okay, but I'm allowed to be a he or a she
[02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:29.240]  or whatever I want.
[02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:32.240]  You could be a five-foot black woman
[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:37.240]  and think you're a seven-foot Chinese jet pilot from Pluto,
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:39.240]  but it doesn't make it real.
[02:20:39.240 --> 02:20:42.240]  But listen, I don't hate you because you think
[02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:45.240]  you're a seven-foot Chinese jet pilot from Pluto.
[02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:47.240]  The point is, I'm going to be able to say you're crazy.
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:50.240]  It's like the woman who had the state pay
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:52.240]  to have Drano dumped in her eyes
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:55.240]  and they had all these people on the British television
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:57.240]  just thinking it was great.
[02:20:57.240 --> 02:20:59.240]  This is in the US, but they show it there and go,
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:01.240]  she has courage, she blinded herself
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:03.240]  and now the taxpayer pays for it.
[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:06.240]  Any mental illness is now being promoted as good.
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:08.240]  The other is pouring drain cleaner in your eyes,
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:10.240]  the next trendy social justice movement.
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:12.240]  No, I should be able to say, and it's my opinion,
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:15.240]  but let me tell you, it's my opinion, two plus two equals four,
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:18.240]  that this woman is an absolute freakazoi nutcase
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:20.240]  that wants attention.
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:22.240]  And I realize more and more on this new trendy thing
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:24.240]  where you've got to be a victim.
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:27.240]  Women especially, men commit most of the armed robberies
[02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:29.240]  and rapes, we're going to our guests in a moment,
[02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:31.240]  I'm just taking these points to what he says.
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:33.240]  But in criminology, women make stuff up,
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:35.240]  lie on average more than men
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:38.240]  and will claim they're victims of things that didn't happen.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:40.240]  They'll say horrible things happen to them
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:42.240]  just so they can go to court
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:44.240]  and it's proven none of it's true,
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:46.240]  but they don't care because they've got 10 of their girlfriends
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:48.240]  there in the audience feeling sorry for them.
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:50.240]  It's drama queen behavior.
[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:53.240]  Listen, if you want to dump Drano in your eyes fruitcake,
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:56.240]  you need to be locked up because you're going to hurt yourself.
[02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:58.240]  People that used to hurt themselves,
[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:00.240]  we put them in rubber rooms.
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:04.240]  Now I got to pay for you to chop your Johnson off
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:07.240]  or to pour Drano in your eyes.
[02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:09.240]  And the new movement is whether nuggets or whatever,
[02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:11.240]  they cut their arms and legs off and live in a box
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:13.240]  and wear diapers.
[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:16.240]  Paying for you to live in a diaper with your arms and legs chopped off.
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:18.240]  You need to be in a frickin' rubber room.
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:20.240]  Let's play the John Cleese clip
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:22.240]  and go back to our thought criminal friend.
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:23.240]  Who's this then?
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:25.240]  Stuck, you!
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:29.240]  I'll do the funny one.
[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:36.240]  He would have also been hit with hate crimes charges
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.240]  for this Monty Python sketch.
[02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:44.240]  I'm not the AR assistant,
[02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:45.240]  but,
[02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:48.240]  I'm the DCA assistant.
[02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:50.240]  Charlie Chaplin.
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:52.240]  Oh yeah, Charlie Chaplin.
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:54.240]  No, no, let's put the pro-Hitler Jew up.
[02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:55.240]  Who's to be arrested too?
[02:22:55.240 --> 02:22:57.240]  Well he's not, but doesn't matter.
[02:22:57.240 --> 02:22:59.240]  Let's arrest Charlie Chaplin, here it is.
[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:01.240]  He's been thrown in a jail cell for the same reason.
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:04.240]  If they're now treating any video content whatsoever
[02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:05.240]  that causes offense...
[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:07.240]  That's right and anybody can be offended.
[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:11.560]  be offended. This is a political takeover. Isn't the real fascist threat the folks that
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:15.320]  want to control language? Sir, again, the thought criminal that created Hitler dog,
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:20.120]  Mark Meakin. And Mark, how do we visit your website, your YouTube? What are some of the
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:26.840]  other thought crimes you're engaged in? Nothing really. I just kind of want to make people laugh.
[02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:30.920]  That was all just me and my friends just like making stupid videos. Most of them are all just
[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:34.440]  sort of inside jokes between ourselves. And we didn't think people would find it funny,
[02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:39.960]  but apparently they do. And it's just all sort of blew up from there. That was all it was really,
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:43.560]  and didn't really want to commit any thought crimes. No, I get it. Around the office,
[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:47.240]  our form of entertainment is inside jokes, which no one else would understand.
[02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:52.760]  But aren't those the best types of jokes? Yeah, they are. I mean, I find them funny. I thought
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:56.680]  maybe other people would find them funny. You know, I didn't really say how to offend anyone
[02:23:56.680 --> 02:24:00.600]  or anything like that. Just sadly, that's what happened. But it seems that it was only a very,
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:06.280]  very small minority of people that were actually offended. And it's just that for someone to
[02:24:06.280 --> 02:24:12.200]  actually be arrested for hurting someone's feelings, it's absurd. Well, tell us the name
[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:18.280]  of your channel. It's Count Dankula. It's the name of the channel, yeah. Not Count Dracula,
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:24.120]  but Count Dankula. Yeah, Count Dankula. Yeah. Now, let me ask you the really serious question,
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:29.720]  Mark Meakin. Is the dog the holy one? Now, I mean, you'll say I'm worshiping Hitler.
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:37.480]  It's a joke, folks. Is the dog around? The dog is here. Please say, will you please put it in your
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:47.640]  lap? Yeah, no problem. What's the name of Hitler dog? His name is Bidda. Oh, is that a boy or girl?
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:54.520]  Oh, he's a boy. A lot of folks don't like bugs. I really like them. Oh, yeah, he's a lovely dog.
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:25:00.280]  Yeah. Now, do you think that dog's having pro-Hitler thoughts right now or is thinking about food?
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:04.360]  He's thinking about food. That's why he did this salute and everything so he could get a treat.
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:07.560]  Can we get a Hitler salute right now or are you going to arrest it again?
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:13.080]  Now, see, you're scared. John Cleese can do it. And the BBC can,
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:19.000]  faulty tower scan, but you can't. So is freedom 2 plus 2 equals 4 or is freedom the right to have
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.120]  your pug salute Hitler? Which he isn't saluting Hitler, but he's simulating a fascist salute
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:28.520]  for schoolchildren who educate them about the horrors of the Nazis that controlled what people
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:35.400]  could say and do. Oh, I've heard of this before. Well, it's just a case of any kind of restriction
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:40.440]  on free speech in any way is probably one of the most dangerous things to mankind. You are scared
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:47.880]  to have asked the dog about Hitler. Come on. You're afraid. See, we're seeing it folks. Charges
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:51.720]  can still be brought against me even though I was liberated. So let me do it from the United
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:55.320]  States. Let me do it from the United States. What are some of the Q words for the dog?
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:01.320]  And basically, if I say gas the juice.
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:09.160]  And then you've trained it that it gets food when you do that, right?
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:12.680]  Oh, yeah, that's what he thinks it is. Yeah. And of course, there's nothing funny about what Hitler
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:17.800]  did. But you know, the point is, is that we fought Hitler. But if we were Germans, we should be able
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:23.000]  to make a joke because that's what it's all about is how ridiculous it is. It is kind of
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.320]  ridiculous. It definitely shouldn't have got to this stage. No one wants to gas the juice.
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:31.560]  No, no, no, no. Can't hear me. Don't can't hear me. Can the dog hear me?
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:36.280]  I think the dog can probably hear you. Oh my God, that is a cute dog. That dog doesn't get
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:43.560]  kisses, does it? Well, my girlfriend, she she loves him. She loves him loads. Yeah. Is that her
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:50.920]  baby? Yeah. She loves that dog more than she loves me. I believe it. I already like the dog better
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:56.600]  than you. But seriously, I'm joking. You know what I see is more offensive than Hitler dog. And
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:00.680]  do you have a right to put it up? The hammer and sickle has had about 180 million people
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:04.200]  been killed under it. Do you have hammers and sickles in some of your videos as a joke,
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:06.600]  which is your right? Or are you kind of feeling the burn?
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:12.120]  I haven't included like any hammers and sickles or anything like that. You know,
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:15.480]  that's something I could probably do one day, you know, then somebody else must have used one
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:19.160]  of your videos and I apologize. What is your political views?
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:26.040]  Political views are just basically I do believe strongly in free speech. I do believe in free
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:31.000]  enterprise. I do believe in, you know, basically working very, very hard to make sure everyone's
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.880]  an employee. Oh, so you are evil. Okay. So they got you right. No, a good thing may arrest you.
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:41.480]  Sir, can we please see Hitler dog again? I apologize. No, tell it treat. Tell it treat.
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:46.680]  Right. Okay. What does your dog think of Count Denkula?
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:51.160]  Um, I don't think he's any idea about the trouble he's actually caused.
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:56.840]  Anything like did the dogs, did the police interrogate the dog? Do they question the dog?
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:00.520]  Oh, no, no, they didn't. They didn't bring the dog in or anything like that. No.
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:04.680]  You know, some people are now identifying as trans species. Maybe that's not a dog. Maybe
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:08.680]  that's a jet pilot or maybe it's a nuclear physicist. Maybe that's that. Maybe that's a
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:12.840]  person. What if your dog starts identifying as a person? Could it be allowed to say, you know,
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:20.120]  drive an army tank or something? Probably not, man. Well, brother, I really appreciate you spending
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:25.080]  time with us and resimulating the supposed crime that you committed. But I doubt they're going
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:29.400]  to be back again. Any other points you'd like to add, but just please keep the dog on screen for
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:35.480]  us. It's just a case of freedom of speech is something that's absolutely crucial to civilisation.
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:38.920]  You need to be able to criticise everything. If people weren't allowed to do that, you wouldn't
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:43.560]  have had people uprising against brutal dictatorships or anything like that. If people weren't
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:47.640]  allowed to freely express their views, it's something that is extremely important and it's
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:51.800]  paramount to a civilisation thriving. It's not something that should be oppressed. I mean,
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:56.600]  everything that's happened to me is something straight out of 1984. I made a joke and, you know,
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:00.840]  I was immediately arrested and things like that, and it's just wrong. It shouldn't be a crime to
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:05.960]  hop someone's feelings. That's pretty much it. I think your dog, maybe the cutest pug ever,
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:11.640]  what is the cue to get the dog to, let's say, down with Hitler and then perhaps he'll salute that,
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:16.200]  that'll make the police happier. Down with Hitler? Down with Hitler?
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:23.400]  Yeah, I've got probably to try and teach him some other more politically correct
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.240]  talk to him. All right, it's Count Dankula on YouTube. Everybody should subscribe.
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:31.640]  This is Port Free Speech. Nonetheless, you're a very talented guy, Mark, and your girlfriend
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:36.520]  as well seems some of her videos. And please, we'd like your dog to be a reporter for M4Wars.com
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:41.880]  and a free speech advocate. Thank you so much, sir. Great having you. Thanks very much. Cheers.
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:47.880]  All right, there he goes, folks. Really nice chap there, and a good attitude about the whole
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:53.560]  thing, but I'm telling you, this is dangerous. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex
[02:29:53.560 --> 02:30:02.920]  Jones and the GCN Radio Network. The Obama administration has told every public school
[02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:07.560]  district in the country that they must allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker
[02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:12.680]  rooms that match their chosen gender identity as opposed to their birth certificate. And while
[02:30:12.680 --> 02:30:17.480]  the administration's letter doesn't have the force of law, it does warn schools that by not
[02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:23.080]  abiding by the administration's interpretation, they might face lawsuits or loss of federal funds.
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:28.120]  Regardless of where you stand on gender identity politics, the fact is the federal government
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:33.160]  is mandating that people abide by their interpretation of a law that has to do with something that,
[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:37.640]  frankly, everyone is confused by. Earlier this week, the Justice Department and the State of
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:42.680]  North Carolina filed dueling lawsuits over the state's controversial bathroom law. The DOJ
[02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:47.800]  alleges employment discrimination on the basis of sex, while North Carolina accuses the administration
[02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:52.360]  of baseless and blatant overreach. Either way, we're witnessing an attempt to unilaterally
[02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:57.800]  rewrite long-established federal civil rights laws in order to suit an agenda. Read more right now

[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:32.360]  you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones. Rob Dew, our news director, is real sick with the flu
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:36.680]  or something, but he's better now. But he's the guy that got this footage along with the rest of
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:42.760]  our great crew around the country getting exhausted in dozens of states following the social justice
[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:50.360]  warriors that spit in your face, physically attack you, you name it. Whether it was in Milwaukee,
[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:55.960]  Wisconsin, or whether it was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or whether it was in San Francisco,
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:34:00.760]  California, it doesn't matter. They would all run up and scream, you're an effing white male.
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:05.720]  And I hate to talk like that, but that's what they say. And it's like white women and white
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:10.600]  men are the ones that they walk over and they go, you don't get to talk. You're a white male.
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:15.400]  And of course, it's not lost on them. I guess they know that they're white too.
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:22.280]  And I'm not trying to, you know, social justice signal or whatever they call it when I
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:30.680]  kind of say the virtue signal when I say that I think the worst social justice warriors are white,
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:37.320]  usually, because maybe they have the most white guilt and they've got something to prove. I don't
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:45.640]  know what it is, but these people are wild and they are so incredibly stupid. Now, I didn't give this
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:49.960]  guy this nickname, AIDS Creelix, but I don't know his real name. This is one of the biggest memes on
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:54.920]  the internet. But when you're out in public screaming that folks don't have any right to speech,
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:59.800]  and all over the country, people walk up with a camera and get, you are a white male. Check your
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:06.200]  privilege and shut up. We ought to just take a whole compilation of the, hey, you're a white male,
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:11.800]  shut up. And they'll be there with some blue collar guy standing in the line going, you're a
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:16.600]  privileged white male. They're like, huh? You know, it's like Bernie Sanders. There are no poor white
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:21.480]  people in the world. Really, really, they're more than twice as many as there are black people.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:25.080]  You can argue they're more blacks per capita and that's true. They're poor and that's, you know,
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:31.240]  should be worked on, obviously, but it's still numbers double in the U.S., double.
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:36.760]  Physically, you know, numbers, but they don't count. See, they're not human. But this isn't a
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:40.920]  black versus white or Hispanic versus white deal. This is what the media is making it. Again,
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:44.360]  it's divide and conquer. And I know you know that. I'm going to go to Debbie and I'm going to go to
[02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:50.520]  Suzette and Kirby and Aaron and Tim right now. And here in just a moment, Tim listening on
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:56.840]  KEIB in California. We're going to go to him in just a moment. But before we do that, I wanted
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:02.120]  to play just AID Screlics. That's the Internet's name for this unknown soldier of the Social
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:08.200]  Justice Warrior Guild. But here it is. You've never experienced oppression in your entire
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:15.640]  f***ing life. Neither have I. You're f***ing a white male. You're f***ing a white male.
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:23.400]  And that's Carl the Cuck. Cluck. I mean, you can't get better entertainment than this.
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:29.640]  My son says the whole school watches these and then I talk to other kids and they say,
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:34.520]  this is all anyone watches. The left is in trouble, man. And by the way, I'm talking about
[02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:38.680]  so-called minority kids are watching it. I mean, everyone cannot stand these people.
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:53.160]  I mean, it's crazy how dumb they are.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:24.120]  Jack Dallas, Republican, you're on with Joe Tigenova.
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:30.040]  Hey Joe, how you doing? I'm Jack Strickland. The question I don't see being addressed is
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:33.640]  the abundance of references in our emails about AID Screlics.
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:40.360]  You're f***ing a white male. You're a white male. Sorry about that. We're gonna go ahead and move on.
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:48.760]  I'm sorry. It's like a month old or whatever. I can't help it. I gotta watch at least five
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:56.440]  times a day. Sorry. I have guilty pleasures. I kind of got past watching people who are dumb
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:01.960]  for entertainment, man. These videos are just too luscious, except when you realize they've got our
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:05.640]  kids, they've got our culture, they've taken over it. They don't want to thrive and build cities
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:10.680]  or have better science. They just want to run around pecking at everyone that they're evil
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:14.840]  and they're homophobic and they're bad. And you're just like, hey dude, I don't care what you do. Just
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:23.400]  leave me alone. Shut up. You're a white male. Donald Trump wants a bunch of wars. Actually,
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:29.640]  he was against the Iraq war. Shut up. You're a white male. Obamacare doubles prices. Shut up,
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:36.360]  racist. Obama's coming for the gun. Shut up, racist. They've opened the borders. It's bankrupting.
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:42.840]  Shut up, racist. That's the new intellectual thing. All right. I'm sorry. I'm gonna shut up now,
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:46.680]  speaking of shut up, racist. We're gonna go to Tim and her to second, but first Debbie.
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:52.280]  This is all the longest Kirby and Aaron, Suzette and others. Debbie, thank you for holding from
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:56.280]  New Jersey. You know what about the TSA? I mean, I should read, you know, kick that off and talk
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:03.960]  about that the first hour up at the airport there in Chicago, four hour waits, three hour waits,
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:10.600]  mile long lines and the TSA holding its hostage saying, give us more money. We want some money,
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:16.440]  Lebowski. And I said, I can get you a tow about two o'clock with paint. You know, I'm sorry. Go
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:25.080]  ahead, Debbie. So I called in to talk radio New Jersey 101.5 again. And the article was a TSA
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:30.920]  article and it was discussing the abuse of power. So my comment was that the original jihad and
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:36.360]  fraud in chief, who say Obama was flying in tens of thousands of illegals into the airports
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:42.280]  with no vetting, that we have no borders and that we shouldn't be giving up our liberty for
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:49.880]  full security. So the host asked me, you know, who's your new source? And I was gonna say in
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:55.080]  four words, I did not because I did not want him to call me a conspiracy theorist. So I said,
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:02.600]  Drudge report. So he said, wow, he says, um, they have a very respected news crew there.
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:08.040]  They're a highly respected news source. And I said, yes, they are. So the following day,
[02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:14.840]  I called in to the same show on an issue regarding the HUD section eight housing.
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:22.040]  And when they took my call, the kid asked me what my comment was. So I said, my comment is that
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:27.320]  they plan on putting all these new jihad in the section eight housing. And they said, oh,
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:32.920]  we're sorry, we can't take your call. Wow. I just found it amusing. Well, sure, sure, ma'am, ma'am,
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:36.600]  let him call you a conspiracy theorist. That's a badge of honor. In fact, I meant to cover that
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:42.040]  today. I actually have written here the true definition of conspiracy theory. And then also
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:45.400]  someone talk about the fact this is Friday the 13th and the history of Friday the 13th. But
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:49.640]  I'll do that after our next guest leaves us and after we've, after we've taken calls. But
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:55.720]  the true definition of a conspiracy theorist is someone that studies history and knows that
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:02.760]  there are organized crime elements in, in, in human community that always try to set up the
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:08.840]  same type of systems and they destroy civilization. So a conspiracy theorist is someone that questions
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:15.080]  known liars and the studied history. The Bible, every history book warns of criminal conspiracies,
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:21.400]  combines, cults, groups that seek power, that take control of civilization. Every fairy tale,
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:28.120]  every fable, everything children were warned about through stories is about that because it
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:33.800]  happens over and over again in fiction and in reality. It all mirrors. And now the last 60 years
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:38.280]  they said there is no corruption. There is no problems. Oh, there isn't your town or city,
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:44.200]  but not at the top. There's nothing happening. And so you've got a media with a 6% trust rate
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.280]  trying to make you feel dumb. And by the way, he was being sarcastic, you know,
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:51.400]  because I guess you called in about the problem yesterday before it was big news when drugs
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:57.080]  first linked to it. Oh, that's a big news source that did that. Uh-huh. Because it was a citizen
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:01.480]  with a camera showing the giant line. Well, thank God the citizens are reporting to the people.
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:06.520]  We see something. We say something. So local news wouldn't have covered that. That's now
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:11.720]  national news and local news. We forced it out. You forced it out. Drudge forced it out.
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:15.880]  It was six, seven years ago, the whole TSA controversy started because Drudge almost
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:20.120]  every week would link to our articles and stuff. People sent us of them searching kids and saying
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:26.120]  they weren't and then letting Muslims through with full, you know, burkas on. So who cares what
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:33.320]  news source it is? We show this line that takes 15 minutes to walk up. We show three, four hour
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:39.960]  longer waits. We show luggage piled up in huge parking lots and we forced them to cover it.
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:46.360]  That's what they can't stand. So they go, Oh, Debbie, where'd you see that? Look, believe me,
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:52.200]  it has more credibility with the general public to say info wars.com or drudge report.com that
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:59.080]  doesn't say CBS news. But regardless, regardless, it shows how desperate they are with 6% still
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:03.400]  trusting them. They're there to make you feel like you're alone. You're by yourself when you're the
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:10.680]  majority, ma'am. So good job talking yesterday about the admitted TSA lines all over the country
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:14.520]  that are getting worse and worse, and they're totally horrible. And then they leave our borders
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:20.200]  open and fly aircraft in New York Daily News, Associated Press, CBS, if you want to use those,
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:26.120]  have all reported planes land every day and the feds say search no one's passports or IDs, let
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:31.160]  them in. But let's see, the host thinks his listeners are dumb. So when you bring that up,
[02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:36.840]  he wants to giggle at you with his big voice and feel powerful over you, Debbie, because they've
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:42.120]  got talk radio on a one inch leash now, and they're bringing in all this money for advertising
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:47.240]  from big conduits that don't even make money back on it. But to control the content, it is on,
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:51.560]  I have been told by affiliates everywhere that pressure is on. That's why you hear us on stations
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:56.360]  around the country. You need to support them because they're bucking the trend to shut down
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:00.360]  free speech, Debbie. God bless you. But you hit the nail on the head. Our borders are open. The
[02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:04.680]  Border Patrol can place the smuggling process. That's from the head of the Border Patrol Union.
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:11.800]  That's a quote. We're reporting the facts. They're bringing jihadis in. It's all a hoax. It's all a
[02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:16.600]  fraud. And now they want more funding for more naked body scanners and highway checkpoints
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:23.240]  when the borders wide open. That's like leaving your front door open and your bedroom door open,
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:30.360]  but then hiring an armed guard to randomly search people that try to enter your children's room
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:35.240]  at night. No, you just have an alarm and lock the door. It's crazy. But see, they want to make you
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:40.120]  pay for the armed guard. No, we're going to lock the door and we're going to have our own guns.
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:45.480]  See, they want the monopoly. God bless you. Great points. Who's been holding the most next?
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:49.320]  We'll go to Kirby and then to Tim. Kirby, you're on the air from California. Go ahead.
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:56.920]  Hi, Alex. Welcome. We are beloved, Alex. Thank you so much for all the truth,
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:01.080]  because that's the knowledge and the power. Yeah. Well, I mean, the last lady called in and said
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:04.840]  it better than I said, I mean, a lot of this is pretty simple, you know, the borders wide open
[02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:09.160]  and they got checkpoints grabbing our genitals. I mean, that's that's about getting in our space
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:13.800]  like a dog. You're editing on another dog to let us know that we are dominated. We are slaves. We
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:20.040]  are over. Sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, children could understand it and they are our future. So here's
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:27.720]  here's the thing. Yes, absolutely. It's time for the gloves to come off. Absolutely. So the truth
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:32.920]  is out there. The knowledge has been out there. You look at sites like you guys on all your social
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:38.520]  media sites. My goodness, it's millions upon millions upon millions of viewers, right?
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:44.680]  Isn't that a beautiful thing? How much how many people you guys reach? And we're one small part
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:49.240]  of it, ma'am. You can start a YouTube too. You can start a radio blog. It's about everybody
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:55.240]  realizing what they have to say matters. You are just as important, Suzette or Kirby got a
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:46:01.160]  bunch of calls changing here on the screen. You are just as important as a New York Times writer
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:04.760]  or a Washington Post writer or a Daily Beast writer. And of course, I'm stealing that from
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:10.360]  Matt Drudge, but he's bat over the years and sent a nice little notice of my writers, you know,
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:13.960]  saying, Hey, you're just as important as a New York. I shouldn't tell inside baseball, but
[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:17.960]  he didn't say, don't say this so I can say it. He's a very private guy and he's tweeted stuff
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:22.440]  like this. But you know, it's like Charlton Heston when he used to say, Hey, call me up.
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:26.120]  If you ever need encouragement or want to talk and I'm like, you're kidding. So I called it a
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:29.960]  few times a month later, didn't answer, called one day he answered. We talked like 35 minutes.
[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:34.040]  He's been on the show too before he died, but he really cared about the future. He really cared
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:37.160]  about young people. He really cared about encouraging people. And you know, Matt Drudge
[02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:41.400]  has sent nice notes to people going, Hey, you know, be bold in what you're doing,
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:44.440]  you know, be proud of what you're doing when, when Drudge has emailed somebody and they've
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:47.560]  said, really, I'm doing a good job or whatever. He's like, yeah, you're just as important as
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:52.120]  the New York Times. Well, I go further. You as listeners are more important than the New York
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:58.680]  Times. They've proven themselves to spin and lie and deceive. Okay. You know, you're for real.
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:02.520]  You know, you want the truth. You're not on a globalist payroll. I respect somebody
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:07.480]  when the cops did a bad thing, shot that innocent man four or five years ago in San Francisco,
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:12.440]  in the back and then lied about it at the train station and took everybody's cameras away,
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:16.680]  but one person crouching in the back of a train got it on tape. That person's a hero.
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:23.080]  They deserve a Pulitzer Prize. That's journalism out there where they could have been killed for
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:30.360]  doing that or beat up and sent to prison doing it. So that person deserves a prize. In fact,
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:34.520]  I want to establish some system where we give yearly awards to the best citizen activists and
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:38.520]  journalists out there because this needs to be honored. The globalist to honor all their groups
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:43.480]  to make us feel, you know, small and then big. Bull, you are more important than the dying
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:49.080]  dinosaur media to take what Matt Drudge said and take it to the next level. Okay. Thank you, Kirby.
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:54.680]  Appreciate your call. But see, does Matt Drudge want to hang around with all the famous people?
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:48:00.200]  No, no. He wants to sit there and encourage real grassroots people. So do I because we're in a
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:06.440]  war, people. The globalists are evil. And once you get that, you understand this is a fight.
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:13.880]  All right. I want to go to Tim listening on KEIB. I know we got a lot of new affiliates, but
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:18.600]  is that a new affiliate? Because I've never heard of KEIB. We'll find out exactly where that is
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:24.280]  in California. We got like six or seven affiliates out in California, but that's, I'll talk to him
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:28.440]  in just a moment. But first, Suzette, I'd miss what she was saying. That's important. Chemical
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:33.240]  plant, local security ramping up. Yes, they're ramping up security, which bogs down our economy,
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:38.040]  but we got to do it all over the country because they believe jihad threats are imminent against
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:42.360]  chemical plants, new plants, you name it, because they've gotten the documents from ISIS. That's
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:46.120]  what they're planning to do. Why'd you let them in to begin with? It goes back to what the caller
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:52.360]  before last said. So thank you, Suzette. Great points. Let's go ahead. Oh, no, Suzette's there.
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:54.920]  I'm out of control today. Excuse me. Suzette, you're on the air.
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:49:02.280]  Oh, hi, Alex. Thank you. Go ahead and talk to you. Hey, I just want, this is off topic,
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:07.880]  but one of the other guys that loves to mock Hitler was Mel Brooks. He made millions doing it.
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:12.040]  But that's right. He got to arrest Mel Brooks now. I guess he's able to.
[02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:21.080]  That's right. He's racist. I live all about three or four blocks from the place that used to be
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:31.000]  called Biofort, and now it's emergent. And they were, evidently at the time about 9-11, the only
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:38.840]  place that was producing a vaccine for anthrax and a few other things. And they are, I knew
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:44.600]  a vet that worked there, and she would talk occasionally about what was going on. But they
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:51.080]  have all sorts of little nasties in there. And remember, not too long ago, they were importing
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:58.520]  scientists from Europe to work there because evidently nobody in the United States was smart
[02:49:58.520 --> 02:50:07.720]  enough to work there. So they have hardened that facility since 9-11. They've got about 12-foot
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:15.160]  high, oh, gothic type fencing with the points at the top. They've got concertina wire and
[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:22.600]  no man's land between the two fences, and they built an army depot directly across the street.
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:28.520]  Well, they are, they are hardening the, the infrastructure all over, but you don't do that
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:32.040]  and leave the border open. They're like building us up, getting us ready for the attack,
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:35.880]  and then I guess bringing permanent martial law afterwards, following a civil emergency.
[02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:40.040]  Great point, Suzette. Thanks for holding to tell us that. By the way, I get all of our affiliates
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:45.080]  confused. We have so many, and I know we have two stations in the Los Angeles area. One barely
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:51.240]  comes in, one is in it. That's our big Los Angeles affiliate, KEIB, 1150 AM. I'm kind of out of it
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:56.040]  today. It's called the Patriot. They're wonderful. And the one area I dropped the ball was promoting
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:59.560]  our affiliates, but it's not for lack of love. It's just I'm overworked, folks.

[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:15.960]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer. He asked if I could beat a very high quote
[02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:21.320]  another life insurance agent had given him. I said, let me see. Well, I took his pertinent
[02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:26.280]  information, then shopped the highly rated price competitive companies we represent,
[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:31.240]  and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.

[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:10.680]  All right. I tend to spend out of control sometimes for the third fourth hour. We have
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:15.960]  a former Army Ranger assigned as a contractor to the CIA, Benghazi hero joining us who wrote the
[02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:24.840]  book 13 hours that was made into the film in the next hour. I am a syndicated radio host. I've been
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:29.400]  in the top 20 talkers or whatever in magazines and stuff. I really don't have time to follow all
[02:54:29.400 --> 02:54:36.680]  that. We dominate the internet. We dominate YouTube. We dominate Facebook. Some say I'm in
[02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:41.960]  the top 10 terrestrial host. I'm not measuring things here. I just want to warn people. I hope
[02:54:41.960 --> 02:54:49.560]  all the big hosts start talking about this stuff. But I really need to spend more time with our AM
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:55.720]  and FM affiliates and more time cutting winers for them and more time even working with listeners
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:55:01.400]  to buy billboards and advertising because the show really has hit its biggest growth period ever.
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:06.200]  And I'll talk about how many affiliates we have. It's way higher than I've even been saying. I just
[02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:10.280]  am too busy battling the globalists to even pay attention. And I don't have the crew or infrastructure
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:14.440]  to focus on a lot of the things we're doing because I don't have the capital.
[02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:21.240]  And talk radios that way too. Giant audiences, the best place to advertise compared to the internet
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:26.680]  and TV and stuff in my view. But people just don't know that. And I think radio is so neglected.
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:30.920]  But I was thinking when they said the affiliates name and I'm going to the caller,
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:37.640]  let's put it back on screen for TV viewers. When they said the radio call letters for KEIB
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:45.080]  1150, I used to go on that station as a guest overnight. It's 50,000 watts daytime,
[02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:50.200]  44,000 watts nighttime. Folks, AM goes across the country with that level of power.
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:54.760]  Now, mainly it aims out at the ocean, but that's one of the top stations in LA.
[02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:59.800]  And it's like surreal that I'm on some of the biggest stations in New York, Chicago, you name it.
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:04.440]  They'll have like New York Times articles going, Alex Jones is an internet radio host,
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:10.360]  like I haven't been on AM and FM radio for 21 years. But that's how they manipulate their
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:18.840]  audiences. That's why they're losing their audiences. But yes, we're like on WNJ 1160, 20,000 watts
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:26.840]  in the daytime in New York City. I've got to do targeted ads for my listeners in that area or
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:32.520]  something just to help those stations because it's so good to be on some of the biggest stations
[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:37.800]  in the country. And it's happening. And it's because people finally go, wait, I guess Alex Jones
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:43.320]  is really right. Stuff is gone so far now that I'm almost basically becoming passe.
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:49.640]  But isn't that good? And we get stations great ratings. But it is so important to spread the
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:54.280]  word about those stations to become sponsors of those. I cannot stress to you enough how serious
[02:56:54.280 --> 02:56:58.360]  this globalist war is against free and independent media. Look at the Facebook Senate hearings.
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:03.080]  We exposed it. You exposed it. Talk radio exposed it. Drudge report exposed it. There's now hearings.
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:09.000]  And it was like they untied a boat from the dock with the engine on. We're now flying at high speed.
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:15.000]  All of our Facebook stuff is suddenly just exploding because they took the foot off our neck.
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:19.960]  And if they're going to have a foot on our neck, they should at least be honest about it.
[02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:28.440]  Tim in California is a calling and he says he wants Hugh Hewitt for VP. I guess for Trump. Go ahead, Sir.
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:35.320]  You Alex, I'm Tim Callum carrying Hugh Hewitt for U.S. Vice President for Trump and
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:40.520]  Tim Callum carrying for U.S. President U.S. Senate and U.S. House. Best major candidate,
[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:47.160]  T.I.M. Space K.A. L.E. M.K.A. R.I.N. Well, I mean, yeah, Hugh Hewitt's a great talk show host. I
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:51.880]  know I think I've been on his show before. Trying to get rid of Obamacare. I want Hugh Hewitt to
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:56.920]  be my vice president. Also, well, I want to make you vice president, Tim. All I know is isn't it
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:58:00.840]  exciting how fast people are waking up? I mean, I'm not trying to put perfume on a pig here. We're
[02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:04.840]  in a pickle, but kettle of fish. But I tell you, some good stuff's happening too. What do you think?
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:13.800]  I think it's great. You're on from midnight till 3 a.m. here on 1150 a.m. K.E. I.B. I know. And
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:16.520]  I've been on there like a year and a half. And I remember them telling me here and a half ago,
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:21.880]  oh, you're on a 50,000 watt blowtorch in L.A., one of the top stations, and it's just like surreal.
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:27.240]  Because, folks, it's so hard to get on those, it'll make your head spin. But that's how it
[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:33.320]  operates. Look, when I got big on XM and Sirius, they had big money come in from Goldman Sachs
[02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:38.680]  to get me off. And I was told that by the execs. This is a war, folks. We'll be back in 60 seconds
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:43.960]  with the fourth hour. I love you all. It's great to be a patriot, isn't it? This is GCN,

[03:00:13.880 --> 03:00:36.200]  The CIA station chief, where you were at the time, told you repeatedly according to the
[03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:42.040]  the movie, stand down. We saw that in the trailer. Use the words stand down. Is that how you remember
[03:00:42.040 --> 03:00:47.880]  it? Yeah, I mean, it was him. It was the chief of base, deputy chief and our team leader sitting
[03:00:47.880 --> 03:00:53.000]  on the front porch and when he told me to stand down. It was, take, take said, right, we're losing
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:59.080]  the initiative and we were. Why is it wrong? Why? You know, the position is you're here to protect
[03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:04.200]  the annex. They have some security personnel over at the consulate, which our viewers should know.
[03:01:04.200 --> 03:01:08.360]  Congressional investigators have already found was woefully inadequate and that we were totally
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:13.320]  unprepared. That state had totally left those guys unprepared to defend themselves. But in the
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:17.400]  moment, that station chief at the annex is saying to you stand down. You're here to protect us,
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:22.520]  this facility, not that one. Well, I don't think it was just for us to protect that facility.
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:27.960]  It's just how he was. There's multiple security situations when we should have left and he never
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:34.200]  let us go. Why? I was just risk adverse in my opinion. This last station, he wanted his legacy
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:39.400]  to be what it was. He didn't want to lose anybody, I guess. You got trained Army Rangers. You got
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:44.600]  Navy SEALs. You got Marines. Yeah. Stand the best, the best in the world standing there ready to go.
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:50.120]  All right. We have had the former Speaker of the House, Boehner, who I'm not a fan of,
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:54.680]  another Rhino, but he's even come out and said, Hillary really shouldn't run. She should drop
[03:01:54.680 --> 03:01:59.320]  out. There's a good chance she's going to get indicted. Well, I mean, she's been caught on the
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:05.400]  servers. She's been caught in Benghazi. She's been caught over and over again. I'm really worried
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:08.920]  about her supporters. I mean, if there was a Republican with all this baggage, I wouldn't
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:16.440]  support them. And then once she's president, what crimes is she going to commit? Chris Peranto was
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:20.840]  one of the folks that was there brave enough to go on Fox a few months ago. The Army Rangers
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:25.480]  saw a lot of combat duty and then got into the CIA as a contractor in their annex security team.
[03:02:25.480 --> 03:02:29.560]  He's one of the few survivors from it and one of the people that refused to stand down. And he
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:35.640]  was there. They testified to the orders to stand down from their boss. And of course, we know
[03:02:35.640 --> 03:02:41.000]  who was getting orders. At that point, it was coming directly from the State Department. This
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:44.280]  could really bring down the entire corrupt system with him. We're going to go to break
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:48.760]  in a moment, come back with a long segment with our guests. But Chris, is this surreal for you
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:54.760]  to be in the middle of this and now it'd be a major movie based on your book and other research
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:03:01.880]  and others and to see Hillary still hanging on by her fingernails? Honestly, as the more stuff
[03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:08.440]  that comes out, we just had another revelation with the Special Forces Sergeant Major that came
[03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:13.720]  out, Adam Housley reported on it, as well as one of the pilots from Avion Air Base. It's
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:20.680]  becoming, it's vindicating. It's becoming more and more vindicating to us because it's showing
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:26.760]  that we are telling the truth, that myself, Tig and Oz and the other two guys, Jack and Boone,
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:31.160]  that we came out initially, said what had placed people, didn't believe us.
[03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:36.600]  Book was written to get this started to get the truth out there. And now as more information
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:41.400]  comes out, people are finally seeing, hey, guess what? Rangers, Seals and Marines, they aren't
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:45.320]  lying, which I don't know why people would say that anyway, but they did initially the first
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:52.280]  two, three years. So to me, it's vindicating and to see her keep saying that it didn't happen,
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:58.440]  to call the family's liars, to basically call us liars, surreal isn't the word, it's more anger
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:03.320]  and disrespect. That's what I continue to feel and the more that comes out, the more anger I feel.
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:11.720]  Well, I tell you, it is simply, simply incredible to be in the middle of this,
[03:04:11.720 --> 03:04:16.360]  as just a reporter since day one, having people on like Colonel Shaffer and others a week after
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:20.840]  it happened, he'd obviously already heard to the military, to the army, exactly what had unfolded
[03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:27.400]  and what had gone on. And it's just, it's so sad that we've gotten to this point as a nation,
[03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:30.280]  we're going to break in a moment, but in your gut, where do you think this is all going?
[03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:37.160]  Well, the more that good people, the ones that were on the ground that we're trying to assist,
[03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:43.480]  are standing up and speaking out, I'm seeing it going in the favor of people still saying that
[03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:47.400]  she wasn't telling the truth, that she was lying and that she tried to cover it up and the State
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:53.000]  Department really did fail us and tried to cover up for her. So hopefully I'm seeing it go in the
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:57.560]  direction that she does drop out as president. Absolutely. This is huge. Chris, stay right
[03:04:57.560 --> 03:05:03.800]  there. We'll be back. Thank you. We could have saved Navy Seals in Benghazi, F-16 pilots in
[03:05:03.800 --> 03:05:10.120]  Italy were on standby to help besiege U.S. forces in Libya, but the order to launch never came.
[03:05:10.120 --> 03:05:15.240]  A U.S. Air Force sources claim that a squadron of attack jets was being armed and fueled on the
[03:05:15.240 --> 03:05:21.800]  night of the deadly attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya on September 11th, 2012.
[03:05:21.800 --> 03:05:27.720]  The jets, believed to be F-16s, were on the runway ready to launch as terrorists bombarded the U.S.
[03:05:27.720 --> 03:05:33.560]  consulate, killing four Americans. The source claims the fighters could have launched from Aviano
[03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:40.120]  Air Force Base in northern Italy and refueled at Naval Air Station Sigonella before providing air
[03:05:40.120 --> 03:05:46.920]  support over Benghazi. And yet, all we hear is Hillary Clinton saying, what difference at this
[03:05:46.920 --> 03:05:55.640]  point does it make? She is the most vile, un-American human being to ever live. She is pure evil in
[03:05:55.640 --> 03:05:59.480]  the flesh. This has been Joe Bates with infowars.com.
[03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:03.480]  Hey, everyone. Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many of you know,
[03:06:03.480 --> 03:06:08.440]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking statistics
[03:06:08.440 --> 03:06:13.000]  despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman,
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:17.640]  and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses
[03:06:17.640 --> 03:06:21.560]  are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge,
[03:06:21.560 --> 03:06:26.120]  and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a
[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:29.320]  health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,

[03:07:23.080 --> 03:07:29.000]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple
[03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:34.360]  blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine. On top of that, we also screen our iodine for
[03:07:34.360 --> 03:07:39.400]  radiation before bottling. It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there. Quite frankly,
[03:07:39.400 --> 03:07:44.360]  I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine, that major brands and
[03:07:44.360 --> 03:07:48.680]  major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula, and that they have been unable
[03:07:48.680 --> 03:07:55.240]  to come up with anything even close to what we have. It is exclusive to infowarsleif.com
[03:07:55.240 --> 03:07:58.680]  and the infowarsleif family of incredible products.
[03:07:58.680 --> 03:08:20.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:26.360]  so does he. Live from the infowars.com studio, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:34.360]  Chris Tonto-Paranto, as he's known, former Ranger, Second Battalion, 75th Element.
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.640]  I don't want to go over his whole biode. He's only here with us a couple more segments. He's
[03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:45.000]  got to go. Security military consultant, hero Benghazi attack, and he wrote the book 13 hours.
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:48.760]  It's based on that. And I couldn't believe Hollywood put something out that, according to
[03:08:48.760 --> 03:08:52.600]  people that I know, that you know all these guys, and now we're talking to one of them
[03:08:52.600 --> 03:08:56.920]  themselves that wrote the book on it. It's very accurate from their perspective. I only had the
[03:08:56.920 --> 03:09:01.880]  perspective of Colonel Schaefer and Tosh Plumlee and other Pentagon sources that within a week
[03:09:01.880 --> 03:09:07.000]  said, ordered, came down from the CIA. That was from the State Department. They had drones over it,
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:12.840]  eight hours of firefights, hours before that to stand down. I mean, Hillary and Obama really
[03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:17.960]  think we're stupid. Let me ask Chris, who is a hero, because he has the will not just to have
[03:09:17.960 --> 03:09:23.160]  courage physically, but to buck them saying shut up and lie. And a lot of other folks have had that
[03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:27.960]  courage, that moral courage. What do you think they were really doing there? Why are they covering
[03:09:27.960 --> 03:09:33.400]  it up so nakedly? Why do they think they could have a 13 hour stand down and not have the whole
[03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:40.120]  internal military structure learn of the treason? You know, it goes to arrogance. The way I look
[03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:44.440]  at it. And you said it, you said it right there. Are they going to just lie and people going to
[03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:50.840]  believe it? Well, you know what? Half America did. And that just goes arrogance. That goes how our
[03:09:50.840 --> 03:09:55.880]  country is nowadays as well, where they would rather believe politicians than seals and rangers
[03:09:55.880 --> 03:10:01.080]  and Marines and military veterans. That's a sorry state we're in right now. Another reason, you
[03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:06.760]  know, there was an election going on. Terrorism was on the run, which it wasn't. So, you know,
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:11.560]  comes out that there's a terrorist attack. And an ambassador of Chris Stevens stature,
[03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:18.120]  great man dies, you know, and Mitt Romney actually grabs his own, grabs himself there and is a man
[03:10:18.120 --> 03:10:23.320]  about it. He attacks Obama. He wins the election. So there's a lot of different things. And then
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:28.360]  also just just overthrow Gaddafi was a mistake, to be honest with you. And that was the State
[03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:31.960]  Department that pushed that that was Hillary that pushed that. So that paterna bad light. There's
[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:38.120]  so many different reasons that that they wanted to spin the truth. Well, your book is what is
[03:10:38.120 --> 03:10:43.080]  the number one New York Times about selling now? It has been several times the hardback and the
[03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:47.800]  paperback both. And it's it's been on New York Times for, geez, I don't know, three years now.
[03:10:47.800 --> 03:10:52.040]  So off and on for the last three years. So people want to know the truth. And the more
[03:10:52.040 --> 03:10:56.280]  they find out from folks like yourself, the more they find out from people coming forward,
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:11:00.200]  Trigati's committee, actually, I think is doing a good job. The more people go and pick up the
[03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:03.720]  book and they read what happened on the ground. And I'm glad people are doing that because they
[03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:07.000]  finally are listening to the guys that were on the ground that night and not politicians that
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:11.960]  were watching it on Facebook or social media. I just don't know how Hillary and Obama thought
[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:15.240]  they'd get away with it. Joe Biggs, I mean, you've been in the military, you've been in combat,
[03:11:15.240 --> 03:11:20.040]  you got more experience interviewing this guy than I do. But it just seems crazy that they think
[03:11:20.040 --> 03:11:24.600]  they get away with this. Well, the thing is, is we have these reports coming out that the Air Force
[03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:29.880]  had these F 16s on standby, fueling, they could have been there, you know, as an air asset to
[03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:34.200]  cover these guys. And in the past, right, Chris, you guys had used some of these assets before
[03:11:34.200 --> 03:11:39.400]  in previous missions. So it's really weird for me that all of a sudden, this time this day,
[03:11:40.360 --> 03:11:44.200]  they weren't able to do it. You know, I talked to Marine yesterday that has buddies that's part
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:48.600]  of a fast team that was ready to go in there and help out as well. And for some reason, everyone
[03:11:48.600 --> 03:11:54.040]  was told to stand down. Well, let's talk about that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I thought that a week was,
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:59.240]  it was about letting the ISIS Al Qaeda people, they weren't called ISIS, then get those warehouses,
[03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:03.800]  ship it into Syria and have plausible deniability. And the ambassador wasn't going along. Is that
[03:12:03.800 --> 03:12:08.840]  accurate or inaccurate? Well, you know, and that's that that is a gray. I don't know for sure. I'll
[03:12:08.840 --> 03:12:13.480]  be honest. I don't know for sure. I've heard the same things where their weapons moving around.
[03:12:13.480 --> 03:12:16.920]  Yeah, there were stockpiles of Gaddafi's weapons that were there that were out of getting out of
[03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:22.360]  everybody's hands that we're trying to get. So but to say that there was an affairs action going on,
[03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:27.800]  because because of my nondisclosure, and maybe that answers your question right there, because
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:32.440]  of my nondisclosure, I can't discuss a lot of stuff. Well, what about threats? We know a lot
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:36.840]  of higher ups have been threatened. People have been sanctions. Just a lot of crazy things have
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:40.200]  happened. They've talked about witness protection programs and things. Yeah. I mean, can you speak
[03:12:40.200 --> 03:12:46.600]  to the threats? You know, a lot of it really was is passive aggressive threats. It does take a lot
[03:12:46.600 --> 03:12:52.520]  of moral courage to actually step forward. We lost our jobs because you know, you put your faith in
[03:12:52.520 --> 03:12:55.480]  God a little bit and say, you know, what's the right thing to do here? Well, the right thing to
[03:12:55.480 --> 03:12:59.880]  do is tell the truth. We lost our jobs. A lot of those people that were saved that night aren't
[03:12:59.880 --> 03:13:03.320]  doing the right thing. They don't have the moral courage. They're worried about their jobs. They're
[03:13:03.320 --> 03:13:07.400]  worried about finances, which, hey, I understand that, but there comes a time where you just got
[03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:10.920]  to step forward and say, you know what, I may lose my job here, I may be reprimanded, but the right
[03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:13.960]  thing is to tell the truth. And a lot of those people that were saved that night, they get to see
[03:13:13.960 --> 03:13:18.600]  their families. And I expected more from them as well. A lot of those guys out there, they're still
[03:13:18.600 --> 03:13:23.880]  working that know what's going on and that aren't standing up and telling you the actual truth of
[03:13:23.880 --> 03:13:26.920]  what took place there that night. So you had to do the right thing when you were ordered to stand
[03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:32.680]  down repeatedly and go and fight the al-Qaeda trash and then do the moral right thing again
[03:13:32.680 --> 03:13:36.520]  and go out and speak out and say, no, we're being lied to. We were ordered to stand down.
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:44.440]  Yes, sir. And luckily, I was with a fantastic team that night and it carried over into today.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:49.560]  We stick together as a team. When this first went down, we continued to deploy, except for Oz.
[03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:53.480]  Oz had his arms severely injured so he couldn't deploy, but the rest of us continued to go overseas.
[03:13:53.480 --> 03:13:59.400]  After we were treated poorly for about eight months, we decided as a team, we voted on it.
[03:13:59.400 --> 03:14:03.960]  And if everybody voted yes, we're going to tell the truth. If any one of us voted no,
[03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:08.040]  we would not say anything. And all of us unanimously said, yes, we're going to tell the truth. So
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:13.080]  being able to stick together as a team has been able to embolden us to get out there and tell the
[03:14:13.080 --> 03:14:17.160]  truth. I honestly just think it's amazing that you guys end up having the courage to go out there
[03:14:17.160 --> 03:14:21.880]  and ignore the commands to stand down and go out there and finally fight and help those guys out.
[03:14:21.880 --> 03:14:26.280]  Because you guys were roughly, you got a call was like 9.47pm to stand down.
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:31.000]  And there's differences on that too. I swear, and I've still got my watch. The call that we got was
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:35.640]  9.32. I remember looking at my watch because I didn't want to get bothered. Joe, you know the
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:38.680]  deal at night. You know, you don't want to get bothered when it's almost night and you get called
[03:14:38.680 --> 03:14:44.040]  in the evening time. I looked at my watch 9.32. We're ready to go by 9.37. And we were told to
[03:14:44.040 --> 03:14:49.720]  wait, stand down, then wait again. I don't think it takes moral courage. I don't think it takes
[03:14:49.720 --> 03:14:53.560]  courage to do that. It takes the ability to sacrifice yourself. It takes the ability to
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:58.520]  give yourself for another human being. That's what it is. You guys were about a mile and a half away
[03:14:58.520 --> 03:15:04.760]  from the... Not even that far. Not even that far. So when you guys went in, when you guys decided to
[03:15:04.760 --> 03:15:09.640]  just go anyways, you guys drove some of the way, right? And then you went on foot. Yeah. And then
[03:15:09.640 --> 03:15:13.880]  you guys were encountering, you know, resistance through there. So tell me about that. That was,
[03:15:13.880 --> 03:15:17.240]  that's amazing. Yeah. I mean, this is a snapshot. People should read the book. They should see the
[03:15:17.240 --> 03:15:21.480]  film. I'll be honest. At first, I was like, they claim this is non-political. So it better tell the
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:24.840]  truth. I hadn't read the book. I didn't know it was based on this book. I just kind of, you know,
[03:15:24.840 --> 03:15:28.680]  was reading the news. It was all about the director and stuff. And then it came out and I finally went
[03:15:28.680 --> 03:15:33.240]  and saw it. And I was like, wow, this is accurate from, from, from what the witnesses said. Oh,
[03:15:33.240 --> 03:15:37.080]  it's based on one of the hero's books. Now I get it because I just don't trust Hollywood. And I
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:15:40.680]  don't get it because they bend over backwards for Hillary. 80% of the money in Hollywood has gone
[03:15:40.680 --> 03:15:46.200]  to Hillary. I'm really proud of this director. And I'm proud of the folks associated with it in
[03:15:46.200 --> 03:15:49.480]  Hollywood. I want to talk about that night briefly, but let's talk about some of the other heroes
[03:15:49.480 --> 03:15:53.320]  here, Chris, because they don't want credit, but to have a free press and a free media,
[03:15:53.320 --> 03:15:57.160]  we need to give credit to protect these people because these are the real Americans. Who are
[03:15:57.160 --> 03:16:01.800]  some of the other folks that help get this film out? Oh, you know, Michael Bay is outstanding.
[03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:06.680]  I, you know, he's the transfer. He's a transformer series, you know, Michael Bay Armageddon,
[03:16:06.680 --> 03:16:14.200]  Explosion and so forth. Yeah. He was perfect for this because people don't realize he is a huge
[03:16:14.200 --> 03:16:18.920]  veteran supporter. Huge. He uses veterans on all his, all his extras on his movie sets.
[03:16:20.120 --> 03:16:25.400]  Michael Bay is a hero because he's stuck his nut out there to do this. I just know he did.
[03:16:25.400 --> 03:16:29.560]  I haven't heard that. I bet he did too. But you know what? It's Michael Bay. What's he
[03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:34.760]  guaranteed? They asked you about some of our troops from El Paso for bliss to help out with the
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:37.880]  transformer. Well, well, we've only got about six, seven minutes left with our guests and jump
[03:16:37.880 --> 03:16:41.560]  in, Joe, because you're more of an expert than I am with Chris here. Chris Tanto.
[03:16:41.560 --> 03:16:48.200]  Tanto, uh, what is the best website for people to visit? Is it Chris Tanto, uh, Peranto?
[03:16:48.760 --> 03:16:53.480]  Yeah, that's it. Uh, the Chris Tanto, Peranto, Tanto, Peranto, you know, Alex, you're white. I
[03:16:53.480 --> 03:17:00.760]  know it's Tanto. It was T-O-N-T-O, brother. The reason I made it Tanto, a T-A-N-T-O, because
[03:17:00.760 --> 03:17:07.720]  I'm, I'm Mexican Spanish. If it's T-O-N-T-O, Tonto, that means fool. So, so let's say Tanto, no big
[03:17:07.720 --> 03:17:13.720]  deal. Chris Tanto, Peranto, T-A-N-T-O. So what is the right way to say it then? It's Tonto. Tonto,
[03:17:14.520 --> 03:17:17.560]  but you can say whatever you want. I want to know where the Lone Ranger is in all this.
[03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:22.760]  You guys were kind of the Lone Rangers that night, huh? Yeah, I was. I was actually the lone, the only
[03:17:22.760 --> 03:17:27.400]  Ranger on the team. There were two SEALs, three Marines, and I was the Lone Ranger. And of course,
[03:17:27.400 --> 03:17:31.240]  I held the Marines and the SEALs together that night. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All you SEALs
[03:17:31.240 --> 03:17:36.600]  and Rangers. Rangers lead the way. All the way, brother. But, but, uh, no, it was, it was a fantastic
[03:17:36.600 --> 03:17:40.840]  team. And, and Joe was right. The media doesn't tell you this. We stopped 400 meters short and had
[03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:44.920]  to fight our way on. It took us another 30 minutes. And how many hundreds of guys did you fight and
[03:17:44.920 --> 03:17:50.280]  kill? I mean, this is like an Alamo scenario, but you ended up almost a messy winner. Yeah, we, we,
[03:17:50.280 --> 03:17:53.960]  we did until they brought the mortars in, which we couldn't defend, which would have been nice to
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:58.760]  have the Air Force there to help us with that, which I know they were trying. We had any reports
[03:17:58.760 --> 03:18:05.560]  from 30 to 70. But we, we never got an official count because at that time Benghazi didn't happen.
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:10.280]  So that's any one time 30 to 70 because some of the reports I read, so that was wave after wave.
[03:18:10.280 --> 03:18:14.360]  Yeah. No, I knew it was. It was, I mean, there was five, if people want to take care of how many,
[03:18:14.360 --> 03:18:18.920]  actually count to how many firefights were in that night, two at the consulate and then three
[03:18:18.920 --> 03:18:23.400]  actually at our compound. So five firefights at night. So it, it varied from anywhere from
[03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:27.640]  I'm seeing 50 and we're seeing wave after wave. You're just, you're just, you're just shooting
[03:18:27.640 --> 03:18:30.600]  guys. That's what you're doing. You're just shooting them as they come and you're not even
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:34.200]  keeping count. That guy goes down, go the next guy. That guy goes down, go the next guy. It's
[03:18:34.200 --> 03:18:38.600]  like whack-a-mole. You're just whacking them and they're going down. So, but, but a body count,
[03:18:38.600 --> 03:18:42.760]  I'll be honest, we never got an official body count. We got an unofficial count of around 50
[03:18:42.760 --> 03:18:46.440]  is what the unofficial was from a local there that was in Libya that told us,
[03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:50.680]  he said the hospital was just full of bodies and that's all we got. We didn't know.
[03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:56.440]  Incredible. And now those very same type people that survived admit they've gone on to Syria
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:19:01.080]  to run around and slaughter everybody. What do you make of now seeing Obama and others
[03:19:01.080 --> 03:19:05.720]  trying to back ISIS, al-Qaeda groups, our own Pentagon leadership actually came out
[03:19:05.720 --> 03:19:09.480]  and said, we're not going to do this anymore. I was really proud of Chairman Dempsey and others
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:14.760]  at the time saying no. And now reportedly, even Sy Herson, the New York magazine's written about,
[03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:18.840]  I'm sure you've heard about it, that our own military quietly for the first time ever just said,
[03:19:19.720 --> 03:19:23.400]  I mean, it wasn't mutiny because Obama is mutiny against the country. They said,
[03:19:23.400 --> 03:19:28.360]  we're not backing ISIS and al-Qaeda. And why should, that's, that's the right thing to do.
[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:32.600]  It's, why do we back terrorists? And South Korea was a group that attacked us.
[03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:35.160]  We're going to skip this break. We only got a few minutes left here with our guests.
[03:19:35.160 --> 03:19:40.120]  Yeah, yeah, no. Chris, I know you got to go other points that are important to get out to people.
[03:19:41.960 --> 03:19:45.560]  We need to start sticking together, holding our politicians accountable, leading from the
[03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:50.120]  fronts that are leading from behind. That's what we've been doing. We've got to go and destroy
[03:19:50.120 --> 03:19:54.280]  terrorism. We can't, we can't play around with it anymore. Stop giving money to these countries
[03:19:54.280 --> 03:19:58.520]  of sponsored terrorism. Go in there, get the troops, you got seals, you got Rangers, you got Delta,
[03:19:58.520 --> 03:20:02.040]  you got SF, you got all these warriors out there that want to go and bring the hammer,
[03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:06.440]  and you have to do that. If we don't, we're going to be fighting it on our home front.
[03:20:06.440 --> 03:20:10.360]  We already are. And it's just going to get worse. Let me ask you that question because you got
[03:20:10.360 --> 03:20:17.080]  interrupted there by that break. I just canceled. Sure. Again, Chris Tonto, peronto.com is the
[03:20:17.080 --> 03:20:21.400]  website, the book 13 hours. Everyone should read it. I haven't read the book yet, but my friend
[03:20:21.400 --> 03:20:25.080]  has. I've got a copy now. They said there's even more in the book that isn't in the film. Is that
[03:20:25.080 --> 03:20:29.320]  accurate? Oh, yeah, that's, I mean, we have 13 hours in the book. It has everybody on the
[03:20:29.320 --> 03:20:34.040]  team's perspective except for Todd, because he passed away that night. You know, getting two
[03:20:34.040 --> 03:20:38.680]  hour, 13 hours in a two hour movie, you have to condense things. So the movie did great,
[03:20:38.680 --> 03:20:43.160]  getting as much as it could into it. But the book is, the book is exactly what took place
[03:20:43.160 --> 03:20:47.480]  tonight from everybody's perspective, because the whole team were authors of that book.
[03:20:47.480 --> 03:20:52.520]  Incredible. Absolutely amazing. Specifically getting back to our Pentagon.
[03:20:52.520 --> 03:20:56.680]  Again, Yorker magazine confirmed what Colonel Shaver told us four years ago when it all first
[03:20:56.680 --> 03:21:00.920]  happened. The Pentagon at that point said, that's it. You've gone too far. We're not going to back
[03:21:00.920 --> 03:21:05.720]  shipping these people into Syria. This is out of control. And now it's with the State Department
[03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:11.080]  and NATO kind of running it from behind the scenes with an internal, really, I'd call it a civil war.
[03:21:11.080 --> 03:21:16.120]  What can you say that isn't classified about that? What the sense is of the former operators
[03:21:16.120 --> 03:21:21.640]  for the contractors and people currently in, sir? You know, as far as as far as Syria goes,
[03:21:22.360 --> 03:21:26.280]  that country, we shouldn't have went in there and tried to overthrow Assad to begin with.
[03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:30.840]  We've done that with Gaddafi. We've done that with Assad. We're trying to do that with Assad.
[03:21:30.840 --> 03:21:35.320]  And we've turned these areas into terrorist training grounds backing ISIS. Are you kidding
[03:21:35.320 --> 03:21:39.320]  me? It's a terrorist organization. Why in the earth would we, that's like backing al-Qaeda,
[03:21:39.320 --> 03:21:47.080]  backing Al-Zikari when we were in Iraq, that you go and you destroy these groups, backing them? We're
[03:21:47.080 --> 03:21:51.320]  terrorists. I mean, am I confused here, I guess? I think by the definition of terrorism, if we're
[03:21:51.320 --> 03:21:57.640]  backing terrorist activities, and are we terrorists now? People need to wake the heck up and realize
[03:21:57.640 --> 03:22:03.000]  what's going on here. We are a country of freedom. We're a country of strength. We are not a country
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:08.120]  of slaughtering Christians. We're not a country that go and indiscriminately slaughter children.
[03:22:08.120 --> 03:22:12.600]  It doesn't happen. Terrorists do. We need to step back and realize what the heck's going on here
[03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:18.520]  and wake up soon. I'm very scared for a country, but they're great people like you and Joe and
[03:22:18.520 --> 03:22:23.560]  like myself, there's people, we've got warriors everywhere in the United States who are ready
[03:22:23.560 --> 03:22:27.320]  to step up. Totally. Well, I mean, look, your courage or your team's courage to folks that,
[03:22:27.320 --> 03:22:31.480]  you know, put the book out, the film, this is now brought to a head. Joe, I don't see how
[03:22:31.480 --> 03:22:35.400]  Hillary survives this. That's why even her own party's saying we might want to pull her back,
[03:22:35.400 --> 03:22:41.960]  but then we've got Bernie Sanders. I mean, any points on that? I watch military movies all the
[03:22:41.960 --> 03:22:47.560]  time and I leave out of the theater angry because it was done so horribly. I left out of this movie
[03:22:47.560 --> 03:22:52.120]  angry because it was done right and I was angry for the right reasons that our men and women
[03:22:52.120 --> 03:22:57.160]  get left. They get screwed over by our government when they swear and oath to uphold the Constitution
[03:22:57.160 --> 03:23:01.000]  and defend it against enemies foreign and domestic. And then they go out and they're putting their
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:05.560]  lives on the line and they get screwed over like that when there were clearly air assets that could
[03:23:05.560 --> 03:23:09.720]  have been there to help you guys out. There would have been hardly any loss of life, more loss of
[03:23:09.720 --> 03:23:15.720]  life on the bad side. And here we are. You know, I'm just thankful you're one of my heroes, man,
[03:23:15.720 --> 03:23:19.960]  to be able to sit here and talk to you right now. I don't even know what to say right now.
[03:23:20.600 --> 03:23:23.960]  It is amazing. Well, listen, Chris, I hope you'll come back again in the future. What other
[03:23:23.960 --> 03:23:29.880]  projects are you working on right now? Well, right now, actually, I'm a public speaker and I speak
[03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:36.440]  Daniel everywhere. I'm five, four or five times a week in different states. Possibly. And I don't
[03:23:36.440 --> 03:23:39.720]  know if I will or not, but I've been asked to possibly write my own book. I don't know if people
[03:23:39.720 --> 03:23:46.200]  want to know about me. I'm not that special. But if that goes on, if not, brother, just live in the
[03:23:46.200 --> 03:23:52.600]  living and fight in a good fight. That's all I can do. We ought to bring him to Austin. I would
[03:23:52.600 --> 03:23:57.480]  love to come back. Did you lose your security clearance over that? No, no, I don't not as far as
[03:23:57.480 --> 03:24:02.040]  I knew. I don't, but we were told that when we said, when you guys do the book, you cannot work
[03:24:02.040 --> 03:24:07.480]  with us anymore. With being us was the agency. That's a good question, Joe. If I did, I didn't get
[03:24:07.480 --> 03:24:13.800]  a letter. Let me ask you that question. The CIA saying stand down. You could be in harm's way.
[03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:17.720]  And they say stand down again. I mean, do you think that's reflective of your experience?
[03:24:17.720 --> 03:24:23.320]  Or was this a one time deal? I mean, it's pretty cold blooded. You know, when I first started,
[03:24:23.320 --> 03:24:29.080]  no, I, we had, I had some outstanding chiefs of bases outstanding chiefs of station as it continued
[03:24:29.080 --> 03:24:34.200]  on. And it, it's not a coincidence that it coincided with being eight years ago when it
[03:24:34.200 --> 03:24:38.680]  started to get a little bit more politically correct, a little bit more wishy washy, a little bit
[03:24:38.680 --> 03:24:43.080]  more, let's not offend the locals into, hey, we got to take care of our own people. That's not a
[03:24:43.080 --> 03:24:48.760]  coincidence. So nowadays, I, and again, I've been out now for two, two years, three years. I haven't
[03:24:48.760 --> 03:24:54.120]  deployed because of everything that went on. So, but I do remember it getting a little bit more
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:59.560]  touchy-feely and hands off and not more of dropping the hammer when I first started. So
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:05.400]  I would say is this typical now? Probably, but since I'm not deploying, I haven't deployed for
[03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:10.200]  the last two years. I can't say with 100% certainty. Well, definitely have to go shooting. Get you
[03:25:10.200 --> 03:25:14.440]  out here, Rodino. No, I'm sure. Well, listening and closing, we really appreciate your work.
[03:25:14.440 --> 03:25:18.280]  Everybody should see the film. They should also read the book. Once you leave here, though,
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:21.800]  you're going to think back and say, oh, I should have said this. Any other points that are important
[03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:27.320]  for folks? Yeah, you know, I honestly, I've said my piece at this point, Alex, if there's something
[03:25:27.320 --> 03:25:30.840]  else, believe me, I'll get in touch with you and I hope you'll have me back on the show and just,
[03:25:30.840 --> 03:25:35.400]  you know, God bless you all and, you know, keep that in your life. Keep that faith. We can, we can
[03:25:35.400 --> 03:25:39.560]  win this. We can get it back to where, what I knew us when I was growing up, which was patriotism,
[03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:44.360]  which was respect and sir, man's are still being told, said, and people were still open doors for
[03:25:44.360 --> 03:25:47.720]  each other. Absolutely. Let's get down the criminals in our government. This could really
[03:25:47.720 --> 03:25:51.560]  take the Republic back. I think, I mean, there's something really special about Benghazi. It's
[03:25:51.560 --> 03:25:56.520]  a horrible tragedy. We all see the best in people at the same time. It's really amazing. Chris,
[03:25:56.520 --> 03:26:01.080]  God bless you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. All right. Well, that was a
[03:26:01.080 --> 03:26:04.200]  powerful interview and you're right. I mean, I mean, just the words to describe, you see the
[03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:09.320]  worst in people with the globalists and Hillary and Obama and the scum, they're caught with their
[03:26:09.320 --> 03:26:16.760]  pants down, Joe, nakedly in front of everybody. And then now they try to suppress it, but it didn't
[03:26:16.760 --> 03:26:22.120]  work. Yeah, there's a great awakening going on. And I'm just glad people are standing up in the
[03:26:22.120 --> 03:26:27.400]  military and coming out and talking about this stuff. I mean, like the Navy Silla I interviewed
[03:26:27.400 --> 03:26:33.160]  the other day, Carl Higbee, he actually went on Fox and friends and was talking about the corruption
[03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:40.920]  within the administration, Obama's administration. And as he was getting out, they contact him said,
[03:26:40.920 --> 03:26:44.200]  oh, we're going to not give you an honorable discharge. It's going to be an other than honorable
[03:26:44.200 --> 03:26:49.240]  now because he came forward and started speaking about the atrocities going on. And notice Megan
[03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:53.640]  Kelly, she's going, oh, it was an accident. I see they didn't know why they ordered to stand out.
[03:26:53.640 --> 03:26:57.320]  And he goes, no, it was on purpose. That's the same guy, right? No, no, this is a different one.
[03:26:57.320 --> 03:27:01.960]  This is the guy that was the, uh, the guy that took in the butcher of Fallujah, the bad guy.
[03:27:04.360 --> 03:27:08.200]  So that was a bad guy that Chris Kyle was going after an American sniper. That's who Carl Higbee
[03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:11.960]  actually was. So they just persecuted all these guys. Yeah. Well, what about the other seals
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:15.640]  that were on the show? You're talking about how no, no, this isn't by accident. This was done on
[03:27:15.640 --> 03:27:19.960]  purpose. Yeah. And those guys, some people, like you said, like Chris said, some people are going
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:24.200]  to stay in the system and they're going to sit there and live with that lie just so they can
[03:27:24.200 --> 03:27:28.920]  make money just so they can continue on. I want to warn those people because I've talked to a lot
[03:27:28.920 --> 03:27:34.280]  of folks, uh, who were, you know, in special ops back when it wasn't as large as it is. I mean,
[03:27:34.280 --> 03:27:38.200]  quite frankly, the older special ops will say these are even better special ops now because
[03:27:38.200 --> 03:27:43.240]  they see so much combat, so much action. This is like superhero stuff now, what they do. But back
[03:27:43.240 --> 03:27:48.920]  in the day, it was almost more, you know, cloaking dagger spy stuff still is, but that Green Berets
[03:27:48.920 --> 03:27:54.360]  and Navy seals and other special ops guys have done a bunch of dirty work. They're 30, 40, 50
[03:27:54.360 --> 03:27:58.680]  years old. They send somebody to kill you. Well, folks need to know you listen, even if you serve
[03:27:58.680 --> 03:28:05.400]  them and do dirty stuff, they put you in that file, they come and they kill you. Okay. And you need
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:11.240]  to understand they do it. And so the only way I found to be safe from researching all this is to
[03:28:11.240 --> 03:28:16.280]  speak out and expose it so there aren't any secrets. So they have a reason to kill you, Joe.
[03:28:16.280 --> 03:28:20.200]  Well, I'm scared for our special forces community right now, quite frankly, because
[03:28:20.920 --> 03:28:26.120]  right now we have a lowering of standards that is happening under the Obama administration. We
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:31.240]  have women being allowed to come into combat. We have women taking over combat leadership positions
[03:28:31.240 --> 03:28:36.840]  and Ranger battalions. We have three seals who have just died in training. What's going to happen?
[03:28:36.840 --> 03:28:41.880]  We have these people in these high level positions that are so politically correct. I'm in fear of
[03:28:41.880 --> 03:28:45.880]  the fact that they're going to lower the standard of buds for seal training to become a Navy.
[03:28:45.880 --> 03:28:50.440]  They're already saying they want to. And if they do that, what happens to our tier one operators?
[03:28:50.440 --> 03:28:54.440]  What's going to happen when you go into combat with an already team that's been with the older
[03:28:54.440 --> 03:28:59.240]  way of doing it the right way and you start bringing in ushering in some of these drop standard
[03:28:59.240 --> 03:29:03.160]  people? You're going to have more loss of life. We're going to look like more soldiers walking
[03:29:03.160 --> 03:29:07.240]  around in high hills. I'm scared for the future. It's all meant to destroy the country, Joe. People
[03:29:07.240 --> 03:29:12.200]  keep saying this is destroying us, shutting off our power plants, telling us moms and dads are bad.
[03:29:12.200 --> 03:29:17.240]  Yes, they're trying to sabotage us. We're being destroyed. It's a globalist program.
[03:29:17.240 --> 03:29:20.600]  David Knight's coming up. I want you and I to hand the baton to David here,
[03:29:21.320 --> 03:29:26.840]  hosting the fourth hour. And I really want to appreciate you getting Chris on the program.
[03:29:26.840 --> 03:29:30.520]  He seems like a really neat guy. Oh, yeah. Amazing guys. Really good friends with some of my
[03:29:30.520 --> 03:29:34.520]  buddies here that I shoot with. Absolutely. You know, I was talking to Tim Kennedy when he
[03:29:34.520 --> 03:29:38.280]  went and saw that film and he said it was so realistic from what he's seen, what his experience
[03:29:38.280 --> 03:29:43.480]  that it just he couldn't sleep that night. Yeah, I was absolutely horrible. And just to think that
[03:29:43.480 --> 03:29:48.040]  this all went on and they stood down in front of all the drone footage. The military all knows
[03:29:48.040 --> 03:29:54.920]  this. What really happened? We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN

[03:33:16.680 --> 03:33:23.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Sometimes people take screenshots of me doing my
[03:33:23.960 --> 03:33:29.400]  fist. Look, he's a communist. The clench fist is the oldest form of the symbol of resistance.
[03:33:29.400 --> 03:33:33.560]  Why the communists get to like expropriate it for themselves. I have no idea. It's not yours.
[03:33:34.200 --> 03:33:38.520]  It's like Hitler expropriating the fascist salute. That's like a Roman deal. You know,
[03:33:38.520 --> 03:33:41.960]  like Native Americans have the swastika now it can't be used because you know Hitler's got it.
[03:33:43.320 --> 03:33:47.320]  It's all political correctness. But Joe Biggs is here. I'm finishing up. We're about to go to
[03:33:47.320 --> 03:33:51.160]  David Knight who did a great job hosting for me Tuesday when I had some family issues come up.
[03:33:51.160 --> 03:33:57.960]  And then I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time. But I got a bunch of clips
[03:33:57.960 --> 03:34:03.240]  there I didn't get to that I need to play. I mean Clinton laughs at her introducer when the woman
[03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:09.560]  goes one nation under and she self-censors everybody laughs. This is a cult. This is mind
[03:34:09.560 --> 03:34:15.240]  control. And then she laughs approvingly and we've got the other mind control cult,
[03:34:15.960 --> 03:34:20.360]  you know, saying that Trump on Fox and Friends, we have a president that won't acknowledge the
[03:34:20.360 --> 03:34:27.480]  term radical Islam. This is how they literally try to manipulate people into not having free
[03:34:27.480 --> 03:34:33.080]  speech. Here's another one. Stephen Hayes calls Trump orange guy. So that's making fun of Gengers
[03:34:33.080 --> 03:34:39.400]  who wants to ban a religion Islam. No, Islam wants to ban everybody else's religion. So again,
[03:34:39.400 --> 03:34:44.840]  they just keep inverting reality. And I have the left running around saying I'm Islamophobic.
[03:34:44.840 --> 03:34:50.920]  Well, I'm not Islamophobic against the Muslims. I know that don't make their wives or daughters wear
[03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:57.240]  beatkeeper suits. And I'm sorry, folks, a flower sack over your head. They beat the women. They
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:35:03.080]  kill them if they don't do it. They make them do it. That's slavery. Got it? People go if a woman
[03:35:03.080 --> 03:35:07.800]  like Huffington Post yesterday, it's so beautiful. A lot of non-Muslims are wearing headdresses and
[03:35:07.800 --> 03:35:12.920]  had jobs and he's just show solidarity. It's like I'm gonna go wear a chain around my neck and go
[03:35:12.920 --> 03:35:19.000]  we should bring back black slavery, a solidarity. Joe Biggs, David Knight, jump in. I don't get it.
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:23.080]  I mean, I think it's completely ridiculous. I mean, we're racist for not wanting
[03:35:24.680 --> 03:35:30.520]  Sharia law in our country. We're racist because we don't want, you know, our women to be harassed
[03:35:30.520 --> 03:35:34.840]  because of the way we dress in our culture. They're not your women. They belong to the jihad.
[03:35:35.720 --> 03:35:40.200]  You know, I've told the story before, I've seen women who've gone to the United Arab Emirates
[03:35:40.200 --> 03:35:44.840]  and they will dress conservatively, not showing their legs, you know, you know, blouse that covers
[03:35:44.840 --> 03:35:49.800]  everything up and try to, you know, adhere to their culture. But then when they go back home
[03:35:49.800 --> 03:35:55.880]  into London or wherever, they're spit on, caught a whore, whatever it may be, by these Arabs in
[03:35:55.880 --> 03:36:01.640]  those areas who've moved into these places that actually exist or no-go zones. And it's ridiculous.
[03:36:01.640 --> 03:36:06.600]  But we're racist or we're Islamophobic if we don't want that Sharia law in our country.
[03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:10.360]  Well, look, here's the deal. There's a lot of women hating going on over there.
[03:36:10.360 --> 03:36:15.560]  And I love the spoiled rotten, not all women, but spoiled rotten liberal women over here that
[03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:19.880]  just, they know it's safe and that Western men are wimps and it'll put up with being put down.
[03:36:19.880 --> 03:36:26.760]  They, they kiss the butt of any really radical, you know, third world thing. Let's go ahead and
[03:36:26.760 --> 03:36:30.440]  they have a nice take on this, David. Well, you know, Alex, you're talking about these videos
[03:36:30.440 --> 03:36:35.160]  where we've got the clip of the lady who self-censors because she almost says the word God and
[03:36:35.160 --> 03:36:39.560]  the pledge and she's got to pull that back. They can't say radical Islam. But at the same time,
[03:36:39.560 --> 03:36:45.640]  we've now had Obama today do potty all over the United States telling us how we're going to go
[03:36:45.640 --> 03:36:50.120]  to the bathroom. I mean, this is- Excuse me, I missed this new breaking stuff. He told us we
[03:36:50.120 --> 03:36:54.520]  had a peepee? Yeah, yeah, we're going to be told how we're going to have to go to the bathroom,
[03:36:54.520 --> 03:36:58.760]  how our bathrooms are going to operate, what they're doing to- Oh, you've been going after,
[03:36:58.760 --> 03:37:01.960]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Really it's about teaching kids about transgender. It's about
[03:37:01.960 --> 03:37:06.600]  making school all about obsessing over potty time. It's a total mental illness weapon.
[03:37:06.600 --> 03:37:11.240]  Yeah, this is something people need to understand that this has been, the Department of Education
[03:37:11.240 --> 03:37:17.960]  has been about social control. This is a brave new world, Plato's Republic type of social control,
[03:37:17.960 --> 03:37:21.560]  social engineering that's been going on for quite some time. That's the purpose of it.
[03:37:21.560 --> 03:37:25.960]  They get you hooked on the money and then they say, well, we're going to pull the money if you
[03:37:25.960 --> 03:37:30.600]  don't do exactly what we've said. And then- And first it's Michelle's going to tell you what you
[03:37:30.600 --> 03:37:34.600]  eat. We'll find you if you don't. Well, that's not cult-like. Now we're going to teach your five-year
[03:37:34.600 --> 03:37:40.360]  olds about their sexuality. Oh, that's called pedophilia. I mean, what's coming next, David?
[03:37:40.360 --> 03:37:44.760]  What do you guys predict next? Well, actually, Alex, we had a very strong statement today from
[03:37:44.760 --> 03:37:50.360]  Lieutenant Governor here in Texas who came out and said, they said they're going to pull money
[03:37:50.360 --> 03:37:57.160]  from us if we don't have single sex bathrooms and single sex showers and stuff. Fine, do it.
[03:37:57.160 --> 03:38:01.240]  We're not going to be blackmailed. And he says, you have to understand that the money that we're
[03:38:01.240 --> 03:38:05.640]  getting from the federal government, most of that is going to the lunch program. So not only
[03:38:05.640 --> 03:38:09.720]  are you going to- Take the food away from the- Take the Michelle rotten prison food. Yeah. Good.
[03:38:09.720 --> 03:38:13.720]  Who needs that stuff? Anyways, we should all have an emergency community fund to have real
[03:38:13.720 --> 03:38:17.160]  lunches and stuff for the poor kids and make a whole stunt out of it and show the luscious,
[03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:21.720]  delicious food next to the rat-filled, dropping garbage. That was one of my favorite articles
[03:38:21.720 --> 03:38:26.920]  that Kit Daniels did. He had the pictures of all the different- The meals from these high schools
[03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:31.320]  and middle schools or whatever. People were treating up Michelle's food and just like horrible
[03:38:31.320 --> 03:38:36.760]  prison food like- And it's full of rat droppings. Yeah. Moldy bread. I mean, what the- Because
[03:38:36.760 --> 03:38:41.000]  it's all a joke for their insiders. Like their energy deals are giving tens of billions a month
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:45.400]  to a few select globalist companies to build magic windmills that don't even work. I mean,
[03:38:45.400 --> 03:38:50.440]  it's scam after scam after scam. David, I'm going to hand the baton to you, my friend. And I want
[03:38:50.440 --> 03:38:53.960]  to invite you this Sunday. If you'd like to come in and co-host with me because today you kind of
[03:38:53.960 --> 03:38:58.200]  got cut short on the Sunday broadcast that you kind of have a roundtable discussion. Sure. Sunday
[03:38:58.200 --> 03:39:02.280]  four to six. You want to do it? Sure. Oh, yeah. Fantastic. We'll do it. And bigs, you can come
[03:39:02.280 --> 03:39:07.560]  in too. But you know, that guest snuck up on me. I forgot I had that guest and then all of a sudden
[03:39:07.560 --> 03:39:11.000]  they're like, the guest is ready to go. And they're like, I'm like, where's bigs? I forgot because
[03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:15.000]  he usually comes on like five after. And then I'm like, get bigs in here. No, don't get bigs in here.
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:18.760]  But he got in here. He did a great job interviewing that guy. What an amazing interview. I want to
[03:39:18.760 --> 03:39:22.360]  get your take on that. And then I'm going to hand the baton to David Knight. But briefly,
[03:39:22.360 --> 03:39:26.680]  I didn't even really plug in the third hour. I'm supposed to plug twice an hour
[03:39:26.680 --> 03:39:31.640]  for the sponsors we have in our own products. And instead I plug like once an hour and then
[03:39:31.640 --> 03:39:35.800]  skip breaks. It's out of control. Then I complain about having money to go to Bilderberg or money
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:39.160]  to cover this or that. The truth is, it takes a lot of money around this operation. We sell the
[03:39:39.160 --> 03:39:45.080]  very best products that are out there. It ends this Sunday. We already had all the food 30 to 40
[03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:49.880]  percent off. Now it's the four top best sellers of high quality swarable food with all the things
[03:39:49.880 --> 03:39:54.920]  happening in the world. It lasts 25 years. This is the food I've chosen for my family. It's excellent.

[03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:03.560]  spectrum of My Patriot Supply and infowarsstore.com at the lowest prices. They have new specials every

[03:40:08.280 --> 03:40:13.160]  food is contained in these high quality plastic sealed tote containers and then sealed within
[03:40:13.160 --> 03:40:18.200]  packages and cans within is the very best you're going to find out there. It really is a great
[03:40:18.200 --> 03:40:23.080]  deal. And they want us dependent. Now is the time to get self-sufficient. And even if you're
[03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:27.000]  self-sufficient for yourself, it's good to have some backup food to help friends and family.
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:33.000]  It has a 4.8 star review. Thousands and thousands of reviews are 5.0 on the site.
[03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:40.280]  But it's on average 4.8. Third party power reviews. We also have vitamin mineral fusion

[03:40:52.520 --> 03:40:56.440]  weight again, you know, not wanting orange juice or the sugar drinks, but still getting my vitamins
[03:40:56.440 --> 03:41:02.440]  drinking this. It is so good. Folks love it. Try a container rather. It's concentrated.

[03:41:40.920 --> 03:41:45.240]  really helped us promote the Hillary for prison shirts. The originals sold out because it was
[03:41:45.240 --> 03:41:50.040]  limited edition. We have a new one that's very similar. That's very popular. And Joe, it's crazy.
[03:41:50.040 --> 03:41:54.040]  You've gone all over the country now. It's gone from one in 20 people with a Hillary for prison
[03:41:54.040 --> 03:42:00.280]  to like one in 10 now, one in five. Trump's freaking out. We're showing how many info warriors there
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:05.560]  are. And the little profit we make off each shirt is absolutely essential. Put together
[03:42:05.560 --> 03:42:11.240]  it becomes a large profit to be able to fund this operation. So great job, folks. A brief
[03:42:11.240 --> 03:42:16.040]  comment on the Hillary for prison shirts. Well, I actually started a trending Twitter topic last
[03:42:16.040 --> 03:42:20.440]  night, handcuff Hillary. And people were sending me all their pictures of themselves wearing the
[03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:24.040]  Hillary for prison t-shirt. And I saved them on my phone and they started tweeting them out with
[03:42:24.040 --> 03:42:29.160]  handcuff Hillary. Oh, I forgot. Yeah, yeah. Tell folks about that hashtag, how we tweeted, how we
[03:42:29.160 --> 03:42:34.600]  Facebook. To hashtag it, go to Twitter, handcuff Hillary, capital H, capital C, and then capital
[03:42:34.600 --> 03:42:38.680]  H for Hillary as well. You do that on Facebook. You can use it on Instagram, anything like that.
[03:42:38.680 --> 03:42:42.920]  And put on your Hillary for prison t-shirt. Let us see it. Let everyone know because, you know,
[03:42:42.920 --> 03:42:45.800]  people that work for Hillary, they're watching that, they're seeing that and they're telling
[03:42:45.800 --> 03:42:49.000]  her about it. And they're going to see everyone in America, all the people that wear this shirt and
[03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:53.160]  support us. And that's just going to piss her off even more, which makes me happy a little bit more
[03:42:53.160 --> 03:42:57.800]  inside. Absolutely. And again, we've tweeted that at real Alex Shones and when everybody to
[03:42:57.800 --> 03:43:02.760]  retweet it, it is so important to get that information out. All right, great job, Joe Biggs.
[03:43:02.760 --> 03:43:05.560]  Thank you, sir. And I guess if you want to come in this Sunday, you're probably hunting or something.
[03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:09.720]  Are you going to join us this Sunday? Yeah, I'm done. All right, four to six p.m. David Knight,
[03:43:09.720 --> 03:43:14.360]  I'll be hosting with us in the first hour and the second hour. And so I just tricked you both
[03:43:14.360 --> 03:43:22.120]  into giving me a Sunday vacation. No, actually, actually, I want to come in on Sunday. And then
[03:43:22.760 --> 03:43:28.280]  some family stuff came up where it was going to be very hard for me to get here by three o'clock
[03:43:28.280 --> 03:43:32.760]  to get ready. So what I'll now do is let David Knight and you get ready and I'll show up and mail
[03:43:32.760 --> 03:43:36.440]  it in. But not because I don't want to be here. I mean, I'll be up here like it's Saturday night
[03:43:36.440 --> 03:43:40.680]  and I catch you up here working to the problem is workaholic behavior, but I've got to spend time
[03:43:40.680 --> 03:43:45.960]  with my kids. And so does David. And you need some kids, bigs. Negative. You need five. My kids
[03:43:45.960 --> 03:43:53.240]  are Chris Vector, Glock 19, my Glock 45 ACP. Those are my babies. That's where I cuddle with them
[03:43:53.240 --> 03:43:57.000]  every night, clean them, make sure they're good, give them baths. That way they work for me when
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:00.360]  I need them. This is my rifle. This is my gun. This is for fighting. This is for fun. Yeah,
[03:44:00.360 --> 03:44:07.080]  I like the fun part more. Exactly. All right. David Knight, you take over, my friend. Thank
[03:44:07.080 --> 03:44:11.560]  you. What a power pack transmission. That's how I'm going to leave it. What did you think of
[03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:16.760]  that amazing Army Ranger assigned to the CIA? Other people were Marines and SEALs that night
[03:44:16.760 --> 03:44:20.920]  that took on hundreds. So those guys always want to dial it back. I'll have like famous Navy SEALs
[03:44:20.920 --> 03:44:25.320]  on. They go, I was in the Navy SEALs and in Beirut and some stuff. But I'm nothing compared to the
[03:44:25.320 --> 03:44:29.960]  new people. And I almost don't want to be called to SEAL. I'm not going to steal glory. And then
[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:34.440]  that guy's like, now I really didn't do anything. And there shouldn't be a book about me. And it
[03:44:34.440 --> 03:44:39.240]  was only 50 to 70 at a time. And I just forget how many I shot. But yeah, I was every few seconds,
[03:44:39.240 --> 03:44:43.880]  I shot one. But let's just say we only killed 50 and we only fought 70. But then a lot of the
[03:44:43.880 --> 03:44:47.880]  numbers are like 400 guys they were fighting. We need more people like that though. No, but I
[03:44:47.880 --> 03:44:52.680]  know. But at a certain point almost becomes so humble that you don't even get what happened
[03:44:52.680 --> 03:44:56.280]  because they're just like not talking about it. But I mean, how many do you think they really
[03:44:56.280 --> 03:45:01.320]  fought there? I mean, like you said, probably conservatively 50 to 70 at a time per wave.
[03:45:01.320 --> 03:45:05.800]  So I'm assuming, you know, in the hundreds overall, well, there were guys in Korea platoons
[03:45:05.800 --> 03:45:10.360]  that fought like a thousand people. Yeah. So can you imagine that? I mean, my dad told me some
[03:45:10.360 --> 03:45:14.840]  stories from Nam that just blew my mind that things that made me scared to even want to join
[03:45:14.840 --> 03:45:19.000]  the military. But then I just felt like it was my duty, especially when 9 11 happened. Well,
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:24.440]  they had like basically untrained Chinese trips with a million man wave attacks. And then you'd
[03:45:24.440 --> 03:45:29.960]  have like 10,000 army, a couple thousand Marines. And it was just like dead bodies, like in the
[03:45:29.960 --> 03:45:35.160]  movie 300, you know, where it's originally piled up like 160 feet or whatever. There were bodies
[03:45:35.160 --> 03:45:40.040]  piled 20, 30 feet tall that they were then using as their new hills to shoot over. Yeah. I mean,
[03:45:40.040 --> 03:45:44.440]  until the and the barrels are melting off. Anyways, we need to put women in front of combat.
[03:45:44.440 --> 03:45:49.240]  That's the answer. Seriously, go ahead and take over my friend. Thank you so much, David Knight.
[03:45:49.240 --> 03:45:53.160]  Thank you, Alex. You know, one of the things that I would be interested to hear from him
[03:45:53.160 --> 03:45:59.160]  because he he does a lot of public speaking and he's got a list of public speaking that
[03:45:59.160 --> 03:46:03.800]  topics that he approaches. That's Chris Peranto. One of the things I'd like to hear him talk about
[03:46:03.800 --> 03:46:10.120]  is his internal battle that he fought because he had and you see this in the movie 13 hours for
[03:46:10.120 --> 03:46:15.320]  very long time. They're being told they can't go help people. They have to stand down. And they have
[03:46:15.320 --> 03:46:21.080]  this internal conflict that he talks about how he's been trained to follow orders because you
[03:46:21.080 --> 03:46:27.080]  can't second guess the chain of command. And yet he has these internal moral beliefs as Christian
[03:46:27.080 --> 03:46:32.680]  beliefs that tell him that he has to go save innocent lives. And so that is a key part of the
[03:46:32.680 --> 03:46:36.600]  movie, I think. And that's a very important part of the movie. And he does go out and talk about
[03:46:36.600 --> 03:46:41.800]  God and combat. I really respect that. This is a guy who is highly principled. We heard that when
[03:46:41.800 --> 03:46:48.520]  he talked about how a lot of people put their continuing employment above talking about how
[03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:52.440]  others were betrayed and died. And we're all going to have those moral choices more and more in our
[03:46:52.440 --> 03:46:57.640]  lives when they tell us take a chip or you can't buy or sell. I mean, it's coming down. That's right.
[03:46:57.640 --> 03:47:01.400]  Exactly. The internal battle and that's why he goes out and he talks to people on the speakers
[03:47:01.400 --> 03:47:06.520]  there. That internal battle that he has, we all have on multiple issues all the time. And it's
[03:47:06.520 --> 03:47:10.840]  going to get much worse, Alex, as we go along. That's a key issue. And that's why talking to him
[03:47:10.840 --> 03:47:15.240]  about that would be very, very important because not all of us are going to be in a combat situation.
[03:47:15.240 --> 03:47:18.360]  I'm never, well, I don't know what's going to happen in the United States. We're going to go
[03:47:18.360 --> 03:47:22.120]  watch America again tonight. I don't know what's going to happen in the future. But look, most of
[03:47:22.120 --> 03:47:25.960]  us are not going to be in a combat situation. That's right. I should have plugged that here.
[03:47:25.960 --> 03:47:30.280]  I'm saying I'm leaving and I won't shut up because there's a big Dallas showing a bunch of other
[03:47:30.280 --> 03:47:33.640]  showings. Tell us where you're going to be to watch America again tonight, David.
[03:47:33.640 --> 03:47:37.960]  I'm going to be at the theater of the Regal in Austin. I'm going to be there at the 7 o'clock
[03:47:37.960 --> 03:47:40.600]  show. I'm going to watch that. And I think you're going to introduce it, aren't you?
[03:47:40.600 --> 03:47:45.400]  No, no, we're going to shoot a report. We're going to do a review afterwards. We'll probably
[03:47:45.400 --> 03:47:48.520]  talk to some people. And then we're sitting and crew up to the red carpet deal in Dallas.
[03:47:50.200 --> 03:47:53.320]  Leigh-Anne Macken is going up there. So I'm going to turn it over to you. Go ahead.
[03:47:53.320 --> 03:47:58.520]  Okay. All right. Well, as I mentioned before, we're talking about what Obama has taken upon
[03:47:58.520 --> 03:48:03.960]  himself today. And I think this is time for people to wake up. The old analogy of the boiling
[03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:08.280]  frogs in the water, you gradually turn up the heat. At some point, they realize that they're
[03:48:08.280 --> 03:48:15.080]  being cooked. What is it going to take for Americans to realize that they are being cooked,
[03:48:15.080 --> 03:48:20.680]  that they are sacrificing in social engineering, our families, our children,
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:25.960]  now with what we're seeing here with these bathrooms, this is just one aspect of it.
[03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:30.120]  And of course, it's a constitutional issue as well. Are you going to realize that you're being
[03:48:30.120 --> 03:48:35.480]  cooked by this government that constantly takes on these different issues? And I see people
[03:48:35.480 --> 03:48:38.760]  been holding on here. So I don't want to go too long on this. I do want to get to
[03:48:39.400 --> 03:48:42.120]  Erin, hang on there. I'm going to try to get to some of the other callers I see you've been
[03:48:42.120 --> 03:48:46.600]  hanging on for a very long time. But I just real quickly want to mention what's going on with this.
[03:48:46.600 --> 03:48:50.920]  Now, today, in case you haven't seen yet, there's a lot of news about this today.
[03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:56.360]  Today on Friday, Obama directed schools across the nation to provide transgender students with
[03:48:56.360 --> 03:49:01.800]  access to student with suitable facilities. Now, we've had the lawsuit go back and forth
[03:49:01.800 --> 03:49:05.720]  between North Carolina. We said this is an important principle. North Carolina should have
[03:49:05.720 --> 03:49:11.960]  stood up and said, you are not going to dictate in Charlotte because this is something that was
[03:49:11.960 --> 03:49:17.720]  started by one transgender outfit that was headed by a convicted child molester.
[03:49:17.720 --> 03:49:23.400]  They started this situation in Charlotte. The government of North Carolina should have said,
[03:49:23.400 --> 03:49:26.920]  hey, you're not going to dictate that to people. You're not going to dictate it to schools,
[03:49:26.920 --> 03:49:30.360]  to businesses, to other places. Instead, what they did was they came back,
[03:49:30.360 --> 03:49:35.240]  they escalated it. Then you've now got the federal government and the state government
[03:49:35.240 --> 03:49:39.160]  in North Carolina suing each other. But this is clearly a situation where the federal government
[03:49:39.160 --> 03:49:46.120]  has no legal authority at all. Now, the Texas Lieutenant Governor has talked about this.
[03:49:46.120 --> 03:49:51.320]  Dan Patrick, he said Obama's policy will divide the country not along political lines, but along
[03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:57.000]  family values and school districts. He says he's going to withhold funding if schools do not follow
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:50:02.760]  his policy. Well, in Texas, he can keep his 30 pieces of silver. We will not yield to blackmail
[03:50:02.760 --> 03:50:07.240]  from the president of the United States. And he noted that Texas public schools get about
[03:50:07.240 --> 03:50:11.960]  $10 billion worth of federal funds over each two-year budget. He said the majority of that
[03:50:11.960 --> 03:50:17.240]  is for the breakfast and the school lunch programs. And as Alex and Joe Biggs were talking about,
[03:50:18.040 --> 03:50:23.400]  we look at these pictures, this garbage food that Michelle has taken it upon herself to dictate.
[03:50:23.400 --> 03:50:27.400]  Isn't that a perfect metaphor for what our educational system has become?
[03:50:27.400 --> 03:50:32.760]  The junk that our educational system has turned into with Common Core, with the Department of
[03:50:32.760 --> 03:50:37.080]  Education manipulating everything. He says, so Barack Obama, if schools don't knuckle down to
[03:50:37.080 --> 03:50:41.480]  force girls showering with boys to force eight-year-old girls to have to endure boys coming
[03:50:41.480 --> 03:50:45.880]  into their bathroom, then he's going to take money from the poorest of the poor. He says,
[03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:49.800]  we're not going to sell this out. The president's going to find that Democrat families will push
[03:50:49.800 --> 03:50:54.200]  back against this. Republican families, black families, white families, brown families, this
[03:50:54.200 --> 03:50:59.800]  has nothing to do with being against transgender or gay. It has everything to do with keeping the
[03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:01.880]  federal government out of local issues.
[03:51:01.880 --> 03:51:14.960]  But as the president says, if your family doesn't vote on you, don't vote on them.
[03:51:14.960 --> 03:51:21.480]  Be wise and be ready with 25-year shelf life and wise food storage. Wise food storage provides

[03:52:31.160 --> 03:52:36.040]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery
[03:52:36.040 --> 03:52:40.800]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[03:52:40.800 --> 03:52:45.160]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.

[03:52:50.600 --> 03:52:52.360]  quality lab standard.
[03:52:52.360 --> 03:52:53.800]  That means it's clean.
[03:52:53.800 --> 03:52:54.800]  That means it's pure.
[03:52:54.800 --> 03:52:57.880]  That's InfowarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:52:57.880 --> 03:52:59.720]  Take action now before we sell out.
[03:52:59.720 --> 03:53:01.320]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[03:53:01.320 --> 03:53:05.440]  I'm a former 22-year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[03:53:05.440 --> 03:53:09.320]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[03:53:09.320 --> 03:53:13.400]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse, or a serious
[03:53:13.400 --> 03:53:14.400]  drought.
[03:53:14.400 --> 03:53:17.760]  We all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[03:53:17.760 --> 03:53:20.560]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[03:53:20.560 --> 03:53:25.480]  A U.S. company named HarvestRite has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[03:53:25.480 --> 03:53:27.760]  It's a home freeze dryer.
[03:53:27.760 --> 03:53:31.040]  With the product, you can preserve the foods your family loves.
[03:53:31.040 --> 03:53:35.920]  And the best part is, the food will last 25 years and still taste great.
[03:53:35.920 --> 03:53:37.840]  I've tried it and it's amazing.
[03:53:37.840 --> 03:53:42.080]  With a home freeze dryer from HarvestRite, you can literally freeze dry anything you
[03:53:42.080 --> 03:53:43.080]  eat.
[03:53:43.080 --> 03:53:44.840]  Even things like ice cream.
[03:53:44.840 --> 03:53:53.680]  To learn more, call HarvestRite today at 800-594-4635 or go to HarvestRite.com.
[03:53:53.680 --> 03:54:14.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:14.800 --> 03:54:15.800]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:15.800 --> 03:54:18.080]  I want to go to our callers who are waiting real quickly.
[03:54:18.080 --> 03:54:21.080]  We now have Vidun Moon Mineral Fusion Drink Mix.
[03:54:21.080 --> 03:54:24.360]  It's our new product that's sold out right away as soon as we put it out there.
[03:54:24.360 --> 03:54:25.360]  It's very popular.
[03:54:25.360 --> 03:54:26.880]  It is a great product.
[03:54:26.880 --> 03:54:33.160]  A full month supply of essential vitamins and minerals that is now back in stock at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:54:33.160 --> 03:54:37.880]  Also as Alex pointed out, we had the 30-40% off Infowars Select Storeable Food.
[03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:40.360]  We still have some of our best sellers.
[03:54:40.360 --> 03:54:42.240]  That's not going to last very long.
[03:54:42.240 --> 03:54:44.680]  Take advantage of that while that is still available.
[03:54:44.680 --> 03:54:51.600]  30-40% off some of our best-selling Infowars Select Storeable Foods at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:54:51.600 --> 03:54:53.920]  Provide for your family and support our operation.
[03:54:53.920 --> 03:54:55.400]  We do thank you for your support.
[03:54:55.400 --> 03:54:59.680]  Thank you so much for those of you who have helped us in this win-win situation.
[03:54:59.680 --> 03:55:02.400]  Thank you, Aaron, and Texas, for holding so long.
[03:55:02.400 --> 03:55:03.640]  Tell us what you wanted to say.
[03:55:03.640 --> 03:55:04.640]  Go ahead.
[03:55:04.640 --> 03:55:05.640]  Yeah.
[03:55:05.640 --> 03:55:13.120]  I wanted to just let people know about a guy named Waleed Shubat of Shubat.com.
[03:55:13.120 --> 03:55:21.440]  He covers extensively Turkey in particular, which you may have heard, but a lot of the
[03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:23.720]  clamping down on journalists and stuff.
[03:55:23.720 --> 03:55:28.800]  Yeah, Turkey is an amazing situation, of course.
[03:55:28.800 --> 03:55:33.520]  We're channeling a lot of supplies and arms to ISIS via Turkey.
[03:55:33.520 --> 03:55:38.120]  Erdogan is running through an incredibly authoritarian program there.
[03:55:38.120 --> 03:55:44.520]  There is almost a de facto civil war that's going on between Erdogan and Vitalik Gulen
[03:55:44.520 --> 03:55:47.520]  forces in Turkey for control of that country.
[03:55:47.520 --> 03:55:49.920]  Neither one of them is a good guy.
[03:55:49.920 --> 03:55:54.760]  It is amazing how involved they are with what's going on in Syria with ISIS with our
[03:55:54.760 --> 03:55:55.760]  foreign policy.
[03:55:55.760 --> 03:56:00.120]  That is a good thing for people to be aware of to find out what's going on in Turkey.
[03:56:00.120 --> 03:56:01.120]  Go ahead.
[03:56:01.120 --> 03:56:02.120]  Yeah.
[03:56:02.120 --> 03:56:07.360]  I just wanted to just know that he's literally trying to revive the Caliphate system with
[03:56:07.360 --> 03:56:09.600]  the Muslim Brotherhood operative.
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:10.600]  Yes.
[03:56:10.600 --> 03:56:19.000]  And yeah, the whole EU migrant crisis, it's like just a blackmail to get the Europeans,
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:24.320]  like Merkel and others to just lay down to the invasion.
[03:56:24.320 --> 03:56:25.320]  Absolutely.
[03:56:25.320 --> 03:56:28.680]  I just wanted to make that point because I'm not sure.
[03:56:28.680 --> 03:56:32.640]  Both of those groups, both Erdogan and Vitalik Gulen, have both made those comments about
[03:56:32.640 --> 03:56:34.480]  establishing a worldwide Caliphate.
[03:56:34.480 --> 03:56:39.280]  And of course, Erdogan has a lot of influence with NATO, with our military, Vitalik Gulen
[03:56:39.280 --> 03:56:43.480]  has a network of charter schools throughout the United States, throughout the world.
[03:56:43.480 --> 03:56:45.560]  Many of them are, well, outside the United States.
[03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:49.440]  He gets a half a billion dollars worth of taxpayer money when we're talking about schools.
[03:56:49.440 --> 03:56:50.560]  That's one of the many issues.
[03:56:50.560 --> 03:56:51.560]  Thank you so much for holding Aaron.
[03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:55.320]  And I want to get to a couple of other callers who've been holding for a while as well.
[03:56:55.320 --> 03:56:59.600]  Let's go to, let's see who's been on there the longest, Deborah in Rhode Island.
[03:56:59.600 --> 03:57:00.600]  Go ahead.
[03:57:00.600 --> 03:57:01.600]  Hello.
[03:57:01.600 --> 03:57:05.040]  Hey, Deborah, thank you for holding.
[03:57:05.040 --> 03:57:06.040]  Go ahead.
[03:57:06.040 --> 03:57:07.040]  Hey, David, how are you?
[03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:08.040]  Long time listener.
[03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:09.040]  12 years.
[03:57:09.040 --> 03:57:10.040]  Oh, thank you.
[03:57:10.040 --> 03:57:11.040]  Thank you for supporting us.
[03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:12.040]  Yeah.
[03:57:12.040 --> 03:57:13.040]  And then passing, promoting, posting.
[03:57:13.040 --> 03:57:14.040]  That's great.
[03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:15.040]  And woken up a lot of people.
[03:57:15.040 --> 03:57:16.040]  Yeah.
[03:57:16.040 --> 03:57:18.040]  Well, it's a cooperative effort.
[03:57:18.040 --> 03:57:19.040]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:19.040 --> 03:57:20.040]  We've got it very little time.
[03:57:20.040 --> 03:57:21.040]  So go ahead.
[03:57:21.040 --> 03:57:22.040]  Yes.
[03:57:22.040 --> 03:57:28.040]  I don't know where to start, but I just don't understand why Hillary Clinton is still able
[03:57:28.040 --> 03:57:33.040]  to be running for office, never mind the president.
[03:57:33.040 --> 03:57:34.040]  Yeah.
[03:57:34.040 --> 03:57:35.040]  Yeah.
[03:57:35.040 --> 03:57:36.040]  Why isn't she locked up?
[03:57:36.040 --> 03:57:37.040]  Absolutely.
[03:57:37.040 --> 03:57:42.240]  When we listened to Chris Tonto-Paranto talking to the guy who was at Benghazi, you know, it
[03:57:42.240 --> 03:57:47.680]  is amazing that nothing, nothing that she does ever gets them in trouble.
[03:57:47.680 --> 03:57:48.680]  They sail above everything.
[03:57:48.680 --> 03:57:49.680]  Isn't that incredible?
[03:57:49.680 --> 03:57:50.680]  Something.
[03:57:50.680 --> 03:57:53.680]  I've been a long time supporter of the military.
[03:57:53.680 --> 03:57:56.600]  I hold a power of attorney for a homeless veteran.
[03:57:56.600 --> 03:58:00.680]  It was a sniper for six years in the military for almost 20 years.
[03:58:00.680 --> 03:58:01.680]  Okay.
[03:58:01.680 --> 03:58:03.880]  He lived in North Carolina.
[03:58:03.880 --> 03:58:10.280]  And I didn't hear this from him, but I did hear this from somebody that is, that knows
[03:58:10.280 --> 03:58:18.960]  that there was some really bad blood, really bad blood between, between Stevens and Hillary
[03:58:18.960 --> 03:58:19.960]  Clinton.
[03:58:19.960 --> 03:58:20.960]  Yeah.
[03:58:20.960 --> 03:58:21.960]  Towards the end.
[03:58:21.960 --> 03:58:22.960]  Oh yeah.
[03:58:22.960 --> 03:58:23.960]  Yeah.
[03:58:23.960 --> 03:58:24.960]  We've had a lot of talk about it.
[03:58:24.960 --> 03:58:25.960]  I'm sorry.
[03:58:25.960 --> 03:58:26.960]  Thank you for joining us.
