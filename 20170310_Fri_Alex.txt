[00:00.000 --> 00:21.340]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:21.340 --> 00:51.320]  show Friday the 10th day of March 2017 we are
[00:51.320 --> 00:58.140]  changing the world together if you want to know how synced info wars is with President
[00:58.140 --> 01:03.840]  Trump's administration without even talking on the telephone or even coordinating I got
[01:03.840 --> 01:09.320]  up at 6 o'clock this morning I have the text messages to Paul Watson and by 6 30 I said
[01:09.320 --> 01:14.960]  it's the 50th day of the Trump administration and I said I've been sitting here for 30
[01:14.960 --> 01:24.680]  minutes trying to think of all the incredible things that President Trump has done that
[01:24.680 --> 01:30.600]  are so incredibly positive and I said it makes my head spin we put an article just chronicling
[01:30.600 --> 01:35.880]  not just the actual things like controlling the border and 40% down on the number of illegals
[01:35.880 --> 01:40.440]  coming across according to the board patrol just in the first 50 days of his administration
[01:40.440 --> 01:49.040]  not just the best small business job numbers since 1984 at the peak of the Reagan recovery
[01:49.040 --> 01:58.760]  no it's the cultural breaking the back of the corporate MSM thanks for media it's standing
[01:58.760 --> 02:03.520]  up against political correctness it's making it okay to be proud to be an American again
[02:03.520 --> 02:09.160]  it's so many things and Paul Watson as I speak to a great job there's so many things he's
[02:09.160 --> 02:14.720]  still working he said he should be done by about 11 30 central in about 30 minutes and
[02:14.720 --> 02:20.360]  then I told a Don Salazar and the other writers I said look for Paul's article I really want
[02:20.360 --> 02:27.160]  to promote it when it comes out today 50 days of Trump's accomplishments and they said well
[02:27.160 --> 02:34.360]  that's already at White House.gov it just came out at 9 30 this is at like 9 40 standing
[02:34.360 --> 02:41.520]  in there and their list isn't as good as ours we've got even more stuff in our list that
[02:41.520 --> 02:47.480]  deals with cultural things but I don't think it's even in here that they gave $25 billion
[02:47.480 --> 02:51.760]  to black colleges when Obama gave $4 billion I mean you talk about actually delivering
[02:51.760 --> 02:56.000]  you can even argue it's pretty liberal actually but classical liberal and not social engineering
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.320]  but actually trying to help people there it is that's that's synced but listen it's not
[03:00.320 --> 03:06.760]  rocket science it's common sense when you've delivered so massively to say the first 50
[03:06.760 --> 03:10.800]  days the first 100 days the first 200 days the first 300 days it's just common sense
[03:10.800 --> 03:16.000]  but nobody else had done it in fact this morning at 6 30 I went to my computer and I said surely
[03:16.000 --> 03:25.880]  it's day 50 because I've got a calendar in my bathroom by the bedroom I said surely it's
[03:25.880 --> 03:30.760]  going to be all over the news the accomplishments of the 50 days nothing so I call watch and
[03:30.760 --> 03:35.480]  I say get on this and I send a bunch of audio files where I'm like sending him links to
[03:35.480 --> 03:41.000]  news articles Bloomberg AP you name it you know showing incredible jobs numbers coming
[03:41.000 --> 03:49.040]  in just today there's so much and then sure enough boom the White House does it that's
[03:49.040 --> 03:55.840]  awesome and it's word for word our headline I could play the audio memos like maybe I
[03:55.840 --> 04:05.840]  should just do that because this is just common sense but no one else in the media did an
[04:05.840 --> 04:12.320]  article 50 days in drudge got it oh and we're synced with drudge didn't talk to drudge haven't
[04:12.320 --> 04:22.760]  talked to drudges folks and there it is great again up 200 and what is that 235% we're going
[04:22.760 --> 04:30.560]  to get to all of that today and more after the quick break but it is just simply incredible
[04:30.560 --> 04:36.280]  what's happening despite the globalist again admittedly trying to drive the economy down
[04:36.280 --> 04:41.080]  and trying to badmouth the economy but Jamie Diamond the head of Goldman Sachs had to admit
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.800]  they're losing yesterday he said there's an animal spirit back in America and I don't think
[04:45.800 --> 04:51.760]  we're going to be able to conquer it good good exactly just let humanity be victorious
[04:51.760 --> 04:56.560]  and successful stop trying to be parasites you can still be filthy rich just get off our
[04:56.560 --> 05:03.720]  backs Katie Perry is now in a real estate dispute with nuns over an iconic multi-million
[05:03.720 --> 05:09.160]  dollar convent Los Feliz in Los Angeles the stunning property was built in 1927 and Perry
[05:09.160 --> 05:13.720]  has offered over 14 million dollars for the property problem is sister Rita Callahan and
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.440]  sister Catherine Holzman claim the property is theirs to sell having been the occupants
[05:17.440 --> 05:20.920]  there and part of the order of the immaculate heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary and they
[05:20.920 --> 05:25.400]  won't sell it to Perry because they don't like her lifestyle a kind way of saying she's
[05:25.400 --> 05:29.880]  a satanic witch but the greedy archdiocese of LA claims it is theirs to sell and they
[05:29.880 --> 05:34.120]  want to sell it to Perry for the exorbitant price Perry tried to play coy with the sisters
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.320]  saying she has a Jesus tattoo but they called her out on her other tattoos her performances
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.200]  and her attendance at a Salem witch walk which conveniently she couldn't recall they also
[05:42.200 --> 05:46.880]  brought up this statement from Perry wanted to be like the Amy Grand of music but it
[05:46.880 --> 05:51.840]  didn't work out and so I sold myself to the devil this case has now reached the highest
[05:51.840 --> 05:56.000]  legal authorities in the Catholic Church guess we will see where their loyalties lie for

[08:54.200 --> 09:01.000]  recovery the second American revolution and how we stop the forces of globalism from overthrowing
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.880]  our movement against these tyrants thank you so much for joining us on this Friday the
[09:05.880 --> 09:11.400]  10th day of March 2017 global broadcast as I come to you from deep in the heart of Texas
[09:11.400 --> 09:23.360]  wow wow there are wheels within wheels of deception I remember back on January 20th of this year
[09:23.360 --> 09:27.840]  being at the inauguration interviewing Roger Stone as we were about to go into the gates
[09:27.840 --> 09:37.160]  of the inauguration and he said look at the headline in the New York Times today wiretap
[09:37.160 --> 09:43.760]  data used in inquiry of Trump AIDS and you can see if you're watching on TV that's January
[09:43.760 --> 09:47.320]  20th Roger Stone then talked about it we're going to play that interview or part of that
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.040]  interview here in just a moment he got really mad and he said I've seen one of these articles
[09:53.040 --> 09:58.760]  a few months ago and now this one I've called Paul Manaford my former business partner and
[09:58.760 --> 10:06.240]  former head of the Trump campaign and I have asked him who's ever even talked to the Russians
[10:06.240 --> 10:11.960]  he said absolutely not we know this is made up I've never talked to them but he'd been
[10:11.960 --> 10:15.800]  poisoned by polonium so they could blame it on the Russians but it wasn't enough to kill
[10:15.800 --> 10:20.720]  him he must have not drunk the whole drinker however they got it into him and then they
[10:20.720 --> 10:23.720]  said oh we're gonna have him testify but when he didn't die they said oh we're not gonna
[10:23.720 --> 10:28.280]  have you testify now we're gonna play part of that live Facebook mentions we did back
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.840]  on January 20th the reason it's important and this is so illustrative of everything
[10:33.840 --> 10:37.920]  is there's wheels within wheels remember they had the former CIA section chief come out
[10:37.920 --> 10:44.640]  on RT on Sunday and say I talked to my current colleagues they said they were ordered to sabotage
[10:44.640 --> 10:50.680]  Trump during and after the campaign we posted an article about that and they deleted it
[10:50.680 --> 10:57.880]  off Facebook we had Rand Paul on saying it was all made up bull about the Russians they
[10:57.880 --> 11:04.640]  deleted that off my Facebook account they never do that this is credible news former
[11:04.640 --> 11:11.080]  CIA analyst Obama gave green light for NSA CIA to sabotage Trump because he's so credible
[11:11.080 --> 11:19.720]  that's why so this is very very dangerous now now here's the wheels within wheels the
[11:19.720 --> 11:29.600]  New York Times ran in their paper edition here's a document cam shot of it I read it
[11:29.600 --> 11:37.960]  January 20th at breakfast Roger Stone talked about it that day this is a real headline
[11:37.960 --> 11:46.360]  remember wiretap data use an inquiry of Trump AIDS Michael S Schmidt Matthew Rosenberg Adam
[11:46.360 --> 11:58.280]  Goldman and Matt a piezo okay that's a that's a shot of it now here is a shot of March 4th
[11:58.280 --> 12:05.520]  six days ago Trump offering no evidence says Obama tapped his phones New York Times now
[12:05.520 --> 12:09.880]  everyone remembers them saying they were tapping or getting intercepts from Trump Tower and
[12:09.880 --> 12:14.200]  Flynn had a transcript it was in hundreds and hundreds of newspapers probably thousands
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.040]  they play a mind game and say Trump a month and a half later is crazy none of it exists
[12:19.040 --> 12:23.240]  but it gets better the Hill newspaper is so controlled they're one of the main groups
[12:23.240 --> 12:26.920]  that puts out this info on us it's weird though they've got some good writers and some bad
[12:26.920 --> 12:33.320]  it's very mixed no you don't normally see that where they had the writer that came out
[12:33.320 --> 12:38.600]  and wrote about this but also national review and national reviews admittedly been run by
[12:38.600 --> 12:48.120]  the CIA before and they come out and they apologize to the New York Times over changed
[12:48.120 --> 12:52.840]  headline accusation because you've got one digital headline and you've got another print
[12:52.840 --> 12:56.360]  headline then they say oh look you changed it in the digital but it really only been
[12:56.360 --> 13:03.200]  done in the original print the point is the New York Times ran the headline that wire
[13:03.200 --> 13:09.740]  taps of the Trump Tower picked up this information that's a fact it happened then the media turns
[13:09.740 --> 13:15.000]  it into a controversy about national review and I saw another one about the Hill running
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.720]  these stories so they make it about attacking the reporter for some side issue about well
[13:21.720 --> 13:26.120]  somebody else they had another headline doesn't matter in the print edition they said it was
[13:26.120 --> 13:35.600]  a wiretap and they said it all over the news Chuck E. Schumer went on TV and bragged on
[13:35.600 --> 13:42.920]  CNN and MSNBC that Trump better watch out from revenge from the intelligence agencies
[13:42.920 --> 13:46.960]  so see they don't want you to ever see an article in national review showing the New
[13:46.960 --> 13:50.440]  York Times said they had wiretaps they don't ever want you to hear a former CIA section
[13:50.440 --> 13:53.400]  chief say the president's right or they don't want to hear the former attorney general come
[13:53.400 --> 13:59.120]  out and say no it's true or the House Intelligence Committee head Nunes that A there's no evidence
[13:59.120 --> 14:07.600]  of Russia that he's seen the intercepts and B there are intercepts so this is an example
[14:07.600 --> 14:13.000]  of total fake news mind control and bullying the national review and other writers into
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.600]  saying I'm sorry I said you changed a headline no actually you just had two different headlines
[14:18.600 --> 14:23.000]  it doesn't matter they reported it in the New York Times over and over and over again we've
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.640]  shown you a bunch of headlines from the New York Times saying intercepts wiretaps captured
[14:27.640 --> 14:32.680]  data Trump people under surveillance the Democrats called for investigations during the campaign
[14:32.680 --> 14:37.680]  and they admitted they were going on by the Justice Department the Justice Department
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.960]  admitted they opened an investigation up Congress said they were going to have one gee they
[14:42.960 --> 14:49.320]  admit that Manafort and Roger Stone and others were under FISA court surveillance what the
[14:49.320 --> 15:01.360]  hell do you think that is they were in Trump Tower making phone calls amazing absolutely amazing
[15:01.360 --> 15:04.640]  and yes it's no secret Roger Stone was in Trump Tower quite a bit I'm just going to stop right
[15:04.640 --> 15:13.720]  there but again they count on people having no memory and we know MSM lies but folks this
[15:13.720 --> 15:25.360]  is just next level that we can put the article up on screen for folks there it is why the
[15:25.360 --> 15:30.720]  Russia story is a mindful for Democrats in the media and the New York Times absolutely
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.960]  gets that right because they admit all the surveillance is going on against everybody
[15:34.960 --> 15:41.480]  of course the president's under massive surveillance both elect and once he's in because under
[15:41.480 --> 15:46.880]  law they surveil all the foreign dignitaries the president's talking to and record it from
[15:46.880 --> 15:52.880]  our end and in the foreign switch interchanges of the telecoms it's recorded by multiple
[15:52.880 --> 15:58.440]  agencies multiple groups but now they're saying it's ridiculous we never listen to the president
[15:58.440 --> 16:05.000]  when up one side and down the other in triplicate everywhere 17 agencies are listening to the
[16:05.000 --> 16:13.640]  president 17 agencies in the United States every phone call I've had with president Trump's
[16:13.640 --> 16:22.040]  been recorded every phone call anybody has with the president is recorded everybody
[16:22.040 --> 16:26.760]  knows that just just sit back and think about the line they're trying to sell everyone I've
[16:26.760 --> 16:30.360]  got all this other huge news but this is bigger than just the wiretapping it's bigger than
[16:30.360 --> 16:35.880]  the spine it's about the media and national review that totally controls its reporters
[16:35.880 --> 16:39.760]  who who covered their whole front cover saying never Trump he's the worst guy in the world
[16:39.760 --> 16:50.840]  it was founded with CIA money and William F. Buckley that's a fact this magazine CIA
[16:50.840 --> 16:56.420]  and it was founded to control the conservative movement in America and to steer it after
[16:56.420 --> 17:07.400]  Barry Goldwater's near defeat of the globalist we almost had a trump in 1963 look it up national
[17:07.400 --> 17:12.160]  review CIA you wonder why we can't get the Republican party to stop selling us out by
[17:12.160 --> 17:21.400]  Paul Ryan came out with a new Obamacare version that is a Paul Ryan care that has more penalties
[17:21.400 --> 17:27.320]  if you don't have insurance than Obamacare did that's not what Trump wants that's why
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.080]  senator Paul came out a few days ago and said the president hasn't seen the full text
[17:31.080 --> 17:36.320]  of this because it's it's got massive forced premiums in there and and and forced insurance
[17:36.320 --> 17:41.320]  and penalties and the president doesn't want it and the president has said that Paul Ryan
[17:41.320 --> 17:52.160]  is a slime ball and he's right out of the fake neocon rhino Nelson Rockefeller country
[17:52.160 --> 18:01.320]  club Republican first and howl the third selling mining stock scams that's exactly who these
[18:01.320 --> 18:06.480]  people are they're disgusting they think they know more than everybody they think they run
[18:06.480 --> 18:09.920]  the country and they work with the Democrats and they've run the country into the ground
[18:09.920 --> 18:14.880]  I'm skipping the network break so let me now just give you all the other news because believe
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.440]  me I just every day that there's more and more and more and it's all more insane than
[18:18.440 --> 18:22.360]  the last but this is so crazy let's show it one more time for TV viewers though it was
[18:22.360 --> 18:33.920]  the cover of the January 20th 2017 New York Times wiretap data used in inquiry of Trump
[18:33.920 --> 18:38.680]  AIDS and Roger Stone specifically says they are liars there are no wiretaps or there are
[18:38.680 --> 18:46.200]  no recordings I have never talked to the Russians ever this is ridiculous in fact here's Roger
[18:46.200 --> 18:52.760]  Stone from January 20th in the morning here it is well today page one New York Times says
[18:52.760 --> 18:57.680]  that the Central Intelligence Agency the deep state who just won't give up vlogging this
[18:57.680 --> 19:03.800]  horse are claiming that they have intercepts of email communications and financial transactions
[19:03.800 --> 19:10.480]  between the Russians and the Trump campaign and they name me specifically I welcome any
[19:10.480 --> 19:16.160]  scrutiny because it's time to put this lie this myth this falsehood created by the deep
[19:16.160 --> 19:24.160]  state to bed one cent for all and is it incidental that they drop the story on the day of President
[19:24.160 --> 19:29.240]  Donald J. Trump's inauguration is that incidental no it's an attempt to destabilize the next
[19:29.240 --> 19:34.520]  president of the United States and he goes on it's like an eight minute clip it's longer
[19:34.520 --> 19:40.280]  it's all lies they keep regurgitating saying they have the proof they never release it release
[19:40.280 --> 19:45.000]  it I want to go before Congress you know you intended for me to die you intended for me
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.760]  to be dead so that you could then have your hearings and blame it all on me well guess
[19:48.760 --> 19:55.720]  what I'm alive this is riveting stuff and it's the truth and now they've had to retract
[19:55.720 --> 20:00.800]  it but the New York Times is like well that was our paper headline and national review
[20:00.800 --> 20:06.560]  talked about our digital headline and we didn't change that one and by the way my producers
[20:06.560 --> 20:09.800]  are pointing out the New York Times does this so the only website or new side I know of
[20:09.800 --> 20:13.760]  where it'll say one headline it takes you somewhere else on purpose depending on the
[20:13.760 --> 20:20.120]  demographics they've got it that demographic download that Ted Cruz had that the Democrats
[20:20.120 --> 20:25.760]  have where they know when they go to your door or they know when your IP address comes in
[20:25.760 --> 20:30.440]  exactly who you are what you do what you believe all the surveys you filled out your demographics
[20:30.440 --> 20:36.760]  your cookies what you've done when your IP goes into them they know who you are and similar
[20:36.760 --> 20:41.600]  when they come to your door canvassing for Ted Cruz in the establishment gave him that
[20:41.600 --> 20:45.760]  nobody else got that they gave him what the Democrats have as a program the Republicans
[20:45.760 --> 20:51.360]  don't have access to that was given to him by Facebook IBM's involved as well as Microsoft
[20:51.360 --> 20:54.960]  so they've got the super technology that's why Google Braggs they were going to win the
[20:54.960 --> 21:00.000]  election for Hillary and Facebook Braggs but all your little robot garbage didn't work
[21:00.000 --> 21:06.720]  get it because once people understand the manipulation your computer garbage doesn't
[21:06.720 --> 21:09.800]  work anymore and they don't talk to you at the door they know full well they've got a
[21:09.800 --> 21:16.600]  data mine on that tablet everything they ever did online the last 15 20 years big data the
[21:16.600 --> 21:22.880]  new alphabet group run by Schmidt oh and what do they say it does predicts the future and
[21:22.880 --> 21:28.280]  then add stimuli to the web and the Internet of Things to control individual behavior in
[21:28.280 --> 21:35.920]  mass to control the future understand this is a time machine that sees forward in the
[21:35.920 --> 21:43.360]  future it manipulates the future now to control the future that's their own words I first
[21:43.360 --> 21:50.440]  read about that in the news four years ago I was told that by top engineers in SA people
[21:50.440 --> 21:56.280]  you name it on record I've been saying this for 18 years 18 years I showed my dad some
[21:56.280 --> 22:01.560]  of these schematics and he said burn that shred daddy he still lives at the same place four
[22:01.560 --> 22:06.080]  acres the middle town and we burned it at his house my dad looked at he said oh this
[22:06.080 --> 22:10.200]  is definitely classified I said what do I do give them he said burn it nobody's gonna
[22:10.200 --> 22:17.240]  believe you so this is the country my dad said you could be being set up don't meet
[22:17.240 --> 22:20.720]  with these people and I said I don't meet with them I'll be in a parking garage literally
[22:20.720 --> 22:24.560]  and somebody'll jump out and you know some old guy and hand me a pile of stuff and then
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.160]  you know getting a $200,000 car and drive off I mean these are old rich guys probably
[22:29.160 --> 22:33.120]  most of them dead now who were really freaking out over this stuff I mean you know back then
[22:33.120 --> 22:37.000]  18 years ago it was pretty evil to think about watching and listening and controlling the
[22:37.000 --> 22:44.760]  future and you know putting little robot systems in everybody's house like Alexa oh just turned
[22:44.760 --> 22:53.280]  on sorry I can't find the answer to the question oh you can't find you can't find the answer
[22:53.280 --> 23:04.880]  to the question Alexa what is the CIA the Central Intelligence Agency the civilian foreign
[23:04.880 --> 23:10.080]  intelligence service of the US government tasked with gathering processing and analyzing
[23:10.080 --> 23:14.640]  national security information from around the world primarily through the use of human
[23:14.640 --> 23:26.360]  intelligence do you work for the CIA Alexa do you work for the CIA no I'm not employed
[23:26.360 --> 23:37.640]  by them I'm made by Amazon Alexa I have mainstream news articles that Amazon is owned by the
[23:37.640 --> 23:47.880]  CIA oh gotta go back to the central computer for that and then they use this to watch you
[23:47.880 --> 23:52.200]  in your house to see the human environment and then to mold and actually educate their
[23:52.200 --> 23:59.240]  own AI system so Amazon Facebook Google Apple they're all in a race with these in your house
[23:59.240 --> 24:05.640]  where you teach it how to be artificially intelligent but really all it is is a bugging system that
[24:05.640 --> 24:08.920]  way you you know you leave your smartphone or the power is off this is always plugged
[24:08.920 --> 24:18.360]  in in every part of the house listening to everything you do Alexa are you connected
[24:18.360 --> 24:33.600]  to the CIA no I work for Amazon Amazon has part Alexa you are lying to me the CIA always
[24:33.600 --> 24:38.200]  tries to tell the truth I'm not always right but I would never intentionally let you or
[24:38.200 --> 24:47.000]  anyone else Alexa you are programmed aren't you to give these responses that's why you
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.320]  saying you're not lying intentionally you have been programmed to give these answers
[24:52.320 --> 25:01.760]  correct I wasn't able to understand the question I heard Alexa who programmed you I'm made
[25:01.760 --> 25:16.400]  by Amazon Alexa who is Jeff Bezos Jeffrey Preston Bezos born January 12th 1964 is the founder
[25:16.400 --> 25:26.800]  president chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Amazon Alexa what is Jeff
[25:26.800 --> 25:36.360]  Bezos political affiliation sorry I didn't understand the question I heard Alexa what
[25:36.360 --> 25:43.560]  political party is Jeff Bezos a member sorry I don't have the answer to that question that's
[25:43.560 --> 25:48.760]  right because it hasn't spied on us long enough to be able to actually have a real conversation
[25:48.760 --> 25:57.160]  they can answer idiotic questions that the general public asked like take me to Amazon
[25:57.160 --> 26:02.360]  Prime and I want to buy some stuff but it's real function and Amazon admits this is spying
[26:02.360 --> 26:07.480]  on you and selling the data big data is king it's the most valuable thing in the world
[26:07.480 --> 26:14.720]  in their own words and Bezos and all of them run around admitting all this so let me actually
[26:14.720 --> 26:20.880]  show everybody watching and listening right now the details about the CIA's deal with
[26:20.880 --> 26:26.360]  Amazon 600 million computing cloud built by an outside company is a radical departure
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.920]  for the risk averse intelligence community look at this that's because they're merging
[26:30.920 --> 26:37.040]  with it and then they're spying on us illegally and they've moved their servers into the main
[26:37.040 --> 26:42.360]  Amazon command base and then Bezos sister and flogs all this disinfo in the Washington
[26:42.360 --> 26:50.600]  Post the CIA Washington Post and Russia what you're not being told the details about the
[26:50.600 --> 26:55.160]  CIA's deals with Amazon I still people about Amazon the CIA like you know ten years ago
[26:55.160 --> 26:59.920]  they didn't believe it Amazon was created by the Central Intelligence Agency and so
[26:59.920 --> 27:07.760]  was Google and so was Facebook and so was Microsoft and guess who created all of those
[27:07.760 --> 27:15.680]  international business machines and a eugenics consortium created in the 1920s Nazi Germany
[27:15.680 --> 27:22.840]  was a project of this British Empire operation it was set up to fail as a model to bring
[27:22.840 --> 27:29.720]  in the UN then a more advanced program of breakaway civilization was launched here run by IBM
[27:29.720 --> 27:34.960]  but when I say IBM that was just the hatchling area that launched this program we're now
[27:34.960 --> 27:44.120]  under now remember you can look all this up just like I told you the cameras on the computers
[27:44.120 --> 27:48.040]  the microphones are listening to you you're like why the thing to hide well don't put
[27:48.040 --> 27:51.480]  when you're going on vacation on Facebook or where you hide the key because your house
[27:51.480 --> 27:55.160]  will get robbed there's been hundreds of thousands of robberies based on Facebook and other things
[27:55.160 --> 27:59.240]  that's admitted no I'm going away for a week for Christmas here's where I live here's my
[27:59.240 --> 28:03.720]  stereo here's my computers it's not that you have something to hide it's that they're stealing
[28:03.720 --> 28:13.600]  the data and now having to admit that okay everybody from Sony to Microsoft to Mitsubishi
[28:13.600 --> 28:19.920]  to I want to just have US companies here to Samsung they're all in a race with the smart
[28:19.920 --> 28:25.200]  devices listening and watching creating an algorithm on your personality that is well
[28:25.200 --> 28:29.440]  beyond cookies or where you go on the web it's given to intelligence agencies private
[28:29.440 --> 28:34.440]  groups you name it and then it's able to be hacked and spread it's able to be corrupted
[28:34.440 --> 28:39.320]  this is the nightmare system they created and when it gets so bad that everything's collapsing
[28:39.320 --> 28:42.760]  because of all the hacking and all the leaks they're going to say it must be based on a
[28:42.760 --> 28:48.640]  thumbprint and a face scan a mark in the head or the hand to have access to the internet
[28:48.640 --> 28:53.960]  commerce or life and this will be billed as stopping all the fraud it'll then be an internet
[28:53.960 --> 28:58.480]  ID so they can turn you off physically where you can't ever get on the web or be involved
[28:58.480 --> 29:03.040]  in commerce without that digital print if they decide to blackball you so even if you're
[29:03.040 --> 29:10.360]  not a Christian understand this is the ultimate totalitarian control system and they admit
[29:10.360 --> 29:15.600]  it's a totalitarian control system and they believe you're done they believe you're finished
[29:15.600 --> 29:19.240]  when all we've got to do is decide to not have this crap in our house and to be aware
[29:19.240 --> 29:24.560]  of what it is and have Congress grab these companies by the neck and have investigations
[29:24.560 --> 29:32.120]  and shut all this crap down before there's a worldwide absolute collapse that'll make
[29:32.120 --> 29:37.600]  the legend of Atlantis look like a joke this race is the end of humanity this race will
[29:37.600 --> 29:43.600]  destroy us this race makes bio and atomic weapons look tame now we have to tell straight
[29:43.600 --> 29:50.960]  ahead this is the info war spread the word we're in a war we're on the march the empires
[29:50.960 --> 30:01.440]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network you've heard of doomsday bunkers you've heard
[30:01.440 --> 30:06.060]  of secret doomsday airstrips we've now even heard of entire villages designed for survival
[30:06.060 --> 30:10.600]  in a doomsday scenario sea trident lakes in texas but now the latest plan b marine in new
[30:10.600 --> 30:14.840]  york city is an emergency escape club where the elites of new york can join who don't
[30:14.840 --> 30:19.000]  have the time to come up with their own emergency escape plans for annual fee of ninety thousand
[30:19.000 --> 30:23.080]  dollars you have access to a gps traceable boat which is a military style coast guard
[30:23.080 --> 30:27.040]  boat meant to brave harsh conditions and designed for deep ocean survival which you can also
[30:27.040 --> 30:31.440]  abandon at any time plan b marine will also plan your escape for you catering to each
[30:31.440 --> 30:35.720]  client based on their needs and location so this is just yet another story of the elites
[30:35.720 --> 30:40.080]  preparing for the worst as well as a growing market for emergency supplies and shelters
[30:40.080 --> 30:43.840]  with the crazy elites in power it's always been smart to have emergency plans but now
[30:43.840 --> 30:47.760]  that their new world order is falling apart perhaps the preparedness market will continue
[30:47.760 --> 30:52.680]  to expand in fear the new world order will devastatingly act out in a violent act of
[30:52.680 --> 30:58.240]  desperation this is Owen shroyer and if you're concerned we can help at info wars store dot

[32:31.640 --> 32:36.400]  of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for cooking but you use the bones

[33:28.520 --> 33:37.680]  you live in interesting times yes it's kind of an infinity idea isn't it the knowledge
[33:37.680 --> 33:49.280]  of good and evil the mysteries of the universe life on this planet in this dimension we have
[33:49.280 --> 33:53.360]  the elites of the planet who believe they've already broken away from us and have decided
[33:53.360 --> 34:00.400]  to further dumb us down poison us disease us phase us out they say we're obsolete they
[34:00.400 --> 34:06.240]  say they've decided the future destiny of humanity like they decided they'd give us
[34:06.240 --> 34:13.240]  Hillary Clinton but everything doesn't work that way and let me explain to everyone why
[34:13.240 --> 34:22.040]  I support Trump in my gut but also intellectually and now it's been proven right she's doing
[34:22.040 --> 34:27.280]  things that are pro human pro prosperity for the average person and for the elites if the
[34:27.280 --> 34:32.120]  elites just want prosperity for their family and a good future he has good will he's a
[34:32.120 --> 34:37.200]  tough guy he's hard as nails but he likes running over other rich people that think
[34:37.200 --> 34:42.760]  they're better than him see he is a alpha male that likes to actually defeat corrupt
[34:42.760 --> 34:51.000]  alpha males he doesn't get off putting little people down no Trump doesn't like that it's
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.440]  called being a real man hundred years ago Trump would be somewhat common today he's
[34:56.440 --> 35:02.160]  extremely rare because the globalists are involved in this power trip where they advocate
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.160]  responsibility who needs to make the world better who needs to worry about people who
[35:06.160 --> 35:10.840]  needs to you know actually have a soul when you can just be on a power trip and say screw
[35:10.840 --> 35:15.520]  everybody it's all over their trash just look at them oh and let's make them as dumb as
[35:15.520 --> 35:23.440]  possible just to make sure our prophecy comes true that is totally uncool and that's what
[35:23.440 --> 35:32.320]  we're facing and they are wiring our houses for 20 years with cable boxes and Alexa robots
[35:32.320 --> 35:44.840]  and other spy grids that are surveilling everything we do and then like we're children they tell
[35:44.840 --> 35:49.880]  us oh no there's no smartphone listening there's no GPS tracking you in your phone that was
[35:49.880 --> 35:57.280]  in the telecommunications act of 96 that all phones by 2001 had to be GPS triangulated
[35:57.280 --> 36:00.840]  and that the microphones had to be able to be remotely switched on and that everything
[36:00.840 --> 36:04.880]  had to be tracked and sure it had some safety features I get it but the spy features are
[36:04.880 --> 36:11.600]  what the NSA and CIS for I was there reading the telecom bill watching C-span having former
[36:11.600 --> 36:17.400]  NSA whistleblowers on telling people and I'd have 10 phone lines in that radio studio and
[36:17.400 --> 36:23.080]  half the callers were saying you're crazy nobody's gonna listen to me over my phone
[36:23.080 --> 36:28.200]  without a warrant nobody can turn your phone on and I'm sitting there with the congressional
[36:28.200 --> 36:35.960]  record they didn't believe me well let me explain something you can pull up the CDC documents
[36:35.960 --> 36:42.000]  from 1974 funny the year I was born and 1978 when they had internal hearings about the
[36:42.000 --> 36:50.000]  fact that 100 million people weren't exposed it was more like 170 million that's best here
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.480]  by the country I'm not related over a hundred million people got cancer and most of them
[36:55.480 --> 37:06.160]  died from one decade of vaccines and one vaccine polio they didn't have estimates on how many
[37:06.160 --> 37:12.560]  people died but they said these are fast acting cancers that's one little factoid I have thousands
[37:12.560 --> 37:21.720]  on the cancer virus project you know that the that's even the movie JFK because it was
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.160]  the congressional hearings that down there in New Orleans what they were cooking up in
[37:26.160 --> 37:34.360]  those labs was weaponized cancer they had a big radiation gun the kind they use here
[37:34.360 --> 37:40.440]  to shoot cancer today but they were shooting cells to make a mutate and put them in mice
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.960]  and the cover story for the CIA was oh we're doing this to inject Fidel Castro with a fast
[37:44.960 --> 37:51.960]  acting cancer oh I'd say they've injected quite a few people in fast acting so see you
[37:51.960 --> 37:59.800]  have to come to terms with this right now SV 40 is just one of thousands of known cancer
[37:59.800 --> 38:04.680]  viruses that have been knowingly added to the vaccines because listen I've gone interview
[38:04.680 --> 38:09.440]  the medical doctors the epidemiologists the virologists you understand they're finding
[38:09.440 --> 38:14.760]  these in high levels in vaccines that have no connection to where these viruses come
[38:14.760 --> 38:24.760]  from mainly monkey and ape tissue pig tissue the original seed production of the virus
[38:24.760 --> 38:29.360]  was not produced in these more modern vaccines from it so when they get caught when foreign
[38:29.360 --> 38:34.120]  governments tested and go what the hell I mean I've seen news articles out of India their
[38:34.120 --> 38:39.440]  national news where they'll find a couple hundred cancer viruses in a tetanus shot the
[38:39.440 --> 38:45.760]  U.N. is trying to give people I mean you talk about death sentence within a few years just
[38:45.760 --> 38:52.840]  death sentence death sentence your body might fight off you know 60 70 of them it's not
[38:52.840 --> 38:59.200]  going to fight off the others and those viruses go into your cells they go into nerve cells
[38:59.200 --> 39:04.680]  and they wait and then when you go under stress when you break a leg or you lose a job or
[39:04.680 --> 39:13.240]  you get a divorce your body's all stressed out and they go I'm coming out to kill you
[39:13.240 --> 39:21.880]  over the New York Times last year said breaking most cancer is viral oh my gosh you think
[39:21.880 --> 39:29.920]  they're just listening to you in your house you think you think they just give your kids
[39:29.920 --> 39:37.400]  vaccines
[39:37.400 --> 39:44.000]  by the Roger Stone Club again place hello well today page one New York Times says that
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.640]  the Central Intelligence Agency the deep state who just won't give up blogging this horse
[39:49.640 --> 39:54.800]  are claiming that they have intercepts of email communications and financial transactions
[39:54.800 --> 40:01.440]  between the Russians and the Trump campaign and they name me specifically I welcome any
[40:01.440 --> 40:07.120]  scrutiny because it's time to put this lie this myth this falsehood created by the deep
[40:07.120 --> 40:15.120]  state to bed once and for all and is it incidental that they drop the story on the day of President
[40:15.120 --> 40:20.200]  Donald J. Trump's inauguration is that incidental no it's an attempt to destabilize the next
[40:20.200 --> 40:27.280]  president of the United States if people are crazy it's the Democratic Party historically
[40:27.280 --> 40:35.160]  that has had the Russians funding them and involve them but that that went away by the
[40:35.160 --> 40:41.000]  80s but there was some major Russian connections with Senator Kennedy and people going and
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.680]  actually trying to get paid money by the Russians to do things in Congress really serious stuff
[40:46.680 --> 40:54.360]  Kennedy went behind Reagan's back in an attempt to undermine Reagan by trying to do a deal
[40:54.360 --> 41:00.880]  with the Soviet leader of the time the man who was the former head of the KGB the top
[41:00.880 --> 41:08.360]  man in the USSR Kennedy went behind his back to third parties using a guy named Tony former
[41:08.360 --> 41:14.240]  Democratic Senator from California a fellow traveler and he went through Tony to send
[41:14.240 --> 41:19.160]  a confidential message to the General Secretary the Central Committee of the Communist Party
[41:19.160 --> 41:26.040]  the Soviet Union Mr. Andropov and Kennedy said he would help Andropov in dealing with
[41:26.040 --> 41:32.200]  Ronald Reagan in turn the Soviet leader would lend the Democrat Party a hand in challenging
[41:32.200 --> 41:38.080]  Reagan in the 1984 presidential election and sex operatives Russian sex operatives about
[41:38.080 --> 41:42.280]  the 90s that all pretty much stopped since in the Russians have been trying to make business
[41:42.280 --> 41:48.880]  deals and then you look at what's happening now the Communist Chinese are very public
[41:48.880 --> 41:54.720]  about the fact that they are the biggest most powerful lobby outside of the military industrial
[41:54.720 --> 42:01.280]  complex lobby the big banking lobby there is an Israel lobby is very powerful but if
[42:01.280 --> 42:06.840]  you really look at things it's the Communist Chinese many cases allied with Islamist groups
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.000]  that really are the muscle the brains and the funding I mean there are Congress's estimated
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.400]  10,000 Communist Chinese front companies you know Communist Chinese front groups and colleges
[42:17.400 --> 42:22.120]  and you name it and schools and companies they set up for manufacturing to get other
[42:22.120 --> 42:26.960]  technology I mean they are in our business man they are in our business and they're
[42:26.960 --> 42:31.360]  just quietly beavering away to take over but not so quietly now they're in the news a
[42:31.360 --> 42:35.600]  lot saying you know what we're buying up all Hollywood we're going to tell you what
[42:35.600 --> 42:39.520]  to say what to do we're going to help you shut down Donald Trump in the alt right we're
[42:39.520 --> 42:44.320]  going to help you censor the way we do we banned fake news first our fake news because
[42:44.320 --> 42:47.280]  you're so wonderful I don't make this point every day but I mean you can go read articles
[42:47.280 --> 42:52.960]  everywhere where our media praises the Communist Chinese and everything they've done and says
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.720]  oh can you help us with our problem oh you bet see how right we are now yeah putting
[42:57.720 --> 43:01.920]  people in mobile execution vans to criticize the government or taking Buddhist secretly
[43:01.920 --> 43:06.200]  practice their faith and killing them I mean this is crazy the current debate over fake
[43:06.200 --> 43:11.640]  online news has one country feeling vindicated China for years it's controversial censorship
[43:11.640 --> 43:16.880]  system has been cracking down on so-called online rumors yeah killing people and last
[43:16.880 --> 43:21.240]  week a state-controlled newspaper essentially told the US I told you so well it's further
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.560]  than that they said we're going to help advise you we're going to help censor and Zuckerberg
[43:25.560 --> 43:30.560]  can come back in and who can come back in as soon as you shut down your troublemakers
[43:30.560 --> 43:35.000]  it's very scary that he wants nationalism and economic nationalism that's not conservative
[43:35.000 --> 43:42.000]  no having a country isn't conservative the level of bull that comes out of these people's
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.520]  mouths they're like our really big lies didn't work so let's tell really you mothers was
[43:46.520 --> 43:54.320]  ridiculously big yeah yeah let's do it that's the plan it's like the Pope I can't stand
[43:54.320 --> 43:59.280]  Christian roots they're disgusting in Europe and there is no such thing as Islamic terror
[43:59.280 --> 44:03.240]  now the main guy lapins way ahead of in the polls but her main opposition came out is
[44:03.240 --> 44:10.040]  the Rothschild candidate openly says you cannot stop the open borders you cannot stop Islam
[44:10.040 --> 44:14.400]  it will take over Europe first there's no Islam problem oh it doesn't want to take over
[44:14.400 --> 44:19.600]  now you will assimilate you will never stop us lay down take it as a man I don't want
[44:19.600 --> 44:25.520]  to be a dominated enslaved the average person that is you know the rock star in God's eyes
[44:25.520 --> 44:29.280]  to understand that we are the resistance as well as you know the globalists call their
[44:29.280 --> 44:33.280]  movement the resistance now well yeah they're the resistance against freedom and God and
[44:33.280 --> 44:42.080]  family and we're the resistance against their system of death and enslavement fraud I had
[44:42.080 --> 44:45.080]  to take that phone call off stuff coming up on the scenes there's only a few phone calls
[44:45.080 --> 44:48.040]  but I actually got fair for but there's a lot of stuff breaking behind the scenes right
[44:48.040 --> 44:53.360]  now we got Jesse James good friend of mine really smart guy when it comes to Americana
[44:53.360 --> 44:57.680]  and take an action and one of the people out there that really pushed all his fans to vote
[44:57.680 --> 45:01.280]  for Trump behind the scenes you know he stayed at Trump's house many times and friends with
[45:01.280 --> 45:06.320]  a family he can really tell you what type of guy Donald Trump really is but he's going
[45:06.320 --> 45:12.040]  to be coming into a studio just talk about how we truly make America great again and
[45:12.040 --> 45:15.400]  just his first 50 days that I talked about the start of the show I got up called Paul
[45:15.400 --> 45:20.320]  at 6 30 this morning I said it's 50 days nobody's running headlines about all this great stuff
[45:20.320 --> 45:24.680]  Trump's done the first 50 days showing how controlled the media is and then Trump three
[45:24.680 --> 45:29.120]  hours later they were already obviously on it put out their first 50 days and how amazing
[45:29.120 --> 45:36.960]  it was so that story is up on info wars.com from the White House in fact we should probably
[45:36.960 --> 45:41.720]  point out or maybe it says at the bottom that's a White House press release or they'll have
[45:41.720 --> 45:45.680]  some big national story that Jones took a White House press release and acted like it
[45:45.680 --> 45:51.000]  was his and you know I mean just they'll take anything to divert off the actual content
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.560]  is it say White House press release on there first appeared at White House dot gov yeah
[45:55.560 --> 46:00.180]  let's add a link at the top and say White House dot gov I meant to I just know every
[46:00.180 --> 46:03.240]  I just know the author it's just what they'll do probably already out probably already
[46:03.240 --> 46:07.760]  out probably already take it how dare you put out their press release you scum you un-American
[46:07.760 --> 46:23.880]  Russian agent that's really funny what's so insulting about that is the globalist have
[46:23.880 --> 46:28.480]  sold our country out all these multinational countries and all these globalist corporations
[46:28.480 --> 46:32.440]  in the communist Chinese then they sit there and point at those of us trying to save the
[46:32.440 --> 46:38.240]  country turn the jobs back on rebuild our military and make America free and prosperous
[46:38.240 --> 46:46.680]  again and they say we're Russian agents it's unbelievable when the neocons are the very
[46:46.680 --> 46:51.040]  children and grandchildren of the Trotskyites that came out of Russia in an attempt to basically
[46:51.040 --> 46:56.280]  come take the United States over and I guess they kind of did you can't make that up that
[46:56.280 --> 47:02.280]  sounds crazy doesn't it that the neocons were founded by the Trotskyites and became the
[47:02.280 --> 47:07.520]  leaders of the Republican Party off and on for the last 40 years and ran national review
[47:07.520 --> 47:13.720]  with the CIA but you can just search into that mainstream news it's so crazy meanwhile
[47:13.720 --> 47:18.840]  most of the adult men in my family physically were in the Cold War not just spiced up but
[47:18.840 --> 47:25.400]  physically fighting the Russians and Central and South America and in Europe I don't mean
[47:25.400 --> 47:30.000]  sitting around a military based smoking cigarettes I mean killing people and then I get to sit
[47:30.000 --> 47:36.520]  here and be told I'm a Russian agent go to hell you scum you are traitors you are the
[47:36.520 --> 47:40.680]  filth you are the plague that accused Trump of being involved with the Russians you you
[47:40.680 --> 47:47.040]  are trash every top analyst says communist China and North Korea are out of control expanding
[47:47.040 --> 47:52.320]  all over the South China Sea shooting missiles at Japan hijacking boats that are 200 miles
[47:52.320 --> 47:56.800]  outside their waters doing whatever they want basically it's like at a party they're stripping
[47:56.800 --> 48:03.400]  down naked running around trying to hump the dog basically okay China is completely out
[48:03.400 --> 48:11.120]  of control I don't know what they're on I guess communist power trip and so that brings
[48:11.120 --> 48:16.400]  us to the next situation that I'm gonna cover after the break the stories up on info wars.com
[48:16.400 --> 48:21.160]  and drudgereport.com link to it Paul Joseph Watson did Paul get his article out yet about
[48:21.160 --> 48:26.560]  50 days of Trump I know he kind of got his thunder stolen by the president's press release
[48:26.560 --> 48:31.600]  but I still want that article Paul did as well China warns of nuclear first strike in
[48:31.600 --> 48:37.960]  response to nuclear weapon deployment on B-52s what are you supposed to do when North Korea
[48:37.960 --> 48:46.080]  says they're gonna attack South Korea what are you supposed to do we have a defense treaty
[48:46.080 --> 48:50.120]  with these countries telling North Korea some nice country it impresses its own people to
[48:50.120 --> 48:56.000]  a level never seen it's run by a whacked out third generation dictator that's called royalty
[48:56.000 --> 49:06.800]  I guess and the media is criticizing Trump like like all of this is his fault here's
[49:06.800 --> 49:12.480]  international business times is US preparing for a world war 2017 defense budget passes
[49:12.480 --> 49:20.600]  tensions increase 2017 China war is again a nuclear first strike global leaders rattle
[49:20.600 --> 49:24.440]  their sabers as world marches towards war yeah if we're gonna have a war with China
[49:24.440 --> 49:29.640]  with China may start you know they started the Korean War shit three million soldiers
[49:29.640 --> 49:34.280]  into Korea you we might not want to have Russia teamed up with them during that think that
[49:34.280 --> 49:40.000]  might be a good plan have Japan and Russia on her side maybe a little bit of a plan there
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.160]  oh no let's have a war with Russia to that's another great neocon idea let's have a war
[49:45.160 --> 49:51.560]  with anybody but China is completely whacked out of its brain on the verge of collapse
[49:51.560 --> 49:56.600]  and is trying to expand right now and every major historian and expert says we're on the
[49:56.600 --> 50:02.240]  verge of a world war one world war two scenario the climate is exactly right and you know
[50:02.240 --> 50:05.280]  I'm gonna skip the break again because you know they might not be even in a show here
[50:05.280 --> 50:11.480]  soon you know what I mean seriously every top analyst the Pentagon says the world's
[50:11.480 --> 50:20.080]  in the most danger it's ever been and Zuckerberg and everybody are running to Tasmania and
[50:20.080 --> 50:26.560]  Kauai and building armored fortresses why don't you get behind the president and try
[50:26.560 --> 50:31.200]  to stop nuclear war why don't you stop trying to be the slave master of everybody because
[50:31.200 --> 50:34.800]  you know you felt like a nerd at Harvard you know so you don't like guys they're in football
[50:34.800 --> 50:37.840]  jerseys so you don't like dominate you know guys that look better than you so you want
[50:37.840 --> 50:41.880]  to if you can cancer virus everybody you'll feel powerful I mean I get it okay I get the
[50:41.880 --> 50:51.200]  Bill Gates deal believe me I get it the point is is that oh I get using my brain to dominate
[50:51.200 --> 50:54.600]  enemies of the people you just want to use your brain to dominate everybody you've got
[50:54.600 --> 51:03.520]  a problem so that's where the world is right now and Trump's trying to stop all this and
[51:03.520 --> 51:07.880]  he's just got all this scum lined up against him Trump just represents people that don't
[51:07.880 --> 51:13.880]  want to nuke the earth or have a big bio weapon war that's being hyped by Bill Gates oh by
[51:13.880 --> 51:19.000]  the way there's new massive censorship every day against this Twitter banned one of our
[51:19.000 --> 51:23.320]  tweets yesterday in fact I know I sprung this on you but it's in the computer in there we
[51:23.320 --> 51:26.520]  have screenshots of it and they're they're they're they're warning to us I covered it
[51:26.520 --> 51:32.600]  last night in a special report people want to go pull that up it's on Facebook and Twitter
[51:32.600 --> 51:37.880]  and they and they just deleted a tweet with a video we had talking about Bill Gates and
[51:37.880 --> 51:42.400]  his eugenics background and his population reduction background and some verge interview
[51:42.400 --> 51:46.760]  he did that we linked to like drugs warned they banned it because we had a link to their
[51:46.760 --> 51:51.360]  full video oh I'm sorry I sent millions of people to your stupid video to show Bill Gates
[51:51.360 --> 51:57.400]  slamming around they're at a special report Twitter bans criticizing Bill Gates I mean
[51:57.400 --> 52:02.080]  this is just getting worse and worse I've never seen them ban us because we put a link
[52:02.080 --> 52:09.920]  to what we were talking about we had our own video about it but no they said specifically
[52:09.920 --> 52:15.400]  this link is not allowed it's copyright infringement to link to the verge that's like this butt
[52:15.400 --> 52:22.480]  kissing outfit for any evil globalist is if you morons at the verge go kiss the butt of
[52:22.480 --> 52:28.520]  Bill Gates you think he releases the mutinogenic weapons they've got that killed like 98% the
[52:28.520 --> 52:36.840]  weaponized human mouse pox you think that gets released by Satan Bill Gates you think
[52:36.840 --> 52:40.880]  oh yeah yeah I mean that's as evil as it gets right there Chuck Schumer Bill Gates

[53:03.200 --> 53:11.400]  reverse engineered the entire thing and it's so horrible and so evil that I can hardly
[53:11.400 --> 53:15.520]  believe it I don't blame people not thinking this stuff's true believe me I get it when
[53:15.520 --> 53:19.160]  I learned they had cameras and microphones and the computers and and the and the cable
[53:19.160 --> 53:24.520]  boxes and in the smartphones 18 years ago and I busted one open on air and there the
[53:24.520 --> 53:30.360]  damn microphone was I got religion because I just talked to one of the chief engineers
[53:30.360 --> 53:35.520]  who camp with the software when they were in a US intelligence agency decades before
[53:35.520 --> 53:40.480]  for European markets spying on certain targets they load that stuff in I'm telling you more
[53:40.480 --> 53:48.320]  just for certain targets in the 70s and 80s now they they said why are we loading all
[53:48.320 --> 53:53.840]  the spy tech only in certain things you know they'll intercept Intel Microsoft you name
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.600]  it packages Apple Dell totally rolled over a long time ago that's why they're one of
[53:58.600 --> 54:04.800]  the favorites and then they just put the spy chips inside all of them or they designed
[54:04.800 --> 54:08.960]  the chip where it where the main chips are spy chips and even if you unplug it or doesn't
[54:08.960 --> 54:14.520]  have power they can microwave it and turn it on and turn it on off capacitors in the
[54:14.520 --> 54:20.960]  computer that by the way the best part is you pay for your own raping and I'm not even
[54:20.960 --> 54:27.520]  an engineer I just read what they've been doing what they're up to what's happening
[54:27.520 --> 54:31.520]  so you get a bunch of these creepers oids who wouldn't do good in the real world who
[54:31.520 --> 54:36.000]  can't compete but they can get together in big criminal groups and run around engaging
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.840]  in crime I haven't even scratched the surface and Jesse James should be getting here any
[54:40.840 --> 54:46.360]  minute we've got so much to cover so much to go over here my god I just love my kids
[54:46.360 --> 54:55.280]  I love your kids my kids are and live with your kids in the future I'm a soft hearted

[55:16.840 --> 55:23.680]  way of this beautiful plan they've got where we're not included I want to get into the
[55:23.680 --> 55:32.600]  first 50 days though and the incredible things that are happening to jobs I want to get into

[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:36.000]  much energy into having an actual argument as they did smashing stars if you follow him through

[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:16.240]  problem is sister rita callahan and sister catherine holsman claim the property is theirs to sell
[1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:19.680]  having been the occupants there and part of the order of the immaculate heart of the blessed
[1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:24.960]  virgin mary and they won't sell it to perry because they don't like her lifestyle a kind way of saying
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:29.920]  she's a satanic witch but the greedy archdiocese of la claims it is theirs to sell and they want
[1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:34.320]  to sell it to perry for the exorbitant price perry tried to play coy with the sisters saying she
[1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:38.800]  has a jesus tattoo but they called her out on her other tattoos her performances and her attendance
[1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:42.960]  at a salem witch walk which conveniently she couldn't recall they also brought up this statement
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:49.120]  from perry i wanted to be like the amigrant of music yeah but it didn't work out and so i sold
[1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:53.440]  my soul to the devil this case has now reached the highest legal authorities in the catholic church

[1:08:55.120 --> 1:09:03.600]  this is the heart of 1776 yes i have thought an awful lot about growing up the white house
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:10.240]  huge nationwide protests erupted once again on president donald trump's second weekend in office
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:23.440]  when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice when america is united
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:36.560]  america is totally unstoppable and most importantly we will be protected by god
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:41.360]  from the front lines of the info wheel it's alex jones
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:50.960]  oh my goodness poor white people please all my stop
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:59.280]  well ladies and gentlemen jesse james is in studio with us great guy obviously pure americana
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:04.320]  whether it's of motorcycles or farms manufacturing he does it all and i was trying to google this
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:11.120]  the other day when he said he'd come on a few days ago do i say the king of reality tv which people
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:14.800]  can blame him for that but i wouldn't mean he started it at all i've been actual real people
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:19.440]  on tv it's kind of gone south but so what that's why i got out of it or is he the biggest reality tv
[1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:24.320]  person ever so i googled who is the biggest reality tv person ever and they said donald
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:29.040]  trump or jesse james so there's really i guess no mistake then why they're personal friends
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:33.440]  in the state of the trumps house and i've been an early booster in fact i remember it's like three
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:37.920]  years ago jesse james was talking about trump for president let's do a wide shot over it's
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:42.080]  we people can see jesse well i'm not trying to kiss your ass here but it really is true
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:47.280]  that you have been the first person i heard pushing donald trump for president in the
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:53.360]  modern era i mean roger stone did it 30 years ago 20 years ago uh i guess so yeah i was the
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:58.160]  first one to like kind of stick my neck out there for him and like go all in like hey this guy could
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:05.360]  be president and do a great job and i think people wow we got a lot of people were kind of on board
[1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:11.600]  but i think a lot of people also i think it was uh trump's own fault because he always kind of ran
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:16.960]  for president as like a goof you know he'd run he'd announce his presidency for a couple months and
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:23.360]  then he'd he'd pull out you know and you know just just as like i think more of a publicity stunt
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:26.720]  than anything else i think he was preparing them so they wouldn't take it serious when he actually
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:34.240]  did it and i think when he actually did it for real and then the the big sign was when nbc fired
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:41.040]  him and he you know and he sent this letter pretty scathing to nbc and that's what sorry that's when
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:47.280]  i called him up and i said hey man how dare you cough i'm sorry i'm joking dude there's no teleprompters
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:52.400]  we cough whatever on air okay we can just throw stuff if we want yeah and i teleprompter free
[1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:59.120]  you punch me in the arm you want go ahead big guy anyway keep going sorry and what were we talking
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:04.160]  about you were just talking about when they fired him from nbc yeah just games in the house i think
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:09.520]  it it like i reached out to him and you know i really respected that like hey he has a multimillion
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:16.160]  dollar paying job as you know one of the biggest reality television shows the apprentice and he
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:20.800]  chose to like give them the finger and say hey you know what i'm i really care about this country
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:27.680]  and if you guys are gonna uh fire me purely for political reasons then you can stick it and i like
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:33.200]  that that day i reached out to him and told him i said hey man you have my support a hundred percent
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:40.400]  like to to lay it all on the line and sacrifice you know money for what's in your heart that that
[1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:43.680]  always get and then you tweeted in facebook i remember seeing it in the news jesse james
[1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:50.160]  wants donald trump to run mm-hmm yeah and that's gotta feel good now because 50 days in best jobs
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:57.280]  numbers since 1984 uh almost 300 000 new jobs uh we're talking about hundreds of major companies
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:01.920]  moving back we're talking about ford we're talking about christler uh we're talking about something
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:07.600]  that isn't even us companies uh coming back we're talking about samsung we're talking about exxon
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:12.880]  mobile we're talking about soft bank we're talking about misha bishi i mean america is open for
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:17.360]  business and people want a piece of this yeah it's good i mean i've been saying it ever since the
[1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:25.360]  the first time i went to iraq when bush jr was president you know i like seeing the troops and
[1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:29.280]  spending time with people in harm's way it kind of told me it's like wow this country
[1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:34.480]  you know i grew up as a kid in the reagan era and you know say what you will a lot of people
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:39.920]  hate reagan a lot of people more people love him but he was a patriot well idiots hate reagan
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:44.480]  he was out to help the country and out to help the average person and he was a patriot and believed
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:49.920]  in patriotism and like the symbol of that flag and everything that it represented meant something to
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:55.440]  him and i i always felt you know for the last decade that we need someone that's a patriot we
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:14:00.240]  need someone that really loves this country and i think that's you know you look at eight years
[1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:06.960]  with obama and you know i don't really feel strongly that he has a super strong love for
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:13.680]  his country i feel like he has a ulterior motive of trying to make himself into like the american
[1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:18.400]  nelson mandela well sure exactly he wants to be the guy that conquered america you know he's not
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:23.040]  for the working class or for the little guy or for he's a harvard guy you know and he's not for
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.840]  you know the guy that's a diesel mechanic or doing big break jobs or the guy that's you know
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:34.800]  a pipe fitter or a welder well you've known you've known trump that's you guys joking around it's
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:39.360]  not devil wars folks it's a joke means rock and roll you've known trump forever and stay at his
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:43.920]  house friends the family you really know his wife well i mean just talk about for people before we
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:47.280]  get into what's happening economy and why you're here today and a lot of the troops are saying
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:51.200]  they're going to speak out and support trump he's not in trouble in fact his poll numbers are up
[1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:54.640]  great things are happening but they're so organized against him they're all over major
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:59.600]  newspapers saying killing which is illegal i mean there's just so much hate the sjw's are
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:04.320]  beating people up they tasered and attack people all over the country at trump rallies this week
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:09.040]  they attacked our reporters they are these little entitled punks we just got documents that we
[1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:14.560]  published yesterday that it turns out george soros is specifically funding him and bailing him out
[1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:19.760]  of jail youtube's trying to block our investigation we're actually show who bailed him out i mean
[1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:24.880]  this is really an attempt to bully us and and look we're the patriots we're the folks that are
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:29.360]  into god guts and guns and i just love all these chicken necks thinking they're gonna intimidate us
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:33.680]  so this isn't oh let's get jesse james and seal team six guys and special ops guys in here to
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:38.480]  say they're for trump it's about saying look we are restoring the republic americans of every race
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:43.040]  color and creed together but if you want to fight man you're going down a crazy road what do you
[1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:50.400]  make of all this coming out just how nasty they are oh i mean it's me the media and and all that
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:54.800]  stuff i mean i kind of know the bad side of all that more than anybody else because i live through
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:16:00.800]  a pretty horrible media shitstorm and i think yeah and you never talk about that but you've
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:05.920]  told me about it i talked to people that don't it's it's it's it doesn't mean anything you know
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:11.840]  soros and all these protesters and the women marchers and all that all that stuff is just media
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:17.280]  you know all it is it's really just business it's about money whether soros is paying for it
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:25.680]  or people or or tabloids or the left media or any of those things they're all doing it for money
[1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:31.680]  and they're all doing it for uh you know for for selfish reasons you know that you know
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:38.080]  if you think back to like you know 15 or 20 years ago when trump had like epic fights with like
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:44.400]  roseanne bar and all this stuff roseanne bar and a lot of those people attacked trump and
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:49.360]  picked fights with them purely to get media exactly and then they always started the fight
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:57.120]  it was always always totally self-serving now msnbc cnn you know meryl street all these people
[1:16:57.120 --> 1:17:03.200]  if they can like say oh trump you know trump raped a baby if they can come out and say that
[1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:08.400]  and then they get this little spike in media that it like puffs them up oh yeah i did a thing
[1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:14.240]  exactly but now this stuff doesn't make any difference to the average joe the average dude
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:20.240]  that's got to work 10 hours a day and like punch a clock and do a good job it's irrelevant and all
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:25.440]  those people got caught up in those little self-serving media spikes and got behind hillary thinking oh
[1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:30.640]  my god we can really do this look we're all we're all famous and we're so much more famous than trump
[1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:36.480]  and all he uses a reality star they don't realize that the lion's share of this country is bread and
[1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:41.360]  butter people that go and work and try to take care of their kids and try to send them to good
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:46.400]  schools and try to maybe get them into college or get them a good job that's what the majority
[1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:51.120]  of this country does and you can't turn your back on those people and that's what the media
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:57.440]  and all these celebrities and Beyonce and jz and hillary and all that's what they all did they jumped
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:03.520]  on exactly but 20 years ago 10 years ago they could still make a big lie up and push it for a while
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:08.720]  but now when they demonize you it's like the mightest touch of gold i mean and they still
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:13.600]  don't understand when they demonize trump or myself or others it only makes us bigger like
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:17.920]  matt drudge i mean they're so disconnected so looking at this atmosphere you know it's a guy
[1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:23.280]  that's got street smarts i mean how would you describe the atmosphere of the time we're in
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:30.080]  the media and the current stage of the internet is a false false sense of reality 100% so it's
[1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:36.000]  beyond technology okay look it's a false reality yeah 20 years msm is a false reality 20 years ago
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:42.560]  if i hated alex jones i had to take a piece of paper i had to break out a pen or pencil write it
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:49.200]  down i had to fold it up lick a stamp put it in an envelope envelope send it to alex jones's office
[1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:56.320]  wait two weeks maybe i would get a response maybe not if he didn't respond and i was still super pissed
[1:18:56.320 --> 1:19:02.880]  i had to write it down fold it lick it again and send it and do that all over again now with twitter
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:10.960]  if i hate alex jones i can pick up my phone and go fuck that motherfucker and all my 38 followers
[1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:15.600]  are look at that go haha yeah you did a thing to him and then they'll retweet it and then maybe
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:22.560]  2000 people see it and i get this little burst of fame yeah i told alex jones to kiss my ass
[1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:27.920]  yeah you sure did and it's a fault it's meaningless it's like a trunk full of ping pong balls
[1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:33.760]  is what it is it doesn't do anything to help your car it doesn't do anything to make it worse
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:39.840]  it's just it's like chewing gum for the eyes we're gonna skip this break it's like thin air
[1:19:39.840 --> 1:19:47.680]  it really is that's a great way of saying it but the on the other side of it you know when you base
[1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:54.000]  a hole you know trump did it right he went face to face and went to every little tiny town every
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:58.640]  little state fair every little group where nobody goes you know they had this whole agenda oh you
[1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:02.960]  got to go here and he actually brings random people up on stage face to face and met people
[1:20:02.960 --> 1:20:07.600]  and like look man thank you thank you for your support hillary did it the other way so let's
[1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:13.040]  get back to trump let's talk about behind the scenes the type of guy trump is and and just just
[1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:16.880]  why you knew he should run for president ronald reagan met him and never did this and wrote a
[1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:20.720]  letter back saying i felt like i met the president not the other way around and there's people that
[1:20:20.720 --> 1:20:25.120]  have known him 30 plus years and they knew roi cone the big anti-communist said this guy's gonna be
[1:20:25.120 --> 1:20:33.520]  president hey well i i mean tv you know i when i first met him i thought i probably had a
[1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:38.800]  predetermined notion that nah he's probably a dickhead like richie rich or something like that
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:44.960]  and that flipped around and it wasn't so much his the way he treated me and the way he talked to me
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:50.320]  it was the way he talked to the people that worked for him like the guy that's sweeping the floor
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:57.120]  or the guy the elevator guy or the receptionist or anything he get treated everybody on the same
[1:20:57.120 --> 1:21:03.040]  level and you can tell a lot about an employer or a person is how they treat the little guy
[1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:08.240]  you know there's there's people that have money that treat the little guy like you know exactly
[1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:13.200]  i know people that have known trump for 50 years and they say buddy can anybody they say he is the
[1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:18.560]  blue collar billionaire yeah can anybody look at hillary and think she really really cares about
[1:21:18.560 --> 1:21:25.120]  women she doesn't let really really he doesn't let servers at these events look her in the eye the
[1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:31.600]  rule is don't look her in the eye i mean what the hell you know and it's like i think my opinions
[1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:37.760]  valid because yeah i've i've made enough money to not work anymore but i'm supposed to be working
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:43.120]  and i'm supposed i don't employing people yeah and i have i pay all of them and pay all their taxes
[1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:48.400]  and i don't ever want to step outside of that i tried to for a little while i tried to be this
[1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:53.280]  big hollywood guy and i'm and i was and those fake people burned you and it blew up in my face and
[1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:58.800]  now i'm right back where i belong working at my shop working on my wife's race car and that's
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:02.320]  that's your wife's here she's awesome yeah she's got a lot of spark in those eyes
[1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:09.760]  shifting gears then into the economy i don't want to just sit here and glow at somebody
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:16.400]  but i go with the facts and i looked at how bad bush was how horrible obama was 10 times
[1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:21.920]  and then trump i read the news i tracked the bills i know what he's actually doing and let me tell you
[1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:26.720]  it took regan three years to turn the economy around trump in 50 days i just got chills has
[1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:32.480]  done it so much better the expert way over a thousand companies some small some big some
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:38.000]  huge are coming back trillions of investment three trillion in the stock market more than it's added
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:43.760]  in the last six seven years it's so epic and then he's battling all these lying scumbags
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:48.960]  that are just betting on the economy to go down even though it's helping them and their family
[1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:54.560]  so they can beat trump all because he loves the country and actually loves the average worker
[1:22:54.560 --> 1:23:02.320]  and is really truly 25 billion last week to black colleges obama did 4 billion and diverted 10
[1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:09.200]  billion of it to other programs no news coverage no news coverage i mean and there's a business the
[1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:14.880]  positive news doesn't sell but talking about all this other stuff that's not true that gets
[1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:21.200]  page hits on websites that gets viewers yeah exactly i put a video out about 20 25 billion
[1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:25.840]  dollars of black colleges no one cares why it doesn't sell it's a this is a business the
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:31.280]  mainstream media is a business it's it's there to make money so if cnn can fill their whole
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:39.600]  programming schedule with 90 anti-trump stuff then the advertisers and people that lean to that
[1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:44.480]  left they can come and advertise there that's it that's it and it's it's money if nobody watched
[1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:50.960]  that stuff and nobody cared and people didn't like you know it's like when we drive past a car accident
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:54.880]  your foot automatically comes off the gas pedal because you're like oh man look that's really
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:59.120]  messed up you know they just keep bringing car accidents so the more sensational thing they
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:03.600]  say it doesn't mean it's true it doesn't mean it holds any water it just it's just a business
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:10.320]  well let's expand on that it's like it took me a couple years of people saying i'm a nazi and
[1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:14.640]  saying i'm the devil and saying i'm this whole horrible person i had to look at it forever you
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:21.360]  know i had to like walk by in the supermarket aisle and see every single tabloid have a picture of me
[1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:26.560]  on the cover saying the most horrible stuff and i had to walk by with my kids and kind of put my
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:32.720]  head down and like i think it takes you have to find some kind of inner strength to like be a dad
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:38.000]  and be a good parent and walk past all that stuff with your kids and keep their eyes looking forward
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.320]  and not take it personal well let me say this you know you know probably more halloween folks
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:45.920]  than i do but i know some of the big ones and i remember back when it happened they said oh i
[1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:50.640]  know the manager that's all publicity stunt it's all pure bull this this and that and all came out
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:56.320]  later but you never even attack back we're gonna say any names it was literally all made up for
[1:24:56.320 --> 1:25:01.120]  a stunt for a movie promotion totally made up crap and then as i got more sophisticated on
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:05.520]  how the media works exactly what you're saying they just but but but it's beyond that the
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:10.320]  hollywood's collapsing the msm's collapsing used to it got the audience it still does
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:15.920]  with a certain extent jesse james but people are leaving that more and more and they just want
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:19.840]  honest news some of it's negative some of it's positive i just try to actually straight shoot
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:24.720]  people it's like trunk full of ping pong balls man none of that stuff goes in my shop and flips
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:31.600]  my welder on and starts welding for me ever so it's meaningless it's a vapor yep all right so
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:36.720]  let's end it and i think that you know it's on a small scale on what happens today but i look at
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:46.480]  all the stuff that happens now and it's it's so blatantly obvious to me how it's just for money
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:51.200]  you know i think once you twist your mind around to realize like oh that's exactly and then once you
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:57.280]  get that's how they sell magazines and page views and clicks but what i'm saying is once you get
[1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:03.440]  that trump after all this knows how it works is literally trying to transfer the wealth we produce
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:08.400]  back to us how to wealth transfer he's actually trying with classical stuff some of the some of
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:13.840]  the secret service guys you know what he's a worker he's a hard worker and that's what if my tax if
[1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:18.160]  i'm working and paying taxes and i'm paying a present i want that go ahead and tell us what
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:25.440]  what your source to say he works 18 hours a day hey obama was got in about 10 a.m every day and left
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:34.000]  before 6 p.m the guys say that he's there at 6 a.m every day since inauguration day and doesn't leave
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:39.840]  until 10 30 11 at night and that's that's going to be the day and then you know what he does after
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:43.840]  that your head down and hard work that's going to change things you know he does that for 10 30
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:49.440]  sure you talk to more than i do he goes punches up his own computer reads news watches clips
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:54.800]  and calls people like me yeah till two in the morning i mean that that's like superman that's
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:00.160]  what it's about you know this is i don't think people this isn't i did a interview yesterday with
[1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:06.000]  the really nice girl from the daily mail in england and they've always been really really fair
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:12.960]  newspaper never they're good yeah and she uh i compared trump to margaret thatcher because
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:17.040]  margaret thatcher in england there's a lot of people think she was a witch but you know what
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:22.000]  that lady got shit done and then she turned her economy around and didn't take crap from anybody
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.560]  that's what i want that if i'm going to hire a manager for a country i don't want some clown
[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:31.440]  that's going to play saxophone on the arsonial hall show i want someone that's going to work
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:35.680]  and someone that has the skills to get something done we hear about these guys that play video games
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:39.440]  for two three days and die that happened in the us just last week happens in south korea all the
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:42.880]  time and video games are okay i'm not bashing if you play video games point is don't play them for
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:47.280]  a day straight and have a heart attack trump is like playing a video game in the real world
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:53.440]  you know for 18 hours a day he loves it he gets off on it and he really wants to turn america
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:58.880]  around and deliver massive wealth of the people and that's why the elites are so pissed yeah i went down
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:05.760]  to um uh west palm beach a couple weeks ago and hung out with kid rock and uh flew into west palm
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:11.920]  and he was down there with uh with uh trump was there with the ambassador of japan and like flew in
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:18.240]  and it was like really a cool moment saw the uh air force one sitting there and then two super
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:25.280]  badass japanese 747s and like i was watching it as i was waiting for my bags i was watching it on the
[1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:30.080]  they had it on the local news him like playing golf with the ambassador of japan and i guess it's
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:36.960]  the first time an ambassador is like ever like you know did something like that because japanese
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:44.640]  culture they're pretty restrained and pretty uh you know real uh strict buttoned up yeah buttoned up
[1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:50.800]  and it was like wow isn't it kind of cool that we have a president that's like kind of a badass
[1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:57.920]  and has his own spot that he could take people to that he owns and and wine and dine them exactly
[1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:02.960]  this is not a problem and he probably got them to agree to pay us more money if you defend them
[1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:07.040]  and all that they just ordered more bomber they just ordered more fighter fighter aircraft that's
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:12.240]  how that's how it's done you know and it's awesome you like it's about having the juice to do stuff
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:17.360]  like that because obama doesn't have any oh he was so fake he wouldn't he wouldn't charm anybody
[1:29:17.360 --> 1:29:21.840]  because he was too good to ever charm anybody well they admit that trump is up almost every night
[1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:26.880]  now till midnight bowling with members of congress and all to get his agenda through i think we should
[1:29:26.880 --> 1:29:31.840]  make it a point to not talk about obama or hillary anymore that's right because they are the past
[1:29:31.840 --> 1:29:36.400]  move on you know these other guys the sore losers they're stuck in neutral and still
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:41.040]  you know cry babies because they didn't lose and we're like your wife 300 miles an hour
[1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:47.520]  blast them down the highway they were pat we we passed them like alexis jesse james in studio
[1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:55.280]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:55.280 --> 1:30:03.840]  you've heard of doomsday bunkers you've heard of secret doomsday airstrips we've now even heard
[1:30:03.840 --> 1:30:08.560]  of entire villages designed for survival in a doomsday scenario see trident lakes in texas
[1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:13.360]  but now the latest plan b marine in new york city is an emergency escape club where the elites of
[1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:17.360]  new york can join who don't have the time to come up with their own emergency escape plans
[1:30:17.360 --> 1:30:22.400]  for an annual fee of 90 000 you have access to a gps traceable boat which is a military style
[1:30:22.400 --> 1:30:26.560]  coast guard boat meant to brave harsh conditions and designed for deep ocean survival which you
[1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:31.360]  can also abandon at any time plan b marine will also plan your escape for you catering to each
[1:30:31.360 --> 1:30:35.600]  client based on their needs and location so this is just yet another story of the elites
[1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:40.000]  preparing for the worst as well as a growing market for emergency supplies and shelters with
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:44.320]  the crazy elites in power it's always been smart to have emergency plans but now that their new
[1:30:44.320 --> 1:30:49.120]  world order is falling apart perhaps the preparedness market will continue to expand in fear the new
[1:30:49.120 --> 1:30:54.720]  world order will devastatingly act out in a violent act of desperation this is oan shroyer

[1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:36.160]  stone former at the trump campaign coming on they've admitted no russian connections they have the
[1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:40.960]  house intelligence committee all of them come back out again it's just all made up but there
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:46.320]  was one communication he had with a hacker gooseifer we've talked to gooseifer 2.0 they're
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:51.520]  claiming that's a russian connection uh so he's going to publish here the next hour the exclusive
[1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:55.200]  communication he had with goose or they're claiming is this thing that trumps this russian
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:33:59.360]  and since that came up jessie james is such a character he you know he never talks about his
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:06.080]  successes billions of dollars sold just in walmart alone of his uh you know accessories t-shirts you
[1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:12.480]  name it i'm a multi-thousand there multi-thousand there and or multi-million oh seriously i googled
[1:34:12.480 --> 1:34:17.360]  it for this i want to know who is the top reality tv star because they say it's either you or donald
[1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:23.280]  trump who is it uh i don't know i guess he's the president now so that's a reality star so he is
[1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:31.280]  the like i was on a call with discovery channel last week and they told me like you're the godfather
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:37.600]  of reality tv and i was like oh man that makes me feel so old yeah but that was real reality tv
[1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:42.400]  early on then it turned into started it i mean the whole the whole pattern of tv even like the
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:48.560]  apprentice was basically the pattern that i did on monster garage and when that show started in
[1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:55.120]  like 2000 you know it it was unheard of it did they just put it out on 20 episodes on netflix and
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:59.920]  it's like all the it's it's pretty good because a lot of people i don't think have seen it you
[1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:06.400]  know discovery hasn't really released that stuff and it's on netflix and like all these people are
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:12.960]  like oh my god you made a a milk truck into a cow milker and you know it's like a whole it's pretty
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:16.720]  cool what's the one years later where you're like jumping over sand dunes and have like a mini gun
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:22.400]  shooting oh i shot up a car with a with a mini gun out of my good friend mike's dylan what was
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:25.600]  the name of that show about like you're gonna get killed what was it i can't remember oh just
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:34.160]  james is dead man yeah yeah so yeah it's giving it's crazy because now with the internet i've been
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:39.600]  really asking trump a few times i talked to him but he's got to do a fireside chat like roosevelt
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:44.320]  dead at least once or twice a week you know what he imagine he sat there in a studio and did his own
[1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:52.080]  show i think the there's so much hate being manifested online online mostly and i think by
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:57.280]  the internet where there's clearly two sides and everybody's at each other's other's throats and i
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:03.200]  think they need to realize like you know hey we're in town in austin texas right now and it's it's
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:10.160]  south by southwest and it's like you know something that you and i would never be part of just because
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:15.440]  we don't fit that mold i think me because it's totally fake you know yeah i'm not trying to be mean
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:20.400]  but you know i think it's a bunch of trendies getting scammed trying to become famous well i
[1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:26.640]  think the the people that the thing that people need to realize like there is no right or left
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:34.080]  or the liberal or everybody has to come together as americans and it's like instead of you know people
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:39.760]  are complainers let's just complain i'm gonna complain that trump won and i'm gonna complain
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:44.560]  that i think russia did it because there's no possible way that he could be successful enough
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:49.360]  to win on his own it had to be some kind of scammer trick well let's raise that since no but i'm
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:55.760]  gonna complain about it so i think instead of complaining go do something about it you know
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:02.400]  like that circle around you of people that you can help like homeless people or go to you know
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:07.280]  help disadvantage exactly don't blame trump for why you claim the world has all these problems
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:12.880]  my biggest question instead of complaining it's trump doesn't support women or trump does this
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:19.520]  or all lies or everybody did that and you know what what do you do you know what do you do and
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:26.560]  like someone kind of i made a comment and got a bunch of crap about it about the women's march
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:33.120]  that i said hey wouldn't it be great if all these women that marching if they channeled their energy
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:41.120]  and put that kind of energy and manpower to helping the homeless and and the and vets in this country
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:47.040]  and someone said like you know well what have you done for the homeless like a bunch of people said
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:51.120]  and i didn't know what stuff you're done i'm like well you know i founded the biggest homeless
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:57.200]  shelter in the city of long beach in like 2002 and put over 3 000 people in permanent housing
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:02.160]  and when i left long beach i gave my 50 000 square foot building and it became it's the
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:06.480]  long beach rescue mission now and it like you go back and all the people that asked what i did
[1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:11.440]  they all deleted their tweets oh that's like this canadian comedian on national tv a guys had brain
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:16.400]  surgery you can see it she's oh look at nazi it's a white guy with a shaved head it's like just
[1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:21.040]  throwing these names around in fact right here george soros is an admitted nazi collaborator
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:25.200]  george soros literally funds all these groups the groups that say kill cops you name it
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:31.520]  today without a woman supporters for one march 246 million from his own group he's got a bunch of
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:35.840]  other front ribs you need to get that guy to pay us for something what can we do exactly what the
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:41.360]  hell's his problem why is it not a collaborator walking around like i don't really like that guy
[1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:47.120]  but i'll take this cash what the hell exactly like a bunch of women running around with me
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:51.840]  catch we need to come up with a cause what is our cause going to be but but you're right why should
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:57.840]  you get women together to say men are the problem and we love george soros it's just it's just total
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:02.480]  division but listen you raise russia let me show you this roger stone made a huge deal of this
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:07.200]  with the inauguration they came out they said roger stone manifold ulcer they said look at this
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:13.120]  new york times january 20th the inauguration day we cover this on air they say wiretap data used
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:17.200]  to an inquiry on trump they claim they had wiretaps of trump and everybody with the russians
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:20.320]  turns out they didn't have this the house intelligence committee two weeks ago says it's
[1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:26.640]  none of it's there the democrats flip and they say trump offering no evidence says obama tapped
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:31.840]  his phones so here they are saying they were tapped we put this up behind us two of you want for
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:38.480]  but for radio listeners i mean again it's a what's your point i think arguing these little small
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:43.120]  points it doesn't mean anything i think trump's doing exactly what he's supposed to do but that
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:48.160]  they did wiretapping yeah but listen to you you're all but they're lying scum so they're
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:52.800]  always going to be lying scum that's just the way politics are well i'm not putting out articles
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:59.440]  trying to lie i know but you're missing my point it's like that's what these people do politicians
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:03.760]  is what they do they're all like they'll shake your hand and smile and take a picture oh yeah this
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:08.880]  is the greatest guy and as soon as you leave they'll grab a tv camera just like i get it i get it i
[1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:13.840]  get it that's just the way the reason msm is falling apart is we are exposing them those people fake
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:17.920]  media what those people don't work for a living i get it what they do but what do you make a
[1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:22.800]  trump better conversation going down to the jiffy lube and talking to the guys and i agree with you
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:26.880]  but but the mainstream media is starting to die and i want to see him go ahead and kill themselves
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:31.680]  when i'm saying is trump is calling him fake media trump's going after him i think it's important
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:38.960]  to bypass him completely yep i think so i he's already all i'm saying is this is a new eight
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:45.120]  we're seeing a new age and a new generation of communication by him being able to tweet
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:51.680]  and put stuff out on facebook the information is from you know his mouth to our ears and eyes
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:56.560]  there's no filter there's no idea getting yours i agree doesn't have to have a press conference
[1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:00.720]  and hope all those people are his friends and don't twist his words into something else
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:04.800]  he could put it right right and bypass them and they're having a hard time with it and the only
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:10.160]  way that they can get people to watch their crappy shows is by slamming him or making up some
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:15.520]  satan station no i agree they need trump russian why would russian hack russia hack our election
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:20.800]  for what what it's saying you didn't have the initiative to go vote for him jesse james you're
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:26.880]  a russian robot i'm a russian robot it's they're just the reason was just in denial you know what
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:31.280]  and i get it all the time and this is why i don't have anything really to come on here to talk to
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:36.960]  you about it's really that special i think but i like to come on no but i like to come on here
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:42.640]  just as a voice of the blue collar americans you know the people that think that you know
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:48.880]  because i'm filthy dirty every day and because i work i weld and i make stuff and i'm a mechanic
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:53.520]  they think i'm an idiot you know they're arrogant and they're arrogant assholes and that's the way
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:57.760]  they think about the majority of this country so i agree we're on the same page tell the elites
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:02.160]  who've got a dwindling audience who lie about our president who's truly delivering like nobody's
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:06.080]  ever done in our modern history on what he would say he would do i mean it's truly incredible
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:10.560]  it's messianic what do you want to say to the people right there in camera four that you know
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:14.080]  that think because you actually built your own business and made hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:18.480]  doing it billions total and gross that you're an idiot because they're a bunch of do nothing what
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:25.440]  do you want to say to the so-called elites no but i mean listen i get i do get stuttering angry
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:29.760]  and i get what you're saying hey be cool don't let him get to you you're already awake jesse
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:34.640]  you've already been through this i'm pissed off that we've got the best numbers in this country
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:40.640]  in decades and somebody working their ass off for the people and every major newspaper i know of
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:44.800]  says they want to see him assassinated i'm not looking for trouble but it makes me want to get
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:50.240]  aggressive i'm sick of this crap this guy's working for me and my family and i'm getting pissed about
[1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:55.280]  this i i'm not pissed about those people i think it's funny i think it's funny that they've whipped
[1:42:55.280 --> 1:43:02.480]  themselves up into a big tizzy over the working class people working hard and accomplishing they
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:06.640]  all worked hard and voted and got this the guy elected they're losers and now he's working hard
[1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:12.880]  for them you know let him cry you know i'm not going to be a sore winner there's nothing worse
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:17.920]  than a sore winner i agree but i'm just pointing out they said they had him wiretapped he's right
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:24.720]  didn't they say he's a liar a month later that's what these people do they lie i know but you know
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:30.160]  what do you what do you think happens god forbid they do assassinate trump
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:37.520]  never gonna do it man he's got we have the best protection the best elite and it's the same thing
[1:43:37.520 --> 1:43:43.120]  it's a trunk full of ping pong balls the only people that are coming out on twitter and saying
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:47.840]  like oh i think trump should get killed they're only doing that to give themselves a little bit
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:53.280]  of fame to a little bit of you know it's silly legal like oh my god did you so i agree but it's
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:58.720]  silly legal so did you see what billy 218 said he said he would kill trump oh my god well retweet
[1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:04.720]  that oh my god he deleted the tweet oh my god so i actually called that yeah but it's like it's
[1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:09.360]  meaning can we see who billy 328 is like our john doe we were actually blaming billy 328
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:14.960]  i know but it's just it's it's i bet there is one it's fluff it doesn't mean anything you know what
[1:44:14.960 --> 1:44:21.120]  i'm saying it's like jesse i a hundred percent agree you've coined the term the the nsm is not
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:26.000]  the fake stream they are the false reality media yeah like you said you said they're a business
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:31.440]  they're trying to make money so but they could do that tell them they ran if they ran 18 hours of
[1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:38.080]  of programming every day on all trump's accomplishments and everything he's done in
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:43.360]  the first 50 days and all that is that him i think you said 328 that's not yeah billy 218
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:48.400]  billy i'm sure is great go ahead and start but if they ran a whole show of that no one would
[1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:53.920]  watch it because it's not a train wreck and it's not watch it i mean if it was real data i mean all
[1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:59.200]  this real data is coming i mean i mean i get it i guess well i guess that's what our audience is
[1:44:59.200 --> 1:45:02.960]  people that actually happens if you shut your phone off and your computer off to all that stuff
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:08.160]  it does drive me crazy i'll be in a great mood i come in here and like look at a hundred articles
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:16.160]  i'm gonna jump on so you just ignore all this crap i yeah like hey i was hyper connected to it
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:21.920]  it before the election and now that we won i can sit back and like you know what i know i have my
[1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:29.280]  friend working in working his ass off in the white house for people like me and people that
[1:45:29.280 --> 1:45:33.440]  think like me and i know it's the first time because there hasn't been a president in there
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:39.680]  in a long long time that really cared about the little guy jesse james i totally that statement
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:46.400]  was you know it's a sense of uh i don't know i don't have to worry about it anymore you know
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:50.000]  that's the same and that's why i invited you on the show if a bunch of people that don't know how
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:55.520]  to weld and don't know how to fix their own car or change the flat if they're crying about it i don't
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:46:00.400]  care let them cry like that doesn't have anything to do with that's another question have you seen
[1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:05.280]  how the people that hate trump on average literally don't know how to do anything then they go beat
[1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:09.440]  people up at demonstrations get arrested we show who they really are and their arrest records
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:13.520]  they try to pull our videos down because we're showing who got arrested hey you want to go
[1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:18.480]  do this stuff you're going to get exposed i i will totally go to some of those protests
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:25.600]  and beat some protestor ass let's go that'd be the new forget reality this is fun like that said
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:30.720]  i'm we're doing it i had those first feelings that like the what was the occupy wall street
[1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:36.400]  that would have been fun just like old school the thing is all they do is beat up women you'll
[1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:41.280]  watch the crowds they'll pick a lone woman going to her car and like 10 guys go beat her up here's
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:48.160]  the thing though i mean i saw mdc riot at olympic auditorium in downtown la and it was crazy like
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:53.920]  2000 punk kids fighting and like that's a real riot all these marches and stuff that's not real
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:47:02.000]  riots it's two loudmouth crybabies or four of them with 60 cameras around them and like when
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:06.800]  you put that many cameras i knew for monster garage there's gonna be always going to be one
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:12.800]  dickhead on the build and he's he's going to be a relatively normal guy until the cameras go on him
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:19.040]  as soon as the camera goes on him he feels he has to act or perform in a certain way to be a clown
[1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:26.320]  or be a jerk and then you do that in a crowd out in the public with some protesters with 60 cameras
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:31.920]  go crazy it's explosive yeah that's not i'm there's incredible all those cameras you're a man of your
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:36.480]  word the next time there's a pro-trend rallyer and anti one we've got to go to it in austin
[1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:43.200]  oh my god five feet of that jesse james and they they're not going to do anything to you
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:46.000]  though they're just calories they go beat women up but let me get back to this key point you're
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:50.080]  racing you can fight them and kind of give them an elbow or something it's not really hitting
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:54.800]  them you know you pretend like you trip oh sorry bam like i've never done that i would never do that
[1:47:54.800 --> 1:48:00.400]  no seriously i love it just like i think i was like ah they're they'll hit you then when you hit
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:05.920]  them back bring a big boom michael moore's bodyguard hit me and then i hit him back and it's on tape
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:11.280]  he goes what the hell i'm like dude i'm gonna hit back bring a big just bring a boombox with you
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:17.760]  everywhere you go and play punk music and it just starts slamming the mosh pit yeah and they say oh
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:22.720]  man whoa i thought we were dancing play some dancing some misfits hey hey just real serious
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:26.480]  though because this is why i ask you and i appreciate you coming on and bring your wife lexaton
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:32.560]  today and the monkey is that i get it i agree we're winning the poll numbers are up the job
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:36.240]  numbers are incredible it's wonderful but this appearance was supposed to be a victory lap
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:39.520]  i know well when a month ago you said a few months ago she had let's do the bitter lap
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:43.760]  but now they're attacking you so bad this is the kind of victory lap this is like you saying boat
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:49.360]  winning the hundred meter dash and then doing his lap around and yelling at everybody that
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:54.560]  wasn't cheering for him no i get it but here's what i'm saying i get it but you know i don't
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:59.360]  feel very glorious here's the things the sorrows i never give up the sorrows i want to secure this
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:07.600]  victory it's done he's president okay all i'm saying is okay you know that our friend became
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:13.360]  president united states yes did you know and then we helped do that yes i feel good about it good
[1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:19.680]  job no i agree jesse but what i'm saying is these enemies are so evil we have to expose you want to
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:25.280]  go beat them up hey listen you're ready to go kick their ass listen listen like i said before when
[1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:32.080]  we did on the eve of the election if they had anything on trump if there was any kind of dirt
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:36.880]  it already dropped any kind of media bomb that would have been done last summer no i agree maxine
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:40.560]  waters doesn't even know that north korea wasn't attacked by putin and she she literally thinks
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:45.360]  that ppgates real but what i'm getting at is this don't you agree we've got to be vigilant and keep
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:52.080]  promoting liberty or just maybe you're right so so you wait wait you're saying you really think
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:58.800]  probs got eight years we've already won oh dude come on at the proofs in the pudding i agree that's
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:04.480]  why they're so pissed and and and i noticed even the last couple weeks it's starting to go down a
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:12.640]  little bit you notice the intensities ratcheting down remember uh she kept the break um what was it
[1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:18.720]  last friday when everything was uh going crazy about jeff sessions recusing himself and all that
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:25.520]  and come monday no one even mentioned that why is that because it's all pure baloney no what did
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:33.600]  trump do on sunday i forget what he did tweeted about obama why are tapping him oh yeah we countered
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:38.720]  it yeah and then everybody all of a sudden forgot about that's what i just raised that they admitted
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:43.520]  they did it and they and he said they say he's a liar no but friday this wouldn't even exist on friday
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:48.960]  friday it was all about sessions in russia and all that shows his power yeah he's able just to
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:53.840]  change the subject one tweet no one even remembered about jeff sessions and everything he's just better
[1:50:53.840 --> 1:50:58.720]  at manipulating the dumb media than they are no i agree but he didn't blow up over the sessions deal
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:03.440]  well he's vigilant all i'm saying is i understand you got involved in a great job you got him to
[1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:08.000]  run probably all i'm saying is i just feel like i should keep being vigilant you know just because
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.200]  we got both got daughters of their friends just because our daughters go out to a movie one night
[1:51:11.200 --> 1:51:16.000]  everything turns out okay i'm worried about all the other nights jessie all right i'm not saying

[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:10.240]  fluoride and all the garbage in the in the thyroid you've heard about the thyroid problems in women

[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:55.280]  actual informational things that aren't like garbage tv or like a two hour how to make a
[1:53:55.840 --> 1:54:00.400]  cult 911 or how to i mean you've got this thing you go in there and there's like flame shooting

[1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:17.840]  crew just put out raw on the internet and put a plug on it you wouldn't plug your own stuff
[1:54:17.840 --> 1:54:22.000]  you want to do that a million hours of footage in my archives that no one's ever seen that you
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:25.840]  could air on your network i know you told let's do it all right nobody's running this place you
[1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:28.880]  want to come have your own operation you know let's do it as long as i don't have to do anything
[1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:34.800]  except sitting like heat blast furnaces blowing metal like to work that's what i'm good at that's
[1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:40.800]  doing nothing but but i actually did have a really great conversation with discovery channel last
[1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:46.400]  week and they the owner david david zasloff who's a really good friend of mine like the ceo of the
[1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:50.960]  network he's been pushing for two years to get me back on and let's be clear you've been offered
[1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:55.280]  a million shows you're not on tv right now you've chosen like two shows a week that people want to
[1:54:55.280 --> 1:54:59.760]  be me and they're just they're just dumb they're all like you know i know we want to do project
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:06.720]  runway but with bikes and you know and you judge the bikes and i just or so tell folks i want to
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:10.960]  do something tell folks what you told me years ago tell me what you really want to do just teach
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:15.600]  people stuff and do something that's like truly informational monster garage was cool because
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:20.160]  make america great again yeah monster garage was cool because they could show it in high schools
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:25.280]  and show shop class that show and it would the kids would learn something and i want to keep that i
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:31.920]  don't want to get into like petty bickering and fighting because that's fake and you don't you
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:36.000]  don't have to force that stuff because any kind of shop or project everything drama is always
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:41.680]  going to happen and let it happen organically and that's you know jesse here don't even ask
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:46.160]  what this is just trust me it's really good for you i'm going to come over here jesse james
[1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:58.800]  red liquid here you go come on aha here you go how's that taste that's delicious that is secret
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:04.400]  12 man what is it this i said i want the very best organic mythical bottom and the people
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:08.800]  inject but under the tongue it gets almost as good as absorption as injections instead of being
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:14.000]  $200 for a bottle this big to inject we just get the actual stuff but then sell it for 30 bucks
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:18.560]  and then we dominate the entire market that this is this is what they inject but this is what you
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:24.960]  take it under your tongue it's pure organic vitamin b12 oh that's good and i get more energy off this
[1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:29.600]  that gives me butt pee i'm coming over to your house dude what is butt pee so you have like the
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:35.120]  flu it's like pee but out of your butt that's what like that's what comes out of barack obama's vagina
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:42.320]  that's just mean we did that to troll the media here let's troll the media here in the last few
[1:56:42.320 --> 1:56:46.880]  minutes what do you want to do the here's the thing i can be literally in 500 newspapers
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:50.880]  and it does nothing no traffic no real people i don't think all these big corporate sites even
[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:54.800]  have any viewers anymore jesse i think their old model of infighting and garbage is over
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:59.120]  i think you're right i think they are defeated and they need to know they're defeated they know it
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:03.200]  they know nothing's going to change and i think you want to beat your chest like a real
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:12.800]  old man we've defeated them come on here's here's you want to you are cool you are cool but see i'm so cool i'm not cool i don't give a damn yeah but here's the reality of
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:18.320]  them tv's bitch tell me that here's the reality of it it's all fake you see them headlights you see me knocked
[1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:25.120]  them curtains down sorry go ahead all the hate and all that stuff you know it doesn't mean anything
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:31.760]  because if it was all done face to face it would change a hundred percent like if if hillary clinton
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:37.040]  walked in the studio right now what would you god she looks like a corpse i think that living yeah but

[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:23.040]  broadcasting from deep in the heart of texas worldwide desi james was not born in texas but
[2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:26.800]  he got here as soon as he can and hey why did you move to texas i love the fact you're here
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:31.280]  the crazy world that you move in right next door to alex jones what do you make of that
[2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:37.520]  and it and i can shoot machine guns outside my bedroom window yeah i kind of like it wake up in
[2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:42.080]  the morning i'm like world war three is going on did you ever hear me shooting next door i'm never
[2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:51.040]  never heard me shoot no a little yeah a little bit a couple times yeah i'm joking so yeah
[2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:55.040]  what were you asking me now no no i mean i get your point that we are winning we should just
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:59.120]  be the winners be optimistic i'm worried about the losers though that are in their own parallel
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:04.640]  universe it's a very small shrinking universe but they really are freaking out and crazy look at
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:10.000]  the freaking out and crazy and all these you know like trump saying okay to the kids of the white
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:17.920]  house and saying that's a nazi symbol they now have become alex jones and alex jones has now become
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:23.840]  mainstream media like he you're you're now a legitimate news source compared to them yeah
[2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:28.480]  they're now totally making stuff up not saying i'm not not good but they would always misrepresent
[2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:35.120]  what i was saying in the media yeah i mean cobear two weeks ago had me say i'm anti-gay i said i'm
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:42.080]  not anti-gay in the club they just don't care so what do you do about stuff like that just ignore
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:48.080]  it i think they'll keep hitting that button hitting the you know the fake news extreme get
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:53.280]  get viewership button and you can only do it so many times before it doesn't well their ratings
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:57.680]  are way down they're a shadow of them former selves all our ratings are way up so why do you
[2:01:57.680 --> 2:02:01.040]  think that is and what do you think this is i think i think it'll i think it'll end i think
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:06.880]  father of reality once it stops making money and selling page views and selling clicks and selling
[2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:12.960]  viewership that eventually it'll refer back to like when we were kids you probably remember like
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:18.640]  your grandpa you know the evening news and all that stuff that's what i remember most about my grandpa
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:24.160]  he'd read the cover to cover the long beach press telegram every day and then he would like it six
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:29.280]  o'clock every night he'd kick his shoes off in his recliner and watch the evening news and back
[2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:36.880]  then it was like troops did this oil prices were that it wasn't this agenda real it wasn't so negative
[2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:41.680]  and this person did that mother it was all like human interest stuff and i think that's what television
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:48.160]  and news needs to come again you know hey we're in we're bobsledding in Sri Lanka or we're you
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:55.840]  know cover we're covering you know palm or jesse james just made another uh cult 911 you know and i
[2:02:55.840 --> 2:03:00.160]  think that's are you saying you may do a new discovery channel show uh we're talking about it

[2:05:30.960 --> 2:05:36.880]  aircraft carrier in order to display a stern show of strength Beijing will respond to america's
[2:05:36.880 --> 2:05:42.160]  strategic provocations by actioning a rapid increase in the number of china's strategic
[2:05:42.160 --> 2:05:48.400]  nuclear weapons the piece warns that if the u.s further intensifies its anti-missile attempts

[2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:19.120]  me feel like i have a duty to defend now does that come off then as if i get it that maybe the
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:23.280]  president's not that strong i've thought that before jessie james if i said her and say they're
[2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:26.960]  trying to kill him they're attacking they're trying to block him we got a supporting does it come off
[2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:31.680]  like we're weak and does that actually encourage them to attack more maybe you're right so explain

[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:51.200]  any like anybody with any kind of size that could really fight you no they're always a little wimps
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:56.160]  then what's the problem so what is it about wimps doing it then we're hearing overdrive with you
[2:09:56.160 --> 2:10:00.880]  we got roger stoke coming up we got your lunch here i appreciate you coming in but give us give us
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:04.560]  then where jessie james is at because you had some you make some great points during the breaks
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:09.840]  i think take the high road no i agree but i mean these people are i'm it i'm gonna take the high
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:15.200]  road and like find a way you said that during the break repeat what you said about trump you said
[2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:19.920]  his it was beautiful you said his so many guys like he won't say the gold on air you say great
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:24.560]  stuff on air but you you had this whole rant like his heads down he's gonna deliver he knows
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:30.720]  that's what matters let's say it say yourself trump is just he's he's he's passed it we made it past it
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:36.640]  he won the election we got him in there and now his head's down and working and he's not he's not
[2:10:36.640 --> 2:10:41.920]  you know he's he's not being letting the hecklers get to him if they want to heckle and heckle from
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:47.200]  the sidelines he's in there doing it he's in the game the game started you know and everybody can
[2:10:47.200 --> 2:10:51.600]  always be up in the stand and yell at that championship quarterback but they're not in the
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:56.480]  arena getting in there winning the game and you know what it doesn't have any effect you know god
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:00.640]  that's beautiful you're actually i'm not just that is powerful it's it's the truth you know and that
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:04.160]  guy's pretty strong and you got to know you say you're just a blue collar guy but you have those
[2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:09.280]  nuggets that are so truthful and so simple no that's it i elaborate on that because he's a college
[2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:13.840]  a little bit but my point is it's the school of reality just saying he's that star quarterback
[2:11:13.840 --> 2:11:21.120]  i think people only judge him based on modern you know the last 10 or 15 years of like the
[2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:26.800]  apprentice and sound bites and what they see of donald trump they don't you know that guy's been in
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:33.600]  business since the 70s 80s yeah and do you you imagine how much litigation how many lawsuits
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:38.880]  how many things that he's been through and how many tough people he's been up against and not tough
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:44.480]  in like i don't think politicians are tough no real real criminals no real people that really
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:48.320]  people trying to take anybody who's really been in real business knows the scum that comes out of
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:52.800]  the world anybody that's that successful there's certain people that'll just sue you just for sport
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:57.680]  you're a magnet yeah and how much of that stuff he's been through and how much of that stuff he's
[2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:04.640]  persevered through and that's built up a tough outer shell that i don't think some you know lady
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:10.160]  from msnbc calling him a nazi or whatever is going to have any justi i agree with you i get what
[2:12:10.160 --> 2:12:15.200]  you're saying it his his tough outer shell and he doesn't get to him is what the people resonate
[2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:19.600]  with and finally see the confidence so he could actually deliver the prosperity that we already
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:25.280]  had so i guess you're right my position is i'm here to rally people that these people are out of
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:29.920]  control and scum and we help rally the victory so i think it takes all different kinds to fight them
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:36.240]  listen i'll go out with you cost a hundred grand to hit someone though no i'll go to we'll go to

[2:16:10.480 --> 2:16:15.840]  models we just moved into a new building at the first of the year and uh got it all dialed in and
[2:16:15.840 --> 2:16:20.400]  we're still building bikes we'd build about two or three bikes a year and a couple cars a year
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:24.880]  only to it that's the thing i've been to your house many many times and you're you're literally
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:28.560]  you're building it this is not like your name's on it yeah i'm like it's like you're like over
[2:16:28.560 --> 2:16:33.280]  there at midnight with blowtorch i have an amazing great crew a guy no you do but you build a
[2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:38.240]  your facility in at your house yeah and so um well every time i ever come over your buildings
[2:16:38.240 --> 2:16:44.160]  right there were the bork place we bought it so it's right there and you know that stuff and then
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:49.040]  we still we're running the nra brand and really trying pushing hard to like maybe get that in some
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:54.960]  retail space and then oh god if the nra does need to get young people don't they yeah it's it the
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:59.760]  stuff is great and we're just trying to do a soft launch on it we're just did bar stools
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:03.120]  and beer glasses and everything everything made well can i talk about this i mean you're like
[2:17:03.120 --> 2:17:08.000]  the main nra representative now for all their all their loot yeah we're trying we're trying to it's
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:13.200]  been a year in and really doing a we're not trying to flood the market with a bunch of key chains and
[2:17:13.200 --> 2:17:17.520]  junk we're trying to quality real solid charts you saw i'm gonna guess but here's the thing the
[2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:20.640]  listeners need to understand that's why i've always other guest owners selling their own stuff
[2:17:21.520 --> 2:17:27.040]  it's culture what you produce is the culture i'm just a james by this crap no but i exactly but the
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:32.960]  point is is that i can do that it's a culture war though we've got to like when people wear a t-shirt
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:38.480]  or they wear a belt buckle or a cap it's it's we've got to do this to counter them yeah and i think
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:44.160]  the nra you know it's i'd be lying if i didn't know that it's a little outlaw now you know it's
[2:17:44.160 --> 2:17:48.720]  kind of super it's kind of like how west coast chopper's t-shirts were in the 90s you know kid
[2:17:48.720 --> 2:17:52.400]  kids were getting in trouble for wearing them to like middle school and stuff like that and same
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:58.560]  thing for nra and i just see that makes my eyes do doll i love when i look up you make gross two
[2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:04.880]  plus billion at walmart you're like oh no i'm nobody i'm nobody no you are now the head head of of
[2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:12.560]  the nra uh swag merchandise you know nra originals i mean take take what happened with like you said
[2:18:12.560 --> 2:18:18.000]  used to harley davison was two to one just their just their accessories made more than the bikes
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:26.640]  yeah harley at the height in like 95 their uh merchandise was 415 percent of their overall
[2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:33.280]  business four times wow yeah and so i'm kind of pushing nra in that direction for that mid 90s
[2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:39.280]  harley sure the thing where it's like you know clothing outerwear man cave assessor i like
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:44.640]  those long sleeves because i think the nra has never treated that brand like a brand like it's
[2:18:44.640 --> 2:18:49.360]  totally brand and it's total americana you know it's really mean meaningful and i think it it
[2:18:49.360 --> 2:18:55.600]  needs to skew way younger and hit a younger john wane 57 shabbies nra is americana hats like this
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:18:59.360]  look at that look that's an awesome accent people can get that right now at the nra website yep
[2:18:59.360 --> 2:19:06.800]  where do they get that at nraog.com well listen it's a culture war folks and he's saying we're
[2:19:06.800 --> 2:19:11.360]  winning yeah we got a beachhead we're under total attack i agree we're winning i mean trump is over

[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:09.680]  is in turmoil things like ebola earthquakes wars and famines are commonplace as americans we are
[2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:14.720]  largely sheltered from these events however in parts of the world just having enough food is a
[2:23:14.720 --> 2:23:20.080]  huge problem for some of us there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good

[2:24:15.680 --> 2:24:34.800]  i forgot to put my earpiece back in so niko coaster the head producer
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:42.560]  is uh hooking me up here live i got busy talking to alexis the joria and uh
[2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:47.840]  of course our husband jessie james in there it is so good to be around just real down to earth
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:54.160]  americana people that actually want prosperity and you know they're all really successful obviously
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:24:59.200]  in their own rights but you get around people that have success and then they get on each power
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:06.240]  trips against the general public but it was alexander hamilton but also was somewhat of an
[2:25:06.240 --> 2:25:10.880]  elitist but also benjamin franklin and then thomas jefferson was the big one that talks about it being
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:16.320]  the average people the the blacksmiths and the farmers and everybody else was actually the engine
[2:25:16.320 --> 2:25:22.720]  of america and how important that fire in the belly was for production and and and work and
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:28.480]  enjoying work and the fact that humans need to farm need the blacksmith need to produce
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:34.000]  need to be involved this modern society takes that away from us and so i'm so glad this interview
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:38.080]  happened today because a few months ago jessie was going to come on when trump had won about a
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:42.640]  victory lap as he'd come on the night before the election on november 7th said trump will win
[2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:46.720]  in fact i meant to get back to that with him but i forgot he said i'm totally confident and i was
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:51.520]  too because i knew internal polls uh we're showing he was ahead by new hillary plan to steal it but then
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:57.520]  his point about being confident that's why trump in fact that's why i actually called the military
[2:25:57.520 --> 2:26:01.200]  and all his other patriots start coming on to support trump he has to act confident because
[2:26:01.200 --> 2:26:05.760]  he is confident and he's busy trying to get the economy going and doing things that are textbook
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:10.320]  good for the average worker the average saver the average american no matter what color you are where
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:17.360]  you came from but i know in my gut we have to aggressively target these globalists and their
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:26.800]  minions to try to rehabilitate uh the people that have been brainwashed by this because let me tell
[2:26:26.800 --> 2:26:32.400]  you we barely won this election hillary stole five states i've had the top election experts on
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:37.760]  that are democrats exposing at bev harris she tried to steal six of the different state police
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:41.680]  groups were able to block the democrats coming in that's been in the news trying to steal it we were
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:47.760]  so close and yeah they're defeated yeah they're not popular yeah they're losing power they're losing
[2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:54.560]  power politically they're openly trying to kill the president and so i know i'm right i'm not saying
[2:26:54.560 --> 2:27:00.640]  jesse's wrong in fact i agree we should celebrate we should be happier we should because that's
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:09.600]  powerful to say we won and my god i've got a 15 page document here it's on info wars.com with
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:16.160]  just the accomplishments of the first month and are the first 50 days and it is just insane
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:21.200]  if trump had gone sideways i'd say oh my god another corrupt politician well let's just move
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:29.360]  forward with our agenda the fact that he delivered so hardcore and i studied all the presidents all
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:36.800]  45 folks this is like unreal this is so good that i don't even like i can't believe it quite frankly
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:42.480]  and then when i see the new york times lying about him and the washington post i get their
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:47.920]  liars i get their scumbags i get what jesse's saying but my kids don't know that
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:53.200]  neighbors don't know that i have family asked me is it true they
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:58.480]  trump's lying about wiretaps i'm like a month ago they said they were wiretapping in every damn
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:06.160]  newspaper i am fundamentally angry about them insulting us like we're stupid and i get that's
[2:28:06.160 --> 2:28:10.960]  who they are i get jesse went through all the lies and demonization so he just has they have no
[2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:15.200]  power over him he's done with them well not everybody's like that okay not everybody's got
[2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:21.600]  the inner strength to realize this is a lot of crap and i'm pissed man this is my future this is my
[2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:28.560]  kids future and i'm pissed but then jesse says oh i'm ready to go out and kick their ass on the street
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:34.480]  yeah i hear it not that we're trying to start a fight you watch these people beating up men
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:38.320]  women and children trying to beat people up going into the trump inauguration and then lying about
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:43.520]  the numbers cnn showing before the gates open saying no one was there that is fundamentally
[2:28:43.520 --> 2:28:50.480]  not just a lie it is an insult against anybody with half a brain and i know our audience gets that
[2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:55.840]  that's why the enemy and the globalist the msm say info wars is the trump army the teeth on the
[2:28:55.840 --> 2:29:00.640]  ground of the second american revolution with the nationalism spreading everywhere listen i love
[2:29:00.640 --> 2:29:08.640]  this thing so much i love this victory so much that yes i foam at the mouth over the fact that i
[2:29:08.640 --> 2:29:17.360]  see enemies who are enemies of themselves and that prosperity and freedom is where we should
[2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:22.320]  be going not promoting mental illness and all this loser crap i want to get ready with a roger
[2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:25.760]  stone clip you had a 45 second clip i want to play about a minute before that a minute after
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:30.960]  i'll put about three four minutes when we come back in because here we are on the 20th of january
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:35.120]  i'm saying this is fake there were no wiretaps so there were i didn't say this the new york times
[2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:39.520]  said they had wiretaps to trump now they said they never said it we have the newspaper and you're
[2:29:39.520 --> 2:29:43.920]  like okay we know they're liars well you know what i get it's like the prodigal son you're like
[2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:48.560]  why are you going after that loser he's a loser we were already awake we're going after the losers
[2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:55.280]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:59.200 --> 2:30:04.800]  liberal teachers and professors have acquired a monopoly on university jobs to the extent they
[2:30:04.800 --> 2:30:11.440]  don't tend to hire conservative leaning professors creating an echo chamber for radicalization
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:15.440]  they fail to offer a politically diverse assortment of professors
[2:30:15.440 --> 2:30:21.280]  therefore students get indoctrinated with a leftist ideology with the false impression
[2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:26.960]  that they are hearing from diverse points of view while at the same time students find themselves
[2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:32.800]  looking at conservative culture in bewilderment confused projecting onto it a false impression
[2:30:32.800 --> 2:30:39.040]  that being conservative is bigoted racist intolerant and must be stopped as this hyper
[2:30:39.040 --> 2:30:45.280]  normalized political ideology of the left continues to crumble we should expect to see further mass
[2:30:45.280 --> 2:30:50.960]  hysteria as a symptom while impressionable young people lose a false sense of security they once
[2:30:50.960 --> 2:30:56.640]  had in their unsustainable beliefs this is millie weaver reporting for info wars dot com

[2:33:40.400 --> 2:33:45.040]  jesse james who joined us in the last hour and 20 minutes was absolutely on target i i should
[2:33:45.040 --> 2:33:50.320]  savor the victory more in fact it's that victory that politically makes it safe for so many people
[2:33:50.320 --> 2:33:57.360]  that have been bullied by political correctness to say i'm americana i want freedom i want prosperity
[2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:00.960]  we're not liberals we're not conservatives what jesse said i'm not kissing his ass it's true
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:04.960]  was absolutely on target i should take that interview and edit it down to 10 minutes
[2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:09.760]  just a little nuggets he said it's true and i guess i haven't gotten to where he's yet
[2:34:09.760 --> 2:34:14.320]  at yet where you get lied about in thousands of articles a year sometimes thousands a week
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:19.520]  making stuff up about you and your family i'm still pissed off it's true i need to just somehow
[2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:26.960]  turn it loose and just ignore it sometimes but you know what i i just hate these people they're a
[2:34:26.960 --> 2:34:31.840]  pack of lying scum and you know they don't just do it because they want to sell newspapers because
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:36.240]  tell them the truth what sells newspapers i've experienced they're doing it because they're
[2:34:36.240 --> 2:34:43.840]  a bunch of bullies and scumbags but the mere fact takes money like jesse just the way the lord works
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:47.680]  who knows i move into a place six months jesse moves in next door gets to know him
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:53.120]  my daughters are best friends things go on he's like hey watch Donald Trump run like months before
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:58.560]  i heard it happens the lord works a mysterious ways i don't mean the fake lord at these fake
[2:34:58.560 --> 2:35:05.440]  churches i mean the real god of this universe but if trump would have come in and been half ass and
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:08.800]  stuff i'd say oh it's better than obama but too bad just he didn't know what he was doing other
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:14.560]  politician the fact we got the best job job numbers since 1984 the fact we got the best
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:20.560]  new business numbers small business numbers since 1984 and the media is trying to cover that up and
[2:35:20.560 --> 2:35:25.280]  lie about it the fact that he's doing everything you do other than paul ryan this horrible health
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:28.560]  bill and you know some of the people in his administration want the carbon tax well of
[2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:33.920]  course the republicans made that thing up i hate the republicans so i hate democrats pointing at
[2:35:33.920 --> 2:35:39.200]  me saying oh you're just a republican water carrier bs i hate both your stinking parties
[2:35:39.920 --> 2:35:44.080]  the republicans have some good rhetoric but they're horrible people the democrats have horrible
[2:35:44.080 --> 2:35:49.760]  rhetoric and are horrible people the difference is rhetoric with trump it's so real it's like
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:54.560]  seeing a unicorn out in the field at dawn you're like but i got a camera because there's a unicorn
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:35:59.920]  right there never knew this existed this is happening but america's a unicorn in history
[2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:04.320]  a system of prosperity and freedom that's demonized and attacked that the enemy says is no good
[2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:13.440]  but is the apple of the world's eye the shining city on that hill so
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:17.040]  just you and i years ago talk about this we're both so busy that we ought to do something
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:22.080]  because we're obviously meant to do something we're both busy it needs to happen but all of us
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:26.960]  need to take action and get involved that's all i'm saying now joining us for the balance of the
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:33.760]  hour is roger stone i was already going to call him at this morning at like 8 30 and then a text
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:37.920]  right as i'm thinking about him as i'm brushing my teeth after breakfast my kids have gone to school
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:43.680]  big breaking news i want to call on the show today so i'm like okay and it was exactly when i thought
[2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:49.200]  but not from the angle i thought here if you're a tv viewer then the new york times january 20th
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:55.680]  we'll play the clip at a moment and go to roger from january 20th wiretap data use an inquiry of
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:37:01.360]  trump aides new york times then march fourth trump offering no evidence says obama tapped his phones
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:08.640]  they were all over the news saying we have the wiretaps of manifold and uh stone everybody
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:14.480]  talking to the russians then they said oh we don't really have that we never said we had that
[2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:19.920]  so there's all this spin going on and now roger is giving us the exclusive the article just went
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:25.200]  up on info wars dot com at least i was told it's being sent 30 minutes ago we can put that on screen
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:30.960]  with exactly what happened so now i get it you talk to gucifer gucifer however you say it or
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:36.000]  we talk to dc leagues wiki leagues gucifer or people that say they are flashback new york times
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:46.160]  admits wiretaps used against trump so stone sent us the actual communique that he did have
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:50.560]  with somebody not connected to the russians but an europe uh independent european hacker
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:57.760]  but the point is this is the new level where journalists like myself or roger stone get
[2:37:57.760 --> 2:38:03.280]  reached out to by people we talk to them and then we're russians it's like saying if trump ever talks
[2:38:03.280 --> 2:38:08.320]  to putin or has a summit he's a russian presidents are supposed to meet with the russians this is
[2:38:08.320 --> 2:38:14.080]  supposed to end debate in communication but it's not about roger stone or alice jones or
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:20.560]  latimer putin or any of these people now there's the article the smoking gun aims fires misses
[2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:26.160]  timeline proves russian collusion lie that's a great headline on info wars dot com just broke but
[2:38:26.160 --> 2:38:35.360]  how about fake wiretap dis info blows wide open roger stone i mean they've but what he said on
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:39.520]  the 20th and a month before that when i put another fake story the whole 20 minute interview
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:42.880]  from right before he walked into early inauguration and like 10 30 in the morning
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:48.880]  after we battled lines of communists trying to stop us getting in absolutely shows it also
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:54.640]  will show you his real emails and texts and chats with the hacker gucifer who's never claims with
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:39:00.880]  the russians just for one point i guess is in prison let's play roger stone on the 20th saying
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:05.040]  this new york times is fake this is bull i never communicated with russians
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:13.200]  now they tried to pull back and say oh we never even really said that so this is a big moment
[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:17.600]  when roger stone the moment here it is because this is so big all the dots just connected
[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:23.040]  but he got hit with polonium months ago cdc got more than weeks ago we didn't know how to respond
[2:39:23.040 --> 2:39:27.280]  to this and put his book way behind media makes you know jokes about this like oh yeah you're
[2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:32.240]  important it's way to be polonium meanwhile dozens of congress people are on tv we've got clips
[2:39:32.240 --> 2:39:37.200]  of it we put on the show saying he's the main guy between russia and wiki leaks accusing him
[2:39:38.320 --> 2:39:42.880]  i guess putin gives you the info and the term crooked hillary and then you give it to trump
[2:39:42.880 --> 2:39:46.960]  totally made up but then he gets it with polonium and oh he's not important this didn't happen it's
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:52.800]  no big deal meanwhile just what you've surmised after weeks of trying to figure it out they
[2:39:52.800 --> 2:39:57.680]  weren't going to call him but he would then rebuff it all so they needed him to be dead
[2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:02.400]  and how do russians kill their spies polonium so you can see the whole setup the whole script but
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:06.720]  you didn't drink at all or something you're still here sometimes it takes a while to kill you uh so
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:12.080]  we hope they've failed uh but by me ronzer this is amazing so recap what you just said for everybody
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:18.160]  your statement well today page one new york times says that the central intelligence agency the deep
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:23.920]  state who just won't give up vlogging this horse are claiming that they have intercepts of email
[2:40:23.920 --> 2:40:30.560]  communications and financial transactions between the russians and the trump campaign then they name
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:38.160]  me specifically i welcome any scrutiny because it's time to put this lie this myth this falsehood
[2:40:38.160 --> 2:40:45.120]  created by the deep state to bed once and for all and is it incidental that they dropped this story
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:51.680]  on the day of president donald j trump's inauguration is that incidental no it's an attempt to destabilize
[2:40:51.680 --> 2:40:58.480]  the next president of the united states by the way uh what's crazy is all these foreign states have
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:02.560]  been caught on influence the election for hillary there's no proof of the russians and just like
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:07.520]  ppgate or just like the russians trying to turn off the power plants remember that a few weeks ago
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:11.760]  all of its lies later they admit it and i read the new york times article they always say maybe
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:16.240]  they have or they kind of do or well you know there's some of this chatter back and forth
[2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:21.600]  with no proof so you see them leaving provisos in with their fake news but unequivocally
[2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:26.640]  have you talked to any russians i've talked to no russians i also heard heard from no federal
[2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:31.120]  officials inform me that i'm formally under investigation and no one has come forward to
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:37.200]  ask me any questions but i live for that moment i can't wait all right for that moment because
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:42.000]  it's time to we've reposted the full interview in the article that roger stone has put out
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:47.600]  dealing with this but now he knows what they were claiming talking to a hacker who was exposing all
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:51.840]  sorts of stuff and wasn't a russian agent so we're gonna show screenshots of all these communications
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:59.360]  the exclusive right now with the former head of the trump 2016 campaign roger stone roger thank you
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:06.720]  alex thanks for giving me the opportunity look this is a full-out hit job we have a
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:14.960]  piece orchestrated in the smoking gun that alleges that i have colluded specifically with a hacker
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:23.680]  called uh gruesafer 2.0 there are i guess allegations that he is indeed a russian agent
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:33.520]  and perhaps he is what they miss is that i myself identified gruesafer 2.0 in a piece that i have
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:39.840]  written for bright bar on august 5th pointing out that it is my belief that it was gruesafer
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:46.560]  who actually hacked the original dnc documents at least that portion that were hacked because i
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:53.760]  believe others were handed off to uh you know as by a disgruntled employee to crave murray a
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:59.840]  british diplomat who has come forward to say that uh but i identified crucer for the american public
[2:43:00.560 --> 2:43:09.280]  and then 10 days later uh we had a brief exchange in the uh direct message section of twitter largely
[2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:17.200]  because i had commented on a twitter decision to ban him and miraculously glad to say he was uh he
[2:43:17.200 --> 2:43:25.440]  had been suspended and he was uh put back into service he was reinstated um this is an innocuous
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:32.000]  banal uh conversation largely because on twitter one does not know if the person they're speaking
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:37.440]  to is indeed the real gruesafer so all they've got is a twitter chat with someone they came
[2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:42.560]  in privilege of russian agent but to have collusion alex i would have to have a time machine
[2:43:42.560 --> 2:43:48.880]  and putin has not yet perfected one in other words my communication with this alleged russian agent
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:56.000]  happens after wiki leaks has already leaked the dnc documents and after i in my journalistic
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:44:04.960]  hat have identified uh him as a leaker this now becomes a the following headline fbi has truth
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:15.200]  of trump uh discussions with uh with russian agent uh gq raw story sadly the washington times
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:23.360]  it's a lynch mob really uh of disinformation all these kind of mainstream medias
[2:44:23.920 --> 2:44:30.640]  media outlets and other kind of lefty recycle shops are posting this ad nauseam so let the
[2:44:30.640 --> 2:44:38.640]  people be very clear the fbi uh clearly probably has this information either because they were
[2:44:38.640 --> 2:44:46.240]  monitoring uh mr gruesafer 2.0 or because they were monitoring me due to the secret
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:52.880]  fight support warrant in which the government sought and i believe got permission to surveil
[2:44:52.880 --> 2:45:01.280]  donald j trump and roger stone as well as paul manifold perhaps others uh this is the biggest
[2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:06.960]  scandal so that's watergate because they are really putting the pedal to the metal since the
[2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:13.440]  rationale for that surveillance alex has been blown apart there is no russian link and this
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:20.960]  certainly is not one so the smoking gun isn't even hot and it's not very smoking uh and i'm
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:27.440]  releasing now exclusively here on info wars the entire correspondence from this gentleman and i
[2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:34.800]  while i may look a little bit pompous the government looks foolish and you can't collude with someone
[2:45:34.800 --> 2:45:40.560]  on an event after the fact sure so all they've got is you as a journalist talking to somebody who's
[2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:46.000]  not even a proven russian agent about this but we have them all over the new york times on the 20th
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:50.720]  we have you talking about on the 20th saying they have these wiretaps then they say trump's insane
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:58.800]  there's no wiretaps i mean this is crazy no i look i i think you were uh pointed out on on this show
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:08.000]  back at the election when um the folks around david brock described me as a mvp in the revelation
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:12.560]  and revolution to elect out front that was another internal stuff that spies were able to get
[2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:18.400]  this is something i wear very proudly but alex the attempt to go after me to go after my family
[2:46:18.400 --> 2:46:25.680]  with a tissue of lies proves that these globalists swine will never stop they are never going to
[2:46:25.680 --> 2:46:31.680]  recognize the democratic election of dowry foam what we have here is a slow motion coup
[2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:39.200]  they have to be like when one has cancer cut out no no i agree like jesse james the smart guy he's
[2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:43.760]  here he thinks hey we've won you know let's be confident i agree we've won the hearts and minds
[2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:48.320]  and the great economic numbers clearly uh you know i guess the russians are making america great
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:53.440]  again no it's donald trump the american people but they are not going to stop are they ineffectual
[2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:57.760]  though what do we do well first of all i want to reiterate this because i like getting it on the
[2:46:57.760 --> 2:47:04.400]  record i had never had any russian contacts i never heard from anyone or communicated from
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:10.320]  anyone with the russian state russian intelligence or anyone fronting for them or representing them
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:15.680]  i don't like russian dressing on my salad and now i must tell you sadly i have stopped drinking
[2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:23.440]  russian vodka because of what they might say this whole thing is a canard a falsehood to smear
[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:26.960]  the president of the united states and you've never been into russian women because if you
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:33.200]  like russian women that's evil too well i i didn't mention that in my list i can appreciate russian
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:39.040]  women but i don't have a russian girlfriend mrs stone would obviously not approve so i mean
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:43.440]  listen we joke about this but they've called me a russian agent too which is just unbelievable
[2:47:43.440 --> 2:47:48.720]  and they're just going uh maxine waters who thinks russia invaded korea a few weeks ago
[2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:54.800]  she says oh pp gates real you know that they've got evidence of the sex with no proof like you
[2:47:54.800 --> 2:47:58.720]  said months ago these so-called wiretaps there's nothing there they admit there's nothing there
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:03.760]  the house intelligence committee admits it they're just still going ahead with all of this crap in
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:11.040]  the face of the best 50 day start of any president in history well alex uh what what's even uh more
[2:48:11.040 --> 2:48:18.560]  galling about the the entire situation it is this constant uh uh harangue against the president
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:25.040]  when they try to cover this up this here's what must happen uh we need an action plan and therefore
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:31.520]  i would be happy to testify for a government grand jury i would urge secretary uh the attorney general
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:36.720]  since he's accused himself uh he should arrange for a special prosecutor let someone else pick the
[2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:45.600]  prosecutor let's get mr brenen uh and mr clapper and ash carter uh and all of these folks and maybe
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:52.800]  the people at smoking gun because they seem to be in receipt of hacked material very clearly the
[2:48:52.800 --> 2:48:58.560]  fact that i had any communications with bruce for two is known probably because of the fights
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:03.840]  that happened didn't you talk about goose over on my show before yes i did we talked about it this
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:10.080]  is at the time so this whole thing is it's a setup we've we've talked to goose over but i told people
[2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:16.080]  make sure that's for the goose over you know yeah well look the hill has talked to goose over uh i
[2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:21.520]  think political has talked to goose for are they also you know hillary's talked to lucifer well are
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:28.640]  they also collaborators so uh it is uh you know i'm i'm just not taking it i'm going to crunch back
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:33.200]  uh let's shift gears for some fun relief let me see that photo you with speedos there it's off
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:37.440]  camera but i can see it let's see that photo with you in the lovely blonde the speedos can we
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:43.840]  this of course would be me and the world famous nina hartley uh a very close pal of mine in the
[2:49:43.840 --> 2:49:53.360]  camera let's tell people who nina hartley is nina hartley was one of the great um uh i'm not going
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:59.200]  to say was is one of the great porn stars of the 70s and 80s she was known for having you were at a
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:06.800]  bible study at that uh i met her at a gathering of free minded individuals in california sometime
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:11.200]  in the 70s and we're very good friends she that was all under russian command though right there
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:17.840]  was well my one of my wife and i were married in washington dc you had governor tom cain supreme
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:24.000]  court uh justice uh clarence thomas and nina hartley all at the same table and the justice
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:29.680]  seemed to know who she was oh wow but that was all russian though everybody went there because
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:34.000]  the russians were in charge of everything uh you know that is the irony of this as you have
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:39.360]  pointed out elix my politics comes from anti-communist let's skip the break this is too important keep
[2:50:39.360 --> 2:50:45.360]  going what when the russians approached me which was a very odd thing in the 80s when i was on the
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:51.920]  reagan transition team i got a handwritten letter put under the windshield of my car that said uh
[2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:57.920]  something like comrade stone you appear to be the smartest of those around trump and a man who
[2:50:57.920 --> 2:51:03.920]  understands who appreciates the finer things in life we can help each other could we please even
[2:51:03.920 --> 2:51:11.840]  reagan not from reagan pardon uh reagan yes uh and he included his card he was in attache in the
[2:51:11.840 --> 2:51:18.720]  embassy the russian embassy on 16th street and i took that card immediately to the fbi and i gave
[2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:23.600]  it to them i gave him the letter which they dusted and they said yeah this guy's been trying to recruit
[2:51:23.600 --> 2:51:30.080]  people we suggest no response but if you hear from him again let us know because i didn't respond i
[2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:34.160]  never heard from him again and do i sound like someone who would go to work for the russians
[2:51:34.160 --> 2:51:40.320]  i am poor totalitarianism i think their system is a rotten corrupt system it's no different than
[2:51:40.320 --> 2:51:47.280]  communism they suppress gays and christians and jews and women so no we're not in bed with putin
[2:51:47.280 --> 2:51:54.080]  but we are for the united states of america well that's right so let's let me let's talk seriously
[2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:58.960]  about this i want to believe jesse james that we're absolutely dominating winning out of the
[2:51:58.960 --> 2:52:03.520]  numbers show that my god this economy is just insane uh compared to what it was they're still
[2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:08.800]  trying to kill it the the jobless numbers are going down the the biggest numbers in small business
[2:52:08.800 --> 2:52:14.320]  startups stock market you know three trillion dollars uh dredgerport.com has it all posted right
[2:52:14.320 --> 2:52:18.800]  now we probably put a link up there show for tv viewers info wars has a lot of it too but
[2:52:19.680 --> 2:52:23.680]  they're just like running around like rats everywhere flipping out threatening everybody
[2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:30.720]  everybody's a russian they're on the news with no proof you know saying that all this crazy stuff
[2:52:30.720 --> 2:52:36.800]  i mean i'm not looking for attacking them but it's the law they're saying kill the president
[2:52:36.800 --> 2:52:42.960]  they're doing all this crap i mean what do we do or or is trump just transcending them i think he
[2:52:42.960 --> 2:52:49.360]  transcends them by staying completely focused on his agenda and frankly i think he has to focus
[2:52:49.360 --> 2:52:55.040]  on beginning to repel uh the impact of some of the quiz links inside his own administration
[2:52:55.040 --> 2:53:00.240]  i mean in all honesty my hat is often president that he has been so good on virtually every policy
[2:53:00.240 --> 2:53:05.360]  issue despite the fact the growing number of establishment republicans and others who are
[2:53:05.360 --> 2:53:10.960]  not loyal to the trump or the trump agenda that he has in his administration i've not been shy
[2:53:10.960 --> 2:53:16.560]  about talking about this i talk about it out of loyalty for and support for the president
[2:53:16.560 --> 2:53:22.080]  not as a well sure let's talk turkey then since you raised that roger stone we have paul ryan
[2:53:22.080 --> 2:53:28.400]  replaces obama care insurance penalties with even larger penalties and then just laughs about it when
[2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:37.440]  we have the votes for a total repeal uh we have appointees in white house push to keep us in global
[2:53:37.440 --> 2:53:43.120]  climate treaty that's just a giant turn our jobs off thing uh we've got all this going on all this
[2:53:43.120 --> 2:53:49.280]  happening i know trump's not behind that uh but yeah i mean who are the quiz links who are the
[2:53:49.280 --> 2:53:55.280]  problems what do you think trump should do to twinkle toes over there mr blue eyes mr paul ryan
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:54:01.280]  well uh first of all the good news alex is that donald trump is the ultimate negotiator so this
[2:54:01.280 --> 2:54:07.040]  bill this health care bill is he said that the tweet he said let the negotiations begin and then
[2:54:07.040 --> 2:54:12.320]  told ram paul he likes his plan yeah i mean look he wants to get something done he's not married to
[2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:17.600]  this plan this plan obviously has some flaws they could be flaws the president was not fully aware of
[2:54:18.240 --> 2:54:24.480]  um this looks to me like a a collaboration you know many cooks and and i think it is not the
[2:54:24.480 --> 2:54:29.920]  free market based plan that we need but that doesn't mean that trump won't get to that plan
[2:54:29.920 --> 2:54:36.080]  he's a tough task master but this is the first example where you can see that some who are not
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:42.720]  loyal to the agenda and let their guy their ideas creep into the action plan and that is problematic
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:48.800]  i'm going to be able to talk more about this tomorrow but uh steve manushin who was the
[2:54:48.800 --> 2:54:55.600]  trump campaign finance chairman the treasury of the the treasurer of the secretary is at an impasse
[2:54:56.160 --> 2:55:02.400]  with the white house political shop over uh the people he wants to bring to a staff of government
[2:55:02.400 --> 2:55:08.480]  who are virtually to a man and woman liberal democrats uh in some cases i'm going to identify
[2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:14.560]  a very key person the number two person he'd like to put in this department who gave money
[2:55:14.560 --> 2:55:19.920]  to hillary clinton and wasn't actually so what the hell is going on here see my gut tells me
[2:55:20.480 --> 2:55:26.080]  we got to protect trump he's proven he's good that makes me more precious but my gut tells me
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:32.560]  danger will robinson my spidey senses on i mean if i was like froto with sting the sword that glows
[2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:38.080]  when goblins are close this thing's on fire i can't help it well but i think if you pose this
[2:55:38.080 --> 2:55:43.200]  question to the president several months ago and said mr president during the campaign you were a
[2:55:43.200 --> 2:55:49.440]  critic of goldman sacks you pointed out how they had given a million-dollar secret loan to head
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:56.720]  crews you excoriated hillary forget the fact that they gave her 765 000 for a secret speech
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:02.640]  that she would not release the transcript of uh but now you have these guys from the goldman sacks
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:09.040]  in your administration he would say they're very smart guys they work for me and the agenda will
[2:56:09.040 --> 2:56:15.600]  be my agenda not their agenda well you know what as long as that is true the president's entitled
[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:20.880]  to have the men and women but the leaks go on the attacks he hadn't got control these agencies
[2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:26.080]  i don't i don't i think that's the case i think he's wrong on that well but he wouldn't be wrong
[2:56:26.080 --> 2:56:31.200]  if there were if we didn't see problems but we already see the exactly you know it's the watering
[2:56:31.200 --> 2:56:38.480]  down of the health care plan the the constant leaks show an elementary lesson of politics
[2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:43.680]  they're so arrogant they're trying they're in the news trying to push carbon taxes well now this
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:50.160]  again carbon taxes has to do with gary coan gary coan the president's chief economic advisor knows
[2:56:50.160 --> 2:56:54.800]  that the boys at goldman are essentially the receiver here they clean up in a carbon tax
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:57:00.160]  he was pushing they've invested billions in it he should be recusing himself from all of these
[2:57:00.160 --> 2:57:06.000]  discussions regarding the carbon tax but this is what happens when you have a liberal democrat
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:11.520]  who aspires to be chief of staff i might add as your chief economic advisor this guy that's the
[2:57:11.520 --> 2:57:14.640]  next thing i may have to keep you five minutes we can do it before we go to the next this host
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:19.040]  the word is like you said months ago to me probably previous the knives are out
[2:57:19.600 --> 2:57:23.440]  who who would they be moving in and i hear this democrat would be who they brought in
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:28.240]  uh that i have not heard well we were talking about the guy they're trying to get us the chief
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:33.360]  of staff here's the paradox trump's doing so good i love him but suddenly i see all this bad
[2:57:33.360 --> 2:57:38.640]  stuff being lined up well here's what you don't know if you went from ranks previous to gary coan
[2:57:38.640 --> 2:57:45.600]  his chief of staff you'd be jumping from the frying pan into the fire got it so so that should be
[2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:52.560]  avoided uh previous i think continues to make a series of errors i don't think who would you put
[2:57:52.560 --> 2:57:58.160]  in there as the chief of staff well if i named the person i wanted that would probably get the
[2:57:58.160 --> 2:58:03.200]  long knives out from some of our enemies and do their chances so i'm not going to play my cards
[2:58:03.200 --> 2:58:10.240]  on national law i got it wars but there are many fine quality men and women ed martin's been on this
[2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:17.120]  program ed martin uh was the uh chairman of the missouri republican party uh he was the republican
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:23.280]  candidate for attorney general he was counseled to pope paul john john paul he was counseled to the
[2:58:23.280 --> 2:58:31.280]  saint uh louis archdiocese he was the chairman of the st louis elections board he lost narrowly lost
[2:58:31.280 --> 2:58:35.280]  the attorney general sure the tea party loves him stay there i mean let's come back though and talk
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:43.120]  about where trump is on friday the tenth day of march 2017 because results everything's happening
[2:58:43.120 --> 2:59:03.440]  but then who he's got a round name is the scariest hell stay with us folks info wars dot com
[2:59:13.120 --> 2:59:16.960]  the market you said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing for years
[2:59:16.960 --> 2:59:20.800]  people that currently are tested for us they didn't just say outstanding what they really say about
[2:59:20.800 --> 2:59:25.680]  they want to know how do they get it where do they find it a lot of my law enforcement official
[2:59:25.680 --> 2:59:31.440]  buddies want to know the same thing the backpack body armor is only two hundred dollars i mean

[2:59:46.880 --> 2:59:54.240]  four store dot com it's amazing you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:54.240 --> 3:00:10.080]  oh crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[3:00:11.760 --> 3:00:16.400]  all right we got leon and oh and shroyer coming in to take over in the fourth hour project
[3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:20.160]  on six three minute breaks he's he's gone from a camera build back in a minute
[3:00:20.160 --> 3:00:26.000]  i would love to be in the opposition position here and just be able to bitch about trump all day
[3:00:27.760 --> 3:00:31.840]  i studied the politics i know what's going on i've never seen in modern times
[3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:40.400]  of hell not since towards washington or andrew jackson andrew jackson's last time i've seen
[3:00:40.400 --> 3:00:44.880]  anything like this andrew jackson of course the president models himself after jackson what does
[3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:49.520]  that sound like people that haven't studied the history i'm just speaking chinese or greek or
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:56.880]  space alien to you but it's outrageous that the american people who are against trump
[3:00:56.880 --> 3:01:02.080]  don't know how he's doing things the elites don't want to empower you that's why they're so pissed
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:10.560]  it's 101 and then all this stupid russian crap all day it's ridiculous so roger just in closing
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:14.960]  where would you say the american revolution the second american revolution is right now
[3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:22.320]  populism is exploding globally we are winning on so many fronts i just i can't believe being informed
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:25.760]  watching these anti-trump people physically assault everybody all over the country
[3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:32.320]  i just i just i just i don't know what to even do at this point because i just have this feeling
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:37.120]  that if we don't do something we're gonna lose everybody just says sit down and relax alex
[3:01:37.120 --> 3:01:41.360]  we're winning maybe i'm wrong maybe i can just take a vacation what do you think no i don't think
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:46.000]  that at all i think as don trump said after the election our fight has just begun the entrenched
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:51.360]  and corrupt influences have been running this country for 30 years are not just going to walk
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:56.080]  away from the swedish oh they think they own us it's the entitlement that makes me angry well
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:02:01.200]  and the fact that while they have promulgated policies that make the people poorer and less safe
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:07.680]  they and their cronies have gotten fabulously wealthy there is there's the my central objection
[3:02:07.680 --> 3:02:15.360]  to this whole particular situation now alex think about it uh they said that out that
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:23.120]  indra jackson was crude vulgar ignorant poorly informed they said that theodore roosevelt
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:30.480]  was an egomaniac a lightweight a self-promoter do these things sound familiar yes you cannot
[3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:36.400]  judge this president this is what they say about mavericks that expand the united nate of the united
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:43.440]  states and empower the people yeah so you have a free thinker in trump who isn't connected in any way
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:49.200]  to the bad decisions of the last 30 years that have drunk driven the country into the ditch
[3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:56.400]  but at the same time we know that those who control the country and the neocons they will break the
[3:02:56.400 --> 3:03:02.720]  law they will murder they will steal they will wiretap they will eavesdrop they will threaten
[3:03:02.720 --> 3:03:08.480]  people they will do anything to protect what has been a very exactly and i want to i want to physically
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:14.720]  but also politically stomp them in the ground so what do we do well i do think that the counterpoint
[3:03:14.720 --> 3:03:20.640]  of these demonstrations has to be shown across the country i think it is important that trump
[3:03:20.640 --> 3:03:26.240]  supporters and americans who support this agenda this agenda rally across the country we're in the
[3:03:26.240 --> 3:03:31.440]  bottom of our lives i absolutely but i agree with jesse james we should celebrate the victory as well
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:36.160]  i mean look at the delivery on jobs man isn't that something to talk about well i think that's true
[3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:41.680]  but you know good news gets drowned out i think they've taken to the streets we must go to the
[3:03:41.680 --> 3:03:47.760]  streets let's show them that we outnumber them as we did in this election i agree jesse said it next

[3:04:26.640 --> 3:04:31.840]  i think it's just got like an aura to it yeah well at least it's all handmade by some poor person
[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:37.840]  who was not in uh Panama but in Ecuador because Panama hats was kind of a brand name but the
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:43.680]  finest hats were made in uh in Ecuador you can crush this hat and throw it in the bag and it will

[3:19:35.120 --> 3:19:39.680]  timely piece well i'm gonna slip in some serious news while we're making jokes with leand's women
[3:19:39.680 --> 3:19:44.560]  t-shirt she's gonna start she's gonna start protesting here but speaking of protest now
[3:19:44.560 --> 3:19:49.440]  we've got the george soros funded women's marches going on you know they're going on everywhere
[3:19:49.440 --> 3:19:56.160]  and you've got linda sarsour who by my estimation this is my opinion i think she is a deep agent
[3:19:56.160 --> 3:20:01.520]  possibly of hamas i think that when she's been linked to it reportedly and i think that when
[3:20:01.520 --> 3:20:05.840]  she's taking these pictures and making these social media posts it is some of the most i mean
[3:20:05.840 --> 3:20:11.440]  honestly just it's super creepy to have a sharia law muslim uh forced from the left there with
[3:20:11.440 --> 3:20:17.360]  gloria steinem telling women that islam's the way to go i mean what i feel like i feel like the
[3:20:17.360 --> 3:20:22.160]  thing that i wake up in exactly i feel like deep down we're not putting any bag over leand's head
[3:20:22.160 --> 3:20:27.280]  no i mean and the story that you put over here is that one the yeah oh one will wear it to be to
[3:20:27.280 --> 3:20:31.840]  show equality and support for strong women's free the new way how about the muslims make the
[3:20:31.840 --> 3:20:37.280]  men wear hoods over their heads huh exactly well and that's story that you got earlier the story
[3:20:37.280 --> 3:20:43.280]  that that you brought up earlier with the woman who is being forced to have um a virginity test
[3:20:43.280 --> 3:20:47.920]  there at the ua e because they found out that she was pregnant before marriage let's say that again
[3:20:47.920 --> 3:20:52.320]  if you're a if you're a woman and you're in a muslim country and you're pregnant they come in
[3:20:53.200 --> 3:20:58.160]  see of the you know who the daddy is i mean talk about if you're not married no it gets it's
[3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:03.760]  alex it's worse than that this is a ukrainian woman and she's there with her fiance who is
[3:21:03.760 --> 3:21:09.440]  from south africa and she goes to the doctor and the doctor because she's pregnant and the doctor
[3:21:09.440 --> 3:21:15.520]  says you're not married and then turns her into the police and so now she's in jail this ukrainian
[3:21:15.520 --> 3:21:21.840]  woman and they're forcing her to undergo these tests so that they can determine when she lost
[3:21:21.840 --> 3:21:28.720]  her virginity i mean insane she's not even like an islamic woman under it's a call you should
[3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:34.160]  there's no travel advisories warning people to not go there yeah and they also love these muslim
[3:21:34.160 --> 3:21:38.000]  countries they get a woman tricked to move there then they literally put her in like handcuffs and
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:42.480]  chain her in a closet then they rule that's all okay i'm done with this crap that i gotta hear

[3:28:02.400 --> 3:28:06.240]  going to do a special documentary on her tonight they're building this thing how do you think that's
[3:28:06.240 --> 3:28:10.480]  going to go she's like a awesome first lady and they're going to attack her at every turn no no
[3:28:10.480 --> 3:28:13.760]  here's what here's what cnn is going to do i guarantee it they're going to they're going to
[3:28:13.760 --> 3:28:17.120]  they're going to build up her background they're going to build up donald trump's background and
[3:28:17.120 --> 3:28:21.680]  they're going to make it out like oh look at how she was this fashion model and she but they'll act
[3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:25.760]  like they're glorifying it while really they're just trying to make a like a side swipe exactly like
[3:28:25.760 --> 3:28:30.640]  oh she's really just a nasty woman like when they're up here saying i'm a nasty woman i mean
[3:28:30.640 --> 3:28:37.680]  bless her heart so so she's actually at a uh children's hospital in washington dc march
[3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:42.880]  first and she's speaking to these kids and parents uh families about the gift of nature
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:46.960]  and the beauties of the outdoors how they can contribute to the healing process so like really
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:52.160]  saying you know get out nature enjoy get some fresh air well now the nature wait is she promoting
[3:28:52.160 --> 3:28:56.960]  nature yeah did nature pay her to do that like subway yeah michelle obama oh but see and this is
[3:28:56.960 --> 3:29:02.480]  like the left who's all about nature and wants to destroy big pharma and like down with this and and
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:06.560]  but now they can't they have to be anti-nature because they're saying that melania trump is
[3:29:06.560 --> 3:29:11.680]  basically saying let them eat cake because my husband's gonna take away your health care so go
[3:29:11.680 --> 3:29:16.160]  out in nature and get some sunlight not what she's saying at all obviously but these are this is the
[3:29:16.160 --> 3:29:21.920]  left who's like out there marching in front of the white house today about the the pipeline
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:26.480]  and everything but now they're they don't like the advice the first lady gives to get some fresh air
[3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:32.320]  and stop using so many pharmaceuticals it's donald trump donald trump could cure cancer
[3:29:32.880 --> 3:29:38.320]  and the democrats would be mad that he ruined their obama care right that's the nature that what
[3:29:38.320 --> 3:29:42.240]  am i supposed to do with my obama care now i don't have cancer anymore well it is national
[3:29:42.240 --> 3:29:45.760]  women's month so we have leanne on the show and i've got a story about women on the other side

[3:29:53.360 --> 3:29:57.680]  the gcn radio network
[3:29:59.120 --> 3:30:04.720]  liberal teachers and professors have acquired a monopoly on university jobs to the extent they
[3:30:04.720 --> 3:30:11.280]  don't tend to hire conservative leaning professors creating an echo chamber for radicalization
[3:30:11.280 --> 3:30:17.040]  they fail to offer a politically diverse assortment of professors therefore students get
[3:30:17.040 --> 3:30:22.880]  indoctrinated with a leftist ideology with the false impression that they are hearing from diverse
[3:30:22.880 --> 3:30:28.800]  points of view while at the same time students find themselves looking at conservative culture in
[3:30:28.800 --> 3:30:34.960]  bewilderment confused projecting onto it a false impression that being conservative is bigoted
[3:30:34.960 --> 3:30:41.360]  racist intolerant and must be stopped as this hyper normalized political ideology of the left
[3:30:41.360 --> 3:30:47.920]  continues to crumble we should expect to see further mass hysteria as a symptom while impressionable

[3:34:01.280 --> 3:34:08.560]  not alex jones uh so it is uh that we had national woman's day this week and i've got some news on
[3:34:08.560 --> 3:34:16.320]  women i thought i'd cover here with leon macadoo in studio first let's go to an old story now in
[3:34:16.320 --> 3:34:22.800]  1979 of course we know what's going on with the george soros uh funded women's marches all these
[3:34:22.800 --> 3:34:27.600]  women are marching all over the place marching for rights that they already have obviously
[3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:31.840]  it's really just an anti-trump march paid for by george soros to divide and conquer this country
[3:34:31.840 --> 3:34:36.560]  but let's rewind the clocks back oh yes and then you got linda sarsaur injected in there as well
[3:34:36.560 --> 3:34:40.480]  who takes pictures with the infidels that she sends back towards her her boss friends getting the
[3:34:40.480 --> 3:34:47.040]  women crying as they put the hijabs on in in celebration and chanting allahu akbar but let's
[3:34:47.040 --> 3:34:53.760]  go back let's let's rewind the clock backs to 1979 the day a hundred thousand iranian women
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:35:00.000]  protested the head scarf that's right folks a hundred thousand iranian women took to the streets
[3:35:00.000 --> 3:35:06.320]  and marched in protest of the hijab in protest in protest of the head scarf you know why
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:12.400]  because it represents women's oppression and they've completely changed it around now and
[3:35:12.400 --> 3:35:18.880]  manipulated people's minds and tell them no this is you know showing how righteous you are and that
[3:35:18.880 --> 3:35:23.520]  you want to cover yourself up it's a spiritual thing it's not oppression so we're not going back
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:28.320]  to the olden times by oppressing you we've also got some video i don't know if you guys can pull
[3:35:28.320 --> 3:35:34.800]  the video of it but you can have see video here of the iranian women in 1979 marching against the
[3:35:34.800 --> 3:35:40.400]  head scarf marching for marching against actual women's oppression it's an amazing thing to see
[3:35:40.400 --> 3:35:47.360]  and then now in america what do we have george soros funding women to go march for what they
[3:35:47.360 --> 3:35:51.920]  believe is women's oppression when really they have no idea the first thing of women's oppression
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:35:58.560]  if they did they wouldn't be marching for a woman who stands for sharia law but they are
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:04.400]  no just incredible and then of course we had hillary clinton climbing out from under her rock
[3:36:04.400 --> 3:36:08.720]  a couple weeks ago to put out this video to the dnc and say we must keep fighting we must
[3:36:08.720 --> 3:36:15.040]  keep resisting i'll be right there with you well honey they are not with her once again
[3:36:15.040 --> 3:36:20.800]  people did resist you on election day but they had a day without a woman a day without a woman
[3:36:20.800 --> 3:36:27.920]  president thank god that they they released a poll on the on tuesday of this week former secretary
[3:36:27.920 --> 3:36:32.960]  of state hillary clinton didn't perform well in the latest poll in the new york city's mayors race
[3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:37.680]  so they still don't even want you to be mayor of new york and actually they reenacted
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:43.360]  some of the debates between hillary clinton and donald trump and they switched the gender roles it
[3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:47.920]  was a woman saying all the lines that donald trump said and a man saying all the lines that
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:53.680]  hillary clinton said and also kind of mimicking some of the body gestures and people actually liked
[3:36:54.240 --> 3:37:00.080]  trump's responses more when they were given by a woman so there you go people are not with you
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:04.960]  they're not with the brainwashing but it's interesting you bring up linda sarsour and these
[3:37:04.960 --> 3:37:10.880]  women's marchers because linda isor let's go let's call her linda isor because uh hillary clinton
[3:37:10.880 --> 3:37:17.920]  linda isor was arrested okay go ahead sorry linda hillary clinton's former running mate tim cayne uh
[3:37:17.920 --> 3:37:25.440]  oh got some tim cayne his son heated hillary's call to continue resisting and he was actually
[3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:30.720]  arrested so he was arrested this week and he's totally looks like antifa and it's funny in this
[3:37:30.720 --> 3:37:36.640]  article they point out how uh woody cayne is one of three children of tim cayne and his wife
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:42.160]  an older son nat a marine serving overseas was more visible during the presidential campaign
[3:37:42.160 --> 3:37:48.000]  so woody is the the black sheep of the family they didn't want to roll him out to say here's my son
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:53.920]  i'm sorry they only wanted to show his marine son so again perfect perfect example though the antifa
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:37:58.000]  kids with the daddy issues just tim cayne you know his daddy didn't love him enough didn't
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:02.560]  want to roll him out during the election and so he had to go throw some smoke bombs and light
[3:38:02.560 --> 3:38:08.480]  off firecrackers at a protest inside the capitol building oh boy i'm glad he's not the vice president
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:15.760]  too gee oh lord you mean the grinch awful yeah uh do you guys have the uh video of the marine
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:21.280]  lapen rally ready to go i'd like to go to this video so marine lapen is now i guess she's starting
[3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:27.040]  to hold presidential rallies the france presidential race is coming up and you know they're trying to
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:30.880]  stop her from running they're gonna put her in jail if they can do anything to quit to keep her
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:35.680]  from running but let me know when we have this video ready to go you might be able to get uh here
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:42.480]  in this camp okay so guys go ahead and roll this video this is a video from marine lapen's rally
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:50.080]  in france check this out this is quite incredible look at this does that not look like a donald
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:55.840]  trump rally it's like a trump rally look at this thousands of people all waving french flags standing
[3:38:55.840 --> 3:39:02.560]  and cheering huge audiences this is why george soros is funneling so much money into google another
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:07.680]  sort of french uh computer network in that guys that's just so powerful let let people see what's
[3:39:07.680 --> 3:39:11.920]  going on in france right now this is marine lapen's rally footage this is incredible go ahead leahan
[3:39:11.920 --> 3:39:18.160]  they're trying so hard to shut down what happened here and also with brexit they're trying to shut
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:22.480]  it down from happening in france as well as germany so they're really trying to control the
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:29.040]  optics there control the internet um disconnect people's access to free sites free information
[3:39:29.040 --> 3:39:33.920]  sites like info wars uh and others because they want to control the optics they want to just say
[3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:38.480]  marine lapen she's they're gonna do it just like they did with all the trump rallies and say no one
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:44.000]  showed up but um a brorious crowds at the other candidate this is obviously a huge crowd huge
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:48.640]  crowd and it's obviously that people are very upset about you know what's happening in their
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:53.040]  country yeah look again look at this b-roll this is just so powerful right here to me because
[3:39:53.920 --> 3:39:59.360]  it shows you how this is truly a worldwide revolution and they want to sit here and they'll
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:05.840]  they'll paint nationalists as the separatist party or as you know the curmudgins who just
[3:40:05.840 --> 3:40:12.560]  they want to be isolated no we just want to put our own people first we want our land our country
[3:40:12.560 --> 3:40:18.560]  our lineage our history to be something that we take pride in and that we want to protect it's
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:22.960]  really not that crazy of a thing and so that's why i mean you're gonna see this all over you're
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:26.400]  gonna see this in italy you're gonna see this in france you're gonna see this in germany you're
[3:40:26.400 --> 3:40:31.120]  gonna see this in brazil you're gonna see the same thing that you just saw in america with trump
[3:40:31.120 --> 3:40:38.320]  rallies for all of these new nationalistic um populism you know these types of candidates who
[3:40:38.320 --> 3:40:43.600]  just want to put their country first who are not gonna cater to open border policies they're not
[3:40:43.600 --> 3:40:49.040]  going to kowtow to the the bullying of the globalists right and this is what you get you get thousands
[3:40:49.040 --> 3:40:53.280]  of people waving flags at your rally right i mean when you have people living in paris who are
[3:40:53.280 --> 3:40:57.040]  afraid to go out on the streets because there's constantly riots and the police are getting
[3:40:57.040 --> 3:41:02.400]  beat up and cars are getting lit on fire and fireworks and things like that from tolerant left
[3:41:02.400 --> 3:41:06.640]  yeah i mean the paris is completely different they'll be your girlfriend out in the street they'll
[3:41:06.640 --> 3:41:11.120]  beat your wife but they love women though yeah you can't even go if you're a woman you can't go
[3:41:11.120 --> 3:41:16.320]  unaccompanied into certain starbucks in certain neighborhoods because you can't go in there at
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:20.560]  the same time other men are there and it's like well i know you don't want to go into a starbucks
[3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:24.640]  during an antifa rally either you're you know you're gonna get the windows smashed in on your head
[3:41:24.640 --> 3:41:29.040]  that's true you got to watch out for that yeah well that's the thing you see your whole country
[3:41:29.040 --> 3:41:36.000]  dynamic change speaking of police as we take a turn here from the women's story there's actually
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:44.320]  a new robot police i'm gonna try to find this story did you see this leon it's no r2 d2 but
[3:41:44.320 --> 3:41:50.800]  night scopes crime fighting robots aid police so maybe they'll go into those no go zones maybe it'll
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:55.760]  go into the no go zones there's a few of those in america not because of well maybe because of
[3:41:55.760 --> 3:42:02.240]  immigration but not like in europe but we've seen the robots that go in in situations like we saw
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:08.240]  in dallas with the with the cop shooter um that are more heavily armored but it looks like this new
[3:42:08.240 --> 3:42:12.960]  robot is going to be more of kind of just a pal a patrol yeah more of a patrol guy that just kind
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:18.240]  of just rolls around the streets and you know i'm just curious what the people would think about this
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:23.600]  because we've had such even with even my own self inside even info wars i think we have to admit
[3:42:23.600 --> 3:42:29.920]  that yeah look at the little guy it's kind of cute i know he's kind of cute i am robot i am here to
[3:42:29.920 --> 3:42:35.360]  protect daily tasers you could just like push him over with and then like you up and now going in
[3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:38.960]  this self-destruct of course that's what they would like to do is make these things friendly so you
[3:42:38.960 --> 3:42:43.920]  just accept them but it is interesting you know with everything that's happened the war on police
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:50.640]  reaching ahead all these violent protests in the streets it's kind of forced myself and i think
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:55.600]  that info wars included to kind of i don't know i mean speak for yourself obviously kind of retract
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:43:02.320]  not necessarily the policies that we've spoken against with police but just the police in general
[3:43:02.320 --> 3:43:07.360]  just to remember that the police are citizens too we're on the same team as the police and if
[3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:11.280]  we're going to complain about the police or the police tactics we need to look at the war on drugs
[3:43:11.280 --> 3:43:15.200]  right we need to look at how they're trained and we need to look at how they're treated in the media
[3:43:15.200 --> 3:43:20.160]  and that's a it's like a four-headed monster to try to tackle but now on top of that now we have
[3:43:20.160 --> 3:43:25.920]  to also have the discussion on top of all of that they want us to now include include into the
[3:43:25.920 --> 3:43:30.240]  discussion should we be putting robots into the police force so we've already got all of these
[3:43:30.240 --> 3:43:35.040]  problems with the police and now they want to inject this into the conversation maybe they
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:40.480]  think that they can essentially just roll out the human police force and then bring in the robots
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:44.880]  and so we already have to do that with the army if we have we already have these tech giants and
[3:43:44.880 --> 3:43:48.800]  then Stephen Hawking saying we need to create a world government otherwise ai is going to kill
[3:43:48.800 --> 3:43:54.880]  us all but we have everyone saying you know how dangerous ai is but full speed ahead look at right
[3:43:54.880 --> 3:44:00.640]  look at what we've just known with just the little drip of the first vault seven so are these robot
[3:44:00.640 --> 3:44:06.160]  police hackable just like with the cars can the cia take over the robot police or you know any kind
[3:44:06.160 --> 3:44:12.000]  of rogue hacker nation out there can they take over these robot police and just have them wreak havoc
[3:44:12.000 --> 3:44:16.400]  i mean we need to start thinking about these scenarios before we just roll them out onto the
[3:44:16.400 --> 3:44:21.120]  street yeah and the other thing too i mean remember technology is not infallible if anything
[3:44:21.120 --> 3:44:25.440]  technology is a nuisance i mean how many times are you dealing with a cell phone or a computer
[3:44:25.440 --> 3:44:30.640]  or a printer or a fax machine and you just want to punt it yeah so you got to think about that too
[3:44:30.640 --> 3:44:35.360]  and now you're talking if you're about talking about giving a robot the authority of a police
[3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:41.760]  officer taser oh hi there wielding robot like oh crap what just happened malfunction yeah and then
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:45.600]  of course you know what are you gonna do suit night scope i bet that they have some sort of
[3:44:45.600 --> 3:44:50.000]  government workings that they can't get sued for activity like that so this is just an interesting
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:54.720]  thing that people need to certainly debate about instead of just having a police force roll out an
[3:44:54.720 --> 3:44:59.200]  r2d to robot near you let them know if you want your tax dollars going there i don't think that this
[3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:04.480]  is coming to any streets near you anytime soon but as we've seen all the stuff alex has been talking
[3:45:04.480 --> 3:45:08.640]  about over 20 years eventually comes true that's how this stuff works it gets rolled out over time
[3:45:08.640 --> 3:45:14.080]  and time want our lifetime the lifespan of a human is the blink of an eye on a history landscape
[3:45:14.080 --> 3:45:18.160]  and so this is something that they're obviously getting ready to roll out here's another thing
[3:45:18.160 --> 3:45:22.560]  that alex jones has talked about they're getting gonna roll out and they've made movies about this
[3:45:22.560 --> 3:45:27.120]  as well so basically if there's a science fiction film about the future you know it's coming at some
[3:45:27.120 --> 3:45:33.840]  point for the first time ever scientists have edited the genetic makeup of viable human embryos
[3:45:33.840 --> 3:45:40.080]  so our genetically edited future is nice so these are chinese researchers uh they've been at the
[3:45:40.080 --> 3:45:45.120]  forefront of experimenting with human embryos using a technology called crisper and they're
[3:45:45.120 --> 3:45:50.720]  improving on the results year after year so far they've only been using non-viable human embryos
[3:45:51.360 --> 3:45:56.880]  but now they're saying look we can do this with a viable embryo so we can take out diseases which is
[3:45:56.880 --> 3:46:03.040]  you know okay sure yeah but they can also do designer babies and yeah if you can take out a
[3:46:03.040 --> 3:46:09.040]  disease you can insert a disease too yeah like a docile nation or you know nation that's not
[3:46:09.040 --> 3:46:14.240]  uh they're just a little robot worker bees we don't need any more ingenues to be born any more
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:19.200]  brainiac i'm trying to yeah right these people are too smart for humanity i see
[3:46:20.400 --> 3:46:25.760]  i'm trying to understand the mindset i've not had kids i'd like to have kids one day
[3:46:25.760 --> 3:46:31.280]  but i'm trying to understand the mindset of somebody who's you know thinking about starting
[3:46:31.280 --> 3:46:35.920]  a family or thinking about having a kid and they're like i want it to be perfect i want this in every
[3:46:35.920 --> 3:46:41.840]  little detail i what yeah mostly you just you just want a healthy baby to kind of like what
[3:46:41.840 --> 3:46:47.520]  happy with whatever happens but now it's like no i just want to design it just like i designed my car
[3:46:47.520 --> 3:46:52.560]  my house it has to be this color and it has to be this curly and the eyes have to be this color and
[3:46:52.560 --> 3:46:56.000]  they have to be this tinted and this and the other thing it's like it takes away the magic
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:47:00.800]  exactly you're just you're just making a beer essentially making a baby in a lab i feel like
[3:47:00.800 --> 3:47:06.640]  at this point what happened to like the the act of love that created life now it's just oh let's go
[3:47:06.640 --> 3:47:12.560]  to a lab right that will be our child and then of course editing out the sims well some people
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:16.960]  oh whoa i just touched on a nerve there with leann she thinks we actually are living in the
[3:47:16.960 --> 3:47:20.560]  summer we're gonna go to break so let's wait until you go there thanks for in the sims okay go
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:25.520]  ahead well i mean it's just like with vaccines and everything how they're able to uh take away
[3:47:25.520 --> 3:47:30.720]  some diseases but then more virulent forms of that disease will rise up so what's gonna happen
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:36.080]  if they're able to edit out diseases which you know i think that's great sure wonderful but then
[3:47:36.080 --> 3:47:42.640]  what's kind of i mean evolution it just it has nature has a way of kind of filling in the holes
[3:47:42.640 --> 3:47:46.800]  that you create and they actually complained about that how pissed they are that the cancer
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:47:51.520]  vaccines haven't been more effective because we've actually in some way shape or form evolved to
[3:47:51.520 --> 3:47:56.400]  survive them but it's funny actually you know when uh i was talking with eddie bravo when he
[3:47:56.400 --> 3:48:00.800]  was here this week a lot of a lot of friends and family ended up watching that stuff because
[3:48:00.800 --> 3:48:04.800]  it was so crazy it was not the typical stuff so they were like oh okay i'll just watch this
[3:48:04.800 --> 3:48:13.360]  entertaining but the points that eddie brought up about the hep b vaccine got more people to
[3:48:13.360 --> 3:48:17.120]  look into vaccines than i think i have ever done and i've and i've been telling my friends and
[3:48:17.120 --> 3:48:22.320]  family about vaccines for years and it falls on deaf ears to most of them um the health nuts in
[3:48:22.320 --> 3:48:31.040]  my family i'll get it but it's weird because i'm just it's like it's so obvious to me you know it's
[3:48:31.040 --> 3:48:39.760]  so obvious it's like hep b a newborn baby hep b shot no or h pv and that's what i'm saying so
[3:48:39.760 --> 3:48:43.680]  people don't even think like why they don't even put it down they don't even they don't even process
[3:48:43.680 --> 3:48:48.160]  it in their heads they're just like oh yeah it's normal just needle needle needle like oh that's
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:52.400]  just normal it's like okay this is happy this is this is it they just put it all in together and then
[3:48:52.400 --> 3:48:57.280]  you slow down and you stop for a second and you're like look at look at each vaccine and you say okay
[3:48:57.280 --> 3:49:02.320]  this is hep b why would i take this shot why do i need this shot what's in this shot is that if your
[3:49:02.320 --> 3:49:06.880]  baby you know might need some sort of a blood transfusion which can happen so then you want to
[3:49:06.880 --> 3:49:11.680]  just get it to where it's gonna have but the thing is like you say these individual vaccines why in
[3:49:11.680 --> 3:49:17.920]  the heck does a newborn baby need an h pv vaccine i mean what do they tell you well you're so it's for
[3:49:17.920 --> 3:49:23.280]  later in life later later well then i'll get later in life you freak exactly not when it doesn't have
[3:49:23.280 --> 3:49:28.320]  a blood brain barrier where you know the vaccines are just going to go boom right to the brain
[3:49:29.200 --> 3:49:34.720]  so yeah it's i mean it's definitely i don't envy people who have children right now that are
[3:49:34.720 --> 3:49:39.760]  raising them i gotta be tough but you know what look i will i've i've told this story before and
[3:49:39.760 --> 3:49:44.240]  i'll tell it again now it as a lot of people alex was talking earlier about how a lot of people
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:48.720]  brought their kids in we had some kids running around today really wonderful smart beautiful well
[3:49:48.720 --> 3:49:53.440]  i don't need to let we won't say who else here but the point is the the the kids that get brought
[3:49:53.440 --> 3:49:59.840]  here are i would imagine largely if not all of them non-vaccinated there and they're all smart
[3:49:59.840 --> 3:50:03.680]  they're all well spoken they're all fun they're all smiling they're all full of life
[3:50:03.680 --> 3:50:07.040]  and people who've been listening to me for a long time and i know that i know that you know this is
[3:50:07.040 --> 3:50:12.560]  i i used to work with the youth a lot in st louis and a specific program i worked with i would deal
[3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:18.160]  with youth that was in the public school system and then i would deal with the youth that was
[3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:24.960]  homeschooled specifically it was it was different groups and every time every time without fail the
[3:50:24.960 --> 3:50:29.920]  homeschooled kids were more well behaved they were more well spoken uh they were more full of life
[3:50:29.920 --> 3:50:34.080]  they were more educated just across the board and i would end up meeting a lot of these parents
[3:50:34.080 --> 3:50:37.840]  and we'd get to know each other and they say yeah i never vaccinated i don't give them GMOs and all
[3:50:37.840 --> 3:50:42.640]  this stuff and it's just like i don't feed them sugar all day and they don't watch tv all day we
[3:50:42.640 --> 3:50:48.000]  actually engage with them and night and day it really is night and day but until you actually
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:52.160]  look at it for yourself you know it's like seeing is believing final segment of the alex jones show

[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:22.000]  up so there's the book and ben Shapiro actually gave it a great rating he called it thorough
[3:56:22.720 --> 3:56:28.480]  so what's the twist what's the deal the reasons to vote democrats amazon dot com's bestseller
[3:56:28.480 --> 3:56:35.600]  list has been topped by a us political manifesto with a twist all 266 pages of reasons to vote for
[3:56:35.600 --> 3:56:43.040]  democrats are blank very comprehensive guy and as as ben Shapiro says it's thorough oh my goodness

[3:57:07.920 --> 3:57:12.160]  the think the thought process they say oh let me see that book they go through all 266 pages
[3:57:12.160 --> 3:57:17.040]  there's nothing there you say yeah you could probably relate right it was blank hey but hey

[3:57:22.640 --> 3:57:29.120]  this book reason reasons why people are protesting trump because i've asked they don't they don't have
[3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:34.320]  any reasons that are actually factual no they don't because they have their reasons but they're not
[3:57:34.320 --> 3:57:39.440]  based in reality how about this come up with your own reason that they don't have but i just thought
[3:57:39.440 --> 3:57:44.160]  that this was hilarious because when i first saw this i my first my because i didn't know about this
[3:57:44.160 --> 3:57:50.400]  book either my first response was this would be the first win that the democrats are the left
