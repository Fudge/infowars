[01:08.960 --> 01:18.080]  underwear bomber on that airline flight from Europe to Detroit Michigan and we're
[01:18.080 --> 01:24.680]  going to be going over that report first today the vaunted underwear bomber we
[01:24.680 --> 01:29.400]  don't give up all of our rights now and let the government fit us with taser
[01:29.400 --> 01:36.000]  bracelets al Qaeda will kill us al Qaeda will annihilate us doesn't matter if
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.240]  you're many times more likely to drown or die by electrocution than you are to
[01:40.240 --> 01:48.280]  die from terrorism it doesn't matter it's the bogeyman the bogeyman used as
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.440]  part of the power of nightmares to scare us into submission then we're going to
[01:52.440 --> 01:57.640]  get into the health care takeover another little Christmas Eve present from
[01:57.640 --> 02:03.200]  the collectivist and a bizarre statement by Chris Matthews it's up on
[02:03.200 --> 02:10.280]  info wars.com about our great mentor he and Bernie Sanders the senator Saul
[02:10.280 --> 02:13.760]  Alinsky Alinsky who was an open communist wanted
[02:13.760 --> 02:20.800]  reeducation camps mass arrests in America a Stalinist purge of course is
[02:20.800 --> 02:25.480]  the mentor of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama but you talk about it they call
[02:25.480 --> 02:32.920]  you McCarthy it's just a fact he dedicated his book to Lucifer I admitted
[02:32.920 --> 02:38.560]  Luciferian and I tell you Chris Matthews gives a twinkle in his eye when he
[02:38.560 --> 02:44.640]  talks about his great hero Saul Alinsky so that's coming up with the health
[02:44.640 --> 02:47.960]  care they've already got half the population domesticated on the
[02:47.960 --> 02:52.760]  government mammary gland and now the mopping up operation is going to begin
[02:52.760 --> 02:59.960]  the big banks running it using a giant horde of uneducated gibbering trashy
[02:59.960 --> 03:05.120]  people their minds filled with all the trash of television and the culture this
[03:05.120 --> 03:11.320]  plastic globalist culture and they are going to pillage what's left of society
[03:11.320 --> 03:15.840]  and then the bankers will put a police state in over the rubble and live in
[03:15.840 --> 03:20.360]  their armored redoubts over us that way no one could threaten them because for
[03:20.360 --> 03:28.160]  the ultra rich the real enjoyment the real flavor is slavery domination being
[03:28.160 --> 03:32.000]  able to control the arts and the culture and have just total tyranny and
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.440]  they're so close and they'll put in their right-wing version in three years
[03:36.440 --> 03:40.480]  and then they'll continue the whole agenda and suddenly all the Republicans
[03:40.480 --> 03:45.280]  who were against what Obama has done if suddenly will support it all just like
[03:45.280 --> 03:49.280]  Democrats who were against everything Bush did as soon as Obama got in and
[03:49.280 --> 03:54.560]  continued all of those policies but put a left-cover package on it suddenly they
[03:54.560 --> 04:01.320]  loved preemptive war they love the Patriot Act they love a torture so the
[04:01.320 --> 04:06.720]  underwear bomber what's really behind that the health care takeover and of
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.280]  course Obama handing a total diplomatic immunity over to Interpol
[04:10.280 --> 04:16.480]  something RFBI doesn't even have and then it's in the news that the police
[04:16.480 --> 04:20.760]  departments of the country are taking over the Boy Scouts of America to make
[04:20.760 --> 04:27.640]  them be basically shock troops and enforcers and spies for the federales so
[04:27.640 --> 04:36.120]  that's in the news again so it is all coming up today you will definitely want
[04:36.120 --> 04:44.920]  to stay with us for the full transmission the last Sunday show of 2009

[05:52.280 --> 05:59.920]  eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[06:01.080 --> 06:06.840]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[06:06.840 --> 06:13.520]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[06:23.440 --> 06:31.800]  we are live ladies and gentlemen the 27th day of December 2009 our last Sunday
[06:31.800 --> 06:41.960]  radio show of 2009 and our last radio show of the millennium now if you want
[06:41.960 --> 06:49.760]  to be technical it's our last show of the decade but if you want to be
[06:49.760 --> 06:53.880]  technical they started the millennium that's why I just had that Freudian
[06:53.880 --> 07:03.040]  slip they started the new millennium a year early it was supposed to be not
[07:03.040 --> 07:16.040]  December 31st 1999 it was supposed to be December 31st 2000 going into 2001 and
[07:16.040 --> 07:27.920]  so really the end of the decade should be the end of next year December 31st
[07:27.920 --> 07:37.600]  2010 should be the end of the first decade of the new millennium and the
[07:37.600 --> 07:48.760]  new century but because they started the millennium and the new century and the
[07:48.760 --> 07:55.080]  new decade a year early just because the government and the media felt like it
[07:55.080 --> 08:00.640]  then I guess I have to win in Rome does the Romans do adopt what they're saying
[08:00.640 --> 08:08.200]  and go okay it's the end of the decade Friday coming up Friday December 31st
[08:08.200 --> 08:12.560]  it is at the end of the decade but the public all believes it's the end of the
[08:12.560 --> 08:22.720]  decade I mean the public believe that 1999 was the last year in the 20th
[08:22.720 --> 08:30.640]  century and in the second millennium after Christ again I'm not even one of
[08:30.640 --> 08:34.960]  these people that watches Alex Trebek on Jeopardy and knows all these basic
[08:34.960 --> 08:40.040]  factoids I've just never been able to understand why we started the new
[08:40.040 --> 08:45.520]  millennium a year early why they're saying the decade is over a year early
[08:45.520 --> 08:52.520]  this is a big deal I don't know jaren is that a big deal so like in decades a
[08:52.520 --> 08:59.000]  year early start new Millennium's new centuries a year early or am I wrong huh
[08:59.000 --> 09:11.200]  I'm wrong okay all right here I am burning valuable time on something that
[09:11.200 --> 09:18.480]  doesn't really matter I guess it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if on 9 11
[09:18.480 --> 09:25.760]  eight years ago not one but two passports fell out of the planes that
[09:25.760 --> 09:32.960]  smashed into those buildings at over 550 miles an hour a piece and the bodies
[09:32.960 --> 09:37.680]  were all incinerated and disintegrated but out of the fireball out of the
[09:37.680 --> 09:41.960]  people's baggage out of their suits flew two passports and fell to the ground
[09:41.960 --> 09:50.880]  undamaged and the FBI found both of them separately within 24 hours see if I was
[09:50.880 --> 09:57.160]  normal I wouldn't care if they started the 21st century early I wouldn't care
[09:57.160 --> 10:02.600]  if the decade wasn't really over and the media said it was and I would just sit
[10:02.600 --> 10:09.720]  here and believe that passports fly out of passengers pockets and out of the
[10:09.720 --> 10:13.800]  inferno and out of the building and then down to the ground and then the FBI
[10:13.800 --> 10:18.000]  finds them you've got hundreds of millions of pieces of paper conservatively
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.960]  every one of those Manhattan offices had thousands of papers in it there were
[10:21.960 --> 10:25.360]  thousands of offices you got hundreds of thousands of not millions probably
[10:25.360 --> 10:32.800]  billions of pieces of paper flying down and doesn't matter the government found
[10:32.800 --> 10:38.600]  the passports of two of the hijackers and then you start to question the
[10:38.600 --> 10:42.960]  official story of 9-11 because you have to keep your sanity you have to go no
[10:42.960 --> 10:49.760]  that is important that is a big issue remember a year ago we reported that the
[10:49.760 --> 10:56.760]  Mumbai attacks in India had been staged by British US and Israeli intelligence
[10:56.760 --> 11:01.640]  that was what the head of the Indian police said they said we were tracking
[11:01.640 --> 11:06.640]  these groups we knew the US Britain and Israel were funding them then they blew
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.400]  up and killed the head of the Indian anti-terror police then they murdered a
[11:10.400 --> 11:15.080]  bunch of other heads of the regional Indian police for daring to tell the
[11:15.080 --> 11:20.920]  truth and now it was in the London telegraph last week Mumbai suspect is
[11:20.920 --> 11:29.320]  US double agent India claims now India is our little ally but when India catches
[11:29.320 --> 11:36.920]  Westerners running around funding and controlling hired criminals and what they
[11:36.920 --> 11:41.280]  do is they just grab a few people they shoot them they then have a few other
[11:41.280 --> 11:45.480]  commandos attack and machine gun the crowds then they take the dead bodies
[11:45.480 --> 11:49.960]  and say oh look we found them then they grab a patsy who they injected full of
[11:49.960 --> 11:56.400]  PCP LSD and peyote and a bunch of other drugs I mean they said the blood of this
[11:56.400 --> 12:01.520]  one patsy they grabbed was so jacked up off the chart and I said day one that
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.880]  guy is going to be a double agent just like McVay who they grabbed and drugged
[12:05.880 --> 12:09.720]  up before they dumped him into police custody where he'd be hallucinating for
[12:09.720 --> 12:14.360]  a week so that it would just seem like crazy babble same thing with McVay he's
[12:14.360 --> 12:18.880]  driving erratically runs off the road he's drooling on the ground saying help
[12:18.880 --> 12:24.120]  me to the state police they drug that guy big time look they shoot you up with
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.200]  LSD folks if you're a government agent and they've got you part of drills you
[12:28.200 --> 12:32.600]  may go out to a hundred drills until they really blow up a building shoot you
[12:32.600 --> 12:40.320]  up full of LSD and then hand you over to the cops that way you very Marinus
[12:40.320 --> 12:48.360]  Vanderloob 1933 February 27th he's found naked drugged up flopping around on the
[12:48.360 --> 12:53.000]  front steps of the German capital the Reichstag and now it's been declassified
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.120]  why our government kept it classified for fifty something years it was
[12:56.120 --> 13:01.000]  declassified two years ago even the New York Times reported Hitler grabbed a
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.600]  homeless person shot him up with drugs and then threw him out on the street
[13:04.600 --> 13:10.240]  there's a way this is done and if this guy in the latest underwear bombing wasn't
[13:10.240 --> 13:19.520]  on drugs then I am a Easter Bunny from Pluto because it's the same MO this
[13:19.520 --> 13:28.200]  time the exact same MO it's always the same MO I was hanging out with my parents
[13:28.200 --> 13:32.440]  and family on Christmas Day and was driving to the store listening to News
[13:32.440 --> 13:41.040]  Radio 590 KLBJ we'd forgotten some eggs so I was driving over to get some eggs
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.560]  trying to find a store that was open and I and I heard the report and I thought
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.960]  please let it be a real terrorist please let it be some low-nut please don't
[13:51.960 --> 13:55.400]  let this be the government again please don't let this be a patsy or a
[13:55.400 --> 14:02.280]  provocateur op or a setup please please because I want to know the government
[14:02.280 --> 14:06.720]  isn't doing this I want to think everything's alright it's a million
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.640]  times less scary to think it's rogue people in caves doing this and then
[14:11.640 --> 14:15.280]  sure enough that night I got online and read the mainstream media reports and
[14:15.280 --> 14:19.800]  then Saturday and today and even mainstream media I've got four or five
[14:19.800 --> 14:27.400]  British newspapers a Canadian paper a US paper saying did did the US and did the
[14:27.400 --> 14:34.840]  Europeans let this happen and why it's the same story it always is his dad said
[14:34.840 --> 14:39.120]  my a rich banker said my son's gotten him with extremist he's planning
[14:39.120 --> 14:44.720]  something and the FBI wasn't allowed to put him on the terror watch list when
[14:44.720 --> 14:50.320]  they put congressman on it they put a million three hundred thousand plus now
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.000]  Americans with no criminal records on it they put you on if you've got bad
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.960]  credit they've had federal marshals go public about that and speak out against
[14:58.960 --> 15:07.400]  it this guy was protected this guy was brought to the airport and we're gonna
[15:07.400 --> 15:14.360]  cover this after the break he was brought to the airport by a sharp
[15:14.360 --> 15:20.320]  dress man in a suit led past security the man ordered security to stand down
[15:20.320 --> 15:24.680]  he was brought right up to the gate they have higher levels of security in
[15:24.680 --> 15:28.880]  Europe than we even have here it's unbelievable he's brought to the gate
[15:28.880 --> 15:35.240]  without a passport or identification and put on the plane and then you've got
[15:35.240 --> 15:40.960]  him not on the terror watch list it's just like the Fort Hood shooter for two
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.360]  years saying he was gonna kill people sending emails that we thought was an
[15:45.360 --> 15:51.840]  al-qaeda of course it was the CIA this cleric he was under is openly CIA what
[15:51.840 --> 15:56.640]  three of the last patsies came from this guy I mean these are setups folks these
[15:56.640 --> 16:03.880]  are setups guaranteed the illusion created by the power elite is a lie that

[20:01.000 --> 20:07.040]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[20:07.040 --> 20:22.440]  Broadcasting Network network so it's come out in court documents in England and
[20:22.440 --> 20:31.080]  in India that the only passi that captured was a double agent for the
[20:31.080 --> 20:35.800]  United States when you hear the United States folks it's not the United States
[20:35.800 --> 20:40.280]  it's the foreign banks that have taken over our country taken over our
[20:40.280 --> 20:47.320]  military and use it as their own private mercenary army and I've seen this MO
[20:47.320 --> 20:55.520]  over and over again I remember it was in the Jerusalem post it was in UPI what
[20:55.520 --> 21:02.640]  six years ago Israel admitted that they created fake al-Qaeda groups to stage
[21:02.640 --> 21:10.200]  terror attacks in Israel killing Israelis as a pretext the so-called right wing
[21:10.200 --> 21:15.120]  government at the time created fake al-Qaeda groups to get them to attack
[21:15.120 --> 21:19.600]  their own people so their own people would give up their rights and the
[21:19.600 --> 21:24.240]  British of course it's been all over the major British news the last five six
[21:24.240 --> 21:29.720]  years it's been declassified that the British government because a bunch of
[21:29.720 --> 21:33.880]  the commandos went public one of them we interviewed agent steak knife later
[21:33.880 --> 21:39.120]  committed suicide he was running for his life when we had him on the interviews
[21:39.120 --> 21:43.440]  we've done I've interviewed hameed gull the former head of Pakistani
[21:43.440 --> 21:49.000]  intelligence when the US was running the war against the against the Russians
[21:49.000 --> 21:53.600]  nobody gets to interview with hameed gull but or ghoul depending on how you
[21:53.600 --> 21:58.040]  pronounce it but he came on this show because we're known worldwide for being
[21:58.040 --> 22:03.160]  fair and balanced unlike some people that use that catch term we actually want
[22:03.160 --> 22:11.840]  the truth but the issue here is that you have this ultra rich banker his son
[22:11.840 --> 22:19.200]  living in lavish apartments in London in Dubai you know the kind of place rock
[22:19.200 --> 22:27.120]  stars live in and then suddenly a man in a fancy suit this is mainstream news in
[22:27.120 --> 22:35.520]  Europe marches him past security with his syringe bomb or whatever it is they're
[22:35.520 --> 22:39.120]  now saying the passengers thought it was firecrackers but they're saying
[22:39.120 --> 22:44.360]  sophisticated you know just like Saddam had Death Star weapons and EMP weapons
[22:44.360 --> 22:50.160]  and nukes that were so deadly they could even kill Superman well this guy had
[22:50.160 --> 22:55.640]  stuff that bad and so he just struts right past security and it's the same in
[22:55.640 --> 23:03.800]  every case oh yeah nine of the nineteen nine eleven hijackers a year before 9
[23:03.800 --> 23:13.600]  11 went to a Mumbai terror summit and then we're allowed back into the US and
[23:13.600 --> 23:19.800]  I had mr. springman the head of the US embassy in Jetta Saudi Arabia on and he
[23:19.800 --> 23:24.800]  said that he wouldn't let him in because they had terror ties Muhammad out on
[23:24.800 --> 23:30.760]  others and the CIA called him up and said look these are US agents and they
[23:30.760 --> 23:36.120]  have a terrorist cover story that's their cover then they got back in the
[23:36.120 --> 23:40.600]  United States and were trained at US military bases in Norman Oklahoma
[23:40.600 --> 23:46.480]  Pensacola Pensacola Naval Air Station and the Defense Language School in
[23:46.480 --> 23:53.040]  Monterey Bay California and that was in CNBC Associated Press the head
[23:53.040 --> 23:57.480]  Lieutenant Colonel Steven Butler the head of the Defense Language School the
[23:57.480 --> 24:03.520]  Dean went public one month after 9 11 in the Associated Press saying I don't know
[24:03.520 --> 24:09.000]  what happened with 9 11 but it's somehow it's an inside job because these guys
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.480]  were trained at my base and her high level spies that's in the Associated
[24:14.480 --> 24:18.320]  Press I mean for those of you that say oh I don't want to hear 9 11's an inside
[24:18.320 --> 24:25.040]  job what else is it you got passports falling out of the sky that the FBI
[24:25.040 --> 24:29.440]  just so happens to find at ground zero the first day give me a break you've
[24:29.440 --> 24:34.360]  got the people training at US military bases it's the same thing with the son
[24:34.360 --> 24:39.240]  out at Fort Hood he's visiting the topless bars he's party in Hardy he's
[24:39.240 --> 24:43.040]  running around for several years talking about how he's gonna g-hot and kill
[24:43.040 --> 24:47.680]  everybody and how much he hates the president and how he loves suicide
[24:47.680 --> 24:52.160]  bombers folks if you're in the army and you criticize the president in any way
[24:52.160 --> 24:55.800]  you're lucky of all you get to dishonorable discharge and not a court
[24:55.800 --> 25:00.920]  marshal Steven Butler they started a court marshal on him till he agreed to
[25:00.920 --> 25:07.480]  shut up just for saying all I know is the hijackers were trained at my base
[25:07.480 --> 25:15.040]  something's going on my hominata sat in my class what he's not supposed to tell
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.960]  the truth he tells the truth and they start court marshal on him a son can
[25:19.960 --> 25:25.040]  run around folks it's not political correctness that they didn't bust him
[25:25.040 --> 25:32.360]  it's not political correctness that every single time three months ago the
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.520]  would-be bomber up in Illinois turned out the FBI created the group found the
[25:36.520 --> 25:40.920]  people let it found some prisoners some ex-con idiots promised to pay him a
[25:40.920 --> 25:46.200]  bunch of money if they drive a bomb into a building that is purely provocateur
[25:46.200 --> 25:50.360]  they didn't go out and find a group that was planning and stop them they go out
[25:50.360 --> 25:57.240]  and create the groups Texas Monthly 1998 Bumster Award to the FBI creating a
[25:57.240 --> 26:01.880]  clan group and trying to get him to blow up a chemical plant in Fort Worth
[26:01.880 --> 26:08.960]  Texas ladies and gentlemen this latest character if you didn't know if you

[26:39.080 --> 26:45.880]  but but I'm not the only one with my website saying that we've got a bunch
[26:45.880 --> 26:55.000]  of mainstream news articles here from mainstream media here's the UK daily
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.960]  mail why was he ever allowed to fly syringe bomber had been barred from
[26:59.960 --> 27:09.040]  Britain was on terror list and even his father had warned us yeah the FBI tried
[27:09.040 --> 27:13.240]  to put him on the terror watch list and someone ordered it pulled off it's the
[27:13.240 --> 27:19.440]  same story at the bare minimum they find these fruit cakes these mentally ill
[27:19.440 --> 27:23.920]  people and they give them the weapons and then protect them getting on the
[27:23.920 --> 27:30.320]  airplane to do it we know a lot of terror is provocateur that is incredibly
[27:30.320 --> 27:34.920]  criminal he could have brought that plane down bare minimum this was a setup
[27:34.920 --> 27:39.760]  bare minimum they let him do it and they let his son do it bare minimum but it
[27:39.760 --> 27:45.880]  gets worse from there as the days and weeks unfold just like with the Fort
[27:45.880 --> 27:50.520]  Hood shooting the evidence always emerges and I wish it didn't that this is
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.000]  going to be a complete inside job and I'll guarantee you this guy was hopped
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.080]  up on drugs hypnotized just like Sir Hand Sir Hand with the polka-dotted dress
[27:59.080 --> 28:02.640]  lady putting the drugs in his drink and his blood was tested and the guy that
[28:02.640 --> 28:07.200]  shot Bobby Kennedy in the back on record was CIA and four CIA guys were
[28:07.200 --> 28:11.400]  photographed inside the building and the LAPD corner said that none of Sir
[28:11.400 --> 28:15.760]  Hand's 22 bullets hitting that he was all shot in the back by the CIA officer
[28:15.760 --> 28:20.080]  doesn't matter they get away with it that's how they do this folks this guy
[28:20.080 --> 28:26.520]  is a patsy he seems stunned he seemed to not know what had just happened
[28:29.640 --> 28:36.040]  it's just unbelievable I wish this was a real terror attack believe me I wish the
[28:36.040 --> 28:39.880]  government wasn't doing this type of stuff so they can take our freedoms and
[28:39.880 --> 28:43.800]  take our liberties and take our rights I'm gonna hit a few more facts on this

[33:07.000 --> 33:11.080]  Broadcasting Network network
[33:11.080 --> 33:21.880]  all right folks we are back live thank you so much for joining us on this live
[33:21.880 --> 33:36.480]  Sunday edition the 27th day of December 2009 coming up I'm gonna get into
[33:36.480 --> 33:41.480]  government-run health care worse than we even thought previously the 2000 plus
[33:41.480 --> 33:48.080]  page bill is a nightmare takeover of your life we've got Chris Matthews
[33:48.080 --> 33:53.640]  Hailing an admitted communist and Luciferian you can't make stuff up like
[33:53.640 --> 33:58.160]  this Saul Olenski talking about how great their dream is and how it's now
[33:58.160 --> 34:05.560]  coming true remember though communists are just the group of pirates it's like
[34:05.560 --> 34:09.000]  when the circus comes to town you've got to have somebody to put up the posters
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.760]  they're just the little low-level crew members that carry out the looting they
[34:14.760 --> 34:20.800]  deliver the booty back to the bankers and that's why you've got the Rockefeller
[34:20.800 --> 34:24.640]  Foundation the Carnegie Foundation and others the Ford Foundation openly
[34:24.640 --> 34:29.800]  funding Saul Olenski Barack Obama all of these people and they mean business
[34:29.800 --> 34:35.560]  these are cold blooded thugs and they're not communists they're Wall Street
[34:35.560 --> 34:41.760]  businessmen who have a army of communist deadbeats under them who want free
[34:41.760 --> 34:50.200]  handouts and who will carry out tyranny to get it so coming up the health care
[34:50.200 --> 34:55.240]  plan also Obama gives inner pole inside the United States the international
[34:55.240 --> 35:01.080]  police organization gives them immunity notice our own military our own police
[35:01.080 --> 35:06.880]  don't get this type of immunity this is total immunity even from crime it's
[35:06.880 --> 35:10.840]  completely illegal but see the globalists set up the UN so they give
[35:10.840 --> 35:18.920]  themselves imperial power Magna Carta in 1215 the nobles grabbed the king and
[35:18.920 --> 35:22.040]  said we're gonna chop your head off if you don't stop saying you're God and
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.640]  stop saying you can commit any crime against nature you want any crime
[35:27.640 --> 35:35.480]  against common sense so since 1214 or 1215 England this power hasn't been
[35:35.480 --> 35:39.920]  there until the Rockefellers set up the United Nations and they gave themselves
[35:39.920 --> 35:45.760]  this power and now they've got it inside the US so that's coming up also I told
[35:45.760 --> 35:49.560]  you years ago the feds are federalizing all over the world Boy Scouts and Girl
[35:49.560 --> 35:53.280]  Scouts training them to spy on their parents training them for warrants
[35:53.280 --> 35:57.640]  service training them to quote take on veterans and for gun confiscation that's
[35:57.640 --> 36:01.920]  in the New York Times oh look how good the explorer Scouts are they're training
[36:01.920 --> 36:06.560]  to take on disgruntled veterans they practice sweeping the home and taking
[36:06.560 --> 36:11.800]  out the vet and then taking the cache of weapons that's the New York Times
[36:11.800 --> 36:16.840]  that's in my film actual New York Times front page and then with the color
[36:16.840 --> 36:21.760]  photos of it happening that's in my film fall the Republic you cannot make this
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.400]  up but it's back in the news today and and I noticed the first caller and I
[36:26.400 --> 36:34.280]  went and checked online during the break it is him is Wyatt from Maryland it was
[36:34.280 --> 36:41.360]  Wyatt in Maryland in 1998 sent me footage of an urban warfare drill with
[36:41.360 --> 36:46.560]  the Marines practicing to take over their town with their police and the police
[36:46.560 --> 36:52.400]  walked up with the Marines with machine guns drawn and said you can't film us
[36:52.400 --> 36:56.960]  in America and pointed the machine guns at them that footage is in my film
[36:56.960 --> 37:02.600]  police state 2000 the first time I ever saw it it was the Boy Scouts training to
[37:02.600 --> 37:08.000]  take on the local gun owners and telling the Marines where the militia members
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.280]  were played by other Marines they had the local police department involved and
[37:13.280 --> 37:16.880]  I and I got this footage and I showed it to people and I said look they're
[37:16.880 --> 37:24.520]  training the kids to go after veterans guns now it's main stream news and back
[37:24.520 --> 37:30.560]  in the news today and I was gonna cover that near the end of the show I have the
[37:30.560 --> 37:37.120]  stack right here it's in the Sacramento B it's in the Confer Coast Times it's in
[37:37.120 --> 37:43.440]  the new media journal the fifth column is the name of this column Obama extends
[37:43.440 --> 37:48.200]  diplomatic immunity to interpull by executive order FEMA press release
[37:48.200 --> 37:52.960]  national level exercise 2009 training with troops from 14 countries to take on
[37:52.960 --> 37:58.560]  the American people here's IDF US National Guard to share defense ideas IDF
[37:58.560 --> 38:02.720]  forces to be deployed amongst US military forces quote to take on US
[38:02.720 --> 38:07.720]  terrorist on US soil foreign troops right out in the open can't trust the
[38:07.720 --> 38:13.600]  American people but you can trust foreign troops oh here it is daily news LAPD on
[38:13.600 --> 38:19.640]  course to take over Explorer program youths new name uniforms insignia planned
[38:19.640 --> 38:26.120]  LAPD taking over from the Boy Scouts 3000 young people in LA and then folks
[38:26.120 --> 38:30.120]  we've gotten the training manuals in video even the New York Times reports on
[38:30.120 --> 38:36.680]  it but says it's good they are training literally to confiscate your guns and
[38:36.680 --> 38:41.320]  remember I told you that 10 years ago I told you when we got internal FBI
[38:41.320 --> 38:45.920]  documents we got more earlier this year it made national attention the Mayak and
[38:45.920 --> 38:49.080]  Homeland Security report saying veterans gun owners libertarians
[38:49.080 --> 38:52.800]  conservatives are the real terrorist homeland securities really set up for
[38:52.800 --> 39:00.760]  you we broke that and the the issue here is they are training your children to
[39:00.760 --> 39:05.200]  spy on you and to confiscate your guns in fact here's the New York Times I got
[39:05.200 --> 39:08.960]  jaren to pull it up jaren can you pull up the actual New York Times for people
[39:08.960 --> 39:12.960]  not just the print off I want to click on the photo section and I want to show
[39:12.960 --> 39:17.040]  prisonplanet.tv viewers for those that don't know that just listen to the radio
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.440]  you can tune into prisonplanet.tv and watch the video I want people to
[39:21.440 --> 39:26.960]  actually see the photos as the scouts trained to kill US veterans because
[39:26.960 --> 39:31.080]  seeing is believing and of course this article says how great it is now that
[39:31.080 --> 39:35.360]  said I have no idea what Wyatt who calls in about every three years I went and
[39:35.360 --> 39:39.080]  checked the phones and sure enough it was him Wyatt you're the first guy to
[39:39.080 --> 39:46.120]  send me video of this in 1998 11 years ago and boy we were coaxed people didn't
[39:46.120 --> 39:53.440]  believe the video of dozens of kids out in their white t-shirt uniforms directed
[39:53.440 --> 40:00.120]  by the Marines in gun confiscation now in Arcadia earlier this year we had the
[40:00.120 --> 40:04.240]  Colonel on he admitted yes we're training with the locals and the kids for a gun
[40:04.240 --> 40:08.200]  confiscation drill they're quite honest your children are being trained to take
[40:08.200 --> 40:12.760]  your guns this is what America is all about this is what George Washington was
[40:12.760 --> 40:18.600]  all about good to have you here with us Wyatt perfect day for you to call in
[40:18.600 --> 40:22.440]  well thank you Alex and I'd like to wish you and your family happy new year and
[40:22.440 --> 40:26.160]  hopefully it'll be a much much better new year
[40:26.160 --> 40:32.520]  yeah the uh... that uh... in Hebron Maryland is where that was and there was
[40:32.520 --> 40:38.040]  also another guy there his name is uh... Sheldon Isaacs and I've lost touch
[40:38.040 --> 40:42.400]  with him I don't even know where Sheldon is but he's the one that the Marines came
[40:42.400 --> 40:50.080]  up to at night and told him to turn his camera off and uh... had their guns ready
[40:50.080 --> 40:55.480]  had their military weapons these are all lieutenants that were involved in this
[40:55.480 --> 41:06.520]  uh... first uh... and it was a gun confiscation drill for they were set up by these
[41:06.520 --> 41:11.920]  young lieutenants anyway the kids on the bicycles uh... I talked to them and I
[41:11.920 --> 41:16.440]  said hey you know this stuff that's going on in your town is uh... is really
[41:16.440 --> 41:21.240]  terrible I said what you ought to do is go back to him and say hey uh... there's
[41:21.240 --> 41:27.760]  somebody down by the grain silos to uh... that's uh... that that that is uh...
[41:27.760 --> 41:32.920]  uh... and then insurgent well they went back and told them that and my god they
[41:32.920 --> 41:37.120]  started sending Humvee down the street and uh... they were actually looking for
[41:37.120 --> 41:44.200]  me and the kids told them he said it and uh... you know that's the problem people
[41:44.200 --> 41:47.960]  don't know history they don't know in ancient Rome or in Nazi Germany or
[41:47.960 --> 41:53.560]  Soviet Russia or Maoist China or Pol Potts Cambodia when the state starts
[41:53.560 --> 41:57.480]  coming and militarizing your children and literally turning them against you
[41:57.480 --> 42:02.400]  remember all this training was going on before 9-11 I'll never forget the Ram
[42:02.400 --> 42:06.520]  Corporation said there's going to be big terror attacks we're going to set up a
[42:06.520 --> 42:10.680]  thing called Homeland Security we're going to take everybody's rights and
[42:10.680 --> 42:14.320]  now Ram Corporation wrote up the plan to fully federalize all police that's
[42:14.320 --> 42:19.520]  already happened I mean ladies and gentlemen this is all pointed at you
[42:19.520 --> 42:24.880]  and your farm and your ranch and your business and your paycheck this has
[42:24.880 --> 42:31.120]  nothing to do with al-qaeda now why I got you off because I mean it why at

[42:35.720 --> 42:38.760]  subjects what did you originally call in about
[42:38.760 --> 42:42.760]  okay what I call it about uh... it kind of goes hand in hand with this uh...
[42:42.760 --> 42:49.880]  Detroit situation tonight on 60 minutes they're going to have a CIA agent or CIA

[43:03.960 --> 43:08.320]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[43:08.320 --> 43:12.480]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control

[43:16.480 --> 43:20.360]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[43:20.360 --> 43:24.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[43:24.600 --> 43:28.800]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[43:28.800 --> 43:33.120]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[43:33.120 --> 43:36.640]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages

[47:58.880 --> 48:05.160]  same story over and over and over again and understand you are the target all of
[48:05.160 --> 48:10.160]  this is going to be used to sell the population on accepting a police state
[48:10.160 --> 48:15.320]  and we have the internal homeland security documents it's all about the
[48:15.320 --> 48:19.280]  american people and gun owners and landowners it's all about you the

[48:27.120 --> 48:33.360]  security to rob you period it's called tyranny Wyatt finish up your point from
[48:33.360 --> 48:38.680]  Maryland yeah they've got all these special TV shows oh insider say al-qaeda
[48:38.680 --> 48:42.800]  is about to hit that's why we've got to expand the wars and have body scanners
[48:42.800 --> 48:46.080]  at all the airports that record our naked bodies and that's why we've got to
[48:46.080 --> 48:50.520]  have checkpoints on the highways and because al-qaeda is about to hit us
[48:50.520 --> 48:57.800]  that's right though what they're doing what they're going to do is they're going to use that body scanners as a as a priority because of this
[48:57.800 --> 49:04.360]  situation this make-believe happy situation and it remains they're going to
[49:04.360 --> 49:07.880]  be here now I think hopefully it won't be only shoes I think you think underwear
[49:07.880 --> 49:12.360]  over I don't know but it'll probably be important everybody has to be these
[49:12.360 --> 49:17.760]  body scanners now I don't know what the terrorist attack or the the fall
[49:17.760 --> 49:24.720]  swag that might be it could be anything evidently the one in one
[49:24.720 --> 49:29.600]  situation didn't work out too good for them they probably did manage to get
[49:29.600 --> 49:34.040]  enough children inoculated with the poison pretty much that's about it Alex
[49:34.040 --> 49:38.320]  if it's once again like the wishes of you all your listeners and your audience
[49:38.320 --> 49:43.560]  they're happy happy new year and I know for one thing there are certain things
[49:43.560 --> 49:49.920]  that I'm going to be taking into into hand for the new year and it won't be
[49:49.920 --> 49:56.800]  anything to do with confetti thank you good to hear from you Wyatt
[49:56.800 --> 50:02.240]  Marilyn 11 years ago he sent me footage of children being trained to take your
[50:02.240 --> 50:08.120]  guns in America and now it's in the news oh look the children are training to
[50:08.120 --> 50:13.160]  confiscate a disgruntled veterans firearms they practice sweeping the
[50:13.160 --> 50:19.680]  the home and terminating with a seek and destroy mission the disgruntled vet I
[50:19.680 --> 50:26.360]  mean that's in the New York Times right here in my hand
[50:26.720 --> 50:33.320]  scouts trained to fight terrorist and more New York Times May 14 2009 why do
[50:33.320 --> 50:38.840]  I raise this I see articles every day or two where major police departments are
[50:38.840 --> 50:44.840]  going out and mainly getting poor gangbanger kids just like the Soviet
[50:44.840 --> 50:50.320]  Russia I have ABC with news reports from the 80s going look at Russia where they
[50:50.320 --> 50:55.760]  take the disadvantaged kids and train them to be thugs of the state and it
[50:55.760 --> 51:00.680]  showed like 10 12 year old kids putting black masks on I've got that newscast
[51:00.680 --> 51:05.000]  like a clip of it is in is it masters of terror or police state three total
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.840]  enslavement I forget and I point out that's happening and now it's like well
[51:08.840 --> 51:14.520]  that's America training the 12 13 14 year olds for this and then good old
[51:14.520 --> 51:19.520]  boys always send me emails and say I'm not afraid of some 14 year old bring it
[51:19.520 --> 51:26.760]  on that 14 year old is gonna be 18 in just four years and they're gonna be
[51:26.760 --> 51:34.160]  young dumb and they're gonna follow orders they aren't just letting them
[51:34.160 --> 51:38.800]  the boy scouts by the way Hitler took over his own German boy scouts that
[51:38.800 --> 51:42.520]  have been chartered similar to ours and set up the Hitler youth out of it
[51:42.520 --> 51:50.440]  Stalin same deal Mount same deal I mean this is so cut and dry so evil and then
[51:50.440 --> 51:56.240]  I have mainstream news articles about it meanwhile two years ago we were sent
[51:56.240 --> 52:01.920]  this by a listener we broke this simultaneously along with some other
[52:01.920 --> 52:08.440]  people online and then a year later mainstream media reported on it but like
[52:08.440 --> 52:13.000]  it was a good idea and they're gonna incrementally keep adding more security
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.960]  at the airports and then more security at malls and more security at random
[52:16.960 --> 52:21.920]  checkpoints that that's in the Patriot Act internal checkpoints on highways
[52:21.920 --> 52:25.240]  run by the TSA people laughed at me about that because you couldn't read the
[52:25.240 --> 52:29.560]  Patriot Act wouldn't read the Patriot Act it was too important to read a big
[52:29.560 --> 52:39.880]  12 champion magazine or something that doesn't matter for your family and I I
[52:39.880 --> 52:44.120]  remember seeing all of this it just makes my head spin so so they're gonna
[52:44.120 --> 52:49.640]  incrementally condition you until you wear taser bracelets when you fly on
[52:49.640 --> 52:53.960]  airplanes and then they go on in the same newscast to say oh and then for any
[52:53.960 --> 52:57.640]  misdemeanor you're gonna have to wear the taser bracelet half the population
[52:57.640 --> 53:01.400]  is gonna end up wearing taser bracelets I know you don't believe that but five
[53:01.400 --> 53:06.080]  years ago they made the entire Mexican Attorney General staff in Mexico taking
[53:06.080 --> 53:10.840]  plantable tracker chips they've been taking blood from all newborn babies
[53:10.840 --> 53:16.120]  for 36 37 years worldwide I told you about it 14 years ago it's now been
[53:16.120 --> 53:21.880]  declassified this year you're not in Kansas anymore boys and girls the
[53:21.880 --> 53:26.640]  government is a scientific dictatorship they don't control all the radio and TV
[53:26.640 --> 53:30.800]  yet they don't control everything yet they control all the main power centers
[53:30.800 --> 53:33.920]  and they're beginning to lose control because people are finding out about
[53:33.920 --> 53:41.440]  them the stupid carbon credit trading stuff has plunged by more than 15% in
[53:41.440 --> 53:45.800]  some areas higher as people found out the whole man made global warming things
[53:45.800 --> 53:50.400]  bull these people are not invincible it will simply take action against them
[53:50.400 --> 53:54.960]  alright I'm gonna stop ranting here is Fox News you can watch the whole clip up
[53:54.960 --> 53:58.600]  on info wars.com but I don't have time to put the whole thing here just a few
[53:58.600 --> 54:02.440]  minutes of them telling you how great taser bracelets are that you're gonna
[54:02.440 --> 54:08.760]  be fitted with and 214 airports already scan your naked body 360 your daughter
[54:08.760 --> 54:14.040]  your son naked digital biometric images are now in government databases they
[54:14.040 --> 54:18.200]  already got your blood so don't tell me the if they give you a taser bracelet
[54:18.200 --> 54:22.080]  you'll put it on and get on your knees and start licking boots because you've
[54:22.080 --> 54:26.680]  had your soul sucked out you've had your fighting instincts sucked out you need
[54:26.680 --> 54:31.240]  to get it back need to ask God to give it back to you I'm a red blooded
[54:31.240 --> 54:35.800]  American you should get upset about this homeland security is looking at putting
[54:35.800 --> 54:38.520]  taser bracelets on you here it is
[54:38.520 --> 54:42.040]  imagine showing up for your next flight at the airport and being handed a
[54:42.040 --> 54:47.000]  device a little bracelet that would serve as your boarding pass it would track
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.360]  your lost luggage it would also shock you with the same power as a taser if you
[54:51.360 --> 54:55.200]  get out of line the top official with the Department of Homeland Security has
[54:55.200 --> 55:00.640]  expressed interest in these so-called safety bracelets so is this really the
[55:00.640 --> 55:06.840]  future of air travel and will passengers accept it okay and then they go on to
[55:06.840 --> 55:10.520]  talk about yes people will accept it and it's good and they know you've been
[55:10.520 --> 55:14.840]  trained like a dog that if you see authority figures up on TV with fancy
[55:14.840 --> 55:20.080]  teleprompters and fancy bimbos licking their lips and an expert types with
[55:20.080 --> 55:25.840]  glasses on that you will submit and they say yes your scum you will submit to it
[55:25.840 --> 55:29.880]  you love it you love being worse than Nazi Germany you love delivering your
[55:29.880 --> 55:34.560]  children into hell now here is the actual company that's got homeland security
[55:34.560 --> 55:38.240]  trying to sell the public on shocker bracelets now here it is there a
[55:38.240 --> 55:43.720]  solution to deterring hijackers once they are on the aircraft yes there is a
[55:43.720 --> 55:49.880]  very viable workable answer it starts here when passengers are issued their
[55:49.880 --> 55:55.640]  tickets at that time they can also be fitted with a special electronic ID
[55:55.640 --> 55:59.080]  bracelet that they will wear until they disembark the flight at their
[55:59.080 --> 56:04.280]  destination these electronic coated bracelets will make traveling much more
[56:04.280 --> 56:08.800]  convenient for the public it will replace the need to carry a ticket by
[56:08.800 --> 56:13.680]  containing all pertinent passenger information in addition the bracelet
[56:13.680 --> 56:17.760]  could permit tracking of the passenger through the terminal including carry on
[56:17.760 --> 56:23.560]  luggage checked luggage can be coded to match the bracelet to ensure no
[56:23.560 --> 56:28.880]  tampering or diversions by further equipping each bracelet with EMD
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.520]  technology the bracelets will allow crew members using radio frequency
[56:33.520 --> 56:39.200]  transmitters to quickly and effectively subdue hijackers the electro muscular
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.080]  disruption signal overrides the attackers central nervous system and
[56:43.080 --> 56:47.200]  will render even the most elite and aggressive terrorist completely a
[56:47.200 --> 56:52.120]  mobile for several minutes this will allow the crew to subdue and okay that
[56:52.120 --> 56:57.240]  individual see this is how they do it they just keep phasing it in more and
[56:57.240 --> 57:01.760]  more security oh look somebody else had a man in a sharp suit lead them past
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.800]  security and put them on the plane without an idea passport in every case
[57:06.800 --> 57:12.000]  in every case of terror I've ever seen it's completely staged it's either
[57:12.000 --> 57:16.160]  provocateur or there aren't even terrorists involved and you've got CIA
[57:16.160 --> 57:21.600]  black ops literally with imploder plungers running the op it's in the 2004
[57:21.600 --> 57:27.320]  Army manual given to captains and above how to stage terror attacks every Army
[57:27.320 --> 57:30.880]  captain listening to me if you're involved in black ops you know this is
[57:30.880 --> 57:35.880]  true but that's how we win wars Alex we stage terror attacks no that's how you

[57:52.360 --> 57:56.360]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[57:56.360 --> 58:00.120]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[58:00.120 --> 58:04.520]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows

[58:08.880 --> 58:13.320]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[58:13.320 --> 58:18.080]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[58:18.080 --> 58:21.880]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[58:21.880 --> 58:25.480]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[58:25.480 --> 58:29.880]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[58:29.880 --> 58:33.040]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[58:33.040 --> 58:36.680]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[58:36.680 --> 58:41.480]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[1:04:56.560 --> 1:05:02.560]  Michael and others and a bunch of other key stuff hundreds of nations have fallen
[1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:07.440]  to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:11.680]  history as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from
[1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:16.360]  underneath Americans at home tremendous influence on our president in
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:21.240]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all
[1:05:21.240 --> 1:05:26.200]  of us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies
[1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:31.320]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:35.320]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:39.280]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:43.320]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and
[1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:49.400]  right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of
[1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:54.840]  fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching online right now
[1:05:54.840 --> 1:06:03.840]  in super high quality at prison planet dot TV from his central Texas command
[1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:09.320]  center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:18.320]  Jones and the GCN radio network my friends we have been incrementally taught
[1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:27.560]  to be lemmings to be slaves to bow to government to bow to office to bow to
[1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:32.320]  uniforms that that's respectful and that's patriotic that is the opposite of
[1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:37.160]  what our founding fathers said they said that when government becomes
[1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:41.600]  destructive of the aims of the Declaration of Independence it is not
[1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:48.040]  just your right it is your duty to throw it off now this armed camp of
[1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:52.760]  criminals that have been amassed against the Republic they are the
[1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:58.800]  revolutionaries they are the people overthrowing our sound Republic they got
[1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:05.280]  a lot of brainwashed well-meaning idiots in their ranks for more than 10 years
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:09.160]  they've been quietly brainwashing the Boy Scouts to join the federal and state
[1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:13.560]  ranks of the police state now the feds are openly federalizing the Boy Scouts
[1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:17.480]  and having federalized police departments completely take it over the
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:21.560]  children are trained for gun confiscation to take on the American people and every
[1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:25.120]  time I talk about this I get moronic emails people going well I'm in the Boy
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:28.920]  Scouts or my son is and we're not doing that well they hadn't got to your town
[1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:36.440]  yet buddy boy I've got the Associated Press I've got Reuters I've got the LA
[1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:41.200]  Times I've got the New York Times saying how great it is that the kids are
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:50.000]  being trained for gun confiscation now the good news is this does shock Boy
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.760]  Scout groups because a lot of times they're not really conscious of what's
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:07:57.440]  going on because it's such a shocking statement to make then they go out and
[1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:00.600]  find out it's true and it's really happening but they find out the media is
[1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:04.640]  going what's the big deal I mean it's not just the Boy Scouts I have local
[1:08:04.640 --> 1:08:11.680]  Austin news and local commercials that are run in the public schools in Austin
[1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:17.480]  over the TV networks they have the in-school TV systems I have a clip of
[1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:23.960]  this actually in fall the Republic my latest documentary film where it shows
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:32.240]  the kids and they're offered $200 to turn in family members or anyone else and
[1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:36.200]  there's always a good reason oh yes the government wants to stop drugs they
[1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:43.560]  ship in while they push legal drugs on your kids the Prozac and Ridland oh yes
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:49.280]  the terrorism oh yes folks this is a criminal out-of-control government you
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:56.360]  better wake up and admit that to yourselves but it doesn't matter a lot of
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:01.120]  you aren't gonna wake up till later you got to get hurt really bad by the system
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:04.400]  and the system knows you're gonna wake up and fight them that's why all their
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:07.920]  internal reports that we've gotten our hands on that have become national news

[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:40.160]  prize and they're arrogant and they're focused and they've got the police in
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:43.360]  their back pocket because the police don't even know what time of day it is
[1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:46.960]  just like the general public and they are moving ahead with this thing right

[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:43.640]  do you think the UN is always caught because they're the ones that have the
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:47.160]  diplomatic immunity they can fly anywhere in the world can't be searched how
[1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:56.200]  did the UN get this Henry the 8th type imperial power and now they've got the
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:10:59.040]  power to run it in America all I can say is hide your kids

[1:20:05.680 --> 1:20:11.440]  listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network
[1:20:15.160 --> 1:20:21.160]  yeah one time I was in downtown Austin in front of DineCourse main office and
[1:20:21.160 --> 1:20:23.800]  there were these cops standing out front and I walked over and I said you know
[1:20:23.800 --> 1:20:27.800]  they've been caught as one of the biggest child trafficking groups in the
[1:20:27.800 --> 1:20:32.680]  world and they don't even get in trouble and the cops just said yeah I do work
[1:20:32.680 --> 1:20:36.280]  for them sometime I started laughing at me and and I don't think those Austin
[1:20:36.280 --> 1:20:40.560]  cops were involved but see it's funny but if they're told to freak out and get
[1:20:40.560 --> 1:20:44.720]  all scared of some patsy who got tricked on to getting onto an airplane with
[1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:48.880]  some explosive you know if they'll get all scared and serious or if they pull
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:51.800]  you over and your kid wasn't in their seatbelt right they're gonna go ahead
[1:20:51.800 --> 1:20:56.880]  and CPS them and take it all serious and give you no leeway and you know just I've
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:21:01.600]  got to throw the book at you ma'am I'm sorry but you're a criminal but if you're
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:05.680]  a big giant global power they just fall down and worship you but it's not just
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:10.920]  the police it's the general public yuppies and people they think it's cool
[1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:16.120]  and cute not to care they think it's cool to conform and go along with the
[1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:22.360]  system and and and never make waves and so our society will fall we will lose
[1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:27.320]  everything only one tenth of one percent will end up with 90 plus percent of the
[1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:33.120]  wealth and all of you that enjoyed incredible wealth and success you will
[1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:36.960]  end up losing everything you have the next decade most of you will end up
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:41.120]  losing almost everything you've got and you'll still defend the system because
[1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:46.560]  you're cowards deep down you make a split-second decision like Orwell talked
[1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:52.960]  about with crime stop to serve the evil most people didn't Russia most people
[1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:57.920]  didn't not see Germany most people did throughout history it's shameful and I'm
[1:21:57.920 --> 1:22:02.760]  here so you get to hear the truth at least once and know that you had a
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:07.920]  choice to make but when the system attacks you when the systems got you
[1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:12.320]  cornered and none of your neighbors or nobody cares about you because they've
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:17.400]  all been trained to watch their fellow humans torn apart they've all been
[1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:23.440]  trained to let this predatory parasitic vampiric government feed on us and the
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:27.840]  vampires and I mean that figuratively for the New York Times writes an article
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:32.440]  about me they think of you as food they think of you as steak on the table they
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:36.720]  think of you as like a cat thinks of a mouse they're cold-blooded they don't
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:41.280]  care all right I said I'd take calls and I'll get into the health care thing it's
[1:22:41.280 --> 1:22:47.280]  just reading the health care how it lets the government run your life and know
[1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:51.160]  all your records and put you in jail for five years if you don't get it and take
[1:22:51.160 --> 1:22:55.400]  money out of your check and cut Medicare and Medicaid I mean it even cuts what you
[1:22:55.400 --> 1:22:59.400]  get just like the banker bailout was a robbery everything's a robbery everything's
[1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:07.120]  a scam everything's a fraud because we have a criminal hijacked government the
[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:12.320]  Republic is falling it's going away your entire bill of rights is being
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:18.400]  trampled on Homeland Security and Northcom were built for you the milk cow
[1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:24.600]  that they're milking that they're sucking blood out of don't you get they
[1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:29.560]  know their criminals that's why they're militarizing against you and brainwashing
[1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:34.440]  our young people that it's macho and cool to engage in predator activity on
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:38.880]  their own people Matt and then who Leo Matt and Indiana go ahead I'm gonna
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:46.600]  quit ranting the Jones hey buddy hey good good talk to you brother I think you
[1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:52.800]  got a clip of the weather channel clip of the U.N. they're talking about free
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:56.960]  condoms to combat climate change and it was interesting because the yeah they
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:01.520]  know they're saying they're teaching everybody ban kids over one for the
[1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:05.560]  world government they called for that in Copenhagen a world government quote to
[1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:09.560]  enforce one-child policy go ahead and it was interesting because the new
[1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:13.960]  anchor was actually discrediting the U.N. propaganda and I'll find another
[1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:17.520]  point I watched the other day it was it was funny to get a call the other day
[1:24:17.520 --> 1:24:23.160]  called out Jesse Ventura and his creationism and versus evolution and I
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:29.200]  watched Ben Stein expelled no intelligence allowed and it has a great
[1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:34.720]  section and Ben Stein of course worked for a bunch of presidents and others
[1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:38.560]  we're gonna get him on his film for those that don't know he found out what I
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:42.920]  found out in the endgame of my film that it's all eugenicists his film came out a
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:48.960]  year after mine that the eugenicist that eugenics cult is running everything go
[1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:52.240]  ahead I think I think he I think he gets it and it's interesting to see the
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:56.720]  correlation between the persecution of the people on the side of creationism
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:00.240]  and the persecution of the people on the side of evolutionism as it ties the
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:04.920]  climate gate with people on both sides of that and then also on just a final
[1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:10.560]  point sir if you could ever talk about the Montana Freeman and if you could
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:14.640]  elaborate on any of that and what you might know about it well I remember you
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:19.400]  know I know they got set up they were really asking for it
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:26.480]  we're gonna be just walk right into this I mean go ahead
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:33.720]  well that idea that the more debt you have is the money you have the one I
[1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:37.680]  appreciate your call yeah yeah man I appreciate your call listen it's called
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:44.000]  patriot mythology and so people go well the private central banks are allowed
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:48.200]  for every dollar of deposit they've got every dollar the federal government
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:54.080]  creates they get to loan out 10 so they get to buy up real assets and buy up
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:26:00.240]  media and buy up governments so since the banks count debts through fractional
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:09.600]  reserve banking as as as a net asset then we can do that too and no it's only
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:13.880]  allowed through the private Federal Reserve in that cartel it's a big club
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:19.840]  and we ain't in it and so they will send SWAT teams after you if you ever try to
[1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:24.520]  do what they're doing only the private offshore banks are allowed to kidnap
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:28.440]  children and run giant slave grids they're the only ones allowed to create
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:32.560]  trillions of dollars in debt and put it on our backs they're the only ones
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:36.480]  allowed to commit crime everywhere they're the bankers they own in her
[1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:41.400]  poll they own the government they are the crooks Julio in Illinois you're on
[1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:46.520]  the air go ahead Alex Jones freedom fighter Mary belated Christmas to you

[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.840]  you sir you're welcome I quick comment that's my question I saw the New
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:03.160]  World Order documentary that you were in I think it was on IFC I saw it on this
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:08.920]  guy's website the other day fantastic it really scary when you're in that hotel
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:12.800]  room during the bill over conference in Virginia and they pulled a fire alarm on
[1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:18.040]  you stop you let me stop you and then but since you well you know what finish
[1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:22.200]  finish your point and then I'm gonna tell a story about that film New World
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:27.960]  Order but go ahead okay I was gonna ask a question I think this week the
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:31.080]  government was trying to do some huge operations you're talking about the
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:35.800]  underwear bar terrorist bomber here in Illinois we weren't expected to have a
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:39.120]  huge snowstorm we're only supposed to have an inch or three of snow and I
[1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:43.640]  remember I keep telling you about that Air Force Report 1996 I think they were
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:48.040]  doing it here in Illinois we have like two feet of snow this weekend we weren't
[1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:50.720]  expected to have this so again I think the government could do with something
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:54.840]  this entire week against the people well you know there are extreme weather
[1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:58.760]  events that happen naturally but there is massive weather modification and
[1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:02.600]  control a lot of it's been declassified but but I appreciate your call let me
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:11.280]  let me now comment on the other point about New World Order the film that
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:19.080]  documentary that aired on IFC predominantly about myself the makers of
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:22.560]  it have been interviewed by national news the New York Times and others and
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:27.000]  the New York Times because I've talked to them off air I've talked to the
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.920]  filmmakers and they go yeah the New York Times asked us if we were really
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:37.200]  followed by by Spooks and we told him yes but then when the New York Times
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:41.280]  writes an article about Bilderberg they say that I'm crazy and was like
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:47.400]  imagining the whole thing and psychology today said the same thing I saw
[1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:51.640]  another newspaper article last week saying I was completely insane and just
[1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:55.800]  imagine the Bilderberg meeting and imagine being followed I mean it's
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:29:01.080]  it's that's why the mainstream media is crashing and burning because they lie

[1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:10.800]  broadcasting network network
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:16.360]  humans will offer a chance to assimilate but they review therefore they are enemies of the state
[1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:21.480]  human blood is our most precious resource and our supplies are running out
[1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:28.800]  our families are starving if you capture a human it is law to turn them in here
[1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:34.160]  from Lee Marks pharmaceuticals we keep humans alive
[1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:42.840]  to the farm then for blood jbreakers in theaters everywhere January 8th
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:49.920]  but in reality people are scared of some imaginary vampires sucking their blood
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:54.240]  well we really do have a global government set up by parasites who
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:58.480]  openly say they don't want to share the resources with 80 to 90 percent of us
[1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:02.920]  they want to set up a planetary dictatorship to kill us and that is in
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:06.960]  hundreds of government textbooks the United Nations biological diversity
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:12.880]  assessment 1996 I talk about this 10 years ago people laugh at me now half
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:17.200]  the time I go to the drudge report or the New York Times there's a headline you
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:21.600]  in calls for global one-child policy you in calls for cutting population by 80
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:26.800]  percent england calls for cutting population by 50 percent I mean search
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:30.920]  these terms driving along in your car write it down and search it and then
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:37.600]  say man that guy's pretty normal he's upset about things look at this let me
[1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:40.880]  tell you why our society's all screwed up then I'm gonna get into the health care
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:45.800]  and then enter poll and then your phone calls for Thomas Joe Alan Craig Jim
[1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:48.840]  Michael check I'm trying to get y'all in I tell you why we're all screwed up
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:54.920]  enter poll getting absolute above the law diplomatic immunity and the trick is
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:35:02.400]  when the FBI is internationalized which it is they get immunity totally
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:08.680]  criminal the UN's a private organization set up by the Pentagon in 1945 at the
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:12.440]  Presidio Naval Base as a private consortium to take over the planet and
[1:35:12.440 --> 1:35:16.640]  they get diplomatic immunity US citizens don't even get our Bill of Rights or
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:22.880]  Constitution we don't even get our due process but none of that matters look
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:29.280]  Colt McCoy is the is the big 12 champion our kids futures are secured it
[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:32.440]  doesn't matter if the UN's been caught adding cancer viruses to vaccines
[1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:37.080]  hundreds of times and sterilized to vaccines it doesn't matter if we've
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:41.920]  got a global empire set up that's parasitically sucking our freedoms out
[1:35:41.920 --> 1:35:49.360]  of us no big 12 is what matters oh look this is what I bought last night at the
[1:35:49.360 --> 1:35:53.320]  grocery store my wife sent me out to get some stuff people the scandals that
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:36:04.680]  rocked America oh Mel Gibson Paris Hilton Colby Bryant oh look she shaved
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:16.640]  her head Brittany Spears oh look O.J. Simpson and people pay 1599 $15 I paid
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:22.560]  so I could just show you this idiocy and people get all obsessed about it oh
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:27.080]  this is how they can do some Madison Avenue controls you they brag that they
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:32.800]  sell you on these shallow ideas and sell you on feeling inadequate so they can
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:37.280]  then control you and this is all just tabloid junk people only care about this
[1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:42.880]  and that's why you're gonna get hurt oh big 12 championships oh people scandals
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:50.280]  that rocked America National Enquirer Tigers legal Tigers illegal drug use
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:37:00.520]  Martha's collapse I killed my baby Brittany's abortion nightmare Larry King
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:07.240]  cheating scandal with his wife's sister it doesn't matter if the UN's running
[1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:11.560]  giant child kidnapping rings oh by the way I forgot to get to this last week I
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:16.480]  remember about six months ago a bunch of European papers reported that Israel was
[1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:22.000]  caught killing Palestinians and harvesting their organs and then Netanyahu
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:26.120]  flipped out and threatened and now associated press pull it up Israel
[1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:31.840]  admit taking organs I want to put AP on now now my issue here is this I remember
[1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:37.160]  15 years ago it being on 60 minutes that major US hospitals kill healthy people
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:42.400]  for their organs you didn't know that you didn't know they kill you for your
[1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:48.040]  corneas you didn't know that I mean my dad's a dentist he's not a medical
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:53.280]  doctor and when I was 15 taking my driver's course he said son don't sign
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:57.800]  that organ card I said why and he said word is from doctors and Dallas is they
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:01.680]  they'll kill you for your if you come in just a little bit hurt they'll put you
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:05.360]  under of your blood type matches of some rich person wants it and I thought my
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:10.800]  dad was crazy and then about four years later I'm down in Austin watching 60
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:14.960]  minutes with my grandfather and Dallas was one of the cities listed where they
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:20.920]  will murder you now the point is all these governments are totally criminal
[1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:26.360]  China grabs peaceful Falon Gong Buddhist because they don't take any drugs or
[1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:31.040]  alcohol their organs are so good they have a blood type literally like in the
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:35.640]  movie Daybreakers literally in sales like a package of meat but you're a yuppie
[1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:40.440]  you don't care you rich women get the more expensive collagen that's melted
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:47.720]  down babies injected into your lips just as soon as the police states in place
[1:38:47.720 --> 1:38:53.200]  nobody's gonna care about you either lady so do you understand the real
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:58.040]  vampires that are running our society ladies and gentlemen and you better
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:02.240]  stop caring about this you know I came in today and people at the office asked
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:05.760]  me they said you heard about Charlie sheen getting arrested what do you think
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:11.040]  and I thought about talking about this but what is the point when I've got all
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:14.520]  the serious news I know the truth Charlie knows the truth and that's what
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:19.520]  matters I'll never forget I'll give you you're so addicted to this type stuff
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:26.600]  I'll give you some inside stuff now that I can talk about it in 2006 I was at
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:30.360]  Charlie sheen's house one of many times I've gone and hung out with him and
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:37.040]  worked on things and he just broken up with Denise Richards and I heard him
[1:39:37.040 --> 1:39:40.360]  talk he was he was telling me he said I can't believe all the lies she tells she
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:44.240]  makes stuff up but it doesn't matter I'm gonna take the high road yeah she's
[1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:49.080]  cheating on Heather Locklear who'd been her best friend with her husband and
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:53.080]  bullack a destroyer in the media but I won't tell anybody and plus he knows he
[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:56.480]  could trust me so I wouldn't talk about it and then a year and a half later it
[1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:01.680]  came out that she was doing that and it really hurt her everything that was said
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:06.040]  about him was a lie was all a big setup but some high-powered Republican lawyers
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:10.200]  who were mad at him then it came out in the New York Times that because he was
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:17.600]  gonna put out that that loose change final cut that Mark Cuban got threatened
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:21.880]  by the White House he was smart enough to record it and release the email that
[1:40:21.880 --> 1:40:25.320]  they had to drop that fake case they said we're gonna we're gonna indict you
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:29.400]  for made-up stuff for making this movie I had to keep my mouth shut about that
[1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:34.320]  because they didn't want to talk about it this is the real world this is how
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:40.440]  the real world works and so I know Brooke Charlie's wife know her very well
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:46.440]  she's a nice lady I've never seen Charlie Sheen drink never seen him use
[1:40:46.440 --> 1:40:53.720]  drugs all he drinks is coffee and I've never seen Brooke drink but it's reported
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:58.000]  that she was extremely drunk and it's the thing that women do it's very common
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  where they call the police on you to win the argument I had a girlfriend did that
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  one time she was punching me in the face and I was trying to get out of the
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:14.560]  house out of my own apartment and she said don't leave I'm gonna call the
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:20.320]  police and I said go ahead lunatic and I drove off but the society's designed to
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:23.440]  break up the family so when the cops showed up they went ahead and arrested
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:27.920]  Charlie she since recanted and said well I'm gonna tell the truth I was drunk
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:32.200]  and they tested her blood and she was and he didn't he didn't attack me they
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:36.720]  just oh I'll call the police I'll prove this is but see that doesn't matter I
[1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:42.600]  just spent three minutes on that when it doesn't matter whether Charlie Sheen
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:50.400]  swinging naked from the chandeliers doesn't matter okay what Tiger Woods is
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:54.680]  doing doesn't matter what Martha Stewart's doing doesn't matter but the
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:42:00.040]  average person likes to see somebody big stumble you've been trained how to be
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:04.720]  petty reading Roman philosophers when they described the gladiatorial
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:10.160]  diversions of the circus Maximus how you would share your neighbor being torn
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:16.440]  apart by gladiators or lions one week even though the next week your wife or
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:21.080]  children might be in there it taught everybody to devalue human life like
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:27.040]  violent TV violent video games all of it does today and it taught everybody to
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:32.240]  enjoy seeing others torn apart and the system in Rome 2,000 years ago
[1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:38.320]  scientifically came in and made everybody fight with each other made
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:44.480]  everybody base made everybody demonic so they could be made to fall so hey
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:49.160]  celebrate all these rich people and powerful people falling the thing is

[1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:17.280]  voted by a five vote margin to have the federal government manage the health
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:23.440]  care of everyone in America at a cost of over $1 trillion over the next ten
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:27.920]  years for the first time in American history if this bill becomes law the

[1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:07.320]  mercies of federal bureaucrats it was not intended to be this way we elect the
[1:48:07.320 --> 1:48:13.040]  government it works for us how did it get so removed so unbridled so arrogant
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:18.320]  that it can tell us how to live our personal lives evil rarely comes upon
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:23.280]  us all at once and liberty is rarely lost in one stroke it happens gradually
[1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:28.560]  over the years and decades and even centuries a little stretch here a cave
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:33.400]  in there powers are slowly taken from the states and the people and before you
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:39.000]  know it we have one big monster government that recognizes no restraint
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.040]  on its ability to tell us how to live it claims the power to regulate any
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:49.960]  activity tax any behavior and demand conformity to any standard it chooses
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:55.200]  judge Andrew Napolitano let's set him back up to the show he's always a great
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:58.840]  guest you know I ran out of time to get into health care today so I thought I
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:03.560]  just play that minute and a half clip where he says it all except you got to
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:09.360]  pay for abortions I forgot that part for all these religious people that are
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:16.080]  against their people that have morals it's just unbelievable I mean I read the
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:21.640]  bill and I can't believe it and then Chris Matthews by the way I got a call
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:26.200]  two weeks ago Chris Matthews says he's coming down here to interview me in the
[1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:30.880]  first two weeks of the new year they want to make a special about me a
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:38.440]  special hit piece and I'm not afraid come on down here Matthews of course it'll
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:42.320]  be taped so they can play all the games they want but I don't care I'll walk into
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:46.720]  machine gun fire I'll walk into their propaganda I'm not I'm not gonna turn
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:51.240]  away from a fight especially you're coming to me now Chris Matthews really
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:56.680]  is a rare piece of work he keeps invoking race on every issue you don't
[1:49:56.680 --> 1:49:59.640]  like socialist health care you don't like black people you've all heard those
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:04.720]  clips has nothing to do with it hey I like pepperoni on my pizza oh you don't
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:10.360]  like Eskimos what does it have to do with Eskimos mmm shut up racist it's a
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:15.160]  way for them to race pimp and make it a racial issue and divide people he's a
[1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:21.360]  very very sickening person and now he comes out and says I love my hero is
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:26.280]  Saul Olinsky Saul Olinsky wrote rules for radicals we own a copy of it somewhere
[1:50:26.280 --> 1:50:29.880]  I couldn't find this afternoon bought it years ago where he pledges himself to
[1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:33.760]  Lucifer and and and says his life is dedicated in the books dedicated to
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:42.760]  Lucifer and he wants reeducation camps I mean that's who these people are but
[1:50:42.760 --> 1:50:49.200]  they're not funded by dirty leg hippies they are funded by the banks the
[1:50:49.200 --> 1:50:54.720]  bankers ringwraiths are the communists that's who that he sends forth as his
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:51:02.000]  Nazgul now a literal literal hardcore coming I mean this guy wants you in
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:05.600]  work camps here's Chris Matthews making millions of dollars a year living in a
[1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:10.360]  Georgetown mansion and he wants your money he wants communism I mean these
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:14.840]  people are so sick Chris Matthews knows fully what he is he's a mercenary
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:20.280]  posing as a liberal here he is invoking Saul Olinsky who by the way was
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:25.520]  Barack Obama's mentor here it is really not a good thing to do want to reach back
[1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:30.040]  to one of our heroes from the past from the 60s of Saul linsky once said that
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:34.120]  even though both sides have flaws in their arguments and you can always find
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:38.160]  something nuanced about your own side you don't like and it's never perfect
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:42.600]  you have to act in the end like there's simple black and white clarity between
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:48.680]  your side and the other side either anything in other words lying I mean
[1:51:48.680 --> 1:51:53.080]  folks I have the health care bill they I mean they have real socialist like
[1:51:53.080 --> 1:51:56.760]  Dennis Kucinich and Howard Dean they're not perfect but at least they're honest
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:01.040]  going I'm not gonna vote for this it cuts your Medicare and Medicaid and and
[1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:05.760]  raises everybody's taxes I mean it's a total scam and then I said I'd get into
[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:13.880]  this national reviews got it AP's got it the the new media journal has it I
[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:21.600]  read the executive order this is not hype this this this really happened it's
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:27.920]  executive order 12,425 gives complete and total diplomatic immunity to all
[1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:32.720]  members or designated agents of Interpol this big private police consortium out
[1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:36.840]  of Europe now global one of the dirtiest police organizations on the planet
[1:52:36.840 --> 1:52:41.240]  hooked in with just drug running child kidnapping you can pull up all the
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:45.200]  mainstream news articles about it and they are to have total diplomatic
[1:52:45.200 --> 1:52:50.840]  immunity something police military FBI don't have and they shouldn't have but
[1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:56.000]  worse than that then the FBI of the act through Interpol they do get it so that's
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:59.920]  why he's doing that and so I thought in fact give me a document cam shot for
