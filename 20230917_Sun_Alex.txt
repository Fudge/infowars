[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.360]  You're going to pay somewhere between 20 and 40 percent less than those other countries.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.720]  Same exact drug made by the same exact company.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.620]  The system is breaking down under Joe Biden's powder keg of corruption.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.920]  What we learned by bringing in Hunter Biden's business partner is that the President Biden
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.200]  had lied to the American public.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.960]  He got on conference calls when his son was selling the brand with his clients.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.660]  He literally went to dinners, which we never knew.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.640]  And after the dinners, his son got a Porsche and then more than $3 million.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.660]  Now I know CNN didn't want to do fact checks on everything that I laid out.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.720]  What was interesting was the headline, but more interesting in the fact checks, it was
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.040]  all true.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.920]  They had to acknowledge that every alleged accusation that put us into impeachment inquiry
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920]  is true.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.040]  Across the United States, Soros puppets and power whores are opting to violate their
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.240]  constitutional oaths to suspend the Bill of Rights in favor of feverishly clawing
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.080]  for the power and funds stirred up by emergency declarations rather than finding
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.280]  real solutions for their constituents.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.800]  This public health order has also sparked three lawsuits, whether it's the governor,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.880]  whether it's somebody in our legislature, does not have the authority to impinge on
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.220]  your rights given under the United States Constitution.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.320]  In Oakland, California, Mayor Shang Tao is threatening to use an emergency declaration
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.440]  to install a new police chief.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.100]  And in Vista, California, Mayor Joe Franklin is considering declaring an emergency over
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.300]  the homeless situation while the Soros Foundation retreats from Europe, and more than a dozen
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.940]  prosecutors linked to Soros funded campaign committees or organizations in the United
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.420]  States have left office after resigning, either losing reelection or being removed.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.140]  Hunter Biden is indicted by a special counsel on felony gun charges, and the COVID rollout
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.500]  stumbles to roll down the tracks.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.580]  Tell everybody don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.420]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.820]  Joe Biden and his unscrupulous failing regime gaslight the country into a propagandized
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.460]  hellscape out of sheer panic.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.220]  How confident are you that there will be no evidence that incriminates President
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.660]  Biden and Hunter's business dealings as this goes forward?
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.660]  So you see Republicans in Congress, right, they have spent all year investigating the
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.660]  president.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.660]  That's what they've spent all year doing and have turned up with no evidence, none.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.020]  There is a new CNN poll that shows that we could put that up 61% of the American people
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.700]  think that Biden had at least some involvement in Hunter Biden's business dealings while
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.660]  he served as vice president, right?
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.300]  We know that, you know, he was on a phone one time or he had dinner one time.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.220]  And what Republicans have done is to see there's the evidence he was he was in the
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.220]  room.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.220]  He was at dinner.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.220]  He was on the phone.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.220]  He spoke to his son.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.200]  But there has been no evidence at all zero.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.840]  Why was the president at those meetings on those phone calls?
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.280]  He calls his son every day to check in.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.480]  He calls his other family members to check in to see how they're doing.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480]  He loves them.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.480]  They're a tight knit family.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.640]  This isn't about political revenge.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.840]  We have the bank accounts.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.720]  We can see, man, you can see that the homes that the Bidens own can't be afforded
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.380]  on a congressional or Senate salary.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.040]  You also understand that it's not normal for family members to receive millions of
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.360]  dollars from overseas interests.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.360]  Those things aren't normal.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.780]  That's not normal to have 20 shell companies.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.260]  These things are not normal.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.760]  And it alludes to not only just widespread corruption, but money laundering, if not influenced
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.900]  peddling itself.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900]  That's what we have.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.320]  If you can't see that, if you are, if you are that blunt, look, I'll turn it over
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.320]  to the attorneys.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.320]  People can't see that.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.320]  They think it's political.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.580]  It's because you don't report on it.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.860]  I'm not sure how you know what the American people think, but here's what they might
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.860]  wonder.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.660]  Actually, if you're a federal prosecutor, you would be asking yourself, how can there
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.060]  not have been an indictment for a Farah violation against Hunter Biden?
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.340]  I hate to face public servants, but it is true.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.260]  Now that deep state tool Joe Biden has been thrown to the wolves, the country will
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.980]  enter a state of suspension where foreign power infiltration can thrive.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.740]  And once it's all said and done, Joe Biden will go down as the greatest national
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.980]  security threat the United States has ever endured.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.660]  President actions from the Biden administration have made it clear that they are not only
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.800]  itching to create a digital dollar, but they're willing to trade American's right to financial
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.220]  privacy for a surveillance style CBDC.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.540]  John Bowne reporting.

[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.040]  Good evening.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.520]  I'm Erica Lost.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.760]  An unidentified man is being held for questioning by the FBI for suspected links to last month's
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.960]  biological virus deaths.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.120]  In local news, a dog named Hero takes the grand prize at the annual I wish I could
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.560]  tell you more pertinent news but we're in a rating system here and the key factor
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.240]  is sensationalism.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.480]  They've got you running in circles 9 to 5 and 5 to 9 you're mine.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.240]  I tell you what they want you to know and you consider it the truth.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.240]  Nobody is opening their eyes.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.240]  Our global economy is deflating the world of our lives and natural resources.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.240]  Never you have me.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.240]  Come on.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240]  I've lost you.

[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.240]  about what's happening next.

[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:22.400]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show folks I am your guest host today Chase Geyser filling
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.720]  in for the great Alex Jones it is an honor and a pleasure to be with you this Sunday
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.020]  night the day of our Lord a day which is set to be a day of rest but we are working
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.280]  because we know that the enemy never sleeps lots of crazy news coming in over this weekend
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.920]  it's hard to even know where to start but I think we're gonna go ahead and start
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.240]  with the new developments regarding Russell Brand comedian Russell Brand denies rape
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.720]  sexual assault accusations let's go ahead and go straight to clip 7 and see Brand's
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.620]  response and then we'll dive into the details hello there you awakening wonders now this
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.100]  isn't the usual type of video we make on this channel where we critique attack and
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.720]  undermine the news in all its corruption because in this story I am the news I've
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:13.680]  received two extremely disturbing letters or a letter and an email one from a mainstream
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:21.220]  media TV company one from a newspaper listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.540]  attacks as well as some pretty stupid stuffs like my community festival should be stopped
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.980]  that I shouldn't be able to attack mainstream media narratives on this channel but amidst this
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:37.700]  litany of astonishing rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.220]  absolutely refute these allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.740]  when I was in the newspapers all the time when I was in the movies and as I've written
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.220]  about extensively in my books I was very very promiscuous now during that time of
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.100]  promiscuity the relationships I had were absolutely always consensual I was always
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.340]  transparent about that then almost too transparent and I'm being transparent about
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:06.260]  it now as well and to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal that
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:12.180]  I absolutely deny makes me question is there another agenda at play particularly when we've
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:18.100]  seen coordinated media attacks before like with Joe Rogan when he dared to take a medicine that
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.900]  the mainstream media didn't approve of and we saw a spate of headlines from media outlets across
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.620]  the world using the same language I'm aware that you guys have been saying in the comments
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.900]  for a while watch out Russell they're coming for you you're getting too close to the truth
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.740]  Russell Brand did not kill himself I know that a year ago there was a spate of articles
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.300]  Russell Brand's a conspiracy theorist Russell Brand's right wing I'm aware of news media
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.980]  making phone calls sending letters to people I know for ages and ages it's being clear to me
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.940]  or at least it feels to me like there's a serious and concerted agenda to control these kind of
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.820]  spaces and these kind of voices and I mean my voice along with your voice I don't mind them
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:00.100]  using my books and my stand up to talk about my promiscuous consensual conduct in the past
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:06.660]  what I seriously refute are these very very serious criminal allegations also it's worth
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.460]  mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.580]  that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct apparently in what seems to
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:22.820]  me to be a coordinated attack now I don't want to get into this any further because of the
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:28.420]  serious nature of the allegations but I feel like I'm being attacked and plainly they are working
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:33.940]  very closely together we are obviously going to look into this matter because it's very very
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.940]  serious in the meantime I want you to stay close stay awake but more important than any of that if
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:46.420]  you can please stay free comedian and podcaster Russell Brand was accused of rape and sexual
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:51.220]  assault this week with the actor coming forth to refute the allegations as we just saw in that
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.620]  clip according to the Daily Mail Brand reportedly committed the alleged assault sometime between
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:02.980]  2006 and 2013 when he worked for the BBC the Mail reports four women have alleged sexual
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:09.460]  assault occurred between 2006 and 2013 when Brand was working for the BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4 as
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.860]  well as starring in Hollywood films the actor and comedian is also facing claims of controlling
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:19.540]  abusive and predatory behavior following a joint investigation by the Sunday Times the Times and
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:26.340]  Channel 4 dispatches Jones came out and said I stand with Russell Brand Alex Jones refutes
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.180]  the Russell Brand rape claims go ahead and see what Alex had to say in clip 05
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.220]  the Matrix is coming after Russell Brand anybody that challenges the globalists anybody that
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.020]  challenges big pharma anybody that's popular that comes out against the establishment is
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.660]  going to be accused of assaulting women now if you're Jeffrey Epstein's client list
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.700]  that's a secret as what happened to JFK and the CIA I know Russell Brand personally I
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.820]  knew him back when he was married to Katy Perry he's come on the show a few times we've
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:05.620]  hung out someone awesome I've never seen women throw themselves at anybody like with him
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.100]  and I mean I've seen the old footage of Elvis with women pulling their panties off thrown at
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.900]  him it's like that okay at restaurants at one of those events I went to it was literally women
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:21.940]  jumping at us okay and he's a big guy in person no one ever accused him for the last 15
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:27.380]  years of assault if they say he's a big sweetheart and now because he comes out against big pharma
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.100]  he comes out against the globalist he comes out against the new world order
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.220]  suddenly the allegations are happening to him they've had pis out trying to get women to lie
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.580]  about me for years they haven't found a woman to do it yet because there haven't been many
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.060]  women not like Russell Brand this guy's you know this guy's a beast he's like Harold Flynn
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.820]  so that's incoming because they want to punish people and destroy people that decide to stand
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.660]  with humanity I stand with Russell Brand he's completely innocent that's why we have a
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.060]  statute of limitations so people 10 years later can't make stuff up when you're ultra famous
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.260]  they're doing it to everybody they're doing it to Andrew Tate they're trying to do it to Elon
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.620]  Musk they're trying to do it to me they're trying to do it to Paul Watson they're trying to do it
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.460]  to anybody that stands up to them but we know who the real predators are that's the global
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.340]  let's start world war three with open borders and massive human smuggling so as for me and my
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.980]  family we're going to continue to tell the truth as for M4 we continue to tell the truth
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.580]  and people have to realize this is a pattern here anybody challenges the new world order
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.740]  they come out and say you're a sexual assaulter
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:29.380]  you can throw a rock and hit a white guy in the united states that's been falsely accused of sexual
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.860]  assault especially one who is of political prominence and even more especially someone
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:39.060]  who is not of the left regardless of whether they're republican anyone considered right of
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.740]  center is susceptible and vulnerable to these false allegations and the reason that this
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.140]  vulnerability exists is because they don't have to be true all they have to do is allege
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.180]  that you've committed some sort of assault or some sort of crime and even if they come out
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.580]  months later or even the next day and correct these articles or say that some of the witnesses
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.740]  were found to be lying or something was not consistent about the story of these allegations
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.940]  even if they come out and correct the stories the damage is already done
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.180]  and this is the narrative of the left this is the strategy the tactic of the left
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.100]  regarding all those on the right we'll get more into that i want to talk about how elon
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.660]  musk may be set to bring alex jones back to twitter he hasn't said so explicitly but he
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:23.140]  did say no more canceling enough is enough tech billionaire and ex-boss elon musk's latest
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.220]  indictment against cancel culture has many anticipating the return of radio host alex jones
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:32.500]  to the platform he said no more canceling and then in a now viral post enough is enough
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.660]  in response i believe to ian miles chiang's post musk was responding to social media
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.140]  influencer ian miles chiang calling out the coordinated nature and timing of the rape
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:46.420]  accusations against popular comedian and podcaster russell brand almost immediately the
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.620]  denizens of x asked if musk's sentiments meant the return of the most banned man on the internet
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:58.020]  alex jones so elon hasn't explicitly stated that he would bring alex jones back as far as i
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:03.620]  understand it but it does seem that he is increasingly perturbed by cancel culture and
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.900]  all of the antagonism against truth all the censorship of truth and the defamation of
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:14.500]  those on the right who are of upstanding character and fighting against the globalist new
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.780]  world order we're gonna cut to break and talk more about this in the next segment
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.580]  before we go to break i do want to mention the real red pill plus is back at 25 off

[00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:14.490]  visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today
[00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:22.490]  welcome back to the alex jones show i am your host today chase geyser filling in for the great alex jones himself
[00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:30.490]  we've been covering the russell brand allegations which appear to be another example of a hogwash lies coordinated from the left
[00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.490]  i was doing a little bit of research on that story and if you look at the threads of the original posters
[00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.490]  like we interviewed hundreds of people over years to corroborate these allegations
[00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:46.490]  it's like why are journalists interviewing hundreds of people about whether or not russell brand is a sexual assailant
[00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:51.490]  and literally doing no journalism whatsoever over the last several years
[00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:56.490]  regarding all of the crimes that hunter biden obviously committed with actual evidence in his own writing
[00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:03.490]  from his own texts from his own emails from the laptop which they lied about and is actually real
[00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:09.490]  how many resources are you going to put into whether or not this former hollywood star and successful podcaster
[00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:15.490]  is a sexual assailant when there's a much bigger more important story
[00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.490]  regarding biden corruption that's been going on for over a decade now
[00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.490]  so i just think that's a piece of evidence that this is a setup
[00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:28.490]  they were saying they want to get russell brand for sexual assault
[00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.490]  and so they're going to make up a story and find people willing to allege that he committed these crimes
[00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:37.490]  and the reason they do this is because they know that the more they frame the right wing
[00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:44.490]  as the enemy of the people or as this immoral sort of degenerate basket of deplorables
[00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.490]  as hillary clinton would describe us the more they frame us like this
[00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.490]  the more that they can divide the country against us
[00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:58.490]  and i had experience with that this week on my very own with my best friend for over ten years
[00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.490]  this is somebody that i lived with in college for three years
[00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:09.490]  somebody who was in my wedding party somebody who i actually officiated the wedding of this person
[00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.490]  and i reached out to my friend and i said it's probably just me
[00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.490]  but i've been getting a distant vibe from you lately is everything okay
[00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.490]  and this is the response that he sends back to me
[00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:24.490]  man will always be old friends our lives have taken us in incredibly different directions
[00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:30.490]  i try constantly to reconcile my feelings of genuine brotherhood with you while being honest with myself
[00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.490]  i think you somewhere in the last two to three years spun too far away
[00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:40.490]  the people you have decided to align your life with are not people i want associated with me
[00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.490]  even by second or third degree
[00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.490]  i do fully respect that it's none of my business and you're providing for your family
[00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:51.490]  and i respect that you've that you're allowed to say whatever you want
[00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.490]  i don't intend to change your mind on anything truly i know i wouldn't if i tried anyway
[00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.490]  you're much too smart and driven to back down now
[00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:03.490]  in a way i respect that i just wish i respected how you felt and what you said
[00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:09.490]  it's just weird for me now i realize it seems disingenuous to say i care about you and your family after all of the above
[00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:14.490]  but i do still i accept any weirdness as a consequence for saying all of this
[00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.490]  so my friend broke up with me this week because i'm associated with info wars
[00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.490]  and there's several things going on here that i think are of interest
[00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:28.490]  the first thing i want to point out is that this post got 11.3 million impressions on twitter
[00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.490]  this week which did kick my account into monetization so although i did lose my friend
[00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:38.490]  i did make 112 dollars on twitter this week because of it so i do appreciate that
[00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.490]  i will be taking my wife on a date and appreciation of the loss of this friendship
[00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.490]  but there's several things going on here that i want to point out
[00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.490]  the first thing is i think you somewhere in the last two to three years spun too far away
[00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.490]  the first thing i want to say is that my politics have always been the same
[00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.490]  i read the fountain head by Ayn Rand when i was 17 years old
[00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.490]  and that's what kicked me on this journey of individualism versus collectivism
[00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.490]  i'm not a disciple of Ayn Rand by any means i believe in god she was a devoted atheist
[00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.490]  however i do believe in her philosophy of objectivism to a large extent
[00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:14.490]  and i do believe in individualism over collectivism and doing what is right
[00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:19.490]  for you as an individual over compromising your own life and your own integrity
[00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:24.490]  for the sake of some state sponsored altruistic philosophy
[00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:29.490]  which is really only designed to empower the globalists and enslave individuals worldwide
[00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:34.490]  so my politics haven't changed over the last two to three years at all
[00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.490]  my politics haven't really even changed over the last ten years
[00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.490]  what's changed is the political climate that's what's changed
[00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:43.490]  and ever since trump lost the election quote unquote
[00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:48.490]  the political sentiment in the country the political divide has gotten increasingly heated
[00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:55.490]  and it's only going to get worse and in the context of the increased political tensions that are going on
[00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.490]  the left is deciding to right off the right
[00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.490]  the people you've decided to align with are not people i want associated with me
[00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.490]  even by second or third degree
[00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.490]  first of all we're only like six degrees of separation away from anyone
[00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:14.490]  so to not be associated with someone by third degree is almost impossible in the current climate
[00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.490]  and i just
[00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:26.490]  the shame of it is when you have life experience with somebody for a decade
[00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.490]  and then you realize that the relationship is so fickle
[00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.490]  that it was dependent on your politics aligning the whole time
[00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:39.490]  you realize that maybe your friends weren't even your friends to begin with
[00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.490]  i guess that's the challenge i think of it but the reason that i really want to talk about this
[00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:46.490]  is not just so that i can gripe publicly about what happened to me
[00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:51.490]  but the fact that it got 11.3 million views there were thousands upon thousands of replies
[00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:56.490]  of conservative voices saying oh my daughter won't speak to me anymore because of my politics
[00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:01.490]  or oh i lost my friend too of 20 years this is not something that's just happening to me
[00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:06.490]  it's not something that's just happening to political influencers or right wing influencers
[00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:11.490]  this is something that is happening to patriotic americans all the way across the country
[00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.490]  keep in mind i knew that my friend here was a biden supporter i knew that he voted for biden
[00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:19.490]  i knew that he never voted for trump i didn't care because although i disagreed with him
[00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:24.490]  i knew or assumed that he was doing what he did because of a misunderstanding
[00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:30.490]  he had the right intentions the right reasons i believed he was wrong about those pretenses
[00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.490]  that he was using in order to make the decision to vote for biden totally disagreed with him
[00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.490]  but we didn't talk about politics we just sort of agreed to disagree
[00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.490]  this is not somebody who i was irritating with my political views
[00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:43.490]  it wasn't somebody who i was sending memes all the time
[00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.490]  it's not somebody who i was badgering about their politics
[00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:49.490]  this is somebody who i was willing to keep in my life because i believed he was a good friend
[00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:54.490]  despite the fact that we disagreed politically
[00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:59.490]  and the irony of it is we are constantly called the party of hate
[00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.490]  the party of division the party of intolerance
[00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:08.490]  but their hate for trump is greater than our hate for biden
[00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:13.490]  i can't think of anybody in the world who i disapprove of more than biden and his administration
[00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.490]  who makes me sick every time to see speak
[00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:22.490]  but my hate for him was not enough to alienate me from my close friends and family
[00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.490]  but their hate for trump their trump derangement syndrome is so great
[00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:34.490]  that they will eradicate people from their lives who have any sort of political difference from them
[00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:38.490]  my wife and i were doing some research on this and we found that suburban white liberal women
[00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.490]  are the most likely to cut off friends and family for their political views
[00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:46.490]  and i'm afraid that my friend josh has become a suburban white liberal woman
[00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.490]  stick with us folks we will be back after this break

[00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.730]  the Infowar.
[00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.770]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:29.409]  I am your guest host today, Chase Geyser, filling in for the great Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.409 --> 00:33:34.889]  I know that when you tune in, you always want to see the OG, but it is an honor and a pleasure
[00:33:34.889 --> 00:33:40.730]  to be here substituting for him and to be with you, our incredible guests.
[00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.770]  I wouldn't rather be speaking to any other audience in the world than this audience
[00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.570]  right here, right now.
[00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.790]  There's a new video out showing a child faced with a choice between cookies and a substantial
[00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.450]  monetary reward.
[00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.730]  It's being highlighted as an example of why children shouldn't be allowed to choose their
[00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:56.730]  gender.
[00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.450]  Let's go ahead and check out clip four.
[00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:17.090]  I have $10,000 cash for, wait a minute, this two out of the box Oreo cookies.
[00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:24.610]  Are you sure that's $10,000 cash?
[00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.250]  You want Oreo cookies?
[00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:27.250]  Are you sure?
[00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.250]  Yes.
[00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.250]  Okay.
[00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.250]  Go ahead.
[00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:35.810]  We've got another breaking story that includes a clip of a woman who also would have chosen
[00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.370]  the Oreos over the $10,000.
[00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.850]  Let's go ahead and go straight into clip three, and then we'll dive into the new
[00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.810]  developments with Dove.
[00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:46.870]  My belief is that we should be centering the voices and experiences of the most marginalized
[00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.070]  people in communities at all times.
[00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:52.650]  So when I think about what that liberation looks like to me, it looks like centering
[00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:57.770]  the voices and the experiences of those who live in and who maneuver through spaces
[00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:59.850]  and institutions in a fat body.
[00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:04.250]  It looks like making accessible spaces and having conversations that are aware of
[00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:08.810]  the fact that people have different bodies and that they are interacting with space
[00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:12.650]  and people and institutions and communities in a different way.
[00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.070]  Fat liberation looks like fully embracing those differences and having those conversations
[00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.810]  instead of shying away from them.
[00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:24.970]  To learn more about fat liberation and the campaign for size freedom that Dove is supporting,
[00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:30.130]  visit dove.com forward slash size freedom, tap in, join the campaign, support the campaign.
[00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:33.009]  This is important and we should all be talking about it.
[00:35:33.009 --> 00:35:37.290]  The Dove Soap Company is facing criticism for promoting the fat acceptance and body positivity
[00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:42.290]  movement by hiring a morbidly obese BLM activist who at one time falsely accused
[00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:46.650]  a female college student of making a racist remark.
[00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:50.930]  Last week, the Unilever owned soap brand announced it had partnered with University of
[00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:57.770]  Virginia student, Zianna Bryant, to lead their movement to end body size discrimination.
[00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.890]  It's funny how they call it a movement given that it involves people who don't move
[00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:01.890]  at all.
[00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.930]  The new face of Dove Soap, will you still buy at Dove products after this?
[00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:10.050]  My belief is that we should be centering the voices and brand experiences of the most
[00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:13.090]  marginalized people in communities at all times, Bryant 22 said in the video that we
[00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:19.810]  just watched, and this all in the context of the fact that she defamed someone and falsely
[00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:20.810]  accused them of racism.
[00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.370]  This ties in directly with what we were talking about with Russell Brand, right?
[00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:27.690]  They'll come out, they'll falsely accuse you of sexual assault, they'll defame you
[00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.710]  and they will do everything they can to do things like alienate best friends from
[00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.029]  over 10 years of wanting to be associated with you.
[00:36:34.029 --> 00:36:38.290]  And then when they are proven to falsely come out against you with accusations of
[00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:46.690]  either sexual assault or racism, they will still be sponsored by major brands like Dove
[00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.009]  and given major opportunities.
[00:36:48.009 --> 00:36:54.970]  Is this Dove moment synonymous with what we saw with the Bud Light issues earlier
[00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:56.090]  this year?
[00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.990]  Why is it that these major corporations are making these decisions that they know or they
[00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:06.330]  must know from a business perspective are only going to alienate half of their audience?
[00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:11.930]  The smart businesses out there don't take a political stance on controversial issues
[00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:17.090]  like this because they know that it's going to alienate the market, divide their market,
[00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:18.970]  split their consumer base in half.
[00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.730]  It happens time and time again, yet they keep making these decisions.
[00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:25.850]  Is it just because they're hiring stupid people who don't understand business and
[00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:30.650]  only think in the context of social justice and collectivism and Marxism?
[00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:35.490]  Is it literally just incompetence or is there a reason that they're doing this?
[00:37:35.529 --> 00:37:40.650]  We've seen in recent reports that ESG is something that sort of seems to be on the fall, right?
[00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:46.250]  This environmental sustainability and governance initiative, which was pushed by organizations
[00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:52.069]  like the WEF and people like Klaus Schwab as a new way of controlling which businesses
[00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:57.410]  receive financing from central banks and major investors.
[00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:01.810]  We've seen that major entities, those we're typically antagonistic toward, have come
[00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.290]  out and said they're going to take ESG less seriously.
[00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:08.970]  They're going to not consider ESG as much because it is this sort of arbitrary subjective
[00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:12.930]  litmus test for which businesses can get funding, which businesses can be financed
[00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.010]  or not.
[00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:19.490]  Even though we see that ESG seems to be on the decline, we seem to see this backpedaling
[00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:25.890]  or this pulling away from ESG as a litmus test, these ESG scores, we still see businesses
[00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.050]  making decisions to do this.
[00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:33.010]  I don't understand why these businesses are doing this at all when they know that it's
[00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:37.890]  just going to totally compromise the integrity of their business altogether.
[00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.970]  Is something major coming where it doesn't even matter whether or not these businesses
[00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.710]  are successful and they're just trying to make sure they're on the, quote, right
[00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.590]  side of history?
[00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.990]  The other thing I was thinking about this week is just the notion of the right side
[00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.990]  of history.
[00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:55.050]  We constantly see the left, I certainly do in my reply, say, oh, you're going to be
[00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:58.770]  on the wrong side of history, you're going to be on the wrong side of history.
[00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:02.590]  When everything shakes out and when good finally prevails, they're going to look back
[00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:06.310]  and say, you were the problem, you were the evil ones, and I think that's so interesting
[00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:12.910]  because for a political philosophy that doesn't seem to believe in the objective truth of
[00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.610]  good versus evil or in objective truth at all, this is a philosophy that believes
[00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:22.950]  only in subjectivism, right, your truth versus my truth.
[00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:26.630]  How can they come out and say that we're going to be on the wrong side of history?
[00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.350]  Because to say that anyone is going to wind up on the wrong side of history at all is
[00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.590]  to say a couple of things implicitly.
[00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:37.150]  The first thing is to say that there is a good versus evil, and the second thing is
[00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:43.529]  that it is to say that good will prevail and evil will fail, right?
[00:39:43.529 --> 00:39:47.390]  How can anyone be on the wrong side of history if good doesn't always win?
[00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:52.670]  So they're inherently sort of making a Christian claim, though they don't believe in Christianity
[00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:59.430]  whatsoever or any of the values that our founders established this country on.
[00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:04.630]  And the other factor of that is they're implicitly stating that good is going to win
[00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:05.950]  if you're going to be on the wrong side of history.
[00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:14.630]  Do they actually believe that good always wins and that evil is always overcome?
[00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:20.190]  Because we know here at Infowars that history is written by the victors and just because
[00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:27.970]  it is written doesn't necessarily make it true, so I just think it's very interesting
[00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:31.730]  that we're seeing these decisions being made and we're seeing these accusations of who's
[00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.050]  going to be on the right side of history, who's going to be on the good side of history,
[00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:39.810]  and I agree that there is a good versus evil and that there is objective truth.
[00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:48.090]  And I do believe that in the end, good always wins, but I'm not so self-righteous
[00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:56.130]  that I would presume to accuse someone else of going to be on the wrong side of history.
[00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:00.410]  I may reiterate the claims made in the Bible or the claims of my faith to that effect,
[00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:05.450]  that judgment will come for the evil, that the evil will face judgment and the voice
[00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:11.490]  of God, but to claim that we'll be on the wrong side of history is such a threat,
[00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.970]  especially in the context of everything that happened in the 20th century.
[00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:19.490]  I mean, the wrong side of history just inherently triggers thoughts of what happened
[00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:21.770]  in the Holocaust and with the Nuremberg trials, right?
[00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:25.490]  All those Nazis are on the wrong side of history.
[00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:31.410]  So is the left suggesting that there will be trials and tribunes and that we will be
[00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:36.970]  faced with an international court which will judge us for our sins of thought crime
[00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:41.810]  and that when we are found guilty and it is written in the books of history what
[00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:46.770]  happened in the 21st century when the right wing insurrectionists attempted to compromise
[00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:53.610]  the integrity and threaten our democracy, are we being threatened implicitly by being
[00:41:53.610 --> 00:42:01.410]  accused of being on the wrong side of history with the death penalty, with imprisonment?
[00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:02.330]  I think we are.
[00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:06.450]  I think that when they say we'll be on the wrong side of history, what they're
[00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:11.250]  really saying is we're going to classify you as a domestic terrorist,
[00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:15.450]  akin to the Nazis after World War II.
[00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.930]  You are going to face a rigged court for your crimes.
[00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:23.330]  You are going to be found guilty and you are going to face punishment of the state
[00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.250]  beyond anything you could possibly imagine.
[00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.529]  And we are the evil ones.
[00:42:29.529 --> 00:42:30.170]  Stick with us, folks.
[00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.410]  We will be back after this break.
[00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:34.770]  Make sure you visit infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:37.410]  It is how we keep this broadcast coming to you.
[00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:44.130]  As we age, pregnant alone levels decrease with age by as much as 60% between the
[00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.529]  ages of 20 and 75, making you tired and lazy.
[00:42:47.529 --> 00:42:50.650]  The Real Red Pill Plus, you can defy that test of time and keep your pregnant
[00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:52.529]  alone up for hormone balance.
[00:42:52.529 --> 00:42:53.170]  Stick with us, folks.
[00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.250]  We will be back after this break.
[00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:56.450]  Visit infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:01.050]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:01.690]  Thought it was next week.
[00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:02.770]  I come in this morning.
[00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.090]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.330]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:12.130]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.050]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:18.170]  Look how full this bottle is.
[00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.130]  Right to the top, folks.
[00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:26.970]  Right to the top with these 95% humanoids.
[00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.810]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.210]  Some are maybe 10%.
[00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.890]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.650]  This is 95%.
[00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:38.770]  Super constant.
[00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:42.650]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.130]  It's that powerful.
[00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.250]  Or more.
[00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.810]  So they're available at infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:51.450]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:53.970]  Pulled out for almost eight months back in stock
[00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:59.290]  at infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.290]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two
[00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:04.170]  years that our amazing high quality coffee has not
[00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:05.050]  been available.
[00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.250]  And that's because the prices went up too high
[00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.850]  for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:11.529]  I turned down so many companies
[00:44:11.529 --> 00:44:12.890]  that wanted to work with us.
[00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.090]  But now we have brought back the coffee.
[00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.730]  And it's even better from a national supplier
[00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.450]  that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:25.650]  It's powered by the company, Minuteman Coffee.
[00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:29.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best
[00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:34.210]  smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.050]  It is game-changing.

[00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.830]  I know you're going to be hooked,
[00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:41.690]  which will then fund our Operation A360 win.

[00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:01.370]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:03.290]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.529]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:06.930]  But some of their operations are
[00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.730]  going to take decades to stop.
[00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.290]  But one thing you can do right now
[00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:12.930]  is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.210]  by purifying the water that you drink
[00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.890]  and that you cook with.
[00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:18.610]  And you do it with the highest quality
[00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.490]  gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.690]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.050]  You can sit there and put hundreds
[00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:25.370]  of gallons through it a day.
[00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.410]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out
[00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:30.010]  thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:31.970]  This is what I use, which my family uses.

[00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:48.690]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.130]  This is one of the main areas we
[00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:52.010]  can take control of our lives and stop
[00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:53.850]  the globalists from hitting us with poison
[00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.529]  that they allow in the water supply.
[00:46:55.529 --> 00:46:59.210]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:17.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.320]  I am your host today, Chase Geyser, filling in for Alex Jones himself, covering all the
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.600]  news that has been breaking this weekend.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.880]  Thank you so much for being with us.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:36.400]  Make sure that you call in 877-789-2539 as we will be taking calls in the next hour.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.760]  Again, that's 877-789-2539.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.600]  The earlier you call, the more likely we can get to you on the show today.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.040]  Thank you so much for tuning in.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:51.880]  I do want to talk about the German MEP urging citizens worldwide to peacefully disobey
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.600]  COVID tyranny.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:59.780]  German European Parliament member Christine Anderson told the group this week she'd continue
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:04.240]  fighting for the freedoms of people across the globe, but asked that in return citizens
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:10.440]  everywhere peacefully reject the incoming wave of COVID mandates and lockdowns, as
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.040]  Alex Jones predicted weeks ago on this show.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.720]  Let's go to clip 01.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.960]  Now I would like to make a promise to the people, and I'm pretty sure I can speak or
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.880]  speak on behalf of my colleagues.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:31.680]  We will continue to stand with you, the people.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:37.160]  We will continue to fight for freedom, democracy and the rule of law.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.760]  We will not shut up.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:49.960]  And we will not stop going after those despicable, globalitarian misanthropists.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:57.040]  But we would also like to have you make a promise to us.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.520]  You may have heard it's all coming back.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:05.280]  The first country is already starting about talking mass mandates in Israel.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.640]  They're already imposing it.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.840]  I've heard of a few universities in the United States.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.760]  They're already bringing it all back.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:24.440]  And I would really like for you, the people, to not go along.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.880]  Simply say no.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.440]  They want you to wear a mask?
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.680]  Say no.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.560]  They want you to put in another mRNA shot?
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.820]  Say no.
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.280]  They want to impose a curfew on you?
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.040]  Say no.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.960]  That's really all you have to do.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:48.960]  It might sound a little hard, but it's actually not that hard.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:55.480]  Because once you've made it clear to them that you will no longer go along, once you've
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:00.900]  let them know, they cannot scare you anymore.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:06.180]  Because as long as you're afraid of what they might do, if you don't comply, they
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:08.520]  have power over you.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:12.340]  Take the power away from them.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.000]  Simply say no.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.780]  Once you do that, they don't have power over you anymore.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.300]  You will feel so free.
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:26.680]  Simply say no.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:32.920]  And considering what we've heard today, and considering what we've seen in the last three
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:42.740]  years, considering what we know they want to implement, heck, you might even be well
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:49.720]  within your right to tell them to screw themselves and go to hell.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.260]  That's where they belong.
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.020]  What will you get out of that?
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.260]  I can tell you.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:51:00.380]  Once you've done that, once you've told them to just go to hell, they no longer
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:06.420]  have power over you, you will have an incredible feeling.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:12.300]  Kind of like a sensation of freedom will swap through your body, I promise.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.460]  You will feel so relieved.
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:21.660]  And this is the state of mind that I would ask all of you to get to.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.760]  Simply don't let them grind you down anymore.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.360]  You are worth it.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:35.160]  You are deserving of just standing up for yourselves and tell them all to go to hell.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.800]  Thank you very much.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:43.700]  This, of course, all in the context of recent revelations.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:49.800]  Bill Gates' massive COVID profiteering exposed in a viral social media post.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:55.640]  So we talk a lot on the show about globalism in general, the New World Order, and these
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.540]  moves or motions for depopulation.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:04.600]  And I know there's a lot of theories out there as to why things like these vaccines
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.600]  come in place.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:10.940]  A lot of people suggest that these pandemics, these emergencies are used as a pretext to
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:16.460]  compromise, weaken, or mitigate the rights of individual people so that the state can
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:24.500]  continuously become increasingly empowered to subjugate the people of the world.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:30.800]  Perhaps these lockdowns are done because small businesses are seen as competitors to major
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:36.960]  corporations and companies like Amazon or major fast food chains understand that they
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:43.900]  can sustain the hardship of lockdowns much better than mom and pop shops or small businesses.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:50.480]  So a great way to eradicate the middle class competition is to enact lockdowns that put
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:55.560]  small business owners out of business so that major corporations can buy up the property,
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:01.440]  buy up the assets, merge and conglomerate their control over the market.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:08.600]  We hear that these pandemics are a great way to mitigate individual rights as far
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.180]  as choosing what one does with their own body is concerned, right?
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:15.560]  So we have these emergencies and we're not going to officially say that we're mandating
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.660]  the vaccine, but we're going to create such an environment where millions upon millions
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:22.980]  of Americans feel like they have to take a vaccine even if they don't want to because
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:26.860]  they are afraid of losing their job or not being able to travel or see loved ones or
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.140]  go to the funeral of loved ones.
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:33.480]  But one thing is for sure, despite all of those previous speculations, which I happen
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:40.760]  to agree with, one thing is for sure, there were some people among us who had a tremendous
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:46.060]  amount of money to be made off of this pandemic.
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:49.880]  A viral social media post revealing how much Bill Gates profited from the COVID pandemic
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.100]  was viewed over 2 million times in just two days.
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:56.180]  I'm sure it's up since the publication of this article on the 16th.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:02.640]  Let's go into clip 02 and I will dive into the story more after that.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:11.780]  The deaths, it's been completely horrific and I would expect that will lead the R&D budgets
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:15.320]  to be focused on things we didn't have today.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.480]  We didn't have vaccines that block transmission.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.160]  We got vaccines to help you with your health, but they only slightly reduced the transmissions.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:27.720]  We need a new way of doing the vaccine.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:34.560]  Bill Gates purchased shares in BioNTech, Pfizer's partner for its mRNA COVID shots, in September
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:39.080]  of 2019, just months before the pandemic was announced.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:47.380]  And keep in mind that September of 2019 is when many experts believe that the COVID virus
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:49.800]  actually leaked from the Wuhan labs.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.500]  There are bits and pieces of evidence that seem to imply that is the case.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:58.660]  One of them, I believe, is that there was an RFP, a request for proposal for new ventilation
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:04.960]  systems that was put out by the CCP in September of 2019 specifically for the Wuhan lab.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.280]  I believe that this RFP was later removed from their site, but it does imply that there
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:14.340]  might have been some sort of leak or contamination issue at the lab at that time.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:20.440]  And Bill Gates being Bill Gates, the billionaire known worldwide who is intimately involved
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.720]  in vaccinations worldwide, would be among those first to know if such an event were
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.720]  to take place.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:30.940]  So in September of 2019, just months before the pandemic was announced, but when the
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:37.000]  pandemic actually started, Bill Gates is buying shares in BioNTech.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:46.620]  He purchased 1,038,674 shares at an offering price of $18.10.
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:50.780]  This is a pre-public offering price, by the way, so he was definitely an insider
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:51.780]  here.
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:59.780]  And Gates dumped his stocks in November of 2021 for an astronomical amount of $300 per
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.360]  share on average.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:07.120]  So I'm not in a position to do the math right now on that, but he made millions upon
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:15.120]  millions upon millions of dollars investing in this mRNA technology and lying about the
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.000]  vaccine for years in order to ensure that his share prices went up.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.260]  And frankly, I think that this is one of the main reasons that the J&J vaccine was
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.600]  taken off the market so quickly.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:31.740]  Because when you have the likes of Bill Gates investing in this technology at prices of
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:37.240]  $18 a share later to be sold for an average of $300 a share, and then you have a competitor
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:43.580]  come out with a vaccine that is not an mRNA-based technology, but rather a traditional
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:47.660]  vaccine, which is just a piece of the dead or weakened virus injected into the body
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:54.660]  for the immune system to respond to, that really does harm the potential gains of
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.080]  these investments.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.500]  So my thinking is that the J&J vaccine was not taken off of the market because it was
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:05.140]  perceived as increasingly dangerous or less effective than the mRNA vaccines, because
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:09.040]  we know that the mRNA vaccines were dangerous and ineffective.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:14.260]  But it was taken off the market because billionaire Bill Gates and the political class
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:17.240]  were invested in the mRNA tech.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:22.880]  They did insider trading, buying shares, $18 a share later to sell them for $300 a share,
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.360]  and they wanted to make sure that everybody got their vaccine so they could make millions
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.760]  upon millions of dollars.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.160]  Even though there was probably a safer alternative on the market, they had to take that one
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:34.800]  off because eight people got blood clots in their legs after they got vaccinated.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.800]  Stick with us, folks.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.800]  We'll be back after this break.

[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:15.040]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.820]  You know, Alex said when we first played that liner, I didn't write that, I'm not
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.500]  the last beacon of hope, but I wrote that liner and I think he's the last beacon
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.780]  of hope against a world of deception, against a new world order.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:43.340]  But there are many that are in the fight, but it's so important to support Infowars
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:50.140]  because we truly are a very special network in this fight for freedom against the establishment
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:52.820]  of the globalist elite and the new world order.

[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:03.740]  in the next segment.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:07.460]  We might take a call to segment two, but before we go into calls, I do want to talk
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.140]  a little bit about James O'Keefe who is filing a lawsuit against Hawaii governor
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:14.620]  over criminalization of journalism.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:18.220]  James O'Keefe is teaming up with attorney Mike Yoder to sue the governor of Hawaii
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:24.180]  after a new provision prohibits journalists from investigating in the wake of the Maui
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.180]  wildfires.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:31.380]  Let's go ahead and play clip 06 and then we'll dive in after that.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.860]  So I'm with attorney Mike Yoder who has decided to file a lawsuit in light of some
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:36.860]  of these revelations.
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.100]  Mike, what do you intend to do?
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:44.700]  The first and most important thing is just so people in Hawaii understand that what we're
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:50.260]  trying to do is ensure that the land that they are so, you know, sincere about
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.300]  and that they care so much about isn't taken from them a second time.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.780]  A lot of the animosity and hostility is understandable based on the history and the culture
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:02.700]  that is very deeply rooted in Hawaii, but if we don't have the freedom of the press,
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:06.580]  we don't have the freedom of speech, and people are kept in the dark as to what the
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:11.140]  government's doing and what is going on, there's no way to ever have a people-led
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.480]  or people-controlled society.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.900]  So the first step we're going to take down is the suppression of electronic media
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.220]  and make sure people are able to speak freely.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:22.220]  Second step is to take out the criminal provisions of people exercising the rights
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.500]  that are guaranteed under both the U.S. Constitution and the Hawaiian Constitution.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.420]  And this is the statute, the revised statute that we've been hearing about?
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:33.420]  Statute 127A-13 is where the provisions are.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.620]  They're criminalizing it under Section 29.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.820]  If people want to support you, how can they do that?
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.820]  You guys can go to MauiLegalPreservationFund.org.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:42.820]  I'm not taking a dollar for any of the people here.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.620]  I'm representing them entirely for free.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.020]  I'm also not doing it on contingency.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.220]  There's nothing that's coming out of these people's pockets.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:52.020]  It's mainly to preserve and protect their land, and we're just trying to make sure
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.120]  that the government is kept in check.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.020]  Otherwise, they will go unhinged.
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:03.220]  So we can see there that James O'Keefe is fighting for truth against corruption,
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:08.620]  as always, which is probably why he is no longer with Project Veritas.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.020]  I tell you what, man, as soon as you get a board of directors,
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.220]  that's how you know that a company is about ready to go under.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.820]  I mean, not necessarily under financially, but all of its integrity,
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:19.820]  all of its mission statements, all of its values are about to be compromised
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.820]  as soon as a board of directors comes in place instead of a CEO.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.620]  We saw this happen with Google.
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:25.620]  It goes public.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:29.520]  Within a number of years, they removed don't be evil from their mission statement.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.820]  We saw this happen with Facebook.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.620]  It used to be the best social media platform in the world.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.220]  It went public.
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.320]  Now it's totally woke, and it totally sucks to be on, right?
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.420]  We saw this happen with Apple.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.020]  It went public.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:38.920]  They fired Steve Jobs.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.120]  The company almost went over.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.720]  Then they had to bring Steve back and basically give him executive authority
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.420]  over everything in order to save the company.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.620]  We saw it happen with Twitter.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.220]  They went public.
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:46.920]  They got a board.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.420]  They went woke.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.020]  They started censoring everyone, and now it's finally good again
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:54.220]  because it's reprivatized, and there's actually a CEO at the helm.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.820]  Make sure that you call 877-789-2539.
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:01.720]  Again, that is 877-789-2539.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.920]  After this break coming up in a minute, we are going to be taking your calls.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.920]  I want to hear what you think about everything that's going on
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.720]  as far as Bill Gates is concerned, as far as Russell Brand is concerned,
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.820]  as far as these Maui wildfires are concerned.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:15.020]  I'm going to dive in a little bit more on that in the next segment too,
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.220]  right as we take calls.
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:20.320]  In the meantime, make sure you visit infowarsstore.com

[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:50.220]  but it is in support of the greatest network
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.420]  fighting the greatest evil this world has ever seen,
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.520]  that is the New World Order
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.820]  and the globalist conglomeration of all power
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:59.520]  and subjugation of humanity.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.820]  The wicked plot against the righteous
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.820]  and gnash their teeth at them,
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.520]  but the Lord laughs at the wicked,
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.020]  for he knows their day is coming.
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.420]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.320]  to bring down the poor and needy
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.020]  to slay those whose ways are upright,
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.320]  but their swords will pierce their own hearts
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.420]  and their bows will be broken.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.620]  Better the little that have righteousness
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.520]  than the wealth of many wicked,
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.720]  for the power of the wicked will be broken,
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.720]  but the Lord upholds the righteous.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.520]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.820]  and their inheritance will endure forever.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.120]  In times of disaster, they will not wither.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.120]  In days of famine, they will have plenty,
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.320]  but the wicked will perish.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.420]  Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field,
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:48.320]  they will be consumed and they will develop in smoke.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.320]  CHEERING
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.820]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:14.820]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.820]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.920]  I'm Chase Geyser, filling in for the great Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.220]  And what you're hearing there is a beautiful song,
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.820]  I believe, called The Ecstasy of Gold,
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.620]  which was famously featured at the end of
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:36.620]  The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly with Clint Eastwood.
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:40.820]  Sort of a prescient theme,
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.720]  given that scene at the end of
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.020]  The Good Guy, of course, Clint Eastwood,
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.620]  The Bad Guy, and The Ugly Man,
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:53.520]  all knowing a piece of the puzzle to find the hidden gold.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.920]  And you see their desperation as they're willing to do anything,
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:00.320]  to compromise any value, any morality,
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:04.020]  in order to trick the others out of their share of the gold
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.320]  and take it all for themselves.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.720]  That's what's happening today.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.920]  That's what's going on today.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:11.320]  We have The Bad and The Ugly in power
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.920]  trying to do everything they can to trick good people,
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.020]  honest people, out of their share of the earnings from the work that they do.
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:21.220]  We see this in that we're hyper-taxed
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:24.820]  and that our taxes aren't spent on any goods or infrastructure for these people
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.020]  or to empower America,
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.220]  but are given to the morally compromised and corrupt in Ukraine.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.220]  We see that these resources are used
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.920]  to help all of our enemies all over the world,
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.920]  whether in the Middle East, whether in Europe,
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:45.120]  whether in Taiwan, even in China,
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.720]  all these resources go away from us,
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.420]  towards our enemies,
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:54.220]  so that our political class can get the kick back.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.320]  It's exactly what we're experiencing in the world today.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.220]  I don't know if you noticed this week,
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:01.420]  but millions of dollars were diverted from Egypt,
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.620]  from the United States,
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:06.820]  to Taiwan to bolster their defense in the face of the warships
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.720]  that are now surrounding the island.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.420]  It looks like China is in a position to invade Taiwan
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.920]  given all of the resources and distractions
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.320]  the United States is committed to in Ukraine.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.120]  This would be an ideal time for China to act.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.620]  We are at the weakest that we have ever been as a nation
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.820]  since the Civil War.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.420]  So if China is ever going to take Taiwan,
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.620]  now would be the time to do it
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:33.720]  because we in the United States aren't in a position
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.320]  to mitigate that, to counteract that.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.420]  And I'm not suggesting that we ever go to war with China over Taiwan.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.220]  I don't think that we should go to war with superpowers
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.020]  on behalf of other nations at all.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.420]  I am a populist.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.820]  I believe in America first 100%.
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.820]  But I also do believe in protecting the interests
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.320]  of the United States of America,
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.920]  in protecting the national security
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.420]  of the United States of America
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.620]  in such a way that through trade and negotiation
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.120]  and international relations,
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.220]  we don't ever arrive at a problem
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.720]  where we have to actually make a decision
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.020]  whether to go to war or not with a superpower
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.220]  on behalf of our interests.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.820]  But when you have weak leaders,
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:12.020]  this is what we're faced with.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.520]  Jordan Peterson famously said,
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:17.220]  if you're concerned about what a strong man in power will do,
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.220]  someone like Donald Trump,
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.120]  just wait till you see what a weak man in power will do.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.920]  And that's what we've seen here in the United States.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.320]  We have seen what America looks like
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.220]  when a weak man is in leadership
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:32.420]  and it is hell to pay.
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:35.620]  Make sure you call in 877-789-2539.
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:38.620]  And first up, I want to take a call from John in Tallahassee.
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.820]  John, how are you, sir?
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.520]  Doing okay. How about you?
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.420]  I'm doing well. Thank you for your call.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:48.120]  All right, well, AKA Johnny Pray Train,
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.220]  but that's besides the point.
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.420]  What I want to say is,
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.420]  I wonder if it can be investigated
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.820]  how much money Bill Gates is going to make
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.020]  on a vaccine for malaria
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:03.820]  now that he's done set mosquitoes loose in Florida and Texas
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:06.420]  and God knows where.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.220]  You know, the people in India and Africa,
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.220]  they don't like him for all the vaccines
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:12.620]  he's put over there.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.020]  Yeah, that's a really good point.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.820]  You know, this is one of the funny things
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.520]  about Bill Gates to me,
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.820]  is that people talk about how he gave his entire wealth away.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:26.020]  He's donated everything that he made from Microsoft
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.820]  to the fighting against the disease
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:31.320]  in third world impoverished countries
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.120]  to the establishment of safety and resources
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:37.120]  and green energy and health to people all over the world.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.420]  He's done so much good
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.120]  since he was the founder of Microsoft with his wealth,
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.020]  but time and time again,
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.320]  we see that he's making investment decisions,
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.820]  not for the good of the people,
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.920]  but so that he can make millions upon millions of dollars.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.320]  I mean, you don't spend,
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.720]  you don't buy a million 38,000 shares of BioNTech
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.920]  at $18 a share and then sell it a year and a half later
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.720]  or two years later for $300 a share
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.320]  because you love humanity so much.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.020]  You do it so you can make tens and tens
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.120]  of millions of dollars,
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.320]  if not hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.820]  off of that business deal.
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:11.020]  And when you have insider knowledge like that
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.020]  and when you have incentive to lie about products
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.120]  in the public health sector
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.420]  in order to make millions upon millions of dollars like that,
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.320]  it's not something that you're doing to save humanity.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.320]  And frankly,
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.920]  if you look at it from an altruistic perspective,
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.220]  let's just measure up
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.820]  how much good Bill Gates did for humanity
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:35.820]  at Microsoft versus since Microsoft
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.020]  with all of his vaccine baloney, right?
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.220]  I mean, Microsoft,
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.520]  whether you like Microsoft or not,
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.820]  whether you like Bill Gates or not,
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.320]  you have to admit it put the internet
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.920]  and computing in the hands of poor people
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.320]  all over the world.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.420]  There are people in India right now
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:53.820]  that are able to do things like graphic design,
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.120]  software development, web development,
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.620]  that are able to provide for their families
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:58.920]  for the first time in a way
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.620]  that was not possible before Microsoft
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.920]  because of Microsoft,
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.120]  because of things like Windows 95, Windows 98,
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.420]  Windows XP, these operating systems.
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.720]  And then all the hardware
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.320]  that was cheap enough for the first time ever
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.520]  that a college didn't have to spend $100,000
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.420]  on a supercomputer
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.520]  in order for somebody to do a little bit of math,
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.020]  but everybody could have a computer more powerful
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.020]  than the computation used to get astronauts to the moon
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.620]  in their own home,
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.820]  even in a third world home, right?
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:30.120]  So I contend that Bill Gates,
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120]  through his work at Microsoft,
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.420]  did much more to actually help vulnerable,
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.620]  disenfranchised, and poor people
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.720]  all over the world
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.220]  than anything that he's ever done altruistically
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:44.920]  through any charity since he left Microsoft.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.620]  And it's just a testament to the fact
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:50.220]  that capitalism is actually better for the poor
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.520]  than collectivism.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.220]  Capitalism is better for the vulnerable than altruism.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.620]  Doing things out of your own self-interest
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.520]  with a moral compass, right,
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.120]  not at the expense of other people,
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.420]  but building giant companies
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.320]  that offer legitimate value to people all over the world
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.120]  actually helps the poor people
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.520]  more than just trying to enforce your agenda
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.720]  or your ideals or your view on humanity
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.220]  by throwing billions upon billions of dollars
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.520]  at wasteful nonprofits.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:22.820]  I want to take more calls.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.920]  Make sure you call in 877-789-2539.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.720]  We've got time for one more call before we cut to break.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.920]  Let's hear from Alex in Michigan.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.320]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.520]  Hey, how's it going, man?
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.120]  Good, man, thanks for your call.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.020]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk about
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.320]  how the Illuminati is run,
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.320]  and it's run by the Jesuits.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.920]  Okay, tell me more.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.720]  And so it's the Freemasons also,
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.120]  the high-level Freemasons.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.620]  I understand you're a Freemason.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:56.920]  Maybe you're only a Blue Lodge
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.620]  and don't know what's going on higher up,
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:01.620]  but the Jesuits use Freemasonry
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.620]  to fulfill the needs of the Black Pope in Rome
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:09.820]  who runs Washington, D.C. through Georgetown University
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.320]  and the Masonic Lodge there in D.C.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.920]  Okay, I'm a member of Federal Lodge Number One in D.C.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.520]  It's among several Masonic Lodges in D.C.,
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.220]  and I can tell you for a fact
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.620]  that Freemasonry has nothing to do
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:25.420]  with the existing conspiracies around the Illuminati
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.020]  or the New World Order or the Black Pope.
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:30.520]  Frankly, I believe it's still against the Catholic Church
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.320]  to even be a member of a Masonic Lodge
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.520]  because the Masonic Lodges
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.920]  were associated with the Reformation
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.020]  and freedom of thought and freedom of speech
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.620]  in a time where the Catholic Church
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:41.620]  sought to mitigate all of those freedoms
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.720]  and have complete control over free speech.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.720]  And I think that anyone out there in the audience
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.220]  who goes to visit a Masonic Lodge,
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:49.520]  which visitation is open to the public
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.220]  on the nights that they meet for dinner,
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.820]  for guests to ask questions,
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:54.820]  you'll find that these are not the people
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.620]  that you would think would take over the world.
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:57.820]  If we are taking over the world,
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:00.920]  we're certainly doing it one spaghetti dinner at a time,
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.620]  one cookie sale at a time.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:06.620]  So you can say, oh, you're not high up enough.
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:07.920]  You're not high up enough.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.320]  And sure, I'm certain that there are people
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.620]  that are very powerful that also happen to be Freemasons
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:14.720]  that are involved in some questionable things,
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:16.820]  but the fraternity itself is a fraternity
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.220]  that is based off of freedom of speech,
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.820]  freedom of thought, freedom of religion.
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.220]  Our founders were Freemasons
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.220]  not because they were conspiring together
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.120]  to seize power, but because they were conspiring together
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.020]  to free man from all oppression and tyranny worldwide.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:33.520]  It's an anti-globalist fraternity.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.420]  It's the oldest fraternity in the world,
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.420]  and one, in my opinion, cannot claim to love America
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:41.120]  and simultaneously claim to disavow Freemasonry
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.620]  because without Freemasonry, this country would not exist.
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:44.220]  Stick with us, folks.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.420]  We'll be back after this break.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.720]  Make sure you visit infowarsstore.com
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.220]  and get something to support the network.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:57.220]  It's a faith-belief pursuit, the policy of truth.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.520]  Safe compounds are better for different people.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.020]  So one person might like this coffee,
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:26.520]  another person likes that coffee.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.920]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.220]  They're all very diverse,
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:30.620]  but we've been able to private label
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.420]  a national bestseller

[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.820]  God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.620]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil,
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:08.120]  full spectrum of CBD oil,

[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.420]  for your nervous system particularly.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.720]  Everybody knows it's incredible.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.520]  It works.

[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:27.420]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more

[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.820]  made right here in Central Texas.

[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.620]  Rebel Zen is a private label
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:41.120]  of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.420]  that's based right here in Texas

[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.720]  And here's what's even crazier,
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.720]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.820]  They're selling theirs for 30% off
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.020]  what their competitors are.
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.620]  So this is the highest rated,
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.020]  already at the lowest price,
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.320]  not even a lower price.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.920]  Rebel Zen, get yours at infowarsstore.com now.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.720]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.520]  Thought it was next week.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.420]  I come in this morning.
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:04.520]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.020]  Body's ultimate memory formula.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.720]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.720]  Overhead shot please.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.720]  Look how full this bottle is.

[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:29.520]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.920]  Some are maybe 10.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.620]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:37.420]  This is 95%.
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:38.420]  Super constant.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.420]  So like taking one pill
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:42.320]  is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.320]  It's that powerful.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:47.320]  Or more, so they're available at infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:51.020]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.

[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:03.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:06.820]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:23.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your host today, Chase. Guys are filling in for
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:28.580]  the great Alex Jones. And how prescient again that we're playing the music by Daft Punk
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:33.980]  for Tron because I watched Tron yesterday and it is such a good movie and the theme
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:38.099]  is so true as to everything that we're experiencing now with the development of artificial
[01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:43.120]  intelligence. Such a good movie. I recommend that you guys go back and watch that. I think
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.760]  it came out when I was in high school, 10, 15 years ago. I'm going to take more calls
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:53.360]  this segment. I want to hear from Carmen in Pennsylvania. Carmen, how are you? How
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.320]  are you doing, man? I'm good, man. How are you doing? I'm doing all right. I'm hanging
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:05.639]  in, surviving, barely. Me too. Yeah, yeah. Well, I just wanted to say, I just started
[01:21:05.639 --> 01:21:11.380]  listening to you guys maybe a month and a half ago. Started listening to Owen maybe
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:19.019]  two, three weeks ago. Awesome. Welcome to the family. Yeah, I'm glad to be here, guys.
[01:21:19.019 --> 01:21:25.620]  For real, for real. You guys, I knew something was going on. I knew something was going
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:36.880]  on. I couldn't put the dots together. I was living near San Antonio for a couple years
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.480]  and I just came back to Pennsylvania like a week and a half ago because I see what's
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.920]  going on. I know what's going on. There's something big that was going on and you
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:53.480]  guys really hit the nail on the head with it. With the globalists, the Democrats being
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:22:02.980]  involved with it, everything going on. I'm fired up about it. People are too stupid.
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:09.300]  They're either too stupid to see it or they're involved in it. Do you know what
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.300]  I mean?
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.760]  Yep, yep. Those who love the state either are the state or want to be the state. That's
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:21.420]  what Ayn Rand said. No doubt, no doubt. And the people with the power, as soon as
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:27.540]  they get a little drop of power, they go crazy. They don't want to lose it till they
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:33.080]  do anything to keep it. And that's even killing Americans. I believe...
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:36.760]  How did you find us the first time? What brought you to us?
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:43.000]  Well, I didn't have cable or nothing like that. So I had the internet and I just kept
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:54.019]  watching Newsmax. Screw Fox. Fox is CNN. They're like fake news. So I started watching
[01:22:54.019 --> 01:23:00.780]  Real America's Boys and Newsmax. And then I heard Alex Jones and I'm like, okay, let's
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:05.380]  Google Alex Jones. I go and import awards. I'm like, let's check this out. So I checked
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:10.380]  you guys out and I can't shut the TV off. You know what I mean?
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:14.840]  Hey, can I show you a clip from Newsmax and then you stay on with us and we'll talk about
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:20.000]  it? I want you guys to play clip number eight. This was when I was on Newsmax just
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  a couple of months ago.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.280]  I heard a rumor that there was, for example, classified documents stored in a shower at
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.160]  Mar-a-Lago. But the only president I'm aware of who's committed a crime in a shower is
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.960]  Joe Biden, if you read Ashley Biden's diary.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:42.740]  Well, again, not many people have seen that diary. Those who have have seen it give us
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:47.179]  their evaluation on that. What do you think of that, Carmen?
[01:23:47.179 --> 01:23:53.700]  Yeah, that's awesome. You gotta spread it though. You gotta spread it. Nobody knows.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:24:01.260]  And I don't have friends because with friends like these people around, who these enemies,
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:07.440]  they're all out to get you. But anyway, I figured, I was thinking back when Trump
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:15.880]  didn't, didn't lose that, you know, Obama released, released the virus so that they
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:22.360]  can suppress us so they can do what they needed to do to rig the elections, right?
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:29.320]  They killed millions of people. So they say the fear monger, everything going on.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:34.860]  I figured it out as soon as it happened, I knew. I knew it came out so they can rig
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:41.019]  the friggin election. But they killed millions of people around the world for power. That's
[01:24:41.019 --> 01:24:46.540]  just crazy. That is absolutely crazy. People need to stand up.
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:51.840]  They are so glad. They are so glad that the pandemic happened. The left is so grateful
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.920]  that millions of people all over the world died. And the pharmaceutical companies are
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:25:00.139]  so ecstatic that this happened. That's the real crime. That's the real travesty and
[01:25:00.139 --> 01:25:04.580]  tragedy of this is that it happened and they're grateful that it happened.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:14.740]  No doubt. And another note, the suppression of Owen, put him in jail. Yo, I'm a Marine
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:17.660]  Corps veteran. You know what I mean? Thanks for your service.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:28.960]  I'm a fricking patriot. And I sent on a live text saying, Owen, I'm unemployed. I don't
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:37.519]  make anything off my benefits. I'm almost homeless. You don't have to pay me nothing.
[01:25:37.519 --> 01:25:45.160]  I don't want no money. I will be your bodyguard. I will protect you for nothing.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:50.800]  Yeah. I feel the same way. When I started working here, I told him, I was like, if I
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.240]  could afford it, I'd pay to work here. I mean, that's how much I believe in it here.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.780]  And I appreciate your call, Carmen, and your support for Owen. For the listeners
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:02.360]  out there who feel the same way about Owen, make sure you visit DefendOwen.com and
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.200]  support him in any way that you can. This is a tough time for him. He's got the
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.660]  best attitude of anyone that I could imagine about it. He is inspired to fight even harder
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:13.760]  than ever before. And I know that in the next couple of hours, starting at six o'clock
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:20.360]  central here, you're going to be hearing more from the Owen side, the Owen perspective
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:24.639]  regarding everything that's going on. So make sure you stay tuned in for that.
[01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:28.000]  But anything you can do to support Owen, visit DefendOwen.com. Of course, visit
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.320]  DefendJones.com, as well as purchase anything you can from InfowarsStore.com.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:38.480]  Carmen, welcome to the family. Thank you so much for joining the Infowars Army.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.200]  Next up, I want to hear from Duncan in Connecticut. Duncan, how are you?
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:47.280]  Hey, I'm great, Chase. You're doing an awesome job today with the show. I like the point
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.719]  you made about capitalism being better for the poor and for the poverty-stricken and
[01:26:52.719 --> 01:26:57.639]  collectivism. Best evidence for that is just the rise of the West with the guidance
[01:26:57.639 --> 01:27:01.400]  of America leading the way and with the Industrial Revolution and everything we've
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:09.719]  built since then. We've destroyed poverty in this whole region until recently with
[01:27:09.719 --> 01:27:13.599]  the way everything's being destroyed. But as far as the last caller is concerned,
[01:27:13.599 --> 01:27:18.559]  that's great to hear. The awakening is one-directional. I've been following
[01:27:18.559 --> 01:27:24.920]  Alex since 2008, and back then we were all called crazy kook. And now half of
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:30.360]  what Alex says is the main points of the Republican Party. So the awakening is
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:35.840]  real, it's happening. The Great Awakening is unstoppable. Absolutely. The reason I'm
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:41.400]  calling is because of the Twitter files. We all learned about the various
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:46.120]  government connections and people involved with the FBI and state
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.880]  governments contacting Twitter and these various companies to have
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.800]  certain views suppressed, to have certain things promoted. But the thing that I
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.860]  haven't heard is anybody discussing the implications of that as far as it
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:07.300]  relates to the mainstream media in general. If this is happening with
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:11.860]  Twitter and these new social media organizations that have been around for
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:16.900]  what, slightly over a decade at this point, just imagine how riddled with
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:21.340]  government influence the mainstream media has been for decades at this
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:25.700]  point. I just haven't heard anybody discuss that at all and I'd like to
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:29.920]  know your thoughts on that. Yeah, so we're about ready to come up on a break in the
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.719]  next 27 seconds, but I will dive into that at the beginning of the next segment
[01:28:33.719 --> 01:28:36.519]  and respond to that. Thank you so much for that call, I do appreciate it. I think
[01:28:36.519 --> 01:28:39.559]  it's an outstanding point. In the meantime folks, make sure you visit
[01:28:39.559 --> 01:28:44.400]  infowarsstore.com and get any one of our products. My favorites include
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.760]  Brain Force Plus, which I take every day, and Turbo Force Plus, which I take as

[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.960]  Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy,
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.880]  you are crazy in my view if you don't get high-quality, storeable food
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:15.559]  and water filtration and self-defense. Now we're not selling guns
[01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:18.000]  and ammo, that's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to

[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.880]  got plenty of guns but they don't have enough storeable food or water
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.639]  filtration. This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food

[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.840]  obtained through diet. They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:15.719]  the ruling class is trying to ban it, and they can be found in fish, which
[01:30:15.719 --> 01:30:21.519]  are arguably the best source of Omega-3s. But the problem today is finding
[01:30:21.519 --> 01:30:27.080]  fish without a high mercury content. Your best option is our Ultimate Fish

[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:08.360]  Jones.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:23.480]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:29.360]  I am your host today, Chase Geyser, filling in for the great original gangster, irreplaceable
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.360]  Alex Jones himself.
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:31.799]  It is an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[01:33:31.799 --> 01:33:34.320]  I've been having a blast the last 90 minutes.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.480]  This has really just flown by.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.679]  Great caller at the end of the last segment brought up the point if, as we see from the
[01:33:41.679 --> 01:33:48.920]  Twitter files, the CIA, FBI, deep state is so intimately integrated in our social media
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:55.920]  platforms, then what does that say about our mainstream media platforms, which are
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.040]  much older, right?
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:02.299]  So we had the Red Scare right after World War II.
[01:34:02.299 --> 01:34:04.000]  There was this major anti-communist push.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  We were all afraid that communism was spreading everywhere.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.840]  We were used as an excuse to get in Vietnam and make a ton of money for our military industrial
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:12.719]  complex contractors.
[01:34:12.719 --> 01:34:17.639]  And during that time, there was a massive expansion of the deep state, right?
[01:34:17.639 --> 01:34:21.280]  Things like the CIA and the FBI became increasingly powerful.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:27.179]  We saw the same thing happen after the September 11th attacks in 2001, where those attacks
[01:34:27.179 --> 01:34:32.000]  were used as a pretext, as Alex Jones famously said and predicted multiple times in that
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  very year.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.240]  They were used as a pretext to empower the deep state to increase surveillance on Americans
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:43.780]  in such a way that everything you say, do, think, where you're located, who you vote
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:52.580]  for, what you buy, everything you do is recorded and traceable by the government.
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:35:01.759]  And if, as these Twitter files reveal, the CIA, FBI were able to get so intimately integrated
[01:35:01.759 --> 01:35:10.880]  in Twitter specifically, given that Twitter is only sort of a handful of years old compared
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:17.580]  to legacy outlets, what does that say about their control of the mainstream media, right?
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:23.360]  So if we had this Red Scare in the fifties, if we had this major expansion of our intelligence
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:31.740]  operatives back then, weren't they getting integrated in all of the major media outlets?
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:38.740]  Why is it that virtually every single major media outlet was fear-mongering about the
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:41.340]  Cold War?
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:44.059]  I often wonder if Russia even really wanted a Cold War.
[01:35:44.059 --> 01:35:48.820]  I often wonder if the only reason that Russia was growing its arsenal so much and expanding
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:52.139]  its power so much in terms of nuclear capabilities was because they were terrified that the
[01:35:52.139 --> 01:35:53.660]  United States was going to bond them.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:57.000]  After all, we were the only nation in the history of the world to ever actually
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.759]  use a nuclear weapon.
[01:35:58.759 --> 01:36:00.380]  So what's to say that we wouldn't use it again?
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:05.900]  There was more reason to be afraid of us than there was for us to be afraid of them, yet
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:10.940]  we have the entire mainstream media throughout the entirety of the Cold War, great movies
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:14.980]  like the Red Dawn come out, which are Cold War era movies, suggesting that there's
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:23.280]  this great communist threat of Russian nuclear proliferation, of Russian nuclear war.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.620]  And I wonder if there actually was.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:30.139]  I think perhaps the CIA, FBI, the deep state, the intelligence community was pushing that
[01:36:30.139 --> 01:36:36.980]  narrative through the select number of channels that we had access to as Americans to consume
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:45.019]  to heighten the fear within the American people to justify dramatic increases in military
[01:36:45.019 --> 01:36:52.700]  expenditures, which ultimately resulted in billions, if not trillions of dollars to
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.139]  be made for the military industrial complex.
[01:36:55.139 --> 01:37:02.420]  We know that the military industrial complex is not the only industrial complex that runs
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.780]  the show here, right?
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:09.940]  We famously cite the military industrial complex as the reason for all of our ails
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:13.679]  and overspending in America, but really it's more than that.
[01:37:13.679 --> 01:37:17.780]  It's the political industrial complex, and you can go through Hunter Biden's emails
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:21.259]  and you can see that there is a political industrial complex.
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:25.299]  And what I mean to say is it doesn't always have to be war.
[01:37:25.299 --> 01:37:28.540]  It can be through things like humanitarian aid, right?
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:34.900]  So when Haiti gets hit with a tsunami or an earthquake or whatever, there's an entire
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:39.740]  political industrial complex that makes millions upon millions of dollars off of sending things
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:42.139]  like fresh water to those vulnerable people.
[01:37:42.139 --> 01:37:45.980]  The reason that we help these nations out is twofold.
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:49.460]  There's one sort of questionably legitimate reason.
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:54.980]  One reason that we give aid is because down the line, if we need a country to do something
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:58.740]  for us, we can threaten to withhold that aid, right?
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:02.460]  So we make these countries dependent on us through the aid that we give.
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:05.900]  And then when we need them to do something, they will always do it for us because they're
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:07.540]  afraid of losing their aid.
[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:10.860]  The federal government has done the same thing with the states here in the United States,
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:15.780]  where each of the 50 states has become so dependent on funding from the federal
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:19.019]  government, whether it's infrastructure related funding, education related funding,
[01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:20.380]  energy related funding.
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:25.340]  It's so dependent on licensure and funding, universities the same way, from the federal
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:29.780]  government, that anytime the federal government makes a demand of the states or the universities,
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:33.780]  the states always comply because they don't want to lose the millions and millions of
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:35.380]  dollars that they're being given.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:40.620]  We have been bought and paid for and compromised by our own government in a way that has never
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:43.500]  existed before in the United States.
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:48.540]  Do you think that the Civil War would have even happened had the federal government been
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:51.500]  giving so much money to the states in the south prior to it?
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.740]  I wonder if it would have.
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:56.099]  I mean, that's the biggest reason that it wouldn't happen again would be just that the
[01:38:56.099 --> 01:38:59.660]  states are so financially dependent on the federal government, just like all these
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:01.179]  foreign countries are so dependent.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:06.059]  But to reel it back in, the point that I'm trying to make is that if the
[01:39:06.059 --> 01:39:10.420]  intelligence community was getting so involved and integrated in Twitter in the last 10
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:14.860]  years, then it was certainly integrated in our mainstream media outlets, especially in
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:17.820]  the context of the Cold War, the expansion of the intelligence community.
[01:39:18.299 --> 01:39:20.420]  And the Red Scare.
[01:39:21.219 --> 01:39:27.540]  So everything that you see leaked from Elon Musk at X regarding the deep states
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:38.219]  coercion and involvement of social media, all that is happening at Facebook, at
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:45.380]  Google, at probably Snapchat of all places, at TikTok, even though TikTok's a Chinese
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.900]  company, all this stuff is happening.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:57.219]  LinkedIn, Microsoft, Bing, all these companies, and of course, Fox, CNN, Newsmax
[01:39:57.219 --> 01:40:04.299]  even, everywhere that there is news being broadcast, there is a deep state
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:09.980]  trying to either compromise or destroy that network, right?
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:14.780]  So they were trying to compromise Twitter, and now they're trying to destroy it
[01:40:15.219 --> 01:40:16.540]  because it can't be compromised.
[01:40:17.179 --> 01:40:20.219]  Infowars can't be compromised, so they're trying to destroy it.
[01:40:20.299 --> 01:40:23.099]  They're doing everything they can to bring us off the air because they
[01:40:23.099 --> 01:40:25.740]  know that Infowars is not for sale.
[01:40:26.299 --> 01:40:33.460]  They can't come in and infiltrate and coerce and threaten or bully us into lying
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:38.179]  to you because the whole reason we do this in the first place is not for the
[01:40:38.179 --> 01:40:41.620]  money, it's because we're devoted to the truth.
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:45.259]  Sometimes you're just compelled to do something and it doesn't really
[01:40:45.259 --> 01:40:47.299]  make sense why you want to do it.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.219]  If you're an artist or you know an artist out there, sometimes you
[01:40:51.219 --> 01:40:54.139]  write a song even though you don't know whether or not anyone's
[01:40:54.139 --> 01:40:56.179]  going to listen to it because you're just compelled to write the
[01:40:56.179 --> 01:40:58.940]  song, or you paint a painting even though you don't know whether
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:01.099]  anyone's ever going to look at it because you're just compelled to
[01:41:01.099 --> 01:41:03.700]  paint the painting, or you write a book, or you write a poem, and
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.299]  that's the way Infowars is.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:11.099]  This whole network was founded on a compulsion to tell the truth and
[01:41:11.099 --> 01:41:14.620]  to unmask or unveil.
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:28.640]  The lies to reveal the truth, because you can only be lied to so much before the only thing that matters to you is the truth at any cost.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:34.640]  And now we've gotten to a point where we've got nothing to lose but the truth itself.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:38.640]  And so we're more committed, more devoted than ever before to telling you the truth.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.640]  I don't know if you've noticed, but if you've been watching Alex for over 10 years, the network has gotten more serious.
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:53.640]  Because the problems have gotten more serious and the end has gotten closer, we're coming up upon very serious times in this country.
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:58.640]  And things like me losing my best friend of 10 years over political differences is only the beginning.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:05.640]  These are the early signs of real division, real difficulty in this country.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:12.640]  Do you think if Donald Trump wins in 2024 that there isn't going to be violence and division?
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:19.640]  Do you think if Donald Trump loses in 2024 that there isn't going to be violence and division?
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:28.640]  This next year is going to be incredibly difficult, and the time after this election, regardless of the outcome of it, is going to be incredibly difficult.
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:41.640]  And that's why it's more important than ever that Infowars stay on the air, that Infowars is able to exercise its right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press to tell you the truth so that you can stay awake.
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.640]  Stick with us, folks. We'll be back after this break.

[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:06.640]  Omega three fatty acids are needed for optimal strength and they can only be obtained through diet.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:12.640]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:18.640]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega threes.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.640]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:30.640]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:46:57.620 --> 01:47:06.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:14.340]  Do you think that YouTube operates without the influence of the FBI or the CIA?
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:18.420]  With these Twitter file releases, we see that it's not actually private businesses doing
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:21.620]  it because they're all influenced by the FBI and the CIA.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:26.780]  When Twitter is technically a private company, but it's A, publicly traded, and B, meeting
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:31.420]  with the FBI and taking orders from the FBI on weekly meetings, monthly meetings,
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:35.540]  about who to censor, what to take down, then it's not even a private entity anymore.
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:40.180]  These businesses are actually extensions of the federal government.
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:41.180]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:42.180]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:45.620]  I'm Chase Geyser, filling in for the great Alex Jones himself.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:47.740]  I want to take a call from Tin Man in Texas.
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:49.580]  You got a turbo force plug, Tin Man?
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:50.580]  Turbo force?
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:59.020]  You know the turbo force, I just got this going for Hunter Biden next time, you know.
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:03.140]  If he just goes and snorts turbo force, he can still buy guns.
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:07.340]  I'm not addicted to cocaine, but I am addicted to turbo force.
[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:08.340]  Is that okay?
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:10.340]  Yeah, yeah, you can still have the gun, right?
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:11.340]  Yeah.
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:16.700]  Hey, I do want to put a little bit of input, too, on what you've been talking
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.700]  about.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:21.020]  I'm looking at X and all the social media and stuff.
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:23.300]  All it is is Mockingbird 2.0.
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:24.300]  What do you mean?
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:25.300]  I'm not familiar with Mockingbird, man.
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:26.900]  What's Project Mockingbird again?
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:31.020]  Well, Project Mockingbird, that was basically the red scare.
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:35.500]  They got the media, you know, they infiltrated the media with CIA.
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:36.500]  That's what they called it.
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:42.020]  Yeah, yeah, that was like Woodward, I think his name was Woodward.
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:47.580]  Basically he was a naval intelligence officer and all of a sudden he just wrote the best
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:49.580]  article about the JFK assassination.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:56.060]  It's been going on for a long time and I really think the social media right now,
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.620]  all it is is just Mockingbird 2.0.
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:48:58.620]  100%, man.
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:00.540]  Thanks for your call, Tin Man, appreciate it.
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:02.060]  Take care.
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:03.060]  Let's hear from Jessica in San Diego.
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:06.140]  Jessica, you got something about artificial intelligence you wanted to talk about?
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:07.140]  Hey, Jason.
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:10.140]  Hey, how are you?
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:19.980]  So you've talked about with some experts on AI and how far it's advanced and all
[01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:20.980]  of that.
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:27.580]  However, I've always gotten this really, really weird feeling with the vacuums and
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:33.820]  the refrigerators and the Alexa's that no one is honest with their internet churches
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:35.940]  or they try to hide it.
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:41.940]  However, with all of that, they hear all of the arguments, the lovemaking, the plotting,
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:49.860]  the scheming, and that's where AI can zero in on the honesty of people and that it
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:54.820]  gives me such a creepy feeling that that's what they're listening to more so than
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:58.540]  the algorithms and the normal stuff.
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:49:59.540]  Yeah.
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:02.740]  So you bring up a great point and I think you're absolutely right.
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:03.980]  There's a couple of things I think about that.
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:08.940]  The first thing is in order for things like a Google Home or an Alexa to work,
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:13.720]  it has to be constantly recording you because in order to respond to you when you say
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:18.580]  things like, hey Siri or hey Alexa, it's always got to have the microphone on picking
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:22.500]  up and looking for those keywords so that it can respond to your prompts.
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:27.060]  So it's undoubtedly true that these devices are always recording you.
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:31.660]  Now traditionally, these platforms, these companies have said that they're not monitoring
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:34.800]  these recordings and they're not keeping them for a long period of time or they're
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:37.420]  only a few seconds at a time and it's come out.
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:39.140]  I think there have been data breaches.
[01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:42.260]  It's been a minute since this has broken in the news, but I believe Amazon had one
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:47.940]  fairly recently like within the last couple of years where they had tons of recordings
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:52.340]  from the Amazon Alexa's and I think you could even go and look up in your Amazon Alexa
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:56.340]  account the recordings that they have if you do a data download, but I could be wrong
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:57.340]  about that.
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:01.980]  But that being said, this information is being recorded and traditionally, there's
[01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:08.500]  so much data, so much being recorded that there's been no way for anybody to actively
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.740]  monitor these recordings, right?
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:15.620]  So they would have a human being monitor recordings perhaps if certain keywords were
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:22.260]  triggered or if you were a person who was on a list as a potential threat, then they
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:24.620]  may actively monitor these recordings.
[01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:29.860]  However, we're getting to a point with the advancement of quantum computing and artificial
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:36.500]  intelligence that we won't need or not we, I should say they won't need human beings
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:43.500]  actively monitoring the recordings that are being made by the smart devices in your home,
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:47.540]  whether it's your refrigerator, whether it's your television, whether it's your car,
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:52.580]  whether it's your phone, because the artificial intelligence can not only monitor it and
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:56.800]  scan for keywords, but now it's gotten to a point where it can actually monitor
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:02.260]  it and interpret it and understand the meaning of what you're saying, what you're doing.
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:06.020]  So the artificial intelligence is like, oh, this person's talking about X, Y, Z, they're
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:09.300]  making a spaghetti dinner right now and they're frustrated because the instructions on the
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:12.740]  YouTube video that they're watching aren't clear enough because they skip a step.
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:14.140]  The AI knows that now.
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:17.620]  It's not just hearing each individual word that you're saying or each individual sort
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:19.100]  of like two or three word phrase.
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:23.100]  It understands and can convey what's going on.
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:26.420]  So you could feasibly on the other end of this artificial intelligence, go in and
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:30.340]  say, make a list of recordings of someone who may be plotting to commit a murder.
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:33.360]  And it could come up and say, oh, here are all the recordings of people that may
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:36.340]  be plotting to commit a murder based off of the devices.
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:40.520]  And then they can come proactively, sort of like minority report, arrest you because
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.520]  of that.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:46.940]  And as long as the government is super just and moral, then maybe these tools could be
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:48.160]  used for good.
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:51.300]  But we know that every single genocide that's ever happened in the history of the world
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:57.400]  has been at the hands of a government or a formal authority of some sort and that these
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:03.960]  powers are always ultimately at one time or another, at one point or another, used to
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:05.440]  an evil end.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:09.320]  So when you know about this artificial intelligence and when you know about all these platforms
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:11.920]  and that they're constantly recording what you're doing, what your face looks like, what
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:15.240]  your search history is, what you're saying.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:19.620]  And we know that we see the Biden administration on television talking about how the greatest
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:26.120]  threat to national security is white supremacy or domestic terrorism.
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:29.540]  And we have the intelligence community coming out with a list of signs that someone is
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:31.640]  a radical, dangerous extremist.
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:36.380]  And those signs are things like the don't tread on me, Gadsden flag.
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:40.940]  And if you marry all these factors together, then you realize, oh my God, they're going
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:46.460]  to use all this technology to A, label me as an extremist or domestic terrorist so
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:52.220]  I don't have any rights, and then B, persecute me for my political beliefs.
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:55.520]  If you think what's happening to Alex Jones is bad or if you think what's happening
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:00.320]  to Owen Schroyer is bad or what's happening to Russell Brand is bad, just wait till you
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:02.720]  see what they do to your neighbor.
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:05.400]  Because they start with the influencers, to set an example.
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:09.560]  They start with the people that are swing heavy, that got a real strong punch, right?
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.240]  They get real frustrated when Alex says something more than when your neighbor says
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:14.800]  something because Alex has millions upon millions of listeners.
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.360]  So they're going to go after him first, but it's not going to stop there, folks.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:21.920]  When Trump said it's not me thereafter, it's you, I'm just in the way.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:26.480]  That was perhaps the most true political statement, political slogan in the history
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:29.360]  of political slogans in the United States of America.
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.240]  And they are coming after you.
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:35.280]  And that's why it's more important than ever to fight back and to speak out because
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:40.200]  those who stand by quietly and allow this to happen are complicit.
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:41.800]  I know the left says silence is violence.
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:46.560]  I'm not saying that you're evil because you're quiet, but I'm saying that cowardice
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:49.840]  is exploited, so don't be a coward.
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.300]  I know you're afraid of losing your job or losing your friends if you post too much
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:55.440]  on social media about what your political beliefs are.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:56.440]  I've lost my friends.
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:58.960]  I've lost clients over what my political beliefs are.
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:06.320]  But I'm telling you right now, the danger of not saying anything, the danger of not
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:11.920]  doing anything is so much greater than the danger or the risks of speaking out now.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:17.440]  Because these tools are coming in place, the stars are aligning, and the government
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:23.520]  is positioning itself for total control over thought, total control over speech, total
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:28.280]  control over action, and total control over property.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:33.120]  And if we don't fight back now, it's going to be too late.
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:35.320]  But it's not too late yet.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:38.800]  There are still people fighting.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.160]  There are still voices speaking.
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.020]  Whether it's the James O'Keeffe's.
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:48.480]  Whether it's this Christine Anderson, the German MEP.
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:49.480]  Whether it's Alex Jones.
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:50.480]  Whether it's Owen Schroyer.
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:51.860]  Whether it's Joe Rogan.
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:54.300]  There are still people that are speaking out.
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:59.500]  There are still people that are waging this war for freedom, but you can't just rely on
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:03.320]  people with 150,000 followers to win this.
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:04.580]  It's got to be you.
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:05.580]  You got to repost.
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:06.580]  You got to share the show.
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:07.580]  You got to share the links.
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:08.580]  You got to share it with friends.
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:10.260]  You got to say what you actually think.
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:11.740]  Do it respectfully.
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:13.200]  Do it coherently.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:19.880]  Do it in a way that is credible and reputable and honorable, but share if you care.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:21.660]  Send people to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:23.080]  Send people to Infowars.com.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.320]  That's the best place to get the news.
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:29.400]  I was talking to my dad the other day, and I was like, hey, I'm more well informed now
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.900]  since I started working at Infowars than I've ever been, and my dad's a right-wing
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:35.720]  guy and Infowars supporter, and he says, yeah, but you're only seeing one side of
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:36.720]  the story.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:37.720]  I'm like, no.
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:41.520]  At Infowars, we don't only see one side of the story because we cover what everybody
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:43.340]  else is saying.
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:48.200]  If you work at Infowars, you see the CNN article and the response to the CNN article.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:49.240]  You see what Fox is saying.
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:50.500]  You see what Newsmax is saying.
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:52.280]  You see what MSNBC is saying.
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:54.500]  You see what NBC is saying.
[01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:58.080]  Every single network you can imagine, we see it, we read it, and we respond to it.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.280]  We follow the narrative because it is the medium through which the enemy speaks to
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.900]  us and tries to manipulate us and tries to overpower us.
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:10.080]  If you're listening to Infowars, you are not only getting one side of the story.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.040]  You're being presented with the narrative, and then you're presented with a counterargument.
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:16.640]  That's not one side of the story, but if you watch CNN, you're certainly getting
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:17.640]  one side of the story.
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:19.660]  You're getting the state side of the story.
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:21.620]  They're not covering what Infowars says.
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:27.640]  They're just covering what false allegations are being waged against Infowars.
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:30.360]  If you follow Fox, they're not following what Tucker says.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:31.820]  They're just firing them, right?
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:35.740]  So Infowars is by far and away the best place to get your news, get your truth.
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:36.740]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:39.820]  We will be back after this segment with the next two hours of the show.

[01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:50.490]  Bodies is back!

[01:58:03.450 --> 01:58:07.550]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry
[01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:11.610]  and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[01:58:11.610 --> 01:58:16.370]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility,

[01:58:33.190 --> 01:58:34.190]  in turmeric.
