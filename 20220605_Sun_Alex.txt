[00:00.000 --> 00:29.800]  Well, we made it another day, thank God, here on the spaceship Earth that we all live on
[00:29.800 --> 00:40.720]  hurtling through space, orbiting the Sun. I'm sitting here, getting ready for the broadcast
[00:40.720 --> 00:46.040]  the last few hours, trying to think of what headline do I put out to accurately describe
[00:46.040 --> 00:57.200]  just how serious the situation is on this planet today. And none of us really can process the
[00:57.200 --> 01:01.040]  danger we're all in, because humans have never, at least in recorded history that we
[01:01.040 --> 01:06.760]  know of, faced anything like we're dealing with right now. We have a proxy war between
[01:06.760 --> 01:13.160]  NATO and Russia that the United States on record is commanding and running in Ukraine,
[01:13.160 --> 01:18.600]  and as it becomes clear that Russia is winning that war to take over the east of Ukraine
[01:18.600 --> 01:27.560]  and 90% of their industrial and energy capacity, the west is escalating and sending in heavier
[01:27.560 --> 01:34.800]  and heavier weapons, including long-range missiles. And Putin said on Friday that if
[01:34.800 --> 01:40.960]  that continued, they would start targeting western cities, including the possible use
[01:40.960 --> 01:49.200]  of nuclear weapons. And then the next day, a bunch of cruise missiles hit Kiev, blowing
[01:49.200 --> 01:54.520]  up arms depots. That's a pretty big deal. And that's back of the newspaper, because
[01:54.520 --> 02:02.360]  they've already moved on to the Evaldi shooting. They moved from COVID to Ukraine to Monkey
[02:02.360 --> 02:10.000]  Pox to Evaldi. And it's all a distraction from the ongoing design economic collapse
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.160]  of the western world by design. But we'll be going over all of this today. Russian military
[02:15.160 --> 02:21.560]  strikes Kiev, Putin issues warning to the west MSM, AP, Russia hits Kiev with missiles,
[02:21.560 --> 02:28.240]  Putin warns west on arms. Russia targets western supplied tank depot in Kiev in a rare
[02:28.240 --> 02:34.120]  cruise missile attack. Russia threatens direct attacks on western cities for providing long
[02:34.120 --> 02:40.920]  range missiles to Ukraine. Putin officially says it can even be nuclear war. This is a
[02:40.920 --> 02:50.960]  very serious situation. Zelensky now admits they're losing the war. But the globalists
[02:50.960 --> 02:57.160]  just want to have an ongoing prolonged operation where they can launder hundreds of billions
[02:57.160 --> 03:03.520]  of dollars. It's over $100 billion since February that the west, over $60 billion from the US
[03:03.520 --> 03:09.760]  of it, other $40 billion from other states, has been pumped into that war zone. And even
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.640]  the Pope had to admit three weeks ago, I'm no fan of the globalist Pope, that okay,
[03:14.640 --> 03:19.200]  NATO overthrew the elected president Ukraine eight years ago. And they've been pushing
[03:19.200 --> 03:24.640]  out Russians into the east when the Russians are from Ukraine, where Russia started. And
[03:24.640 --> 03:30.920]  you need to stop. Even Henry Kissinger came out last week and says, okay, we need to make
[03:30.920 --> 03:38.680]  a peace deal that seems to stop now. But the neocons and others, they want a big war. So
[03:38.680 --> 03:44.960]  if you thought World War Two was bad, killing over 100 million people, 20 something million
[03:44.960 --> 03:49.920]  Russians, 20 something million Germans, the lion's share, well, you ain't seen nothing
[03:49.920 --> 03:55.320]  yet. And we are sleepwalking into this. You know, they just had World War One relatively
[03:55.320 --> 04:02.720]  soon, shortly before World War Two, in which tens of millions died. And they still had
[04:02.720 --> 04:08.720]  that giant war. World War One was supposedly the war to end all wars. So you had a population
[04:08.720 --> 04:14.320]  aware of how bad war is, it still happened. Imagine now where we've got people that just
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.640]  watch Netflix all day and believe that men can have babies and all the rest of this while
[04:19.640 --> 04:26.880]  we are sleepwalking into Armageddon. That's just one of the stacks we've got. All hell
[04:26.880 --> 04:32.000]  broke loose in Dallas yesterday. Alex Stein's going to be joining us and others. They had
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.920]  a grooming, a Pito drag queen storytime celebration, where they had little kids like trophies at
[04:38.920 --> 04:45.480]  an adult stripper gay bar. And some patriots showed up and all hell broke loose that ties
[04:45.480 --> 04:51.840]  into Satanism, demystified and the heart of the problem when we come back. And then of
[04:51.840 --> 04:57.600]  course, other big reports here, US Social Security and Medicare approach and solvency
[04:57.600 --> 05:23.320]  warn the trusty boards.

[06:08.560 --> 06:20.360]  Thanks Alex Jones. Make no mistake, my friends, we are living in an incredibly historic time.
[06:20.360 --> 06:25.320]  The true crossroads in the future of humanity will put that headline back on screen for
[06:25.320 --> 06:34.400]  TV viewers. I'll read it out for radio listeners because it says it all. Emergency Sunday broadcast
[06:34.400 --> 06:42.520]  Putin officially threatens to nuke western cities if NATO continues escalation in Ukraine.
[06:42.520 --> 06:50.680]  Wow. We'll be covering that at the bottom of the hour in about 25 minutes from now. We've
[06:50.680 --> 06:55.560]  got the Debo script announcing world government and what is going to be in that world government
[06:55.560 --> 07:00.920]  and they've released 10 statements about the world you live in. You couldn't make up something
[07:00.920 --> 07:06.920]  more dystopic and not marriage. That's coming up next segment as the Bilderberg group on
[07:06.920 --> 07:14.240]  hiatus for two years that's the secret group that founded Debo's meets in DC at the Grand
[07:14.240 --> 07:20.360]  Orient Hotel. We've got a lot of exclusive intel and information on that as we identify
[07:20.360 --> 07:31.960]  who is orchestrating this worldwide crisis. And then on the economic front, the trustees
[07:31.960 --> 07:38.680]  of Social Security and Medicare, two different boards have come out last week, got no coverage
[07:38.680 --> 07:44.040]  except in the epic times, epoch times, and said that US Social Security Medicare are
[07:44.040 --> 07:52.000]  approaching insolvency warns trustees. That means going bankrupt to put with the inflation.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.080]  Believe me, it's already done. Ultra massive information. And then you have the head of
[07:58.080 --> 08:03.960]  the Commerce Department asked on national television on the Sunday news show, what are
[08:03.960 --> 08:09.200]  you going to do about 79% of the baby formula being totally sold out across the country
[08:09.200 --> 08:18.200]  as high as 90% in some areas. And she didn't respond to that. And just sidestep the question.
[08:18.200 --> 08:24.640]  I mean, it is unbelievable to be living in this. And I'm here to tell you, I'd be a liar
[08:24.640 --> 08:30.240]  if I told you that the things were about to get better, they're going to get a lot worse.
[08:30.240 --> 08:35.560]  At least we know it's coming. You know, the last car wreck I was in, thank God I hadn't
[08:35.560 --> 08:45.000]  been in one a long time was 12 years ago. I was driving back, visiting family in Fredericksburg,
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.200]  Texas, where my uncle and aunt lived and then moved to East Texas. And there were a bunch
[08:51.200 --> 08:59.680]  of storms forming in between Austin and Fredericksburg. And I remember my great, it wasn't my great
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.480]  grandmother, but my great wonderful grandmother saying, you know, I want to get the car and
[09:04.480 --> 09:10.480]  I want to go. I got a feeling the storms can be bad. You need to leave too. We waited an
[09:10.480 --> 09:17.640]  hour longer and drank coffee and shot guns after my grandmother and my now ex-wife and
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.600]  my three children got in their car and left back to Austin. We drank some more coffee
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.600]  and shot some more guns off the porch because he lit up on this big hilltop. You can shoot
[09:28.600 --> 09:35.960]  1,000 yards down at targets we had. And I'm driving down the highway and I hit Johnson
[09:35.960 --> 09:43.040]  City where LBJ is from. I'm driving 50 because it's raining so hard and there's wind blowing
[09:43.040 --> 09:50.680]  and my Tahoe gets thrown off the road where there's 60, 70 foot embankments going down.
[09:50.680 --> 09:58.520]  And it started spinning and then ran into a bunch of oak trees. But thank God, it was
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.640]  me and my dad in the car, it hit the back of us and crushed the whole vehicle more than
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.400]  half the Tahoe in to where we were. My dad got a concussion. I was okay. You know, the
[10:09.400 --> 10:13.960]  steering wheel broke and our seats broke. It hit us so hard. And the reason I tell that
[10:13.960 --> 10:23.440]  story is when we start spinning on the road from the storm and the most important part
[10:23.440 --> 10:29.160]  of the story is coming in a moment, it felt like a lifetime. And then as we shot down
[10:29.160 --> 10:36.640]  over the embankment backwards, down a 60, 70 foot gully through a fence into a bunch
[10:36.640 --> 10:43.920]  of oak trees, I remember looking at my dad and saying brace for impact. And that's the
[10:43.920 --> 10:52.560]  moment we're in right now. But what engineered? What was the storm that brought us this place?
[10:52.560 --> 10:56.720]  The new world order, the great reset, the big central banks getting ready to pop their
[10:56.720 --> 11:02.320]  world financial bubble and pose as saviors instead of the authors of our problems and
[11:02.320 --> 11:07.440]  totally take over the planet with the new world market, the beast, casual society that's
[11:07.440 --> 11:12.760]  now beneficially announced. So the way tornadoes work, if you haven't lived in tornado alley
[11:12.760 --> 11:21.080]  like goes down from Illinois right down to central Texas kind of ends at Austin, is
[11:21.080 --> 11:26.120]  sky will be blue, then it's black, then it's green. And should have known it was a tornado
[11:26.120 --> 11:30.720]  because the sky was green. When we're just driving 45 miles an hour down the highway,
[11:30.720 --> 11:35.960]  it's raining high wind, the tornado hit when the state police got there like in 10 minutes.
[11:35.960 --> 11:40.000]  They said you're looking to be alive. We just were parked down the road and watched it destroy
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.580]  that barn across the street and you were hit by the tornado and we watched the tornado throw
[11:45.580 --> 11:50.080]  you off the road. See I thought the car was spinning because I was like this is weird,
[11:50.080 --> 11:56.920]  the car's spinning down the highway. It's spinning six, seven, eight times. Like in
[11:56.920 --> 12:01.080]  Wizard of Oz when Dorothy's in the house and you know, it's picked up. I'm like why is
[12:01.080 --> 12:10.680]  this car just spinning down the road and then because a tornado, we were in a tornado, taking
[12:10.680 --> 12:18.080]  us down the road and then spit us out shooting us down a hill. That was a miracle we lived.
[12:18.080 --> 12:23.360]  But my point is that was nature, that was the earth, that was the world and God gave
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.120]  us the good sense that we should have left right away or we should have stayed. My grandmother
[12:27.120 --> 12:33.920]  said we're leaving those storms are dangerous. See these aren't acts of nature, acts of God,
[12:33.920 --> 12:39.080]  the globalist of the tornado. And if we don't recognize that they're the storm and they're
[12:39.080 --> 12:47.680]  the tornado and they're the bad guys and they're the people causing all of this, we're done.
[12:47.680 --> 12:50.920]  But I didn't know until the tornado went by and the state police were going, we were parked
[12:50.920 --> 12:58.440]  down the road and saw it happen. We never see anything like it. Their mouths were hanging
[12:58.440 --> 13:05.120]  open because they'd never seen a car grab by a tornado. I was in it, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:05.120 --> 13:12.200]  Talk about a weird world, talk about a weird life, but I'm done talking about all that.
[13:12.200 --> 13:17.240]  The point is, is that the viruses and the open borders and the collapsing currencies
[13:17.240 --> 13:24.480]  and all the open pedophilia and the shortages and all of this is because the New World Order
[13:24.480 --> 13:29.160]  doubled and tripled and quadrupled its profits the last 30 months of this and they're running
[13:29.160 --> 13:35.000]  the whole show and they are consolidating power and control and they are orchestrating
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.440]  and triggering every bit of these crises. But the issue is they're in the storm too
[13:41.440 --> 13:49.680]  and these crises have already gotten out of control. So when we come back, I want to look
[13:49.680 --> 13:55.600]  at the root causes of all this and let me tell you, we have a lot of fabulous researchers
[13:55.600 --> 14:01.360]  and reporters here like Christy Lee and Owen Schreuer and so many others. They all do great
[14:01.360 --> 14:09.600]  jobs but Greg Rees who's worked here now five years just does better and better and better
[14:09.600 --> 14:14.160]  all the time. And I asked him six months ago, I said, I want a report on the origins of
[14:14.160 --> 14:22.360]  Satanism and how it is conquest versus renaissance. And I usually have asked him to report, he
[14:22.360 --> 14:28.120]  doesn't, he never did it. He called me yesterday and he said, I've done it. Watch this, Satanism
[14:28.120 --> 14:33.760]  demystified. And he's done so many reports and I'm always saying, man, this is his best
[14:33.760 --> 14:42.320]  report because they just keep getting better and better. But this one is so key and it's
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.560]  just like Prager U has four or five minute videos that tell you so much. He's kind of
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.960]  our Prager U because they're short, they're sweet, they're true, they're powerful. If
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.880]  you understand what's happened to the world, it's becoming satanic. It's always had problems.
[14:56.880 --> 15:02.920]  We've always been falling. But everything the New World Order does is predatory and
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.000]  it's there to hurt you by design because they think that's a good thing. So that's coming
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.120]  up next segment. I'm going to tie it into everything that is unfolding with the economy
[15:13.120 --> 15:17.720]  and Russia threatening nuclear war again. Now, people are just getting punch-drunked
[15:17.720 --> 15:23.680]  to that. And we've got special guest on Alex Stein was up in Dallas where they had a grooming
[15:23.680 --> 15:34.720]  pito event, pito grooming, drag queen, children dancing at a homosexual strip club. All of
[15:34.720 --> 15:41.040]  this is coming up on the other side of this special Sunday, June 5th, 2022 broadcast. I'm
[15:41.040 --> 15:46.000]  so honored to be here. So thankful to all the listeners and viewers and affiliates and crew.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.320]  We have been through so much together, but we're stronger than ever. And that is just
[15:49.320 --> 15:53.560]  to answer prayer. So thank you all for your prayer. Thank you all for your support. Everybody
[15:53.560 --> 16:01.960]  tune in now this is critical information coming up. I don't care if you work in a cafeteria
[16:01.960 --> 16:06.360]  or pump gas or whether you're a farmer or rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire,
[16:06.360 --> 16:11.200]  fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.200]  tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers. And almost
[16:16.200 --> 16:21.640]  all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups because
[16:21.640 --> 16:25.200]  they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this
[16:25.200 --> 16:29.760]  and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things
[16:29.760 --> 16:35.960]  out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful
[16:35.960 --> 16:39.680]  that allows you to keep more money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax
[16:39.680 --> 16:47.880]  advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com.
[16:47.880 --> 16:54.880]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[16:54.880 --> 17:09.440]  If I had to describe with just one word the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[17:09.440 --> 17:16.160]  prince that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[17:16.160 --> 17:21.960]  lost. Just like you're lost to sleep, you're lost in a bad nightmare, you're in a car
[17:21.960 --> 17:29.480]  where you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy
[17:29.480 --> 17:34.240]  and confused, you have a concussion. And that's what the globalists have done, they have stunned
[17:34.240 --> 17:39.400]  us. They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab
[17:39.400 --> 17:43.320]  recently came out and gave him a speech he called The Great New Narrative where he brags
[17:43.320 --> 17:48.240]  how the public is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the
[17:48.240 --> 17:52.640]  people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff. That's
[17:52.640 --> 17:59.960]  what the Great Reset is. They need darkness to thrive. The light lives at infowars.com.
[17:59.960 --> 18:05.720]  You see this? It's an info wars republic defense card with original info wars art designed

[18:11.640 --> 18:16.720]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence and they'll never be made again. The bank
[18:16.720 --> 18:20.720]  that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years just sold out
[18:20.720 --> 18:26.720]  of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[18:26.720 --> 18:31.200]  And when you get three or more you can get these at 50% off and they fund the info war.

[19:51.040 --> 19:58.040]  Thanks for watching this video.
[20:21.040 --> 20:28.040]  Thanks for watching this video.
[20:51.040 --> 21:01.300]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us. I want to go to the very nature of why these people
[21:01.300 --> 21:05.080]  are so evil and why they think hurting and killing people is a sign of their power and
[21:05.080 --> 21:10.480]  something they feel compelled to do. So before I play this very important report that's on
[21:10.480 --> 21:16.440]  infowars.com and band.video, Satanism demystified. Couldn't be a more important four and a half
[21:16.440 --> 21:20.400]  minutes to watch. We're going to premiere here in a moment. Let me show you some of
[21:20.400 --> 21:27.800]  the background here. It is the Fortune 1000. It is the Fortune 500. It is the most powerful
[21:27.800 --> 21:34.640]  people and universities and think tanks and banks that are pushing transgenderism because
[21:34.640 --> 21:42.120]  I have a clip next segment of Fox News telling you about human animal clones being made
[21:42.120 --> 21:48.760]  and how last year they wouldn't even pass a law to block it. If you'll accept that a
[21:48.760 --> 21:53.600]  man can have a baby, if you'll accept five year olds being taught how to give blowjobs
[21:53.600 --> 21:58.160]  and being taken to gay bars to dance in front of people, you'll accept anything and that's
[21:58.160 --> 22:02.880]  what's happening. We're being trained right now. European Union Commission declares the
[22:02.880 --> 22:11.280]  future is queered in their youth children's Twitter account targeted to schools and children.
[22:11.280 --> 22:15.280]  Well that means there's no future because if you don't have children you die and that's
[22:15.280 --> 22:19.560]  the target. So they go oh be open minded, don't be mean to people that like the same
[22:19.560 --> 22:24.080]  sex you're like okay I don't hate you. Okay well your kids belong to me. Well that's not
[22:24.080 --> 22:31.200]  being homosexual, that's being a pedophile or being a groomer for these people. Big report
[22:31.200 --> 22:36.720]  on infowars.com from Breitbart. Biden threatens to take away school lunch money that doesn't
[22:36.720 --> 22:40.600]  adhere to trans agenda. They can feed your kids and control that. Well they can tell
[22:40.600 --> 22:46.000]  them what they're going to hear at age five again to confuse their gender which is by
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.240]  design. Pizza Hut goes full look recommending drag queen books inside the pizza boxes ads
[22:52.240 --> 22:57.160]  for drag queen books as kids as young as five. It's not drag queen, it's teaching your child
[22:57.160 --> 23:05.040]  to have sex with the same sex. Shouldn't be going on period heterosexual or homosexual.
[23:05.040 --> 23:11.400]  And it goes on and on and on from there. As Pride Month kicks off it's time to give straight
[23:11.400 --> 23:15.520]  folks their parade too. Straight folks have their parade, it's called their children and
[23:15.520 --> 23:20.880]  grandparents and communities. Not a bunch of men dressed up like clowns calling themselves
[23:20.880 --> 23:26.600]  women demanding access to everybody's children. This is the vanguard of clowns to condition
[23:26.600 --> 23:33.320]  you to accept anything and everything ladies and gentlemen. Creepy men masquerading as
[23:33.320 --> 23:40.480]  women. Child exploitation exposes groomer drag queen kick off Pride Month. We've got
[23:40.480 --> 23:44.400]  all the footage coming up at the end of the hour next hour. And look at this photo of
[23:44.400 --> 23:50.400]  your TV viewer. Transcyclists finish first and second in the UK. Kiss on the podium next
[23:50.400 --> 23:56.760]  to third place mom holding her baby. And the full photos on info wars dot com. Where they're
[23:56.760 --> 24:02.160]  just towering about this woman that they barely be. These men couldn't compete against men
[24:02.160 --> 24:07.360]  soon the entire sport will be men masquerading as women for the cash prizes. It's called
[24:07.360 --> 24:15.040]  bullying, it's called fraud, it's called disgust. And then of course they do a sexual act in
[24:15.040 --> 24:20.240]  front of everyone. It's a sex cult dominating you. Usually somebody comes up and starts
[24:20.240 --> 24:24.600]  talking about sex to you at the park or at the grocery store. You call them a pervert.
[24:24.600 --> 24:35.840]  Oh, they're wrapped in the rainbow flag. Majority say allowing preferred pronouns in schools
[24:35.840 --> 24:41.480]  confuses kids. National poll shows only 37% agree with it. That's 37% of people under
[24:41.480 --> 24:45.640]  Stockholm syndrome targeting children who are supposed to be thinking about sex to totally
[24:45.640 --> 24:50.480]  confuse them and have the state form a relationship with them about their identity that supersedes
[24:50.480 --> 24:55.360]  parental control. That's what it's about. Viral comedian assaulted while exposing drag
[24:55.360 --> 25:01.760]  queen grooming of children. That's coming up Alex Stein. Next hour. Bill Maher comes
[25:01.760 --> 25:06.440]  out again this week and says we're losing civilization because of woke policies, homelessness
[25:06.440 --> 25:12.120]  and drugs. And he goes on to say leave children alone. Do not sexualize them. He's finally
[25:12.120 --> 25:20.200]  got a line. He won't pass. Where is your line? And I went too far. I went too long in the
[25:20.200 --> 25:27.080]  segment to get to the report. I'll keep going with this. We'll come back and play the Satanism
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.760]  demystified report and then get into Bilderberg of the New World Order and the rest of it.
[25:31.760 --> 25:36.360]  Let's push Stein back to the start of the next hour. I had him on at 445 Central. We're
[25:36.360 --> 25:41.120]  live right now. There will be archive. But let's just start clean with him. Second hour.
[25:41.120 --> 25:45.080]  Five time to hit Bilderberg and the globalist and everything that ties into who's controlling
[25:45.080 --> 25:49.160]  this who's doing this in the final segment of this hour. But next segment I'll get into
[25:49.160 --> 25:54.280]  this key report. Satanism demystified. But I'll give you some background. House Republicans
[25:54.280 --> 26:01.080]  unveiled restoring the American family agenda to combat lefts culture war on and low birth
[26:01.080 --> 26:06.760]  rates, which is what it's all about. Not having children. Meanwhile, Amazon as you know last
[26:06.760 --> 26:12.440]  week had a big die in at their headquarters because Amazon won't ban books criticizing
[26:12.440 --> 26:20.440]  sterilizing six and seven year olds the transgender movement. Demanding access to your children,
[26:20.440 --> 26:26.840]  ladies and gentlemen, it doesn't get more evil. It doesn't get more sick destroying the innocence
[26:26.840 --> 26:31.280]  to that. And we've got that all coming up. But I want to hit the Satanism demystified
[26:31.280 --> 26:37.880]  and then tie it in. To the top 10 creepiest and most dystopian things pushed by the World
[26:37.880 --> 26:43.920]  Economic Forum and the latest exclusive information on Bilderberg Group 2022. The secret group

[29:59.000 --> 30:04.640]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791. The first
[30:04.640 --> 30:10.040]  of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press. Free speech means the
[30:10.040 --> 30:16.880]  free and public expression of opinions without censorship interference and restraint by the
[30:16.880 --> 30:24.680]  government. 231 years later free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.
[30:24.680 --> 30:30.520]  GCN is under attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you
[30:30.520 --> 30:36.960]  to know the truth. I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our

[33:01.120 --> 33:22.600]  Bringing a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. From
[33:22.600 --> 33:32.760]  the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. There are many preconceived notions
[33:32.760 --> 33:39.160]  about what defines Satanism. Some people will say that Satanists are just playing dress
[33:39.160 --> 33:45.840]  up. Some say they sacrifice children and others believe they have magical powers. But the
[33:45.840 --> 33:52.560]  truth is much more simple. Most people will agree that Satanism is the antithesis of Christianity.
[33:52.560 --> 33:59.840]  So first we must define what Christianity is. In a sentence, Christianity is the impulse
[33:59.840 --> 34:07.280]  to express brotherly love towards our fellow man. Satanism does not have that impulse at
[34:07.280 --> 34:14.040]  all. In the most simple terms, Satanism can be described with the pop culture phrase pimps
[34:14.040 --> 34:21.560]  and hoes. If these words upset you, good. We are talking about the nature of evil. And
[34:21.560 --> 34:27.480]  if it makes light of it, even better. These animals are nothing to fear. While the rich
[34:27.480 --> 34:32.560]  and powerful Satanists want you to believe they are witches and warlocks, they are nothing
[34:32.560 --> 34:39.920]  more than pimps and hoes, cannibals, feeding off other people like predatory animals. Completely
[34:39.920 --> 34:46.880]  devoid of the impulse for brotherly love, Satanism is base level animal tribalism. An
[34:46.880 --> 34:53.600]  animal hierarchy comprised of the pimps at the top, the hoes they control, and the tricks
[34:53.600 --> 35:01.400]  they both exploit. This is the law of the jungle which has existed for millennia. A survival
[35:01.400 --> 35:08.840]  of the fittest dog eat dog world where the nice guys always finish last. It is the patriarchy
[35:08.840 --> 35:15.160]  that the anti-christians claim to oppose which makes no sense because we are only able to
[35:15.160 --> 35:21.320]  transcend this ruthlessness with the Christian impulse of brotherly love where everyone is
[35:21.320 --> 35:27.480]  equally welcome. There is much talk about a battle being waged between good and evil.
[35:27.480 --> 35:33.680]  But this sort of simple black and white duality only exists in our mind. In reality, what's
[35:33.680 --> 35:40.760]  going on is a balancing act between our spirit and our body. While our spirit may be drawn
[35:40.760 --> 35:46.820]  to love and light, our body is an animal with innate animal instincts that cannot easily
[35:46.820 --> 35:53.520]  be suppressed. And like every other species of animal, the primary instincts are survival
[35:53.520 --> 35:59.800]  and reproduction. So as far as mammals go, the female is the ultimate prize in the game
[35:59.800 --> 36:06.920]  of life. A society built upon a Christian ethos of brotherly love is one that honors
[36:06.920 --> 36:12.600]  individual freedom and the way to satisfy our animal desires for survival with brotherly
[36:12.600 --> 36:19.520]  love is through marriage and raising a family with some degree of selflessness. And without
[36:19.520 --> 36:25.280]  the Christian ethos of brotherly love, the Satanist simply sees women as the most valued
[36:25.280 --> 36:32.480]  commodity to be bought and sold for one's own selfish desire, pimps and hoes. Whether
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.760]  it be in the poorest communities or at the top of the pyramid, Satanism is all about
[36:37.760 --> 36:43.720]  control and the ones at the top have invested everything into their technocratic pop culture
[36:43.720 --> 36:49.640]  media machine, which is their main method of pimping. And they see the brainwashed masses
[36:49.640 --> 36:54.880]  as their hoes because according to the laws of the jungle, they own them, which is why
[36:54.880 --> 37:00.200]  they resent the Christian ethos because it is the only thing on earth that stands against
[37:00.200 --> 37:05.800]  them. But the real problem with Satanism is that it keeps an individual from knowing
[37:05.800 --> 37:12.640]  God and discovering their true path. Our free will allows us the choice to either transcend
[37:12.640 --> 37:19.760]  spiritually, which requires a personal relationship with God or descend into the animal kingdom
[37:19.760 --> 37:26.000]  and forever remain a beast, which is what the pimps and hoes are ultimately selling.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.440]  But we don't have to buy it. Satanic influence has always been with us, and it is nothing
[37:31.440 --> 37:38.760]  to fear. These Satanist pimps are not gods. They are merely animals playing mind tricks
[37:38.760 --> 37:46.160]  and spinning lies. Redemption is for everyone, and humanity has a choice. We can either submit
[37:46.160 --> 37:51.680]  to the beast system and live like animals, or we can follow the Christian impulse for
[37:51.680 --> 37:59.760]  brotherly love and stand up against evil so that our children will know freedom. Reporting
[37:59.760 --> 38:27.240]  for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[38:29.760 --> 38:34.880]  We have a choice to make. We can be part of the beast system, or we can be part of God's
[38:34.880 --> 38:38.520]  system, and that doesn't mean you're going to find it at these candy-ass churches full
[38:38.520 --> 38:44.400]  of a bunch of Pharisees. It means that you have a decision whether you want to be part
[38:44.400 --> 38:49.320]  of the predator class, be destroyed in the process, not just physically but spiritually,
[38:49.320 --> 38:54.400]  or whether you want to be part of the winning team. There are economies of conquest and economies
[38:54.400 --> 39:01.000]  of renaissance. And if you read the UN documents that I cover in Endgame, in the 60s they said
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.560]  we'll promote homosexuality, we'll break the family up, we will bring back paganism and
[39:05.560 --> 39:11.920]  even human sacrifice. That's in Endgame, with the quotes. And you watch that film that's
[39:11.920 --> 39:16.760]  free online still, one version at 80 million views, they took it down, but the other ones
[39:16.760 --> 39:21.120]  have 5 million, 6 million, 3 million views, you can find it. Endgame, blueprint for global
[39:21.120 --> 39:27.680]  enslavement, go watch that 2007 film. It's my best work yet. Never made Endgame 2 because
[39:27.680 --> 39:31.800]  I've just been too busy. Plus you can just see the Endgame here for yourself. You don't
[39:31.800 --> 39:37.640]  need to make another film, really do you? Because part one already told you everything.
[39:37.640 --> 39:43.200]  People watch it now and they flip out. In fact, we'll find a link to something that's
[39:43.200 --> 39:48.520]  still on YouTube or wherever, and we'll link it up on the live show feed as well underneath
[39:48.520 --> 39:54.720]  Greg Reese's report. Satanism demystified. There's a copy on Band-Aid video as well.
[39:54.720 --> 40:05.160]  Alright, let's talk about who actually controls this. Let's talk about who actually runs this
[40:05.160 --> 40:14.040]  and again, call them sociopaths, call them sociopaths. That's just terms that 200-year-old
[40:14.040 --> 40:19.200]  German psychology came up with. It doesn't mean that modern psychology doesn't have
[40:19.200 --> 40:24.040]  some real things it talks about, but it's man-labeling things that are already going
[40:24.040 --> 40:28.960]  on. And then really, most of psychology is being used against us now, we know. And most
[40:28.960 --> 40:34.960]  people that are part of that system in advertising and government are engaged in weaponization
[40:34.960 --> 40:42.720]  of psychology and behavioral psychology for control. Pavlovian manipulation, opera conditioning,
[40:42.720 --> 40:54.200]  the list goes on and on. And people that engage in that type of predatory behavior are pretending
[40:54.200 --> 40:58.680]  that it doesn't affect them and that they're winning by doing it. And I've used the analogy
[40:58.680 --> 41:08.320]  of going to the local community pool and not just pissing in the pool, but taking a crap
[41:08.320 --> 41:13.720]  of the pool. One person does it, it ruins it for everybody. Why don't you just get
[41:13.720 --> 41:18.680]  up and go to the bathroom? Well, a Satanist just says, I'm in charge, I'm God, like cancer
[41:18.680 --> 41:22.520]  in the body, I'll do whatever I want, but you kill the whole body. But let's not use
[41:22.520 --> 41:30.080]  the analogy I've used a hundred times. Let's use another one. If you live in a decent neighborhood
[41:30.080 --> 41:35.120]  and you just decided you were to start robbing houses, don't need the money, but you're
[41:35.120 --> 41:39.840]  going to do it. Maybe you decided you're going to start burning houses down. You know, you
[41:39.840 --> 41:43.520]  burned down one house in the neighborhood, it's going to drive down property values 5%.
[41:43.520 --> 41:49.360]  You burned down 2%, 10%. You burned down 3%, 30%. You burned down 4%, 5%. Everybody's going
[41:49.360 --> 41:56.440]  to put up for sell signs and leave. Now, maybe you're the globalist banks that are engaged
[41:56.440 --> 42:00.080]  in arsenal of society, because once everybody leaves, you buy them and put in a dollar,
[42:00.080 --> 42:05.160]  and that's really their mode of operation. But they are positioning social security and
[42:05.160 --> 42:10.360]  Medicare and Medicaid that the trustees of the federal board have said, it's already
[42:10.360 --> 42:15.440]  basically insolvent. They are collapsing the border. They are collapsing the currency. They
[42:15.440 --> 42:20.600]  are shutting off all the energy. If I see one more headline of like Biden can do nothing,
[42:20.600 --> 42:27.160]  there's nothing we can do to lower energy prices. They cut off the pipelines. They said
[42:27.160 --> 42:33.840]  we're not going to have a fuel in the future. They killed almost all the drilling permits.
[42:33.840 --> 42:36.920]  That's like you don't gas your car up. You wonder why it runs out of gas. Gee, I don't
[42:36.920 --> 42:42.520]  know why my car is out of gas. There's plenty of gas. They won't let you gas it up. All
[42:42.520 --> 42:46.440]  right, I'm going to come back and look at the problem. Who's running it? Because by
[42:46.440 --> 42:49.480]  identifying these folks, we're going to have major victory. And then we're going to look
[42:49.480 --> 42:53.800]  at these pedophile drag queen story time events now happening everywhere with children
[42:53.800 --> 42:59.440]  drug into topless bars. All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us. I want to take

[46:13.000 --> 46:17.840]  out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me I was loaded up with sunspots
[46:17.840 --> 46:22.800]  or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple
[46:22.800 --> 46:30.480]  of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and I was already
[46:30.480 --> 46:34.520]  taking your other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what I need to
[46:34.520 --> 46:38.840]  do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started taking it and
[46:38.840 --> 46:44.680]  it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I started noticing okay
[46:44.680 --> 46:50.000]  you know this is the ticket this is working this is wonderful you know I don't have to
[46:50.000 --> 46:56.000]  put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[46:56.000 --> 47:01.000]  cleared up my skin.
[47:01.000 --> 47:08.000]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[47:31.000 --> 47:49.240]  So we just talked about the ruling class of the pimps the rest of us the hoes the slaves
[47:49.240 --> 47:54.360]  and the tricks that are getting played now the slaves are made by their slave masters
[47:54.360 --> 47:58.200]  to go out and commit crimes against others or they will be attacked they will be destroyed
[47:58.200 --> 48:05.480]  but at the end we all get destroyed and to illustrate that there's a big article on infowars.com
[48:05.480 --> 48:12.120]  from zero hedge that just broke New York Times op ed applause inflation as means to enforce
[48:12.120 --> 48:20.920]  green diet make you eat bugs make you drink sewage make you not have a car carbon lockdowns
[48:20.920 --> 48:25.800]  we told you that was coming 30 months ago it's in their own documents that story is
[48:25.800 --> 48:33.380]  on infowars.com right now so before I hit the top 10 creepiest and most dystopian things
[48:33.380 --> 48:41.640]  pushed by the World Economic Forum let's go to a clip from Fox News reporting what was
[48:41.640 --> 48:48.600]  happening a year ago about how they wouldn't even in a law funding biotech research say
[48:48.600 --> 48:53.840]  you can't cross humans and animals and then create these creatures and you whatever you're
[48:53.840 --> 48:59.720]  being told about it's 30 years ahead of that now how satanic is it if satanism is making
[48:59.720 --> 49:06.160]  humans a commodity not caring about free will enslaving people euthanizing old killing
[49:06.160 --> 49:11.840]  the babies and saying it's fun and cool but all the big reckless corporations all the
[49:11.840 --> 49:16.920]  big arrogant psychopathic corporations are behind it while they claim they're the avant
[49:16.920 --> 49:23.640]  garde pushing for people's rights for the state to have access with men dressed up like clowns
[49:23.640 --> 49:32.600]  to your children at drag queen pedophile time so here's a clip from Fox News talking about
[49:32.600 --> 49:39.960]  the Senate passing the endless frontier act which allowed the human kimi rose because
[49:39.960 --> 49:45.280]  China's doing it we can't get caught it's like a doctor strange love based on real things
[49:45.280 --> 49:49.520]  that happen with Carlos LeMay and others in the early 60s well if the Russians are going
[49:49.520 --> 49:55.000]  to build a doomsday bomb that blows the whole earth up with radiation it makes the surface
[49:55.000 --> 50:02.120]  unlivable well we gotta have one too I mean Mr. President we cannot allow a mine shaft
[50:02.120 --> 50:10.200]  gap here it is human chimeras living among us it's only science fiction for right now
[50:10.200 --> 50:14.720]  yesterday the Senate passed the endless frontier act a bill that commits nearly 250 billion
[50:14.720 --> 50:20.440]  dollars to promote emerging technologies so that America can keep pace with Chinese innovation
[50:20.440 --> 50:26.920]  back in May Democrats shot down an important amendment outlawing US participation in research
[50:26.920 --> 50:32.640]  that would create human animal hybrids also known as chimeras China's already doing it
[50:32.640 --> 50:38.480]  announcing in April that an international team successfully grew human monkey embryos and
[50:38.480 --> 50:45.080]  sustained them for 20 days in a lab the only question is what will they do next chimeric
[50:45.080 --> 50:50.560]  research is a Pandora's box that's obviously from hell that should not be opened but the
[50:50.560 --> 50:56.320]  scientific community spurred on by their own hubris may very well open it using American
[50:56.320 --> 51:03.880]  taxpayer dollars now they already opened it you know I covered four days ago on the show
[51:03.880 --> 51:10.080]  a stack of EU UN and Spanish government documents admitting that they're spraying the atmosphere
[51:10.080 --> 51:16.840]  to manipulate the weather on a global scale but also spring pesticides on us biocide to
[51:16.840 --> 51:22.640]  quote stop covid spring poison on you to stop covid it's all made up it's their pretext
[51:22.640 --> 51:28.800]  of spray poison on you this is happening the actuary show insurance companies 40 plus percent
[51:28.800 --> 51:37.880]  increase in death 18 to 64 working age of the other numbers are out the chart the covid
[51:37.880 --> 51:45.680]  vaccines after introduction has caused a shocking rise in permanent disabilities we're being
[51:45.680 --> 51:51.240]  killed we're being exterminated and they're just normalizing it and like hey just go watch
[51:51.240 --> 51:59.040]  a movie go go watch this I mean I'm you know show just go back to sleep so he's been on
[51:59.040 --> 52:03.600]  the show before he'll be back on this week we've got to John Stein who's also there
[52:03.600 --> 52:08.800]  coming up next hour but John Doyle confronts parents outside Children's Drag Queen show
[52:08.800 --> 52:14.400]  at a gay strip club where children's on this fiber being brought in and we'll show you
[52:14.400 --> 52:20.360]  some of that footage next hour but here he is confronting him out front I only have one
[52:20.360 --> 52:31.320]  question why do you want to put an ax wound in between your son's legs
[52:31.320 --> 52:42.520]  yes we are what do you mean you're making America worse you bring your children to
[52:42.520 --> 53:04.360]  this event I wonder if the mama bear instinct is gonna come out three years when the mainstream
[53:04.360 --> 53:09.720]  Democrat Party platformers they want to rape your kids and they're all gonna think it's
[53:09.720 --> 53:15.680]  one big smug little joke these people by the way understand that there is a bigger difference
[53:15.680 --> 53:21.120]  between ten years ago and now then there would be between now and in five years when they
[53:21.120 --> 53:25.680]  are openly advocating for pedophilia like they've already started doing you people are the
[53:25.680 --> 53:50.760]  symptom of a dying society and you know your children should be home your kids aren't actually
[53:50.760 --> 53:59.300]  gay you've just groomed to them you're scaring children we're bringing them in the gay stripper
[53:59.300 --> 54:04.040]  bar and we got the footage coming up this all over the country all over the world this
[54:04.040 --> 54:10.240]  is corporately funded to destroy their innocence and to normalize the sexualization of children
[54:10.240 --> 54:15.440]  to destroy their future and make sure they don't get a wife or a husband and have a family
[54:15.440 --> 54:24.200]  this is hate this is bullying this is child abuse on steroids with a gravy of PCP and
[54:24.200 --> 54:31.020]  they drag these poor children in like zombies to stand around and be in the middle of this
[54:31.020 --> 54:37.160]  and have them go up and give money to big fat men dressed like clowns as they dance
[54:37.160 --> 54:45.280]  because the servants of Satan have been promised the children I mean look at this taking children
[54:45.280 --> 54:50.720]  that don't have their free will yet putting them in a position like that greenlighting
[54:50.720 --> 54:57.400]  them fast tracking them like Anderson Cooper's mother did to his brother and he right into
[54:57.400 --> 55:03.360]  this they did the same thing with their boys one son committed suicide over it and the
[55:03.360 --> 55:10.840]  other one conformed and took to it and that's what this is man two years three years ago
[55:10.840 --> 55:15.840]  it's gay marriage all we want gay marriage now it's we want your children we want them
[55:15.840 --> 55:22.360]  now this is pedophilia writ large in a corrupt decadent society that can't get excited about
[55:22.360 --> 55:27.680]  anything anymore not about a sunset not about a man and woman no none of that it's all about
[55:27.680 --> 55:33.520]  we've got children as a trophy and we're going to come in the schools and we're going to
[55:33.520 --> 55:39.080]  indoctrinate them and the corporations on the cereal boxes and the pizza boxes and
[55:39.080 --> 55:44.600]  the toy boxes are all going to do this and the answer is I'll never eat I don't eat all
[55:44.600 --> 55:52.240]  that general mills high fructose corn syrup stuff anyways and I haven't probably ordered
[55:52.240 --> 55:58.320]  a pizza hut in years but I will never order from Pizza Hut you shouldn't all these big
[55:58.320 --> 56:02.960]  corporations are out to get you folks unless it's like Goya foods or something who's speaking
[56:02.960 --> 56:08.000]  out you need to check everybody you buy stuff from and make sure they're not coming after
[56:08.000 --> 56:14.400]  kids but the whole big corporate world is coming down on our children because they're
[56:14.400 --> 56:20.400]  the future and if they can get them and they can screw them up they can do anything they
[56:20.400 --> 56:26.920]  want so roll your own dough make your own pizza hell Bill Gates says you won't be getting
[56:26.920 --> 56:32.680]  meat anyway soon they're going to take everything away from you and if you'll accept the five
[56:32.680 --> 56:37.920]  year old being brought to a homosexual bar with men dancing around in front of them you
[56:37.920 --> 56:43.240]  will accept human animal hybrids you will accept clones you will accept GMOs you will
[56:43.240 --> 56:48.840]  accept force inoculations you will accept the takeover your body and these clowns are
[56:48.840 --> 56:55.000]  just the useful idiot vanguard of the system to totally scramble everybody's brain to
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.520]  accept anything going in the future alright Alex Stein who was at this event in Dallas
[57:00.520 --> 57:03.640]  these are happening everywhere we'll join us the first 30 minutes the next hour I'm
[57:03.640 --> 57:09.880]  behind but it's okay and we're going to get into the top 10 creepiest and most disturbing
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.080]  things pushed by the world economic forum that's on enforce.com the Bilderberg group
[57:14.080 --> 57:19.160]  meeting just happened Putin threatening nuclear war but this is very serious people are just
[57:19.160 --> 57:24.680]  ignoring it what's happening the economy of the latest covid news and so much more in
[57:24.680 --> 57:32.220]  our number two now override the censors take the videos take the links enforce.com for
[57:32.220 --> 57:39.840]  slash show bandot video take the links share them that's how you override these tyrants
[57:39.840 --> 57:43.400]  that believe because they've got the corporate money and the power of satan they rule us
[57:43.400 --> 57:50.840]  no your losers you will fail hour two coming up it's going back to what we all thought
[57:50.840 --> 57:55.040]  was going to happen in the 90s when the internet and mobile technology first came out which
[57:55.040 --> 57:58.120]  is we thought you know this is going to level the playing field everybody's going to have
[57:58.120 --> 58:01.320]  access to the same information everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that
[58:01.320 --> 58:07.920]  information that's our goal to get back to that place where we all have access to all
[58:07.920 --> 58:12.320]  of the information we all have the ability to freely communicate that information with
[58:12.320 --> 58:17.800]  whomever we want whenever we want and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what
[58:17.800 --> 58:24.240]  we're doing and trying to judge us or categorize us for figure out some way to go after us
[58:24.240 --> 58:28.240]  because of the conversations we're having because of the internet searches that we're
[58:28.240 --> 58:34.120]  doing because of the discussions the people we want to talk to about these things so that's
[58:34.120 --> 58:38.120]  our goal is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take back their
[58:38.120 --> 58:43.760]  privacy and so that's really what we're trying to do and so I hope that everybody listening
[58:43.760 --> 58:58.560]  will follow you throughout the day.
[58:58.560 --> 59:08.880]  Thank you everyone.
[59:08.880 --> 59:13.960]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[59:13.960 --> 59:18.840]  we want, and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[59:18.840 --> 59:26.080]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[59:26.080 --> 59:31.080]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[59:31.080 --> 59:33.560]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[59:33.560 --> 59:37.760]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take
[59:37.760 --> 59:38.760]  back their privacy.
[59:38.760 --> 59:43.760]  And so that's really what we're trying to do, and so I hope that everybody listening
[59:43.760 --> 1:00:09.760]  to us, and I hope that you guys have a great day, and I hope that you guys have a great
[1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:10.760]  day.
[1:00:10.760 --> 1:00:36.760]  Have a great day, and I hope that you guys have a great day.
[1:00:36.760 --> 1:01:05.760]  I hope that you guys have a great day, and I hope that you guys have a great day.
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:29.760]  Have a great day.
[1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:55.760]  And I hope that you guys have a great day.
[1:01:55.760 --> 1:02:22.760]  Have a great day.
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:47.760]  Have a great day.
[1:02:47.760 --> 1:03:13.760]  Have a great day.
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:40.760]  Have a great day.
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:04:09.760]  Have a great day.
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:36.760]  Have a great day.
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:05:05.760]  Have a great day.
[1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:33.760]  Have a great day.
[1:05:33.760 --> 1:06:02.760]  Have a great day.
[1:06:03.760 --> 1:06:29.760]  Have a great day.
[1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:56.760]  Have a great day.
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:28.760]  Have a great day.
[1:07:29.760 --> 1:07:49.760]  Have a great day.
[1:07:49.760 --> 1:08:17.760]  Have a great day.
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:44.760]  Have a great day.
[1:08:44.760 --> 1:09:13.760]  Have a great day.
[1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:40.760]  Have a great day.
[1:09:40.760 --> 1:10:09.760]  Have a great day.
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:36.760]  Have a great day.
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:11:02.760]  Have a great day.
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:28.760]  Have a great day.
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:54.760]  Have a great day.
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:12:20.760]  Have a great day.
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:46.760]  Have a great day.
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:13:12.760]  Have a great day.
[1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:38.760]  Have a great day.
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:14:04.760]  Have a great day.
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:30.760]  Have a great day.
[1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:56.760]  Have a great day.
[1:14:56.760 --> 1:15:22.760]  Have a great day.
[1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:48.760]  Have a great day.
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:16:15.760]  Have a great day.
[1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:41.760]  Have a great day.
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:17:07.760]  Have a great day.
[1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:33.760]  Have a great day.
[1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:57.760]  Have a great day.
[1:17:57.760 --> 1:18:03.760]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:05.760]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:09.760]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:11.760]  I tried to stop it.
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:15.760]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever
[1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:21.760]  because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:23.760]  It's now out in the open.
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:27.760]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:29.760]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:31.760]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:37.760]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support
[1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:39.760]  because without you, Info Wars would not be here.
[1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:43.760]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the Info War
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:45.760]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:47.760]  So I want to thank you.
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:53.760]  And salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:18:53.760 --> 1:18:57.760]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:18:59.760]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:03.760]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:05.760]  I tried to stop it.
[1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:09.760]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever
[1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:13.760]  because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:17.760]  It's now out in the open.
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:21.760]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:23.760]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:27.760]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:29.760]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:31.760]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:35.760]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support
[1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:37.760]  because without you, Info Wars would not be here.
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:43.760]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the Info War and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:19:43.760 --> 1:20:09.760]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:19.760]  Welcome back to Alex Jones' show, this live Sunday edition.
[1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:21.760]  I want Shroyer coming up in T-minus 40 minutes.
[1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:23.760]  It was Sunday live, 6 a.m.
[1:20:23.760 --> 1:20:25.760]  Alex, I'm just like you.
[1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:29.760]  I don't hate anybody if they're an adult.
[1:20:29.760 --> 1:20:31.760]  I'm not judging people.
[1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:33.760]  I'm not a Pharisee.
[1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:35.760]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:37.760]  We all preface, oh, we don't hate people.
[1:20:37.760 --> 1:20:41.760]  I don't care if they're homosexual or heterosexual, whoever they are, leave kids alone.
[1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:47.760]  There is a corporate targeting of children in their sexual lives.
[1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:51.760]  Something parents don't talk to their children about until they're 10, 11, 12 years old.
[1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:53.760]  It is pedophilia.
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:55.760]  It is evil.
[1:20:55.760 --> 1:20:57.760]  It is sick.
[1:20:57.760 --> 1:20:59.760]  It is behavioral psychology.
[1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:01.760]  CIA mind control.
[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:03.760]  MKUltra was all about sex and kids.
[1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:05.760]  BF Skinner, all of it.
[1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:07.760]  It needs to be rejected totally.
[1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:11.760]  And we have to say no to it.
[1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:13.760]  So you were there at this facility.
[1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:15.760]  It's got national attention.
[1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:17.760]  But it's going on everywhere.
[1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:19.760]  What else did you observe?
[1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:23.760]  You had this photo you sent us of one of these individuals who says they want to be in education.
[1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:25.760]  They want access to your children.
[1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:27.760]  That's what's happening.
[1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:31.760]  So when you turn your children over to these people, it's now confirmed, by the way, the police lied.
[1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:33.760]  I'm so ashamed of them.
[1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:43.760]  The police in Texas evolved the worst in Sandy Hook, worse than Columbine, worse than Broward County.
[1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:45.760]  The stand down was 75 minutes.
[1:21:45.760 --> 1:21:47.760]  They weren't in the building.
[1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:57.760]  They were ordered by the head cop at the school, who's now a city council member who won't cooperate with investigation with the state police or anybody.
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:21:59.760]  That's coming up after you leave us.
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:03.760]  The system is after our children, Alex Stein.
[1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:05.760]  Please continue.
[1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:07.760]  Well, you nailed it with you, Volody.
[1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:09.760]  We can only say so much.
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:13.760]  The story that they tell us, the fact that they stood down for so long, is insubordination.
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:15.760]  It's just typical after 9-11.
[1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:17.760]  Somehow these guys fail miserably.
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:19.760]  And all of a sudden now it becomes a city council member that's probably going to be protected.
[1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:23.760]  And you bet your bottom dollar, I'm going to be in a you Volody city council meeting.
[1:22:23.760 --> 1:22:27.760]  They've already canceled one meeting, but eventually they're going to have to open it up.
[1:22:27.760 --> 1:22:31.760]  The chief is going to get an earful from prime time 99 Alex Stein.
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:33.760]  I'm not speaking hyperbolically when I talk about that.
[1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:37.760]  I'm going to go with you down there because he won't talk to the FBI.
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:39.760]  He won't talk to the state police.
[1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:41.760]  He ordered the stand down 75 minutes.
[1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:43.760]  They arrested parents.
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:45.760]  It's insane.
[1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:47.760]  Well, Alex, you just nailed it.
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:49.760]  When you talk about the children, it's a lot like the Black Lives Matter movement.
[1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:55.760]  Even in their manual, they talk about the denuclearization of the family.
[1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:57.760]  Family household with the father, with the mother.
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:01.760]  And they say their main mission is the end of the nuclear family and making Black men transgender,
[1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:03.760]  which is sterilized Black men.
[1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:05.760]  Well, Alex, you got Kentucky Brown Jackson.
[1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:07.760]  They said, what is a woman?
[1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:09.760]  She can't even say boys have a penis.
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:11.760]  Girls have a vagina.
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:13.760]  I mean, they just can't even break it down to the simple terms.
[1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:17.760]  They want your third grade teacher to dictate what your sexual, what your sexuality is.
[1:23:17.760 --> 1:23:21.760]  You want your third grade or first grade teacher to literally screw your kids up.
[1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.760]  And we're supposed to just stand by and let them do that.
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:25.760]  It's a litmus test.
[1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:29.760]  Well, and the thing is we're failing that litmus test because most people are letting it do it
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:32.760]  because they're already busy with their bills, with their stress or the inflation.
[1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:34.760]  People can't afford to put gas in their car.
[1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:36.760]  People are living in an absolute nightmare.
[1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:38.760]  So then they have to put their kids in public school.
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:42.760]  And you're basically, when you do that, you're putting your kid, the state is raising your kid.
[1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:44.760]  And let's just tell you this, the state does not care about you.
[1:23:44.760 --> 1:23:51.760]  When you put your child in a public school, you're putting them in a den of behavioral psychologists and pedophiles.
[1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:55.760]  Every pedophile on earth is racing towards access with children.
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:57.760]  That's all this is.
[1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:00.760]  Well, Alex, because these people want to be around children.
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:03.760]  I mean, listen, unless a kid is your own kid, most people don't want to be around kids.
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:04.760]  Most normal people.
[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:05.760]  And I'm not anti-kids.
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:09.760]  I'm just saying people have enough with their hands over their own children.
[1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:14.760]  I mean, statistically, we know that a large percentage of these drag queen pedophile times are pedophiles.
[1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:15.760]  100 percent.
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:20.760]  In Houston, a guy that was just arrested, I mean, he was on the sex offender list.
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:22.760]  He was doing the drag queen story time.
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:26.760]  So these guys are actually risking going back to jail just to be able to put a kid in their lap,
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:31.760]  just to be able to watch a kid just because their sexual fantasies are more important than their actual long-term goals.
[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:32.760]  They are willing to go to jail.
[1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:34.760]  And this is the problem out.
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:40.760]  Even in jail, if you're a child molester, you have to be in a special wing because they are going to kill you in jail if you're a child molester.
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:45.760]  And now these liberal mothers bring their children to settle these people's laps.
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:49.760]  Yeah, but I'm just saying, even in jail, the worst place on earth, they hate child molesters.
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:54.760]  So these are the, you know, the most hardened criminals in the world still don't respect the child molester.
[1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:56.760]  These are the worst people on earth.
[1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:57.760]  And this is the problem, though, Alex.
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:24:58.760]  It's very cyclical.
[1:24:58.760 --> 1:25:02.760]  I would guarantee the majority of these people doing this would abuse their children.
[1:25:02.760 --> 1:25:08.760]  And again, the police would raid an Austin topless bar and they brought a 16-year-old girl to it.
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:11.760]  I mean, the adults want to go do that, do that.
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:12.760]  That's your right.
[1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:19.760]  But the point is they're bringing children to strip tease events because it's LGBT. It's okay.
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:21.760]  No, it's not okay.
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:23.760]  Yeah, and Alex, this place didn't serve food.
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:25.760]  And now they say, oh, in Texas, there's a law.
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:27.760]  If you're with your parent, you can have a beer.
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:28.760]  Yeah, that's for teenagers.
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:29.760]  That's not for nine-year-olds.
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:33.760]  Yeah, if you're 16 or 15, yeah, a waiter lets you have a beer with your dad sometimes.
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:38.760]  But a nine-year-old, a six-year-old coddlers inside of a bar that doesn't serve food.
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:43.760]  So there's no justification for them to even be in there unless you want them to be part of some sort of satanic lifestyle
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:47.760]  that's grooming them for them to be socially acceptable.
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:51.760]  Because this is the thing, is these people know their whole culture is not socially acceptable.
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:53.760]  They know that it's not okay to shake their children over.
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:55.760]  And they're trying to take the culture over and they're corporately backed.
[1:25:55.760 --> 1:25:57.760]  Alex Don, tell me about this individual.
[1:25:57.760 --> 1:25:59.760]  The photo you sent us will do an overhead shot.
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:01.760]  This individual says they want to go to school.
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:04.760]  They're going to school to be a teacher.
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:09.760]  Well, this is Noel, so I have a video, I think it's at 1.2 million views just on Twitter
[1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:12.760]  and it's been shared on, you know, every single social media platform on YouTube.
[1:26:12.760 --> 1:26:18.760]  And this person right there, when I confronted them, Alex, they melted like an ice cream cone in the sunlight.
[1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:21.760]  I mean, they felt so guilty, so much shame.
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:24.760]  And then when you look at that photo, if they can zoom out a little bit, you'll see the caption.
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:25.760]  It says, want to get pizza.
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:27.760]  So this goes back to what I was saying.
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:28.760]  These are FBI.
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:30.760]  This is declassified information.
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:35.760]  These are the secret code words that they use in order to talk about their child pedophilia.
[1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:37.760]  It means children.
[1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:38.760]  Yes.
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:39.760]  Walnuts mean this.
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:41.760]  Map means minor attracted person.
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:42.760]  So they have to speak in code words.
[1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:44.760]  That's why they have symbols and signs.
[1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:46.760]  And it's a lot like what the people that are in power use.
[1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:49.760]  That's why they trick us and they mock us with signs and symbols.
[1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:51.760]  So we don't know what's going on.
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:55.760]  But they have a dog whistle and they're laughing like Klaus Schwab, these people that are in church.
[1:26:55.760 --> 1:26:57.760]  They're all laughing at us, Alex.
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:02.760]  That's the thing is 1% of the population, less than 1% of the population has 99% of the wealth.
[1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:05.760]  So we know that there is no middle class currently in America.
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:12.760]  So it is a destabilization, making it impossible to even live and operate in a world and have happiness, to have joy.
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:20.760]  And they literally, I don't remember 10 years ago, they were handing out condoms to five-year-olds at the Cub Scout and Boy Scout jubilee,
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:24.760]  thousands of rapes, and then the left took over the Boy Scouts.
[1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:29.760]  This is how they took over the Catholic Church. It's how they take over the Boy Scouts, how they take over universities.
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:31.760]  This is a sex cult.
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:36.760]  And Alex, the social media is the big problem because when you and I were in school, we didn't have our teachers' Facebook group.
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:38.760]  We didn't know about our teachers' gay crews.
[1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:40.760]  We didn't know about our teachers' boyfriend.
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:43.760]  When I left school at 3.30, I didn't know what my teachers did.
[1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:50.760]  But now with the social media, now everybody has their extremely online lifestyle, you're able to indoctrinate these kids.
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:54.760]  And they see, oh, the teachers, this seems cool.
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:57.760]  So what I'm saying is these teachers have a lot of power over the youth.
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:00.760]  They have even more power now than they've ever had.
[1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:08.760]  And they're using it for evil, satanic agenda in order to indoctrinate our children in order to groom them so that we live in a world
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:10.760]  because call me conspiratorial all you want.
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:14.760]  In the future, they want us to all be one race and one sexual gender.
[1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:15.760]  How do they do that?
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:16.760]  They confuse us.
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:18.760]  They make it so we don't have love.
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:19.760]  We don't find a sex partner.
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:21.760]  We all die alone, unhappy.
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:23.760]  We're all gay, bisexual.
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:27.760]  They want us isolated, totally confused, programmed by them.
[1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:29.760]  It's the corporate takeover.
[1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:30.760]  We come back.
[1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:35.760]  Elon Musk came out and asked, why doesn't the DOJ leak?
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:36.760]  Look at everything else.
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:39.760]  Epstein's client list, does it that seem odd?
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:41.760]  Because they're running it.
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:42.760]  Because they're part of it.
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:48.760]  And we'll expose Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein and the pedo rings and the cloning rings.
[1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:51.760]  And what it's really all about with Alex Stein, straight ahead.
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:24.760]  We'll penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment,
[1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:28.760]  the founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission, the United Nations,
[1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:31.760]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[1:29:31.760 --> 1:29:37.760]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't exist.
[1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:40.760]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head.
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:43.760]  Still on the steering committee is Klaus Schwab.
[1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:46.760]  And he has set up the great reset in global government.
[1:29:46.760 --> 1:29:50.760]  If, as a Liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on,
[1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:54.760]  about the second thing, or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:56.760]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[1:29:56.760 --> 1:30:00.760]  Introducing the newest product from InfowarsLife.com.

[1:31:09.760 --> 1:31:12.760]  so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word,
[1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:15.760]  and so we can push people to websites like Infowars.com
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:18.760]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[1:31:18.760 --> 1:31:22.760]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,
[1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:24.760]  some of which go back more than 25 years.
[1:31:24.760 --> 1:31:26.760]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[1:31:26.760 --> 1:31:31.760]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[1:31:31.760 --> 1:31:35.760]  So there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:37.760]  In a couple of weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:42.760]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.

[1:32:51.760 --> 1:32:56.760]  I want to thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com.
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:27.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:40.760]  I want something to sink in really deep on this Sunday evening, June 5th, 2022.
[1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:44.760]  Imagine 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago,
[1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:51.760]  if you heard any of the things that will be going on now that are happening now, what would you say?
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:56.760]  I mean, if random groups wanted to obsess and meet with your 5-year-old about their politics,
[1:33:56.760 --> 1:34:02.760]  you'd say, no, you're trying to take over my territory, my life, my family, our ancestors, who we are,
[1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:03.760]  you're trying to dominate me.
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:07.760]  But these are people saying, we want to teach your child, they're another gender.
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:12.760]  We want to take your children to a gay bar.
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:14.760]  We want to do all this.
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:21.760]  This is absolute evil taking place all over the world.
[1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:24.760]  It's just Alex Stein and Dallas that's confronting it.
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:27.760]  So Alex, please continue, my friend, with what you're laying out here.
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:31.760]  Well, Alex, and one thing I want to say, somebody sent me some better pictures,
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:35.760]  but a lot of these people, Antifa, I'm just using that as a general term,
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:38.760]  the people that were counter-protesting us, they were carrying, they had weapons,
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:41.760]  so I'm not trying to virtue-save them or starting to get a pat on my back.
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:44.760]  But these people are evil, sadistic, they're probably on some sort of psychotropic drugs,
[1:34:44.760 --> 1:34:47.760]  they're probably all having suicidal idolization.
[1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:50.760]  So the fact that they have a gun out there and they're trying to counter-protest us,
[1:34:50.760 --> 1:34:53.760]  it is a scary place, and I'm not saying this to try to, like I said,
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:55.760]  I'm not trying to get a pat on my back.
[1:34:55.760 --> 1:34:58.760]  But we have to stand up before it's too late, because if we don't stand up,
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:03.760]  we don't speak for ourselves, nobody's going to speak for us, nobody's going to represent us.
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:06.760]  And that's the problem is these people, they're afraid of sounding homophobic,
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:08.760]  they're afraid of sounding bigoted.
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:10.760]  I'm not a bigot, I'm not a homophobe.
[1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:13.760]  But I am a pedophobe.
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:15.760]  I am a pedophobe, 100%.
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:18.760]  That's the problem, like I was saying earlier, in prison, the Chomos get killed.
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:22.760]  And we know, we have people like Dennis Hasser, who's Secretary of the State,
[1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:25.760]  convicted pedophile, these are people in high positions.
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:27.760]  You look at Kintaji Brown Jackson, Supreme Court Justice,
[1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:32.760]  her resume is being easy on child predators, people that have looked up child porn.
[1:35:32.760 --> 1:35:36.760]  So this is the world we're living in, you just talk about a 10-year flashback,
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:40.760]  I mean, what's happening now, we would never, nobody could have even written this in a book,
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:45.760]  except for George Orwell, or except for Brave New World, where everybody's on somas,
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:48.760]  everybody's on anti-depressants that make them more depressed.
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:52.760]  And like I said, the misery loves company, these people want to indoctrinate our kids
[1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:55.760]  and bring them into their hellhole of a life, their depression of a life.
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:59.760]  Because in some of the videos I call them out, these people that are defending them, Alex,
[1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:01.760]  they have huge cut marks on their wrists and their hands.
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:04.760]  So they're obviously cutters, they're self-mutilators.
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:09.760]  That type of person is trying to self-mutilate her, you know, God bless them,
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:11.760]  I feel bad for them, I have empathy for them.
[1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:14.760]  But these are the people you want to hang around your children? No.
[1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:19.760]  We've got a bunch of people that should be in mental institutions obsessed with our children,
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:24.760]  this is in rocket science, and they have corporate backing, that's the key.
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:27.760]  Yeah, and we have a mental health crisis, it's obvious, that's the problem,
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:30.760]  that's why they say the gun violence, well a gun has never shot itself,
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:34.760]  it's some crazy person behind it. So we have a system where people are literally,
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:39.760]  depending on big pharma, that is a multinational corporation that wants to keep you sick,
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:43.760]  it's not, listen, big pharma is not trying to heal any of the sickness.
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:47.760]  And I love when they start attacking and hitting you for TV viewers to see it,
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:52.760]  ready to lose your skin, the videos are all on InfoWars.com and on your Twitter and other sites.
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:56.760]  You don't punch them back, you just pull a ski mask off.
[1:36:56.760 --> 1:36:58.760]  Yeah, because I want to demask them, because that's what they do,
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:01.760]  they think that they're comfortable putting on the mask, hiding behind it,
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:03.760]  so they think that they can operate very freely.
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:07.760]  Well, that's not the case, we need to stand up and demask these people and expose them,
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:12.760]  and that's why InfoWars does a great job, because when you expose them and they have to put their name on it,
[1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:15.760]  it's like those keyboard warriors, Alex, that can hide behind an avatar,
[1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:18.760]  they'll say a lot of mean stuff, but they'll never say it to your face.
[1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:21.760]  Well, these people say mean stuff to your face, but they hide behind a mask,
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:25.760]  because they don't want to back it up, they're not wearing a mask because of COVID,
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:28.760]  they're doing it because they want to hide, because they know there are going to be cameras there,
[1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:30.760]  so we have to stand up, we have to demask these people,
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:33.760]  and they should be held accountable for their crazy viewpoints,
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:40.760]  because when I confronted that drag queen, you could see just the shame and the guilt in their personality,
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:44.760]  they knew what they did is wrong, and most of these people know what they're doing is wrong,
[1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:47.760]  but they continue to do it because they have other people cheerleading them,
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:50.760]  they have other evil people going, oh, this is good, this is good,
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:54.760]  it only takes one person at the top to make other people do it, it's like the police,
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:37:58.760]  I know you've got so many clips, and I want to get to this,
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:03.760]  can you send it to us, or which clip is it where you confront?
[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:10.760]  Yes, I'll send it to you, that clip is one of the best ones, hold on, let me send it to her right now,
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:13.760]  but that's where I'm walking to the car, yes, this is the one,
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:16.760]  so this is the person that has that I want to get pizza,
[1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:21.760]  and you can just tell, they're so mad, they started off walking it very normal,
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:24.760]  but you can just tell the guilt and the shame that they had,
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:28.760]  that's why all of a sudden they go off the handle like that, because it's projection, they're projecting all that.
[1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:32.760]  Okay, so we do have the clip, so we're going to pause her for a moment,
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:37.760]  we're going to cue the clip up, and here is the clip.
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:41.760]  Little children, do you like dancing for little children?
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:44.760]  You don't think that's disgusting?
[1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:46.760]  Dancing around for little children?
[1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:48.760]  Don't you think that's disgusting?
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:51.760]  Hey, get the f*** away!
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:54.760]  You don't think that's disgusting?
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:57.760]  You don't think that's disgusting?
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:38:59.760]  Dancing for little children?
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:03.760]  You should be ashamed of yourself dancing for little children,
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:05.760]  you should be ashamed of yourself.
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:07.760]  Is he a child?
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:09.760]  You guys dance a little children?
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:12.760]  You should be ashamed of yourselves, you're disgusting.
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:14.760]  Think about what you just did.
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:18.760]  Okay, that's fine, but you dance naked in front of little children.
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:20.760]  You did, you did.
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:23.760]  I mean, look at these freaks, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:26.760]  and they have a total desire to destroy innocence.
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:29.760]  You dance in front of little children.
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:31.760]  You know, I'm just saying, you can tell the guilt and shame,
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:34.760]  that's why they're freaking out, that's why they're trying to get into a car.
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:37.760]  See, I stand behind what I say, I'm willing to sit there and have a conversation,
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:40.760]  they aren't, as soon as they dance and they shake around in front of their kids
[1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:42.760]  and they get tipped like a stripper,
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.760]  run through the back door and get in their car and drive off,
[1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:46.760]  because they don't want to actually face the music,
[1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:48.760]  that's the problem in society.
[1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:50.760]  Well, that's why they wear the clown outfits,
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:54.760]  which steals a woman's identity that a fat, ugly man or a man is a woman,
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:39:56.760]  because they're in a clown outfit, they're not,
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:40:00.760]  it's it the clown comes in disguise to go and do this event,
[1:40:00.760 --> 1:40:02.760]  and they don't want the light of day,
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:05.760]  because they don't want their backgrounds checked.
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:07.760]  Well, it's, all you got to do is look at the numbers of people
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:10.760]  with gender reassignment surgeries and the trans movement,
[1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:13.760]  in the 80s, it was a very small percent, it was like one percent.
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:15.760]  Bill Maher had the best monologue about it,
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:17.760]  talking about from the 60s, it was one tenth of one percent,
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:19.760]  then it doubled, then it doubled,
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:21.760]  and now you look at places, now it's like, you know,
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:23.760]  20% of kids are trans or transitioning,
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.760]  in California, you know, there's that one, it's like one out of every...
[1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:29.760]  This is a sterilization death call taking over.
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:31.760]  But I just want to say this point, in California,
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:33.760]  it's like one out of, you know, every 20 kids,
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:35.760]  and I'm just saying this number for a general term,
[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:37.760]  one out of every 20 kids is trans,
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:40.760]  but in Ohio, it's like one out of every 1,000.
[1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:43.760]  So what's the difference between Los Angeles and Cleveland, Ohio?
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:46.760]  It's because the indoctrination of the culture they're around.
[1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:49.760]  It's not because, oh, all of a sudden, oh, I'm a girl,
[1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:51.760]  I was born, even though I have a penis, I'm a girl.
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:54.760]  So this is the problem, it's these outside forces,
[1:40:54.760 --> 1:40:57.760]  or the ones that are dictating and taking advantage of these children.
[1:40:57.760 --> 1:40:59.760]  And this transgender movement, this isn't some new thing.
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:02.760]  I mean, I'm a conspiracy theorist, you look at the Statue of Liberty,
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:05.760]  they say is trans. I mean, there's, this has been a kind of a long time,
[1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:08.760]  even Shakespeare would put the male actors in dresses.
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:10.760]  And there was women there, so I'm just saying,
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:13.760]  this is a calculated thing in order to transition people
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:17.760]  to make men boys, to make girls guys, to confuse us
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:19.760]  so we don't know what's going on.
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:21.760]  That's right, that's right, there's always been men
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:23.760]  that want to take over the place of women.
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:25.760]  First, they tell you, oh, there are no women,
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:29.760]  no men and women, there's a targeting of women going on,
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:32.760]  there's a key report that breaks this down at Band-Aid video,
[1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:35.760]  Satanism De-Mestified.
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:38.760]  Sorry, my doubts go crazy, but this is all we got to talk about, Alice.
[1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:41.760]  Look at Leah Thomas, swam on the men's team for three years
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:45.760]  and the NCAA ranks 457, then switches over to the women's team,
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:49.760]  wins multiple NCAA championships, and the media cheerleads this.
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:52.760]  That is so against everything that is right.
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:54.760]  Those poor women that spend every weekend,
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:57.760]  every summer going to summer camp swimming in a pool,
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:00.760]  they finally make it to the top 17 in the entire country
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:03.760]  out of the thousands of colleges in America.
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:05.760]  There's only 17 in that final race,
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:09.760]  and they got a race against a guy that has a penis and testicles
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:12.760]  and that still likes to sleep with women.
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:16.760]  What kind of clown world accepts that and not only accepts it out,
[1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:18.760]  cheerleads it from the mainstream media.
[1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:21.760]  It all is a test, Alex Stein, to see what we'll put up with
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:23.760]  and what we'll submit with the clones
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:25.760]  and all of it, the transhumanism coming out.
[1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:28.760]  Where does everybody find the amazing work you and others are doing?
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:31.760]  Well, listen, I wanted to say, you guys find me on Twitter,
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:34.760]  Instagram, Alex999, if you can't find me, you're not looking,

[1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:44.760]  at infowarstore.com and I want to thank you
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:46.760]  for your support over the years because without you
[1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:48.760]  all of the great success we have had together
[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:49.760]  would not have happened.
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:51.760]  We are the tip of the spear, you are the tip of the spear.
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:53.760]  And I salute you and thank you.
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:47:17.760]  Visit infowarstore.com today.
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:20.760]  All right, in about 12 minutes from now,
[1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:23.760]  this Sunday Transmission with Alex Jones hosting,
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:26.760]  but Owen Schreuer is coming in and we did the Sunday
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:29.760]  live show where the radio stations and TV stations
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:32.760]  can pick it up, but we only do six minutes of ads
[1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:36.760]  an hour, only the local ads, no network ads.
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:38.760]  And that's a model I want to go to soon.
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:40.760]  You know, I go on these other big podcasts and shows
[1:47:40.760 --> 1:47:43.760]  and they go, why do you have 14 minutes of ads an hour?
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:45.760]  Well, that's what TV and radio have.
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:46.760]  That's the industry standard.
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:48.760]  Some have more, some have less.
[1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:50.760]  14 minutes is the average.
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:52.760]  And that's why they couldn't platform us
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:55.760]  because we had 200 affiliates on radio
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:57.760]  four years ago when they de-platformed us.
[1:47:57.760 --> 1:48:00.760]  Now we have approaching 400 radio affiliates
[1:48:00.760 --> 1:48:02.760]  and hundreds of TV stations.
[1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:05.760]  The broadcast has exploded.
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:09.760]  So as negative as all this is and as scary as it is,
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:12.760]  it's in God's plan, evil's making its move.
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:16.760]  We will win, but we have to have the courage
[1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:18.760]  to speak out and say no to it.
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:21.760]  So Owen Schreuer will be hosting Sunday Night Live
[1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:23.760]  if your station doesn't carry it.
[1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:24.760]  It really should.
[1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:26.760]  But regardless, infowars.com.
[1:48:26.760 --> 1:48:29.760]  Band.video, the big live show feed
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:31.760]  on the front page of the site will have it.
[1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:35.760]  We'll talk about the Pito Drag Show for kids in Dallas.
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:37.760]  A bunch of key reports.
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:40.760]  He'll be taking calls throughout the next two hours
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:42.760]  coming up straight ahead.
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:44.760]  And then I'll be back tomorrow morning,
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:47.760]  11 a.m. Central, right after Harrison Smith
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:49.760]  at American Journal, 8 a.m. weekdays
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:52.760]  at infowars.com.
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:53.760]  But look at this right here.
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:55.760]  This is the photo that Alex Stein mentioned
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:57.760]  right before we went to break.
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:00.760]  And it's just all these great listeners that are there.
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:03.760]  He said, not just these folks, but so many others.
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:05.760]  We salute them with info war shirts.
[1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:08.760]  Alex shows us right, standing against pure evil,
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:10.760]  being on the right side of history.
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:12.760]  And look at those glowing eyes,
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:14.760]  those sweet, good, smart people.
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:17.760]  You look at the people serving the New World Order
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:20.760]  and they just look like they're dead.
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:22.760]  And they are just servants of evil.
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:26.760]  They are captured souls turned into engines
[1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:28.760]  of corruption and domination.
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:32.760]  And Elon Musk is totally right.
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:34.760]  We have just department leaks on myself,
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:37.760]  Trump, Roger Stone.
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:39.760]  They do congressional subpoenas.
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:43.760]  And they release the stuff selectively out of context.
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:45.760]  They have Supreme Court leaks.
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:48.760]  But where are the leaks of Jeffrey Epstein's phone
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:52.760]  and Jeffrey Epstein's client list that the FBI has?
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:53.760]  Where are the leaks?
[1:49:53.760 --> 1:49:55.760]  We already have the public laptop
[1:49:55.760 --> 1:49:58.760]  with all the pedophilia on it of Hunter Biden.
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:01.760]  It's a cult of pedophiles.
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:03.760]  Because if somebody will hurt a child,
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:06.760]  they'll do anything and they're soulless
[1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:10.760]  and Satan can just swoop right in because there is no God.
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:12.760]  There is no connection to the infinite.
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:14.760]  There is no Holy Spirit.
[1:50:14.760 --> 1:50:15.760]  So Elon Musk asks,
[1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:18.760]  why doesn't the DOJ leak Epstein's client list?
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:20.760]  Doesn't that seem odd?
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:22.760]  Great job, Elon Musk.
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:25.760]  Why can't you more every single day?
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:28.760]  And here's one of the main men dressed as a woman
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:30.760]  because kids dress women
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:32.760]  at the event saying,
[1:50:32.760 --> 1:50:36.760]  I want to get pizza.
[1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:38.760]  Very interesting.
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:41.760]  I mentioned this quite a bit earlier.
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:44.760]  We're going to get into it right now.
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:47.760]  It's an article that's all over the place
[1:50:47.760 --> 1:50:49.760]  from Vigilant Citizen.
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:51.760]  And it only scratches the surface.
[1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:53.760]  It's worse than they even say here,
[1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:55.760]  but this article is great.
[1:50:55.760 --> 1:50:59.760]  It's at zerohedge.com and infowars.com
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:01.760]  because it'll really wake people up.
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:03.760]  It only covers some of the stuff.
[1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:06.760]  I've got some other examples, but look at this.
[1:51:06.760 --> 1:51:10.760]  The top 10 creepiest and most dystopian things
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:13.760]  pushed by the World Economic Forum
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:16.760]  that is the public arm of the Bilderberg Group.
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:18.760]  Penetrating governments.
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:20.760]  We control your governments.
[1:51:20.760 --> 1:51:22.760]  We are now in control.
[1:51:22.760 --> 1:51:24.760]  We don't want the people involved.
[1:51:24.760 --> 1:51:27.760]  His own Wikipedia page says he doesn't want the people involved.
[1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:29.760]  That's called being a dictator.
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:31.760]  Number nine.
[1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:33.760]  Number nine.
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:35.760]  And this article is great because it shows all the videos,
[1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:37.760]  all the quotes, all the clips.
[1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:41.760]  Number nine, controlling minds using sound waves.
[1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:42.760]  Look at this.
[1:51:42.760 --> 1:51:44.760]  Mind control using sound waves in 5G.
[1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:46.760]  We ask the scientists how it works.
[1:51:46.760 --> 1:51:48.760]  World Economic Forum.
[1:51:48.760 --> 1:51:50.760]  The 5G will make you submit.
[1:51:50.760 --> 1:51:53.760]  You will love it. It's so good.
[1:51:53.760 --> 1:51:56.760]  Number eight, pills that contain microchips
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:51:58.760]  to make sure you're taking the pill
[1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:00.760]  all the government orders you to take.
[1:52:00.760 --> 1:52:02.760]  That's the Debo Scroop.
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:04.760]  All agreeing you should be made to take pills
[1:52:04.760 --> 1:52:07.760]  with microchips in it.
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:10.760]  Number seven, praising massive lockdowns.
[1:52:10.760 --> 1:52:14.760]  Praising the lockdowns that starved 40 plus million to death.
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:17.760]  Demanding new lockdowns anytime there's a virus
[1:52:17.760 --> 1:52:20.760]  for total martial law and fear and control.
[1:52:20.760 --> 1:52:25.760]  All the clips, all the links, all the tweets right there.
[1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:27.760]  And saying the lockdowns were good for the earth.
[1:52:27.760 --> 1:52:29.760]  Number six, take a peek in the future.
[1:52:29.760 --> 1:52:31.760]  You'll eat bugs. You'll have no beef.
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:34.760]  There are no families. Pedophilia is legal.
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:38.760]  Go read it for yourself.
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:42.760]  It is just the declaration of war against humanity
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:48.760]  by the bankers that have stolen pure and total absolute control.
[1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:50.760]  Number five, pushing the great reset.
[1:52:50.760 --> 1:52:52.760]  Shut down fossil fuels.
[1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:55.760]  Collapse borders in the family as we know it.
[1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:58.760]  Get rid of small businesses.
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:02.760]  The great reset is the great extermination.
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:04.760]  And it goes on, you know, tomorrow,
[1:53:04.760 --> 1:53:07.760]  I think I'm going to play all the clips in the excerpts that are in this
[1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:10.760]  and maybe spend like two hours on it
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:14.760]  because it is so powerful.
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:17.760]  Rehabilitating, or excuse me, that's a Freudian slip,
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:21.760]  recalibrating freedom of speech.
[1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:24.760]  And they define that as getting rid of freedom of speech
[1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:28.760]  and only allowing corporate speech they want
[1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:31.760]  and having surveillance and AI control
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:38.760]  and lecturing you about what your speech can be or should not be.
[1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:41.760]  Number three, tracking your clothes
[1:53:41.760 --> 1:53:43.760]  and then finally chips inside your body,
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:47.760]  Klaus Schwab, the UN, all of them saying it's the next phase
[1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:50.760]  of the global ID with the vaccine passport.
[1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:55.760]  That'll be the carbon passport that they're bringing out right now.
[1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:58.760]  Number two, smartphones will be in your body.
[1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:01.760]  You'll have to have it to leave your house by law.
[1:54:01.760 --> 1:54:04.760]  You will live in a virtual reality inside your own home.
[1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:07.760]  Number one, you'll own nothing and be happy
[1:54:07.760 --> 1:54:10.760]  because we will totally bankrupt you.
[1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:13.760]  And there's all the clips and all the links
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:18.760]  and every word we say, every word we cover is in the document.
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:21.760]  What an important article from Vigilance Citizen
[1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:24.760]  at infowars.com, zerohedge.com,
[1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:28.760]  and so many other great sites and defiance of this anti-human force.
[1:54:28.760 --> 1:54:31.760]  The war for the future is now.
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:33.760]  You're being made a corporate commodity
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:37.760]  and if you'll let pedophiles and criminals and crazy people
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:39.760]  come have access to your children.
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:44.760]  If you'll put up with that, they believe you will put up with anything.
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:45.760]  But they're weak.
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:48.760]  That's why since the 50s, they denied the Bilderberg Group existed.
[1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:50.760]  Then it created the Davos Group, it's public group.
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:53.760]  They're meeting at the Grand Orient in D.C. right now.
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:56.760]  The meeting is just now ending as we speak.
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:54:57.760]  Here's London Guardian.
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:54:58.760]  I mean, force a report on it.
[1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:03.760]  Bilderberg reconvenes in person after two-year pandemic gas.
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:06.760]  Charlie Skelton is a great guy.
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:08.760]  It goes on and on.
[1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:11.760]  Bill Gates and Richard Branson are betting lab-grown meat
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:15.760]  might be the future of the future, grown from dead bugs.
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:18.760]  And they're buying up all the farmland so you can't have beef
[1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:21.760]  associated with the IRIQ.
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:24.760]  And then we have the footage of the dictator of New Zealand
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:28.760]  taking orders from BlackRock and Vanguard.
[1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:34.760]  That's some of the news at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:37.760]  And I've got all these other stacks of news.
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:40.760]  Putin threatening nuclear war, it's back in the newspaper.
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:42.760]  Everybody blaming Biden for what's happening,
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:43.760]  which I hate Biden.
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:44.760]  He's a puppet.
[1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:46.760]  It's the globalist agenda doing it.
[1:55:46.760 --> 1:55:47.760]  We've got all that.
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:51.760]  But Owen Schreuer takes over in the next two hours,
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:55.760]  only six minutes ads an hour, only local breaks, no network breaks,
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:55:57.760]  coming up with your phone calls and more.
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:00.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't prosecute this war
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:02.760]  without your word of mouth and your prayer and your support.
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:03.760]  You've been doing it.
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:06.760]  We've had so many amazing things happen the last few months.
[1:56:06.760 --> 1:56:08.760]  So many doors opened.
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:11.760]  When just two months ago, I could not make payroll
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:13.760]  and we thought we have to be shut down.
[1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:16.760]  And then three or four big doors opened up,
[1:56:16.760 --> 1:56:18.760]  big donations, small donations,
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:22.760]  new suppliers for the products, incredible companies,
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:24.760]  a bunch of other stuff that's happened.
[1:56:24.760 --> 1:56:29.760]  So thanks to the grace of God, we are still on air.
[1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:31.760]  And I want to thank you all.
[1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:34.760]  Number one, more important than a financial support,
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:38.760]  more important than word of mouth is prayer,
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:41.760]  intercessing to God and praying for doors to open
[1:56:41.760 --> 1:56:43.760]  for info wars and for the truth to get out
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:45.760]  and for you to spread the word is incredible.
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:47.760]  So I thank you all for what you've done.
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:49.760]  And tomorrow I'll talk more about the positive things
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:52.760]  that have happened as well, not just the negative of the enemy,
[1:56:52.760 --> 1:56:54.760]  but God deserves the credit.
[1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:56.760]  We don't spend enough time thanking God
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:56:58.760]  for intercessing through a year for your prayer.
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:00.760]  Because God is a God of free will.
[1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:03.760]  God is the God of the universe and you've got to ask for it.
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:06.760]  You've got to believe in it. You've got to want it.
[1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:08.760]  Just like the globalists want to make contact
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:11.760]  with your children to screw them up.
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:13.760]  God wants to make contact with you to empower you
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:16.760]  and fulfill you and just do amazing things.
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:19.760]  So tomorrow, 11 a.m., we're talking about positive things,
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:20.760]  kicking things off.
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:23.760]  But whatever you do, spread the word, my friends,
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:25.760]  it's a real power you've got on your email,
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:26.760]  your text message.
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:30.760]  However, infowars.com forward slash show,

[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:39.760]  and hundreds of millions of billions listening
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:41.760]  if you realize the power you've got.
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:42.760]  Great job, crew.

[1:58:46.760 --> 1:58:48.760]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:58:48.760 --> 1:58:50.760]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:58:50.760 --> 1:58:51.760]  Welcome.
[1:58:51.760 --> 1:58:52.760]  Hello, Alex.
[1:58:52.760 --> 1:58:53.760]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:58:53.760 --> 1:58:55.760]  I'm Mike in Real Short, where the other patrons
[1:58:55.760 --> 1:58:56.760]  can get on the line.
[1:58:56.760 --> 1:58:58.760]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[1:58:58.760 --> 1:59:00.760]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[1:59:00.760 --> 1:59:03.760]  Supermell Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[1:59:03.760 --> 1:59:05.760]  Mix those two together.
[1:59:05.760 --> 1:59:06.760]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:59:06.760 --> 1:59:08.760]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[1:59:08.760 --> 1:59:11.760]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds
[1:59:11.760 --> 1:59:13.760]  that have never been heated up.
[1:59:13.760 --> 1:59:17.760]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:20.760]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:22.760]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:24.760]  In fact, each batch is different.
[1:59:24.760 --> 1:59:26.760]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just OK.
[1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:28.760]  People are like, why are you selling something
[1:59:28.760 --> 1:59:30.760]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:59:30.760 --> 1:59:31.760]  That's just how it is.
[1:59:31.760 --> 1:59:32.760]  It's how it works.
[1:59:32.760 --> 1:59:34.760]  So it's always good.
[1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:36.760]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:38.760]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce
[1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:56.760]  at a decent price, then this shit.
