[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones

[00:41.880 --> 00:45.800]  farmer ranch without government license total control you want to be a slave
[00:45.800 --> 00:50.960]  you're all being criminalized so they can lock your butts up let's take calls
[00:50.960 --> 00:59.000]  here Robert in West Virginia you're on the air go ahead I like to talk to you
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.160]  about the carbon taxes I'm a rural West Virginia and I'm a blacksmith this this
[01:06.160 --> 01:13.720]  deals with everything I do along with the premises ID and animal ID and all
[01:13.720 --> 01:20.680]  that stuff I tried to study the bill real good because it has a lot to do
[01:20.680 --> 01:25.920]  with my daily life unlike most people who live in the cities my daily life is
[01:25.920 --> 01:29.520]  different you know and what it does for those that don't know we cover this and
[01:29.520 --> 01:34.440]  follow the Republic and I want you to speak to it it says that 35 agencies
[01:34.440 --> 01:40.320]  have unlimited power to write whatever rules they want on any carbon dioxide or
[01:40.320 --> 01:47.320]  other gas that's right that's right and they regularly they're already for the
[01:47.320 --> 01:52.240]  last year been regulating coal up here for private purchase for individuals
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.000]  you only allow two tons of coal a year and that's why the oil companies if you
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.680]  study are the main funders in the left of tax you and says oh you're for the
[01:59.680 --> 02:03.720]  oil companies you're against the global tax no the oil companies Exxon mobile
[02:03.720 --> 02:07.400]  and and Shell the biggest funders they want to shut down coal because we've
[02:07.400 --> 02:12.400]  got all this clean coal with clean scrubbers they point cameras at smoke
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.120]  stacks and show water vapor coming out and tell the idiot public that it's
[02:16.120 --> 02:20.960]  soot it's all a complete lie because we got thousands of years of coal and they
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.760]  want to shut it off half our power comes from coal that's right and I'll tell
[02:25.760 --> 02:31.360]  you something else they're raising our power bills up here by the team of 15
[02:31.360 --> 02:36.640]  percent while idling the coal power plants to create an artificial scarcity
[02:36.640 --> 02:41.400]  same thing and Ron got caught in their own documents came out in court and I
[02:41.400 --> 02:44.560]  said this at the time they would shut power off for an hour a day to freak
[02:44.560 --> 02:49.320]  everybody out and their internal memos said by shutting off power it creates
[02:49.320 --> 02:52.680]  the perception it's not there and they're going to do it with water with
[02:52.680 --> 02:57.400]  energy they are going to rape us go ahead yeah yeah I mean I live in the Ohio
[02:57.400 --> 03:01.800]  Valley where most the coal goes down the river where we have all these coal
[03:01.800 --> 03:07.880]  power power plants and I'll watch them and they have run a lot and they keep
[03:07.880 --> 03:13.120]  increasing our power rates I've lived here for the last 10 years and my
[03:13.120 --> 03:17.480]  power bills have went up by about 300 folks that don't know what idling is if
[03:17.480 --> 03:22.000]  it's a cold day and you don't see water vapor shooting out of every smoke stack
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.560]  and you just barely it's hard to turn them off and on if you go through a
[03:26.560 --> 03:30.100]  whole procedure so they so when they switch off they still keep them
[03:30.100 --> 03:34.080]  heating a little bit you'll just see a little bit of vapor coming out that's
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.440]  right and there's something else I want to talk to you about as far as the
[03:38.440 --> 03:44.960]  climate bill goes I don't know if you saw it I read both the thousand page and
[03:44.960 --> 03:50.680]  the 300 page addendum that they made yes that they actually set up a regulatory
[03:50.680 --> 03:57.000]  body giving them the authority to provide permits for solar panels as if
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.480]  they own the sun no that's it sir sir yes I scanned the bill I went over the
[04:02.480 --> 04:06.800]  cheat sheets that showed the key sections it is worse than the Soviet Union
[04:06.800 --> 04:11.240]  and and Obama said remember two years ago he said I'm gonna quote shut down
[04:11.240 --> 04:17.760]  coal in America ladies and gentlemen 51% of our power comes from coal that's
[04:17.760 --> 04:22.920]  right that's right and I live in this state West Virginia is one of the
[04:22.920 --> 04:27.000]  poorest states in the country all right you won't believe the amount of
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.520]  unemployment up here all you've got coal mining and the power plants that
[04:30.520 --> 04:33.600]  supply how many states this West Virginia supply with power the
[04:33.600 --> 04:38.800]  surrounding five states yeah five or six yeah well we can't have that the UN
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.880]  and Maury strong he said at the 92 Rio de Janeiro summit he said our job is to
[04:43.880 --> 04:47.520]  destroy US industry and they've done it with naft and get now they're gonna shut
[04:47.520 --> 04:51.960]  our power off and grandma's gonna freeze the death but they don't care because
[04:51.960 --> 04:55.360]  they're a bunch of scum I appreciate your call we'll be right back ladies and
[04:55.360 --> 05:00.600]  gentlemen they mean business this is siege this is eugenics the illusion

[06:19.160 --> 06:29.960]  Alex Jones I've got a MSNBC article mom ordered to stop babysitting friends
[06:29.960 --> 06:33.800]  kids a few times a week for 30 40 minutes before they caught the school bus
[06:33.800 --> 06:38.160]  when it was cold outside she lets them inside to wait for school bus state
[06:38.160 --> 06:43.440]  calls it unlawful daycare you know growing up in Dallas Texas once or
[06:43.440 --> 06:47.320]  twice a week I'd go to my neighbor's house to eat breakfast I'd be I'd be
[06:47.320 --> 06:51.360]  invited over we'd wait when it was cold to run out the school bus my mom would
[06:51.360 --> 06:54.760]  have them over for breakfast this nice lady wasn't even doing that she's
[06:54.760 --> 06:58.480]  friends with the neighbors let the kids wait 10 15 20 minutes in the four-year
[06:58.480 --> 07:03.080]  of her house when it's cold in Michigan you're not allowed to do that anymore you
[07:03.080 --> 07:10.720]  don't have free association in America now here is a London Mirror story our UK
[07:10.720 --> 07:15.000]  children laws too strict it says you're not even allowed to talk to your
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.320]  neighbors kids you're not allowed to babysit them or have them come over in
[07:18.320 --> 07:22.040]  the morning before they get on the government training center bus now
[07:22.040 --> 07:27.520]  this dovetails with Obama saying he wants year-round school President Obama
[07:27.520 --> 07:33.760]  and year-round school school is forever Obama would curtail summer vacation
[07:33.760 --> 07:39.360]  that's associated press right here this is why he wants the televised
[07:39.360 --> 07:42.880]  announcements to the kids this is the federal government I've read their
[07:42.880 --> 07:46.240]  policy reports on air we've had the former head number two position
[07:46.240 --> 07:49.720]  Department of Education on Charlotte is or be let's set her back up about this
[07:49.720 --> 07:54.760]  they told her in the 80s that's why she left they said we're gonna take over the
[07:54.760 --> 07:58.880]  family through the school we're gonna outlaw the family now remember $15
[07:58.880 --> 08:04.000]  million fine the second time you have a garage sale that's unauthorized or you
[08:04.000 --> 08:14.560]  sell any recalled products the animal ID the premises ID government documents
[08:14.560 --> 08:18.440]  to be able to have a solar panel we just talked about that last segment let's go
[08:18.440 --> 08:25.000]  to her right now in Michigan Lisa Snyder in this 1984 world Lisa thank you for
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  joining us thank you for having me okay you've been on the national news but
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.240]  just sound bites you've got the floor for the next ten minutes or so tell
[08:32.240 --> 08:36.400]  folks what happened a breakdown what you're facing but but but first you
[08:36.400 --> 08:41.480]  just heard my breakdown of government taking over society were you aware of
[08:41.480 --> 08:46.480]  that angle no I was not what do you think of the statements I just made it
[08:46.480 --> 08:51.640]  stupid it's bad and yeah the government doesn't need to stick their nose
[08:51.640 --> 08:57.240]  where it doesn't belong absolutely okay tell us how this started how you
[08:57.240 --> 09:07.800]  became a 1984 criminal my law was 1973 the law that I they say I was breaking
[09:07.800 --> 09:12.200]  it's the act number 116 of 1973 but the point is they're now trying to enforce
[09:12.200 --> 09:18.720]  this similarly worldwide the CPS who tattled on you oh I mean break it down
[09:18.720 --> 09:26.520]  for us okay my house is a bus stop for the children of our neighborhood and my
[09:26.520 --> 09:32.080]  I have an older son and my friends have older children that now our youngest
[09:32.080 --> 09:35.640]  ones don't ride the bus anymore they all go together but now the older ones go
[09:35.640 --> 09:39.880]  off and the younger ones are left behind so my daughter did not want to get on the
[09:39.880 --> 09:43.480]  bus by herself so we just thought it was a great idea to get the kids together to
[09:43.480 --> 09:48.680]  get on the bus together so that they were they felt safe two of them are five
[09:48.680 --> 09:56.920]  two of them are seven of course you know they don't have they just feel scared so
[09:56.920 --> 10:03.280]  we plan this two days into it I received it was the letter that I received
[10:03.280 --> 10:08.000]  was September 11th but I didn't receive it until the following week that I was
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.760]  providing care for unrelated children in my home so I called the DHS and said I
[10:12.760 --> 10:17.560]  don't understand this I am not doing anything wrong there is a bus stop they
[10:17.560 --> 10:22.320]  do come in I just called outside if it's raining we live in Michigan the
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.000]  weather can be funny one minute and knowing the next and I said you know
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.600]  this you live in Michigan and she said I said what do you want me to do when
[10:30.600 --> 10:34.000]  it's raining outside and she told me to tell their parents to buy them an
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.840]  umbrella so they're now your god I mean they're now gonna tell you that you
[10:38.840 --> 10:43.480]  can't have neighbors kids wait in your front room when it's cold outside you
[10:43.480 --> 10:49.920]  these are our new Soviet minders I mean I want this to really hit people that the
[10:49.920 --> 10:54.120]  Amish are having their kids taken they're not letting people sell eggs and
[10:54.120 --> 10:57.160]  watermelons on the side of the highway anymore across the country they're
[10:57.160 --> 11:02.120]  swat teaming them having undercovers come by watermelons and then swat team
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.040]  them I mean I mean the government has run out of real criminals to feed on
[11:07.040 --> 11:13.040]  we're now dinner so so what happened next so I just kept talking to her and
[11:13.040 --> 11:16.240]  saying okay can they at least stand in my garage no because the garage is a
[11:16.240 --> 11:22.120]  part of the house I came and do that so I just got really angry and I told her
[11:22.120 --> 11:25.760]  that I had to stop talking because you I mean what she was saying did not make
[11:25.760 --> 11:30.920]  sense so then my friend wrote to Brian Cali and he jumped aboard immediately and
[11:30.920 --> 11:39.880]  said this is ridiculous it's such a broad law that it doesn't it's there's
[11:39.880 --> 11:46.640]  such a broad spectrum that it needs to be you know you need to have facts there's
[11:46.640 --> 11:51.240]  no facts in this law you I mean it can be for babysitting it can be for a
[11:51.240 --> 11:55.920]  play date my daughter has a little girl over I was told that I need to ask her
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.520]  parents if they go out to dinner if they're going out to dinner or to a
[12:00.520 --> 12:04.400]  movie or whatever that is considered a care but if they go home then it's okay
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.400]  I'm like I'm not gonna ask that that's retarded no ma'am come on you've got to
[12:08.400 --> 12:13.800]  ask permission if you take your daughter and her little friend to McDonald's to
[12:13.800 --> 12:18.880]  have a happy meal look are you al-Qaeda or something I mean airport security
[12:18.880 --> 12:23.440]  America is now secure they want to put metal detectors in shopping malls you
[12:23.440 --> 12:28.040]  need that you need to ask CPS permission to go have a hamburger yeah well no I
[12:28.040 --> 12:32.960]  have to ask them to have my my kids have played eight because they that's
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.360]  freedom is ma'am ma'am ma'am the veterans fought and died so that you wouldn't
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.640]  have permission to take the neighbor's child for hamburger you've got to get
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.280]  government permission not the parents but see I'm gonna stop being sarcastic
[12:46.280 --> 12:52.080]  so so so you've got a state rep involved trying to pass a law because they've
[12:52.080 --> 12:55.560]  passed a previous law they're now implementing saying you can't have a
[12:55.560 --> 12:59.160]  play date with the neighbors yeah well and then the governor is on board too
[12:59.160 --> 13:03.960]  because she did not know I guess you must not realize that this is going on and
[13:03.960 --> 13:09.240]  now she has jumped aboard and wants this taken care of immediately because it is
[13:09.240 --> 13:14.440]  ridiculous it's the dumbest ball that's out there we as Americans live in the
[13:14.440 --> 13:21.640]  free world we should be able to choose who watches our children we should be
[13:21.640 --> 13:27.320]  able to do what we want but ma'am ma'am they built giant CPS centers they've
[13:27.320 --> 13:31.200]  built giant detention centers we've got more prisoners anybody in the world
[13:31.200 --> 13:35.760]  they've got they're only building more we've they've got to criminalize us do
[13:35.760 --> 13:41.640]  understand that's our new economy yeah no so I mean it doesn't matter if you're
[13:41.640 --> 13:44.800]  a good mother when it's freezing cold and gets below zero trying to let
[13:44.800 --> 13:48.240]  neighborhood kids duck in for a few minutes you're not allowed what you
[13:48.240 --> 13:56.400]  think this is America or something yeah so what is the slimy CPS doing did you
[13:56.400 --> 14:04.480]  find out who reported you the Bureau of Family Destruction I did not know I mean
[14:04.480 --> 14:13.520]  have you asked the ma'am did you know how CPS was set up do I know well let me
[14:13.520 --> 14:16.120]  just tell you because you're you're influential you're talking a lot of
[14:16.120 --> 14:21.160]  folks family court was set up to carry out eugenics the sterilization you know
[14:21.160 --> 14:26.200]  Hitler got his eugenics from us I made a film about it called in game and so
[14:26.200 --> 14:29.640]  that's why these family courts are outside of the regular courts and do
[14:29.640 --> 14:34.560]  process and that's why their agents can get away with all this because 80 90
[14:34.560 --> 14:39.480]  years ago or even in the 30s 75 80 years ago these were the people that would
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.560]  come grab your you and your kid and go sterilize you had you ever heard about
[14:43.560 --> 14:47.800]  that no I haven't well listen I know that sounds crazy but if you just Google
[14:47.800 --> 14:54.040]  endgame eugenics you can watch the actual government film clips where they
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.000]  had the movie reels teaching parents that this was okay so we have this
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.360]  vestigial you know leftover hitlerian system well let me here here's an
[15:04.360 --> 15:11.720]  example for you how was there even a spine network to know that you had
[15:11.720 --> 15:16.160]  neighbor kids over before they caught the bus I have no idea I mean does that
[15:16.160 --> 15:23.600]  sound like Nazi Germany well no I just didn't know the neighbor that I guess
[15:23.600 --> 15:28.480]  that we don't know which neighbor but I just think that someone must be very
[15:28.480 --> 15:32.920]  unhappy or I don't know thought that they would get I don't know what they
[15:32.920 --> 15:40.480]  thought actually it's just a sad sad situation I mean the government is
[15:40.480 --> 15:43.760]  saying they own us a little let me say bye to you during the break we really
[15:43.760 --> 15:48.520]  appreciate you joining us an amazing lady standing up to big brother most
[15:48.520 --> 15:52.640]  people submit they're telling people here in Austin they can't have neighbors
[15:52.640 --> 15:56.520]  of that's right we're all prisoners
[15:59.320 --> 16:03.600]  hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this
[16:03.600 --> 16:07.200]  question do you really know what's in your tap water in a recent study
[16:07.200 --> 16:11.560]  conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that over 260
[16:11.560 --> 16:15.320]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these
[16:15.320 --> 16:19.200]  chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental

[20:36.440 --> 20:44.600]  champion goalie and he's an icon of getting people to expand their awareness
[20:44.600 --> 20:48.480]  to expand their horizons to question little bubbles that the social
[20:48.480 --> 20:53.440]  engineers the mind controllers try to keep us in he is David I now he's gonna
[20:53.440 --> 20:58.200]  be on with us for a full hour maybe even a little bit longer next Monday he's on
[20:58.200 --> 21:03.120]  a tour in the US but I wanted to get him on today for just 30 minutes to talk
[21:03.120 --> 21:07.160]  about the plunging dollar the bringing in of the global currency which is going
[21:07.160 --> 21:14.040]  to be an SDR bank-to-bank that he wrote about more than 12 years ago what Obama
[21:14.040 --> 21:17.080]  is doing what he's bringing in how they announced the internet's being turned
[21:17.080 --> 21:22.320]  over to a private global corporation the dollar's being shut down Obama's now
[21:22.320 --> 21:26.480]  the head of the United Nations Security Council the real body with power all
[21:26.480 --> 21:33.080]  these things are happening and the the great change is upon us as they expand
[21:33.080 --> 21:37.440]  the tyranny but in the middle of the darkness the awakening is exponential
[21:37.440 --> 21:40.760]  I'm seeing that everyone I talked to seeing it but David Ike seeing it around
[21:40.760 --> 21:47.400]  the world and a real focal point of this and do we saluting David Ike thank
[21:47.400 --> 21:51.560]  you for coming on it's about it okay this is a quick segment you've got the
[21:51.560 --> 21:55.480]  floor I would imagine you'd like to talk about the dollar first then we'll get
[21:55.480 --> 22:00.600]  into the larger clash of the Titans the clash of liberty and tyranny that we're
[22:00.600 --> 22:04.360]  beginning to see happen yeah well the crash of the dollar has been planned
[22:04.360 --> 22:09.080]  for a long long long time it's all part of what I've been talking about for many
[22:09.080 --> 22:14.600]  many years which is how they're using America to destroy America the idea was
[22:14.600 --> 22:21.720]  for America to be pulled into overseas wars that that that stretches them
[22:21.720 --> 22:27.680]  militarily stretches them financially crash the economy because if you're a
[22:27.680 --> 22:32.520]  superpower and you have the military and financial might to say no to a world
[22:32.520 --> 22:37.560]  government then the world government's not a tyranny across the world it wants
[22:37.560 --> 22:44.080]  every single country subjugated therefore any superpower with financial and
[22:44.080 --> 22:49.640]  military might to stand alone or stand its ground has to go and this is what
[22:49.640 --> 22:54.440]  we're seeing we're seeing the the use of America to destroy America in one way
[22:54.440 --> 23:00.960]  America is being used in terms of its military to expand the agenda of conquest
[23:00.960 --> 23:06.440]  and control but at the same time it's being destroyed in the process and we're
[23:06.440 --> 23:11.000]  now seeing countries that have been reports in the British media this week
[23:11.000 --> 23:17.360]  like China and Japan and Russia and even the the Arab countries starting to
[23:17.360 --> 23:23.280]  really move towards disconnecting the dollar from being the oil currency and
[23:23.280 --> 23:28.200]  the reserve currency and you know the American economy like the British one
[23:28.200 --> 23:33.320]  actually is it reminds me of you know in those cartoons when there's a chase
[23:33.320 --> 23:38.560]  going on and eventually all the people in the chase run over the edge of the
[23:38.560 --> 23:42.360]  cliff and for a while they keep running because they don't realize they've run
[23:42.360 --> 23:47.000]  out of land and then someone looks down realizes the land is gone and then that
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.320]  you know awareness just that they all fall and crash down into the into the
[23:51.320 --> 23:56.960]  ravine and and if if people just looked at what the British and the American
[23:56.960 --> 24:04.800]  economy are standing on at this time it's fresh air it's simple illusion if
[24:04.800 --> 24:09.600]  there's nothing there that's holding it together and I've been saying Alex in
[24:09.600 --> 24:12.960]  September when they they crashed it first of all that there's a three-stage
[24:12.960 --> 24:17.720]  process here recap David the controlled implosion of the dollar that you've been
[24:17.720 --> 24:21.680]  writing about for over a decade the globalist have bragged that to make
[24:21.680 --> 24:25.880]  way for world government and I hear a brag about this on NPR that we can't
[24:25.880 --> 24:29.680]  have a high standard of living that that hurts the environment to have more than
[24:29.680 --> 24:35.640]  one child our carbon footprint babies are bad and at the UN climate summit in
[24:35.640 --> 24:41.920]  92 morey strong said we must destroy industrial society so they always said
[24:41.920 --> 24:46.520]  they wanted to have a fiat banking system get everybody so in debt that
[24:46.520 --> 24:49.720]  there's more debt than there is real tangible assets in the world and now
[24:49.720 --> 24:54.200]  they've got conservatively according to economists we've had on between 500 and
[24:54.200 --> 24:59.480]  a thousand times more fiat debt they've made that the banks used to buy things
[24:59.480 --> 25:04.440]  than there are real assets in all the world at their highest value so this is
[25:04.440 --> 25:10.720]  a complete fraud a total Ponzi scheme and in here's AFP agency French press US
[25:10.720 --> 25:14.880]  economic decline forges new world order hundreds of other headlines about how
[25:14.880 --> 25:19.120]  good the new world order is how America is now going to get it how the Arabs and
[25:19.120 --> 25:22.760]  Russian China are teaming up but meanwhile the same central banks that
[25:22.760 --> 25:27.480]  own them the global controllers they're orchestrating all this so David break
[25:27.480 --> 25:31.560]  down the three phases you talk about starting last year with the controlled
[25:31.560 --> 25:37.160]  banking implosion stealing the 23.7 trillion saying that it was going into
[25:37.160 --> 25:41.360]  the secret coffers never spending it on the mortgages and now where we're going
[25:41.360 --> 25:46.640]  from here yeah well I can say it's planned to be in three stages and they're
[25:46.640 --> 25:51.800]  becoming you know blatant to crash the economy in September 2009 so that
[25:51.800 --> 25:55.920]  everyone sees there's a problem and it's a problem to address so the way they
[25:55.920 --> 26:02.040]  address it is stage two which is hosing brilliant staggering amounts of credit
[26:02.040 --> 26:07.880]  money fiat money at the cause of the problem the banks the idea being and of
[26:07.880 --> 26:11.760]  course after the Federal Reserve and they'll confirm it's gone into a black
[26:11.760 --> 26:17.360]  hole and no one knows where it's gone that's the idea and and phase two is
[26:17.360 --> 26:20.720]  about emptying the barrels of governments emptying the pockets of
[26:20.720 --> 26:24.480]  government bringing an end to the credit lines of government so they have no
[26:24.480 --> 26:31.880]  further maneuver of response to what is coming in stage three and that is to
[26:31.880 --> 26:37.800]  crash the economy on a scale that you know make September 2008
[26:37.800 --> 26:41.400]  look like it look like a tea party and the figures you're talking about Alex
[26:41.400 --> 26:47.280]  in terms of the the fresh air money in relation to real resources that's the
[26:47.280 --> 26:52.680]  enormous staggering bubble that they're going to use to to to cause stage three
[26:52.680 --> 26:59.080]  and crash stage three and the idea is to destroy America militarily and
[26:59.080 --> 27:05.360]  financially so that it is subjugated it comes down to its knees and then it has
[27:05.360 --> 27:10.760]  to go cap in hand with the beggar bowl to people like China and these other
[27:10.760 --> 27:15.520]  countries that are conspiring now to bring an end to America as we know it
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.640]  so that and then they will do what they're told so there will be absorbed
[27:20.640 --> 27:25.400]  into the world system and and absorbed into the North American Union absorbed
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.840]  into a new currency this is all part of it because it's simple if something's
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.440]  working you ain't gonna justify changing it if you want to change something you've
[27:34.440 --> 27:38.240]  got to destroy it you've got to make sure it's not working so you open people's
[27:38.240 --> 27:42.240]  minds to accepting hey we've got no choice that's what it's all about and
[27:42.240 --> 27:51.080]  we you know when Britain declared war on Germany in 1939 there was eight months
[27:51.080 --> 27:56.160]  when nothing happened it became known to history as the phony war well the phony
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.920]  war in terms of this conspiracy is over we're now at a point where we're gonna
[28:01.920 --> 28:05.960]  need to start engaging this and with swine flu and the economy and all that
[28:05.960 --> 28:10.000]  all the rest of it even let's go over that the idea is to throw everything at
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.520]  us in a short period of time short period of years to bring about this
[28:14.520 --> 28:20.120]  global change very quickly because humanity is just exhausted fright and
[28:20.120 --> 28:24.840]  terrified do something do something and that's the idea that's why we must stay
[28:24.840 --> 28:30.640]  strong and we must not be subjugated by this but then not fall to fear and give
[28:30.640 --> 28:35.920]  our power away as a result stage 2 is to empty the barrels of government in
[28:35.920 --> 28:41.080]  terms of having any response to the economic situation that they're facing
[28:41.080 --> 28:46.880]  in other words empty their pockets and their credit lines and then stage 3 which
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.680]  is waiting in the wings and that's to crash the economy in it on an even
[28:50.680 --> 28:56.160]  bigger scale than in September 2008 at which point there's no response from
[28:56.160 --> 29:00.640]  governments because they have no response about David I stay there hello

[32:37.080 --> 32:41.640]  fight for your freedom and your life how much will you need we don't know how
[32:41.640 --> 32:45.880]  much do you want all you can get I'm Alex Jones I want all of you good guys
[32:45.880 --> 32:52.920]  to live to fight another day call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web
[32:52.920 --> 33:02.520]  at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633 coast to coast and in
[33:02.520 --> 33:09.400]  your face you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[33:19.160 --> 33:23.800]  well David I want you to walk through that step by step and I totally agree
[33:23.800 --> 33:27.440]  with you in the time we have left with you today but I want to go back and just
[33:27.440 --> 33:32.480]  point out you eloquently laid out what's happening but this is not your
[33:32.480 --> 33:37.440]  opinion this is all an IMF World Bank documents it's openly stated we told
[33:37.440 --> 33:42.240]  people at the time that they would steal the tens of trillions hoard it use it
[33:42.240 --> 33:47.240]  to buy up the economy that they were vertically integrating they cut off
[33:47.240 --> 33:50.680]  credit then they hoard the money then they go out and buy everything up for
[33:50.680 --> 33:54.280]  pennies on the dollar that's why they say it's the new economy where you're
[33:54.280 --> 33:59.400]  homeless or don't have a job or take a cut and pay it's the jobless recovery
[33:59.400 --> 34:04.920]  because everything is gauged by the fiat money changers consolidating global
[34:04.920 --> 34:08.760]  power but that's only part of it demonizing the US and England's name
[34:08.760 --> 34:15.120]  worldwide with wars putting our troops under UN control DHS reports demonizing
[34:15.120 --> 34:18.560]  gun owners conservatives those that don't like the new world order or want to end
[34:18.560 --> 34:23.920]  the feds suddenly they have stasi TV ads spy on your neighbor suddenly they've
[34:23.920 --> 34:28.360]  enlisted a gotten the girl scouts to spy suddenly the boy scouts I mean
[34:28.360 --> 34:33.920]  everything as you said is a quickening it has gone a quantum level leap into
[34:33.920 --> 34:39.800]  into malice level hell they are definitely launching their operations so
[34:39.800 --> 34:43.680]  go through that go through the flu go through what David Ike sees happening but
[34:43.680 --> 34:48.960]  also as as the tyranny comes in like a flood liberty is coming in the mass
[34:48.960 --> 34:55.000]  awakening you're witnessing the thing is that it's a simple equation the more
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.680]  you centralize power the more power you have to centralize even quicker and
[34:59.680 --> 35:03.440]  that's why the process of centralization has got faster and faster and faster
[35:03.440 --> 35:07.120]  through the 20th century eventually reached the point where it was so
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.360]  blatant it was given a name globalization and that's gone on and on and on and as
[35:11.360 --> 35:14.920]  more and more power has been centralized it's had the power to centralize
[35:14.920 --> 35:18.320]  quicker so the whole thing is getting faster and faster and the other thing I
[35:18.320 --> 35:21.960]  mean we've only got half an hour today Alex but you know it's it's something
[35:21.960 --> 35:26.320]  that I I've been writing about and I'm getting much much deeper and more
[35:26.320 --> 35:31.720]  understanding about as the days pass now you know when people look at the speed
[35:31.720 --> 35:36.120]  and all those things you absolutely rightly detail there you look at the
[35:36.120 --> 35:39.400]  speed in which all this is coming in in all these different areas of our lives
[35:39.400 --> 35:44.200]  in all the different fine detail of our lives it's coming in in a coordinated
[35:44.200 --> 35:48.680]  way to a coordinated timescale this is not people sitting around a table saying
[35:48.680 --> 35:52.320]  what's on this move guys this is this is much deeper the rabbit hole is much
[35:52.320 --> 35:57.640]  deeper than this and it's in finding the source if you like of the rabbit hole
[35:57.640 --> 36:01.200]  that's what's going to bring the system down and we're gonna do that the next
[36:01.200 --> 36:08.760]  few years no question it is coming down David I want you to get into that kind
[36:08.760 --> 36:11.600]  of a brief overview we'll cover it more on Monday and talk about your new book
[36:11.600 --> 36:17.800]  and some of the events coming up but a point you just made about how this is
[36:17.800 --> 36:23.120]  coordinated they are banning homeschooling in Australia England the
[36:23.120 --> 36:29.920]  US or attempting to simultaneously with the same PR with the word-for-word same
[36:29.920 --> 36:34.600]  scripts and I see it in the local news they are banning neighbors including
[36:34.600 --> 36:39.400]  police officers keeping each other's children period they are banning garage
[36:39.400 --> 36:44.640]  sales they are banning people selling corner fruit stands in the countryside
[36:44.640 --> 36:50.960]  simultaneously worldwide it is all admittedly coordinated by this private
[36:50.960 --> 36:55.880]  corporate board break that down and what is the end game how does the flu tie
[36:55.880 --> 37:01.400]  into it well the way they can do this Alex is a simple structure it has to be
[37:01.400 --> 37:04.400]  simple it looks complex we know what it's all happening as you're talking
[37:04.400 --> 37:08.600]  about it now it looks complex how do they do this but actually it's a very
[37:08.600 --> 37:13.040]  simple structure it's it's like a transnational corporation you've got
[37:13.040 --> 37:17.160]  their headquarters which is overwhelmingly in Europe and then you've
[37:17.160 --> 37:23.600]  got the subsidiary companies in of the headquarters in each country instead of
[37:23.600 --> 37:28.560]  corporations or that part of it of course it's secret society networks so
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.440]  you've got a global secret society network with with a spider at the
[37:32.440 --> 37:36.600]  center overwhelmingly at operational level in old Europe and then in each
[37:36.600 --> 37:42.400]  country like United States you have a subsidiary network of secret societies
[37:42.400 --> 37:47.560]  controlled by the bloodline families and their job is to introduce the
[37:47.560 --> 37:52.640]  centrally dictated global agenda in their sphere of influence by controlling
[37:52.640 --> 38:00.320]  back countries banking media ownership the corporations the cartels etc and so
[38:00.320 --> 38:05.200]  this is how they can do it globally as you rightly described in this
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.680]  coordination it's because in each country these subsidiary networks of secret
[38:09.680 --> 38:14.960]  societies are introducing the centrally dictated agenda so of course because
[38:14.960 --> 38:19.200]  they're all doing it it's happening in every country at the same time this is
[38:19.200 --> 38:24.760]  this is how it's possible and the idea is to to subjugate humanity on it on a
[38:24.760 --> 38:29.920]  scale that would make all world wins and there's one area Alex that really does
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.880]  need a lot of focus on because I've been seeing so much around the world at
[38:34.880 --> 38:40.560]  different aspects of this and that's how the state is after our children you
[38:40.560 --> 38:45.400]  know when you look at Aldous Huxley a member of the Fabian Society one of
[38:45.400 --> 38:49.800]  these strands in the web a major one actually it is book Brave New World he
[38:49.800 --> 38:55.480]  was talking about hatcheries public state hatcheries to produce the children
[38:55.480 --> 39:01.680]  and the children were parted from their parents what you're seeing is change
[39:01.680 --> 39:05.880]  after change after change what I call the totalitarian tiptoe step by step by
[39:05.880 --> 39:10.080]  step which is giving the state more and more control and influence over our
[39:10.080 --> 39:14.480]  children and taking it more and more away from our parents so when Obama came
[39:14.480 --> 39:20.400]  out outrageously in the last week or so and called for children to spend more
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.480]  time at school at school holidays to be short etc because we have to do this for
[39:24.480 --> 39:28.560]  America no no mr. Obama you have to do this for the agenda of the masters that
[39:28.560 --> 39:33.360]  you dance to the tune of because it's about taking more time away from
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.840]  children with their parents taking away more parental influence more
[39:37.840 --> 39:43.760]  individuality influence so the state all-encompassing blob mind program can
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.880]  get more access to their minds for longer that is why in Britain I'm sure
[39:47.880 --> 39:51.440]  it's happening in America too I'm sure you'll confirm this but in Britain we're
[39:51.440 --> 39:57.000]  having children taken away from their parents by social services back to know
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.240]  it's happening in America so I've done some research recently on it for the
[40:00.240 --> 40:06.680]  most extraordinary reasons for instance we've had a couple they spent 38,000
[40:06.680 --> 40:11.680]  pounds on fertility treatment to have a child when the social services came
[40:11.680 --> 40:16.680]  round after child was born to just a very very small baby the mother joked that
[40:16.680 --> 40:21.680]  the birth had ruined her figure just to laugh they took her children away and
[40:21.680 --> 40:25.320]  they're still taking her children away and then what the social services say is
[40:25.320 --> 40:31.800]  if you want to see your children at all like once a month or so then you must
[40:31.800 --> 40:35.760]  not challenge our decision otherwise you never gonna see them again
[40:35.760 --> 40:41.560]  kind of here and there one time in a million it's becoming more and more
[40:41.560 --> 40:49.960]  constant more and more common and it is all scientifically I've had Charlotte
[40:49.960 --> 40:53.240]  is a be the former head of the Department of Education policy that was the plan
[40:53.240 --> 40:58.520]  in the 80s in the family it's all on record that's what they say in
[40:58.520 --> 41:02.880]  eco science in the family raise everybody in dormitories sterilizes through
[41:02.880 --> 41:09.160]  the water supply through the vaccines and yes simultaneously now if you yell at
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.480]  your child don't run out the road that's abuse they take your children no
[41:13.480 --> 41:17.840]  judge no jury no due process yeah and we know the family courts were set up as
[41:17.840 --> 41:23.920]  eugenics courts in England Germany and the US absolutely they're now saying you
[41:23.920 --> 41:27.640]  can't babysit your neighbor's kids you can't talk to your neighbor's kids
[41:27.640 --> 41:31.160]  unless you have a government license and I talked to people that live in
[41:31.160 --> 41:33.640]  England it's happened to me when I've been there they come up to you and ask
[41:33.640 --> 41:37.400]  why are you walking your dog are you a criminal and and so everyone's being
[41:37.400 --> 41:41.760]  trained to answer questions the secret police are everywhere and now in in
[41:41.760 --> 41:46.320]  Europe England and the US they go into the schools and I saw this in Belling's
[41:46.320 --> 41:50.760]  Montana when I was there last week at the hotel a whole hotel full of girl
[41:50.760 --> 41:55.360]  scouts being trained by Homeland Security to spy I wasn't reading this in
[41:55.360 --> 42:00.200]  the AP it was in the news I was witnessing it without even looking
[42:00.200 --> 42:06.560]  David give us in the last minute we've got David where you're speaking and what

[47:29.600 --> 47:34.880]  tumbles on report of its demise you're in Paris you've got some inside info max

[47:39.720 --> 47:47.000]  now well you know alex robert fist had a great story in the independent in the
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.480]  uk this week and he was talking about the oil producing nations in the world
[47:52.480 --> 47:59.000]  they want to get out of pricing oil and dollars they want to start pricing oil
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.160]  in a new currency a basket of currencies anything but the dollar because the
[48:05.160 --> 48:11.320]  dollar is gives the u.s. the really unfair advantage in the world markets
[48:11.320 --> 48:15.920]  because it any country that wants to buy oil they first have to buy dollars
[48:15.920 --> 48:20.360]  because oil only trade in dollars and this is a very unfair advantage that
[48:20.360 --> 48:26.280]  him the that the u.s. has and what these countries are noticing countries like
[48:26.280 --> 48:32.400]  china russia iran is that the u.s. is using the profits that they're making
[48:32.400 --> 48:38.520]  from this monopoly pricing power of the dollar and the and the price of oil and
[48:38.520 --> 48:42.840]  what's called senior age which is they basically get a commission on all the
[48:42.840 --> 48:48.260]  dollars that they're producing they're using the profits to you know from their
[48:48.260 --> 48:52.960]  wars to fund the pentagon to fund the invasion of iraq or the invasion of
[48:52.960 --> 48:57.520]  afghanistan or now you know looks like the invasion of iran and the thing
[48:57.520 --> 49:03.240]  about iran is that iran and china signed china signed eight billion dollar deal
[49:03.240 --> 49:11.520]  for oil with iran so china is thinking even though they are heavily connected
[49:11.520 --> 49:17.120]  to the dollar and their economy has grown as the results of tying their
[49:17.120 --> 49:21.520]  currency to the dollar they're thinking that now it's time to divorce
[49:21.520 --> 49:26.880]  themselves from the dollar it's time to kick america to the curb and it's time
[49:26.880 --> 49:31.960]  for these other countries to stretch their wings and take over in terms of
[49:31.960 --> 49:35.880]  the the new superpowers and they're there again and i've been a robert's
[49:35.880 --> 49:40.080]  fist basically makes that point and is in his independent article and i can
[49:40.080 --> 49:43.760]  confirm pretty much what he's been saying because it's the same thing i'm
[49:43.760 --> 49:48.600]  hearing here in paris and my contacts in the mid-east and in fact a new currency
[49:48.600 --> 49:52.200]  is being formulated a new basket of a new currency that'll be represented by
[49:52.200 --> 49:56.200]  basket of currencies the only couple of things a robert's fist mentioned that i
[49:56.200 --> 50:02.200]  would add is that he mentioned that gold would be one of the components of the
[50:02.200 --> 50:06.600]  the new currency but what i'm hearing is that gold could represent as much as
[50:06.600 --> 50:11.600]  fifty percent of the basket in the new currency and this is what's driving gold
[50:11.600 --> 50:17.880]  higher now because banks and you know central banks have stopped selling their
[50:17.880 --> 50:22.640]  gold max i want to hear your inside info you you handed it that yesterday on
[50:22.640 --> 50:26.280]  international television i'd like you to because i know you don't make stuff up
[50:26.280 --> 50:30.920]  give us entree into your inside info we'd really appreciate it all all those
[50:30.920 --> 50:33.720]  investors and people out there that want to know what's happening because you
[50:33.720 --> 50:39.520]  are there in that major crossroads of paris but before we get to that you know
[50:39.520 --> 50:43.520]  there's something larger going on here i read club of rome and un documents and
[50:43.520 --> 50:47.840]  rocket filler documents fifteen years ago that they've written years before
[50:47.840 --> 50:53.640]  that you know twenty years ago that they plan to use the u.s. uses a military to
[50:53.640 --> 50:57.960]  set up world government then blame everything on us implode the dollar and
[50:57.960 --> 51:02.360]  bring in a new bank to bank currency and then have regional currencies they
[51:02.360 --> 51:06.240]  don't have one global currency that they manipulate and play the markets on a
[51:06.240 --> 51:10.760]  global scale so there's nowhere to run nowhere to hide and that now russia and
[51:10.760 --> 51:15.520]  china are basically owned and controlled by these interests and that the u.s. is
[51:15.520 --> 51:19.760]  just having all the debt piled on it and that they're preparing to kind of seal
[51:19.760 --> 51:26.360]  the deal or swap spit or become blood brothers by by torching the u.s. in a
[51:26.360 --> 51:30.720]  third world them and so that and so that china and russia in the middle east
[51:30.720 --> 51:34.840]  shouldn't be celebrating so much sure the u.s. is the drunk husband that comes
[51:34.840 --> 51:39.280]  on it you know every night in cold coxham but but they're getting out of
[51:39.280 --> 51:44.200]  that with the u.s. and getting in bed with the lzbott well i mean break it
[51:44.200 --> 51:49.680]  down very simply it's it's very simple to to put it in the following terms
[51:49.680 --> 51:54.240]  seventy five percent of all the transactions in the world take place in
[51:54.240 --> 51:59.720]  u.s. dollars it is the world's reserve currency and that's the way spent in the
[51:59.720 --> 52:04.880]  end of world war two and it is the basis of america's hegemony around the world
[52:04.880 --> 52:10.000]  and it's been america's a soft empire as well as a hard empire i mean they have
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.440]  of course their embassies and they have their facilities all over the world but
[52:15.440 --> 52:19.880]  the dollar has really been the means by which they have it in their major
[52:19.880 --> 52:25.400]  influence around the world and you know what these what these countries like
[52:25.400 --> 52:29.600]  russia and china in iran of course signed the shanghai cooperative
[52:29.600 --> 52:34.160]  organization the sco if you look that up on google you'll find out all about it
[52:34.160 --> 52:39.800]  they have a mutual defense pact if america hit the ran the china and russia
[52:39.800 --> 52:45.720]  have pledged to side with iran and strike back basically so it's just
[52:45.720 --> 52:49.880]  economics china has a deal with iran for eight billion in oil and america seems
[52:49.880 --> 52:56.000]  addicted to war to feed their machine you know last year 2008 alex the u.s.
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.600]  collected about two and a half trillion in taxes and one hundred percent of that
[53:00.600 --> 53:06.120]  money went to two places bailouts on wall street and the defense contractors
[53:06.120 --> 53:10.680]  that's an incredible statistic a hundred percent of all income tax collected
[53:10.680 --> 53:14.880]  last year two and a half trillion went to either bailouts or military there's no
[53:14.880 --> 53:19.960]  money going anywhere else and uh... you know this is just setting up the the
[53:19.960 --> 53:25.160]  dollar as really uh... the the leper with the most fingers you know it
[53:25.160 --> 53:29.040]  it or i should say it's uh... the leper with the least fingers it's it's a
[53:29.040 --> 53:34.480]  currency that nobody wants anymore and they're putting in place these other
[53:34.480 --> 53:38.520]  uh... currencies and they're looking at gold because gold is the only way that
[53:38.520 --> 53:43.280]  they can have any accountability and that they can have any way of hoping to
[53:43.280 --> 53:48.000]  escape all of the that might serve their wall street and not being shy
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.480]  stood by the money changers that are always creating tens of trillions in
[53:51.480 --> 53:55.840]  fiat money and using it as weapons economic and military weapons against
[53:55.840 --> 54:00.400]  them now the the vampires of central banking the best the dirtiest route of
[54:00.400 --> 54:03.000]  europe in the u.s. obviously
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.160]  china and other people play their games the arabs of their own system of
[54:06.160 --> 54:07.920]  bay they don't allow the usury
[54:07.920 --> 54:11.000]  we're up to thirty percent loan sharking rates here in the u.s. now
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.480]  with the credit card population so much so that people are taking the habit
[54:14.480 --> 54:18.720]  going to debit cards debit cards for visa this week finally passed more more
[54:18.720 --> 54:22.600]  use than credit card so that's something healthy out of all this but but but
[54:22.600 --> 54:27.240]  will the goldman sacks vampires just move on after they've eaten the bones
[54:27.240 --> 54:31.720]  off of the united states or are they dependent i mean is this their
[54:31.720 --> 54:35.960]  transylvanian earth is england israel the united states
[54:35.960 --> 54:38.120]  germany france is that
[54:38.120 --> 54:42.200]  is that count dracula's earth that he can go anywhere but he's got a whole
[54:42.200 --> 54:46.360]  those caskets around i mean is there any way to kill the vampire
[54:46.360 --> 54:49.800]  with a silver spike
[54:49.800 --> 54:54.600]  a spike made of silver in other words the thing that goldman sacks and these
[54:54.600 --> 54:58.760]  guys on the wall street hate is uh... gold and silver because
[54:58.760 --> 55:01.640]  it is the opposite of a fiat money system
[55:01.640 --> 55:04.680]  you know i've told people for years now if they want to kill
[55:04.680 --> 55:07.800]  goldman sacks better than a hammer as you might say
[55:07.800 --> 55:11.320]  if everyone bought one ounce of gold bullion and the price
[55:11.320 --> 55:15.560]  traded immediately up to its inflation adjusted normal price of two thousand
[55:15.560 --> 55:17.800]  dollars an ounce they would remove
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.960]  ninety percent of goldman sacks and jp morgan's ability to spin cotton candy
[55:21.960 --> 55:22.920]  derivatives
[55:22.920 --> 55:26.040]  out of uh... you know pulling it out of their their backsides
[55:26.040 --> 55:29.880]  and claiming that this has some validity in the market
[55:29.880 --> 55:33.000]  and that's why that they just hate gold and that's why they've done everything
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.440]  since melvin freeman and alan greyspan and ben Bernanke and tim
[55:36.440 --> 55:40.760]  geithner all their rhetoric all their white papers all their doctoral
[55:40.760 --> 55:44.920]  dissertations have all been about the greatness of fiat currency and fractional
[55:44.920 --> 55:47.240]  reserve banking and why gold is dead
[55:47.240 --> 55:49.080]  now what's happening now let me get into this
[55:49.080 --> 55:51.480]  what's happening is that these countries that are gold
[55:51.480 --> 55:54.840]  that are petroleum exporters are saying enough is enough
[55:54.840 --> 55:58.760]  we don't care what the what the uh... risks are at this point because we're sick
[55:58.760 --> 56:02.280]  of america's wars we're sick of all the market manipulation
[56:02.280 --> 56:05.640]  we're sick of golden sacks manipulating the chrome x and the nine x
[56:05.640 --> 56:08.600]  we're just going to introduce our own basket our own currency we're going to
[56:08.600 --> 56:12.840]  put gold in there it'll be the first gold back security uh... currency
[56:12.840 --> 56:17.800]  since 1971 when the u.s. dollar still had some tenuous connection to gold
[56:17.800 --> 56:21.480]  but there really hasn't been a gold but max the last time they did that
[56:21.480 --> 56:25.160]  the globalist blew the hell out of iraq shang that wmd's
[56:25.160 --> 56:27.880]  now the arabs are getting ready to do it again and notice
[56:27.880 --> 56:32.840]  they found secret reactors that the easter bunny laid
[56:32.840 --> 56:37.480]  well yeah of course you know uh... iraq said that they wanted to start trading
[56:37.480 --> 56:41.560]  oil in euros and the next thing you know we're shocking off
[56:41.560 --> 56:45.000]  and then uh... iran started saying we want to trade
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.360]  our oil in uh... euros and suddenly you know the game was moved over to
[56:50.360 --> 56:54.600]  to iran but but here's what i'm hearing and this is kind of the interesting
[56:54.600 --> 56:58.600]  story if you will you know stacey herbert and i made a really interesting
[56:58.600 --> 57:02.920]  film a couple years ago about gold and we interviewed folks over at the
[57:02.920 --> 57:06.440]  bundesbank in germany and at that time
[57:06.440 --> 57:11.640]  uh... it was we we it was revealed to us anyway that uh... there are three thousand
[57:11.640 --> 57:16.920]  tons of gold much of it was held outside of germany and held in fact in the
[57:16.920 --> 57:20.440]  united states and what i'm hearing now alex is that germany
[57:20.440 --> 57:24.360]  like france did back in the sixties they're going to demand a gold bullion
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.440]  delivered to them the physical gold you know back in the sixties
[57:28.440 --> 57:34.120]  uh... the gall sent ships warship to new york and forced america to put their
[57:34.120 --> 57:38.120]  gold france's gold onto a ship stay there shifted back to europe
[57:38.120 --> 57:41.240]  stay there and he wouldn't let nato in his country either but now they just let

[59:57.480 --> 1:00:00.520]  network
[1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:09.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups

[1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:27.240]  segment we got a 13 minute segment with max coming up and then he's gone
[1:00:27.240 --> 1:00:30.200]  so i want to try to shut up here because the brakes keep breaking things up we
[1:00:30.200 --> 1:00:32.600]  have a lot of brakes at the end of the hour and start of the hour
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:36.520]  that's the standard radio clock don't tell me it doesn't make any sense but
[1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:41.240]  the point is max you were trying to get into the goal demanding the gold a year
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:45.240]  or two ago you broke that there was missing gold now that's mainstream
[1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:50.040]  media you talked about defaults you're going on with gold producers that's
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:54.120]  now happening kind of a train wreck as demand spikes
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:57.240]  then let's get into that inside info that you keep trying to get into about the
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:00:59.960]  dollar and and more of what's really going on with the
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:03.720]  Arabs and you're seeing a faster timetable than the one we've been
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:08.120]  hearing about of five years go ahead yeah well okay
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:11.720]  you know the getting back to the gall in the 60s
[1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:17.720]  that's over there france you know france demanded that the u.s return the
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:23.320]  gold that was held on deposit in new york and they forced the u.s to do so
[1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:27.240]  and then um the britain because france was very
[1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:31.400]  nervous about the fact the way that the u.s was going in heavily into debt to
[1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:36.520]  pay for the vietnam war uh and um so then britain was
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:41.560]  next in line to start demanding their gold and then at that point 1971
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:45.160]  uh nixon said no no we're going to close the gold window and this was the
[1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:48.680]  beginning really of the era of fiat currencies
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:52.600]  and the beginning really of the era of derivatives because shortly thereafter
[1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:56.760]  in chicago they started trading options based on the
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:02:00.520]  black and shul option derivative volatility formula
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:04.200]  and you have now the modern era of derivatives which is an era of making
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:07.880]  money from transactions and not making money from
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:11.800]  actually doing anything like it would resemble business
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:16.600]  and but and this has led to incredible booms and incredible busts they had
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:21.080]  ever since then you've got just a flash forward to modern times you have the
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:24.840]  dot-com boom the real estate the guy then crashed the real estate boom and
[1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:27.960]  crash now the banking boom and crash and now these
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:32.680]  countries that are emerging like um russia china iran are saying we
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:35.560]  know what's going on here the u.s is simply printing up
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:38.360]  lots of bony baloney money to pay for their debts
[1:02:38.360 --> 1:02:42.760]  and this is uh not what we're going to be on board for because we're using all
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:46.920]  this money also to finance your wars so the one way we're going to stop you
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:49.960]  from financing wars what it's basically the way that
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:53.320]  iran china and russia are going to stop america from invading iran is they're
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:57.320]  going to crash the dollar i mean that's it's global financial warfare
[1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:00.600]  they don't have to fire a shot they don't have to fire a missile
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:03.400]  they're going to crash the dollar and that's going to put america military
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:07.720]  america out of business that's the game plan and and germany knows this
[1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:11.560]  and germany is right nervous because they've got something like 3000 up to
[1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:15.640]  3000 tons of their gold held in new york but didn't they just ask for that
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:18.360]  didn't they just start asking for the gold a few months ago
[1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:22.200]  they're starting to make rumors we they're starting to make these requests
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:25.080]  is starting to get because they're putting out a
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:28.600]  feeler to see whether the how the u.s is going to respond
[1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:32.600]  it's suicide for the u.s to attack around because it's going to employ the
[1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:36.200]  dollar and it's going to force countries like germany to demand all their
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:41.240]  gold bullion back from new york and tim geithner's old bank the new york fed
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:43.480]  and they're going to show up and they're going to demand their gold bullion
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:46.200]  and gold bullion is going to skyrocket and all these banks are going to be
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:50.040]  completely put out of their fiat currency money-spitting games
[1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:52.840]  and you're going to have another huge down leg
[1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:58.280]  in uh... in in markets but this is a massive question robert fisk talking
[1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:02.120]  about robert fisk in his article for the independent you know robert fisk is a
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:04.920]  great journalist he's talking about the gold producing
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:08.760]  countries are now i'm sorry the oil producing exporting countries are going
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:12.040]  to start trading oil and dollars and what i would add to that
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:15.880]  is you've got now germany in response to the
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:19.320]  the chaos is going to result in terms of the dollar is going to demand
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:22.920]  and we talk we know we made that film alex is on the web i forget what the
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:27.240]  name of the film is but you see me in the bundesbank in berlin i'm talking to
[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:30.840]  officials inside the bundesbank and we have like a hidden camera and they're
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:34.680]  saying to us things that they you know revealed
[1:04:34.680 --> 1:04:38.840]  things that were quite revealing in terms of who owns the gold where's the
[1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:41.960]  gold the gold anti-trust action committee put out a
[1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:46.440]  letter just two weeks ago uh... which uh... they they picked up on the story
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:51.800]  and they reconquered the bundesbank to make a comment about this film and
[1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:55.400]  and to confirm where the gold has been is held
[1:04:55.400 --> 1:04:59.560]  there's also a movement about to ought to stay there gotta break we'll come back
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:02.360]  talk about the illusion created by the power elite
[1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:06.520]  is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat will you continue to

[1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:26.680]  uh coverage the last five minutes is uh allen watt joining us
[1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:30.840]  from canada what is most important right now
[1:06:30.840 --> 1:06:36.040]  uh in the mind of allen watt in your deep reflection and analysis as you cut
[1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:39.160]  through the matrix uh what's what's key that's developing
[1:06:39.160 --> 1:06:43.480]  right now that that allen watt thinks we should all know about
[1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:47.160]  i think you should know what the new world order really is
[1:06:47.160 --> 1:06:53.720]  uh it's um it's a non-democratic system a world ruled by experts and
[1:06:53.720 --> 1:06:58.120]  professionals from all different sciences including all the social
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:00.840]  sciences and they go under the term of world
[1:07:00.840 --> 1:07:04.280]  peace and that sounds nice and positive to most people
[1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:07.320]  but when you break down and their own writings
[1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:10.680]  from their own writings what they mean by world peace
[1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:16.760]  it literally is um a form of totalitarianism from birth to grave
[1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:21.480]  uh to do with uh in fact they wanted to separate the children completely from
[1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:25.080]  parents so they wouldn't be contaminated with old-fashioned values and
[1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:29.160]  ideas but they're found with scientific indoctrination
[1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:34.040]  kindergarten onwards any parental input is made null and void
[1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:37.640]  and so they're pretty well reached that stage they can literally program
[1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:41.240]  the generations every with every intake every year
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:45.960]  of kindergarten upgrade incrementally for what they will experience in their
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:48.840]  lifetime and they'll accept that which they experience because they've been
[1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:53.640]  taught at school as coming so what you're looking at really
[1:07:53.640 --> 1:07:57.480]  the totalitarian world system a deep population plan
[1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:01.560]  as at the top of it too the unfit as they call them
[1:08:01.560 --> 1:08:05.720]  in a post-industrial era remember to all the scientists across the world now and
[1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:09.320]  all the professions believe in evolution it's taught right off the bat
[1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:12.920]  they believe in Darwinian evolution survival of the fittest
[1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:17.000]  they believe that we're the old man all the old types used to work in factories
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  uh the blue collar workers are now obsolete with the emergence of
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  science and robots and genetic technology they can create new types of
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:28.600]  better servants and not as many as they have now
[1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:33.560]  all of this is coming down the pipe as we see even the move as you say to stop
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:36.680]  neighbors from looking after your child for a couple hours when they run off for
[1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:40.120]  some groceries is forbidden across the board in all the
[1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:43.960]  countries at the same time as you say and that is also to stop
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:47.880]  contamination uh and bonding to other people
[1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:51.320]  in your little locality with old-fashioned diet use
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:54.840]  it's okay to put them into a recommended state approved date here
[1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:58.440]  place for a day because they get the correct kind of adoption and
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:01.560]  simultaneously Europe and the US and England and Canada
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:05.720]  announced they want year-round school and the internal documents 20 years ago
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:09.800]  said to break up the families entirely they've got the men and women working
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:12.280]  over time so they can't spend time with their kids
[1:09:12.280 --> 1:09:17.480]  and then if you want to use the neighbor in fact it even said in England bbc
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:20.920]  two groups of police officers aren't allowed to watch their own kids and the
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:24.200]  thing was wow even the godlike police aren't allowed
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:28.040]  to watch their their kids that's right and then now 20
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:32.040]  thousand homes in England that they have cameras watching the kids that they go
[1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:34.680]  to bed on time eat what they're supposed to this is
[1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:38.120]  Orwell now now Alan I want to bring up a key point here and I want you to speak
[1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:43.240]  to this studying their operations at the heart of it
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:47.400]  they are social Darwinists they're saying if we kill a billion people
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:52.600]  since we are in the position of power that means genetically we got the power
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:55.800]  because we were the best and so we're helping the earth
[1:09:55.800 --> 1:10:00.520]  by killing you they're testing soft kill weapons sterilization
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:03.720]  as the White House scientists are spoke about I want to go over this
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:08.760]  with you today but more than that they get the general public to adopt the
[1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:11.480]  eugenical eugenics ideas but they don't even
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:14.920]  consciously know why of yeah humans are a parasite yeah
[1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:18.520]  there's too many of us we don't have art and literature and spacecraft and
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:21.800]  you know we can't do incredible things which we actually are the an
[1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:26.600]  incredible species a wonderful species a self-aware species
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:31.640]  uh you know but but the elites believe their gods they believe
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:35.400]  they're wonderful and and and they want to control the future
[1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:39.720]  and so they only sell the public on lowering their survival instinct
[1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:42.840]  so they will accept and make it a religious sacrament
[1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:46.440]  dying for their carbon footprint or not having children
[1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:50.680]  uh or or being sacrificed to the earth and
[1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:55.800]  so this idea that man is crud man is crap they sell this and sell this and say
[1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:59.880]  you have no rights you're just an animal it's a mind game it's it's a
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:04.520]  huckster scam to say you can make no decisions you're just programmed
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:08.200]  but then oh the elites have to have their rights they have to have their body
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:11.320]  guards oh they're free they they they write all this
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:15.480]  sick dark nihilistic poetry about how they control everything and
[1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:19.240]  they'll destroy everything if they want to so so inherently
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:22.440]  these are very sick evil control freaks
[1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:26.040]  there's no doubt about it at all it's a religion with them
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:30.920]  it's a complete it fulfills all the criteria of a religious belief system
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:36.760]  and superior genetic uh basically a hereditary genetic stock as they believe
[1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:40.520]  in that are from it um they believe that we are the leftover junk
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:44.040]  genes of the bottom otherwise we would be up at the top that's a simple
[1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:47.320]  reasoning that they have and they believe in power
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:50.760]  total power is the main key to survival
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:54.040]  therefore they're the ones at the top with the total power
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:57.960]  and they do plan to exercise that they are exercising it now
[1:11:57.960 --> 1:12:01.480]  i just went through stuff that was released from the world health
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:05.080]  organization from some of its meetings that have never disclosed to the public
[1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:07.720]  before and they now and they admit during their
[1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:12.280]  own discussions their internal debates that most of these vaccines are the
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:16.440]  vaccines in fact the vast bulk of the contaminants in them
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:21.000]  including genetic contaminants and viruses are unknown to them
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:26.120]  sometimes 90% of every obnoxiation and polio still
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:29.960]  is unknown to them don't know they don't know the effects on the body except
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:33.880]  with the new adjuvants they're using for this upcoming swine flu shot
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:37.640]  they do know that they're using rather than chicken eggs they're using
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:41.880]  cancer viruses they admit that their own writings they're using cancer viruses
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:47.080]  for the simple reason that cancer viruses are almost indestructible
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:51.160]  so it will stay in your body forever supposedly to protect your body
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:55.240]  at the same time it might just give you cancer this is incredible science
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:59.320]  in other words they know what they're doing they're taking the population down
[1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:02.760]  not just that a drastic step all at once
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:07.160]  but depending on your shot and your physiology it will all start dying off
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:10.920]  much much faster over the next few years now now allen stop this is this is
[1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:14.920]  this is mind-blowing we're on the same page this is admitted in hundreds of
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:18.280]  government textbooks like eco science but the white house science are
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:21.640]  we now have bought over 10 books he authored all saying the same sickening
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:24.200]  stuff about how they would do this inject us with
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:27.160]  cancer viruses that would trigger as soon as our
[1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:31.000]  hormone levels lowered in men and women between 45 and 65
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:35.400]  we now see that happening the boldness what do you call the boldness of where
[1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:38.760]  they openly say they're killing us where they openly admit
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:44.200]  the first 10 million people in canada in the u.s to get the nasal live flu virus
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:47.160]  they admit it's going to mutate it and spread it
[1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:52.680]  yes this is so so in plain view they admit it has cancer viruses in the major
[1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:56.680]  german and british news we're we're shooting cancer viruses live into
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:00.600]  our nostrils they admit the garden cells killing the girls and mutating
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:03.720]  its own inventor came out and said don't take it i'm sure they'll kill her or
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:08.040]  something the point is is that what do you call
[1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:10.920]  that because i see them testing the ambient murder
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:14.520]  they're now just killing us right out in the open and just setting the precedent
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:19.480]  to do it and then everyone's dropping dead or dying and it's like no big deal
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:22.920]  that's right in fact even admits from the world health
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:26.360]  organization that they're doing a massive campaign
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:30.120]  to train the public train the public to accept that
[1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:34.520]  masses of people die all the time from strokes and heart attacks and cancers
[1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:38.280]  so don't relate it to the vaccine that you're getting this is the present
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:42.520]  propaganda blitz it's out right now so they're training the victim
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:46.760]  to accept his own death and put down two coincidences
[1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:50.680]  it's amazing that they understand what they can do to the public because they've
[1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:54.440]  lied so many times in the past they know the formulas the techniques i mean
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:58.840]  they know how we respond we if there's one percent of credibility in their
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:01.800]  arguments the public will want to believe them
[1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:05.800]  rather than cross the line and see if these guys are killing us
[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:11.000]  because because the average person just like in hard Montana when i caught
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:14.600]  when our listeners caught the con artist felon now admitted running a giant

[1:19:16.520 --> 1:19:19.320]  linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental

[1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:38.760]  on eugenics the master plan how to stop them what they're doing
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:45.640]  1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 he could talk about any issue but
[1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:48.200]  please address your questions alan watch i don't want to talk about a tractor you
[1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:52.360]  got for sale or tuba cobber is in your attic and i might be in mean i just
[1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:55.720]  sometimes people do that especially if we have a guest it's like they will not
[1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:59.880]  address anything to them it's it's kind of like piggly wiggly gets to the head
[1:20:59.880 --> 1:21:02.440]  of the line and then nobody else gets to get on so
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:07.800]  1-800-259-9231 that's coming up in the next hour alan
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:11.640]  we were just talking during the break about social control it's just like the
[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:15.240]  Aztecs one of the dominant mesoamerican
[1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:22.120]  mayan cultures and in their own writings and in what the spanish observes
[1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:25.720]  mothers would beg to have their healthiest best
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:29.800]  because you wanted to have the best sacrifice 10 year old only son
[1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:33.960]  cut up in pieces and then sold as meat by the priest class that's how they made
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:36.600]  their money to the locals and the mothers would gobble their
[1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:42.040]  children with pleasure we have major news out of
[1:21:42.040 --> 1:21:45.880]  soul korea and china this is mainstream baby soup
[1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:52.200]  not a hoax eating babies people get upset if they see a dog killed by marines
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:54.200]  but not if they see a kid killed by marines
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:58.760]  we've been trained to see human life is bad and through mind control
[1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:03.160]  just through cultural mind control Aztecs would kill their sons and daughters
[1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:09.800]  and wives and husbands with pleasure the the the druids would do this
[1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:13.320]  and it's the same thing now we just give our kids to the state
[1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:18.360]  because they're because our guests said earlier uh in in in uh england a mother
[1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:22.360]  said yeah it was really hard to lose the weight ruined my figure they said that
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:26.280]  was a symbol of depression so they took the baby from the family
[1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:31.640]  with no due process the criminal state is here go ahead
[1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:35.480]  yes again too interesting to look at the old video
[1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:38.600]  i think it's still up maybe on youtube i don't know i can't watch it because of
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:42.680]  my slow speed uh they punish me for using explore net
[1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:48.760]  but um uh there was there was a julian hoxley up there and i'll do hoxley
[1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:52.520]  and these guys went into this whole thing and i'll do hoxley himself who
[1:22:52.520 --> 1:22:55.480]  attended all the world meetings he also worked at tapestock
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:22:58.520]  institute he thought that the scientific
[1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:01.800]  dictatorship would be just so wonderful when it came in
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:05.080]  and the people would be trained to love their servitude
[1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:09.720]  but he also talked about the only obstacle they had
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:13.080]  at that time back in the 50s was the remnants
[1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:17.560]  of a powerful or almost post-powerful christianity
[1:23:17.560 --> 1:23:22.120]  at that time it was with what his brother julian said the first CEO of
[1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:26.840]  unesco he said well have to train the people to devaluate human
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:31.560]  life in order to bring through mass abortions
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:35.880]  and eventually genetic selection and sterilization
[1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:40.120]  so this is the plan unfolding now these guys were part of the big world
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:44.600]  meetings of their day they set their agenda they set their timetables
[1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:48.520]  they set up for the end of the millennium and to the new that's now
[1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:52.200]  and that's what it calls called this the century of change and and they never
[1:23:52.200 --> 1:23:56.840]  alter their plans their plans are like long-term business plans set in stone
[1:23:56.840 --> 1:24:01.080]  with 10 year plans for one part 50 for another a hundred for another
[1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:06.120]  we see this same type of plan cropping up in the declassified information
[1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:11.480]  put out by the top think tanks for the military going up to the year 2050 and
[1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:14.840]  beyond and the kind of world that will be then
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:18.520]  and society will have them and we have of course the Rockefellers
[1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:23.080]  caught around the world still pushing the depopulation plan eugenics plan
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:26.680]  if it is to survive the ratio gets sterilized
[1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:30.760]  and then wanted to be simply killed off by various means
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:35.320]  alan we were talking again about how they train us to feed on ourselves they
[1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:39.320]  domesticate us they train us not to notice what's happening
[1:24:39.320 --> 1:24:44.680]  and this whole agenda is rushing forward uh continue
[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:48.200]  well going into the writings again of some of the biggest players who did
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:52.360]  publish lots of their work but we find their techniques because they explain
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:55.640]  their techniques and they were so assured of the
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:59.480]  them working that can only be done because of previous
[1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:05.160]  experimentation on populations and we went back to the 30s 40s 50s 60s
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:10.520]  the hoax this for instance talks about uh people loving their servitude and
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:15.560]  it often used the term domestication uh domesticate the public which what they
[1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:19.080]  meant was and even said this that the only true survivors that are fit to
[1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:24.840]  survive are wild animals that retain all of the survival capabilities
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:29.160]  in order to rule all the lesser types in previous humans who haven't made it to
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:32.280]  the top it has to domesticate them that meant
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:35.560]  to eradicate their instincts for self-preservation
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:39.160]  train them that experts were looking after everything that they would
[1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:43.800]  should look after by themselves and the extent where they couldn't do
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:47.880]  anything without expert advice well we've had a massive campaign since
[1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:51.640]  about the fifties onwards listened to the experts all through magazines
[1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:55.400]  tv's even in news breaks or even weather breaks you get
[1:25:55.400 --> 1:25:59.400]  experts coming on telling you how to dress for the rain uh
[1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:03.400]  this is the form of domestication it's meant to make you think
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:07.800]  that you you know nothing you're too stupid to understand
[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:12.360]  and just accept it accept there are better types of people above you
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:15.800]  taking care of all the big problems that you should be taking care of
[1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:20.360]  and your job is to simply play as much as you can play and enjoy yourself and
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:23.160]  don't become involved in the big problems in life
[1:26:23.160 --> 1:26:26.920]  to do with politics policies or anything else just accept it
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:31.800]  that's called domestication until uh you you literally have no
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:36.120]  self-preservation instincts left when that happens you're now ready for
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:39.560]  extermination and then they can even train you as you say they're
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:44.680]  training the children to volunteer for sterilization to save the world
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:48.520]  and of course this new religion of ecology
[1:26:48.520 --> 1:26:53.320]  is a religion as Gorbachev said we are creating a new religion based on a form
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:56.520]  of earth worship but of course it's got its own high
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:27:00.760]  priests that decide who should procreate who should not procreate
[1:27:00.760 --> 1:27:05.000]  and and that's not fast enough for them they want to start killing us off even
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:08.920]  faster but we're not breeding enough in the west to tell us that we're almost
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:12.040]  sterile but and hence the immigration levels are
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:15.640]  massive however we're not dying fast enough across the
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:18.440]  world so they want to speed up the process and
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:22.360]  oh and notice children so you must you mustn't tell them any truth
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:25.640]  you must say it's also strange that these cancers
[1:27:25.640 --> 1:27:29.560]  are affecting everyone and everyone's dying and that'll be taught
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:32.600]  it's just a a new a new happening well they're saying that they're saying
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:35.160]  you're all just going to die of cancer and you're all just going to die of
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:38.600]  diabetes and that matter what you do just take your shot you're going to die
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:42.120]  and there's going to be lots of deaths and yeah it's a live virus and yeah
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:45.080]  you're going to die but it wasn't the vaccine but it does say on the insert
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:48.200]  it may kill you and it and this Gardasil is going to kill
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:52.200]  you but it doesn't protect you from the from the cancer but it will give you
[1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:57.240]  cancer but everything's fine and they just throw it all out there
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:01.560]  and it's like the public really is in a trance now more and more of them are
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:05.800]  starting to wake up so the establishment's program is to shock us even
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:10.680]  more and pile on hoping people just give up
[1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:14.920]  yeah it's a technique they give you the dialectical process the pros and the
[1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:17.960]  cons they get you into a punch drunk state
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:21.400]  and you simply give up and and then you say well
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:25.400]  they can't be doing this for negative reasons to kill us
[1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:28.520]  so i'll just go along with the rest of the public that's how
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:31.960]  simple it is people look around for a hero to follow
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:35.880]  and if there's no heroes they simply go along with the rest of the public
[1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:39.640]  and do what they do that's a hoax they said himself
[1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:45.000]  now let's talk about in the short term what their program is long term but
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:48.440]  also solutions how you think this battle is going to shake out and what
[1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:52.040]  things will look like if they win any other important angles elman watt
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:54.440]  wants to cover and then your phone calls that'll take us a
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:29:00.360]  lot of interesting random directions we'll be right back stay with us
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:03.800]  have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power
[1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:07.400]  if so this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear
[1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:11.000]  solar power generators are now available from solutions from science in

[1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:16.520]  lifesaving electrical power when you need it most
[1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:19.640]  unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly
[1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:23.720]  emits no fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric
[1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:26.280]  power plant running quietly in your own home
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:30.280]  run some pumps shortwave radios computers and even keep food from

[1:32:00.120 --> 1:32:03.800]  hello friends this is alex jones and i want each of you to ask yourself this
[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:06.440]  question do you really know what's in your tap water
[1:32:06.440 --> 1:32:10.120]  in a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor
[1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:14.200]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal
[1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:16.520]  drinking water many of these chemicals are directly
[1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:19.720]  linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental system
[1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:22.360]  diseases now what are you going to do about it
[1:32:22.360 --> 1:32:26.360]  the acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take
[1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:28.840]  back control of you and your family's drinking water

[1:32:57.400 --> 1:33:00.760]  today that's acola blue.com
[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:06.200]  direct from austin coast to coast and in your face
[1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:11.640]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:15.400]  most people still today think that all entertainment
[1:33:15.400 --> 1:33:20.520]  to do with movies drama is therefore nothing more than their entertainment
[1:33:20.520 --> 1:33:23.400]  and never ever was that case. Throughout history
[1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:27.400]  social engineers have refined techniques designed to control large
[1:33:27.400 --> 1:33:31.160]  populations bringing entertainment to thousands of people
[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:35.560]  right in the comfort of our own homes. You're actually in an alpha state being
[1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:39.800]  completely downloaded with new ideas. A cult of personality can be
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:44.280]  manufactured to influence the masses. Nobody will question what he's doing
[1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:48.680]  they'll be so preoccupied with where he is or what he's wearing.
[1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:52.200]  Yes we can. The idea of making him into a celebrity.
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:56.680]  Eventually he said he will expect the media to do all their thinking and
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:00.440]  reasoning for them. That's happened today. The scientific
[1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:03.960]  dictatorship understands what makes human beings tick
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:08.440]  and they're using it against us. These cells are scanned by a stream of
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:12.760]  electrons completing 30 pictures a second. It's hard for people
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:15.880]  like that to take a serious interest in what their
[1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:20.360]  elected officials are doing. They've been programmed. It's Obama's role to front
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:24.840]  for the international making syndicate. Barack Obama is a puppet of the new
[1:34:24.840 --> 1:34:28.440]  world order. Is this some sort of new world order? The new world order that is
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:30.680]  emerging. For the first time in history we really
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:34.200]  have this new form of an empire. The average man and
[1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:37.240]  woman is in a trance. They get home from work.
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:40.920]  They don't even talk to their children. They turn the television on
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:46.360]  and they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives. You got
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:49.800]  time to watch baseball. You got time to entertain yourself.
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:55.240]  But a knowledgeable public we're losing. Kill your television or at least turn it
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:34:59.240]  off a few hours a day. The children aren't even playing in your front yards
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:03.880]  anymore. We don't want to live under a world government
[1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:10.280]  of the corporations by the corporations and for the corporations.
[1:35:10.280 --> 1:35:17.560]  Fall of the Republic. Fallium One, the presidency of Barack Obama.
[1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:21.400]  Obama is the latest version of 21st century mass
[1:35:21.400 --> 1:35:26.600]  mind control. Available on DVD at infowars.com
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:33.720]  and online at prisonplanet.tv October 21st, 2009.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.520]  So there is the third trailer. Fourth coming out next week and the fifth
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:42.200]  the day before it comes out. We got some special sneak peeks too
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:46.440]  for folks just at prisonplanet.tv. All right Alan I'm going to shut up
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:49.960]  for this rest of this segment before we go to calls. Getting into
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:53.880]  what their current operation is, what you think's happening with the flu,
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:57.080]  those new World Health Organization documents you have.
[1:35:57.080 --> 1:36:03.160]  They're up on CuttingThethMatrix.com and some news about how we beat these
[1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:06.680]  people. Now there is a big awakening happening. So
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:10.520]  that collision between people that want freedom and decent
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:14.600]  humanity and for honorableness to be
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:18.040]  held up and those that want death and destruction.
[1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:21.000]  Well I think the people first have to understand that they're not dealing
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.920]  with the democratic institutions. You're dealing with people
[1:36:24.920 --> 1:36:30.040]  with an agenda who are all pre-chosen before they get into politics with trains
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:34.840]  and to their roles and they're all on board with this agenda.
[1:36:34.840 --> 1:36:38.840]  So technically there's no negotiation with them to be honest with you.
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:42.760]  The only thing that's left outside of outright revolution
[1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:47.400]  is for large groups of people to literally
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:52.920]  hit them economically. For instance an example the nurses of New York State
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:56.840]  have been told that they're going to be fired if they don't take
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:02.920]  this swine flu shot. My suggestion to them is to walk off on mass and
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:06.920]  just walk out the hospital on mass for a day or two and you'll see the
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:11.080]  howls and screams that those guys want you to bring you to the negotiating
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:14.360]  table that these are the only kinds of strategies left
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:18.920]  for people outside revolution. And the boys at the top know this because
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:23.080]  they've been setting up internal armies and securities for
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:27.160]  20 years for this particular time that we're going through now.
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:31.400]  They knew this time would come so to be honest there's no
[1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:34.920]  easy way out of this. This is the life or death
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:39.080]  situations that we're going through right now. They have their deep population
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:41.480]  program. The World Health Organization at their
[1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:46.360]  meeting in 2006, the World Meeting stated that if they can get the public
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:50.200]  to accept mandatory inoculation per one thing then
[1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:54.520]  introduce more mandatory inoculations every year for the rest of the adult's
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:57.480]  life including annual boosters for every shot
[1:37:57.480 --> 1:38:01.480]  they've ever had. And Alan continuing on the flu front
[1:38:01.480 --> 1:38:05.400]  they're now ordering kids to go to school to take it. No law they just do it.
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:08.760]  We're seeing the real tyranny and they're bragging that they're setting the
[1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:13.080]  precedent to force over 56 vaccine boosters so
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:16.520]  that's now in the hundreds. Every couple years
[1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:21.080]  of meningitis shots, hepatitis shots, the AIDS vaccine
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:24.920]  and Bill Gates is now bragged and it's in the Associated Press. Oh
[1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:30.040]  when he laughs when he gives a speech. Oh I found out we're giving people
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:33.240]  polio with the new vaccine. It happens to be live
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:37.000]  and then the little elite clubs they all giggle because the local good old boys
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  they're in on the fun. That's Nigeria. Nigeria's not good.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.520]  I've got a new evolved type of polio that they admit now
[1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:48.040]  at the World Health Organization came from the particular vaccine they were
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:52.920]  giving the people there. It evolved into a new hyper polio that's
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:55.480]  rampaging through the public. It came from the vaccine.
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:59.160]  It admits it because. And now they admit in the mainstream
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:02.360]  literature that the live nasal vaccine is going to
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:06.120]  create hundreds of mutations and is what's spreading H1N1.
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:10.680]  So out in the open they hit us with all the fools that are
[1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:13.960]  shooting it up their kids nose, sneezing on everybody
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:17.160]  and the public is so dumbed down they can't even understand it.
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:19.960]  Again they've been trained that experts don't lie
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:24.120]  and we've had 50 years of training into this
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:27.480]  new type of system that the public can't believe
[1:39:27.480 --> 1:39:31.000]  and that's the as I say you can get at the ladder but until you literally cross
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:34.280]  the last wrong man stand on it you won't see the big picture
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:37.560]  and the last wrong is difficult. It's difficult to cross and say
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:40.680]  they're not just talking about killing us they have been killing us and they
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:44.200]  want to kill more of us. When you really understand that it's
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:47.960]  true you'll see everything completely different from then on it
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:53.240]  as to what you can do so you can't negotiate with tyranny.
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:57.000]  Well the key here is they're not negotiating they're not stopping it's a
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  power cult and we have to admit they're testing the soft kill
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:04.760]  now and I want to talk some about solutions here but everything you
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:08.120]  bring up just just just literally flags come up because it's all
[1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:12.840]  so accurate. You're dealing with all of this and
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:17.000]  watching them kill us and then always little petty power people
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.720]  who don't even care if they're being killed themselves
[1:40:19.720 --> 1:40:23.160]  as long as they can kill people under them. It's very sick.
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:27.800]  Yes and again to the test the dollar that it's Stanford is a big
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:31.000]  player and as all the universities have their specialized areas in creating
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:34.840]  vaccines that are vacuum or viruses for warfare purposes
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:37.880]  but they're also into the social science and psychology
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:41.400]  and Stanford is one of the prime universities for
[1:40:41.400 --> 1:40:46.040]  for mass control basically. They did the the old the Millgaard experiments
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:50.520]  on on testing people's obedience to authority
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:53.160]  by shocking people these trained people that are actually
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:55.720]  shocking our victim on the other side of the glass.
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:58.520]  It was the actors on the other side of the glass they didn't know
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:02.360]  and they go up to kill voltage on the dial there as long as someone
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:05.800]  above them took authority and responsibility for it.
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:08.840]  They know how to use the public against the public.
[1:41:08.840 --> 1:41:12.920]  Yeah 90% you can take a farm boy and make him a cop
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:16.040]  six months later 90% in the Stanford research
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:19.880]  will put a gun to their mother's head and blow her brains across the room
[1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:22.840]  if someone in a uniform orders them to do it.
[1:41:22.840 --> 1:41:26.600]  Yes and and it's true to see that there are old techniques that be understood
[1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:31.800]  by the high you know sciences and old cults guys and masonry and so on
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:37.400]  at the top. You can find it in the riots of New York in 1800s
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:41.880]  that the mayor at the time of the whole riots he says
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:45.880]  he said that people could always hire half the poor to kill the other half.
[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:50.600]  That's what he said. We understand this but money is the key.
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:54.520]  I can survive but get money out on the winning side don't leave me alone.
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:57.400]  That's what they think until their usefulness is over
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:01.080]  and then they're eliminated too.
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:05.320]  Unbelievable Alan let's do this let's come back and take calls and then at the
[1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:08.520]  end of the last segment let's get into a little bit of solutions but we're
[1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:10.600]  going to have you back up for more of that as well.
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:14.040]  But I guess what you're saying is the big solution is becoming aware of this
[1:42:14.040 --> 1:42:18.200]  matrix of propaganda and social engineering and really getting upset
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:22.280]  about it and really talking human to human about the ruling elite
[1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:26.520]  and their program for humanity and ask the public do you like being controlled
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:29.400]  do you like being poisoned do you like everybody being
[1:42:29.400 --> 1:42:32.760]  blubbery and and bleach skin and unhealthy and
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:35.880]  zits all over the place I mean do you like being poisoned do you like the
[1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:39.400]  half the kids in your neighborhood dead or dying of diseases or cancer
[1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:43.400]  I mean is this what because it's only going to get worse I mean is it fun I
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:48.120]  mean the cops out there is the petty power the petty manhood rituals
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:52.760]  is it fun do you like being used are you going to serve this
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:57.960]  90% of you will unless you were conscious of the manipulation
[1:42:57.960 --> 1:43:00.680]  we'll be right back with Alan White.

[1:47:29.880 --> 1:47:35.160]  big job big job
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:37.720]  all right i didn't mean to go off into a rant i was just talking to one of my
[1:47:37.720 --> 1:47:42.360]  producers or the radio guys rob do about how they
[1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:46.120]  and his wife's in education how they tried for months to get it in the
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:49.320]  exemption form they would laugh and say it doesn't exist
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:52.840]  up until a month ago you could always just print it off online
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:56.520]  now i guess they make you get one from them they're real bastards
[1:47:56.520 --> 1:48:00.840]  uh but uh going back to a lot before we continue with calls
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:03.960]  yeah there's always these little ring around the rosy games it's in the
[1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:07.960]  dallas morning news they're kicking kids out if they don't take the regular shot
[1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:12.120]  seasonal flu and the new one i mean i i showed dallas morning news yesterday
[1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:16.200]  austin's announcing it but there's no law they're saying you don't have to but
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:18.760]  you have to and then you say well i want an
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:22.040]  exemption form and they laugh at you and say you don't have to honey
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:26.280]  i mean this is just so sick and and and these locals they always get like a
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:29.560]  little piggy face a little demonic smile
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:33.480]  what is that programming where they revel in abusing people they
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:36.600]  revel in line yeah what you've got truly is what
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:41.800]  uh instead about the soviet system and the hero worship of the man at the top
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:45.800]  the same with the with the the nazi regime in germany
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:49.640]  uh what they found was all the officers down below are sadomasochists
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:54.040]  and this is how power works it's a sadomasochistic thing that attracts
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:57.880]  psychopathic types into those positions but they're generally the only ones who
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:01.640]  go into them and they worship the person above them with
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:06.120]  power and they despise the person beneath them who has less power than
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:10.040]  themselves that's how simply it works with sadomasochism
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:13.960]  and you'll always have this strange sadomasochistic authoritarianism
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:17.880]  when you get into politics and right down to local politics even
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:22.760]  any authority this is the very thing that carol young warned the public about
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:26.600]  back in the the the fifties he talked with iron curtain
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:30.280]  across germany but he also said this is i see an iron curtain of
[1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:33.880]  massive bureaucracies building up with with governmental
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:38.760]  agencies stifling and strangling the freedom of the whole planet
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:41.720]  he understood what was coming down the pike back then
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:45.320]  many of of his generation did in fact because they were involved in meeting
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:48.360]  high-level people and he knew that the world were
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:53.480]  bringing in would be one of tyranny by force and that's we have got
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:57.960]  one of the criteria of tyranny is when you're forced into a position by
[1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:01.080]  authorities and without any escape routes in
[1:50:01.080 --> 1:50:05.400]  other words you have no choice that is tyranny when you have no choice in any
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:09.000]  situation well you're absolutely right
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:12.440]  they since they don't have a choice they learn to love it
[1:50:12.440 --> 1:50:17.640]  and love the defendant and so when you say hey the banks just stole 23.7
[1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:21.000]  trillion we got to pay it back with interest
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.760]  they just laugh and and will say i'm part of the power structure
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:28.760]  and it's almost like a five-year-old dressing up like their
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:33.800]  Luke Skywalker dressing up like their you know some hero
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:37.400]  that it's like the public or eternal children
[1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:41.240]  and they're they they imagine things they
[1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:46.440]  they they're delusional and i never had a view of myself as something special
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:51.080]  or wonderful or good i'm just a person that has my instincts intact
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:55.000]  and you know having a bunch of psychos writing books about how they're killing
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:58.520]  me with vaccines and stuff in the water and then i can see the evidence they're
[1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:01.080]  doing it i mean if they write hundreds of books
[1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:06.360]  about how they're killing us and how how it's a scientific dictatorship
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:09.000]  wouldn't there be something wrong with me if i didn't
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:12.680]  as a red-blooded male not stand up for my species
[1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:16.920]  against a power-tripping group that's playing god
[1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:21.160]  absolutely and part of the key of obedience as they stand for another
[1:51:21.160 --> 1:51:23.560]  university they're into these experiments all the time
[1:51:23.560 --> 1:51:26.840]  are on obedience or the ci involved with them obviously
[1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:32.600]  and what they find is with the more power they accumulate in any agency
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:37.160]  and the stage of masochistic power structure they begin to despise the
[1:51:37.160 --> 1:51:41.240]  ordinary people who who begin to cow under authority
[1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:44.600]  the more the people cow under authority the more the despised
[1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:49.400]  is almost weaklings and eventually hated by those in power
[1:51:49.400 --> 1:51:54.120]  uh i've always said it's like a a farmer breaking the legs of a cow it falls to
[1:51:54.120 --> 1:51:57.560]  the ground then he starts kicking it because it can't get up
[1:51:57.560 --> 1:52:02.040]  that's the very system that's in play today with the state of masochistic
[1:52:02.040 --> 1:52:05.720]  total power structure that's set up this is a hell on earth they're being in
[1:52:05.720 --> 1:52:10.760]  and it's up to us to fight it but utterly with every means that we have
[1:52:10.760 --> 1:52:13.960]  well i think that one of the most effective ways to attack it is to just
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:18.760]  show people the matrix of false reality and reach out to police military
[1:52:18.760 --> 1:52:22.680]  bureaucrats and go you know your little cousin just
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:26.920]  out of cancer at 22 that's not normal here's some statistics
[1:52:26.920 --> 1:52:30.200]  do you know what's in the water do you know what's in the shots here
[1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:35.720]  here's ap admitting they're giving everyone polio with the polio vaccine
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:40.040]  and you're not going to listen now because you have defenses up
[1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:43.640]  but deep down in your instincts you know i'm telling you the truth
[1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:48.600]  you're being manipulated and i found that six months down the road a year down
[1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:53.800]  the road they then wake up and just showing them how
[1:52:53.800 --> 1:52:57.240]  they're not in the power structure like they think
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:00.920]  they are how they're being attacked as well
[1:53:00.920 --> 1:53:04.040]  it was interesting too is this new world order
[1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:08.120]  is to go through a series of changes including the riot phase for
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:11.240]  30 odd years as they bring down the food supply
[1:53:11.240 --> 1:53:15.000]  and then the united nations takes over the distribution of food to all the
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:18.440]  different regions as they call these sections of the world
[1:53:18.440 --> 1:53:22.200]  and you see their own writings and the united nations that will
[1:53:22.200 --> 1:53:26.520]  gradually reduce these this ration to each area
[1:53:26.520 --> 1:53:30.680]  every year and it's up to you to bring your population down to accommodate
[1:53:30.680 --> 1:53:33.960]  and use the resources are given to you this is all
[1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:36.680]  the plan and this is how on earth they're being in
[1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:40.120]  step by step and of course the reduction of population
[1:53:40.120 --> 1:53:46.120]  via mass literally it's um but we're being killed off by inoculations
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:49.960]  and in notice and that's all stated and they all brag about it
[1:53:49.960 --> 1:53:53.320]  and you'll tell some mom and she'll arrogantly laugh at you
[1:53:53.320 --> 1:53:56.360]  take her kid who already looks like a zombie
[1:53:56.360 --> 1:53:59.560]  and and and just shoot them up with some more and then they'll look at you
[1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:04.040]  with pleasure you crazy nut it doesn't matter if you just quoted
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:07.720]  state apartment memorandum 200 yes it doesn't matter if you're quoting you
[1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:11.160]  in documents it doesn't matter they don't care
[1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:14.440]  and then when their kid dies they wear a little cancer ribbon and
[1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:21.000]  cry and it's like a celebrity thing oh your kid died too
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:23.960]  you know because it's all about euthanizing everybody that's what
[1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:26.920]  this is all about it is euthanasia and it's a
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:29.960]  bacteria bacteria warfare is viral warfare
[1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:34.200]  is bio warfare carefully designed and as they and all this stuff has been
[1:54:34.200 --> 1:54:37.640]  released recently from the internal meetings
[1:54:37.640 --> 1:54:41.640]  at the world health organization they admit that all of these
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:47.480]  particles of of DNA and RNA and so on recombined within the body
[1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:51.000]  infect the cells of the person and cause cancers down the road they
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:55.240]  understand it well they grow it in the exact type of monkeys and fetal
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:54:58.200]  tissue that have the cancer virus that's most
[1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:01.480]  viral that's most deadly in it well actually that they've said now they've
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:05.320]  stated now that they're actually using especially for this new swine flu
[1:55:05.320 --> 1:55:09.000]  rather than use the eggs chicken eggs and so on for doing so which also contains
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:13.720]  thousands of foreign they're using cancer virus instead of the dead baby
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:19.880]  retinas or the green monkey kidneys uh or the uh other growth
[1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:23.240]  mediums you're right they are using cancer virus
[1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:26.520]  that's what they say because the cancer virus is a survivor so they're using
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:30.840]  that isn't it oh yeah isn't that sweet i'm gonna move
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:35.560]  the calls quickly now mark in oregon you're on the air go ahead

[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:44.760]  thank you for your great wisdom even alex on monday show that you had
[1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:48.360]  mentioned that there were 10 million doses of the flu
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:51.000]  mess being sent out into the country on monday
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:54.040]  they will have arrived or probably have arrived at the destination by now i'm
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:57.080]  sure many of destinations that it's arriving to are the
[1:55:57.080 --> 1:56:00.040]  walmart stores well let me tell you they said
[1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:04.200]  they said last friday that 200 000 were going to tennessee
[1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:10.520]  indiana and texas yes you also reported alex the mayo clinic has come out and
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:14.360]  said that the flu mist will be much more contagious to other people
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:17.960]  it takes 10 to 20 days as i understand it at this point for the actual
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:22.600]  sentence to manifest in someone who has received an injected or a flu mist
[1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:26.680]  vaccination now i think the time clock has already
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:29.960]  started on this and that the actual mass
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:35.560]  murder genocide that there that this operation consists of and it is not a
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:39.400]  drill absolutely not a drill it's set in motion now as to
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:43.000]  where it's going to follow through with the actual sickness itself
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:46.520]  and people are going to become so sick and weak that they're going to accept
[1:56:46.520 --> 1:56:49.880]  martial law and i think this is the first stage of the
[1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:53.560]  operation well i know this we're going to find out
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:57.560]  by the end of october early november whether
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:57:01.240]  it's meant to mutate really be deadly or if this is just setting the precedent
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:04.520]  for us to go under world health organization rules and to set the
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:07.960]  precedent to take the shots as they've stated throughout a time i appreciate
