[08:31.520 --> 08:37.320]  three hours we have Glenn Spencer a researcher and reporter joining us in the
[08:37.320 --> 08:43.880]  last 30 minutes of the broadcast today dealing with the ATF promoting the high
[08:43.880 --> 08:49.720]  level ATF agents that even after their subordinates reported that the gun
[08:49.720 --> 08:54.880]  running into Mexico was criminal and killing citizens and cops on both sides
[08:54.880 --> 08:59.840]  of the border including Border Patrol they continued the operation to then
[08:59.840 --> 09:05.800]  demonize the Second Amendment they have been promoted and given giant raises
[09:05.800 --> 09:10.440]  this is standard procedure the FBI agents that ordered their underlings to
[09:10.440 --> 09:16.040]  stand down on 9-11 including FBI agents that said I believe they want to get an
[09:16.040 --> 09:20.200]  aircraft and fly them into the World Trade Center they said that's it shut up
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.800]  you're off the case when they spoke about it they demoted those officers those
[09:24.800 --> 09:29.800]  agents in Minneapolis in Phoenix and other areas and it's the same situation
[09:29.800 --> 09:38.200]  here smoking gun evidence of criminal activity reporting and the system
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.600]  supporting these individuals now we're gonna have open phones throughout the
[09:43.600 --> 09:47.800]  broadcast it's all coming out dealing with Rick Perry being a giant Al Gore
[09:47.800 --> 09:52.080]  supporter that's all coming up tons of international news financial news but
[09:52.080 --> 09:56.600]  first I want to premiere here for radio listeners and prison planet dot TV viewers
[09:56.600 --> 10:05.080]  the Ron Paul tipping point we're gonna premiere the special report now if you
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.400]  get video of Sarah Palin or get a sound bite from her bring that back to us you
[10:09.400 --> 10:12.560]  can hold the Ron Paul stuff that's the one thing Donald Trump has ever been
[10:12.560 --> 10:15.760]  right about is that he's unelectable we are in the business of kicking candidates
[10:15.760 --> 10:20.240]  out of the race this Ron Paul is gonna destroy this party Paul is doing very
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.080]  well out in Iowa and I don't think that's gonna thrill a lot of the
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.120]  Republican establishment my friends we have reached a tipping point in the
[10:30.120 --> 10:36.880]  United States congressman Ron Paul a true defender of liberty and freedom a
[10:36.880 --> 10:43.160]  man who's never compromised in his speeches but more importantly in his
[10:43.160 --> 10:49.160]  actions with his votes in Congress a person who has a absolutely perfect
[10:49.160 --> 10:56.520]  voting record when it comes to the Constitution is surging right now he has
[10:56.520 --> 11:03.840]  won the coveted CPAC straw poll two years in a row he has dominated the New
[11:03.840 --> 11:09.200]  Hampshire straw poll he came in second place despite the fact that Michelle
[11:09.200 --> 11:16.240]  Bachman admittedly bought 4,000 votes in the Iowa straw poll he is winning all
[11:16.240 --> 11:21.520]  over the country other straw polls other online polls scientific polls he's
[11:21.520 --> 11:25.160]  gotten more money for the military than all the other Republicans combined and
[11:25.160 --> 11:32.640]  he's gotten more than Obama got think about that and the list goes on and on
[11:32.640 --> 11:39.200]  and on he is routinely in the top five search terms on Google other candidates
[11:39.200 --> 11:44.880]  don't even show up but something else is happening here you may go outside and
[11:44.880 --> 11:50.320]  see that the sky is blue the so-called mainstream and they're not really
[11:50.320 --> 11:54.480]  mainstream anymore and that's the tipping point I'm about to get to the so
[11:54.480 --> 12:04.040]  called mainstream media is been beating the drum with this mantra that Ron Paul
[12:04.040 --> 12:11.840]  can't win Ron Paul's a joke the system is running scared in a headlong panic of
[12:11.840 --> 12:20.440]  Ron Paul they knew his potential in 2008 and successfully sold the hoax that he
[12:20.440 --> 12:27.120]  was unelectable but this time the shrill cries are deafening from Rush
[12:27.120 --> 12:32.840]  Limbaugh hatefully talking about how Ron Paul will destroy their precious neocon
[12:32.840 --> 12:37.760]  warmongering party this Ron Paul is going to destroy this party if they keep
[12:37.760 --> 12:44.120]  if this this is nuts on parade to CNN pundits saying there's no way he can win
[12:44.120 --> 12:50.680]  if you look at the top two here Michelle Bachman followed by Ron Paul you
[12:50.680 --> 12:56.040]  could argue that the polls are showing those are among the two that do the worst
[12:56.040 --> 13:02.480]  put up against President Obama to reports at Politico where they say
[13:02.480 --> 13:07.560]  Michelle Bachman gets first place Palenty gets third no mention of Ron Paul
[13:07.560 --> 13:15.160]  why are they so scared of Ron Paul well the ruling class of this country the
[13:15.160 --> 13:19.040]  fortune 100 the private fell reserve have amassed their wealth through
[13:19.040 --> 13:26.280]  monopoly they've amassed their wealth through insider anti-capitalist crony
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.600]  systems and now their system is basically imploding because of their
[13:31.600 --> 13:36.560]  corrupt policies and activities and looting and here's Ron Paul who's
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.160]  called it every step of the way with incredible precision who has the
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.720]  constitutional answers to get our country back on the right track and the
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.720]  system is scared to death they're like vampires faced with a cross or holy water
[13:50.720 --> 13:57.600]  or a truckload of garlic they are in absolute panic mode because they've
[13:57.600 --> 14:03.440]  looked at the numbers and they know Ron Paul is the real front runner in the
[14:03.440 --> 14:09.320]  2012 election and they know that if he continues to catch on even their
[14:09.320 --> 14:14.000]  electronic voting machines won't be able to stop a landslide and if they did
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.920]  the public would see right through it so they have to convince you that he's
[14:18.920 --> 14:26.440]  unelectable they have to sell you on the idea that oh I like Ron Paul but he's
[14:26.440 --> 14:33.120]  not available you know he can't win the fact that Ron Paul is the true front
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.640]  runner and is popular across the political spectrum and major political
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.160]  analysts have had to admit that only Ron Paul can effectively beat Barack Obama
[14:42.160 --> 14:47.960]  that's why the system is scared of him and that illustrates how awake people
[14:47.960 --> 14:53.800]  are that Ron Paul is the most popular and if this was a fair game and wasn't
[14:53.800 --> 14:59.400]  rigged would be our next president so some of you then say well Alex why are
[14:59.400 --> 15:03.160]  you supporting Ron Paul if you think it's rigged well we've got a fight
[15:03.160 --> 15:07.520]  whether it's rigged or not Ron Paul is in there injecting real issues about the
[15:07.520 --> 15:14.080]  fellow reserve torture preemptive wars the inflation tax everything that he's
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.920]  warned us about is now coming true and so he's there bearing testament to the
[15:18.920 --> 15:23.520]  truth and rallying more and more young people you know the Bilderberg group three
[15:23.520 --> 15:27.120]  years ago panicked according to our sources and said the kids aren't into
[15:27.120 --> 15:31.400]  mainline neocon conservatism they're not into communism both systems we control
[15:31.400 --> 15:36.120]  they're into true libertarianism they're into constitutionalism they're
[15:36.120 --> 15:41.720]  rediscovering the laws and the systems and the civilization that defeats
[15:41.720 --> 15:48.040]  tyrants they're discovering the shield that allows people to grow and live and
[15:48.040 --> 15:54.600]  be prosperous and in closing that is the most important point the tipping point
[15:54.600 --> 16:00.120]  is reached Ron Paul's popularity is growing exponentially and it is a
[16:00.120 --> 16:07.120]  manifestation of how popular liberty is and the fact that the spirit of 1776 is
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.520]  being rediscovered and the tipping point is more illustrated by the full court
[16:12.520 --> 16:16.440]  press when they saw him getting standing ovations and winning that
[16:16.440 --> 16:21.680]  republican primary with all those other wolves attacking this lion and the fact
[16:21.680 --> 16:26.520]  that the public was there watching was totally sold on his message they panic
[16:26.520 --> 16:31.960]  and through everything they could Friday Saturday and Sunday at him they sent
[16:31.960 --> 16:36.600]  in Bachman to buy the votes they did it all all the stops were removed they gave
[16:36.600 --> 16:42.240]  full power to their system and what happened they failed and so today on
[16:42.240 --> 16:48.680]  Monday oh Politico changed their headline it was Bachman one and Paul came in
[16:48.680 --> 16:54.920]  second and Associated Press came out and said once a fringe candidate Paul
[16:54.920 --> 17:00.960]  shaping 2012 race he's the leader Associated Press that's the proof of the
[17:00.960 --> 17:04.640]  total tipping point being reached we're right on the cusp we gotta put our
[17:04.640 --> 17:10.240]  maximum effort in is article after article after article after article saying
[17:10.240 --> 17:16.040]  Ron Paul was treated wrong Ron Paul was screwed Ron Paul can win it's a
[17:16.040 --> 17:20.560]  hoax that Ron Paul can't win they already knew that beforehand but you caught
[17:20.560 --> 17:26.200]  them they came and told you that you couldn't have Ron Paul they told you he
[17:26.200 --> 17:31.400]  wasn't an option on the menu you came in you said I want the flammé mignon with
[17:31.400 --> 17:34.840]  the agrotton potatoes and green beans and they said sorry sir it's not on the
[17:34.840 --> 17:38.920]  menu you said it is on the menu and they said oh it's a mistake it's not and you
[17:38.920 --> 17:42.480]  looked over and watched them deliver a plate of it to somebody you're going
[17:42.480 --> 17:46.440]  no I know that's on the menu and so they're like oh you're right he is on
[17:46.440 --> 17:53.400]  the menu okay Ron Paul is is in the forefront but let's look at Rick Perry
[17:53.400 --> 17:58.200]  over here you know he was Al Gore's campaign chairman in Texas he did he does
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.560]  support force inoculations he has nice hair he talked about secession how does
[18:02.560 --> 18:07.540]  that sound they are throwing everything at the American people right now the
[18:07.540 --> 18:12.040]  bankers either gain the whole world to their fraud or they lose it all now they
[18:12.040 --> 18:17.280]  have gambled everything they will either succeed now or fall forever and it's the
[18:17.280 --> 18:26.240]  same thing for the March of Liberty we succeed because we resist and the system
[18:26.240 --> 18:33.320]  is running scared of Ron Paul right now their attempt to sell the public on the
[18:33.320 --> 18:38.920]  fraudulent idea that he's unelectable no one is unelectable if you decide to
[18:38.920 --> 18:43.840]  elect them don't let them choose for you their scam may have worked three and a
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.960]  half years ago but now when someone so clearly is a front-runner he should be
[18:48.960 --> 18:52.280]  our next president and they're going to pull out every stop is like I did with
[18:52.280 --> 18:57.960]  Rand Paul but as that election illustrates no amount of lies and spin is
[18:57.960 --> 19:02.840]  going to stop the people once they're aware of the fraud once you're aware of
[19:02.840 --> 19:09.640]  the magician's trick no amount of bull will sell you on the fraud anymore the
[19:09.640 --> 19:14.720]  tipping point is here they got their hind ends handed to him when they ran
[19:14.720 --> 19:18.480]  the hoax that he couldn't be elected and now they're backing off but only for a
[19:18.480 --> 19:23.720]  time they'll be back with new tricks maybe they'll say Ron Paul kidnapped a
[19:23.720 --> 19:28.160]  woman like they said about Rand or that he kept black slaves in his basement or
[19:28.160 --> 19:35.200]  that he's part alien maybe they'll say that he hurts little puppy dogs you
[19:35.200 --> 19:38.920]  better know they're gonna try to assassinate his character and his name
[19:38.920 --> 19:44.200]  because they're trying to assassinate the idea of liberty and freedom but all

[24:23.880 --> 24:30.280]  video and send it to all of your brainwashed mainline Republican friends
[24:30.280 --> 24:36.320]  because there is a continuity of agenda by the mega banks and corporations for
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.920]  now more than 50 years that's coming to fruition now to totally destroy the
[24:41.920 --> 24:47.240]  once free Republic that we live in the rhetoric is different between Republicans
[24:47.240 --> 24:51.760]  and Democrats but at the end of the day their actions are the same and coming
[24:51.760 --> 24:55.600]  up the next long segment I'm gonna get to some very exciting news it has now
[24:55.600 --> 24:59.720]  come out of the Associated Press Politico and a whole bunch of other
[24:59.720 --> 25:04.560]  newspapers last night and today that yes Rick Perry was the chief of staff and
[25:04.560 --> 25:09.440]  the chairman of Al Gore's campaign in Texas for president now I mean I don't
[25:09.440 --> 25:14.720]  make stuff up and it was you people calling me a George Soros operative for
[25:14.720 --> 25:20.600]  talking about that you got it backwards okay you people you're still gonna try
[25:20.600 --> 25:27.280]  to deny it but it was clearly you know they had the Dallas blog that every day
[25:27.280 --> 25:30.520]  worships Rick Perry come out months ago and basically say I was making all this
[25:30.520 --> 25:36.600]  stuff up as well but it doesn't matter truth comes out even though it's sad but
[25:36.600 --> 25:42.240]  true it comes out and only the truth is going to start setting things right in
[25:42.240 --> 25:46.960]  this country and this world buying into lies and saying that's not true he didn't
[25:46.960 --> 25:50.400]  work for Al Gore that's not true he wasn't for force inoculations that's
[25:50.400 --> 25:54.800]  not true he didn't go to Bilderberg group that's not true he didn't vote for gun
[25:54.800 --> 25:59.280]  control when he was in the Texas legislature that's not true yes it is
[25:59.280 --> 26:05.040]  true it is true and more we're gonna go over it and the fact that the hoax against
[26:05.040 --> 26:08.920]  Ron Paul is backfired in their face and now it's one of the big media issues is
[26:08.920 --> 26:15.360]  why did the media try to basically cover up the Ron Paul candidacy Fox CNN the
[26:15.360 --> 26:20.680]  Daily Show they're all having to talk about it because their people meters went
[26:20.680 --> 26:26.080]  off the charts there was an absolute revolt last Thursday Friday Saturday
[26:26.080 --> 26:33.840]  Sunday and Monday not just by Alex Jones you see I'm just a bell weather I'm
[26:33.840 --> 26:37.800]  like a weather vane on top of your house which way the wind's blowing and I
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.900]  indicate which way people that love Liberty are going okay I don't turn with
[26:42.900 --> 26:48.120]  the wind I always point straight towards Liberty and I see what other people see
[26:48.120 --> 26:55.800]  I get outraged just like you get outraged and this totally backfired on
[26:55.800 --> 27:00.360]  them as I said yesterday on the radio and as I said in the video I shot last
[27:00.360 --> 27:04.200]  night that Aaron stayed up all night to produce I ordered him not to stay up all
[27:04.200 --> 27:07.560]  night I said it can come out the next day if you need to go home and when I left
[27:07.560 --> 27:11.200]  here about 7 30 and I got here this morning and he said the video is
[27:11.200 --> 27:16.360]  completed that's dedication and those of us that love Liberty we have that type
[27:16.360 --> 27:21.240]  of dedication that Aaron Dyches I he will work two days in a row with nothing
[27:21.240 --> 27:27.680]  but coffee and health food powering him I'm very proud of Aaron Aaron and I
[27:27.680 --> 27:31.480]  both have gotten a bit portly over the years and Aaron's probably lost 20 30
[27:31.480 --> 27:35.680]  pounds I'm really really proud of him he's my role model I wish I had the steel
[27:35.680 --> 27:41.040]  will of Aaron really proud of Aaron Dyches it's great to work with him now
[27:41.040 --> 27:45.040]  really proud of this entire crew by the way it is an enjoyment every day to come
[27:45.040 --> 27:48.680]  in here with the great people that work in my office and their love of Liberty
[27:48.680 --> 27:52.440]  and all the different interesting characters that are here I just want to
[27:52.440 --> 27:56.160]  say that my crew is wonderful and you the listeners are part of our crew we're
[27:56.160 --> 28:00.840]  all together side by side in this fight for freedom and the second American
[28:00.840 --> 28:07.040]  Revolution that I call 1776 worldwide and it's time for people who've been on
[28:07.040 --> 28:11.400]  the fence I don't care what political name you give yourself or what your
[28:11.400 --> 28:16.560]  history is it's time for you to choose a side the evidence that this government
[28:16.560 --> 28:21.080]  is bought and paid for and has been hijacked is absolutely overwhelming
[28:21.080 --> 28:27.480]  it's ridiculous if you're still in denial and the the the tenets of our
[28:27.480 --> 28:33.200]  Republic of our founders and their visionary minds use the antidote to the
[28:33.200 --> 28:39.000]  globalist snake bite that we are convulsing under right now and it could
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.440]  all end if we just recognize there's a problem start respecting ourselves
[28:44.440 --> 28:48.840]  believe that we all have power and take action against tyranny now I want to
[28:48.840 --> 28:53.360]  cover the tipping point more now then I'll get into all this news and then open
[28:53.360 --> 29:04.560]  phones bones are not open yet this is a scientist at Rensselaer Polytechnic
[29:04.560 --> 29:10.160]  Institute top statisticians have found and this is what other major studies for
[29:10.160 --> 29:15.240]  hundreds of years have found Gandhi talked about truth going through several
[29:15.240 --> 29:20.560]  stages first it's ignored then they attack you then it's accepted as as
[29:20.560 --> 29:29.720]  just common sense minority rules scientists discover tipping point for
[29:29.720 --> 29:34.520]  the spread of ideas he will their scientists found what humans have known
[29:34.520 --> 29:39.600]  for thousands of years that it is a highly motivated minority whether for
[29:39.600 --> 29:43.320]  evil or good that's going to win the day that's what Thomas Jefferson said it
[29:43.320 --> 29:48.160]  does not take a majority only an irate minority who will not back down and who
[29:48.160 --> 29:55.760]  will not stop we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:27.560 --> 33:36.040]  is falling but it's only when that shield begins to fall that we see the
[33:36.040 --> 33:44.360]  effects and that people begin to wake up and realize just how valuable and
[33:44.360 --> 33:52.840]  absolutely essential it is. All right getting into this latest breakdown and
[33:52.840 --> 33:56.840]  again you can read the founding father quotes about it does not take a majority
[33:56.840 --> 34:02.600]  to prevail but a focused motivated minority with the light of liberty
[34:02.600 --> 34:07.280]  burning in their heart in fact here's a Samuel Adams quote it does not take a
[34:07.280 --> 34:11.800]  majority prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting
[34:11.800 --> 34:17.360]  brush fires of freedom in the minds of men Samuel Adams the Constitution shall
[34:17.360 --> 34:21.600]  never be construed to prevent the people of the United States who are
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.880]  peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms Samuel Adams let's read some
[34:25.880 --> 34:30.640]  more of this evil evil person that FEMA demonizes in their symposiums to
[34:30.640 --> 34:36.120]  police we must indeed all hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang
[34:36.120 --> 34:41.160]  separately Benjamin Franklin anyone who trades liberty for security deserves
[34:41.160 --> 34:45.440]  neither liberty nor security Benjamin Franklin rebellion against tyrants as
[34:45.440 --> 34:50.480]  obedience to God you know that one Benjamin Franklin where liberty is
[34:50.480 --> 34:56.160]  there is my country Benjamin Franklin we give you an Alexander Hamilton quote in
[34:56.160 --> 35:00.200]  framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great
[35:00.200 --> 35:04.520]  difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the
[35:04.520 --> 35:11.600]  governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself and it goes on from
[35:11.600 --> 35:16.040]  there now let me get to this tipping point Ron Paul is only a manifestation of
[35:16.040 --> 35:24.480]  that just like the Sun coming out will heat the ground and plants will turn
[35:24.480 --> 35:33.680]  towards it for photosynthesis the tyranny is causing the response for
[35:33.680 --> 35:39.480]  every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and so as darkness
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.840]  rises goodness is going to rise and the system understands these basic laws the
[35:44.840 --> 35:48.960]  globalists are obsessed with natural law they understand it and manipulate it
[35:48.960 --> 35:53.680]  and subvert it once you're aware of natural law of common sense as it's
[35:53.680 --> 35:59.840]  known popularly it is your lantern it is your light it is your guiding torch to
[35:59.840 --> 36:05.920]  understand what's happening humans act the same over and over again now listen
[36:05.920 --> 36:12.880]  to this Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have found that when just 10% of the
[36:12.880 --> 36:18.560]  population holds an unshakable belief their belief will always be adopted by
[36:18.560 --> 36:23.680]  the majority of the society the scientists who are members of the social
[36:23.680 --> 36:32.320]  cognitive networks academic research center used computational and analytical
[36:32.320 --> 36:36.480]  methods to discover the tipping point where a majority belief becomes the
[36:36.480 --> 36:41.400]  majority opinion the finding as implications for the study and the
[36:41.400 --> 36:45.920]  influence of societal interactions ranging from the spread of innovations
[36:45.920 --> 36:51.080]  to the movement of political ideas when the number of committed opinion holders
[36:51.080 --> 36:56.360]  about fact holders this is distorted information below 10% there is no
[36:56.360 --> 37:01.160]  visible progress in the spread of ideas it would literally take the amount of
[37:01.160 --> 37:05.200]  time comparable to the age of the universe for this size of a group to
[37:05.200 --> 37:16.240]  reach the majority said SCNACR director the Claire and Roland Schmidt designated
[37:16.240 --> 37:22.680]  professor at the university went on to say once that number grows above 10%
[37:22.680 --> 37:27.680]  the idea spreads like flame funny I was just reading the founding father talk
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.880]  about setting brush fires in the minds of men and women oh you guys just
[37:32.880 --> 37:37.160]  discovered did you just discover water was wet did you just discover Marilyn
[37:37.160 --> 37:43.400]  Monroe and her prime look look like an ice cream sundae did you just discover
[37:43.400 --> 37:48.200]  that a fast cars are fun did you just discover black uniforms on police
[37:48.200 --> 37:56.480]  signify you live in a tyranny did you just discover the universe it continues
[37:56.480 --> 37:59.440]  when the number of committed opinion holders is below 10% there is no
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.280]  visible progress in the spread of the ideas once that number grows above 10
[38:03.280 --> 38:08.640]  percent the idea spreads like flame and that's why the technocrats have built
[38:08.640 --> 38:11.760]  this control grid police state that's why they've had to use chemicals in the
[38:11.760 --> 38:15.240]  food and water in the GMO that's why they've had to use the television to try
[38:15.240 --> 38:19.840]  to dump people down that's why they've had to psychically and societally and
[38:19.840 --> 38:25.160]  socially attack everyone to dehumanize you because only a group of
[38:25.160 --> 38:32.480]  adult zombies cognitively poisoned can be led by this unnatural system and
[38:32.480 --> 38:38.560]  that's why I hate tyranny so much is that it overruns the strong it overruns
[38:38.560 --> 38:44.480]  the creative it attacks the leaders it attacks the beautiful because the the
[38:44.480 --> 38:48.760]  control freaks are like a cancer they're not dominant they're malfunctioning
[38:48.760 --> 38:55.600]  they don't hold beauty in high esteem they don't honor it their spirit their
[38:55.600 --> 39:00.840]  soul their intellect does not commune with all that is good they see beauty as
[39:00.840 --> 39:08.040]  ugly they want to pull it down I studied history I studied their psychological
[39:08.040 --> 39:12.480]  makeup in every case in history these these particularly nasty elites do
[39:12.480 --> 39:15.560]  this sometimes you get a philosopher king I'm always against kings of
[39:15.560 --> 39:19.040]  centralized power but sometimes you get a king who discovers beauty and
[39:19.040 --> 39:24.480]  discovers humanity and society and those are times when societies flourish
[39:24.480 --> 39:30.200]  like nothing you've seen but it's very rare and that person always falls
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.600]  because the levers are seen by the tyrants and the control freaks under
[39:34.600 --> 39:39.240]  them those that simply seek power for power sake who want to press blindly on
[39:39.240 --> 39:44.240]  the nerve of power they will overthrow anything centralized and so a
[39:44.240 --> 39:49.560]  philosopher king the wise king and it's happened many times in history is still
[39:49.560 --> 39:56.200]  extremely rare and it's transient it it it's like lightning in a jar it it it
[39:56.200 --> 40:02.920]  flashes and is gone only a generally educated and informed populace in
[40:02.920 --> 40:09.160]  science mathematics beauty literature music history the love and desire to
[40:09.160 --> 40:15.000]  build and to honor creativity and honorableness that will build a system
[40:15.000 --> 40:22.360]  that will take us to the stars and beyond and beyond the subatomic all of it
[40:22.360 --> 40:27.120]  we're already unlocking the secrets of the universe we've only begun to learn
[40:27.120 --> 40:32.720]  we've only begun to even imagine the incredible power that our species is
[40:32.720 --> 40:38.880]  capable of the globalist at least 30 years advanced are still mere children
[40:38.880 --> 40:43.600]  despite the fact that they have even more advanced secrets just because they
[40:43.600 --> 40:46.760]  cold-bloodily understand how humanity operates and have created this
[40:46.760 --> 40:52.080]  artificial habitat to control us does it mean that they still aren't influenced
[40:52.080 --> 40:59.960]  in blowback by the societal poisoning that they've engaged in and so now
[40:59.960 --> 41:04.320]  you've got psychopathic groups with armies of sociopath control freaks
[41:04.320 --> 41:10.560]  under them and the mental midgets that also serve them in the lower rooms in
[41:10.560 --> 41:16.040]  control of what can only be described as super science systems believing that
[41:16.040 --> 41:21.880]  they're cold-bloodily executing this when they're the opposite of cold-blooded
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.200]  you people are going to destroy yourselves you're not just going to
[41:27.200 --> 41:31.680]  destroy us you can't destroy the general public without destroying yourselves
[41:31.680 --> 41:36.360]  have you not learned history no matter how powerful your genetic engineering
[41:36.360 --> 41:42.000]  no matter how powerful your computers no matter how powerful your systems I
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.840]  don't care that Google can predict mass movements down to almost 100% of course
[41:46.840 --> 41:51.920]  that's what DARPA built it for I told you 15 years ago I knew it was a crystal
[41:51.920 --> 41:57.960]  ball what do you think that's crystal balls gonna do it's gonna destroy you
[41:57.960 --> 42:05.000]  along with us you people aren't gods and you're not meant to be gods and
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.800]  humanity is only crawling right now could humanity in the future control these
[42:11.800 --> 42:18.240]  systems assuredly yes but not until there's real leadership that doesn't
[42:18.240 --> 42:22.600]  seek to dumb down and destroy but seeks to unleash the fires of liberty and
[42:22.600 --> 42:29.640]  stand back in awe at what humans can do I admire strength and beauty I admire
[42:29.640 --> 42:36.920]  creativity I admire art I admire people doing better than I do when someone's
[42:36.920 --> 42:42.120]  better-looking than I are smarter than I I don't get I'm not disgusted by them
[42:42.120 --> 42:48.720]  I'm not envious or jealous I admire them because they're a human and so am I and
[42:48.720 --> 42:55.840]  it's that type of understanding that is going to free this species we have the
[42:55.840 --> 43:01.920]  worst of our people running things who have graduated by degree in the crimes
[43:01.920 --> 43:07.500]  against humanity they've committed until they now are a charnel house or
[43:07.500 --> 43:12.240]  jeeing in corruption trying to one-up each other on how ruthless and blood
[43:12.240 --> 43:17.920]  thirsty and sickening they are the art houses in New York and Berlin and Paris
[43:17.920 --> 43:25.440]  for decades the most popular highest selling art is the most vile ugly
[43:25.440 --> 43:33.840]  things you can imagine and the elite battle with each other to own the most
[43:33.840 --> 43:39.520]  sickening disgusting frivolous art they can because it's part of a sick debasing
[43:39.520 --> 43:46.120]  it's part of tithing to evil tithing to ugliness they're not stupid to pay 55
[43:46.120 --> 43:51.760]  million dollars for a skull well upside down crosses painted on it and
[43:51.760 --> 43:57.520]  crusted with diamonds they're doing it to to to worship the dark energy they've
[43:57.520 --> 44:05.520]  given themselves over to and it is your inability out there to unclothe these
[44:05.520 --> 44:09.600]  people and all you got to do is open your eyes they're not cloaked all you
[44:09.600 --> 44:14.040]  got to do is put the sunglasses on the spiritual psychological survival
[44:14.040 --> 44:19.080]  instinct glasses and go with your gut go with your intuition go with history
[44:19.080 --> 44:24.240]  with common sense and you will suddenly see them for what they are and it is
[44:24.240 --> 44:30.600]  disgusting and pathetic but I look at Rick Perry I don't see someone powerful
[44:30.600 --> 44:41.200]  and strong I see a a a crone a a wraith a a stilted jilted owned twisted empty
[44:41.200 --> 44:47.480]  vessel up for dust I see the same thing with Obama a prancing teleprompter
[44:47.480 --> 44:56.400]  reading joke I can see them what do they say and they live I got one that can see
[44:56.400 --> 45:04.640]  it's so easy to see but you've got to be ready to face what you see once you
[45:04.640 --> 45:12.200]  open your mind's eye you have to be ready all I'm offerings the truth
[45:12.200 --> 45:25.360]  nothing more you take the blue pill and you go back to where you were and all of
[45:25.360 --> 45:33.760]  this is forgotten and it's just a dream you take the red pill and we go down the
[45:33.760 --> 45:41.760]  rabbit hole but as you reach for the red pill remember all I'm offerings the
[45:41.760 --> 45:48.320]  truth nothing more we have let evil run rampant and take over every facet of
[45:48.320 --> 45:54.160]  society we have taught ourselves that corruption and ugliness is sexy and
[45:54.160 --> 46:02.320]  powerful and cool because it's aberrant we have sold ourselves on bondage that
[46:02.320 --> 46:05.920]  it's trendy to go with the flow
[46:09.840 --> 46:16.160]  some people get freaked out by this radio show and they should but don't get
[46:16.160 --> 46:20.680]  freaked out and despair this is the great challenge you should think your
[46:20.680 --> 46:28.480]  lucky stars that you are alive right now and part of this great challenge you are
[46:28.480 --> 46:36.400]  alive at the beginning of the greatest conflict and challenge that our species
[46:36.400 --> 46:45.600]  and this planet has ever seen the future destiny of our species and all those
[46:45.600 --> 46:50.920]  that came before us and all the seven billion alive today and all of the
[46:50.920 --> 46:58.160]  trillions to come at the birth of our species the true next level of where
[46:58.160 --> 47:09.240]  we're going we are here at that jump point we are here at that crossroads the
[47:09.240 --> 47:17.680]  globalist look out across the seas of time and they see the empowering
[47:17.680 --> 47:24.440]  opportunities of uplifting humanity but because of their fallen nature they seek
[47:24.440 --> 47:33.080]  to covet this information for themselves lest you get it and they no longer be
[47:33.080 --> 47:35.520]  in power
[47:39.400 --> 47:46.120]  but they will never be able to attain those heights that they can see if they
[47:46.120 --> 47:58.360]  do not repent and change their ways they will not go forward they are barred they
[47:58.360 --> 48:08.680]  are blocked they are damned by their own decisions they will not go forward into
[48:08.680 --> 48:15.480]  the future the pit that the technocrats have dug for humanity is a pit that they
[48:15.480 --> 48:23.280]  are at the bottom of only by turning with knowledge and love and honor and
[48:23.280 --> 48:34.200]  goodness does this species have any hope of obtaining the unattainable and that
[48:34.200 --> 48:46.360]  is survival following the course of the controllers leads us to certain doom doom
[48:46.360 --> 49:03.960]  is more than a word doom is so much more doom is complete doom is forever
