[00:00.000 --> 00:14.400]  big brother mainstream media big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you
[00:14.400 --> 00:23.000]  want answers well so does he live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[00:23.000 --> 00:32.720]  Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is Easter hard to believe hard to believe
[00:32.720 --> 00:38.920]  ladies and gentlemen 2016 and I am sitting here on Friday afternoon good
[00:38.920 --> 00:43.520]  Lord knows what's happened since then taping part of the broadcast today we're
[00:43.520 --> 00:47.920]  almost always live and teleprompter free we're pretty much live here I've got a
[00:47.920 --> 00:50.840]  bunch of articles I want to go over and a whole bunch of what I think are the
[00:50.840 --> 00:55.360]  most informative pertinent interviews we've done the last few months Stefan
[00:55.360 --> 01:00.160]  Malinu on the truth about Islam I mean what it is what it's become the things
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.520]  it does if any other group was doing something like this we'd call them a
[01:04.520 --> 01:08.680]  basically you know somebody from the movie saw or something I mean it's just
[01:08.680 --> 01:11.640]  out of control and I'm not putting up with it well these political correct
[01:11.640 --> 01:15.560]  folks telling me to bow down to it the atheists want to bash Christians all day
[01:15.560 --> 01:19.560]  okay whatever that's your free speech but stop defending radical Islam that's
[01:19.560 --> 01:23.760]  dominating and intimidating and bullying the rest of Islam and then they got
[01:23.760 --> 01:27.440]  criticized saying there is no nice Islam now there've been periods where Islam has
[01:27.440 --> 01:32.720]  actually been a positive force mainline historians will tell you that but my
[01:32.720 --> 01:36.480]  goodness what it is right now is like a good case of brain cancer something you
[01:36.480 --> 01:42.960]  do not want so Stefan Malinu is coming up Pastor David Manning or James David
[01:42.960 --> 01:47.520]  Manning will be joining us a Tim Kennedy the famous black op commander famous for
[01:47.520 --> 01:52.320]  UFC and other stuff and for rewriting the Army's close quarters combat manual
[01:52.320 --> 01:55.840]  but his exploits are secret I'll just tell you this people in the military say
[01:55.840 --> 02:00.600]  he's like double tough compared even like a Chris Kyle who they say is the
[02:00.600 --> 02:04.440]  super soldier well this is the real super soldier he'll get mad about say
[02:04.440 --> 02:08.880]  that and whether you like these wars or not it's an expression of male prowess
[02:08.880 --> 02:13.760]  and human potential the levels some of these special operators get to he is the
[02:13.760 --> 02:17.840]  best the best and a listener and a patriot and exposing the new world
[02:17.840 --> 02:20.720]  order so before you bitch at the military for serving the globalists
[02:20.720 --> 02:25.280]  they're figuring that out they're one of our biggest aces in the hole against the
[02:25.280 --> 02:28.640]  new world or takeover so people that had our military you've joined the globalist
[02:28.640 --> 02:32.080]  and the top of homeland security who says our number one threat is returning
[02:32.080 --> 02:38.280]  veterans patriots gun owners and stuff like that you're basically working for
[02:38.280 --> 02:42.440]  the other side and then Lou Rockwell who's been pointing out the west is
[02:42.440 --> 02:46.080]  committing suicide right now he's gonna be joining us Ron Paul's former chief of
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.480]  staff on the top libertarians in the world we got Doug Hagman on the plans
[02:50.480 --> 02:54.320]  by Hillary and others basically try to race war in this country that's coming
[02:54.320 --> 02:57.760]  up and then a big interview I did with Jesse Ventura on war crimes torture
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.520]  potential presidential run and a lot more is coming up in the transmission but
[03:03.520 --> 03:07.640]  the first two big segments is the first mini segment but the next two long
[03:07.640 --> 03:13.960]  segments I am about to come back from break and just plow in to this drudge
[03:13.960 --> 03:19.680]  on Friday had that amazing headline of Hillary with a photo of her Photoshop is
[03:19.680 --> 03:27.120]  an alien saying she will expose area 51 she will give you all the big secrets of
[03:27.120 --> 03:31.040]  what's really going on there and then we got a flashback of Bill Clinton coming
[03:31.040 --> 03:36.240]  out saying he would be surprised the aliens existed well here's the deal
[03:36.240 --> 03:40.360]  these psychopaths that run our planets are alien compared to most humans and
[03:40.360 --> 03:44.160]  that's our real alien problem here I use it as an allegory that they're falling
[03:44.160 --> 03:47.960]  angels from another star system the media has a hissy fit about it but
[03:47.960 --> 03:51.600]  whenever Hillary says she thinks aliens are real or Bill Clinton says then it's
[03:51.600 --> 03:56.560]  okay well I'm gonna break down after the break first up what I think is really
[03:56.560 --> 04:00.760]  going on with that situation and then we're gonna get into political
[04:00.760 --> 04:08.320]  correctness coming up this ish tarry in holiday dropping Easter from eggs stirs
[04:08.320 --> 04:16.600]  culture war in the UK this is from what it's in USA today the Daily Mail you
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.720]  name it canterbury England the home of the canterbury ish star egg ish tar egg
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.240]  the ish tar bunny they don't like it because it's Christian we give you a
[04:27.240 --> 04:32.120]  newsflash it's a cultic and they put all the Christian holidays on a cultic days
[04:32.120 --> 04:36.680]  so all you a cultist wanting to control free speech and rewrite the calendar and
[04:36.680 --> 04:41.080]  all the rest of stuff for your Lord and Savior beelzebub you want to be very
[04:41.080 --> 04:47.120]  pleased that the ish tarry in holiday of fertility but you're too stupid to do
[04:47.120 --> 04:51.240]  that that's your master controllers aren't it's all coming up a big
[04:51.240 --> 04:56.520]  broadcast it's a big world it's a big show and each of us players upon it
[04:56.520 --> 05:05.240]  I'm Alex I've got a lot of things on my plate but my top priority is to defeat
[05:05.240 --> 05:13.720]  ISIL and to eliminate the scourge and indeed Obama has been very busy this
[05:13.720 --> 05:18.280]  week playing dominoes doing the wave at a baseball game and dancing the tango
[05:18.280 --> 05:23.240]  oh and rewriting history by telling a group of Argentinians that there is a
[05:23.240 --> 05:27.680]  little difference between communism and capitalism say what Obama went on to
[05:27.680 --> 05:31.960]  praise Cuba's socialist system under dictator Raul Castro he touted the
[05:31.960 --> 05:35.760]  country's free access to basic education and health care although he
[05:35.760 --> 05:39.760]  acknowledged that Havana itself looks like it did in the 1950s because the
[05:39.760 --> 05:43.680]  economy is not working indeed that's one of the great achievements of
[05:43.680 --> 05:48.320]  capitalism innovation if you want to school your friends once and for all on
[05:48.320 --> 05:52.720]  the difference between communism and capitalism visit the Alex Jones YouTube
[05:52.720 --> 05:57.240]  channel and share the video why capitalism is great Leanne McAdoo
[05:57.240 --> 06:00.840]  reporting for info wars.com
[06:03.800 --> 06:09.760]  stand up and recount it for those who are about to receive we now take you live
[06:09.760 --> 06:17.680]  to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance rallying
[06:17.680 --> 06:31.160]  patriots worldwide. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Some would say this broadcast is the death
[06:31.160 --> 06:39.560]  rows of the American Republic. If you've all attempt a last desperate defense. Others would say it's the birth
[06:39.560 --> 06:46.400]  pains and the rebirth of the Republic. The great flower of the Renaissance. As war
[06:46.400 --> 06:51.440]  covered and ugly as it is. It's dedication and love of humanity and
[06:51.440 --> 06:56.920]  free will. It's beautiful on the eyes of God. Thank you for joining us on this
[06:56.920 --> 07:26.840]  Easter. Let's crank it up. Stand up and recount it. Use which side you're on. We are the dealers. We are the dealers. You're giving everything you need. Listen to that voice. That's fury.
[07:26.840 --> 07:38.640]  For those about to stand up for humanity, I salute you. All right, here's the deal. It is Easter 2016. I'm your host
[07:38.640 --> 07:41.920]  Alex Jones. We've got a lot of key interviews coming up today with Stefan
[07:41.920 --> 07:46.000]  Malinu, Pastor James David Manning, Tim Kennedy, the black cop commander, Lou
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.520]  Rockwell, one of the top libertarians in the world, Doug Hagman, big insider with
[07:50.520 --> 07:54.360]  the federal intel that's been proven to be spot on. Jesse Ventura, you know who
[07:54.360 --> 07:58.560]  he is. Let me introduce him and more on this special Easter global
[07:58.560 --> 08:03.440]  transmission. I want to go to a special report first off that I shot on
[08:03.440 --> 08:07.720]  Friday. This is very powerful. Our story got posted on drugsreport.com went viral.
[08:07.720 --> 08:14.280]  But I'll be honest, we had last time I checked the metrics only like 400 plus
[08:14.280 --> 08:19.160]  thousand readers of the info wars.com article. That sounds big. It gets copied
[08:19.160 --> 08:22.200]  thousands of other sites. So who knows how big it really got. I would imagine
[08:22.200 --> 08:25.720]  millions ended up reading and I know millions saw me and listened to us
[08:25.720 --> 08:29.920]  cover it on the Friday show. But Obama coming out and saying there's basically
[08:29.920 --> 08:33.800]  quote little, there's quote little difference between communism and
[08:33.800 --> 08:40.200]  capitalism. That is such a big deal. And I titled the video that's up on
[08:40.200 --> 08:44.160]  info wars.com. If you want to make it go viral and resist this unbelievable evil.
[08:44.160 --> 08:54.840]  Obama endorses system that killed 200 million people 200 million. That's 10
[08:54.840 --> 09:02.840]  sports stadiums filled with 100,000 people 200 times. I'm gonna say that
[09:02.840 --> 09:07.320]  again to wrap your mind around it because Stalin said one man dies is
[09:07.320 --> 09:13.800]  statistic. 10,000 dies. No, no one man dies is a tragedy. Telecom free one man
[09:13.800 --> 09:18.560]  dies. It is a tragedy. 10,000 died. It's a statistic. And that's true. You talk
[09:18.560 --> 09:24.720]  about 200 million people admittedly killed by communist in the 20th
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.560]  century alone ongoing in communist China and Cuba. So the numbers are even
[09:28.560 --> 09:36.400]  bigger now. University of Hawaii did a big study on it on democide more than a
[09:36.400 --> 09:45.280]  decade ago and found in 2005 that in the previous 100 years, 260 plus million
[09:45.280 --> 09:51.040]  people were killed. Fascists and other dictators 60 something million, but 200
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.360]  plus million killed by communist. And here's the president going, Oh, just
[09:55.360 --> 09:58.880]  picked some things from communism and some things from capitalism and
[09:58.880 --> 10:05.640]  whatever works. I heard that over and over again in college because that's
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.480]  how they square big multinational corporations above the law tax exempt
[10:09.480 --> 10:13.160]  diplomatic community running and financing communist countries with a
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.280]  bunch of slave laborers to then sell those goods to somewhat still free
[10:17.280 --> 10:23.000]  countries, which are only using the free market goods they're getting to
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.040]  politically get power and raise more money to buy off the politicians in the
[10:27.040 --> 10:31.560]  quote free countries to exploit and take over that labor force and enslave them
[10:31.560 --> 10:36.200]  as well. Nobody's got a history of abusing families and women and children
[10:36.200 --> 10:43.640]  and workers like communist, but that's okay because the big robber barons that
[10:43.640 --> 10:48.640]  run our universities and run our high schools and run our systems condition us
[10:48.640 --> 10:53.800]  that communism is the sweetest most loving thing. In fact, children at birth
[10:53.800 --> 10:58.840]  don't have mammary glands from their mother to get milk. Communist, a fairy
[10:58.840 --> 11:03.000]  flies down the island and gives the babies milk. That's our God. That's our
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.600]  savior. That's our king. Let's go to the special report where I break it all down.
[11:06.600 --> 11:09.440]  Then I'm going to come back and talk about that fruitcake Hillary Clinton
[11:09.440 --> 11:12.960]  talking about area 51.
[11:20.080 --> 11:28.440]  Fellow freedom lovers, in my 21 years on air, I have never seen a single event
[11:28.440 --> 11:36.320]  that was a more frightening bellwether of how much trouble western
[11:36.320 --> 11:42.760]  civilization and what's left of free market capitalism is actually in. We are
[11:42.760 --> 11:50.000]  in so much trouble. Obama yesterday in Argentina, part of his Latin American
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.560]  tour that started in Cuba, said quote, there's little difference between
[11:53.560 --> 11:59.800]  communism and capitalism. Just yesterday, before I even knew he'd said this, I said
[11:59.800 --> 12:03.880]  that in latter stage communism, you have one party state where the generals and
[12:03.880 --> 12:08.960]  the inner party own the means of production, live like kings and everyone
[12:08.960 --> 12:13.600]  else for slaves. This is what communism always turns into. This is the goal of
[12:13.600 --> 12:17.960]  communism since it began, not with Ingalls and Marx, but with the Jacobins
[12:17.960 --> 12:22.160]  and the French Revolution. Real communist history is not even taught in regular
[12:22.160 --> 12:26.600]  college, but in advanced PhD levels, it's there. Look it up for yourself. Think
[12:26.600 --> 12:30.840]  about this, 200 million people conservatively who were non-military, men,
[12:30.840 --> 12:36.080]  women and children, were killed under communism in the 20th century. China has
[12:36.080 --> 12:40.320]  mobile execution vans and kills Buddhist for practicing their religion and
[12:40.320 --> 12:46.280]  sells their organs. Our media doesn't even criticize this anymore. On TV, on ESPN,
[12:46.280 --> 12:49.880]  and on other news channels, people were being drug away for peacefully
[12:49.880 --> 12:55.200]  protesting and beat up in Cuba. And they would laugh on ESPN and other shows. And
[12:55.200 --> 12:59.120]  it was no big deal that people were being drug away for free speech, saying
[12:59.120 --> 13:04.600]  liberty down with the Castro's, the dictator's show. And our president goes
[13:04.600 --> 13:09.080]  out and says there's quote, little difference we can borrow from both. What
[13:09.080 --> 13:12.640]  the forced labor camps, do we borrow that? The empty store shelves, do we borrow
[13:12.640 --> 13:16.440]  that? The shopping malls for the elite, but stores for the public, just a pile of
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.320]  potatoes. And Argentina, just 60 years ago, was even richer per capita in the
[13:21.320 --> 13:25.000]  U.S. It was a saying, riches in Argentine. But after they wondered
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.880]  globalism and had managed capitalism, they're now incredibly poor. And he sits
[13:29.880 --> 13:33.360]  up there to an educated group and says there's little difference we should
[13:33.360 --> 13:36.960]  borrow from both. He said, it's good to have free market multi-nationally, but
[13:36.960 --> 13:40.360]  not in the country. See, multi-nationally, the globalists are above the law
[13:40.360 --> 13:45.640]  tax exempt. They come in, they want to work with communist systems. The CIA
[13:45.640 --> 13:50.400]  admits they're rather a dictator, a communist, or a fascist. But communism is
[13:50.400 --> 13:53.480]  the model they're going with. It's not communism. The way they teach it in
[13:53.480 --> 13:57.120]  school, oh, everything's free and everything's happy. That's not how this
[13:57.120 --> 14:00.600]  works. We're going to play some of these clips for you right now, but this is
[14:00.600 --> 14:04.880]  unprecedented. It's so dangerous. This is like the president saying there's not
[14:04.880 --> 14:08.480]  much difference between capitalism and fascism, except fascism has only killed
[14:08.480 --> 14:13.360]  50, 60 million people, not 200 million, mal-killed 80 plus million. Look it up
[14:13.360 --> 14:17.320]  yourself. This is from an American president who tells Africans they can't
[14:17.320 --> 14:21.080]  have cars and air conditioning while he flies around on a jumbo jet. This is the
[14:21.080 --> 14:25.560]  new communism, ultra-rich tax exempt above the law, and you in a slave factory or
[14:25.560 --> 14:29.640]  a slave farm. I'm Alex Jones for infowars.com. Get this video and this
[14:29.640 --> 14:36.160]  report out to everybody. So often in the past, there's been a sharp division
[14:36.160 --> 14:43.600]  between left and right, between capitalist and communist or socialist, and
[14:43.600 --> 14:50.400]  especially in the Americas, that's been a big debate, right? Ah, you know, you're
[14:50.400 --> 14:57.640]  a capitalist, Yankee dog, and oh, you know, you're some, you know, crazy
[14:57.640 --> 15:05.040]  communist, you know, that's going to take away everybody's property. And I mean,
[15:05.040 --> 15:10.520]  those are in interesting intellectual arguments, but I think for your
[15:10.520 --> 15:17.040]  generation, you should be practical and just choose from what works. You don't
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.920]  have to worry about whether it neatly fits into socialist theory or capitalist
[15:22.920 --> 15:36.960]  theory, you just decide what works.
[15:52.920 --> 15:58.960]  You're listening to Alex Jones.

[16:59.520 --> 17:01.040]  Hey, how you doing? Good, brother.
[17:01.040 --> 17:04.680]  Just recently started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct.
[17:04.680 --> 17:08.800]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[17:08.800 --> 17:12.040]  Well, thank you, brother. It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that,
[17:12.040 --> 17:13.680]  I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[17:13.680 --> 17:19.680]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[17:19.680 --> 17:24.240]  instead of using synthetic chemicals. We do the supermail and the superfemale
[17:24.240 --> 17:28.840]  vitality. Big changes, a lot of energy. We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks,
[17:28.840 --> 17:34.120]  energy shots, statement, ton of money there. Sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[17:34.120 --> 17:39.240]  harvested around the planet, and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[17:39.240 --> 17:43.800]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while,
[17:43.800 --> 17:48.440]  but then burn you out. In my experience, where stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[17:48.440 --> 17:51.320]  goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting, and I love it.

[18:02.360 --> 18:07.160]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear
[18:07.160 --> 18:13.560]  the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[18:13.560 --> 18:19.920]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[18:19.920 --> 18:25.480]  of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for
[18:25.480 --> 18:31.160]  quiet war. Pathenogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy
[18:31.160 --> 18:36.400]  our vitality. Turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[18:36.400 --> 18:43.760]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic,

[20:02.360 --> 20:06.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:06.720 --> 20:16.320]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future. Not a future
[20:16.320 --> 20:22.840]  that will be but one that might be. This is not a new world. It is simply an extension
[20:22.840 --> 20:29.080]  of what began in the old one. It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted
[20:29.080 --> 20:34.480]  the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time. It
[20:34.480 --> 20:40.440]  has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[20:40.440 --> 20:46.320]  of human freedom. But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one
[20:46.320 --> 20:53.320]  iron rule. Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[20:53.320 --> 21:08.320]  An answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[21:08.320 --> 21:14.320]  Man, I forgot how epic that liner is and I think it's only on the computer in this
[21:14.320 --> 21:21.160]  studio. When we're in this situation room doing the Sunday show today, not in the big
[21:21.160 --> 21:27.320]  war room, we have got to put that in. It's like the main intro. Rod Serling. What a lover
[21:27.320 --> 21:32.760]  of liberty. You know, that guy himself. We got Tim Kennedy, an amazing veteran of so many
[21:32.760 --> 21:37.640]  tours. It's pretty much all secret. Let's just say this. He's beyond Chris Kyle when
[21:37.640 --> 21:42.440]  it comes to his exploits. Not just in snipering but hand-to-hand stuff. You name it. Wrote the
[21:42.440 --> 21:46.760]  book on close quarters combat for the army. He literally wrote the new book on it. He's
[21:46.760 --> 21:53.280]  going to be joining us. But wow, a good friend. But I'm sitting here. Listen to Rod Serling
[21:53.280 --> 21:57.600]  who was a commando in World War II, behind enemy lines. A lot of that's classified. He
[21:57.600 --> 22:02.640]  was such an enemy of communism and fascism and socialism. Poor guy died of lung cancer
[22:02.640 --> 22:09.040]  too young and he was just so upset about the direction he saw America going. And to hear
[22:09.040 --> 22:16.160]  our president promoting communism that killed 200 plus million people. I tell you, I got
[22:16.160 --> 22:21.080]  up Friday morning and saw Paul Watson's article on infowars.com and I said, that's sensational.
[22:21.080 --> 22:24.720]  Nobody else has picked this up. And I said, I'm going to type in drudgereport.com, the
[22:24.720 --> 22:28.640]  total newshound, and I bet money it's on drudge. And boom, there it was. One of the top stories
[22:28.640 --> 22:32.920]  on drudge. And that gave me some hope. It's like we're battling this period of evil. But
[22:32.920 --> 22:40.920]  what is the president doing just openly saying this? It's truly sickening. And selling the
[22:40.920 --> 22:46.160]  worst final phase of communism where we need multinationals that are tax exempt above everything,
[22:46.160 --> 22:51.720]  but we need the country with the slaves to be communist. Let me get into the other news
[22:51.720 --> 22:57.400]  here in this segment. Attacks on free space is just ongoing. This is from USA Today, dropping
[22:57.400 --> 23:04.280]  Easter from eggs stirs culture war in the UK. Canterbury, you know, those little chocolate
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.720]  covered eggs, they're delicious, but you give you a big headache, sugar crash. If you want
[23:08.720 --> 23:12.960]  demonic children, you know, that's, that's all that Easter is about is high blood sugar
[23:12.960 --> 23:19.080]  and then low blood sugar. Chocolate manufacturers in the UK have removed the word Easter from
[23:19.080 --> 23:23.560]  holiday egg candy that has delighted millions of children for generations, just like they're
[23:23.560 --> 23:28.600]  living Christ from Christmas. But there's no war on Christian holidays, but a demand
[23:28.600 --> 23:33.760]  that manufacturers put Easter back on the package of chocolate eggs has become the latest culture
[23:33.760 --> 23:40.320]  war on the issue on the eve of Christianity's most important holiday, which falls on March
[23:40.320 --> 23:48.000]  27th, which is today. It's deeply disappointing and shameful that some of the biggest companies,
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.920]  including Canterbury, Cadbury and Nestle are censoring the country's old tradition, said
[23:54.920 --> 24:01.680]  David Marshall, CEO of the Meaningful Chocolate Co, a group that set out to attempt to reintroduce
[24:01.680 --> 24:07.160]  Easter eggs and advent calendars featuring nativity scenes. Listen, just leave Nestle.
[24:07.160 --> 24:11.280]  Nestle was based in the US. It's based in Mexico now. I'm not against Mexico, but it
[24:11.280 --> 24:18.720]  just shows how these companies could care less. Okay. And they dump their high fructose
[24:18.720 --> 24:22.920]  corn syrup garbage on everyone. One good thing about Mexico is everything they produce
[24:22.920 --> 24:28.160]  there has sugar in it. But what they make for the dumb gringos has the high fructose
[24:28.160 --> 24:34.240]  corn syrup. Mexicans won't buy something with it in Mexico because they know. So here, here's
[24:34.240 --> 24:41.440]  the Mexico. At least they're not as dumb as we are, but this just shows the total and complete
[24:41.440 --> 24:45.880]  assault. I remember 10 years ago, hear about the war on Christmas where they'd find girls
[24:45.880 --> 24:49.080]  giving out Christmas cars in a public school and they'd say, you're going to be arrested
[24:49.080 --> 24:54.020]  or kicked out. That's violation of church and state. But the school doesn't have an
[24:54.020 --> 25:01.080]  official religion. You can go talk about Pokemon, the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus or Jesus Christ
[25:01.080 --> 25:07.160]  or Bath-O-Met if you want. But again, this is political correctness, targeting Christians,
[25:07.160 --> 25:11.600]  targeting others saying, you know, you have no free speech. If you criticize suicide bombers
[25:11.600 --> 25:16.340]  in England now, they send the police out to arrest you. This is intimidation. This is
[25:16.340 --> 25:21.080]  massive attacks. And this is out of control. And I'm not going to put up with it anymore.
[25:21.080 --> 25:28.880]  The way to counter this is to never buy a Nestle product again and to go out there and find
[25:28.880 --> 25:34.200]  the higher quality chocolate makers and others that are promoting Christ, because this is
[25:34.200 --> 25:39.120]  our holiday. And by the way, I'm not blaming the Roman Catholic Church. I'm not a Pharisee.
[25:39.120 --> 25:44.760]  I'm not on some high horse. Christmas was put on a pagan holiday on the Roman calendar,
[25:44.760 --> 25:50.640]  the Deep of Winter. Halloween is a high satanic or druidic human sacrifice day. The Catholics
[25:50.640 --> 25:55.880]  wanted to get rid of that. So they made all Saints Day to cover up Salwan or Sam Hain.
[25:55.880 --> 26:02.440]  Ishtar, Easter, Babylonian, you name it, it predates Christianity. It's as old as the
[26:02.440 --> 26:08.160]  Pharaohs in Egypt, probably older. It's the bunny, the fertility, you know, Playboy magazine,
[26:08.160 --> 26:11.920]  the bunny, the bunnies, you know, they have lots of babies, they have lots of sex. They
[26:11.920 --> 26:19.240]  just put the time that Christ rose on another date to cover up pagan holidays. So you idiots
[26:19.240 --> 26:22.360]  trying to get rid of Christianity don't even know that you're actually trying to get rid
[26:22.360 --> 26:26.080]  of a pagan holiday. But I'm not saying when I celebrate Easter, like I did today with
[26:26.080 --> 26:31.280]  my family, that I am devil worshiping. God knows that it's about celebrating his son.
[26:31.280 --> 26:35.520]  And if he got put on that date, big deal. Let's worry about them selling baby parts
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.920]  and abortion and Chinese mobile execution vans and Obama saying communism is good. And
[26:40.920 --> 26:44.800]  our government funding ISIS, before we look at other Christians and say, Hey, you're a
[26:44.800 --> 26:49.520]  moron, you're celebrating Ishtar and the Easter egg and all the rest of it on this holiday.
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.960]  The Tannenbaum is an ancient druidic evergreen tree. They worship because they thought it
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.800]  didn't die during the winter. They were praying for the sun to come back, freezing their butt
[26:57.800 --> 27:02.840]  off and little huts and caves. It's beautiful. I love it. It's part of, it's part of European
[27:02.840 --> 27:08.680]  culture. It's like day of the dead in Mexico. That's not some Satanic holiday. That's about
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.440]  remembering your ancestors. And again, it's on the day before Halloween, because the basically
[27:13.440 --> 27:17.360]  the Catholics put it on that date to, to, to, you know, to erase some of the stuff going
[27:17.360 --> 27:23.040]  on in Mesoamerica, but it doesn't matter. It's as long as you love justice and love
[27:23.040 --> 27:28.880]  life and love God, Christ was not a Pharisee as Sadducee up there criticizing everyone
[27:28.880 --> 27:33.040]  like the church was at the time. He was saying, get right with God, do unto others as you
[27:33.040 --> 27:37.560]  have them do unto you, be a good person, stand up for life. And he was hanging around with,
[27:37.560 --> 27:41.080]  you know, reformed tax collectors and prostitutes. He wasn't hanging around with a bunch of the
[27:41.080 --> 27:46.080]  fake priests who later wanted him killed. Others would make him king. Others wouldn't stand
[27:46.080 --> 27:51.440]  for that. So you know what they did. So that's what this comes down to on Easter. Now, separately
[27:51.440 --> 27:56.000]  I mentioned this and just briefly, big news with Hillary Clinton came out on the campaign
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.840]  trail and said she would release whatever's at area 51 and let the public know and put
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.600]  all the conspiracy theories to rest. Bill Clinton said he wouldn't be surprised if aliens existed.
[28:04.600 --> 28:08.800]  That's just attention grabbing headlines. Folks, we know what's at area 51. It's been
[28:08.800 --> 28:13.720]  pretty much declassified. It was a B1 and B2 bomber and other stealth bomber training
[28:13.720 --> 28:19.240]  base. They've since moved it to other areas, okay, in Colorado and other areas. Mainly
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.600]  what it is is a toxic waste dump where they've been covering up what's happening and she
[28:23.600 --> 28:28.600]  wants to act like she's exposing all the secrets when she comes out, quote, as president and
[28:28.600 --> 28:34.520]  tells you what's at area 51. It's a metaphor or a symbol of her claiming she's going to
[28:34.520 --> 28:39.720]  be truthful with you when she lied about fast and furious, Benghazi, cattle futures and
[28:39.720 --> 28:43.360]  everything else she's done and getting billions from dictators at the State Department with
[28:43.360 --> 28:49.760]  their foundation. So it's all just a stunt. Area 51 doesn't have anything at it and everybody
[28:49.760 --> 28:53.840]  that's spent years obsessing on it has been completely chumped. That's why she's not
[28:53.840 --> 28:57.840]  worried about what's declassified there because she can clean up toxic waste dump and act
[28:57.840 --> 28:59.560]  like a savior. Stay with us.
[28:59.560 --> 29:03.320]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many of you
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.080]  know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the
[29:07.080 --> 29:12.440]  shocking statistics. Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per
[29:12.440 --> 29:17.160]  man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune
[29:17.160 --> 29:21.240]  illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health
[29:21.240 --> 29:25.560]  challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you
[29:25.560 --> 29:28.480]  are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor
[29:28.480 --> 29:33.400]  and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.880]  into your day to day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients,

[30:19.320 --> 30:24.440]  Welcome to the infowar. It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support
[30:24.440 --> 30:29.400]  your health and the info war at the same time. I'm a nine year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals,
[30:29.400 --> 30:31.400]  aquafx, nascent iodine.
[30:31.400 --> 30:33.560]  Why? God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[30:33.560 --> 30:36.360]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[30:36.360 --> 30:37.880]  What products are you taking? Are you taking?
[30:37.880 --> 30:45.800]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to WetterSun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[30:45.800 --> 30:49.400]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[30:49.400 --> 30:54.440]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[30:54.440 --> 30:59.080]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[31:00.360 --> 31:05.080]  You're investing in your health and supporting the info war when you visit infowarslife.com
[31:05.080 --> 31:09.640]  and purchase your supply of survival shield X2, nascent iodine and all the great products
[31:09.640 --> 31:14.440]  at infowarslife.com. As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers,
[31:14.440 --> 31:20.360]  scientists, and the answer is clear. Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much
[31:20.360 --> 31:24.040]  new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[31:24.040 --> 31:29.960]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple
[31:29.960 --> 31:35.400]  blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine. On top of that, we also screen our iodine for
[31:35.400 --> 31:40.360]  radiation before bottling. It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there. Quite frankly,
[31:40.360 --> 31:45.400]  I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine, that major brands and
[31:45.400 --> 31:48.920]  major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have
[31:48.920 --> 31:56.200]  been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have. It is exclusive to infowarslife.com
[31:56.200 --> 32:02.280]  and the info warslife family of incredible products. In the first decade of my battle
[32:02.280 --> 32:07.560]  against the globalist, I gained close to 100 pounds. Now in the last four years,
[32:07.560 --> 32:13.720]  with help from the products at infowarslife.com, I have lost 80 plus pounds of that weight and
[32:13.720 --> 32:19.320]  as many viewers have noted, the weight loss has accelerated in the last year. The big turning
[32:19.320 --> 32:24.360]  point was when I did my first liver cleanse. My friends, I have gotten a lot of dramatic results
[32:24.360 --> 32:29.560]  with the incredible products at infowarslife.com, but the most dramatic hands down and the reviewers
[32:29.560 --> 32:34.760]  agree with me is the ultimate cleanse pack and the results you will see. We're giving you 20%
[32:34.760 --> 32:39.880]  off the ultimate cleanse pack with liver shield, oxy powder and deep cleanse all combined with a
[32:39.880 --> 32:45.160]  huge 20% discount at infowarslife.com. A lot of my family and a lot of the office are now doing
[32:45.160 --> 32:49.960]  the cleanse with me and so I'm challenging you, the fellow info warriors, to take action with me
[32:49.960 --> 32:54.760]  and do the cleanse as well. Just go to infowarslife.com for yourself, go to the liver cleanse,
[32:54.760 --> 32:58.920]  deep cleanse page and see the facts. It is game changing.
[32:58.920 --> 33:04.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:15.480 --> 33:18.600]  So joining us is fellow Throck criminal Stefan Malanu,
[33:19.400 --> 33:24.440]  hosted founder of Free Domain Radio and reaches hundreds of millions of people.
[33:24.440 --> 33:30.600]  YouTube.com for free domain radio, Twitter, Stefan Malanu, free domain radio.com. Stefan,
[33:30.600 --> 33:35.880]  this is reaching insane asylum level. What do you think the cultural leader trying to do? Because
[33:35.880 --> 33:41.000]  clearly it's an organized plan. It's the same thing in Europe, same thing here. I mean, has
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.840]  common sense been suspended because they don't get in trouble when they bring in 3 million
[33:44.840 --> 33:49.160]  refugees and they start burning, murdering and killing. They get more power. I mean,
[33:49.160 --> 33:53.800]  what's happening here? We don't have the historical view of Islam that is characterized
[33:53.800 --> 33:59.560]  by the history of the crusades. Look, Christianity was a Middle Eastern religion. The European
[33:59.560 --> 34:03.560]  religions were like the old Norse religions with Ragnarok and so on. Christianity is a Middle
[34:03.560 --> 34:08.120]  Eastern religion. And how many Christian countries are there left in the Middle East,
[34:08.120 --> 34:17.080]  accounting like if you accept a little bit in Lebanon, not because Islam is a radical expansionist
[34:17.080 --> 34:23.720]  ideology. To say that Islam is a religion is like saying communism is an economic system.
[34:23.720 --> 34:29.240]  It is not true. Islam is a combination of religion and a highly expansionist political
[34:29.240 --> 34:34.040]  ideology and highly expansionist is putting it mildly. Saying that Islam is somewhat expansionist
[34:34.040 --> 34:39.160]  is saying like a supernova is somewhat expansionist. Islam, of course, in the seventh century was
[34:39.160 --> 34:43.160]  founded by the end of the seventh century had taken over most of North Africa and all of the
[34:43.160 --> 34:48.440]  Middle East. It is an incredibly expansionist ideology. It seeks one world domination just
[34:48.440 --> 34:52.280]  as communism did. And the fact is that, of course, the first couple of Muslims are going
[34:52.280 --> 34:57.000]  to be nice because they have to wait to get the numbers up in order to begin to affect
[34:57.000 --> 35:02.200]  the kind of social change. When the Islamists first got their toe holds and then entire
[35:02.200 --> 35:10.440]  countries taken over in Europe, it took over 700 years of brutal medieval battle to drive
[35:10.440 --> 35:15.960]  the Islamic population out of Europe. And the Islamists, of course, were taking millions
[35:15.960 --> 35:21.640]  of Europeans, mostly through piracy, into the slave trade. The Islamists are 14 centuries
[35:21.640 --> 35:28.360]  of the slave trade, but the death count that has been estimated at over 110 million souls.
[35:28.360 --> 35:33.160]  So it is. Unless you show back to your show how deep this invasion went, and, of course,
[35:33.160 --> 35:40.840]  they'll call this racist just to give a cultural point. That's why Southern Italy, Greece,
[35:40.840 --> 35:45.800]  Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Spain is no longer blonde-haired blue-eyed. All the way up
[35:45.800 --> 35:52.360]  into Poland, that's how far the invasions went in Poland, in Hungary. I mean, millions dying,
[35:52.360 --> 35:57.320]  giant, full-out wars. And when the Muslims came in, they would kill all the men, even if they
[35:57.320 --> 36:03.080]  converted. At first, the Christians didn't care and weren't fighting back. But the Muslims were
[36:03.080 --> 36:09.240]  killing everybody, putting them to the sword, loading the women into slave ships. And that's
[36:09.240 --> 36:15.160]  all in mainline history. The Muslims celebrated. The Crusades were a response to multi-century
[36:15.160 --> 36:21.240]  invasions of Europe by the Islamic religion. And the imposition of Sharia law, Spain fell,
[36:21.240 --> 36:26.440]  Portugal fell. They were at the gates of Vienna. They were at the gates repeatedly of Rome.
[36:26.440 --> 36:32.360]  And it was in several crucial battles that the Crusades were fought. But it was not an invasion
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.600]  of the Middle East. It was a defense of Europe against Islamic invasions. When
[36:36.600 --> 36:41.400]  three out of the five Christian centers had fallen into Islamic hands, when the Islamists were at the
[36:41.400 --> 36:46.920]  gates of Vienna, that is when the pushback occurred. But this idea that these bloodthirsty
[36:46.920 --> 36:50.440]  Christians went along to these innocent Muslims who were just minding their own business and
[36:50.440 --> 36:55.720]  tending their chickens and just started slaughtering them for fun and kittens makes no sense. And
[36:55.720 --> 37:02.200]  it's historically completely inaccurate. Islam's goal was to conquer Europe. Islam's goal was being
[37:02.200 --> 37:07.240]  achieved. And the Christians, under the guidance of the Pope, finally said deos volts and began
[37:07.240 --> 37:11.800]  to fight back. But it was a defensive war. It was not fundamentally a war of imperialism.
[37:13.080 --> 37:17.320]  And that's that's not debated for folks that don't know. I mean, Islamic TV books, they all
[37:17.320 --> 37:23.160]  celebrate this. And then they say that's the gold takeover again. And you will convert or you put
[37:23.160 --> 37:29.720]  the sword. And then the left just runs around lying saying it's racist to say that this is being done.
[37:30.920 --> 37:36.760]  Well, and I think that in Europe, they abandoned Christianity and did not replace it with any
[37:36.760 --> 37:42.440]  comparable moral guidance. And so what's happened is I think that a lot of the European secularists
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.680]  have failed and no longer fundamentally understand the fundamentalist religious mindset,
[37:48.680 --> 37:53.400]  such as is occurring in many places in the Middle East. They don't understand that there are lots
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.680]  of people in the world who have plans and ambitions that far supersedes sort of shallow
[37:58.680 --> 38:03.160]  materialistic pleasure seeking that most secular post religious societies tend to fall into.
[38:03.160 --> 38:07.640]  So they're blind. So they say, well, you know, if we got to Europe, we'd be happy to just get a job
[38:07.640 --> 38:14.200]  and be nice and so on. They do not understand the end times massive 72 versions goals that a lot
[38:14.200 --> 38:19.080]  of fundamentalist Islamists have. And so they fundamentally miscalculating the depth and nature
[38:19.080 --> 38:25.160]  of those who wish their demise. So very briefly, okay, so when it comes to slavery, the general
[38:25.160 --> 38:30.120]  narrative is the rest of the world was living, you know, hugging unicorns, kumbaya, everybody giving
[38:30.120 --> 38:33.640]  group hugs, playing with puppies in their safe rooms, while the evil white Western European
[38:33.640 --> 38:37.240]  Christians wrapped their enslaving the world and colonizing and doing all these bad things.
[38:37.240 --> 38:41.000]  Therefore give us welfare because, you know, white guilt is a very minable resource on the
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.640]  planet, sadly, because whites suffer from a kind of pathological altruism. That means I will sell
[38:45.640 --> 38:50.200]  you my own children in order to avoid being called racist. So the actual history is quite
[38:50.200 --> 38:55.400]  different. It's really three things to remember about Western slavery. Number one, it was about
[38:55.400 --> 39:01.400]  the shortest period of slavery in any culture throughout history. Slavery was indigenous to
[39:01.400 --> 39:06.680]  African and Arab countries before it made its way to Europe. Slavery was widely practiced by the
[39:06.680 --> 39:12.200]  American Indians long before Columbus came to the New World. Ethiopia had slavery until, yes,
[39:12.200 --> 39:20.520]  1942, Saudi Arabia until 1962, Peru until 68, India until 76, and Mauritania until 1980. So
[39:21.400 --> 39:27.560]  it was not very long. The big peak of Christian slavery, 15, 19, 18, 15, that was sort of the
[39:27.560 --> 39:34.360]  peak period. There have, however, been 14 centuries of Arabic or Muslim slavery, and it's hard to know
[39:34.360 --> 39:40.440]  exactly because the records were mostly castrated and killed, but it was about 150 million African
[39:40.440 --> 39:44.120]  people, about 50 million from other parts of the world, vastly exceeding anything that happened.
[39:44.120 --> 39:47.480]  I forgot, the Muslim slavery, they cut the penis and genitals off the men.
[39:48.280 --> 39:53.640]  Yeah, why are there no blacks? If blacks took 150, sorry, if the Middle Easterners took 150
[39:53.640 --> 39:58.440]  million black Africans, why are there so few blacks in the Middle East? Well, because 80 to 90%
[39:58.440 --> 40:03.240]  of them died en route, and those who remained were castrated. And if they managed to escape that
[40:03.240 --> 40:08.040]  and have children with a local, the child was killed. So there was massive genocide of the
[40:08.040 --> 40:12.360]  slaves in the Muslim countries. Now, of course, all cultures have bad stuff in their history.
[40:12.360 --> 40:19.000]  The question is, Alex, what is the Muslim's current view of that history? Are they looking back
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.520]  and saying, like the Europeans do, wow, we did some bad stuff, that's really bad.
[40:22.520 --> 40:26.440]  No, look at what ISIS did in Libya targeting blacks. They believe they're subhuman.
[40:27.160 --> 40:32.680]  Right. And so where are the Africans going to the Islamic countries demanding
[40:32.680 --> 40:36.600]  reparations, demanding preferential treatment, demanding massive resource transfers to them
[40:36.600 --> 40:40.520]  for the history of slavery? Because I don't think the Muslims feel a huge amount of guilt,
[40:40.520 --> 40:45.960]  at least according to what I've read, I'm sure some individuals do, but there's not that same
[40:45.960 --> 40:49.880]  naval gazing, looking in the mirror saying, oh, me back, me back. Well, the last also spins that
[40:49.880 --> 40:53.400]  when I brought this up in college to throw this in and says it was different slavery in the Middle
[40:53.400 --> 40:58.440]  Eastern Africa, it was loving like family. No, it's what you see with women chained up in houses
[40:58.440 --> 41:03.000]  with hoods on their heads. It's beyond what happened in most Western plantations, which
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.240]  I'm not defending. I'm just sick of like the abject sex slavery, white slavery of the Arabs
[41:09.240 --> 41:15.080]  is legendary. Well, and so number one, the Christians practice slavery for the shortest
[41:15.080 --> 41:18.440]  amount of time. Number two, the Christians generally treated their slaves the best.
[41:19.160 --> 41:26.120]  But number three, which is also not insignificant, Christians ended slavery all around the world.
[41:26.120 --> 41:30.600]  I mean that they fought, they bled, they died. The British invaded a bunch of countries,
[41:30.600 --> 41:34.200]  took thousands of ships, you name it, would blow your ship up if you had slaves.
[41:34.200 --> 41:39.320]  And bribed people to give up their slaves. So, you know, there's that old saying that no good
[41:39.320 --> 41:44.040]  deed goes unpunished. If you want to look generally at the best culture throughout history,
[41:44.040 --> 41:48.040]  you've got to put on this weird inverse lens. You got to look at things kind of upside down.
[41:48.040 --> 41:51.880]  The culture that is criticized in the modern world is almost always the culture that has
[41:51.880 --> 41:57.000]  done the most good. And the ending of slavery after untold tens of thousands of years of its
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.360]  practice among humanity was, if not the most, one of the greatest moral triumphs in history.
[42:02.360 --> 42:07.080]  And now the only culture, the only race, the only religion that has demonized
[42:07.080 --> 42:12.840]  for slavery is that exact same religion that ended it creating the greatest moral crusade that
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.080]  the world has ever benefited from and bringing untold wealth and liberty to human beings around
[42:17.080 --> 42:21.080]  the world. So, it is completely ridiculous to say, well, white people ought to feel bad for
[42:21.080 --> 42:24.680]  slavery. It's like, they're the only people... And by the way, for liberals that are brainwashed...
[42:24.680 --> 42:27.720]  It's not just in their own cultures, but around the world. Well, for liberals that are brainwashed
[42:27.720 --> 42:33.240]  and just tuned in and can't believe this, this is mainline history. This is not what you're saying,
[42:33.240 --> 42:39.160]  it's in mainline history books. Oh, no, he's here with his ranting. That's really what it is.
[42:39.160 --> 42:44.040]  That's really what is going on. Terrorism is changing a people's political perspectives
[42:44.040 --> 42:49.160]  by acts of aggression. And the political perspectives in Germany are shifting now.
[42:49.160 --> 42:53.000]  Whether they should... Oh, I'm gonna go to break Stefan. And folks, you can find his website and

[46:59.240 --> 47:04.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.440 --> 47:28.840]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:28.840 --> 47:37.320]  Dr. Manning joins us from otlaatlah.org. He spearheaded the boycott nationwide to get Al
[47:37.320 --> 47:42.920]  Sharpton kicked off MSNBC. He is in the face of the dragon. He's got the eye of the tiger. Doesn't
[47:42.920 --> 47:46.280]  need to be introduced here. I appreciate him holding. Thank you so very much for having me. It's
[47:46.280 --> 47:53.480]  always a great honor. What is really going on behind this? It isn't just the fact that that ISIS
[47:53.480 --> 47:59.240]  or Muslims want to take charge of territory. Saudi Arabia's got tons and tons and tons of money.
[47:59.240 --> 48:06.600]  George Bush was in the pocket of King Abdullah and so is Obama. They don't need to be militant and
[48:06.600 --> 48:11.960]  to kill a whole bunch of people to get their way. They can buy their way or bribe their way into the
[48:11.960 --> 48:17.160]  lives of politicians and do what they want to do. I'm just highly suspicious of what's going on and
[48:17.160 --> 48:21.480]  wish I had a better answer for your audience today. I think you had a better answer because you just
[48:21.480 --> 48:25.160]  laid out. I wasn't even thinking about the Hegelian dialectic and all that and then there you are
[48:25.160 --> 48:30.760]  laying it out. It's prima facia. You know it's true on the surface. Obama doesn't even lean down when
[48:30.760 --> 48:35.320]  he meets a Christian leader and he shouldn't by the way because he's ahead of state but he does bow
[48:35.320 --> 48:41.000]  down to any Muslim leader he finds or foreign royalty. That is disgusting. What do you think
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.080]  that's about? I think it's about simply what's in his heart. As a man think of in his heart so is he.
[48:47.080 --> 48:54.360]  So when Obama comes in contact with the Muslims and others his heart tells him to bow down to this
[48:54.360 --> 48:59.160]  power. Well he's so sweet to him and then every Easter he badmouthed Christians and said remember
[48:59.160 --> 49:06.520]  last year and says we're mean and hateful. Well you know the funeral of Judge Justice Scalia
[49:06.520 --> 49:13.800]  was not attended by the Mac Daddy Obama. He didn't go and one of my audience participants said
[49:13.800 --> 49:18.600]  the reason why he did not go is because it was on the Catholic Church. You know the Catholics are
[49:18.600 --> 49:26.120]  heavy on biblical symbolism. They got the cross and Jesus all over everywhere in their sanctuaries
[49:26.120 --> 49:34.760]  and when Obama in his first year of office spoke at Notre Dame and also at George Western University
[49:34.760 --> 49:39.880]  there in Washington DC if I'm pronouncing the university correct he made them cover up the
[49:39.880 --> 49:45.240]  picture of Jesus. That's right. Cover up the cross at Notre Dame and also at the university
[49:46.040 --> 49:51.640]  but he couldn't get the Catholics to do that at Scalia's funeral so he didn't go. That's his
[49:51.640 --> 49:57.400]  you're right he bashes Christians. That's almost like a vampire because I forgot he'll never be
[49:57.400 --> 50:06.120]  seen with a cross around him. What is it? I mean a cross will actually bring him to his knees
[50:06.120 --> 50:10.680]  so he has to cover it up. I was so put out when Notre Dame did that going back to you remember
[50:10.680 --> 50:16.200]  when he did that happened going back a year ago. Not a year ago but several years ago. I've forgotten
[50:16.200 --> 50:22.200]  about that. No and Dr. Alan Keyes was out there on his knees begging people to wake up to what's
[50:22.200 --> 50:27.240]  going on that you got to cover up the cross of Jesus to get this low light piece of trash called
[50:27.240 --> 50:33.160]  Obama to come and speak at one of the Catholics most leading in the notorious organized schools.
[50:33.160 --> 50:37.000]  That's crazy because when he goes to India or anywhere else he will stand in front of any
[50:37.000 --> 50:42.600]  other religious symbol but the cross and they do cover it up everywhere. Wow that is that is
[50:42.600 --> 50:47.160]  such a message that he doesn't want to be seen worldwide with that image associated with him.
[50:47.160 --> 50:52.120]  That is unbelievable. What are we going to do about Christians in America that allow that to
[50:52.120 --> 50:59.000]  take place who feel cowered a cow'd rather into allowing him to do that hands of tide we're just
[50:59.000 --> 51:07.320]  helpless. Freedom of speech freedom of religion means that separation of church and state means
[51:07.320 --> 51:11.720]  that as Christians we shouldn't challenge him. Well I was about to say I've never worn jewelry
[51:11.720 --> 51:17.480]  other than a watch but I'm I just feel moved the last year or so to get a small cross and start
[51:17.480 --> 51:21.560]  running around my neck just because the enemy hates it so much. Why does the enemy hate that
[51:21.560 --> 51:28.200]  symbol so much? Because it's the most powerful symbol in all of the known universe you can go
[51:28.200 --> 51:35.480]  from planet to planet from star to star from galaxy to galaxy and the cross is it Alex. Go get one
[51:35.480 --> 51:42.520]  it's power. I like to see Obama if I first thing I do I'd flash him I'd have my jacket closed you
[51:42.520 --> 51:48.280]  know if I came into his presence I'd have my jacket closed then when I came up to him I'd
[51:48.280 --> 51:52.840]  flash over my cross. And I've got family that's some family that's Baptist others that are
[51:52.840 --> 51:55.640]  Methodist and they can't even go to their Methodist churches anymore including
[51:55.640 --> 52:01.480]  the biggest one here in town because let me tell you they get up there and they're talking about
[52:01.480 --> 52:07.080]  all over the country taking crosses out. Germany's doing it too saying it's hurtful to those that
[52:07.080 --> 52:13.480]  aren't Christian well then you're not a church anymore so that's what this move is about.
[52:13.480 --> 52:18.440]  Everybody else's symbols can be there but Christians this is so discriminatory we're
[52:18.440 --> 52:22.200]  going to go back to Pastor Manning but as they attempt to intimidate free speech
[52:22.200 --> 52:27.720]  it's time to take action. Lord Moncton said he didn't used to wear a big cross until he
[52:27.720 --> 52:31.800]  started trying to restrict him and said don't wear him in England and the UK on the news they
[52:31.800 --> 52:36.840]  said they're hurtful he wears a giant one now and you know I just thought of it I'm going to put out
[52:37.880 --> 52:43.240]  a t-shirt that's basically crusader style with a big shield and a big cross
[52:44.520 --> 52:51.320]  with something like defending free speech since 13 something because it was Islam that invaded
[52:51.320 --> 52:56.760]  Europe dozens of times killed millions till the crusades responded to push it out and I was taught
[52:56.760 --> 53:03.560]  in school and college that the West was bad in the crusades even though the very textbook admitted
[53:03.560 --> 53:08.280]  that Islam started expanding before Muhammad even died it had taken over thousands of miles
[53:08.280 --> 53:16.440]  so I mean I'm just it's crazy it's crazy to sit there and blame groups that didn't do anything
[53:16.440 --> 53:19.640]  for things that happened in history it just shows the attack on reality it's like blaming
[53:19.640 --> 53:23.240]  Donald Trump for saying we're not vetting any of the people coming in from the Middle East
[53:23.240 --> 53:26.920]  will block them all till we vet them before that he's like well we got to bring the Christians in
[53:26.920 --> 53:31.400]  they're being killed uh no sir they're not letting the Christians come out for every couple hundred
[53:31.400 --> 53:35.800]  Muslims they'll let one Christian in that's in the news they won't let Shiites in because they're not
[53:36.600 --> 53:41.880]  allied with Obama I just feel such an earnestness and it seems like the enemy is moving on all
[53:41.880 --> 53:47.000]  fronts is the enemy moving on all fronts because they're in trouble or because they're emboldened
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.240]  and what do you think about Trump other big issues what's front and center for you right now
[53:51.240 --> 53:55.560]  one of the things that Trump has been able to do profoundly is to demonstrate that all media
[53:55.560 --> 54:01.560]  that they are phonies they're liars they're they're inconsistent they're not for the American people
[54:01.560 --> 54:05.720]  they're bought and paid for it doesn't matter whether it's Fox or whether it's MSNBC
[54:06.280 --> 54:11.560]  he doesn't make a distinction they're all in it if you will in a way that doesn't produce
[54:11.560 --> 54:16.200]  that doesn't benefit the American people Trump has made that clear what I want to say about the
[54:16.200 --> 54:20.360]  manner report and things we do here and certainly you might want to think about it as well
[54:21.160 --> 54:27.880]  and get your supporters to think about how we need to start having investment procedures
[54:27.880 --> 54:34.200]  so that we can protect ourselves at the collapse of the the medias that are going to collapse as a
[54:34.200 --> 54:40.040]  result of of what Trump is doing because a number of institutions that are presently standing
[54:40.040 --> 54:45.800]  are not going to stand on the Trump presidency I've said so and everybody listen to me on my
[54:45.800 --> 54:52.600]  on our broadcast know I've said that your ministry Alex Jones and for wars will be number one when
[54:52.600 --> 54:59.800]  ABC and others go out of business you have been bringing the truth the news to people without
[54:59.800 --> 55:05.400]  being paid for by the advertisers or the lobbyists or politicians that will not come on your broadcast
[55:05.400 --> 55:10.040]  unless you give a particular point of view of support for them what do you think Trump's place
[55:10.040 --> 55:15.400]  is already in history for whatever reason he is just devastating him on every front what is your
[55:15.400 --> 55:19.800]  view overall of how Trump's doing and where this is going because I'm really concerned for his safety
[55:19.800 --> 55:25.080]  I am too and I don't like to talk a lot about it because I don't want to give people ideas but I am
[55:25.080 --> 55:28.760]  prayerful there for a prayerful answer but I would ask everybody else to be concerned
[55:28.760 --> 55:35.560]  but Trump is a revolutionary when I look at Trump and I look at George Washington and everybody
[55:35.560 --> 55:40.920]  please listen to me very carefully I'm not trying to raise a man above his statue it doesn't profit
[55:40.920 --> 55:46.680]  me I've been living too long to do such but when I look at how George Washington handled the
[55:46.680 --> 55:54.360]  establishment of King George and when the revolution was called that we needed to be set free from
[55:55.400 --> 56:01.960]  England and its tyranny over us as a free and independent people and Washington was able
[56:01.960 --> 56:07.560]  to lead a fierce battle to have that happen in the Revolutionary War and then become the president
[56:07.560 --> 56:14.760]  you know when I look at Donald Trump taking back 200 years back to the 17 to 18 hundreds
[56:14.760 --> 56:20.040]  and put on him a military suit like George Washington I think we're cooking with the same
[56:20.040 --> 56:26.280]  gas if you will we want to take our nation back from the globalist we want to take our nation back
[56:26.280 --> 56:30.840]  and Trump is our leader right now and he's saying it and he knows it and inside baseball
[56:30.840 --> 56:35.640]  he knows even more he is on the same page as us and that's why the enemy is so scared to death
[56:35.640 --> 56:40.360]  of him they know he's not just acting like a populist they know from the dossiers on him and the
[56:40.360 --> 56:45.720]  rest of it that he's been aware of this he gave money against napkin gat 25 years ago he hates it
[56:45.720 --> 56:52.200]  all he has been basically under the radar and so they know and they're scared yeah and I think
[56:52.200 --> 56:59.480]  the american people have been have we've not seen such excitement in the american people in a very
[56:59.480 --> 57:05.480]  very long time in this nation it's been a very long time uh pastor manning is a great guy he
[57:05.480 --> 57:10.120]  doesn't ask me to do this but I asked the listeners to check out his ministry that'd be a great place
[57:10.120 --> 57:14.680]  in my view to tithe and support people if you don't only have globalist churches in your area he
[57:14.680 --> 57:18.360]  feeds the local folks teaches them about what's happening with the new world order he really
[57:18.360 --> 57:24.360]  is the type of church I would attend if I live near to him otla.org great videos great reports
[57:24.360 --> 57:30.360]  great tv show radio show great materials for everybody free there on the site but otla.org
[57:30.360 --> 57:34.840]  he's been through a lot in Harlem over 30 years fighting and has now become a major leader in the
[57:34.840 --> 57:39.960]  area by being willing to go up against gangsters like Al Sharpton so he's a good friend and a
[57:39.960 --> 57:46.600]  great patriot pastor james david manning otla.org you're listening to alex jones

[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:05.240]  now i rarely air a special report twice in a row i aired this on friday but john bound did a
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:10.360]  breakdown of major universities having hissy fits and freaking out over someone writing donald trump
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:18.280]  2016 on chalk on stairs i mean this is the attack on basic thinking dozens of college students in
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:25.240]  fear close quote in atlanta after trump 2016 it chalked across campus not trump kkk which the
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:31.240]  false flaggers do no no trump 2016 and they're now having psychologists and meetings and and
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:37.480]  having to cancel part of the school as everyone goes in and says we're scared we're so much
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:43.960]  robbed it was almost as bad as yale and the two professors over that department
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.960]  sent an email saying listen costume parties are part of freedom this is true liberalism
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.520]  you're allowed to you know have different ideas and dress like you want and just you know you
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.040]  have your freedom as well and so they caught them out in the square and began screaming at them and
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:04.920]  threatening them and threatening to hit them and going help me i'm scared i can't even scream as loud
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.520]  and as hysterically and as freaked out as they didn't guess what yale fired both of them
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.720]  fired the people that dare say there was freedom info wars journalist adan salazar writes several
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:21.400]  students at emory university in atlanta requested a meeting with the school's president after the
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:31.240]  words trump 2016 were scrawled across campus the college news site the tab published several photos
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:38.280]  of the chalking jim wagner the university president said tuesday he had spoken with some
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:45.720]  40 to 50 students after they claimed they were triggered by the words trump 2016 and other pro
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:51.640]  trump messages written in chalk on buildings and sidewalks around campus the students said they
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:02:00.280]  were threatened by the intimidating messages and voiced genuine concern and pain to administrators
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:05.960]  reports the associated press the emory wheel reports one student said i'm supposed to feel
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.800]  comfortable and safe here but this man is being supported by students on our campus and our
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:18.840]  administration shows that they by their silence supported as well and i don't deserve to feel
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:24.840]  afraid at my school she added but individual students soon began to offer more detailed
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:31.000]  personal reactions to feelings of racial tension that trump and his ideology bring to the fore has
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.080]  this juvenile corrosion of freedom of choice reached other american campuses the university of
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.920]  texas for example if you saw trump 2016 written on the ground right here would that offend you
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:48.280]  would you rally with other students and alert the university president it would offend me i'm not
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:53.320]  sure i would go get the president in the university but i'd be happy if someone did i'd sadly try to
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.160]  rub it out i think just goes to show a lot about where our political process is at right now so it
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:05.480]  just be kind of i think disappointed is uh my main reaction no why why not why wouldn't you be
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:10.920]  offended uh people have a right to put in chalk trump 2016 if they support them i may not support
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.840]  him but that doesn't mean that others aren't supporting him and they have a right in chalk it's
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:20.200]  not graffiti it's not graffiti you know i'd be fine if people uh did that as long as they don't
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:25.800]  infringe on the rights of others to write clinton or ksick or anyone else in shock right next to it
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:32.760]  why would it offend you well first of all nobody should be writing their opinions on public streets
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:37.160]  it's not the opinion of all the students in the body and it shouldn't be represented near our
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:46.600]  university um and because i don't want trump to win president for 2016 because i think he's a
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:57.400]  dangerous man who is dishonest he lies and he's using his his money to manipulate poor people
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:03.240]  into voting for him you can express political beliefs wherever you want i think the first
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:09.320]  amendment gives you that right but i would just be disappointed i think i think his society's
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:15.320]  becoming more polarized uh people are either right wing or left wing at very extreme positions and
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.600]  the moderates aren't very talkative and seem to be frozen out so you have to support extreme
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:25.320]  positions get elected and that's no good anymore most of the students i tried to talk to had their
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:31.480]  heads buried in their phones the independent reports the more time young adults spend on social media
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.240]  the more likely they are to become depressed well they haven't seen anything yet wait until
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:43.240]  obama's policies come home to roost as young millennial men and women are drafted and sent

[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.080]  good high school friend chain steiner who's no stranger to the show and then he was coming

[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.080]  don't copy them but that's what i like and it's like just just more and more great stuff you're
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:22.360]  involved with tim kennedy mm a dot com i said years ago this isis spinoff of al qaeda is big
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:27.560]  a lot bigger than al qaeda was because i'm on the ground i get the threats i see them at
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:32.600]  furguson and in new york and i see the signs i see the stickers it's trendy with the left
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.400]  and uh it's it's in texas we go out to these islamic training centers and get
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:42.120]  death threats we get hacked we get uh they put joe biggs former staff sergeant us army
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.320]  decorated combat vet they put him in ices videos um when he went down to the border to show him on
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.040]  the texas border so this is what they do but but but tim kennedy just like ben laden's a high value
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:57.400]  target or was he's a high value target now tim i just set the stage is that accurate what i said
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.200]  correct me if i'm wrong you're the expert and and please break down as much detail as you can
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.760]  about the personal uh federal bureau of investigation visit and warning you've gotten it's great to
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.240]  have you here in the info war i've been a fan for a long time so just appreciate you having me
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.480]  every day i get five to ten people saying hey i hate you you're gonna die i want to kill you
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:20.360]  everything that you stand for i hate um what makes this significant is um you know this one was
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:26.040]  geotagged and they had they had content that they couldn't have gotten from anywhere else besides
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:30.120]  first person so they had pictures of a guy's head that they had cut off and they said this is going
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:36.120]  to be you um the geotag picture was was you know close enough that the fbi says hey this is significant
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:41.560]  and that's why we're that's why we're talking to you right now um the problem was that i've been
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:47.000]  doing this for 13 years you know um i i don't know if i'm desensitized to it or i just don't care
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.080]  and i have zero respect for the cowards that they are um and the fbi is like you're not normal you
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.520]  should be a little bit freaked out by this that's why i don't know let them come i don't you know
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.640]  like i i've been traveling all over the world to find these guys and now they're going to come to
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.800]  texas last time they gave it a whirl was in garland and i didn't go so well for them so you
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.120]  know like come to central texas and see how this is going to work you know they're the only thing
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.200]  they got going for them is they're brutal they're evil and they have no respect for human life
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.640]  they're uneducated they're weak they're stupid um but they have no respect for anything and they'll
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.800]  take advantage of the the weakest sheep that they can get their hands on and that's just not going to
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:28.520]  be me well it certainly shows that they are upset about your success the fact you survived all those
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.800]  operations and clandestine uh fights you were in and it's too bad you can't write a book about
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:38.600]  that it's pretty interesting stuff uh just from folks i've talked to in the military but obviously
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:44.120]  you can't get into that here today but there's a reason they don't like you yeah you know i was in
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:50.600]  some of the most elite unit units that special operations have um i was in the missions to go
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:55.560]  get the guys that they have worshiped you know their entire lives you know like as i love chris
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.680]  kyle and marx latrell you know like and those are heroes the shoe guards the gordon's um you know
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:07.000]  that wing the isis talcaida they have their own guys that they do that well i'm the guy that went
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.840]  and found those dudes and uh they they hate that about me and now um the success that i'm having
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:18.280]  not only as a shooter but now as you know as a ufc athlete you know i'm a contender for the title
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.080]  one of the top fighters in the world and uh and i still stand true to the values you're winning
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:28.600]  shooting champions you're winning ufc uh big bouts you've got a hit show on um discovery
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.800]  channel is a history with a history channel that's right hunting it where i've seen that
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.880]  quite a few times is great i mean they certainly must not like that no they hate me they hate
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.760]  everything about me they hate everything about you they hate everything we stand for you know
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:44.280]  they're going to do anything that they can to find the the weakest softest target around us i know
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.680]  you're still involved with the military and active duty and things you can't get into all that but uh
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.440]  we've had seen top generals like the former head of defense intelligence come out and say we were
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:57.720]  ordered to basically aid al nazar which is al qaeda in syria it's a horrible thing we followed
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.600]  orders now it's out of control we see other generals coming out the head of south com coming out and
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:08.040]  saying i don't want to follow the orders i've got to women in frontline combat will ruin the military
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:15.000]  that's unprecedented have generals speaking out that that shows you how bad obama is i'm never
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.320]  imagined that would would have this climate in the military um you know like we told the line you
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.160]  know you you tell us what to do especially in special operations we're fire and forget you
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.840]  say go do this we're gonna go do it better than you would have you know imagined it to be possible
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.240]  and we're gonna stay quiet about it you know like our our motto is the the quite professionals
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:41.560]  this is not the culture of special operations to go in front and say no this was not right we
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.920]  shouldn't have done this no that's stupid you're gonna get soldiers killed no we shouldn't have
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.840]  women here like that is not the culture of special operations but the fact that we are coming out
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:54.600]  and saying that really demonstrates that there's a gigantic problem well there's a midmitted calling
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.480]  and a purge of the top brass that aren't traders i mean let's just get down the brass tax and it's
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:06.200]  going all the way down to the um non-commissioned officers from all my sources and it's just
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.440]  unprecedented that everything we know it's like bonjino the former top secret service agent was
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.600]  on earlier said in the previous interview he said alex not only are you accurate it's worse than
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:19.400]  you know how could it be worse than i know i because they can't tell me it's secret it's just
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.920]  worse than i know okay well that's that's not that's not refreshing well i mean you can look
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:29.720]  at like micro examples but Benghazi for instance you know we're we have an idea of what happened we
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:35.560]  know we have details but really like what special forces guys were on helicopters ready to fly
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:42.280]  into libya um what general was saying no you can go we don't have access to that stuff so you know
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:47.720]  yeah all i can say is you have no idea how bad it was or how bad it is because we there's no way
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.160]  tell me well i was told by colonel schaefer right after it happened he got in a bunch of trouble
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.880]  but met met it out of it uh and of course used to run the anti-bin Laden units and the rest of it
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:00.520]  uh was into colonel schaefer that no they had helicopters they had planes they could be there
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.720]  in an hour out of um out of italy they were ordered to stand down and then you ask why well
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:11.320]  somebody wanted those weapons to be able to be transferred to syria yeah yeah and that's that's
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:16.840]  micro you know and if that's the personification of the entire climate or other macro problems well
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:23.000]  it shows obama and hillary's about the military and about their own ambassador they're just they're
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.720]  just unbelievably bad news and i'm not sure to demonize them i don't even like going up against
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.800]  these people they're so dangerous but at a certain point who are these people i mean they're just
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:38.440]  they're out of control they are and that's frightening but you know it doesn't that's external
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:43.160]  and i can only be responsible for what i do and what i say um i thought the government was using
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.920]  the threat of al-qaeda to take our liberties domestically i was all for taking out but now
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.400]  with isis they are just all over the place years ago i was saying this is real it's coming
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.520]  this is a big movement this has got young people involved they're recruiting all over the west
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.520]  i mean i think personally you've dealt with them but i think isis personally is like five times the
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:05.240]  threat of al-qaeda i mean they just seem yeah what would you say about them they're efficiency
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:11.000]  in recruiting um and and they're so smart and so far ahead you know using immigration opportunities
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.800]  you know being like oh no no look look at these horrible um women and that are impoverished we
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.720]  need to get them out of these war zones and so for every one female that we bring into
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.480]  germany we're also going to bring five military age men that are going to come in and you know
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.400]  rape every single woman that we can find in cologne germany um you know don't think that
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.320]  they're not doing that here right now that those guys aren't going to Chicago that they're not
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:36.040]  going to be in detroit you know every single metropolis they're recruiting heavily they're
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:42.280]  going after the low informed the low second so socioeconomic demographics and they are finding
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:46.600]  people the homegrown terrorists to the San Bernardinos that's going to happen and it's
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.280]  going to get worse before it gets better well listen tim thank you so much great haven't you

[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:06.040]  Alex Jones thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:13.240]  the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:19.640]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:25.400]  air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:30.200]  pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:36.760]  vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death i personally counter this

[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.440]  and i'm not trying to be dramatic here i want to ask lou rockwell a preeminent libertarian
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:22.280]  intellectual best-selling author formerly ron paul steve of staff one of the top guys over at the
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:28.120]  von misa institute that that it seems you're reaching a critical mass where there's a method
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:34.600]  to the establishment's madness but they are going insane in front of us what is this hallucination
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:40.360]  we're witnessing is this the death rows is it a tent or tantrum or do you disagree with me or are we
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:48.520]  seeing just bizarre displays of collectivist mental illness because it just gets you know ban the word
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:55.720]  father and mother ban the word founding fathers ug or thee i mean it's it's beyond any cult if i
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:01.880]  read a novel about a cult like this i wouldn't believe it i mean it's cult programming what do
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:08.440]  you say to that rancor well it it is crazy and i i somehow think it's the neocons i mean i can't
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.160]  i can't believe that sometimes i miss the rockefeller world empire as evil as they were
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:19.160]  they didn't actually seem to be insane uh this bunch is insane i don't care whether it's hillary
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:26.600]  or it's the republican versions rubio and jeb bush and and uh head crews and and of course
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:33.400]  bernie sanders um there are a lot of crazy people warmongers people who clearly lust for
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:39.960]  or shedding of blood they lust for the shedding of blood of others uh they lust for the shedding
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:46.520]  of the blood of americans too so um it's absolutely true they're sort of revealing their true selves
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:52.920]  they do seem to be reveling in their victories and they are they aren't enforcing insane policies i
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:59.000]  mean can you believe that they talk about mandating the registration of women for the draft
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.240]  and according to the poll anyway 61 of american men went along with this i mean that's insane too
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:11.080]  why and you know of course in some sense we can see the regime and in these sorts of um
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:16.760]  activities wanting to make men into women and women into men uh and that goes along with all
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.640]  what you're talking about the pronouns and and getting rid of mothers and fathers not having
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:26.760]  boys and girls sections and toy stores or boys and girls sections and clothing departments
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:33.080]  uh everything has to be the same or rather the same what did facebook say that there were 65
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:40.680]  genders that you could choose among uh for your own on facebook so it's uh this goes right along
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:47.160]  with the crazed statism uh they are um uh just reveling in their power and of course these are
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:52.760]  people who love to do this to human beings they just love to bomb they love to kill love to crush
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:57.400]  they love to dominate they love to lie to us they love to take our children away
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:02.360]  and they like to destroy our communities robert niss with the great libertarian socialist excuse
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:08.600]  me sociologist uh pointed out the state seeks to destroy every what he called intermediating
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:15.320]  institution that is everything that stands between he said the naked individual and state power
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:20.040]  so they want to get rid of states as versus the fed they want to get rid of communities they want
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:24.440]  to go get rid of businesses of churches ultimately they want to get rid of the family they want to
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.080]  get rid of parents and yours this is of course play does dream this have been an ancient dream
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.920]  of these people this is nothing new that's why i love getting you on because you we can say the
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:38.600]  french revolution the jackabins trying to hijack the liberty movement was the most modern you know
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:44.520]  roots of communism but really it goes back to play dough and his plan to raise us like cattle and
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:50.280]  and in the family itself but then he would write the allegory of the cave supposedly responding to
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:56.920]  his own vision but he really is their god uh he really is their model i was brought up a christian
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:01.000]  i believe in god but i wasn't you know a strong christian we've called that and i was like you
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.560]  know devil okay kind of bad energy in the universe whatever but the more i studied the globalist
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:11.880]  elites uh and what they're involved in and then criminology how psychopaths usually uh you know
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.880]  end up actually being into satanism whether god's real or not for the sake of argument for atheist
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.920]  still in criminology and psychology there is a manifestation the nazis were into the occult
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:29.160]  linen was into the occult uh they sell us that oh there's no god because they want to have the
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:34.760]  state be god as you pointed out but really behind closed doors they're into occultism
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:40.040]  please elaborate on that and why you think satanist across america the stories on drudgerport.com
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:45.400]  are such big supporters of bernie i thought a real satanist you know they claim anton levé style
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:50.520]  is all about empowering the individual and doing what you want do as thou wilt is the whole law
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:55.800]  but no it isn't really that is it you sell people on joining your cult you're gonna have fun but
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:01.000]  really you're gonna be slaves on satan's plantation we rock well of course and and even though they
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.200]  said do as thou wilt you're not allowed to do as thou wilt uh you have to do what they want
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:13.720]  and uh you know this is a very warped people um are they are does the satan respond to this sort
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:19.800]  of thing i mean are they actually uh in connect you know and in uh somehow communicated with him
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:25.880]  i you know that i don't know but they would like to be and they are you know self-consciously pro-evil
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:33.560]  so they enjoy killing uh and they enjoy um you know all kinds of horrible uh horrible practices
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:39.960]  with other human beings that they engage in uh some of these cults really horrendous and of
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.120]  course they're all leftists and i don't think we you know you asked earlier can we count on the
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.360]  left i don't think so i think the left has to be entirely rejected i mean i remember the last
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:54.680]  time i talked to noam chomsky guys written a lot of good stuff this was uh during the 2008 campaign
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:00.520]  and he was very very anti ron paul and he told me he would support hillary over ron paul this is
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:07.080]  an alleged anti war guy um and you know why was that well it's because the they hate private property
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.880]  and they hate everything that stems from private property private property is essential to the family
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:17.720]  it's essential to to economic life it's essential to human civilization they want to smash it all
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:24.920]  they're far worse than anybody in in orwell's 1984 and of course they've got unbelievable
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:30.600]  technology to spy on us the government now admits that the whole point of the internet of things is
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:37.960]  to spy on us in our homes um they're spying on us to an extent that hitler or stalin or or a big
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:43.480]  brother in orwell never could have dreamed of and they're still not satisfied they're still pushing
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:47.800]  they want to get rid of cash the better to control us oh i've talked to a lot of top
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.200]  leftists as you have and you're having dinner with them they'll admit it they'll go listen
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.240]  i know the government's stage in false flags i know they're bringing the drugs in i know they're
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:59.160]  doing all these bad things but it's going to be our government when we finally get control of it so
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:04.120]  we want it to be as big as possible and you're right they see anybody with their own property
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.120]  that's why they have a war on lemonade stands and farmers markets in the amish they just see any
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:14.360]  normal independent human activity a happy amish family out there healthy you know doing well
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:18.600]  self-sufficient and they pull their hair out because those amish aren't watching television
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:24.040]  thinking hillary's god well also they don't want people being happy you know it's what
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:28.120]  minkin said about the puritans it applies to these guys they can't stand it if anybody's
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.760]  leading a normal life and is happy and fulfill whether it's the amish family or somebody else
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:38.520]  they want to kill them they want to crush them like to send them to a camp these people are just
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:43.720]  unbelievably evil and those of us who are working against this who are opposed to it
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:48.680]  must never forget that we're against we're working against people who are thoroughly evil with a

[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:17.640]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.960]  the reason i wanted last week and now we've got him to get dug hagman of hagman hagman
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.680]  dot com the northeast intelligence network on was about the scalia situation now he told
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:34.760]  you there was going to be an investigation now they admit that there is a private investigation going
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:39.080]  on and the washington post tried to head it off admitting when he died in a secret society
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:45.720]  meeting that was a spinoff of bohemian growth not just a hunting society and i'm not saying
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:51.240]  it's a bad society he was in these are feeder groups these are compartmentalized i would hear
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:55.160]  dug hagman probably eight nine years ago or longer on coast to coast to him and i said this
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:59.160]  last time i'm gonna just say it now and he would say our sources in the federal government say
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:03.080]  they plan to flood europe the united states with radical muslims to use the threat as a way to
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.640]  take our freedoms and they're gonna allow surreal lot to be taught in schools and i would just go
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:11.880]  that is ridiculous a lot of what he said i knew was true as i was confused i liked hearing on the
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.320]  radio learned some stuff knew a lot of it was true but then he would say stuff that i was just like
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:21.320]  you know our elite aren't that crazy and it's turned out it's true so that's why i like to get
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:26.200]  him on we should get him on more often dug great to have you back i tell you things are so exciting
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:32.280]  so scary now i can't even believe newt janitor saying secret societies run everything on fox news
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.840]  and they're i mean everything we've talked about is just now coming out i guess we really are run
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:41.240]  by crazy people who just want to destroy america and christianity i mean it's what you said it is
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:47.320]  the plan what are your federal contacts telling you and state police contacts right now about what's
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.760]  happening with scalia where that's all going elis thanks for having me a couple of things with
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:59.240]  respect to scalia that investigation his death very mysterious indeed uh john poindexter once
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:06.280]  people understand who he is big obama donor all that but investigations 101 um him passing away
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:11.640]  or dying or being murdered whatever it's almost irrelevant but at the ranch and the fact that
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:17.480]  the most basic of investigative uh policies were not followed that in and of itself is really
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:23.640]  problematic the fact that there was no uh official there present to declare him dead or to sign off
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:29.720]  on the death certificate the fact that he was embalmed before of course his um of the family
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.960]  physician has spoken with a person who signed off uh cinderella uh where uh they're last name is
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:41.640]  cinderella the judge uh there the fact that uh uh he was embalmed before that conversation between
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:47.720]  cinderella and uh the uh judges personal care physician took place is obviously problematic
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:54.040]  but the bottom line here is scalia is out of the way and now we've got a danger to our constitution
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.760]  i've got a ton of information about the um about the actual the scene itself and about the uh
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:07.560]  events before during and after but uh alex what i want to tell you and i'm here my sources are
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:13.560]  telling me this and this is kind of the first time i'm going public uh with this in this platform
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:22.440]  there will be between now and election another supreme court vacancy okay now before anyone says
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.840]  yells at me pelican brief it doesn't have to be a death it could be a resignation but the
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:31.080]  information i'm getting is i guarantee you there will be one more uh supreme court vacancy and
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:39.320]  that is to solidify the supreme court uh on behalf of obama where he can nominate uh as select
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:45.800]  and and and have the senate confirm two not just one but two nominees during his tenure to absolutely
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:52.200]  solidify the progressive marxist agenda of this cabal that's in power now whether that happens
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.600]  according to the timeline well this is what's being told to me i'm just relaying the information
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:03.320]  are they saying who it is ginsberg that's you know not directly saying who it is but by everything
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.400]  i've been able to really kind of get out of the people yeah ginsberg it appears where she's gonna
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:13.320]  retire for health reasons now if that doesn't happen then there may have to go to plan b and
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:17.960]  i'm not exactly sure what plan b is but watch for that okay well you told me five years ago
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:23.640]  they're worried about obama wants to start a race war to bring in a civil emergency we've seen him
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:29.320]  try that a bunch uh you you you talk about the plan to flood us with sharia law and now i've got
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:32.520]  stacks of news today where it's happening in public schools everywhere they're teaching it
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:37.000]  they're making kids put on hot jobs they're they're making them praise all this is even non-muslim
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.640]  teachers this is actually common core what is all of this about on on that front well it's it's
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:49.800]  boy everything works like a uh all of these are cogs in a larger machine uh the invasion the alien
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:55.800]  invasion into this country is is to rip the moral and spiritual and cultural fabric of our country
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.720]  of course that's what they showed at the academy awards is they show the tower of babel in the
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:04.760]  background what are they telling us they're in charge and they're they're they're laughing at us
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:08.520]  see that that's what people don't understand they're showing this stuff and people are looking at it
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.360]  and saying well you know it's just art it's entertainment it's it's whatever but the fact
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.880]  of the matter is they're telling us what they're gonna do before they do it and they're laughing
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:20.280]  at us because no one's getting it no one's understanding it or at least very few are you
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:25.000]  are your audience is but but the majority of people are just you know hey when we have um
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.840]  really 32 percent of of american people never hearing the don't even know who scalia was for
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:35.400]  example in a recent poll we've got a problem in this country obviously and you you know
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.680]  and you've proven that many times we don't know what planet they're on so i'm asking a lot of
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:43.640]  questions here and this is really important what's the intel from all your great sources
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.880]  what's the state of the republic right now what are the big points we need to go over here today
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:53.720]  okay great push right now to change the the complexion of the judiciary uh the fact is if
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.840]  they could perhaps get loretta lynch in as a potential candidate for the supreme court that
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:05.880]  will throw the doj into some little bit of chaos there to take away from the hillary clinton indictment
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:11.320]  possibility there's a war right now going on inside the fbi according to my fbi source saying
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:14.120]  that if she doesn't get indicted there's a lot of good people that they're going to lose a lot of
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:21.640]  good people um uh there's a push for additional racial riots this summer but going for broke
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:27.880]  that is in other words what we saw back in uh the 2011 that was rest rehearsal absolutely
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:34.040]  uh so we've got that the economy uh we we our economy is just it's in a crap storm i mean
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:40.280]  however uh what will help the economy well we need a war we've got a ready made war right now in
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:46.360]  in syria and i gotta tell you right now syria is uh it's my belief that syria will be uh well
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:51.080]  death race Damascus the road to Damascus is the road to world war three and despite Ukraine despite
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:55.640]  the south see uh chinese islands syria is where we need to keep our attention to where nato is
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:01.320]  being pitted against russia by this globalist cabal you pointed you pointed this out um in your
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:05.480]  investigations years ago so it's all coming to pass right now it's crunch time so to speak
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:11.000]  i just want the listeners to realize this is for all the marbles and we don't have any future if
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  we really just don't understand it isn't brave to fight these people it's survival we don't have
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.320]  a choice do you get where i'm going absolutely and you know you you point out so many great
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:26.760]  points you know you did a video here not to a couple of days ago i believe it was about the uh
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:31.640]  really the dark horse of the new world order that being technocracy and i think people if people
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:37.400]  really understood the bigger picture here what's going on we're being forced like cattle into this
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:42.760]  this new old world order so to speak and what you're talking about what you just brought up the
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:48.920]  articles that you have right there the focus that what you're focused on is really the the key here
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:53.160]  where i think people need to understand that the picture is a lot bigger so how did you know first
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:57.560]  that they really plan to bring in radical jihadis and people and teach it in schools what what is the
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:04.040]  sick freak plan there well and you know look i i'm i'm not the smartest bar you know not the
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.760]  brightest bulb in the bunch so i i've had some good sources tell me okay this is what they're
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:14.840]  going to do their ultimate objective uh is to is to criminalize the current forms of the three
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:20.200]  monotheistic religions here in the in the united states to Judaism Christianity and Islam if you
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:25.720]  can believe that uh distill all three religions monotheistic religions to create a state religion
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:30.760]  that's compatible where where all religions are compatible with one another the u n plan so get
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:34.520]  us all together bring in radicals have us fight and kill each other and then take all our rights to
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.640]  create safety that's right and yes in order to do that they've got to rip down the existing
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:43.880]  infrastructure in order to create a new one just like the phoenix and as you've gone through some
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:47.800]  of you say you're not the smartest bulb i mean you you just crystallize that better than i ever
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:51.720]  could and that is the plan now is that what your federal sources told you because you were saying
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:55.960]  this eight nine years ago yeah yeah exactly that that's what they were saying i was having a hard
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:01.160]  time really understanding what the big plan was i was so focused on these small skirmishes or these
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.320]  individual disparate events that i wasn't seeing the big picture and what you've done is to crystallize
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.520]  the big picture and others when you want you see the big picture and understand how one event works
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:17.320]  in tandem with there's no going back that's it and so for example the war in Syria is connected to
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.640]  the uh illegal immigration of aliens here in the united states which is connected to the
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:25.960]  criminalization of free speech which is connected to the second amendment and people will stand in
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.360]  the way like scalia uh of the first and second amendment i mean everything is connected and
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:35.640]  once you see that that that the wheels in motion those little cogs the moving parts and you can
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:39.880]  see and there's unity of agenda it's the same rhetoric to bring in the jihadi's here is it is
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:44.040]  in europe you can see the unified power hagman and hagman dot com folks you want to check out
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.880]  that side see the show and the video is amazing information we're going to come back with him
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:53.160]  get more into this in your phone calls it's just like you said once you once you see the big picture
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:58.840]  folks it's just chilling again i'm getting chills all over me right now we are in danger we are in
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:04.680]  danger hillary clinton says if she becomes president she'd like to open up the government files on
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:10.120]  area 51 once and for all she said if there's something there unless it's a threat to national
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.680]  security we ought to share it with the public so clinton's willing to disclose classified
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:20.680]  briefings about extraterrestrial life but sets up a secret server to hide her own emails those
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:26.200]  must be some top secret communications newly disclosed clinton emails show that officials in
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:31.000]  the it office were baffled when they were told that a young technician would join them as a
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.160]  political appointee the technician brian pagliano was running the off-grid email server that clinton
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:42.840]  had him set up in her new york home for her work as secretary of state clinton paid him separately
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:49.080]  to maintain the server now clinton has admitted that she tries not to lie but she didn't say anything
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:54.840]  about willfully participating in a campaign of misinformation the truth is out there

[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:15.240]  jones show you can love him you can hate him but jesse ventura is known as one of the consummate
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:21.400]  political mavericks uh they say he basically wrote the book that arnold used to get elected as governor
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:25.640]  and then of course now so many other politicians have modeled insurrection campaigns off of jesse
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:31.320]  ventura he of course was an insurrectionist mayor and then of course a governor he also was a top
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:37.000]  entertainment wrestler and movie star and bestselling author and he joins a series also a
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:44.120]  friend of mine i was part of two seasons of his investigative report conspiracy theory and now we
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:48.280]  have newt genridge coming out saying donald trump isn't part of the elite secret societies with a
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:52.840]  straight face that's why they're after him well jesse ventura is known him for multiple decades
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:57.720]  they're friends play golf eat dinner hang out he said you know six months ago and i was looking at
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:02.760]  donald trump he said no he's for real it's exactly what you see it is an incredible spectacle but
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:07.720]  here's the bigger question will jesse ventura throw his hat in the ring and run he has basically said
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:13.320]  we'll have him go into it in more detail uh that uh if it's an establishment candidate like hillary
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.520]  erubio that it looks like a green line how would that happen libertarian party because i like uh
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:22.440]  somebody like macafe but you know the more serious candidate would be a libertarian nomination
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.360]  because they're in all 50 states on the ballot you got to have that ballot access would be jesse
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:33.640]  ventura hi alex great to be here yeah yeah first of all let me state this with all the current
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:39.320]  candidates that you have out there and that have been out there within the last four to five months
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:44.920]  i know a lot of them have dropped out i have one thing that none of them candidates have
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:52.120]  i have one thing that trump's money can't buy i have one thing that none of these candidates
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:58.920]  have you know what that is alex tell me i have an honorable discharge from the united states navy
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:07.480]  where i served from september the 11th 1969 until september the 10th 1975 six years for
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:15.080]  unactive duty two years in the reserves every republican candidate right now has stated that
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:22.200]  they would commit a war crime that if if the situation arose they would okay torture they
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:29.880]  try to one up each other on what they did well and the point is that is a war crime alex if i
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:36.840]  did that as a member of the military and i took an oath i would not receive an honorable discharge
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:46.440]  committing a war crime i agree often the alleged leader of the military openly admit that he would
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:52.200]  commit that he or she would commit war crimes are you kidding me i'm glad you raised this because
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:57.880]  that's my biggest issue with trump is he tells the truth about 9 11 and saudi arabia does great
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:05.240]  things but then he flips over and says you know we'll go after the wives of terrorists it's just
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:10.440]  we haven't had a veteran in the right house for a long long time well certainly in a combat
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:16.360]  event like jfk jfk jfk was a hero he was blown up you know in that pt boat fight the battleship
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:24.040]  in a p even nixon served giving back to it alex it's it's time to elect a veteran instead of not
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:31.080]  uh in someone that knows what it's like to take an oath and to be prepared to die for your country
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:36.520]  none of these presidential candidates right now have ever did that none of them so one of your
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:41.480]  own words i saw a newspaper article but i don't trust newspapers that the time they lie where are
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:46.200]  you on running for president what is the climate or what is the circumstances that will induce you
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:53.960]  to run well right now it's about a 30-day window i have roughly to inform i've i've been in contact
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:51:00.440]  with the with the libertarian party they have formally invited me to their to their uh convention
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:07.320]  in orlando and that's where they give out their nomination or you know support and you're you go
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:12.920]  on the ballot as the libertarian's choice for president uh it's totally personal now for me
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:21.560]  whether i want to get involved at that level and go 24 7 and put myself through what a campaign
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:30.600]  from june through november would do to me and my family uh but right now i don't see anybody out
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:38.440]  there bernie sanders i talked with him a couple days ago and he unequivocally told me that if he
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:44.280]  loses which chances are he's going to he's got a remarkable thing but hillary's got the super
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:52.360]  delegates so that's the fix and uh what if bernie loses he is going to endorse hillary which to me
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:52:00.200]  stops the revolution how do you get on board with somebody you've just accused of being
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:06.920]  owned by wall street who is stealing the popular vote with super delegates well yeah and here's
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:12.760]  what i think they got in mind let me project this out that this with these two parties you notice
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:18.280]  all the candidates agree they'll support whoever the party chooses well that shows loyalty to the
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:23.320]  party not the country that shows their true colors they're loyal to their party that's why
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:29.000]  george washington won a political party's band exactly and the but the thing is here's what i
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:35.320]  think is going to happen alex i think sanders will lose and then he will endorse hillary and
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:42.600]  hillary may take him as the vp and that way it'll attempt to bring the sanders people in line with
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:48.840]  the clinton people and if that happens they certainly will defeat the republican yeah because
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:52.360]  if they don't bring sanders in a lot of these people are going to go trump they've said that the
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:57.160]  polls show that where would the sanders people prefer to go and where would the trump people
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:03.720]  prefer to go if they don't make it to a jesse ventura to a libertarian truly a centrist i'm in
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:08.760]  the middle i don't need to go to the far left i don't need to go to the far right that's how i
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:15.320]  won minnesota the republican norm colman had to appease the far right skip Humphrey had to appease
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:21.640]  the far left i had the center which wins it they couldn't get back in the middle i agreed let me
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:25.800]  inject this question i read in the newspaper report that i covered yesterday that you did
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:30.680]  the paraphrase you said look if it's not sanders or it's not trump if it's not an anti-establishment
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:35.480]  candidate i'm gonna run probably is a libertarian and then you got 30 days to do it specifically
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:46.200]  you're saying what uh and i i mean are you leaning 64 40 it's it's 50 50 right now i'm i want to see
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:52.280]  who wins these final marks things so we're pretty sure then who the two candidates are going to be
[01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:57.000]  but you never know i mean they could go to that convention and they could take it right away from
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.440]  donald if they want i was about to say would you run against donald trump sure if i choose to run
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:07.880]  and he's the republican candidate i run against republicans and democrats regardless of no i
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:14.280]  understand but surely the the the trump thing is an anti-establishment run that's true but maybe
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:21.000]  maybe a lot of anti-establishment i you know donald still supports you know torturing people
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:27.720]  he's going to blow up and and exploit the wars more all of these so you've gone from a month ago
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.560]  saying you like donald but he's his torture comments are pushing over the edge to maybe
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:36.280]  ready to run up against him well not just that but his war comments they're all going to go to war
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:43.560]  again separately ships off the coast of china north korea threatening to use nukes uh us proxy war
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:48.680]  in ukraine uh starting war with russia it seems like our leader going insane what would you say
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:54.120]  about the state of the climate of the world right now politically well i'd say that the united states
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:55:00.840]  needs to stop being the major force of the war throughout the world because every world that
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:07.720]  happens now we're involved in it in one way or another and i'm sick of it you know people i want
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:13.880]  to break this spell to everybody thinks you have to elect a democrat or republican why you're running
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:20.120]  i can tell you're running why why do you have to elect them jesse i sense more energy than you
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:25.400]  then in the ten years i've known you you're more aggressive like you use you're running for president
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:33.000]  buddy no i ain't i'm 50 50 i'm gonna watch what happens this month no i think you recognize
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.360]  history's happening this is a special election and you want to be heard bare minimum you cannot lose
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.520]  when it comes to injecting real issues and so i think you're running for president you you're
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:50.440]  i think you're doing it well alex all i'll do with that is they don't hold your breath on it so
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:54.440]  much more is happening in the world uh the reason i would say right i don't want you to kill yourself
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:59.880]  doing it i know you've been through a lot but i know if you ran you you would run to win uh i love
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.360]  seeing the trump phenomenon of a maverick i know you're a real maverick i have questions about
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:08.600]  trump i think he's a good guy you say he's a good guy i'm supporting him right now but i would love
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:13.640]  for you to run just because the bully pulpit you'd get and i'd love to be able to you know let me
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:18.280]  know i'll be there at that press conference when you announce okay well like i said if i do it
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:23.400]  i'm doing it to give people and i believe they're really seeking a national alternative to the
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:29.560]  democrats and republicans because if you elect a democrat a republican you get the party with it
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:36.360]  no matter what anybody says would you take would you consider taking a position in a trump administration
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:44.360]  i probably doubt that because i i like bernie sanders endorsing hillary i don't ever want to
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:49.960]  lose my integrity and become part of those two parties in any way shape or form i know you're
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:53.400]  working on two big books i know the subjects they are bombshell i think this has been one of your
