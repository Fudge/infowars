[01:53.880 --> 02:01.840]  bizarre position an amazing position I'm on the phone with Luke Radowski about to confront the

[03:47.440 --> 03:53.120]  that are speaking out and really digging this dirt out just how far out on the edge we are

[08:02.120 --> 08:08.120]  network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:16.120 --> 08:21.560]  Washington Mutual largest bank failure in U.S. history even bigger than bank failures in the
[08:21.560 --> 08:30.760]  Great Depression has taken place a few weeks ago the previous largest bank failure in history
[08:30.760 --> 08:35.560]  happened that record now smash yesterday and this morning
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.200]  wamiu is seized sold off to J.P. Morgan in largest failure in U.S. banking history now
[08:46.200 --> 08:52.840]  remember J.P. Morgan at Chase is the dominant shareholder in the private fellow reserve
[08:52.840 --> 09:00.600]  they control the issuance of liquidity and they control the treasury which is now basically
[09:00.600 --> 09:07.560]  being taken over by them in this bailout plan goes forward the way that Henry Paulson wants it
[09:09.160 --> 09:14.280]  so people are asking what bank is safe to put their money in I don't even know if Chase Manhattan
[09:14.280 --> 09:19.960]  city bank is quote safe because they will just move assets out the back door and the raw infrastructure
[09:19.960 --> 09:29.000]  that they've been grabbing up that was the whole point of globalism you know that the tax incentives
[09:29.000 --> 09:36.520]  for companies to move overseas everything has been about waging economic war against the
[09:36.520 --> 09:42.680]  population so wamiu is seized sold off to J.P. Morgan in largest failure in U.S. banking history
[09:44.120 --> 09:48.120]  in what is by far the largest bank failure in the U.S. history federal regulators sees
[09:48.120 --> 09:52.760]  Washington Mutual Inc now remember you have a select group of private banks that hold
[09:52.760 --> 09:57.400]  fellow reserve stock that have their minion pulse and running the treasury and they decide
[09:57.400 --> 10:04.440]  what to grab they decide who to go after and in all this hysteria there's no discussion if that
[10:04.440 --> 10:11.480]  bank was more solvent or less solvent than J.P. Morgan Chase see how that works so they're able
[10:11.480 --> 10:17.000]  to take over whatever banks they want regional local international anything based here national
[10:17.880 --> 10:24.120]  they're able to pay whatever they want for the assets they're able to make us pay for them
[10:24.120 --> 10:30.200]  they're able to shift those assets into other banks and then in the quote bailout put into the
[10:30.200 --> 10:37.240]  treasury only the bad assets and the bad securities i mean there is and none of it is
[10:37.240 --> 10:41.800]  allowed to be reviewed none of it is allowed to be even looked at by any agency the federal
[10:41.800 --> 10:52.360]  government any state agency any any branch of government congress it's just staggering and
[10:52.360 --> 10:56.760]  they've of course banned short trades but only against select financial institutions turning
[10:57.880 --> 11:02.120]  all the previous bailout money loose to go leverage and attack all the real
[11:02.120 --> 11:06.040]  companies in the real economy that actually manufacture things or make things
[11:08.040 --> 11:12.520]  it's it is organized financial armageddon and i'm sure they'll get their little bailout
[11:13.400 --> 11:17.640]  and then that'll just be one more suckering of the public but but the money the five trillion
[11:17.640 --> 11:24.120]  the Bloomberg reports it really is it's probably more not 700 billion that's only one small part
[11:24.120 --> 11:28.600]  of this that's the diversion that's what they're giving attention to their masters at misdirection
[11:30.200 --> 11:36.200]  the real issue is the powers the new branch of government that is outside of government
[11:36.200 --> 11:43.000]  and unaccountable to the other three branches this is this is fascism this is total domination by
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.000]  private corporations with governmental power through the treasury just like they're setting up in
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.440]  england global carbon trading and you buy your carbon credits be able to drive your car or heat
[11:54.440 --> 12:00.600]  your house or eat steak they say they're going to tax you from the private banks i mean this is
[12:00.600 --> 12:09.240]  they are becoming government right now wama sea sold off to jp morgan and largest failure in us
[12:09.240 --> 12:16.440]  banking history polosi sales bailout plan has to pass
[12:19.240 --> 12:24.440]  so they're holding everyone hostage we'll get into that report mccain remains undecided about
[12:24.440 --> 12:28.360]  the debate with obama again this is all about making himself the center of attention and
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.720]  oh he cares so much what will he do will they get it passed or will he cancel the debate because
[12:33.720 --> 12:38.920]  it's so serious to make it look like he'll actually run something or obama will run something making
[12:38.920 --> 12:48.040]  these two puppets look like they're actually in a power position grandstanding hong kong police
[12:48.040 --> 12:53.720]  arrest 11 for spreading rumors about aig hong kong police arrested 11 spreading rumors aig is selling
[12:53.720 --> 13:01.000]  its agents subsidiary scientists warn u.s congress of cancer at risk for cell phones i want to get
[13:01.000 --> 13:09.640]  more into that today uh back to all the diversions in the media you know mccain caught lying the cbs
[13:09.640 --> 13:16.680]  broadcast center in mad hatton has feeds to hundreds of local affiliates they produce the news for
[13:16.680 --> 13:25.480]  fox they produce the news for abc they produce the news for everyone but nbc it's basically a cia
[13:25.480 --> 13:31.880]  pentagon operation and that's come out in congressional reports decades ago and so of course the producers
[13:33.320 --> 13:42.360]  there uh with the cbs show late night with david letterman were able to dial in to the room where
[13:42.360 --> 13:53.880]  he was being interviewed by another cbs show and and show the taped interview going on and show that
[13:53.880 --> 14:00.520]  he lied he wasn't rushing off to washington to save everyone a few days ago and of course he
[14:00.520 --> 14:06.600]  lied everyone's i can't believe john mccain did well wouldn't chop down a cherry tree i mean
[14:06.600 --> 14:15.160]  mr anti-corruption the the the name and integrity is mccain mccain ran the keating five theft his
[14:15.160 --> 14:23.960]  wife is a mafia princess i mean that these people are hard core and everyone's i can't believe he
[14:23.960 --> 14:32.120]  lies oh my god all right people won't talk radio going if you can't trust mccain you can't trust
[14:32.120 --> 14:44.760]  nothing i mean my my goodness oh my gosh i mean heaven help us he wasn't tortured all
[14:44.760 --> 14:50.760]  the eyewitnesses have gone public he wasn't tortured he was sent to the hanoi hotel he left the
[14:50.760 --> 14:57.080]  hanoi torture center he was lavish with prostitutes he turned everybody over he gave out all the
[14:57.080 --> 15:05.480]  codes his daddy was the head of the pacific fleet and it doesn't matter he's a puppet to begin with
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.880]  and no because i'm criticizing mccain does not mean i'm weighing in saying vote for obama i'm saying
[15:11.880 --> 15:17.400]  they are actors period
[15:20.280 --> 15:24.120]  and so they've got their whole everyone hostage oh look the stock market's going down right now
[15:24.120 --> 15:30.280]  wama went under and more is going to go under because you didn't go for the bailout as if even
[15:30.280 --> 15:34.040]  if they had passed the bailout yesterday as if that would have done anything as if the money
[15:34.040 --> 15:41.640]  wouldn't have gone directly to goldman sacks and jp morgan chase to go in and forcibly
[15:41.640 --> 15:48.760]  take over other banks like wama that said nothing but a war chest to go out and wage war on the real
[15:48.760 --> 15:56.440]  economy and drive down with shorts and attack all the other real corporations and companies
[15:56.440 --> 16:03.320]  that aren't financial institutions they're going in and attacking them while at the same time attacking
[16:03.320 --> 16:09.080]  regional banks and others that didn't engage in all these scams they're attacking a lot of healthy
[16:09.080 --> 16:13.800]  regional banks that's who they want that's who they want to take over and the private banks
[16:13.800 --> 16:19.000]  the private phone reserve shareholders who control the federal regulators are going out
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.880]  and going after whoever they want and they triggered all of this
[16:29.640 --> 16:35.080]  by claiming that it was all caused by people lying on subprime mortgage
[16:35.080 --> 16:42.920]  and adjustable rate mortgages and fraudulent jumbo loans for housing of over five hundred
[16:42.920 --> 16:49.320]  thousand dollars when you're talking about depending on whose numbers you look 55 billion 61
[16:49.320 --> 16:57.240]  billion 100 billion it's not over a hundred billion chicken feed we're talking about two
[16:57.240 --> 17:02.600]  or three months in iraq depending on what year you look at you're looking at nothing
[17:02.600 --> 17:08.760]  nothing with the way they're inflating the currency they could object forgiven the entire
[17:08.760 --> 17:13.320]  loans given the people their houses and i'm not saying do that because it sends the wrong message
[17:13.320 --> 17:19.720]  but do that before you give a blank check and say that the treasury is a dictatorship through the
[17:19.720 --> 17:25.160]  federal reserve and no branch of government can even review and everything they do secret
[17:25.800 --> 17:30.760]  that's bigger than the national security act of 1947 that at least on the surface
[17:30.760 --> 17:37.160]  had the intelligence committee chairman reviewing what the cia was up to and the 15 other agencies
[17:37.160 --> 17:44.920]  that crawled out from underneath its skirt and then those all laid eggs and then those babies
[17:44.920 --> 17:49.400]  laid eggs until there's hundreds of agencies and then hundreds of private corporations
[17:49.400 --> 17:54.360]  now gathering more intelligence and running more intelligence operations than the 30 something
[17:54.360 --> 18:01.080]  intelligence agencies you understand it is and why shouldn't it grow a blackout government
[18:01.720 --> 18:06.040]  shipping in the narcotics doing whatever they want counterfeiting whatever money they want
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.320]  controlling regulators they just went wild and said you know what boys let's take it all
[18:11.960 --> 18:16.680]  and they said well the people are going to get mad they said execute the operation begin building
[18:16.680 --> 18:21.480]  FEMA camps covertly start buying off local governments sheet dip any troops that say
[18:21.480 --> 18:27.160]  they'll shoot at us citizens put them into domestic intelligence operations start taking
[18:27.160 --> 18:31.240]  over the governments use the drug war as the cover then we'll stage terror attacks when we
[18:31.240 --> 18:35.560]  really go public with the police state and then we'll implode the economy and use the police state
[18:35.560 --> 18:41.000]  to suppress the public so they can't bring us to justice execute order number 66 and you know
[18:41.000 --> 18:47.640]  what they executed that sucker in the mid 1980s and now 25 years later ladies and gentlemen
[18:47.640 --> 18:59.400]  we are entering Hades 24 and a half years later we are in deep trouble these are bank robbers
[18:59.400 --> 19:03.320]  they don't care about the economy they don't care about your pension funds they don't care
[19:03.320 --> 19:09.560]  about the bridges collapsing they don't care about poison food or melamine plastic in your food or
[19:09.560 --> 19:18.600]  letter mercury they don't care about anything they are going for broke you are being taken i
[19:18.600 --> 19:24.680]  am being taken our future is being destroyed right in front of us and the public's learned to hate
[19:24.680 --> 19:32.920]  washington and not trust them but they don't have one one hundredth of an idea of just how bad it
[19:32.920 --> 19:42.760]  really is i predict they're going to get part of their bailout and then they are in the next six
[19:42.760 --> 19:47.560]  months going to completely plunge us into a total collapse and consolidate everything now that's
[19:47.560 --> 19:52.760]  probably what's going to happen there's something else that could happen as well we'll talk about
[19:52.760 --> 19:56.680]  that when you get back and take your phone calls one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one

[25:36.120 --> 25:40.680]  but still by and large the people were upright they were strong they were focused they were
[25:40.680 --> 25:46.280]  untrusting of government and so we had 10 plus percent growth rates on a yearly average
[25:47.160 --> 25:53.880]  the people were much more upstanding adversity makes men and of course milk and honey plenty
[25:53.880 --> 26:01.480]  makes monsters and you can deny police and military that the government's totally criminal

[26:42.680 --> 26:48.920]  they still buy into george bush and almost cry when he's on tv and if you try to tell them that
[26:48.920 --> 26:54.440]  george bush has lines of homosexual prostitutes coming into serving and you try to tell him
[26:54.440 --> 27:00.120]  that george bush wants amnesty or george bush tried to sign the assault weapons ban they'll
[27:00.120 --> 27:07.960]  call you a liar because they don't want to know they want to believe that everything's good and
[27:07.960 --> 27:14.280]  everything's okay well let me give you a news flash it doesn't make it okay it doesn't make it go away
[27:14.280 --> 27:22.520]  it doesn't make me a liar just because people say i'm a liar you don't think i wouldn't like to sit
[27:22.520 --> 27:27.320]  around watching john wane movies and drinking beer and rapping myself in an american flag and
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.520]  go to going to n r a meetings and hanging out and bashing stupid liberals all day

[27:37.240 --> 27:41.800]  while he's you know listen to him while he's popping heroin pills every five minutes and
[27:41.800 --> 27:47.480]  giggle and snicker along with it but i can't do that no more than i can be some foolish democrat
[27:47.480 --> 27:56.120]  believing bill clinton or barack obama is going to save us and it's time to just grow up and admit
[27:56.120 --> 28:03.240]  that to ourselves or pay the piper now if the five trillion that's what it is it's more than five
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.720]  trillion but bloomberg and others are saying five trillion dallas morning news is saying four trillion
[28:07.720 --> 28:13.320]  it's trillions it isn't seven hundred billion anyway you slice it a bailout on average is about
[28:13.320 --> 28:19.240]  seven times bigger looking at the last four big bailouts in the last 50 years they're generally
[28:19.240 --> 28:25.400]  seven times larger so we're talking five trillion of its seven hundred billion
[28:28.840 --> 28:33.640]  now for those that don't know that's many times the gdp every year with the gdp's up at three
[28:33.640 --> 28:41.000]  billions that's almost twice that and you're gonna pay interest on that ladies and gentlemen
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.600]  they're going to sell that debt they're going to sell those government bonds and private institutions
[28:47.320 --> 28:53.320]  banks and others are going to buy it and then you're going to pay not just for it but for the
[28:53.320 --> 29:04.600]  interest on that okay comprende do you got me is it clear do you comprehend it
[29:04.600 --> 29:17.480]  comprende there isn't time to screw around anymore so they can get their bailout which is
[29:17.480 --> 29:21.240]  again that's only the front the real issue is is that they give them a new branch of government
[29:21.240 --> 29:28.920]  and imperial power totally lawless above the law that itself is a fraud congress can't do that
[29:28.920 --> 29:36.600]  and the what the and the treasury can't declare it or they'll let it fail and claim that it was
[29:36.600 --> 29:39.880]  because we didn't do whatever they wanted then the public will say okay do whatever you want
[29:39.880 --> 29:47.400]  and then they get what they want anyways so um we're gonna come back and take your calls again

[38:52.600 --> 38:57.400]  how wonderful innocent my children are like i could before because i know that the whole world's
[38:57.400 --> 39:04.840]  being turned upside down on its head and we as a society don't have time to fight with our bosses
[39:04.840 --> 39:08.600]  and our employees we don't have time to fight with our wives and our husbands we don't have
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.000]  time to fight with our children children young people don't you don't have time to go home and
[39:13.000 --> 39:20.520]  get in arguments with your parents end the sick behavior america stop the abortions stop not
[39:20.520 --> 39:26.200]  taking care of your parents and nursing homes stop being an evil people and hit your knees and
[39:26.200 --> 39:32.680]  ask god to forgive you and then repent and change our ways because that's why this is happening
[39:32.680 --> 39:37.480]  we can blame government all day long we can blame the cops all day long we can blame the lobbyist
[39:37.480 --> 39:42.360]  all day long we can blame them all day long but let me tell you who really is to blame for all of
[39:42.360 --> 39:51.880]  this look in the mirror and that's where you'll see the culprit hell when i look in the mirror
[39:51.880 --> 39:58.520]  myself i see the culprit i've been worldly i'm not perfect if i would have known just how real
[39:58.520 --> 40:02.840]  this was or just how serious this was over a decade ago i know i thought i had knowledge and i only
[40:02.840 --> 40:09.640]  had a glimpse now sometimes i'm like god please don't give me more don't give me more discernment
[40:09.640 --> 40:15.080]  no but then i know that i need that discernment to try to lead people and try to wake people up
[40:15.080 --> 40:19.320]  and so that's why this show's gotten more serious that's why it's gotten more eloquent more focused
[40:19.320 --> 40:24.520]  more controlled does that mean we're perfect no we got a long way to go and a short time to get there
[40:24.520 --> 40:31.640]  so drop that hammer down and give him hell because ladies and gentlemen
[40:33.640 --> 40:41.480]  this system is coming down on us order out of chaos oh god
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.720]  it's one thing to intellectually know what they're going to do it's one thing to read
[40:47.720 --> 40:52.680]  their white papers and think tank documents and military battle plans and the socio-economic
[40:52.680 --> 40:59.640]  social architecture but it's another thing to see it put into function it's the it's the equivalent
[40:59.640 --> 41:07.720]  of looking at a photo of a grizzly bear or being in a room with one it's one thing to look at a
[41:07.720 --> 41:13.480]  grizzly bear with a pair of binoculars 500 yards away down on some plateau below you from a hilltop
[41:14.680 --> 41:21.560]  it's another thing to unzip the tent door and step out there's a grizzly bear standing 10 feet away
[41:21.560 --> 41:28.760]  from you digging in your ice chest and so I saw the grizzly bear down the plateau I said he's coming
[41:28.760 --> 41:32.680]  that way I said hey I just saw a grizzly bear down there to the other people in the camp I said
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.640]  there are grizzly bears here you know we are in Wyoming we are in Utah we are in
[41:39.960 --> 41:42.680]  Canada we are in a place that has grizzly bears
[41:42.680 --> 41:49.880]  or it's like being in a place in Canada that has Kodiaks the mega grizzly bear
[41:54.280 --> 41:58.680]  and hey I just saw a grizzly bear down there it looked like he's coming this way we might want
[41:58.680 --> 42:04.280]  to climb trees or we might want to do something you saw a grizzly bear you saw a grizzly bear
[42:04.280 --> 42:08.760]  and I'm like no I really did see a grizzly bear it's it's coming this way and now the grizzly bear
[42:08.760 --> 42:18.200]  is five feet from you for a lot of people the grizzly bears already grabbed them if they
[42:18.200 --> 42:23.560]  stole your children took them from you if they if the IRS because it's an accounting error
[42:23.560 --> 42:27.800]  but the government can do whatever they want make whatever mistakes are in crime you know but it's
[42:27.800 --> 42:36.440]  all the books thrown at you or have you lost your job to some illegal alien who lost their farm
[42:36.440 --> 42:41.640]  their ancestral cornfield because we supported Chase Manhattan and Citibank stealing it from them
[42:41.640 --> 42:46.680]  so we laughed at them we we embraced globalism so we took their jobs so they came up here and
[42:46.680 --> 42:55.480]  took our job so you really can't say anything to them can you those poor immigrants yeah I say
[42:55.480 --> 43:01.000]  kick them out of here only because that's part of the new world order plan and because we can't
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.520]  take on billions of third world starving people you know what I just I just yeah I said I'd take
[43:06.520 --> 43:11.160]  your calls I'm gonna go to him here no matter it's just everything has relationships everything
[43:11.160 --> 43:15.480]  has interconnections and to see the interconnections to see how it's all together and to see how the
[43:15.480 --> 43:19.880]  new world order is playing it and to know what the new order is going to say and do and then to
[43:19.880 --> 43:24.840]  open up a new white paper or open up a new report by them and to know what it's going to say before
[43:24.840 --> 43:30.520]  you read it and then to be seconded by them admitting what they're doing and then to know
[43:30.520 --> 43:36.280]  that the analysis is correct and to know that where all this is going is spot on and to know
[43:36.280 --> 43:43.800]  that I'm right and so many others are right that freaks me out because it's one thing to talk about
[43:43.800 --> 43:49.560]  extermination and FEMA camps and mass arrest it's another thing to know it's coming just as
[43:49.560 --> 43:53.000]  sure as the sun came up this morning just as sure as it's going to set this evening
[43:53.000 --> 44:04.920]  you know we have enough IMF World Bank World Health Organization documents we have enough
[44:05.480 --> 44:09.880]  cases of where they've been caught putting cancer viruses and HIV and vaccines and
[44:09.880 --> 44:16.360]  hormones to sterilize women tied to the pathogens it's enough to you know confirm it over and over
[44:16.360 --> 44:20.920]  again but but then to have it confirmed through internal documents too you know have it confirmed
[44:20.920 --> 44:27.480]  by a whistleblower you think I jump up and down for joy oh we're exposing him oh we're making
[44:27.480 --> 44:34.360]  him look bad no it's the contrary it's like god I wish I was wrong gosh I wish it wasn't as bad
[44:34.360 --> 44:37.400]  as I thought but it's never as bad as I thought it's always worse
[44:43.480 --> 44:47.800]  so the biggest bank in US history is grabbed up by federal regulators and handed over to other
[44:47.800 --> 44:56.920]  private banks total scam Ron Paul is saying that Bernanke and uh grain spanning to be arrested
[44:57.640 --> 45:03.240]  and he lists why that's up on info wars dot com that needs to go viral because by exposing the
[45:03.240 --> 45:10.360]  people that are guilty of this financial theft and this looting instead of having fake solutions
[45:10.360 --> 45:14.440]  to give them more power and control to rob and steal from us more and go to the next phase we
[45:14.440 --> 45:21.480]  need to create a human crime we need to build a call for not a few CEOs of mid-level groups to be
[45:21.480 --> 45:28.520]  trotted out and given five years in prison and they'll get out in one when it's not really the
[45:28.520 --> 45:35.560]  CEOs it's the shareholders the big institutional foundational shareholders and the policy people
[45:35.560 --> 45:39.960]  that set that and change the laws to let them engage in these crimes but then they went ahead
[45:39.960 --> 45:45.480]  and went further and broke more laws they have to be we have to believe that we can bring them to
[45:45.480 --> 45:52.600]  justice that's what needs to be called for so a year from now two years from now five years from
[45:52.600 --> 45:57.160]  now if there is a rebellion and a resistance and somehow we ever get control of the government again
[45:57.160 --> 46:01.720]  so we can have these people extradited from europe and taken here and put on trial
[46:01.720 --> 46:10.440]  not rat line to some new country
[46:16.280 --> 46:19.480]  now i know ron paul's a man of integrity so i know he wouldn't duck the question he'd say
[46:19.480 --> 46:24.200]  they deserve prison and i'm happy in a declaration of independence to have my name
[46:24.760 --> 46:30.440]  on the article calling for their arrest i've signed my john hamcock i need you the listeners
[46:30.440 --> 46:36.360]  assign your john hamcock on the ron paul's john hamcock on that declaration of we want you to

[48:03.640 --> 48:09.560]  power to take over banks that aren't insolvent it's private banks with federal power grabbing
[48:09.560 --> 48:15.480]  everything it is not a bailout over us unless we give it to them we've got to get the word out
[48:15.480 --> 48:21.640]  that it's not a bailout it's another layer of the scam another level good to hear from you can
[48:21.640 --> 48:26.920]  i agree with you and uh you know i can't advocate people climbing up billboards of financial
[48:26.920 --> 48:31.720]  institutions and spray painting that it's a theft that it's that it's not a bailout that it's a scam
[48:32.760 --> 48:37.480]  but what i can't advocate is taking street shock that's not illegal it washes away
[48:38.200 --> 48:41.320]  and going out and putting messages all over your neighborhood sidewalks
[48:41.320 --> 48:49.640]  or going out and making a thousand copies at kinkos on a copier you know saying this is not
[48:49.640 --> 48:54.280]  a bailout it's a banker scam here are some websites that have news covering the fact
[48:54.280 --> 48:59.800]  that it's a theft and that they need to be arrested and if if thousands of you listeners
[48:59.800 --> 49:04.840]  and millions total will go out and do things like that will be knee deep in this information

[54:28.920 --> 54:36.520]  deadlines and commitments what to leave in what to leave out against the wind
[54:36.520 --> 54:45.080]  against the wind we were running against the wind we were young and strong
[54:48.120 --> 54:50.280]  we were still just running against the wind folks
[54:56.280 --> 54:57.080]  against the wind
[54:59.480 --> 55:00.920]  against the wind
[55:00.920 --> 55:05.480]  against the wind
[55:08.600 --> 55:15.480]  oh man you really see these criminals bringing our country down fully bankrupting it for themselves
[55:15.480 --> 55:20.600]  so they can gobble up the pieces is amazing rob in washington you're on the air go ahead
[55:21.480 --> 55:25.640]  rob dropped okay let me talk to jimmy in tennessee you're on the air jimmy
[55:25.640 --> 55:35.240]  oh hello yes uh i like the advice about um looking in the mirror um i think a lot of
[55:35.240 --> 55:39.560]  times though uh the people don't take action because it's sort of like um when someone
[55:39.560 --> 55:44.040]  paints and you say call 9-1-1 and no one does because they think the other person's going to
[55:44.040 --> 55:48.920]  do it but you're not even talking about people not being able to get the point of calling
[55:48.920 --> 55:56.680]  9-1-1 um when i saw a woman choking one time everybody just stood around saying call 9-1-1
[55:56.680 --> 56:01.880]  and they had to form a committee about who was going to call 9-1-1 so i just went over to the
[56:01.880 --> 56:06.200]  heimlich maneuver and you're right we have been trained to sit and wait for somebody else to do
[56:06.200 --> 56:16.520]  it for us and um a good way to um attack them is uh you can easily take youtube videos off
[56:16.520 --> 56:23.880]  of the convert film uh even if you didn't make the video and take 9-11 truth videos and economic
[56:23.880 --> 56:30.760]  videos and convert them using keepid.com and put them on our CDs and put them on the CDs
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.720]  save them so that if the internet goes down but also put them on to like medic cafe daily
[56:35.720 --> 56:41.560]  motion and just we could flood those whole sites with now 11 truth well i'm glad to see that people
[56:41.560 --> 56:46.280]  are flooding our information more than ever on the web so i say good job and good job to you
[56:46.280 --> 56:53.000]  jimmy adam in texas you're on the air hi i was wondering why you know i i don't hear you speak
[56:53.000 --> 56:59.720]  of the uh international property maintenance code in in relation to what's going on now and um i
[56:59.720 --> 57:04.440]  tell a lot of friends and people that i come in contact with that um that's the vehicle with
[57:04.440 --> 57:09.320]  which they're gonna have their uh their properties removed from them and uh i'll just i have for
[57:09.320 --> 57:14.840]  those that don't know uh our zoning laws that are being passed at the county and city and state level
[57:14.840 --> 57:21.880]  are internationally codified then they take your locals you know most your local uh bureaucrats and
[57:21.880 --> 57:27.160]  whine and dine them and even pay them off to come back and then pass standardized rules
[57:27.160 --> 57:33.000]  to shut down family farms ranches homes to take property uh and and yes sir it's all part of
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.160]  the predatory system i can ask you another question and we actually have covered that in
[57:37.160 --> 57:43.480]  detail but go ahead uh i've got a good hour and a half of uh music that i would love to uh play

[1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:55.000]  with calls and financial news and information as we track the um private banking takeover of the
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.600]  federal government is a new fourth branch of all powerful government is set up with dictatorial powers
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:07.320]  to the department of treasury above the president and everyone else a supreme emperor i mean that's
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:12.040]  what it is it's what it states and by the way it's in the new version as well not even stripped
[1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:16.680]  people couldn't believe that was in there and thought it would be stripped well no they're
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:21.560]  going for broke they flew planes into buildings ladies and gentlemen and kill 3000 people to
[1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:30.840]  scare the population into going along with them and so that's basically what's happened
[1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:35.960]  just a program that on the willy nelson thing what happened is willy nelson has invited me
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:41.560]  and jesse ventura to come speak at one of his already set events a very special event it's
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:45.560]  going to have a lot of uh i had no idea until a few days ago and i went went over there
[1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:50.600]  for some preparations over to uh some of their offices about who's going to be at the event
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:55.480]  and uh it'll be free streamed over the internet folks that's all i can tell you
[1:01:56.120 --> 1:02:01.160]  on that subject next few weeks i'll i'll tell you more details uh okay let's go ahead now it
[1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:05.320]  it really isn't serious to call it and say hey i won't complain for an hour and a half at your
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:10.680]  event i won't i don't even know who you are uh it's not my event so let's get that straight
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:15.000]  let's uh go ahead and talk to mike in tennessee mike you're on the air
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:22.680]  go ahead mike alex demore um right now we have an opportunity a unique opportunity for people
[1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:27.560]  living in the around the ministry we can drive down to old miss which is about a 40 mile drive
[1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:32.920]  we can hold up banners and we can take poster boards and and make sayings or slogans like to
[1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:39.080]  fail out as a fraud or or slogans like i would go to the n w o debates but i already get it
[1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:44.200]  w w f on cable you know something something to bring people's attention to the fact that
[1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:49.960]  that this is a farce and it's like you said the other day it's just it's great drama it's it but
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:55.400]  it's like wrestling it's all preplanned it's all laid out in advance and at the end of the day
[1:02:55.400 --> 1:03:01.960]  these guys get together shake hands go have a beer and and their buddies um i think that people can
[1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:08.520]  get up off their couches take off work and go down there and and make a noise and wake people up
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:16.280]  because the media is there today and um i agree but but but also because new york was lost over
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:20.840]  200 million dollars worth of lawsuits other cities are losing lawsuits for the free speech zones
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:26.520]  go down there the the the uh secret service and others may try to keep you two or three miles away
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:31.400]  in some field where nobody can see you but then that becomes a news issue in and of itself in
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:36.520]  the papers uh and so to continue to expose that we're now in some type of new soviet union
[1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:41.080]  union so that's another reason to go down there but sometimes they don't get their stuff together
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:45.480]  and keep people from protesting and demonstrating and sometimes the first amendment still makes it
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:51.000]  through the iron curtain and so a great idea well thank you and i appreciate you playing
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  quarterflash music being a former memphian i i appreciate that and there's a group called
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.400]  casting crowns it's got a song the voice of truth it's very i think it'd be a perfect song for right
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:04.760]  about now good lyrics so uh thank you so much i appreciate your call we're gonna go ahead and
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:11.080]  get my guest online do we have her okay we have sent the i'm gonna introduce this when we come back
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:18.200]  this is really powerful information dangerous information for her somewhat for myself in this
[1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:26.760]  office uh on so many fronts so please take this for what it is very important information very
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:36.040]  powerful information and uh very very disgusting info as well we have to be careful there's a
[1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:43.160]  lot we can't tell you because then that will expose her and so i'm gonna let her basically
[1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:51.720]  lead with much of what she says because it's very easy to blow somebody's cover we'll be

[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:56.920]  just had to meet without your clothes and everybody
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:01.800]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us everybody knows
[1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:08.920]  websites are info wars dot com and prison planet dot com truth news dot us
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:15.800]  prison planet dot tv info wars dot com jones report dot com everybody knows
[1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:24.040]  the next hour and perhaps a little bit past we are joined by a scientist we will just
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:28.440]  leave it at that don't want to give out too much information but she said we could say that
[1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:33.320]  who has worked for some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:41.000]  has worked for the bill on melinda gates foundation and her own accord left because of
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:47.560]  moral reasons she has documented all of her claims to us in hundreds of pages of
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:56.680]  documents that were very hard to digest much of what we were already aware of
[1:10:56.680 --> 1:11:03.400]  so we know it's very credible and powerful information and i want her to date also talk
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:09.800]  about some of the things that appear to be some of the good things the bill on melinda gates
[1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:16.440]  foundation has done i want to be as fair as possible from her high level perspective
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:27.560]  this is a 80 plus billion dollar tax-free foundation it is closely integrated in with
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:35.000]  plan parenthood the world health organization the central intelligence agency it is the heart
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:44.200]  of the military industrial complex it is nested and sequestered in with the core new world order
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:52.040]  operations the tax-free foundations the Rockefeller foundations the Carnegie foundations and this is
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:12:06.040]  a window into the dark crevasses of the scientific dictatorship now there are wide areas we can
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:09.480]  discuss but don't want to bring Cynthia up on air now
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:15.720]  much of what she's going to be talking about can be reverse engineered if you want the
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:18.680]  documents for yourself she even told me i could post some of them but i don't even think i want
[1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:27.720]  to do that because of some issues and questions i think they could track it back to her but a lot of
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:34.280]  it can be found in world health imf world bank documents a lot of it is public but
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:39.240]  decentralized you can find different pieces of it we were actually able to take some of her
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:47.080]  documents and find them ourselves or pieces of them because governments and others do report
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:52.920]  on some of what's going on they are obsessed with security they are centralized heavily
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:13:02.600]  centralized in secret offices they meet in secret this is a major defection against the new world
[1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:12.360]  order this is uh this is big ladies and gentlemen and this is risky as well not just for our guests
[1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:20.200]  but for this radio show but i have a moral responsibility to put myself at risk and my radio
[1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:27.160]  show and what i do from all sorts of repercussions because innocence are threatened by this the
[1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:36.440]  rule of law is threatened and transparency is king okay uh Cynthia where do you think we should
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:41.160]  start maybe as much about yourself as you can tell the listeners and then some of the areas you've
[1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:46.760]  worked in without giving too many dates and then i think we should just get right into the hpv
[1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:52.760]  situation first but if you can give us a overview first off thank you for coming on thank you for
[1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:58.520]  your courage well thank you very much uh alex i really have always enjoyed your show and that's
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:05.160]  sort of why i contacted you here um first of all i want to say that i'm not suicidal and nor have i
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:12.280]  ever been or i don't think i will be so we just thought we had out because uh this is kind of a
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:20.040]  scary territory um i am a uh research scientist i started out working at the fda and i've worked
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:26.920]  for major universities and a lot of very cutting-edge major biotech and pharmaceutical companies
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:34.760]  and uh worked on drug development uh in the lab and then eventually worked my way into clinical
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:41.960]  research where um in the pre-clinical studies and then you know i've even written and designed
[1:14:41.960 --> 1:14:47.240]  clinical protocols for human trials and and the follow-ups and and things like that so i've been
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:54.840]  involved in all levels of um you know drug development and and biological research here so
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:15:01.400]  you know i sort of know what i speak and we can i can kind of weave in how big pharmaceutical
[1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:07.160]  companies are kind of in some ways no different than what's going on at the gays foundation
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:12.200]  so there's certain kind of overlapping practices that happen here that allow for
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:18.920]  lack of oversight and shenanigans to go on but i thought i'd like to start out just kind of briefly
[1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:24.440]  i think you're right with the hpv virus but um briefly with you know having worked in big pharma
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:28.360]  i was kind of very happy to go to work for the gays foundation because i thought they were doing
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:34.360]  a very you know altruistic work you know being very helpful towards people and they are i mean
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:39.080]  there's a lot of really wonderful programs they do they have a lot of oprah-like programs going
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:46.280]  on and they started out very uh you know oprah-like like working with the hillan keller foundation
[1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:52.600]  supporting them to prevent you know diseases that can cause blindness in third world countries by
[1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:59.240]  increasing you know how people conduct sanitation and things like that and a lot of that sort of
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:06.360]  that sort of programs are still ongoing and you know providing mosquito nets for people in
[1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:11.160]  malaria areas and with sleeping sickness and things like that so there's a lot of really
[1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:17.800]  wonderful programs that they are supporting and and helping people with having said that interspersed
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:26.200]  with all that there's a lot of um they're they're kind of moving they still have those basic programs
[1:16:26.200 --> 1:16:31.000]  going on but they're moving more now towards now that they've kind of established themselves
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.800]  in these different countries with these really great programs and which they probably should
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:44.600]  continue they're working more and more towards uh vaccinating people against i would say almost
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:52.600]  everything and um starting these really intense vaccination programs moving away from like say
[1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:59.720]  creating drugs that would help people for things and moving more towards creating vaccines and i
[1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:03.640]  wouldn't even call them and of course you're a scientist on this but i wouldn't even call them
[1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:07.240]  and we were talking yesterday these aren't even vaccines at the right word because
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:13.800]  this is genetic modifications we're talking about uh i mean you can't really even call these
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:19.640]  vaccines and except in the loosest of terms because we're talking about DNA altercations
[1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:26.440]  uh i mean changing DNA that's correct i mean like the old vaccines like the tetanus they would take
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:32.360]  the tetanus bacteria they would kill it which is called attenuated and then they would inject you
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:37.400]  with you know kind of like the dead bacteria and your body would go oh okay you know and when if
[1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:45.720]  you're exposed to tetanus now they're just taking weird protein sequences and growing them up in yeast
[1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:53.640]  and you know that are like one little part protein fragment of whatever they want to vaccinate against
[1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:59.880]  and so that's that's very disconcerting because you don't know they're putting in very weird random
[1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:06.760]  bits of protein and DNA and they're calling this the identifying marker for that particular
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:14.600]  disease or parasite or virus with no real testing and this is you were saying guinea pigging in the
[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:20.520]  field with experimental vaccines where yes we know it'll affect the protein in a particular
[1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:27.080]  type of worm but then it'll affect other things it'll affect other things and they don't know
[1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:33.720]  how it'll affect other things until they tested in in people and you know big pharmaceutical
[1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:38.920]  companies here get away with that too because i worked for one company and the FDA came back
[1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:43.640]  and told them they didn't have enough safety data so they wouldn't let them proceed until
[1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:49.480]  they did more safety trials well then what people don't know i mean this is kind of like an intermediate
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:55.960]  thing besides just testing them on third world people um poland and Czechoslovakia also have
[1:18:55.960 --> 1:19:03.640]  sites set up where u.s. companies can come in and go to the next level and test on people over there
[1:19:04.200 --> 1:19:09.320]  and so they would circumvent having to do more safety tests just go to the tests that they
[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:14.920]  wanted to like in poland and then go back to the FDA and say if they didn't kill these people in poland
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:18.680]  and so then they would proceed on but i want to flesh that out because that's a big deal and
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:22.920]  people may understand the magnitude of what you're saying there you have the companies themselves
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:29.480]  doing their own internal test and then dumbing up the records um yeah they have done that and
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:33.880]  the i've worked for companies in the past that have done that i mean i've sat in meetings and
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:39.960]  when they test drugs um let's say at the i'm just going to say the male clinic i'm not singling them
[1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:47.800]  out they have to write down every single um you know bad thing that happens to somebody and i've
[1:19:47.800 --> 1:19:53.640]  seen the doctors go through and just alter or remove those patients so their data looks better
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:59.000]  stay there let's come back and talk about that on the other side and and and break all of this down
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:05.400]  with this research scientist blowing the whistle question is the world getting better or vastly

[1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:13.400]  since the um research scientist is our guest we're going to go through some of the internal
[1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:20.840]  activities a big pharma like murk and the mill and the gates foundation where she's left
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:23.560]  the last year or so
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:31.160]  because she morally said that she couldn't go along with some of the things that's all happening there
[1:24:33.640 --> 1:24:39.320]  okay continuing let's let's let's go over that in detail uh let's go back i mean to the instances
[1:24:39.320 --> 1:24:44.520]  working at big pharma with big pharma and then some of the things you've seen with the uh testing
[1:24:45.400 --> 1:24:50.760]  of unapproved rugs in the third world uh and we're talking about separately from bill
[1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:56.040]  mill and the gates foundation another instance where they were having trials when people that
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:00.680]  have bad reactions they just take them out of the trial uh so that that data isn't in there
[1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:04.520]  and then falsely claim that it was safe and i know you said you saw that several times
[1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:10.840]  times wasn't that in particular in relation to the human papillomavirus vaccine well with
[1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:17.880]  that vaccine um what yes what they do is they in countries where there's really good reporting
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:23.240]  like the uk and it's very established you know they're finding out that there's as many as eight
[1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:28.600]  deaths and two weeks happened last year and things like that but when you test it in countries
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:34.760]  that you know in africa and in latin america that don't have the infrastructure and of
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:39.560]  you know having oversight and follow up to people because you know people live in
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:45.400]  little villages or in nomadic or whatever and you can't really follow up to find out if they've been
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:52.600]  hurt or not hurt and so um by whatever you're giving it giving them they just basically go in
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:59.960]  there and kind of conduct their own their own studies by using a lot of people as pretty much
[1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:04.840]  anything they just start vaccinating them they try to do as much follow-up as they can but you
[1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:09.080]  know you can write off deaths and things like that really easily in third world countries
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:15.160]  or side effects by saying oh well they had poor malnutrition you know ahead of time or they had
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:21.080]  malaria or you know whatever a multitude of horrible things happen to people you know who
[1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:28.440]  live in very poor conditions so they're so basically they're just kind of wholesale
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:35.160]  vaccinating people without really having the proper infrastructure at times to um
[1:26:36.040 --> 1:26:42.200]  now to be clear what they are vaccinating them with experimental uh even biotech vaccines you
[1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:49.480]  were telling me yeah they're their next level of i think after because the human papillomavirus is
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:55.000]  you know if they're you know the more they're doing it in you know first world countries like
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:27:00.440]  BUS and Great Britain they're because they're being very closely monitored they're finding out
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:07.800]  you know as many as 10 000 side effects were uh adverse events with this drug that were reported
[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:15.400]  up until july of this year and there were as many as 20 deaths and it causes spontaneous abortion
[1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:22.280]  seizures is a really bad problem with this vaccine and um they're also finding now that
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:27.960]  there's people women are being paralyzed a little 12 year old girl died of blood clots
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:35.000]  and the cdc now is uh recommending that or the fb is recommending that once you know
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:40.120]  um somebody has been given this vaccine that they stick around for 15 20 minutes because there's been
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:45.640]  anaphylactic shock and seizures and they just want to make sure that when people walk out after
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:50.760]  they have this shot they don't have something horrible happen to them so they make them after
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:55.640]  you have the shot you're here it's recommended that you sit around in your doctor's office for
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:28:00.360]  now in the past with a whole host of vaccines the child would go home and die of a seizure and
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:04.760]  then they go ahead and arrest the parents saying they beat them but now that's become so public
[1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:10.200]  they're not um not enough they kill your child or hurt them they've then got to take them uh
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:16.760]  now but i want to be specific here uh uh you were telling me about experimental vaccines
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:22.440]  being used in africa and that this is all being kept very secret right they're they're testing a
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:33.080]  lot of versions of um diarrheal vaccines and they basically you know have been testing that and
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:39.960]  and other kind of you know on people basically down there to see if it it works and what's kind
[1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:46.040]  of disconcerting is a lot of the people that they're testing it on are like women and and children
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:53.960]  and uh one trial they had to stop because um like i think like 11 people died that they could
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:59.880]  confirm it wasn't like they could sort of they oh nothing happened it was pretty blatant and obvious
[1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:08.200]  so they're testing a lot of their experimental um vaccines on people like in africa and and things
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:13.960]  like that so it's it's pretty you know without having gone through different safety studies
[1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:19.160]  and things like that i mean it's not embarrassing though if they do it in africa or latin america
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:25.080]  or asia it can be kept quiet and then they know uh what to not test in the west because it'll be
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:30.600]  you know more obvious of the deaths happen there right that's essentially it and you know there
[1:29:31.400 --> 1:29:37.240]  the rationale i think on their part of these people have a greater greater need of dying dying of
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:42.600]  different you know now that's the bioethicist rationalizing and setting that precedent
[1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:47.560]  uh and not even telling the people how much danger they're in stay there uh sent the uh
[1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:52.760]  research scientists let's come back in a long segment we'll get into it we're on the march

[1:31:56.760 --> 1:32:06.200]  the terrorists and the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here
[1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:10.040]  recently and she was talking about the great depression we were talking about the gas prices
[1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:14.680]  the food prices this economic uncertainty we're in these you know really kind of perilous times
[1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:18.120]  no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up and she was reminded of the great
[1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:22.360]  depression and how in those days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken
[1:32:22.360 --> 1:32:25.880]  and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people who
[1:32:25.880 --> 1:32:30.120]  lived in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the
[1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:33.960]  know-how they didn't have the chickens and the livestock so it's a lot different for them well
[1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:38.120]  we know one thing's certain right now we're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a
[1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:43.160]  global food shortage now what can you do to prepare do what i did sell some toys off in the garage

[1:33:14.200 --> 1:33:32.360]  still silver it was back when the country was wrong back before else before vietnam war came along
[1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:46.600]  before the beetles and yesterday when a man could still work still would
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:59.480]  it's the best of the free life behind us now and our good times really over
[1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:02.840]  they won't be if we get this corporate crime
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:12.520]  under control government has no transparency under national security big corporations have no
[1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:17.880]  transparency the people have the book thrown at them and are fed on all the rich and powerful to
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:23.080]  whatever they want and throughout history it always goes to see things always break down
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:28.040]  and fall apart and this elite knows that so they built a police state up to keep themselves in power
[1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:32.520]  while they steal and thief we're talking to sentia that's not a real name research scientist
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:38.040]  and i want to go back in a few minutes and then go over your list of things you want to discuss
[1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:44.040]  sentia but before we do that let's go back first and describe the secrecy in big pharma and that
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:49.720]  revolving door and how you were saying there was no oversight uh and then getting into the secrecy
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:55.000]  of the bill and melinda gates foundation and and the layers of secrecy we can't get into your high
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:59.960]  level position to to see a lot of it and there's even layers above you that are secret just so
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:05.800]  people get an idea of the window we're able to look through thanks to you uh into their world
[1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:13.640]  okay um you said so many things i'm not quite sure where do you want me to start here i would
[1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:19.480]  say that you know those trials that they do in third world countries they do write up proper
[1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:29.080]  protocols and get uh whatever proper local approval but um they can't do the the tricky part there is
[1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:34.760]  doing the follow-up it's like they can only find some of these people because they're in villages
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:39.240]  and stuff and you kind of wonder if the people they can't find are the ones that had the bad
[1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:44.600]  reactions and they're only reporting on the 60 percent that they could follow up on do you
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:49.240]  know what i mean what happened to those 40 percent now they're doing the test where they know that
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:55.320]  there's no accountability and there's a smoke screen and they're mixing the drugs in country
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:36:00.280]  when there's no reason to do that which allows things to be added which big companies and the
[1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:06.360]  world health organization have been caught doing before so please continue right and um
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:13.560]  so basically there is as far as accountability with big pharma i've you know i i sat in one
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:20.040]  meeting once and you know you do a printout and you know when people read the side effects of a drug
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:24.680]  and they're like what diarrhea and constipation and you know because they seem like conflicting
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:29.000]  you have to report every single side effect that anybody had while they were on your drug
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:35.080]  and um because you don't know ten years down the line if one of those is an actual
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:42.840]  real side effect um you can't say you can't dismiss somebody who had a you know headache or
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:48.200]  something like that because they they showed they're on your clinical trial and they drank
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:51.880]  too much at their sister's wedding or something they have to report everything
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:37:00.440]  per you know that comes in but you don't have to where i saw where a lot of the changes came in is
[1:37:00.440 --> 1:37:05.480]  either one company i quit after four months and so did the statistician they just took
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:10.600]  things they didn't like and said and there's no oversight by the FDA because they just don't
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:16.840]  really have the manpower to come in and micromanage of pharmaceutical companies it's like supposedly
[1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:23.640]  they're ethical and you can trust them they would just throw out whole adverse event symptoms and
[1:37:23.640 --> 1:37:28.920]  i sat in one meeting where this doctor just basically was going through the printout this data
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:34.440]  printout and marking stuff off and i asked her what are you doing and she said well i don't trust
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:42.760]  this and i'm like well you know you train the people at you know the university site where
[1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:47.720]  they're doing this things why wouldn't they know how to report you know a severe event versus a
[1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:53.080]  mild versus whatever and she said well i want this time to check it and so they pulled all this data
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:38:00.200]  out and then they went on with their remaining data i mean she can challenge it because that's
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:07.240]  her role as the medical monitor of the study but it alters ultimately it alters the outcome of that
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:13.000]  particular study well that was likely more than half exactly during the early 1980s trials of
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:18.280]  aspartame more than half the baby monkeys that were fed it died so they just removed Donald
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:23.560]  rumsfeld ordered the scientist and they refused so they just falsified it this is public domain
[1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:27.640]  they just removed the monkeys that died from the study and said none of the monkeys died
[1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:35.080]  died yeah and so yeah and you know under i mean doctors have to have discretion when they're
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:40.760]  doing these you know doing oversight on trial like well this is completely wrong or this or
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:45.960]  that i mean because they're using their medical judgment but when it's so blatant you know and
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:50.760]  the thing is people are like well why did you report it well first of all a i would have lost my
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:39:00.200]  job and be um you know who you know this person is the medical doctor in charge and like who
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:06.600]  might question her sort of authority on this and it would be really super hard to prove to the FDA
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:11.800]  what she was up to but here's an example gathered all that info and gave it to him which was would
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:19.880]  been impossible to do so yeah well this is uh down the road now look at how they approved in
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:26.280]  the early eighties what we now know is prozac and they knew then it caused massive increases in
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:33.800]  suicides but they removed that from the study and then now it's been a you know proven scientifically
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:41.560]  the whole family caused mood swings violent uh you know actions it it it it it destroys people's
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:50.280]  normal uh inhibition towards uh violent outbreaks it reviewed it removes that dopamine suppressor
[1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:54.200]  and this is what the scientists say uh that keeps people keep some other from chopping her
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:59.080]  one-year-old's arms off and dancing around with the dead body on the roof and i hate to get you
[1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:02.360]  know you take a totally normal woman she's put on this and she goes completely insane
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:07.800]  then they throw her in prison for it uh when uh you know every mass shooter we've had in the
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:15.880]  schools has been on these uh these drugs uh now well it's kind of like drugs like um i think
[1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:21.560]  vioxx is one of them that are at celebrex vioxx that they found out oops you know they're no better
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:26.760]  than taking ivy profan and then they have all these horrible side effects and they're like oops all
[1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:32.920]  this data was someplace locked in a file cabinet at at the company yeah turned out they knew it
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:39.400]  caused heart attacks they knew vioxx was gonna kill and and that was murk again wasn't it uh i
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:46.040]  i believe so yeah it's just murk murk murk it's kind of funny i hurt my back once and uh took
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:53.640]  vioxx and i swelled up my i mean i became incredible puffy person and i'm like this is crap
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:59.560]  and i never took it again and then years later it's like thank god you know now um but yeah it's
[1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:08.280]  it's very scary to uh know how lack oversight there is and how much kind of trust goes into this
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:14.600]  and you know every time i see these ads about i i love my you know grandmother so this is why i'm
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:19.880]  doing this i'm like oh what a bunch of baloney it's all about money you know and with a big pharma
[1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:25.400]  well the bottom line is you've been at at many levels of the studies that are being done and
[1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:30.440]  you're telling us what's also come out in the mainstream news that these a lot of these trials
[1:41:30.440 --> 1:41:37.880]  are as crooked as a dog's hind leg completely and you know the even by the own this was years ago
[1:41:37.880 --> 1:41:45.000]  the own uh fda's own statistics that 53 of all drugs that went into clinical trials to be tested
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:54.280]  were found to be toxic so um that should you know give you some pause right there i would never go
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:42:01.000]  on a clinical trial unless even if i was you know dying basically because um not that we don't have
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:06.600]  to test new medicines and things like that but you know people get very false hopes and you're
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:11.080]  you're an uber guinea pig at that point well austin texas is a big center of testing and i have a
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:17.320]  friend who does this because she'll get four five thousand dollars and and i talked to her and i said
[1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:21.640]  don't you understand the the higher paying ones are the more dangerous ones and she had one almost
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:26.920]  killer she had to go to the hospital she swole up red spots all over and they were testing a
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:31.960]  cancer drug on her and she didn't even have cancer and uh you know she's finally stopped doing it
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:37.080]  but but you know that's pretty sick when our only thing we've got left in our economy for people to
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:43.000]  make money you have college degrees is going in and taking deadly drugs right and you know they're
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:49.080]  pushing uh now they're doing a big push towards you know minorities and science and stuff like
[1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:54.680]  that to go into biotech and i'm like jeez why would you want to do that to anybody you know it's
[1:42:54.680 --> 1:42:59.800]  it's a really shady business and that their whole goal is to get bought out by a bigger company
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:04.760]  and they work you to death and you know you'd be better off in academia so they're really
[1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:13.240]  targeting right now the uh legal aliens yeah and um so anyway what i thought we would sort
[1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:18.840]  of talk about next is um well in the hpv vaccine yeah i mean let's go over that let's go over the
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:29.880]  most egregious stuff you've witnessed okay with the hpv vaccine i it's basically going into third
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:37.080]  world countries you know in latin america and other different places and just basically shooting up
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:43.640]  these poor little pre-adolescent school girls with you know and they line this up through the school
[1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:51.160]  and but they won't give it to the the hpv vaccine to the boy uh reproductive problems
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:59.480]  right and they're and there's no long-term studies on this and um and basically with uh
[1:43:59.480 --> 1:44:05.720]  they're finding out now there's more and more paralysis bells palsy there's grand mal seizures
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:10.920]  are very very common and like in little uh 12 year old girls as i said before they've died of
[1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:19.080]  blood clot from it so they're really targeting school aid they're going into schools and they're
[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:24.520]  really targeting these these little girls that are going to school and their parents are kind
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:28.600]  of confused because in third world countries they're not kind of up to date on a lot of things
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:32.920]  and they and they're they get very confused and think that they're being cured of cancer or they
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:40.200]  won't get cancer ever if they get this shot well well i've seen polls i've seen polls in the u.s uh
[1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:46.520]  sentia where and the way the ads were on it sounds like you're being cured of cancer and and they
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:52.120]  think all cancers even here in the u.s women are bringing their daughters in so so they're they're
[1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:55.640]  clearly playing that now now to be clear from the documents i was reading but you're the expert on this
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:45:01.240]  and i pulled some articles up on as well they were testing hpv before it was even approved here
[1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:07.880]  in the third world right and um you know and they can do that because third world countries
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:13.720]  have very lax oversight very lax institutional review boards you can pretty much just buy
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:19.080]  you know a study so you know it's not like they're just going in and randomly pulling people off the
[1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:26.280]  street and you know shooting them up with this vaccine they get approval such as it is which is
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:33.560]  usually not as strict or you know as the u.s or the u.k or germany or something like that so
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:39.400]  in these countries they're pretty much they can be pretty much bulldozed around by you know any
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:45.320]  big pharmaceutical companies that comes in and maybe throw some cash their way so and that was
[1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:53.640]  founded so they can claim it's all kosher and legal but only because in some place like peru
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:46:01.560]  uh or or different states of india or in areas of central africa or on the gold coast
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:06.200]  plus is like nigeria they can go in now i've also seen reports come out and and i talked
[1:46:06.200 --> 1:46:10.680]  about the session you said yes that goes on there's no reason to not fully produce the
[1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:17.080]  vaccines on the drugs and the gmo drugs is really what they are uh the genetic altering sequences
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:24.600]  in the west where the main plants are and then ship it there they are they're creating sub labs
[1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:31.960]  or factories uh where they are uh preparing the final vaccine which also allows more control
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:36.600]  and more anonymity and again the world health health organization has been caught adding a very
[1:46:36.600 --> 1:46:42.120]  expensive synthetic hormone and over a hundred factories uh to the tetanus shot and of course
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:46.280]  you're a scientist you understand how that works and then it would sterilize the women but please
[1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:54.360]  continue yeah so basically the big farmers come into china and india and i do have to say that
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:47:00.280]  a lot of indian pharmaceutical companies are based on the old british educational system so in a
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:05.400]  lot of ways they're you know they're actually pretty good pharmaceutical companies when it comes to
[1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:10.280]  drugs china is very scary because all the big farmers i work for and friends of mine that
[1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:15.160]  still work for them are now going to china to manufacture their drugs so a lot of our drugs
[1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:20.360]  are being made in china where they put plastic in the milk well almost all our drugs are being
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:26.360]  made in china they're shutting down manufacturing plants in the u.s um to make things and it's
[1:47:26.360 --> 1:47:32.440]  going to china so the big pharmaceuticals go to china they get their little thing factories
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:38.680]  up and going their little manufacturing plants and then from there they will then help other
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:44.920]  developing countries let's say indonesian part of indonesia set up their own manufacturing so it's
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:50.920]  not like you know murk goes into indonesia murk goes into china that goes into indonesia
[1:47:52.200 --> 1:48:00.280]  so it's always kind of now being done through a conduit it's fenced it's being fenced yeah and
[1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:06.760]  you know on some level if it was totally kosher it's like oh good these countries are now sustainable
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:11.960]  to make their own drugs and their own medicines and we're helping them get up to world health
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:20.760]  organization standards but you know china is very scary and um you know you just don't know what's
[1:48:20.760 --> 1:48:26.360]  being put in these drugs well china is also signed on to the eugenics model in the treaties they
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:30.920]  signed in the 80s to uh to get the imf and world bank funding we know the imf and world bank also
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:35.640]  funded peru and india to sterilize their women uh and to give them injections that did that so
[1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:41.640]  they've all been caught doing this is the point imagine what we don't know yeah i mean and it's
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:48.200]  very hard to get in those countries because they're very militarily controlled and um you know and
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:53.560]  they have a lot of consultants from the big pharma that are being paid and you know subsidized to
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:59.400]  come in and and basically you know help these people set up their own vaccine manufacturing
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:04.680]  plants and drug manufacturing plants which on the face looks good like oh good they're getting
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:09.560]  you know expert help but you're kind of wondering you know what's going on here so um
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:15.320]  that that's very scary because you don't know where these vaccines are coming from and how they're
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:21.400]  being made and there's really sketchy oversight especially i mean they can certify them because
[1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:26.360]  they'll look at their protocols on how they make things and sterilize things but that doesn't mean
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:33.240]  that that's what they're following well it's like millions of chinese citizens getting uh melamine
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:38.440]  which destroys your kidneys just once or twice getting any of it and they just don't care they
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:44.680]  said well we knew that melamine shows on the meters is high protein so we put melamine in
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:49.560]  millions of people's milk and you know they're gonna die young because of it or die right now but
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:55.640]  that's just what we do and by the way we make your drugs so eat up america well and then the next
[1:49:55.640 --> 1:50:02.040]  phase is these they're doing a lot of testing is multiple vaccines at once and they're it's under
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:08.440]  the guise of like um you know basically oh well it would be one stop shopping why do these people
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:12.920]  have to do redundant services so we'll give them this this and this well it's really getting kind
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:16.840]  of scary because they're putting the measles vaccine with the h you know with all these other
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:22.520]  different vaccines and giving these poor people like guinea pigging them with like three vaccines
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:27.080]  at the same time that are completely different and experimental let's come back and get into the

[1:54:20.600 --> 1:54:24.200]  a crowd of people stood instead
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:30.680]  they'd seen his face before nobody was waiting for him
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:33.800]  sent the inside whistleblower from big pharma testing
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:38.760]  we've really been covering that the last 45 minutes or so she just stayed with us 30 minutes
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:43.880]  to the next hour then open phones and tons of financial news and analysis for the balance of
[1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:48.280]  the broadcast and there's a lot we're not telling you a lot we're not saying because she had
[1:54:48.280 --> 1:54:54.040]  confidentiality agreements i've seen a lot more than i can say here on air now if something's
[1:54:54.040 --> 1:55:01.080]  illegal or unethical she's not bound by that but still she left because she didn't want to be part
[1:55:01.080 --> 1:55:05.400]  of the things she witnessed going on there and we talked about a lot off air that hasn't been
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:10.600]  discussed here uh... sent to you i want to get back into the things they're doing in the larger
[1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:16.520]  operation and just how big it is and how secretive but but let's get into the bill in the gates
[1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:20.520]  foundation you know his father's the former head of plant parenthood currently on the board
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:25.960]  he has said he believes in the eugenical ideas bill gates as warren buffett's big into it he's
[1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:30.760]  given 40 something billion they've given 39 billion uh... this year we're talking about 80 plus billion
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:37.720]  dollar war chest that is so secretive i think uh... he gave 47 million they've been 39 billion last
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:42.920]  time i checked the cover in the endgame and just ravages happen after the u n the world
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:47.320]  held organization world bank are in there doing things that the most the africans now run
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:53.400]  when they see the clinic trucks uh... in thailand now people are given injections but by u n programs
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:58.040]  and the women have miscarriages uh... they hold them down i mean the the police are locally paid
[1:55:58.040 --> 1:56:03.160]  to do it so so there's this huge program going on she's covering what she can tell you on what she
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:07.720]  knows about and you know they started up the foundation with p r stuff about let's stop the
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:13.480]  tootsie fly the sleeping death let's give a mosquito nets all sounds great to get the trust
[1:56:13.480 --> 1:56:17.640]  but she talked about a bigger director above her which i don't get into much detail but she said
[1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:21.960]  i don't feel like i'm a doctor anymore and don't like what i'm doing but wouldn't go further i mean
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:26.680]  there's some really weird stuff going on she got into the foundation thinking this will be more
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:32.120]  moral than big pharma and kind of found out it was really big pharma was just a foundation
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:37.800]  front and really a giant testing arm for human guinea pigs that's the main moral but let's get
[1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:42.120]  into the the and we're about to break a minute short segment but start getting into the structure
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:49.800]  and the secrecy well but the secrecy first struck me when um i was approached by a friend
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:55.640]  because they needed help with this administrative thing because they're expanding very rapidly
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:57:00.360]  they said oh okay well i'll meet you there and we'll go to lunch and you wouldn't even tell me
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:06.520]  where the foundation was located in seattle i said i started laughing i said oh yeah i you
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:10.520]  know because most places have like a security guard at a desk and you get a little badge to go
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:16.440]  through or you know what i mean and um she's like no i can't tell you where i'm located at all
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:23.320]  and she was absolutely seriously never told me where her office was i mean i eventually figured
[1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:29.640]  found out where it was but um that that's the kind of level of secrecy and you know
[1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:35.240]  i'm not quite sure why i mean obviously you know people could come off the street and
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:40.200]  protest or come in and constantly look for grants from them or something like that you know they'd
[1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:45.800]  be inundated with people coming through the front door but it's just it's that's almost bizarre
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:50.600]  secrets you know for me even just being in pharmaceutical companies you can they have a
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:55.240]  guard at a desk and you know can buzz you in and things but they won't even tell you where
[1:57:55.240 --> 1:58:02.280]  they're located and a friend of mine is in a biotech company in downtown seattle and uh
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:06.120]  they're building a big compound and normally how they have stay there stay there gotta break
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:12.760]  for one minute since you'll be right back to everybody in well 70 seconds thank you for listening

[1:58:41.400 --> 1:58:46.200]  intelligence networks inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there are

[1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:58.840]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:10.760]  talking to big pharma whistleblower also whistleblower on things she witnessed in the bill
[2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:16.040]  of melinda gates eighty plus billion dollar secretive foundation that's funding and financing
[2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:21.400]  basically human guinea pig trials all over the world from how she described it basically a
[2:00:22.200 --> 2:00:26.840]  a foundation front and it's also tax free for them they're they're basically spending like
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:32.680]  ten turner does actually made money by going tax free with his money now about nine years ago to
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:39.240]  the un their money is now tax free and they use the principal on it to finance and fund what they're
[2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:46.600]  doing so basically you have microsoft fortune moving into biotech but but she was describing
[2:00:46.600 --> 2:00:52.840]  the secrecy the makeup of it secret facilities secret meetings and that never bodes well that's
[2:00:52.840 --> 2:00:58.840]  always a red flag please continue yeah i mean there's nothing to identify who they are and a
[2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:05.080]  friend of mine who's a works in a biotech company in downtown seattle and you know you know what
[2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:09.800]  company it is because it's got you know huge letters all over it um they're built there's
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:15.000]  some sort of compound going in down there but you know normally how if a building is going up it's
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:21.800]  like soon to be you know best buys or something you know there there's nothing on this saying what
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:26.920]  it is or what it's about or anything so it's almost like a red flag well it's probably one of the
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:33.640]  gates you know foundation compounds or whatever so they have buildings sort of everywhere but
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:40.120]  they're so nondescript you wouldn't know who or what they were you know you could think they were
[2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:45.400]  an insurance firm or something there's just absolutely no identifying markers anywhere
[2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:49.000]  or you know if you go to the microsoft campus there's huge microsoft letter you know it's
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:56.760]  microsoft and stuff but this it's like almost like you know a cia building or something like
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:00.440]  that where they're not going to say what it is they just don't say what it is i mean it's
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:06.600]  it's totally nondescript and uber secure so and people who work in these buildings won't even tell
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:14.360]  you where they work in different departments they won't say where they're located so that to me was
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:20.680]  just totally odd you know but the one thing i wanted to say about the uh gates foundation too is
[2:02:21.240 --> 2:02:26.280]  you know like with the hpv vaccine and you know being a woman i i don't want cervical cancer and
[2:02:26.280 --> 2:02:33.240]  i don't want other women to get it but they are really uber pimping for um you know murk and
[2:02:33.240 --> 2:02:40.840]  glauco smith client for their vaccines i mean it's pretty much a non-profit front to get these
[2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:46.600]  vaccines in terms of money i mean that's a lot of that's multi multi millions of dollars for
[2:02:47.240 --> 2:02:52.840]  these big pharma that they can get these programs and too it's not just besides you know whatever
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:58.200]  eugenics policy they may have this is a really good money making thing and and they can get
[2:02:58.200 --> 2:03:04.920]  like all sorts of world bank funds and other different organizations to help prepare the
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:09.640]  guys foundation isn't just giving money out they're going out and and getting i'm at the world bank
[2:03:09.640 --> 2:03:15.640]  money yeah i mean through these different organizations yeah they they bring in um
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:21.400]  well we can kind of talk about you want to get into the front group name they use um
[2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:29.400]  um well one of the yeah well they use yeah one of the groups they use is path and um you know and
[2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:35.800]  they also use different um you know like john hopkins and things like that but one of their
[2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:43.480]  main groups is is called path so um which is a very altruistic nice organization but at the
[2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:49.880]  same time you know they're just they're just another front way of kind of getting in into
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:56.120]  where they want but if they're so altruistic why does it have to be so secret i know and
[2:03:56.120 --> 2:04:00.680]  you know when you look at all the problems that happen to these people in third world countries
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:06.120]  with diseases and you know and people have never been sexually active they've done the medical
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:15.720]  studies bbc have hiv and they've never never been sexually active yeah and um it's pretty amazing
[2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:21.480]  that they focus in on cervical cancer with all these vaccines because you know cervical cancer is
[2:04:21.480 --> 2:04:25.960]  bad but it's very treatable and you would think a prevention program would be more cost effective
[2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:33.800]  stay there let's keep breaking it down on the other side attention this is an extremely urgent

[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:53.400]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones we've got about
[2:07:53.400 --> 2:07:57.960]  20 minutes left with our guest Cynthia whistleblower inside the bill on the linda gates foundation
[2:07:57.960 --> 2:08:04.520]  at a very high level i told her coming on they probably figure out who she is i guess ready for
[2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:09.320]  that they're trying to protect her anonymity she left there recently because she just couldn't be
[2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:14.840]  part of it anymore there's a lot we can't get into on air but uh you know you've heard most
[2:08:14.840 --> 2:08:20.840]  the basics of it and i i just wanted proof that she worked there she sent me more than that
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:24.760]  and again pretty much everything i saw i went and checked out and and is available different
[2:08:24.760 --> 2:08:30.680]  government reports uh so it's not like super secret stuff it's that it's all compartmentalized
[2:08:30.680 --> 2:08:35.320]  and broken up and she was at a key level to be able to give you a big picture continue along
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:39.480]  the line you were on and then other areas we haven't covered let's cram it all in and then give us
[2:08:39.480 --> 2:08:46.280]  your your you know your big overview about what's happening okay um i kind of look at this interview
[2:08:46.280 --> 2:08:51.480]  is kind of like giving everybody kind of a one-on-one on pharma and the and the foundations and
[2:08:51.480 --> 2:08:58.040]  things like that and what's going on with uh vaccination but um i think what i'd like to
[2:08:58.040 --> 2:09:07.160]  kind of cover is how these vaccinations basically they hit the gate foundation is everywhere i mean
[2:09:07.160 --> 2:09:12.760]  everywhere the caribbean you name it they've got the earth carved up you described it as military
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:18.360]  go tell us yeah it's like regions you know they go this region that region this region and then
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:26.120]  they you know and there's a pattern to this they have a conference which is pretty much a legitimate
[2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:31.240]  you know conference say on cervical cancer and but you know if you look at all the underwriters
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:35.480]  and if you go to like the rocker foundation rockerfeller foundation it's all those organizations
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:41.400]  that you've mentioned before then underwrite it and big pharma underwrites it and then they fly in
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:47.480]  these little you know health ministers and different people key people in government in
[2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:54.680]  these third world countries and wine and dynamin have them come to the conference and uh you know
[2:09:54.680 --> 2:10:00.440]  tell them how they should set up programs in their in their country for this vaccination and
[2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:06.520]  different things like that so it's basically kind of on one level good that they're being informed
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:11.960]  about cervical cancer and women but then another level that's how their first level of staging
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:18.760]  and then they go in and then they um you know basically offer all these other little services
[2:10:18.760 --> 2:10:24.760]  will build you a clinic will buy you you know little scooters to go around
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:34.120]  so people can go to villages and then they describe to you how much money was spent on
[2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:42.440]  one meetings alcohol like like $12,000 for like a two-day event i was like jeez i'd like to be the
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:46.600]  bartender there you know well the same thing international groups do would say county commissioners
[2:10:46.600 --> 2:10:51.720]  they all fly them up for you know $200 steak dinners three times a day and big shows and
[2:10:51.720 --> 2:10:56.520]  parties and five-star hotels and everything's paid for and then by the way we're gonna give
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:11:01.560]  you campaign donations if you'll pass this to standardized zoning laws i mean it's just all
[2:11:01.560 --> 2:11:07.560]  about control um and and and remember they don't follow the same laws that's the point they go to
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:11.400]  these african and other countries and they say oh we're gonna give you scooters give you money
[2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:16.360]  give you these things just let us come here and test drugs that they couldn't test here in the
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:24.280]  us or england right and um i have another friend who kind of sets up these conferences and and
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:29.720]  things like that and and a lot of times they'll pay for their whole family to come and and different
[2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:33.880]  things like that and then you get you know you can't help it you know oh they showed us a nice
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:38.920]  time they let my wife come you know blah blah blah and then you start to feel a little beholden
[2:11:38.920 --> 2:11:43.960]  because they you know in third world countries if you show this kind of hospitality you have to
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:49.720]  show hospitality back so i've already had before the air force and people say let us fly you here
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:54.360]  five-star let us do this and that for you come see this facility and they do that to all the
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:58.680]  media people you know it's not like they're even targeting alex jones or come to israel
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:03.240]  uh you know see what it's really like in the west bank uh and it's all part of influence
[2:12:03.240 --> 2:12:09.000]  peddling is what it's called right and then they get all these clinics built or little they they
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:15.400]  work on a very base infrastructure and you know kind of work up but then they bring in kind of
[2:12:15.400 --> 2:12:21.080]  their key people from the region to be the overseers and then they start their programs
[2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:28.200]  and then they start adding what seems like a you know maybe a legit program like um you know handing
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:34.520]  out you know mosquito nets or something then pretty soon you're vaccinating people so that's
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:39.720]  kind of how they you know work their way in there and specifically briefly get into some of these
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:45.880]  vaccines i mean we're talking about a vaccine to go after a type of intestinal worm that like you
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:52.440]  were saying uh tax it's very dna protein and it's untested and god knows what that's going to do to
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:59.720]  other um proteins of the human body that's that's correct and which is really odd because a lot of
[2:12:59.720 --> 2:13:05.320]  these parasites you know uh it's coming from a ranching background you can just go to like rancher
[2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:10.600]  supply and buy a jug of ivermectin you know to worm your hogs or whatever i mean that's
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:15.400]  essentially what they're using is the human grade version of that and that's what the health workers
[2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:21.240]  previously did you just warm up last year yeah it came in twice maybe sometimes quarterly and
[2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:27.480]  you know that that's a pretty good effective uh intestinal warmer but now they're saying oh well
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:32.040]  why do they have to do that why don't we just give them one vaccine that will keep them from
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:37.480]  getting these parasites and you're like well parasites evolved their protein coats change
[2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:44.680]  and things like that so vaccinating somebody against something like that is kind of plus the
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:49.640]  worm is so similar i mean i'm not even a biologist but i've read the reports with the one they've
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:56.440]  done testing animals and it and it is routinely causes all sorts of you start messing with protein
[2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:02.440]  uh in the body with a with a quote vaccine to where the body what has an autoimmune response
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:08.280]  to it or how is that working yeah i mean it's like how do you know that that protein sequence isn't
[2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:14.920]  like you know something your intestine needs or you know makes and and it is just well take
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:19.560]  Crohn's take Crohn's uh every major case of Crohn's there's hundreds of studies on this
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:27.480]  they find that the measles antibodies from the vaccination impregnated into the guts into the
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:33.240]  lining and that's what's causing the autoimmune problem well and you don't know that if this
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:39.000]  protein isn't something like if you became pregnant or something it would elicit a response and cause
[2:14:39.640 --> 2:14:45.800]  you know spontaneous abortion or fetal abnormalities to create you know so you would end up making
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:51.640]  antibodies against you know if you were pregnant or you know whatever against the fetus so it's
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:58.280]  it's really kind of a very suspect area i mean how do you know that it won't attack some sort of
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:03.160]  protein in your brain you start making an autoimmune response to well like you said in china now
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:07.160]  where most our vaccines are being made for the us alone they're they're making a whole bunch
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:11.640]  of different types at it at the same facility and then there's all sorts of problems there
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:17.080]  and they've gotten problems with regulators here so they just move to china uh and and and then
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:22.120]  you talked about all the adverse health effects in these countries and it's just covered up right
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:28.760]  and um yeah and this is kind of like tying into you know poison chinese thing i was asking a friend
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:33.800]  of mine who's an epidemiologist and a public health person who has worked at the cdc i said
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:38.200]  you know when i was looking at they give the kids here in the us like 17 vaccines i said
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:43.480]  why would anybody need a hepatitis vaccine unless you were going to live in a third world
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:48.920]  country where there's no plumbing or you've been exposed to hepatitis directly like eating at a
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:55.880]  salad bar or something and her thought on it was coming from the fda you know the cdc the
[2:15:55.880 --> 2:16:01.720]  government there is that we're getting so many contaminated products from overseas that they're
[2:16:01.720 --> 2:16:07.640]  preemptively vaccinating people because they don't want some like that's right horrible hepatitis
[2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:12.840]  outbreak among people that's right don't tell mexico to stop spraying human feces on the crops
[2:16:12.840 --> 2:16:18.600]  just give everybody a very dangerous vaccine right and you know and they're giving just
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:24.760]  a little bit you know it's an immunologist giving a little baby that many vaccinations when your
[2:16:24.760 --> 2:16:30.280]  immune system isn't developed i mean i i you don't know how many people i've told you
[2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:35.160]  have or having kids and just are like don't do this and they kind of look at me like i'm insane
[2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:40.600]  they're like well if it was dangerous blue blue blue and i'm like it is dangerous don't be vaccinated
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:44.760]  admitted the hp is very dangerous in babies but then that's the really dangerous one they
[2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:51.000]  recommend for the newborns um i'll tell you i mean i mean take bear for over a decade shipping
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:56.760]  out over a million more than a million uh... ampoules of factor eight knowing they knew it
[2:16:56.760 --> 2:17:02.200]  had hiv and hepatitis in every shot but they still did it i mean the mindset of these people
[2:17:02.200 --> 2:17:08.440]  right and um you know even thing from the red cross not wanting to test for
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:15.960]  hiv you know and infecting people that way so um yeah it a lot of it comes down to
[2:17:16.600 --> 2:17:22.600]  you know money unfortunately and uh... at least that's what they want us to believe
[2:17:22.600 --> 2:17:27.000]  oh we you know we put out blood banks and then on purpose don't test the blood knowing we're
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:32.680]  going to kill millions or oh well we don't test uh... for you know i mean i mean that is just
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:39.640]  incredible yeah and and it's very scary how i had a friend who worked at chiron and i never
[2:17:39.640 --> 2:17:45.160]  could get them to admit to me what was so wrong with their flu vaccine that it was so horrible i
[2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:51.240]  mean it had to be pretty horrible for them to pull it from the shelves um you know when everybody
[2:17:51.240 --> 2:17:55.800]  was panicking and you know that i saw these little lemmings going oh i need my flu vaccine
[2:17:55.800 --> 2:18:01.160]  you don't never get a flu vaccine ever i would never get one and i'm an immunologist i would
[2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:08.600]  never get a flu vaccine it's just so full of filthy particles from things called cytokines
[2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:13.400]  and viral kinds and basically to put it in layman's terms do you know what cells and viruses
[2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:19.080]  no it's also what cells and viruses poop out or excrete out you know like botulism boat
[2:18:19.080 --> 2:18:25.000]  you know the botox is actually bacteria poop you know that they're putting in people's head
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:28.680]  well now you've given out a little bit more about what you do as a scientist we might want
[2:18:28.680 --> 2:18:33.400]  to be careful but specifically maybe i should keep you longer to get into what's in the vaccines
[2:18:33.400 --> 2:18:39.240]  but but describe those again the excretia excreta of the viruses and bacteria yeah they're called
[2:18:39.240 --> 2:18:44.600]  cytokines or viral kinds and basically they're the products that you know the cells are just
[2:18:44.600 --> 2:18:50.440]  like a human body they eat and then they reproduce and then they also you know excrete
[2:18:50.440 --> 2:18:55.880]  whatever they poop out and so there's all these weird little protein fragments and things that they
[2:18:56.520 --> 2:19:03.640]  excrete out a good example would be a friend of mine had some soup sitting around she goes well
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:07.640]  i've heated it up and killed all the bacteria and i said well you've killed the bacteria
[2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:12.680]  but that's not the toxic point so toxic thing is what the bacteria have excreted into your soup
[2:19:12.680 --> 2:19:17.880]  that'll stay there stay there that's what gets you with most food poisoning is it isn't the
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:26.120]  bacteria it's their toxins i mean folks that's what plaque is on your teeth it's bacteria crap
[2:19:26.120 --> 2:19:30.600]  uh stay there stay there was just amazing interview ladies and gentlemen
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:39.880]  a day unlike any other in the long course of american history a terrorist act of war against
[2:19:39.880 --> 2:19:46.440]  this country the enemy stark america on september 11th but who is the enemy bin laden this is his
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:50.920]  m.o. we have to look to the middle east we have to look to the south of ben laden fabled enemies
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:55.560]  is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[2:19:55.560 --> 2:20:00.840]  inside the united states some u.s. investigators believe that there are israelis again very much
[2:20:00.840 --> 2:20:07.960]  engaged in spying in and on the u.s. i'm aware that some israeli citizens have been detained
[2:20:07.960 --> 2:20:13.160]  and laden's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the saudi arabian connection
[2:20:13.160 --> 2:20:18.120]  the israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much much more
[2:20:18.120 --> 2:20:24.360]  fabled enemies get the dvd at info wars dot com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds

[2:23:52.280 --> 2:23:56.040]  all right we have research scientists on whether it's an expert on vaccines we'll just leave it
[2:23:56.040 --> 2:24:05.400]  at that top top tier in the billa malinda gates foundation previously and uh she's told me privately
[2:24:05.400 --> 2:24:09.160]  and it basically on air that morally she can't really work for big pharma now she's
[2:24:09.160 --> 2:24:14.520]  can't really work for billa malinda gates i guess she's going to go into academia back into that
[2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:18.120]  or into government but there's not that many jobs there because there isn't much oversight
[2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:24.440]  and it's a revolving door there don't forget uh that over a hundred million americans
[2:24:24.440 --> 2:24:34.520]  over a hundred million we're given the sp40 cancer virus in their polio vaccine that is
[2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:38.520]  still going on by the way in the third world the that is shipped to the third world to be given
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:45.000]  and it definitely has caused massive increases in cancer so so so you know we're here calmly
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:53.480]  talking about all this uh but uh the the big picture is none of this is by accident uh do you
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:57.800]  agree i mean being on the inside of this and i even know at your level it's compartmentalized
[2:24:57.800 --> 2:25:01.240]  that there is a method to the madness or are you saying it's just from what you've seen
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:09.640]  absolute profit taking i would say both there is a method to the madness and in big pharma it's
[2:25:10.360 --> 2:25:16.920]  you know all about making a profit and cutting corners and getting from point a to point b to
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:22.440]  get your drug approved so you look really good at the stockholders and if you're a small company
[2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:28.120]  to get the big investors to come in and buy you out or you know promote your clinical trials in
[2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:34.680]  your company and things like that so um but there is a method i mean there is you know it's a very
[2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:42.520]  incestuous um business i mean everybody i mean even with myself i've probably worked for more
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:47.640]  than a half a dozen different companies and in that time kept running into the same people
[2:25:47.640 --> 2:25:52.840]  sort of being recycled around because it is very you know sort of specialized and you were telling
[2:25:52.840 --> 2:25:57.000]  me on fair it's okay to talk about this that that the ruthless people that would cover up
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.680]  bad vaccine reactions and things they just go right to the top yeah the one doctor that the
[2:26:02.680 --> 2:26:09.320]  meeting i sat in where she was just like zip zip zip and uh making this drug look better uh it
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:15.240]  wasn't a blinded study it was because uh we found out later the company was up for sale to a bigger
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:22.280]  pharmaceutical company and they wanted to just sort of move this along so that um when they
[2:26:22.280 --> 2:26:26.760]  you know sold out to the bigger pharmaceutical company they would get more money and look more
[2:26:26.760 --> 2:26:30.840]  you know enticing to them and we'll be too revealing to say what drug that was or
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:38.200]  um it's a drug that they know no longer uh it was it was a form of drug that um don't say it if
[2:26:38.200 --> 2:26:43.560]  it's going to reveal you it's going to reveal me so but it did turn out it did turn out to be bad
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:49.080]  they couldn't cover it up well it turned out to be um you know when i saw what she was sort of
[2:26:49.080 --> 2:26:54.840]  changing it wasn't anything horrible you know what i mean it wasn't like she's moving like
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:59.880]  severe diarrhea down to moderate or mild you know just things like that so they were still
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:05.400]  reporting it but they were under reporting the severity of what was going on and um
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:11.000]  so basically when they finally did the final blinded study and different things like that
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:15.400]  they found out it really wasn't very effective it really didn't do anything but by that time
[2:27:15.400 --> 2:27:21.240]  their company had sold to the bigger company and she had been promoted for her action to director
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:27.720]  so of the clinical research let me give you a few more into the next uh segment we're gonna
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:32.440]  let you go but i want to have you back up for a part two why did you decide to go public i mean
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:40.040]  what finally brought you to the point of contacting info wars well um i listened to you basically
[2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:46.200]  almost every night when i work on stuff i have you on my little itunes podcast and you know i had
[2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:51.800]  been telling people this you know that i felt almost like not so much like dr mangler because
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:58.520]  i'm not really shooting people up but i felt kind of like the person who you know keeps the books and
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:04.920]  keeps the trains running on time and um you know the things that you that i've told you that we
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:09.960]  can't really go into maybe for a part two i can sort of ferret this out maybe a little bit
[2:28:09.960 --> 2:28:17.880]  without getting in too much trouble but that there was just a lot of kind of abuse of how
[2:28:17.880 --> 2:28:24.280]  they ran the clinical trials how how people were being harmed and kind of like oh well we'll stop
[2:28:24.280 --> 2:28:31.560]  this and go here it there was a lot of um you know kind of giddy pig testing of people and
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:37.480]  ethically i just find that you know reprehensible there's got to be straight protocols i mean
[2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:44.440]  there's needs for new drugs and vaccines but not in the way you know people are doing it kind of
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:48.200]  happy well that's how the rationalization works you know because my dad was in md anderson for a
[2:28:48.200 --> 2:28:53.160]  while uh doing some research stuff in in college and you know the argument as well i mean we kill
[2:28:53.160 --> 2:28:57.560]  some people it's okay because we're going to find a cure for cancer and so their deaths are all
[2:28:57.560 --> 2:29:03.320]  right but then once you morally make the decision to be immoral and my dad was low level he never
[2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:08.280]  was he was you know just there in college a little bit uh he just witnessed it once you make that
[2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:13.000]  decision if we can do anything we want this is for a greater good well then it's a slippery slope
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:17.240]  as they say down into hades we'll come back with final comments from our whistleblower inside the
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:26.760]  middle of the gates foundation and big pharma and your phone calls we're on the march the empires on

[2:33:05.160 --> 2:33:13.880]  we all need medical care science could literally unleash humanity for most of our ailments and
[2:33:13.880 --> 2:33:19.240]  diseases and make life so much better and there's wonderful men and women that make up the world's
[2:33:19.240 --> 2:33:23.640]  medical community but we also know about the joseph mingle is in the like and we know about eugenics
[2:33:23.640 --> 2:33:29.480]  in the in europe in the united states and unfortunately it has been taken over by big
[2:33:29.480 --> 2:33:35.480]  global corporations most of it was founded by them and by eugenicists and so that's why you see
[2:33:36.200 --> 2:33:41.080]  the carnage that you witness a mixture of greed filled executives that could care less
[2:33:41.800 --> 2:33:48.600]  and then the uh... geneticists that are above it you also mentioned that the bill
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:54.520]  melinda gates foundation and big pharma itself is running worldwide dna databases
[2:33:55.160 --> 2:33:59.800]  and saying oh yeah while we give you quote some free vaccines that may be experimental in africa
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:04.200]  we're also going to take your dna do you can you flesh that out for us and talk a little bit
[2:34:04.200 --> 2:34:09.720]  more about the structure the secretive structure of the bill melinda gates foundation uh... yeah
[2:34:09.720 --> 2:34:15.880]  and first alex asked me why i'm on your show first of all uh... you could have a white audience
[2:34:15.880 --> 2:34:20.520]  you're very receptive your audience is in the know and i don't have to go over the basics of
[2:34:20.520 --> 2:34:25.320]  the basics of the basics you know what i mean so anyway well i'm flattered thank you for coming
[2:34:25.320 --> 2:34:32.360]  on our broadcast so um... uh... uh... i'll speak to that but you know how you're talking about
[2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:38.040]  you know your father at md anderson and things like that i've talked to my colleagues
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:43.880]  and every colleague to a person said and i almost couldn't believe this
[2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:47.480]  said oh well these people are going to die at something anyway
[2:34:47.480 --> 2:34:51.000]  i mean that was uh... i'm i was actually a little shocked about that
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:54.520]  so i really wanted it was their children see there's not that empathy
[2:34:55.480 --> 2:35:00.520]  no and they're kind of like oh they're in bad stress you know dire straits anyway so
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:05.320]  you know they but they're probably going to die anyway so why not try to help them
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:09.640]  you know and to me that that doesn't justify
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:14.520]  you know sloppy protocols and well then next hey we got millions of ampules of
[2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:18.920]  something that has hiv in every shot everyone that's given this because of the massive viral
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:24.760]  load will contract it it'll get past uh... the blood brain you know barriers uh... and just
[2:35:24.760 --> 2:35:29.640]  you know so what just let them all die you know they're hemophilia actually deserve to die right
[2:35:29.640 --> 2:35:33.640]  and so um... you're talking about collecting DNA samples yes with pretty much
[2:35:33.640 --> 2:35:36.040]  when they come into different places they do it for
[2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:41.880]  or um especially with HPV vaccine they want to find out the incidence of they're saying
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:48.440]  incidence of AIDS with people that they're giving the HPV vaccine with to to see if
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:54.600]  you know what the burden the AIDS burden is but it's also just collecting people's DNA samples
[2:35:54.600 --> 2:36:02.040]  you know and um you know running them through to archive them so if you're doing this worldwide
[2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:09.160]  i can honestly say that i can't think of a country that they're not in except maybe north korea
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:16.920]  and i mean even you know but they do it a lot of times through like the world health organization
[2:36:16.920 --> 2:36:22.120]  like they even work with art you know evil iran and things like that so you know there's always
[2:36:22.120 --> 2:36:27.560]  like a conduit but you know in big pharma and foundations and everything everybody knows
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:34.360]  everybody everybody's worked for everybody i mean in one pharmaceutical company one of the
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:41.800]  people at the FDA had worked with our president of the company before so she got orphan drug status
[2:36:41.800 --> 2:36:49.080]  i mean it's like you know it's a very incestuous uh group of people you would think it would be
[2:36:49.720 --> 2:36:53.560]  not but it is when you look at the numbers you're colliding all these
[2:36:53.560 --> 2:37:00.360]  countries some african countries you'll have 40 45 percent of the population with hiv which we
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:05.960]  notice a cover for a bunch of other uh soft kill uh operations going on by some of the uh
[2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:12.520]  neural loader types and you know you see Nobel prize winners coming out and saying hiv's a bio
[2:37:12.520 --> 2:37:17.400]  weapon in africa you see african leaders saying and and then you i've seen a bbc articles i keep
[2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:22.120]  mentioning it one a few years ago where they admitted they said you know they tested thousands
[2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:26.680]  of girls and none of them had ever had sex you know they took that they but they looked at their
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:32.120]  uh anatomy they had medical exams done and they said and but we don't know why then
[2:37:32.840 --> 2:37:38.600]  they all have h you know who we tested have hiv they never had blood transfusions they never had
[2:37:38.600 --> 2:37:43.880]  and and they said they said oh maybe the health workers are using the same needles but then you
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:47.960]  don't have as high a transmission just with that level of the virus getting in you know it's it's a
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:53.320]  virus that is is uh you need a high saturation to get high numbers of people contracting it
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:58.680]  successfully at least with the previous mutations so i mean just magically i i wonder how you're
[2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:04.600]  getting 40 45 percent and and and quite a few countries getting the hiv uh i mean what's going
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:11.640]  on there well um you know i'm not quite sure how they're transmitting a lot of this but
[2:38:12.360 --> 2:38:16.680]  you know then you're presuming that these people actually had health care where they actually got
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:24.840]  stuck by a needle which is probably never happened in their life you know so you know i'd you know
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:30.040]  there there could be some third transmission thing that could be putting in their food somehow or
[2:38:30.760 --> 2:38:34.840]  you know who knows they could actually be spraying stuff because they do a lot of spraying for
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:38.840]  different things around there well that's the thing hiv is really a weak virus as you know
[2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:44.360]  i mean what it lives in the air for about three seconds um i think you know it depends you know
[2:38:44.360 --> 2:38:49.560]  you can kind of encapsulate it doesn't last very long it only lasts you know like five minutes on
[2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:55.400]  a toilet seat or something like that so um you'd have to really work at getting infected which
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:01.400]  you probably couldn't do but you said on a toilet seat you could live say in saliva or live in some
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:05.800]  other excretion you know inside of the liquid but i mean doesn't it for those that don't know
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:11.800]  oxygen is very corrosive to it eat holes and steal uh uh uh you know over time uh i mean i'm
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:15.800]  well i mean you're an expert in this how how long in open air if it wasn't encapsulated
[2:39:15.800 --> 2:39:20.120]  say in saliva what hiv live and and or or you may not have those studies in front of you
[2:39:20.680 --> 2:39:23.960]  i don't have them in front of me but i you know i know it's something really low like
[2:39:23.960 --> 2:39:28.040]  you know 10 minutes or something like that and you know they they found that people who live
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:32.920]  with people who didn't know they had hiv or whatever have used their toothbrush and you
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:36.760]  know and you can be abrasive in your mouth with well what is it about more than half the time
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:41.880]  women that have hiv don't pass it on to their baby right they've been making it through the
[2:39:41.880 --> 2:39:48.440]  placenta yeah right and if you get certain drugs and and deliver the baby a certain way
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:53.240]  you know you can avoid affection i mean a lot of times the babies will test positive that they've
[2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:58.920]  been exposed to the virus because there'll be antibodies in there but they won't ever develop
[2:39:58.920 --> 2:40:04.760]  you know hiv or a that's another issue have you seen the studies that it's uh much more damaging
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:14.840]  to uh those that uh have uh black genetics yeah and um other kind of yeah it's it's amazing
[2:40:14.840 --> 2:40:22.360]  because you can have really basically race-based you know diseases my my feeling on some of this
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:27.160]  is you know they find out the genetic sequencing of certain things like certain diseases and they
[2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:31.560]  are saying well we're looking for a cure but you can actually maybe then give it to people to
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:36.200]  actually get that disease so um if you know what the sequence is well just so happens in
[2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:42.760]  northern europeans and this is again mainstream news don't have the protein binder that the hiv
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:46.840]  needs or or it only has one of them but then they just came out and said we're but italians
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:52.920]  because they had larger influences of asian and uh of course uh i don't want to use the word negro
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:57.080]  because the public's so dumbed down they think it's a racist term caucasian negro folks it's a
[2:40:57.080 --> 2:41:03.080]  scientific term uh they uh there's a lot of that bloodline in italy and so the italians are many
[2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:11.240]  times more likely to contract it say versus uh finn mm-hmm so yeah i think that's totally
[2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:16.440]  that's totally true there's very um there's genetic predisposition to the certain kind of uh
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:23.880]  you know viruses and diseases and you know like carposi sarcoma only happened in italian men before
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:32.040]  the AIDS epidemic yet so um yeah it's it's very scary and the one thing with the hpv vaccine
[2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:39.400]  i think it's very odd that they picked this you know as a woman yes we want cervical prevention
[2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:44.920]  programs and there's very good techniques to detect cervical cancer and very cheap techniques just
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:50.680]  swabbing the cervix with uh acetic acid which is basically white vinegar and looking and seeing
[2:41:50.680 --> 2:41:57.560]  if any um lesions appear visually i mean they'll just show right up and so why not just do that
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:42:01.480]  and they would you know recommend that four times in a woman's life in these third world countries
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:07.640]  that they have that sort of visual infection and that to me is a lot cheaper they could bring them
[2:42:07.640 --> 2:42:12.360]  in for all sorts of other you know health things and breast cancer and things like that but you
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:19.720]  know it supposedly like it kills between a quarter million and five hundred thousand women a you
[2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:24.840]  know a year which when you look at the huge population and all the different weird diseases
[2:42:24.840 --> 2:42:30.440]  out there it's not really and it's a very treatable disease well how many does uh we see um
[2:42:31.880 --> 2:42:37.080]  i mean what do we see the mosquito born uh you know diseases killing every year i mean just one
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:44.680]  of them alone kills what 30 million people right and you know and so it's kind of like a very weird
[2:42:44.680 --> 2:42:54.120]  sort of you know vaccine to be promoting and to me it the incidents of it and the epidemiology of
[2:42:54.120 --> 2:42:59.720]  it and the you know demographics and stuff like prevention programs and you know that's right
[2:42:59.720 --> 2:43:05.480]  what is it it's less than 4 000 deaths a year from cervical cancer in the united states and most
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:10.200]  those have been drug abusers are extremely promiscuous they're generally above 45 and have
[2:43:10.200 --> 2:43:17.560]  a long-term viral infection and it's kind of like smoking you know it just insults the cells over
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:21.960]  and over again well it's the same thing with these warts and and and with these infections it just
[2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:28.920]  insults the cells causes a rapid rate of of replication in the cells and so the genetic
[2:43:28.920 --> 2:43:33.960]  code breaks down faster and so you get a faster rise and then i've seen all the studies about
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:39.960]  if they just go scrape it off uh than he almost you have zero chance so it's basically a medical
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:43.320]  i mean you were telling me about the you know the cheap testing with vinegar but but they
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:49.240]  won't allow that they just say let's just shoot them all up right and and the and also in the
[2:43:49.240 --> 2:43:53.400]  u.s i don't know what they don't i know why they don't use it in the u.s because it would be really
[2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:59.320]  cost effective to bring women in and do this but the doctors who own the labs won't get the money
[2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:05.400]  to have the you know since uh skin cell scrapings and send them off to their cheap labs and
[2:44:06.200 --> 2:44:12.440]  manila or something to be read by some technician and uh when they can just do a very quick visual
[2:44:12.440 --> 2:44:16.280]  inspection it would be very inexpensive for those that don't know it's a fact you put vinegar on
[2:44:16.280 --> 2:44:22.520]  the cervix and tell them what it does um it basically you know how proxide will kind of
[2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:28.840]  make your skin turn white it kind of does the same thing it's a it it it makes the cervix
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:35.320]  if there's any kind of cancer on there it'll you know you'll be able to see the round lesion or
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:41.240]  a weird cell it's kind of like i guess the only way i can kind of describe it is
[2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:46.840]  like putting um you know hydrogen peroxide on there and it's like the black light bulb that
[2:44:46.840 --> 2:44:52.360]  police have to see if you've got gunpowder on your hands right and it just lights stuff up it
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:57.720]  turns out white you can see right there there it is you know there's the there's the lesions and
[2:44:57.720 --> 2:45:04.200]  then you go in and have either your cryotherapy or you know have it scraped depending on you know how
[2:45:04.200 --> 2:45:09.000]  how advanced but instead millions of women and girls have now taken it just the last year and a
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:13.160]  half of approval and they're they're trying to keep it quiet but it's come out in the mainstream
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:19.320]  huge amounts of deaths and adverse reactions and it doesn't even protect you for about a
[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:26.360]  fraction of the um virus varieties well they said they said first they said it was 80 percent and
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:33.160]  now it's 70 percent but then they still say you still have to come in for a cervical exam so what's
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:40.600]  the point and to me they're not injecting they're not giving this to men and men have it just as
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:46.840]  many deaths from this kind of cervical cancer virus as women do they have maybe slightly less
[2:45:46.840 --> 2:45:53.000]  there's like 3 000 in women and 2 000 in men so why aren't they injecting men well now they're
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:58.760]  pushing that well what i don't understand is uh reading in the literature it's you know it says
[2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:05.080]  that if you already have the virus that it you know that it has a massive increase in even and
[2:46:05.080 --> 2:46:10.760]  and then developing the cancer if you take the vaccine do you know why that is um
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:16.280]  you mean you have oh yeah because you know you've sensitized your immune system and sometimes
[2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:21.800]  your immune system fights stuff off or sometimes that just it actually jump starts whatever may
[2:46:21.800 --> 2:46:29.160]  be there or may come into your system so it can go one way or the other normally it would you know
[2:46:29.160 --> 2:46:36.120]  prevent you know whatever uh you know the human papillomavirus but once you if the cancer is there
[2:46:36.120 --> 2:46:42.520]  or you um you know are exposed to that and you start to have the cancer it actually acts as a
[2:46:42.520 --> 2:46:48.600]  catalyst now it sensitizes your well it's kind of like women will have a herpes flare up when
[2:46:48.600 --> 2:46:52.680]  they're menstruating or about to have a child it's stress related and perhaps that stress
[2:46:52.680 --> 2:46:58.440]  is is is i mean they don't see why in the insert it just i'm like my god if a large portion of
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:03.480]  women already have this virus and it isn't hurting them and it's something like 47 percent why on
[2:47:03.480 --> 2:47:07.880]  earth would they ever come out with a vaccine where they don't test you before you take it to
[2:47:07.880 --> 2:47:12.680]  see if you have it and if you do have it it's saying it massively increases you developing
[2:47:12.680 --> 2:47:21.080]  the cancer right and and yeah it's just it's um it sensitizes you to the cancer and makes
[2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:26.760]  it it you know a lot of the reason i can't answer this is a lot of things with the immune system
[2:47:26.760 --> 2:47:33.320]  we just don't know we don't know why you know people a lot of times develop arthritis or
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:40.200]  even lupus so instead of using rhesus monkeys we've now got people in the third world
[2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:46.920]  right and you know but the thing is it looks like it's done under really excellent protocols and
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:52.040]  this and that but you know there's just very lack structure and oversight in a lot of these countries
[2:47:52.040 --> 2:47:59.560]  and it's um you know it's it's very scary because you can just sort of in in third world countries
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:03.400]  you can just say well we couldn't find these people you know to follow up with them or this
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:10.360]  and there's and there's deaths they just quietly shut down the study um yeah that's essentially what we've done in closing
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:15.960]  what is the melinda gates foundation going to do when they find out that one of their
[2:48:15.960 --> 2:48:22.200]  high-level people low in public on air uh well hopefully you know i didn't tell any
[2:48:23.240 --> 2:48:32.200]  too many specific i guess i i don't know hopefully hopefully nothing or they may tell me to
[2:48:32.200 --> 2:48:37.480]  just they figure out it's me tell me to shut up but i don't know i mean that may not happen the
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:42.200]  point is i mean just you were telling me that just the most basic stuff they freak out about
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:47.000]  anything being public so i don't think this will please them no and you know they're getting more
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:53.800]  and more consolidated they're using less and less contractors um they're bringing things in house
[2:48:53.800 --> 2:48:59.400]  now that they've kind of gone away from these you know they still do these very you know wonderful
[2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:04.760]  charity programs and stuff but if they get into more things with pharmaceutical companies and more
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:10.200]  vaccines and as they move on to the real project mm-hmm yeah they're they're basically closing
[2:49:10.760 --> 2:49:16.280]  closing up and becoming very uh secretive well we've also got yeah go ahead i was just gonna
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:22.040]  say i i really haven't said anything to anybody out there listening that isn't public domain i've
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:26.760]  just kind of pulled it all together here that you know people don't know people don't know that
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:32.520]  universities do this and this group does this and they're showing for that what about studies with
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:39.640]  how to have quote vaccines or or genetic engineering compounds that actively work on the host that's
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:45.160]  incredible into fruits and vegetables where where where because they're saying the africans you know
[2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:49.080]  they're they don't trust us because they're ignorant we're going to engineer it into the food i'm
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:53.640]  sure you're you're aware of that stuff oh yeah and the one thing i wanted to say real quick about
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:59.880]  the hpv vaccine is the adjuvant they use to you know create the immune response to get the absorption
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:06.360]  going is aluminum they're kind of moving away from mercury into aluminum so um that's in there but
[2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:11.640]  yeah there's a lot of genetically engineered food and all these things can pass through the
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:16.200]  membrane of the of the vegetables and stuff and you know the only thing that can kill it is like
[2:50:16.200 --> 2:50:23.320]  radiating it so amazing stay there let's do five more minutes and i promise callers bob rod kathy and
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:27.480]  others that are patiently holding we're going to get to all of you coming up uh end of the fourth
[2:50:27.480 --> 2:50:31.400]  hour and a ton of financial news as all of that unfolds i want to spend a few more minutes with
[2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:37.080]  our guests when we come right back do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:42.040]  own financial future is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your
[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:46.440]  retirement savings account do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly
[2:50:46.440 --> 2:50:51.320]  wipe out some or all of your hard earned savings you can turn adversity into opportunity individual
[2:50:51.320 --> 2:50:57.160]  retirement accounts and most 401ks 403b seps and other retirement plans can be rolled over into
[2:50:57.160 --> 2:51:01.080]  self-directed accounts using gold and silver there are definitely some do's and don'ts with
[2:51:01.080 --> 2:51:08.520]  this rollover process and that's where mitis resources comes in call us at 1-866-323-5665

[2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:18.120]  power even if other financial assets are failing it's not a question of if you'll need precious
[2:51:18.120 --> 2:51:23.000]  metals in your portfolio it's a question of when so whether you're planning for an economic rainy

[2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:45.080]  act of war against this country the enemy struck america on september 11th but who is the enemy
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:49.400]  bin laden this is his m o we have to look to the middle east we have to look to his home of
[2:51:49.400 --> 2:51:54.440]  bin laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[2:51:54.440 --> 2:51:59.240]  intelligence networks inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there are
[2:51:59.240 --> 2:52:06.600]  israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that some israeli citizens
[2:52:06.600 --> 2:52:12.280]  have been detained and laden's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the saudi
[2:52:12.280 --> 2:52:16.520]  arabian connection the israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow

[2:53:40.760 --> 2:53:50.440]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:53:54.040 --> 2:54:01.800]  okay since the uh finishing up here i tell the public that the federal government's gonna put
[2:54:01.800 --> 2:54:06.440]  brain reading and it doesn't really do that it's so they can make it up and claim probable cause
[2:54:06.440 --> 2:54:09.960]  you know just as soon as their old uh a lot of techers get thrown out of court now they come up
[2:54:09.960 --> 2:54:14.840]  with a new quackery uh and stuff that looks through your clothes and record your naked body that's
[2:54:14.840 --> 2:54:19.640]  not going up on the streets they're now announcing oh all those cameras put up for for traffic by
[2:54:19.640 --> 2:54:23.400]  the feds they're really homeland security we're watching you well it's the same thing with all
[2:54:23.400 --> 2:54:27.720]  these announcements going back over a decade of genetically engineered crops that have quote
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:32.840]  you know uh vaccines in them but then to even call them vaccines it's really a genetically
[2:54:32.840 --> 2:54:37.160]  engineered uh trigger that then goes in and engineers things in your body and then they
[2:54:37.160 --> 2:54:43.880]  admit that if they can just claim that it might help say do a but they admit it well well it might
[2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:50.520]  do bcd you know all the way down to z bad they just say so what we're doing it and and and it
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:56.120]  it just is amazing and then they won't even approve some mainline drug for something else it's just
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:03.800]  incredible yeah and um it you know there was a recent article out and people can probably google
[2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:09.960]  it is that in in china with all this tainted milk you know everybody's up in arms but the elite
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:15.960]  get their rice you know their rice patties from that are like mountain springs and they have
[2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:20.520]  organic beef under strict controls and stuff like that and then the rest of us are made to eat
[2:55:21.160 --> 2:55:27.160]  you know paint thinner so um it's it's very scary what they're they just are thrown crap
[2:55:27.160 --> 2:55:32.760]  into our food and a lot of this is a big friggin experiment too honest on on certain levels
[2:55:32.760 --> 2:55:40.040]  especially with genetic mod genetically modified food and um for me i make all my own homemade
[2:55:40.040 --> 2:55:46.680]  dog food and um yeah because a lot of dog foods dead animals other dead pets sold by the vets
[2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:51.800]  put into these big vats called awful to the word and that's awful comes from awful means
[2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:56.440]  giant vats of rotten meat and then they feed rotten meat to cows what's the scientific term
[2:55:56.440 --> 2:56:03.960]  for feeding something itself um you mean besides cannibalism yeah there's another term my dad was
[2:56:03.960 --> 2:56:08.920]  using it the other day but uh i mean when you're talking to other scientists are any of them
[2:56:08.920 --> 2:56:16.600]  concerned or or is it just kind of ask so what it's fun um you know the scary part is everybody's
[2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:23.640]  like oh so oh oh well you know what i mean it's kind of like they kind of laugh at me too because
[2:56:23.640 --> 2:56:29.560]  they're like oh especially a friend of mine went and got a flu shot and i'm like don't get a flu
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:35.240]  shot it doesn't protect you against anything it's going to make you sick and she got the flu shot
[2:56:35.240 --> 2:56:40.040]  and i had to go haha for the next week she had the worst flu she i've never had the flu i like
[2:56:40.040 --> 2:56:45.640]  the things i have family you know not distant but they're not you know it's like first second
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:51.720]  cousins and and i'll explain i'll go the last six years they haven't even gotten the mutation right
[2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:57.560]  for the proper flu well they put three different types in and they didn't believe me and i showed
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:57:02.680]  them in it on i showed them a mainline story and they said i don't care i'm still getting it and i'm
[2:57:02.680 --> 2:57:09.640]  like yeah and they're always like a year off on whatever strains happening you know and they just
[2:57:09.640 --> 2:57:16.040]  kind of throw this crap into a vat and kind of make cook this stuff up and so you don't know what
[2:57:16.040 --> 2:57:20.760]  kind of little weird particles are floating around in there or well that's right all sorts of other
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:26.840]  things get grown in in these vaccine vats don't they right and all different kind of protein bits
[2:57:26.840 --> 2:57:31.560]  and that's the scary part you know they talk about prions with mad cow and stuff like that
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:37.880]  so you don't know what weird little bits of protein or viruses or cell particles crystal
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:43.800]  structures yeah and nobody knows or have maybe even discovered them yet so you don't really
[2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:50.120]  know what's going on i mean so so you've been in vaccine facilities where they're making it or
[2:57:50.120 --> 2:57:55.000]  have you just worked with the studies no i i've worked with the studies and i've worked in companies

[3:00:36.200 --> 3:00:42.440]  do here possible uh such a big part of the solution okay going back to our guests sent to you but
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:00:48.040]  almost now for about an hour and 50 minutes this will make it uh uh just about two hours total air
[3:00:48.040 --> 3:00:54.280]  time uh in closing uh i wanted to talk about uh the types of things that get into the vaccines
[3:00:54.280 --> 3:01:00.360]  the different ways the vaccines are manufactured uh even if it's being manufactured in a non uh
[3:01:00.360 --> 3:01:07.560]  you know uh a protein environment from eggs or rhesus monkey kidneys the the a lot of the seed
[3:01:07.560 --> 3:01:11.880]  stock is and that's passed on you know let's say you're growing it in something then you get all
[3:01:11.880 --> 3:01:17.560]  the other viruses and things it had before they start replicating all sorts of weird things grow
[3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:21.480]  in these giant petri dishes can you describe that for people just the last three minutes
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:28.760]  okay uh basically vaccine facilities look like uh the budweiser brewery i mean they have these big
[3:01:28.760 --> 3:01:33.960]  vats they ferment stuff because most of the stuff they use now is like yeast recombinant
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:42.520]  dna stuff and so they use uh yeast to um replicate whatever um you know strain of the vaccine
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:49.080]  that they're using so basically if you walk in one of those facilities and they really do have
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:53.320]  different yeast i mean i i wasn't kidding they actually do have yeast that we used to kind of
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:02:00.280]  grow up on the side and some of us you know have little homemade beer things and um so basically
[3:02:00.280 --> 3:02:05.960]  they put in different they start out with something that let's say somebody's had a flu and they've
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:12.040]  cultured it out but you know they cultured out with um fetal calf serum and different things
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:19.960]  like that and there's a lot of human you know products that they've you know that's basically
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:25.880]  from people and so there's all this extra little things attached and i don't think they do a very
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:31.480]  good job of like separating out well it's just like bear with the hiv and the hepatitis in every
[3:02:32.040 --> 3:02:37.400]  every dose of factor eight this is human blood this is fetal tissue this is fetal calf tissue
[3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:44.120]  so it's rendered down into these liquid juices but it's all in there yeah and then they put it in
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:50.040]  with the yeast and do the recombinant thing and they use a lot of um believe it or not they would
[3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:54.520]  run around to the hospitals and they collect the foreskins when they circumcise boys because
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:03:00.520]  those are like really good little young cells and so they use those a lot to you know coat
[3:03:01.240 --> 3:03:06.840]  you know flasks and grow their viruses up and the chinese are rendering up all sorts of stuff
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:14.520]  even uh human parts for for cosmetics oh yeah and they do abortions up until almost you know like
[3:03:14.520 --> 3:03:19.960]  eight months or whatever and they use they do testing on like ovaries and uh you know
[3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:26.360]  you know ovaries and little female fetuses and stuff like that that are fully developed
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:29.640]  there's a lot of i should tell you the story about that a friend of mine quit and went into
[3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:35.240]  real estate after she was working with a chinese doctor on that okay i gotta stop you i keep saying
[3:03:35.240 --> 3:03:42.040]  we're gonna let you go uh but uh that's too important to tell see folks these doctors and
[3:03:42.040 --> 3:03:46.440]  scientists are so close to this and she's she's a great patriot blowing the whistle here but but
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:51.080]  i've been around other scientists and doctors it becomes very nonchalant that's a huge area and
[3:03:51.080 --> 3:03:55.560]  china admittedly sells political distance organs does all of that and i know i want to go to the
[3:03:55.560 --> 3:04:00.040]  calls and the financial news but can we come back and i promise it 15 after you'll be gone
[3:04:00.040 --> 3:04:04.920]  uh can we come back and tell that story and then we'll end it there okay and uh i can tell people
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:11.400]  how to not catch the flu wash your hands okay we'll come back and do that we'll go live at

[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:59.560]  transmission your calls coming up and uh recap of the top financial news and some new big developments
[3:07:59.560 --> 3:08:06.760]  i'm here looking at for the last two hours we've been talking to synthia and that again is not her
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:19.240]  name she is a research scientist and she has worked for in a big pharma in biotech engineering
[3:08:19.240 --> 3:08:26.120]  for vaccines and other drugs and at high level for the billa melinda gates foundation and for
[3:08:26.120 --> 3:08:31.000]  those that are watching later on the internet at prison planet dot tv you can go back into the archives
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:35.240]  and hear the last two hours it's been nothing short but amazing but i continue to have to hold
[3:08:35.240 --> 3:08:43.320]  it longer because she just keeps bringing up such important information now it is admitted
[3:08:44.120 --> 3:08:51.080]  that they are creating animal human cross species clones but they claim in the media that they're
[3:08:51.080 --> 3:08:59.320]  killing them at different embryonic phases and they are claiming that they can legally do this
[3:08:59.320 --> 3:09:03.880]  because they're not completely human and then going back over 10 years ago major british papers
[3:09:03.880 --> 3:09:08.760]  and others reported that quietly biotech firms especially in china hong kong south korea where
[3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:17.720]  there's really no control uh they have uh been creating animal human uh hybrids in the embryonic
[3:09:17.720 --> 3:09:23.400]  phase and planting them in cows they're partial they're part bovine or they have genetic traits of
[3:09:23.400 --> 3:09:29.640]  cows so that they're not rejected and also they can grow the humanoids of larger in utero in the
[3:09:29.640 --> 3:09:34.600]  cow now that's all the medical literature i mean that's going on and then you know they announced
[3:09:34.600 --> 3:09:39.240]  oh hey decades ago we really created human clones embryonic form you know cloning's been going on a
[3:09:39.240 --> 3:09:46.360]  long time they just announced it like they were talking about motor oil prices or the price of milk
[3:09:46.360 --> 3:09:52.920]  you're just very nonchalant so a lot of this is going on human hybrids with spiders with monkeys
[3:09:52.920 --> 3:09:59.960]  with apes with and and and pigs and just on and on and on to get heart valves out of the pigs that
[3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:04.120]  look almost you know i mean visibly look like a pig but have a lot of human traits so that the
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:09.480]  heart valves won't be rejected the point is this can give rise a lot of superviruses mutations
[3:10:09.480 --> 3:10:15.320]  that get into bacteria they spread i mean there's just endless endless pandora's box in all this
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:19.560]  as they play russian roulette uh in the last few minutes we had you were bringing up a colleague
[3:10:19.560 --> 3:10:23.560]  who quit you talk about so many quitting you know you leaving bill and melinda gates foundation
[3:10:23.560 --> 3:10:28.360]  recently because you couldn't handle it morally um and you'd left big pharma going there thinking
[3:10:28.360 --> 3:10:33.080]  you could you know that this would be something moral so it's this quest leaving and your friend
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:37.960]  leaving going into real estate because of working with i guess a chinese firm or chinese doctor
[3:10:37.960 --> 3:10:44.360]  dealing with uh babies and and in china is with the with the late term abortions and with reports
[3:10:44.360 --> 3:10:49.720]  of people that have more than one child grabbing the children being used uh in all of this and
[3:10:49.720 --> 3:10:56.440]  cosmetics rendered flesh of dead prisoners and others being used in cosmetics so the dehumanization
[3:10:56.440 --> 3:11:02.920]  really getting bad so spend a few minutes on that well um yeah you're talking about chimeras and
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:10.520]  that's the one reason i left the lab and uh started working uh more you know in the administrative
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:16.520]  side because basically they were genetically altering mice there's things called skid mice that
[3:11:16.520 --> 3:11:22.760]  have lupus and you know just bizarre things like that so there's all this human diseases and animals
[3:11:22.760 --> 3:11:29.560]  and i just started like you know i don't want to be who knows you know how how i could pick that
[3:11:29.560 --> 3:11:35.320]  stuff up so i just kind of left the lab and and went you know into the more clinical trials part
[3:11:35.320 --> 3:11:40.120]  where you know away from let me interrupt again do you ever hear about other colleagues or other
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:44.120]  people where there's bizarre illnesses i mean i know in huntsville they were testing stuff
[3:11:44.120 --> 3:11:48.520]  illegally on the inmates and then they got a bunch of guards sick of some diet that even came out in
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:52.360]  some texas papers about seven eight years ago i mean do you ever hear about stuff like that
[3:11:53.240 --> 3:11:59.080]  yes and um what i'll tell you about the chinese incident um a friend of a friend of mine and i
[3:11:59.080 --> 3:12:03.960]  had been talking to her about some different lab equipment that had alarms you know if the
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:10.760]  temperature dropped or blah blah blah and so um one day i called up and i said well where's janet
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:15.880]  and she goes well she quit and i said well why and she was working with a chinese doctor who
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:22.120]  was still working as this was on the east coast at a really big hospital out there and he was
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:28.440]  still had very close ties to the chinese government and chinese researchers and my friend was doing
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:34.760]  fertility research you know are you jammed this you know for people jam the sperm right into the egg
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:42.200]  you know if it can't swim or you know things like that the gene gun yeah and it's called icky
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:47.800]  is what it is and if there's a reason you don't put non-swimming sperm into an egg because then
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:55.320]  all their kids had cystic fibrosis but um anyway uh so she quit and i'm like what is she doing if
[3:12:55.320 --> 3:13:00.440]  she's like she's selling like century 21 real estate and i'm like what you know she was like
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:07.480]  this really big scientist and the vagaries i got was that the chinese scientist she was working
[3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:14.520]  with in washington dc was working with chinese scientists and basically china can do abortions
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:21.800]  on women up until the you know pretty much delivery and they were taking in female fetuses
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:28.360]  um you know women are born with all the eggs we're going to have in our lifetime in the ovaries
[3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:32.600]  but they don't really develop into eggs until we hit puberty but they're all
[3:13:32.600 --> 3:13:38.120]  like they're the little pre eggs they were harvesting all of those and doing all sorts of
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:44.120]  genetic you know experiments on that and maturing them up and using them for basically they're
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:49.720]  using the parts of the fetus to do all this testing on and what really freaked her out
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:54.120]  is they had you know you're talking about cows and fetuses and stuff like that
[3:13:54.120 --> 3:13:58.040]  they would i mean we're talking like 15 years ago so who knows where they are now
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:14:04.040]  but they had like living fetuses and tanks that they had genetically you know kind of
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:11.000]  grown up like horses and pigs and things like that and they were they were you know basically
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:15.640]  having all these little things outside the womb growing in tanks and it was gross you know because
[3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:22.360]  they'd be gulping whatever fluid they were in and things like that okay i lied i lied i'm not
[3:14:22.360 --> 3:14:27.160]  letting you go we read words about this this has been in the mainstream news but just a mention
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:35.480]  here i mentioned there you're saying at a laboratory in dc 15 years ago or in the early 1990s jesus i
[3:14:35.480 --> 3:14:38.920]  can't handle this and i'm sorry i'm not using lord's name in vain i'm crying out to jesus
[3:14:38.920 --> 3:14:46.360]  i can't handle it anymore obviously she couldn't describe little babies gulping in
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:50.840]  tanks now now this has all been admitted but they never show it to anybody describe this
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:57.720]  hellish thing you're talking about actually they were animal fetuses she didn't she was so freaked
[3:14:57.720 --> 3:15:02.840]  out she wouldn't even tell my other friend why she was so freaked out she would only but you said
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:07.400]  it was in relation with two human genetics yeah basically that's how they're getting around it
[3:15:07.400 --> 3:15:14.200]  these were what were these chimeras right and um they were chimeras you're saying they were chimeras
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:21.160]  no these were they could have been chimeras but they were just practicing growing fetuses up like
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:28.200]  with animals in in tanks without using you know the female uterus exitutile tanks yeah
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:36.280]  yeah and but they were harvesting these eggs and you know they're and on some level you can't
[3:15:36.280 --> 3:15:43.000]  really use those for uh you know like fertility like if somebody needs an egg surrogate or something
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:47.160]  like that but they were experimenting on ways of maturing them up so they would have all this
[3:15:47.880 --> 3:15:52.920]  materials putting them into hormone baths and things like that yeah and i don't who knows what
[3:15:52.920 --> 3:15:58.200]  else they were sticking them in you know oh god they were but she was just freaked out at the
[3:15:58.200 --> 3:16:05.400]  you know what how they were harvesting them what late stage you know babies basically you know if
[3:16:05.400 --> 3:16:10.760]  they're about to be you know so harvesting human babies for their parts to then do this research
[3:16:11.480 --> 3:16:18.520]  and then obviously trying to test how to keep them alive uh now now now what else along these
[3:16:18.520 --> 3:16:25.160]  these these dr maru lines did you ever run into or hear about um well you know sort of
[3:16:25.160 --> 3:16:31.560]  basically that and it was kind of like what what were they why i mean china has more than enough
[3:16:31.560 --> 3:16:38.280]  people why are they trying to grow you know fetuses or do all this genetic engineering with
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:45.240]  eggs you know and you know if they have an unlimited supply of eggs you don't have to harvest them
[3:16:45.240 --> 3:16:50.520]  from an adult woman you can just go straight to the fetus and if you can mature them up then you
[3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:59.480]  can take these eggs and inject whatever genetic structures or materials or you know DNA into them
[3:16:59.480 --> 3:17:04.920]  and then maybe grow them up in a surrogate or grow them up in a tank well no that's what's
[3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:14.360]  admitted is they say chimera embryos for implantation in host mammals but i guess what she's talking
[3:17:14.360 --> 3:17:21.080]  about is skipping using a cow or a pig as a host to chestate but to just go straight to tanks
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:29.320]  right and they were um you know in fact my friend saw the the little film i should ask i should
[3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:35.240]  call rep and ask her where that film was that she saw that basically chose them growing up like
[3:17:35.240 --> 3:17:39.640]  horses and she said she was totally grossed out because you know here's these little fetuses
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:43.880]  and tanks it was like the x-files you know and they you know they're alive so they're
[3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:49.880]  moving around and Cynthia this is the problem imagine what's going on in the underground
[3:17:49.880 --> 3:17:54.520]  bases and in the secret black op operations and what corporations are doing and it's huge
[3:17:54.520 --> 3:17:59.640]  because in the mid eighties they tried to hire my dad and all the other you know top of the class
[3:17:59.640 --> 3:18:05.640]  baler dentist and the neural surgeons for a secret government project and and and remember my dad
[3:18:05.640 --> 3:18:09.640]  saying look they're trying to hire a bunch of people and they say it's a huge project but it's
[3:18:09.640 --> 3:18:15.000]  secret and so if i sign on i'm not even sure what it is but it's cybernetics and it's not
[3:18:15.000 --> 3:18:19.480]  like my dad got chosen to be some super astronaut or something it was they were getting a lot of the
[3:18:19.480 --> 3:18:24.040]  top Pete you know of you know all the trying to hire him and and he said no because they didn't want
[3:18:24.040 --> 3:18:30.840]  to we didn't want to move to Maryland but my god imagine how big this really is right and i mean
[3:18:30.840 --> 3:18:37.480]  if this is the level she's at because she was the this person's research technician at this
[3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:43.320]  you know hospital in washington dc and she was just freaked out where she was they were getting
[3:18:43.320 --> 3:18:48.360]  the material to do these fertility studies on and he was just getting him from china because he had
[3:18:48.360 --> 3:18:52.920]  all these you know he was chinese and he had all these connections with the chinese government
[3:18:52.920 --> 3:18:57.560]  well it's life extension research for the elite will never even even though this is horrible
[3:18:57.560 --> 3:19:05.640]  dangerous destroy you know human value there is no doubt that we will the public will not even
[3:19:05.640 --> 3:19:09.400]  have access to it not to mention the sin that's being committed doing it but we won't even
[3:19:09.400 --> 3:19:15.080]  share in it whatever's developed by it we're going to end this interview now for the full info
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:19.720]  wars audience on the m&f and shortwave satellite we're going to say bye in this four minute break
[3:19:19.720 --> 3:19:23.320]  and we're going to come back and go to everybody's calls bob rod kathy shon murray
[3:19:24.440 --> 3:19:32.360]  and everybody else uh so stay with us but stay there uh sentia okay sentia you know the drill
[3:19:32.360 --> 3:19:38.360]  we're just at prison planet dot tv on the info wars dot com streams right now uh just uh in closing
[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:42.200]  you got three or four minutes i just want to thank you for your great courage any former colleagues
[3:19:42.200 --> 3:19:45.400]  that want to come on if you could even try to get a hold of that lady and if you haven't seen her in
[3:19:45.400 --> 3:19:51.560]  15 years anybody else watching or listening who wants to come on here with anonymity you got to
[3:19:51.560 --> 3:19:57.160]  obviously prove your credentials so we don't get played here but anyone that wants to expose this
[3:19:57.160 --> 3:20:03.160]  you know any genetic engineers or epidemiologists or urologists uh who want to come on and blow
[3:20:03.160 --> 3:20:08.680]  the whistle anything or just discuss the ethics of this uh we will um we will have you here and
[3:20:08.680 --> 3:20:13.480]  protect your identity and that goes for any whistleblowers period but just anything in this
[3:20:13.480 --> 3:20:21.880]  two two hour 15 minute interview that you haven't been able to add uh sentia um no that i you know
[3:20:21.880 --> 3:20:26.600]  there's more but you know i'd have to like ponder it and put it more into a thoughtful form i think
[3:20:26.600 --> 3:20:32.920]  you know what i've seen and different things like that to me it's kind of sad alex but these
[3:20:32.920 --> 3:20:38.840]  things about the chinese ovaries and stuff are like oh yeah i know about this you know what i mean and
[3:20:38.840 --> 3:20:42.600]  you know it's kind of scary when i think about it now that you've kind of brought it up so
[3:20:42.600 --> 3:20:47.880]  but i i want to say that if you ever want somebody to come on and explain what's going on with a
[3:20:47.880 --> 3:20:55.000]  vaccine or whatever and you need a little expert input you know i'm available so well i mean even
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:20:59.320]  if they're not going to release a bile weapon on us on purpose which they're clearly gearing up for
[3:20:59.320 --> 3:21:06.040]  to try to bring in you know a new order of police state and control it they've already had swine flu
[3:21:06.040 --> 3:21:11.640]  disasters always other disasters and drug disasters and now the order of the disaster you know the
[3:21:11.640 --> 3:21:17.960]  severity is just increasing exponentially with all the thousands of companies randomly doing all of
[3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:23.480]  this i mean god knows if our destruction hasn't already leaked out and is quietly waiting to
[3:21:23.480 --> 3:21:29.880]  replicate right now well yeah and a lot of labs that i've worked in have done stuff like accidentally
[3:21:29.880 --> 3:21:35.800]  released radioactive iodine when i worked at one company down on the waterfront in seattle it
[3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:42.600]  blew radioactive iodine in the air and i mean there's a lot of kind of containment and disposal
[3:21:42.600 --> 3:21:47.000]  issues and you know that you could even get into that are just really let me guess did that end up
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:53.320]  hitting the news that there was that release uh no i don't think so but we knew about it
[3:21:53.320 --> 3:21:58.840]  and i think you know yeah the alarms go off you're putting mask on running out of the parking lot
[3:21:58.840 --> 3:22:05.800]  or running into uh tanks no supposedly it happened at night but you know i'm on thyroid medication
[3:22:05.800 --> 3:22:10.760]  because my thyroid's toasted from the radioactive iodine and stuff i've been exposed to over the
[3:22:10.760 --> 3:22:18.440]  years now yeah our office is run by a chemical plant but well i mean what about you you also
[3:22:18.440 --> 3:22:22.760]  mentioned scientists and others you work around you know hearing about releases people getting
[3:22:22.760 --> 3:22:26.920]  sick not knowing why i mean is that routine or how many times have you seen or heard about that
[3:22:28.120 --> 3:22:34.200]  um you know it's um you know they when you go to work for a company what they don't tell you
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:39.000]  is they take your blood before you start and then they take your blood after you're there
[3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:44.360]  i don't know if they want to you know if you come back and want to sue them saying i got exposed
[3:22:44.360 --> 3:22:47.880]  to this they'll go well look you had it before you know because you don't really trust them to
[3:22:47.880 --> 3:22:52.920]  how they keep your blood sample that's like level four bio weapons lab people uh they get their blood
[3:22:52.920 --> 3:22:58.920]  taken all the time yeah and i was offered a job at oh god i can't remember the company but they
[3:22:58.920 --> 3:23:04.120]  were doing a lot of hiv things and i'm like thanks but no thanks you know so um it would have been
[3:23:04.120 --> 3:23:10.440]  a level four facility well Cynthia level four facility uh we really appreciate you coming on
[3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:15.960]  the show and stay in contact with us and uh you've got my office numbers you've got other numbers
[3:23:15.960 --> 3:23:20.760]  and god bless you we appreciate your courage okay and thanks for having me on it's a long alec
[3:23:20.760 --> 3:23:25.160]  that was great having you on very informative uh radio we appreciate your courage take care
[3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:29.640]  okay you too bye bye here we go live transmission bring me in
[3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:35.480]  everybody knows
[3:23:35.480 --> 3:23:45.880]  everybody knows that the days are loaded everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
[3:23:46.680 --> 3:23:54.840]  everybody knows the war is over everybody knows the good guys lost
[3:23:54.840 --> 3:24:04.440]  everybody knows when you roll the dice no they're loaded of course they pull the rich get rich
[3:24:04.440 --> 3:24:12.280]  that's how it goes evil and corruption gets emboldened everybody by not being caught not
[3:24:12.280 --> 3:24:21.000]  being punished everybody knows that the bold and in this society the criminals run the asylum and
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:24.920]  they're making us criminals they're making things that have never been criminal criminal and they're
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:30.920]  making true criminal activities non-criminal all right i said i'd take calls we're gonna
[3:24:30.920 --> 3:24:36.040]  everybody here uh and in fairness everybody let's move quickly bob in north carolina you're on the
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:41.880]  air bob no it's bob in north dakota okay well they told me north carolina we'll just say you're
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:47.560]  calling from from ten buck two how you doing bob oh pretty good i think you've done a successful
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:53.720]  job again of proving that these uh global parasites are at work again um you and your guests but um
[3:24:54.280 --> 3:24:58.520]  how much longer are we going to tolerate this are we going to wait till they show up to our houses
[3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:02.600]  i've i've been listening to you my actually your program is part of our homeschooling
[3:25:03.160 --> 3:25:08.840]  and i would really like to start hearing more militia leaders this can't be tolerated much longer
[3:25:08.840 --> 3:25:14.200]  because as it is with me i've already had cps come to house three different times and it's not
[3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:21.160]  going to be too much longer before we have to whack somebody well they in the past the states
[3:25:21.160 --> 3:25:25.560]  always wanted to take children i mean they tried to come kill jesus they tried to come kill um
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:30.040]  moses and if you look at other societies they were always coming and taking your kids to kill
[3:25:30.040 --> 3:25:34.200]  them the state always wants to take your kids make them slaves make them soldiers kill them
[3:25:34.840 --> 3:25:38.280]  and they would never do that here because parents would go crazy on them but we were
[3:25:38.280 --> 3:25:43.080]  domesticated and prepared to hand our children over to them and yeah they've banned homeschooling
[3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:47.400]  in california they're harassing and people are fleeing the state they're trying to ban it everywhere
[3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:53.160]  cps workers are getting whacked and uh you know you got scumbag neighbors that think it's illegal
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:57.480]  that your children aren't at school and uh you might before you whack somebody you might just
[3:25:57.480 --> 3:26:01.560]  want to move i know it's hard to move but move it's probably a wicked neighbor do you have a
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:05.960]  wicked neighbor next door oh it's the bank of the judge and the city council member that i'm
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:10.680]  worrying with because i own probably the largest in our land in town oh that's it well you need to
[3:26:10.680 --> 3:26:16.040]  go confront them at city council and let them know you're aware yeah oh yeah we videotape them
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:20.600]  they openly break the law they don't care i mean this has got to the point out it's like you just
[3:26:20.600 --> 3:26:26.600]  said you know they outlawed homeschooling in california yeah they illegally did this everything
[3:26:26.600 --> 3:26:31.240]  they're doing is illegal you have many listeners all they want to do is talk talk talk the talking
[3:26:31.240 --> 3:26:36.760]  is over it's coming to an end very quickly they better be organized they better know how to fight
[3:26:36.760 --> 3:26:41.720]  because when these parasites come to your door and you and your little kids are packing a case
[3:26:42.360 --> 3:26:46.200]  they kind of find a different way to go about things and that's what's going to happen in
[3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:51.960]  this country before very long i just get entire people how dare you say it's bad for them to
[3:26:51.960 --> 3:26:57.080]  knowingly put hiv and hepatitis in the vaccines publicly and kill millions how dare you say it's
[3:26:57.080 --> 3:27:03.320]  wrong of them to take babies and use their parts you're evil okay the government uh using baby
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:09.320]  parts is good oh yeah they absolutely will tell you that you know if you try to protect your kids
[3:27:09.320 --> 3:27:14.600]  oh we got a protective daddy here well we got a pretty yeah i got a protective daddy
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:19.240]  you'll cap you won't see twice about it you know but the thing is that the if your listeners are
[3:27:19.240 --> 3:27:23.320]  not part of an organized militia they are not following the bill of rights and they are not
[3:27:23.320 --> 3:27:29.960]  being patriotic in any way shape or um well sir we tolerate this we listen my job is being a beacon
[3:27:29.960 --> 3:27:36.440]  or a lighthouse and we're here to inform people about what's going on that's my job and a lot of
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:42.040]  people say hey let's start shooting it's not my job to call for that that is not what i'm calling for
[3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:48.360]  i put out the info and then you make what decisions you think best i know this we're turning the corner
[3:27:48.360 --> 3:27:53.160]  on the info war people are listening and paying attention like they never had before and so i
[3:27:53.160 --> 3:27:56.520]  know that things are getting dark things are getting bad this government's illegitimate and
[3:27:56.520 --> 3:28:01.640]  criminal i know that uh... i i i don't want to see things flare up into violence because
[3:28:01.640 --> 3:28:06.600]  that escalates things but i certainly don't blame people that defend themselves or can't be pushed
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:13.720]  anymore and uh... so i i i certainly hear what you're saying sir i understand uh... the mindset
[3:28:13.720 --> 3:28:18.680]  that you've got and i understand the feeling of heaven being cornered and you just he can't
[3:28:18.680 --> 3:28:23.480]  you know you you you've got some great ancestors you know this country's a great nation our forebears
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:28.840]  were amazing there's every historian from foreign countries said that and we're a shadow of what we
[3:28:28.840 --> 3:28:33.080]  were but you know what that shadow is still greater than most people on this planet and we are going
[3:28:33.080 --> 3:28:37.880]  to kick the new old orders but my job is to wake up as many people as i can and then let the chips
[3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:44.680]  fall where they may okay and that's why i'm asking can you have more militia leaders on the radio
[3:28:44.680 --> 3:28:48.840]  listen i appreciate your call i mean i play militia people on the air i've i've interviewed them i
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:55.800]  even told uh... trade this week to set up some more people and uh... the problem is that's a
[3:28:57.720 --> 3:29:01.320]  recommending people go get into an organized militia those are infiltrated those are being
[3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:05.960]  watched that's a very dangerous thing for me to recommend people get involved in i recommend you
[3:29:05.960 --> 3:29:11.560]  have a shooting club with the people you trust and you train in that shooting club to defend the
[3:29:11.560 --> 3:29:17.800]  republic that's what i recommend okay we'll be right back stay with me you know what i'm gonna
[3:29:17.800 --> 3:29:25.480]  skip this break too we're on the march the empire is on the run on the run alex jones and the gcm
[3:29:25.480 --> 3:29:30.760]  okay john i'm gonna skip this break too i'm gonna take the talk to collars i'm gonna talk to uh...
[3:29:30.760 --> 3:29:33.560]  rod in oregon roger on the air go ahead
[3:29:36.680 --> 3:29:43.400]  john you there my friend yep rod you there rod's not there hello yes rod go ahead hey how you doing
[3:29:43.400 --> 3:29:49.720]  alex good right hey um correct me if i'm wrong here but you know with all the stuff that's going
[3:29:49.720 --> 3:29:54.920]  on i mean it's just so blatant in our face what's going on and and people that are awake and what's
[3:29:54.920 --> 3:30:00.200]  wrong with implanting babies and cows it's it's you're you're you're you're you don't like it's
[3:30:00.200 --> 3:30:05.560]  you're weird you don't like eating gmo food they admits killing everybody you're buzz you don't
[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:09.960]  like i'm putting mercury lead in arsenic and fluoride in the water knowing it kills you
[3:30:09.960 --> 3:30:15.720]  why me you're some kind of a man i mean what's wrong what don't you love the government
[3:30:17.640 --> 3:30:22.120]  well in any case you know what i was going to bring to the table here basically
[3:30:22.120 --> 3:30:28.360]  is you know we always hear about writing congress and and our and uh the constituents and all this
[3:30:28.360 --> 3:30:34.920]  stuff and you know i may be wrong but it seems to me that what we have for a congress not everybody
[3:30:34.920 --> 3:30:40.040]  but i would probably say 98 percent of them they're nothing but a bunch of spineless self-serving
[3:30:40.040 --> 3:30:45.720]  uh cowards that are just there to give people the illusion that they have some voice in what's
[3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:50.600]  going on in this country in this plan yeah no no it's a it's a curtain it's something they project
[3:30:50.600 --> 3:30:55.000]  the lion you know it's not really the enemies behind the curtain they're in the projection booth
[3:30:55.000 --> 3:31:00.680]  above projecting onto the curtain and so while we fight with the curtain all day and you know fight
[3:31:00.680 --> 3:31:06.040]  with the hologram uh the real government is just poisoning everything exterminating testing soft
[3:31:06.040 --> 3:31:11.240]  kill weapons on the public breaking down the family putting in a military control grid stealing
[3:31:11.240 --> 3:31:17.480]  everything yeah well i i think what ron paul had to say was very powerful he's talking about the
[3:31:17.480 --> 3:31:23.320]  grand jury and you know we already know about the voting for the president and all that stuff
[3:31:23.320 --> 3:31:28.920]  it's such a big dog and pony show it's unbelievable but when you deal with the jury or the grand jury
[3:31:28.920 --> 3:31:35.240]  the people need to realize what we're never taught anyway is the power of one vote in that kind of a
[3:31:35.240 --> 3:31:40.920]  setting and it seems to me that he hit the nail on the head of if people could get together enough
[3:31:40.920 --> 3:31:45.720]  and start putting these grand juries together to start can absolutely and we know that the
[3:31:45.720 --> 3:31:50.920]  tread of the treasury is violating federal law and a conflict of interest giving himself money
[3:31:50.920 --> 3:31:56.600]  giving his company millions of dollars we know the fed the chairman and others changed the rules
[3:31:56.600 --> 3:32:02.280]  the private fed through the treasury the government treasury uh to where they could package uh crap
[3:32:02.280 --> 3:32:08.040]  and uh sell it as securities we know they've committed just millions of crimes every transactions
[3:32:08.040 --> 3:32:12.760]  a crime on the books and they didn't just change the rules they also went further and so uh that's
[3:32:12.760 --> 3:32:16.680]  why we put an article out we had the congressman on we asked the tough question knowing what he'd
[3:32:16.680 --> 3:32:21.720]  say and we put the article out and so first the public has to know their criminals and should
[3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:25.640]  be criminally charged so they can then move to that i appreciate your call we're gonna go back
[3:32:25.640 --> 3:32:29.000]  to the full audience now right here at the gcm radio network
[3:32:34.520 --> 3:32:39.720]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:32:42.920 --> 3:32:47.000]  coming for the new oral order throwing ourselves against the juggernaut machinery
[3:32:47.000 --> 3:32:53.160]  coming up the treads climbing up on the turret blowing the lid off and throwing in truth bomb
[3:32:53.160 --> 3:32:58.840]  of granados into the enemy sanctums watching smoke and fire belch out of their machinery
[3:32:59.800 --> 3:33:05.480]  discrediting and smashing their frontline propagandas crawling all over them intensifying
[3:33:06.440 --> 3:33:13.640]  opening the prison gates and releasing the people unlocking their minds they call it viral spread
[3:33:13.640 --> 3:33:19.880]  in the info war and we certainly are planting viral bombs that release liberty and freedom
[3:33:19.880 --> 3:33:27.160]  and then we self replicate and create more the enemy already is lost and they know it
[3:33:30.440 --> 3:33:34.120]  thanks to all your incredible work i don't know how i'll end up personally
[3:33:35.400 --> 3:33:40.520]  i'm just a truth virus that was way down the line and was injected into some good tissue and
[3:33:40.520 --> 3:33:47.080]  mass produced uh the good stuff and now i see many generations of our operation out there
[3:33:47.080 --> 3:33:52.920]  from the point i met looking out over the vista looking out over the plateau looking out at the
[3:33:52.920 --> 3:34:01.160]  valleys and hills beyond me as the enemy force burns as they're exposed it is absolutely amazing
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:08.440]  to see it it is history it is destiny and i am so honored to be just a little part of this
[3:34:08.440 --> 3:34:15.640]  it is you that sets the freedom free it is you by taking action i want to get into the financial

[3:34:26.520 --> 3:34:31.960]  into higher gods but they have to face their creator and give an accounting for every thought
[3:34:31.960 --> 3:34:37.160]  every word and every deed and the listeners should never forget that white throne judgment
[3:34:37.160 --> 3:34:42.120]  that's a that's waiting for these people that's my comment my question is you said something during
[3:34:42.120 --> 3:34:46.600]  the interview with cindy and then you kind of glossed over it um expand upon it you said that

[3:34:52.120 --> 3:34:57.160]  and they have spanish speakers that uh you know take them in for really dangerous stuff they would
[3:34:57.160 --> 3:35:02.120]  do it on foster kids and they still do but they got in trouble killing foster kids and and there's
[3:35:02.120 --> 3:35:06.520]  drug tests on the illegals the illegals you come and sign up for it because you know they want 10
[3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:10.920]  grand five grand four grand three grand the really bad ones are like 10 grand might be a month long

[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:27.000]  thank you very much alex you bet but you'll never hear of the mexican leaders the black leaders
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:33.400]  the white leaders they won't warn their people they'll just flap a mexican flag in their face and
[3:35:33.400 --> 3:35:38.440]  ha ha ha we're gonna get the gringo and they tell the gringos ha ha we're gonna get the blacks vote
[3:35:38.440 --> 3:35:42.040]  for john mccain when they're attacking all of us ladies and gentlemen
[3:35:45.560 --> 3:35:48.920]  you know talking to synthy earlier about people getting sick at these labs and all the weird
[3:35:48.920 --> 3:35:54.680]  stuff that goes on yes like jail guards all over the country doing bio test with the doctors um
[3:35:55.480 --> 3:35:58.520]  on the prisoners and then the and then the jail guards get sick
[3:35:59.160 --> 3:36:03.400]  and die in some cases i mean that happened at huntsville that ended up in local paper their
[3:36:03.400 --> 3:36:08.600]  families got sick and died it didn't funny the jail guards thought it was funny
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:14.840]  testing stuff on whole cell blocks but see it got you too that's how it works
[3:36:16.920 --> 3:36:21.320]  you don't have to wait till the white throne judgment to be judged you'll be judged in this life
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:27.800]  you better know that let me tell you man i do not do anything immoral sometimes i do something
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:33.240]  immoral and catch myself and then don't just repent i try to rectify it i mean i i know man
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:39.480]  i'm like i god fearing doesn't mean you're some cowardly person hiding under a toadstool
[3:36:39.480 --> 3:36:45.480]  afraid of shadows god fearing means you fear god's law god fearing means you know you break
[3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:53.560]  laws you pay and you pay in this life and you and by the way the law is written on your heart
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:55.880]  you know when something's wrong and you know when something's good
[3:36:55.880 --> 3:37:05.400]  i don't want to start preaching to people i just feel sorry for those that are into wickedness
[3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:08.680]  and don't even know it because they think they found power they think they found enlightenment
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:14.040]  they think they found valhalla and they have it they have found a fraud they are stunted
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:19.000]  and i don't even hate my enemies anymore and enemies of humanity i just it's disgusting
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:26.760]  it's like looking at a pile of crap on the ground i don't particularly want to look at it and i watch
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:33.720]  the the the the wicked revel in their evil and they're reveling in their own destruction it is

[3:38:18.440 --> 3:38:24.760]  spamming and i don't care if somebody goes into a message board and says i have a website it's cool
[3:38:24.760 --> 3:38:30.040]  check it out but but when it's in every post i mean here's an example and here's an example

[3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:21.640]  when they have their family come over and do stuff to our cars out here in the parking lot
[3:42:21.640 --> 3:42:27.720]  you know i mean it's and i and i hold back i i i you know i you have no idea and i don't feel
[3:42:27.720 --> 3:42:34.840]  sorry for myself this is what i asked for this is what i signed up for uh and uh i don't even
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:39.160]  people thanking me for what i do because how could i not know this and not fight with everything i've
[3:42:39.160 --> 3:42:53.960]  got i uh shrink to know what the latest thing will be uh but uh it's just incredible the worst
[3:42:53.960 --> 3:42:59.400]  thing is people that attack you also get very ingenious about it like they'll attack you
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:03.240]  but then make it that it's an attack on themselves and just watch all these fools buy it
[3:43:03.240 --> 3:43:07.880]  but it doesn't matter i know the truth and that's what matters and again this is a
[3:43:07.880 --> 3:43:14.760]  cult of personality society it's a celebrity driven society and i am a celebrity and um
[3:43:14.760 --> 3:43:25.720]  um it's a it's a responsibility and uh it's got more negatives and it has positive as i'll tell
[3:43:25.720 --> 3:43:32.760]  you that look you know what i i don't have time to take any more calls from um from a bunch of
[3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:35.560]  other people because we're just out of time and i've got to cover the financial news i covered a

[3:43:59.880 --> 3:44:04.520]  of ron paul supporters a lot of them that think that there's no martial law there's no fema camps
[3:44:04.520 --> 3:44:08.600]  you know they're kind of mainline republicans they need to see this because this will wake them up
[3:44:08.600 --> 3:44:17.640]  uh you know to a great deal of people very important story there uh some of the other

[3:45:44.360 --> 3:45:47.720]  so so so they engineer it and then they say give us total power
[3:45:49.240 --> 3:45:53.960]  we're out to now a professor of business at yale served on policy planning staffer kissinger during
[3:45:53.960 --> 3:45:57.160]  the time of secretary of state yale served in white house council on international economic
[3:45:57.160 --> 3:46:00.200]  policy under nixon administration and wanted to become the undersecretary of commerce and
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:04.120]  international trade under bill clinton and there's a whole bunch of them calling for a global economic
[3:46:04.120 --> 3:46:11.240]  order and a system and uh just absolutely out of control that story also up on prison planet dot
[3:46:11.240 --> 3:46:23.160]  com uh with the markets right now they've been going up and down all day long and the biggest bank
[3:46:23.160 --> 3:46:29.720]  in u.s history one of the five largest has now gone under we we broke the record a few weeks ago
[3:46:29.720 --> 3:46:35.240]  a few a few weeks ago of the then biggest bank in u.s history to go under wall moon has now dwarfed
[3:46:35.240 --> 3:46:42.120]  that last night and today watchman a mutual is a c sold off to jp morgan largest failure
[3:46:42.120 --> 3:46:50.440]  and u.s banking history and again it's been taken over by jp morgan chase which the federal
[3:46:50.440 --> 3:46:56.040]  government regulators made it be handed over to the main stockholder in the private federal
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:47:00.120]  reserve so this is an orchestrated takeover and now they're set to give the treasury with the
[3:47:00.120 --> 3:47:07.160]  federal reserve the private federal reserve above government power and no oversight it states that
[3:47:09.480 --> 3:47:14.440]  and um house gop will oppose any bailout of wall street
[3:47:14.440 --> 3:47:24.840]  just just incredible so so it's only one point nine billion they're saying and failed assets of
[3:47:24.840 --> 3:47:32.280]  hundreds of billions at washington mutual but the government is going to bail out jp morgan
[3:47:32.280 --> 3:47:36.520]  just to take over all of its assets i mean you've got something worth hundreds and hundreds of
[3:47:36.520 --> 3:47:41.720]  billions and they just get it for almost nothing it's just handed over i mean see what's happening
[3:47:41.720 --> 3:47:47.320]  these these are just bank robberies you've got the private bankers a key coterie an inner circle
[3:47:47.320 --> 3:47:51.960]  controlling the federal reserve and the treasury and they're just grabbing and snatching with their
[3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:58.760]  regulators unto themselves as they get bigger in front of everyone and the process the united
[3:47:58.760 --> 3:48:04.040]  states credits being destroyed you know Reuters reporting that germany japan china talking about
[3:48:04.040 --> 3:48:09.560]  pulling out china saying telling its banks don't give any more loans to the u.s companies or u.s
[3:48:09.560 --> 3:48:14.600]  banks it's imploding but they don't care that's the plan and as things get even worse it's a fire
[3:48:14.600 --> 3:48:18.760]  sale they could buy it up for pennies on the dollar house republicans pledge to work out an
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:23.000]  agreement on some kind of financial rescue plan but vowed to oppose any proposal bailout of wall
[3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:29.160]  street america's on the edge of an economic crisis hospital leader bonner said we believe congress
[3:48:29.160 --> 3:48:33.800]  it needs to act it needs that quickly but we will not agree to bail the shell and the sales
[3:48:33.800 --> 3:48:38.200]  taxpayers out to wall street but then you watch their plan will they're just playing the part of
[3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:42.280]  that they're not you watch that by next week i want to go to ted anderson for the balance of the
[3:48:42.280 --> 3:48:47.560]  transmission and go through some more financial news with him you know ted people would think you
[3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:51.800]  and i'd be happy right now being right about gold exploding in prices over a hundred something
[3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:55.480]  bucks the last week and we'd be right about all these banks we're going to fail and all this
[3:48:55.480 --> 3:49:01.640]  happening over the years i'm not happy i'm sick i'm upset i'm disgusted i'm freaked out tell us
[3:49:01.640 --> 3:49:05.560]  you've been doing some economic research what's going on right now ted anderson well again today
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:10.280]  is a banner day as far as failures are concerned national city corp with covia and you already
[3:49:10.280 --> 3:49:15.480]  mentioned washington mutual how more yet right more fail today is that wonderful oh yeah that
[3:49:15.480 --> 3:49:19.880]  that it's like it's like a domino right now they're just falling right and left and of course
[3:49:19.880 --> 3:49:23.480]  then the government's going in and they're having this argument as to whether or not we
[3:49:23.480 --> 3:49:27.800]  should put seven hundred billion dollars of newly printed money and it's really five trillion
[3:49:27.800 --> 3:49:31.640]  bluebird oh yeah there's no question about it alex is going to be way bigger than seven hundred
[3:49:31.640 --> 3:49:35.960]  billion and the national debt right now is only nine trillion seven hundred billion is close to
[3:49:35.960 --> 3:49:41.320]  one trillion that's more than ten percent of the entire national debt at this time you get to five
[3:49:41.320 --> 3:49:46.360]  trillion dollars you're increasing the money supply by by fifty percent what do you think is
[3:49:46.360 --> 3:49:50.600]  going to happen to the value of the money you have it's just going to go right into the floor
[3:49:50.600 --> 3:49:57.320]  uh... it's it's it's utter it's other it's insanity and uh... and it isn't it's good if they pass
[3:49:57.320 --> 3:50:01.320]  this thing it's going to hurt us if they don't pass it it's going to hurt us we just have trouble
[3:50:01.320 --> 3:50:04.920]  there's no question about it right now you gotta be getting involved in the gold and silver market
[3:50:05.480 --> 3:50:11.640]  get away from the paper at this time get away from the paper i can't say it enough get away
[3:50:11.640 --> 3:50:17.080]  from paper it's gonna hurt you gonna get killed well i can't imagine gold's up three dollars and
[3:50:17.080 --> 3:50:22.760]  ninety cents from yesterday uh... a new plateau of right up close to nine hundred and last week
[3:50:22.760 --> 3:50:27.720]  i don't know how anyone out there would not move away from paper so fast i mean it should be speedy
[3:50:27.720 --> 3:50:32.840]  gonzalez we're gonna skip this break more than seven let's go back to ted here for the info wars
[3:50:32.840 --> 3:50:37.240]  audience water and did you know that you have a john can we cut that feed yeah hey ted we're gonna
[3:50:37.240 --> 3:50:41.160]  come back to the full audience three minutes but i don't want to waste any time with you right now
[3:50:41.720 --> 3:50:46.680]  um... this is in the summer going into the fall normally a bad time for metals
[3:50:46.680 --> 3:50:51.800]  but we see it going up over a hundred bucks uh... about a hundred and ten bucks in the last week
[3:50:52.360 --> 3:50:56.360]  uh... water i know i'm reading most analysts are saying it's going to go up in the next few months
[3:50:56.360 --> 3:51:01.800]  even more i see this is a major buying opportunity right now for people before it really goes up i
[3:51:01.800 --> 3:51:05.880]  know that's what i'm treating it as well you know alex of course it's a major buying opportunity
[3:51:05.880 --> 3:51:11.400]  first of all the gold and silver prices comparatively to work inflation has taken the dollar up to
[3:51:11.400 --> 3:51:16.440]  this point are suppressed i mean silver was at fifty dollars an ounce right now silver is
[3:51:16.440 --> 3:51:20.440]  sitting on the sketch of that price for a quick year went to thirteen dollars and sixty nine
[3:51:20.440 --> 3:51:25.880]  cents today so it's up over three and a half dollars the last week yes and and but the thing
[3:51:25.880 --> 3:51:30.280]  about it is compared to fifty bucks of nineteen eighties dollars obviously the fifty and nineteen
[3:51:30.280 --> 3:51:34.600]  eighty is not worth what maybe a hundred and fifty that's right silver is previous high
[3:51:34.600 --> 3:51:39.160]  suppressed suppressed suppressed and that no gold i mean even bloomberg is saying five
[3:51:39.160 --> 3:51:43.640]  thousand dollar gold just inflation adjusted and these guys are stock people they're not
[3:51:43.640 --> 3:51:49.640]  gold and silver bugs and and they're saying we're also having shortages in metals i've got a whole
[3:51:49.640 --> 3:51:55.160]  string of articles i'm looking up here also gold shares are up all over the place which shows
[3:51:55.160 --> 3:51:59.320]  that the market knows that suckers only going up well that's right and you're talking about the
[3:51:59.320 --> 3:52:02.680]  foreigners trying to get away from the united states dollar they're trying to sell it you know
[3:52:02.680 --> 3:52:07.320]  they've got portfolios up to their neck i mean china right now sitting on one point three trillion
[3:52:07.320 --> 3:52:14.440]  dollars worth of u.s currency in the form of u.s government bonds and in t-bills t-notes and and
[3:52:14.440 --> 3:52:19.400]  just plain old corporate debt that they just want to get out of not to mention the fact that they
[3:52:19.400 --> 3:52:24.680]  have it in green back there's also sovereign wealth private wealth is pouring into raw mines
[3:52:24.680 --> 3:52:30.200]  into the gold and silver stocks platinum stocks i'm looking at kitko right now it is a frenzy
[3:52:30.200 --> 3:52:36.280]  this looks like major positioning from the market uh... in expectation of uh... of this commodity
[3:52:36.280 --> 3:52:41.000]  and this whole group of commodities only going up to what's your take all the right now any
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:45.160]  commodity is going to go up but gold and silver happens to be that liquid commodity you can take
[3:52:45.160 --> 3:52:49.320]  anywhere in the united states or anywhere across the world no matter what government is doing what
[3:52:49.320 --> 3:52:54.440]  uh... people have been using gold and silver and trade for commerce for six thousand plus years
[3:52:54.440 --> 3:52:59.400]  and there's absolutely when you look at paper and you look what's going on you look at all these
[3:52:59.400 --> 3:53:03.160]  institutions that are failing and you know and there and there's a reason why they're going to
[3:53:03.160 --> 3:53:07.640]  the government right now for a bailout because they're there they're watching their ship sink
[3:53:07.640 --> 3:53:12.200]  ted what are the futures shelling i'm looking around here not seeing those the futures market
[3:53:12.200 --> 3:53:16.200]  right now i mean i haven't i haven't looked at the volume today but the obviously the futures
[3:53:16.200 --> 3:53:20.520]  and gold i mean that's what you're looking at when you look at spot gold when you see a manipulation
[3:53:20.520 --> 3:53:24.920]  of the price going down it means that people are selling short positions into the marketplace
[3:53:24.920 --> 3:53:46.920]  you know they're covering that with the state that we're going back to the full audience here we go
[3:53:48.120 --> 3:53:52.520]  all right final segmented anderson again i've been bringing him up every day in the last week or so
[3:53:52.520 --> 3:53:59.240]  because i believe in golden silver i know it's way undervalued artificially suppressed but it's
[3:53:59.240 --> 3:54:04.520]  still gone up over a hundred and ten bucks in the last week and a half as we go into this winter
[3:54:04.520 --> 3:54:09.320]  no matter where these bailouts go it signals the death of the dollar what the elites doing
[3:54:09.320 --> 3:54:17.160]  signals that uh... global hyperinflation coupled with uh... a real economy depression
[3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:22.120]  that is you got prices going up and people not selling things
[3:54:22.120 --> 3:54:25.800]  uh... the total manipulation they didn't believe you could have stuck flesh until the 70s the
[3:54:25.800 --> 3:54:30.520]  economists that said it didn't exist they didn't make up a word for it only in this lala land
[3:54:30.520 --> 3:54:36.040]  because this is not a free market uh... ted give people the golden silver offer of the day that
[3:54:36.040 --> 3:54:40.200]  you're going to be able to hold throughout the weekend for people to call all right here's what
[3:54:40.200 --> 3:54:43.560]  i'm going to do throughout this whole weekend i don't care where the price of gold goes in the
[3:54:43.560 --> 3:54:47.320]  aftermarket i'm going to hold these prices i suggest that you take advantage of them
[3:54:47.880 --> 3:54:52.360]  right now i still have the british sovereign it's 241 golds up today that was the same price i offered
[3:54:52.360 --> 3:54:58.360]  them for yesterday i also have the frank coin they're at out there at 196 again that's the frank
[3:54:58.360 --> 3:55:03.880]  coin that was made in france belgium uh... switzerland those are the ones that were traded in europe
[3:55:03.880 --> 3:55:10.440]  very common coin very good to be had to have for uh... for trade commerce silver again i can't say it
[3:55:10.440 --> 3:55:15.400]  enough the walking liberties are gone there are still some dimes available i would suggest those
[3:55:15.400 --> 3:55:22.280]  at sixteen hundred per one hundred dollars face value uh... alex the the when you see the manipulation
[3:55:22.280 --> 3:55:26.840]  when you see the price of gold and silver dropping it's because there's the the futures market is
[3:55:26.840 --> 3:55:32.040]  being sold but the physical market that the futures market is all paper and it's all leverage but
[3:55:32.040 --> 3:55:36.280]  the physical market itself when people are buying this gold and silver they buy it and they take
[3:55:36.280 --> 3:55:41.880]  delivery and they don't sell it again the supplies are drying up you can look anywhere
[3:55:41.880 --> 3:55:46.600]  that's drying up and i'd suggest that you get involved while you're still can you're saying
[3:55:46.600 --> 3:55:51.000]  that you believe in gold and silver what i can you know that the people are finally realizing
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:57.560]  the fairy tale that of that's been sold to them that actual paper is represents real wealth it
[3:55:57.560 --> 3:56:02.840]  doesn't the united states dollar only has value because at one time it was backed by gold and
[3:56:02.840 --> 3:56:10.200]  silver in nineteen seventy one richard nexon separated the u.s. dollar from gold entirely
[3:56:10.200 --> 3:56:15.080]  and that way they could devalue it and try to keep that secret it's been the policy going back to
[3:56:15.080 --> 3:56:20.120]  valker and before to keep it secret ted give them the toll free number well what's the deal on
[3:56:20.120 --> 3:56:24.920]  silver today right now best thing on silver there's hands down the dimes are the best thing
[3:56:24.920 --> 3:56:28.760]  at silver you can get into right now and you're having trouble getting dollars and half dollars
[3:56:28.760 --> 3:56:34.120]  so you can only offer the great deal now on dimes i mean you're that's running out silver dollars
[3:56:34.120 --> 3:56:38.360]  are running up there on twenty bucks a piece i can get you into the same amount of silver for
[3:56:38.360 --> 3:56:42.760]  for sixteen dollars do you have dollars at the higher price if folks want them sure if you want
[3:56:42.760 --> 3:56:46.520]  them if you want silver dollars i do have the dimes the dollars tell them alex jones sent you

[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:32.280]  ted do you agree that that's going to be the case oh yeah there's no question about it because
