[00:00.000 --> 00:17.600]  before America can be great again she must be free again you're listening to
[00:17.600 --> 00:26.520]  the Alex Jones show I've got to give credit where credit to do the mainstream
[00:26.520 --> 00:29.480]  media will attack Hannity for this but doesn't matter that'll just make him have
[00:29.480 --> 00:34.440]  more viewers and more supporters though news corps has been very close to
[00:34.440 --> 00:39.080]  firing him I talked to witnesses a month ago when the reports came out that he
[00:39.080 --> 00:42.320]  was going to be fired who talked to Hannity at Fox News where he'd been
[00:42.320 --> 00:46.320]  chewed out for hours by the general counsel and they had said you keep you
[00:46.320 --> 00:50.200]  know doing what you're doing you're fired but he has so much support and it's
[00:50.200 --> 00:55.120]  so obvious that Fox News is sinking after the Democrat coup there that they
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.520]  have not gotten rid of him yet but the fact is I know from the White House that
[01:00.520 --> 01:05.320]  no one in media talks to President Trump more than Sean Hannity Sean Hannity
[01:05.320 --> 01:10.480]  talks to President Trump two or three times a day sometimes at length and I'll
[01:10.480 --> 01:17.840]  just tell you right now Sean Hannity is currently the main leader of the
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.360]  resistance against the globalist outside of Trump and then of course myself but
[01:23.360 --> 01:27.440]  I am more grassroots and you know I'm more frontline being demonized being
[01:27.440 --> 01:31.800]  attacked it's my job to get the intel out to take the main attack to draw the
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.160]  enemy fire so that we understand exactly what we're dealing with though
[01:36.160 --> 01:39.600]  what if credit were credits do he has the most courage of anybody in the media
[01:39.600 --> 01:48.280]  and his heads on the chopping block because of it but he's held on and then
[01:48.280 --> 01:53.120]  on Tuesday night he came out and the Washington Post you know obviously
[01:53.120 --> 01:58.280]  pointed this out word-for-word quoted what I've said but he wasn't
[01:58.280 --> 02:03.880]  plagiarizing me headline Fox News Sean Hannity is encroaching on Alex Jones
[02:03.880 --> 02:11.320]  territory he was quoting what the Defense Department and the President is
[02:11.320 --> 02:16.600]  telling him because what I've told you is what's happening so Hannity's not even
[02:16.600 --> 02:20.680]  getting this from me he's getting this from reality you know we all go to the
[02:20.680 --> 02:24.760]  same Super Bowl game and watch the New England Patriots win last year we we
[02:24.760 --> 02:30.160]  we weren't plagiarizing each other we saw the same thing so listen to me very
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.520]  very carefully the number one issue we've got to expose is the Democrat plan
[02:35.520 --> 02:41.560]  to overthrow Trump he's just won four special elections he's really above 60
[02:41.560 --> 02:45.560]  in the Gallup polls if you look at their margin of error how they over sample
[02:45.560 --> 02:51.080]  Democrats a lot of incredible things are happening right now and they know
[02:51.080 --> 02:55.120]  they're dying as a party they know globalism is dying so they're very
[02:55.120 --> 02:59.480]  dangerous they're very cornered right now and the Washington Post saying Sean
[02:59.480 --> 03:04.200]  Hannity should be fired for this because this is insane and he's making stuff up
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.720]  ladies and gentlemen we have so much proof of the Democrats saying overthrow
[03:08.720 --> 03:14.080]  Trump you COG killing killer supporters cancel the last election remove the
[03:14.080 --> 03:18.280]  Republicans that were elected in the last 2016 election I mean I've got the
[03:18.280 --> 03:21.920]  mainstream articles here where they're pushing it in the New Yorker magazine
[03:21.920 --> 03:26.000]  Atlantic Monthly Financial Times New York Times so we're gonna go over all
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.200]  that today and break this down but first here's Sean Hannity also tonight a
[03:32.200 --> 03:37.280]  soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.600]  to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected
[03:42.600 --> 03:47.560]  president from office sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now
[03:47.560 --> 03:52.560]  in my mind a clear and present danger that is tonight's very important opening
[03:52.560 --> 03:58.760]  monologue so here in America we're at a turning point tonight with forces now
[03:58.760 --> 04:02.360]  forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office it's that
[04:02.360 --> 04:07.200]  serious now here are the five dangers we are facing especially the president one
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.440]  you've got the destroy Trump media that has been lying to you now provable
[04:12.440 --> 04:18.320]  lies for 11 months nonstop Trump Russia collusion black helicopter theories no
[04:18.320 --> 04:22.480]  evidence whatsoever to you've got what I've been calling the deep state
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.160]  selectively leaking information to damage the president and anyone
[04:27.160 --> 04:32.520]  associated with him three special counsel Muller's investigation mission creep
[04:32.520 --> 04:36.680]  I've been telling you about well it's now turned into an out of control what is a
[04:36.680 --> 04:42.400]  political witch hunt it needs to be stopped for all this manufactured turmoil
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.320]  putting president Trump's agenda in jeopardy which ends up directly
[04:46.320 --> 04:50.960]  impacting every one of you out there the American people and five this effort
[04:50.960 --> 04:55.160]  to override the will of the American people change the results of a
[04:55.160 --> 04:59.360]  presidential election is now creating a national security will be back stay with
[04:59.360 --> 05:04.080]  us left us in Europe carried out 27 terror attacks in 2016 which debunks a
[05:04.080 --> 05:07.240]  claim that conservatives and libertarians represent a bigger extremist
[05:07.240 --> 05:11.680]  threat over 140 terrorist attacks occurred in Europe last year and 27 of them
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.400]  were blamed on leftist in comparison just one right-wing terror attack was
[05:15.400 --> 05:18.640]  recorded for the entire year 13 attacks were blamed on jihadis while the
[05:18.640 --> 05:22.600]  majority of the attacks nearly 100 were by separatist movements terrorist
[05:22.600 --> 05:26.800]  attacks which led to deaths and injuries are almost exclusively Islamic and gets
[05:26.800 --> 05:31.440]  to advocates open borders and radical Islam is the left the statistics
[05:31.440 --> 05:34.400]  disprove the narrative that conservatives and libertarians represent a
[05:34.400 --> 05:37.360]  major terrorist threat a claim the major media was pushing up through the
[05:37.360 --> 05:40.880]  recent attack on Muslims near mosque in London the study came from Europe hold
[05:40.880 --> 05:44.200]  law enforcement agency of the European Union tasked with combating organized
[05:44.200 --> 05:47.680]  crime and terrorism additionally terror experts in the US are also warning that
[05:47.680 --> 05:51.600]  left-wing terror represents a far bigger concern than ever before which isn't
[05:51.600 --> 05:54.560]  surprising given how the establishment keeps promoting violence against

[08:30.880 --> 08:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen this is undoubtedly right now June 22nd 2017 the most
[08:41.000 --> 08:51.440]  important broadcast I have ever given in 22 years. No doubt over the years it's
[08:51.440 --> 08:55.200]  probably been 30 40 times I've said that because the world's getting more intense
[08:55.200 --> 09:04.200]  more is happening but now now ladies and gentlemen undoubtedly we know for sure
[09:04.200 --> 09:09.920]  the globalist plan we know for certain how horrible it is we know analytically
[09:09.920 --> 09:20.360]  culturally historically spiritually financially metaphysically just how
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.960]  dangerous this existential clear and present danger is. That is the term that
[09:26.960 --> 09:34.320]  I have the brought back into vogue that has now been picked up by a lot of
[09:34.320 --> 09:39.200]  serious people at the Pentagon and also that are left in mainstream media that
[09:39.200 --> 09:43.600]  are actually trying to save the country because currently there is a soft
[09:43.600 --> 09:54.160]  coup operating towards a hot coup and preparing the public mind for the
[09:54.160 --> 09:58.160]  overthrow of President Trump the canceling of the 2016 election and then
[09:58.160 --> 10:03.760]  most of the Republicans elected under the 2016 election will basically be
[10:03.760 --> 10:07.960]  removed from office new special elections will be held overseen by the
[10:07.960 --> 10:13.160]  Department of Homeland Security which will then fully federalize all 50 states
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.840]  now many of you who are tuning in go yes you've been saying this since the
[10:17.840 --> 10:22.280]  election since Obama signed an executive order setting that up and Trump's
[10:22.280 --> 10:28.040]  but unable to remove the bureaucracy that still has that in place you have
[10:28.040 --> 10:34.680]  all 50 state attorney generals sending letters three months ago to Congress and
[10:34.680 --> 10:39.480]  to the president and to the other branches of government saying this is
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.560]  outrageous you can't federalize all 50 state elections it violates the Federal
[10:44.560 --> 10:51.200]  Clause it violates the Constitution this is an emergency what's going on
[10:52.360 --> 11:00.920]  this is unprecedented ladies and gentlemen this is a soft coup that is
[11:00.920 --> 11:05.960]  meant to then exponentially as the ambient temperatures turned up escalated
[11:05.960 --> 11:12.200]  into a civil emergency martial law the assassination of Trump you're not gonna
[11:12.200 --> 11:18.760]  let him live not going to defend himself and then a pair of military move by
[11:18.760 --> 11:24.960]  fifth columns inside the intelligence agencies the media government against
[11:24.960 --> 11:29.560]  the main target leadership of the resistance and you can bet your bottom
[11:29.560 --> 11:35.440]  dollar it's Donald Trump it's Ron Paul it's Rand Paul it's Sean Hannity it's
[11:35.440 --> 11:43.440]  Alex Jones it's Rush Limbaugh it's Matt Drudge that list of names are deader
[11:43.440 --> 11:48.400]  than a hammer in the first hours of this if they launch it so everybody should
[11:48.400 --> 11:51.840]  have their security contingencies ready and should know that you're all
[11:51.840 --> 11:58.720]  personally in your Alamo positions or your 300 positions whatever you want to
[11:58.720 --> 12:03.560]  call it because we have to make that stand as long as possible if they move
[12:03.560 --> 12:09.120]  this is not a joke folks this is not a game they'll set a nuke off in DC if they
[12:09.120 --> 12:17.320]  have to to bring in this they're not going to be dug out not a fight now
[12:17.320 --> 12:23.080]  colonel Schaefer who's been involved in black ops the highest level but he's
[12:23.080 --> 12:26.000]  been a whistleblower exposing our government working with radical Islam
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.280]  going back to the year 2000 he's a contributor to Fox News he also works
[12:31.280 --> 12:36.360]  with the London group he is an expert on terrorism through other sources I have
[12:36.360 --> 12:39.920]  we knew the terror attacks were coming in London there was an order to stand
[12:39.920 --> 12:45.080]  down he's one of the best sources you can get he's on the broadcast in the last
[12:45.080 --> 12:51.760]  30 minutes of the third hour today he said a month ago on Lou Dobbs Fox
[12:51.760 --> 12:59.200]  business exactly what I've been saying word for word now Sean Hannity has said
[12:59.200 --> 13:05.120]  what I've been warning you of word for word now you understand that it's not
[13:05.120 --> 13:10.240]  about credit to Alex Jones I've reverse engineered the globalist I've reverse
[13:10.240 --> 13:15.720]  engineered other COG operations like Valkyrie in Germany 1944 I have
[13:15.720 --> 13:20.120]  interviewed all the top experts and I'm watching and reading elite publications
[13:20.120 --> 13:24.800]  because something this big they've got to say it out in the open to get people
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.160]  with cold feet lined up thinking well we must be in power we must have a show
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.240]  at this they're hyping themselves up they're jumping up and down like a
[13:34.240 --> 13:37.640]  bunch of warriors getting ready to run down the run down the creek bed and
[13:37.640 --> 13:41.600]  attack the tribe over the next hill they got themselves like a bunch of
[13:41.600 --> 13:44.520]  coyotes when they get ready to go hunting running around yipping and
[13:44.520 --> 13:48.200]  barking and squealing and howling getting all hyped up for the hunt they're
[13:48.200 --> 13:53.600]  running around with war drums ladies and gentlemen in circling us you don't
[13:53.600 --> 13:56.960]  have to believe me you can look out over the edge of the raft and there's big
[13:56.960 --> 14:02.520]  old sharks going around in circles the differences we have the tools to defeat
[14:02.520 --> 14:05.360]  these people they're in the wrong they're a bunch of anti-American
[14:05.360 --> 14:10.240]  anti-free market scum and they thought they had this country and their plans
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.480]  were so bad once Hillary got into shut down the press arrest people have a
[14:14.480 --> 14:17.440]  reign of terror it's all been announced that finally people inside our
[14:17.440 --> 14:21.760]  intelligence agency said this is insane we're not going along with it but they
[14:21.760 --> 14:25.480]  only stopped her from getting in the whole deep state was still there the
[14:25.480 --> 14:30.400]  bottom paid for trader media was all still there and so the Washington Post
[14:30.400 --> 14:34.120]  has a big article saying Fox News's Hannity is encroaching on Alex Jones
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.040]  territory and needs to be fired this is the same Washington Post that got six
[14:39.040 --> 14:45.640]  hundred million dollars in taxpayer money from the CIA last year in the final
[14:45.640 --> 14:51.680]  months of Obama as a panic move six hundred million dollar contract to
[14:51.680 --> 14:59.480]  destroy Trump for one newspaper owned by Bezos six hundred million dollars
[14:59.480 --> 15:03.920]  billions have been spent on the Islamic marches the feminist marches the
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.680]  zombie commie marches that are coming out of the woodwork the cop killing
[15:08.680 --> 15:17.800]  marches all of it make no mistake 100% they're planning a hot coo the soft
[15:17.800 --> 15:23.160]  coos the buildup and they quote me in here using the term clear and present
[15:23.160 --> 15:28.480]  danger that's a term used by the military when you've got to move against
[15:28.480 --> 15:32.640]  something and they make fun of Hannity and myself for using it and say oh my
[15:32.640 --> 15:36.520]  gosh look Hannity's quoting Alex Jones I'm the he's not quoting me this is what
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.760]  the Patriots of the Pentagon are calling it the Patriots left in the CIA are
[15:40.760 --> 15:48.800]  calling it sinister forces quickly aligning a clear and present danger now
[15:48.800 --> 15:54.960]  they think it's discrediting that Hannity's basically quoting me no that's
[15:54.960 --> 15:59.200]  a badge of honor who else will talk about this not even limbaugh the Sean
[15:59.200 --> 16:04.080]  Hannity at drudges linked the stories on it Colonel Schaefer Lou Dobbs a few
[16:04.080 --> 16:08.440]  others ladies and gentlemen we have to get this narrative out to everybody so
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.400]  let me punch you up three of my top researchers and editors Rob do michaels
[16:12.400 --> 16:16.160]  Emmerman of course Aaron McBreen you guys work 12 hours a day usually 14
[16:16.160 --> 16:19.640]  hours a day six days a week you deserve more time off we're trying to hire more
[16:19.640 --> 16:24.040]  good editors and researchers we've got a great crew but I never call you guys in
[16:24.040 --> 16:27.920]  to do this this is so important though I'm just in front of the whole crew the
[16:27.920 --> 16:31.920]  whole audience the listeners other talk show hosts everybody if we don't expose
[16:31.920 --> 16:35.680]  this now they're going to get away with it they want to deny it's happening and
[16:35.680 --> 16:40.840]  say it's insane because if we build opposition to it they're going to fall
[16:40.840 --> 16:46.520]  just like they said oh nobody's trying to steal the nomination from Trump when
[16:46.520 --> 16:55.120]  they admittedly were trying they did one opposition bill just like they have done
[16:55.120 --> 16:58.480]  over and over again or oh we're not gonna try to take electors we're gonna try
[16:58.480 --> 17:02.760]  to take the nomination or or the seating of the president on January 20th
[17:02.760 --> 17:08.240]  which they then tried to do they're in Atlantic Monthly Washington Post New
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.320]  York Times everywhere saying overthrow Trump COG cancel the election
[17:12.320 --> 17:15.800]  they're moving to do it but they want to incrementally build their fake case
[17:15.800 --> 17:20.960]  while they beaver away with moles leaking this info this is a foreign
[17:20.960 --> 17:26.120]  global multinational corporate combine sabotage operation every person
[17:26.120 --> 17:31.920]  involved in this under law deserves to be executed if we end up defeating them
[17:31.920 --> 17:36.080]  and I don't want blood and death they do these are all actual Benedict Arnold's
[17:36.080 --> 17:40.360]  sabotaging America sabotaging our economy admitting they want to kill our

[19:53.320 --> 19:57.440]  attempt they're so upset by this fourth special election that they put more
[19:57.440 --> 20:02.720]  money on than in history the Democratic Party did outspending five to one ten
[20:02.720 --> 20:07.320]  to one on these races I've got the numbers here some cases 15 to one and
[20:07.320 --> 20:11.320]  being annihilated despite election fraud everything else they're doing there is
[20:11.320 --> 20:15.200]  in a realignment there is an awakening the people are sick of these elites
[20:15.200 --> 20:19.320]  they're sick of Nancy Pelosi they're sick of Maxine waters and men we have to
[20:19.320 --> 20:24.160]  make this the big focus because I'm telling you they're planning civil
[20:24.160 --> 20:27.280]  unrest that they're gonna blame on us they're planning the murder of our
[20:27.280 --> 20:32.040]  president to trigger the civil unrest and we've got to stop this we have got to
[20:32.040 --> 20:37.280]  stop this or evacuate the United States because this is it ladies and gentlemen
[20:37.280 --> 20:41.480]  fight or flight I'm staying you guys want to make any comments because I'm
[20:41.480 --> 20:44.560]  about to get into Colonel Shaper's clips and the new Hannity clip well they're
[20:44.560 --> 20:47.800]  calling him to be fired over yeah I just want to say that the you look at the
[20:47.800 --> 20:52.000]  leadership Comey afraid he admitted he's afraid to say stuff Jay Johnson
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.280]  admitted he was afraid to say anything about the Russian clue these people are
[20:55.280 --> 21:00.320]  total pansy wusses and we have to take it to him we have to just meet them on
[21:00.320 --> 21:03.560]  the battlefield they will not stand up when you stand up to them they back down
[21:03.560 --> 21:08.720]  every time so that's all we have to do yeah Alex I just also want to point out
[21:08.720 --> 21:14.800]  that we're seeing a lot of you know they can't have a civil war they need a lot
[21:14.800 --> 21:18.880]  of Americans to join in on this and and what what's happening a lot of Americans
[21:18.880 --> 21:23.120]  are getting radicalized by the Hollywood elite and even by late night
[21:23.120 --> 21:26.720]  television we've run into a lot of people yeah these are the way these are the
[21:26.720 --> 21:30.720]  casualties of brainwashing exactly so there's real news yeah they will
[21:30.720 --> 21:34.920]  consider Stephen Colbert Saturday Night Live that's real news and that's
[21:34.920 --> 21:37.680]  that's where they get their news from so a lot of these people are getting
[21:37.680 --> 21:41.680]  radicalized we've seen the social justice worries we've seen the Antifa
[21:41.680 --> 21:46.160]  protest across the country and they're getting more and more violent and they
[21:46.160 --> 21:49.960]  are attacking Trump supporters right and they're they're targeting Trump
[21:49.960 --> 21:54.240]  supporters so that is going on as well they want civil unrest and then they
[21:54.240 --> 21:58.400]  want to usher order out of chaos that's exactly they're launching maximum
[21:58.400 --> 22:02.200]  revolution maximum violence in preparation just like Soros has done in
[22:02.200 --> 22:07.320]  over 50 other countries with the Arab Spring Ukraine they mean business and
[22:07.320 --> 22:11.440]  Trump thinks he can just have prosperity and you know let Goldman Sachs make
[22:11.440 --> 22:14.680]  record profits they still want to destroy him because they don't want any of the
[22:14.680 --> 22:18.720]  profit going to the people it's total control gentlemen this is just so
[22:18.720 --> 22:23.480]  central the entire crew our reporters everybody our listeners we all have to
[22:23.480 --> 22:27.440]  be involved we have to be very aggressive we have to understand that
[22:27.440 --> 22:31.560]  that that this country and the world is on a knife's edge has ever made anything
[22:31.560 --> 22:35.840]  else well they try to pin all this this violence on conservatives like the
[22:35.840 --> 22:39.560]  attack that happened up in Washington state they tried to say that was a
[22:39.560 --> 22:44.680]  conservative no as a Bernie supporter the recent shooting of the at the baseball
[22:44.680 --> 22:49.400]  field that was a Bernie supporter also yeah there's articles today left-wing
[22:49.400 --> 22:54.960]  attacks are 30 plus to one for right-wing attacks they basically don't exist we
[22:54.960 --> 22:59.080]  we've seen four or five Allah Akbar attacks this week in the US people get
[22:59.080 --> 23:03.760]  stabbed people blowing themselves up in Belgium at the train station we're all
[23:03.760 --> 23:07.380]  just getting conditioned the leftist and Islamic terror while a bunch of
[23:07.380 --> 23:11.760]  mentally ill spoiled brats all run around killing people well like city
[23:11.760 --> 23:15.000]  concert he wants it to be part and parcel of living in a big city they
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.640]  want to condition us that dealing with terrorism is a new part of our daily
[23:18.640 --> 23:23.480]  lives all right gentlemen well and then you got crazy people like like this
[23:23.480 --> 23:27.920]  ska person out in the EU and from Germany says we should bring entire
[23:27.920 --> 23:32.120]  villages into Germany that will increase more migrants coming in because
[23:32.120 --> 23:36.040]  they'll have compatriots it's total lunacy what these people are preaching
[23:36.040 --> 23:38.720]  over and over again and that's what you have to do you have to look at and go
[23:38.720 --> 23:42.680]  this is crazy show people that it's crazy and try to deprogram some of these
[23:42.680 --> 23:46.320]  Hillary bots out there because that's the biggest problem is deprogramming these
[23:46.320 --> 23:48.920]  people because they've gone through a lot they've accepted a lot they're
[23:48.920 --> 23:56.360]  they're taking the I guess the they're taking all this energy and just going
[23:56.360 --> 23:59.480]  out to the regular people and attacking them instead of going to the real seeds
[23:59.480 --> 24:05.320]  of power where we've taken it over halfway if we let them continue what
[24:05.320 --> 24:08.000]  they're doing in the deep state and and Trump's got to do his part to he's got
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.480]  to get rid of these people they got to have mass firings going on and just
[24:11.480 --> 24:14.440]  drain the swamp all at once hey we could do with less government that's right
[24:14.440 --> 24:17.680]  guarantee we can deal with less government gentlemen let's get in there
[24:17.680 --> 24:20.320]  let's start getting these videos out right now the compilations of them
[24:20.320 --> 24:23.560]  calling for violence the overthrow of Trump the overthrow of the election to
[24:23.560 --> 24:27.040]  just back up what Hannity's saying because they're going for his job right
[24:27.040 --> 24:31.280]  now because he is the one person on Fox News that has the courage to cover all
[24:31.280 --> 24:35.600]  this thank you so much gentlemen and I like Tucker Carlson talked to him a
[24:35.600 --> 24:39.960]  couple days ago and you know he's doing great work but those producers are
[24:39.960 --> 24:44.200]  keeping folks on a very very short leash and Hannity is telling the truth at
[24:44.200 --> 24:50.920]  his peril now let me just stop there if you just tuned in this social
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.440]  distortion social upheaval is being engineered that's admitted that's
[24:55.440 --> 25:01.720]  declassified criminal elements inside the government the deep state are working
[25:01.720 --> 25:05.680]  with the media with fake news and fake leaks to try to undermine Trump's
[25:05.680 --> 25:10.080]  recovery that's really the big news not just Trump himself but the Trump
[25:10.080 --> 25:15.560]  recovery we are under sabotage attack this is so outrageous and here's the
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.280]  most important point they're not going to just try to remove Trump now they
[25:20.280 --> 25:26.600]  know culturally they're losing they know Americanism versus globalism
[25:26.600 --> 25:30.640]  there's no choice people are gonna go with Americana and prosperity not with
[25:30.640 --> 25:35.520]  austerity and poverty and social unrest and brainwashing and engineered
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.240]  racism and all this other crud people have broken with the globalist bullies
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.880]  people started breaking with this modern new world order system decades ago so
[25:44.880 --> 25:49.000]  they intimidated people they lied about folks they call people racist conspiracy
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.960]  theorist they did all sorts of horrible things setting people up railroad and
[25:52.960 --> 25:59.240]  folks into prison it didn't work and now globally it's spreading exponentially
[25:59.240 --> 26:04.160]  and their big computer programs that Bezos and Apple and Google and all of
[26:04.160 --> 26:08.040]  them have know that and they admit that in their own elite publications that
[26:08.040 --> 26:11.440]  global government's falling that they're in crisis and this is their last
[26:11.440 --> 26:18.800]  stand they understand that the old global elite is being swept away we're
[26:18.800 --> 26:23.440]  about to set the table for the new world not their fake old world order they
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.920]  called a new world order but a true shot at a future the world's got so much
[26:27.920 --> 26:33.240]  uncertainty and so many problems in nanotech and GMO and AI and population
[26:33.240 --> 26:37.840]  explosions and all of this we need to have good people focus working hard if
[26:37.840 --> 26:41.160]  we've got any future and it doesn't mean there are going to be some tough
[26:41.160 --> 26:45.280]  decisions and some big wars and a lot of other things we're gonna have to make
[26:45.280 --> 26:50.160]  decisions on but we don't need a bunch of globalist spirit cooking devil
[26:50.160 --> 26:57.280]  worshiping lazy new world order fobs in control of this thing they need to go we
[26:57.280 --> 27:02.400]  need to politically burn them down and they know we're burning them down they
[27:02.400 --> 27:06.840]  knew the power of the info or seven years ago Time Magazine called me the
[27:06.840 --> 27:11.760]  wild prophet of the Tea Party and it said from my mountain I was preaching
[27:11.760 --> 27:18.560]  the message that was spreading like a disease CNN calls me a virus this isn't
[27:18.560 --> 27:23.720]  a power trip we have to recognize the spirit they hey you have it I have it
[27:23.720 --> 27:26.280]  you could be black you could be white you could be gold you be young you'd be
[27:26.280 --> 27:29.800]  male female if you want liberty and you don't want to be a slave and you want
[27:29.800 --> 27:35.480]  human freedom that's the spirit and they don't like that spirit they can feel
[27:35.480 --> 27:41.760]  that spirit growing I can feel it right now it's powerful they're jealous of it
[27:41.760 --> 27:45.880]  it's crude it's honorable it's focused it's strong it's full of creativity in
[27:45.880 --> 27:50.480]  life it's also full of death and war when it comes to fighting evil and they
[27:50.480 --> 27:57.680]  hate it a patriot is a thousand times the man one of these snakes are now that
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.800]  said Colonel Schaefer has warned of this a month ago now he says they're
[28:02.800 --> 28:07.200]  attacking on purpose it's meant to an illicit a response civil war
[28:07.200 --> 28:11.400]  Hannity comes out says deep state is moving to overthrow the Republic and
[28:11.400 --> 28:15.160]  over who the president they don't want that said until they launch operations
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.240]  they want to build up and get ready and try to get all their cowardly forces
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.520]  lined up to believe they can get away with it that's why they denied they
[28:23.520 --> 28:26.920]  tried to steal the nomination and they tried to deny that they tried to steal
[28:26.920 --> 28:31.120]  the delegates which they all got caught doing deny deny denies the military
[28:31.120 --> 28:37.600]  tactic World War one the Germans would broadcast you know over their bullhorns
[28:37.600 --> 28:41.400]  the war is over give up we are your friends as they come over the top with
[28:41.400 --> 28:45.480]  their bayonets and stick them into you and vice versa it's propaganda it's
[28:45.480 --> 28:52.960]  lies so here's Colonel Schaefer has something to say about someone I don't
[28:52.960 --> 28:55.800]  think you'd be trying to go through your staff to say it I think if you felt a
[28:55.800 --> 28:59.640]  certain way you would tell that person why why do we believe that James Comey
[28:59.640 --> 29:04.560]  would want this leaked out I think that this is something being done by those
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.480]  in the deep state to upset everything that's going on and like you said try to
[29:08.480 --> 29:15.240]  undermine the president in every breath you know and we're gonna play the full
[29:15.240 --> 29:19.120]  clip coming up later where he breaks down it's an information war how this is
[29:19.120 --> 29:23.880]  all working now we come back Hannity lays it all out Tuesday and the Washington
[29:23.880 --> 29:27.900]  Post says they want him fired they say you better watch it we almost got you
[29:27.900 --> 29:32.280]  fired we'll get you fired again this is the CIA criminal elements of it with
[29:32.280 --> 29:38.200]  600 million a taxpayer money I mean the Washington Post is mainly Spokes mainly
[29:38.200 --> 29:42.400]  if you work at the Washington Post in politics your usual naval intelligence
[29:42.400 --> 29:49.240]  army intelligence CIA you name it and they're all leftist hand-picked we're
[29:49.240 --> 29:57.680]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.240 --> 30:06.360]  anarchist and antifa activists continue to engage in sporadic street battles
[30:06.360 --> 30:10.840]  across the country and they are targeting Trump supporters and that means
[30:10.840 --> 30:16.720]  extremism experts are now focusing on the left retired Lieutenant Colonel
[30:16.720 --> 30:21.280]  Anthony Schaefer recently appeared on Fox and Friends and gave the mainstream
[30:21.280 --> 30:26.480]  media a dose of the truth the progressive left has been radicalized and
[30:26.480 --> 30:31.840]  they want a civil war and the pathology is clear if one side begins to act
[30:31.840 --> 30:35.600]  violently you have inevitably the other side starting to come back it always
[30:35.600 --> 30:39.520]  happens so we we have to understand if the government does not open stop the
[30:39.520 --> 30:42.400]  violence on the left you'll see more violence on the right retaliation it's
[30:42.400 --> 30:47.800]  inevitable meanwhile info wars continues to expose how the global elite are
[30:47.800 --> 30:54.880]  orchestrating a destabilization program to take down America and you are the
[30:54.880 --> 31:00.560]  resistance you can learn more right now at info wars calm it's not just our
[31:00.560 --> 31:04.040]  water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be clean it's the
[31:04.040 --> 31:08.240]  air we're breathing especially for our children the artificial particulates
[31:08.240 --> 31:13.440]  of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems the same team
[31:13.440 --> 31:17.720]  based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[31:17.720 --> 31:22.080]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze whether
[31:22.080 --> 31:26.000]  it's your home or office you owe it to yourself your co-workers your family
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.640]  your children to the best job you can to purify your air the elite are masters
[31:30.640 --> 31:34.360]  at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:34.360 --> 31:39.760]  or avoid most toxic effects to themselves the general public doesn't the
[31:39.760 --> 31:43.000]  Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred
[31:43.000 --> 31:47.480]  dollars one of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean this is
[31:47.480 --> 31:50.680]  a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older
[31:50.680 --> 31:55.160]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is
[31:55.160 --> 32:01.660]  so revolutionary today then for our store.com I am very proud to announce the
[32:01.660 --> 32:08.240]  introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense probiotic we wanted

[33:02.520 --> 33:09.440]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[33:09.440 --> 33:19.600]  of the info war let's start with this what appears to be a memo to file by the
[33:19.600 --> 33:28.280]  FBI director right that can that conveys a one-person view of what happened in a
[33:28.280 --> 33:32.960]  conversation with at least one other person the president what do you make
[33:32.960 --> 33:37.240]  of this well further than that Lou let me read to you the article from MSNBC
[33:37.240 --> 33:43.480]  neither NBC News nor the Times has seen the actual memo think about that they're
[33:43.480 --> 33:47.680]  reporting that someone whispered to them about a memo that may or may not
[33:47.680 --> 33:53.160]  exist in somebody's file at the FBI this is truly deep state and you have
[33:53.160 --> 34:00.440]  collusion I mean this this passes for reporting this is beyond insane and and
[34:00.440 --> 34:04.480]  Lou what you said here walking up to it I think illustrates clearly what the
[34:04.480 --> 34:09.800]  issue is regarding the president the president did actually ask mr. Comey to
[34:09.800 --> 34:15.400]  do something and that thing he asked me to do was do your job investigate the
[34:15.400 --> 34:20.120]  leaks and instead of doing that and being asked by trade gouty the same
[34:20.120 --> 34:24.640]  thing expressing no interest at all and actually doing his job to investigate
[34:24.640 --> 34:29.840]  leaks which by the way did compromise techniques and procedures of how we do
[34:29.840 --> 34:34.680]  collection it was an arrogance about him they said basically I can pick and
[34:34.680 --> 34:38.480]  choose what I want to do so this is another example of that where you have
[34:38.480 --> 34:42.240]  people and by the way look just between you and me if you had something say
[34:42.240 --> 34:45.440]  about someone I don't think you'd be trying to go through your staff to say
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.520]  it I think if you felt a certain way you would tell that person why why do we
[34:49.520 --> 34:53.680]  believe that James Comey would want this leaked out I think that the this is
[34:53.680 --> 34:57.440]  something being done by those in the deep state to upset everything that's
[34:57.440 --> 35:01.680]  going on and like you said try to undermine the president in every
[35:01.680 --> 35:07.000]  breath we're an information war with a deep state criminally operating and
[35:07.000 --> 35:13.360]  six hundred million dollars was given by the CIA as soon as Trump won the
[35:13.360 --> 35:16.680]  November 8th election six hundred million dollars that was in the
[35:16.680 --> 35:22.200]  Associated Press was given by Obama a year money to the Washington Post and
[35:22.200 --> 35:26.880]  you wonder why they make the New York Times look truthful they are the worst
[35:26.880 --> 35:32.920]  and they wrote a big article by Eric Wimple who's a special little operator
[35:32.920 --> 35:38.520]  against this country literally literally Fox News is Sean Hannity is
[35:38.520 --> 35:45.760]  encroaching on Alex Jones territory and then he goes through and says Hannity
[35:45.760 --> 35:50.920]  almost got fired for the made-up Seth Rich story really an unsolved murder of
[35:50.920 --> 35:54.760]  a key DNC staffer who we have evidence was the main leaker being shot in the
[35:54.760 --> 36:00.240]  back execution style and not Rob and the family did get a PI at first and all
[36:00.240 --> 36:03.080]  this happened and then suddenly clearly got threatened or something and backed
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.160]  off and they said how dare you hurt the family
[36:09.320 --> 36:17.360]  then they go he's getting it from Alex Jones Jones says there's a COG plan to
[36:17.360 --> 36:21.960]  overturn the election and overthrow Trump yeah I read it in the Financial
[36:21.960 --> 36:26.440]  Times of London Atlantic Monthly the New Yorker magazine and I watched
[36:26.440 --> 36:30.720]  politicians talk about it and say impeach Trump and say kill him and say
[36:30.720 --> 36:35.280]  kill his supporters and then I witnessed it happening and I witnessed
[36:35.280 --> 36:40.240]  congressmen and police being shot and I witnessed Trump saying let's have a
[36:40.240 --> 36:44.720]  moment of silence and send our prayers to Scalise that finally isn't in
[36:44.720 --> 36:52.840]  critical condition he's in stable shot him with a high-powered rifle thank God
[36:52.840 --> 37:00.360]  the demon libtard you know wasn't a good shot and they all boo they the the
[37:00.360 --> 37:11.400]  protesters go no we don't send prayers we'll be dying that's coming up and then
[37:11.400 --> 37:14.640]  they talk to the Washington Post readers like they're complete idiots
[37:14.640 --> 37:20.640]  when right out of the deep state's mouth comes this article saying Hannity
[37:20.640 --> 37:23.840]  needs to be fired and better watch himself kind of like Brennan the
[37:23.840 --> 37:27.280]  Wahhabist two days before Trump fired him saying you ought to watch your mouth
[37:27.280 --> 37:33.120]  president elect that's the arrogance of the deep state and the elites all
[37:33.120 --> 37:41.720]  bought off by all these multinationals and globalist and Trump knew who was
[37:41.720 --> 37:44.960]  fun in the deep state Saudi Arabia and China's that's why he met with them
[37:44.960 --> 37:50.080]  first he marched into Saudi Arabia he told them we're gonna level you if you
[37:50.080 --> 37:56.520]  don't back off and stop the al Qaeda and ISIS forces you're backing you can
[37:56.520 --> 38:00.560]  have a carpet of bombs or a carpet of gold and we'll give you weapons to fend
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.960]  off that are heavy weapons double the fight Iran but we're not gonna fund
[38:03.960 --> 38:11.360]  any more jihad so here's the big news we have to get this information out to
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.920]  everybody because they're scared of this information they want to prepare all
[38:16.920 --> 38:20.400]  this and only have it in their elite publications to each other and then when
[38:20.400 --> 38:25.200]  a little old country bumpkin like me from Texas goes look here they are
[38:25.200 --> 38:28.960]  rewriting the succession rules and admitting they Obama did a stay behind
[38:28.960 --> 38:32.040]  network they're gonna try to overthrow Trump remember the New York Times
[38:32.040 --> 38:37.320]  headlines it's that print me those please or it said in final weeks in
[38:37.320 --> 38:43.200]  office Obama is putting in as many people as he can into the bureaucracy to
[38:43.200 --> 38:46.800]  try to stop Trump remember those headlines to try to stop Trump wrecking the
[38:46.800 --> 38:50.160]  country was how they spun it Obama's hiring record numbers of people and
[38:50.160 --> 38:55.040]  putting them in the bureaucracy to try to you'll stop Trump's agenda and then
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.240]  there were other headlines yes Obama is letting as much information as he can
[38:59.240 --> 39:05.240]  out to the press before Trump gets in he's leaking as much info as he can they
[39:05.240 --> 39:08.960]  were admitting all of it and Trump said he thought it was coming that was the
[39:08.960 --> 39:14.560]  leaker and of course he was Obama's last days aiding Trump transition by
[39:14.560 --> 39:20.400]  erecting policy roadblocks the New York Times so there they are putting the deep
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.040]  state in that's never been done by another administration before with the
[39:24.040 --> 39:32.040]  next coming in and then they tell us that we're insane and Sean Hannity needs
[39:32.040 --> 39:41.520]  to be fired because he said this on Tuesday night tonight a soft coup is
[39:41.520 --> 39:45.800]  underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to
[39:45.800 --> 39:50.840]  overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected
[39:50.840 --> 39:55.840]  president from office sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.840]  in my mind a clear and present danger that is tonight's very important opening
[40:00.840 --> 40:06.880]  monologue right so here in America we're at a turning point tonight with forces
[40:06.880 --> 40:10.440]  now forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office it's
[40:10.440 --> 40:14.760]  that serious now here are the five dangers we are facing especially the
[40:14.760 --> 40:19.440]  president one you've got to destroy Trump media that has been lying to you
[40:19.440 --> 40:25.640]  now provable lies for 11 months nonstop Trump Russia collusion black helicopter
[40:25.640 --> 40:30.360]  theories no evidence whatsoever to you've got what I've been calling the deep
[40:30.360 --> 40:35.400]  state selectively leaking information to damage the president and anyone
[40:35.400 --> 40:40.760]  associated with him three special counsel Mueller's investigation mission creep
[40:40.760 --> 40:44.760]  I've been telling you about well it's now turned into an out of control what
[40:44.760 --> 40:50.080]  is a political witch hunt it needs to be stopped for all this manufactured
[40:50.080 --> 40:54.760]  turmoil putting president Trump's agenda in jeopardy which ends up directly
[40:54.760 --> 40:59.240]  impacting every one of you out there the American people and five this effort
[40:59.240 --> 41:03.440]  to override the will of the American people change the results of a
[41:03.440 --> 41:09.000]  presidential election is now creating a national security crisis America is now
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.320]  suffering from a massive informational crisis because I call them the destroy
[41:14.320 --> 41:20.960]  Trump media has routinely been exposed now agenda-driven propagandist more than
[41:20.960 --> 41:26.000]  happy to push debunked tin foil hat conspiracy theories for example the
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.080]  media relentlessly peddling one of the biggest lies in American history that
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.320]  is that the president colluded with the Russians now that's because members of
[41:35.320 --> 41:39.200]  the media are nothing more than left-wing ideologues pretending to be
[41:39.200 --> 41:42.680]  journalists remember they're the ones that colluded with Hillary Clinton
[41:42.680 --> 41:48.360]  exposed by WikiLeaks in the 2016 election the media has one clear shared
[41:48.360 --> 41:54.480]  goal in mind and that is to damage stop and destroy Trump's presidency sadly it
[41:54.480 --> 41:58.280]  appears by any means necessary we have been highlighting right here on this
[41:58.280 --> 42:02.440]  program night after night just how unhinged these people have become and
[42:02.440 --> 42:05.600]  they don't care about facts obviously don't they don't care about the truth
[42:05.600 --> 42:12.360]  which is why the Washington Post the New York Times ABC NBC CNN all exposed as
[42:12.360 --> 42:17.000]  having gotten their reporting wrong but the destroy Trump media they're not the
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.800]  only ones whose collusion narrative by the way is completely crumbled take a
[42:21.800 --> 42:28.760]  list at the long list of Democrats admitting no evidence of collusion zero
[42:28.760 --> 42:34.040]  zip take a look well that you know the allegation of course is that the
[42:34.040 --> 42:40.000]  Russians in the hacking and dumping of documents in the election had essentially
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  relationships with Trump campaign people but I'm not prepared to say that
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.440]  there's proof you could take to a jury do you agree with this conclusion that the
[42:47.440 --> 42:50.840]  president has reached there was no evidence of collusion you know we
[42:50.840 --> 42:54.920]  haven't seen any of that whatsoever George we've been looking in and showing
[42:54.920 --> 42:59.680]  everything that they possibly have we got connections with Hillary the next
[42:59.680 --> 43:03.920]  threat and perhaps the most dangerous to deep state that is the unelected what I
[43:03.920 --> 43:08.200]  call the fourth branch of government consisting of a lot of Obama holdovers
[43:08.200 --> 43:13.400]  anti-Trump bureaucrats who now are routinely targeting the president his
[43:13.400 --> 43:18.360]  administration with selective leaking to hurt him now this deep state works
[43:18.360 --> 43:22.320]  closely with the destroyed Trump media to disseminate false information about
[43:22.320 --> 43:25.760]  the president and his administration and what's even more dangerous more
[43:25.760 --> 43:30.640]  sinister about the deep state is that they're willing to break the law leaking
[43:30.640 --> 43:34.680]  classified information like in the case of General Flynn and you have the former
[43:34.680 --> 43:39.240]  FBI director James Comey admitting under oath he had his memo leaked to the
[43:39.240 --> 43:43.360]  New York Times he had a goal he wanted the appointment of a special counsel
[43:43.360 --> 43:49.560]  at Paul's for a moment please this is just unprecedented Hannity again I talked
[43:49.560 --> 43:53.000]  to two people high up at Fox that are friends with Hannity and he came out of
[43:53.000 --> 43:56.120]  those meetings three four weeks ago and we said the word is he's gonna be fired
[43:56.120 --> 43:59.840]  next week because he said I believe I'll be fired next week and then there was
[43:59.840 --> 44:05.600]  just so much pressure that they backed off and guaranteed they are thinking
[44:05.600 --> 44:13.120]  about firing him for what he just did and if you read the article in the in the
[44:13.120 --> 44:17.200]  Washington Post the they speak from an position of authority because this is the
[44:17.200 --> 44:22.400]  deep state and they say shut up or you're fired in the article and stop
[44:22.400 --> 44:28.640]  quoting Alex Jones and they know full well I mean they're in briefing rooms
[44:28.640 --> 44:33.160]  ladies and gentlemen led by folks that have overthrown countries okay funded
[44:33.160 --> 44:39.120]  by Soros funded by Bezos funded by the CIA and they think you're so stupid that
[44:39.120 --> 44:45.800]  you won't type in Washington Post got $600 million from the CIA that was in
[44:45.800 --> 44:50.320]  mainstream news even other mainstream media got jealous and reported on it and
[44:50.320 --> 44:55.680]  said maybe that crosses the line even that Charlie Wurzel guy from Buzzfeed
[44:55.680 --> 44:59.280]  that puts out near fiction articles was on CNN this weekend they were talking
[44:59.280 --> 45:02.880]  about banning me from the airwaves period he said hey wait this sounds
[45:02.880 --> 45:09.920]  dangerous yeah you bet it's dangerous people just admit we're right we're not
[45:09.920 --> 45:15.120]  the tinfoil hatwares you are I've studied the government I've studied history
[45:15.120 --> 45:21.840]  I've changed the world with my listeners and I don't say that from a from a
[45:21.840 --> 45:26.120]  power trip I want more people getting it like Sean Hannity I want to see
[45:26.120 --> 45:31.160]  everybody get it I want to make it safe for you to tell the truth I'm willing to
[45:31.160 --> 45:35.360]  step up and be annihilated be destroyed be drugs of the mud be attacked because
[45:35.360 --> 45:46.080]  that's what men do to lead but it's crazy it's crazy that the CIA gave them
[45:46.080 --> 45:52.920]  $600 million two months before Obama left office that's just one thing they
[45:52.920 --> 45:58.160]  did to overthrow this country this is completely illegal this country is in a
[45:58.160 --> 46:04.440]  total civil war right now with a bunch of scum it's not like there's a civil war
[46:04.440 --> 46:07.480]  and we're fighting globalist and communism and socialism we did it the
[46:07.480 --> 46:11.360]  peaceful way through the ballot box we beat all their illegals voting their
[46:11.360 --> 46:17.520]  dead people voting all their crud major studies out that the voting machines
[46:17.520 --> 46:22.360]  gave Hillary a nine-point advantage they over sample the polls nine to 15
[46:22.360 --> 46:28.440]  points for Democrats and still Trump just won four special elections when they
[46:28.440 --> 46:33.200]  poured more money into all four than they've ever done each subsequent race
[46:33.200 --> 46:38.680]  breaking at every previous record they hit us with everything they've got and
[46:38.680 --> 46:43.400]  we're crushing them these scum don't give up easy that's why Bezos looks so
[46:43.400 --> 46:46.560]  freaked out he wants to mount America's hell on the wall because he's got a
[46:46.560 --> 46:54.840]  little you know what people are your enemy they hate you they hate flyover
[46:54.840 --> 46:59.720]  country they hate better clingers they hate everybody they hate each other

[47:04.120 --> 47:10.720]  are enemies of every single man woman and child on earth Democrats all over the
[47:10.720 --> 47:13.920]  place celebrated congressman's police and the cops everybody else getting shot a
[47:13.920 --> 47:19.840]  few weeks ago we can have a go and Democratic strategist put out little
[47:19.840 --> 47:23.560]  hashtags hunt Republicans and all this other crap and you see their violence
[47:23.560 --> 47:27.120]  and they're all the way saying kill everybody and then Trump is at a rally
[47:27.120 --> 47:31.760]  yesterday and there's you know a balcony and protesters that got in they you
[47:31.760 --> 47:35.360]  know they let him in there it's America and the leftists won't let you be at

[47:42.000 --> 47:45.440]  the morning and showed small crowds you had to go through security this is this
[47:45.440 --> 47:50.040]  how many lies until you know they're the enemy media they're the globalist media

[47:54.920 --> 48:00.720]  face and Trump is like a doctor trying to remove it from our face and it's
[48:00.720 --> 48:05.400]  tightened up around our neck going you're not gonna do you're not that it's
[48:05.400 --> 48:09.600]  saying to Hannity we'll fire you they're saying to me we'll kill you they're
[48:09.600 --> 48:13.520]  telling Trump we'll get your family and we're all saying let's go not because
[48:13.520 --> 48:20.720]  we're tough guys are looking for trouble we can't bend over to the scum they
[48:20.720 --> 48:24.840]  don't want to make a deal whether it's folks they want it's gone because we're
[48:24.840 --> 48:28.240]  stronger than them we're better looking than them we're more honorable than them
[48:28.240 --> 48:34.640]  and they know it that's all I ever tell Trump on the telephone I'm gonna say
[48:34.640 --> 48:38.120]  they're coming after you they're never gonna stop they hate what you're doing I

[48:49.400 --> 48:52.640]  them now because they're at war with you and that's the same message I'm making

[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:15.920]  thought they could take her after she went into the radiation chamber with
[1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:22.400]  Trump and he roasted her she was cooked already then she stumbled over to NBC
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:28.520]  fell flat on her face and the bad ratings began to sink like a lead balloon
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:35.800]  into oblivion I smell failure that's why they keep telling the Lemmings and all
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:38.800]  the news articles Jones is failing Jones is failing Trump's failing everything's

[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:52.280]  get fired all this stuff's going on on and on and on and on and on it's
[1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:55.560]  amazing let's go to us some of Sean Hannity some more of that powerful ten
[1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:59.720]  minute breakdown he did the whole martial law program an example is the
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:04.320]  unmasking of General Flynn that was a violation of the espionage act that's a
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:08.760]  crime that's a felony by the way and then Flynn's Fourth Amendment rights by
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:12.320]  the way totally trampled on you've heard nothing about it there's no
[1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:16.680]  investigation there why again the deep state they don't care they're only
[1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:20.040]  concerned with taking down President Trump and President Trump's associates
[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:23.240]  that you've got number three the special counsel look at Mueller's
[1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:27.160]  investigation mission creep remember President Trump has called this the
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:30.600]  greatest political witch hunt in American history I'm here to tell you the
[1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:35.400]  president's right Mueller's sole purpose was to investigate so-called Trump
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:40.620]  Russia collusion but Mueller is now expanding that investigation and he's
[1:03:40.620 --> 1:03:45.360]  digging into finances and Jared Kushner and obstruction of justice and guess
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:49.840]  what he's not gonna stop there why cuz there is no Trump Russia collusion so
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:52.920]  he has to move on to other things and I'll tell you what's most alarming about
[1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:57.080]  this Mueller is having massive conflicts of interest he should recuse
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:04:02.000]  himself he's incapable of carrying out a fair and impartial investigation now
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:06.040]  Mueller needs to end this witch hunt right now he's bet he's best friends
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:10.920]  with James Comey the two have been best friends for a long time and who do you
[1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:14.440]  think Mueller is gonna side with when it comes to the president and his word
[1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:18.800]  versus James Comey's word that's pretty obvious pretty unfair and then
[1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:22.240]  there's the fact that members of Mueller's investigative team the lawyers
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:27.680]  he's hiring they've all many of them donated big big bucks to let's see
[1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:34.360]  Barack Obama Hillary Clinton and on top of that perhaps most sinister one of the
[1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:38.780]  lawyers Mueller has hired actually was Clinton's attorney at the Clinton
[1:04:38.780 --> 1:04:42.600]  Foundation defending the Clinton that's enough it goes on and on it's so
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:46.480]  powerful and they want him fired it's incredible and he exposes the plan that
[1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:49.840]  they're gearing up for a violent overthrow of the president and then a
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:53.920]  total shutdown of America because they know we're winning the information war
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:59.160]  where we're winning peacefully they want to overturn the table with violence
[1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:03.600]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa and one of the people in attendance are
[1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:07.040]  anonymous sources say was Bill Clinton well how do we know it was Bill Clinton
[1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:09.640]  because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to representative
[1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:12.320]  Steve Scalise and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field
[1:05:12.320 --> 1:05:15.560]  by a deranged Bernie supporter Democratic operatives began blowing their

[1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:38.920]  Democrats can't even protest right these people fail at everything they lose
[1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:42.680]  elections they lose public support and now they look like thoughtless cowards
[1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:49.040]  it's just as Trump said never fails never you can check out the video on

[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:27.840]  from the front lines we are the front line from the front lines of the information
[1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:49.320]  war it's Alex Jones well President Trump just tweeted out whether there are
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:54.520]  tapes or recordings of my conversations with James Comey but I did not make and
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:58.720]  do not have any such recordings and I guess it was an earlier tweet where he
[1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:02.440]  finishes that or starts it but he's basically saying somebody might have
[1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:08.480]  taped it but I didn't and that's how he bluffed Comey into admitting the truth
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:15.240]  and got around the fake memo that they won't release to get Comey to say no he
[1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:18.400]  never tried to obstruct justice he never asked me to do that because Trump knew
[1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:21.880]  he hadn't done that he knew they were lying they knew he'd leaked a fake memo
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:28.120]  to say it he understood the whole plan and so he then bluffed Comey in his
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:35.720]  testimony into not lying that's why we have Comey not once but twice in front
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:41.440]  of Congress saying he that is the president never tried to obstruct
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:53.400]  justice now I don't usually spend an hour on one subject but I did with what we
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:57.760]  were covering because the subject matter was so powerful and I tell you Sean
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:03.040]  Hannity's attacked me before a decade or so ago the media would misrepresent when
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:07.280]  I said they take out a context and Sean Hannity's Mr. American guy really means
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:11.480]  what he's saying and believes in what he's doing and I could get he couldn't
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:14.640]  deal with the loss if I was covering because it just sounded outrageous now
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:17.960]  decades later I have a lot more credibility because so much of what I
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:21.120]  broke down has now come out exactly as I said it was happening well of course I
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:24.960]  had the documents I have the sources but Hannity's a hero now I'm not
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:28.760]  competition with this radio show even though I am on some stations I'm not in
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:34.800]  competition against Fox News I wish other people would take the floor and start
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:38.920]  doing a better job than I'm doing and in the case of the 15 minute report he
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:43.520]  filed Tuesday night that I didn't see yesterday because I was I was working on
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:48.840]  other issues that I saw last night this morning it's just incredible and the
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:53.440]  Washington Post wants him fired here's the headline Fox News Sean Hannity is
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:57.800]  encroaching on Alex Jones territory you mean he's encroaching on reality you
[1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:03.000]  mean he's actually reading the New Yorker magazine and other elite
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.040]  publications like Atlantic monthly that the elite left to read where they
[1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:10.680]  actually tell the truth like public affairs of the Washington Post where
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:14.600]  they say the CIA is involved trying to overthrow Trump and that six hundred
[1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:18.880]  million was given by Jeff Bezos from the CIA of the Washington Post just put out
[1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:22.760]  propaganda on Trump and that they want a deep state overthrow and a new
[1:11:22.760 --> 1:11:27.160]  presidential succession to remove the Republicans in Congress that were
[1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:34.440]  elected in 2016 saying that they were put in by the Russians I mean here's the
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:39.880]  article go read it this is just Atlantic monthly rewriting the rules of
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:45.280]  presidential succession a project began at 9-11 assumes new urgency after the
[1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:50.160]  2016 election creating a more sensible plan for what happens when a chief
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:56.280]  executive steps aside or is removed so they make it sound real reasonable real
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:11:59.920]  nice this would be like you were writing an article about we reasonably want to
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:04.440]  grab kids out of the back of your yard and eat them we want to reasonably detonate
[1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:07.320]  nuclear weapons destroy the planet and they just oh and then you read the
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:11.520]  article yeah the Russians stole the election and everybody that got elected
[1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:14.880]  needs to be removed and Homeland Security needs to take over the election and
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:19.320]  have a new one and safeguarded to make sure Democrats stay in power get to
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:22.520]  understand when you're reading this they've already Homeland Security the
[1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:25.000]  elections they already took control of them when Obama left office
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:29.320]  Trump candidly bureaucracies to back off all 50 state attorney generals have said
[1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:38.240]  get rid of it it's a total nightmare most of it's in place 90 90% or so is in
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:50.680]  place that's about 93% the last 7% is gow lighting they've got to get the minds
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:57.400]  ready they've got to prepare the public for Trump's death prepare the public
[1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:01.680]  that Alex Jones is an evil guy it was what he said about the Sandy Hook
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:04.680]  families that he did to say so you don't thank God somebody killed him or
[1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:07.840]  whatever you know just some low-note of course they're just preparing everyone
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:12.760]  for their death and infiltrating families and infiltrating businesses and
[1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:17.520]  just I mean the stuff going on the payoffs and the the black ops it's just
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:23.840]  hellish but I expected it I asked for it I'm in the middle of it way crazier than
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:28.920]  any action-adventure movie it's called reality truth is stranger than fiction
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:34.440]  times a hundred so I believe God is stronger than the devil I know God is
[1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:37.920]  and I believe you're stronger than the globalist and the leftist vassals and
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:43.480]  minions and their poor slaves they're golem like slaves and so I'm asking I
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:50.080]  am I am humbly requesting your prayers I come off sometimes is a little bit
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:53.720]  arrogant it's not that it's it's that it's it's it's the confidence of a man
[1:13:53.720 --> 1:13:57.560]  that knows he's in a fight for his life it's not even it's not arrogant believe
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:01.880]  me it's it's it's it's not putting a good face on either it's getting into the
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:08.240]  mode of enjoying all this and so thank you for putting up with me but understand
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:11.600]  ladies and gentlemen I haven't told you a third of what's going on behind the
[1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:16.760]  scenes I mean it is crazy and
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:20.600]  well people say well we better not fight tyranny they'll come after us no they
[1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:24.160]  don't come after the big guys this is the time where you have real power to
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:27.320]  devastate the globalist in the information war and and really not even
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:31.880]  have any repercussions the repercussions are if you do nothing
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:35.800]  that's how evil thrives that's how it takes over that's how it has victory
[1:14:35.800 --> 1:14:39.680]  after victory and we've seen these anti-human anti-god anti-family
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:45.480]  anti-america globalist wreck the third world wreck society engage in massive
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:49.120]  human experimentation engage in so many crimes it's dizzying to even try to
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:53.840]  think of a handful of them because there's so many you know what do you boil
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:56.320]  it down to
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:08.360]  they're preparing for the overthrow of Western civilization they were so close
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:15.960]  we were sliding down about to fall off the precipice and the liberty movement
[1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:20.720]  America shot up an arm and it's holding on with one hand and we're trying to
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:26.840]  pull up and the MSM the destroy America crowd the destroy Trump crowd the
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:31.000]  destroy Christian crowd is just hanging under our ankles and they want to go
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.400]  they want to fall they don't care if they get destroyed in the process they
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:42.320]  hate us I mean you go out to a leftist event they all look like they've had
[1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:48.840]  serious brain trauma you know they all grew up in little little cribs little
[1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:52.680]  cages you know they didn't get any loving you know they didn't get held up
[1:15:52.680 --> 1:16:00.280]  against mama well then maybe an hour a week they were lucky and they got eyes
[1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:06.400]  like zombies and then you look at their controllers they are just wicked envious
[1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:14.240]  hateful people who are just the trash of the earth the just unmitigated trash I
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:19.160]  mean it's just if people knew if they just saw if they researched they would
[1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:37.720]  be absolutely vomiting not believing they were so kind if you want to know their
[1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:45.640]  mindset think about congressman police and the police all of them shot we can
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:50.080]  have to go at the baseball game in Virginia and how the New York Times said
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:52.400]  this is where they are this is where you can get them I mean it's just it's all
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:56.560]  so concerted they know they put enough messaging they put enough stimuli it's
[1:16:56.560 --> 1:17:00.680]  going to happen it's like varmint calls you know they mean they know it's coming
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:04.960]  in or duck calls they're calling it in and then Trump yesterday at a rally
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:08.360]  says let's have our prayers go out to him and others that were shot and then
[1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:12.120]  they pause and then all the leftists are screaming yelling and booing and hissing
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:21.360]  it illustrates everything here's a clip I'd like to also take this moment to
[1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:26.880]  send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend somebody that I've
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:50.880]  gotten to know very well Steve Scalise and everyone recovering from the assault
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:57.880]  never fails never fails and notice the spirit that defeats them everyone just
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:01.760]  laughs at the lobotomy scum you look at the Trump supporters whether black water
[1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:06.960]  Hispanic shining eyes awake alive hopeful for the future you look at leftist
[1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:11.120]  pissed angry they only believe they get power by getting control the government
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:15.320]  and taking what you've got as if they could manage or run any of it if they
[1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:21.280]  had control of it as if you'd be happy being given something it doesn't work
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:26.360]  anywhere because it's not human nature and the Bezos is aren't liberals they're
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:33.280]  the most hardcore greedy jerks in the world I mean Bezos is eating Walmart
[1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:38.280]  globalism is designed to absorb free market and make you poor that's their
[1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:44.960]  own white papers but again they think you don't read those we do we cover them
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:50.000]  we show you where they say it that's why they hate us they want to communicate
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:54.080]  Atlantic monthly about they're getting ready for government overthrow and how
[1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:56.560]  they're gonna arrest everybody and how they're gonna shut down the free press
[1:18:56.560 --> 1:19:01.920]  now they're gonna kick all the Republican congressman out who got elected
[1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:07.880]  the last election and they think you're so stupid that you can't go read that
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:11.800]  then they have the Washington Post go Hannity you're gonna get fired if you

[1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:13.360]  posted in FullWars.com where he laid out the deep states plan for a violent
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:16.640]  overthrow of Trump but they're now preparing and Colonel Shaver's joining
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:20.600]  us in the next hour he of course said that a month ago on Lou Dobbs business
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:24.800]  this is the fact the Democrats are in their own publications preparing this
[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:27.960]  they want to deny it say we're crazy even though it's in their own
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:32.720]  publications they want to prepare it then use the military tactic of denying
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:40.120]  it so we can't organize a defense around it it's outrageous words the the
[1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:45.480]  semantical lexicon the encyclopedia Britannica cannot describe how
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:51.240]  historic how mighty this is I mean Trump knew it was coming but he thought he
[1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:54.320]  could just turn the economy on work with people give him a seat at the table
[1:24:54.320 --> 1:25:00.760]  they back off no they want to bring him down and he he tried working with them
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:04.080]  he now knows it isn't gonna happen we told you a month and a half ago get
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:08.880]  ready he's making a turn back ladies and gentlemen it could happen any minute
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:11.640]  it could happen next month it could happen six months from now but they are
[1:25:11.640 --> 1:25:15.600]  pushing a violent coup as you see they're calling for war on the streets
[1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:20.880]  Soros is funding massive insurrection this July 2nd they've succeeded many
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:25.680]  other countries that's why they're so airing it and we're a peaceful good
[1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:29.560]  people we don't know how to deal with with with this type of subterfuge in our
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:33.120]  own government this is what happens in third-world countries the amount of
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:37.120]  traders of leftist brainwash in the colleges that have national security
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:43.920]  clearances he's unprecedented we have a giant fifth column the country has
[1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:48.920]  cancer and just to see Trump trying to turn the economy back on trying to bring
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:53.320]  hope back under such attack makes me love him so much and some people want to
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:56.160]  hedge their bets they think Trump's gonna be destroyed we're all gonna be
[1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:01.880]  destroyed if he's destroyed folks I feel so sorry for the leftist because I've
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:05.440]  wargame and others of wargame the Civil War because physical you're going to
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:09.640]  lose and there's no where Soros is gonna be able to hide and that's not talk
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:18.800]  people I told you Trump was gonna win this stuff goes beyond analysis
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:25.560]  let's play a little clip of Canada here it is also tonight a soft coup is
[1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:29.800]  underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:34.840]  overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:39.800]  president from office sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now
[1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:44.800]  in my mind a clear and present danger that is tonight's very important opening
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:50.440]  monologue all right now why are they saying fire him over this they say
[1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:55.160]  fire over Seth Rich an unsolved murder shot in the back you know what he like
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:58.920]  says he's you know we don't want to say it but yeah he's the leaker coming out
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:04.360]  criticizing Bernie Sanders being robbed oh my gosh it's crazy fire him now
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:08.200]  Washington Post says you better watch it you thought you're gonna be fired you
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:11.800]  are you don't bring up this crazy stuff and they show quotes of what he said
[1:27:11.800 --> 1:27:17.640]  when it's all out of publications of the establishment they are scared of this
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:23.720]  folks they want to develop this without us challenging it see a lot of men think
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:28.920]  they're alphas but a real alpha male wants to find other alpha males and alpha
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:33.080]  females and good people and build a defense of the structure in humanity
[1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:38.400]  not be threatened by other successful people I am so happy Sean Hannity has
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:41.840]  discovered all the truth and is now exposing it this is a big victory he has
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:45.160]  so much courage knowing what I've gone through I can't imagine behind the scenes
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:48.880]  it's probably threats on his family you name it we know it threats on his job and
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:52.520]  so it just it just it's a good thing because he's more articulate than I am
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:55.560]  in many ways and this is what we've been waiting for ladies and gentlemen this is
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:27:58.520]  what we've been waiting for because he's got a lot of credibility with mainline
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:02.280]  Republicans this is the chain reaction this smells like victory just like the
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:06.800]  big defeat of the globalist in Georgia two days ago
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:12.440]  Sean Hannity the real deal ladies and gentlemen the real deal doesn't hate

[1:30:13.840 --> 1:30:18.480]  enter Germany listen to these quotes the idea of Syrian villages is only one
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:22.680]  possibility we can use for example if refugees don't want to go to a country
[1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:26.080]  alone that has no other refugees people would rather go where compatriots

[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:16.760]  they ran in these four states where we've had four victories despite the
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:21.960]  Democrats spending the largest amounts of money in their history now Dr. Corsi
[1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:27.780]  has that many New York Times best-selling books number one work with the State
[1:35:27.780 --> 1:35:32.240]  Department in clandestine any terrorist up at his big big win is is in banking
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:36.800]  Harvard degree taught his class worked with Trump on projects you name it and
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:40.960]  he's got a lot of connections the FBI CIA you name it about what's happening in
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:44.040]  the deep state he keeps saying the president has awesome powers he's got a
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:48.360]  move now but I believe the president's been waiting he's a master with his
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:52.800]  instincts letting them go booze Scalise when he says get better let the
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:56.920]  Democrats call for murder and death let wait till they make their big violent
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:36:02.560]  move and he's ready to then at that point to deal with them all that's just
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:07.680]  what I've gleaned from what I've seen that said they are so scared of us
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:12.160]  talking about COG and the preparations to overthrow Trump Washington Post is
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:17.160]  calling for Hannity to be fired for quote being an Alex Jones territory for
[1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:20.320]  actually just quoting real news articles with the Democrats are preparing
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:24.800]  this so doc right I know you want about his powers when he's to do but isn't the
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:32.320]  real power we the people should be taking over all the live TV shows that
[1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:36.240]  are in public legally and lawfully flooding c-span every day flooding talk
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:40.720]  radio flooding our congressmen and women's phone numbers this should be
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:45.480]  bigger than the campaign of 2016 this is the big fight so dr. Corsi
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:49.480]  historically where are we where are we and how big a defeat is it for them
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:54.480]  that our talking points exposing their plans are now breaking through what it's
[1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:58.160]  a it's a huge defeat and I think that it's going to continue what you're
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:02.640]  finding is that the American public are responding they're listening and Donald
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:07.920]  Trump does have to begin to prepare to use the powers of the presidency I
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:13.280]  continue to say this are taking control I mean look even yesterday J. Johnson if
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:17.320]  you listen carefully to his testimony say we've got cyber attacks what does that
[1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:21.440]  mean Department of Homeland Security would be happy to take over all the
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:26.600]  state election processes I will protect you from cyber attacks and then the
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:33.480]  questions well were any votes changed by the Russians no it's just a DHS attempt
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:38.160]  to use a scare to say we want to take over all the state election and Trump
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:41.600]  has a letter from all 50 Attorney Generals saying they don't like Obama's
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:45.800]  final executive order federalizing elections is as as infrastructure
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:50.560]  protection under COG why hasn't Trump assigned executive order reversing that
[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:56.440]  well exactly and you know look now we're finding out that the whole Trump
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:02.560]  administration is faced with Obama saying all of the masking information all
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:07.600]  the documents relationship to Susan Rice well those are now all given over to
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:13.480]  the Obama library so they're no longer available I we've got a court case going
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:17.520]  to district we've got them classifying their illegal activity we say I mean
[1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:23.760]  let's explain let's explain we come in to restore the Republic Obama activates
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:26.520]  deep state says he's put the state behind networks in announces it in the
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:32.400]  New York Times they engage in all this this is an open counteraction against
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:36.240]  our action right and the the whole point of this Russian meme was not
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:41.280]  necessarily to convict you know anyone in particular they all is to set the
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:46.360]  basis for removing Donald Trump from office and the whole idea is look will
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:50.080]  because of the Russians well we could unmask and we're gonna hide that
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:53.280]  information Obama administration we'd have the Department of Homeland
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:58.160]  Security take over the state electoral processes will flood the country with
[1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:03.680]  illegals they'll be all able to vote all of these are step-by-step undermining
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:07.960]  the democratic processes on which Donald Trump was duly elected and it's all
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:12.080]  totally transparent so what does the president need to do and what do we need
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:15.200]  to do well the president first of all is going to start using the powers of the
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:19.240]  presidency much more effectively he's got to start saying we don't need to have
[1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:25.000]  a our press conference every day for the mainstream media to sit in the
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.520]  front seat of this little room this press room and and act up and be shown
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:35.240]  to be opposing the president and set the agenda move the mainstream media to
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:39.560]  the back row move out of that press room take them off the lawn if they want
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:43.600]  to broadcast from the lawn they can use green screen got a break up the
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:47.440]  monopoly of the mainstream media and Donald Trump can do it there's no law
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:52.720]  that says he has to have a daily televised press conference secondly get
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:56.600]  rid of previous get all of the people out of the administration who are not
[1:39:56.600 --> 1:40:01.720]  loyal to Donald Trump well he said July 4th they're gone well they don't I'm
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:05.440]  looking forward to that and secondly don't you love those optics July 4th
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:10.240]  bam boom well you know he's got to do it clean house take control I think he
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:13.920]  should launch his counter-operations in around July 4th that has to be
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:17.200]  symbolism but he's also telegraph that's maybe you should launch it tomorrow
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:21.400]  because big because here's the issue here's the key the Democrats are saying
[1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:26.240]  kill Trump kill the supporters murder everybody overthrow Trump declare the
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:30.560]  2016 election null and void Obama executive order federalize his elections
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:35.400]  that hasn't been reversed and they're saying all this then we report on what
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:39.600]  they're saying and they go you're crazy none of that's happening you're insane
[1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:43.700]  why are they doing that so we don't form an opposition and then low
[1:40:43.700 --> 1:40:47.840]  information voters here all this and think oh that's too radical there's no
[1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:51.080]  way Alex Jones or Sean Hannity are telling the truth or Trump's telling
[1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:56.880]  the truth but that's what happened well and look the Trump knows that it was
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:01.440]  the Alex Jones audience that put him in the White House and that and he's
[1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:09.240]  listening today to what's being said President Trump understands and okay IRS
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:14.040]  why do we still have the old Obama people in the IRS get rid of the IRS and
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:19.160]  investigate the Clinton Foundation why isn't call me under investigation he
[1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:23.920]  admitted he leaked he admitted he took Loretta Lynch's instructions on the
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:28.960]  tarmac to scale back the investigation why are the Democrats under
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:32.960]  investigation why don't we have the House and Senate committees bringing the
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:37.920]  Democrats in and explaining how they tried to rig the election we know that
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:41.160]  Hillary tried to rig the election they've got the Chinese and Russian
[1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:44.760]  connections they've got the IRS persecuting people he needs to turn the
[1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:49.880]  tables now right and take control of the powers the presidency has because
[1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:54.760]  again there are enormous powers there's this problem even the people under him
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:58.640]  refused to follow the orders they tell him they are then they call in his loyalist
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:03.080]  and fire them without even telling him they are in open rebellion and he's
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:06.680]  and Donald Trump's gonna say okay so the answer is get rid of previous get rid of
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:11.120]  all the Paul Ryan Lola's always got to fire his top tier and he's good and put
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:15.640]  the White House down to half the people in it because if you include too many
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:19.840]  people you're gonna include people in Washington we're gonna leak against you
[1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:24.400]  we're gonna undermine you we're not gonna deal with the policies Washington is
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:28.960]  different than New York and being president is different than being CEO
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:33.240]  and Donald Trump is coming to realize this people in Washington the first rule
[1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:37.080]  in Washington if somebody's telling you something they're lying exactly Trump
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:41.320]  thinks make America prosperous and make people money and have freedom and
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:44.640]  everybody feel good we'll be happy no we're not running a golf course we're
[1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:48.960]  not running a hotel the globalists want power they want to piss on Christians
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:53.840]  they want to piss on veterans they want power over strong good people because
[1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:58.280]  they're scumbags and you got a look to say okay Washington is about scumbags
[1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:03.080]  having victory over the good right and it's about okay previous previous has a
[1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:09.160]  meal ticket with the elite Republicans in Washington so if Donald Trump is
[1:43:09.160 --> 1:43:13.400]  impeached to remove from office previous has his next job he heads his bets
[1:43:13.400 --> 1:43:17.040]  which made him a trader from the beginning precisely and in Washington you
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:20.960]  gotta understand where people are gonna get paid and they haven't out if they
[1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:24.760]  think that they Ryan with the pharmaceutical companies and as putting
[1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:28.520]  money into his campaigns you know do you think he's really in support of
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:33.080]  reforming Obamacare when it benefits but we all know the Republican leadership
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:35.960]  is the big problem the Democrats are imploding they're a joke they're
[1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:40.040]  becoming a regional coastal party they're imploding the problem is the
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:43.880]  Republican leadership as I've always said wrote Obamacare they're even worse
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:47.480]  because they're competent they don't think islands are floating they don't
[1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:52.120]  they don't think George W. Bush is still in office they're a bunch of Ted Bundy
[1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:57.800]  slick psychopaths and I'm so sick you went about white males they're the white
[1:43:57.800 --> 1:44:01.240]  males I can't you want it we do have a white male problem and it's called the
[1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:05.720]  Republican leadership that is a bunch of trash and what's happening is
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:10.240]  communicating directly to the people which this the Alex Jones program has
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:14.560]  done for years goes just like Donald Trump why does he tweet because he goes
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:19.000]  directly to the people why is the Alex Jones programming effective because it
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:23.680]  goes directly to the people and that's why it's so threatening to the mainstream
[1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:28.480]  media which has CIA filters since Operation Mockingbird in the 50s and
[1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:32.120]  still wants to give out what about that paradigm because I'm not saying the
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:34.760]  agencies haven't done bad things and some of them are unconstitutional and
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:39.120]  should be reformed or abolished but most of folks in the CIA and FBI where I
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:43.720]  run into are like totally know what's going on or fighting this well it's
[1:44:43.720 --> 1:44:48.280]  it's a leadership it's bad it's again you've got the an element within the CIA
[1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:53.280]  that is globalist and has been globalist from the very British Empire set up the
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:58.920]  CIA out of the OSS out of skull and bones and Alex you know Alan Dulles the
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:04.800]  whole Alger Hiss forming the United Nations this was always Rockefellers
[1:45:04.800 --> 1:45:10.760]  deep within the CIA you know go these are people who were globalists from the
[1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:15.040]  very beginning and they didn't want free market they wanted multinationals
[1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:18.520]  above-the-law tax exempt everybody else under socialism or communism so they
[1:45:18.520 --> 1:45:22.040]  could have full control it's right if they were global government since the
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:26.720]  before World War two for those that don't know you know turn of the century
[1:45:26.720 --> 1:45:32.520]  the books of not just Huxley but also HD Wells the nonfiction he wrote the New
[1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:36.880]  World Order all these others they had a competing world empire model with the
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:41.000]  Nazis by the 30s and so if you go to the history books then this was not
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:44.800]  denied they had 10 regions of America it wasn't called FEMA but it's the same
[1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:49.360]  regions it wasn't denied that they had a global plan and that they were going to
[1:45:49.360 --> 1:45:53.080]  do all this I mean they had a plan that basically the robber barons hatched
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:57.240]  about 130 years ago to control populations that never stopped because so
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:01.760]  much money got put into it and from what you're listening on Federal Reserve
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:07.240]  created 1913 the whole League of Nations idea writing this war World War one
[1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:12.080]  pushing us into World War one all these things were globalist plans to
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:16.840]  ultimately come out and destroy sovereign nations now what's at stake
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:23.680]  today is you're seeing a dying structure CIA is losing its power because it's
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:28.760]  being exposed you're getting exposed within Washington the GOP establishment
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:31.800]  now Donald Trump's got to get him out of the White House it's got to take
[1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:37.680]  control of the agencies he's got a fire by half the people who are working in
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:41.520]  Washington and if listen to the little globalist snot noses who have been
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:45.120]  trained to hate America if you just realize that's conditioning and get out
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:49.800]  of the way you'll have prosperity morons just get out of humanity's way we
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:53.720]  don't want to kill you just get out of the way get out of the way get out
[1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:58.520]  Satan get behind me get out of the way the power of the presidency is enormous
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:01.960]  and Donald Trump's got to start wielding it I mean he's not going to use it maybe
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:05.680]  let us borrow it for a few days because I like to get rid of about half of the
[1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:09.520]  people in Washington I don't know what he's I mean he's done so much good in
[1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:13.200]  his actions well I don't know how he has so he's so bad about firing people I'm
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:16.720]  betting look he fired coming in all hell's breaking loose I am betting on
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:20.520]  Donald Trump down Trump I've always said looks like he's gonna lose right up
[1:47:20.520 --> 1:47:24.680]  until the time he wins don't always win speaking of that let's play some of the
[1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:29.120]  Nancy Pelosi ads again while the Democrats are now finally not being so
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:33.360]  arrogant and saying maybe we should get rid of someone that literally when my
[1:47:33.360 --> 1:47:39.400]  grandmother died a few months ago she was more cogent at 93 92 than Nancy
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:44.400]  Pelosi who clearly has like a rubber head and so much Botox and surgeries you
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:48.520]  know up there an insane clown woman who's made billions while she was in the
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:54.480]  Congress a total mafia you know maven and here she is this is what's defeating
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:59.480]  them is that people see the old evil decrepit slimy Democratic Party and not
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:04.960]  by old physically just old in their corrupt ways here it is liberal
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:09.880]  extremists will stop at nothing to push their radical agenda now they're
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:15.240]  turning their attention to Georgia and demanding that you vote for John Ossoff
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:21.680]  for Congress John Ossoff is one of them Ossoff will vote with Nancy Pelosi for
[1:48:21.680 --> 1:48:27.000]  more spending bigger government and a weaker military don't let them hijack
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:32.160]  our congressional seat stop Ossoff now congressional leadership fund is
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:36.800]  responsible for the content of this advertising now again the Democrats I've
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:40.200]  got the numbers here spent five to one ten to one in these last four races we've

[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:26.920]  happened to these people well they've just gotten more determined they can get
[1:57:26.920 --> 1:57:30.640]  more violent they're training people to go disrupt the town halls look at this
[1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:35.680]  every town hall with these democratic trained disruptors trying to prevent so
[1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:38.200]  we don't and they never say anything because they're robots they just do dumb
[1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:42.400]  chance we should all go to town halls and elegantly speak and they're trained
[1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:46.080]  to do this this is all Soros training they're recruited they're trained they're
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:49.240]  paid you can see violence in the street you're gonna see violent
[1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:54.600]  demonstrations wait until we get more Hispanic demonstrations on trying to get
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:59.120]  MS-13 out of the country which you know which you know Obama allowed to get in
[1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:03.360]  the country along with releasing from prisons illegal immigrants who are
[1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:08.160]  criminals this was a concerted half a million half a million concerted effort
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:13.880]  to cause America to be less safe more incidents I'm sure of radical Islamic
[1:58:13.880 --> 1:58:17.400]  terrorism and again under and that's what I meant to get to we're gonna get
[1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:21.720]  into what's happening in Europe the same model I mean it's so a model and they're
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:25.960]  bringing in a disruptive class into Europe because they want to destroy the
[1:58:25.960 --> 1:58:28.720]  peace and security of the Europeans because they want to bring a police
[1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:33.360]  aid in Theresa May once internet censorship and more she is some monster again
[1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:36.480]  it's not just left to send the enemy it's these fake conservatives that use
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:41.640]  Islam to take our liberties no no don't take our liberties take people in their
[1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:46.200]  nightgowns and their beekeeper suits and let them stay in their cesspit let them
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:49.440]  stay there chop their genitals off and crap on each other and throw gays off
[1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:53.480]  buildings more than two years ago info wars first told you about our research
[1:58:53.480 --> 1:58:57.120]  into what has been called the iodine conspiracy I've told you about how
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:01.440]  scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[1:59:01.440 --> 1:59:05.560]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:09.600]  adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took
[1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:14.200]  the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis
[1:59:14.200 --> 1:59:18.440]  worsened as it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare
[1:59:18.440 --> 1:59:23.680]  yourself and your family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed
[1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:28.280]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are
[1:59:28.280 --> 1:59:32.800]  now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you
[1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:36.200]  can pull these studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the
[1:59:36.200 --> 1:59:40.760]  truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen
[1:59:40.760 --> 1:59:46.440]  stock up on survival shield x2 today at info wars life dot com or by calling 888
[1:59:46.440 --> 1:59:56.840]  two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:56.840 --> 2:00:06.840]  you
[2:00:06.840 --> 2:00:13.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:56.400]  Also tonight, a soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an
[2:00:56.400 --> 2:01:02.720]  attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president
[2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:08.880]  from office, sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear
[2:01:08.880 --> 2:01:09.880]  and present danger.
[2:01:09.880 --> 2:01:12.880]  That is tonight's very important opening monologue.
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:19.040]  And then the Washington Post points out that basically the monologue, part of it is taken
[2:01:19.040 --> 2:01:23.400]  directly from my statement a month before, but it's not taken from my statement.
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:24.920]  This is what the president's discussing.
[2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:25.920]  He knows about this.
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:29.560]  And the times I've been blessed to speak to the president, this is what we talk about
[2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:30.560]  if people really want to know.
[2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:33.120]  I've never really told the media because I don't get into private discussions, but
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:35.640]  that's the president is aware of this.
[2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:37.640]  Larger sections of the military are aware.
[2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:43.120]  Most of the agencies, at least the folks that actually do the work, are aware.
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:47.880]  And a lot of the smart money is Trump's going to let them make their move and then sew up
[2:01:47.880 --> 2:01:51.080]  the whole group once they launch their operation.
[2:01:51.080 --> 2:01:54.400]  I think that they can't be aware of that and not do it.
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:01:55.400]  I think it's a dereliction of duty.
[2:01:55.400 --> 2:01:57.400]  I don't want to say the president's doing that.
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:01:58.800]  I don't want to challenge his strategy.
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:02.400]  He elected him because, I guess, in this one case, it's not a dereliction of duty, but
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:03.560]  it's the president.
[2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:05.760]  But I understand we don't want to be, like, fascist.
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:10.320]  But if they're calling for overthrow, murder, death, overthrowing elections, having a Homeland
[2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:14.560]  Security dictatorship, then the FBI being the fourth branch of government, then the
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:19.080]  president really has to move and understand first he's got to get rid of all the traders
[2:02:19.080 --> 2:02:20.080]  and then move.
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:23.880]  But if they're all just in mutiny against him, knowing that's his move and they all
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:25.680]  just ignore his orders, what do we do?
[2:02:25.680 --> 2:02:29.480]  Well, basically, I mean, let's look at this whole Comey situation.
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:34.280]  It is a, first of all, this is a coup d'etat, is an attempt to remove the president of the
[2:02:34.280 --> 2:02:35.280]  United States.
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:36.280]  Isn't it big to have Hannity saying that?
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:37.280]  And it's terrific.
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:44.000]  I'm proud of Hannity to come forward and say this, and it does risk his career at Fox.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.440]  Hannity is finally getting on the front lines on this.
[2:02:47.440 --> 2:02:49.600]  And look, Comey's fired, okay?
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:51.600]  And so the mainstream media goes nuts.
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:52.600]  Who cares?
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:53.640]  Unplug them.
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:55.280]  Get them out of the press room.
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:57.600]  Let them ask their questions of each other.
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:02:58.720]  Ignore them.
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:02:59.920]  Mainstream media isn't being listened to.
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:02.120]  They're dying legacy industry.
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:04.640]  Who cares what the mainstream media says?
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:05.960]  Fire these people.
[2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:08.000]  Take control of the government because-
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.080]  What does he do if they try to kill him?
[2:03:10.080 --> 2:03:13.200]  Well, that's the next thing he'll try to do.
[2:03:13.200 --> 2:03:15.560]  And I've been warning about that for a long time.
[2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:16.560]  And you-
[2:03:16.560 --> 2:03:18.640]  I think, I mean, I'm telling you, they take shots of them or something.
[2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:20.800]  All people that have been calling for his death and ignoring him.
[2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:24.880]  And I think under national security, we arrest the top thousand of these people.
[2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:28.560]  And look, what's the secret service the Department of Justice is doing?
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:32.880]  People call up congressmen and give them death threats and they don't get an investigative-
[2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:34.120]  And they have their phone number.
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:35.120]  They don't get investigated.
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:36.640]  What's the Department of Justice doing?
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:38.840]  Go out and investigate these people.
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:03:40.920]  People who are threatened the president are committing a crime.
[2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:44.640]  But the Justice Department has been packed for decades with globalists.
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:45.640]  And get rid of them.
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:53.840]  It's, you know, CIA, Cord Meyer, he was a world globalist early on in the 1949-50 period.
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:56.120]  The CIA has been packed with globalists.
[2:03:56.120 --> 2:03:59.120]  The whole agenda has been to destroy the United States.
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:00.120]  And Obama-
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  And Kennedy got rid of Cord Meyer, and he was one of the main guys.
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  Look, E. Howard Hunt named Cord Meyer-
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:07.760]  Yeah, but didn't Kennedy have sex with Cord Meyer's wife?
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:08.760]  Well, yes.
[2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:09.760]  That was one reason he wanted to.
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:12.280]  I mean, Kennedy did have sex with most people's wives.
[2:04:12.280 --> 2:04:13.800]  Well, he actually did.
[2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:19.640]  But, you know, Mary Myers was killed then afterwards after the assassination of Jack Kennedy.
[2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:20.640]  She was offed.
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:21.640]  Look, the CIA-
[2:04:21.640 --> 2:04:23.960]  You know, it was just a bench warmer on the operation.
[2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:24.960]  Right.
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:25.960]  What did you make of E. Howard Hunt's deathbed confession?
[2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:28.040]  Well, I thought there was a lot of truth to it.
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:29.040]  He was very a photograph.
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:30.040]  Yeah, I think there's a lot.
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:32.480]  Yes, he can be seen at the assassination site.
[2:04:32.480 --> 2:04:33.720]  I'm confident of it.
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:34.720]  I've seen the photos.
[2:04:34.720 --> 2:04:37.440]  But look, this is deadly serious stuff.
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:41.160]  And Donald Trump has got to protect himself by getting a hold of the government.
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:44.040]  Well, I'm just saying, they're openly in sedition saying, over the other government,
[2:04:44.040 --> 2:04:45.040]  kill everybody.
[2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:47.400]  They've got communists marching over the guns out.
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:48.720]  They're killing cops.
[2:04:48.720 --> 2:04:49.720]  I mean, I-
[2:04:49.720 --> 2:04:51.960]  They go, you're Mr. Anti-Police State.
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:52.960]  Now, you want to-
[2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:53.960]  No!
[2:04:53.960 --> 2:04:54.960]  The police state comes.
[2:04:54.960 --> 2:04:55.960]  We let them win.
[2:04:55.960 --> 2:04:59.960]  We have to move against this cancer with the police.
[2:04:59.960 --> 2:05:02.040]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa.
[2:05:02.040 --> 2:05:05.640]  And one of the people in attendance, our anonymous sources say, was Bill Clinton.
[2:05:05.640 --> 2:05:07.160]  Well, how do we know it was Bill Clinton?
[2:05:07.160 --> 2:05:10.200]  Because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:14.040]  and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field by a deranged Bernie supporter,
[2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:16.920]  Democratic operatives began blowing their Bill Clinton rape whistles.
[2:05:16.920 --> 2:05:21.920]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous
[2:05:21.920 --> 2:05:27.520]  friend, somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise.
[2:05:27.520 --> 2:05:28.520]  Right?
[2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:31.160]  Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt a president as he was sending
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:33.920]  out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot.
[2:05:33.920 --> 2:05:34.920]  Right?
[2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:35.920]  Come on, work with me here.
[2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:37.400]  The Democrats can't even protest right.
[2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:38.560]  These people fail at everything.
[2:05:38.560 --> 2:05:42.920]  They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[2:05:42.920 --> 2:05:43.920]  It's just as Trump said.
[2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:44.920]  Never fails.
[2:05:44.920 --> 2:05:46.920]  Never fails.
[2:05:46.920 --> 2:05:50.360]  You can check out the video on infowars.com.
[2:05:50.360 --> 2:05:53.920]  Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise.
[2:05:53.920 --> 2:05:56.680]  And that part about Bill Clinton being in the audience, that was fake news.
[2:05:56.680 --> 2:06:00.920]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[2:06:00.920 --> 2:06:04.760]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[2:06:04.760 --> 2:06:09.640]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[2:06:09.640 --> 2:06:12.360]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:18.720]  Sixty years ago, when foreign airforces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[2:06:18.720 --> 2:06:21.240]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[2:06:21.240 --> 2:06:25.560]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[2:06:25.560 --> 2:06:30.200]  Pathanogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[2:06:30.200 --> 2:06:31.200]  vitality.
[2:06:31.200 --> 2:06:35.240]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[2:06:35.240 --> 2:06:38.760]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[2:06:38.760 --> 2:06:46.680]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[2:06:46.680 --> 2:06:50.360]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[2:06:50.360 --> 2:06:52.880]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[2:06:52.880 --> 2:06:57.760]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com
[2:06:57.760 --> 2:06:59.320]  with Anthroplex.
[2:06:59.320 --> 2:07:03.040]  A new shipment of Biotrusillinium is now available at infowarslife.com.
[2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:04.920]  We've been sold out for months.
[2:07:04.920 --> 2:07:10.040]  For one-of-a-kind infowarslife, Biotrusillinium formula is now back at stockininfowarslife.com.
[2:07:10.040 --> 2:07:13.880]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the pharmaceutical industry to its
[2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:14.880]  core.
[2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:18.680]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:23.800]  But Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[2:07:23.800 --> 2:07:27.320]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[2:07:27.320 --> 2:07:32.320]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production in eyesight, Biotrusillinium
[2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:37.480]  is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support
[2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:39.520]  a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:44.400]  Visit infowarslife.com to order your bottle of Biotrusillinium before we sell out again.
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:48.720]  That's infowarslife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help
[2:07:48.720 --> 2:07:53.480]  yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360W.
[2:07:53.480 --> 2:07:55.600]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[2:07:55.600 --> 2:07:57.120]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:10.320]  This is infowarslife.com.
[2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:12.440]  He never gives up.
[2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:18.600]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:26.880]  Well, Karen Handel won a fourth special election despite record democratic money in any election
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:30.480]  ever spent to defeat her.
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:34.160]  Still, John Ossoff lost.
[2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:35.400]  What does this tell us?
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:37.320]  Well, we know the polls are fake.
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:38.320]  Trump's way above 50%.
[2:08:38.320 --> 2:08:41.600]  They're doing a 9% to 15% sampling rate higher for Democrats.
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:43.360]  They're calling people on landlines.
[2:08:43.360 --> 2:08:44.360]  They already have indexed.
[2:08:44.360 --> 2:08:45.680]  They know we're Democrats.
[2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:49.200]  I think Trump's got 60% support as long as the stock market holds.
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:53.800]  The problem is there's major underlying economic, global financial problems.
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:56.720]  We've got the new, you know, main streets having problems.
[2:08:56.720 --> 2:09:00.360]  We've got the commercial real estate beginning to implode.
[2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:02.600]  Amazon's a big part of that.
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:06.040]  So as Ron Paul said like a month ago, he said, Trump's doing great with his policies on
[2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:08.360]  the economy, in my view, but too little, too late.
[2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:13.400]  Now, somebody who was the chief advisor to Ron Paul on his presidential campaign when
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:17.040]  it came to finance is Peter Schiff, Billions Under Management at EuroPAC.com.
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:22.720]  And of course, no stranger to this show or cable TV or broadcast TV, you name it.
[2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:28.720]  And so I want to get his nuanced take on this because look, I want to cheerlead the economy.
[2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:32.200]  And I see Trump bringing back a lot of jobs and in the exuberance of the stock market,
[2:09:32.200 --> 2:09:36.240]  but underlying globally, a lot of problems.
[2:09:36.240 --> 2:09:40.320]  And so we'll get Peter Schiff's take on that right to shut down his daughter Jerome Corsi.
[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:43.360]  So Peter Schiff, where do you think we are right now?
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:49.320]  Well, you know, nice to see Alex spent a while, but you know, I think candidate Trump had
[2:09:49.320 --> 2:09:54.440]  a lot better or more accurate view of the US economy than President Trump because candidate
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:10:00.000]  Trump was a lot more accurate in criticizing the phony numbers that the government used
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.840]  to try to paint a rosy picture of the economy.
[2:10:02.840 --> 2:10:09.160]  He was very critical of the way the government measured and reported unemployment, inflation,
[2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:12.840]  and of course, he called the stock market a big fat, ugly bubble.
[2:10:12.840 --> 2:10:18.000]  He recognized the consequence of the cheap money policies of the Fed and that the stock
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:21.760]  market was not a good barometer of the overall economy.
[2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:24.880]  And on that, you know, that's what got him elected.
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:30.680]  I mean, that resonated with the public that had been spoon fed nonsense by the administration
[2:10:30.680 --> 2:10:34.120]  about how great the economy was when they knew it was lousy.
[2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:38.280]  And now Trump is president and he is spoon feeding the same nonsense.
[2:10:38.280 --> 2:10:42.840]  We haven't had a huge turnaround in the economy since he's been elected.
[2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:44.920]  There has been an improvement in sentiment.
[2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:48.840]  There are people who believe that things are going to get better because they remain hopeful
[2:10:48.840 --> 2:10:50.240]  that things are going to happen.
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:51.640]  But nothing has actually happened.
[2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:52.640]  Sure.
[2:10:52.640 --> 2:10:55.480]  But Peter, Peter, clearly, though, trying to get rid of the carbon taxes, trying to get
[2:10:55.480 --> 2:10:58.760]  coal back, trying to get rid of the regulations to make us more competitive.
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:01.480]  I think that's why the stock market said, I agree, if we don't have a real economy,
[2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:04.480]  then we have a big stock market, then it is just a bubble.
[2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:09.000]  But I mean, the Democrats are actively trying to drive down the market to discredit him.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:13.480]  So I get that you're right and overall as a purist, but I'm saying, aren't you glad
[2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:15.520]  that at least we're having some success?
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:16.840]  I don't think we're having success.
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:22.240]  I think, yes, we're having success in not having even more failure than we might have
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:24.960]  if Hillary Clinton were president or if Obama.
[2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:25.960]  Well, exactly.
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:28.960]  So has Trump been given almost like a sinking ship?
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:31.240]  Yes, he has been given a sinking ship.
[2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:35.560]  I wish he would level with the public that it is sinking because he's now claiming that
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:36.640]  it's seaworthy.
[2:11:36.640 --> 2:11:40.800]  The problem is it's going down and when he's at the helm, if he's telling us how great
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:43.920]  it is and then it goes down, he's going to get the blame for it.
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:46.520]  I'm not even pessimistic.
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:51.360]  He needs to point out that the ship is still sinking and it needs serious repair.
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:52.760]  And so far, we're not doing it.
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:53.760]  Dr. Corsi?
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:57.840]  Well, I mean, I think I want to give Donald Trump credit for a couple of things.
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:02.880]  I think these regulations are very important to get rid of the EPA regulations, to get
[2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:05.240]  the economy so it can move.
[2:12:05.240 --> 2:12:09.160]  The whole emphasis on bringing jobs back to the United States.
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:13.080]  Actually the Federal Reserve is trying to stack the deck against President Trump raising
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:14.080]  interest rates.
[2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:18.640]  It's going to be critical that Trump gets disciplined on Congress, gets a hold of the
[2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:27.000]  RNC money so that they can't have these guaranteed funds for the RNC to run for reelection and
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.680]  pushes through a major tax reform.
[2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:30.680]  It's going to be critical.
[2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:31.680]  Well, sure.
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:32.680]  I want to ask Peter about that.
[2:12:32.680 --> 2:12:34.920]  But undoubtedly, Trump wanted low interest rates.
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:39.640]  I was against him because it hurts real investors, but if the globalists gave themselves free
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:43.400]  interest forever and economies and cardiac arrests want to have a few years of low interest
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:48.000]  rates, so if Yellen is about to raise rates again and that hurts the overall recovery,
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:52.080]  then why hasn't he removed Yellen or does Peter think we should go ahead and raise rates
[2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:53.360]  and then that gets into the tax cuts?
[2:12:53.360 --> 2:12:54.360]  Go ahead, Peter.
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:56.320]  Well, first of all, he can't remove her yet.
[2:12:56.320 --> 2:12:58.440]  I mean, her term is going to expire at some point.
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:00.240]  He doesn't have to re-nominate her.
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:01.760]  He can nominate somebody else.
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:07.080]  But it's interesting that during the entire term where Obama was president, the Fed really
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:08.360]  only raised rates once.
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:12.280]  I mean, they raised them a second time, but that's after the election.
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:15.600]  Since Trump was elected, they've already had three rate hikes, and they're planning on
[2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:16.600]  doing more.
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:18.960]  But the low interest rates were part of the problem.
[2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:23.400]  The Fed needs to raise interest rates, but when they do that, the economy is going to
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:24.400]  collapse.
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:26.080]  The whole bubble, the recovery was phony.
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:29.060]  We don't want to keep the phony recovery going.
[2:13:29.060 --> 2:13:33.280]  We want to let it implode so we can have a real recovery built on a solid foundation.
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:36.480]  Sure, but Trump's argument is we only gave the bubble to the elites.
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:39.080]  Why not give some bubble to the people?
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:40.440]  Well, the people don't want a bubble.
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:42.280]  They want genuine prosperity.
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:45.600]  They don't want to be deluded into thinking that things are getting better as they're
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  actually getting worse.
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:51.040]  The only way to have a real recovery is going to have, we need massive cuts in government
[2:13:51.040 --> 2:13:52.040]  spending.
[2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:54.360]  And Donald Trump wants to increase government spending.
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:55.840]  He's talking about spending more money.
[2:13:55.840 --> 2:13:59.120]  But see, his argument is it's a tax cut to slash regulations.
[2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:01.800]  I mean, isn't that one of the purest tax cuts there is?
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:04.160]  Well, look, we need to get rid of regulations.
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:05.400]  And I wish we could.
[2:14:05.400 --> 2:14:07.240]  Look, we can't even get rid of Obamacare.
[2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:09.760]  I mean, they want to replace it with something that's almost as bad.
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:10.760]  It might even be worse.
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:11.760]  No, no, I agree with you.
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:12.960]  That's the one big ding on Trump.
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:16.320]  That's the one big ding is this Obamacare thing has not been a real reform so far.
[2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:18.320]  So let me ask you this, Peter Schiff.
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:21.840]  What do you think would have happened if Hillary was in with her policy she was saying?
[2:14:21.840 --> 2:14:25.320]  And then A, and then B, what do you think Trump should do?
[2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:30.280]  Well, look, I think if Hillary had won a lot of the optimism surrounding the prospect
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:34.060]  of lower taxes and deregulation wouldn't be there.
[2:14:34.060 --> 2:14:38.720]  And my guess is that the Fed that claims to be data dependent would not have been raising
[2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:41.520]  interest rates in the face of this horrible data.
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:44.440]  So I do think that politics are playing a role here.
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:48.440]  And I think a reason that the Fed is ignoring the weak data is because they're not afraid
[2:14:48.440 --> 2:14:50.960]  of collapsing the bubble on Trump's watch.
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:51.960]  Incredible.
[2:14:51.960 --> 2:14:55.640]  They're on Obama's or Hillary Clinton's.
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:58.320]  But I do believe that the Fed is going to go back to their old tricks.
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:04.120]  I mean, once this economy is obviously in recession, once the numbers clearly reveal
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:05.120]  that we are back in recession.
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:06.360]  Yeah, they want to have the cake needed, too.
[2:15:06.360 --> 2:15:09.760]  They want to hurt Trump and then bring back your 100% debt on.
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:11.600]  So tell us what else you think they're going to do, Peter Schiff.
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:17.200]  Well, I said once we go back into recession and they can maybe blame it on Trump, especially
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:22.480]  since Trump has made the mistake of pinning his presidency on the stock market or this
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:26.000]  economy when the economy tanks and the stock market tanks.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:29.320]  And now the Fed could try to save it and say, look, look what Donald Trump did.
[2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:31.600]  He wrecked this great economy.
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:33.240]  And now we have to come bail him out.
[2:15:33.240 --> 2:15:34.480]  We have to do more QE.
[2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:36.160]  We have to cut interest rates.
[2:15:36.160 --> 2:15:41.560]  And that may lay a foundation for Democrats to run against Trump and how he wrecked the
[2:15:41.560 --> 2:15:43.640]  economy in the midterm elections.
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:47.160]  And then again, in the president for 2020.
[2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:48.160]  That's the plan.
[2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:49.160]  That's total veritas.
[2:15:49.160 --> 2:15:50.880]  I'm going to get out of course, his brief take on that.
[2:15:50.880 --> 2:15:55.600]  But pulling back, what are they going to do losing all these special elections?
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:15:56.600]  People hate them.
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:15:58.600]  They're the new regional party of the coastlines.
[2:15:58.600 --> 2:15:59.600]  That's their answer.
[2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:05.160]  You can see it in the Federal Reserve's political actions, tank the economy, blame it on Trump.
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:09.960]  And then in 2018, have the Democrats take back the House of the Senate, Peter?
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:12.560]  Yeah, remember, though, they're not tanking a real economy.
[2:16:12.560 --> 2:16:16.040]  They're pricking their own bubble, and then they're going to try to refull it with air.
[2:16:16.040 --> 2:16:17.040]  But it's not going to work.
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:20.800]  See, that's what I think is going to backfire on them.
[2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:24.160]  When they attempt to reflate this bubble, it's not going to work.
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:26.000]  That's what's going to bring on the dollar crisis.
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.120]  The dollar's going to tank.
[2:16:28.120 --> 2:16:29.600]  Inflation is going to run out of control.
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:30.600]  I agree.
[2:16:30.600 --> 2:16:31.760]  And this is all going to happen.
[2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:34.080]  It should have happened years ago, but it didn't.
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:36.320]  We were able to delay the day of reckoning.
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:40.120]  And Barack Obama got out of dodge, and his whole House of Cards is going to come down
[2:16:40.120 --> 2:16:41.600]  around Donald Trump.
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:45.880]  That's why, again, I wish that he was more, you know, leveled with the public about the
[2:16:45.880 --> 2:16:46.880]  gravity's problem.
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:49.400]  Sure, but imagine being him.
[2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:52.880]  He knows they're going to blame him, and all he's trying to do is prop it up, and while
[2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:57.440]  he gets industry back so that there is something there when it all implodes, that's more of
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:16:58.440]  a soft landing.
[2:16:58.440 --> 2:17:01.200]  Or are you saying that the bubble is bigger?
[2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:02.200]  There is no soft landing.
[2:17:02.200 --> 2:17:03.200]  It's a crash landing.
[2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:06.280]  I mean, what we have to do is make sure we can even walk away from the crash.
[2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:10.680]  But he needs to level with the American public on the degree that we need to sacrifice.
[2:17:10.680 --> 2:17:14.000]  He can't keep saying that we're going to increase defense spending.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:15.120]  We're too broke for that.
[2:17:15.120 --> 2:17:17.680]  He can't keep promising more money for infrastructure.
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:18.680]  We don't have it.
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:20.120]  We need to make cuts to entitlements.
[2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:22.720]  He can't say Social Security and Medicare are off the table.
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:23.720]  They have to be on the table.
[2:17:23.720 --> 2:17:24.720]  Yeah, that was bad a few weeks ago.
[2:17:24.720 --> 2:17:25.720]  We want to make a move.
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:30.600]  I mean, he's like, you know, I have a big heart, so this Obamacare is going to have a bunch
[2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:31.600]  of free stuff in it.
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:32.600]  We don't have the money.
[2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:39.480]  Well, I mean, again, Peter's right also that the entire bubble was created by Obama with
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:45.500]  zero interest rates and this quantitative easing, which people don't realize is the Fed's balance
[2:17:45.500 --> 2:17:49.400]  sheet ballooned with the Fed buying treasury debt.
[2:17:49.400 --> 2:17:56.320]  We bought our own debt in order to keep the Obama doubling the national debt to $20 trillion.
[2:17:56.320 --> 2:17:59.400]  It was a huge ride on borrowed money.
[2:17:59.400 --> 2:18:01.700]  Let me ask Peter this then.
[2:18:01.700 --> 2:18:03.200]  What's your timetable hypothetically?
[2:18:03.200 --> 2:18:04.200]  And what do you see happening?
[2:18:04.200 --> 2:18:08.560]  Well, look, you know, now the Fed is promising quantitative tightening, right?
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:13.520]  So while the Fed was monetizing the Obama deficits, they don't want to monetize the
[2:18:13.520 --> 2:18:14.520]  Trump deficits.
[2:18:14.520 --> 2:18:18.880]  They want to make the Trump deficits even bigger by forcing the Trump administration
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:23.920]  not only to have to finance the national debt, the budget deficits, but to borrow enough money
[2:18:23.920 --> 2:18:28.440]  to repay all the money the Fed borrowed when Obama was so clearly the elites are against
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:29.440]  Trump.
[2:18:29.440 --> 2:18:30.440]  Clearly the elites are against Trump.
[2:18:30.440 --> 2:18:31.440]  What do you think you should do?
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:35.800]  Well, look, he needs to call him out on it again, and he needs to level with the public
[2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:38.160]  about the severity of this bubble.
[2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:39.160]  He can't talk.
[2:18:39.160 --> 2:18:42.080]  He can't be claiming credit for the stock market going up.
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:46.400]  He can't be touting these government phony unemployment numbers as if he's a successful
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:48.840]  president because the unemployment rate is down.
[2:18:48.840 --> 2:18:51.840]  The unemployment rate was falling the whole time Obama was president.
[2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:52.840]  It is meaningless.
[2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:57.440]  He needs to go back to what got him elected and stop being a politician and actually get
[2:18:57.440 --> 2:19:02.040]  to the root cause of the problem and use the bully pulpit to get the public ready for what
[2:19:02.040 --> 2:19:05.040]  really needs to be done to clean up this mess.
[2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:06.840]  Let's start draining the swamp.
[2:19:06.840 --> 2:19:10.600]  You're right, we don't want him to become the swamp.
[2:19:10.600 --> 2:19:13.080]  So how would you grade Trump right now, Peter Schiff?
[2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:17.240]  Well, you know, I'm not giving him a good grade because, you know, he's not doing what
[2:19:17.240 --> 2:19:18.240]  needs to be done.
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:24.240]  I mean, I'm not going to, you know, he's, he's, he's obviously got all kinds of criticism
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:26.040]  coming out of from all angles.
[2:19:26.040 --> 2:19:27.520]  The media is all over him.
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:31.840]  I mean, obviously if they were treating President Obama like this, I mean, I mean, they couldn't
[2:19:31.840 --> 2:19:32.840]  do it all be racism.
[2:19:32.840 --> 2:19:33.840]  Yeah.
[2:19:33.840 --> 2:19:34.840]  Yeah.
[2:19:34.840 --> 2:19:35.840]  It's not fair.
[2:19:35.840 --> 2:19:36.840]  It's not.
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:38.560]  But he inherited a disaster.
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:43.640]  He's not doing what I want him to do to try to help, you know, make America great.
[2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:46.480]  Let's talk about when we come back, how we make America great again.
[2:19:46.480 --> 2:19:50.160]  All I know is TPP killed, you know, getting this out of the climate thing.
[2:19:50.160 --> 2:19:52.840]  I mean, he's done a lot of good stuff securing the border.
[2:19:52.840 --> 2:19:53.840]  Stay there, Peter Schiff.
[2:19:53.840 --> 2:19:56.000]  We'll come back at your take on that.
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:19:59.840]  But you're right about some of the other economic stuff.
[2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:01.480]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:06.280]  And I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.

[2:20:36.560 --> 2:20:40.680]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[2:20:40.680 --> 2:20:45.400]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.
[2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:49.240]  More incredibly delicious water now and in an emergency.

[2:21:20.760 --> 2:21:23.200]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:24.840]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[2:21:24.840 --> 2:21:28.640]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[2:21:28.640 --> 2:21:29.640]  It's amazing.

[2:23:58.120 --> 2:24:08.880]  All right, Colonel Anthony Schaefer was always amazing inside Intel, joining us with the
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:11.880]  breakdown of the Democratic plan to basically bring in martial law.
[2:24:11.880 --> 2:24:13.160]  Sean Hannity's been covering it.
[2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:14.560]  The Democrats have been subraising.
[2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:17.160]  They've talked about it in major policy papers.
[2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:21.880]  They've got former deputy defense secretaries making the rounds in the news, trying to sell
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:22.880]  the idea.
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:23.880]  It's just insane.
[2:24:23.880 --> 2:24:27.120]  Because they all know a big collapse is coming and I guess they want to blame Trump and start
[2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:28.520]  some civil unrest.
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:30.280]  Soros is out there pushing it.
[2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:33.760]  The head of EuroPak.com, Peter Schiff, is our guest.
[2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:37.520]  Ron Paul said, if I get elected president, I'm not a dictator, we've got to wean people
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:39.880]  off a big government, it's going to take a while.
[2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:43.840]  I'm not an apologist for Trump and I'm not disagreeing with Schiff, I think he's right.
[2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:45.480]  But I'm a realist.
[2:24:45.480 --> 2:24:49.040]  When you see the elite against Trump, you see the powers that be trying to block him,
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:50.040]  what does he do?
[2:24:50.040 --> 2:24:51.280]  Come in and just let the economy totally implode?
[2:24:51.280 --> 2:24:54.160]  I mean, I understand at some point the bubble has to go down.
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:24:58.240]  But I mean, Peter Schiff, Schiff quantify what you're saying for us.
[2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:03.240]  Well, what I'm saying is that the air is going to come out of this bubble, just like it did
[2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:04.600]  on George Bush.
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:09.880]  Remember, the Fed inflated that phony recovery when it blew up the housing bubble.
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:14.680]  And that bubble though, didn't survive the second term of Bush.
[2:25:14.680 --> 2:25:17.440]  It blew up while Bush was still president.
[2:25:17.440 --> 2:25:22.080]  And that's what helped Barack Obama become president because people didn't want to vote
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:23.080]  for McCain.
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:25.680]  Did they purposely deflate it to get Obama elected?
[2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:30.880]  No, I don't think that they are that smart that they can time it and orchestrate it the
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:34.040]  way, they just got lucky that it happened before.
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:38.000]  Sure, because they're trying to stop Trump's stock market right now, it's not worrying.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:41.680]  Well, they're raising interest rates, they're announcing quantitative easing.
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:45.560]  Yeah, you're right, I think they're doing things that you would think would make the
[2:25:45.560 --> 2:25:46.800]  stock market go down.
[2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:51.080]  I'm really not sure what's keeping it up, to the extent that maybe the market doesn't
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:53.920]  believe the Fed, that they think that they're bluffing, that they're not going to carry
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:54.920]  out with this quantitative.
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:25:56.800]  I think people want to make America great again.
[2:25:56.800 --> 2:26:00.080]  I think they're betting on America and just saying, you know what, this is my only vote
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:02.080]  is money and I'm doubling down.
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:05.280]  Yeah, but the market is already extremely expensive.
[2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:08.360]  It's not like you have a cheap market and you can make a good deal of America.
[2:26:08.360 --> 2:26:11.720]  Amazon like 180 something to its earnings.
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:15.720]  Yeah, but I mean the overall market, forget about just Amazon, just look at the overall
[2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:22.840]  S&P 500, we haven't had valuations this high since the bubble in 1999, 2000 and look how
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:23.840]  that ended.
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:28.200]  But the point is that the Fed did this, the market is a creation of the Fed, it's all
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:32.280]  about cheap money and liquidity and if they withdraw that, then the market's going to
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:33.280]  come down.
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:36.880]  It's only a question of time and it's going to come down hard and who's going to get blamed
[2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:42.040]  for it and since Trump has already said, look, the market is going up, that means I'm doing
[2:26:42.040 --> 2:26:43.120]  a good job.
[2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:44.120]  This is a barometer for my president.
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:45.800]  He's already set himself up.
[2:26:45.800 --> 2:26:46.800]  That's a good point.
[2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:47.800]  Yes, that means he owns it.
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:51.440]  When the market comes down, now it's well, it's because you're a failed president.
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:52.440]  Look, the market's going down.
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:54.440]  He has, he has panned himself into a corner.
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:55.440]  He has panned himself.
[2:26:55.440 --> 2:27:00.920]  Yeah, to be judged by and of course, you know, he's taking credit for the low unemployment
[2:27:00.920 --> 2:27:01.920]  rate.
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:02.920]  He shouldn't be doing that.
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:05.440]  He should be accurately talking about the fact that Americans have lousy jobs.
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:09.760]  You should be saying your exuberance, you made the market go up and you believe that
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:13.040]  I've already done all this to get jobs back, but globally they're trying to beat me.
[2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:14.720]  They're raising rates to hurt you.
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:17.200]  So if it goes down, they get the blame.
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:21.600]  Yeah, they will get the blame, but ultimately rates have to go up anyway.
[2:27:21.600 --> 2:27:25.560]  If we're ever going to have a real economy, the stock market has to come down.
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:27.360]  That's part of the recovery.
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:32.120]  So instead of saying, hey, the stock market going up shows I'm a good president.
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:37.040]  The stock market coming down means that he's doing things that will actually help the economy.
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:41.280]  We need asset prices to fall because we have to let interest rates rise.
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:42.840]  We have to default on debt.
[2:27:42.840 --> 2:27:44.880]  But it's like putting your shoulder back in the socket.
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:46.960]  We know we need to do it, but it's not going to feel good.
[2:27:46.960 --> 2:27:51.560]  And Peter, I think, you know, I agree with him and I have agreed with him for years.
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:56.720]  I mean, I was opposed to the quantitative easing and all the $20 trillion in debt and
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:27:59.040]  all the increases in federal spending.
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:02.960]  I just think that, you know, look, Trump is dealing with the food stamps.
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:04.600]  He's getting people off the food stamps.
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:07.480]  He's reducing the number of illegal immigrants in the country.
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:11.840]  He's going to have to deal with these programs, not overnight, because you can't just cut
[2:28:11.840 --> 2:28:12.840]  them off.
[2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:13.840]  Yeah, let's admit that.
[2:28:13.840 --> 2:28:18.040]  He's already done a lot of good stuff when it comes to sovereignty, militarily.
[2:28:18.040 --> 2:28:20.480]  I mean, I think Trump, I mean, let's give him credit on that.
[2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:21.480]  I mean, I'm not being the truth.
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:22.480]  No, he is.
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:26.920]  There are some good things that he has done on the margins, but you're talking about we
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:29.480]  have a terminally ill patient here.
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:33.160]  And if you clear up some of his acne that he might have, I mean, sure, okay.
[2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:37.920]  So now he's going to be a nicer looking corpse, but we have more important ailments, right?
[2:28:37.920 --> 2:28:38.920]  That we have to.
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:39.920]  Sure.
[2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:43.320]  America has bone cancer and we're trying to fix some eczema that in closing, again,
[2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:46.920]  the head of Europe Pacific Capital, Peter Schiff, what's your prognosis?
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:47.920]  How long either way?
[2:28:47.920 --> 2:28:49.680]  I mean, how long can they push this bubble?
[2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:53.120]  Well, look, it's already, they've already gone on a lot longer than I would have thought
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:56.360]  if we were having this conversation five years ago, 10 years ago.
[2:28:56.360 --> 2:28:59.160]  So we're, look, we're living on borrowed money, literally.
[2:28:59.160 --> 2:29:00.160]  I don't know.
[2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:02.360]  I think we're getting closer and closer.
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:06.560]  And now that Trump is the fall guy, it seems like it makes a lot of sense for a lot of
[2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:10.320]  reasons that it's going to happen soon over the next couple of years.
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:13.360]  So again, people need to prepare, you know, get your gold.
[2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:18.320]  I mean, gold is still below 1,300, 1,260, help, you know, I'm investing money for people
[2:29:18.320 --> 2:29:19.840]  outside the United States.
[2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:25.760]  The dollar is near a six month low, but it's still near a 14 year high, you know, we surrender
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:29.480]  all of the Trump gains in the dollar, but it still has a long way to fall.
[2:29:29.480 --> 2:29:33.440]  That means Americans can still invest their dollars overseas and go into Singapore, New
[2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:38.320]  Zealand, Switzerland, Hong Kong, other markets, get into Peter Schaff, Europe's Pacific
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:39.320]  Capital.
[2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:40.320]  Thank you.
[2:29:40.320 --> 2:29:41.320]  We'll be back with Colonel Schaffer.
[2:29:41.320 --> 2:29:42.320]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:43.320]  This is big news coming up.
[2:29:43.320 --> 2:29:44.320]  That was powerful info, though.
[2:29:44.320 --> 2:29:47.080]  They are trying to sabotage the Trump recovery, but you agree with his policies or not.
[2:29:47.080 --> 2:29:48.920]  That's the big takeaway.
[2:29:48.920 --> 2:29:52.720]  We're on the March, the Empire's on the run.
[2:29:52.720 --> 2:30:03.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out
[2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:04.320]  of the EU.
[2:30:04.320 --> 2:30:08.600]  Scott Keller, a German member of the European Parliament and of the Green Party, said we
[2:30:08.600 --> 2:30:13.200]  should transplant entire villages from Syria to Germany, and that would encourage more
[2:30:13.200 --> 2:30:14.960]  migrants to enter Germany.
[2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:16.280]  Listen to these quotes.
[2:30:16.280 --> 2:30:21.720]  The idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example, if refugees don't
[2:30:21.720 --> 2:30:24.520]  want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees.
[2:30:24.520 --> 2:30:29.040]  People would rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:30.040]  easier.
[2:30:30.040 --> 2:30:31.920]  Let's look at these three compatriots.
[2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:35.520]  From Paul Joseph Watson, Sweden, migrants viciously beat disabled man while calling
[2:30:35.520 --> 2:30:36.520]  him racist.
[2:30:36.520 --> 2:30:40.760]  Three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station
[2:30:40.760 --> 2:30:42.640]  during an incident which took place last month.
[2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:46.080]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut, as one of
[2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:50.000]  the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:51.920]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[2:30:51.920 --> 2:30:55.120]  You can read both articles now on Infowars.com.
[2:30:55.120 --> 2:31:24.120]  Drive to reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[2:31:25.120 --> 2:31:50.640]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:53.840]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:58.640]  Read out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:31:58.640 --> 2:32:03.440]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[2:32:03.440 --> 2:32:05.280]  in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:32:05.280 --> 2:32:08.080]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[2:32:08.080 --> 2:32:10.160]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[2:32:10.160 --> 2:32:14.360]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their

[2:33:44.880 --> 2:33:52.280]  nightmares like the Congo, or once wealthy Western European countries that fell to communism,
[2:33:52.280 --> 2:34:00.000]  an Eastern European, but now we fall to Islam, allied with the globalist scourge.

[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:06.600]  media, funding itself with high quality products you sell, because they got rid of our Google
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:11.680]  advertising, $5 million a year, that it was set to be, it was 3.5 million last year, they
[2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:15.760]  had a bunch of our sponsors, they death threat people, they just do it all, and I saw this
[2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:19.600]  years ago, I said we're going to go to direct sales to folks, so now they try to hack attack
[2:36:19.600 --> 2:36:23.440]  the websites and shut us down, it's just we're never going to give up.
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:28.320]  Now, the news we're about to cover is some of the most powerful, important information
[2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:32.000]  I've ever covered.
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:40.840]  Elite publications like the Financial Times of London, The New Yorker Magazine, most importantly
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:44.560]  Atlantic Monthly, have all come out with articles that I'm going to be showing you
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:50.040]  on screen while our guest is on, saying we need to overthrow President Trump, we need
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:54.520]  to have new elections under Homeland Security, that's federalized things, and take all the
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:57.760]  Republicans that were elected in 2016 and remove them.
[2:36:57.760 --> 2:37:02.880]  Now remember, Obama's last action was to sign executive order, federalizing elections,
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:07.120]  all 50 Attorney Generals, including Democrats, wrote letters saying this violates the federal's
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:12.440]  clause, separation of the state's federal government, Trump is battling to try to remove
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:18.360]  all this bureaucracy, but it's still there, there's a mutiny going on, and the media has
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:22.280]  pointed out in the Washington Post that Colonel Schaeffer says the same things, I say the
[2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:26.720]  same things, Sean Hannity says the same things, well I know nobody talks to the president
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:31.000]  outside the White House like Sean Hannity, they talk every day, I'm leaving it at that,
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:36.720]  but the president was already aware of this, he's shocked by how pliable the media is,
[2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:41.640]  and the deep state to actually try to block a recovery and do this, but they intend it.
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:45.680]  So I wanted to play a clip briefly of Sean Hannity, Tuesday talking about this, and then
[2:37:45.680 --> 2:37:51.680]  a month ago on Ludobs business, Colonel Schaeffer breaking it down, but none of us are plagiarizing
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:56.720]  each other, we're all educated, we're all informed, we're reading what the Democrats
[2:37:56.720 --> 2:38:04.440]  are saying, and we're historically looking at it, they're calling for death, violence,
[2:38:04.440 --> 2:38:09.760]  this is insane, so I'm gonna ask Colonel Schaeffer, former head of the bin Laden unit, Patriot,
[2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:13.680]  with a lot of big connections, helped expose Benghazi, you name it, works with the London
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:18.800]  Center for Foreign Policy Research, Fox contributor, where we are currently and how serious the
[2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:23.200]  situation is, but first, here's a clip of Sean Hannity Tuesday, they're calling for
[2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:26.640]  him to be fired right now at the Washington Post.
[2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:31.920]  Also tonight, a soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an
[2:38:31.920 --> 2:38:38.280]  attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:44.400]  from office, sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear
[2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:45.400]  and present danger.
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:48.400]  That is tonight's very important opening monologue.
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:49.400]  All right, boom.
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:55.600]  Then a 15 minute breakdown of them saying kill the president, the deep state, Schumer bragging,
[2:38:55.600 --> 2:38:59.360]  the intelligence community has seven ways to Sunday to take you down, then they come
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:03.920]  out and watch some post article and say Fox News, Sean Hannity is encroaching on Alekshown's
[2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:09.960]  territory because he quotes the same statements they've made about the plan to overthrow him.
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:13.840]  So they want to get this plan going, but then they want to deny it, even though it's in
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:16.280]  the news when we oppose it.
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:18.600]  That is what they call black propaganda.
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:23.760]  They are using serious, unprecedented disinfo, Colonel Schaeffer, you're more of an expert
[2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:25.360]  on this than even I am.
[2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:28.800]  I know that you've worked in some of the most classified areas there are and really had
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:32.800]  up a lot of things that I'll never see a lot of day for this country.
[2:39:32.800 --> 2:39:35.040]  Am I overestimating how serious this is?
[2:39:35.040 --> 2:39:39.440]  No, Alex, thank you for having me on and know you're laying back completely correctly.
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:44.240]  You're essentially outlining the situation based on their own verbiage.
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:50.360]  And of course, then when you, they get caught in the open daylight, they then try to say,
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:52.840]  no, no, no, no, we never said that it's all about you.
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:56.680]  The same way the deep state goes about saying the deep state doesn't exist.
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:40:00.920]  And as you pointed out, and this is the first time you and I have spoken since a while,
[2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:06.040]  I don't know how many months ago, Sean Hannity and I haven't spoken, this is all original
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:12.640]  work by all of us simply observing what we see and factually analyzing and putting it
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:13.640]  back out.
[2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:17.320]  And my analysis is just a bit different than yours and Sean's.
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:23.120]  Mine is coming from the perspective of how I've looked at and studied terror organizations
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:26.000]  and how they go about radicalizing individuals.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:30.440]  My positon is, Alex, I've gotten some pushback and people don't like what I say, but the
[2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:38.600]  fact is this, the way that the left is going about trying to demonize the president, essentially
[2:40:38.600 --> 2:40:47.480]  justify and ignore the violence on their side and then reinforce that with a complete
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:53.720]  the imagery of death being acceptable, cacti-grip is using the beheaded image of the president.
[2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:59.160]  All these things are the same way ISIS goes about radicalizing and recruiting people and
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:00.720]  become terrorists.
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:02.200]  And that is what I'm seeing.
[2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:08.000]  I'm seeing a direct correlation, a direct pathology that is the same between ISIS going
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:16.440]  about isolating individuals, pushing them forward in their cause, reinforcing bad judgment,
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:20.840]  getting them to accept violence, becoming numb to anything else, except their way of
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:21.840]  thinking.
[2:41:21.840 --> 2:41:25.440]  And that's what I'm seeing here, and that's what I'm most frightened about, is that you
[2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:30.720]  have at least some percentage, Alex, who are going to be willing to go out and do and carry
[2:41:30.720 --> 2:41:37.000]  through what the left is pushing for here is a use of violence as a political extension
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:42.400]  of their methodology, of their ideology, and that's what we all have to be very concerned
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:43.400]  about.
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:48.320]  And yes, the republic is in danger by the fact that you have a group of individuals who
[2:41:48.320 --> 2:41:52.680]  are willing to subsume and overwhelm any legitimate element of government trying to protect the
[2:41:52.680 --> 2:41:57.320]  American people for purposes of trying to allow for this chaos to happen.
[2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:01.040]  Well, when you say you're getting pushed back, it's because you're over the target.
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:06.720]  The democrats are saying kill the president in every major newspaper I've seen has written
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:07.720]  op-eds.
[2:42:07.720 --> 2:42:10.440]  I see it in movies, I see it in plays, I see it in dramas.
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:16.800]  Kathy Griffin you mentioned, Snoop Dogg, Bowell says kidnap his wife, sex rape her, sex slave
[2:42:16.800 --> 2:42:24.440]  her, the Islamist capitulation by the feminist, putting on her jibs, I mean it is like mass
[2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:28.760]  Stockholm syndrome, and then they're everywhere saying we're going to get violent.
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:33.000]  Just on infowars.com, the commenters coming after us on the streets, it's just as you
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:38.840]  said, as ISIS or al-Qaeda puts out this message, kind of like fire ants put out pheromones
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:43.720]  and all stingy at once, they say go kill, it's acceptable, do it, the guy that tried
[2:42:43.720 --> 2:42:50.680]  to kill Trump in Nevada, grabbing the cop's gun, he's a hero, the BBC says that Wolf Blitzer
[2:42:50.680 --> 2:42:54.960]  has a guest on the day that Congressman Scalise and the cops, everybody gets shot a few weeks
[2:42:54.960 --> 2:42:59.960]  ago, and he says this man was not evil, he was tired of politics and Wolf Blitzer nods
[2:42:59.960 --> 2:43:00.960]  his head.
[2:43:00.960 --> 2:43:05.080]  I mean if somebody goes and shoots Blitzer, and then we say oh, it's just politics, I hope
[2:43:05.080 --> 2:43:09.840]  that doesn't happen, and the weirdest thing is it's not soldiers or tough guys who've
[2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:14.520]  had an experience doing this, who then are always wanting to be restrained, as conservatives
[2:43:14.520 --> 2:43:21.000]  are, they're taking you and others' kindness and restraint as weakness, and I see armies
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:25.840]  of beta males, communists with their fingers on their triggers, coming to Trump rallies
[2:43:25.840 --> 2:43:29.200]  and aiming guns at people, and the cops let them do it.
[2:43:29.200 --> 2:43:37.000]  I mean I'm seeing a death wish crazed suicide gene, just like we see in the Islamists, and
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:39.880]  you're absolutely right, in fact I hadn't really, I thought of it but never said it,
[2:43:39.880 --> 2:43:42.800]  they are literally becoming Islamified.
[2:43:42.800 --> 2:43:49.360]  Right, and that's the danger Alex, is that they have lost a connection with the democracy
[2:43:49.360 --> 2:43:55.000]  which we hold true, and you and I have spoken about this a dozen times, the fact is this,
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:44:00.800]  the government's job is to preserve and protect the American people and serve the common good.
[2:44:00.800 --> 2:44:06.360]  Alex, if the government doesn't get together, if Mr. Trump can't clear out the Obama folks,
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:12.080]  the pro-Trump, the pro-Clinton folks, you're going to see a complete breakdown in society,
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:18.920]  and inevitably, I think as you just stated, the left tends to take our kindness and consideration
[2:44:18.920 --> 2:44:23.000]  as weakness, and that is a dangerous mistake for them to make, because people are going
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  to get upset, and as you saw in England last week, you saw somewhat, I'm not saying we
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:33.400]  should go violent, I'm saying the inevitable result, if the government does not provide
[2:44:33.400 --> 2:44:38.360]  for the common defense, common welfare, you're going to see individuals pick up and take
[2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:42.640]  justice into their own hands, and that's why you saw that British individual, that British
[2:44:42.640 --> 2:44:47.680]  citizen, would no attack the individuals from that mosque coming out, because he is fed
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:53.320]  up with the fact that his own government has allowed for large networks of terrorists
[2:44:53.320 --> 2:44:55.280]  to establish themselves in their own country.
[2:44:55.280 --> 2:44:59.720]  So, this is what we're saying here, we're seeing, and I'll be blunt, large networks
[2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:06.440]  of terrorists under the banner of Antifa, under the justification of this, I would say,
[2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:12.720]  sedition put forward by the Democrat Party, encouraging their side to rise up and be violent,
[2:45:12.720 --> 2:45:16.160]  and eventually, people are going to become very perturbed by it, there's going to be
[2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:20.160]  good members of law enforcement who say enough's enough, and there's going to have to be a
[2:45:20.160 --> 2:45:24.080]  large effort to go after them, and dare I say, you're going to have to start locking
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:33.440]  people up for the very act of sedition that I've seen come from the former, the department
[2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:39.280]  of the federal Lynch, I think has been involved in sedition by her comments, you've seen
[2:45:39.280 --> 2:45:45.120]  other members of the former president, Obama's staff, encouraging violence, and I'm sorry
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:49.680]  Alex, that's sedition, the moment you cross the line, you cannot accept legitimate outcomes
[2:45:49.680 --> 2:45:54.280]  of a political election, and then start fighting the government and the governance, then you
[2:45:54.280 --> 2:45:58.600]  become essentially an enemy of the state, and in this case, they're actually encouraging
[2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:04.800]  acts of terror, and as you point out, the mainstream media was very accepting of a congressman,
[2:46:04.800 --> 2:46:10.680]  a police, a Scalicia being attacked, and instead of actually trying to say enough's enough,
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:14.160]  we've gone too far, they've continued to push forward with the idea that violence is
[2:46:14.160 --> 2:46:15.160]  okay.
[2:46:15.160 --> 2:46:19.720]  If you see the video of President Trump speaking to a crowd, and as soon as he says we have
[2:46:19.720 --> 2:46:24.560]  a moment of silence for Scalicia and the cops that got shot and others, they start booing
[2:46:24.560 --> 2:46:30.120]  and hissing and screaming, and I saw top democratic strategist on Fox News defending
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:35.880]  hashtag Trump, Hunt Republicans, I mean, I don't want to have this be violent, we just
[2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:43.280]  won election wise, we just saw Karen Handle win, we've just won four upset special elections
[2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:47.280]  despite the biggest democratic spending ever, we're winning the old fashioned American way
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:52.120]  with ideas, I don't want a war, I don't need some, you know, coming of age deal to kill
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:57.960]  a bunch of liberals, but I also feel like I'm in dereliction as a citizen of my duty
[2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:02.720]  not saying we have to start getting ready for insurrection and civil war because they're
[2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:03.720]  really pushing it.
[2:47:03.720 --> 2:47:09.480]  Literally that's what they're pushing, I mean exactly, and again, Alex, we cannot be dissuaded
[2:47:09.480 --> 2:47:13.520]  by them saying, oh, you're misinterpreting things, no, there's no need to misinterpret
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:19.120]  the idea that beheading a president and slaving his family is somehow okay, somehow that's
[2:47:19.120 --> 2:47:24.080]  just rhetoric, because a certain percentage, Alex, as you know, of individual on their
[2:47:24.080 --> 2:47:28.280]  side will take it seriously, they will begin to plan actions and he will.
[2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:32.320]  It's just like what you said earlier, they put out the message to billions of people,
[2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:35.960]  they know people are going to act, it's like advertising, if you put advertising out to
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:39.200]  billions of people saying come eat our hamburgers, they're going to come, well if you put out
[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:45.000]  advertising to billions saying kill, kill Republicans, kill Trump, kill Alex Jones, kill, kill, kill,
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  it's going to happen.
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:50.920]  Right, and that's exactly what I'm saying, what I'm saying, and even some on the left
[2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:55.040]  have admitted that there's issues, I've met with members of Congress on the Democrat side
[2:47:55.040 --> 2:47:59.480]  to recognize how dangerous this is, and look, I don't think Dennis Costino should be minding
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:04.320]  me talking about a conversation he and I had recently, Dennis is a concerted liberal, not
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:09.080]  a progressive liberal, has recognized Alex, there's a difference, the liberals, the traditional
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:14.880]  liberals recognize that the idea of free speech, of free dialogue is important to the sustainment
[2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:19.040]  of any democracy, however, when you cross the line, when you start calling for violence
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:23.320]  and killing the other side, you're then going to destroy the very fabric of the ability
[2:48:23.320 --> 2:48:27.680]  to have those discussions, and that's where, that's where now we are literally in a danger
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:33.040]  zone, and something has to be done, and Vice News, believe it or not, was one of the first
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:38.360]  liberal side elements to say, the liberal side is, yeah, the liberal side is actually
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:43.480]  going too far, and this is where we've got to look for those on the liberal side, not
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:47.760]  progressive side, liberal side, who recognize the damage being done to the very fabric of
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:48.760]  the law.
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:51.800]  Well, here's an example, I was in a restaurant about a month and a half ago, we were going
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:54.880]  to the shooting range, I was sitting there with former military guys, you name it, and
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:48:59.160]  we were all going to still carry, and this guy follows us out, he shows us his gun, and
[2:48:59.160 --> 2:49:02.360]  he says, you know, I ought to get you, and I didn't even know what to say to the guy,
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:05.920]  except I started getting ready, it was like an old Western, I started getting ready, and
[2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:08.720]  all of a sudden he figured it out and went back in the restaurant, but I just don't
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:12.800]  know what their problem, I mean, I've not done anything to these people, all I want
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:17.080]  is a secure, prosperous nation with tax cuts, and take care of our veterans, and secure
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:22.920]  our borders, I mean, I don't get why they hate America so much that they are willing
[2:49:22.920 --> 2:49:27.240]  to like literally attack President Trump's daughter on airplanes, you name it.
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:31.080]  Yeah, Alex, because of the culture, I mean, this is something I actually said on Lou
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:36.280]  Dobbs a few nights ago, and I got some pushback, look, the millennial generation, with a few
[2:49:36.280 --> 2:49:41.120]  exceptions, has been completely brainwashed into believing that somehow America is the
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:45.960]  front of all evil, that everything we've done has resulted in bad things happening,
[2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:52.880]  and they have become the believers in this very, very incorrect, but very corrosive idea.
[2:49:52.880 --> 2:49:53.880]  Cancerous.
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:49:59.960]  Somehow, yeah, it's a cancer, and they are infected, many are not willing to do it.
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:06.280]  My son is a conservative, he's a millennial, and he's constantly debating with his peers
[2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:13.040]  over what is factual, and they always answer his factual debate with a motion, so he will
[2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:14.040]  have to elaborate.
[2:50:14.040 --> 2:50:18.360]  Well, take Evergreen, you have a liberal professor, Bert Weinstein, who says you can't
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:22.280]  have a weekend where whites are banned, then they file a complaint on him, and the school
[2:50:22.280 --> 2:50:27.440]  tells him 50 plus faculty, 50 filed it, they said, you're not allowed to face your accuser,
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:33.960]  and challenging allegations of racism is racism, it is Kosska-esque 1984.
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:34.960]  Right.
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:40.720]  And this is where we have to again, clarify our message, clarify what you just said, Alex,
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:46.240]  we want prosperity for all, all Americans, not just American conservatives, not just
[2:50:46.240 --> 2:50:52.040]  our side, everyone, and the idea here is to live by the rule of law and support the Constitution,
[2:50:52.040 --> 2:50:56.160]  and somehow that has all become a radical idea to those on the left.
[2:50:56.160 --> 2:51:00.960]  And again, the progressives on the left, primarily, I think the liberals on the left, the traditional
[2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:05.440]  liberals understand what's going on, but they're very few, they're outnumbered, the
[2:51:05.440 --> 2:51:11.200]  old scoop-jaxon Democrats, Ludoz Democrats, they're being, essentially-
[2:51:11.200 --> 2:51:13.600]  Steve Bannon is an old-fashioned Democrat.
[2:51:13.600 --> 2:51:14.600]  Right.
[2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:19.640]  And so what we see here is this complete, I would say, like you said, this is the move
[2:51:19.640 --> 2:51:24.200]  to make the United States, this is good to make us a Soviet Union, that's what's going
[2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:25.200]  on.
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:29.280]  Let me ask you this question, again, a former Intel guy running Black Ops against Al-Qaeda,
[2:51:29.280 --> 2:51:35.600]  you name it, Abel Danger, the whole nine yards, Colonel Shaffer, Tony-Shaffer.com, LondonCenter.org,
[2:51:35.600 --> 2:51:39.600]  read his books, amazing guy, it's so hard to get him on.
[2:51:39.600 --> 2:51:43.960]  Looking at this, they were doing their incremental socialist takeover, and we're always left
[2:51:43.960 --> 2:51:46.920]  to select their part of the power structure, even though they're useful idiots and aren't.
[2:51:46.920 --> 2:51:51.800]  They see conservatism, libertarianism, free market renaissance, awakening globally, they
[2:51:51.800 --> 2:51:52.800]  get scared.
[2:51:52.800 --> 2:51:54.720]  They're big billionaire, farmers like Soros realize it.
[2:51:54.720 --> 2:51:56.200]  He triples the funding.
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:52:01.560]  They come out of their beehives, like it's the end of the world for them.
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:06.640]  And that's why they're launching their next 10-year operation in just a year, not out
[2:52:06.640 --> 2:52:08.800]  of strength, but out of desperation.
[2:52:08.800 --> 2:52:09.800]  Right.
[2:52:09.800 --> 2:52:13.640]  And to your point, this is where Antifa is getting its money.
[2:52:13.640 --> 2:52:18.280]  These kids who are Antifa, think about this, Alex, they are all baristas in Starbucks for
[2:52:18.280 --> 2:52:19.280]  the most part.
[2:52:19.280 --> 2:52:24.040]  They don't have the money to take off and go away from work and go protest.
[2:52:24.040 --> 2:52:28.520]  You now have a professional protest class that's been created by Soros funding.
[2:52:28.520 --> 2:52:30.480]  And again, this is sedition.
[2:52:30.480 --> 2:52:31.480]  This is sedition.
[2:52:31.480 --> 2:52:35.280]  This is pushing us towards a communist society.
[2:52:35.280 --> 2:52:37.440]  So why is Soros still walking around?
[2:52:37.440 --> 2:52:39.480]  Why is he still, why is he not arrested?
[2:52:39.480 --> 2:52:44.160]  Well, there's a number of people I think need to be in front of grand juries, Hillary Clinton,
[2:52:44.160 --> 2:52:46.240]  James Comey, and Soros.
[2:52:46.240 --> 2:52:52.160]  I think we've got to figure out how to push legitimate elements of our government to become
[2:52:52.160 --> 2:52:56.240]  constitutionally appropriate and focus again.
[2:52:56.240 --> 2:53:00.240]  And I think that requires Mr. Trump to fire more people at the Justice Department to get
[2:53:00.240 --> 2:53:04.680]  rid of those who don't understand that the need is for to bring back real freedom.
[2:53:04.680 --> 2:53:05.680]  I agree.
[2:53:05.680 --> 2:53:09.040]  And I think Trump should bring people in like you that are bulldogs.
[2:53:09.040 --> 2:53:10.920]  And I mean, this is war.
[2:53:10.920 --> 2:53:11.920]  Here's the deal.
[2:53:11.920 --> 2:53:13.520]  I don't need to feel big going after them.
[2:53:13.520 --> 2:53:15.560]  I don't want to have some big roundup of liberals.
[2:53:15.560 --> 2:53:16.560]  I don't want to do that.
[2:53:16.560 --> 2:53:22.120]  They're the ones trying to push us into a communist, fascist, crazy, kill everybody, amalgamation.
[2:53:22.120 --> 2:53:26.560]  I'm being forced to really think about how we respond to them, because clearly they're
[2:53:26.560 --> 2:53:28.000]  getting ready to launch their attacks.
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:33.960]  Soros has spent a billion dollars just on the stuff coming up in July, and they literally
[2:53:33.960 --> 2:53:35.480]  are saying kill cops.
[2:53:35.480 --> 2:53:38.920]  I mean, I can't believe that law enforcement even puts up with this.
[2:53:38.920 --> 2:53:40.640]  No, I've talked to law enforcement.
[2:53:40.640 --> 2:53:45.840]  As a matter of fact, I work with several folks in law enforcement here in Virginia.
[2:53:45.840 --> 2:53:51.040]  And the answer is this, law enforcement does kill very much targeted all members, black
[2:53:51.040 --> 2:53:52.040]  and white.
[2:53:52.040 --> 2:53:53.440]  But this is not a racial thing.
[2:53:53.440 --> 2:53:57.840]  I've talked to black members of the Philadelphia police force and recovery units and told me
[2:53:57.840 --> 2:53:58.840]  it's not out.
[2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:03.880]  Black Lives Matter is a fascist organization designed to undermine all law and order, no
[2:54:03.880 --> 2:54:05.080]  matter if it's black or white.
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:06.240]  So I think this is the thing.
[2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:08.880]  We have to continue to paint them, Alex, for what they are.
[2:54:08.880 --> 2:54:09.880]  They are fascists.
[2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:13.400]  They're seeking some level of control of our government.
[2:54:13.400 --> 2:54:16.120]  And if they can't control it, they want it disrupted or destroyed.
[2:54:16.120 --> 2:54:20.560]  And this is where we have to be very clear in trying to make it very clear to them.
[2:54:20.560 --> 2:54:22.280]  It's like, this is not acceptable.
[2:54:22.280 --> 2:54:26.920]  And then again, I hope Mr. Trump and the government can get its act together to go up to the leadership.
[2:54:26.920 --> 2:54:31.520]  Because again, like I said, and people cannot exist without a level of funding from an outside
[2:54:31.520 --> 2:54:32.840]  source set outside source.
[2:54:32.840 --> 2:54:34.040]  We know it's Soros.
[2:54:34.040 --> 2:54:35.760]  I've seen the intel on this.
[2:54:35.760 --> 2:54:39.560]  These groups are trying to organize all across the nation and they're going to leave with
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:40.560]  violence.
[2:54:40.560 --> 2:54:41.560]  And that is simply not acceptable.
[2:54:41.560 --> 2:54:45.680]  Bottom line, you saw a little net saying violence is necessary.
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:46.680]  You mentioned that.
[2:54:46.680 --> 2:54:47.680]  She said that a year ago.
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:48.680]  Right.
[2:54:48.680 --> 2:54:50.180]  She had a strong city that said the UN should run her police departments.
[2:54:50.180 --> 2:54:51.180]  That was mainstream news.
[2:54:51.180 --> 2:54:52.180]  You can't make this up.
[2:54:52.180 --> 2:54:53.180]  It's clear.
[2:54:53.180 --> 2:54:54.180]  Right.
[2:54:54.180 --> 2:54:57.000]  They think we're so dumb that if they kill a bunch of cops and kill conservatives, libertarians,
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:58.520]  we're going to roll over.
[2:54:58.520 --> 2:54:59.720]  They are so stupid.
[2:54:59.720 --> 2:55:00.720]  I don't know.
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:03.120]  They think bringing Islam is their muscle.
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:06.080]  I mean, it's almost like someone's setting them up.
[2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:07.440]  I know they're not.
[2:55:07.440 --> 2:55:12.240]  But Soros needs to know this isn't the Middle East or some places historically divided like
[2:55:12.240 --> 2:55:13.240]  Ukraine.
[2:55:13.240 --> 2:55:16.760]  I'm not trying to be overconfident here because I'm worried about the aftermath here.
[2:55:16.760 --> 2:55:18.720]  But I don't see this going well for them.
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:22.560]  Let me say this is going to upset some folks in your audience.
[2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:26.080]  Alex, why do you think they are so open to radical Islam?
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:29.240]  The reason is because they like that system.
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:32.400]  They like the system of control radical Islam brings.
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:38.400]  So when you see those on the left, apparently by all, you know, acting irrationally, ignoring
[2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:42.080]  the threat, the reason they're ignoring it out is because they like the model.
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:47.680]  They like the way radical Islam goes about subjugating individuals and putting power
[2:55:47.680 --> 2:55:48.680]  in hand.
[2:55:48.680 --> 2:55:50.160]  That's why they like Sharia.
[2:55:50.160 --> 2:55:51.320]  That's what they're aimed for.
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:53.880]  And that's why you see them allowing it to happen.
[2:55:53.880 --> 2:55:55.320]  Bars of a feather fly together.
[2:55:55.320 --> 2:55:56.320]  They're bullies.
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:56:00.000]  So President Trump listens to you obviously on Fox.
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:01.400]  He listens to us some.
[2:56:01.400 --> 2:56:03.040]  What is your message to President Trump?
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:06.560]  What other key points should we relate to folks because I'm with losers to know this
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:07.560]  isn't hype.
[2:56:07.560 --> 2:56:09.920]  I mean, this country is in a major crisis.
[2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:13.160]  They know the American system will outperform collectivism.
[2:56:13.160 --> 2:56:15.000]  That's why they want to kill the American system.
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.560]  We were inches away from societal collapse.
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:20.920]  Trump and the American people came in during the breach, but we've only got a beachhead
[2:56:20.920 --> 2:56:21.920]  right now.
[2:56:21.920 --> 2:56:22.920]  I like it.
[2:56:22.920 --> 2:56:23.920]  It's a D day.
[2:56:23.920 --> 2:56:24.920]  We're only on the beach.
[2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:25.920]  Well, that's it.
[2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:27.880]  You need to get off the shore, get off the shore.
[2:56:27.880 --> 2:56:28.880]  We died in shore.
[2:56:28.880 --> 2:56:32.440]  It's like they said during D day, you got to get, you know, back into the hedge roads,
[2:56:32.440 --> 2:56:37.240]  you got to carry on the fight to those who are attempting to undermine the successful
[2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:38.240]  effort.
[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:40.240]  And then the two things your audience needs to take away.
[2:56:40.240 --> 2:56:43.000]  First off, look, I think Mr. Trump is on the right track.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:45.120]  I think he's made a lot of good progress.
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:46.400]  He will continue to make progress.
[2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:51.240]  And secondly, I would encourage him to be bolder than he is.
[2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:54.240]  You're not going to solve the problem by being nice, Alex.
[2:56:54.240 --> 2:56:58.920]  You know, as much as I think President Trump tried to be somewhat hand across the water
[2:56:58.920 --> 2:57:02.280]  by not prosecuting Ms. Clinton, I think he needs to rethink that.
[2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:06.560]  I think he needs to go after them and to quote a good friend of mine, if you've got
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:09.240]  your boot on their throat, you don't stop them.
[2:57:09.240 --> 2:57:11.680]  They're going to come back and they're going to burn your house down.
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:20.200]  And frankly, as we've seen, blood has been flowing, a congressman was nearly assassinated.
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:22.440]  Left continues to push for violence.
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:26.920]  That Alex is not acceptable in anybody's book that I know is a rascal human being who
[2:57:26.920 --> 2:57:31.720]  loves this country and therefore anybody to include liberals who recognize the danger
[2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:32.840]  of the progressives.
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:36.400]  We all need to come together behind the scenes and maybe strangle better fellows, but do
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:40.800]  everything we can to support the president from clearing out this very clear and present
[2:57:40.800 --> 2:57:46.240]  danger to the sustainment and enhancement of our republic as we know it.
[2:57:46.240 --> 2:57:50.920]  It's a total clear and present danger and the intimidation, the insanity, it's a Pandora's
[2:57:50.920 --> 2:57:51.920]  box.
[2:57:51.920 --> 2:57:57.560]  Everybody's got to come together for prosperity, stability, and it's total insane to go down
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:57:59.160]  this road any further.
[2:57:59.160 --> 2:58:02.840]  Tony, I really appreciate you coming on LondonCenter.org.
[2:58:02.840 --> 2:58:03.840]  Thank you.
[2:58:03.840 --> 2:58:04.840]  Thank for all the work you're doing.
[2:58:04.840 --> 2:58:06.240]  I appreciate being on and I hope to come back soon.
[2:58:06.240 --> 2:58:07.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:58:07.240 --> 2:58:08.640]  Well, please come back any time you want.
[2:58:08.640 --> 2:58:09.640]  You're a busy guy.
[2:58:09.640 --> 2:58:13.160]  You know, you're working all the time, briefing Congress and other folks behind the scenes.
[2:58:13.160 --> 2:58:14.160]  You're really a superhero for America.
[2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:17.360]  I know you don't want the credit, but you're one of the guys out there that so many times
[2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:20.600]  I connect the dots is one of the key people making sure this country gets to the next
[2:58:20.600 --> 2:58:21.600]  level.
[2:58:21.600 --> 2:58:24.480]  So I know that everybody wants to thank you and please come back on soon.
[2:58:24.480 --> 2:58:25.480]  Thank you, Colonel.
[2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:26.480]  Thank you.
[2:58:26.480 --> 2:58:27.480]  Just want to do my share.

[2:58:30.480 --> 2:58:32.560]  The country is on the edge of an explosive civil war.

[3:00:03.400 --> 3:00:06.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:06.400 --> 3:00:17.000]  Hey, I want to give all the little commies, I'm not a pull-it-trigger, right, I'm not
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  around with their guns.
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:23.360]  Let me tell you something, I got a decent life, I love my family, I love the country,
[3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:24.360]  I love the world.
[3:00:24.360 --> 3:00:28.560]  I'm not looking to get in some fight with you but you just heard Colonel Schaefer who
[3:00:28.560 --> 3:00:34.520]  was involved in a lot of black ops, all the Middle East, all over Asia, all over Africa
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:42.000]  and you heard him say clear and present danger, that's the term that Dr. Pachennick came up
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  with back in the 70s.
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:49.360]  And of course they made a movie about it, that's the term I started using about two
[3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:54.320]  months ago, now Hannity uses it, they all use it because that's what it is.
[3:00:54.320 --> 3:01:00.800]  And I think it's like these Antifa, you see video where they like punch some big guy in
[3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:05.240]  the face, he breaks their jaw and they call the police, the cops go, we saw the footage
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:06.240]  you hit him.
[3:01:06.240 --> 3:01:10.360]  And it's not some cop butt kissing exercise, it's not like we haven't been pulled over
[3:01:10.360 --> 3:01:16.160]  by a jerk cop or run into some person, shouldn't have a badge on a power trip but the cops
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:20.760]  are the lowest level of government just like we are, the people, they're on top, we're
[3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:21.760]  on top.
[3:01:21.760 --> 3:01:24.640]  The lowest level is the highest level in America.
[3:01:24.640 --> 3:01:30.120]  It's like TSA, I used to totally go after them until I realized Congress sets them up,
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:35.360]  Congress hires them, Congress then gives them these directives and won't let them profile.
[3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:42.960]  I thought I'm an idiot and you know, and as you live, you grow, you understand things.
[3:01:42.960 --> 3:01:50.000]  It's just, I know the patriots in this country are just completely involved in the information
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  war and they don't want a violent revolution, we already had one politically and kicked
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:02:04.440]  your ass and we just had four special elections where the Democrats spent in one case, what
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:08.960]  was it say, seven times the previous record for that state was like 10 times the other
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:09.960]  record notice day.
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:14.000]  I want to talk to Anthony Cummings who's a good American patriot, an entrepreneur with
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:18.680]  his own radio TV network, number one show on XM kicked off that number one show on trust
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:19.680]  radio kicked off that.
[3:02:19.680 --> 3:02:24.360]  He's a conservative libertarian that also has some fun, you know, it's an adult show sometimes
[3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:26.320]  funny stuff, good stuff.
[3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:27.320]  And he's here seeing all this.
[3:02:27.320 --> 3:02:29.520]  I love always listen to the show and he's good enough to be with us.
[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:31.440]  I'm about to go 18 hours a day live.
[3:02:31.440 --> 3:02:34.920]  So if he wants to somlcast his great compound media, he's, he's, he's welcome.
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:37.920]  I'm on competition with compound media or anybody.
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:38.920]  I want more.
[3:02:38.920 --> 3:02:40.760]  I love Sean Hannity getting hardcore.
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:43.360]  That means not going to sleep a little bit better at night, Gavin McGinnis, all of it
[3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:44.600]  over their compound media.
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:48.560]  He's kind enough to let us cause they weren't done editing until about 10 minutes ago.
[3:02:48.560 --> 3:02:50.680]  My plan was to air it earlier today.
[3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:52.440]  I play the part of Tuck Buckford.
[3:02:52.440 --> 3:02:56.720]  I mean, Colbert does it, but I did it without a writer, just kind of did it off the cuff
[3:02:56.720 --> 3:02:59.000]  few days ago, but they edited it together.
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  Some of it's train wreck.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  Some of it's good.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:03.520]  And I've lost air 12 minutes up at the bottom of the hour, but I'm going to get out of here
[3:03:03.520 --> 3:03:04.520]  right now.
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:08.840]  Anthony Cooney, what do you make of Karen Handel, the big win, uh, the Democrats, uh,
[3:03:08.840 --> 3:03:14.920]  you know, chairing Scalia being shot or scolese, I guess both big shot are killed.
[3:03:14.920 --> 3:03:19.520]  I mean, this is crazy how they boo when Trump says a moment of silence for those that were
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:20.520]  shot.
[3:03:20.520 --> 3:03:21.640]  These are true scum.
[3:03:21.640 --> 3:03:23.240]  What has happened to them?
[3:03:23.240 --> 3:03:29.640]  I, uh, I was tweeting, of course, uh, as I, I usually do about the, uh, the recent election,
[3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:37.520]  um, and, uh, having handle, uh, a win, uh, and, and they just still can't understand.
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:43.920]  They are handing, handing these elections over to Republicans and they don't seem to
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:49.160]  understand that a large portion of this country does not agree with them.
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:54.800]  They can't imagine there are so many people in the United States of America that don't
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:04:01.720]  completely agree with them and our horrible racist, sexist, uh, homophobic, misogynistic
[3:04:01.720 --> 3:04:03.680]  people just running around all over the place.
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:06.840]  They thought it was a few people, but everyone thought like them.
[3:04:06.840 --> 3:04:13.360]  And now they're realizing the more of these, uh, left wing shenanigans that they pull
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:22.800]  on a daily basis, an hourly basis, uh, just drives Americans to the other side, uh, and,
[3:04:22.800 --> 3:04:29.480]  and takes, uh, their platform and makes it look that much more irrelevant, out of touch,
[3:04:29.480 --> 3:04:31.680]  uh, elitist and ridiculous.
[3:04:31.680 --> 3:04:32.680]  It's true.
[3:04:32.680 --> 3:04:34.960]  The Democratic Party is committing suicide.
[3:04:34.960 --> 3:04:35.960]  Yeah.
[3:04:35.960 --> 3:04:36.960]  Thank God.
[3:04:36.960 --> 3:04:44.760]  I mean, after eight years of, uh, Obama, uh, we're starting to emerge from this, uh, darkness
[3:04:44.760 --> 3:04:48.040]  that we've been in for, uh, for so long.
[3:04:48.040 --> 3:04:50.680]  Anthony Comey, a compound media straight ahead.
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:51.680]  This is the revolution.
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:54.760]  That's why they're attacking and spread the links, spread the shows, spread the live
[3:04:54.760 --> 3:04:55.760]  feed.
[3:04:55.760 --> 3:04:59.760]  It's an act of resistance.
[3:04:59.760 --> 3:05:03.920]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa and one of the people in attendance, our anonymous
[3:05:03.920 --> 3:05:05.440]  sources say was Bill Clinton.
[3:05:05.440 --> 3:05:07.040]  Well, how do we know it was Bill Clinton?
[3:05:07.040 --> 3:05:10.120]  Because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise
[3:05:10.120 --> 3:05:13.960]  and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field by a deranged Bernie supporter,
[3:05:13.960 --> 3:05:16.920]  Democratic operatives began blowing their Bill Clinton rape whistles.
[3:05:16.920 --> 3:05:21.760]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous
[3:05:21.760 --> 3:05:27.320]  friend, somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise.
[3:05:27.320 --> 3:05:28.320]  Right?
[3:05:28.320 --> 3:05:31.040]  Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt a president as he was sending
[3:05:31.040 --> 3:05:33.680]  out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot.
[3:05:33.680 --> 3:05:34.680]  Right?
[3:05:34.680 --> 3:05:35.680]  Come on, work with me here.
[3:05:35.680 --> 3:05:37.280]  The Democrats can't even protest right.
[3:05:37.280 --> 3:05:38.440]  These people fail at everything.
[3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:42.560]  They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:44.160]  It's just as Trump said.
[3:05:44.160 --> 3:05:46.160]  Never fails.
[3:05:46.160 --> 3:05:50.200]  You can check out the video on Infowars.com.
[3:05:50.200 --> 3:05:53.760]  Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise.
[3:05:53.760 --> 3:05:55.640]  And that part about Bill Clinton being in the audience?
[3:05:55.640 --> 3:05:56.640]  That was fake news.
[3:05:56.640 --> 3:05:59.520]  Rob Dure reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[3:05:59.520 --> 3:06:03.920]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:06:03.920 --> 3:06:08.600]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:06:08.600 --> 3:06:10.120]  to detoxify the body.
[3:06:10.120 --> 3:06:15.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:16.560]  It's made in the USA.
[3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:21.480]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:06:21.480 --> 3:06:23.320]  the body and it supports the Info War.
[3:06:23.320 --> 3:06:25.560]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:06:25.560 --> 3:06:29.120]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:34.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  you can possibly get.
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:38.920]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[3:06:38.920 --> 3:06:43.960]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:06:43.960 --> 3:06:49.200]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:06:49.200 --> 3:06:51.920]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[3:06:51.920 --> 3:06:55.200]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[3:06:55.200 --> 3:06:59.680]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at InfowarsLive.com.
[3:06:59.680 --> 3:07:03.520]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is at InfowarsLive.com to secure your chemist.
[3:07:03.520 --> 3:07:07.520]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[3:07:07.520 --> 3:07:11.320]  and affordable, great tasting multivitamin formula available.

[3:07:40.920 --> 3:07:41.920]  important.

[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:28.000]  Thank you, thank you, Anthony Kumiya and for Infowars.com.
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:32.840]  Man, a lot has transpired since I was last on.
[3:08:32.840 --> 3:08:43.880]  Once again, the violence and the violent tone of the left has an effect, has an effect.
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:51.160]  I don't understand how they get away from what they did early on in the Trump campaign
[3:08:51.160 --> 3:09:00.280]  and the elections, saying that this right-wing, alt-right movement that was spreading such
[3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:10.560]  violence amongst this country, their words, oh, they're inciting people to violence.
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:16.280]  Everybody, Trump supporters and the right, oh my goodness.
[3:09:16.280 --> 3:09:22.560]  If Trump doesn't win, my God, we're gonna see riots in the streets from these horrible
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:28.080]  right-wing, violent supporters of Donald Trump.
[3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:36.560]  So many magazine covers and mainstream media news coverage of them just predicting the
[3:09:36.560 --> 3:09:43.480]  future, that if Trump lost the election, we were gonna see violence that we've never
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:45.800]  seen before.
[3:09:45.800 --> 3:09:55.840]  Well, when Obama was elected twice, believe me, the right, the conservatives, Republicans,
[3:09:55.840 --> 3:10:03.160]  whatever you wanna call everybody on that side, none too happy, none too happy.
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:08.400]  And they'd like you to think it was a racial thing, but it was his policies.
[3:10:08.400 --> 3:10:18.080]  No one in their right mind that is pro-American, pro-American worker was in support of President
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:19.760]  Obama.
[3:10:19.760 --> 3:10:24.080]  Were there riots in the streets?
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:26.200]  Was there violence?
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:33.040]  Truth of the matter is, in eight years of a African-American president in what is supposed
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:38.760]  to be one of the most racist nations in the world, the United States of America, I know,
[3:10:38.760 --> 3:10:42.280]  it's hard to even fathom.
[3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:45.600]  No one ever took a pot shot at him.
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:51.240]  No one ever, there was a nut that ran into the White House, but I don't think his goal
[3:10:51.240 --> 3:10:55.000]  was to do the president any harm.
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:11:04.040]  Truth of the matter is, no one perpetrated any violence or even attempted violence on
[3:11:04.040 --> 3:11:08.600]  the first African-American president of the United States.
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:19.560]  That's that violent right-wing maniacal group of people, NRA, they have guns, look out,
[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:22.560]  it's crazy.
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:32.520]  Not one person attempted to assassinate President Obama.
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:36.040]  Now we see what happens after Donald Trump wins.
[3:11:36.040 --> 3:11:44.720]  Boy, we certainly did see an increase in violence, violent rhetoric, rioting, destruction of
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:52.120]  property, assaults, lawlessness, arson.
[3:11:52.120 --> 3:11:58.520]  This came from the tolerant, progressive left.
[3:11:58.520 --> 3:12:07.000]  The ones that were so worried that the right was going to lose their minds and burn the
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:18.160]  country down, the tolerant left have taken to assassination, assassinations.
[3:12:18.160 --> 3:12:27.480]  As we saw a couple of weeks ago in the ballpark over there in Alexandria, trying to kill
[3:12:27.480 --> 3:12:36.600]  as many Republican congressmen as possible, that's the tolerant left.
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:41.960]  But they continue, you watch that lying mainstream media.
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:50.280]  They will continue to tell you that this is Trump's fault, this is the alt-right getting
[3:12:50.280 --> 3:13:01.480]  people so riled up that they feel compelled now to take up arms and commit violence.
[3:13:01.480 --> 3:13:10.000]  And if you do not believe that the completely left-wing mainstream media is culpable in
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:12.840]  this, you're out of your mind.
[3:13:12.840 --> 3:13:16.160]  This is one of the most obvious things we've seen.
[3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:23.040]  There have been calls to violence put out on mainstream media.
[3:13:23.040 --> 3:13:24.400]  This isn't hidden.
[3:13:24.400 --> 3:13:32.680]  This is some secret plan that we don't know about, that has to be investigated and looked
[3:13:32.680 --> 3:13:37.320]  into and the layers of the onion have to be peeled away to see what's happening.
[3:13:37.320 --> 3:13:41.960]  Where is this violent rhetoric coming from that is inciting people to commit violence
[3:13:41.960 --> 3:13:44.400]  and murder?
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:49.080]  Oh, it's the news.
[3:13:49.080 --> 3:13:53.120]  It's what people consider the news.
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:14:00.080]  This is insane to me that it's how blatantly obvious does it have to get?
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:11.360]  How right in your face does this have to get before even the most mentally incapable human
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:20.560]  beings in this country go, yeah, yes, I absolutely see that mainstream media is attempting to
[3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:24.320]  twist minds for their own agenda.
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:33.040]  And that does include calling for murder of people on the right.
[3:14:33.040 --> 3:14:42.800]  They also blatantly call for the elimination of people through slander, libel, smear campaigns.
[3:14:42.800 --> 3:14:50.480]  We've seen it, we've seen it, if you are a viewer or listener to Info Wars, you know
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:15:00.640]  that Megan Kelly and her hack job that she did on Alex Jones was exposed by Alex.
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:08.760]  I mean, thank God, Alex has been through enough to know not to trust these people, the sweet
[3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:10.200]  talk you get.
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:14.920]  And I've been through it over the years, I understand myself and Opie when I was with
[3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:16.440]  the Opie and Anthony show.
[3:15:16.440 --> 3:15:23.120]  We got called by Bill O'Reilly to do a piece on the American youth.
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:29.080]  We're like, all right, we could do a story on that and we get called in and again, we
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:31.120]  heard the same stuff Alex heard from Megan.
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:35.760]  It's not a hit piece, it's going to be great, it's going to be fun, they always say it's
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:37.480]  going to be fun.
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:45.800]  These are con artists, they have an agenda and they will always adhere to it, no matter
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:46.800]  what they tell you.
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:50.120]  Oh, it's not going to be a hit piece, it's going to be great, it's going to be so good
[3:15:50.120 --> 3:15:51.640]  for you.
[3:15:51.640 --> 3:15:56.960]  And then you get there, you sit in the seat, you're on their turf, you're on their home
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:16:06.200]  field as it is, they are completely in charge of what the people finally see through editing
[3:16:06.200 --> 3:16:14.960]  and they slam you, they slam you with questions that are a smear campaign.
[3:16:14.960 --> 3:16:20.600]  So we were able to see that, thank God, like I said, Alex is smart enough to know to record
[3:16:20.600 --> 3:16:27.760]  these things as they're happening and not be made to look like a fool once they get
[3:16:27.760 --> 3:16:31.800]  done with their edit hack job and put it up there.
[3:16:31.800 --> 3:16:37.160]  But that's the media, don't for a second believe this is news.
[3:16:37.160 --> 3:16:44.560]  You know what I found out very recently, I assumed CNN over the course of the years
[3:16:44.560 --> 3:16:53.680]  got more and more dishonest with the American people and began to just lie slowly over the
[3:16:53.680 --> 3:16:57.360]  course of the years to the point where it is now where they just don't care.
[3:16:57.360 --> 3:17:04.440]  But we were so naive back in the late 80s and early 90s when CNN really took off, it
[3:17:04.440 --> 3:17:07.320]  was during the first Gulf War.
[3:17:07.320 --> 3:17:10.120]  And I never knew this until very recently.
[3:17:10.120 --> 3:17:12.400]  That was all a sham.
[3:17:12.400 --> 3:17:15.080]  That was all dishonest reporting.
[3:17:15.080 --> 3:17:23.400]  When they had all those reporters over in Saudi Arabia, we saw them in Bahrain and Riyadh
[3:17:23.400 --> 3:17:30.720]  and Tel Aviv over in Israel and I just found out recently it was a set.
[3:17:30.720 --> 3:17:37.800]  They were on a set looking at the sky going, oh, I think there's some scud missiles coming
[3:17:37.800 --> 3:17:38.800]  in.
[3:17:38.800 --> 3:17:41.120]  Quick gas, put the gas mask on.
[3:17:41.120 --> 3:17:44.800]  And watching this in the early 90s was so compelling.
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:45.800]  It was addictive.
[3:17:45.800 --> 3:17:48.560]  Yeah, yeah, these are some of the clips.
[3:17:48.560 --> 3:17:49.680]  They're on a set.
[3:17:49.680 --> 3:17:54.520]  It's a fan blowing on that palm tree.
[3:17:54.520 --> 3:17:59.320]  They set up a fan to make it look like they were outside.
[3:17:59.320 --> 3:18:04.800]  And I was shocked at this because I didn't think this dishonesty by what we actually
[3:18:04.800 --> 3:18:09.000]  thought was the news was a scam.
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:17.040]  And that, look at this, a set, and that they were always dishonest and always agenda driven.
[3:18:17.040 --> 3:18:19.160]  They weren't where they said they were.
[3:18:19.160 --> 3:18:25.160]  They weren't in danger of a scud missile or a gas attack on a set.
[3:18:25.160 --> 3:18:26.280]  And we bought it up.
[3:18:26.280 --> 3:18:33.200]  And the second, the American people looked at that and trusted it as much as we trusted
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:41.240]  our nightly news with Walter Cronkite with a tech offensive.
[3:18:41.240 --> 3:18:47.800]  The second we believed it and the second they realized we were watching, they started just
[3:18:47.800 --> 3:18:51.420]  BSing us on a daily basis.
[3:18:51.420 --> 3:18:58.080]  And they've only stepped it up over the course of the years to the point they are at now
[3:18:58.080 --> 3:19:04.080]  where it's news attainment, it's entertainment programming based on the news.
[3:19:04.080 --> 3:19:09.520]  It's like a parody show that is making money hand over fist through sponsors.
[3:19:09.520 --> 3:19:14.520]  And as we all know, the only way to get sponsors on board is to approach them and say, look
[3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:17.760]  how many people watch our show.
[3:19:17.760 --> 3:19:22.440]  And if all the news stations are doing the same news, you have to step it up, don't you?
[3:19:22.440 --> 3:19:29.400]  By lying, by being blatantly dishonest, and by putting people on sets and telling the
[3:19:29.400 --> 3:19:36.240]  American people it's news when in fact it is 100% complete lies.
[3:19:36.240 --> 3:19:37.640]  Don't be fooled, people.
[3:19:37.640 --> 3:19:39.040]  You're not getting news there.
[3:19:39.040 --> 3:19:41.520]  You are not getting the news there.
[3:19:41.520 --> 3:19:44.200]  We'll be back in mere moments.
[3:19:44.200 --> 3:19:59.600]  Don't go anywhere, Anthony Kumiya from compoundmediainfortinfowars.com, be back in a second or two.
[3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:04.140]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[3:20:04.140 --> 3:20:05.720]  Those times may be near.
[3:20:05.720 --> 3:20:09.760]  Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia
[3:20:09.760 --> 3:20:11.400]  and North Korea.
[3:20:11.400 --> 3:20:16.160]  Civil unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[3:20:16.160 --> 3:20:19.960]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[3:20:19.960 --> 3:20:21.980]  from a single cyber attack.
[3:20:21.980 --> 3:20:26.160]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide
[3:20:26.160 --> 3:20:28.720]  during a widespread national emergency.
[3:20:28.720 --> 3:20:31.720]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.

[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:13.440]  Amdic's Essentials, that's my middle name, I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.

[3:25:12.600 --> 3:25:13.600]  Good stuff.
[3:25:13.600 --> 3:25:17.920]  Anthony Kumiya back on Infowars.com.
[3:25:17.920 --> 3:25:21.840]  Wanted to talk also about this story just kind of disappeared.
[3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:27.440]  Is this becoming such commonplace that it just doesn't make the news anymore?
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:28.760]  It's not exciting enough.
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:33.760]  There was an absolute terrorist attack at a Michigan airport.
[3:25:33.760 --> 3:25:44.240]  At Bishop Airport in Michigan, a gentleman, a Canadian of Tunisian descent, he came from
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:52.520]  Tunisia, decided to go up to a police officer at Bishop Airport in Flint, Michigan, the
[3:25:52.520 --> 3:26:03.480]  lovely Flint, Michigan, and yell, Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar, and stab an officer in the neck
[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:10.200]  Thank goodness he underwent surgery and is in a stable condition.
[3:26:10.200 --> 3:26:13.400]  But what happens?
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:19.520]  Now we don't even really talk about this in mainstream media.
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:24.960]  We used to at least force them to address that Islamic terrorism is happening in our
[3:26:24.960 --> 3:26:29.080]  country and at our airports.
[3:26:29.080 --> 3:26:30.080]  Now?
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:31.080]  Ah.
[3:26:31.080 --> 3:26:33.600]  We got this something, what's happening?
[3:26:33.600 --> 3:26:34.600]  Healthcare.
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:40.360]  Oh my God, we got to listen to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi bash anything Donald Trump
[3:26:40.360 --> 3:26:41.960]  wants to do.
[3:26:41.960 --> 3:26:43.200]  That'll make the news.
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:48.600]  You'll watch their incoherent babble on mainstream media.
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:59.800]  But there was a terrorist event at Flint, Michigan airport and it barely made any news.
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:02.200]  Is this what we have to look forward to?
[3:27:02.200 --> 3:27:07.720]  That it's just become so accepted that no one really wants to even address it.
[3:27:07.720 --> 3:27:12.000]  Except Michael Moore, of course, Flint, Michigan's own Michael Moore.
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:13.800]  Oh, that's right.
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:16.960]  He doesn't live near Flint at all.
[3:27:16.960 --> 3:27:22.560]  He lives in a wonderful mansion in a wonderful part of Michigan.
[3:27:22.560 --> 3:27:26.360]  But he has to comment on this.
[3:27:26.360 --> 3:27:34.760]  He actually said, if you're going to condemn this terrorism that took place at the Bishop
[3:27:34.760 --> 3:27:43.760]  airport, then you must also condemn the terrorism that was the governor poisoning the water
[3:27:43.760 --> 3:27:51.240]  of the fine folks of Flint, Michigan, assuming that it was done on purpose, assuming that
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:56.680]  whoever the powers that be there in Michigan decided to poison the water.
[3:27:56.680 --> 3:28:06.600]  Now, I will never deny that some horrid misappropriations of funds and negligence on the part of the
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:13.640]  government to save money or to line their own pockets were responsible for unhealthy
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:17.600]  water, poisoned water in Flint, Michigan.
[3:28:17.600 --> 3:28:23.040]  But as a terrorist event, the second we start using the word terrorism, like we use the
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:30.400]  word racist and sexist now, if you don't agree with somebody on the left, you're a racist.
[3:28:30.400 --> 3:28:35.480]  And it completely took the word out of circulation.
[3:28:35.480 --> 3:28:38.360]  You just made that word mean nothing.
[3:28:38.360 --> 3:28:42.200]  When everyone is a terrorist, no one's a terrorist.
[3:28:42.200 --> 3:28:44.360]  You see how that works?
[3:28:44.360 --> 3:28:54.280]  So when he's equating government incompetence, which is rampant in this country to terrorism,
[3:28:54.280 --> 3:29:02.400]  you're actually lowering the bar for what it takes to label something terrorist.
[3:29:02.400 --> 3:29:06.440]  Now, it might sound like I'm arguing semantics here, but no.
[3:29:06.440 --> 3:29:09.960]  Language and words are very important tools to the left.
[3:29:09.960 --> 3:29:16.200]  They love naming things to either give or eliminate their power.
[3:29:16.200 --> 3:29:18.400]  We're going to take a little time here.
[3:29:18.400 --> 3:29:20.240]  You got to see this.
[3:29:20.240 --> 3:29:28.960]  It's Stephen Colbert doing his, what is it, tuck what?
[3:29:28.960 --> 3:29:32.800]  And then Alex is going to come on and it's a parody.
[3:29:32.800 --> 3:29:33.960]  It's really hysterical.
[3:29:33.960 --> 3:29:37.800]  I implore you to watch this.
[3:29:37.800 --> 3:29:49.000]  Great spoof, and we'll be back on info wars.com.
[3:29:49.000 --> 3:29:56.760]  We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:29:56.760 --> 3:30:05.880]  Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU, Scott Keller, a German member of
[3:30:05.880 --> 3:30:10.680]  the European Parliament and of the Green Party, so we should transplant entire villages from
[3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:14.680]  Syria to Germany, and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany.
[3:30:14.680 --> 3:30:16.120]  Listen to these quotes.
[3:30:16.120 --> 3:30:21.560]  The idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example, if refugees don't
[3:30:21.560 --> 3:30:24.360]  want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees.
[3:30:24.360 --> 3:30:28.920]  People would rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance
[3:30:28.920 --> 3:30:29.920]  easier.
[3:30:29.920 --> 3:30:32.880]  Let's look at these three compatriots from Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:30:32.880 --> 3:30:36.440]  Sweden, migrants viciously beat disabled man while calling him racist.
[3:30:36.440 --> 3:30:40.640]  Three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station
[3:30:40.640 --> 3:30:42.520]  during an incident which took place last month.
[3:30:42.520 --> 3:30:45.960]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut, as one of
[3:30:45.960 --> 3:30:49.880]  the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[3:30:49.880 --> 3:30:51.800]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[3:30:51.800 --> 3:30:54.960]  You can read both articles now on infowars.com.
[3:30:54.960 --> 3:31:20.960]  Rob Dure reporting for infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[3:31:20.960 --> 3:31:41.040]  This is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to
[3:31:41.040 --> 3:31:42.840]  the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[3:32:46.400 --> 3:33:16.360]  Don't buy it, you will love it, I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[3:33:16.360 --> 3:33:21.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:33:21.360 --> 3:33:30.640]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:30.640 --> 3:33:36.640]  Brain Fight is brought to you by Brain Fart Plus with extra fluoride so that your days
[3:33:36.640 --> 3:33:38.760]  are happy and dim.
[3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:44.080]  And of course, the formula that I developed myself, that's the super cuck, beta male that
[3:33:44.080 --> 3:33:48.480]  everyone should be taking so we can get our orders from Hillary and know that she wears
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:51.160]  the pants around here.
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:56.120]  Now I understand what Alex Jones is going through personally, because for years, I'm
[3:33:56.120 --> 3:33:58.280]  not telling you guys don't know.
[3:33:58.280 --> 3:34:09.920]  I've also been playing a right wing radio host, my beloved character, Tuck Buckford.
[3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:14.680]  Thank you, yes, yes, welcome to Brain Fight, ladies and gentlemen, with the real Tuck
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:15.680]  Buckford.
[3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:21.760]  And I tell you, I want to thank tonight CBS News for allowing me to set the record straight
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:26.680]  about a public enemy number one and a scourge of America and the world.
[3:34:26.680 --> 3:34:31.920]  I'm not talking about Stephen Colbert, I'm talking about Alex Jones of Infowars.
[3:34:31.920 --> 3:34:38.280]  That enemy of America stole my identity back in high school and my manly power and my manly
[3:34:38.280 --> 3:34:39.280]  voice.
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:43.360]  And he took it from me and then spread his evil lies across the country and the world.
[3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:50.920]  And he stole not just my persona, he then projected his right wing evil, unalloyed racist
[3:34:50.920 --> 3:34:53.360]  views over me.
[3:34:53.360 --> 3:34:58.880]  And then that got picked up by Stephen Colbert, who unknowingly stole the identity of someone
[3:34:58.880 --> 3:35:00.840]  that had stolen my identity.
[3:35:00.840 --> 3:35:06.840]  So here tonight, thanks to CBS, here at Brain Fight with the real Tuck Buckford, I am going
[3:35:06.840 --> 3:35:11.360]  to set the record straight about the fact that Alex Jones is a damn liar.
[3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:19.080]  I'm a pioneer, I'm an explorer, I'm a human, let's get right down to facts here.
[3:35:19.080 --> 3:35:21.240]  Tuck Buckford is going to lay him out.
[3:35:21.240 --> 3:35:26.200]  Alex Jones would take a real piece of news like this out of Associated Press, but it
[3:35:26.200 --> 3:35:29.200]  sounds all crazy and he'd make a big deal out of it.
[3:35:29.200 --> 3:35:34.440]  But I actually think this is a great idea, in fact, it should be the new Chonani yogurt
[3:35:34.440 --> 3:35:35.440]  flavor.
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:41.560]  Look at this, dried lizard penises from India sold as good luck charms.
[3:35:41.560 --> 3:35:47.280]  Now, Alex Jones would sit there and say, there's a problem with that and try to scare people.
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:54.800]  Now let's look at another dried lizard penis, reanimated with all sorts of baby blood, they're
[3:35:54.800 --> 3:35:56.120]  pumping through his arteries.
[3:35:56.120 --> 3:35:58.160]  I'm totally for it, I think it's great.
[3:35:58.160 --> 3:36:04.200]  Well, that's Bill Clinton did Secret Service on multiple Olita Express flights, why it's
[3:36:04.200 --> 3:36:06.600]  mainstream news, hell yeah.
[3:36:06.600 --> 3:36:11.160]  Here's an article right here, latest Wiki leaks those traders, Cherry Blossom exposes
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:17.560]  CIR wireless hacking, where they load it on all your different wireless devices, CIA software
[3:36:17.560 --> 3:36:19.880]  to track and listen to everything you did.
[3:36:19.880 --> 3:36:25.240]  Another thing Alex Jones was right about, that trader piece of filth, out there him released,
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:29.960]  stick their kidnapping kids and spying on you illegal, that traitorous piece of crap.
[3:36:29.960 --> 3:36:35.240]  There's another big problem I've got right now on Brain Fight, remember that Congress
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:39.440]  with Steve Scalise, he's also been speaking out against child trafficking, among four
[3:36:39.440 --> 3:36:45.320]  shot at baseball field, well, Tuck Bucks relaxed it, I'm a Democrat, I'm like the guy that
[3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:46.320]  did it.
[3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:50.480]  Wolf Blitzer went on the news and interviewed his friend and they said, he's not evil,
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:57.000]  he's just political, that's right, it's political, if we kill you, let's play a clip.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:05.680]  We're just getting some tape in of an acquaintance of James Hodgkinson, the 66 year old shooter,
[3:37:05.680 --> 3:37:10.400]  describing some of his political, perhaps, motivations, listen to this.
[3:37:10.400 --> 3:37:16.800]  I just want to let people know that he wasn't evil, that he was, I guess, tired of some
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:18.800]  of the politics that's going on.
[3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:24.120]  And so we just heard that perhaps he wasn't evil, just tired of the politics that's going
[3:37:24.120 --> 3:37:31.960]  on, Tom Fuentes, the FBI, whoo, Tuck's just getting started, and wound up, I love another
[3:37:31.960 --> 3:37:38.640]  Democrat, I like, just like that, just like that sweetie pie, Stephen Colbert, that fancy
[3:37:38.640 --> 3:37:47.800]  sounding French name, whoo, Tuck takes, excuse me, Tuck, everybody's Tuck, takes on dim
[3:37:47.800 --> 3:37:51.880]  strategists who tweeted, hunt down Republicans and kill them.
[3:37:51.880 --> 3:37:56.600]  In the hours after five people were shot, including the House majority whip, you sent
[3:37:56.600 --> 3:38:02.680]  a tweet that said, hunt Republicans, I mean it was clearly a reference to the assassination
[3:38:02.680 --> 3:38:07.920]  attempt against Congressman Scalise, it's hard to imagine how you could justify writing
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:08.920]  something like that.
[3:38:08.920 --> 3:38:13.920]  For too long, Republicans in this country have failed to distinguish the differences
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:19.160]  between politics and war, and a lot of Democrats have failed to see the similarities, so you
[3:38:19.160 --> 3:38:22.440]  guys either have to tone down the rhetoric or we have to step up.
[3:38:22.440 --> 3:38:28.560]  Oh, I love it, boy, I tell you, I agree with the Democrats on that, I'm a registered Democrat,
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:33.320]  here's another one of fellow wearing a Trump hat, they said get ready to be shank-widey
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:39.640]  and stab him nine times, he's fighting for his life right now, whoo, that's liberal.
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:44.880]  And then we got old Bernie Sanders saying, unprecedented attacks, unprecedented anger,
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:49.720]  do any means necessary, and I tell you, just like his good buddy that shot Congressman and
[3:38:49.720 --> 3:38:56.600]  all those cops, I tell you, good old Bernie Sanders is right on target, that's who old
[3:38:56.600 --> 3:38:57.600]  Buck likes.
[3:38:57.600 --> 3:39:03.720]  But when I talk about a political revolution, this is what I'm talking about, is for people
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:09.680]  all over this country to put pressure on every level of government, but we got to stand
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:14.600]  up and fight back, we have got to be involved in the political process in a way that we
[3:39:14.600 --> 3:39:21.560]  have never been before, you have got to, Mary, act in an unprecedented way, think big, get
[3:39:21.560 --> 3:39:26.440]  involved in every way that you can, so Mary, stand up and fight back in every way that
[3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:27.440]  you can.
[3:39:27.440 --> 3:39:34.800]  Oh, wow, you know old Tuck, old Tuck sometimes, though, does take that super mill vitality
[3:39:34.800 --> 3:39:41.320]  that Alex Jones sells, and in Four Wars Live.com, and I need to settle down, there's only one
[3:39:41.320 --> 3:39:47.560]  way for me to settle down, I do what old Stephen Colbert says, and I take the super Cuck beta
[3:39:47.560 --> 3:39:51.640]  mill of vitality to try to counterbalance a little bit of the old manliness I'm about
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:39:54.920]  to get into with the gay frogs, let me just take a little bit of this, because it's so
[3:39:54.920 --> 3:39:55.920]  strong.
[3:39:55.920 --> 3:40:07.200]  Oh, that's good stuff right there, calm down, oh, Lordy, Lordy, oh, I'm feeling a little
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:08.200]  bit better now.
[3:40:08.200 --> 3:40:12.320]  Now, let me get to the real news, well, we were talking about this, the truth is Jones
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:16.640]  is telling you about gay frogs, and gay fish, and all the rest of this, because he doesn't
[3:40:16.640 --> 3:40:22.720]  want you to be liberated from your male vitality, and the truth is the good people at CBS and
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:27.360]  others have been running this good program for you and your family to drink Bisfinole
[3:40:27.360 --> 3:40:31.880]  and all the other estrogen members that are out there, so let me show you some of the
[3:40:31.880 --> 3:40:37.440]  mainstream news telling you about the animals, so you can understand just what a big liar
[3:40:37.440 --> 3:40:43.080]  Alex Jones is, misrepresenting the fact that I believe that we should take estrogen, and
[3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:46.840]  I believe we should get the increased cancers that come along with it, and that none of
[3:40:46.840 --> 3:40:50.440]  us should have a debate about this, so I'm going to show you this, but just like they
[3:40:50.440 --> 3:40:56.040]  said on CNN, only I can show you the WikiLeaks, nobody else can, only good old Tuck Buckford,
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:58.120]  this is not a too paid by the way.
[3:40:58.120 --> 3:41:03.440]  Also interesting is remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents, it's different
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:07.240]  for the media, so everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[3:41:07.240 --> 3:41:11.280]  And in full disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what it means.
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:16.000]  I'm not a too paid by the way, it's brought to you by Lizard Penis flavored yogurt.
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:22.520]  Here you go, animals, sexual changes linked to waste chemicals, and it reports that the
[3:41:22.520 --> 3:41:28.520]  majority in these studies of the frogs are now bisexual or gay or sterilized.
[3:41:28.520 --> 3:41:33.480]  But again, you need to look into that for yourself, male frogs may be turning female
[3:41:33.480 --> 3:41:37.400]  thanks to estrogen in suburban waste.
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:42.760]  Continuing here's a new one, 85% of the small mouth bass have signs of female reproductive
[3:41:42.760 --> 3:41:49.640]  parts, or the large mouth bass, 27% were intersex or bisexual, and again, I think we
[3:41:49.640 --> 3:41:54.040]  shouldn't have a debate about this, and I think Alex Jones ought to be arrested for
[3:41:54.040 --> 3:41:59.480]  talking about it, and I'm glad there's a big national joke about all that.
[3:41:59.480 --> 3:42:04.200]  And then finally, that leads me, ladies and gentlemen, to my final big point here that
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:09.120]  I hadn't gotten to yet, Lordy, Lordy, and that's North Korea.
[3:42:09.120 --> 3:42:15.560]  I saw the old network that I was on over there on Comedy Central, and they were making big
[3:42:15.560 --> 3:42:22.600]  jokes about what happened to Otto Warmbier who died in a coma after 16 months in North
[3:42:22.600 --> 3:42:26.040]  Korea, supposedly taking a poster off the wall.
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:32.360]  Well, turns out Larry Wilmore did a big roast and made fun of him because he was a white
[3:42:32.360 --> 3:42:35.200]  ass and basically deserved it.
[3:42:35.200 --> 3:42:38.200]  No, tonight's story is about the North Korean government which recently captured one of
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:40.400]  America's most annoying exports.
[3:42:40.400 --> 3:42:45.840]  A frat bro, Otto Frederick Warmbier is a University of Virginia student now being detained by
[3:42:45.840 --> 3:42:46.840]  North Korea.
[3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:47.840]  Okay, so what do you do wrong?
[3:42:47.840 --> 3:42:52.920]  He's accused of trying to steal a North Korean political banner from his hotel.
[3:42:52.920 --> 3:42:56.880]  Okay, listen up, frat boy.
[3:42:56.880 --> 3:42:59.920]  This isn't like the time you stole Sighap's goat.
[3:42:59.920 --> 3:43:05.920]  Okay, so maybe he is in some sophisticated undercover mastermind.
[3:43:05.920 --> 3:43:13.920]  I entirely faked the governance of the DPR Korea for their forgiveness.
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:14.920]  Please.
[3:43:14.920 --> 3:43:15.920]  Include my family.
[3:43:15.920 --> 3:43:16.920]  I'm sorry, guys.
[3:43:16.920 --> 3:43:23.600]  It's just tough for me to have much sympathy for this guy and his crocodile tears because
[3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:26.560]  he allegedly stole this North Korean hotel banner.
[3:43:26.560 --> 3:43:32.400]  And this is the kind of attitude we need from the left here is defending North Korea and
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:38.680]  then calling and celebrating for the imprisonment and enslavement of white people if they've
[3:43:38.680 --> 3:43:40.240]  gone to college.
[3:43:40.240 --> 3:43:43.920]  That is not racist, that is not sexist, that is not hateful.
[3:43:43.920 --> 3:43:49.280]  I want to bring up my next guest, Donald John Trump.
[3:43:49.280 --> 3:43:54.000]  He's been on the show before, but he's now joining us again and he better keep his mouth
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:57.040]  shut here for a minute because I'm not like Alex Jones.
[3:43:57.040 --> 3:43:58.440]  I don't believe in political violence.
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:44:00.360]  That's why I promote it continually.
[3:44:00.360 --> 3:44:04.680]  That's called the oxymoron leftist mind control system that I bought into because I want to
[3:44:04.680 --> 3:44:05.680]  be in charge.
[3:44:05.680 --> 3:44:11.080]  We have a record high stock market, $3 plus trillion and he took us out of these multinational
[3:44:11.080 --> 3:44:15.960]  secret deals that took over Congress like the TPP and the carbon tax.
[3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:20.080]  And now new big studies and mainstream news reported it wasn't 3.3 million illegals that
[3:44:20.080 --> 3:44:23.280]  may have voted, but 5.7 so he lied to us.
[3:44:23.280 --> 3:44:26.520]  He said it was only 3.2, 3.3.
[3:44:26.520 --> 3:44:32.880]  He lied to us when it was 2 million or more than that and he's the biggest liar keeping
[3:44:32.880 --> 3:44:35.600]  his promises I've ever seen.
[3:44:35.600 --> 3:44:41.120]  So when they have Shakespeare in the park saying kill Trump, no big deal, Madonna says
[3:44:41.120 --> 3:44:42.120]  kill him, blow him up.
[3:44:42.120 --> 3:44:45.480]  It's the coolest thing to do in the world, but the left then claims that the right wing
[3:44:45.480 --> 3:44:46.960]  is violent because they are.
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:50.440]  I just want to say, you know, this isn't violent at all, okay?
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:54.440]  This right here, this is not violent at all, but I do this to Trump.
[3:44:54.440 --> 3:44:55.440]  You understand?
[3:44:55.440 --> 3:44:57.440]  Let me just explain that to everybody.
[3:44:57.440 --> 3:45:02.440]  I mean, if I sit here and just start ripping his head off and doing this, this is liberal
[3:45:02.440 --> 3:45:07.240]  and this is open if we ban free speech on colleges and arrest everybody, it's a good
[3:45:07.240 --> 3:45:08.240]  day, okay?
[3:45:08.240 --> 3:45:14.440]  So let's get that straight right now that the real Tuck Buckford's here and Alex Jones
[3:45:14.440 --> 3:45:20.040]  and all the rest of them better understand that we run this country now, like North
[3:45:20.040 --> 3:45:26.240]  Korea, and I like Cobare, and I want the tens of millions he gets selling out of America.
[3:45:26.240 --> 3:45:29.720]  I love it, I absolutely love it.
[3:45:29.720 --> 3:45:38.320]  Tuck Buckford loves Cobare, but I hate Alex Jones, it's Brain Fight, yeah.
[3:45:38.320 --> 3:45:44.840]  Brain Fight is brought to you by Brain Fart Plus with Extra Flora, so your days are happy
[3:45:44.840 --> 3:45:45.840]  and dim.
[3:45:45.840 --> 3:45:52.240]  And of course, the formula that I developed myself, that's the Super Cuck Veta Male.
[3:45:52.240 --> 3:45:56.200]  Everyone should be taken so we can get our orders from Hillary and know that she wears
[3:45:56.200 --> 3:46:03.200]  the pants around here.
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:17.760]  Oh man, that was really funny, holy cheese.
[3:46:17.760 --> 3:46:23.560]  And I'm certain no one is going to out of context pull some of the clips, especially
[3:46:23.560 --> 3:46:28.520]  of him ripping Donald Trump's face off.
[3:46:28.520 --> 3:46:31.840]  Oh man, that was really good.
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:35.120]  You know what's great about that?
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:39.960]  Obviously shows, oh my goodness.
[3:46:39.960 --> 3:46:46.720]  Obviously it shows Alex has a sense of humor about himself, something that people really
[3:46:46.720 --> 3:46:53.480]  don't, I don't think they see a lot of times, especially people that don't appreciate Alex
[3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:59.320]  but also he's making a great point in that whole parody.
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:04.240]  Alex over the course of the years has always been looked at by mainstream media and the
[3:47:04.240 --> 3:47:11.440]  people that are so brainwashed by mainstream media as a nutty guy.
[3:47:11.440 --> 3:47:19.320]  They talk about the stories that he covers, like they're all some whacked out conspiratorial
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:24.440]  fantasy that he's coming up with on a daily basis.
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:32.160]  He just proved in an hysterical fashion that mainstream media are talking about the same
[3:47:32.160 --> 3:47:34.560]  stories he talks about.
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:39.240]  I mean, you could say something like, oh my God, gay frogs.
[3:47:39.240 --> 3:47:40.240]  Did you hear that?
[3:47:40.240 --> 3:47:43.040]  Alex Jones was talking about gay frogs, that's insane.
[3:47:43.040 --> 3:47:44.320]  He's a nut.
[3:47:44.320 --> 3:47:47.720]  And then National Geographic.
[3:47:47.720 --> 3:47:57.280]  That was a National Geographic Society story about frogs and toxins in the atmosphere and
[3:47:57.280 --> 3:48:03.320]  the water and their food that is changing their genetic makeup.
[3:48:03.320 --> 3:48:04.960]  So that's crazy.
[3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:08.760]  Bravo, that was really funny.
[3:48:08.760 --> 3:48:17.680]  He also brings up a great point on how the left looked at Otto Warmbier when he was arrested.
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:22.160]  In Korea, it was a big joke.
[3:48:22.160 --> 3:48:32.600]  It was a big joke that a white frat boy was arrested by a horrible, horrible regime for
[3:48:32.600 --> 3:48:36.120]  nothing, for nothing.
[3:48:36.120 --> 3:48:41.960]  And imprisoned over there and murdered, murdered.
[3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:42.960]  Let's be real here.
[3:48:42.960 --> 3:48:50.600]  I don't care that they sent him back to the US in what was far worse than a coma with
[3:48:50.600 --> 3:48:58.200]  a severe brain damage and physical damage, there was organs, and they sent him here to
[3:48:58.200 --> 3:48:59.200]  die.
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:03.160]  They sent him here to die, so he wouldn't die over there.
[3:49:03.160 --> 3:49:10.840]  And the left found that funny, found that he was imprisoned, enslaved over there, and
[3:49:10.840 --> 3:49:11.840]  murdered.
[3:49:11.840 --> 3:49:17.560]  An American citizen, a young American citizen, regardless of how you feel about what he supposedly
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:26.680]  did, which was nothing more than if he did do it, trying to take a banner off a wall.
[3:49:26.680 --> 3:49:32.960]  He's a young kid, does stupid stuff, and that's the big issue.
[3:49:32.960 --> 3:49:34.640]  That should cost him his life.
[3:49:34.640 --> 3:49:43.800]  This wasn't somebody grabbing for a police officer's gun or committing a violent crime.
[3:49:43.800 --> 3:49:49.600]  They thought it was hilarious, and they ship him over here dead.
[3:49:49.600 --> 3:49:55.520]  Hearing from his parents was heartbreaking how the Obama administration and Obama himself
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:49:59.520]  had told his parents not to do anything.
[3:49:59.520 --> 3:50:03.800]  Don't hang ribbons out for your boy.
[3:50:03.800 --> 3:50:13.440]  Don't go on the media and talk about his plight and try your best to get public opinion on
[3:50:13.440 --> 3:50:19.120]  your side so you can perhaps free your son from this horrid imprisonment over in North
[3:50:19.120 --> 3:50:20.120]  Korea.
[3:50:20.120 --> 3:50:26.040]  Obama, the Obama administration, the Secretary of State did nothing, did nothing to free
[3:50:26.040 --> 3:50:28.680]  this young man.
[3:50:28.680 --> 3:50:37.680]  They took Trump to actually get him back here right before he died of murder.
[3:50:37.680 --> 3:50:41.800]  This boy was murdered by the government of North Korea.
[3:50:41.800 --> 3:50:43.560]  Are we coming back?
[3:50:43.560 --> 3:50:44.560]  We're coming back, right?
[3:50:44.560 --> 3:50:45.760]  For a few more minutes.
[3:50:45.760 --> 3:50:46.760]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:50:46.760 --> 3:50:51.080]  Anthony Comea, compoundmedia.com, in at infowars.com.
[3:50:51.080 --> 3:50:52.680]  We'll be back in moments.
[3:50:52.680 --> 3:50:59.680]  You're not strayed.
[3:51:22.680 --> 3:51:52.320]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:51:52.680 --> 3:52:03.440]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:52:03.440 --> 3:52:08.120]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:52:08.120 --> 3:52:09.640]  to detoxify the body.
[3:52:09.640 --> 3:52:14.480]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:52:14.480 --> 3:52:16.000]  It's made in the USA.
[3:52:16.000 --> 3:52:20.880]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:52:20.880 --> 3:52:22.720]  the body and it supports the info war.
[3:52:22.720 --> 3:52:24.960]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:52:24.960 --> 3:52:28.480]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:33.360]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[3:52:33.360 --> 3:52:34.360]  you can possibly get.
[3:52:34.360 --> 3:52:38.280]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[3:52:38.280 --> 3:52:43.280]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:52:43.280 --> 3:52:48.480]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:52:48.480 --> 3:52:52.320]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[3:52:52.320 --> 3:52:53.320]  prayers together.
[3:52:53.320 --> 3:52:54.320]  We're changing the world.
[3:52:54.320 --> 3:52:59.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and FullWarsLife.com.
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:04.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[3:53:04.000 --> 3:53:07.600]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[3:53:07.600 --> 3:53:12.680]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[3:53:12.680 --> 3:53:16.200]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:53:16.200 --> 3:53:20.720]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[3:53:20.720 --> 3:53:21.720]  across America.
[3:53:21.720 --> 3:53:25.600]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[3:53:25.600 --> 3:53:29.320]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[3:53:29.320 --> 3:53:30.320]  healthier I feel.
[3:53:30.320 --> 3:53:32.920]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:53:32.920 --> 3:53:38.120]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[3:53:38.120 --> 3:53:40.600]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[3:53:40.600 --> 3:53:48.800]  Remember your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 that's 866-295-5305 or order

[3:54:20.280 --> 3:54:22.680]  ingredients in the USA.
[3:54:22.680 --> 3:54:29.000]  There's a reason that FEMA reports predicts up to a 395% increase in food prices that
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:30.900]  could trigger mass unrest.
[3:54:30.900 --> 3:54:33.040]  We don't know what's coming, do we?
[3:54:33.040 --> 3:54:36.480]  But we can start getting ready for whatever may happen today.

[3:54:46.600 --> 3:54:48.200]  Welcome back to infowars.com.
[3:54:48.200 --> 3:54:57.000]  I'm Anthony Kumiya, and I want to talk a little bit about the Georgia 6th District Election
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:55:05.920]  that we saw Karen Handel, the first GOP Congresswoman from Georgia.
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:09.280]  An amazing accomplishment for women.
[3:55:09.280 --> 3:55:17.000]  Didn't you see all the feminists and women progressive women celebrating?
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:18.000]  No?
[3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:19.000]  Get it?
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:20.720]  I missed that, too.
[3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:22.960]  I missed that one, too.
[3:55:22.960 --> 3:55:33.680]  The feminist card gets played constantly on a daily basis, and it's usually this horrible
[3:55:33.680 --> 3:55:43.480]  problem that the right has, that conservatives have, Republicans, that they hate women, apparently.
[3:55:43.480 --> 3:55:49.880]  They're misogynistic, they're against women succeeding and breaking that glass ceiling
[3:55:49.880 --> 3:55:50.880]  and whatnot.
[3:55:50.880 --> 3:55:53.880]  Well, here we have a great example.
[3:55:53.880 --> 3:56:02.800]  In Georgia, a woman elected to Congress, a GOP woman, first GOP woman elected to Congress
[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:09.120]  in Georgia, and silence, silence from the left.
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:13.880]  Again, they were very disappointed, the Democrats.
[3:56:13.880 --> 3:56:21.360]  I was watching some of the CNN and MSNBC coverage because I just love how disappointed they
[3:56:21.360 --> 3:56:26.000]  get during elections of late.
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:32.720]  So watching their coverage and seeing again, we got a little tidbit, which reminded me of
[3:56:32.720 --> 3:56:36.520]  the Trump election, of course, the presidential election.
[3:56:36.520 --> 3:56:45.800]  Just watching the horrified faces of the media, CNN, MSNBC, the networks, mainstream media,
[3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:47.400]  just so disappointed.
[3:56:47.400 --> 3:56:52.440]  And seeing that again was just, I loved it.
[3:56:52.440 --> 3:57:01.680]  I can't tell you how fun it is to watch disappointed lefties when their elections go awry.
[3:57:01.680 --> 3:57:06.080]  And again, we watch the media lie about this.
[3:57:06.080 --> 3:57:13.160]  We watched mainstream media throw up political polls that were completely wrong.
[3:57:13.160 --> 3:57:23.120]  They had Ossoff, John Ossoff ahead in the polling and were expecting a victory.
[3:57:23.120 --> 3:57:28.280]  And well, Karen Handel won.
[3:57:28.280 --> 3:57:33.280]  And again, it just shows how there's my favorite picture.
[3:57:33.280 --> 3:57:39.600]  You can just see, look at their faces, who's the guy in the middle there?
[3:57:39.600 --> 3:57:41.000]  Look at his knuckles.
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:42.720]  They couldn't be whiter.
[3:57:42.720 --> 3:57:47.200]  He is so angry and I can't get enough of it.
[3:57:47.200 --> 3:57:51.120]  Just too fun.
[3:57:51.120 --> 3:57:57.120]  They don't understand that when they consistently do what they do, which is lie to the American
[3:57:57.120 --> 3:58:06.240]  people, scandal, cheats, cheat out their own side like we saw Hillary do to Bernie Sanders,
[3:58:06.240 --> 3:58:07.960]  that we don't trust them.
[3:58:07.960 --> 3:58:12.520]  And we are a large portion of the United States of America, contrary to their belief,
[3:58:12.520 --> 3:58:17.960]  that do not appreciate their hijinks and shenanigans.
[3:58:17.960 --> 3:58:23.440]  And every election that has happened since the presidential election, a lot of these
[3:58:23.440 --> 3:58:26.840]  special elections have proven we'll have no part of it.
[3:58:26.840 --> 3:58:28.840]  Thank you very much.
[3:58:28.840 --> 3:58:30.560]  And thank you very much.
[3:58:30.560 --> 3:58:31.560]  Infowars.com.
[3:58:31.560 --> 3:58:34.240]  I'm Anthony Gumiott from CompoundMedia.com.
[3:58:34.240 --> 3:58:35.240]  We'll see you next time.
[3:58:35.240 --> 3:58:36.240]  Again, thank you, Alex.
[3:58:36.240 --> 3:58:59.440]  Have a great day.
