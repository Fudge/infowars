[00:00.000 --> 00:13.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.960 --> 00:40.960]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.960 --> 00:49.280]  Ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday the 20th day of August 2013
[00:49.280 --> 00:55.560]  worldwide transmission and we are going to be taking your phone calls here today and also
[00:55.560 --> 01:03.360]  talking to several different guests on the broadcast John Richardson of Esquire whose
[01:03.360 --> 01:11.760]  father was the CIA section chief in Southeast Asia and Vietnam was assassinated wrote the
[01:11.760 --> 01:20.480]  book my father the spy he also wrote a profile in September issue of Esquire magazine on
[01:20.480 --> 01:25.200]  yours truly but I've got him coming on to talk about the CIA and his dad because it's
[01:25.200 --> 01:31.320]  so historical and informative by the way guys I see here on the sheet he's on for 30 minutes
[01:31.320 --> 01:37.760]  I thought I had him on for an hour I just see that there there this morning so let's
[01:37.760 --> 01:43.200]  give him a call and find out what's going on with that he is on for an hour okay that's
[01:43.200 --> 01:48.160]  what I thought it just says 1230 and so that's what we've got guest wise today so we'll
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.560]  have open phones in this hour and we'll also have open phones once I give the number out
[01:52.560 --> 02:03.160]  into the third hour as well today wow there is a lot to cover a lot to cover here today
[02:03.160 --> 02:10.120]  I already knew this was happening and you can see it clearly going on I genuinely and
[02:10.120 --> 02:16.200]  generally agree with Rand Paul that the United States needs to cut off all foreign aid and
[02:16.200 --> 02:21.200]  not have foreign entanglements that George Washington talked about because obviously
[02:21.200 --> 02:25.000]  corporate interests are just going to come lobby the government to take care of their
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.080]  interest not US interest now if Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean are robbing US ships
[02:34.080 --> 02:39.920]  Thomas Jefferson as president sent the Marines in to clean their clocks so I do believe in
[02:39.920 --> 02:45.480]  that type of action to defend ourselves but 90 plus percent of what the US does is totally
[02:45.480 --> 02:50.080]  unconstitutional and it's done to actually undermine our interest by multinational globalist
[02:50.080 --> 02:54.200]  I mean just look what globalism is done to us we pay for everything they do we don't even
[02:54.200 --> 03:03.240]  get any of the spoils so it's not just unconstitutional and immoral it's a bad deal it's a bad deal
[03:03.240 --> 03:09.000]  but once you meddle in Egypt I mean I agree with Rand Paul five years ago cut the funds
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.560]  off three years ago cut it off but since our government basically ordered the Egyptian
[03:14.560 --> 03:18.480]  military to remove housing mubarak and then you notice he disappeared he had a stroke
[03:18.480 --> 03:25.760]  he or he was in jail all that made up he's now being released he's just fine the 31 year
[03:25.760 --> 03:30.560]  US backed dictator when back when there was a policy of having a stable area and some
[03:30.560 --> 03:38.440]  freedom and over there I'm not defending mubarak but as dictators go he was a lot better by
[03:38.440 --> 03:43.160]  several orders of magnitude than the Muslim Brotherhood in Al Qaeda and the rest of those
[03:43.160 --> 03:50.000]  people and and and then Google and and and the tax-free foundations with Obama on record
[03:50.000 --> 03:58.600]  they brag about this I'll talk about this coming up they went and they fund it on record
[03:58.600 --> 04:05.400]  this Arab Spring and mubarak wouldn't go along with overthrowing Gadabi so they removed him
[04:05.400 --> 04:10.120]  and now basically the old guards back in charge and the council on foreign relations has figured
[04:10.120 --> 04:14.400]  out they can't double cross them now that's failed to another jumping back over partially
[04:14.400 --> 04:22.000]  but Obama according to Newsweek and establishment hacks because it comes out the Daily Beast
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  and that's coming out of the White House that's on that's that's come out that oh I don't
[04:27.000 --> 04:34.520]  worry to everybody being critical of Obama who wants to see bedlam over the Middle East
[04:34.520 --> 04:40.120]  he's cut off aid to the military of Egypt and undoubtedly I would want to live under
[04:40.120 --> 04:45.120]  military dictatorship it's just that what they're putting in is a Islamist dictatorship
[04:45.120 --> 04:48.760]  that's running around burning down all the churches and our government wants that to
[04:48.760 --> 04:53.480]  happen it just shows no matter whoever the worst people are the globalists are going
[04:53.480 --> 04:57.880]  to fund them the worst of evils they're going to fund them the most effective evils they're
[04:57.880 --> 05:04.760]  going to find them is hurricane and wildfire season again by two thousands of people sit

[09:45.720 --> 09:51.480]  the phones up after i mentioned some of the headlines here in the first hour and then intersperse
[09:51.480 --> 09:59.400]  things with the news let me just give you the headlines here we'll see if i can do it without
[09:59.400 --> 10:06.440]  stopping on one of them and going off on a jag egypt massacre of police raises fears of growing
[10:06.440 --> 10:15.400]  geodactivity in sinai they've also taken nuns and others hostage and have burned down more than 20
[10:15.400 --> 10:22.120]  more churches in the last 24 hours it's now in the hundreds the daily beast which is a white
[10:22.120 --> 10:27.400]  house organ so they're bragging through it a senator obama administration secretly
[10:27.400 --> 10:31.800]  has suspended military aid to egypt now you don't need to know that they support them
[10:32.440 --> 10:37.240]  they helped put them in power two years ago they helped put morris the empower google brags
[10:37.240 --> 10:41.640]  they met with mi6 the cia four years ago to start this whole arab spring
[10:44.600 --> 10:51.480]  it is absolutely insane to see all of this all of this unfolding
[10:51.480 --> 10:59.880]  and to see the public not understanding what's happening and again i'm not saying the military
[10:59.880 --> 11:06.600]  junta is a good group the point is the globalists are trying to remove it so that they can bring
[11:06.600 --> 11:12.680]  the country into absolute civil war and start the destabilization even beyond what it is the
[11:12.680 --> 11:20.760]  entire mentally so we're going to be getting in uh to uh that report uh today we can show the tv
[11:20.760 --> 11:28.440]  viewers the document cam shot of that article it's up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[11:28.440 --> 11:33.160]  dot com also we're going to be getting into this stack of news as you know yesterday
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.040]  this is all part of the new pentagon psi op to make them think that they're telling the truth
[11:38.040 --> 11:43.640]  they've come out this week and said oh area 51 is it was a secret black site for testing secret
[11:43.640 --> 11:49.640]  aircraft which is what we told you all along no no space aliens none of that toxic waste is dumped
[11:49.640 --> 11:57.800]  there and then secret skunk works drone projects black man a project space plane projects it goes
[11:57.800 --> 12:03.960]  back to the youtube project in the 40s that's what goes on there sr 71 black birds in the 50s
[12:03.960 --> 12:09.000]  that's what goes on there so they're now admitting admitting that they're now admitting cia confirming
[12:09.000 --> 12:21.000]  role in 1953 coup uh in iran but redacting most of it we already know because mi 60 classified
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.720]  some of it and kermit roosevelt that the grandson of president roosevelt uh actually of kettie
[12:27.720 --> 12:35.320]  roosevelt for that president uh who ran the operation cia joint operation with mi 6 admits
[12:35.320 --> 12:40.600]  how he did it he wrote a bestselling book on it that was published in 1999 he did an mpr interview
[12:40.600 --> 12:45.960]  we've aired it here where they admit they staged terror attacks and blamed it on the government
[12:46.840 --> 12:53.480]  as the type of a double cross false flag and then brought in the muslim extremist to take over
[12:53.480 --> 13:00.200]  then double crossed them and brought in the princeling shaw then double crossed him in 1979
[13:00.200 --> 13:10.040]  and put in the ayatollahumani oh you didn't you didn't know that yeah absolutely absolutely incredible
[13:11.000 --> 13:19.640]  what's going on on that front absolutely uh insane what's going on on that front so we're
[13:19.640 --> 13:27.080]  going to be breaking uh that down uh today uh in more detail and the policies they carry out
[13:27.080 --> 13:31.880]  against other countries are the policies the globalists are carrying out against our country
[13:31.880 --> 13:37.960]  but in a more incremental form that they can get away with in the whole divide and conquer program
[13:38.680 --> 13:48.200]  and they just do it over and over again it's a it's a it's a system it's a methodology uh it's a
[13:48.200 --> 13:59.240]  program uh it is a mindset so we're going to be uh going over all of those reports as well
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.280]  uh and of course it's come out everybody's like why aren't you covering princess diana
[14:04.280 --> 14:12.040]  and the reports killed by uh paramilitary police because this is another distraction of course the
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.000]  the the the the military shoots their mouths off about killing her that is who killed her we even know
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.120]  who killed her it all came out weeks after that they turned the cameras off ran into the wall
[14:22.120 --> 14:27.320]  she was alive struggling drug in by the special forces into the ambulance that took 45 minutes
[14:27.320 --> 14:33.080]  to go to the hospital five minutes away and they killed her and there was videotapes and and and
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.560]  diaries and her butler and her friends and i've even met her cook
[14:37.560 --> 14:47.560]  cook when i was in the home of a hollywood star and the point is is this all well known
[14:47.560 --> 14:52.440]  prince charles said in the letter i'm going to kill you in a fake car wreck if you don't stop
[14:52.440 --> 15:01.400]  dating that arab and they captured i mean they staged the the gulf of tonkin they staged the
[15:01.400 --> 15:07.880]  iranian coup it's all come out just like we told you they killed prince diana it all came out people
[15:07.880 --> 15:13.320]  always say well this stuff was going on it would come out it does all come out so see i'm kind of
[15:13.320 --> 15:19.560]  mentioning the news here but halfway getting to it rt reports tepco that's a tokyo electric power
[15:19.560 --> 15:26.920]  company admits a leakage of 300 tons of water with with uh monstrous radiation levels in it
[15:26.920 --> 15:34.920]  that's up on info wars dot com that's just the latest admission uh also uh we're going to get
[15:34.920 --> 15:45.400]  into some of the border news that i have here today abc news reporting what could happen
[15:45.400 --> 15:51.080]  if border asylum claims keep rising yeah they've they've doubled a month ago and now they've doubled
[15:51.080 --> 15:56.760]  again so what do they call that quadruple because anybody that can get across the border it's
[15:56.760 --> 16:01.960]  over 30 million right now instantly becomes a citizen or on the path of citizenship and then
[16:01.960 --> 16:11.160]  you can even be a felon you're allowed to stay and then that ties into a report here illegal
[16:11.160 --> 16:16.600]  snared as immigration debate continues they arrested a couple hundred and one of those show
[16:16.600 --> 16:21.160]  arrest deals they always do right when they're trying to pass the end of the america and the
[16:21.160 --> 16:25.560]  north american union i mean that that's what immigration reform is is integration by stealth
[16:25.560 --> 16:33.240]  according to the spp documents ban for canada uh september 2007 judicial watch got those documents
[16:33.240 --> 16:38.520]  obama administration makes secret deal with mexico to help illegal immigrants in the workplace
[16:39.160 --> 16:44.200]  michael schneider american dreamblog has that it's up on info wars dot com and it's actually in an eoc
[16:44.200 --> 16:48.840]  press release that obama made the secret deal to legalize the illegals well yeah we already knew
[16:48.840 --> 16:54.440]  that but but now it's just more more more more confirmation an incredible video we're gonna air
[16:54.440 --> 17:01.720]  a clip of mark dice again goes out and ask obama supporters to sign petition to put carcinogens
[17:01.720 --> 17:06.840]  in the water supply yeah i want i want my rep and of course they all agree if it's for obama
[17:07.640 --> 17:12.920]  i want my reporters to go out and do the same thing and say we want to put cancer viruses
[17:12.920 --> 17:19.800]  in the vaccines to reduce population so that you know obama care doesn't go bankrupt for obama care
[17:19.800 --> 17:26.440]  we're gonna we want to put cancer viruses in the vaccines with carcinogens and then say it's for
[17:26.440 --> 17:32.760]  trending us if you say it's for trendy and talk in a voice an mpr voice they have to sign it
[17:34.920 --> 17:39.320]  we've gone out and said and of course this thing got replicated by a bunch of different
[17:39.320 --> 17:44.040]  reporters i'm glad they did it pro-life group and i think dice it as well we all imitate each other
[17:44.040 --> 17:47.400]  we're all in the same fight here you know whatever works let's do it to illustrate things
[17:47.400 --> 17:52.280]  thanks hey we're going to kill babies up to age three now for the earth for obama oh yes
[17:52.280 --> 17:55.800]  we're going to kill old people now for the earth for obama oh good i don't want to live
[17:56.840 --> 18:01.000]  we need to show how they've just embraced total enslavement
[18:03.480 --> 18:09.480]  because i've never seen a group more you've got to go to the trendy areas of oslo the
[18:09.480 --> 18:14.120]  trendy areas of la the trendy areas of dallas the trendy areas of miami or
[18:14.120 --> 18:18.760]  trendy areas of new york and you can walk right up and say let's arrest all gun owners
[18:19.320 --> 18:24.840]  and put them in you know let look i want to send our reporters out and do the report i wanted to do
[18:24.840 --> 18:31.400]  where we go out and say please sign a petition to confiscate all firearms in austin texas just
[18:31.400 --> 18:40.120]  to illustrate they're ready to go like that republicans song i'm hot i'm ready to go on the rooftop

[19:00.360 --> 19:05.160]  if you say for obama i think you could say you know for the earth and everything we want to throw
[19:05.160 --> 19:12.360]  dogs and woodchippers for obama i don't think they would go along with that because it's a doggie
[19:12.360 --> 19:17.880]  because see people are all dehumanized now they don't care if humans are dying but if you show marines
[19:17.880 --> 19:22.520]  throwing a dog off a cliff people freaked out said alex that's fake they had michelle mouthing
[19:22.520 --> 19:26.200]  to not say i was a liar it was fake even though they reprimanded them later after the video and
[19:26.200 --> 19:31.080]  admitted they did it that they were drunk when they did it you know the whole point is is that they
[19:31.080 --> 19:36.280]  did do that everybody it was international news oh it's so horrible but if they throw a kid off a
[19:36.280 --> 19:41.480]  cliff it's like i show what it's a haji kill him anyways you know using the kind of racist slur
[19:42.920 --> 19:48.360]  but then it's also with the ford hood shooter you're not allowed to call him a jihadist because

[33:34.680 --> 33:38.840]  coming up
[33:41.480 --> 33:48.360]  i'm going to have a chance to talk to john richardson who is one of the top two or three
[33:48.360 --> 33:54.360]  profilers in the country he's the main profile writer for esquire magazine and uh he did have
[33:54.360 --> 33:59.960]  to buck them to get this published they cut about three thousand words out and found the most
[33:59.960 --> 34:05.320]  unflattering photo they could have me uh in there but because they said you know hey you give us a
[34:05.320 --> 34:09.240]  battle cry and then they took a photo of that but i don't mind it gets people to read it in the final
[34:09.240 --> 34:15.240]  equation uh but i'm not really getting him on uh to talk about alex jones i think we've done enough
[34:15.240 --> 34:22.680]  of that i'm getting him on to talk about all the amazing profiles he's done he did the last big one
[34:22.680 --> 34:29.240]  with charleston heston i mean you name it he's done it and um he's going to be joining us to also
[34:29.240 --> 34:34.920]  talk about his book that i've got a copy of somewhere here in the office my father the spy
[34:36.440 --> 34:42.600]  and his father was the cia section chief in southeast asia during some very very very famous
[34:42.600 --> 34:49.960]  times uh and uh during the vietnam war and so we're going to be talking about that in light
[34:49.960 --> 34:56.520]  of the cia confirming its role in 1953 iran coup the only reason they're confirming all this stuff
[34:56.520 --> 35:01.640]  they hadn't previously done is what the pentagon said three weeks ago they've got to stop lying so
[35:01.640 --> 35:07.000]  much because they've lost all credibility with the people so they're going to come out and go okay
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.440]  we have secret aircraft at error 51 gee we didn't already know that they've only been photographed
[35:12.440 --> 35:18.360]  hundreds of times conservatively out there really it's thousands of times i just say hundreds because
[35:18.360 --> 35:22.840]  thousands sounds like too much but people out there every day taking photos and stuff flying around
[35:22.840 --> 35:27.800]  and then no it's not ufo's folks it's secret aircraft so they're come out with that and okay
[35:28.520 --> 35:35.720]  60 years ago we helped stage a coup but we're not going to tell you how and they're just coming out
[35:35.720 --> 35:41.160]  with a lot of stuff that's already known because they want you to trust them but that's not going
[35:41.160 --> 35:48.280]  to work either because the system is unraveling everyone knows the economy is not as good as it
[35:48.280 --> 35:53.480]  used to be everybody knows the economy is command and control to a great extent but then after he
[35:53.480 --> 36:00.520]  joins us i've got the head uh the i guess the president of e-foods direct coming on our big
[36:00.520 --> 36:05.720]  food sponsor but they're coming on not as an infomercial today but for 15 minutes i twisted
[36:05.720 --> 36:09.880]  his arm singer you hearing about big food companies getting calls from homeland security wanting to
[36:09.880 --> 36:15.240]  buy a bunch of food and he said yeah no no we've been contacted to uh let me check with the board
[36:15.240 --> 36:19.480]  and see if we can talk about it so he can talk about he's going to come on and talk about what's
[36:19.480 --> 36:24.520]  happening because we've written articles about homeland security not just buying bullets by the
[36:24.520 --> 36:29.720]  billions but uh buying storeable food and stuff and of course uh they bought enough ammo six million
[36:29.720 --> 36:37.240]  rounds was it nine million i forget how many millions that did did did tsa buy that uh came out
[36:37.240 --> 36:46.920]  yesterday i know that it was enough bullets for each tsa person to shoot 9 000 plus a day
[36:46.920 --> 36:53.560]  for 365 days out of the year and that's just the latest purchase
[36:55.720 --> 37:00.760]  so that was a very important article yeah a press tv of all people picked up our article it was tsa
[37:00.760 --> 37:05.560]  to purchase 3.5 million rounds of ammunition it all it all runs together and the army's buying
[37:05.560 --> 37:11.560]  millions of ak47s to drop the supply and and and all this i mean it's just out of control so uh
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.200]  we're going to have a steve shank of efoodsdirect.com slash alex someone's will make it a plug don't
[37:16.200 --> 37:20.440]  use coming up uh great storeable food company they have free shipping this month so check it
[37:20.440 --> 37:30.600]  out efoodsdirect.com slash alex i can't mention the sponsor without doing a plug for him so that's
[37:30.600 --> 37:36.520]  what's coming up uh the toll-free number to join us here on air on some of the issues i've just
[37:36.520 --> 37:42.760]  mentioned uh what do you make of the announcement by the eoc and others that that that the illegal
[37:42.760 --> 37:47.640]  aliens they're going to make sure that none of them get deported in a secret deal with obama so
[37:47.640 --> 37:54.120]  it's already uh amnesty by fiat and and then my only issue is i can't go to mexico and work
[37:54.120 --> 37:59.160]  i can't go to mexico and do whatever i want i i i mean i can go to mexico and get shaken down
[37:59.160 --> 38:03.720]  and thrown in a jail cell so why is america supposed to be wide open and get free welfare
[38:03.720 --> 38:08.680]  to everybody because we're here to get bankrupt all that land once we're totally bankrupt what's
[38:08.680 --> 38:17.000]  your take on that uh what's your take on senator obama administration secretly uh suspended military
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.880]  aid to egypt that's what a senator's saying that's out of the daily beast has decided to privately
[38:23.880 --> 38:29.640]  to act as military takeover of egypt was a coup temporarily suspending most forms of military
[38:29.640 --> 38:36.200]  aid despite deciding not to announce publicly a coup determination one way or another according
[38:36.200 --> 38:47.240]  to a leading u.s senator and why are they now coming out and saying things like that because
[38:47.240 --> 38:55.400]  this is just the public pronunciation or pronunciation or announcement of what the real policy is to
[38:58.360 --> 39:02.840]  call it the democratization of the middle east to finance the muslim brotherhood in al qaeda
[39:03.400 --> 39:09.800]  to invade countries like syria and libya but to politically invade areas and go to the streets
[39:09.800 --> 39:15.880]  and take over egypt and then go around killing their enemies muslim minorities christians
[39:15.880 --> 39:20.680]  blowing up churches killing police and then and then seeing in anderson cooper says oh a more
[39:20.680 --> 39:25.160]  protesters were killed today and then you read the foreign news it shows video of them throwing
[39:25.160 --> 39:31.080]  mall off cocktails at the police stations shooting police they killed 20 something yesterday in fact
[39:31.080 --> 39:37.560]  i have the let me just not mention it let me just show you the article uh london guardian egypt
[39:37.560 --> 39:45.560]  massacre of police raises fears of growing jihad activity in the cyanide 25 military people
[39:45.560 --> 39:49.880]  killed executed in cyanide desert after days of bloodshed in which hundreds of muslim brotherhood
[39:49.880 --> 39:58.600]  supporters have died and then also the muslim brotherhood folks got caught doing on on what this
[39:58.600 --> 40:02.520]  weekend curtain them i'll put the video up on info wars dot com but nobody else i've seen in
[40:02.520 --> 40:07.720]  press has covered it and i think that warrants an article a fake massacre video i mean it's
[40:07.720 --> 40:12.680]  clearly fake and they caught the jihadis doing that in syria on seeing in in a live feed that the
[40:12.680 --> 40:19.480]  russians recorded and released doing okay now i do fake shooting huh i bring in dead bodies
[40:19.480 --> 40:25.560]  hey i mean it's just just unbelievable folks the way they put out in fact you guys can look that up
[40:25.560 --> 40:32.120]  was on info wars i think saturday's type in uh uh you know in egypt fake massacre video and then it
[40:32.120 --> 40:38.760]  shows it clearly fake massacre video and and our media goes and films that probably is directing it
[40:38.760 --> 40:44.440]  and then goes look at the massacre so if ten get killed our media says a hundred got killed
[40:45.320 --> 40:49.000]  again i'm not even taking sides here i believe in not having all these foreign
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.760]  entanglements like torres washington said now there it is video shows fake muslim brotherhood
[40:54.760 --> 40:59.080]  protesters staging deaths and injuries i mean we got to get somebody to an article on that and
[40:59.080 --> 41:03.160]  then tie it into in iran you know the lady that gets shot the blood comes out her mouth turned
[41:03.160 --> 41:09.000]  up that was fake i mean you know not everybody's a good actor like barack obama when he lies to you
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.040]  it actually comes off like he's telling the truth i mean it's it's hard to find liars that good folks
[41:14.040 --> 41:21.480]  he's better than bill clinton uh but uh you know these guys when they do this the the fake stuff
[41:21.480 --> 41:30.120]  it's just ridiculous it's very bad acting and my point is is that this isn't being done for
[41:30.120 --> 41:36.200]  american interest to begin with it's bad enough to do corrupt underhanded things you know in desperate
[41:36.200 --> 41:40.840]  situations to preserve the basic foundation of liberty that's how all this evil started they
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.480]  got good men to do bad stuff in the name of well the communists are so bad let's stage a false flag
[41:45.480 --> 41:51.960]  in southern vietnam uh so that uh we can you know get the people behind us and blame it on the
[41:51.960 --> 41:57.400]  communist show because they'll do a greater evil if we don't you don't become the good guy out of
[41:57.400 --> 42:02.680]  that you become the bad guy speaking of that here's the video and audio that i mentioned it's up on

[42:09.400 --> 42:14.600]  what in the world happened to us and it's just straight talk ladies and gentlemen

[42:56.920 --> 43:01.560]  dare you even talk like that well that's why you've run everybody off is by beating them over the head

[43:06.040 --> 43:10.360]  how about henry kissinger our god henry kissinger is endorsing chris christie right now

[43:14.760 --> 43:20.600]  after rand paul's butt trying to shoot him down that tells you rand paul's good i mean you got to
[43:20.600 --> 43:28.760]  decide who you're going to serve folks and people in real positions of power that are good understand
[43:28.760 --> 43:33.400]  the great honor of being a servant because by lifting others up you lift yourself up and teach

[44:06.920 --> 44:13.080]  be tolerant of all your new world order garbage it's not being tolerant it's an invasion the
[44:13.080 --> 44:19.240]  borders being open is a invasion that the globalists are financing and codifying to destroy america
[44:19.240 --> 44:23.720]  not to empower people that are coming in it's a lot in fissura a la rica conquista on record
[44:23.720 --> 44:29.720]  ford foundation funded the whole gay agenda the way it's pushed from the top isn't about tolerance
[44:30.520 --> 44:35.160]  and then accept and then accepting and then adoption that's what it's about and then it's
[44:35.160 --> 44:41.160]  like hey i'm tired of hearing i'm square so i'm bad i don't want anybody sexualizing five six
[44:41.160 --> 44:47.000]  seven-year-old kids in school heterosexual homosexual and how dare they be able to the the

[44:51.800 --> 44:58.040]  organization they admit they're using gay rights to go sexualize kids in school would they let
[44:58.040 --> 45:04.040]  them teach five-year-olds about heterosexual sex for tolerance don't know only cc see and then they
[45:04.040 --> 45:09.960]  turn around and go oh and then have salon come out and say i'm bashing gay people when i'm not
[45:12.680 --> 45:19.080]  i'm saying your agenda has been hijacked and taken over and now is nothing but like a bunch of holy
[45:19.080 --> 45:23.880]  rollers on the street corner screaming everybody's going to hell beating everybody over the head
[45:23.880 --> 45:28.600]  with the bible where everybody runs the other direction and it's the same thing with this whole
[45:28.600 --> 45:35.800]  militant gay agenda just shut i mean i'm sick of every tv show every fiction book i buy every kid
[45:35.800 --> 45:41.160]  show i try to turn on in a hotel room when i'm on vacation with my kids is shoving stuff at kids
[45:41.160 --> 45:46.520]  it's pedophilia see i mean that's what i'm saying it's sick and that's how they get this agenda
[45:46.520 --> 45:51.560]  through ladies and gentlemen because they know they want to attack the family because when the
[45:51.560 --> 45:57.080]  family falls now the state will be the the the center of gravity for the individuals that

[46:27.480 --> 46:31.960]  on the issue of abortion and see the churches would be full if we had preachers like this
[46:31.960 --> 46:37.560]  who were just lay organic lovers of liberty and see that's why the bible show and the redneck
[46:37.560 --> 46:43.560]  shows and stuff were also popular because people are sick of the fake stuff and even if it's goofy
[46:43.560 --> 46:48.920]  looking and the guy looks like gandalf people like it because they know it's not the synthetic fake
[46:48.920 --> 46:55.880]  garbage now let's go out to a powerful little sermon then we'll come back stay with us it's impossible

[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.040]  old folks i love that have hunchbacks my point is is that the globalist are really evil
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:47.960]  characters of like evil witches and uh you know got quasi moto the lovable hunchback my point is
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.600]  is that they're wicked they're twisted they're inbred they're hateful they're always digging up
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:58.120]  dead little kids on their property and i mean it's just these are sick filth i mean they really are
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.480]  sick filth and they decided the whole planet's theirs and they're in charge because they're
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:09.480]  intelligent and ruthless and it's time for us to stop being such such such just pushovers good men
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.400]  have stood down and let evil take over and it's time to reverse the tide okay that's what i'm saying
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:22.280]  and the battle for civilization is going to be fought when it's going to start here in america
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.360]  you know that the greatest evil is here the greatest good is here people ask why is there
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:33.160]  that paradox it's always that way history's happening right now folks it's time to get
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.000]  aggressive i don't call it arrogant it's not arrogance it's that you're in the right
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.960]  and you are standing up and don't be timid the number one thing is be confident in your fight
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:49.800]  for liberty notice they're always telling us be timid don't be timid in politics that's how you get
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:55.000]  ahead meanwhile they're all arrogant and aggressive because they are running the show let's talk to
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:02.040]  scott in california you're on the air sir go ahead hey alex i i just had a uh
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:10.280]  uh i've been a uh diabetic for uh 27 years i got from a vaccine when i was five um dr
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:17.080]  dr couldn't tell me that um but my question was do you know anything about cures that have
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:23.720]  been have happened but they don't go because the companies can't make any money off of a cured disease
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.120]  hello uh yes sir i'm listening to your phone was breaking up a bit uh go ahead
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:39.320]  you're asking me a question yeah i had a question about uh being a diabetic
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.960]  yeah yeah and um just if there's any cures out there and these things have been kind of uh
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.600]  covered up i i know somebody that's why i've been a cancer company and um
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.960]  well listen i want to explain this i want to explain this there are a lot of treatments
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:03:00.040]  that have been proven in many studies to help with cancer to help with diabetes some people can
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:05.160]  reverse depending on the type of diabetes they have or slow it down ray Kurzweil says he's he's
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:11.160]  cured his undoubtedly a lot of it's a diet but if your pancreas is already completely shot
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.280]  or depending i've had medical doctors on i'm no expert on this it it depends but anybody that says
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.840]  we can diagnose cancer we can cure it we can you know a hundred percent is full of baloney
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:31.080]  uh undoubtedly uh there are a lot of vitamins minerals treatments things that if you just
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.040]  get off the gmo you get off the aspartame you get off the processed sugar you start exercising
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:41.560]  you stop eating the gluten i mean a lot of people on record are able to reverse it and and you know
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.200]  control it down to the point where the doctors go well you're in remission but you still have it
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.720]  because technically they don't want to say it can be cured because it can always come back but
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:59.000]  we know this diabetes is up several thousand percentage points uh from what it was uh just a
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.840]  few decades ago you looked that up yourself so the biggest thing is don't get it to begin with
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:11.320]  and of course some of it is genetic but it's kind of like a pre-distribute you can have a genetic
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:19.560]  predisposition to be extremely uh skinny or you could have a genetic predistrib uh predistrib what
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:26.200]  do we call it to like go bald or something like that but if you do certain things it makes you
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:31.800]  not go bald as quick or so there's mitigating things they want to make it all about well you've
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:37.880]  just got this genetically so that's why you know you've got diabetes now not know with your genetics
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.120]  if you eat a bunch of processed sugar it's over and it's like Native Americans on average with
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.600]  their genetics on average are known to not be able to handle alcohol that's a fact whereas
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.360]  in northern european that come from thousands of years people drinking like fish everybody that
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:55.000]  couldn't handle it already died so people passed on genetic traits people to drink a lot more
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:03.240]  yeah so so again that's what we're talking about here protecting your home with a security system

[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:28.680]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.840]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're going to go to your phone calls coming up here
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:44.360]  in a few minutes we're now well into the second hour coming up at the bottom of the hour we're
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:51.080]  going to be joined by one of the top profilers not fbi profilers guys that writes big profiles
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.040]  john richardson best-selling author as well he wrote a big profile on yours truly an
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:00.920]  esquire that's not why he's joining us his dad was a cia section chief in vietnam
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.760]  during the beginnings of the vietnam war and the assassination of viet din
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:14.200]  then and he is going to be joining us to talk about that in light of all the new cia news
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.920]  that has come out and more and then i'm going to ask him about some of his
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:25.000]  favorite profiles he's done them all i mean presidents prime ministers rock stars the
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.960]  movie stars all of them a really interesting person and and i knew when i saw he did he
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.920]  did the big ron paul profile that was positive a few years ago he's what you call a classical
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:43.960]  liberal i knew that if he did a fake profile on me a hit piece that would hurt him doing other
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.000]  profiles because real profilers there's not many of them are known for being real journalists or
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.800]  real reporters so he did a positive profile and it's got the left and the right pulling
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:59.000]  their hair out reason magazine wrote a nice article about it and it got a few things wrong
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.960]  or out of context because i you know i do nuance things of course they cut 3000 words out of it so
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.280]  that uh i can ask john on air what happened with that but i would explain i understand in
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:13.800]  rape or incest why women get abortions but the agenda behind abortion is dehumanization
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.400]  and now they're talking about killing babies after birth that's why it's a state issue and
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:23.000]  i'm pro-life well that turns into i understand women get abortions that's not that's out of context
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.600]  or or hey i i'm not against you know gay people you know who love each other or whatever my whole
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:34.440]  point is i'm not a hater i don't hate somebody because you know just who they are i i hate the
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:40.840]  agenda that's been caboost on to that whole thing of anti-family and sexualization of children
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:46.280]  that shouldn't be going on heterosexual or homosexual and that just turns into alex isn't
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:51.160]  isn't anti-gay you know you know my whole thing is i'm not here to be divisive i'm not here to fight
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:56.600]  with people okay i'm here to try to get a bill of rights liberty culture i am a libertarian
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:01.800]  but other than that and i guess he's trying to make me look good to the left or something i mean
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.440]  it's really a sweetheart piece and he said he was getting a lot of heat for it before it even came out
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.720]  so that's why they cut thousands of words out that i guess expose the new world order
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:18.120]  he had no control over that and uh but i'm already digressing off into that i want to go your phone
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:25.880]  calls uh here today uh it's just that anybody who really listens to the show knows that we're
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.600]  the opposite of pushing racism msnbc says i'm deeply racist and behind the boss and bombing
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:36.040]  and shows don't prove that shows folks that and there's a bunch of other tv shows and publications
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:41.480]  attacking us too i don't usually cover it all because it gets boring but just know this we're
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:49.000]  on the mark they're upset about what we're doing now i'm i'm gonna play a clip here because this
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.280]  really illustrates uh why we had our big video contest you can see the amazing top entries
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:02.600]  at info wars dot com forward slash uh paul for paul revere 115 thousand dollars you know i probably
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.880]  should have done about 30 000 i want to do something really big to see what would happen
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:10.280]  to find filmmakers later to work with that was the main goal but secondarily to make a bunch of
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:15.640]  great films that millions would see on different angles of liberty to kind of have that pure organic
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:23.320]  pure research uh to not where it's my my lens my my darkly my rose color dark dark darkly my
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:31.160]  my scanner darkly but through your eyes something really pure and organic from every angle that
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.960]  happened the white house and health and human services the same ones that say it's racist to
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:42.680]  oppose the foreign bank written rape the public care known as obama care i mean just so nightmarish
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.040]  i i it's so bad it's a joke i mean i can't even just say all the stuff it's just it's more than
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:55.480]  50 things it does doubling your premiums not covering pre-existing conditions uh not unplugging
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:01.560]  granting not giving care to people not giving above 65 cataract surgery not giving you hip surgery
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:09.320]  uh and not giving people lifesaving stuff but death panels in control just just written by
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:16.200]  insurance companies to rob you that fundamentally makes me angry to then have snot knows authoritarians
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.600]  they call themselves liberals in austin on man on the street videos we've done laugh at us and go
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:27.400]  i'm with obama i like it racist i mean you're just shallow dumbasses excuse me folks i prayed to god
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.960]  that i stopped engaging in mild profanity my kids listen my wife doesn't like it i don't mean to do
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:37.080]  it i just it's the word that comes in i want to say what i think these people are and i mean i guess
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:41.640]  that's not bad that it means they're a donkey so technically i can say that the point is i'm trying
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:46.600]  to be clean here because i i don't want to really fly off the handle okay it's just that watching

[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:16.280]  north carolina you're on the air sir i appreciate you calling in today yeah thanks alex i just wanted
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:23.240]  to speak briefly to your uh primarily specifically to your uh your young uh new listeners veterans
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:30.200]  and active duty military uh i've been listening to talk radio for about 23 years now and i pretty
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:37.480]  much heard it all uh it was a big rush limbaugh follower for 16 years uh so i know i know his
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:43.080]  whole diet tribe i know all of that but uh there's a general that you probably uh didn't learn about
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:49.880]  in basic training or boot camp and his name is smedley buttler he was a marine corps general he was a
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.000]  two-time recipient of the congressional medal of honor you might want to go look him up on the
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:03.480]  internet his name is smedley butler but he wrote a little book called war is a racket and that's
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:10.520]  exactly what it was then and it's exactly what it is today but i wanted to uh you know for the
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:17.480]  young listeners out there that are new to all this uh there there are these war cheerleaders on
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:23.480]  mainstream talk radio you know rush limbaugh shon handity glimb back bellow riley i'd go on and on
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:29.400]  and on uh for the past 20 years on my local radio stations uh there's one thing all of these people
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:36.440]  have in common but not one of them ever served in the united states military you might want to
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:44.520]  think about that and go look up what smedley butler said well notice that uh smedley darlinjan butler
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:55.800]  frank also stopped a coup that was planned by people in the u.s government namely uh prescott
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:02.200]  bush was the german front guy and was able to stop it they tried to hire him because he was
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:07.240]  an anti-communist at the time the argument was hey well the nazi fascist government said the
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:12.040]  communist so they always give you those different choices of tyranny and he said how about america
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.040]  how about a republic and he was able to blow the whistle on it and they had the mccormick
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.920]  dixie committee hearings about it later but it got swept under the rug because it was such a big deal
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:26.280]  and i'm not defending prescott bush either but at the time you know hitler was like man of the year
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:33.240]  in time magazine and like 37 and 39 he was a great guy so you know that's how prescott bush got his
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:38.680]  power was being one of their head bankers here in the u.s but under the haramans and others
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:45.800]  they were going to have a coup in the u.s and when that failed they came up with the plan of cog
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:51.880]  if they could build a continuity of government system to to stop a foreign takeover they could
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:58.920]  use that program just like they tried to use it in operation valkyrie against hitler legitimately
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:05.320]  they were going to use cog illegitimately to take over america and that's what homeland security is
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:12.760]  is cog and it's the cog is now heating up and dissolving the old republic because you had the
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:17.000]  old republic still there like an old bridge and they built a new bridge that's tyranny
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:22.200]  and now they're tearing down the old bridge we're now going into that that process does that make
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:28.280]  sense to you caller yeah do you ever get that information back in january of 2009 where rush
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:33.800]  limbaugh went on that uh rant where he explained that he'd been lying all these years and he he
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.800]  started talking about the new world order uh cfr bill bergs how there was this elite group of people
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:45.160]  that actually controlled that the uh president uh congress yeah i think that was dark i think that
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:51.560]  was dark satire though uh because we all know cfr doesn't exist limbaugh said we're on the march

[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:36.920]  it's alex johns again ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us today it is the 20th
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:44.920]  day of august 2013 on this tuesday edition and i can actually say we have a mainstream journalist
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:49.320]  i don't know for how long writing a decent piece on me rescuer on who actually did everything he
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.720]  said he did he wrote a i think a fair piece it has some stuff in there that's negative because
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:59.080]  i i i am negative in some ways i agree with some of the points in there that don't put me in that
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:04.200]  good of a light because none of us are perfect but john richardson did what he said he would do
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:10.520]  and i think that's the first time i've had a big mainstream writer for one of the big magazines
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:15.480]  actually keep their word i mean texas monthly did it to a certain extent but was even a little
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:21.960]  more negative and i think unfair in some ways but that writer did a pretty good job but i'd
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.760]  had him on before about tulia texas where they locked up every black person in the town in the
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:33.000]  jail owned by the judge basically uh so he he knew i was a good guy because i'd had him on helping
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.760]  get his story out nationwide on tulia texas and he did somewhat of a fair piece and and and you
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.160]  know rolling stone wasn't that bad because these profilers know that if they go out into a period
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:49.720]  piece people are going to go read it and realize man this guy you know makes stuff up but uh i was
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.120]  worried you know saying i don't think you'll get it published if it's truthful because i'll be open
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:57.960]  with you and tell you the truth uh and they did cut a few thousand words out of it and it gets
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:01.720]  stuck in the back of the magazine usually his stuff's up in the front of the magazine he's one
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:07.320]  of the top uh profile writers i'd say in the top three in the country he did a fair piece on ron paul
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:13.320]  calling him founding father he did the big piece at the end of the life with charlton heston he's
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:18.360]  done hundreds of profiles in fact when i first looked him up i said i know who that guy is years
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:23.000]  ago we tried to get him on to the publisher for his book my father the spy that came out
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.480]  five six years ago and i guess they got busy he couldn't come on well now he's here about that so
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:33.960]  so so so we're we're we're not going to get into alex jones too much here today on the hour
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.720]  that we have him and i'm gonna try to shut up because i'm like a wind up toy you'd turn me
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:44.280]  loose i just like the energizer bunny go around banging symbols together uh but uh we went up to
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:51.000]  tube hot spring originally for two days and then my kids uh got sick one of them got sick
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.680]  while we were up there so my wife's sick and we just stay a few more days now if they're better
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:58.840]  i said sure and forgot because i'm not usually flaky that he was coming into austin's he was
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:03.080]  nice enough to fly first he i guess flew in from new york to austin then up to hot springs
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:08.200]  and it's uh kind of rotting beauty up there and we hung out for a few days and then talked a lot
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:14.680]  on the phone so he did a pretty good piece it's it's interesting uh in esquire the current issue
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:21.080]  the september issue that's on newsstands it came out last week and just today uh the piece went up
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:28.360]  online uh on the esquire website that we have linked in a story on info wars dot com esquire
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:34.440]  publishes shockingly fair profile of alex jones and they ask is it a turning point for mainstream
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:40.280]  media you know i'm seeing actually more and more with reporters and journalists that that that
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:45.000]  they're doing more and more hardcore journalism not not just more accurate profiles you know
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.920]  there's kind of a parting of the ways you're either getting pure hack msnbc alex jones is
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.080]  behind the boston bombing and he's a racist or you're getting people that actually want to have
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:00.040]  integrity doing fairer pieces i mean i'm certainly don't come off as perfect as i'm not i'm probably
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:06.760]  one of my biggest detractors and then you've got uh the establishment panicking saying well now we're
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:10.680]  going to engage in domestic propaganda we're going to turn the cia loose and the department
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:14.520]  defense and propaganda well that's been going on for a long time but now the gloves are off
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:20.600]  and so you're really going to see a lot happen the next few years ladies and gentlemen
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:26.760]  as there's a struggle not just out in the private sector but in corporations i don't consider them
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.400]  to be the private sector they're bigger than government and government itself about do you
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.800]  love your kids do you love your grandkids but i got him on and i'm doing a characteristic alex
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:41.800]  jones rant here john richardson uh has a long interesting bio but i won't go over at all
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:46.920]  but he writes for new york magazine premiere magazine s square magazine la times uh los
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:53.160]  angeles daily news albuquerque tribune you name it and he attended uh the southern california
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:58.040]  from 77 the columbia university and uh he has written a bunch of bestselling books
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:03.720]  and my father the spy and investigative memoir um i read it i said five years ago time flies
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:10.280]  was that in 2006 i read i think it came out in 2005 and uh he joins us now well john i bet you're
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:15.720]  in trouble with all your all your buddies now for not for not making stuff up about me yeah the
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:20.760]  liberal media is gonna take away my card i won't be able to walk down the street
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:27.080]  uh well i've been ranting enough let's talk about the piece and uh the s square article
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.440]  tell us about that process and what you thought you'd discover versus what you discovered and
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.560]  how you're the first person to do a fair piece on me well i don't i don't know if i'm the first
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:43.480]  person but i i like that uh i like that uh that characterization of uh i knew as well was it
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:51.560]  surprisingly fair i i can live with that but you know alex i i uh i i think you're not you're not
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:58.200]  a mean spirited person you don't have hatred in your heart for minorities or you know gays or
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:04.920]  whatever you're you know you've got your point of view uh which is i think pretty extreme but
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:10.040]  but it's sincere and like i said it's not mean spirited i didn't see a whole lot to hate there
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:16.920]  uh you know i mean i we talked a lot about your ideas and how i think they discourage people from
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:21.720]  being involved it's so blanketly anti-government that they discourage people from taking action
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:27.800]  and trying to improve things like like uh too big to fail which i would like to see put through i
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:33.960]  think we're on the same page with that um but you know but but like i said i i didn't see i
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.520]  didn't see a lot of hatred there there's people i've done a lot of tea party stuff and there's
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:43.800]  people who i feel are haters and and they sort of make my skin crawl not all of them certainly not
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:51.160]  even most of them but um and that's the sort of thing where i would probably be less uh you know
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:57.400]  surprisingly fair but with you you know i didn't feel like getting into a fight you know i'd like
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:01.960]  to get you on when you do profiles or just on all the incredible people that you've interviewed
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:08.280]  uh out of the hundreds of profiles you've done it's fair to say hundreds right john yeah probably 50 60
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.400]  well you've done but you do other articles too i mean how many stories you think you've written
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:19.400]  in your career oh god thousands yeah thousands paper stuff yeah uh who has been your favorite
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:25.400]  profile in hindsight well you know what what's evergreen what gets better over time you know
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.680]  it's it's hard to separate out the people who are really interesting from the story and how well it
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:37.080]  turns out like i one of my favorite stories was about angela and lina joe lee the actress uh
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:43.080]  because she was real generous she came over to my house and sort of you know freaked out for me and
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:48.280]  had a little nervous breakdown and and it led to a great story and i had a feeling for her because
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:53.640]  she was in a troubled part of her life so you know that it's not that she's necessarily the most
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:58.920]  fascinating person in the world but she's really she you know it led to a really good story i was
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:04.360]  pleased with that but you know obviously it's really exciting meeting some of the some of the
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:10.920]  great people of our culture i spent seven days with jim cameron when he was making titanic that
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:18.120]  was pretty epic uh and i spent time a lot of time with a human rights researcher who was in
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:25.400]  investigating torture uh back in the early days of the iraq war he was you know not a jim cameron
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:30.840]  type but he was an american citizen out there struggling to do the best job he couldn't keep
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:35.720]  the country from doing horrible things so you know gosh it's a privilege to be able to hang out with
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:42.360]  people like that chuck estin tells me i shouldn't complain so much now it's awesome chuck estin uh
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.760]  he spent a lot of time with him right before he went off the radar and then died tell us about
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:52.440]  that well you know i traveled around the country with him for about a week uh going to gun shows
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:42:00.200]  and stuff he was doing his nr a support thing and it was funny because um i mean politically
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:06.920]  he and i had nothing in common in a way but um he'd been an actor obviously for many years and
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:12.280]  i'd covered hollywood for many years so we had that point of contact and i just thought he was a
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:17.720]  lovely guy he you know he was really nice to me we had some great dinners where he talked about
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:23.720]  show biz and the great actors he'd worked with and movies he'd been in and you know he was an old
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:32.280]  ham he loved talking about that stuff uh but also with other people on the on the on the signature
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:38.680]  autograph lines and dealing with these students who who greeted him at college and all that he
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:46.360]  was an incredibly gracious man a really kind fellow plus it struck me that he was you know he
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:51.080]  you know he was doing all this on his own dime i don't think the nr a was paying for it he was
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:57.080]  pretty well often and so he was traveling around the country he was an old guy with a cane uh and
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:02.840]  he was doing it um you know to advance the the things that he believed in the america that he
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.560]  believed in exactly he was on a mission because i only had him on my show twice and whoever can
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:12.520]  find the other interview i'd i'd pay him it's somewhere out there we can't find it but but
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:17.480]  then he said if you ever need to talk about strategy and you know anything give me a call
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:22.280]  and i go well when well just if i'm here i'll answer in my office i guess he had another
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:27.000]  office at his house and for months i never called it and i called it a few times and nobody answered
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.040]  didn't have an answering machine and one day hello and i talked to him like 20 minutes and he encouraged
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.440]  me and stuff i never called him back again and every and then suddenly his wife says he's retiring
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:40.440]  and he shouldn't be flying around doing this on his own dime and he kind of i think the doctors
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:46.360]  got him and drugged him and he kind of disappeared but the point is is that i mean that's an icon
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:51.160]  and he was so he was such a real human that really touched me and i'm envious of you getting to spend
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:56.200]  a week with him well you know i mean i think maybe this is one of the reasons i didn't feel the need
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:03.000]  to trash you it's because like i didn't agree with him about the guns and you know some of it but not
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:08.600]  most of it but i felt like he was doing what americans are supposed to do we just go out there
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:14.600]  and raise his voice and argue for what he believes in and then and then we vote and work it out i mean
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:20.120]  that's so i didn't you know politically i didn't have a problem with him on the contrary i respected
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:25.000]  his commitment you know he was a good guy i was sad when he died and i was i was angry when i saw
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.800]  the michael moore thing i mean it's fine because like michael moore i might agree with a lot more
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:37.640]  but i just thought he treated that poor old guy who was old and not you know all there
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:43.560]  completely uh but see john you're a real liberal you're a real liberal that i like not the fake
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:49.800]  liberals that are more like big city organized crime bosses manipulating the the the real liberals
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:56.360]  out there just like neocons manipulate well-meaning conservatives well i'm the ineffective kind of
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:02.200]  liberal who who you know doesn't get probably get things done that the hard guys who like you know
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:08.680]  know how to fight politics are probably the ones that you and i don't like well again john
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:14.760]  uh richardson who is the best-selling author of my father the spy is with us at the current issue
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:20.440]  of uh esquire has got a pretty fair uh interesting perspective uh on yours truly but that's not why
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:27.480]  he's here today i want to shift gears now uh into your father the spy because i don't know one tenth
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.840]  of about vietnam that you know because i know you've really researched it but obviously i've
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:36.680]  done some research gulping tonkin that got us into it things like that the new cia stuff on the 53 coup
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:43.240]  now confirming you know uh what kermit roosevelt wrote in his book about that in iran tell us about
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:48.280]  your dad growing up with him and then uh i mean because he was probably there in one of the most
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:54.760]  key periods as the head cia guy what is southeast asia i guess yeah no he was he was definitely
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:46:01.240]  the the key guy and a lot of that stuff uh yeah you know i mean this is probably one of the reasons
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:06.200]  why i have this kind of ambivalent approach to stuff that's not too partisan although i have
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:11.560]  my beliefs because you know i grew up in the 60s and i had long hair and all that stuff and yet
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:18.680]  my dad was this hardcore cia guy and as i got to know him better um i realized not only had he'd
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.800]  been pretty consequential but i spent an awful lot of time wrestling emotionally with how i was
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:30.680]  supposed to feel about my old man um you know he he was one of these guys he he grew up in california
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:36.120]  same town as rich richard nexon so it was on the same team as richard nexon a couple of year or two
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:43.400]  behind him and um it was quaker town and he was an idealistic innocent kid like they could be back
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:50.440]  in the 30s um and the world the war came along he was trying he was teaching in english and trying
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:59.400]  to be a um anthropology student um and um the war came along and he got swept up and put in a signal
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:07.400]  core and um eventually they found out that he learned languages and stuck him in the c i in
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:12.680]  in the counterintelligence core in the military which was kind of like the os s um and what they
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:19.800]  did was in italy you know catch spies coming across the lines um and i think during that whole
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:27.640]  time like with so many of those world war two guys his worldview became really fixed in many ways
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:33.640]  and it was a he was a he was a a guard he was protecting the country he was protecting the
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:39.000]  lines protecting the battlefield protecting his fellow soldiers and after the war they asked him
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.640]  to join the cia and he just went straight into that and you know you're you know a lot about history
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:50.520]  so you know how the soviets clamped down on eastern europe and threw up the berlin wall and all that
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:57.000]  stuff and it was a time when my father's generation of intelligence officers saw totalitarianism of
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:03.400]  nazi germany and totalitarianism communism identically so they so they were so they were very much
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:09.480]  my dad was very much a man with a mission that he considered noble um and he was totally consumed
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:14.920]  by it and i admired that i mean later as i got older and i started looking at it politically
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:19.960]  and what i thought about the vietnam war and some of the things that this his agency had
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:27.160]  done in el salvador and in iran as you mentioned i i i had more complicated feelings but i admired
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:35.640]  the passion and the conviction uh and and uh so that led to sort of a lifelong wrestling with
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:41.960]  politics and personalities and all of that but yeah in the in vietnam he was the head of the cia in
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:52.280]  vietnam he was the guy who reluctantly participated in the overthrow and of no din jam he was gone by
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:59.400]  the time that he was assassinated uh he installed the government of the philippines into the into
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:06.600]  into the presidency there and then subsequently he worked closely with no din jam in korea um
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:15.640]  i mean i mean uh pak chung he in korea uh uh during the time of chung pak chung he's famous
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:22.200]  dictatorship so it was fun it was exciting well i read the book it was probably six seven years
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:26.520]  ago but i remember it was a page turner we're gonna go to break soon and come back and get more into
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:32.760]  the book but tell folks just kind of the boil down to the book what it follows well it's about his
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:37.480]  you know it's about his life and how you know the stuff that i just said about sort of how he
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:43.560]  got into it but obviously it centers on vietnam because that was the big deal he he was um at a
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:52.680]  time when liberals like um the in the new york times and uh liberal journalists were like
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:58.600]  assailing the government of vietnam south vietnam for being a dictatorship and uh putting high
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:05.080]  school kids in tiger cages and stuff like that my dad's position was that he was the only leader
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:11.160]  who could successfully lead the country that he had legitimacy that nobody else had and that we
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:17.960]  should stop micromanaging his country and let him run his war americans like to micromanage foreign
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:27.160]  countries so um the ambassador henry cavitt lodge basically blew off my dad and blew off the president
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:35.000]  of the united states and had his overthrow regardless uh i've read all the memos say well
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.600]  stay there let's get into this because it gives you a bird's eye view and others even fights
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:42.440]  internally going on and then project that onto what's happening in the middle east right now

[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:29.800]  here okay let's go back to john richerson who we just reconnected with on skype the writer for
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:36.600]  esquire magazine whose father was a cia section chief there in vietnam during some very very famous
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:41.000]  times you're getting up to the point of the president and your father are saying don't kill
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:47.720]  him and and and the south vietnamese leader but then it still went ahead and happened and then
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:53.000]  i know his story i'm in a lot of story and say that's really when things did get get out of control
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:58.280]  that was probably a bad decision so break down the politics of that to try to bring us up to speed
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:04.040]  today where we wonder how agencies are fighting with each other but this i guess is more of the same
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:12.040]  well yeah i mean it is interesting because uh we they try to give an impression that they're
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:16.120]  in control of stuff and that that everybody knows what they're doing that they're communicating
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:22.280]  but communication is tough and people have egos and henry kevin lodge you know who was
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:31.880]  whose people spoke to god it was his joke uh was an old american going back to the revolution
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:40.280]  top family he had he had distinguished history and he felt like you know he knew a lot better than
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:46.280]  this young upstart named kennedy how they should run vietnam he was it's unbelievable reading the
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:50.200]  stuff he was incredibly arrogant he had like contempt for the vietnamese and for the president of
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:55.080]  vietnam he he made up his mind before he got off the plane that they were losers who just who needed
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:05.240]  to be um overthrown it's safe to say he was on a super power trip well he was very he was a very
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:11.160]  elite east coaster as a as a lead as you can get he was incredibly arrogant and and he felt like
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.880]  any yeah he was old school imperialist in the sense that you know they should do what we tell them to
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:24.200]  do um you know it's very hard for anyone to know now or any counter history is always like a game
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:30.840]  whether vietnam would have been different if we hadn't overthrown jam but we definitely know
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:35.640]  what happened when we did overthrow him which was sort of what my dad predicted was that
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:39.640]  none of the generals who thought that they could run the country really could run the country
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:44.920]  and you have a situation of rolling chaos with one one government after another which
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:49.880]  you know it may be very similar to what it ends up happening in egypt now for example
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:56.440]  but you know what's really fascinating about that case and where i have to like throw it in your
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:02.600]  face alex is that i've read all the internal mill letters that have been made public of the white
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:07.000]  house's deliberations in there during that time and now that there's so much time has gone past
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.680]  they've made all that stuff public and kennedy was like i don't want to make up my mind right now
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:22.200]  tell tell tell um tell ambassador uh tell the ambassador uh lodge to to you know cool his
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:26.840]  jets for a little while i want to talk to other people i want to get some in fact finding send
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:31.080]  some generals send send general lemay out on a fact dining mission you know he kept stalling
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:35.320]  basically he didn't want to pull the trigger and make this decision hold on back in 60 seconds so
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:43.240]  i'm i'm explain this to me when we get back we'll be right back you are listening to gcn

[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:33.240]  john richardson is our guest he wrote the big profile on pumpkin head that's me for the current
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:38.760]  issue September issue of esquire magazine pick it up on newsstands everywhere it's a pretty fair
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:44.760]  piece compared to what i've seen and i kind of my family certainly likes the take uh but uh i
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:48.840]  don't know it's kind of torture to read read about yourself uh but that's not why he's here
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:54.200]  with us this is only a short segment long segment coming up uh john richardson uh with us here today
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:01:01.400]  john i guess from the historians i've been just watching pbs and reading things i mean they've
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:07.160]  cast it like kennedy did not like the escalation well what i've read is at first he was pro war
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:11.960]  war and yeah let's let's get new weapons systems let's go in there but then he started to really
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:15.960]  not like it and was arguing with him i know you've really done more research on this than i have
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:19.640]  and wanted to start you know getting rid of the fellow reserve and we signed executive
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:25.800]  order to issue us notes i know that's a fact he said no to limnitzer this is to stage terror
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:30.600]  attacks you know and blame it on cuba uh he said a bunch of stuff and and so that's why he was
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:34.920]  making him mad i mean what are you getting at here that that kennedy was pro vietnam or anti vietnam
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:40.520]  war no i i think he just was stalling he didn't want to make the decision he or he you know he
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:48.920]  wanted to gather as much information as possible and and stalling i mean it was sometimes you know
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:54.840]  you you're not really sure what to do and you want to wait for more things to develop um
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:04.040]  you know i've i've had so lots of arguments and even argued with oliver stone about this period
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:10.760]  back when he was making jfk uh i mean people project a lot of fantasies on to onto president
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:16.920]  kennedy uh i think uh and in in these documents when you go through history you see that they
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:24.360]  the the original documents not the books that sort of make it all makes sense but you you see
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:29.240]  that there's a lot of things said a lot of things written you can take almost anything and any
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:36.120]  direction you want uh my read of the stuff is that kennedy was pretty militant he you know he
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:42.360]  wasn't like a peacemake he wanted to he wanted like every president like obama like bush wants to
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:49.720]  have control over the world and wants to advance american power um so i don't i don't really see
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:53.880]  him you know he might have pulled out of vietnam because he thought it was a strategic error
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:59.080]  but was he less of an imperialist than other americans of that time i don't think so it doesn't
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:02.520]  it doesn't read that well i want to be clear i mean there's a lot of evidence that somebody in
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:08.200]  kennedy's entourage had maryland and roe killed uh also they declassified what six years ago
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:14.600]  that bobby wanted to blow up the u.s embassy in honduras to basically invade down there
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:19.880]  so so i know they weren't angels so then the question comes in why did the establishment
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:24.280]  or maybe you don't agree with this have them killed well of course i don't agree that the
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:30.440]  establishment had them killed you know uh let me just to finish my point about jim is like
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:38.760]  the way i read that really is that lodge was in control because of communications in those days
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:44.920]  and because of protocol uh kennedy didn't want to make a decision uh lodge effectively cut
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:51.160]  my father out of the argument by exposing him as a cia agent through david halberstam and the
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:59.880]  new york times and having him withdrawn uh and a few weeks later uh the this this event which
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:05.320]  guys like you you know would put all sorts of interpretations as to what the conspiracy was
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:12.760]  it to me it seems like it happened kind of by accident um and i'll tell you something my dad
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:20.280]  used to drill into me when i was a kid i in the sixties i would get into like various i guess you
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:26.280]  call conspiracy theories now uh hold that thought hold that thought long segment coming up we have
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:30.600]  that short segment around the start of the hour stay there when we come back with john richardson

[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:27.080]  my father the spy and investigative the memoir we're gonna be talking with john
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:31.720]  richardson who wrote the book about his father the ci section chief during one of the most i think
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:36.840]  probably the pivotal time and what really kind of launched the vietnam war not officially but
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:42.360]  historically i think officially when it really started going officially would be gulf of tonkin
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:48.120]  1964 will be talking to him in just just a moment the good news about the atlanta shooting no one
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:53.960]  hurt a gun went off or something in the office uh who knows probably some type of gang related
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:59.160]  thing it usually is when it's not a giant mass shooting some crime related deal so that's certainly
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:04.920]  good news but it's they're using it as a big grandstanding event to uh to militarize everything
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:12.920]  but uh very very uh good news that no one has been hurt right now on that new school shooting
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:19.640]  a situation i'll tell you who is being hurt that's the egyptian people which it i'm not on any side
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:24.280]  of this but i've tried to study it we're going to get john richardsons take on that uh here in a
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:28.840]  moment again one of the top profiler something the country but in the world he's interviewed you
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:34.360]  name it he's interviewed him and he decided to do a profile on little alex jones so i'm flattered
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:39.880]  and certainly getting a lot of positive press from the libertarians like reason magazine and others
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:46.280]  it's getting negative press from the neocon warmongers and uh they're kissing cousin the uh
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:52.280]  the authoritarian left uh who normally just makes stuff up constantly and his skype's been
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:56.840]  in and out so we just lost him on skype skype's wonderful for audio quality and video for our
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:01.480]  tv viewers but it obviously is based on the internet not a satellite uplink so we it's it's
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:06.200]  in and out we're going to get him back up in a moment to to you know really boil it down you
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:11.640]  know the point he was getting to with his father ordered to assassinate basically the president
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:17.960]  of south vietnam who he liked and who he thought was overall you know a better than the communist
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:25.800]  uh and and do it following orders and you know then i guess then then having the people in the
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:32.760]  government then out him on top of it just shows that there's no at least from my perspective on
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:36.680]  the stuff that goes on in these intelligence agencies it's very very dishonorable the things
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:40.280]  they do to the people it's kind of like bush ordering people to torture and then when it
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:45.640]  comes out they're torturing and putting them in jail and then he writes a book bragging he ordered
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:49.400]  torture well then why didn't you give these people a pardon that you had torture i mean it just
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:55.320]  it just shows folks don't do things the government tells you to do that are unconstitutional and
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:00.280]  immoral because you get a war corrupts people and oh the other side's doing this so we've got to do
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:05.560]  this and then that's how the process that invariably leads to this have we gotten him back
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:13.160]  okay we got him back via audio skype not video john you were it was a cliffhanger there you were
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:17.400]  coming up to those set breaks on the satellite or i would have skipped it uh where you were
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:20.920]  talking about what your father would say about the way the world really worked but before we do
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:29.320]  that recap for listeners what happened uh back in uh 1963 uh with the assassination of the south
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:33.400]  vietnamese president what your dad really thought of him kind of because kind of condense all that
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:37.720]  down because that's what the book gets into but i mean it's it's historical it's important and then
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:43.080]  segue into what you're about to say about your dad okay yeah you know um first off he was never
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:49.320]  tasked and to assassinate but we didn't assassinate in those days before drones and stuff like that
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:53.080]  no i mean i know he didn't go pull the trigger but i guess i mean i mean didn't the president end up
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:57.960]  well no no the president did not order an assassination they ordered an overthrow or
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:05.640]  you know lodge ordered an overthrow um uh and he was just killed during the overthrow uh
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:10.920]  oh accidentally fell down well they should have anticipated you know things go wrong and it they
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:16.200]  could have anticipated that such a thing it might happen but supposedly kennedy and other people were
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:21.640]  really devastated by it uh anyway my you know my dad respected gem he spent a lot of time with him
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:26.600]  he he was a very patient man my dad and he was willing to listen to his through the guys three
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:32.920]  hour lectures about vietnamese history and culture um i think lodge was not a patient man was not
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:39.960]  willing to listen to the three hour lectures um you know this stuff gets really complicated i think
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:50.600]  america i mean times have changed but americans still american leaders like right now obama is
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:55.800]  probably probably trying to bring some kind of pressure on general sissy in egypt but what pressure
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:01.640]  can he really bring on the guy for you know we give him some money we have connections with other
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:08.200]  governments that that uh that might hold sway on them but ultimately you get down to these
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:13.800]  countries and these autocratic leaders and they're they're difficult to sway and i think my dad's
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:19.560]  just personality was less was more like let's respect them and let's try to find a way to work
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:27.480]  with them uh rather than let's overthrow them he was also like really conscious that chaos
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:33.000]  because he'd been in italy after world war two that without a strong some kind of government
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:40.120]  some kind of effective government um or strong leader uh you can have anarchism and chaos that
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:46.120]  leads to well sure that's like when the pentagon disbanded the iraqi military right exactly and
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:52.920]  that's another example i mean you know the caution of my dad's generation of guys or some of them
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:59.640]  you know just blithely overthrowing countries and hoping hoping that it won't fall into chaos
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:05.560]  after so many examples to the contrary is pretty shocking um but you know these guys in power
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:12.360]  they they they feel that they have power and can use it it's crazy uh but what my dad said so my
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:18.200]  dad respected jem he thought he was like a really sincere leader you know tough and autocratic and
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:25.400]  brutal but uh it was during a war was my dad's opinion he's trying to keep his country together
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:32.840]  in time of war i i remember him saying that many times um and uh and you know he had a certain
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:38.520]  sort of like that gene kerpatrick notion that some countries are cut out for autocracy and
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:43.000]  some countries are cut out for democracy and it takes a long time to get them from one place
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:51.080]  to another uh especially in asia that was his opinion it might be you know um it might not
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:56.040]  be politically correct but that was his opinion uh and he earned it but you know he always used
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:02.360]  to tell me and this is where you and i part ways dramatically you know he used to say son there are
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:10.840]  no secrets uh i don't even remember what made him say that but but he always used to say that
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:17.400]  and i think and i remember when that when france threw that american spy out he got enraged this
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:25.720]  was in the 80s he was like allies spy on allies uh he just gave me this and i think what he was
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:31.800]  saying i think he this there are no secrets was partly in relation to the kennedy assassination
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:39.000]  it's like it's you can't keep a secret about whether you had an affair you tell your friends
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:45.400]  and pretty soon your wife knows it uh whether you whether uh a group a small group of people killed
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:51.480]  the president pretty hard secret to keep well i think the only secrets you can keep are ones
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:59.400]  that are so horrible that society doesn't want to believe them like the government allowed islamic
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:07.240]  jihadis uh to uh be involved in 9 11 and open the door bare minimum i mean that's what alex you
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:11.720]  got to analyze that statement the government allowed them no criminal elements criminal
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:16.920]  elements in the government and not one of them stepped up and said oh my god these guys are
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:21.960]  killing americans not one of them and we've had shibble admins we've had colonel shaver person
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:27.080]  you can't keep a secret with two people let me expand on that they kept the mad hatton project
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:36.920]  secret for four years not i don't think they kept it a very good secret i mean it was a secret from
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:40.920]  the broad general public but it wasn't a secret from the nonsense i don't want to argue with it
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:44.760]  because i mean i get your point i actually have always said listeners have heard this probably
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:50.840]  a hundred times they don't keep any of this stuff secret but the mainstream media never picks it up
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:56.840]  and investigates it to find out what really went on and what really happened so i mean a lot of this
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:01.400]  stuff does i mean they said on 9 11 we're going to blow up building 7 get back we're going to blow
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:06.920]  it up seeing in an ounce they you know it fell in its own footprint before it even fallen uh bbc
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:11.000]  did the same thing i mean they blew that building up i interviewed barry jennings the deputy have
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.600]  emergency management he said no they ordered it blown up two weeks later he's dead i mean and
[02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:21.720]  people cannot spin i have seen in john saying get back they're going to blow it up with the cops
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:28.040]  saying get back it's coming down and then it boom comes down that's the 47 story building so it did
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:34.120]  come out it just like gulf of tonkin came out just like the cia coup of 53 came out it was a
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:41.000]  conspiracy theory until they finally officially admitted it now i don't think every speculation
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  out there turns out to be true i know most of it isn't but i mean my whole issue is i actually agree
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:50.280]  with what your dad said most of these things do end up coming out it's just that nothing is then
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:56.440]  done about it i mean like you said it's known big banks are above the law and have engineered things
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:01.560]  to fail so they can get bailed out on the other side after the ponzi scheme collapses they should
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:07.000]  go to jail but they're not because it's too big to fail i mean do you see what i'm saying yeah i see
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  what you're saying and of course there's truth to what you're saying for instance gulf of tonkin
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:18.280]  is a good example a lot of people dismissed that for a long time uh the overthrow must i can never
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:24.360]  pronounce his name right mustedek most of that yeah most of that can in iran and 53 is another
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:28.360]  example you know people were saying that happened and other people were dismissing it and and we
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:34.760]  know that it's true and so it's to some extent you know true true true things that happen are not
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:41.880]  really well processed but part of it is because of guys like you alex who like uh you know sort of
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:50.280]  discredit uh this stuff by casting your net too wide i think for example in 9 11 you know when when
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:55.400]  buildings are falling down and plans are flying into buildings and people are running screaming
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:19:02.280]  through the streets with shit falling on their heads all kinds of stuff gets said and tweeted on
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:09.640]  their on and broadcast on police radios uh it's the same thing with vietnam it's you can you can
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:16.760]  pick something kennedy said and say well he was going to pull out of vietnam but you just sort of
[02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:22.360]  have to say we don't really know we don't really know that i mean i'm i'm pretty skeptic if it's
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:28.040]  not running through my tape recorder i just have to say you know it sounds right it sounds plausible
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:33.880]  but who knows i'm not you i think it's dangerous the way you and your listeners get vested in
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:39.720]  believing no no no i agree with you i agree with you let's believe it i mean i agree with you a
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:43.080]  certain sentence let's come back and talk about that because i see people make up outlandish
[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:49.640]  things about me and as soon as it's been passed around it becomes true and i know it's not true
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:55.160]  so i understand there's a lot of magical thinking going on out there where people use conspiracy
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:59.560]  theory as a way to simplify the world okay i understand that we'll be right back but i want to
[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:06.520]  quantify what i do there's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn
[02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:12.200]  your lives upside down in the coming few months unbelievably the media are keeping quiet about
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:18.200]  this i'm sure they know it but they probably know that revealing it on tv will generate mass hysteria
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:23.960]  and chaos but i believe you should be informed about it because when the sinister agenda is
[02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:29.800]  finally accomplished and everything unravels only those who know this secret info will survive and

[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:14.280]  i know this probably closes the chapter in my life because i know he's a busy guy and i'm busy
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:19.880]  with john ritchardson but he's a man of his word and i think a fair piece and he's a very
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:25.720]  interesting journalist i've read many of his profiles over the years i did read um my father
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:29.880]  the spy about a year after it came out because they sent us one here the publisher and i picked it
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:34.760]  up and read it uh one weekend and people should get that it's available at amazon.com bookstores
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:39.960]  everywhere and you can see photos and it inside of it kind of gives you a snapshot but i do hope
[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:43.560]  john that whenever you've got a big profile coming out and it's interesting and it kind of fits with
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:46.840]  what we're doing you know by that we don't do entertainment but some of the more political
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:51.080]  stuff i'd love to have you back on the show because you're an interesting interesting guy
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:55.640]  and i don't want to end the interview here arguing with you about a bunch of stuff it's just this
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:03.480]  i personally of course we just lost him on skype again it's unbelievable when it rains it pours
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:11.480]  i have have experienced so much corruption and tyranny myself like you have in the magazine
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:15.240]  you know where i get a death threat and they tell me what i was talking about on the phone five
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:20.600]  minutes before and i have experienced special forces trying to set fires and blame it on me
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:25.240]  just because i tried to cover something they were doing in florida i've experienced police lying
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:31.160]  about me i've experienced government drug dealing i have experienced and so maybe i'm prejudiced
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:36.760]  because of that but i think if you look at how many lies we've been told and what the system
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:44.120]  john i i'm i'm i'm getting at this so many lies have been exposed and so much corruption has happened
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:49.160]  i think government and corporations are getting more corrupt i think we are in a more decadent
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:55.240]  cycle i don't romanticize leaders of the past i think the power structure because the general
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:00.440]  public's gotten decadent gets away with a lot more than they used to and i think i think overall
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:08.600]  it's healthy not to trust the system what do you say to that um i up to a point i agree with you
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:15.800]  uh i think it's healthy to question the system you know obviously i'm a journalist to i think
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:21.800]  and i think you know power corrupts and all that uh i do think i do agree with you like with
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:27.400]  globalization and and businesses being so big and so disconnected from their communities now
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:32.360]  i mean there was a time when you know montgomery ward was based in some american city and actually
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:36.760]  cared about the people who live there uh you know maybe that's not a good example but you know what
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:43.000]  i mean uh so i i do think there's sort of a disconnect and a and a loss of responsibility
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.880]  amongst our ruling classes and i but i think if you if you're too skeptical and you just say
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:54.760]  there's no good people and and it's all a scam and it's all corrupt then really all you're doing is
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:27:02.040]  giving them um giving the corrupt ones uh encouragement you i think you got to hold
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:06.440]  on to your elizabeth warrens and people who are out there actually fighting for the people well i
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:10.680]  agree with you that that from my perspective i think when everybody hears they're a bunch of
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:15.560]  evil people let's fight them i i'm thinking from my perspective historically that we can win
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:20.520]  but i've learned it actually just scares a bunch of people and actually demoralizes
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:26.520]  some folks so i get what you're saying on that level uh i just don't know what you do then
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:38.840]  to get people out of their coma john well i don't know man you know it's uh i guess it really depends
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:46.840]  on how people are affected by things i mean if it's that's why i i sort of like local actions you
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:53.080]  know to a lot of degree if you if you're affected in your community by some event you're gonna
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:58.440]  take it real personally and you're gonna be maybe a little more responsible in your approach to it
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:03.960]  i don't know i don't know i think people wake up out of their comas when they're personally
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:10.280]  disturbed it's hard to be abstractly into whatever problems are in new york if you live in california
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:15.160]  and vice versa now i agree with you but looking at the problem right now in egypt it's the same
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:20.600]  thing like you said your dad was facing he was backing the military dictatorship basically
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:24.680]  because statistically he could see it was a lot less chaos from being in world war two
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:29.800]  in collapsing italy like my grandfather was as well yeah you know my grandfather your dad
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:34.520]  he could see that now obama and the nia and the neocons as well to a certain extent
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:39.720]  have been backing the jihadis but but they're running around killing christians in minority
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:45.080]  groups and then i don't back the military junta but i can look at them statistically and see
[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:51.000]  that that things were more stable and better when they were in power so it's it's it's immoral
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.920]  almost to make a decision but then you're forced it well it's really hard to make a decision i mean
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:02.120]  you know they had and i you know i don't think obama backs jihadis if you're talking about
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:07.400]  who you know they had an election there and they elected the muslim brotherhood and and
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:14.520]  he worked with that government yes he did uh but i mean i think what one of the things that i
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:19.720]  see in your show and in life in general in media in general like is that we want answers and we
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:25.320]  want things to make sense and they don't necessarily make sense i mean you know the muslim brotherhood
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:31.560]  got in there they made some bad calls people started protesting the army did made a decision
[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:35.640]  bottom line it's a mess we're out of time john will you come back sometime when you've done a new

[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:38.360]  constitution due process and rule of law then we're gonna have some problems the alex jones show

[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:09.000]  okay now about a week or two ago we had an article it's about two weeks ago and i've gotten scores
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:15.160]  of phone calls comments emails people wanting to know uh other food companies calling us confirming
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:20.040]  it's going on none of them wanting to go on air we could put our story up on screen for tv viewers
[02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:25.080]  fema demanding 24-hour delivery of emergency food reserves and folks have put out the emails
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:31.480]  where they're gearing up and it's on a massive scale it's not just the tsa getting 3.6 million
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:37.240]  bullets yesterday enough for 9 000 plus bullets to be fired a day by their agents it's it's billions
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:46.760]  what's behind all of this so i reached out about a week ago uh to our source on this
[02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:53.240]  and i actually had some notes that he was able to uh to send me on that subject guys perhaps you
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:56.840]  can find those because i had them here this morning and i wanted to i wanted to be able to go over
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:01.160]  those if you guys will come show me uh where that's at because because he was able to give me kind of
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:09.240]  a a email briefing too on what was going on with it and he's the president of e-foodsdirect.com
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:16.040]  he's our sponsor but he's here today to talk about what's going on with not just the the canneries
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:20.680]  around the country and the Mormon canneries that he knows but other food companies and their company
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:24.840]  with homeland security trying to buy all the food they can are they trying to corner the market
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:29.640]  like they've done with bullets and guns or or do they actually think something's coming
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.480]  steve shank thanks for coming on i know i had to twist your arm tell us what's happening today
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:38.440]  well thanks alex it's good to be here it's always good to chat with you again because you
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:43.640]  should put some fire in everybody's belly it's it's just wonderful you know it's it's kind of
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:49.240]  fascinating uh we had the the big bruja and it continues to go on with regard to the bullets
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:58.920]  but uh the food situation is is really kind of interesting um one of the things that that uh
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:06.440]  we learned with our oklahoma experience where where your team and gcn radio and e-foods direct
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:13.880]  kind of band together when the oklahoma disaster hit and uh we were able to send out 50 000 meals
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:20.120]  in six days uh and then we started doing some research afterwards and the magnitude of the
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:28.200]  problem that we have when we have a disaster like this and have to cover uh hundreds and thousands
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:35.560]  of of and in in the case of katrina and and sandy we had to cover millions of meals not
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:40.280]  just for the people that were in trouble but also for the relief workers that come in uh food is
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:46.040]  becoming an interesting issue but let's go back to the let's go back to the bullets this is kind
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:53.240]  of interesting okay how uh how much use is your gun if you don't have any bullets makes a great
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:39:00.840]  paperweight doesn't it unless you've got a bayonet and then it's only a spear there you go it uh
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:07.240]  it's kind of an interesting deal if you look at how people think as soon as that that buy started
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:13.560]  uh the the comment came well my goodness what's going on what do they know that we don't know
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:20.920]  and as soon as the uh the issue of of stockpiling of food by fema and the uh relief organizations
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:27.880]  came out uh everybody says well what do they know that we don't know um they might know some other
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:32.680]  stuff but what we know alex is plenty enough to get us fired up it's what you and i've been talking
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:38.200]  to these people uh forever about we're in the worldwide famine the chinese are buying up every
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:43.000]  bit of food they can get on the on the markets and they're including all of our food that they can
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:48.120]  get that's the real reason these third world countries are melting down is that uh they're
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:54.680]  starving absolutely and you see we've got an interesting situation let people are worried
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:40:02.200]  about what the government does with regard to buying up food why uh here's the point
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:08.600]  are you worried about the books that the government is buying if you have your own
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:16.840]  ammunition for your own gun the only concerned people that have guns uh that should that should
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:22.920]  be really worried at this point with regard to what's going on is if they have their potential
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:31.800]  ammunition for their guns stored in a warehouse someplace that can be um that can be eliminated
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:37.320]  in other words uh they're not going to go around um let me give you a perfect example when they pass
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:44.840]  the uh the second patriot act the um uh the part of that came out and said that if there's no if
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:49.400]  there's an emergency you're gonna have to be able to provide for yourself for at least 30 days
[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:53.000]  otherwise you need to go to a gathering center and everybody said oh my gosh we're gonna have to go
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  to a gathering center no if you have your own food you won't need to go to the gathering center to
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:04.760]  be to be fed this is so elementary that Stalin and every other authoritarian in ukraine and other
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:09.960]  areas use cutting the food off as the control mechanism so that's why you've been harping on
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:15.400]  this that patriots need to have storable food but then fema demonizes if you have more than a
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:20.120]  week of it while they're hoarding food and that's why i wanted to get shown about this just just
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:25.960]  please specifically what do you know about fema going out because it's in the news and and
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:31.880]  contacting everybody and starting to hoard food what's going on with that well the same stuff
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:38.360]  is going on that that you have been predicting that i've been talking about for all these years
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:44.600]  things are tightening down there needs to be a handle on well kissinger made the statement
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:51.160]  you control nations with oil you can control people with food and he did that back in the 70s
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:56.920]  and that has been what's going on but let's let's take it out of that you remember how we handled
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:03.720]  the the the patriot thing where you had to have a month's supply of food otherwise you know how
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:09.720]  we said that roger we put a spin on that we put a spin on it that says we the people are in control
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:19.240]  and here's how you look at it you say okay um it's the moral responsibility and the patriotic duty
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:25.720]  of every american to take care of themselves so they can leave the relief organizations to take
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:33.880]  care of those who can't and that law still applies you look at bullets they could have all the bullets
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:39.720]  they want to you got a gun if you got a gun no bullets you got no gun if you've got your own
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:44.680]  bullets you don't have to worry about how many they got and you don't need to wonder what the
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:50.200]  secret plan or the non-secret plan let's go back to food now and let's use the same example your
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:59.640]  gun needs bullets otherwise it's useless you need food otherwise you're useless now absolutely absolutely
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:05.160]  everybody does need food just like you need water filter and guns and bullets and friends and family
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:10.360]  and know how to skin a buck and uh run a trot line i mean we need to just go back to being natural
[02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:15.480]  humans that are self-sufficient the opposite of everything the obama noids and the globalists
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:21.160]  want us to do they want a permanent peasant class they want us collectivized the opposite is come
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:26.760]  out of egypt and even if you live in egypt you're in egypt but not of it you're in the world not of
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:31.640]  it you've got this horrible food you're ready you're ready to be able to take care of your family
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:35.880]  people make fun of me having horrible food you know yuppies and stuff and i go look it's there it's
[02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:42.360]  good for 20 years if i ever need it i've got it i mean even ant store food squirrels store food are
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:49.400]  they extremist the answer is they're not just extremist they're racist but here's here's the way
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:55.160]  here's the way that you can be fearless alex you could be absolutely fearless with this
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:44:04.680]  if you have your own food you never have to stand in a bread line and the very simple fact is why
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:10.040]  did they require people to go to a gathering center if they didn't have enough food in the in the
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:17.160]  patriot act situation very simply they can't make house calls well this works very well the government
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:22.600]  has no food the government has no money now all of your listeners will say yeah but they can print
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:28.680]  it they can't it can't do any good to print the money if they've got no food to buy but if the
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:34.120]  government has no food they've committed themselves to over half the population to provide food for
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:40.040]  them we now have a hundred in fact guys show that cns cns headline or ap headline from a month ago
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:48.520]  101 million americans are now on food assistance 49 million to 47 it fluctuates are on daily food
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:55.080]  stamps i mean this is incredible oh it's absolutely insane but here's the thing the government has
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:45:03.000]  made the commitment to provide food for all these people right the government has no food so when
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:07.400]  they have to fill those commitments where are they going to where they're going to get the food
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:13.560]  they have to go someplace where there's food now everybody's hunkered down with their with their
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:17.880]  little ammunition and their guns and they're and they're saying well they're going to come and get
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:24.840]  my food no they're not they can't make house calls to collect your food anymore than they can make
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:30.360]  house calls to feed you in the case of the the patriot act situation all they'll do is go bang
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:35.880]  on a few hundred doors put it on the news showing old ladies being drugged out to make you get scared
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:41.320]  and go to the super dome to be gang raped and to watch troops with piles of water they're not even
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:46.600]  allowed to give you the answer is don't live in the middle of a city and there's not jack squat they
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:52.120]  can do to you max you'll have to deal give it does degenerate which it could i hope it doesn't
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:56.680]  but there's a good chance we need to be prepared you'll have to deal with roving looters and that's
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:46:03.080]  why you got friends and neighbors and guns somebody you and somebody crosses your fence well it's
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:10.680]  good night go ahead well let's let's go back to where where the food is going to come to come
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:16.680]  from to to take care of the government's commitment it's going to come not from you as individuals
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:20.280]  they can't make house calls and go collect a little it's going to come from the walmart distribution
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:24.520]  centers they have official deals with so the general public's not going to be able to get the food
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:30.760]  good so what's your conclusion the same thing is if all the bullets are gone your guns no good so
[02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:38.200]  you've got to have what you got to have ammunition you're no good if you got no food and if if in
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:42.920]  fact the food is going to be absorbed in large quantities to feed the people that the government
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:48.360]  has the responsibility to feed it's going to come from the suppliers to the stores where you get
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:55.160]  now let me tell you how they told the cops go to walmart and katrina and loot it there you go okay
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:46:59.720]  but did they tell the cops to go house to house and find out if you got a little month's supply
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:07.400]  no so the very best thing you can do is get your supply in now what what we learned what we learned
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:14.760]  from the oklahoma incident is that the job is too big for them to handle or for anyone to handle
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:22.280]  yeah how many meals did you send to them for free we sent 50 000 meals and we we got news coverage
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:28.280]  on it and it's not just us we didn't do it it's your listeners and the people that that listened
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:36.040]  to gcn radio alex jones and and work with us for their food supplies they all pitched in 50 000 meals
[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:42.760]  in six days that's impressive we got news coverage on it but after the dust settled we discovered
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:50.520]  that there was something like uh what 18 000 of people that were sent in as relief workers
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:55.960]  and they had 33 000 people that were directly affected you put that all together and what we
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:48:04.120]  what we did with our little 50 000 meals we fed them lunch for a day but the beauty of it is this
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:14.120]  anybody can eat a hippopotamus one spoonful at a time if everyone has the ability to take
[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:22.680]  care of themselves just a little bit if everybody takes themselves then no one will be left to need
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:29.560]  taking care of by these agencies that absolutely absolutely and and you know thinking about this
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:35.080]  Steve shank and i'm glad we talked about this today thinking about this people would really
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:39.800]  be crazy with his out of controls the world is right now to not have high quality storeable
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:45.000]  foods i know i didn't get you on to plugiefoodsdirect.com today four slash alex people can find the
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:49.880]  free shipping special you guys are still running but i think it is important for people to understand

[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:05.320]  uh petition drives for the white house going for brookley born could you imagine if she became
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:11.880]  the fed reserve chairman they would go just ape i mean the 40 fees would just know they wouldn't
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:18.200]  know what to do about her yeah tell folks about her for the people that may not know uh she was
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:25.000]  the the the commodity of futures trade uh commissioner and she basically went after all
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:32.440]  these uh these trades these illicit trades with the futures and and derivatives and all this stuff
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:37.400]  absolutely she was willing to blow the whistle uh a few years before all the derivative stuff came
[03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:44.840]  out and she's a hero that's a good idea we could have a petition to have her in there as the head
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:49.480]  of the fed that would be like having the farmer guarding the henhouse though they don't want that
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:58.280]  they want the head fox guarding it that would make the point even bigger oh man that's a great
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:03.640]  idea sir hey what do you think of uh arresting people that protest peacefully against obama
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:08.920]  and the cops acting like they've found al-qaeda well i think that's just wonderful i mean i've

[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:28.760]  of me that's the type of police we have nowadays oh hold on i'm gonna hold you over uh george and

[03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:32.840]  especially in the show me state of missouri
[03:08:32.840 --> 03:08:39.480]  the globalists know they got patriots up there and just like indiana they want to keep them in line
[03:08:41.960 --> 03:08:47.720]  that's why then we're going back to your calls for folks that are holding like george and others
[03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:55.320]  that's why they said oh the rodeo clown the bull chased it that was a threat against obama
[03:08:55.320 --> 03:08:59.880]  you're fired banned for life everybody's got to go take federal sensitivity training you're all
[03:08:59.880 --> 03:09:04.600]  guilty because of what somebody else did that wasn't even bad that's pure authoritarianism
[03:09:04.600 --> 03:09:10.840]  well your neighbor does something so you go to jail too or somebody shoots a federal gestapo
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:15.320]  officer like a nazi germany so they kill 30 people randomly in the town that's how
[03:09:15.320 --> 03:09:20.760]  authoritarians work for those that didn't know you have what looks like more than 10 police
[03:09:21.480 --> 03:09:29.480]  have counted seven different state police and five or six regular local police in missouri show up
[03:09:29.480 --> 03:09:34.120]  to a dozen or so people in an overpass calling for obama's impeachment and the cops come over
[03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:39.800]  with savage looks start choking people in california we got footage of them pushing people down and
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:45.480]  they're there to intimidate you that you don't have free speech because the last thing they want is
[03:09:45.480 --> 03:09:50.360]  americans to start hitting the streets by the millions calling for obama to be impeached because
[03:09:50.360 --> 03:09:57.000]  if the american people ever stand up to this kleptocratic class that's it for their new world
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:02.360]  order and i was thinking looking at this video that's up on info wars.com we're gonna have kit
[03:10:02.360 --> 03:10:10.680]  daniels do a story on it obama truth squads police arrest anti-obama protesters that's
[03:10:10.680 --> 03:10:17.160]  what it is police arrest and brutalize peaceful anti-obama protesters in missouri and and the
[03:10:17.160 --> 03:10:23.240]  answer is obviously to really push now and and and and to have the overpasses.org group on
[03:10:23.240 --> 03:10:27.640]  who started this a month ago and now it's popping up everywhere so just do this more and to do this
[03:10:27.640 --> 03:10:33.000]  more in missouri and to have the national tea party groups that aren't total neocons call for how
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:39.480]  about 50 000 show up at that overpass and i know they'll call out tanks and they'll have helicopters
[03:10:39.480 --> 03:10:44.360]  act like you're bad it's all about how we're bad but the government that's run by foreign banks is
[03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:49.000]  good so before i go back to your calls i want to just play you the obama truth squads in missouri
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:55.640]  where they say we'll decide not a jury not a judge if something's liable or slander will come arrest
[03:10:55.640 --> 03:11:03.560]  you and it's how authoritarian's work you talk bad will arrest you and imagine when north korea
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:09.000]  does this it's bad when when they do this in egypt when the when the when when when they arrest
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:15.320]  protesters oh it's terrible but when it's done here and again the cops don't even come up like the
[03:11:15.320 --> 03:11:19.880]  state police have done to me at a protest inside their building in texas and apologize that they've
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:25.880]  been ordered to take me to jail they enjoy it and just i haven't gotten fully in the story yet but i
[03:11:25.880 --> 03:11:30.840]  bet money they're going to charge them with the salt in the cops i mean it's just it's these cops
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:36.920]  walk up like they've just busted a den of child molesters or something because that is the ultimate
[03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:44.760]  crime in america to authoritarian police is an american an american is the enemy because we're
[03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:50.280]  not bowing down to the takeover so let's go to the missouri truth squads five years ago and they're
[03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:55.720]  now doing it you're a rodeo clown you're fired everybody else is guilty by the way texas said
[03:11:55.720 --> 03:12:02.200]  come on down here we will hire you down here the guy's hiding out now this is not my country
[03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:07.000]  and again i know a lot of police are listeners and are upset about this and and these are the
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:12.760]  bad examples but man i've seen some stuff where cops walk over to a woman and push her down for
[03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:19.640]  having a political sign and let me tell you i mean i see red when i see that i mean you guys
[03:12:19.640 --> 03:12:23.960]  they've hired a bunch of spoiled brat bullies that literally think they're the queen of england
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:27.720]  and we're all supposed to kiss your butts and i'm not going to do it anymore let's go ahead and go
[03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:33.640]  to this truth squad clip that shows what they're now doing unbelievable if you want to stand out
[03:12:33.640 --> 03:12:39.800]  there with a sign you know to go to willy's pizza or something it'd be fine and i bet you money if
[03:12:39.800 --> 03:12:43.880]  it was illegal aliens out there they'd probably roll a red carpet out for them but you're an american
[03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:48.280]  citizen and that means you're a dog let's go to this clip where they try to imply that first
[03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:52.600]  amendment is illegal here it is barack obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:57.960]  enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a mislead he's not a candidate now he runs the show
[03:12:57.960 --> 03:13:01.640]  the presidential campaign this was john mills is live at the county election board in maple
[03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:06.440]  but he's been learning more about which members of law enforcement are getting involved in this
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:11.880]  judgment of law enforcement russia good evening prosecutors and sheriffs from across missouri
[03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:17.720]  are joining something called the barack obama truth squad too high profile is an oxymoron
[03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:22.840]  part of the team we met them this afternoon in the central west and they are jennifer joys from
[03:13:22.840 --> 03:13:27.560]  the city bob mccullough the st louis county prosecuting attorney they will be reminding
[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:34.040]  voters that barack obama is a christian who wants to cut taxes for anyone making less than 250
[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:39.880]  thousand dollars he increased them they also say they plan to respond immediately to any ads and
[03:13:39.880 --> 03:13:45.960]  statements that might violate that's why ethics law russian gestapo we want to keep this campaign
[03:13:45.960 --> 03:13:50.120]  focused i mean this is why in kvd we don't want people to get distracted and the missourians don't
[03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:53.880]  want to be distracted by these divisive characters i mean this is how tyranny happens so we're here
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:13:59.960]  to respond some cop up there and shall arrest you shut up tyrant get out of my country attributable
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:04.760]  to the campaign or to one of the soft money operations if they're not going to be kicked out
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:09.240]  of this nation immediately i bet he's involved in this this is the truth but only i don't want to
[03:14:09.240 --> 03:14:14.520]  get around that guy now the obama campaign tells news for that others prosecutors and sheriffs are
[03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:20.200]  also prosecutors including some from the kansas city area commas are rural parts of missouri
[03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:25.880]  we're also told the truth squad is expected to include jefferson county sheriff glenn boyer
[03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:34.200]  liven maplewood john mills news for john thank you so if i lie and say he isn't gonna
[03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:40.600]  raise taxes on poor people i'll be arrested he did it doesn't matter because we got cops
[03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:46.920]  wearing marine corps drill sergeant hats coming up trying to i mean i just can't handle somebody

[03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:08.760]  it turns out they always throw away complaints that they know what is really going to mean
[03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:14.200]  well don't throw them away they use them in the bathroom right absolutely as bad as their
[03:16:14.200 --> 03:16:19.400]  elephant butts are it uses it takes a lot go ahead yeah but when i kept pressing it with the fbi

[03:16:24.920 --> 03:16:29.240]  attorney uh they got started getting a little nervous they sent sent sent their little gestapo

[03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:44.920]  the ground so let's explain it a little bit let me guess they were able to bulldoze the old folks
[03:16:44.920 --> 03:16:52.600]  area no i i found them because of the because of the the the heads of uh hard and a few other
[03:16:52.600 --> 03:16:56.920]  people got involved so they became a little bit too hot for them no that's what my dad always told
[03:16:56.920 --> 03:17:01.800]  me this and it's true when you mess with local boss hogs is when they come after you i mean i've
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:06.680]  had them where the cops would just see me in a car pull me over you're going to jail or i'd show up
[03:17:06.680 --> 03:17:11.080]  in a party pull up take me to jail and then they told my dad we're gonna you know basically kill
[03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:15.240]  your son if you don't leave because i'd shot my mouth off they were dealing drugs they pulled us
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:21.480]  over when i searched the car and i'd go i saw you deliver drugs bob years ago to the to the to the
[03:17:21.480 --> 03:17:28.360]  housewife to you know and they'd be like you come here and then it would just be you're gonna pay

[03:17:31.720 --> 03:17:37.080]  it you little and then stomp off and they're just a bunch of drug dealers man they're mafia

[03:19:58.520 --> 03:20:03.800]  for the republicans to come in later go ahead hey i'm a long time listener of prison planet tv
[03:20:03.800 --> 03:20:09.480]  subscribers are therefore i guess that makes me a fellow racist because i'm guilty by association
[03:20:09.480 --> 03:20:13.320]  i listened to alex jones well you've listened to the show today you've heard a lot of racism
[03:20:13.320 --> 03:20:19.240]  and they'll go yes any criticism of old obama i mean he could never have got away with this folks
[03:20:19.240 --> 03:20:22.680]  if he was white i wish he was white because he never would have got away with it all but the
[03:20:22.680 --> 03:20:28.680]  political correct bandwagon they have go ahead hey but i want to say something alex you know i know
[03:20:28.680 --> 03:20:33.000]  you're a humble man you you really want to be a humble and don't take credit but sir you have to
[03:20:33.560 --> 03:20:39.080]  give yourself a bow please i mean you've been vindicated yourself a thousand times over alex i've
[03:20:39.080 --> 03:20:44.280]  been listening to you since 2008 all this stuff you said that people made you sound like you're
[03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:50.520]  a tinfoil hat wearer it's all come to fruition so no one can discredit you alex don't it's not
[03:20:50.520 --> 03:20:58.200]  even mf mbc you know what you can take a bow sir well i i'll get her to you back to you my friend
[03:20:58.200 --> 03:21:03.640]  but i you know i just i'm just not even thinking about that because and i bless you i appreciate
[03:21:03.640 --> 03:21:09.000]  your call you know i never asked listeners for help because if they defend me in the blogs and
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:14.280]  youtube and the sites it only adds to the distraction at certain levels but at a certain point
[03:21:16.120 --> 03:21:21.720]  people just need to know that that there's all sorts of dirty trick campaigns going on
[03:21:23.800 --> 03:21:28.520]  one of the biggest is that they'll go and send fake emails fake letters with alex shown spoof
[03:21:28.520 --> 03:21:36.760]  accounts to preachers and politicians and media people where i send threatening mean racist stuff
[03:21:36.760 --> 03:21:40.680]  or whatever to folks and of course it's not me and i've had them years ago spoof
[03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:48.760]  my fax machine death-threading people and had the police call me and i go you know they could
[03:21:48.760 --> 03:21:55.000]  spoof a fax machine uh so i mean and they go yeah yeah we figured that uh but i mean it's just you
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:22:02.360]  name and it's going on but it's intensified where i have to deal with it a lot where people i know go
[03:22:02.360 --> 03:22:06.040]  why'd you send me that email and it's got to be the government sometimes they'll have intimate
[03:22:06.600 --> 03:22:12.600]  details of my interactions with people as well to really doll this stuff up uh i mean number one
[03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:15.800]  i don't have time to go around talking about people behind the scenes if i do it'll be on the air
[03:22:16.520 --> 03:22:23.880]  but um really nasty co until pro type tactics or they've got armies of people out saying really
[03:22:23.880 --> 03:22:31.320]  horrible things and then endorsing me uh and they're doing that to try to toxify the name alex
[03:22:31.320 --> 03:22:37.240]  jones assassinate my name instead of me physically and perhaps ahead of doing it physically but that's
[03:22:37.240 --> 03:22:43.480]  why i always try to say don't get involved in a debate about alex jones don't defend me because
[03:22:43.480 --> 03:22:49.480]  if it's about the information then it doesn't have the taint of my name that they've painted
[03:22:49.480 --> 03:22:55.240]  even though there isn't a real tank there they've put the artificial tank there so just don't get
[03:22:55.240 --> 03:23:00.840]  involved in the debate uh move forward warning people about the globalist they want to change
[03:23:00.840 --> 03:23:06.200]  the subject and make it a side show what we do need your help in doing is saying hey go listen to
[03:23:06.200 --> 03:23:10.440]  the alex jones show there's a free iphone app free droid app free podcast free video feed info
[03:23:10.440 --> 03:23:16.200]  wars dot com prison planet dot com hey here's here's my membership to prison planet dot tv
[03:23:16.200 --> 03:23:22.120]  11 people can use it simultaneously pass that on to others today do it today get them to watch
[03:23:22.120 --> 03:23:28.520]  the nightly news but so tell folks about it alex jones info wars dot com and what we do but don't
[03:23:28.520 --> 03:23:37.880]  defend us and magnify their lives okay because all that does is give it legs um i mean if they
[03:23:37.880 --> 03:23:43.240]  killed me which they might do i mean folks i know i'm gonna die i'll be 80 before i know it
[03:23:43.240 --> 03:23:48.120]  yeah well i'm so sure i'm not worried about it really i don't want to die but i i love the idea
[03:23:48.120 --> 03:23:51.960]  of freedom so much i'm not even worried about it it's actually very empowering not to be worried
[03:23:51.960 --> 03:23:56.840]  about it but they will run a bunch of hit pieces and scandals right after they kill me i will need
[03:23:56.840 --> 03:24:03.240]  to be defended then because uh the issue is then they'll try to hurt the whole movement if they
[03:24:03.240 --> 03:24:08.600]  can sink me so that's what i need to be defended is when they kill me which which is 50 50 probably
[03:24:08.600 --> 03:24:12.600]  even the next five years or so they'll kill me or set me up put me in prison something like that
[03:24:12.600 --> 03:24:19.160]  but just know i have already won i've already made the decision to do this i've already know the
[03:24:19.160 --> 03:24:23.400]  danger i mean i'll get death threats and go you know we can kill you you know we can and i'm like
[03:24:23.400 --> 03:24:29.160]  well what do you think i'm stupid i mean the system can't believe that i'm just committed
[03:24:29.160 --> 03:24:33.480]  and that's it and that's all there is and there's no there's nothing else that doesn't mean they
[03:24:33.480 --> 03:24:37.640]  can't electro shock torture me and get me to come out and say i'm ronald mcdonald if they want the
[03:24:37.640 --> 03:24:43.800]  point is this conscious human in this time and space in a zen way is alive forever and i'm not
[03:24:43.800 --> 03:24:49.240]  worried about it okay i made the right decision in front of my creator and that's what matters
[03:24:51.480 --> 03:24:56.200]  god judges the heart that's what you have to understand we're all wicked we all have problems
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:25:01.320]  but it's our heart what's our inclination and that's what you've got to decide what where is your
[03:25:01.320 --> 03:25:09.080]  heart where is your spirit what do you choose do you choose life you choose death you choose truth
[03:25:09.080 --> 03:25:13.960]  do you choose lies do you choose to be a narcissist or you choose to be an individual that tries to
[03:25:13.960 --> 03:25:21.080]  empower others and none of us are perfect but the enemy will come and tell you how you're imperfect
[03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:25.880]  just so you feel inadequate never do anything because they know you're good they know only good
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:32.600]  people listen to that type of stuff ignore the enemy move forward against them but i think about
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:36.760]  my choice and that's why it almost brings tears in my eyes and i have trouble talking about it
[03:25:36.760 --> 03:25:43.800]  because it's it's it's who i am it's everything it's the commitment it's my essence i come close to my
[03:25:43.800 --> 03:25:49.960]  soul i come close to everything i had everything i ever will be in the decision to not be evil in
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:56.920]  the decision to not be a liar in the decision to stand and not be a coward and that is the fulfillment
[03:25:56.920 --> 03:26:01.880]  of life let's go ahead and take a call let's talk to bill in virginia thanks for holding her on the
[03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:09.960]  air uh thank you much yeah i went to the redskins game yesterday and the security changes are
[03:26:09.960 --> 03:26:19.480]  extraordinary uh a bunch of new people all black uniforms i recognize one is being a retired local
[03:26:19.480 --> 03:26:27.400]  police officer and had a chat with them and uh that it was intentional to be intimidating you know
[03:26:27.400 --> 03:26:34.280]  wearing that kind of outfit and uh then on top of that there were a few people wearing you know assault
[03:26:34.280 --> 03:26:40.440]  rifles and you know exposed guns who were not police they were private security i've never
[03:26:40.440 --> 03:26:44.840]  encountered that kind of thing no no sir is it look they did the boston bombing clearly that's
[03:26:44.840 --> 03:26:50.360]  an operation as i said to roll this out and they've had it all and it's the roll out of martial law
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:57.160]  and of mercenaries on the streets of america absolutely but you know made what's been a
[03:26:57.160 --> 03:27:02.280]  very uh nice experience for decades for me and my friends and family you know made it very uncomfortable
[03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:06.440]  well here's the thing a lot of people say well just let them do it you know they're real terrorists
[03:27:06.440 --> 03:27:11.400]  blah blah blah that yeah rides at the global start funding not really it's now going to be on your
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:15.240]  street and then it's going to be in your house so the thing is they're coming and you got to
[03:27:15.240 --> 03:27:19.880]  ask yourself what's the gear up for uh i i think you know the answer to that why do you think they're
[03:27:19.880 --> 03:27:27.400]  gearing up for all this uh intimidation is a lot of it just so that you'll do what you told uh when
[03:27:27.400 --> 03:27:34.760]  they want to you know order you about yeah when they come to take your guns they are planning and
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:39.800]  training for it for a war they're going to start with us and they've got all these cops and guys on
[03:27:39.800 --> 03:27:46.600]  roids who just want to have combat and they really think combat with 10 million or more veterans
[03:27:46.600 --> 03:27:53.960]  and a bunch of mad americans is going to be fun i mean i i just okay i just whatever you want it
[03:27:53.960 --> 03:27:58.520]  you're going to get it and they're going to say we're all terrorists what happens well there's
[03:27:58.520 --> 03:28:05.400]  an executive order from march 16 2012 that sort of lays out the groundwork for how the government
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:10.920]  and an emergency you know all the obama has to do is say it's an emergency and then various cabinet
[03:28:10.920 --> 03:28:16.920]  members will head up divisions that you know one can that's right and congress is totally suspended
[03:28:17.560 --> 03:28:23.560]  uh and congress is not even allowed to see the full plan yeah that's a big deal that particular
[03:28:23.560 --> 03:28:29.080]  executive order uh that's the way they're gonna you know confiscate everything they want um
[03:28:29.080 --> 03:28:35.800]  not too many people are aware of that one but yeah march 16 2012 folks should look it up absolutely
[03:28:35.800 --> 03:28:42.040]  absolutely i think i i'm going to look that up i remember that executive order they had a bunch
[03:28:42.040 --> 03:28:46.760]  of them that do the same thing yeah it's sad i can hear the sadness in your voice well they're
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:50.120]  going to do it because they're going to take everybody's pensions basically and then create a
[03:28:50.120 --> 03:28:54.280]  federal one that the money goes to offshore banks that'll be a pittance of what you would have gotten
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:29:00.440]  previously uh i mean did the did the retired cop not not realize what a joke it was or did he really
[03:29:00.440 --> 03:29:05.480]  think it was a fake terror alerts that alcada was going to try to attack that day he was joking
[03:29:05.480 --> 03:29:12.040]  saying that uh they called this new uh security team the goon squad and he was sort of chuckling
[03:29:12.040 --> 03:29:16.520]  about it and i don't really know this guy that well um and there's some other officers where i
[03:29:16.520 --> 03:29:24.520]  live and i've seen him at some of the events they have but uh yeah it makes you upset world's changing
[03:29:24.520 --> 03:29:29.160]  and language you never want to see well let me tell you they're training to take you to a femacamp
[03:29:29.160 --> 03:29:34.600]  bud i mean they're not they're not let me tell you in that cop well first it's mercenaries and
[03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:39.240]  it's checkpoints then now we're arresting people but they'll tend to go along with it because well
[03:29:39.240 --> 03:29:45.240]  they're part of the winning team but they're not those mercenaries after they've taken us out
[03:29:45.240 --> 03:29:50.120]  are going to shoot that cop in the back of the head and i'm not joking
