[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:27.560]  how do you bring down a free society how do you enslave a planet well you
[00:27.560 --> 00:33.280]  finance radicals you fund them you turn them loose you give them safe havens and
[00:33.280 --> 00:40.680]  then you create giant defense spending platforms and set up giant spy grids and
[00:40.680 --> 00:46.000]  they are protecting the public from the threat and here we are all these years
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.840]  after 9-11 and we are supposedly more unsafe now than ever despite the
[00:51.840 --> 00:55.720]  trampling of our liberties and our governments never get in trouble when we
[00:55.720 --> 01:00.360]  get attacked they just get more promotions and more elaborate budgets
[01:00.360 --> 01:07.280]  and if you ask what's going on with ISIS that's it we've seen a more than
[01:07.280 --> 01:12.080]  quadrupling of Islamic immigrants into Europe since 9-11 we've seen a doubling
[01:12.080 --> 01:16.080]  according to the Justice Department and of course Congress and different groups
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.800]  that break down the numbers ICE and others to this country now again I
[01:20.800 --> 01:24.160]  personally do not think that the average Muslim wants to blow stuff up and kill
[01:24.160 --> 01:32.520]  people but the dominant culture in Islam now is run out of Saudi Arabia and is a
[01:32.520 --> 01:39.800]  vein of Islam known as Wahhabi in some which is of course a sector of the
[01:39.800 --> 01:48.280]  majority system of Islam which is Sunni now a lot of people are asking me you
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.320]  know is this an inside job and the answer is yes but not the traditional
[01:52.320 --> 02:03.520]  fashion it it could be but the evidence is pointing towards this being spill
[02:03.520 --> 02:09.320]  over out of Islamic States Jihad that's been funded and turned loose across
[02:09.320 --> 02:15.040]  Africa and the Middle East as well as areas of Asia and so the system has
[02:15.040 --> 02:20.840]  been turned loose and the system knows that the public is so politically
[02:20.840 --> 02:29.280]  ignorant and so politically dumbed down that when the very groups our
[02:29.280 --> 02:34.680]  governments have been funding attack us the response won't be hey we should
[02:34.680 --> 02:39.680]  prosecute the politicians like Hillary Clinton that were neck deep in all this
[02:39.680 --> 02:43.800]  hey we should have congressional hearings hey we shouldn't have been doing
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.320]  this all along hey we should be releasing the 28 pages of the 9-11
[02:48.320 --> 02:56.160]  Commission but instead we're told the answer is take out Assad who for five
[02:56.160 --> 03:01.920]  years has been fighting al-Qaeda al-Nazra now known as Islamic State now I want to
[03:01.920 --> 03:08.760]  open the phones up early in the shower even ahead of Paul Watson and Job eggs
[03:08.760 --> 03:14.600]  with crew joining us from Paris France they of course gave us live coverage
[03:14.600 --> 03:20.280]  yesterday during the Sunday broadcast 4 to 6 p.m. central they'll be joining us
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.680]  at the bottom the hour into the next hour interspersed with your phone calls
[03:24.680 --> 03:35.320]  800-259-9231 800-2599-231 specifically on what do you think about the
[03:35.320 --> 03:40.400]  situation in France and other Islamic State terror attacks happening across
[03:40.400 --> 03:45.200]  the world and the controlled media's attempt to act like it's not Islamic
[03:45.200 --> 03:56.280]  terror to continue the open borders and the flood of so-called refugees 800-259-9231
[03:57.080 --> 04:00.920]  but it is a false flag and that our governments helped fund and create these
[04:00.920 --> 04:06.880]  groups open the borders up advertise freebies and let people come in and then
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.960]  demonized anyone and everyone who exposed that this would be coming that
[04:12.960 --> 04:19.400]  this would be happening so there is blood on the hands in every angle you
[04:19.400 --> 04:27.160]  look at a Barack Obama of the French president of the German Chancellor
[04:27.160 --> 04:30.880]  Merkel and of these other European leaders that went along with this
[04:30.880 --> 04:34.360]  separately if you get Italian members of the Senate or French members of the
[04:34.360 --> 04:39.960]  Senate or French members of their parliament or even Rob Lowe coming out
[04:39.960 --> 04:43.960]  and saying boy I should have shut your borders before this there is all this
[04:43.960 --> 04:48.480]  fake consternation and outrage like the people that were proven right are
[04:48.480 --> 04:53.200]  somehow horrible demons this is an attempt again to overturn reality
[04:53.200 --> 04:58.040]  because globalism is insanity it is at war with reality
[04:58.040 --> 05:02.360]  President Obama still plans to accept 10,000 migrants into the US despite the
[05:02.360 --> 05:06.040]  November 13th Paris attacks linked to migrants associated with ISIS
[05:06.040 --> 05:09.840]  White House Deputy Secretary advisor Ben Rhodes said the administration was
[05:09.840 --> 05:14.160]  still planning to take in Syrian refugees over the next year he said quote we
[05:14.160 --> 05:18.080]  have very robust vetting procedures for those refugees involves our
[05:18.080 --> 05:21.800]  intelligence community our National Counterterrorism Center extensive
[05:21.800 --> 05:25.400]  interviews vetting them against all the available information but the FBI
[05:25.400 --> 05:29.400]  already admitted that the US can't vet all the migrants for terror ties during
[05:29.400 --> 05:33.880]  an October 21st House hearing FBI Director James Comey said quote we can
[05:33.880 --> 05:37.480]  only query against that which we have collected and so if someone has never
[05:37.480 --> 05:41.120]  made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or
[05:41.120 --> 05:44.360]  their interests reflected in our database we can query a database until
[05:44.360 --> 05:47.400]  the cows come home but there will be nothing to show up because we have no
[05:47.400 --> 05:51.280]  record of them so to sum it up Obama is creating the conditions ISIS needs to
[05:51.280 --> 05:55.480]  launch attack on US soil this is kid Daniels with info wars.com and keep

[08:24.440 --> 08:30.520]  civilizations dreamed of in the year 2000 by Dick Cheney and the authors of
[08:30.520 --> 08:36.080]  the PNAC report rebuilding America's defenses or is it a global crisis out
[08:36.080 --> 08:41.560]  of which planetary police state and a cashless society will be established
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.840]  it's both my friends thank you for joining us on this Monday live worldwide
[08:46.840 --> 08:53.600]  broadcast the 16th day of November 2015 our intrepid reporters Paul Joseph
[08:53.600 --> 08:58.840]  Watson Michael Zimmerman and of course Joe Biggs will be joining us from
[08:58.840 --> 09:04.400]  Paris France in about 25 minutes from now I intend to also start going to your
[09:04.400 --> 09:08.400]  phone calls to get your take on the situation but here's the big picture
[09:08.400 --> 09:16.560]  analysis right now we know the West funded and created ISIS out of al Qaeda
[09:16.560 --> 09:22.280]  groups in Syria we know they gave them weapons we know our own military came
[09:22.280 --> 09:27.480]  out in the last two years and refused to support it ISIS then it appears turned
[09:27.480 --> 09:33.400]  partially against the West Saudi Arabian back and turned against Iraq to then
[09:33.400 --> 09:38.880]  loot that area and set up their caliphate there is some evidence now that the
[09:38.880 --> 09:43.080]  French and others have actually turned against ISIS and are bombing them
[09:43.080 --> 09:51.120]  hence the retaliatory response on Friday the 13th in Paris again we're not a
[09:51.120 --> 09:54.000]  hundred percent sure about that we are speculating but the evidence is
[09:54.000 --> 10:01.400]  mounting here's a daily mail article Putin comes in from the cold desperate
[10:01.400 --> 10:04.760]  world leaders cozy up to Russian president to get him to join the fight
[10:04.760 --> 10:09.480]  against ISIS again there's that spin that he hasn't been fighting ISIS
[10:09.480 --> 10:14.200]  Barack Obama seen sharing a joke with Russian president at G20 David Cameron
[10:14.200 --> 10:17.960]  meets Vladimir Putin one-on-one for the first time in a year I mean they've
[10:17.960 --> 10:23.080]  kicked him out of the G8 they've been moving weapons in against the Russian
[10:23.080 --> 10:28.560]  border and now the Saudi Arabians have been threatening Europe threatening
[10:28.560 --> 10:32.040]  Russia threatening everybody that if they aren't given Syria and if they
[10:32.040 --> 10:36.600]  aren't given part of Iraq they are going to throw giant fits and activate
[10:36.600 --> 10:40.280]  terror groups they've got all over the world
[10:41.440 --> 10:45.200]  world that daily says France goes to war with ISIS start of World War three
[10:45.200 --> 10:52.280]  we're gonna get Dr. Corsi on very very soon to break all of that down but this
[10:52.280 --> 10:58.240]  is the crisis that the big megabanks will clearly use along with other crises
[10:58.240 --> 11:03.040]  to bring in their planetary regime it's about playing nation-states off against
[11:03.040 --> 11:08.960]  each other it's about deindustrializing countries it's about bringing areas of
[11:08.960 --> 11:15.960]  the world back to the dark ages but all of that said here is the overarching
[11:15.960 --> 11:23.520]  issue the lever with which we the people not just of the United States but of
[11:23.520 --> 11:29.360]  the world of Europe of the Middle East of Africa of Latin America of Asia of the
[11:29.360 --> 11:38.920]  South Pacific from Australia to Chile from northern Canada to Russia from
[11:38.920 --> 11:45.200]  Portugal to Austin Texas it doesn't matter where you are this affects you
[11:45.200 --> 11:52.560]  whether you're in South Africa or Japan whether you're in Mongolia or Turkey it
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.120]  doesn't matter this affects you governing by crisis governing by chaos
[11:57.120 --> 12:02.480]  governing by fear-mongering governing by centralizing control governing by a
[12:02.480 --> 12:09.080]  security state if you've got a military industrial complex that Eisenhower of
[12:09.080 --> 12:13.320]  course warned about that gets trillions and trillions of dollars a year just in
[12:13.320 --> 12:17.600]  the United States alone and that governs by fear and that is owned by private
[12:17.600 --> 12:22.360]  banks and private families what do you need you need chaos to stay in control
[12:22.360 --> 12:27.680]  and I'm tweeting this as we speak I wrote it during the break at real Alex
[12:27.680 --> 12:40.200]  Jones Obama has blood on his hands for funding and protecting ISIS in Syria
[12:40.200 --> 12:46.840]  WikiLeaks is right and there's the tweet just went out Obama has blood on his
[12:46.840 --> 12:52.240]  hands in Paris for helping to create ISIS WikiLeaks was right and you click
[12:52.240 --> 13:02.040]  on that article from the weekend WikiLeaks has been demonized as saying
[13:02.040 --> 13:06.680]  that America was to blame for the attacks but when you scroll down to what
[13:06.680 --> 13:13.480]  WikiLeaks actually said they said Western governments are to blame because
[13:13.480 --> 13:21.400]  they helped feed ISIS that's what WikiLeaks had to say and ladies and
[13:21.400 --> 13:26.520]  gentlemen that is a fact and we talked about this since Benghazi happened in
[13:26.520 --> 13:33.520]  2012 we asked over and over and over again how are they gonna get away with
[13:33.520 --> 13:40.600]  funding al Qaeda in Syria and all over the Middle East and of course in Libya
[13:40.600 --> 13:45.200]  launching all these attacks and what happens when they then attack the West
[13:45.200 --> 13:48.520]  and our own government's created it how will they get away with it they will say
[13:48.520 --> 13:53.760]  that we're unpatriotic they will say that we're blaming America and the
[13:53.760 --> 13:57.960]  American flag no we're blaming the criminals that have taken over our
[13:57.960 --> 14:03.040]  government that are involved in all this and I believe the establishment has
[14:03.040 --> 14:09.400]  been off more than they could shoot Obama is preparing the climate with the
[14:09.400 --> 14:14.720]  open borders with the Syrian refugees coming in for terror attacks in America
[14:14.720 --> 14:22.160]  that will be used to expand the NDA the Patriot Act all of it and then common
[14:22.160 --> 14:29.840]  sense and logic will be suspended and no one will say why did you help create
[14:29.840 --> 14:35.000]  these groups why did you fund them why did you bring them in we just saw
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.400]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people some estimates for over 300,000
[14:40.400 --> 14:47.600]  killed in Syria low estimates about 180,000 in the last five years with the
[14:47.600 --> 14:53.480]  quote good rebels who are al-Nusra slash al-Qaeda attacking and murdering and
[14:53.480 --> 14:59.520]  bombing and killing everyone and blowing up every church they can find
[15:03.360 --> 15:09.320]  who humanizes all those Christians that are being killed few humanizes all
[15:09.320 --> 15:12.520]  those priests being murdered who humanizes all the women that don't
[15:12.520 --> 15:18.200]  wear hoods on their heads being killed who humanizes all the Africans in Libya
[15:18.200 --> 15:23.200]  who've been killed by the tens of thousands by these very groups who
[15:23.200 --> 15:27.200]  humanizes them no one but you get a hundred and thirty something dead in a
[15:27.200 --> 15:33.680]  whole bunch of in a string of attacks inside France and you'd think it's the
[15:33.680 --> 15:36.920]  end of the world because they're now going to misdirect our energies to go
[15:36.920 --> 15:42.440]  into Syria and actually aid the very people who have been there attacking
[15:42.440 --> 15:46.520]  that sovereign nation those innocent people for almost five years and if
[15:46.520 --> 15:52.320]  that happens successfully that is the triumph of abject total and complete
[15:52.320 --> 15:57.080]  ignorance of the people and the sky's the limit it is what George Arwell
[15:57.080 --> 16:05.760]  warned about 1984 come true it is two plus two equals five it is mass
[16:05.760 --> 16:11.240]  insanity it is mass mental illness
[16:14.280 --> 16:20.480]  our criminal occupational government our occupied captured government is
[16:20.480 --> 16:24.920]  clearly planning another string of terror attacks in Europe in the United
[16:24.920 --> 16:28.320]  States and other countries and by planning it they're bringing in the
[16:28.320 --> 16:31.880]  people that will do it just as sure as the sun comes up in the morning and when
[16:31.880 --> 16:38.240]  they attack us we'll be told it's our way of life what's left of freedom that
[16:38.240 --> 16:43.080]  has to be sacrificed when we've trampled our freedom but they've left the
[16:43.080 --> 16:47.280]  borders wide open to bring in unlimited refugees from all over the world and
[16:47.280 --> 16:52.640]  told us we got to pay for it this is rubbing our noses in it in an arrogant
[16:52.640 --> 17:05.080]  way I personally have never seen it is a breaking of our will so the White
[17:05.080 --> 17:10.400]  House because that's where the buck stops and the National Security Council
[17:10.400 --> 17:18.640]  directed the policy just as Europe has under UN edict under the UN migration
[17:18.640 --> 17:25.160]  head borders and migration head has dissolved our borders and our sovereignty
[17:25.160 --> 17:31.960]  and are the authors are the kingpins are the bosses are the mafia dots Peter
[17:31.960 --> 17:37.040]  Sutherland of the United Nations Barack Obama president of the United States
[17:37.040 --> 17:43.800]  the French president the German Chancellor Merkel all of them are to blame
[17:43.800 --> 17:50.240]  and have blood on their hands directly and knowingly and they're gonna have
[17:50.240 --> 17:54.680]  more blood on their hands when there's more terror attacks in this country and
[17:54.680 --> 17:58.880]  common sense is suspended when they're telling you they got to have checkpoints
[17:58.880 --> 18:04.000]  on random highways and got to feel you up at the airport that the spy on your
[18:04.000 --> 18:10.480]  internet activity and watch your shopping purchases while the border stays
[18:10.480 --> 18:17.160]  wide open and the radicals pour in by the millions across Europe and the United
[18:17.160 --> 18:24.960]  States and it's in the millions from all different parts of the world
[18:30.760 --> 18:34.800]  it's all coming up I'm gonna take your phone calls when we come back from
[18:34.800 --> 18:38.560]  break please remember and I want to thank you all for your support you're

[22:28.720 --> 22:33.880]  and they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has

[24:22.280 --> 24:28.000]  confuse the public turn them loose to murder every question they can find and
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.880]  then to watch them attack the West as we've been predicting at nauseam they
[24:31.880 --> 24:36.200]  would and then grandstand and talk about how much they love us I don't really
[24:36.200 --> 24:42.260]  watch NFL football but Darren McBreen I said he watched three games yesterday one
[24:42.260 --> 24:47.000]  of our reporters he wants to do a report on it later he said every game they
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.560]  would show a patchy helicopters flyover or F-16s flyover and would a moment of
[24:52.560 --> 24:57.680]  silence for the dead French comrades and then cut to French troops by our troops
[24:57.680 --> 25:03.000]  now I'm all for a moment of silence with French I'm against the 130 something
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.320]  dead I think it's terrible we tried to stop it happening but now the state
[25:08.320 --> 25:16.400]  just uses it for pure propaganda to prop up the criminals we've got it's just
[25:16.400 --> 25:21.400]  crazy how they've dumbed the debate down and of course we told you this a years
[25:21.400 --> 25:27.560]  ago it was admitted earlier last month that millions of dollars are paid a
[25:27.560 --> 25:36.800]  year per team in some cases tens of millions of dollars a year total to
[25:36.800 --> 25:42.720]  engage in those patriotic displays it's all fake you know the NFL so patriotic
[25:42.720 --> 25:47.040]  they should not be paid to do it oh by the way it's come out they're also paid
[25:47.040 --> 25:53.120]  to do anti-gun pieces and to have their reporters make anti-gun statements you do
[25:53.120 --> 25:57.480]  understand that when I plug during the segments and I openly talk about a
[25:57.480 --> 26:04.800]  product I'm being honest with product placement talk radio is honest about it
[26:04.800 --> 26:12.560]  when you watch the NFL or NHL or NBA or good morning America or any of these
[26:12.560 --> 26:18.000]  shows almost all of it is paid they're reading off a teleprompter when they
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.260]  talk about a movie or they talk about a book or they go oh let's look at these
[26:21.260 --> 26:26.960]  cosmetics or oh let's look at this blender or oh I really like President
[26:26.960 --> 26:31.880]  Obama or oh I'm really upset about guns they are going through a teleprompter
[26:31.880 --> 26:36.160]  by the way I've been on these national sets I've seen it but but it's admitted
[26:36.160 --> 26:41.040]  and they'll have like one paragraph and a fake debate and they're told what to
[26:41.040 --> 26:48.800]  say be upset be happy it's all fake fake fake fake fake and if I tell people
[26:48.800 --> 26:52.920]  this they tell the average yuppie that's a conspiracy theory none of it's fake
[26:52.920 --> 27:01.800]  it's all fake people it's paid for I get up here and say this hour brought to
[27:01.800 --> 27:07.160]  you by and tell you who it's brought to you by and they do that too on these
[27:07.160 --> 27:14.280]  shows but that's nothing so that's what folks should be aware of and it's not
[27:14.280 --> 27:18.680]  just selling products it's selling anti-family anti-male anti-private
[27:18.680 --> 27:24.760]  property anti-gun anti-conservative anti-libertarian and then they'll talk
[27:24.760 --> 27:28.840]  about how much they love the troops to get you to join the military but then
[27:28.840 --> 27:32.040]  have the propaganda that once you're out of the military you can't be trusted
[27:32.040 --> 27:36.880]  might be a terrorist and all the TV shows and all the movies and all the
[27:36.880 --> 27:42.160]  stuff now which is about federalizing police and promoting black lives matters
[27:42.160 --> 27:45.680]  and all this stuff of course black lives matter when they're being aborted by
[27:45.680 --> 27:48.720]  the millions or one fluoride but oh no we're never supposed to worry about
[27:48.720 --> 27:54.320]  those black lives just the handful of blacks being killed wrongly by police
[27:54.320 --> 27:57.440]  that becomes the biggest issue in the world because it's meant to create
[27:57.440 --> 28:01.360]  racial division and I know you know that but this is balkanization let's let's
[28:01.360 --> 28:06.200]  at least get one call in now then I'm gonna come back into all the breaking
[28:06.200 --> 28:11.800]  news stuff we've not been covering while the crisis is happening which is the
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.080]  big kickoff for more terror make no mistake and more and our reporters
[28:15.080 --> 28:20.480]  joining us Jay in Pennsylvania thanks for calling today you're on the air all
[28:20.480 --> 28:25.600]  right man thanks to be honest I know you said that you weren't sure if Paris was
[28:25.600 --> 28:30.000]  a false flag but there's some mounting evidence come out there's this guy
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.280]  Patrick Pellew first name Patrick Latham spelled P-E-L-L-O-U-X he was an EMT and
[28:37.280 --> 28:41.000]  witness at Charlie Hebdo and he's on France info radio which like their
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.080]  mainstream radio like like MPR here and he's saying that they had a multi-site
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.880]  exercise planned for that morning and quote they were prepared as luck would
[28:50.880 --> 28:56.120]  have it and he's in the radio saying this so wow well I've always said if
[28:56.120 --> 29:01.320]  there's a drill at the exact same place at the same time that's your sign it's
[29:01.320 --> 29:04.800]  at least partially staged because they use that to cover up the operation if
[29:04.800 --> 29:09.080]  anybody gets caught by another agency or group that's the cover story so you're
[29:09.080 --> 29:14.680]  telling me that on major French radio they're saying that the Hebdo attack of
[29:14.680 --> 29:21.360]  last year or this this this theater attack was a drill no right this guy was
[29:21.360 --> 29:25.040]  a he's a Kourtney MP and he was a witness no there it is it's on we're gonna
[29:25.040 --> 29:28.160]  post the whole article from global research we're affiliated with them
[29:28.160 --> 29:31.000]  we'll post the whole article we were prepared counterterrorism emergency
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.440]  exercise a multi-site attack took place on same day as Paris terrorist attacks so
[29:36.440 --> 29:42.120]  we'll see if that happened directly at the same area because then it really
[29:42.120 --> 29:46.040]  bumps up into false flag territory we know the CIA had was meeting with the
[29:46.040 --> 29:49.520]  French intelligence head as well and a lot more we're on the March the
[29:49.520 --> 29:56.560]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:57.880 --> 30:02.140]  Black Lives Matter activists another radical leftist are using the hashtag
[30:02.140 --> 30:06.720]  F Paris to voice their anger over the fact that the ISIS attacks have shifted
[30:06.720 --> 30:09.640]  the public's attention away from the University of Missouri protests the
[30:09.640 --> 30:13.640]  disgusting hashtag started trending on Twitter Sunday as Soros backed activists
[30:13.640 --> 30:17.320]  grew outraged over the fact that the public is more concerned about the 129
[30:17.320 --> 30:21.160]  people killed in Paris than they are about safe spaces one self-described
[30:21.160 --> 30:25.480]  internationally known activist tweeted quote I ain't seen one dead body on the
[30:25.480 --> 30:30.440]  Paris attacks prayer for Paris my butt F Paris Black Lives Matter basically
[30:30.440 --> 30:34.040]  speaking the F Paris crowd is claiming that more people are paying attention to
[30:34.040 --> 30:37.360]  the Paris terrorist attacks in the Mizzou protests because the Paris
[30:37.360 --> 30:41.960]  massacre is a so-called white tragedy as if we should judge tragedies by the
[30:41.960 --> 30:45.960]  victim's skin color a notion that's inherently racist but it is interesting
[30:45.960 --> 30:49.120]  to note however that the same global elites who have radicalized the Black
[30:49.120 --> 30:53.000]  Lives Matter movement are also the same ones who created conditions for ISIS to
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.120]  attack Paris you can find out more info wars.com this is Kit Daniels

[33:21.160 --> 33:25.320]  now ladies and gentlemen I've already broken down the basic facts the West
[33:25.320 --> 33:31.920]  opened up the borders publicly ahead of the UN program said it is about ending
[33:31.920 --> 33:36.280]  European sovereignty as we know it it is about world government there is a
[33:36.280 --> 33:40.440]  giant world government conference coming up next month in Paris the most
[33:40.440 --> 33:45.600]  important the UN says in their history the Pope has announced three months ago
[33:45.600 --> 33:50.960]  that world government and global taxation with a world court and world army
[33:50.960 --> 33:57.360]  will be announced and finally ratified at this event the TPP has been passed
[33:57.360 --> 34:02.400]  and completed without the public being able to see it of course on record as
[34:02.400 --> 34:12.920]  well we are living in epic epic times and on top of it all black lives matter
[34:12.920 --> 34:22.640]  supporters release F the Paris rap song black lives matter activists upset the
[34:22.640 --> 34:28.320]  massacre removed media attention from Mizzou protests and it's a large group
[34:28.320 --> 34:32.720]  Breitbart's reported on it we reported on it even before they did but I got to
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.240]  say Breitbart found the memes that they were putting out from like a hundred
[34:37.240 --> 34:42.900]  years ago showing French soldiers with dead Africans implying somehow that these
[34:42.900 --> 34:48.600]  international people at a concert deserved it I mean it's crazy in fact
[34:48.600 --> 34:55.480]  show the Breitbart one for TV viewers the Breitbart article on black lives
[34:55.480 --> 35:02.440]  matters doubles down as the headline says F Paris and you look at the memes I
[35:02.440 --> 35:09.960]  mean it's crazy folks it's pure racism because French soldiers went around
[35:09.960 --> 35:17.400]  conquering areas of Africa a hundred years ago now the French deserve to be
[35:17.400 --> 35:20.880]  machine gunned and bombed even though most of them were foreigners at a rock
[35:20.880 --> 35:27.920]  concert white on white crime what France thinks about blacks then it shows stuff
[35:27.920 --> 35:33.440]  from Angola and things with the French as if other armies didn't put other
[35:33.440 --> 35:38.920]  people's heads on sticks and then it continues on showing illustrations from
[35:38.920 --> 35:43.720]  actually 200 plus years ago saying well France basically deserves this I mean
[35:43.720 --> 35:53.240]  this is sick it's like weird tit for tat stuff and it is pure racism this is
[35:53.240 --> 35:56.200]  what's being promoted in fact I want to take those memes that Breitbart had and
[35:56.200 --> 36:01.240]  Adam de Paul Watson's article because it really illustrates the type of craziness
[36:01.240 --> 36:05.280]  that the left is engineered where the left brings in the outside populations
[36:05.280 --> 36:10.520]  into Europe hypes them all up full of hatred of white people and hatred of
[36:10.520 --> 36:16.080]  Christianity and then lets them have a free-for-all then turns around and
[36:16.080 --> 36:23.120]  deploys a police state on the French on the Germans and then black lives matter
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.640]  is throwing fits because they want more attention because of the infamous poop
[36:28.640 --> 36:35.680]  swastika and somebody might have heard of racist slang once and in weird statements
[36:35.680 --> 36:39.760]  about how dare you give more attention to this white tragedy than the black
[36:39.760 --> 36:50.200]  tragedy nobody got killed at the college just absolute insanity meanwhile talk
[36:50.200 --> 36:55.520]  about more evidence of an inside job more evidence of prior knowledge terrorist
[36:55.520 --> 37:00.400]  involved in Paris attacks was previously charged by Interpol AFP and others
[37:00.400 --> 37:04.400]  are reporting it is known the international terrorism warrant was
[37:04.400 --> 37:10.840]  issued for one of the attackers by Interpol here is another report out of
[37:10.840 --> 37:16.160]  the Times of India Paris attack police stopped Paris attack suspect near
[37:16.160 --> 37:24.480]  Belgian border hours before after the killing but let him go and then it goes
[37:24.480 --> 37:30.000]  on to report that they were brought in at least some of them as Syrian refugees
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.760]  who weren't even Syrian who made it on boat lifts who were rescued from boat
[37:35.760 --> 37:43.200]  lifts off the coast of Greece months ago and so you're saved Africa won't even
[37:43.200 --> 37:46.400]  go out and save the boats when they come back they won't even take people that
[37:46.400 --> 37:51.640]  flee but when Europe takes you the answer is attack with hang grenades and
[37:51.640 --> 37:56.880]  shoot people now again the caller earlier was saying we don't know this was a
[37:56.880 --> 38:01.640]  false flag a staged event a self-inflicted wounded on the fact that
[38:01.640 --> 38:05.760]  the media wasn't ready to jump on this with scripts within minutes is one sign
[38:05.760 --> 38:09.560]  it wasn't the fact that there was a general anti-terror drill going on in
[38:09.560 --> 38:13.360]  Paris that's now been confirmed that day points towards it being a false flag
[38:13.360 --> 38:17.640]  the fact that the CIA director was there meeting with the head of French
[38:17.640 --> 38:24.160]  intelligence that day very suspicious the fact that France was just starting to
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.200]  step up its attacks in Syria suspicious unless you just think it's ISIS
[38:28.200 --> 38:34.920]  striking back we have our reporters on the ground we'll get their takes on that
[38:34.920 --> 38:41.720]  in just a moment but but here's what I'm getting across to everyone this is the
[38:41.720 --> 38:52.080]  fault I don't even know if you call it a false flag this is the fault of the West
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.960]  because they created the climate they open the borders they advertise the
[38:55.960 --> 39:00.200]  freebies they said come here they accepted the fake passports they let the
[39:00.200 --> 39:05.760]  military-aged men in they let the radicals in ISIS said in February we're
[39:05.760 --> 39:18.720]  gonna flood you with 500,000 immigrants they said they were going to do this and
[39:18.720 --> 39:23.480]  so now it's happened a month ago the ISIS head said we've now infiltrated you
[39:23.480 --> 39:32.840]  prepare for attacks so this is definitely something where we can say the
[39:32.840 --> 39:37.840]  blood of these dead people is on the establishment's hands and now as I said
[39:37.840 --> 39:41.760]  earlier will they get away with the new attacks that are going to come will the
[39:41.760 --> 39:47.000]  people responsible for this get away with it the French president the German
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.800]  Chancellor the American president all of them are guilty the Greek government the
[39:54.800 --> 39:59.680]  Turkish government being a conduit out of Syria every jihadi you can imagine goes
[39:59.680 --> 40:03.040]  to Syria they got their buck kicked so now they're allowed to come through
[40:03.040 --> 40:06.800]  Turkey and they're allowed to infiltrate Europe that's what's going on ladies and
[40:06.800 --> 40:12.400]  gentlemen period we now take you live to Paris where they've got burning
[40:12.400 --> 40:17.400]  refugee centers more soft-target attacks stabbing shootings burnings are
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.080]  happening but it's being kept very quiet some French are responding back
[40:21.080 --> 40:27.280]  attacking some of the quote refugees some Muslim businesses have been shot up
[40:27.280 --> 40:30.920]  in different parts of the US this is all part of the class of civilizations
[40:30.920 --> 40:38.200]  warming up now has this gotten out of control for the establishment or is it
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.600]  going according to plan always with piercing analysis Paul Joseph Watson
[40:42.600 --> 40:47.480]  joining us from downtown Paris Paul I just set the table what do you make of
[40:47.480 --> 40:52.800]  all this well I think the biggest story Alex to emerge today out of these attacks
[40:52.800 --> 40:56.880]  out of Paris and France in general is the fact that we've had these huge raids
[40:56.880 --> 41:00.800]  across the country and also in Belgium in fact there's some interesting video
[41:00.800 --> 41:05.080]  which is on Joe Biggs's Facebook page from an army source that we're gonna
[41:05.080 --> 41:09.920]  investigate more later which shows apparently some of these terrorists
[41:09.920 --> 41:13.920]  being killed with one of them still alive that's not being shown on the major
[41:13.920 --> 41:18.120]  news networks as far as I'm aware so we're gonna look into that further but
[41:18.120 --> 41:22.600]  yes huge raids across the country and remember going back to Charlie Hebdo
[41:22.600 --> 41:27.280]  there was a guy who got up on Fox News a terror expert called Steve Emerson and
[41:27.280 --> 41:32.800]  he said that these jihadist cells these radicalized cells are going to emerge
[41:32.800 --> 41:37.920]  out of quote no go Muslim areas of Paris what happened to him at the time
[41:37.920 --> 41:43.200]  this terror expert he was laughed at by the entirety of the mass media Fox News
[41:43.200 --> 41:48.360]  was actually sued by the mayor of Paris for quote Islamophobia merely for this
[41:48.360 --> 41:53.240]  guest saying there are no go Muslim areas where these cells are being radicalized
[41:53.240 --> 41:59.360]  so what do you see today across France and in Belgium in Mollenbeek Muslim
[41:59.360 --> 42:03.800]  ghettoes no go areas where the Belgian government admits they've completely lost
[42:03.800 --> 42:09.200]  control of these areas that's where the plot for this event unfolded in those
[42:09.200 --> 42:13.600]  ghettos in Belgium and some in Paris so that's the major story to emerge out of
[42:13.600 --> 42:18.360]  today because three months ago in fourwalls.com reported that French
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.040]  security experts were basically preparing the army warning that they
[42:23.040 --> 42:29.440]  were drilling to reapportion areas of the city to claim them back from these
[42:29.440 --> 42:34.560]  radicalized communities these jihadists the weapons are flowing in from Libya so
[42:34.560 --> 42:39.600]  as near as three months ago they were preparing to take back these communities
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.240]  that would rise up in the event of being radicalized and that's exactly what's
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.720]  happening that's why they're now being raided today but we were laughed at for
[42:47.720 --> 42:52.960]  warning about that a year ago Charlie Hebdo and everyone was called Islamophobic
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.280]  simply for drawing attention to it again we were proven deadly accurate so I
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.920]  think that's the biggest story to emerge out of events today and we're showing
[43:01.920 --> 43:07.760]  this incredibly dramatic footage of the raids taking place and I was reading
[43:07.760 --> 43:11.280]  another Defense Department report on this just yesterday where they were saying
[43:11.280 --> 43:19.320]  that the weird rapper gangster culture in these ghettos of Muslims all over the
[43:19.320 --> 43:23.760]  world is mutating to where they're not even really Muslims they're more of
[43:23.760 --> 43:31.160]  like a gangbanger death cult it's just totally disgusting yeah and then of
[43:31.160 --> 43:35.360]  course you've got the flip side which is the middle class in countries like
[43:35.360 --> 43:40.880]  Germany being radicalized again top secure again Paul Watson reporting from
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.040]  Paris France his kite broke up for a moment we will reconnect with him and
[43:45.040 --> 43:50.720]  go back then Joe Biggs will be joining us after we take phone calls in the next
[43:50.720 --> 43:58.280]  hour as they move to another position but again ladies and gentlemen this is
[43:58.280 --> 44:05.520]  unprecedented and Putin has put the establishment in check by by actually
[44:05.520 --> 44:13.640]  going in and striking real ISIS targets and their El Nuzra Al Qaeda command
[44:13.640 --> 44:20.120]  bases Putin comes in from the cold desperate world leaders cozy up to
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.280]  Russian president to get him to join the fight against ISIS Barack Obama seen
[44:25.280 --> 44:29.840]  sharing a joke with the Russian president at g20 David Cameron met with
[44:29.840 --> 44:36.160]  him on one-on-one Paul Watson what do you make of the Russia situation what's
[44:36.160 --> 44:41.440]  happening in Turkey right now with a g20 well they're all cozying up to Putin
[44:41.440 --> 44:44.720]  aren't they they're all trying to save face because of course two three months
[44:44.720 --> 44:48.960]  ago he launched the massive offensive against ISIS so now after you know
[44:48.960 --> 44:52.760]  trying to shun him for several weeks they're trying to cozy up to him a lawn
[44:52.760 --> 44:57.080]  has achieved the unimaginable of making himself look stronger than another
[44:57.080 --> 45:02.320]  world leader of course he said it was an act of war and now Obama is cozying up
[45:02.320 --> 45:07.200]  to him but a lawn is making Obama look weak because at least a lawn has some
[45:07.200 --> 45:10.480]  good rhetoric then you've got another video which you might want to play which
[45:10.480 --> 45:14.760]  is on my Twitter stream which is a reporter actually confronted Obama
[45:14.760 --> 45:20.600]  today while he was doing a speech at this g20 and said you said ISIS was the
[45:20.600 --> 45:24.320]  JVT now what do you say in the aftermath of this we need to destroy these
[45:24.320 --> 45:28.840]  quote bastards somebody said that in front of Obama as a direct question
[45:28.840 --> 45:33.240]  during a conference today so basically Obama's reeling his reputation is
[45:33.240 --> 45:38.440]  reeling and yet still we've got this attitude again this is salon.com we
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.200]  see this from them all the time this is the headline yesterday do the Paris
[45:42.200 --> 45:48.120]  attacks mean it's time to accept more refugees in Europe this is salon.com
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.560]  Muslims in Europe are marginalized and maligned by right-wing nationalists can
[45:52.560 --> 45:55.800]  we stop terror attacks by making them feel more at home by accepting more
[45:55.800 --> 46:00.520]  Muslims in Europe so again they're basically saying oh the poor marginalized
[46:00.520 --> 46:04.440]  ISIS jihadists we're being too insensitive to them we need to bring
[46:04.440 --> 46:07.840]  more of their bodies over to make them feel more comfortable that's the
[46:07.840 --> 46:11.760]  attitude of this again cock-holded left wing that we see again and again let me
[46:11.760 --> 46:15.240]  raise that what do you make of Madonna saying it's the West fault we should
[46:15.240 --> 46:20.240]  love the jihadis it's our fault and then Rob Lowe simply tweets oh now France
[46:20.240 --> 46:24.440]  closes its border that's all he said and he's being crucified as a demon you see
[46:24.440 --> 46:29.520]  what they're doing is so over the top that they have to attack reality and act
[46:29.520 --> 46:33.800]  like normal behavior is outrageous because what they're doing is outrageous
[46:33.800 --> 46:39.400]  Paul. Yeah and then you've got the cultural flip side where we talked about
[46:39.400 --> 46:44.120]  black lives matter again you mentioned it earlier we've got a rapper who is a
[46:44.120 --> 46:49.440]  black lives matter supporter coming out with a song called F Paris again on the
[46:49.440 --> 46:54.720]  back of this Twitter trend which emerged yesterday which we reported on and
[46:54.720 --> 46:58.720]  basically they claimed that this was all just you know anti-black lives matter
[46:58.720 --> 47:02.800]  people getting outraged about this which was why it started trending that's not
[47:02.800 --> 47:06.680]  the case as you saw with our article in the Breibart article these were actual
[47:06.680 --> 47:11.960]  BLM race baiting activists that started that and now just what two three days
[47:11.960 --> 47:16.440]  after the terror attacks somebody releases a song saying F Paris the
[47:16.440 --> 47:20.880]  leader the de facto leader of black lives matter D Ray McKesson came out and
[47:20.880 --> 47:27.840]  said this is comparable this equates the massacre of 130 plus people equates to
[47:27.840 --> 47:31.880]  what was happening at Mizzou equates to somebody drawing a poop swastika on a
[47:31.880 --> 47:36.720]  bathroom wall equates to somebody yelling allegedly a racial slur out of a
[47:36.720 --> 47:40.600]  pickup truck that's the de facto of black lives matter saying that the
[47:40.600 --> 47:44.720]  exactly and folks there are bad things happening to some black people in this
[47:44.720 --> 47:48.360]  country we stand against that but it's blown a trillion times out of
[47:48.360 --> 47:53.240]  proportion it's Soros run and that's why we totally stand against black lives
[47:53.240 --> 47:59.080]  matter because it is a nasty evil organization so hateful that it would
[47:59.080 --> 48:05.320]  make sick jokes and celebrate the dead French and it just and by the way dead
[48:05.320 --> 48:09.360]  Europeans and dead Africans a bunch of people got killed it was a very diverse
[48:09.360 --> 48:14.680]  group this just shows you if they'll say this in public how hateful and nasty
[48:14.680 --> 48:19.960]  are these people in reality Paul you mentioned the reporter during Obama's
[48:19.960 --> 48:24.200]  speech today just a few hours ago he then took questions from the
[48:24.200 --> 48:29.400]  international press corps here is the powerful exchange her reporter tears in
[48:29.400 --> 48:34.800]  to Isis in front of Barack Obama thank you very much mr. president I wanted to
[48:34.800 --> 48:38.400]  go back to something that you said to Margaret earlier when you said that you
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.040]  have not underestimated Isis's abilities this is an organization that you once
[48:44.040 --> 48:49.360]  described as a JV team that evolved into a force that is now occupied
[48:49.360 --> 48:54.120]  territory in Iraq and Syria and is now able to use that safe haven to launch
[48:54.120 --> 48:59.480]  attacks in other parts of the world how is how is that not underestimating their
[48:59.480 --> 49:04.320]  capabilities and how is that contained quite frankly and I think a lot of
[49:04.320 --> 49:07.560]  Americans have this frustration that they see that the United States has the
[49:07.560 --> 49:11.080]  greatest military in the world it has the backing of nearly every other
[49:11.080 --> 49:15.120]  country in the world when it comes to taking on Isis and I guess the question
[49:15.120 --> 49:21.440]  is and if you'll forgive the language it is why can't we take out these bastards
[49:21.440 --> 49:26.440]  well Jim I just I just spent the last three questions answering that very
[49:26.440 --> 49:33.800]  question look Saudi Arabia runs it the West is funding it we've had the former
[49:33.800 --> 49:36.720]  head of defense intelligence co-publican said they were ordered to support them
[49:36.720 --> 49:41.000]  that's what's happening and now they're being intimidated and squeezed by Russia
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.040]  into responding and now Isis has gone crazy and I and I believe this is Isis
[49:46.040 --> 49:50.760]  directed it's their MO and has done this so does this show an internal split is
[49:50.760 --> 49:57.080]  Isis now bucking the West saying stop putting heat on us or what do you make
[49:57.080 --> 50:01.760]  of the CIA being on site what do you make of there being a drill what is the
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.520]  motive for a Western false flag where they bear minimum let these people
[50:05.520 --> 50:09.240]  attack because we know they open the borders we know they brought them in we
[50:09.240 --> 50:12.760]  know they know they had weapons Paul we're skipping this network break bare
[50:12.760 --> 50:16.240]  minimum they knew this something like this would happen Paul I mean what's
[50:16.240 --> 50:23.000]  going on is the foreign policy really just unraveling well it's blowback on a
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.920]  massive scale isn't it we've been warning about it for 18 months we were
[50:26.920 --> 50:30.960]  called racist we were called Islamophobic and now it's happening which is why I'm
[50:30.960 --> 50:34.960]  not led to believe that it's the false flag because it was all too predictable
[50:34.960 --> 50:39.680]  I mean you had one of the bombers coming through a Greek island of course they
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.480]  found the Syrian passport but they tracked him they were able to tell that he
[50:43.480 --> 50:47.800]  came in through that Greek island via his fingerprints so that's one example
[50:47.800 --> 50:51.400]  there are a lot of these conspiracy theories they say how could the passport
[50:51.400 --> 50:55.320]  have survived the blast well they identified him via his fingerprints
[50:55.320 --> 50:59.200]  which were also taken in Greece when he came into the country back through
[50:59.200 --> 51:04.520]  Syria so he's positively been identified as somebody whether he was Syrian or not
[51:04.520 --> 51:10.040]  doesn't matter he abused this refugee this migrant wave that now EU Commission
[51:10.040 --> 51:14.800]  head Yonker says will continue to happen Merkel says it will continue to
[51:14.800 --> 51:19.600]  happen they say we must be tolerant of the migrants and here's another statement
[51:19.600 --> 51:23.400]  which I just tweeted out earlier this is from the grand musty there in
[51:23.400 --> 51:27.960]  Australia remember we had these top imams in Jerusalem saying we're going to
[51:27.960 --> 51:32.960]  abuse this migrant wave to breed out Western populations that's how we're
[51:32.960 --> 51:38.040]  going to conquer them again those were his words not mine a top imam in
[51:38.040 --> 51:41.760]  Jerusalem said that a couple of months ago now we've got the grand musty out
[51:41.760 --> 51:48.360]  of Australia saying that unless France tackles Islamophobia and racism then
[51:48.360 --> 51:52.120]  more of these attacks will happen that's the grand musty you know it's
[51:52.120 --> 51:55.960]  basically a threat not saying you should crack down on them not saying you
[51:55.960 --> 51:59.720]  should go after them defeat this ideology that's causing these attacks but
[51:59.720 --> 52:05.240]  you should cut back on Islamophobia okay you look at each incident 9 11
[52:05.240 --> 52:11.080]  Madrid train bombings London bombings Charlie Hebdo this attack there's been
[52:11.080 --> 52:16.160]  no mass wave of Islamophobia Muslims aren't getting attacked on the streets
[52:16.160 --> 52:19.960]  of Paris you know there are sporadic incidents a few fires here and there
[52:19.960 --> 52:25.040]  the refugee census there's been no mass wave of you know citizen Islamophobic
[52:25.040 --> 52:33.520]  attacks on Muslim people so when they bring that concern again Paul Watson
[52:33.520 --> 52:36.680]  okay your Skype was breaking up continue Paul Watson you know Muslim people
[52:36.680 --> 52:42.600]  are not not going to be any more safe than they are here Paul I want to take
[52:42.600 --> 52:46.120]  some calls and I want you guys to get reposition take about a ten minute break
[52:46.120 --> 52:49.840]  and then I'm going to come back with Joe Biggs at eight after in the next hour
[52:49.840 --> 52:54.440]  then I'm gonna let you guys obviously finish up your reporting or go get some
[52:54.440 --> 52:59.120]  dinner or whatever you need to do but you say you had no trouble getting into
[52:59.120 --> 53:03.600]  France neither did Joe Biggs obviously Interpol's got all your data via your
[53:03.600 --> 53:07.560]  passport have you had any other issues with police since you've been on the
[53:07.560 --> 53:13.080]  ground I say that because we've had issues with cameras in England and in
[53:13.080 --> 53:18.080]  Spain where they basically banned having cameras on the streets as a form of
[53:18.080 --> 53:23.400]  cracking down on the press overall what signs of a police state if any have you
[53:23.400 --> 53:28.600]  seen in Paris well there's some security guys right behind us now they seem
[53:28.600 --> 53:32.280]  pretty jovial they're not like trying to stop us film but from what I've seen
[53:32.280 --> 53:37.160]  arriving I haven't seen any military on the streets I've seen you know police
[53:37.160 --> 53:41.680]  with guns which basically look like weak rifles we knew the police were
[53:41.680 --> 53:44.880]  complaining after Charlie have though they didn't have enough firepower to take
[53:44.880 --> 53:49.120]  on these terrorists but in general the the security is more relaxed than I
[53:49.120 --> 53:54.480]  expected it to be. Biggs arrived a few hours earlier and it's not as intense as
[53:54.480 --> 53:58.120]  you would expect given what we've seen and what happened on Friday night but
[53:58.120 --> 54:02.920]  Biggs and Michael visited the theater the site of the theater attack which you
[54:02.920 --> 54:07.000]  can't really get too close to but again there's not too many police around there
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.440]  and Biggs will tell you about that later but it's not as intense as you would
[54:10.440 --> 54:14.440]  suspect certainly if you compare it to London which of course we visited a
[54:14.440 --> 54:18.400]  couple of weeks after the 7-7 bombings where basically everywhere we went
[54:18.400 --> 54:24.360]  simply for taking photographs of flowers in a tube station we were harassed by
[54:24.360 --> 54:28.240]  the police we were harassed by the police for filming anywhere so far and
[54:28.240 --> 54:33.880]  we've only been here since yesterday no harassment so that's interesting. Well
[54:33.880 --> 54:38.520]  anybody that understands real terrorism when it does happen knows that giving up
[54:38.520 --> 54:41.640]  your freedom taking people's rights setting up checkpoints everywhere does
[54:41.640 --> 54:46.600]  not protect you it never has you've got to go after who's actually stirring it up
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.000]  who's causing it and you don't give it a bunch of political attention to
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.000]  basically empower those that have been involved in. I think the jury's out on
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.840]  whether this was completely staged or not I don't think it was from the
[54:58.840 --> 55:05.800]  evidence we have mounting there is kind of a leftist attempt to take over the
[55:05.800 --> 55:09.480]  quote conspiracy movement that just means questioning movement and to
[55:09.480 --> 55:14.880]  basically brand any type of Islamic misbehavior as a conspiracy theory. No
[55:14.880 --> 55:18.080]  it's a fact that ISIS has been murdering hundreds of thousands of people
[55:18.080 --> 55:22.120]  along with Al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda same group and our government's been
[55:22.120 --> 55:25.720]  supporting it that's the real conspiracy and the real conspiracy is opening the
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.200]  borders and bringing them in to do it which I just think shows the incredible
[55:29.200 --> 55:32.760]  arrogance they don't care if ISIS kills people they'll just take more of our
[55:32.760 --> 55:37.080]  rights and they think the public's so dumb that the politicians won't be held
[55:37.080 --> 55:41.400]  accountable but Paul there's real anger taking place right now and I think the
[55:41.400 --> 55:46.080]  establishment has miscalculated I think Merkel's in trouble I think the French
[55:46.080 --> 55:49.480]  president's in trouble no matter how much patriotic garbage they involve
[55:49.480 --> 55:52.440]  themselves in I think you should talk to folks on the street a lot of them
[55:52.440 --> 55:55.600]  speak English there and ask you know is your government responsible for opening
[55:55.600 --> 56:01.640]  the borders I mean your French president closing them now just for you know a few
[56:01.640 --> 56:07.760]  months or whatever that's too little too late. Well yeah and Aland of course is
[56:07.760 --> 56:12.440]  massively unpopular anyway because he's basically wrecked the economy so he's
[56:12.440 --> 56:16.960]  gonna be out in the next election and again as I said yesterday Marina LePanne
[56:16.960 --> 56:20.120]  is going to win the first round she's gonna do well in the regional elections
[56:20.120 --> 56:23.920]  coming up here but they've got a national election in 2017 she's almost
[56:23.920 --> 56:27.800]  certain to win the first round then the establishment's gonna come in and say
[56:27.800 --> 56:32.400]  that this is gonna represent a bigger threat than you know Islamic radicalization
[56:32.400 --> 56:36.320]  because she's the only one really in France who is calling for the radical
[56:36.320 --> 56:40.360]  extremist Moss to be shut down who is calling for the migrant wave to be turned
[56:40.360 --> 56:44.640]  back and she's got huge and growing support here in France because she
[56:44.640 --> 56:48.880]  distanced herself from her father who was seen as more right-wing more radical
[56:48.880 --> 56:52.760]  so they're starting to attract more moderate support there's a Pagida
[56:52.760 --> 56:57.160]  movement in Germany which is starting to attract more quote moderate support so
[56:57.160 --> 57:01.760]  you know a conservative wave is sweeping Europe it has been for the past year 18
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.560]  months and that's what the political elite the establishment are terrified of
[57:06.560 --> 57:11.680]  and these attacks only bolster the will on behalf of many more that's right
[57:11.680 --> 57:15.360]  that's right all right Paul Watson Skype is cut out we'll talk to Joe Biggs
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.320]  coming up at eight after next hour I'm gonna take some phone calls when we
[57:19.320 --> 57:23.600]  come back and then after Biggs leaves us John and Jennifer and Aaron and Maya and
[57:23.600 --> 57:27.600]  Eli and everybody we're going to go to you so please be patient briefly this

[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.960]  Texas Alex Jones

[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.280]  see the children of the Western governments these al-Qaeda people
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.960]  attacking and mainstream media is not pointing that out wiki leaks does and
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.640]  it's demonized John in Florida you're on the air thanks for holding thanks for
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.000]  calling what's your take on the situation okay thanks for taking my call
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Alex you know my take on this is desperate people do desperate things I
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.440]  mean you know when you look back on this and you and I just say to myself you
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.120]  know these people appeared out of nowhere I mean a convoy as far as the eye
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.080]  could see of Toyotas and come on man if they got to know who sold them those
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.720]  Toyotas I mean come on this is outrageous but I'll go with it another
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.480]  way in the sense that that one of the things I've been wondering is is you've
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:20.120]  got this rate hike coming up supposedly on December 10th and I've been wondering
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.920]  how they're gonna do that they can't do that but the same thing they're gonna
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:30.120]  have some reason why they can't and right on cue Alex right on cue all over the
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.600]  financial TV this morning well I don't know they're gonna be able to do that
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:41.000]  now you know I mean the bottom line here is we're bankrupt and the reason why
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.240]  we're bankrupt is because the money is all debt and you've reached debt
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.080]  saturation and by the way Alex don't think that China don't want this to they
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.880]  want this world war just like the Pope has said we're in World War three they
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.040]  wanted to because they know they got off about a good billion of their people and
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.800]  they can't do it themselves they got to have a boogeyman too and we're gonna
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.480]  serve the purpose of that boogeyman man you're a good caller I mean everything
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.320]  you're saying makes perfect sense and and the globalists say their problems
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.320]  managing billions of people feeding us keeping the resources going all they do
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.640]  is complain about having to quote take care of us the elite of our stolen the
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.080]  planet financially they think they own it they think we're in the way and all
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.880]  they talk about is ways to office in fact I remember Mao Zedong saying is a
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.880]  famous quote where the only country that could survive and prosper from a
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:44.560]  nuclear war and then his his replacement made similar comments as well so what
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.800]  you said is a very informed statement and what they're what they're what they're
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.800]  obviously you know you brought up some good points and previous shows about
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:59.120]  how the machines are replacing people this is the reason for the carbon tax
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.120]  because you cannot have a money system based on debt that is supported by
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:10.920]  income taxes income taxes require growth they don't want growth anymore this is
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.960]  the reason for carbon tax right because they get rid of the population and
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:22.000]  still tax the people to support whatever new money system they come up with but
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.440]  there's a reason why you have zero interest rates you know what that is
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:32.360]  because that is the value of the money the value of the money is zero and it's
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.760]  inherent in the fact that the written that the rate is zero if the money had
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:42.320]  value that I mean think about it if somebody gives you something for nothing
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:47.680]  what's the value in it to them nothing nothing that's the that's the whole
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.840]  problem that we have here now America cannot get back to where we were because
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:58.280]  because now with 3d printing and I mean the machines are going to take over we
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.680]  don't need people to do all these things and by the way at the bottom of the hour
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.760]  we have the writer Charles Arthur who wrote the big one and Guardian article
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:11.680]  coming on artificial intelligence homo sapiens will be split into a handful of
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.560]  gods and the rest of us and how the elite also plan to just get rid of the
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.520]  population that you guys print me Bill Joyce why the future doesn't need this
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:25.920]  article thank you from of 16 years ago because this is the real not debate but
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:32.480]  decision that was come to by the 60s and we're now living in this plan and
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.840]  getting pretty deep into it so you're absolutely right and that's the message I
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.480]  try to get out to people is that a planetary government's being established
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:44.280]  not to create prosperity and help us go to the stars but to end humanity as we
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.960]  know if the decision has been made that we're a failed species and the elite
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.200]  believe they will transcend us in a transcendence talk about a delusional

[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:15.040]  Jones and the GCN radio network well one thing is certain a group of things are
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.720]  certain info wars comm predicted exactly what's unfolding with the Russian
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.760]  aircraft going down the attacks on theaters the attacks on Army Navy
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:30.320]  Marine Corps recruiting centers here and the fact that the media is basically
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.560]  not even pointing out that our own governments are bringing these people
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:39.760]  in that multiple attackers have been identified as refugees and it was also
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.720]  predictable they would just say hey give up your rights now we'll keep you safe
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:48.480]  but with your borders wide open simply amazing now coming up at the bottom of
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:51.720]  the hour we're going to shift gears for 30 minutes into artificial intelligence
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.480]  homo sapiens will be split into a handful of gods and the rest of us that's a
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.480]  London Guardian article I covered last week we have the author Charles Arthur
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.480]  on this is what the elites are saying
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.440]  speaking of elites the French government is talking about not having
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:12.640]  workers at all and being all robots within just a few years what's the point
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.880]  of that we'll talk about the in-game coming up but and of course we're going
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.720]  to go to Aaron we're going to go to Maya we're going to go to Eli we're going to
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.280]  go to all the folks that are holding as well on the Paris attacks but popping in
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:29.480]  is Joe Biggs has been filing prolific reports from on the ground in Paris
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.680]  France with his unique military perspective being a combat veteran
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.440]  staff sergeant of Iraq and Afghanistan multiple Purple Hearts dealing with
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:42.640]  these very same types of folks we do now know about drills they were having
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.600]  us being reported by global research specialist general drills we also know
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.440]  that the CIA head was there the day of the event but does that mean a peer
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.760]  false flag why does it matter they brought him in to begin with so the
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:59.560]  governments to blame regardless debate over Joe Biggs yes I don't believe that
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.440]  it's a false flag attack whatsoever you know like Paul said earlier this has
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.000]  been building up to where it is now you know you could see this coming from a
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.800]  mile away and just like in a fight Alex what do you do you find a person's weak
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.600]  spot and you continue to hit that spot you know Paris is pretty much a very
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.960]  weak spot when you look at it all around so it's easy for these guys to carry
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.880]  out these attacks in this area and that's why I think they'll continue I
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.320]  mean you have the prime man a prime minister of France coming out today
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.560]  saying to the people to stay vigilant that they think that there'll be another
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.880]  attack and then you also have the president of France coming out saying
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:44.200]  that these act or feed breaking up to Joe Biggs come back in a moment hold on
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.520]  Joe we'll come back to you in just a second and I tend to agree with him
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.440]  again there's real terrorism folks but still it doesn't matter our criminal
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.960]  governments allowed it in and it's not the government low levels fault it's the
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:02.400]  high-level leaders Joe you're back yes I agree I mean definitely there's a lot
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.560]  of people up top having a part in what's going on but at the same time you
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.680]  know if if people had the ability to protect themselves a lot of these
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.840]  things wouldn't happen and it just seems like the government's out there they
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.320]  don't want that to happen they want to let the borders wide open the fact that
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.840]  you want to come out and call that racist or Islamophobic it's completely
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.520]  mind-blowing I don't understand how you can come to that conclusion you know the
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.320]  fact that these attacks keep happening and like Paul said you don't see a large
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:32.040]  amount of these Muslims are out here getting beat up or anything like that
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.800]  but you're seeing a lot of attacks from these Islamic terrorist groups but yet
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:41.080]  when you call them out on it here's on the phobic you're a bigot you're racist
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.400]  and that's the craziness is going on in the world right now well a lot of the
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.800]  black lives matter groups are getting more intense they're not apologizing for
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.520]  saying F Paris they're saying these are white people they deserve it yeah that's
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.280]  disgusting I mean I number one the guy to Ray McKesson I can't stay in that guy
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:02.160]  he's a worthless person and the so-called leader of black lives matter you know
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.360]  there are a few people in that movement I think that have a pure heart who really
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.720]  want to make some kind of change but that that entire movement has been hijacked
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.120]  it's not a low level people are just thugs and criminals or folks that are
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.160]  upset and angry and they're being manipulated by the mainstream media that
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:21.360]  legitimizes all of this it's disgusting how you can compare a massacre to a
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:27.480]  poop swastika on a wall really that that that brought you the pain of losing
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:31.560]  family members loved ones friends it'll never come home friends that you thought
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.360]  you would see after a concert but it'll never come back again you know so many
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.280]  people wanting that they wishing they had that last chance to say final words
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:46.080]  but these people are complaining and whining because of something drawn on a
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.400]  wall the definition is real rotten babies when they when they complain we're
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.680]  not just it's not just in the zoo go to University of Texas go to all of these
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.360]  colleges around the world it is ridiculous what is being taught much
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.640]  less the brainwashing going on and the fact that these people are not smart
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:10.920]  enough to see past that propaganda and come out with a clear precise thought on
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.760]  really what's going on they can't see past well how could you not empathize
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.440]  with hundreds of people shot up who they don't even know who they are I mean a
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.920]  bunch of them are quote minorities it's just it's bizarre Joe you're gonna have
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:29.800]  more reports you're filing but before we leave you go to calls other information
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.400]  that you've dug up well I mean it's interesting right here if you actually
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:38.040]  look at the top of drudge it says Paris attack puts dagger through heart of
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.680]  liberal Europe which is correct France warned about terrorists twice before
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:47.600]  a strike bombers mother my son blew himself up because he was stressed what
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:51.840]  kind of BS is that really you're stressed out so you decided to strap a
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.360]  bomb on you and go kill a whole bunch of innocent people that is ridiculous well
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.680]  you heard Madonna she said that it's our fault we need to love these people
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:06.280]  yeah it's our fault yeah but you know what props to Governor Abbott he wrote a
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:11.080]  letter to President Obama today saying the Texas will not take in Syrian
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.080]  refugees and I'm glad that I remembered this but if you actually look at one of
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:21.360]  the local papers in Louisville Kentucky they will be taking on 12 Syrian or yeah
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.320]  12 Syrian refugees I think in the next couple days and they're expecting those
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:30.720]  numbers to double over the next course of a few months so you still have people
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.200]  out there that are ignoring the fact that this stuff is happening not saying
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.640]  that every single one of those refugees coming over is bad but all it takes is
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.840]  one and that one person to go in and plant a seed and start up a team and
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.360]  carry out something that happened like here sure there's over there's over a
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.200]  hundred different sites where they're coming to and again if it was all women
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.320]  and children they could prove they were really Christian refugees or or non
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.440]  radical refugees most of them are men they're pouring in they've got fake
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:03.320]  passports our government knows this so when they have their hands down my pants
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:08.320]  the fawn of plane it's all just theater well now you have this new ISIS video
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:12.760]  out that came out today saying that their next target will indeed be the heart
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.680]  of America in Washington DC so you know it's definitely gonna be interesting to
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.040]  see how this plays out if this is part of the fear game propaganda what's gonna
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:27.720]  happen out of this Joe Biggs reporting from Paris France thank you so much be
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:32.560]  safe we'll be following your reports at info wars calm and prison planet calm
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:38.360]  there goes Joe Biggs people here cannot drive oh that's another issue you've
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:46.080]  noticed got Almighty all right we'll be talking to Joe more there he is in
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:50.280]  Paris France I'll get into some of the other stories that are up on info wars
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.800]  calm after the break right now let's go to Aaron in Washington who's been
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.440]  holding patiently Aaron thanks for calling in on this Monday edition go
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:03.040]  ahead hi Alex good to talk to you Aloha from Washington State just
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.640]  perfectly God Almighty hallelujah first of all I want to say God bless you and
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.240]  Jesus name and everybody listening I just pray that everybody would have
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.560]  wisdom about this and not look at this whole Paris thing one dimensionally but
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:21.440]  realize I mean you really got to have a mind to see the spirit that we are just
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.960]  really traveling in a physical vehicle you know to get the full
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:29.600]  comprehension of what's going on here it is so complex you know Alex you know
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.320]  as smart as you are your three hours still wouldn't cover it you can do a
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:38.080]  10-hour documentary on the complexities of these things and you know I really
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.840]  wish Stan Monti was still around with us to talk about things like this this
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:49.440]  his perspective was really wise and blessed to have but um yeah I just want
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.760]  to encourage brothers and sisters you know good Christians pray for each other
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.840]  but pray for your enemies as well as as we're told to do and walk facefully you
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:02.120]  know King Solomon wrote that when a man's ways please the Lord he will even
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:07.000]  make his enemies to be his footstool so we need to continue living faithfully
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.440]  well I'm into that I agree with you specifically do you have any views about
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.360]  the attacks and where all this is going I mean I just don't see how Western
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.840]  governments won't be held accountable when they're the ones that did this on
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.720]  purpose and advertised come here you can get all these freebies and then let
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.760]  people in with fake passports they don't let me into the US with a fake
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:30.760]  passport they don't let me into Europe with a fake passport I mean this is
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:34.800]  deliberately done so is it just to rub our faces in it and see what they can get
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:40.680]  away with well yes Alex we all know that they have you know multiple purposes
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:45.200]  multiple benefits for these things and one of them is to you know service the
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:49.200]  distraction also to the big elephants in the room you know there's a few of them
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:54.280]  the whole climate conference is going to be going on soon yeah the fact that you
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.920]  pointed out they really instigated this whole thing you know like a demented
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.760]  zookeeper you know letting out certain animals to go fight each other you know
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:07.000]  that's kind of the satanic tactics that they use and oh by the way I really like
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.600]  your analysis the other day on the Friday the 13th and the connection to the
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.560]  nights you know that that was my first instinct as well was oh you know as soon
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.400]  as I heard the breaking news Friday the 13th you know start looking for those
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:24.360]  satanic signals sure I appreciate your call we got to go to break Aaron we're
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.880]  gonna come back and talk to Maya and others but I should have covered that
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:33.960]  more yesterday I probably should today in a viral report I put out a Saturday I
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.520]  just spent a few minutes on the fact that first I noticed it was Friday the
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:44.520]  13th and the Russian airliner destruction was on Halloween that's kind of a
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:48.640]  globalist occultic date but then I started thinking wait a minute Friday the
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:55.040]  13th originates back in the 1300s when the Knights Templar got rounded up by
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:01.240]  the King of France and the Pope on Friday the 13th and then they were burned
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:06.760]  at the stake and that's where just type in an origin of Friday the 13th that's
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:12.000]  where Friday the 13th first comes from as being unlucky is the date that the
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.040]  pretty much the leaders of the Crusades were rounded up double crossed and
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:22.680]  killed and that was on October 13th Friday October 13th 1307 Philip the
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:27.880]  4th of France arrested hundreds of the Knights Templar and then again had them
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.800]  killed a bunch of them ran to England and Scotland and basically moved the
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.720]  power base over there but there's some other messages going on here it's not
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:43.720]  just Friday the 13th folks it's in Paris where the origin of the date comes
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.840]  from those really I don't think are coincidences and the same thing with the
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:51.880]  Halloween situation again it's not even about governments folks it's like
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.280]  specter groups global corporate groups the UN the IMF World Bank
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.160]  Bilderberg that's how they operate something just happened that is
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.080]  explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:08.480]  out in many areas of the country it caught me totally by surprise and it
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:14.000]  involves FEMA I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof revealing

[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.840]  governments fund al-qaeda turn them loose a run around murdering people in four
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:18.440]  or five countries then they start attacking us and they grandstand about
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:26.240]  America stands with France and we're gonna help take out Isis Haland and then
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.640]  he's been instrumental in open borders and he's grandstanding it shows how
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.840]  stupid they think we are but I don't think we're as dumb as they think
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:43.440]  Maya in Kansas you're on the air welcome hi thank you for taking my call
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.920]  I'm gonna try and get as much in as I can forgive me for not know being as
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:53.120]  good on this but it seems to me like we need to in order to understand what's
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:25:01.000]  happening now we need to take a look at the end result of past skirmishes and
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.760]  I've gone back as far as 2003 at what happened between Bush's actions in
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:13.400]  Iraq and some of the key players then are the key players now with the
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.920]  exception of a few like Holbrook who died of a heart attack who for the most
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:25.880]  part what he was he played a big part in the post-recovery after everything that
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:31.640]  took place in 2003 Obama did not like him as a matter of fact if it wasn't for
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:37.160]  Hillary Clinton they would have removed hope he would have removed hold
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:43.120]  legacy Holbrook so what are you getting at with this what I'm saying is basically is
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:48.360]  that the same the the countries that were owed a great deal of money by Iraq
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:55.080]  okay Iraq was in debt to a lot of countries yes including France Germany
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:01.160]  Japan on and on and on I have a feeling that what we're looking at here is the
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:08.080]  beginning of a major grab and I get it because France has now been struck it's
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.480]  going to get to have part of the oil fields in Iraq same thing with Germany
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.760]  same thing with others well they've all they've always divided Iraq up from the
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:22.120]  beginning of the 2000 you know invasions all of it so absolutely I mean we have
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:26.200]  the invasions we have the situations that took place then we have the stuff
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.880]  that happened back in the 1990s you're absolutely on target Maya I appreciate
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.560]  your call let's go ahead and talk to Eli in Montana Eli you're on the air I was
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:43.560]  going good go ahead all right so I saw an article up on market watch yesterday
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:49.440]  that says after the Paris attacks it's time to form a world court and a world
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:57.720]  organization to go after terrorist groups and and all of these you know
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:04.040]  unfavorables now what do you think of this world court I know you mentioned it
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:10.840]  earlier but I want to get your cake on what you see happening because we we we
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:16.160]  always go to Joe Biggs or Paul Joseph Watson and you know what is what do you
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:22.000]  see is did the end game here with the US and Russia and France and all of them
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:30.080]  supporting going after ISIS and other and other group groups asterisk okay
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.400]  well we did put the article that you mentioned on screen and we'll put it
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:39.160]  back up on screen from market watch there is the headline with the
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:46.080]  establishment calling for international legal unit to fight terrorism and so
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.240]  that is global government and they've already basically set this up but they
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:54.280]  want to fully ratify it and trotted out to the world in December just a few
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:28:02.040]  weeks in Paris and so you I think I give my view and opinion all the time but
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:06.920]  you're saying I was getting Joe Biggs's view and Paul Watson's take on all this
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:12.960]  this is order out of chaos that's what I said last hour this is funding terror
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.160]  groups and they don't even care they end up striking us because then they'll
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:21.600]  just take our freedoms away so I think that's what it comes down to in fact
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.240]  that's what we see unfolding we predicted everything that's happening it's not
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:30.920]  hard to predict so that's that that's my view on this what do you think well I
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:35.320]  think you know a lot of people died on 9-11 I think a lot of people died in
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:41.800]  France and Kenya and Beirut over the last week and I think this is going to be
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:47.480]  justification for the next round of Patriot acts and and black backing
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.680]  people and I totally agree and it will be the the excuse for the open world
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:57.680]  government court that we have been talking about and absolutely so the
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.920]  question is did they stage the whole event or did they just let them come in
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:06.120]  and attack us and open the door either way the criminals that have hijacked our
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:11.120]  governments are guilty no one can disagree with that it is a fact so the
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.320]  next question is are we gonna let them get away with it that's the question oh
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:23.040]  no so we got our work cut out for us God bless you Eli appreciate your call
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:29.360]  I'm gonna shift gears for 30 minutes I'm gonna shift gears on two different
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:35.920]  subjects here dealing with the future of humanity straight ahead then we'll come

[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:54.160]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.600]  network
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.400]  President Obama still plans to accept 10,000 migrants into the US despite the
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.600]  November 13th Paris attacks linked to migrants associated with ISIS White
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:10.200]  House Deputy Secretary advisor Ben Rhodes said the administration was still
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:14.400]  planning to take in Syrian refugees over the next year he said quote we have
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:18.720]  very robust vetting procedures for those refugees involves our intelligence
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:22.720]  community our National Counterterrorism Center extensive interviews vetting
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:26.240]  them against all the available information but the FBI already admitted
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:30.520]  that the US can't vet all the migrants for terror ties during an October 21st
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:34.880]  house hearing FBI Director James Comey said quote we can only query against
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:38.440]  that which we have collected and so if someone has never made a ripple in the
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:41.760]  pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interests
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.240]  reflected in our database we can query our database until the cows come home
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.480]  but there will be nothing to show up because we have no record of them so to
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:52.120]  sum it up Obama is creating the conditions ISIS needs to launch attack on
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:31:03.560]  US soil this is kid Daniels with info wars dot com and keep checking back at info wars dot com for more reports and it's that type of behavior that

[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:07.800]  he's been working at the Guardians in 2005 as the newspapers a technology
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.800]  editor and it's still a contributing writer to the Guardian and I'm not going
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:17.280]  to go over his lengthy bio but the overspill dot wordpress dot com Charles
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.560]  Arthur dot com is also one of his websites and I saw an excellent lengthy
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:27.440]  article last week artificial intelligence homo sapiens will be
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:33.000]  split into a handful of gods and the rest of us a new report suggests that the
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  marriage of artificial intelligence and robotics could replace so many jobs at
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.120]  the era of mass employment could come to an end well the media is is basically
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:49.000]  saying this is you kind of a new thing and it certainly is more popular to talk
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.800]  about now because it's actually starting to arrive at least the first stages of
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:58.120]  it but if you go back to 1999 here's an article we've talked a lot about bill
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:04.240]  joy why the future doesn't need us this has discussions of the elite discussing
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.240]  just getting rid of everybody and of course you could argue seven and a half
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.880]  billion people are chewing up the earth but then so many people that aren't even
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.320]  part of the establishment say yeah get rid of the people well who's gonna do
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:21.800]  that it's kind of like in the remake of Superman has a eugenics plot to it and
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.360]  zod general zod is talking to talking to the chief scientist the planet he says
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:30.560]  these degenerate bloodlines and overpopulated planet I'm gonna exterminate
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.360]  all these scum and he says who's gonna decide you zod so see therein lies the
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:41.000]  problem and then once you start deciding don't build a planet for people build a
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.240]  social engineered planet well now you've got a technocracy controlling what info
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:50.800]  people get isn't that the ultimate tyranny then I see the elite trying to
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:56.000]  dumb us down to build us in the image they've claimed we are and I don't see
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.760]  the elite merging with machines and becoming god when they have that type of
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:03.760]  attitude but but I'm ranting Charles Arthur wrote an excellent article we
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.080]  get so many angles of the technical end of this of what's currently happening
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:12.240]  what's being projected because this isn't like getting rid of you know horse and
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:16.360]  buggy whip factories as we move to automobiles this is much much bigger and
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:21.440]  from my research the social engineering decisions been made to build a world that
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.560]  makes humans obsolete that's what Bill Joyce said 16 years ago we'll see what
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:31.320]  Charles Arthur has to say among the work he's done is to jointly create the
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:36.520]  free our data campaign which is very important as well and so much more so
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:40.000]  Charles Arthur thanks for coming on with us
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.360]  hi there Wow so much to get into I've been ranting about your article what got
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:51.400]  you interested in this particular area I was actually I was asked to write it by
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:55.400]  one of the editors at the Guardian so you know but it's a it's a topic that I've
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:01.560]  been interested in for sort of 30 years or so of that the potential for computer
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:08.760]  systems to hold the told the sort of knowledge that the people can hold but
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:13.360]  but it's sort of not accurate about holding so you know a doctor has an
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:19.400]  enormous amount of information that she might know and that she sort of passes
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:25.120]  exam with but then when it comes to say you've been on the emergency call for
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:28.840]  for 30 hours straight and you've you're trying to figure out whether some
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:32.400]  symptoms means one disease or a different disease you make the mistake
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:35.440]  about it and you know what you would hope is that the computer would actually
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:39.200]  be accurate in that situation so that's that's the sort of thing that I've been
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.800]  interested in though this report looks much more widely looks at the
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:47.600]  capability for computers allied to robots and I don't know artificial
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:52.680]  intelligence to take over a whole lot of jobs that are in effect sort of menial
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:57.720]  and and which actually could be done just as well by you know computers plus a
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:04.040]  robot which would to some extent sort of free people from the from the risks
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:09.160]  involved in a lot of a lot of jobs well Charles I mean I know from Hollywood
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.280]  movies and things we've been given a dystopic view of this but look at how
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.240]  screen time is lowering IQ and causing people to neurologically not be as
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:21.760]  advanced there's so many studies on that it makes my head spin look at how
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:25.440]  calculators have turned us into people that don't know how to engage in basic
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:30.840]  arithmetic look at how so many of the things that have made our lives easier
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:36.040]  have actually turned us you know into blobs I mean we're gonna turn to these
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.440]  little vestigial creatures that just like something out of the movie Wally
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:46.480]  that's my concern is I do see a major dystopic flavor to all of this that I
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:53.200]  kind of introduced earlier do you see any type of dystopic problem with this well
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.800]  if calculators are the problem and how does how is it that we got more advanced
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:59.720]  technology than we ever had before it's only since we've had calculators that
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:02.720]  we've been able to do that sort of work that we used to if we were all doing it
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.760]  on slide rules then I don't think you'd have a Google today so the tools aren't
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.040]  the problem it's more what you do with the tools and the availability of the
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:16.160]  internet for example has meant that people have more access to information
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:20.680]  and to accurate information than they ever had before it's simply a question
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:24.120]  of whether people go to the trouble of actually finding that information and
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:27.920]  doing the research themselves rather than say just stopping at the first
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.720]  couple of links that they find on a search page sure I agree that technology
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:36.640]  itself is is neutral and overall is good but even Bill Joy and the
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.760]  unabomber and others saw big problems with technology basically unseating
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:47.440]  humanity and making us obsolete I'm not sure if I take the unabomber quite as
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.040]  I don't know if I'd really want to be arguing anything from his side of the
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.200]  fence because inside the fence is the year the complete psychopath so so I
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.000]  don't know I think I'd leave him out the equation I mean no one no one has quite
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.160]  found an argument yet which says that we should deal away with all the
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:06.840]  technology because things are better because if you do that then you go you
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.760]  could just rewind back to the beginning of the Second World War there weren't
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.680]  any antibiotics you know I have a son who's deaf for example who's able to
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.280]  hear through a cochlear implant which is only developed through in the past
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.120]  thirty years so in a lot of ways you know technology advancement improves
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.680]  things it's more a question of encouraging people to make use of the
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:29.800]  information and the potential that's there in order to improve their lives
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:33.560]  because because when you do that then things get better there was a study by
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.120]  the University of London a few years ago which found that fishermen in Tanzania
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:42.680]  if they owned a mobile phone their income rose because they were able to
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:47.440]  phone ahead to markets and find places that would take their fish for better
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:51.640]  prices than others and you can sort of see that if people if those same people
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:55.280]  at smartphones they're able to send pictures of the fish to the markets and
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.440]  they can get better prices even so so you know in that sense the spread of
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:01.520]  technology makes things better what happens though is that all the old jobs
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:08.600]  that the old tedious dangerous jobs a lot of those go away and the bigger
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.520]  question is the one as you say sort of a bit about access to information so
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:17.640]  in that sense it's not a great thing if Facebook or Google has access to all
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:22.240]  our information or we feel that they're controlling our information that the
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.560]  important thing there is is to have access yourself to information that you
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:33.640]  can verify against the real world where you can use scientific method to
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:39.880]  distinguish cause and effect and where you have an informed populace but as to
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:43.800]  the sort of social effects that computers and robots taking over a lot of
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:48.160]  jobs has well that's that's really hard to see and you can imagine that you get
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:53.680]  a world where fewer people need to work and possibly you have one where the big
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.840]  corporations which are raking in all the money because they have they have the
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:02.400]  money to spend are actually taxed on their capital and that you I don't know
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.400]  you have a world which is actually more for the benefit of people well just to
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.480]  be clear I was not endorsing Theodore Kaczynski I was quoting him because he's
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:16.960]  quoted in the Bill Joy Wired magazine article specifically warning of these
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:23.120]  issues and I agree I personally have used technology to be able to unseat a
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:26.800]  lot of mainstream media and come from nowhere it'd be much more successful
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.280]  than they are because they didn't know how to use it properly or or didn't
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:37.600]  want to so I totally agree that medicine you name it there's so many great
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:42.880]  things about it but in general looking at a lot of technology what it's doing
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:48.160]  use actually dumbing down the population because they're not using it to
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.200]  become empowered or successful they're using it to just entertain themselves
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:57.080]  and that's actually what the Wired magazine article 16 years ago found that
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.280]  they were already looking at it was that people would just become basically
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.720]  entertainment heads and then what do you do with all these people that don't
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.400]  produce when there's these giant robotic systems that produce for them do we
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:14.080]  become kind of like a fungus that just lives within the machine and become
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:19.640]  vestigial ourselves interesting question I guess and then the question
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:25.800]  becomes well is that is that necessarily a bad thing and the question of whether
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:30.560]  people are a sort of dumb down Stephen B. Johnson did an interesting book a few
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:36.120]  years back called everything bad is good for you and he looked at trends in IQ
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.160]  scores and children's ability to problem-solve and that suggested that
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.200]  children who did a lot of video games actually became better at problem-solving
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:48.280]  because video games in essence consisted of problem-solving tasks after
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:54.000]  problem-solving tasks so that it's not necessarily the case that a lot of
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  entertainment is of itself a bad thing it's more how you direct it and it's
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.080]  more about how you use the the educational system to teach people the
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:09.360]  best ways to work in a connected future so I mean one of the things that I find
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:14.560]  a little disappointing about a lot of schools at the moment is that they don't
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:18.440]  teach children about collaborative working about working across the network
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.720]  about you know having to do things that look beyond just taking an exam where
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:29.320]  you regurgitate what you knew before sure the corporate systems again are have
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:33.800]  been looking for robots all along trying to create biological robots so now they
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:38.800]  don't need the biological robots they can go to real robots but then what will
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:42.280]  happen to their human market as the robots take over but expanding on that
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:45.760]  looking at some of those studies about video games making it smarter that was
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:51.040]  in groups versus other groups that were just watching television but I agree
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:54.480]  with you a collaborative game where you've got to make decisions and new
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:57.720]  things is better for your brain obviously than just sitting there watching
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:01.640]  television all day but I think that's the two sample groups you've got I mean
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:04.680]  obviously moderate video game play is obviously probably good for your brain
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:08.360]  so is doing a lot of different things but I think people that are watching you
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:12.640]  know five hours of TV a day and playing five six hours of video games a day I
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:15.600]  mean I know some of those folks and they don't look too healthy or happy but I
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:20.920]  I get your point so do you have overall an optimistic view about the future
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:28.360]  and about this robot revolution I say overall that I that I generally have
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:32.960]  an optimistic view about our ability to create new job categories that didn't
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:37.520]  exist before so you know if if 10 years ago you had said to someone yeah I'm a
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:41.080]  social media manager they would have given you the blankest the blank looks
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:45.600]  but today that's a job which you know is a valid category you can actually do
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:50.400]  that and and it has it has value to some people and that exists because it's
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:55.400]  built on top of other technology technology platforms that that have you
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:59.400]  know built up in the past 10 years although you could also argue that it's
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:02.160]  just an extension of marketing the marketing's been around since you know
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:07.800]  the 1900s or before in that sense nothing changes so I'm generally optimistic
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:13.920]  about people's ability to find new ways to sort of pass their time
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:17.840]  productively some people don't want to pass the time productively I mean I
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.440]  gotta say I wouldn't recommend watching five hours of TV a day to anyone you
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:28.440]  know that way lies madness of many sorts but in terms of people who who are
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.400]  incentivized to work people who feel that there's that they got more to offer
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:36.240]  the world that the world is more to offer them I think that actually you know
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:41.520]  if if robots take over making McDonald's burgers and fries then actually that
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:44.720]  frees people to do more interesting things where they're interacting with
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:49.240]  other people which is much more fun my problem is it gives a lot of the big
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:52.600]  corporations that approve themselves be predatory and to be grasping for
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:58.080]  governmental power the ability to make humans dependent on their industrial
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:03.560]  combines and removes a lot of the leverage humans have over the equation
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:07.400]  it takes away a lot of grassroots power but obviously then look at what digital
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:12.200]  phones do and cameras for grassroots power for the for the citizen journalists
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:17.120]  so I understand it's a completely and totally double-edged sword you have a
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:21.360]  quote here in your article from the Guardian artificial intelligence quote
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:27.240]  homo sapiens will be split into a handful of gods and the rest of us can
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:32.600]  you break that down more yeah I was putting a guy called Colin Chase who's
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:38.280]  written about this topic a few times and he was saying that the that the
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:44.560]  problem of creating these incredibly clever systems these clever computer
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:48.080]  systems and you know allied with robots become something which fewer and fewer
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.000]  companies can do so you only get a few companies that can do them so you get a
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.480]  sort of celebrity effect where all the money tends to flow towards them it all
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:02.600]  flows up towards one end you get a you know a very skewed curve so that you
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.120]  only have a few companies which can do it and they hire all the people who can
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.840]  do those tasks which means that no one else can get into it so in effect you
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:14.880]  have a self-reinforcing system and that's where he sees the sort of split
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:19.400]  between the gods who are that the companies you can create these systems
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:25.500]  and the rest of us who are in effect using the the fruits of their capital I
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:30.960]  guess rule and labor but equally are reliant on it because we can't do it
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:34.920]  ourselves I mean it's an interesting point of view you know it's his point
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:40.560]  of view and it's to some extent it's a sort of a pessimistic point of view
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:45.600]  it's interesting that last week Google open sourced the code for one of its
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.280]  machine learning systems the thing called tensile flow so that anyone who
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:52.920]  wants to you can build their own machine learning system and that's a very
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:57.160]  democratic move on Google's part it's something which means that you know
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:02.480]  smaller companies can get into this they can try to figure out ways to do it and
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:06.240]  actually the whole machine learning artificial intelligence space is really
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.720]  hot for venture capitalists at the moment there's loads and loads of small
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:14.560]  companies you know even just in London who are being funded like crazy Google
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:18.440]  bought one of them sure it's the ultimate gold rush because it's
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:21.880]  believed that whoever gets it first will be able to take over the world I mean
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:26.040]  just look at what high-frequency trading's done what do you do when they
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.720]  come up with a computer system they can completely game the entire stock market
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:35.200]  it's patented it's owned by one group that is a majorly disruptive technology
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:38.920]  and it looks like the establishments decided to go ahead and just have this
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:43.800]  race and let whoever ends up on top end up on top and who knows what will happen
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:48.840]  during that process and you know let's just hope this AI system doesn't have
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:55.600]  you know some bugs in it that end up you know basically devastating civilization
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.520]  but isn't that the sort of the you know let the biggest one win is not the way
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:04.800]  that capitalism tends to work unless you impose regulation that's the I mean the
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:07.960]  question then becomes how do you regulate the AI system no I hear you
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:13.600]  absolutely I'm a capitalist I'm a capitalist all I'm saying is that
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.120]  doesn't matter if a government takes it over then they'll just be in power I
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:22.440]  mean it's just it's very it's it's a critical crossroads in human development
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:26.360]  obviously moving towards the singularity do you believe we'll actually reach a
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:34.800]  singularity Charles I don't think so in my lifetime I think that I think that's
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:40.120]  a good if it if it can happen if it can happen then it's you know sort of
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:44.640]  merging of the human and the and the computer rather where the computer and
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:49.080]  the human are sort of indistinguishable in terms of their thinking and where
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:54.120]  they merge I think I think that's a very fanciful because I think sure stay
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:56.840]  there final segment where you got five minutes left the other side stay with

[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:09.960]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:13.160]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:17.440]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:21.720]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:25.760]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:30.200]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:34.120]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:38.200]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:43.140]  may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to Fortress

[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:18.680]  situation unfolding in Europe we're also going to get into some of the world
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:23.120]  news economic news financial news at a few minutes left with Charles Arthur
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:29.360]  London Guardian writer technology editor my concern is this it's just like they
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:32.800]  put Trojan horses back doors and the phones that listen to us and that all
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:36.840]  came out and the cars have these black boxes and taxes by the mile and now
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:40.520]  they're gonna start taxing us the big technology companies get together they
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.960]  agree with governments they put the stuff in there before it's even law and
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:49.560]  then they control our lives and the public's already unable to deal with that
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:54.680]  complexity how do we deal with AI computers that'll be so advanced they're
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:59.040]  building the computers and it just seems like a breakaway civilization to me and
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:03.480]  where humans don't become the gods merging with machines as a lot of elites
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.360]  say I mean I put that in my film in game I made eight years ago that's what most
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:10.800]  of them say we're gonna be gods you don't matter if you don't accept the
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:15.720]  computer augmentation you'll just be like a bug to us that's Ray Kurzweil and
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:20.520]  he thinks he's gonna bring his dad back off his notebooks and photos of him so I
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.640]  agree with you that you know this stuff's a lot further off if it's even
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:30.120]  possible but still the delusions of the establishment and their belief in
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:33.960]  technocracy I think is the scariest part so I'm not trying to be pessimistic
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:41.920]  Charles Arthur any other points no I mean I I think Ray Kurzweil has been
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:47.080]  sort of singing this song a long time and I've never really seen any evidence
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.160]  that we're actually getting closer to what what he describes the sort of
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:56.720]  melding of the human and the computer I mean that the thing is more that whenever
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:01.720]  you hear companies saying all these things that that they're going to sort
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:06.280]  of be huge even that the people I think actually the people inside the companies
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:10.040]  and especially the people who write the programs are much more aware of the
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:14.000]  limitations than the people outside I think that it's easy to think that the
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.720]  the programs are incredible and that they they do the most amazing things but
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:21.680]  the people who write the programs are very aware of the limitations and of how
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:26.440]  far they can't go because they know that if you if you try to go beyond a
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:30.200]  certain distance with a program it just it just won't work it just you know it
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.800]  runs up against the limits of where a computer is just a computer and where a
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:38.560]  human has far more capability simply because humans are are adaptable and
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:43.120]  have proven themselves adaptable over millions of years so I yeah and that's
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:47.680]  inside you know I remain optimistic about it you know computers remain tools
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:53.240]  and the the way that people use them and you know the way that governments or
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.320]  or whoever or companies use them is always going to be limited by the
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:00.880]  willingness of otherwise of people actually to sort of indulge them and
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:06.640]  to use the tools themselves so in that sense you know I'm never I'm never
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:10.560]  really pessimistic about it so bad things happen when you know bad people get
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:14.160]  their hands on technology but that doesn't actually mean that there that
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:17.360]  everything about it is gonna be bad well I tend to agree with you that's why
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:20.960]  we're having this debate this discussion to get people thinking about
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:24.960]  knowing how technology works being involved in the decisions being aware

[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:03.120]  because that's your main programming template in North America they're on
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.280]  record with that that was all Pentagon directed you understand you work for

[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:29.200]  totally stupid GI Joe movies and stuff where the White House is attacked the

[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:37.160]  secretary one of the things one of the first things they told me was you're
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:41.200]  not even to acknowledge the drone program you're not even to discuss that it
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:47.560]  exists it's run by chaos it's run by specter special executive for counter
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:52.840]  intelligence terrorism revenge extortion they run little kids they run the

[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:03.920]  paid a visit to the Central Texas Command Center and made the following
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:07.400]  chilling statements concerning free speech and his own site the drudge
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:11.960]  report I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me said
[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:15.320]  Matt it's over for you they've got the votes now to enforce copyright law
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:19.960]  you're out of there well now we have the words of FCC commissioner Ajit Pai he
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:23.560]  said it is conceivable to me to see the government saying we think the drudge
[02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:27.000]  report is having a disproportionate effect on our political discourse Pai
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.240]  told the right online conference back in May of 2015 the FCC doesn't have the
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:34.960]  ability to regulate anything he says and we want to start tamping down on
[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:38.120]  websites like that there are a lot of people who just don't like the fact that
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:41.520]  the internet is a completely unregulated marketplace in terms of freedom of
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:45.080]  speech Pai told the website inside sources and there are some speech that
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:48.080]  people just don't like or they think that it should be regulated because it
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:51.640]  has an outsized effect on public discourse and drudge report is one of

[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:15.680]  meanwhile we have really big threats that will basically affect everybody
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:20.800]  listening drug resistant and drug immune bacteria are becoming rapidly
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:25.040]  resistant everybody knows this but now it's a growth curve it's exponentially
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:31.120]  straight up it has killed many members of my family in the last few years drug
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:38.680]  resistant diseases drug resistant bacteria drug resistant viruses we're
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:42.040]  going to be covering that coming up at the end of this hour it's in the London
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:46.800]  independent hospitals turning to last resort antibiotics as drug resistant
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:51.280]  infections continue to rise and one of these antibiotics will kill the
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:59.320]  bacteria they'll also kill your liver or kill your kidneys so we're entering a
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:03.000]  very very dangerous situation and it'll kill black people it'll kill white
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.680]  people it'll kill Hispanics it'll kill everybody while we're all busy fight
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:11.360]  with each other over what's color our skin is you know what I go to sleep if
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:16.640]  you're not worried about drug resistant infections I love my kids a lot so weird
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:23.160]  feeling not to be afraid to die myself but being afraid for my children but I
[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:29.720]  can't not support life I can't not double down on life as bad as things have
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:36.120]  gotten in this world I'll have more children if I can because that's what
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:41.320]  makes me work harder against this tyranny Jennifer in North Carolina thank
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:45.640]  you for holding you're on the air what is your take on the Paris attack some
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.960]  folks are criticizing me saying I'm not saying it's a totally false flag well I
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:53.360]  mean it's too early to tell but it is a false flag to open up the borders
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:58.600]  advertise freebies bring in people from terrorist areas I mean I mean it is a
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:02.640]  false flag but I mean it just may not be the classically staged one I'm somewhat
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:06.840]  of an expert on this popularizing the term I can tell you but what's your take
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:11.320]  on it Jennifer well you've been forecasting it for some time and it's
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.920]  just happened to be Paris and now this time we can look at what's going to
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.840]  happen here in America and I I was telling the color co-screener going on
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:25.760]  on a limb here but if America doesn't at least consider drafting somebody today
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:30.840]  you I don't think the election is going to be it's going to be irrelevant I mean
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:36.280]  I'm not saying that the the people that are you know debating are irrelevant I
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:40.720]  just think with what you're seeing today and you can forecast where America will
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:45.840]  be in a couple months if we're lucky there won't be any attacks here like
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:51.160]  Paris I mean that's just the reality we face if it can happen in Paris what why
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:56.680]  can't it happen in Los Angeles or New York or a small town in North Carolina
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:03.080]  Greensboro police just issued a gun control issue that if all the people in
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:07.000]  the area bring their guns over they're going to give them a small gift I mean
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.480]  so it's it's happening it's just to disarm Americans
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:17.400]  absolutely Paris this is concerning and I'm listen I do I do radio too so I
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:22.240]  appreciate what you're doing because I started out in new media and I went
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:27.760]  through like the back door to get into radio so to get into an FM channel I
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:32.680]  know what you went through to get to this point but Alex if we were to just
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:37.240]  segue and summarize what's happening and you put put the components of the
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:41.480]  Bible and everything's happened on the world stage we we know we can forecast
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:46.200]  it through the scriptures but just to think that any of us have their wrap
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:49.080]  can wrap our head around what's happening in Paris we could just look at
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:54.360]  what's going on with the border and I just wanted to mention finally is that
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:02.440]  I I read through a governor Bobby Jindal executive order he issued today and if
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:08.920]  I were to draft somebody today somebody would like him and governor Texas
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:13.320]  governor Greg Abbott would be my pick right now sure well both men are
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:21.400]  light years better than Barack Obama or somebody like Marco Rubio or and I
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:26.000]  appreciate your call they're all excellent points I personally happen to
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:32.920]  know that governor Abbott's for real and that the Obama administration is digging
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.600]  through everything they can trying to figure out how to indict him now that's
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:41.280]  kind of gonna be a problem because the judge they used to indict everybody at
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:45.440]  the state level got shot last week and I'm and I'm actually sad to hear that
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:50.240]  happen that's still being investigated but does show a strange world we live
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:56.960]  in just to leave it at that but there's a war going on behind the scenes in this
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:02.840]  country and yes governor Abbott is a good Christian man who really does know
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:08.720]  what's going on and really is trying to protect Texas and trying to stand up
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:11.800]  against Obama and the globalist they're trying to cripple this nation's
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:17.240]  energy infrastructure you name it and he definitely deserves your prayers
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:22.240]  because he is being demonized and attacked and lied about 24-7 I mean
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:27.200]  Rick Perry had great rhetoric but he was not a good guy I mean probably good
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:32.000]  compared to Obama but Rick Perry used to be a Democrat Rick Perry's a politician
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.800]  there you go somebody like Greg Abbott is a statesman like Ron Paul and there is
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.200]  the difference but I'd love to see somebody like Abbott as a senator or as
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:47.360]  it or as a president the Democrats really screwed up making fun of them in a
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:50.520]  wheelchair that's what I found about Democrat leaders they're really really
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:55.160]  nasty people a lot of Democrats at the grassroots are wonderful people it's
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:58.680]  just pretty much the same with the Republican Party as well I want to
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:05.480]  continue with your phone calls right now let's go ahead and talk to Justin in
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:10.160]  Canada you're on the air go ahead hey Alex thanks for taking my call thank you
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.240]  brother okay I got a few I have a few points to go through I'm gonna try and
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:18.160]  make them as short and sweet as possible I'm coming to you from Banff on
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:22.960]  Banff Alberta from where as you know there was a big globalist summit not
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:29.280]  too long ago first point I have to make here I wasn't gonna make this point but
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:33.160]  I have an article that I've kept kept with me for a while about the
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:37.400]  singularity and how close we might be getting to it what do you know about the
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:42.880]  the Google research blog and what's called the deep dream yes Google when
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:48.840]  it was founded 16 years ago said that the plan was to create an artificially
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:54.840]  intelligent master computer and then actually all of us online interfacing
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:58.840]  with the search engine and all its other surveillance platforms is actually
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:05.680]  feeding a computer system through what they call neurons digital neurons to
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:13.480]  create the artificial intelligence is that what you're getting at one point
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:18.600]  yeah yeah that was just one point just because you mentioned it earlier my
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:22.120]  main points I was gonna get at I just wanted to give a shout out to you guys
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:26.120]  you guys and Matt dredge and how inspirational his his appearance on
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:31.120]  your show was that I've always done my own political output and stuff but he
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:35.120]  uh someone about when he came on it just gave me the incentive to go make my own
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:38.240]  stuff and it's been working really well for me so I just want to thank you guys
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:42.480]  for I guess putting that out it just happened to happen that way and it was
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:48.280]  perfect so to move on to the main point with the refugees so Canada's newly
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:52.600]  elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has this plan where he wants to bring a
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:57.240]  thousand refugees into Canada every day every day until the end of the year we
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:03.240]  have to have 25,000 refugees in Canada by the end of the year but liberal and
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:08.440]  handsome so it makes it okay oh yeah the haircut makes it fine all he has to do
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:14.600]  is flash a smile and everyone will just bow down to him because it's 2015 so so
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:19.600]  anyway yeah that's going on you know where it's growing in Canada that
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:22.840]  everybody's politically correct you know that everybody knows and then what's
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:26.200]  he going to do when when one of these people ends up blowing something up
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:29.440]  well we'll just have the media say it's not terrorism great points Justin I
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:33.600]  appreciate your call the bigger question is why do we have to pay for
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:37.840]  everybody that comes to the West there's the argument well our government's
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:41.360]  helping stabilize those countries exactly and they're the same one saying
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:45.200]  bring them here now problem reaction solution the globalists try to run all
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:49.640]  points of the compass they try to opportunistically control and make profits
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:53.480]  off of every angle so I oppose their agenda don't attack Syria don't attack
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:57.800]  Libya don't take their refugees either you want my guns when you turn your guns
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:05.000]  in it's all common sense speaking of Matt Drudge all the great crew from
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:08.120]  jacari Jackson right through Rob do the Darren McBrain you name it make these
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:13.280]  daily news reports that we put into the ads to make the ads informative and
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:17.040]  interesting so they're not really ads there you know they're truly factoids
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:23.440]  but this one is really powerful because it hit me that drudge was here about five
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:27.760]  weeks ago and at dinner told me even more that they are coming after free
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.160]  speech and then to hear the Democrats admitting that that's their plan it's
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:36.480]  bone chilling that this is happening so we air these during some of the breaks
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:39.840]  some stations don't care him but they're during the podcast or live audio
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:44.760]  stream breaks you can hear them and here is Rob do his hot topic dealing with
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:48.880]  five weeks after drudge was here Democrats now admit they want to shut
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:53.640]  him down people go well good you know I don't care he's a big guy they'll be
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:58.480]  able to shut you down too folks appreciate this show appreciate free speech
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:02.880]  here's the piece in early October of this year Matt Drudge paid a visit to the
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:06.320]  Central Texas Command Center and made the following chilling statements
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:10.440]  concerning free speech and his own site the drudge report I had a supreme court
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:13.040]  justice tell me to my face it's over for me
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:16.800]  said Matt it's over for you they've got the votes now to enforce copyright law
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:21.440]  you're out of there well now we have the words of FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai he
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:25.040]  said it is conceivable to me to see the government saying we think the drudge
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:28.440]  report is having a disproportionate effect on our political discourse Pai
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:32.720]  told the right online conference back in May of 2015 the FCC doesn't have the
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:36.480]  ability to regulate anything he says and we want to start tamping down on
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:39.440]  websites like that there are a lot of people who just don't like the fact
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:42.640]  that the internet is a completely unregulated marketplace in terms of
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.040]  freedom of speech Pai told the website inside sources and there are some
[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:49.120]  speech that people just don't like or they think that it should be regulated
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:52.760]  because it has an outsized effect on public discourse and drudge report is
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:57.160]  one of those time is limited rob do reporting for info wars dot com and

[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:29.280]  If you go to drudgereport.com they have the National Enquirer headline
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:36.120]  Charlie Sheen AIDS cover-up Charlie Sheen HIV positive you know I've known
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:41.560]  Charlie Sheen for about 10 years 11 years and I've never seen any of the
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:45.680]  behavior that you hear about in the news and I've stated this house probably it's
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:50.920]  not exaggerate 25 times I know his parents as well I know his brother that's
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:53.880]  how I got to know him actually was through Emilio Estevez I know a lot of
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:58.040]  their Hollywood folks I know that he got a lot wilder over the years so I only
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:01.520]  went over there and visited him a few times I was out in California I guess
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:07.560]  six months ago to give a speech in Newport he invited me up I drove up had
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:15.520]  dinner with him stated his house and I need to give McCall and talk to him
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:21.440]  I've never heard him say that he had HIV or AIDS I've seen before magazines and
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:25.600]  newspapers say it a couple of years ago and then again a few weeks ago but this
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:30.480]  is in the Enquirer and so I'll try to find out but I mean I really don't get
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:35.480]  into gossip stuff I really don't get into all those issues I mean even if I
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:38.480]  talked to him he tells me something privately I'm not gonna pretty much
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:42.440]  relay it but I just knew him because he had the courage to talk about political
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:49.160]  stuff also know that a lot of the so-called AIDS drugs are what actually
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:56.080]  kills you and that much of the disease is a hoax I do know that he did use drugs
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:00.880]  intervenously and so that is where you can get it he never used him in front of
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:04.040]  me and hadn't been on you know obviously I mean back when I first knew he drank
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:06.640]  coffee and smoked cigarettes and exercise all the time and was off
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:11.080]  everything he was married to Denise Richards so pray for Charlie because he
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:15.520]  certainly not perfect but none of us are and he's got a rocky road ahead of him
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:19.440]  with all of this but I'm already getting calls and stuff you're asking my view on
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:25.200]  this and I haven't talked to him in about a month and so I will try to give him a
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:32.920]  call but it is certainly a sad headline whether it's true or not and generally
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:36.920]  the Enquirer is pretty darn accurate and I'm not saying this is accurate but the
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:39.880]  Enquirer when I saw it in other publications for I'm like you know
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:45.200]  let's pull but it still could be a rumor as well so we'll track that as it
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:49.720]  unfolds obviously though the big issue is the world economy's teetering on
[02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:54.440]  collapse terrorists have attacked Europe again there's been a bunch of other
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:59.160]  terror attacks and normally the media covers it up and goes it's not an
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:02.960]  Islamic terror attack at the Army Navy Marine Corps Recruiting Center you're
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:06.520]  a conspiracy theorist look at the Islamophobe Alex Jones well I'm not an
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:10.800]  Islamophobe a terror attacks a terror attack they wouldn't say the Fort Hood
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:18.360]  attack was a terror attack killed 13 people was a 14 people I forget you know
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:23.080]  these are the big issues here and then I get back into drug resistant drug
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:29.080]  immune bacteria and viruses that's bigger than AIDS worldwide right now that
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:33.520]  kills more people infections kill tens of millions every year and it's getting
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.560]  serious folks it's getting to be a problem you know you stub your toe you
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:41.360]  die you go to the hospital to have back surgery a week later you're dead from
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:47.800]  an infection that's the big issue that's what we should be concerned about and
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:52.920]  vaccines are lowering our immunity just type in study vaccines lower immunity
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:28:04.360]  it's known feeding farm animals feeding farm animals antibiotics make some drug
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:09.720]  resistant as well wallied in Paris I should have gone to I didn't even see
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:14.640]  that said Paris I apologize I apologized to wallied I said call me from Paris I
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:17.840]  didn't even look at where you were calling from I apologize John next time
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:21.160]  I get a call from it's not your fault but from outside the country let me know
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:25.200]  especially an exotic call like hurry wallied I apologize for making you
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:28.360]  hold forever and I'll hold you over the next segment if you got good points go
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:35.560]  ahead hey no worries that I'm gonna start by just quoting Paul's Bible saying
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:40.640]  our protection against Satan's attacks is assured only if and when we take up
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:45.880]  the full armor of God Satan schemes are many and he attacks us at any point you
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:50.440]  consider is wonderful thus our armor must be complete we cannot pick and choose
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:55.200]  our armor but rather we must pull all of it on we must be completely equipped or
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:02.720]  we are vulnerable to his attacks and then quickly a second I quote from that
[02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:07.080]  would be from the book of Revelation our duty is not to attack Satan or to
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:11.600]  defeat him but rather to stand his attacks so from that I just want to point
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:16.000]  out that like I've been I lived in France in 2000 back in 2008 that I'm
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:22.480]  living here now again and from there start over you've got a amazing
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:25.360]  connection great points I'm gonna come back to you while lead we're gonna
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:29.040]  apologize I didn't see that that said Paris I got these bright lights in my
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:32.320]  eyes we got to figure out how to turn these lights down and turn the iris up
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:35.840]  because I don't do as good a show under the interrogation lights we ought to
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:38.400]  come in here with a camera and show folks what I'm under I'm gonna come back
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:41.720]  sir give you about two three minutes to give your testimony on what's happening
[02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:45.960]  then we've got a David Knight and jikari popping in to take the rest of your
[02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:52.920]  phone call we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:52.920 --> 02:30:01.400]  GCN radio network an early October of this year Matt drudge paid a visit to
[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:04.960]  the Central Texas Command Center and made the following chilling statements
[02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:09.080]  concerning free speech and his own site the drudge report I had a Supreme Court
[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:13.480]  justice tell me to my face it's over for me that Matt it's over for you they've
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:17.000]  got the votes now to enforce copyright law you're out of there well now we have
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:21.960]  the words of FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai he said it is conceivable to me to see
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:25.320]  the government saying we think the drudge report is having a disproportionate
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:29.000]  effect on our political discourse Pai told the right online conference back in
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.880]  May of 2015 the FCC doesn't have the ability to regulate anything he says
[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:36.680]  and we want to start tamping down on websites like that there are a lot of

[02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:12.320]  lead in Paris to to to recap what he was saying being in Paris in his take on
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:17.160]  the situation then we'll go to Jim and others with the other house that are
[02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:22.840]  with us so go ahead wallied and finish your story okay so hi jacarri and hi
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:28.160]  David the big fan of you two guys God bless you so what I was saying before
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:31.840]  basically I'm just gonna summarize those two quotes from Paul's Bible and the
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:37.280]  book of Revelation basically summarized by saying that our duty is to with with
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:43.440]  span the attacks of Satan with the full armor of God now when when the Bible
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:49.000]  says the attacks of Satan attack the attacks are on whom who are we talking
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:54.440]  about here what do you think Alex well we're talking about attacks on
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:35:01.760]  Christians well so so that there's a small disagreement there but yes
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:06.640]  Christians and what I would with I would I also say that the believers people
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:12.280]  that people that believe in the God of Abraham exactly so that that makes the
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:16.720]  Jewish the Christian and the Muslims there those are three religion Abrahamic
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:19.840]  religions that's right and Albert Pike said that they were gonna have a third
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:23.520]  world war to play Christians Jews and Muslims off against each other and
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:27.800]  Penech says that's their plan is to play the West or what's left of Christendom
[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:32.640]  off against the Muslims and that's happening well classic civilizations
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:36.520]  there you go so so basically the main point that I'm what I want that I want to
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:40.240]  make here since I'm living in France and I've lived here back in 2008 from
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:44.800]  actually like following up the culture the culture change that is going on is
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:48.400]  that when when the Bible says that we need to protect ourselves from the
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:53.480]  attacks of Satan we as believers with full armor when you when if you come here
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:57.880]  and you look at the French people especially like the generation the
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:03.040]  new generation if you want to look if you want to find a nation of sheep
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:08.800]  welcome to Paris so you've been in New York City remember when you went to the
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:12.520]  CNN thing and everything and you saw like how how it's different from Austin
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:17.480]  and you could feel that the culture of sheep being there well it's exactly the
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:23.240]  same in Paris and it's even worse because if you look at the the the way
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:27.840]  people behave like what they buy here they French people most of them I'm
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:32.320]  not speaking about the whole French nation there are many good Republicans
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:38.040]  and nationalists here basically that still believe in Napoleon's visions and
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:42.240]  Charles de Gaulle's vision but the most most of the population here is basically
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:48.240]  spending their time in malls shopping buying American made stuff Apple products
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:52.760]  as other products are mindless dumb down consumers we see that here in the
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:57.360]  United States it's very very frightening and and so what are you saying in the
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:02.320]  final equation about all this what I'm saying that they've chosen to pick the
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:06.920]  the American products like Apple and others and pharmaceuticals especially and
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:11.480]  other stuff but if you talk to them about the Second Amendment they would
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:16.480]  freak out they would say never this is not part of our culture however they
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:19.920]  choose to pick everything else from the American culture that is trendy and
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:23.400]  modern but this is would be like a huge thing for them and that would be
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:28.760]  radical for them so just linking that to the Bible what the Bible says when
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:32.760]  when the Bible says that we need to protect ourselves with the full armor
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:37.040]  of God and we see a nation of sheep here that is being attacked they got that
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:44.160]  the three guys that killed 149 people injured 300 had 15 minutes and they
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:50.520]  reloaded three times three guys killed 149 people in 15 minutes just imagine
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:55.760]  that if one guy amongst the four 149 people had arms on him it would have
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:59.720]  been completely different so waiting 15 minutes for the security of the police
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:04.760]  to come in and and there we go so basically we're talking about a
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:08.520]  domesticated population it's very very sad great great points I appreciate your
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:12.360]  call and that's a good place to start Jacari and David obviously Donald
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:17.280]  Trump has said arm the people in France arm everywhere this will stop well the
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:20.880]  head of Interpol said that too a couple years ago with the Kenya attacks I've
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:27.240]  actually started some of that in Kenya so there are these groups deep I know
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:30.560]  David got some evidence pointing towards false flag go ahead yeah let me say
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:33.680]  about the pushback that I've seen against what Donald Trump said because we
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:36.480]  said that sort of thing all the time and we pointed that out many times and say
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:41.040]  well you know what good would one person with a pistol do against guys with a k
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:45.440]  47 we don't have to theorize about that I've interviewed the guy that was in
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:48.800]  South Africa when they went in to shoot up that church they came in I think it
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:52.880]  was a half dozen guys with a k 47s they they threw grenades in and then started
[02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:57.760]  spraying the crowd with a k 47s and he was all the way across the church up in
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:02.520]  the balcony and he had a pistol with five shots in it well and he took one
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:05.240]  she took a couple of shots you know I'm not gonna hit anything from this angle
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:09.680]  he didn't know it but he'd hit somebody and then he went around the outside and
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:14.640]  back around because he wanted to get a closer better range to them and he got
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:17.280]  another guy there and so they they fled at that point they thought they were
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:19.360]  being encircled they thought there were multiple people and they said
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:22.760]  afterwards when they had the truth and reconciliation meetings after South
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:27.640]  Africa's government government changed they said we went there to kill
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:30.640]  everybody we were gonna kill all thousand people that were there we had
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:33.760]  enough equipment you know guns and bombs us or they they were gonna kill
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:36.480]  everybody in that church and they went to that church because they knew it was a
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:41.480]  mainstream liberal church and nobody would be armed precise and that's a
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:47.040]  famous case give folks the name of the case that was his name is Charles fun
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:55.880]  Vic it's C-H-A-R-Y-L-V-A-N I think the book is one man and a gun or a firing
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:59.360]  bag or something I know we're teleprompter free we go off I'm trying to
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:02.280]  remember what the name of the book is I remember him because we talked yeah but
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:05.000]  we'll pull it up and tell folks you've done a bunch of reports on that they're
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  excellent but false flag jacari and then David for me whether it was staged or
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:14.200]  not they open the borders they advertised it they brought folks in with
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:18.880]  fake passports what do they expect well just like you said you know if you don't
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:22.280]  have any type of check and balance just like we've seen the reports kit did the
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:25.800]  hot topic on it today that people want to come here to the United States of
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:28.920]  course we welcome people who want to come through a legal process but when you
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:32.560]  have such a large amount of people that want to enter the country no tens of
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:36.600]  thousands of people how do you vet all of these people especially as the the
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.240]  gentleman said in the piece well we don't really have a process to vet these
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:42.560]  people you know if they've never committed a crime it doesn't mean that
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:46.440]  they're not somehow radicalized it's just they have not popped up on our radar
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:50.280]  screen yet so how do you screen that many people if you just and it turns out
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:53.840]  these guys one of them been arrested the others had warrants out they knew they
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:58.640]  were yes we'll just think about it Alex I think it's about what is it five
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:01.880]  million people that they say have come in now this wave of migrants come in
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:06.080]  okay let's say that 99% of these people are not violent they're not radical
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:10.760]  they're not jihadis only 1% let's say that's still 50,000 people that's an
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:15.440]  army fraction of a yeah exactly if it was a fraction of 1% it was folks don't
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:19.240]  know in unconventional asymmetrical warfare which is terrorism basically in
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:24.600]  my view both ways whether governments do it or individuals 50,000 people with
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:30.520]  commando training can shut down whole countries I mean with five guys I could
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:34.520]  shut down Austin you know just knowing what I've read in books and these people
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:38.840]  are being given terrorist training you imagine 50,000 motivated people oh yeah
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:42.200]  yeah it's like we've seen the shootings that happened here in Texas whether it's
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:47.240]  here in Austin last year or this past year in in Dallas me and bigs went up
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:51.440]  there you know one guy a highly motivated guy you know had equipment you
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:54.400]  know went out there and waged war against the police you know they eventually
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:58.160]  stopped them but just like you said one guy pretty much shut down a city and
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:02.280]  when you have multiple people who may even have trained in additional skills
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:06.040]  you know they can definitely do a lot of damage look at the UT tower shooter
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:10.720]  yes mm-hmm you know that's one Marine who's got a giant brain tumor but see
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:14.160]  that's one guy with a brain tumor not 50,000 and I think that's a conservative
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:17.500]  number so many of these as you know Jacare and David they admit are the
[02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:21.600]  ISIS forces that have been beaten and they're allowing them to retreat into
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:26.880]  Turkey and get their retirement of being brought in as European citizens so when
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:29.600]  you're talking about false flags Alex I mean there's a lot of different ways
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:33.520]  things that we refer to as false flags let's say the Gulf of Tonkin incident
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:36.600]  for example that Robert McNamara admitted before he died nothing had
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:39.680]  happened it was a completely false narrative is a complete hoax but they
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:43.040]  used it to start a war to start an agenda to sell their agenda or you could
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:46.680]  have something like the beginning of World War two where there's a lot of
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:51.560]  intelligence reports I believe that yeah they knew exactly and we've had
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:56.520]  whistleblowers NSA whistleblowers like Thomas Drake said essentially the same
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:59.360]  thing with about 9-11 from his perspective within the NSA they were
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:01.800]  getting all this intel when they would take it to people that say don't look
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:05.360]  at domestic terrorists we don't want to look at that go look at something else
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:09.080]  okay so you can have that kind of a situation where you know the Japanese
[02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:12.480]  really did attack Pearl Harbor that wasn't fake they really did but could
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:16.000]  they have stopped it could they did they know about it and allow it to happen
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.240]  and tell people don't look at that look in the other direction okay so you got
[02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:22.160]  that kind of false flag and then of course you got the obvious false flag
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:25.240]  like the Reichstag fire where they blame it on somebody else that you know
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:28.280]  something that they did themselves and they blame it on somebody else so
[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:32.240]  there's all these different spectrums of false flags certainly they knew about
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:36.360]  these guys they have created this situation and now they are milking this
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:41.400]  situation we've got Federica Mogherini she's the EU's chief diplomat now this
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:45.280]  conference that they had that started the day after the attacks on Friday on
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:49.440]  Saturday the 14th they had already set up a conference in Vienna for all of these
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:52.920]  heads of state to talk about what they're going to do about Syria okay when
[02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:55.800]  she already had the conference set up and I had the conference set up and run
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:43:59.520]  it yeah and the CIA had met with the French intelligence the day of the
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:03.800]  event before it happened exactly exactly and so what she's saying is she says
[02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:08.520]  let me underline the profile she said this today at about 3 p.m. their time
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:13.040]  this is reported by the UK Telegraph on their blog she said let me underline the
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:18.120]  profile the terrorists so far identified tells us this is an internal threat all
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:22.280]  EU citizens so far and they say her comments may be part of a preemptive
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:26.080]  effort to help defend Shenzhen in the coming weeks and of course that's the
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:30.560]  the Shenzhen zone is what they agreed to when they took down all the internal
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:33.740]  border controls passing from one country to the other so that's the external
[02:44:33.740 --> 02:44:36.720]  border yeah yeah the internal the internal border so that you can go from
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:41.920]  say France to you know an adjourn joining company country same as if you're
[02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:44.920]  going to go from Texas to Oklahoma or something like that you don't have to
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:47.920]  pass they're getting rid of their internal borders exactly and they're talking
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:51.240]  about maybe we need to bring that back to Kari what do you make of the refugee
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:54.840]  situation I know you had some articles on that here in America wanting to bring
[02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:58.440]  them in yeah well when we always go down to the border we've talked to the ice
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:01.760]  agents we talked to the border patrol agents and they say you know like we
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:05.280]  always say are there good people come through these borders absolutely there
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:08.880]  are but with the bad people how do you vet these people you know because a lot
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:12.480]  of them even to talk about some more domestic issues you know people come in
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:16.800]  through gangs like MS-13 like how do you know the MS-13 that all tatted up when
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:20.240]  they go through the border crossing they interact with the border patrol so you
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:24.280]  know you have situations like this and it's very sad that you do have people
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:26.960]  want to come here through a legal process but you also have the bad people
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:30.280]  so how are we going to vet these people you know thus far even the United
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:33.720]  States government the top advisors in Washington they're telling Obama we do
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:37.600]  not have a way to make your plan work and so what's gonna happen when tens of
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:39.920]  thousands and that's only the first round they admitted they want to go up to
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:44.280]  300,000 come in and then somebody attacks a school or an army recruiting
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:48.760]  station is the media just gonna cover it up again I don't know it seems like it's
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:52.560]  an issue that they don't really want to address you know like we always keep
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:56.000]  saying you know yes there are people good people out there but how do you
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:59.380]  vet these people just saying that they're good does not really vet the
[02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:02.680]  process when I flew in a couple months ago from Italy doing those reports they
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:06.400]  called me into the back room and started searching my stuff and I kind of
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:09.480]  threw a fit and the head guy came in and said yeah yeah you're not smuggling
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:14.160]  anything you can go but but and I wasn't mad that they were searching my bag
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:18.360]  it's that they knew who I was I had no criminal record I answered their
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:23.440]  questions they were messing with me when I was watching people that I knew had no
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:25.920]  business coming to this country just sailing past
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:29.160]  well even when we go to the airports every time we go last time I went out
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:33.080]  with with Michael our camera guy they pull us over they check both our bags
[02:46:33.080 --> 02:46:36.080]  you know they they pack it down at the airport kid actually missed his plane
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:39.640]  trying to get out there but the plane got stuck you know we didn't get it but
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:42.920]  the TSA admits they let illegal aliens fly yeah and I'm not against the
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:47.000]  illegal aliens but man can I at least have the rights they got basically yeah
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.120]  I mean you know they let the Muslim Brotherhood just walk through you all
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:52.760]  willy-nilly and they don't have to get that down because I want to give us the
[02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:56.800]  third degree yeah that's what I'm sick of it's discriminatory against American
[02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:00.040]  citizens and it's wrong I want to take some phone calls and get your analysis
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:03.360]  as well let's talk to Jim in Canada you're on the air with Jakari Jackson
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:08.200]  David Knight and Alex Jones go ahead thanks for holding Jim yeah I'm on
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:12.160]  speakerphone can you hear me good yeah I hear you pretty good go ahead okay
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.040]  thanks for all you guys do man it's great it's great to have something to
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:20.080]  listen to and something to rather don't thank us we're in this together we love
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:26.800]  you too okay hey I heard a fellow Albertan on he's in BAMF and I'm in
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:32.920]  Calgary gosh BAMF is pretty close what are the odds yeah what are the odds last
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:40.640]  game how about black lives matter is ISIS how would the left like something
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:44.840]  like that and if well I'm gonna tell you the same people funding the white
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:48.920]  supremacist in Ukraine are the same ones funding ISIS are the same ones
[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:52.440]  manipulating black lives matter it's George Soros and the globalist that is
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:57.920]  a fact and they're there to create Balkanization yeah well when they
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:04.560]  discredit Tea Party why don't they they're calling us domestic terrorists
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:08.760]  why aren't these people domestic terrorists because the kids just want to
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:13.560]  go to school and learn some of the leftist garbage but they just want to
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:17.840]  learn and they're getting you know manipulated into walking with these
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:22.080]  other people and sure and there's real issues with the police and stuff too the
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:26.000]  thing is they're being siphoned off into a radical malice ideology that's what
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.840]  this is I've had the professors on that have gone through the Rockefeller
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:32.680]  Foundation training this is malice brainwashing all this leftist stuff
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:38.680]  jacari your take because you were up there with kid just last week in in
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:41.560]  Missouri or I was sent you to Europe as well but this is your turn to stay
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:45.280]  behind and you were there you witnessed it obviously as you said some legitimate
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:50.920]  issues but now to have some of the main black lives matter groups complaining
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:56.040]  that Paris is taking attention away I mean this just sounds crazy these people
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:49:00.640]  have no idea about the optics well it's a it's a rather selfish statement to make
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:04.800]  and Leanne made a very good point off camera I was talking to her she's saying
[02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:07.640]  that last week you know they were threatening people they're shoving
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:11.360]  people around because they dare come in with a camera and now the cameras have
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:16.080]  shifted from the group to the shooting of Paris now they're like oh we want you
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:19.000]  guys come look at you last week he says leave you alone you guys gonna handle
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.280]  your own business and now you're getting all mad and f-paras and all this other
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:25.800]  stuff because people want to look at a different story and yes there's no you
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:29.440]  know hierarchy you know there are issues with police other domestic issues but
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:32.560]  there are also issues going on in Paris and people see those and they say we
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:36.480]  don't want those to come here so let's do something to address this issue now
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:42.000]  yeah Alex this climate change summit that's coming up and let's I want to
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.640]  focus on that I'm glad you bring that up because this is how they're going to
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:47.160]  spend the whole thing right now everybody you know they're coming out
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:49.760]  with their candlelight vigils and saying we need to come together we need to come
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:54.160]  together they're gonna offer the Paris Climate Accord as a chance for us to all
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:57.760]  come together with the new corn that will go after extremists even saying it
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:02.160]  exactly that's it for the dead exactly we've got to and that is stage it we've
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:05.280]  got open borders and a clash of civilizations that they're creating
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:08.680]  here in order to take down Western civilization at the same time they're
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:11.280]  creating two structures for world government one of them is based on
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:14.840]  economics and trade for the right wing the other one is based on saving the
[02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:18.520]  environment for the left wing either one of these organizations can be used to
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:21.800]  create a new world government they will have the capability of taxing and
[02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:26.000]  regulating they will have worldwide courts and regulatory agencies to impose
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.720]  on people they can finish the selective destruction of economies and cultures
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:33.480]  with these organizations but it will also provide them for a structure to have
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:40.680]  a new world government and let's be clear this is happening now we're not
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:44.280]  just saying world government's coming they're admitting it thank you Jim

[02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:06.560]  David Knight you were pointing out who this minister is who they put in charge
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:12.080]  of EU security literally no background plucked out of obscurity out of
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:16.880]  nowhere exactly that's the phrase that the telegraph in the UK pointed out when
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:22.160]  she was put in this position back in August of 2014 they said to get a glimpse
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:26.200]  of the backroom trading that typifies EU appointment say she's lacking
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:30.480]  experience she's 41 years old at that time she's been named the EU's foreign
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:34.080]  policy chief only seven months after she was plucked from parliamentary
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:38.600]  obscurity in Rome and named the foreign minister of Italy so here she is she's a
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:44.720]  totally obscure a parliamentary parliamentarian in Italy they put her in
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:47.880]  this position for no apparent reason and then seven months later she's put in
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:51.320]  charge of foreign policy at the EU and she's making all these pronouncements
[02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:55.200]  about how we have to fight this together we have to come together this is a
[02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:59.800]  global response as needed to control terrorism no single country can do this
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:03.920]  it has to be done globally every problem that they create and of course we know
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:07.280]  that they've created ISIS every problem that they create has to be addressed by
[02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:11.240]  global governance and she's probably also gonna say leaving your door open at
[02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:15.560]  night will stop robberies yeah exactly yeah I was very surprising to see her
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:19.560]  saying in spite of what other people are saying that all of these people are EU
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:23.280]  citizens and so this is an internal problem and not a border problem what
[02:57:23.280 --> 02:57:26.160]  she's saying is none of these people are refugees even though it's been
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:28.840]  confirmed to be the case yeah she's lying to people yeah sorry
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:32.760]  exactly just like he said they're lying to people they don't want people to put
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:35.560]  two and two together because they keep saying you know you're racist you're
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:38.840]  bigot you're all this you know you have borders for a reason if I go to Mexico
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:41.600]  there's a border there if I go to Canada there's a border there you have
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:44.920]  borders for a reason and of course you can bring people in but you don't want
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:49.280]  to just drop ten thousands at a time how far can it go jacarie how far can these
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:53.400]  crazy they're gonna push it as far as it can go they're gonna keep pushing it you
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:57.240]  know and until it breaks or it's already broken because we see all these
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:58:00.440]  attacks happening but they want and that's it there's no accountability for
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:04.400]  politicians now yeah that's right they can do anything they want you know it
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:07.640]  always interests me no kids you think back in the days where you had Nixon and
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:11.120]  LBJ you know people go out in the streets and you know they shake the bars at
[02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:14.800]  the White House people don't really do that anymore it's like oh well so and so
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:18.320]  did something that's worse so the fault of this is we become so passive and
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:23.640]  because they let them move it into a racism sexism mode okay to deflect any
[02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:28.880]  criticism of the government exactly you get demonized as bad if you anything
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:31.800]  you're against Obamacare you're against turning your guns in they turn it into
[02:58:31.800 --> 02:58:35.240]  that whole politically correct mode that's what's killing us we're gonna

[03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:26.880]  on the air from pennsylvania thanks for holding hello alex welcome I was I was
[03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:32.400]  going to say since they want these elective poor refugees in like mcdonald
[03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:37.800]  John Kerry why don't we just put them all on their front lawns they like to
[03:00:37.800 --> 03:00:42.760]  tear it so much why don't they support them put them on their front lawns put
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:47.760]  them you actually have a total cowards instinct by Madonna and others just to
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:51.440]  capitulate to things they're scared of because they are public figures they
[03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:55.160]  don't want to be attacked I mean we've had ice just actually threatened us put
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:57.800]  Joe in their videos and won their video yeah I mean I mean they've they've
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:01:02.000]  threatened us because we don't like them I mean so what I can drive out there and
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.360]  down a car wreck today I'm not gonna live in fear of these people what about you
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:08.400]  jacarjax oh absolutely not you know they're they're doing these these hit
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:11.440]  and run tactics because I always talk to people when I talk about you know
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:14.640]  open-carriage things of that nature and it's like well I'm not expecting to be
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:17.720]  attacked today you think the people in Paris you know going to a concert going
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:21.520]  to a soccer game expected somebody to come in there and and attack them no
[03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:25.440]  that's why you have a right to defend yourself and you shouldn't live in fear
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:28.440]  of these people just because they may someday come to attack you sure and we're
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:31.640]  not inviting and we trust in God but I'll assure you we're not a french
[03:01:31.640 --> 03:01:38.120]  theater or at this office this is a hard target very hard target yeah absolutely
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:41.840]  well what I'm worried about is what's coming up with this climate change
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:46.160]  situation I mean we've got the TPP and Alex the way I look at this they have a
[03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:50.560]  max of 45 days after this thing was made public to come to a vote on it but they
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:53.880]  don't have to take 45 days they can bring this thing up for a vote during the
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:56.720]  Christmas holidays which is what they like to do they always reserve act and
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:00.760]  all these yeah the NDA and yeah so yeah I'm concerned that we're gonna get a
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:08.520]  really one real whammy in December of these two global organizations a treaty
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:12.800]  for trade a treaty for a climate and they're gonna sell these to the left and
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:17.080]  the right and both of them have inherent in these treaties a transnational
[03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:20.400]  governance structure that will allow them to control us without any further
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:24.760]  input once they're enacted. World governments here it's an epic time
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:28.760]  it's also a time where our credibility is rising very fast and Putin's come out
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:32.200]  and said it's all a global government fraud the carbon tax good things are
[03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:35.840]  happening I just can't believe if you told me 20 years ago I'd be on air and
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:39.240]  the Russian president would be fighting world government and fighting carbon
[03:02:39.240 --> 03:02:43.280]  taxes I would say you're crazy it just shows how stuff is upside down thank you
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:46.640]  Charlene let's jam in one more and if Jacarie has time he'll get to these
[03:02:46.640 --> 03:02:51.600]  others Paul in New Mexico thanks for holding her on the air yeah I just
[03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:55.520]  want to say I agree with you Alex I think it's not a classical false flag but
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:02:59.240]  it's an open the doors false flag you know how in the first hour Watson reported
[03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:02.680]  that the security wasn't real high I think that's bizarre by the design the
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:07.000]  security is slack and you know lacking in effectiveness by design so that you
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:11.760]  know the operas that can attack what's left of humanity's free speech and leach
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:16.560]  away and breach humanity and the EU police and the French police
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:20.040]  had arrested one of these guys before so they were even doing their jobs they
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:25.160]  were ordered to let him go yeah you know the system uses these tragedies and
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:30.240]  lockdowns in our homes and they're going to transit transition that into mental
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:34.000]  lockdowns of our brains you know so we can't think anymore we can't reason
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:39.760]  anymore we can't be happy anymore so we'll just be well physically not mentally
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:43.160]  locked down you know we'll be both mentally and physically locked down and
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:47.200]  I'm glad to end with this you're very eloquent please call back again we
[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:50.720]  have more time I'm always amazed how smart these callers are smarter than I am
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:52.920]  the points they make that's why I'm gonna try to make myself take more calls
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:56.080]  because it's just just incredibly smart people especially when I actually go to

[03:04:01.240 --> 03:04:04.840]  that's it don't be afraid folks you got a better chance of a honeybee stinging

[03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:56.720]  all right two inches so Leanne McAdoo that's what she has going on all right
[03:09:56.720 --> 03:09:59.840]  Leanne you got some articles you want to tell us about some hot topics going on
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:03.960]  in the world today well I know a lot of people were really excited with the
[03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:08.840]  release of fallout 4 and the video game exactly and so I just kind of wanted to
[03:10:08.840 --> 03:10:13.760]  talk about you know the new nuclear preparedness propaganda so obviously
[03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:18.080]  nuclear preparedness this propaganda was really popular like in the 50s all
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:23.600]  the way up until the 80s they put these cartoons out yeah exactly they had a
[03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:27.120]  whole thing in schools you know go under the desk and all that well now
[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:32.480]  they're they're doing it in via video games and so which actually you know I
[03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:36.280]  don't even see this as a problem this is probably one of them one of the times
[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:41.280]  I'll actually advocate for playing video games because the makers of fallout 4
[03:10:41.280 --> 03:10:45.800]  they actually commissioned research to make sure that these video games were
[03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:50.560]  as accurate as possible and so obviously people don't know the premise of fallout
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:56.400]  4 it's basically a post nuclear war game where it's a first-person I guess point
[03:10:56.400 --> 03:11:00.040]  of view and the player you assume the role of survivor and you're just trying
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:04.000]  to survive and basically everyone who's in the game the only people who survive
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:09.040]  are people who were in a fallout shelter well what I thought was pretty
[03:11:09.040 --> 03:11:13.840]  interesting is that the American Chemical Society has now released another
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:18.880]  video saying how can you really survive a nuclear fallout so obviously the
[03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:22.440]  video game is going to be a little bit you know it's not going to be entirely
[03:11:22.440 --> 03:11:27.840]  accurate but they've released a really informative video that I think everyone
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:33.160]  should watch I think we have it there we can roll it as b-roll how to survive a
[03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:36.520]  nuclear fallout and they reveal the basics of living in a world riddled
[03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:39.840]  with radiation and the very simple way to tell if you've been exposed to
[03:11:39.840 --> 03:11:45.040]  radiation so I know we have a lot of viewers and listeners who are really
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:48.880]  into this preparedness survival preparedness and just making sure that
[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:53.720]  they are prepared for whatever could be coming their way you know it's funny
[03:11:53.720 --> 03:11:58.000]  because every year they're ridiculed these survivalists and
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:01.680]  things like that they're ridiculed for doing this but it's like so important
[03:12:01.680 --> 03:12:04.880]  it's so well you know the government's digging in they have all types of
[03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:07.920]  survival supplies they're buying the I don't know what you call them the
[03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:11.440]  tablets to take if you have some type of radiation poisoning of course they're
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:15.000]  buying bullets you know by the truckload and all this and that but if you
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:19.560]  dare have some means of being self-prepared they're going to attack
[03:12:19.560 --> 03:12:24.320]  you and demonize you and also we have information on that as well as if you
[03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:28.520]  look at Joel Scalzen you know he does the strategic relocation he can tell you
[03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:32.120]  guys all about that but as you are talking about the video games then you
[03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:35.760]  know I know sometimes we reference these things whether they're in movies or
[03:12:35.760 --> 03:12:39.480]  video games or you know any other type of entertainment and it's not always bad
[03:12:39.480 --> 03:12:42.800]  when we talk about meals sometimes there is just some blatant horrible stuff
[03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:45.440]  that's going on but other times you know it's just something that's
[03:12:45.440 --> 03:12:49.160]  interesting interesting another video game is out right now is Metal Gear Solid
[03:12:49.160 --> 03:12:55.240]  and this thing my experience of Metal Gear Solid I was like a 12 year old boy
[03:12:55.240 --> 03:12:58.800]  I was playing the video game and that was the first time I actually heard about DARPA
[03:12:58.800 --> 03:13:01.240]  and at the time I just thought it was something that they made up for the
[03:13:01.240 --> 03:13:04.680]  video game and then later on they have things in the series like walking
[03:13:04.680 --> 03:13:07.640]  tanks and all that and this is stuff they had you know I guess back in the
[03:13:07.640 --> 03:13:11.400]  90s or whenever the game came out and it just blows my mind how far in advance
[03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:14.880]  these guys they get the inside scoop however they get it they actually put
[03:13:14.880 --> 03:13:17.520]  that into the games and it's not necessarily you know propaganda it's
[03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:20.560]  just something that they're just putting out there to tell you that this is
[03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:25.160]  like some real real world thing so before we move on to our calls let's go
[03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:29.080]  to maybe one or two more your topics here well I just think it's it's important
[03:13:29.080 --> 03:13:32.600]  to for people to view this or to take something like this seriously considering
[03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:37.040]  how we have experts saying nuclear war is imminent within the next 20 years
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:41.480]  obviously we have everything going on with Iran there is a real threat they're
[03:13:41.480 --> 03:13:47.320]  saying nuclear war between India and Pakistan North Korea prepping for nuclear
[03:13:47.320 --> 03:13:51.120]  war they've already got at least 10 nuclear warheads and they're working on
[03:13:51.120 --> 03:13:55.140]  one that can hit the west coast of the United States and of course we had the
[03:13:55.140 --> 03:14:01.120]  Navy launching their tests off the coast of California at the most highly
[03:14:01.120 --> 03:14:05.480]  visible time of the evening where it would get the most press so you know I
[03:14:05.480 --> 03:14:10.280]  just think this this is something people should start taking seriously you know
[03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:14.680]  and not allow people to make you feel foolish because you are being prepared
[03:14:14.680 --> 03:14:19.240]  yes absolutely all right now let's go on to our callers I'm trying to clear the
[03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:22.960]  decks here before we move on to our other topics let's go on to John in
[03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:26.200]  South Carolina go ahead John
[03:14:26.200 --> 03:14:33.480]  Hey Mr. Jackson how are you? Very well yourself. Not too bad considering.
[03:14:33.480 --> 03:14:38.400]  All right what's on your mind? I just want to run through some points real quick and I'd like
[03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:49.840]  permission after I get done with this if I may pray sure okay I think I'm a
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:54.400]  veteran I'm 27 and I got out of the army because I was called to preach and
[03:14:54.400 --> 03:14:59.480]  one thing I can't help but to notice is like the secularization of Western
[03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:06.240]  society I think we are we've sort of we've sort of set ourselves up for
[03:15:06.240 --> 03:15:12.320]  judgment against God I think radical Islam is great national security threat
[03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:16.020]  but I think when if you're a Bible-believing Christian and you read
[03:15:16.020 --> 03:15:20.480]  scripture you also have to look at God as being one of your greatest national
[03:15:20.480 --> 03:15:26.120]  security assets or threats sort of like Babylon I mean God didn't think Babylon
[03:15:26.120 --> 03:15:32.840]  was good but God used Babylon to judge Israel so in the same sense I sort of see
[03:15:32.840 --> 03:15:39.520]  God using Islam to bring judgment upon the Western world and our secularization
[03:15:39.520 --> 03:15:43.920]  of kicking him out of everything so I mean it doesn't matter how big your
[03:15:43.920 --> 03:15:48.440]  military is you know I mean if God's not on your side I mean you're just you're
[03:15:48.440 --> 03:15:52.360]  not gonna come out on the winning end or as you can have a very small military
[03:15:52.360 --> 03:15:57.240]  but if you God's on your side I mean you're gonna prevail you know a minority
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:16:00.960]  as a majority with God well that's exactly what the Pope came out and said
[03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:03.960]  just you know following these Paris attacks he said people need to be
[03:16:03.960 --> 03:16:07.880]  preparing for the end of the world not saying that it is the end of the world
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:14.400]  but be prepared and get right with God so all right let's go ahead and give us
[03:16:14.400 --> 03:16:22.960]  your prayer if you would sure yeah can we bow our heads sure and mighty father
[03:16:22.960 --> 03:16:26.960]  creator of all existence I just I want to thank you for info wars I want to thank
[03:16:26.960 --> 03:16:32.520]  you for the info wars staff and team and all of the hard work and dedication to
[03:16:32.520 --> 03:16:39.080]  putting truth out and trying to open up eyes and not eat not ever I've never
[03:16:39.080 --> 03:16:44.600]  heard them once deny you as Lord once on air and I just pray that you would
[03:16:44.600 --> 03:16:49.440]  work through them as vessels and tools and bring this country and Western
[03:16:49.440 --> 03:16:54.480]  civilization to repentance and open up our eyes and just bring us back to you
[03:16:54.480 --> 03:16:59.120]  so that we can be prosperous once again to be that light on top of the hill
[03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:03.960]  shining to the world showing the world what a good civilization and what a
[03:17:03.960 --> 03:17:10.280]  moral people at when we come together can and should look like and please
[03:17:10.280 --> 03:17:15.760]  forgive us of our sins and just help us to repent as a nation and if it's not a
[03:17:15.760 --> 03:17:20.120]  sweeping tide like a Billy Graham Revival Revival I just hope it's a rising tide
[03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:26.280]  of your people living out holy lives and their everyday lives and working at
[03:17:26.280 --> 03:17:32.640]  their car dealerships or grocery stores or offices and letting others see you
[03:17:32.640 --> 03:17:36.360]  through them and we thank you for your sacrifice for us we thank you for your

[03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:50.320]  we're going to move on to Noelle in Virginia go ahead Noelle hey good
[03:17:50.320 --> 03:17:54.760]  afternoon there's an excellent show well I'm gonna talk to I'm gonna make two
[03:17:54.760 --> 03:18:00.560]  points here the number one point was the attack in France right so on Friday it
[03:18:00.560 --> 03:18:05.560]  was the 13th to the 13th represents Bamalong system well what caught my eye
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:10.480]  too was number six it was six location so number six represents the sixth
[03:18:10.480 --> 03:18:15.880]  chapter of Genesis okay and if you read that then you get a better picture this
[03:18:15.880 --> 03:18:22.000]  was a another sacrifice to their God but it's a sacrifice to who to a lot of
[03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:28.560]  their God no to their God you see the number six represents sons of God what's
[03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:35.760]  above is below okay so they sacrificed this to their God Malak he's just like
[03:18:35.760 --> 03:18:41.760]  you know when you do abortions you're actually putting the kids into his you
[03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:48.200]  know yeah well I guess I heard that there was actually another holy day or
[03:18:48.200 --> 03:18:51.640]  something for them as well you know not with the numbers or anything but they
[03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:56.280]  were calling it another it started with the G my goodness I totally forgot the

[03:23:08.360 --> 03:23:12.320]  prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we
[03:23:12.320 --> 03:23:16.720]  address the need for water but if you consider heat storage I'm talking about
[03:23:16.720 --> 03:23:20.960]  staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I
[03:23:20.960 --> 03:23:24.960]  keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the

[03:23:28.800 --> 03:23:32.680]  another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without
[03:23:32.680 --> 03:23:36.560]  smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn
[03:23:36.560 --> 03:23:42.000]  fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers

[03:24:07.960 --> 03:24:15.080]  ride stored and pistol by my side
[03:24:15.080 --> 03:24:23.720]  it's Paul Joseph Watson with info wars.com in Paris France in the aftermath
[03:24:23.720 --> 03:24:28.520]  of the massacre which took place just 48 hours ago and of course the big story
[03:24:28.520 --> 03:24:33.920]  to emerge out this whole incident is the fact that at least one if not two of the
[03:24:33.920 --> 03:24:38.800]  attackers were found with Assyrian passport they arrived in Greece as part
[03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:43.160]  of the migrant wave that we've been warning about for months will lead to
[03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:47.000]  these kind of attacks happening in major European cities and of course Isis
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:51.960]  themselves said that they would import they would infiltrate Europe with this
[03:24:51.960 --> 03:24:58.840]  wave of refugees so now we get the backlash the justification the president
[03:24:58.840 --> 03:25:03.280]  of the EU Commission Carl Juncker has come out and said that even though this
[03:25:03.280 --> 03:25:07.160]  is the case that they abused the system which we've been warning about for
[03:25:07.160 --> 03:25:11.640]  months would happen they're not going to change the policy so these waves of
[03:25:11.640 --> 03:25:14.880]  hundreds of thousands of migrants are going to continue to pour into the
[03:25:14.880 --> 03:25:19.200]  country we've got Obama who came out in September said that America would accept
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:24.560]  a hundred thousand of these refugees we had Hillary Clinton in the debates last
[03:25:24.560 --> 03:25:29.720]  night saying that America should accept these refugees when it's directly led
[03:25:29.720 --> 03:25:35.120]  to this attack so now we get the left-wing backlash the justification
[03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:39.480]  which is even though this has proven this is a direct connection we're going to
[03:25:39.480 --> 03:25:45.320]  continue with the policy anyway despite top French security experts and experts
[03:25:45.320 --> 03:25:50.800]  in Germany to saying that this is going to lead not only to more attacks but to
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:56.160]  civil unrest so we've been proven right this is a major issue and now we're
[03:25:56.160 --> 03:26:00.880]  getting the backlash which is don't worry about it it's it's all fine they're
[03:26:00.880 --> 03:26:04.880]  going to come in anyway we're going to vet them and they're not vetting them so
[03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:09.440]  we've got all these countries Poland has stood up and said no we're not going
[03:26:09.440 --> 03:26:14.840]  to take any more refugees and that is the lone voice of sanity in Europe so
[03:26:14.840 --> 03:26:18.160]  for the people who thought that this whole narrative would change that the
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:23.840]  insanity of Merkel in Germany her mass immigration open border policy would
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:28.560]  stop as a result of this attack and potential attacks in future that's not
[03:26:28.560 --> 03:26:33.320]  going to happen now because they're still sticking to their guns and they
[03:26:33.320 --> 03:26:37.200]  will have blood on their hands they've already got blood on their hands for
[03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:41.600]  this attack and in future they will have blood on their hands for more attacks in
[03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:47.000]  major European cities because now it's proven even though they say oh the
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:50.600]  passport was stolen it doesn't matter that it was stolen it doesn't matter
[03:26:50.600 --> 03:26:54.600]  that the individual who carried out the attacks maybe came from Belgium maybe
[03:26:54.600 --> 03:26:59.920]  came from France they stole a passport they posed as a Syrian refugee to get
[03:26:59.920 --> 03:27:05.400]  into the country and that partly led to the massacre that followed and yet this
[03:27:05.400 --> 03:27:10.800]  insane policy that European leaders are following is going to continue and we
[03:27:10.800 --> 03:27:15.000]  need to continue to speak out against that and basically make the point that
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:18.480]  if you invite hordes of these people into the country even though the vast
[03:27:18.480 --> 03:27:23.520]  majority of them are fleeing here for economic reasons some of them are fleeing
[03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:27.800]  from ISIS there will be that small contingent which are radicalized which
[03:27:27.800 --> 03:27:32.160]  are jihadists and they will carry out attacks so that is the major story to
[03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:36.440]  emerge so far out of this incident out this massacre and we'll have more
[03:27:36.440 --> 03:27:42.600]  reports coming soon at info wars dot com now the great report from Paul Joseph
[03:27:42.600 --> 03:27:47.560]  Watson he's on the streets out there in Paris trying to find out exactly what's
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:52.120]  going on and he'll have more along with Joe Biggs as our continuing coverage
[03:27:52.120 --> 03:27:55.080]  goes on out there in Paris France now we're going to finish with our last
[03:27:55.080 --> 03:27:59.320]  caller ahead of our guests so apologies to any other college well let's go to
[03:27:59.320 --> 03:28:07.280]  Ron in Texas go ahead Ron Mr. Jackson good good to speak with you and join
[03:28:07.280 --> 03:28:13.000]  the program hey listen I I wanted to talk about martial law and how it relates
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:17.160]  to Paris I think we were all riveted around the television on Friday night I
[03:28:17.160 --> 03:28:21.800]  think it was the Brett Shepherd maybe I've got his name wrong but he was the
[03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:26.440]  one that had herald over there on one of the things that I really picked up over
[03:28:26.440 --> 03:28:32.320]  and over and over again with his statement was that Paris was now in a
[03:28:32.320 --> 03:28:37.400]  state of emergency was on lockdown that the military had control and and I
[03:28:37.400 --> 03:28:43.480]  heard him say on two occasions and then I heard Megan Kelly later say the same
[03:28:43.480 --> 03:28:50.360]  thing which was the military can go in to anybody's house anybody's business
[03:28:50.360 --> 03:28:55.080]  half-escape guns if that's what they wanted to do and I couldn't help but
[03:28:55.080 --> 03:29:00.640]  think right then when I kept hearing this over and over like it was a script
[03:29:00.640 --> 03:29:08.760]  that that that is what is in our future it was almost like they were trying to
[03:29:08.760 --> 03:29:13.960]  get in our head conditioning wise and of course it reminded me of that YouTube
[03:29:13.960 --> 03:29:21.280]  video with AARP where in the background of that commercial on the radio they
[03:29:21.280 --> 03:29:28.160]  have a message about yeah I remember that story we posted an article about it
[03:29:28.160 --> 03:29:30.400]  we're to the end of our segment by definitely understand what you're
[03:29:30.400 --> 03:29:33.880]  saying there Ron because we know during Hurricane Katrina they went door to
[03:29:33.880 --> 03:29:38.040]  door they used the excuse of a crisis to go door to door confiscate people's
[03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:41.920]  firearms it's definitely a very unfortunate situation we don't want to
[03:29:41.920 --> 03:29:45.000]  happen again in this country not definitely if that is true I don't want
[03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:52.120]  that to happen in Paris either we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex
[03:29:52.120 --> 03:29:56.480]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:29:57.680 --> 03:30:02.080]  in early October of this year Matt Drudge paid a visit to the Central Texas
[03:30:02.080 --> 03:30:05.560]  Command Center and made the following chilling statements concerning free
[03:30:05.560 --> 03:30:09.720]  speech and his own site the Drudge report I had a Supreme Court Justice tell
[03:30:09.720 --> 03:30:13.920]  me to my face it's over for me said Matt it's over for you they've got the votes
[03:30:13.920 --> 03:30:17.360]  now to enforce copyright law you're out of there well now we have the words of
[03:30:17.360 --> 03:30:22.320]  FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai he said it is conceivable to me to see the government
[03:30:22.320 --> 03:30:25.800]  saying we think the Drudge report is having a disproportionate effect on our
[03:30:25.800 --> 03:30:29.880]  political discourse Pai told the right online conference back in May of 2015
[03:30:29.880 --> 03:30:33.560]  the FCC doesn't have the ability to regulate anything he says and we want
[03:30:33.560 --> 03:30:37.200]  to start tamping down on websites like that there are a lot of people who just
[03:30:37.200 --> 03:30:40.800]  don't like the fact that the internet is a completely unregulated marketplace in
[03:30:40.800 --> 03:30:44.560]  terms of freedom of speech Pai told the website inside sources and there are some
[03:30:44.560 --> 03:30:47.640]  speech that people just don't like or they think that it should be regulated
[03:30:47.640 --> 03:30:51.280]  because it has an outsized effect on public discourse and Drudge report is

[03:33:20.680 --> 03:33:25.400]  I'm your host Jakari Jax now joining me in studio now is Gilvinda Tidbal. He's a
[03:33:25.400 --> 03:33:29.160]  humanitarian who focuses on human trafficking. He's also a volunteer
[03:33:29.160 --> 03:33:33.320]  director of community concern a vice president of Street Kids Worldwide. I
[03:33:33.320 --> 03:33:37.480]  don't ask you about that on the advisory board of Care International in Sri
[03:33:37.480 --> 03:33:43.440]  Lanka and a website you can visit to find out all this is human2020.com. Welcome
[03:33:43.440 --> 03:33:49.280]  Gilvinda. Hey good to see you again Jakari. Okay so let's first start talking
[03:33:49.280 --> 03:33:53.880]  about a human 2020. We've talked about this before and what exactly is that? So
[03:33:53.880 --> 03:33:59.880]  human 2020 is a civil society business community initiative that got its start
[03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:04.400]  around the same time that the global spiritual leaders made their pledge to
[03:34:04.400 --> 03:34:10.000]  work together to see human trafficking and by the year 2020. So this was again
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:12.920]  one of those new stories that was out there but people didn't pay a lot of
[03:34:12.920 --> 03:34:17.520]  attention to it but towards the end of 2014 all the spiritual leaders in the
[03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:20.440]  world got together and they said there's one thing that they can all agree on is
[03:34:20.440 --> 03:34:24.280]  that human trafficking is an abomination to God it's an affront to all of human
[03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:29.840]  kind and that they committed themselves whether they were Catholics or Muslims or
[03:34:29.840 --> 03:34:33.880]  Christians or whatever their background was that this was something that they
[03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:38.160]  would put all of their faiths make a commitment to see this end by the year
[03:34:38.160 --> 03:34:43.280]  by 2020. So what we said too was you know what this is going to take a lot
[03:34:43.280 --> 03:34:48.600]  more than them so we will do part of what we can do as civil society as as the
[03:34:48.600 --> 03:34:52.680]  business community to support that global pledge that's been made. So the
[03:34:52.680 --> 03:34:57.160]  human 2020 initiative is along those lines and what what we're seeing those
[03:34:57.160 --> 03:35:00.400]  is people start to get more aware about this issue because a lot of people aren't
[03:35:00.400 --> 03:35:03.720]  even aware that this is something that's going on as people are getting more
[03:35:03.720 --> 03:35:07.560]  aware that there's more people enslaved today than at any time in our
[03:35:07.560 --> 03:35:12.080]  history and also how this is also implicating even global issues even what
[03:35:12.080 --> 03:35:16.920]  we've been talking about today on the show how this the issue of human
[03:35:16.920 --> 03:35:21.720]  trafficking modern day slavery and the factors that go into making that how
[03:35:21.720 --> 03:35:25.120]  that actually implicates or how that actually impacts the global issues that
[03:35:25.120 --> 03:35:29.200]  we're dealing with on a day-to-day basis more and more people realize the personal
[03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:34.240]  responsibility that they need to take in altering and changing the way that they
[03:35:34.240 --> 03:35:38.320]  approach things their lifestyle their their awareness and they're starting to
[03:35:38.320 --> 03:35:42.480]  get engaged in being part of the solution and it's when individuals start
[03:35:42.480 --> 03:35:46.360]  taking a personal responsibility in the solution and realize that they're not
[03:35:46.360 --> 03:35:50.880]  passive observers or victims but they're actually part of the solution that's
[03:35:50.880 --> 03:35:54.400]  when things are really starting to change excellent excellent explanation now
[03:35:54.400 --> 03:35:58.120]  you gave me this fact card here yeah and one of the things that caught my
[03:35:58.120 --> 03:36:02.680]  attention is the average age into sex slavery or sex trafficking rather is
[03:36:02.680 --> 03:36:06.800]  12 years old and when we talk about these trafficking issues this isn't you
[03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:09.280]  know I think a lot of people may hear this they think about maybe this is
[03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:12.960]  happening in Sri Lanka or in some other faraway place this is happening right
[03:36:12.960 --> 03:36:16.760]  now in the United States of America absolutely this is this is there are
[03:36:16.760 --> 03:36:22.120]  some 200,000 people enslaved in the United States today that are Americans so
[03:36:22.120 --> 03:36:26.400]  there are Americans enslaved in America today right now as we speak and then
[03:36:26.400 --> 03:36:29.840]  there's people that are also enslaved that are brought into this country from
[03:36:29.840 --> 03:36:34.120]  overseas but the majority of the people enslaved today in the US are Americans
[03:36:34.120 --> 03:36:37.680]  and this is where this is where sometimes when we hear about things about
[03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:42.640]  the narrative about slavery from the 1800s and people relating to that and
[03:36:42.640 --> 03:36:47.520]  discussing it this is what's going on today so bringing some relevance back
[03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:53.800]  into the discussion of issues that need to be addressed and properly engaged in
[03:36:53.800 --> 03:36:57.520]  this is part of what's necessary. Now you're saying this kind of ties into the
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:01.360]  topics that we've been speaking on the show earlier in what way in what aspects
[03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:06.640]  do you see a similarity? Well for example a lot of the international
[03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:10.560]  trafficking that we see and a lot of the issues that we see overseas are a result
[03:37:10.560 --> 03:37:15.520]  of poverty and vulnerability part of that is related to the financial systems
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:19.680]  that we have going on in the world part of that is related to how countries
[03:37:19.680 --> 03:37:24.680]  relate to each other you know lots of discussions about central banks and
[03:37:24.680 --> 03:37:30.280]  financial systems how those work and how some countries just their economic
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:35.360]  systems are destroyed or people can't live and so when people are put in a
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:41.680]  in a vulnerable situation they are much more likely to be trafficked and the
[03:37:41.680 --> 03:37:47.120]  result of that is that they're put into this meat grinder that on the other side
[03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:51.120]  of it we have countries that consume and want whatever those goods are because
[03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:54.560]  human trafficking is a business that's what people have to also understand is
[03:37:54.560 --> 03:37:59.280]  that there's a supply side and there's a demand side and on the on supply side the
[03:37:59.280 --> 03:38:03.640]  more and more people that are put into vulnerable situations by the policies
[03:38:03.640 --> 03:38:07.240]  that are going on around the world the more there's people that are on the
[03:38:07.240 --> 03:38:10.760]  supply side then on the demand side there's people that are consuming these
[03:38:10.760 --> 03:38:14.240]  goods there's people that are consuming the things that are produced by this and
[03:38:14.240 --> 03:38:19.560]  willfully staying ignorant on the subject there's a lot of people that don't
[03:38:19.560 --> 03:38:23.480]  want to know what goes on around Black Friday you know that there's a lot of
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:27.040]  people don't they don't want to know how these things are produced they just
[03:38:27.040 --> 03:38:33.600]  want that $5 $10 good yeah because we hear about you know we always talk
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:36.760]  about the Foxconn factories now this isn't necessarily trafficking but you
[03:38:36.760 --> 03:38:40.360]  know just the situations that those people are in yeah with a symbol the
[03:38:40.360 --> 03:38:44.320]  Apple goods you know the situation is so bad out there that they had to put up
[03:38:44.320 --> 03:38:48.720]  suicide nets around the facilities that keep people you know committing
[03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:52.880]  suicide yeah and we see a lot of different situations where people are
[03:38:52.880 --> 03:38:56.520]  dealing with this so we've been talking about the problem I know you've been
[03:38:56.520 --> 03:38:59.240]  working on some solutions you have some things going on here in the city of
[03:38:59.240 --> 03:39:04.200]  Austin you know what have you come across well what I'm seeing now is that
[03:39:04.200 --> 03:39:08.920]  as people are getting more engaged and as people are getting more aware they
[03:39:08.920 --> 03:39:13.680]  are pushing for a few things one we're seeing pushes for legislative change so
[03:39:13.680 --> 03:39:17.080]  I mean in the US we've seen some legislative changes we see these on
[03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:21.120]  city and state levels as well as some things that have been pushed through for
[03:39:21.120 --> 03:39:25.160]  on the national level so on the national level towards the start of this year they
[03:39:25.160 --> 03:39:29.520]  introduced a bill in Congress that's gone through but even with those things it
[03:39:29.520 --> 03:39:35.360]  takes some time to see those take some effect and then but any with any law it's
[03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:39.320]  only as good as as the people that are enforcing it and then the and if it's
[03:39:39.320 --> 03:39:44.280]  actually formed in a way that it can be have some teeth and make an effect in
[03:39:44.280 --> 03:39:48.880]  the city of Austin you know we saw a resolution you know that you know we
[03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:52.720]  were we were associated with as well which was you know pushed forward with
[03:39:52.720 --> 03:39:58.080]  the with the some of the allies in in in Austin on this whole thing too that we're
[03:39:58.080 --> 03:40:02.440]  so we're seeing you know even that is for the city council admitting that
[03:40:02.440 --> 03:40:06.640]  there's an issue because we're destination location for a lot of
[03:40:06.640 --> 03:40:11.400]  events I mean we had formula one we got south by we got all types of events we
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:16.560]  have 30 to 40 major events in the city of Austin every year so we have you know
[03:40:16.560 --> 03:40:20.800]  almost every week we have a major event that happens and statistically we see
[03:40:20.800 --> 03:40:25.400]  two wherever there's large events to take place again back to supply and
[03:40:25.400 --> 03:40:29.120]  demand if there's a demand coming into the city for something the supply will
[03:40:29.120 --> 03:40:32.080]  also start to match that now these are things that are happening behind the
[03:40:32.080 --> 03:40:36.640]  scenes we've got the because because people are getting more aware around
[03:40:36.640 --> 03:40:40.440]  this more and more people are coming to the forefront saying what can we do how
[03:40:40.440 --> 03:40:44.800]  can we get engaged how can we be involved you know Austin I really think
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:48.400]  that the police department here is doing a good job of like saying this is a
[03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:51.880]  priority we're bringing to the forefront we're gonna work on this you
[03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:55.640]  know we've got a good police chief here in the city I mean yeah he's a good guy
[03:40:55.640 --> 03:41:00.040]  well no no no because I was laughing that's why he said that you know I've
[03:41:00.040 --> 03:41:04.800]  had issues with APD they know that but I will give them because even before we
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:07.480]  are talking about this one the reason I wanted to get you on was a couple weeks
[03:41:07.480 --> 03:41:11.200]  ago I got I get the APD email yeah I think I sent this to you yeah you know
[03:41:11.200 --> 03:41:15.320]  and they had a real tough crack down on the human trafficking so you know I may
[03:41:15.320 --> 03:41:18.760]  have issues with APD another another subject but on human trafficking they're
[03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:22.400]  doing a pretty good job and that's a and that's a good a good place to also
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:25.280]  highlight something even with all the global religions they all have
[03:41:25.280 --> 03:41:29.200]  differences but there's some things that we can agree on and it's this is part
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:32.400]  of what the human 2020 initiative is about is just saying what's the common
[03:41:32.400 --> 03:41:35.840]  ground what are the things that we can agree on can we all universally agree
[03:41:35.840 --> 03:41:41.640]  that it is wrong to enslave another human being and and to profit off of the
[03:41:41.640 --> 03:41:46.560]  suffering of another human being and is this is this not just on every level on
[03:41:46.560 --> 03:41:51.200]  a moral level on a human level on just on just what it is to be a living being
[03:41:51.200 --> 03:41:55.360]  on this planet and once we can come to that agreement then we can also move
[03:41:55.360 --> 03:41:59.120]  forward with that and then you also start to see who's even on that level
[03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:02.440]  because there's a lot of companies there's a lot of businesses that profit
[03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:06.160]  off of human trafficking there's a lot of individuals that are at very high
[03:42:06.160 --> 03:42:10.840]  levels that can either turn a blind eye to it or sometimes even be engaged in
[03:42:10.840 --> 03:42:14.760]  that and so this is this is part of what's necessary to bring that to the
[03:42:14.760 --> 03:42:19.720]  forefront this is where as individuals and they're dated in our day-to-day we
[03:42:19.720 --> 03:42:23.120]  have to be able to say to here's what we can do that's going to make an impact
[03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:26.880]  and it's the small things that people do that make a big difference now one
[03:42:26.880 --> 03:42:30.360]  things I wanted to ask you now you can correct me if I'm wrong with this but
[03:42:30.360 --> 03:42:35.680]  you were also working on some type of initiative to crack down on prostitution
[03:42:35.680 --> 03:42:40.080]  is that accurate well we there's been some I mean not too many things in that
[03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:43.800]  area directly we've been in a lot of dialogues with people that have this is
[03:42:43.800 --> 03:42:47.640]  again one of these places where there's a lot of people that have opinions about
[03:42:47.640 --> 03:42:52.440]  stuff and sometimes they're formulated in in actual experience and sometimes it's
[03:42:52.440 --> 03:42:54.880]  just because they read something somewhere and they think that sounds
[03:42:54.880 --> 03:42:58.160]  good you know like a lot of people in this country talking about socialism they
[03:42:58.160 --> 03:43:01.880]  think it sounds good but everybody that talks about socialism in this country
[03:43:01.880 --> 03:43:06.520]  has never lived or worked in a social yeah yeah all you yes all you UT kids who
[03:43:06.520 --> 03:43:09.560]  think it's the coolest thing in the world get actually that's that's an
[03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:14.280]  interesting story how I met govinda we were we were doing the protest outside
[03:43:14.280 --> 03:43:18.040]  of Planned Parenthood and you know the goofy college kids come up there you
[03:43:18.040 --> 03:43:20.760]  know talking about how they love Satan and you know they don't take baths and
[03:43:20.760 --> 03:43:24.760]  all this and in the midst of all that you know I met govinda you know very
[03:43:24.760 --> 03:43:28.640]  professional gentlemen said hey I come check out this human 2020 deal we have
[03:43:28.640 --> 03:43:32.800]  going on and myself and kid Daniels went out to your you had an art gallery
[03:43:32.800 --> 03:43:35.840]  yes bringing awareness to all this and you know and I think it's a very
[03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:39.760]  important issue because we talked about a lot of things we've talked about you
[03:43:39.760 --> 03:43:42.600]  know people in foreign countries I believe it was was it in China where
[03:43:42.600 --> 03:43:45.960]  they had that band it ran around and a snatch people's organs out just all
[03:43:45.960 --> 03:43:50.640]  types of wild insane things that are going on and they really don't get a
[03:43:50.640 --> 03:43:54.320]  lot of media attention for whatever reason you know maybe it's just too
[03:43:54.320 --> 03:43:58.120]  hard to stomach on the nightly news or whatever it is but these are some real
[03:43:58.120 --> 03:44:02.560]  hardcore issues that people really need to take the time to face yeah and and
[03:44:02.560 --> 03:44:07.800]  realizing to that the fact that these are difficult issues it there they're
[03:44:07.800 --> 03:44:11.680]  also issues that have solutions and that's this is something to that that
[03:44:11.680 --> 03:44:16.240]  people they really need to to realize that on one side yes this is these are
[03:44:16.240 --> 03:44:19.760]  horrific narratives and these are our terrible things that are going on but
[03:44:19.760 --> 03:44:25.200]  there also can be solved for you know I just spent some time up at the University
[03:44:25.200 --> 03:44:28.400]  of Nebraska spent some time with the Attorney General up there at the for
[03:44:28.400 --> 03:44:32.160]  the state of Nebraska great guy again you got some good people coming in you
[03:44:32.160 --> 03:44:35.080]  know that that are coming to the forefront and he pushed through some
[03:44:35.080 --> 03:44:39.440]  legislation up there in the state you know hundred percent unanimous vote
[03:44:39.440 --> 03:44:43.280]  making that for state law and they're they're formulating their traffic their
[03:44:43.280 --> 03:44:48.120]  their trafficking task force up there so but even in those discussions to the
[03:44:48.120 --> 03:44:52.840]  head of their trafficking task force said look it's simple no jobs no trafficking
[03:44:52.840 --> 03:44:56.920]  no as far as for sex trafficking if you don't if you don't have the buyers you're
[03:44:56.920 --> 03:45:03.080]  not going to have this taking place so so it's part of it is people to realize
[03:45:03.080 --> 03:45:08.440]  to that the what they do in their day-to-day lives have an impact and
[03:45:08.440 --> 03:45:12.200]  sometimes people don't realize a connection so when we buy certain things
[03:45:12.200 --> 03:45:15.880]  when we buy certain products when we take part in certain activities even
[03:45:15.880 --> 03:45:20.640]  though people think okay this piece that I'm doing it really doesn't matter or
[03:45:20.640 --> 03:45:24.520]  it's just my own life it actually does matter a lot and it's the collective
[03:45:24.520 --> 03:45:28.840]  actions that are actually what have built the system of trafficking and it
[03:45:28.840 --> 03:45:33.360]  reinforced the slave system that we have today very good very good let's go
[03:45:33.360 --> 03:45:36.760]  ahead and open up the phones with I guess about five or so minutes we have the
[03:45:36.760 --> 03:45:45.840]  number to call in is 1-800-253-3139 once again that is 1-800-253-3139
[03:45:45.840 --> 03:45:51.000]  1-800-259-9231 I have that other phone number like burned my man does like
[03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:53.720]  that don't call that number that was the customer service you can call the
[03:45:53.720 --> 03:45:58.480]  number if you want to get some great products number calls 1-800-259-9231
[03:45:58.480 --> 03:46:04.480]  that is 1-800-259-9231 wow you just get used to saying the phone number so much
[03:46:04.480 --> 03:46:08.960]  anyway okay so you can call in you talk to go vendor tidball of human 2020 now
[03:46:08.960 --> 03:46:13.280]  human 2020 that's the initiative yeah so tell us how you know if somebody wanted
[03:46:13.280 --> 03:46:16.640]  to how could they get involved in that initiative well so right now we've got
[03:46:16.640 --> 03:46:21.520]  different projects that are going different pieces that are like projects
[03:46:21.520 --> 03:46:25.640]  within that initiative so probably the easiest way is just people to write an
[03:46:25.640 --> 03:46:29.320]  input human 2020 say kind of something that they're curious about getting
[03:46:29.320 --> 03:46:33.080]  involved with and we can bridge them in from there so like I'll give you a
[03:46:33.080 --> 03:46:36.040]  simple thing that people are doing right now there's a thing called 20 on 20
[03:46:36.040 --> 03:46:42.360]  every 20th of the month for 20 minutes whatever people's background is they
[03:46:42.360 --> 03:46:46.240]  spend 20 minutes in prayer meditation but towards the end of human trafficking
[03:46:46.240 --> 03:46:50.080]  every 20th people are doing this and it's growing and people are doing this all
[03:46:50.080 --> 03:46:54.160]  over the world right now and people do it as an individual they get together with
[03:46:54.160 --> 03:46:57.520]  some friends they might do it at a church they might do it at a yoga studio
[03:46:57.520 --> 03:47:01.760]  they might do but however it is that they do it but spend that time and put
[03:47:01.760 --> 03:47:06.760]  that that connection and that that that focus towards the end of this however
[03:47:06.760 --> 03:47:10.400]  it is that you know how to relate and what we're seeing is just something as
[03:47:10.400 --> 03:47:14.400]  simple as that doesn't cost any money doesn't take anything more than just a
[03:47:14.400 --> 03:47:17.920]  little bit of time and a little bit of self-commitment and just something as
[03:47:17.920 --> 03:47:21.400]  simple as that you know I mean I pray I'm praying the name of Jesus that this
[03:47:21.400 --> 03:47:26.400]  thing ends every 20th for 20 minutes and we're seeing every time that people
[03:47:26.400 --> 03:47:30.920]  make that commitment watch two three days after that you see several things
[03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:34.960]  just pop you know that happen with this yeah and speaking of some recent things
[03:47:34.960 --> 03:47:39.520]  I have this FBI article I printed a few of these off and says that Henderson
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:43.600]  County Kentucky man sends to 10 years in prison for human trafficking and these
[03:47:43.600 --> 03:47:47.560]  are just some the more recent events that have been going on that you can find
[03:47:47.560 --> 03:47:52.000]  on the FBI.gov website now let's go ahead and take a call we have Mark in
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:48:01.200]  California go ahead Mark yeah Vicky Wynn on NBC deserves a medal for her fine
[03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:06.720]  work she did on the 30th of last week if you google Vicky Wynn it's spelled NGU
[03:48:06.720 --> 03:48:12.400]  YEN child abuse and there was this four-year-old kid here in my city of
[03:48:12.400 --> 03:48:19.640]  San Jose that was just brutally brutally beat and she went to the CPS there
[03:48:19.640 --> 03:48:24.600]  the social services had over a hundred pictures and they wave gone now we don't
[03:48:24.600 --> 03:48:30.360]  care about it get out of here and and but it did air on NBC and so David
[03:48:30.360 --> 03:48:34.800]  Cortese who's our supervisor we need to pray for him and the supervisors here in
[03:48:34.800 --> 03:48:40.560]  San Jose they're trying to investigate it but you know I originally ran for
[03:48:40.560 --> 03:48:45.160]  city council and in San Jose because of the Nancy Schaefer situation where she
[03:48:45.160 --> 03:48:50.400]  was killed because she said the CPS was full of pedophiles and I thought oh my
[03:48:50.400 --> 03:48:54.200]  I hope it's not in California because she had mentioned that it was in the
[03:48:54.200 --> 03:48:58.320]  other states and she had proposed legislation to get rid of the entire CPS
[03:48:58.320 --> 03:49:02.120]  because they were full of pedophiles but this poor little girl was found with
[03:49:02.120 --> 03:49:08.120]  the bruises bite marks burn marks and they knew about it they knew about it
[03:49:08.120 --> 03:49:13.280]  your car didn't do Italy squat yeah now govinda I don't know how far you're
[03:49:13.280 --> 03:49:18.040]  in investigations in your initiative run have you encountered any these CPS or
[03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:22.800]  stories well here's the thing I what we've seen and some of the stuff
[03:49:22.800 --> 03:49:28.280]  internationally what we see is there are elements of people at high levels you
[03:49:28.280 --> 03:49:33.200]  know that are engaged and again to the the wheat and the tears grow together you
[03:49:33.200 --> 03:49:37.720]  see good people inside these offices yes good work trying to do their job trying
[03:49:37.720 --> 03:49:43.200]  to make things as as as healthy and as good as possible for everybody and then
[03:49:43.200 --> 03:49:49.520]  you get other people that are in there in in you know we've seen it in UN
[03:49:49.520 --> 03:49:54.320]  organizations we've seen it in you know any organization and any organization
[03:49:54.320 --> 03:49:59.080]  really and so this is back to again the responsibility of civil society and
[03:49:59.080 --> 03:50:03.320]  individuals instead of us making a blanket statement saying oh this group
[03:50:03.320 --> 03:50:06.680]  over here is bad and this and then and then discounting them entirely
[03:50:06.680 --> 03:50:10.120]  realize that there's probably some good people in there trying to do a good job
[03:50:10.120 --> 03:50:14.080]  and there's probably some bad people in there that may have access and so
[03:50:14.080 --> 03:50:19.000]  surfacing these things making sure that they're factual making sure that they're
[03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:23.840]  that that we are up there objectively verifiable this is part of what is
[03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:28.600]  necessary to and and keep those at the forefront don't let those issues go away
[03:50:28.600 --> 03:50:32.600]  so when something comes up like that so like mark what you raised when those
[03:50:32.600 --> 03:50:36.680]  things come up make sure that those are those narratives don't go away until
[03:50:36.680 --> 03:50:39.920]  they're properly addressed and then we keep moving forward with that I will
[03:50:39.920 --> 03:50:43.640]  thank you so much go vented bomb sorry to the rest of our collars and our next

[03:55:23.320 --> 03:55:25.680]  is talking about that you know not too many people watched that their
[03:55:25.680 --> 03:55:31.680]  viewership was down yeah yeah now 45% but you know it's by design they picked
[03:55:31.680 --> 03:55:34.240]  a Saturday night yes and of course the next one you're talking about getting
[03:55:34.240 --> 03:55:39.080]  getting products in while you can right now before Christmas well the next
[03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:43.800]  debate is going to be the weekend before Christmas Christmas all through the
[03:55:43.800 --> 03:55:47.200]  house on a soul is watching no you know it's that's what they're trying to do
[03:55:47.200 --> 03:55:51.720]  they're also going to have the one after that is going to be the during the NFL
[03:55:51.720 --> 03:55:55.560]  playoffs again on a Saturday night and it's all sorry Sunday night and it's
[03:55:55.560 --> 03:56:00.080]  going to be before the Martin Luther King holiday the following Monday so
[03:56:00.080 --> 03:56:02.440]  people are gonna be out of town they're gonna be like they're burying these
[03:56:02.440 --> 03:56:05.320]  things David well that's exactly what the other campaigns are saying they're
[03:56:05.320 --> 03:56:08.240]  saying you're burying this for Hillary Clinton and we can see as we're gonna
[03:56:08.240 --> 03:56:12.760]  look tonight the many many obvious lies of Hillary Clinton saying things like
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:16.360]  3,000 people since their last debate had been killed by guns that there'd been
[03:56:16.360 --> 03:56:21.760]  21 mass shootings no actually there was one shooting and it wasn't that large
[03:56:21.760 --> 03:56:25.200]  a shooting there were four people involved three were shot one person died
[03:56:25.200 --> 03:56:28.880]  she said three people died I mean she was all over the place jacari and of
[03:56:28.880 --> 03:56:32.200]  course she was telling lies about her opponents as well as telling lies about
[03:56:32.200 --> 03:56:37.200]  foreign policy and then Bernie Sanders essentially painted Eisenhower as a
[03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:40.200]  socialist they said well how high is your tax rate gonna go and he goes well
[03:56:40.200 --> 03:56:45.720]  it won't be 90% that's what Eisenhower had well we're gonna look at the truth
[03:56:45.720 --> 03:56:49.840]  of the tax rates we're gonna look at what a real socialist FDR did to the tax
[03:56:49.840 --> 03:56:53.680]  rates versus what Reagan did and we're also gonna look at Eisenhower we're
[03:56:53.680 --> 03:56:57.640]  gonna fact-check all that tonight yeah just the hubris of these people they
[03:56:57.640 --> 03:57:00.800]  would just say that they could just throw out any number and nobody's going to go
[03:57:00.800 --> 03:57:04.720]  and look you know just say that I could you know walk off a helicopter getting
[03:57:04.720 --> 03:57:08.600]  shot by snipers and you know it hey it happened and then they come out of the
[03:57:08.600 --> 03:57:11.600]  proof well when you look at whatever he's gotten away with what Bill and Hillary
[03:57:11.600 --> 03:57:14.960]  have gotten away with why wouldn't she think that she could say or do anything
[03:57:14.960 --> 03:57:18.640]  and nobody would call her on it and clearly they don't and most people like
[03:57:18.640 --> 03:57:21.520]  I said are not watching they only had eight and a half million viewers they
[03:57:21.520 --> 03:57:25.760]  had 15 and a half million viewers at the last their first debate and they're
[03:57:25.760 --> 03:57:28.600]  only gonna have six debates and I don't know what the next two are gonna be but
[03:57:28.600 --> 03:57:32.120]  I mean after these two that I just told you about but those the next two that
[03:57:32.120 --> 03:57:34.960]  are coming up I mean nobody's gonna be watching those they've designed that
[03:57:34.960 --> 03:57:38.560]  just for that purpose they don't want to vet the candidates they don't want to
[03:57:38.560 --> 03:57:41.720]  debate Hillary and I don't think she's gonna be a very strong candidate
[03:57:41.720 --> 03:57:44.440]  regardless of who gets it but you know we can get into all this presidential
[03:57:44.440 --> 03:57:48.480]  politics but it is important to look at the lies and that's what we're going to
[03:57:48.480 --> 03:57:52.240]  see is the multiple lies told not only by her but other candidates in the
[03:57:52.240 --> 03:57:55.040]  Democrat debate so we're gonna cover that as well as what's going on in Paris
[03:57:55.040 --> 03:57:58.720]  tonight yeah and I'm looking at this article David on infowars.com
[03:57:58.720 --> 03:58:02.800]  Brennan fourth amendment will allow terrorists to attack America yeah
[03:58:02.800 --> 03:58:05.680]  constitutional got to get rid of you got to get rid of that constitution got to
[03:58:05.680 --> 03:58:08.720]  get rid of all the rights you know your first amendment fourth amendment second
[03:58:08.720 --> 03:58:11.640]  amendment all of them so they can go all the way down the list they get them all
[03:58:11.640 --> 03:58:15.320]  out of the country so thank you so much David Knight definitely want you guys
[03:58:15.320 --> 03:58:18.800]  to join us for the info wars nightly news do you have any closing comments
[03:58:18.800 --> 03:58:21.880]  statements David well you know along that line jacar we've seen conservative
[03:58:21.880 --> 03:58:25.760]  talk show host cheerleading in the wake of this shooting in Paris saying I'm
[03:58:25.760 --> 03:58:28.800]  glad they shot jihadi John with the drone and killed him without having a
[03:58:28.800 --> 03:58:32.920]  trial well you know what he may very well have been guilty if he's guilty you
[03:58:32.920 --> 03:58:36.440]  won't have any problem proving it in a court of law but when you get rid of the
[03:58:36.440 --> 03:58:40.600]  rule of law because of the worst case scenario we have to understand how this
[03:58:40.600 --> 03:58:43.720]  always works out we've seen how the Rico statutes work they came after
[03:58:43.720 --> 03:58:53.040]  organized crime and then they wound up going after Christians thank you David
