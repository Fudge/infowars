[00:00.000 --> 00:22.400]  The threat is real, but what is the threat, and who's behind it?
[00:22.400 --> 00:29.040]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:29.040 --> 00:37.080]  the Info War.
[00:37.080 --> 00:43.800]  What an eventful fourth of July with an ICBM confirmed being fired from North Korea, that
[00:43.800 --> 00:48.480]  could reach the United States crashing into the ocean, brought off the coast of Japan.
[00:48.480 --> 00:54.200]  Japan and South Korea have accelerated evacuations out of major cities and are pulling back towns
[00:54.200 --> 00:58.840]  and populations near the DMZ, ahead of possible strikes.
[00:58.840 --> 01:04.880]  Russia and China have signaled that they may have to support a U.S. strike on, or a joint
[01:04.880 --> 01:10.920]  strike on North Korea, but have also cautioned the U.S. to stop engaging in provocative military
[01:10.920 --> 01:11.920]  drills.
[01:11.920 --> 01:16.600]  What are you supposed to do when North Korea is starting to nuke everybody?
[01:16.600 --> 01:19.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me just start with this piece of news.
[01:19.640 --> 01:30.280]  We had Leo Zagami on, Vatican expert who lives in Rome, on Monday, talking about and breaking
[01:30.280 --> 01:35.280]  gay cocaine orgies at the Inquisition's headquarters.
[01:35.280 --> 01:40.120]  Now that, he broke that last week, he was on Monday.
[01:40.120 --> 01:44.880]  I was checking it because I wanted to check what he was saying, couldn't find anything
[01:44.880 --> 01:45.880]  on it.
[01:45.880 --> 01:51.720]  It was clearly mailed today, Vatican police break up gay orgy at home of Secretary of
[01:51.720 --> 01:57.520]  the Pope Francis Key Advisors, exactly what Zagami said.
[01:57.520 --> 02:03.520]  And you've got the deputy pope, basically his right-hand man, indicted for the recruiting
[02:03.520 --> 02:09.320]  and kidnapping, basically grooming, raping of small children over 40-plus years, and
[02:09.320 --> 02:10.880]  the pope trying to cover that up.
[02:10.880 --> 02:13.440]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:13.440 --> 02:19.920]  No wonder they ran more news headlines from Australia to Germany, to Canada today, saying
[02:19.920 --> 02:24.920]  that I say there's slave colonies on Mars, there's no video, there's no quotes, they
[02:24.920 --> 02:32.240]  just lie and make it up, because they want to divert off of this and make jokes about
[02:32.240 --> 02:34.640]  kidnapped kids.
[02:34.640 --> 02:39.440]  One AP report about thousands of kidnapped and raped and many of them murdered Haitian
[02:39.440 --> 02:40.440]  kids.
[02:40.440 --> 02:45.120]  Again, that's how they operate, real news gets no coverage, all their fake garbage gets
[02:45.120 --> 02:46.880]  massive, massive coverage.
[02:46.880 --> 02:50.720]  So for all you writers that get the talking points globally, to put out the disinfo by
[02:50.720 --> 02:55.480]  your corporate masters, you were aiding and abetting the pedophiles, the child kidnapping
[02:55.480 --> 02:57.400]  rings, the Satanism, all of it.
[02:57.400 --> 03:00.360]  So just know that's on you.
[03:00.360 --> 03:04.960]  Just know that's on you and this is all going to come out, you're not going to be able to
[03:04.960 --> 03:05.960]  stop it.
[03:05.960 --> 03:09.200]  Now obviously that's not our top story, I'm going to play a clip of Zagami from Monday
[03:09.200 --> 03:15.240]  later in the next hour and then actually show you mainstream news, now confirming it all.
[03:15.240 --> 03:19.960]  Obviously the big news, Russia, China, North Korea, missile tests, unacceptable, Japan,
[03:19.960 --> 03:24.800]  more cities hold evacuation drills, prepare for missile attacks, almost all mainline
[03:24.800 --> 03:29.200]  analyst degree, this is the closest we've been to nuclear war in a long time and not
[03:29.200 --> 03:30.680]  so much with North Korea.
[03:30.680 --> 03:35.280]  North Korea is the detonator, the trigger for a larger nuclear war, I guess just been saying
[03:35.280 --> 03:42.920]  that for over a decade, Joel Scalzen, a former Marine Corps officer, expert, a lot of great
[03:42.920 --> 03:46.120]  contacts, we should get him back on the next two days, talk about this because he keeps
[03:46.120 --> 03:51.520]  saying it's the trigger as we approach 2020 and we are getting very, very close to that
[03:51.520 --> 03:53.720]  right now, are we not?
[03:53.720 --> 04:02.600]  Now that said, we're also going to get into CNN rocked by huge backlash after it blackmailed
[04:02.600 --> 04:09.440]  the creator of Trump's CNN meme, that's an infowars.com story, we've got the US code,
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.320]  state and federal law there, where you can see how what CNN did was illegal, CNN admits
[04:14.320 --> 04:20.600]  what they did was illegal, CNN admits that they said we're going to publish the full
[04:20.600 --> 04:26.200]  name and who you really are if you don't retract, now they could say we're going to
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.160]  publish this and then see if he retracted, but instead they said do this or we will,
[04:31.160 --> 04:36.520]  it's called racketeering, it violates state and federal law, it's pure coercion or a
[04:36.520 --> 04:39.920]  terroristic threat depending on which state you're in and we've got the federal and state
[04:39.920 --> 04:44.480]  laws here, we're going to look at those crimes, also the Olympics has now made it official,
[04:44.480 --> 04:49.160]  men can compete in all the women's sports, so I'm getting ready to go compete I guess
[04:49.160 --> 04:54.440]  in women's wrestling, couldn't beat any of the men, but don't worry, I may become the
[04:54.440 --> 05:00.640]  new champion like Andy Kaufman, stay with us.
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.600]  The New York Times ran the headline, Central Americans, scared of what's happening in
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.560]  US, staying put, this has been a popular talking point of the left, aimed at demonizing President
[05:09.560 --> 05:13.760]  Trump's strong border policy, but think about the paradigm here, implying that somehow it
[05:13.760 --> 05:17.520]  is a bad thing that people aren't rushing to our country in droves because it's not
[05:17.520 --> 05:22.240]  easy to get in and reside here illegally anymore, the same people implying this also
[05:22.240 --> 05:27.400]  stressed the hardship of poor people specifically citing healthcare, well then how is more people
[05:27.400 --> 05:31.760]  here that are in need going to help that problem, so the Democrats complain all day about how
[05:31.760 --> 05:35.960]  we don't have enough welfare for Americans yet they want to take more people in here
[05:35.960 --> 05:39.840]  that need welfare, but really all President Trump is doing is enforcing border security
[05:39.840 --> 05:44.160]  and law, but since when is it just free for anyone to come here, since when is America
[05:44.160 --> 05:48.160]  supposed to have open doors for anyone, I don't see anyone from North America rushing
[05:48.160 --> 05:52.600]  to get into Central America, you know why, because you couldn't and it's better here,
[05:52.600 --> 05:58.600]  it's all equates to one thing, more Democrats losing in upcoming elections, for Infowars.com,
[05:58.600 --> 06:01.680]  this is Owen Schreuer.
[06:01.680 --> 06:06.920]  MycoZX is back in after five plus months sold out, talk about next level probiotic, it's
[06:06.920 --> 06:12.240]  the anti fungus, anti yeast, latest technology of 4.8 stars, it's been sold out for months,
[06:12.240 --> 06:15.920]  big waiting list, limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have
[06:15.920 --> 06:19.520]  it be California standards, nobody's got something that's good, say 30% off of MycoZX
[06:19.520 --> 06:24.120]  and get the gut health support back, when you get it with the biome defense, 50 billion
[06:24.120 --> 06:28.440]  live in each pill, probiotic, MycoZX contains seven of the world's most powerful organic
[06:28.440 --> 06:32.280]  and well crafted ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal

[06:37.800 --> 06:42.280]  before it sells out again, 10% off when you choose auto ship, it's kind of embarrassing
[06:42.280 --> 06:45.680]  to get family and crew members on that, you know, have terrible bowel and Crohn's type
[06:45.680 --> 06:48.520]  stuff that didn't exist years ago, now it's epidemic, but I'm getting ready to have a
[06:48.520 --> 06:51.560]  bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them because regardless

[07:24.920 --> 07:27.160]  we do not use nanoparticles.
[07:27.160 --> 07:30.680]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[07:30.680 --> 07:36.360]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth, the truly natural fragrance
[07:36.360 --> 07:39.240]  free sunscreen for the most sensitive skin.
[07:39.240 --> 07:43.800]  Emeryx Essentials wants you to enjoy the sun and strives to bring you organic products

[08:23.640 --> 08:29.000]  I must be very disciplined today or we will not get to your phone calls and all the news
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  and the guests.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.120]  We have joining us, Roger Stone's coming up at the bottom of the hour with big breaking
[08:35.120 --> 08:39.120]  news from inside the White House on what's currently happening with the power struggles
[08:39.120 --> 08:44.040]  there and some of the next big shoes to drop.
[08:44.040 --> 08:51.840]  We have another investigative journalist who first began breaking months ago that the 17
[08:51.840 --> 08:58.880]  intelligence agencies that supposedly unanimously said that the Russians influenced our elections
[08:58.880 --> 09:04.360]  never made those findings and it was all a giant hoax.
[09:04.360 --> 09:08.040]  And of course last week the New York Times had to come out and admit it all was a giant
[09:08.040 --> 09:14.120]  hoax but that got basically zero coverage in mainstream media because they cover for
[09:14.120 --> 09:15.120]  each other.
[09:15.120 --> 09:22.120]  So if you want to know more about that, you can find us on our website at www.perryofconsortiumnews.com.
[09:22.120 --> 09:27.800]  We'll be joining us Paul Watson, we'll be hosting the fourth hour but incredible levels
[09:27.800 --> 09:28.800]  of hoaxing.
[09:28.800 --> 09:38.560]  I mean when they get Tom Brokaw to go on MSNBC and NBC out of retirement, called in, he admitted
[09:38.560 --> 09:41.600]  to stand against the great evil.
[09:41.600 --> 09:47.840]  The great evil, he said we must have courage against the great evil of fake news and Alex
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.120]  Jones.
[09:52.120 --> 09:54.800]  That's Twilight Zone.
[09:54.800 --> 10:04.400]  And to add a little poison cherry, another little dropping, he left, a little rat and
[10:04.400 --> 10:10.920]  all his fake condescending judgmental spaced out verbiage.
[10:10.920 --> 10:18.680]  He said I'm a complete and total racist, he used a fancy $10 word, unalloyed.
[10:18.680 --> 10:27.640]  And the reason, the reason I mentioned that is he's back on the trail with editorials
[10:27.640 --> 10:31.640]  and interviews saying call out fake journalist like Alex Jones.
[10:31.640 --> 10:43.120]  Tom, continue to call me out, you delusional, warmongering, race-baiting, globalist fossil.
[10:43.120 --> 10:50.760]  And I don't mean that disrespectful to our elders, but a fossil of thinking.
[10:50.760 --> 10:57.160]  I mean that's all they've got is to say things about me that I never said, little news flash.
[10:57.160 --> 11:02.960]  They're calling somebody deeply racist and they don't show you a quote or a clip.
[11:02.960 --> 11:07.600]  You know the person doing that is a race-bater that's even worse than being a racist in my
[11:07.600 --> 11:13.160]  view because they consciously know it's a bunch of bull, they're using it to control
[11:13.160 --> 11:14.160]  people.
[11:14.160 --> 11:15.160]  It's amazing.
[11:15.160 --> 11:17.640]  But the media has taught people that's powerful.
[11:17.640 --> 11:21.680]  Know it's empty.
[11:21.680 --> 11:25.240]  The old days you call somebody racist with evidence 30, 40 years ago would do something.
[11:25.240 --> 11:28.400]  It was like shooting somebody with 37 Magnum.
[11:28.400 --> 11:32.320]  Now it's like throwing a water balloon at somebody.
[11:32.320 --> 11:35.520]  It doesn't do anything.
[11:35.520 --> 11:41.160]  And that's really covered for a lot of tribalists and racists and people who are Hispanic races,
[11:41.160 --> 11:43.160]  white races, black races, you name it.
[11:43.160 --> 11:50.200]  And we really see before I tell this news, the failure of Christendom here.
[11:50.200 --> 11:55.960]  It was Christianity and it was Western Europe that banned slavery worldwide, except for
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.480]  in Islamic countries and some areas of Africa, curtailed it about 95%.
[12:00.480 --> 12:07.360]  It was Christianity that first looked at itself and said what we're doing is wrong.
[12:07.360 --> 12:15.120]  And so they've used the globalists, the leftists, the social engineers, they've used our instincts
[12:15.120 --> 12:18.520]  to be open and loving and have a good society against us.
[12:18.520 --> 12:21.920]  You know you can look at areas of Latin America, you can look at areas of Asia, you can look
[12:21.920 --> 12:25.200]  at areas of Africa, doesn't matter.
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.040]  And they can look at tribal lines where the tribes are genetically basically identical
[12:29.040 --> 12:30.040]  in areas of Africa.
[12:30.040 --> 12:33.520]  The sociologists and the apologists have done this, but they're Christian, they're super
[12:33.520 --> 12:39.200]  prosperous, have industry, have technology, have medicine, and then you'll have Muslims
[12:39.200 --> 12:45.120]  right across the river or animus, rock worshipers, plant worshipers, and they will always be
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.200]  in total barbarism.
[12:48.200 --> 12:53.960]  Christianity for all its faults in actual deployment, the idea of New Testament Christianity
[12:53.960 --> 12:56.600]  creates civilization.
[12:56.600 --> 13:01.800]  And the Atlantic Monthly, the same one's calling for the overthrow of Trump, the same one's
[13:01.800 --> 13:07.240]  saying I should be shut down, a very elitist mouthpiece, you talk about anti-American,
[13:07.240 --> 13:09.920]  they're it.
[13:09.920 --> 13:15.360]  Globalist MAG claims Trump won't stop the decline of white Christian America, Sun's
[13:15.360 --> 13:22.080]  slowly setting, this is a quote, on values of white Christian American, globalist claim.
[13:22.080 --> 13:28.280]  It's the end of white Christian America, an excerpt from a book reposted in the Atlantic,
[13:28.280 --> 13:33.800]  and I read the article, it celebrates the end of whites and the end of Christianity.
[13:33.800 --> 13:39.920]  And these are white elitists left to sing this because you see, they have trouble taking
[13:39.920 --> 13:46.120]  over Christian countries, globalist too, and they know Christians are gonna oppose microchips
[13:46.120 --> 13:51.160]  to buy and sell, face scanning to turn on the new iPhone that's coming out, you have
[13:51.160 --> 13:56.520]  to face scan, it's all been announced, everything the Christians warned of 2000 years ago is
[13:56.520 --> 14:00.760]  now happening, real Christians, not your big bought off corporate run, state run, you
[14:00.760 --> 14:04.160]  know, mega churches, Catholic, Protestant, you name it, I mean, you want to find a den
[14:04.160 --> 14:08.080]  of devils, that's where you find them, a lot of good churches too.
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.960]  And so, the world is coming against it, you've seen a hundred plus percent increase in persecution
[14:12.960 --> 14:16.560]  to Christians, just the last decade, more than half of all the people persecuted in
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.320]  the world are Christians.
[14:20.320 --> 14:25.480]  And it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and
[14:25.480 --> 14:31.160]  they show a picture of Trump and say, let's get rid of the white people.
[14:31.160 --> 14:36.240]  Infowars.com story, and that's another article today out of the college fix, professor teaches
[14:36.240 --> 14:40.000]  students about the problem that is whiteness, they always say it's a professor, that's caught
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.040]  campus-wide, college-wide, worldwide, again you say, but that's the antithesis of what
[14:45.040 --> 14:51.280]  Martin Luther King said, that's the point, Christians forced the end of slavery, Christians
[14:51.280 --> 14:59.920]  forced the end of segregation, Christians actually did have the quote, white man's burden
[14:59.920 --> 15:03.240]  that Christians in Europe had written about, but that that turned around is arrogant and
[15:03.240 --> 15:06.680]  bad and everything, because the industrialists and the globalists did not want that, they
[15:06.680 --> 15:08.520]  did not want to treat people equally.
[15:08.520 --> 15:15.080]  So, they came in, took over that movement, hyperded up into political correctness as
[15:15.080 --> 15:19.480]  political control to turn everybody into their own racial ghettos and groups, where I mean
[15:19.480 --> 15:26.360]  I never grew up around racism, I never heard it, saw it, now it's everywhere, by all sides.
[15:26.360 --> 15:32.640]  And again, this is the victory of social engineering, you read the WikiLeaks, it says, we're losing
[15:32.640 --> 15:35.480]  control of the public, we can't keep them in the dark anymore, we've got to keep them
[15:35.480 --> 15:40.240]  desperate, we've got to accelerate the culture wars, I mean there are quotes, I've written
[15:40.240 --> 15:44.800]  articles about it, we've shown you the WikiLeaks, you can go read them for yourself, it's the
[15:44.800 --> 15:48.800]  heads of the Democratic Party saying we're losing control, we've got to intensify the
[15:48.800 --> 15:54.800]  racial division, I mean it is like KKK leaders, when you watch MSNBC but they're black and
[15:54.800 --> 16:00.600]  they're Hispanic and they're white, so I thought I'd just kick off with that today, because
[16:00.600 --> 16:05.480]  it illustrates what we're dealing with, Atlantic Monthly is as elitist as you get, New Yorker
[16:05.480 --> 16:11.720]  Magazine, Financial Times of London, Public Affairs, Foreign Affairs, those are the four
[16:11.720 --> 16:19.640]  or five publications that really tell you what they think and it is just unbelievable.
[16:19.640 --> 16:24.120]  They have Robert P. Jones in there openly saying you'll never stop us, we're going to
[16:24.120 --> 16:28.320]  end the white people and we're going to end the Christianity, there it is, Clinton campaign
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.640]  email outlines effort to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry and you read into
[16:32.640 --> 16:38.960]  these emails it says we've got to use culture war, they're doing it, couple more cops over
[16:38.960 --> 16:43.800]  the weekend got shot and another one got shot yesterday in the back of the head, sitting
[16:43.800 --> 16:50.480]  in their inner squad car in unprovoked attack, pretty powerful that CNN and MSNBC can put
[16:50.480 --> 16:55.600]  out those memes, put out those ideas and then see it happen and then tell police, you let
[16:55.600 --> 17:00.600]  strong cities take over, you let the UN run your police accountability boards, we'll stop
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.280]  the killing, it's called terrorism ladies and gentlemen, doesn't mean the police are perfect,
[17:05.280 --> 17:10.120]  no, but they're from our towns and our cities and there's checks and balances and we can
[17:10.120 --> 17:14.720]  reform it, the globalists aren't coming in to quote, save us from the police to take
[17:14.720 --> 17:20.720]  care of us, they want control of the police, you think we've got tyrannical police, underglobalist,
[17:20.720 --> 17:25.720]  under modern liberalism, 50 times worse, like Berkeley where they let everybody get beat
[17:25.720 --> 17:32.040]  up with tire arms and bike locks and people putting you know, comas and the police laughing
[17:32.040 --> 17:36.500]  do nothing, oh now Berkeley's being sued, they're all upset about all the free speech
[17:36.500 --> 17:41.520]  suits and racketeering suits, look, you guys are engaged in criminal activity, but I guess
[17:41.520 --> 17:47.040]  places like Berkeley and UC and all the rest of it's run by the Politano, former head of
[17:47.040 --> 17:54.080]  Homeland Security, so everything's okay, right, so all of that said, I'm going to go to break
[17:54.080 --> 17:57.200]  here in a few minutes, we're going to come back and play a bunch of clips, CNN rocked
[17:57.200 --> 18:03.320]  by a huge backlash after blackmail's creator of Trump's CNN meme, here's what the 2008
[18:03.320 --> 18:08.600]  Olympic gender regulations look like, they've officially said men can compete as women, women
[18:08.600 --> 18:18.320]  can compete as men, but in every sport, but shooting, every sport, but shooting, men are
[18:18.320 --> 18:22.320]  faster, stronger and will win in every group, I mean, it's not even debatable, the Olympic
[18:22.320 --> 18:30.560]  men out there, 99.99999999% of men can't compete, it's mainly genetic, a lot of them have extra
[18:30.560 --> 18:34.240]  chromosomes and stuff, there's a lot of disorders where you get extra chromosomes folks, you're
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.000]  not mentally retarded, you're Superman, you also tend to strangle your wife and children
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.680]  or whatever, but the point is, is that a lot of those guys are superhuman, you're going
[18:43.680 --> 18:48.360]  to stack them up against women, when a lot of the women have extra Ys or extra Xs, there's
[18:48.360 --> 18:55.200]  always different disorders, I mean, those aren't normal people to begin with, but you've
[18:55.200 --> 19:02.520]  got the guy that continues to win all the Olympic racing in the women's, and he's a
[19:02.520 --> 19:09.800]  guy, he even has a wee-wee, but I think this is hilarious, watch them all destroy, oh you
[19:09.800 --> 19:13.880]  hate transgender, I could care less if you think you're a man or a woman, with all the
[19:13.880 --> 19:21.480]  chemicals in the food and water, it's ubiquitous, the issue is that men compete, women compete,
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.600]  they're getting rid of the genders to depopulate, to confuse, to destroy, what about letting
[19:26.600 --> 19:31.800]  straight people have their lives, what about letting straight fish have their lives, new
[19:31.800 --> 19:37.040]  articles out today, the Associated Press and RT, that the majority of fish in U.S. rivers
[19:37.040 --> 19:41.880]  and lakes, the majority now are bisexual, that is they have male and female organs,
[19:41.880 --> 19:46.680]  but then most of them can't breed, they're sterile, now see, our sperm counts is down
[19:46.680 --> 19:52.080]  about 90%, see, the big issue is we're being sterilized, we're being exterminated, and
[19:52.080 --> 19:56.040]  the big victory folks is, I've taken the heat, you've taken the heat, we've now forced the

[24:19.120 --> 24:31.880]  We're here live.
[24:31.880 --> 24:36.760]  Roger Stone is popping in with Inside Intel on the White House and the scandals and the
[24:36.760 --> 24:39.320]  attempts to bring down the president coming up.
[24:39.320 --> 24:44.320]  And then we're going to have another guest on who exposed a month ago that 17 agencies
[24:44.320 --> 24:48.680]  never unanimously came out and said that the Russians influenced our election.
[24:48.680 --> 24:52.640]  And even though the New York Times was forced to admit that was all fake last week, they're
[24:52.640 --> 24:58.280]  still running with the proof that Russians stole the election.
[24:58.280 --> 25:03.400]  And Robert Mueller, the lie detector, he will be the arbiter of all truth.
[25:03.400 --> 25:06.480]  The arrogance is insane.
[25:06.480 --> 25:10.480]  So that's coming up with a journalist that first began to break that Ford zero hedge
[25:10.480 --> 25:12.240]  via consortium news.
[25:12.240 --> 25:16.240]  But let me start getting to this and then I'm going to get into North Korea as well
[25:16.240 --> 25:19.560]  after Stone leaves us, but that's that's a big issue right there.
[25:19.560 --> 25:20.560]  People have been hearing about it forever.
[25:20.560 --> 25:24.640]  But just because you hear about getting cancer when you're a little kid and you think, oh,
[25:24.640 --> 25:25.640]  that'll never happen to me.
[25:25.640 --> 25:27.400]  And then you're 60 years old and you get it.
[25:27.400 --> 25:32.080]  It's been what's almost 60 years since the ceasefire in Korea.
[25:32.080 --> 25:35.520]  And all the experts agree it's pregnant for war.
[25:35.520 --> 25:37.320]  Kim Jong-un's out of control.
[25:37.320 --> 25:39.000]  He's disconnected from reality.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.640]  China has no control anymore.
[25:40.640 --> 25:43.480]  He's firing missiles at everybody, threatening a nuke everybody.
[25:43.480 --> 25:47.040]  Japan doesn't ever evacuate major cities in either the South Korea.
[25:47.040 --> 25:49.200]  They've been evacuating for weeks.
[25:49.200 --> 25:51.440]  The weapons are building up.
[25:51.440 --> 25:52.440]  I'm going to get to that.
[25:52.440 --> 25:56.000]  I'm going to talk about what a strike on North Korea will look like.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.280]  Believe me, they're going to roll out the high powered radiation weapons.
[26:00.280 --> 26:02.280]  They've got radiation beams.
[26:02.280 --> 26:06.160]  They've got, I mean, they got some sci-fi, when I say they, the globalists that have
[26:06.160 --> 26:07.360]  been running this country.
[26:07.360 --> 26:10.840]  That's why they're so upset that Trump is now in power of all that and they've got
[26:10.840 --> 26:15.000]  agencies desperately trying to keep their people in so Trump doesn't become aware of
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.240]  all this stuff and have a chance to audit it all.
[26:18.240 --> 26:23.480]  But just search into the term neutron bomb and then it'll bring you to the whole class
[26:23.480 --> 26:25.280]  of stuff that's been around since the fifties.
[26:25.280 --> 26:27.880]  It's way more advanced right now.
[26:27.880 --> 26:30.600]  But I said I'll get to that later.
[26:30.600 --> 26:33.560]  I'm kind of getting to it now.
[26:33.560 --> 26:35.560]  CNN is just off its rocker.
[26:35.560 --> 26:39.120]  I don't have time to eclipse this segment, but I'll get to it after Stone leaves this.
[26:39.120 --> 26:41.160]  Do these headlines on infowars.com.
[26:41.160 --> 26:47.560]  CNN rocked by huge backlash after it blackmills creator of Trump's CNN meme.
[26:47.560 --> 26:52.320]  It's clearly a joke in response to CNN's host saying kill Trump, their guest saying kill
[26:52.320 --> 26:57.960]  Trump, financing plays where Trump's killed, Kathy Griffin simulating his murder, all these
[26:57.960 --> 27:01.840]  politicians calling for Trump's death saying somebody should kill him, the media celebrating
[27:01.840 --> 27:07.600]  people to try to kill him, calling for all this violence, doing all this, and then you
[27:07.600 --> 27:14.520]  have a fun little smackdown deal based on a fake fight with Vince McMahon and Donald
[27:14.520 --> 27:16.600]  Trump years ago.
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.320]  And then they say we forced him and we threatened him.
[27:20.320 --> 27:23.320]  I'll play one of the clips now.
[27:23.320 --> 27:29.120]  We told him this anonymous Reddit user that if you didn't apologize and pull it and tell
[27:29.120 --> 27:33.840]  folks to pull it, that we would destroy you and say you're racist because you're on Reddit.
[27:33.840 --> 27:38.160]  So you got a multi-billion-dollar corporation threatening some anonymous person, so they
[27:38.160 --> 27:44.000]  follow the threat, they remove it with lawyer speak in a statement.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.280]  Now look, you can say we're going to expose you and then hope somebody takes it down,
[27:48.280 --> 27:51.680]  but no, they said you take this down or we're going to expose you.
[27:51.680 --> 27:55.920]  And we know this because CNN bragged about it breathlessly the last two days and had
[27:55.920 --> 28:00.280]  it their top story and weighed out the bottom was the emergency meetings at the UN in North
[28:00.280 --> 28:05.840]  Korea threatening to nuke Seoul, South Korea and Japan and threatening to hit Alaska.
[28:05.840 --> 28:10.040]  All that insane news wasn't even there because it was all Trump and how he was evil.
[28:10.040 --> 28:15.960]  Here's a clip, CNN's New Day, CNN promised not to identify pro-Trump Reddit user if
[28:15.960 --> 28:17.120]  he apologized.
[28:17.120 --> 28:22.640]  So we won't come after you if you remove your free speech.
[28:22.640 --> 28:26.400]  Pure bullying, Paul Watson has an article linking to federal and state law where it's
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.780]  racketeering, it's intimidation, it's coercion, it's a terroristic threat.
[28:30.780 --> 28:34.400]  This is a big bullying terrorist organization, my view.
[28:34.400 --> 28:36.400]  Here's the clip.
[28:36.400 --> 28:37.400]  Participation.
[28:37.400 --> 28:40.200]  Okay, so another issue that came up here.
[28:40.200 --> 28:41.680]  Something remarkable I thought happened yesterday.
[28:41.680 --> 28:47.000]  I thought it was remarkable that CNN found this, the Reddit user who created the gift
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.160]  of Donald Trump in the wrestling video and where he punches CNN.
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.440]  So the investigative team went back and found the guy who first created this, he took credit
[28:56.440 --> 28:57.440]  for it.
[28:57.440 --> 29:00.720]  And then here comes the remarkable part, he apologized.
[29:00.720 --> 29:03.240]  He apologized for having done this.
[29:03.240 --> 29:10.600]  How often do you hear someone who creates a video that goes viral then say this?
[29:10.600 --> 29:11.920]  This is what he told CNN.
[29:11.920 --> 29:17.120]  I would like to apologize for the posts made that were racist, bigoted and anti-Semitic.
[29:17.120 --> 29:18.760]  These are the other posts that were on his account.
[29:18.760 --> 29:20.520]  I am in no way this kind of person.
[29:20.520 --> 29:24.640]  I would never support any kind of violence or actions against others simply for what they
[29:24.640 --> 29:29.320]  believe in, nor would I carry out any violence against anyone based upon that or support
[29:29.320 --> 29:30.320]  anyone who did.
[29:30.320 --> 29:31.320]  He went on.
[29:31.320 --> 29:32.320]  He was so...
[29:32.320 --> 29:34.320]  But then why is there so much stuff on his account?
[29:34.320 --> 29:35.320]  He's leaving it.
[29:35.320 --> 29:36.320]  Stop right there.
[29:36.320 --> 29:37.320]  We gotta go to break.
[29:37.320 --> 29:38.320]  See, they know this is everybody's free speech.
[29:38.320 --> 29:39.320]  Okay?
[29:39.320 --> 29:40.320]  But they wanna set the precedent.
[29:40.320 --> 29:44.680]  See, he apologizes, he admits it's wrong and then mix a bunch of things like anti-Semitism
[29:44.680 --> 29:45.680]  into it.
[29:45.680 --> 29:49.480]  Who knows if that's even a real account or a real person.
[29:49.480 --> 29:52.480]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:52.480 --> 29:54.280]  CNN's been caught lying so much.
[29:54.280 --> 29:55.280]  And the GCN radio news.
[29:55.280 --> 30:00.800]  Staging summoning events, I think it's all fake.
[30:00.800 --> 30:05.400]  The New York Times ran the headline, Central Americans Scared of What's Happening in U.S.
[30:05.400 --> 30:06.400]  Staying Put.
[30:06.400 --> 30:09.960]  This has been a popular talking point of the left aimed at demonizing President Trump's
[30:09.960 --> 30:11.400]  strong border policy.
[30:11.400 --> 30:15.040]  But think about the paradigm here, implying that somehow it is a bad thing that people
[30:15.040 --> 30:19.280]  aren't rushing to our country in droves because it's not easy to get in and reside here
[30:19.280 --> 30:20.520]  illegally anymore.
[30:20.520 --> 30:25.360]  The same people implying this also stress the hardship of poor people specifically citing
[30:25.360 --> 30:26.360]  health care.
[30:26.360 --> 30:30.200]  Well then how is more people here that are in need going to help that problem?
[30:30.200 --> 30:34.280]  So the Democrats complain all day about how we don't have enough welfare for Americans,
[30:34.280 --> 30:37.120]  yet they wanna take more people in here that need welfare.
[30:37.120 --> 30:40.920]  But really all President Trump is doing is enforcing border security and law.
[30:40.920 --> 30:43.560]  But since when is it just free for anyone to come here?
[30:43.560 --> 30:46.120]  Since when is America supposed to have open doors for anyone?
[30:46.120 --> 30:49.920]  I don't see anyone from North America rushing to get into Central America.
[30:49.920 --> 30:50.920]  You know why?
[30:50.920 --> 30:52.800]  Because you couldn't and it's better here.
[30:52.800 --> 30:57.320]  This all equates to one thing, more Democrats losing in upcoming elections.
[30:57.320 --> 31:00.320]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[31:00.320 --> 31:04.200]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[31:04.200 --> 31:07.080]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:07.080 --> 31:13.120]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:13.120 --> 31:18.080]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[31:18.080 --> 31:23.040]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[31:23.040 --> 31:28.160]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to the best job
[31:28.160 --> 31:29.880]  you can to purify your air.
[31:29.880 --> 31:34.920]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:34.920 --> 31:40.120]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves, the general public doesn't.
[31:40.120 --> 31:44.040]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:44.040 --> 31:47.680]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.680 --> 31:51.240]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:51.240 --> 31:54.440]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:54.440 --> 32:00.560]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[32:00.560 --> 32:06.560]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality Infowars Biome Defense
[32:06.560 --> 32:08.120]  Probiotic.

[32:14.840 --> 32:22.520]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[32:22.520 --> 32:27.480]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[32:27.480 --> 32:34.160]  23 different probiotics trains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[32:34.160 --> 32:38.720]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[32:38.720 --> 32:41.240]  probiotic on the market.
[32:41.240 --> 32:46.320]  Secure your Biome Defense in Ultra Strength or Regular Strength at InfowarsLife.com today
[32:46.320 --> 32:49.920]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[32:49.920 --> 32:53.440]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first round of the
[32:53.440 --> 33:17.120]  public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the Infowar.
[33:17.120 --> 33:24.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, live from the Infowars.com
[33:24.800 --> 33:27.640]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:27.640 --> 33:32.480]  All right, Roger Stone's popping in here with Inside Intel in the White House and major
[33:32.480 --> 33:37.080]  intrigue there and the next big shoes to drop here in a moment, but here's the type of news
[33:37.080 --> 33:42.400]  I have stacked up from mainstream media from their own quotes.
[33:42.400 --> 33:50.320]  Trans to make vaccination mandatory for 2018 as it is unacceptable children are still dying
[33:50.320 --> 33:51.320]  of measles.
[33:51.320 --> 33:53.640]  What, a couple of years?
[33:53.640 --> 33:58.680]  Meanwhile, vaccines have killed millions across the planet admittedly.
[33:58.680 --> 34:11.960]  Here's another one, Macaron declares he will govern like a Roman god.
[34:11.960 --> 34:20.480]  So again, Emmanuel Bonaparte, Macaron declares he will govern like a Roman god.
[34:20.480 --> 34:26.200]  French President Macaron has declared he will govern France like Jupiter.
[34:26.200 --> 34:30.160]  The Roman king of the gods, shortly after officials told the media his thought process
[34:30.160 --> 34:34.760]  was too complex, close quote for journalists to understand.
[34:34.760 --> 34:39.240]  This is the total mental illness insanity of the elites, literally saying let them eat
[34:39.240 --> 34:46.960]  cake as the Islamist Muslims pour in in mass, just like Obama a few days ago saying patriotism
[34:46.960 --> 34:47.960]  is dangerous.
[34:47.960 --> 34:51.480]  The fourth of July, getting to patriotic is not a good thing as he spoke in Indonesia.
[34:51.480 --> 34:55.400]  Remember, he's the guy that wouldn't put his hand over his heart.
[34:55.400 --> 34:57.480]  People thought it was just an accident.
[34:57.480 --> 35:01.160]  And all these different fourth of July events and other events that have been a Richardson
[35:01.160 --> 35:07.520]  would Hillary Clinton would just keep appearances, but Obama wouldn't.
[35:07.520 --> 35:16.760]  But the EU now is set next year to ban nationalist names of national football teams because it's
[35:16.760 --> 35:22.160]  hateful to have a French team or a Spanish team or a Greek team or a German team or an
[35:22.160 --> 35:23.160]  English team.
[35:23.160 --> 35:24.160]  That's right.
[35:24.160 --> 35:26.720]  They're even saying, you know, the British flags racist, you can't have that out.
[35:26.720 --> 35:30.480]  It's offensive to Muslims and I have a whole stack of news.
[35:30.480 --> 35:34.320]  Austria deploys military to Italian border as migrant crisis explodes.
[35:34.320 --> 35:40.840]  First up on info wars.com, linking to AFP and the Associated Press by by locals, Europe
[35:40.840 --> 35:47.880]  city centers around alarm again, Europe cities centers sound the alarm that there aren't
[35:47.880 --> 35:51.840]  any Germans or French or anybody left AFP and then they're not welcome.
[35:51.840 --> 35:52.840]  It's no go zones.
[35:52.840 --> 35:53.840]  Wow.
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.040]  You mean people that aren't white connect races to Oh, in fact, just as just as much so or
[35:58.040 --> 35:59.040]  even more so.
[35:59.040 --> 36:01.320]  There's no Christian background.
[36:01.320 --> 36:05.240]  The future of multicultural Europe, German city with the most immigrants also has the
[36:05.240 --> 36:10.480]  most crime 60% believe Islam is incompatible with French society.
[36:10.480 --> 36:11.480]  Well, don't worry.
[36:11.480 --> 36:16.880]  Once your brain damage from enough vaccines, you won't care.
[36:16.880 --> 36:22.960]  Over 5,000 cases of female general mutilation in England over the past year alone as they
[36:22.960 --> 36:27.160]  cut full grown women's journals off, but that's okay.
[36:27.160 --> 36:30.360]  It's Muslim and Bill Gates finally says something I agree with.
[36:30.360 --> 36:34.200]  Bill Gates warns Angela Merkel's open door migrant policy has left Europe at breaking
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.440]  point and calls on leaders to stem the flow from Africa, but but he's been pushing this
[36:38.440 --> 36:42.360]  before but he says it's going to cause a rebellion and that they're going to lose control.
[36:42.360 --> 36:46.120]  He's only saying that because they've pushed too far.
[36:46.120 --> 36:55.240]  So old Billy boy is going to play the savior Isis cornered in Mosul as Iraq prepares victory
[36:55.240 --> 36:56.240]  celebrations.
[36:56.240 --> 37:03.240]  That's right, Trump and our US military, but his leadership has almost smashed Isis that
[37:03.240 --> 37:08.600]  Obama and the globalists created.
[37:08.600 --> 37:13.760]  And so now it's coming time for Assad to do what he said he do to the US military five
[37:13.760 --> 37:15.680]  years ago in secret negotiations.
[37:15.680 --> 37:19.880]  I first broke Cyhurst confirmed on this show three years later gave us the credit not bragging
[37:19.880 --> 37:23.600]  and just were the opposite of fake news is why they're so scared of us and lie about us
[37:23.600 --> 37:28.280]  and say things we didn't say because we have the sources that came on who had the courage.
[37:28.280 --> 37:29.280]  We have the platform.
[37:29.280 --> 37:37.080]  We'll put it out that Obama and NATO were behind the whole Arab Spring, the whole invasion
[37:37.080 --> 37:38.080]  force, all of it.
[37:38.080 --> 37:41.320]  Our military said Assad, you want to go back to England, don't you weren't even raised
[37:41.320 --> 37:42.320]  here.
[37:42.320 --> 37:43.320]  Your dad was a dictator.
[37:43.320 --> 37:44.320]  You're trying to democratize.
[37:44.320 --> 37:49.120]  They've used that as a way to take over your country, agree to leave and hold elections
[37:49.120 --> 37:55.080]  when we kick ISIS al Qaeda out and we will look we will we will not help al Qaeda and
[37:55.080 --> 37:56.080]  ISIS take over.
[37:56.080 --> 38:00.320]  That was our military's compromise against Obama.
[38:00.320 --> 38:04.320]  And now we're here five years later and it's time for Assad.
[38:04.320 --> 38:09.120]  He made that agreement to begin to segue out.
[38:09.120 --> 38:10.800]  That's the agreement he made.
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.000]  And that's what Trump is with Assad want to know the inside baseball.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  That's it.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.000]  Is that really the right thing to do?
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  They didn't start the war.
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.600]  Well, the Russians are there and they made that agreement with us bilaterally, I guess
[38:22.600 --> 38:24.160]  trilaterally three countries involved.
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.240]  We're going to Roger Stone, who just got his Skype up just briefly here.
[38:28.240 --> 38:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to apologize.
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.520]  We've got a fourth hour where it's kind of been a beta testing for talk show host like
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.480]  Paul Watson, like Roger Stone, who've all done a great job, Paul so busy and travel
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.840]  so much he gets his schedule messed up sometimes and for that you lie was a holiday.
[38:45.840 --> 38:50.080]  So he couldn't do the show live and I thought, well, just move him to the next day.
[38:50.080 --> 38:51.080]  Not thinking that's Roger's day.
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.520]  So I'm going to go ahead and just say Roger, if he still has time, can host the fourth
[38:54.520 --> 38:57.680]  hour today and we'll get Paul to just come back next week.
[38:57.680 --> 39:01.720]  But soon, very soon, I keep saying a month, a month, a month because we're so busy.
[39:01.720 --> 39:06.360]  We're very close out from launching a morning show, an afternoon show and a nighttime show
[39:06.360 --> 39:09.280]  that are going to be syndicated to our radio affiliates and we'll have the classic clock.
[39:09.280 --> 39:12.920]  I'm going to change my clock and work with GCN on that to the standard where we come
[39:12.920 --> 39:14.720]  in live at six after not eight after.
[39:14.720 --> 39:16.280]  A lot of exciting things.
[39:16.280 --> 39:20.920]  I've got like 40 something affiliates ready to come on on top of our 200 or so as soon
[39:20.920 --> 39:22.280]  as I change the clock.
[39:22.280 --> 39:26.040]  So I'm letting stations know now that the next month we're going to be doing this stuff
[39:26.040 --> 39:27.720]  show the clock's now ticking.
[39:27.720 --> 39:28.720]  It's happening.
[39:28.720 --> 39:29.960]  The cruise been hired.
[39:29.960 --> 39:32.200]  The people are in place.
[39:32.200 --> 39:34.400]  So very, very exciting that all of this is about to launch.
[39:34.400 --> 39:35.400]  We're going to have Mike Cernovich.
[39:35.400 --> 39:36.400]  We're going to have Roger Stone.
[39:36.400 --> 39:38.440]  We're going to have Paul Watson, hopefully hosting more.
[39:38.440 --> 39:40.600]  I'm going to try to get a lot of other folks on board.
[39:40.600 --> 39:41.840]  We're very, very excited about this.
[39:41.840 --> 39:43.360]  The stations are waiting.
[39:43.360 --> 39:49.040]  We're king of the internet, but also we need to be kings of AM and FM radio still giant
[39:49.040 --> 39:50.040]  audiences there.
[39:50.040 --> 39:54.000]  And that's really kind of one of our secrets as we have that audience.
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.720]  Now Stone Cold Truth.com's website bestselling author, the making of the president.
[39:58.720 --> 40:00.560]  Also he's written bestselling books on the Kennedy assassination.
[40:00.560 --> 40:01.840]  We'll go to him in a moment.
[40:01.840 --> 40:08.920]  But first, drumroll please, ladies and gentlemen, Myco ZX sold out for five plus months.
[40:08.920 --> 40:15.200]  The ultimate probiotic that knocks out the bad fungus, the mold, the other garbage.
[40:15.200 --> 40:18.680]  It goes like a horse and carriage with the classic probiotics.
[40:18.680 --> 40:27.160]  We have the best out there, biome defense, but Myco ZX anti-fungal, anti-yeast, anti-candida.
[40:27.160 --> 40:30.560]  I mean, this is an epidemic out there.

[40:48.400 --> 40:49.840]  makes the broadcast possible.
[40:49.840 --> 40:52.280]  But here's the big news.
[40:52.280 --> 40:58.040]  Sold out for four months because it's so hard to source it that it's got to be tested and
[40:58.040 --> 41:03.480]  it's got to be California level standards, which is almost impossible.
[41:03.480 --> 41:10.520]  The only organically produced, when I say organically, I mean from an organism.
[41:10.520 --> 41:13.880]  Everything else is synthetic and still costs $50 a bottle for Crud.
[41:13.880 --> 41:20.880]  We have from Mitsubishi America, the only true bio PQQ, you go to the store and nobody's
[41:20.880 --> 41:22.080]  got this.
[41:22.080 --> 41:23.080]  We've got it.
[41:23.080 --> 41:24.080]  It's nutraceutical level.
[41:24.080 --> 41:25.080]  I say we have it.
[41:25.080 --> 41:31.080]  You doctors sell it in clinics, but the point is DNA force is not a drug.
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.800]  It is bio PQQ, CoQ 10 and all these other things that work synergistically together
[41:35.800 --> 41:36.800]  and out of the gates.
[41:36.800 --> 41:41.520]  It's 20% off, even though it is just now back in stock and sells out all the time.

[42:46.960 --> 42:53.920]  of the Trump campaign and Trump confident for 43 years, Roger Stone and Roger has got
[42:53.920 --> 42:59.240]  a new article going up on info wars.com as we speak.
[42:59.240 --> 43:04.120]  This is exclusive info on not the height but what really happened behind the scenes with
[43:04.120 --> 43:09.120]  psycho Joe and of course the daughter to one of the most famous war criminals ever, Mika
[43:09.120 --> 43:15.640]  Brzezinski, her late father, of course, making the jump into hell or wherever he went.
[43:15.640 --> 43:16.720]  So it's really behind the scenes.
[43:16.720 --> 43:20.600]  I talked to a rock star friend, he said he's been on the morning Joe before for charities
[43:20.600 --> 43:25.960]  and stuff, and that she won't talk to anyone and treats her crew like crap, Joe's nice
[43:25.960 --> 43:28.520]  on the surface, but this is a monstrous woman.
[43:28.520 --> 43:31.440]  So the truth behind that and the inside intrigue.
[43:31.440 --> 43:32.960]  And then we've got news on North Korea.
[43:32.960 --> 43:38.520]  We've got news on the whole Russia gate thing falling apart to 17 agencies, never agreeing
[43:38.520 --> 43:40.400]  that Russia was even involved.
[43:40.400 --> 43:42.280]  The whole house of cards coming down.
[43:42.280 --> 43:45.760]  So what comes next, Roger stone of stone cold truth.com.
[43:45.760 --> 43:47.560]  Thanks for joining us.
[43:47.560 --> 43:53.040]  Alex, in the, you know, even though we went through the holidays, so very much has happened
[43:53.040 --> 43:59.280]  politically in just the last few days and I think it's it's extraordinarily significant.
[43:59.280 --> 44:07.960]  Mika, of course, and Joe spend an enormous amount of time brown nosing Donald Trump both
[44:07.960 --> 44:14.720]  before, during and after his campaign for president during certainly the time of his
[44:14.720 --> 44:24.080]  being president elect, but, you know, they had then turned on the him like a pack of
[44:24.080 --> 44:34.160]  vicious dogs, calling him a goon, a thug, a dictator, mentally deficient, you know,
[44:34.160 --> 44:41.160]  crazy insane, Alzheimer's, by the way, you broke that months ago on the street and awesome
[44:41.160 --> 44:45.280]  people can pull it up next attack will be that he has Alzheimer's or is insane.
[44:45.280 --> 44:46.640]  No one else was saying that.
[44:46.640 --> 44:48.040]  How did you get that intel?
[44:48.040 --> 44:54.760]  Well, I mean, look, it is kind of something that I will have to attribute to sources.
[44:54.760 --> 44:56.600]  Let me not get distracted.
[44:56.600 --> 45:08.880]  Mika now claims that it was she who recommended to Ivanka Trump the hiring of Dina Habib Powell.
[45:08.880 --> 45:15.680]  For those who have followed this on info wars where I had an extensive piece on Ms. Dina
[45:15.680 --> 45:25.800]  Habib Powell, this woman is a Soros infiltrator in the White House of Donald J. Trump.
[45:25.800 --> 45:36.120]  She is an unabashed neocon, best friends with with Huma Abedin, best friends with Valerie
[45:36.120 --> 45:41.400]  Jarrett, best friends with a condi rice.
[45:41.400 --> 45:44.960]  She is a Bush alum.
[45:44.960 --> 45:52.160]  She is a council on foreign relations and her she is currently single.
[45:52.160 --> 45:55.720]  The Powell incredibly is Richard Powell.
[45:55.720 --> 46:01.480]  Now let's follow that if we may Richard Powell is the chairman of Tanao.
[46:01.480 --> 46:08.840]  Tanao is the front, the consulting company, multi-billion dollar consulting company put
[46:08.840 --> 46:16.240]  together so Bill Clinton can loot during the period of his former presidency.
[46:16.240 --> 46:25.040]  Powell therefore works for the Clintons and in essence, Tanao is their holding company.
[46:25.040 --> 46:27.400]  Who else is on this payroll?
[46:27.400 --> 46:34.240]  Well, Alex, it turns out that Huma Abedin, best friend of Dina Powell, she's getting
[46:34.240 --> 46:44.120]  a check while she's on the State Department and the Clinton library or I should say foundation
[46:44.120 --> 46:51.680]  payrolls a financial triple dip for which she actually has a waiver from the federal
[46:51.680 --> 46:56.120]  government under Obama that she can do.
[46:56.120 --> 46:59.680]  Talk about fixing at the highest levels.
[46:59.680 --> 47:07.840]  This is also where Ed Rollins, punitively a Republican, but one of Donald Trump's harshest
[47:07.840 --> 47:10.440]  critics in the Republican Party.
[47:10.440 --> 47:11.440]  So here's the bottom line.
[47:11.440 --> 47:14.560]  She is meeting in the Hamptons.
[47:14.560 --> 47:15.560]  We talked about this yesterday.
[47:15.560 --> 47:18.960]  We both worked a lot yesterday is because I mean, that's a pleasure to work for the
[47:18.960 --> 47:25.280]  Republican freedom and defeat these people, you know, obviously, even on the holiday.
[47:25.280 --> 47:30.400]  She is a Soros operative in every sense of the word inside the White House.
[47:30.400 --> 47:34.880]  And the the the president needs to know this and we need to politically neutralize her.
[47:34.880 --> 47:36.680]  So when is your article coming to infowars?
[47:36.680 --> 47:41.320]  Well, let me give you the other moving parts here it now that Mika has come forward to
[47:41.320 --> 47:48.400]  say that she went to Ivanka to place Powell and Powell was hired and then quickly elevated
[47:48.400 --> 47:53.200]  from the job she was hired from, which was relatively short to being the number two
[47:53.200 --> 48:01.080]  person in the NSA, basically the right hand woman of General McMaster, who sadly is turning
[48:01.080 --> 48:04.880]  out to be more in their camp than ours.
[48:04.880 --> 48:05.880]  Amazing.
[48:05.880 --> 48:11.720]  Secondarily, it means that Powell lied because publicly, she has always claimed that the
[48:11.720 --> 48:18.160]  administration recruited her that Ivanka out of the blue called her and recruited her for
[48:18.160 --> 48:19.440]  this job.
[48:19.440 --> 48:21.440]  We now know that Mika fixed it.
[48:21.440 --> 48:27.280]  Sean Hannity made this charge in public, put it up on a tweet, correctly said, if this
[48:27.280 --> 48:31.240]  is true, Powell should be fired for lying.
[48:31.240 --> 48:37.320]  And then out of the blue, Anthony Scaramucci, a good man comes to her defense and puts up
[48:37.320 --> 48:43.520]  a tweet that says no, no, Dina is a good conservative, the furthest thing from the truth.
[48:43.520 --> 48:51.400]  And then the the New York Post and the Daily and the other social media pick up that Dina
[48:51.400 --> 48:58.880]  is hobnobbing in the Hamptons with none other than the big man, the big enchilada of anti-democracy
[48:58.880 --> 49:05.160]  forces around the planet, George Soros, only last weekend.
[49:05.160 --> 49:08.960]  What is this woman doing in the Trump White House?
[49:08.960 --> 49:09.960]  So let's be clear.
[49:09.960 --> 49:12.120]  You know, she's got this Islamic last name.
[49:12.120 --> 49:13.360]  She's hooked in with the globalist.
[49:13.360 --> 49:15.600]  She's a right hand person of Soros.
[49:15.600 --> 49:19.520]  She's hooked in with McMaster, the Warhawk, and then she's in the Hamptons hanging out
[49:19.520 --> 49:20.520]  with Soros.
[49:20.520 --> 49:25.080]  She goes up in the local papers.
[49:25.080 --> 49:26.600]  This is absolutely crazy.
[49:26.600 --> 49:31.080]  Why the Trump State Department still loves George Soros, even the New York Post understands
[49:31.080 --> 49:32.080]  this.
[49:32.080 --> 49:34.240]  This is sensational.
[49:34.240 --> 49:35.680]  Tell us about this lady's pedigree.
[49:35.680 --> 49:40.400]  Well, first of all, I think it speaks out absolutely right to the larger issue of what
[49:40.400 --> 49:46.960]  is happening at state under Tillerson and what they're trying to do out of the NSA to
[49:46.960 --> 49:54.080]  grab foreign policy and take it back to the path of neocon war.
[49:54.080 --> 50:04.360]  We know that McMaster, probably backed by the defense secretary, backed 150,000 troops
[50:04.360 --> 50:10.400]  on the ground in Syria right after the limited strike, and the president wisely, one of the
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.760]  best decisions he's made, said, no, that's not what we're doing.
[50:14.760 --> 50:22.960]  So we know that there's this clique, and I think they are, as I reported here on InfoWars,
[50:22.960 --> 50:29.320]  in complete and total control of our U.S. embassies in Romania and Hungary.
[50:29.320 --> 50:36.840]  We're going to go to break and come back with more of this, but Trump's having trouble
[50:36.840 --> 50:41.560]  digging them out because they're coming back in through his administration at the top and
[50:41.560 --> 50:46.280]  the bottom, a total George Soros arrogant infiltration.
[50:46.280 --> 50:51.520]  So how does Trump remove these cancers from the State Department?
[50:51.520 --> 50:55.240]  And is the bottom line, Rex Tillerson is a double agent from the beginning?
[50:55.240 --> 50:56.240]  We'll be back.
[50:56.240 --> 50:57.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[50:57.240 --> 51:04.720]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[51:04.720 --> 51:09.080]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[51:09.080 --> 51:12.880]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[51:12.880 --> 51:15.880]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[51:15.880 --> 51:19.720]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[51:19.720 --> 51:22.560]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[51:22.560 --> 51:26.680]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[51:26.680 --> 51:30.840]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[51:30.840 --> 51:36.120]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[51:36.120 --> 51:40.620]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long lasting
[51:40.620 --> 51:41.920]  food on hand.
[51:41.920 --> 51:45.240]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[51:45.240 --> 51:46.960]  We love our freeze dryer.
[51:46.960 --> 51:53.360]  To learn more, go to harvestright.com or call 800-923-9591.

[51:59.480 --> 52:07.620]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[52:07.620 --> 52:12.920]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[52:12.920 --> 52:13.920]  and high quality.

[52:20.120 --> 52:23.080]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[52:23.080 --> 52:27.560]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.

[54:22.800 --> 54:43.120]  Alright, Roger Stone's our guest coming up in the next hour ringing to the whole Russian
[54:43.120 --> 54:47.000]  narrative completely collapsing and I don't do like MSM does where they just say what
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.480]  they want to believe and act like it becomes true.
[54:49.480 --> 54:54.800]  Which totally collapsed, 17 agencies didn't say the Russians meddled, that was a hoax,
[54:54.800 --> 54:59.280]  the whole thing's derailed, it's all fallen apart, now Podesta's saying the conspiracy
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.000]  theory that he's involved with the Russians came from Info Wars, they've gone into total
[55:03.000 --> 55:10.680]  panic mode but getting back with Roger Stone to the issue of Ms. Powell there in the State
[55:10.680 --> 55:15.440]  Department with Rex Tillerson, we can put the news article up, it's in multiple New
[55:15.440 --> 55:22.880]  York newspapers, that we've got this lady at Soros parties with Jared and Ivanka as
[55:22.880 --> 55:23.880]  well.
[55:23.880 --> 55:29.080]  Ivanka, Trump, Jared Kushner, Chelley and Conway spotted at Washington Post Editors
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.720]  Hampton's party with George Soros and all those people, now I understand at that level
[55:33.720 --> 55:39.880]  of New York you're going to cross paths but then we're seeing the action of not removing
[55:39.880 --> 55:45.920]  Soros people, in fact putting them in as Roger Stone was just saying, this is just crazy,
[55:45.920 --> 55:54.120]  I mean George Soros is trying to openly destroy Trump, how is this happening, Roger Stone?
[55:54.120 --> 56:00.640]  Extraordinary question Alex, I mean first of all has been reported this week, the U.S.
[56:00.640 --> 56:07.640]  State Department continues to fund with our tax dollars the ongoing efforts of George
[56:07.640 --> 56:16.040]  Soros to destabilize Donald Trump and his administration, democracy in general to crush
[56:16.040 --> 56:26.640]  free expression using Alinsky thug tactics, shady financing, mob rule, instigation of
[56:26.640 --> 56:33.640]  violence, this man is a criminal, he is attempting to overturn the legitimately elected government
[56:33.640 --> 56:41.080]  of Romania, he is attempting to overturn the legitimately, democratically U.S. recognized
[56:41.080 --> 56:49.840]  government of Hungary, he is an international criminal, he is exporting violence as a political
[56:49.840 --> 56:50.840]  tool.
[56:50.840 --> 56:55.480]  The last James Bond character was admittedly based on him, the last supervillain.
[56:55.480 --> 57:00.880]  Yeah, I don't know if he really sits around with a white cat and just strokes it or whether
[57:00.880 --> 57:08.880]  that part is made up, but look this guy beat his girlfriend in New York City in an altercation,
[57:08.880 --> 57:15.000]  any other citizen, any other man who did that would have been arrested and prosecuted, puff
[57:15.000 --> 57:23.720]  gone, he has paid people to advocate the assassination of Donald Trump, felony, federal
[57:23.720 --> 57:28.760]  crime on that charge alone, he could be charged.
[57:28.760 --> 57:32.560]  Let me ask you this, the shifting gears quickly, you've been called a Russian agent, no evidence,
[57:32.560 --> 57:37.720]  it's completely collapsed, but still they just keep pushing the corpse, but from polls
[57:37.720 --> 57:42.840]  I see no one's buying it, how long will the Russian dead horse keep getting beaten?
[57:42.840 --> 57:49.720]  Well, what's happened now I am told is that the NSA and others in the deep state have
[57:49.720 --> 57:54.880]  a new focus on the, since they can find nothing on the president, there's a new focus on the
[57:54.880 --> 58:02.800]  Trump children, Donnie Jr., who I think very highly of, who's a real fighter and a real
[58:02.800 --> 58:04.800]  believer in the cause of it.
[58:04.800 --> 58:08.000]  And the word is he's about the best thing we've got other than pop.
[58:08.000 --> 58:14.240]  He's a great guy and he's a great advocate for his father and his father's policies.
[58:14.240 --> 58:19.120]  Eric, who I think is also very effective, and of course I have long affection for Ivanka
[58:19.120 --> 58:26.800]  despite the fact that I think socially, unfortunately, perhaps her thinking is shaped by some on
[58:26.800 --> 58:33.520]  the left in all honesty, and I have been critics of both Jared and Ivanka on occasion.
[58:33.520 --> 58:37.160]  But Alex, I think they think they're giving the president good advice.
[58:37.160 --> 58:41.120]  I agree, stay there, back at 70, do five more minutes with us and then you gotta go.
[58:41.120 --> 58:45.160]  Second hour's coming up, please spread the word listeners, you're the reason we're growing.
[58:45.160 --> 58:52.160]  If we don't grow though, we're gonna shrink and be destroyed, we need your help.
[58:52.160 --> 58:56.640]  Let's go to Debit in Florida, Debit in Florida, you're on the air.

[59:15.480 --> 59:17.160]  Which pharmaceutical does you like best?
[59:17.160 --> 59:21.880]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest, that's really incredible.
[59:21.880 --> 59:26.440]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt sweet.

[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:33.120]  civilization type guys, have victory laps.
[1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:41.040]  But I can't even keep track of all the CNN, ABC, NBC, AP, New York Times, Washington Post
[1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:44.840]  retractions because they're getting sued left and right, where they just put out a whole
[1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:45.840]  cloth made up garbage.
[1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:51.160]  I mean, when they say they have proof that not only am I a Russian agent, I direct the
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:52.160]  Russians.
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:56.360]  I mean, that is just totally ridiculous.
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:01.120]  Well, now it's all coming out, and we've got a guest coming up who was the journalist
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:05.800]  first really exposing it from Consortium News and Zero Hedge, that they've known from the
[1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:08.640]  beginning 17 agencies didn't unanimously say this.
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:09.800]  They've pushed this live.
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:10.800]  That's crumbled now.
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:16.120]  I mean, where does MSGM go now that they are just the most discredited, hated bullies
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:17.640]  on earth, Roger Stone?
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:22.880]  Well, as I said, Alex, I hear there's a new targeting of the Trump children to see if there
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:27.760]  is some tangible Russian connection there, which I think is relatively ludicrous.
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:31.680]  I mean, all three of them are international business people.
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:37.360]  I'm sure they have met people from Russia that proves nothing whatsoever.
[1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:41.480]  But that's how I desperate, I think, that they are.
[1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:51.080]  I also think that just to go back to an earlier point about Joe and Mika, I can't overemphasize
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:58.400]  enough the fact that the animus of Joe Scarborough, who's not, I think, a mentally balanced guy,
[1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:00.680]  is one of sheer jealousy.
[1:02:00.680 --> 1:02:04.560]  Joe Scarborough thinks he should be president.
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:11.240]  Joe Scarborough aspired to the 2016 Republican nomination.
[1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:17.480]  After Trump was nominated, Joe decided that the very best candidate for vice president
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:20.600]  was Joe Scarborough.
[1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:28.440]  And when I said this, some fake news outlets attacked me saying that Stone had no proof.
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:34.840]  Then Congressman Matt Gaetz, one of the really impressive, hard-charging young conservatives
[1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:40.920]  in the House of Representatives from Florida, a longtime protégé of Joe Scarborough put
[1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:46.560]  up a post saying, I love Joe Scarborough, but in every conversation I had with him ended.
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:52.920]  Every political conversation I had with him ended with him being president in 2016.
[1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:54.960]  So I think this proves my point.
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:58.320]  He is driven by jealousy and rage.
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:08.040]  I don't think Joe's life is a bowl of peaches in the sense that he evidently has quite a
[1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:16.560]  wild lifestyle, spends an enormous amount of his cash, and lives the beautiful people
[1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:17.560]  jet-set livestock.
[1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:21.960]  Well, is it the word that he's with her because she's got a lot of money that daddy got from
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:25.040]  war-criming?
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:30.600]  Remember during the Carter administration, Hamilton Jordan, the White House chief of
[1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:37.840]  staff referred to Zbigniew Brzezinski Mika's father, who was Clinton's national security
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:44.680]  advisor as Woody Woodpecker, which I thought was like the perfect nickname if you saw his
[1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:45.680]  photo.
[1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:48.040]  He is a neocon veteran.
[1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:58.240]  Again, notice he's serving a Democrat, but they insert a hardline neocon as their warmonger
[1:03:58.240 --> 1:03:59.240]  as their secretary.
[1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:03.160]  He's the founder of the Toronto Commission, also Jimmy Carter's national security advisor.
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:04.160]  Exactly.
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:12.400]  A true heavyweight of the deep state and who has done yeoman service in the cause of endless
[1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:19.360]  war, erosion of our civil liberties, squandering our national treasury, and the rest.
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:24.160]  So does Mika know that she's a sugar mama for Psycho Joe?
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:26.040]  Well, look, who knows?
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:31.360]  I am not going to criticize the fact that they may be, as they say in Washington, knocking
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:32.360]  boots.
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:36.120]  And I guess they're now engaged.
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:39.520]  I've always thought that she was an unattractive woman.
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:42.520]  I've never been on the air with either one of them that I...
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:43.520]  Sure, sure.
[1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:44.520]  I'm not knocking her.
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:47.040]  I mean, we first caught the video of them getting on a hotel together in an elevator
[1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:48.120]  all over each other.
[1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:50.560]  We first said they must be together and folks thought it was crazy.
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:54.680]  All I know is that she's anti-Trump, anti-American, she needs to be exposed.
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:57.680]  Roger Stone, thank you so much for joining us.
[1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:01.240]  We'll be back.
[1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:04.440]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again.
[1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:09.240]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and no IQ Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter
[1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:14.920]  yesterday and posted a short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo,
[1:05:14.920 --> 1:05:16.280]  a total classic.
[1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:20.440]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN
[1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:24.560]  and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds
[1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:27.080]  that the president is mentally unfit to serve.
[1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:31.560]  Now this would require a medical examination, which may come back to bite the Democrats
[1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:32.680]  that are calling for it.
[1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:37.800]  You see, given a fair examination of the president's health, Trump will pass with flying colors.
[1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:42.560]  But imagine if the tables were turned and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters,
[1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:47.440]  Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test, given the importance
[1:05:47.440 --> 1:05:48.440]  of their jobs.
[1:05:48.440 --> 1:05:51.280]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:52.760]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[1:05:52.760 --> 1:06:01.480]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Shroyer.
[1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:05.160]  Myco ZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[1:06:05.160 --> 1:06:06.760]  Talk about next level probiotic.

[1:06:10.920 --> 1:06:14.280]  It's been sold out for months, big waiting list, limited amount because it's so hard
[1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:17.080]  to get the compounds and to have the California standards.
[1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:18.080]  Nobody's got something as good.

[1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:44.480]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable
[1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:47.600]  bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist 50 years ago, now it's epidemic.
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:50.160]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:53.600]  it did for them because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.

[1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:03.840]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:08.960]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:13.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:17.360]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:22.680]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:29.080]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at Infowarslive.com.

[1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:40.600]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:43.360]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:48.080]  Stop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:51.120]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:17.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, you're listening to Alex
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:18.080]  Jones.
[1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:41.160]  Well, he's a former journalist with the Associated Press News.
[1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:45.440]  His week, PBS Frontline, one of the best documentary outfits out there, I'd say from
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:49.480]  a true classical liberal perspective, and Bloomberg News.
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:55.200]  And he has broken a lot of big national stories, coverage of the CIA, Nicaraguan contra-operation,
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:57.160]  and was also a Pulitzer Prize finalist.
[1:08:57.160 --> 1:09:01.680]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, kind of like Psyhurst or somebody had taken our,
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:04.680]  but he is the founder and editor of consortiumnews.com.
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:10.480]  His 95, his background in the mainstream news media has worked against the Associated Press
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:15.200]  and many other publications and television networks has really given him a great background.
[1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:19.160]  I'm not going to get into all of his awards.
[1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:23.160]  He's gotten some of the top awards in the country, consortiumnews.com.
[1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:27.840]  The real award he's gotten is breaking so much news in the last six months.
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:34.600]  He's the first person to start documenting that it wasn't 17 unanimous intelligence
[1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:36.800]  agencies and then Breitbart picked it up.
[1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:41.840]  The president and others retweeted it and finally it broke through the Berlin Wall
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:45.320]  of establishment media and got out there.
[1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:49.160]  Thanks to info wars, thanks to you spreading the links, thanks to a zero hedge carrying
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:52.240]  a lot of his articles, really, really powerful information.
[1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:59.120]  So consortiumnews.com founder and editor joins us, Robert Perry, because I know the listeners,
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:01.840]  the regular listeners go, we know the New York Times is lying.
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:07.280]  We know the Washington Post has got part of the $600 million through Bezos and the CIA.
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:11.360]  They admit they're lying, they admit they hate Trump, but we need to look at the anatomy
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:16.600]  of how they run a deception, how the rest of the media gets together and then amplifies
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:21.480]  it and then when the New York Times is forced last week to quietly retract even that's
[1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:27.040]  a lie and then still the media is running with the 17 unanimous agencies and the total
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:28.840]  proof that Americans didn't vote?
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:30.000]  No, no, no.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.520]  You wanted Hillary, it was the Ruskies.
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:37.960]  So this isn't even about Trump, this isn't about, this is about the integrity of our
[1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:44.440]  country and our system and deep state claiming it's protecting us from the Russians when
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:48.480]  they're the ones trying to organize through Atlantic Monthly and others.
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:53.200]  The removal of Trump and the suspension of the last election and then Homeland Security
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:58.440]  federalizing the election will be like Venezuela folks, a permanent one-party state.
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.000]  The Republicans tried this, I would oppose it.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.400]  So quite a time to be alive, Robert Perry again has written a bunch of articles breaking
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:10.800]  all of this down, New York Times finally retracts Russia gate canard.
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:15.220]  There's another one, New York Times forced to retract, longstanding 17 intel agencies
[1:11:15.220 --> 1:11:21.280]  lie about Russia and then he goes back really hammering that so it's almost the anatomy
[1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:26.920]  of patient zero for the truth, how do you research this stuff, how do you develop it
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:31.680]  and then how do you patiently hammer away until the dam of lies collapses.
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:34.120]  Robert Perry, thanks for coming on with us.
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:35.120]  Thank you.
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:39.000]  Well, where to start with this latest hoax that's imploded?
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:45.200]  Well, as you know, from going back to last fall during the campaign, it became almost
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:55.240]  a, a rote repeated endlessly presented certainty that all 17 US intelligence agencies had
[1:11:55.240 --> 1:12:01.280]  concurred in the point that the Russians had hacked into the election and on and tried
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:05.960]  to help Donald Trump win the presidency.
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:11.320]  Having covered the intelligence community really going back to the 1980s, that never
[1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:16.000]  sounded right to me because there was no national intelligence estimate.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.200]  That's the so-called NIEs.
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:24.080]  That's where you get the 17 intelligence agencies coming together, offering their consensus
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:29.040]  view with dissents about some important topic.
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:31.200]  For instance, does Iraq have WMD?
[1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:37.280]  Which of course ended up being one that where the NIE that was released to the public had
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:41.400]  been sanitized by the Bush administration to remove some of the dissents suggesting
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:44.920]  that perhaps the Iraqis did not have WMD.
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:47.400]  But that's the way it's usually done.
[1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:51.000]  There was no indication that there was an NIE on the issue of Russia.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:55.720]  It turns out there really wasn't even a, a thorough analysis.
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:13:00.040]  It was something that James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, stated.
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:05.120]  And he spoke, he said, on behalf of the intelligence community.
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:09.640]  And since there are 17 agencies in the community, that became sort of all 17 agreed.
[1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:11.960]  But that wasn't the case.
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:16.080]  But it became something that was repeated over and over again.
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:21.720]  We, as consortiumnews.com, we tried to point out that, that this wasn't necessarily the
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:25.920]  case that we, from what we were getting from inside the community was that there was not
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:27.560]  this consensus.
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:29.720]  But that's how everyone reported it.
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:38.080]  Finally, finally in May, Clapper, testifying before the, before the Congress, and then
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:45.360]  C, former CI director Brennan confirmed that there had not been a 17 agency analysis, that
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:51.520]  there had been analysis done by people from three of the agencies that were handpicked
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:55.880]  by Clapper and the other appointees from President Obama.
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:14:02.080]  And they produced something on January 6th that was a report which stated that it was
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:07.840]  based on the, on FBI, CIA, and NSA analysts, not all 17.
[1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:13.000]  So it became obvious even, even publicly, both in January and then again in May, that
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:18.200]  this was a false claim, but it was continued to be repeated over and over again by the
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:19.840]  major news organizations.
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:24.840]  Finally, the New York Times, when this came out again, in one of their stories, agreed
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:30.720]  to retract it and ran a correction saying that there was no 17 agency analysis.
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:31.720]  Wow.
[1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:37.840]  And it just shows an arrogance that's like North Korean or Venezuelan and its authoritarianism,
[1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:40.520]  where they just keep hammering and hammering and hammering.
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:46.200]  Day one, I mean, as you said, yourself, others approached these agencies, Congress was approached
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:49.800]  them, there wasn't a consensus, they all said different things.
[1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:55.480]  And then it turns out the CIA report had stuff in it from the PP gate, you know, dossier
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:15:00.280]  that they admit now as Democratic Party run, and it has stuff in there like, you know,
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:04.720]  two years ago, there was an RT report that was critical of Hillary, and that's hacking
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:05.720]  our election.
[1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:10.760]  It was the term hacking, it was never a physical, digital, getting into election systems, they've
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:15.880]  all admitted that under testimony now, but still the term hack, hack, hack, when it would
[1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:21.000]  be meddling or it would be interference or it would be, you know, just normal propaganda
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:29.720]  that any major power engages in, but it just seems amazing, not just the 17 agency hoax,
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:32.200]  but the whole hacking hoax itself.
[1:15:32.200 --> 1:15:37.320]  Right, we've talked to, I've talked to a number of people from the intelligence community
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:42.560]  with, who are experts in this field, who say that if there had been an actual hack that
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:47.720]  should have been something that the NSA would have known as a matter of fact, not as something
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:52.320]  as a so-called assessment, where they're piecing things together.
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:58.520]  There was also the problem that the FBI never sees the DNC computers, the normal process
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:03.280]  would be, if he took something seriously like this, would be for the FBI to do its own forensics
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:05.640]  on the computers to see what happened.
[1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:11.880]  The FBI has now acknowledged that it relied on a private group called CrowdStrike to handle
[1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:15.560]  the forensics for them.
[1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:19.680]  So this is not even, this is very abnormal, especially when you consider how important
[1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:21.600]  this issue has become.
[1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:26.600]  Now it may well be that the Russians, as the United States does, as other intelligence
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:34.840]  agencies do, try to get into the emails and other information data of rival countries,
[1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:37.000]  even friendly countries.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:40.880]  So it's not unusual for the Russians or the Americans or the British or the Israelis
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:47.160]  or whoever to try to be penetrating into the sensitive emails of people involved in-
[1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:48.480]  Well that was my next point.
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:53.240]  I mean, I think the plan was by the neocons, the rhinos, and the democratic leadership
[1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:57.480]  trying to stop a populist movement, knowing that every major government, Chinese, Russian,
[1:16:57.480 --> 1:16:59.480]  you name it, they're all trying to penetrate each other.
[1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:00.480]  That's going on all the time.
[1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:05.640]  We had the EU, the Pope, the Saudi Arabians, Hollywood, MSM, all the main media against
[1:17:05.640 --> 1:17:06.640]  Trump.
[1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:10.120]  For Hillary, we have the WikiLeaks proving it, the rigging the debates.
[1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:14.720]  Hillary basically running the major publications, the Democrats, Podesta, I mean literally working
[1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:18.280]  like the editor of over 100 publications, I don't know how he did it, but there they
[1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:22.200]  are in the WikiLeaks, so they got embarrassed, they got defeated.
[1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:25.920]  But then obviously they know they start a big enough investigation, they've got to find
[1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:30.120]  something where the Russians tried to penetrate something, and it changes the subject from
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:32.680]  Hillary's server and the rest of it.
[1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:37.760]  So speak to that pleaser, again the founder and head of Consortium News, Robert Perry,
[1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:41.640]  but expanding, then what does it mean a few weeks ago when Jay Johnson, the former head
[1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:46.520]  of Homeland Security, is forced to admit we tried to get in their servers because we
[1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:52.400]  were concerned about stuff like this, and trying to find out who is giving in Photo
[1:17:52.400 --> 1:17:56.760]  WikiLeaks, whether it be Russia or not, we now know probably insiders in the DNC, and
[1:17:56.760 --> 1:18:02.760]  they said no you can't get in, so why wouldn't Hillary, with a friendly DOJ, and a friendly
[1:18:02.760 --> 1:18:08.360]  FBI, and a friendly president, not want them in the computers?
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:12.200]  Well you would think that if this was a serious investigation, and it obviously is taken on
[1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:17.920]  very serious ramifications, where we're talking in some cases about going to war with Russia,
[1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:21.560]  and people may have forgotten, but they have a lot of nuclear weapons as does the United
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:22.720]  States.
[1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:26.200]  So when people start talking in terms of this being an assault on our democracy and an act
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:33.760]  of war, and so forth, the American side has escalated this to an extremely dangerous point.
[1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:40.240]  And you would expect therefore that the US law enforcement and intelligence agencies
[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:46.040]  would treat this with that degree of seriousness, and instead we've seen a rather odd approach,
[1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:52.760]  which is more driven it seems by making propaganda points than by actually establishing what's
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:57.400]  fact and what's not fact, and we still have the, of course the mainstream media does not
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:01.920]  want to give up on that 17 intelligence agency canard.
[1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:07.360]  The New York Times has now retracted it, but if you read what they write now they say the
[1:19:07.360 --> 1:19:11.000]  US intelligence community unanimously agreed.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:16.760]  So they're still suggesting that all 17 agencies are in agreement, even though we now know
[1:19:16.760 --> 1:19:17.760]  they weren't.
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:21.960]  They got three political hacks to just get together and write a letter and claim that.
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:27.760]  Just like I'm sure you saw the CIA report on Russian meddling, and it was all just public
[1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:34.280]  statements by Russian officials on TV over the years, maybe a dozen or so times they
[1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:35.280]  criticized Hillary.
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:36.280]  It was crazy.
[1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:41.920]  Well, I did read that report on January 6th, and what was remarkable, you've referenced
[1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:49.440]  it, there was an addendum from four years earlier really, based on RT's coverage of
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:56.240]  the 2012 election, and one of the complaints was that RT had allowed third party candidates
[1:19:56.240 --> 1:19:57.240]  who had been excluded from the election.
[1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:58.600]  Stay there, let's come right back to that.
[1:19:58.600 --> 1:19:59.600]  This is key.
[1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:00.600]  It's a no-brainer.

[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:25.880]  Now I followed the work and so did my producer Nico Lacosta of Robert Perry of consortiumnews.com
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:32.200]  and it's so exciting to see seasoned award-winning journalists from the Associated Press, PBS
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:36.240]  Frontline, Newsweek, you name it, Bloomberg News, to go start their own operations and
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:38.120]  see them have millions of readers.
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:40.880]  That is, in fact, I should have this gentleman back for a full hour just talking about the
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:46.880]  state of the media, to look at what they do, to look at how they spin, the way MSM lies
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:50.200]  and says that I said there's Mars colonies with kids on it, never said that.
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:55.040]  I mean, they are so desperate to discredit us, it seems like they've only tripled down.
[1:24:55.040 --> 1:25:02.680]  So he was getting into the CIA report that we can put on screen now for folks where they're
[1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:08.080]  talking about letting private contractors be involved in elections in 2012, he was segwaying
[1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:09.080]  into something.
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:10.080]  So go ahead, Robert.
[1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:18.040]  Well, there was this report on January 6th that was put out by the DNI by Clapper, reflecting
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:21.680]  the views and Clapper has now acknowledged that these analysts were hand-picked, they
[1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:31.440]  hand-picked the analysts at CIA, NSA and FBI to do this review of what the evidence was.
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:34.520]  Just like the WMDs in 2003, just as you mentioned.
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:38.960]  Well, there's been a history going back really to the Reagan years and perhaps even earlier
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:43.320]  of selecting your analysts who will give you the result you want.
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:47.400]  This is something that William Casey and Robert Gates, when they were running the agency back
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:49.600]  in the 1980s, sort of began doing.
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:54.080]  And so we started getting these more politicized intelligence reports.
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.360]  And this one fits that bill.
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:26:00.320]  But I was criticizing the lack of evidence that was being presented on this very important
[1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:06.840]  topic of whether the Russians did indeed somehow hack into the US selection some way.
[1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:10.200]  No evidence was being presented, but I was assured that on January 6th, I'd get what
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:11.360]  I wanted.
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:15.640]  So when I read the report, again, there's really almost, there's no evidence in it.
[1:26:15.640 --> 1:26:19.920]  It's an assessment, which they describe as something where they put two and two together
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:21.960]  and come up with an answer.
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:27.240]  And then they added on this section at the end, which was an attack on RT, the Russian
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:28.240]  network.
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:29.240]  Sure.
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:31.080]  Their big proof was RT talked bad about us.
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:32.080]  That's a hack.
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:39.440]  Well, it was also that RT had put on a debate allowing third-party American candidates to
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:41.360]  express their views to the public.
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:42.360]  How evil.
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:45.800]  Because they'd been excluded from the 2012 presidential debates.
[1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:48.840]  And that was presented as an assault on American democracy.
[1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:53.360]  And he's sort of wondering, what kind of democracy are they talking about here?
[1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:57.720]  I mean, that only the two parties can have their views expressed, and if the American
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:26:59.960]  people hear from other people.
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:00.960]  Sure.
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:05.760]  But even though, speaking Russian network with low viewership dares to show third parties
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:09.160]  that they've choked out, we ought to give the Russians an award for that.
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:10.160]  Right.
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:14.000]  And they also mentioned that RT had covered the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:17.080]  But of course, everybody covered the Occupy Wall Street demonstration.
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:19.520]  And it certainly was a valid story.
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:25.280]  So there was this, again, there was this effort to stretch the evidence.
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:29.400]  And there was also a failure in that report to look at other sides of the question.
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:35.800]  For instance, they cite how President Putin has had hard feelings toward Hillary Clinton.
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:38.800]  And that was the so-called motive.
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:43.360]  But it's also true that Putin would have been afraid that if Hillary Clinton had gotten
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:48.000]  elected and he had tried to sabotage her, that might actually cause real problems with
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.600]  his relationship with the United States.
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:55.320]  So instead of presenting both sides of the story, this report was extremely one-sided.
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:59.920]  He was trying to make a case, but it really wasn't what they were sort of pitching it
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:05.080]  as, at least the mainstream media, which was that all 17 agencies agreed.
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:06.080]  There was no such consensus.
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:07.080]  Sure.
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:08.080]  So let me ask you this then.
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:11.360]  And if you can't, I mean, do five more minutes the next time because I have a few other questions.
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:13.920]  If you have to go, it's fine, I understand.
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:15.240]  But where do they go from here?
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:16.920]  I mean, they're so discredited.
[1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:20.880]  They've got all these former establishment journalists that have ethics like you that
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:22.120]  are just everywhere.
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:26.720]  Carol Atkinson, I mean, unless there's thousands of them just destroying them, mainly what
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:30.240]  I do is just report on what journalists like you are covering.
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:33.720]  Then they always, they never mentioned your name or somebody else's name or when Cy Hirsch
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:38.680]  comes on and says something, they say, Jones just made this up or Jones made that up.
[1:28:38.680 --> 1:28:43.680]  But then when it comes true, my credit goes up and up because they've kind of used me
[1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:46.600]  as the fake news term, but then I'm not fake news.
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:48.360]  And so it blows up in their face.
[1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:54.360]  Well, you know, at Consortium News, since we started in 1995, we tried to do very serious
[1:28:54.360 --> 1:28:58.080]  journalism and I'm a very much an opponent of conspiracy theories.
[1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:02.440]  You know, I think fake news, when it does happen, whoever's doing it should be heartily
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:03.940]  condemned.
[1:29:03.940 --> 1:29:07.600]  But that doesn't mean that everything you read in the New York Times is true either.
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:10.120]  A lot of that has turned out to be false.
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:12.560]  And one has to be careful.
[1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:15.640]  One has to also bring one's own judgment to play.
[1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:20.760]  And I think mainstream journalists have gotten very arrogant about how they can dictate what's
[1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:21.760]  true or not.
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:26.960]  We've seen even something like Politifact, which had declared the 17-agency canard to
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:30.880]  be true, doesn't still does not want to retract it.
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:31.880]  Wow.
[1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:32.880]  Wow.
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:35.600]  Robert Perry, do five more minutes when we have this quick break because I want to ask
[1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:40.400]  you then, as a journalist, where you see this going and what's going to happen to people
[1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:44.560]  like Politifact as they double down on the arrogance and then double down again and again
[1:29:44.560 --> 1:29:49.040]  because that's what I'm seeing is the media kind of team up to intensify lying to try
[1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:50.840]  to resuscitate themselves.
[1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:53.360]  We'll be back.
[1:29:53.360 --> 1:30:01.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:04.520]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again.
[1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:09.320]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and No IQ Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter
[1:30:09.320 --> 1:30:14.440]  yesterday and posted a short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN
[1:30:14.440 --> 1:30:16.360]  logo, a total classic.
[1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:20.560]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN
[1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:24.680]  and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds
[1:30:24.680 --> 1:30:27.160]  that the president is mentally unfit to serve.
[1:30:27.160 --> 1:30:31.680]  Now this would require a medical examination, which may come back to bite the Democrats
[1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:32.800]  that are calling for it.
[1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:37.920]  You see, given a fair examination of the president's health, Trump will pass with flying colors.
[1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:42.720]  But imagine if the tables were turned and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters,
[1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:47.560]  Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test, given the importance
[1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:48.560]  of their jobs.
[1:30:48.560 --> 1:30:51.400]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[1:30:51.400 --> 1:30:52.880]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[1:30:52.880 --> 1:31:00.080]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:03.760]  A new shipment of Biotrucelinium is now available at InfowarsLife.com.
[1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:05.640]  We've been sold out for months.
[1:31:05.640 --> 1:31:10.760]  Our one-of-a-kind InfowarsLife Biotrucelinium formula is now back in stock at InfowarsLife.com.
[1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:14.360]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its
[1:31:14.360 --> 1:31:15.360]  core.
[1:31:15.360 --> 1:31:19.400]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:24.520]  But Biotrucelinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[1:31:24.520 --> 1:31:28.040]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[1:31:28.040 --> 1:31:33.040]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrucelinium
[1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:38.240]  is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support
[1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:41.400]  a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[1:31:41.400 --> 1:31:45.200]  Visit InfowarsLife.com to order your bottle of Biotrucelinium before we sell it again.
[1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:49.440]  That's InfowarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help
[1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:54.240]  yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360W.
[1:31:54.240 --> 1:31:56.320]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[1:31:56.320 --> 1:31:57.880]  This is the time to support Infowars.
[1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:00.080]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[1:32:00.080 --> 1:32:03.520]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:05.400]  in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:32:05.400 --> 1:32:08.200]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[1:32:08.200 --> 1:32:10.240]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:14.440]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[1:32:14.440 --> 1:32:15.440]  Super Blue.
[1:32:15.440 --> 1:32:17.320]  Research across the board is clear.
[1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:18.680]  In fact, it's certified.
[1:32:18.680 --> 1:32:22.560]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:23.840]  clots and heart attacks.
[1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:28.280]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[1:32:28.280 --> 1:32:30.920]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:32:30.920 --> 1:32:34.080]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with
[1:32:34.080 --> 1:32:37.520]  good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:32:37.520 --> 1:32:42.920]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients, uses biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria
[1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:44.320]  and eliminate bad breath.
[1:32:44.320 --> 1:32:48.720]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:51.880]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[1:32:51.880 --> 1:32:56.560]  Learn more about InfowarsLife Super Blue toothpaste at InfowarsLife.com.
[1:32:56.560 --> 1:33:11.040]  And support the Infowar, while you support Healthy Gums and Teeth.
[1:33:11.040 --> 1:33:15.360]  You found it, the front lines of the human awakening.
[1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:16.360]  It's the Infowar.
[1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:17.360]  And now, Alex Jones.
[1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:32.920]  Maria Bartoloma, the lovely and intelligent host of Fox Business, a few days ago had John
[1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:37.640]  Podesta on, who Hillary and his brother and the rest of them have been knee-deep with
[1:33:37.640 --> 1:33:44.040]  the Russians, secret meetings with Putin, uranium deals, I mean, it's just crazy.
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:48.520]  And then claiming Trump has all these non-existent ties.
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:52.400]  And Podesta now isn't just blaming me for being a Russian agent, they have congressional
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:55.480]  hearings saying this, they won't call me before them.
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:34:00.120]  Now they say, I'm advising the Russians, Hillary says, they don't understand America,
[1:34:00.120 --> 1:34:04.920]  but they get it from Infowars, and then it comes back to the US via WikiLeaks, and then
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:07.100]  Jones picks it up again.
[1:34:07.100 --> 1:34:11.960]  So I wrote all those emails committing all these crimes and fixing debates and commanding
[1:34:11.960 --> 1:34:12.960]  the media.
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:14.720]  No, I didn't do any of that.
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:19.800]  I mean, I mainly just sit here and read mainline news, government documents, you name it, read
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:22.680]  the work of Robert Perry and his great journalist at Consortium News.
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:25.000]  But here's a short, short clip of that.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:28.880]  I guess this was on, this was on Monday, here it is.
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:32.440]  Keep saying that they gave me, they did you stop, that they didn't-
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:34.320]  I'm just following all the widely reported information here, John.
[1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:35.880]  There's also Hillary Clinton, obviously-
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:42.200]  Maria, maybe you're looking at widely reported information from Infowars.
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:43.200]  No, I'm not.
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:44.200]  But it is not true.
[1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:45.200]  No, I'm not.
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:46.200]  This is Politico.
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:47.200]  This is the New York Times.
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:48.200]  This is the Wall Street Journal.
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:49.200]  No, it's not.
[1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:50.200]  That's what I'm looking at, John.
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:51.200]  No, it's not, Maria.
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:52.200]  Then there's Hillary Clinton.
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:53.200]  If you go over-
[1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:56.320]  Then there's Hillary Clinton, of course, we know, who got $100 million from Russian
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:35:02.440]  companies after she allowed that Russian company to acquire 20% of the US's uranium.
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:07.000]  So the point I'm making here, John, is that there's much deeper ties to Russia on their
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:10.480]  Democratic side than there are on the Republican side.
[1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:14.440]  This is a 15-minute clip where he just says, Hillary didn't do it.
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:15.440]  I didn't get money.
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:20.920]  And it's all on federal records of stock and bonds and cash deals.
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:25.040]  And then they've picked Infowars to straw man and say that we said all these things
[1:35:25.040 --> 1:35:32.080]  we didn't say just across the board as now the new logo of fake news, but even CNN itself
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:35.600]  says they don't want to go there, stop using that term.
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:40.160]  So I think hoisted on their own patard, falling into their own trap is what's happened here.
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:44.600]  I want to ask Robert Perry of consortiumnews.com, an award-winning journalist formerly with
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:50.080]  PBS, Frontline, Associated Press Newsweek, Bloomberg News, you name it.
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:54.200]  As we see an exodus of real journalists setting up their own operations, you did it back when
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:58.000]  I did in 1995, but all these others piling on now.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:03.240]  How do you see the media landscape in the future basically filling out?
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:06.760]  What do you think is going to happen with this, also the Russian narrative, and so much
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:07.760]  more?
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:10.800]  Well, it's really hard to say.
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:13.880]  There is still tremendous power in the mainstream media.
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:22.120]  They still have the largest companies, most people, and I really don't like to be a critic
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:24.480]  of these news organizations.
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:29.000]  I came out of the mainstream media, obviously I had differences with some editors over how
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:34.360]  they were not pursuing important stories that I wanted to pursue, but I also don't like
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:41.880]  the idea of tearing down the media, but what it has to say that what we're seeing is a
[1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:52.320]  strange arrogance, almost an out-of-control arrogance, where propaganda becomes the language
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:56.960]  that is used now by not just the New York Times, but by the Washington Post and many
[1:36:56.960 --> 1:36:57.960]  others.
[1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:02.240]  But don't they get the arrogance and the megalomania and the doubling down is making people hate
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:03.240]  them even more?
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:09.120]  Well, I think that's also politically a danger that the Democrats have encountered in trying
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:14.960]  to overturn this last election by aligning themselves with the New York Times and the
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:15.960]  Washington Post.
[1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:21.440]  They don't seem to realize that many Americans don't like the elite media, that there's a
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:22.920]  lot of hostility.
[1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:28.640]  You can look at all the polls that show that Americans think very poorly of...
[1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:33.960]  I mean, 6% to 18% trust rate in what AP studies and others.
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:39.280]  So I think to sort of count on the New York Times and the Washington Post to reverse the
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:45.480]  outcome of an election, and obviously Hillary Clinton got more popular votes, but under
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:52.200]  our system, which was set up in the Constitution, Trump won, he won Barron Square.
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:56.360]  Now to try to pretend that wasn't the case and to pretend something else, interestingly,
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:01.000]  when Podesta was on CNN the other day, talking to Wolf Litzer, he was asked about how did
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:05.640]  you possibly lose to this guy, Trump, Podesta answered sort of honestly.
[1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:06.640]  I was a little surprised.
[1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:10.200]  I was expecting to hear Russia, Russia again, and he said, well, he said people were just
[1:38:10.200 --> 1:38:15.240]  really desperate for change, and they decided they would go in that direction, even though
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:16.600]  they had doubts about Trump.
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:20.600]  So does that signify that they're starting to figure out, because I saw several articles,
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:25.120]  they're trying to get rid of Pelosi, the Democrats are now starting to admit that, okay, we've
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:30.440]  got an image problem, I mean, I think they're starting to maybe figure out this isn't working.
[1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:34.560]  As far as the Democrats are, as far as, as far as, I mean, like you said, with the media,
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:40.480]  they have gone into a new crazed level of just foaming at the mouth and calling for violence
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:42.720]  against Trump and Trump supporters.
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:47.840]  And then somebody makes a meme of somebody, you know, some Trump knocking down CNN, and
[1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:51.840]  they flip out like it's the end of the world and start bullying the person that produced
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:52.840]  it.
[1:38:52.840 --> 1:38:57.560]  Well, you know, I think certainly President Trump can show more decorum as how he deals
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:00.960]  with the public and the media and all the rest of it.
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:02.480]  But that's a different issue.
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:10.360]  The point is that the mainstream media has gotten deeper into this idea that it can dictate
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:12.720]  what's real and what's not real.
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:16.720]  And I would say that if they had a great record of doing that and being accurate, maybe you
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:18.520]  could justify it.
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:20.360]  But their record has been pretty abysmal.
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:25.080]  Coming back, let's say, to the WMD fiasco in Iraq that got lots of people killed and
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:29.120]  turned out to be dead wrong, and there was almost no accountability inside the mainstream
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:30.120]  media.
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:32.160]  There weren't a lot of firings.
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:38.040]  People who took the position of no question about WMD ended up either keeping their jobs
[1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:40.000]  or even getting promoted.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.960]  So we've seen this problem where the mainstream media doesn't even function the way it used
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:47.200]  to back even when I was early.
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:48.200]  Sure.
[1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:53.560]  We call it media because it seems like whoever is the most lapdog-ish, whoever follows the
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:58.680]  talking point, because I've experienced this being attacked sometimes by thousands of publications
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.200]  today, usually only 20 or 30, sometimes 100 on a bigger day.
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:07.640]  I mean, I've been attacked in 5,000, 10,000 articles in one day, and I'll spend hours
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:08.640]  looking at them.
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:14.320]  They're all cut and paste in major newspapers and on major TV networks of the same original
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:17.720]  talking points that David Brock puts out.
[1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:19.040]  And they only do it when he does it.
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:24.520]  When he puts it out, then it sees the Democratic Party, and then worldwide, not just here,
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:31.440]  Germany, Australia, the UK, Canada, they all take it and then just rewrite it only slightly,
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:35.200]  whereas if I was an English teacher or a journalist teacher, say in college or high school, and
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:39.800]  I got back the papers from 30 students and they're all the same person, I'd say, who
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:41.160]  originally wrote this?
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:42.720]  I mean, it's that bad.
[1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:45.200]  Well, plagiarism, isn't it?
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:50.040]  What I would say, here's the point I would make, Alex, is that sticking to facts is really
[1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:55.840]  important, ascertaining them, doing the work necessary to figure out what's real, what's
[1:40:55.840 --> 1:41:01.640]  not real, and then building a better understanding of truth based on hard fact.
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:02.640]  That's what's been missing.
[1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:06.280]  And it's not just missing in the mainstream media, it's missing, of course, on the internet
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:07.280]  in many ways, too.
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:10.320]  Sure, people build a consensus and then it just expands from there.
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:11.320]  Right.
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:17.560]  And we have to build those things on foundations of hard fact, not on theory and not on unspeculation
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:20.080]  and so on, not on propaganda.
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:24.720]  But as best you can do it, and it's not a perfect process, but as best you can, figure
[1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:29.680]  out what's true, what's real, what's factual, and then build your stories and everything
[1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:30.680]  from that.
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:35.680]  But what we've seen, and we're now seeing it across the board, and I think the New York
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:40.080]  Times likes to pretend that it's standing for truth, it's the great defender, the Washington
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:46.200]  Post has this slogan, democracy dies in darkness, the arrogance of some of this.
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:47.640]  The only folks believing it are them.
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:52.000]  So let me say this in closing, I hope they'll come back and kind of school us on journalism
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:55.600]  because I've never claimed to be a pure journalist, I've been a pundit, you know, a guy that
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:00.520]  makes films, analysis, I mean, I mainly just sit there and report on other news and give
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:01.720]  my take on it.
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:04.400]  But I've learned what you're saying, not just mainstream media, I've been caught up
[1:42:04.400 --> 1:42:10.640]  in what they're caught up in, hysteria where the internet builds a story, finds the evidence
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:16.360]  they want, and then we basically get bullied into just covering what they're saying, even
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:21.320]  in other alternative publications, but then I get it hung around my neck that I created
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:22.320]  it.
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:26.080]  So now I've got to be, I guess, a lot more careful because now we are so big, you know,
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:31.240]  it's teaching me that we're not under the radar anymore, and the media will then misrepresent
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:36.000]  what I reported on, what somebody else reported on, so I'm definitely experiencing just to
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:40.160]  protect myself, not just to tell the truth, which I've always tried to do, but just to
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:44.760]  really protect myself, I've got to be absolutely specific when I'm talking about what somebody
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:48.480]  else said, because even when I'm doing that, they'll twist it.
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:50.480]  Well, we all have to be careful.
[1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:56.240]  That's a basic rule of journalism, be careful, don't trust anything, check it out.
[1:42:56.240 --> 1:43:00.320]  I'm afraid that too many times now, the New York Times and the Washington Post get their
[1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:05.080]  briefings at the some, usually off the record, maybe on background at the State Department
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:08.240]  or the White House, and they just go with that.
[1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:12.240]  Instead of showing the kind of skepticism, the kind of toughness that I thought journalism
[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:16.840]  was about, they go with the flow, and that's a danger for the mainstream.
[1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:17.840]  What about this?
[1:43:17.840 --> 1:43:18.840]  I've got some White House sources.
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:25.840]  Those on the Internet have to operate with greater care, because there is this impression
[1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:30.520]  that the Internet is full of false news and sloppy, and at consortiumnews.com, we've
[1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:36.320]  tried really hard over those 20-some years to maintain a very close relationship with
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:43.080]  facts, with presenting our evidence, laying it out as best we can to our readers.
[1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:45.520]  Well, you're doing a great job, Robert Perry.
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:47.520]  Thank you so much for joining us, consortiumnews.com.
[1:43:47.520 --> 1:43:49.760]  Hope to talk to you again soon.
[1:43:49.760 --> 1:43:50.760]  Thank you.
[1:43:50.760 --> 1:43:53.400]  Great guests, Nico Goddard, because I've read his stuff for years, and I was like, oh yeah,
[1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:55.680]  wow, that's a great guest to have on.
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:59.120]  He's one of the first people to start saying, can we see some proof?
[1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:04.480]  But I'll tell you, mainstream media has just intensified their lying, they've intensified
[1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:10.400]  their attempts to destroy anybody who they see as competition, and in that process, they've
[1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:12.320]  only made them full wars bigger.
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:17.920]  Look at Mika Brzezinski and Joseph Scarborough, old Psycho Joe.
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:21.240]  They've gone from one of the lowest rating demographics on cable.
[1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:24.080]  We're talking 200,000, 300,000 viewers an hour.
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:31.280]  To a million viewers plus an hour since Trump tweeted that she was bleeding from her facelift,
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:34.960]  and that she was begging to meet with him, which is true.
[1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:39.120]  So they ought to be thanking Trump, but no, they're not.
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:44.680]  MSN itself has its ratings back up, nothing like it was a long time ago, but they're back
[1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:50.280]  up because Trump has brought interest back to things.
[1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:52.280]  It's simply amazing.
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:58.800]  Now, continuing here, I want to segue into a massive amount of other news I haven't gotten
[1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:03.600]  to yet that's so important, but I thought it was really key to just go back and review
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:22.680]  the fact that all that 17 agencies saying it's a total consensus is a complete 100% fabrication.
[1:45:22.680 --> 1:45:27.760]  You've got to ask yourself, where are they going to go from there?
[1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:33.840]  Now, imagine my job, I'm not complaining, but imagine my job.
[1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:38.320]  This is just what I'm looking at on the tops of my stacks.
[1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:44.840]  Gay orgy and cocaine at the Inquisition's headquarters at the Vatican.
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:50.080]  That broke.
[1:45:50.080 --> 1:45:53.120]  That broke.
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:58.120]  Last week, we broke it Monday here in the United States, we had the reporter on, and
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:03.640]  then what was in the Daily Mail today, Vatican police break up gay orgy at home of Secretary
[1:46:03.640 --> 1:46:08.760]  of one of the Pope's Francis Key Advisors.
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:16.840]  This whole thing is coming down, ladies and gentlemen, it's inside the Vatican.
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:17.840]  Look at this headline.
[1:46:17.840 --> 1:46:22.200]  Here's what the 2018 Olympic gender regulations look like.
[1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:24.080]  That was a regular talk show.
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:28.240]  I would spend a whole hour and take your calls on that subject alone.
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:32.920]  They're saying men can compete as women and women can compete as men.
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:38.920]  If men just want to go dominate and get gold medals, but men are shovelers, most of them
[1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:40.360]  aren't going to do that, but some will.
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:44.640]  There's already some men winning the racing, the weightlifting you name it, and they just
[1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:48.840]  say, I am a woman.
[1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:51.280]  You look at these guys, you go, well, you look like a really muscular dude.
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:53.440]  You look like a really manly man.
[1:46:53.440 --> 1:46:54.720]  You look like a Uber man.
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:58.280]  You don't just look like a man, bro.
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:46:59.280]  That doesn't matter.
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:00.280]  They identify.
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:01.280]  Oh, you're hateful.
[1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:02.280]  Okay.
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:03.280]  Well, I identify as an astronaut.
[1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:04.280]  I identify as a billionaire.
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:06.720]  I identify as a blind person.
[1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:11.240]  The government will pour bleach in your eyes in the UK and then give you money for the rest
[1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:15.240]  of your life to live as a blind person because you identify as a blind person.
[1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:17.160]  That's called mental illness.
[1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:24.160]  If you want to go pay to have your male genitals cut off, that's your business, bro.
[1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:26.360]  Don't make me pay for it as a taxpayer.
[1:47:26.360 --> 1:47:28.560]  This is psychological warfare.
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:34.000]  The ugly architecture, all of it is declassified to make you feel small and to destroy society
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:37.360]  and to target the family.
[1:47:37.360 --> 1:47:42.520]  You know what produces the babies, what produces the wealth, what produces the fealty, the
[1:47:42.520 --> 1:47:51.440]  alliance, the society, the association, the civilization, the culture.
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:56.040]  I want to first hit those CNN rock by a huge backlash after a black nose creator of Trump's
[1:47:56.040 --> 1:48:01.640]  CNN meme, but I'm going to stop right there.
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:08.680]  I cannot stress to you enough what's happened with the GMO food, the pesticides, the chemicals
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:15.680]  in our food and water, and what it's done to mutate and kill and displace the good bacteria
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:21.440]  and the limited amounts of yeast and fungus and garbage that's supposed to be in your
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:27.640]  guts and good gut health is linked to mental health, bad gut health is linked to cancer,
[1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:33.120]  it's linked to autism, it's linked to depression, don't believe me, just type in gut health
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:35.320]  linked to depression, gut health linked to cancer.
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:38.480]  This is the super science that's been known for 100 years.
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:43.000]  The elites are obsessed with it, but I did research at the top clinics here in Austin
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:46.400]  servicing the elite, Austin is one of the richest cities in the world, and I looked
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:52.920]  at Zurich, Switzerland, I looked at Berlin, Germany, and I knew that they had at clinics,
[1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:57.520]  not just probiotics, but probiotics that go in and knock out the bad yeast and fungus,
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:49:00.960]  and so I went to a group a few years ago and I said, can we basically copy one of these?
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:04.320]  He said, it's funny you say that, he's got a big clinic in Houston, he said I'm actually
[1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:05.320]  developing it.
[1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:11.280]  And he did it for us, it's MycoZX, it's been sold out for almost six months, it's back,
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:15.560]  supports normal, fungal, and yeast balance in your gut, a proprietary blend of herbs
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:19.440]  and enzymes, made with high quality ingredients, read about it for yourself, read about the
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:22.600]  reviews, you're insane if you don't buy a bottle, because even if you don't have this
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:26.040]  yeast problem that most people reportedly do, you're supporting the broadcast, but you
[1:49:26.040 --> 1:49:29.920]  probably do, and it's only going to help with gut health, and then you do it a few times
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:32.800]  a year, or you do it as maintenance every few days.
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:36.400]  Home defense is the very best probiotic we can come out with, with the widest spectrum
[1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:41.920]  of strains, it's kept refrigerated here until we ship it to you, it's a great probiotic,
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:46.560]  it goes with the MycoZX, it's back in stock, 30% off, and you're saying, why would you
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:49.520]  do that if you've been sold out?
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:53.520]  Because I want to incentivize you to get it, to get the great response, to then sign up
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:57.520]  for auto-ship every month, every six months, every year, you can sign up canceling time
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:02.160]  to get an additional 10% off, I want your business, I want you to go, wow, Jones really
[1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:04.000]  told me the truth.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:09.040]  I got a buddy who works here in the military for 20 years, and they feed him all that really
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:14.240]  horrible GMO, and he just had guts that were shut down, terrible bowel you name it, it's
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:15.240]  ruined his life.
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:18.960]  I said, listen, take this, within a month, no problem, it's all gone, now I'm not saying
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:23.760]  it'll help you in every case, there's a lot of this stuff so advanced, and once you get
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:28.200]  auto-immune problems in your gut, I've helped friends of mine go get parts of their guts
[1:50:28.200 --> 1:50:35.160]  removed, because it gets so serious, and I'm not here saying that we've got a panacea,
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:39.640]  you should consult your physician, but they call it quack, let's skip this one break,
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:43.840]  it's too important, sorry for the late notice on that, they call it quacky, they call it
[1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:50.760]  kooky, they call it nuts, in a bunch of publications on Monday, they said, look, when does Paltrow
[1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:54.840]  sell supplements, and so does Jones, they're both kooks.
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:51:02.560]  Now, obviously, I'm not responding to this because they're criticizing me, I don't care,
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:07.680]  I'm responding to educate folks on how whacked out they are, I'm talking 10 publications
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:16.200]  or more, I saw big ones, and they showed as proof of my kookiness a bag of coffee that
[1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:25.880]  we buy for $8 a pound, the very best organic, concentrated, high quality, grown in the mountains
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:30.680]  of Chiapas, Mexico, it's like watermelon coffee, but better, totally organic, everybody loves
[1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:38.520]  it, it's strong, two different varieties, and it's one of our best sellers now because
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:46.720]  we only mark it up 35%, nobody does that with coffee, so people are figuring out, wait, this
[1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:50.560]  really hot Mexican coffee that's so hot now, that I've been selling for six years because
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:55.920]  I liked it, I got it from the local distributors that get it from the Chiapas folks, who hand
[1:51:55.920 --> 1:52:01.360]  pick it on their own little farms, people are like, the average price of this is $25
[1:52:01.360 --> 1:52:12.560]  dollars, Alex sells it for $17.95, yes, this is the product we make the least amount of
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:17.560]  money on, because I just wanted to have a great coffee and be competitive, I think I'm
[1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:20.200]  going to raise prices though, it should be at least like $22 dollars, I mean we're just
[1:52:20.200 --> 1:52:24.440]  undercutting everybody, once folks try this and figure out this is the hottest coffee out
[1:52:24.440 --> 1:52:30.960]  there, one of the hottest coffees out there, but that's just what I do, and I just find
[1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:38.040]  it crazy, the thing they picked to demonize is organic volcanic grown mountain coffee,
[1:52:38.040 --> 1:52:42.920]  because Guatemala is great too, but it's over the mountain and it's kind of an overdone,
[1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:47.440]  they've used a lot of pesticides, it's big plantations, this is really organic hand
[1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:51.600]  grown, it's wild craft, it's the term they use, but it's all certified and the rest
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:58.640]  of it, I mean imagine, first thing you ask yourself is, why is the Washington Post come
[1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:04.200]  out and attacked us, a bunch saying I sell quack supplements, the Washington Post is
[1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:09.400]  owned by the biggest supplement seller in the world, go look it up, Bloomberg financial
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:15.760]  reports, Whole Foods and Amazon, the same company now, they're the biggest seller in
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:23.880]  the world, next is GNC, I mean we're not even in the top 100, but see we're evil, I sell
[1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:31.720]  the same coffee that's sold in Whole Foods for $7 to $10 less from the exact same co-op
[1:53:31.720 --> 1:53:41.600]  in Chiapas, so I'm evil selling something for $17.95 that's $25 or more, it's even
[1:53:41.600 --> 1:53:52.120]  bagged in the same bag, see coffee's quacky now, see I made jokes here that they make
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:56.240]  fun of me selling toothpaste, they go oh my gosh it's fluoride free, he's insane, you
[1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:01.200]  have the colloidal silver and all the rest of it, it shows the mindset of these people,
[1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:06.680]  so Myco ZX is back, we got free shipping to the month of July, I've extended it, we've
[1:54:06.680 --> 1:54:12.560]  got 30% off on BrainPors Plus, the Neutropic, SuperMail Vitality 30% off, Survival Surveillance
[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:18.440]  30% off, Z-Shield 30% off, DNA Force just got back in after being sold out for 5, 6 months
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:26.040]  or 4 months whatever it is, that's back discounted 20%, it's all there, infowarstore.com or
[1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:31.480]  triple 82533139, and when I say it's an act of persistence to get these products, it really
[1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:37.680]  is, I mean you're funding an organization that is seen as the most disruptive anti-globalist
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:43.920]  group in the world, and we're disrupting things to empower the people, we're disrupting the
[1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:48.640]  globalist, you know a lot of the choppest rebels that have fought off the corrupt Mexican
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:52.760]  government, they only helped the get were communists, now they're not communists anymore, most of
[1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:57.800]  them because they're making so much money off coffee, that's how I like attack communists
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:06.000]  is give them money, like that, yeah exactly, prosperity, we got articles about Venezuela,
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:11.960]  blood splattered on walls as members of parliament injured as rioters stormed Venezuela parliament,
[1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:16.760]  you know what, I can't do justice to North Korea, I can't do justice to the Olympics
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:22.560]  where men are gonna now take over, the Olympics basically if men adopt this, if men take advantage
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:26.680]  of this, the Olympics will only be male, except for shooting, women statistically if they're
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:31.520]  trained can be just as good as men shooters, sometimes better, but that's it, I mean it
[1:55:31.520 --> 1:55:36.400]  will be all male, I think it's awesome, I think it's hilarious, let the mental illness
[1:55:36.400 --> 1:55:43.480]  just flow, so I'm being sarcastic, and we'll get into CNN rock by a huge backlash after
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:48.200]  it, blackmail's creator of Trump's CNN meme, they committed a crime here according to state
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:51.640]  and federal law, we're gonna get to some of those clips, but we're gonna take your calls
[1:55:51.640 --> 1:55:56.240]  in the next hour, smattered in with these reports, I'd like to hear from first time
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:01.160]  callers today with good phones, I'd love to hear with folks with good clear phones, and
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:06.720]  I'd love to hear what you think about the North Korea situation, it's certainly escalating
[1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:11.160]  but maybe it's not a crisis, I certainly think it is, they're gonna start in about an hour,
[1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:14.840]  the big UN emergency meeting over this, with North Korea threatening to nuke everybody
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:21.480]  and has an ICBMs now, pretty serious, we can talk about this report as well, DNA discovery
[1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:25.800]  reveals genetic history of ancient Egyptians, I'll tell you about that coming up the start
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:32.760]  of the next hour, it's actually what the ancient Greeks said, what Plato said, Plato said
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:40.280]  that it was people from central Europe, or he had, from the coastline there, basically
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:46.280]  some of the same tribes that came down and created the Roman culture and some of those
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:50.120]  other cultures, they've done the DNA testing on a bunch of the most ancient mummies and
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:56.280]  they were central and southern Europeans, but it's not some bashing the Africans, I
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:03.680]  just always hear that civilization was stolen from Africans and you have to say that Chinese
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:08.120]  probably had the oldest civilization, they're not Africans, but you could argue that the
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:14.000]  humans originally originated in Africa, though now they've got some research that's not
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:18.840]  showing it, but it's not an attack on anybody, it's just what the DNA tests are showing and
[1:57:18.840 --> 1:57:30.840]  what, what 2400 years ago, the first global historian Plato said, Plato also said we should
[1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:34.200]  have a world government and kill all the poor people, he's kind of the model of the globalist
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:40.240]  today, wasn't a very nice guy, but the father of what you'd call philosophy, he was also
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:48.280]  historian, he said there was a base in the Atlantic Ocean that had flying machines and
[1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:53.520]  he said they created such an energy source so powerful that it blew up their entire island
[1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:58.760]  and made the earth dark for several years and made the temperature get cold, I actually
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:03.480]  have read Plato's writings on that, how would he come up with that, how would Plato come
[1:58:03.480 --> 1:58:04.480]  up with that?
[1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:13.400]  And he also said that it was people from the north of Greece that founded it and some of
[1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:16.800]  the same tribes that founded Greece he said founded Egypt, of course we know early on
[1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:22.080]  the first trade was between Greece and Egypt, of course that was always known, the Romans
[1:58:22.080 --> 1:58:27.400]  taught that but see in the modern culture people just said no that's not true, Africans
[1:58:27.400 --> 1:58:31.680]  founded Egypt and it is true by the middle period of Egypt they had brought in folks
[1:58:31.680 --> 1:58:35.720]  from all over the Middle East and they're intermarried and that it was true, they intermarried
[1:58:35.720 --> 1:58:41.080]  with kings of Ethiopia and other areas and had actually then no longer been European,
[1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:45.440]  that is true but Egypt was started by Europeans, we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen in
[1:58:45.440 --> 1:58:47.440]  70 seconds please stay with us.
[1:59:16.440 --> 1:59:23.480]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family, now in 2016 even more information
[1:59:23.480 --> 1:59:28.600]  has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts
[1:59:28.600 --> 1:59:33.800]  are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine, you can pull these
[1:59:33.800 --> 1:59:37.920]  studies up for yourself, this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is
[1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:43.960]  essential in my view to any optimum health regimen, stock up on survival shield x2 today
[1:59:43.960 --> 1:59:48.960]  at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:19.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:27.560]  Coming up your phone calls throughout the hour, you agree, you disagree, any of the
[2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:31.960]  services I covered, I just want you to be a first time caller with an Iotola, a rock
[2:00:31.960 --> 2:00:37.520]  and roll connection or maybe it's the GCN box, it's just the phone system may need to
[2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:42.720]  be revamped it's just been more and more scratchy, more and more, I'm not mad at GCN but our
[2:00:42.720 --> 2:00:47.280]  phone system is digital and better, I may just start taking all calls here, and Scott
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:49.800]  is doing a wonderful job up there, I don't want to put them down, it's just, something's
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:01:02.800]  going on, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:12.000]  Let me hit on this first because I just mentioned it and then I'm going to go to break, come
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:16.560]  back in the next long segment, take calls, and then I'm going to get into CNN caught
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:21.360]  bullying and committing crimes to get people to recant their political views or they'll
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:27.560]  expose them on television, true bullying by its very nature, coercion, violates New York
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:34.560]  law or CNN engaged in the activity, also federal law, but I don't always go with CNN, I don't
[2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:38.920]  go with Wikipedia, I actually go to where they say the research came from and then you
[2:01:38.920 --> 2:01:45.240]  go research if that's true or not, because CNN won't lie about a car wreck or a police
[2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:49.840]  shooting or you know a plane wreck or the weather, it'll just be on certain political
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:54.600]  things, people say well if CNN's fake news why are you reporting it, because CNN then
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:02:01.760]  proves themselves in this article and links to reports that have previously already been
[2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:08.000]  proven and is actually well known science, DNA discovery reveals genetic history of ancient
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.800]  Egyptians, mummy genome data have been extracted for the first time, that's because they've
[2:02:13.800 --> 2:02:17.800]  removed the head of antiquities who was there for 30-something years in Egypt who wouldn't
[2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:21.760]  let anybody DNA test it, remember that guy?
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:25.240]  Mummy genome data have been extracted for the first time, the mummies closer ancient
[2:02:25.240 --> 2:02:30.680]  relatives were found in the Near East and Europe, modern Egyptians have developed a
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:37.000]  greater amount of sub-saharan DNA, ancient Egyptians and their modern counterparts shared
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:40.800]  a lesson common than you might think, that is at least genetically a team of scientists
[2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:46.560]  have found, research is the university of, how do you pronounce that, juba gene and the
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:52.400]  Max Planck Institute for the science of human history in Jena, both in Germany, have decoded
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:56.520]  the genome of ancient Egyptians for the first time with unexpected results, really it's
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:03:01.000]  just everything Plato said, everything the Egyptians said, everything the Greeks said,
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:05.880]  publish it and things, everything Plato said is turning out true, publishing its findings
[2:03:05.880 --> 2:03:15.280]  in nature communications, the study concluded that preserved remains found at Abbasir el-Malik
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:20.960]  Middle Egypt were closest genetic relatives of the Neolithic and Bronze Age populations
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:27.320]  from the Near East and Eastern Mediterranean Europeans, modern Egyptians by comparison
[2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:33.560]  share much more DNA with sub-saharan populations, so it was a mix of Asians and Europeans just
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:40.920]  like you have with the Arabs and then the Babylonians up into what is ancient Iraq and
[2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:47.160]  then into ancient Iran, we're not getting into racist things here, this is just where
[2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:52.520]  the terms come from in anthropology, sociology and archeology, Iran means Aryan and all that
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:04:02.000]  means is that the Aryan people out of Europe that also founded, also founded India today
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:07.040]  and yes it was racist folks that was an uppercast of whites in India until just a few hundred
[2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:10.960]  years ago that ruled it, it's the same deal, same thing with Egypt, modern Egyptians by
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:16.200]  comparison share much more DNA with sub-saharan populations, the findings have turned years
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:24.480]  of theory on its head, causing Ethiopians and epidemiologists to reevaluate their region's
[2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:30.520]  history while unlocking new tools for scientists working in the field, Cleopatra was real folks
[2:04:30.520 --> 2:04:35.880]  and so was Mark Antony and he was married to her and he was a Roman and the Roman historian
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:43.920]  said she had beautiful light brown skin and many of the history said she had green eyes,
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:47.680]  she was obviously a mixed lady, it doesn't matter, the point is modern history says
[2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:53.200]  Mark Antony married a black lady which wasn't true, an African, it's just, it's how they
[2:04:53.200 --> 2:05:00.400]  tried to destroy history but the DNA then proves history was right, we'll be right back.
[2:05:00.400 --> 2:05:04.960]  The New York Times ran the headline Central Americans scared of what's happening in US
[2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:09.320]  staying put, this has been a popular talking point of the left aimed at demonizing President
[2:05:09.320 --> 2:05:13.520]  Trump's strong border policy, but think about the paradigm here, implying that somehow it
[2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:17.320]  is a bad thing that people aren't rushing to our country in droves because it's not
[2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:22.000]  easy to get in and reside here illegally anymore, the same people implying this also
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:27.160]  stressed the hardship of poor people specifically citing healthcare, well then how is more people
[2:05:27.160 --> 2:05:31.160]  here that are in need going to help that problem, so the Democrats complain all day
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:35.080]  about how we don't have enough welfare for Americans yet they want to take more people
[2:05:35.080 --> 2:05:39.160]  in here that need welfare, but really all President Trump is doing is enforcing border
[2:05:39.160 --> 2:05:43.440]  security and law, but since when is it just free for anyone to come here, since when is
[2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:47.920]  America supposed to have open doors for anyone, I don't see anyone from North America rushing
[2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:52.360]  to get into Central America, you know why, because you couldn't and it's better here,
[2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:58.280]  this all equates to one thing, more Democrats losing in upcoming elections, for infowars.com
[2:05:58.280 --> 2:06:01.280]  this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:06:01.280 --> 2:06:06.600]  Myco ZX is back in after five plus months sold out, talk about next level probiotic,

[2:07:58.040 --> 2:08:09.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:34.000]  Obviously President Trump has taken some video and put a CNN mic logo on who he's beating
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  up on.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:37.200]  Can I just get your reaction to that?
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:39.200]  He's wrestling with us.
[2:08:39.200 --> 2:08:44.320]  Look at this video from his Twitter account this morning, see that the CNN logo has been
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:47.640]  superimposed onto the other fighter's face.
[2:08:47.640 --> 2:08:50.840]  This showed up on a Reddit message board days ago.
[2:08:50.840 --> 2:08:54.280]  Now it's showing up on the President of the United States own Twitter feed.
[2:08:54.280 --> 2:08:59.120]  The media is outraged at Donald Trump for encouraging violence with this tweet.
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:01.360]  I can't believe you can defend this.
[2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:02.360]  I mean, really?
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:06.680]  Is there, is there no, so my question is, is there no line, like if that had been a picture
[2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:11.200]  not of the CNN logo or video not of the CNN logo, but it had been Jake Tapper's head he
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:12.200]  was punching.
[2:09:12.200 --> 2:09:13.800]  Would that cross the line for you?
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:15.200]  This is juvenile.
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:16.200]  Ridiculous.
[2:09:16.200 --> 2:09:21.640]  What if it was a picture of Donald Trump holding a bloodied CNN logo up with that cross the
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:22.640]  line?
[2:09:22.640 --> 2:09:23.640]  I think that is unacceptable.
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:26.640]  I think that is the President of the United States taking things way too far.
[2:09:26.640 --> 2:09:28.760]  It is an incitement to violence.
[2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:31.800]  He is going to get somebody killed in the media.
[2:09:31.800 --> 2:09:36.800]  They have taken things way too far and the media has gotten people shot and people killed
[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:37.800]  and people beat over the head.
[2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:40.960]  You're the ones all running around wanting to have a war.
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:44.200]  Somebody on Reddit put out a joke video of a fake fight.
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:50.720]  You're acting like it's the end of the world and you blackmail the person in the going
[2:09:50.720 --> 2:09:56.440]  along with a retraction saying they're sorry it's racist so that you can then try to demonize
[2:09:56.440 --> 2:10:01.920]  the President and cover up the fact he is trying to have a recovery in this country.
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:05.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to take your calls throughout this hour and
[2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:11.720]  then into the end of the hour and I'm going to get into the Russia-China-North Korea
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:18.520]  situation in detail, the collapse of the third world and where all that's going and a big
[2:10:18.520 --> 2:10:21.920]  stack of Islamist news that is just over the top.
[2:10:21.920 --> 2:10:24.560]  More cops are getting shot in the back of the head and killed.
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:28.160]  It's all part of the globalist operation for the summer when it was coming.
[2:10:28.160 --> 2:10:31.760]  It's all part of the destabilization, intimidation, bullying, operation.
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:33.640]  These thugs are running.
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:42.120]  Then they sit there and act all upset and have feigned anger at how dare the President tweeting
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:48.600]  a joke video of him kicking a fictional bobblehead CNN logo's butt.
[2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:49.840]  And it's the Streisand effect.
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:51.120]  They've tried to intimidate everybody.
[2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:52.520]  They've tried to say stop it.
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:59.360]  Now the Internet is awash in these and while we're taking some calls here for TV viewers,
[2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:08.840]  I'll play without audio some of those memes, both still memes and also graphic memes detailing
[2:11:08.840 --> 2:11:12.960]  how CNN is trying to stomp on the head of everybody's free speech.
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:17.920]  But the answer to attempts to bully everybody into submission is to counter it.
[2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:24.440]  And I would say on a scale of one to 10, we're about a seven with people breaking their conditioning
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:33.120]  and actually responding to attempts to silence and muzzle and stifle speech with just intensifying.
[2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:37.840]  I mean, there have been so many memes people have done of me getting beaten up or, you
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:41.520]  know, me getting my head chopped off and I've always just made a big joke out of it.
[2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:45.360]  I mean, quite frankly, when you're getting made fun of, that's a good thing.
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:49.280]  I mean, look at CNN's ratings are back up.
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:53.280]  But now the memes are just absolutely completely legion.
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:54.600]  Oh, I love that.
[2:11:54.600 --> 2:11:57.560]  The famous one of Muhammad Ali.
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:06.640]  I think he was fighting was it George Foreman and then he and they just miss him over and
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:07.640]  over again.
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:11.520]  But I like CNN's recommendation.
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:17.080]  How about we actually put some real people's heads on these?
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:22.280]  Why don't we put George Soros's head on some of this?
[2:12:22.280 --> 2:12:24.160]  I mean, we're not wanting real violence.
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:26.520]  We're saying it's a joke.
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:30.400]  I mean, it's the Islamists that the globalists are bringing into our country that actually
[2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:33.920]  kill us.
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:35.800]  But you know, you say that's okay.
[2:12:35.800 --> 2:12:37.680]  Well, then what about us just making jokes?
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:43.720]  I mean, now CNN's heads, CNN logos are being put on the heads of ISIS people as they chop
[2:12:43.720 --> 2:12:44.720]  folks heads off.
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:46.800]  Oh, CNN is terrorist.
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:48.640]  That meme's really taken off, hasn't it?
[2:12:48.640 --> 2:12:50.520]  That was the brainchild of Mike Cernovich.
[2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:55.440]  We have the contest going and we've had seven or eight people get paid out on it.
[2:12:55.440 --> 2:12:57.960]  Most folks aren't getting on live TV.
[2:12:57.960 --> 2:12:58.960]  They're just getting on the Internet.
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:01.240]  So it doesn't really win the prize, but it's had a huge effect.
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:02.240]  The meme's going.
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:03.240]  You're victorious.
[2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:06.080]  I want to pay out the other $180,000.
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:11.880]  We're not rolling in cash, but that's money well spent, $1,000 and $2,500 prizes.
[2:13:11.880 --> 2:13:16.720]  But again, contestedinfoors.com, sending your videos.
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:20.000]  If you haven't been paid up yet and you think you should be, send your video in again.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:21.500]  We have a couple of guys working on it part-time.
[2:13:21.500 --> 2:13:24.600]  That's why I don't do a lot of contests because they're usually very successful.
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:29.600]  This one already is, but then it's the digesting it and deciding if somebody wins and then
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:30.600]  watching it.
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:34.720]  But it isn't as successful as the Bill Clinton's a rapist deal because Bill Clinton and Hillary
[2:13:34.720 --> 2:13:37.680]  were out in the campaign trail two or three times a day.
[2:13:37.680 --> 2:13:38.680]  Folks were really destroyed them.
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:40.280]  It became a national news story.
[2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:44.200]  This has still been successful, but in the background, why suddenly is CNN getting called
[2:13:44.200 --> 2:13:45.200]  terrorist?
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:46.200]  Why are they getting called ISIS?
[2:13:46.200 --> 2:13:49.440]  Well, Jake Tapper and others say it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's in force.
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:50.440]  And that's right.
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:51.720]  I'm not even about the credit.
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:56.800]  I'm just about the meme taking place in the information war.
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:14:01.920]  I mean, here it is in the Associated Press today and in our team, we've been reporting
[2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:05.960]  this for years and hammering it the last few weeks, fishing while life came out and said
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:06.960]  we're right.
[2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:12.760]  It's 84% of smallmouth bass are female or male or totally deformed and can't have babies.
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:17.720]  And now feminized fish, human contraceptives and water supply causing males to grow eggs.
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:22.120]  And it's causing fish numbers to plummet.
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:27.360]  Now if it's doing this to fish, imagine what's doing to you because most of tap water is
[2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:30.840]  downstream and the government filtration systems are not cutting it out.
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:37.320]  If you're not drinking heavily filtered water, you are insane in the membrane.
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:41.720]  Number one for my research cancer cause out there is not even cigarettes or alcohol folks.
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:43.360]  It is the poison tap water.
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:47.000]  And I never read that or heard that when I was a kid.
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:51.640]  I remember in two days, I drink tap water and I'd feel sick from it, but if I got good
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:55.640]  bottle water or took purified water from home, my mom had a water cooler.
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:58.880]  She believed that even back when I was a kid, she got water out of Arkansas.
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:04.200]  I would feel great and I just learned that I learned about swallow a little bit of toothpaste
[2:15:04.200 --> 2:15:05.200]  by accident.
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:08.120]  I was bigging to brush my teeth with fluoride and feel sick.
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:09.400]  My dad is a dentist.
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:12.920]  He didn't even believe Florida was bad till about 10 years ago when I said, dad, read
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:14.880]  the medical literature out of Canada.
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:18.160]  This is the top dentist up there that got them fluoridated 20 years ago.
[2:15:18.160 --> 2:15:24.120]  Now 30 years ago, it's not, it's not calcium fluoride dad that we have to have to live
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:26.600]  a small amount of that does make teeth stronger.
[2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:32.540]  It's hydrofluorosilic acid electrified and it's a byproduct of aluminum smelting nuclear
[2:15:32.540 --> 2:15:35.520]  weapons production and Chinese plants as well.
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:38.440]  And they just dump it in phosphate mines.
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:41.640]  They just dump all this toxic waste in the water, calling it fluoride.
[2:15:41.640 --> 2:15:44.640]  My dad did the research and goes, you're absolutely right son, I can't believe this.
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:47.240]  How would the American Dental Association be part of this?
[2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:52.040]  As other dentists woke up about seven years ago, about three years after my dad woke up,
[2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:55.360]  it was about 12 years ago, he woke up, Tom's flies.
[2:15:55.360 --> 2:16:00.040]  You look it up, the American Dental Association said, stop using fluoride toothpaste for children.
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:04.240]  It causes dental fluorosis and has been linked to bone cancer.
[2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:08.560]  See, what are they going to do when the facts come for them?
[2:16:08.560 --> 2:16:13.580]  Bad boys, bad boys, what are you going to do when the information comes for you?
[2:16:13.580 --> 2:16:18.320]  So let's go to your phone calls right now and then we'll go through all this news ahead
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:22.600]  of the amazing Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:16:22.600 --> 2:16:28.280]  Other than Donald Trump or Donald Trump Jr., I mean, there's no libertarian conservative
[2:16:28.280 --> 2:16:32.280]  as big as Watson when it comes to social media.
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:33.800]  He's king.
[2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:38.200]  Average video, over a million views with them even trying to block him on one platform.
[2:16:38.200 --> 2:16:39.600]  Multiple platforms, several million.
[2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:43.880]  He was getting 30, 40 million views a few months ago as they started blocking it.
[2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:48.200]  It gets more Twitter impressions than all of the BBC's platforms combined.
[2:16:48.200 --> 2:16:54.040]  And they're trying to suppress him, but despite that, to see him busting through like, you
[2:16:54.040 --> 2:16:58.680]  know, the slits, malt, liquor, bull through the wall, I mean, it is just awesome.
[2:16:58.680 --> 2:16:59.680]  So he's coming up.
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:10.360]  Let me see Daredevil, Lisa, Charles, Noreen, Kyran, my eyes are now, at least be 20, 20.
[2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:12.880]  I can't even hardly, I got to get that screen closer.
[2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:17.360]  Karen, Noreen, everybody, we're going to go to you.
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:22.360]  Noreen is watching us in Michigan over Facebook live feed.
[2:17:22.360 --> 2:17:26.400]  Remember, when you're watching us on a live feed on Facebook, YouTube, prisonplanet.tv,
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:30.320]  MFullWars.com, sports live show, spread that link.
[2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:31.320]  It's not work.
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:32.320]  It's war.
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:33.320]  It's winning.
[2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:36.440]  I know you're spreading the links by hand to get around their bots and their blockers.
[2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:41.560]  Please keep doing it, whether it's by email or by person, by mouth, whatever.
[2:17:41.560 --> 2:17:45.760]  Noreen, thank you for calling from the great state of Michigan and starting to see a little
[2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:47.520]  bit of a revival.
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:48.760]  Noreen, thanks for calling.
[2:17:48.760 --> 2:17:49.760]  Thank you.
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:50.760]  Thank you.
[2:17:50.760 --> 2:17:51.760]  You bet.
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:52.760]  Go ahead.
[2:17:52.760 --> 2:17:58.760]  Thank you for everything that you've been through with all the threats and everything
[2:17:58.760 --> 2:17:59.760]  that you've got.
[2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:05.400]  You stick through it and you get through half when you do that because no one else really
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:06.400]  does that.
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:09.920]  And I used to watch CNN all the time until I figured it out they were fake.
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:12.400]  So I just wanted to thank you for that.
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:13.400]  Well, Noreen.
[2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:16.120]  Listen, you know, Limbaugh used to tell folks, just say kudos.
[2:18:16.120 --> 2:18:17.200]  I want you to thank me.
[2:18:17.200 --> 2:18:18.200]  I love the audience.
[2:18:18.200 --> 2:18:19.200]  I'm humbled by you.
[2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:21.000]  You have to understand something.
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:24.200]  I understand the globalist one, austerity and enslavement.
[2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:29.920]  So like a man in the water trying to get out who's drowning, I'm just instinctive here.
[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:30.920]  Let me tell you something.
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:33.560]  I want to thank you for making the broadcast possible.
[2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:36.280]  And I want to explain something to you.
[2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:37.480]  You are the resistance.
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:39.320]  You're the reason people are waking up.
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:42.400]  You're the reason people are taking action.
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:43.760]  All of you out there.
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:49.440]  So just to understand that, it's a pleasure to have this child molester run Vatican attack
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:50.440]  me.
[2:18:50.440 --> 2:18:52.360]  It's a pleasure to have evil CNN lie about me.
[2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:53.920]  It's an honor.
[2:18:53.920 --> 2:18:56.720]  Even though it's painful for my family, they understand it.
[2:18:56.720 --> 2:19:01.600]  I don't overall enjoy it personally sometimes, but it's got to be done.
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:02.680]  So thank you for the support.
[2:19:02.680 --> 2:19:03.680]  Go ahead.
[2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:08.320]  Yeah, I really appreciate it all because it's really amazing.
[2:19:08.320 --> 2:19:10.280]  You know, I also got your product.
[2:19:10.280 --> 2:19:12.800]  I got brain force that really helped me.
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:14.240]  It made me feel really smart.
[2:19:14.240 --> 2:19:16.440]  Actually, I really liked that.
[2:19:16.440 --> 2:19:19.640]  I got my dad's got that in his room.
[2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:23.880]  I got the shirt with the 2020 shirt.
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:25.440]  I have that on now.
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:28.200]  Um, yeah, I just really like all those products.
[2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:32.680]  We also got the other thing.
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:35.000]  I forgot what it's called.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  It's like brain force.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  It came with it.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:41.440]  Well, let me just say this because the media and then we get back to your political point,
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:43.320]  but I appreciate you supporting us.
[2:19:43.320 --> 2:19:44.320]  Let me explain something.
[2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:49.520]  But Clinton Foundation, not their new foundation that hundreds of, you know, millions stolen
[2:19:49.520 --> 2:19:52.600]  per month, basically 40 something million dollars on it.
[2:19:52.600 --> 2:19:56.600]  Last time I checked robbing the Haitians, you name it, controlling hundreds and hundreds
[2:19:56.600 --> 2:20:01.480]  of other big charities that schools and colleges and, you know, even the first Methodist Church
[2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:03.680]  of Austin gives people's money into.
[2:20:03.680 --> 2:20:07.240]  I mean, it's just a sick, evil demonic joke.
[2:20:07.240 --> 2:20:17.400]  But if you expand on all of that and really pull back from it, they say in, in, in 1993
[2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:21.800]  and their official White House papers, we've got to stop the new media forming.
[2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:25.960]  Joseph Farah and his Western Journalism Center later became world net daily.
[2:20:25.960 --> 2:20:30.440]  If they ever are able to sell books or videos and fund themselves, it'll create a chain
[2:20:30.440 --> 2:20:33.880]  reaction of choice and a new economy.
[2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:38.600]  We need the big corporate sponsors to understand they've got an intensify funding of mainstream
[2:20:38.600 --> 2:20:44.760]  media, legacy media, and we've got to make sure that we ridicule and attack anybody that
[2:20:44.760 --> 2:20:49.960]  sponsors new media, not just conservative, but also liberal or we'll lose control.
[2:20:49.960 --> 2:20:57.040]  So they hate the fact you buy t-shirts or water filters or great non GMO heirloom seeds,
[2:20:57.040 --> 2:21:01.720]  all this stuff, great quality competitive pricing, because if you ever start not buying
[2:21:01.720 --> 2:21:05.600]  from Bezos, who's openly trying to overthrow the country, richest man in the world after
[2:21:05.600 --> 2:21:11.520]  Bill Gates, if you ever realize that actually buy direct from mom and pops, local stores,
[2:21:11.520 --> 2:21:16.880]  support local sponsors of stations from shopping carts like infowarstore.com, you're getting
[2:21:16.880 --> 2:21:23.240]  products but then allowing that profit to go to promote ideas you believe in.
[2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:25.720]  I mean, look, say which one about the Muslims.
[2:21:25.720 --> 2:21:28.480]  They're the biggest group of giving politically of any group.
[2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:30.520]  That's why they're so powerful.
[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:34.480]  So you're not just giving straight up, you're getting good products at good prices and then
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:41.160]  knowing you're giving it to zealots, crazed individuals committed to an absolute war against
[2:21:41.160 --> 2:21:43.540]  the new world order to the end.
[2:21:43.540 --> 2:21:45.200]  And so yes, it's a total win-win.
[2:21:45.200 --> 2:21:51.320]  So that mere act of financially supporting us is an absolutely revolutionary act and
[2:21:51.320 --> 2:21:59.360]  it allows us, see, here's the deal, 10 years ago, Noreen, 11 years ago, I had media attacking
[2:21:59.360 --> 2:22:03.960]  me demonizing me, calling me a profiteer saying it was evil that I was selling books and videos
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:05.680]  and t-shirts.
[2:22:05.680 --> 2:22:08.920]  And there I was with like 10 crew members under attack.
[2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:09.920]  I knew I could grow.
[2:22:09.920 --> 2:22:13.560]  I knew I could launch something 20 times bigger and I said, I came on air.
[2:22:13.560 --> 2:22:16.600]  We got to find those clips and I said, you want to call me a profiteer?
[2:22:16.600 --> 2:22:19.520]  You want to claim, you know, I want to be this big fish?
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:24.520]  Watch this and we've hit every goal by your support and by God's providence and we're
[2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:29.760]  now preparing to go to the next level, which has them completely panicked, ready to kill
[2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:30.760]  me.
[2:22:30.760 --> 2:22:33.880]  By the way, they're assassinating my character in preparation for that, just like Trump.
[2:22:33.880 --> 2:22:35.880]  But that's okay.
[2:22:35.880 --> 2:22:39.680]  God will provide for my family, my children, I believe, but whatever happens is God's
[2:22:39.680 --> 2:22:40.680]  plan.
[2:22:40.680 --> 2:22:45.600]  I mean, so, so all I ask is that, you know, some flesh be spared.
[2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:47.880]  So understand folks, they want it.
[2:22:47.880 --> 2:22:48.880]  They got it.
[2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:54.800]  They shut us down, made me a humble person, give them a real run for their money.
[2:22:54.800 --> 2:22:59.360]  And so that's what we're doing here, but it's because of you, Noreen, that isn't me patting
[2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:00.360]  on the head.
[2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:04.440]  You, through info wars and other things you're doing are changing the world.
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:06.880]  So don't thank me, thank yourself and thank God.
[2:23:06.880 --> 2:23:07.880]  Go ahead, Noreen.
[2:23:07.880 --> 2:23:08.880]  What's your political points?
[2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:17.200]  I'm really, I've been for Trump since, I wasn't for Trump when it first started, but after
[2:23:17.200 --> 2:23:20.120]  I started watching you, you know, I was for Trump and stuff.
[2:23:20.120 --> 2:23:22.640]  My dad watches him for words as well.
[2:23:22.640 --> 2:23:24.120]  My dad, he's a warrior.
[2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:25.440]  He was in the army.
[2:23:25.440 --> 2:23:27.080]  I'm going into the army.
[2:23:27.080 --> 2:23:28.680]  I'm getting ready for that.
[2:23:28.680 --> 2:23:30.760]  My dad, they wouldn't even let him in at first.
[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:33.320]  Actually, it was a famous story all over the news.
[2:23:33.320 --> 2:23:39.960]  He walked all the way to Washington from Michigan and because they wouldn't let him in because
[2:23:39.960 --> 2:23:41.520]  they said he had a foot problem.
[2:23:41.520 --> 2:23:45.880]  So he walked with combat boots and he walked straight all the way to Washington until he
[2:23:45.880 --> 2:23:51.400]  got stopped by a general and told that they want to take him back.
[2:23:51.400 --> 2:23:56.400]  So they took him back and he got into the army and he went through all of that to get
[2:23:56.400 --> 2:23:57.400]  in.
[2:23:57.400 --> 2:23:58.760]  And I'm really impressed by that.
[2:23:58.760 --> 2:23:59.960]  Seems I've heard of that story.
[2:23:59.960 --> 2:24:02.840]  That was a long time ago, but you know, send me a news clipping about that.
[2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:05.000]  I'd love to have your, love to have your dad on.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  That's awesome.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:09.080]  Listen, I want to thank you so much for calling in God bless you.
[2:24:09.080 --> 2:24:12.760]  You know, they've tried to play me off against Trump with the infighting, the number one thing
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:18.760]  to stop the new media and a global movement of liberty is to always get us to want credit
[2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:20.960]  or to fight with each other.
[2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:24.560]  And Megan Kelly was like, you know, it's been proven that you're the reason Trump won, which
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:25.560]  isn't really true.
[2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:26.560]  It's my audience.
[2:24:26.560 --> 2:24:27.760]  Our audience did push Trump over the edge.
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:29.120]  He's told me that personally many times.
[2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:30.120]  They know that.
[2:24:30.120 --> 2:24:31.120]  Stephen Bannon knows that.
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:33.360]  I'm not going to get into private conversations.
[2:24:33.360 --> 2:24:34.360]  It doesn't matter.
[2:24:34.360 --> 2:24:35.880]  Trump's down the big target.
[2:24:35.880 --> 2:24:36.880]  Okay.
[2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:40.400]  We got Trump in the position of having to lose a lot of his wealth and charge a machine
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:43.160]  gun nest.
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:44.160]  He's in there.
[2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:45.160]  He's not doing a perfect job.
[2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:48.040]  I'm surprised he's doing the job he's doing.
[2:24:48.040 --> 2:24:49.040]  He's under more attacks.
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:55.880]  Anybody says George Washington and he's delivering and you know a man by his enemies.
[2:24:55.880 --> 2:24:58.320]  It's incredible.
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:02.520]  And I've expected him to not do as good a job as he did.
[2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:06.240]  I just can't believe what a good job he's done.
[2:25:06.240 --> 2:25:07.240]  I just can't believe it.
[2:25:07.240 --> 2:25:09.080]  But again, there's not just evil in the world.
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:11.800]  He got the idea that corruption is just the way it is.
[2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:12.800]  Roll over and accept it.
[2:25:12.800 --> 2:25:13.800]  Thank you.
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:14.800]  Last caller.
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:15.800]  All right.
[2:25:15.800 --> 2:25:18.360]  Let's go to Daredevil in the great state of Texas.
[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:19.360]  Daredevil.
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:20.360]  You're on the air.
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:21.360]  Hi, Alex.
[2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:27.800]  I'm calling on a Liberty rally at the Texas State Capitol this Sunday at high noon.
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:31.960]  You know, the mayor recently said that he felt he was besieged by Texans and he better
[2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:36.960]  feel like it because I'm calling on this rally to happen every Sunday at high noon until
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:41.040]  we can reestablish Liberty in this country again because I'll be darned if they keep
[2:25:41.040 --> 2:25:43.080]  shoving this United Nations stuff down our throat.
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:47.280]  Yeah, for folks that don't know, I mean, I used to hear about this 25 years ago and didn't
[2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:49.480]  believe it myself.
[2:25:49.480 --> 2:25:53.880]  Under immunization, Austin is a sister city.
[2:25:53.880 --> 2:25:55.080]  I forget which one in Japan.
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:25:57.280]  I want to say Kyoto.
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:25:58.840]  And it's actually a UN program.
[2:25:58.840 --> 2:26:03.880]  And then the first city that Loretta Lynch, Attorney General said that was under strong
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:09.600]  cities was Austin, but then even the police chief himself didn't go along with it.
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:13.880]  I mean, they were going to have the UN over the Justice Department, over Austin.
[2:26:13.880 --> 2:26:19.000]  I mean, we went to these meetings where they had actual Red Guard communists that call
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:24.640]  for violence at the police board meetings with the UT staff running it.
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:26.840]  I mean, these people, this is a revolution.
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:29.200]  This is a criminal takeover.
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:33.200]  And yeah, for folks that don't know, Austin is a beautiful place, best city in Texas,
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:39.320]  you know, for the size as the Great Travis County, but it is a globalist enclave now.
[2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:40.600]  It's very, very sad.
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:42.120]  But Texans are fighting back.
[2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:43.120]  Go ahead.
[2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:44.120]  Exactly.
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:51.600]  And, you know, this is also a famous date, July 9, 1776 was actually when New York adopted
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:52.600]  the Declaration of Independence.
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:56.840]  A lot of people, you know, they want to bully Trump because he's not getting things done.
[2:26:56.840 --> 2:26:58.480]  Their eyes aren't open.
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:02.280]  General Washington couldn't even get New York to adopt the Declaration of Independence
[2:27:02.280 --> 2:27:08.640]  until July 9, 1776, so July 4 is actually July 9 in New York.
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:15.000]  Similarly, Trump's facing all sorts of similar backlash where we want Americanism, not globalism,
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:18.520]  but they can stir that into, oh, well, you know, he's got money in his pocket, so he's
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:19.520]  against me.
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:22.640]  What do you think about that?
[2:27:22.640 --> 2:27:28.360]  It's the instant gratification culture where Trump has gotten more done in six months than
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:32.040]  I ever imagined he would get done in his first year or two years.
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:34.120]  You know a man by his enemies.
[2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:38.360]  Globalism is ultra-rich that won a monopoly.
[2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:39.720]  Trump's exposed that.
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:42.320]  He's bringing back real prosperity.
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:45.920]  Ron Paul has agreed with his economic policies but says it's too little, too late.
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:50.760]  We're going to see what happens, but it's a lot of ignorant people being politically
[2:27:50.760 --> 2:27:51.760]  directed.
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:56.880]  It's folks that still believe mainstream media, people that are still in a trance, still in
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:28:01.160]  suspended disbelief, they're in suspended disbelief.
[2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:04.720]  Just like when you go to a movie theater and you go into a trance, they're believing MSN.
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:06.240]  They believe Stephen Colbert.
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:09.600]  They believe they're doing the trendy thing and that everyone's against Trump and that
[2:28:09.600 --> 2:28:12.600]  Trump's really in the KKK.
[2:28:12.600 --> 2:28:17.120]  And they had invested themselves in the establishment, even though they didn't get power out of it,
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:22.120]  even though they didn't get any money out of it, on average, they still had their identity
[2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:23.120]  in it.
[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:28.960]  So they feel like losers now because the dumb hillbillies, as they see it, took control
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:29.960]  of the country.
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:32.920]  They're just the Midwesterners and they're not dumb hillbillies and it was people all
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:38.600]  over the country of every color, from every walk of life, that don't want to be Venezuela
[2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:41.480]  or North Korea or Communist Russia.
[2:28:41.480 --> 2:28:49.520]  And they'll understand that Trump's policies are basically identical to JFK's and that
[2:28:49.520 --> 2:28:51.000]  that's what we need for prosperity.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:56.480]  And the Democratic Party of today has become a satanic monstrosity, basically.
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:28:57.480]  Go ahead.
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:29:05.280]  Exactly, Trump's slowly titrating the establishment away, slowly decreasing their effect on us.
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:07.680]  Everything, like you say, that's inverted reality.
[2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:12.040]  They say that the mayor says, oh, I feel deceived because they're the ones deceiving us.
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:13.880]  They're the ones, oh, I'm moving to Austin.
[2:29:13.880 --> 2:29:15.800]  We're going to turn Texas blue.
[2:29:15.800 --> 2:29:16.800]  It's going to be so awesome.
[2:29:16.800 --> 2:29:17.800]  We're going to have a little ball.
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:20.880]  Yeah, we're going to come to Texas and take your guns and teach your five-year-olds how
[2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:21.880]  to be a tranny.
[2:29:21.880 --> 2:29:22.880]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:27.600]  Yeah, exactly, 99% of the earth's going to get cold off, live in a bubble city, it'll
[2:29:27.600 --> 2:29:28.600]  be fantastic.
[2:29:28.600 --> 2:29:31.640]  The board knows that overpopulate, when it's not even true, I've read figures, and you
[2:29:31.640 --> 2:29:36.680]  had a guest on years ago, I can't recall, it's probably around, let's say about 2008,
[2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:39.120]  and he spoke about how seven and a half billion...
[2:29:39.120 --> 2:29:41.160]  You put everybody in the state of Texas.
[2:29:41.160 --> 2:29:45.000]  Some areas are overpopulated because they're technology and what they have, but other areas
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  aren't.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  The point is we always innovate our way out of crises.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  Thank you, Daredevil.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  We're called for it.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:30:01.260]  The only thing that matters on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.260 --> 2:30:04.440]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again.
[2:30:04.440 --> 2:30:09.260]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and No IQ Mica last week, Trump got back on Twitter
[2:30:09.260 --> 2:30:14.920]  yesterday and posted a short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo,
[2:30:14.920 --> 2:30:16.280]  a total classic.
[2:30:16.280 --> 2:30:20.440]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN
[2:30:20.440 --> 2:30:23.880]  and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment,
[2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:26.920]  citing grounds that the president is mentally unfit to serve.
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:29.400]  Now, this would require a medical examination,
[2:30:29.400 --> 2:30:32.520]  which may come back to bite the Democrats that are calling for it.
[2:30:32.520 --> 2:30:35.800]  You see, given a fair examination of the president's health,
[2:30:35.800 --> 2:30:37.560]  Trump will pass with flying colors.
[2:30:37.560 --> 2:30:39.480]  But imagine if the tables were turned,
[2:30:39.480 --> 2:30:43.480]  and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren,
[2:30:43.480 --> 2:30:46.520]  and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test,
[2:30:46.520 --> 2:30:48.360]  given the importance of their jobs.
[2:30:48.360 --> 2:30:50.920]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[2:30:50.920 --> 2:30:52.600]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[2:30:52.600 --> 2:31:22.440]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:31:22.600 --> 2:31:25.560]  Your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[2:31:25.560 --> 2:31:27.080]  your family, your children,
[2:31:27.080 --> 2:31:29.560]  to the best job you can to purify your error.
[2:31:29.560 --> 2:31:32.280]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[2:31:32.280 --> 2:31:35.480]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid
[2:31:35.480 --> 2:31:37.480]  most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[2:31:37.480 --> 2:31:38.600]  The general public doesn't.
[2:31:39.720 --> 2:31:43.640]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:31:43.640 --> 2:31:47.240]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:31:47.240 --> 2:31:49.880]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[2:31:49.880 --> 2:31:53.960]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:31:53.960 --> 2:31:56.840]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[2:31:56.840 --> 2:32:22.280]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[2:32:22.280 --> 2:32:23.400]  I don't feel good.
[2:32:23.400 --> 2:32:27.160]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[2:32:27.160 --> 2:32:29.880]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale.
[2:32:29.880 --> 2:32:32.120]  I had a few bottles at my house,
[2:32:32.120 --> 2:32:35.640]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:38.040]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good,
[2:32:38.600 --> 2:32:42.120]  and I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[2:32:42.120 --> 2:32:44.360]  So, obviously, a superfemale is amazing.
[2:32:44.360 --> 2:32:44.920]  I love it.
[2:32:44.920 --> 2:32:47.640]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[2:32:47.640 --> 2:32:48.680]  Survival Shield X2.
[2:32:48.680 --> 2:32:51.000]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing,
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:54.760]  then I would suggest it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2.
[2:32:54.760 --> 2:32:56.440]  It's got a five-star rating.
[2:32:56.440 --> 2:33:24.280]  It's a win-win, m4warslife.com.
[2:33:24.280 --> 2:33:29.080]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies, and disinformation.
[2:33:29.640 --> 2:33:32.360]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m., 3 p.m. Central.
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:35.640]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour
[2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:38.040]  from Herbotanic Majesties London, England.
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:40.120]  Not only news tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:42.360]  Infowars.com is the news site.
[2:33:42.360 --> 2:33:46.520]  We've got calls like Lisa and many, many others
[2:33:46.520 --> 2:33:49.160]  that are patiently holding Blake and Charles,
[2:33:49.160 --> 2:33:50.680]  and others we're going to be getting to you.
[2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:54.040]  Leanne McAdoo taking a summer sabbatical
[2:33:54.040 --> 2:33:56.440]  to go take care of her grandmother out in Florida,
[2:33:56.440 --> 2:33:57.640]  also traveling some to Europe,
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:34:00.600]  popping in reporting for m4wars.com.
[2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:01.960]  I really enjoyed having her on last week.
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:03.480]  She'll be popping on routinely,
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:05.800]  then also reporting from some foreign countries for us,
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:07.720]  or even getting her a news team set up.
[2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:10.920]  Leanne, when I asked you what you wanted to cover today,
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:12.760]  when I wanted to get you on, you were on the same page.
[2:34:12.760 --> 2:34:13.720]  I'm glad you wanted to cover this
[2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:15.720]  because I haven't really gotten into it yet.
[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:19.400]  Seeing in saying, we'll expose your identity
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:22.920]  if you don't come out and retract this and say it was racist.
[2:34:22.920 --> 2:34:24.840]  Well, they can come out and demonize somebody if they want,
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:27.880]  but they can't say retract this, say it's racist,
[2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:30.440]  or we will destroy you in the news.
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:34.440]  That's called Blackmail, and Paul Watson has linked
[2:34:34.440 --> 2:34:38.680]  in the story at m4wars.com the U.S. Code and the New York Law.
[2:34:39.240 --> 2:34:41.960]  And Julian Assange has tweeted that they just committed
[2:34:41.960 --> 2:34:47.160]  the crime violating 135.60 of New York criminal code coercion.
[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:51.400]  Terroristic threats, you name it, it's all in this report.
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:54.280]  And Julian Assange breaks it down.
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:34:57.480]  Leanne McAdoo, it seems like everything CNN does,
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:34:59.160]  they don't have the Midas touch.
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:01.480]  Everything they touch turns to oblivion.
[2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:05.080]  Right, the American people are watching the mainstream media
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:07.480]  in their death spiral asking,
[2:35:07.480 --> 2:35:09.880]  how deep does this chasm get?
[2:35:09.880 --> 2:35:14.440]  And CNN says, hold my beer, and issues this exclusive report.
[2:35:14.440 --> 2:35:17.320]  And I really don't think that CNN was expecting
[2:35:17.320 --> 2:35:21.480]  the bipartisan pushback against this style of reporting,
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:26.120]  where they've basically threatened the life of a private citizen.
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:31.000]  They're going to ruin his life unless he never posts things
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:33.160]  that are offensive again on the internet.
[2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:37.000]  He has to take down all of his posts that are bigoted
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.320]  and what they deem inappropriate.
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:43.720]  And also this paragraph in the CNN article is so chilling.
[2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:46.280]  They say they're not going to post his identity.
[2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:49.320]  They're not going to out him, because he's a private citizen.
[2:35:49.320 --> 2:35:53.000]  And he's issued an extensive statement of apology.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:54.840]  He took down his offending post.
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:35:58.840]  And he says that he hopes his statement can serve as an example
[2:35:58.840 --> 2:36:03.080]  to others that they won't post anything like that on the internet either.
[2:36:03.080 --> 2:36:07.240]  Otherwise, CNN, they're going to go ahead and oust this private citizen
[2:36:07.240 --> 2:36:10.040]  who's basically throwing himself on the court saying,
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:13.080]  please don't ruin my life, you're going to embarrass my family,
[2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:16.200]  I've taken it all down, please don't ruin me.
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:22.520]  This is like the forced apology by Otto Warmbier there in North Korea.
[2:36:22.520 --> 2:36:25.320]  I mean, we have stepped into a sassy gulag right now
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:28.280]  when they are saying we are going to destroy you
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:31.960]  unless you stop offending us with your memes.
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:34.040]  Alex, this is a meme, it's a gift.
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:39.160]  And frankly, it was President Trump wrestling at the WWE.
[2:36:39.160 --> 2:36:40.440]  It was there, it was an actual media.
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:46.120]  It was a total joke against the backdrop of leftist media financing plays
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:47.160]  where Trump's killed.
[2:36:47.160 --> 2:36:50.520]  Every major newspaper having editorialists saying kill Trump,
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:54.520]  celebrating people that try to kill Trump, it's just insane.
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:59.160]  Right, and they're trying to say that this gift that the president tweeted out,
[2:36:59.160 --> 2:37:02.200]  retweeted, is inciting violence against journalists.
[2:37:02.200 --> 2:37:04.280]  And they're really trying to push this narrative.
[2:37:04.280 --> 2:37:06.680]  Maybe they would have taken them a little more seriously
[2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:11.880]  if it didn't take them 24 hours to fire Kathy Griffin for her beheading of Trump
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:13.720]  art that they labeled was art.
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:17.640]  I mean, let's not forget, this is CNN who on Inauguration Day
[2:37:17.640 --> 2:37:21.800]  was wargaming what would happen if the president was assassinated.
[2:37:21.800 --> 2:37:25.480]  For hours they were saying, what would happen if someone just took an aim at
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:29.000]  Donald Trump right now before he's sworn in?
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:30.040]  I mean, what would happen?
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:34.520]  This is CNN who's now asking the American people to feel sorry for them
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:38.040]  because the president tweeted a gift that hurt their feelings.
[2:37:38.040 --> 2:37:41.400]  And Leigh Ann McAdoo in FullWars.com reporter analyst,
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:47.720]  we see the way Trump is very deft at not going too far.
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:49.160]  They have bloody severed heads.
[2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:50.280]  They say murdering.
[2:37:50.280 --> 2:37:52.680]  They say the guy's a hero that shot Scalise.
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:55.800]  The Democrats say hashtag hunt Republicans on and on and on.
[2:37:55.800 --> 2:38:00.680]  He just puts out an old video WWE that somebody else made with a CNN logo.
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:01.800]  It's not Hillary's head.
[2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:06.200]  If the president did some video shoot with a bloody head of Hillary,
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:08.840]  I would say that's deranged.
[2:38:08.840 --> 2:38:09.960]  That's mentally ill.
[2:38:09.960 --> 2:38:10.840]  He's got problems.
[2:38:10.840 --> 2:38:11.400]  That's too far.
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:12.520]  But he's not the one.
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:19.480]  He responds to an avalanche, a tsunami, a storm of just war drums
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:23.480]  and calls for violence and planning violence and real violence
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:27.000]  by anti-fog attacking peaceful people and WikiLeaks exposing all this.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:31.080]  And we know that the CNN has contact with the NSA and the deep state leakers.
[2:38:31.080 --> 2:38:32.600]  We know they staged the debates.
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:35.480]  We know they're in the WikiLeaks staging things with Democrats.
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:39.320]  You know they probably got this guy's data very, very quickly from sources.
[2:38:39.880 --> 2:38:44.840]  So what you're seeing is deep state going after citizens to make examples of them,
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:48.600]  to scare other people from not going out and resisting this.
[2:38:48.600 --> 2:38:52.680]  And I don't think I've ever seen anything blow up in CNN's face bigger.
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:57.000]  Not all the fake video shoots, not all the fake news, not them having to retract.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:02.760]  I mean, CNN is just melting down and then Trump, like a judo master,
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:05.320]  is just throwing them through the wall using their own energy.
[2:39:06.360 --> 2:39:06.680]  Right.
[2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:11.000]  I mean, they're basically, let's just sit back and watch them destroy themselves.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:13.240]  And the American people are saying, look, enough.
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:18.200]  I mean, it would be one thing if this gif maker was a Russian agent.
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:19.560]  Then we'd have something there.
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:21.880]  But he wasn't even a Russian agent.
[2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:25.800]  He's just a guy who's saying, please don't ruin my life and my family's life.
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:31.480]  But the American people are asking CNN and these other outlets, get back to your job,
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:33.800]  report the news, tell us what's going on in the world.
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:40.440]  So CNN, they're not issuing an update on Fast and Furious or IRS targeting of conservatives
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:42.440]  or Hillary Clinton's private server.
[2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:43.400]  That doesn't matter.
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:50.440]  They've got the exclusive, they went in and they're gonna unmask the identity of this private citizen.
[2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:51.080]  That's right.
[2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:52.760]  In these videos, I'm gonna play one in a moment.
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:56.440]  They are just sycophantically getting off on their power.
[2:39:56.440 --> 2:40:01.640]  This shows the bottom of the barrel people CNN's had to get to carry out all this line.
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:06.840]  Why do you think every progressive month, they keep recycling different reporters,
[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:12.840]  bringing in new ones, the quality of the people they're bringing in is the worst I've ever seen.
[2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:15.080]  Local news has better people, Leigh Ann.
[2:40:15.800 --> 2:40:16.280]  Right.
[2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:19.000]  Well, and we know that they like anonymity.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:22.760]  They've done tons of reporting with their anonymous sources.
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:26.600]  So it's not that they're against anonymity on the internet or wherever,
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:31.800]  but they just don't want you to be anonymous if you're doing things that they don't like.
[2:40:31.800 --> 2:40:35.640]  And that's what this very frightening precedent is that they are setting right now,
[2:40:35.640 --> 2:40:38.600]  is who's a private citizen anymore?
[2:40:38.600 --> 2:40:42.040]  If your content goes viral, can we destroy your life?
[2:40:42.040 --> 2:40:43.880]  When did CNN become Gawker?
[2:40:43.880 --> 2:40:45.880]  Is my question back to your question.
[2:40:45.880 --> 2:40:49.320]  When did they become Gawker with this terrible style of reporting,
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:55.000]  where they think now they're the news and all they do is report on Trump's Twitter?
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.720]  They don't give us any news that we actually can use.
[2:40:58.280 --> 2:41:01.160]  And I don't think they understand the Streisand effect, Leigh Ann.
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:02.520]  You've talked about that before.
[2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:04.600]  Why don't you explain to CNN the Streisand effect?
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:07.320]  Because apparently they don't know.
[2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:12.280]  You tell someone to stop talking about something, then the internet is going to say,
[2:41:12.280 --> 2:41:16.440]  well, what's over there you don't want me to see and then, of course, it's just going to get expounded
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:20.360]  and the whole world is going to know now about what CNN is up to.
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:23.640]  So this was the wrong move.
[2:41:23.640 --> 2:41:28.200]  And you even are seeing a lot of never Trumpers on the internet and other places saying,
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:30.280]  this was the bad move by CNN.
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:31.080]  You shouldn't have done this.
[2:41:31.080 --> 2:41:33.240]  Just ignore Trump's Twitter.
[2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:34.840]  You're destroying yourselves.
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:39.400]  I've got to say that the Muhammad Ali, where he famously dodges like seven punches,
[2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:42.920]  like Superman, that should be the new Trump icon and logo.
[2:41:42.920 --> 2:41:44.840]  Because the truth is they're the ones attacking him.
[2:41:44.840 --> 2:41:46.520]  He's known as the counterpuncher.
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:48.600]  I know he admired Muhammad Ali and his friends with him.
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:52.440]  And the way he sits there with his head on Muhammad Ali politically,
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:53.640]  that's what Trump's been doing.
[2:41:53.640 --> 2:41:54.600]  I mean, this is crazy.
[2:41:55.800 --> 2:41:56.040]  Right.
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:02.120]  I've seen some really good gifts now because, of course, nobody should post anything on the
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:04.120]  internet that makes CNN look bad.
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:05.000]  Don't do it.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:08.280]  I'm not saying you should go out and make a very hilarious gift.
[2:42:08.280 --> 2:42:12.120]  It's like Como, Chris Como goes, you're not allowed to look at WikiLeaks.
[2:42:12.120 --> 2:42:12.920]  It's illegal when you do.
[2:42:12.920 --> 2:42:14.200]  You have to get it from us.
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:19.000]  The condescension is an 11 on a scale of 1 to 10.
[2:42:20.200 --> 2:42:20.920]  Exactly.
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:25.480]  And the people are sick and tired of it, but they're in such a bubble.
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:30.600]  They're in such an ivory tower that they just don't realize that down here,
[2:42:30.600 --> 2:42:33.400]  the real people are laughing at them.
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:36.600]  And frankly, we're laughing at the president's tweets as well.
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:39.000]  His modern day presidential tweets.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:39.560]  We get it.
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:43.480]  We're not offended by him putting out a wrestling meme.
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:47.960]  Yeah, it's a little bit different than President Obama and his selfie sticks,
[2:42:47.960 --> 2:42:49.400]  but not too much different.
[2:42:50.040 --> 2:42:54.520]  Everyone loved when President Obama was meeting with the YouTube lady that
[2:42:54.520 --> 2:42:57.080]  is in a bathtub full of Cheerios or whatever.
[2:42:57.080 --> 2:42:57.880]  That was hilarious.
[2:42:57.880 --> 2:43:01.800]  They keep saying, stop doing the Twitter, trying to get weak-minded people to think
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:03.800]  that that's his weakness when it's his strength.
[2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:06.680]  They obviously want him cut off from directly communicating.
[2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:11.320]  And again, it's a metaphor for all of us when we share a meme or an info war story
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:14.920]  or a president planet.com story or a video, because we are the tip of the spear.
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:16.280]  We're under the greatest attack.
[2:43:16.280 --> 2:43:20.600]  We need your support more than ever to overpower their system.
[2:43:20.600 --> 2:43:21.400]  Now there's Como.
[2:43:21.400 --> 2:43:23.000]  Remember, blackmailing is illegal.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:24.520]  It's different for the media, though.
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:26.200]  That's why I made a meme out of that.
[2:43:26.200 --> 2:43:27.320]  Paul Watson retweeted that.
[2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:28.760]  He's coming up in the next hour.
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:33.320]  I want to get a few calls, Leigh Ann, and also invite you in the next few weeks
[2:43:33.320 --> 2:43:36.920]  when you're about to spend some more time with your grandmother to host an hour or two
[2:43:36.920 --> 2:43:38.760]  of these new shows we're about to launch.
[2:43:38.760 --> 2:43:42.520]  A lot is about to happen here in the next month at Info Wars.
[2:43:42.520 --> 2:43:46.920]  But expanding on this, here is the clip of CNN licking their lips.
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:48.120]  CNN New Day.
[2:43:48.120 --> 2:43:52.920]  This is them just 24 hours ago until they figured out that they just jumped the shark.
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:43:55.800]  Participation.
[2:43:55.800 --> 2:43:58.600]  Okay, so another issue that came up here.
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:00.440]  Something remarkable I thought happened yesterday.
[2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:05.800]  I thought it was remarkable that CNN found this, the Reddit user who created the gift
[2:44:05.800 --> 2:44:10.760]  of, you know, Donald Trump in the wrestling video and where he punches CNN.
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:14.520]  So the investigative team went back and found the guy who first created this.
[2:44:14.520 --> 2:44:15.560]  He took credit for it.
[2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:17.320]  And then here comes the remarkable part.
[2:44:17.960 --> 2:44:19.320]  He apologized.
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:21.880]  He apologized for having done this.
[2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:29.160]  How often do you hear someone who creates a video that goes viral then say this?
[2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:33.160]  This is what he tried to destroy his life unless he writes this thing.
[2:44:33.160 --> 2:44:34.520]  He's a witch and he's babies.
[2:44:34.520 --> 2:44:35.720]  He did it in anti-Semitic.
[2:44:35.720 --> 2:44:37.480]  These are the other posts that were on his account.
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:39.240]  I am in no way this kind of person.
[2:44:39.240 --> 2:44:43.320]  I would never support any kind of violence or actions against others simply for what
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:47.720]  they believe in nor would I carry out any violence against anyone based upon that or
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:48.680]  support anyone who did.
[2:44:48.680 --> 2:44:49.640]  He went on.
[2:44:49.640 --> 2:44:50.600]  He was so.
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:52.840]  But then why is there so much stuff on his account?
[2:44:52.840 --> 2:44:53.720]  He deleted it.
[2:44:53.720 --> 2:44:59.240]  Hey, can we put out Kim Jong-un a bunch of memes ourselves with a CNN head on Kim Jong-un and
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:01.480]  just say, you know, don't criticize us or else.
[2:45:02.280 --> 2:45:03.320]  Don't talk about the dear leader.
[2:45:07.320 --> 2:45:08.600]  Here is one more.
[2:45:08.600 --> 2:45:11.320]  Here's CNN losing their minds over the meme.
[2:45:11.320 --> 2:45:12.200]  This is really important.
[2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:13.400]  We'll take some of your phone calls.
[2:45:13.400 --> 2:45:13.880]  Here it is.
[2:45:14.840 --> 2:45:18.680]  Say where the president got the video, but a senior White House official said today
[2:45:18.680 --> 2:45:23.160]  it was not from Reddit, which is a popular internet messaging board.
[2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:27.080]  The problem is we, another media outlet to a search, can't find any evidence of it
[2:45:27.080 --> 2:45:29.320]  existing anywhere but Reddit.
[2:45:29.320 --> 2:45:30.360]  Let's have a special prosecutor then.
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:31.720]  You see where the president picked it up.
[2:45:31.720 --> 2:45:32.920]  Now, why does that matter?
[2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:38.120]  Because if he got it from that source, a whole bunch of new questions about racism,
[2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:40.520]  bigotry and violence come into play.
[2:45:44.120 --> 2:45:49.720]  The video shared by President Trump to 33 million personal Twitter followers and then
[2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:55.640]  to 19 million more on his presidential account was apparently first posted by a Reddit user
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:46:00.520]  who goes by this online name and who has also laid claim to it.
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:04.200]  That user of Reddit's online message board reacted.
[2:46:04.200 --> 2:46:07.080]  Notice they black it out not to give the user any attention.
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:12.280]  Don't they get now the new memes have got to be in the hundreds of millions of views per hour?
[2:46:12.280 --> 2:46:14.600]  Don't they understand the Streisand effect again, Leigh Ann?
[2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:20.200]  Right. And everybody out there who's posting on Reddit needs to pay attention to this.
[2:46:20.200 --> 2:46:25.000]  They are trying to set the precedent that if you dare post anything that they don't like,
[2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:28.120]  they have the right now to ruin your life.
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:30.600]  Whereas private citizens in the past have been protected.
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:31.640]  Again, how do they discover it?
[2:46:31.640 --> 2:46:32.760]  That's the real investigation.
[2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:36.040]  I bet my bottom dollar they got this from all their sources.
[2:46:36.040 --> 2:46:39.320]  I mean, listen, I've talked to Stone, I've talked to other folks off record about this.
[2:46:39.320 --> 2:46:48.040]  We know that mainstream media has intel on us that no one that even my wife doesn't know.
[2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:50.280]  Okay, I mean, it's come out.
[2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:51.000]  We're wiretapped.
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:52.200]  I mean, that's been in the news.
[2:46:52.200 --> 2:46:55.640]  I mean, every phone I've got is it's come out from the sheriff's department.
[2:46:55.640 --> 2:46:57.480]  They had access to a DEA database.
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:46:58.200]  We're being watched.
[2:46:58.200 --> 2:46:58.920]  We're being listened to.
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:03.880]  And guaranteed they just dial up find out who he is.
[2:47:03.880 --> 2:47:04.680]  That's a crime.
[2:47:04.680 --> 2:47:06.760]  We need to investigate CNN for the crime.
[2:47:06.760 --> 2:47:09.720]  They've already committed the crime, Leigh Ann, of the coercion.
[2:47:10.520 --> 2:47:10.760]  Right.
[2:47:10.760 --> 2:47:14.040]  Well, you know, years ago, they tried to make us all feel safe.
[2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:16.040]  Don't worry if you've got nothing to hide,
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:18.760]  then you shouldn't worry about the NSA spying on you.
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:22.520]  But that was, that was what was at issue was that some of these NSA agents
[2:47:22.520 --> 2:47:26.680]  were using the tools that they had to spy on their ex-girlfriends
[2:47:26.680 --> 2:47:29.720]  or to post things on the internet of people they wanted to get back at.
[2:47:29.720 --> 2:47:31.400]  Stone said it was rampant.
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:32.920]  He said most people were doing it.
[2:47:33.640 --> 2:47:33.960]  Right.
[2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:36.440]  And so now where's CNN getting this information?
[2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:39.320]  Now, I'll give him a little bit of credit because they hired this writer,
[2:47:39.320 --> 2:47:41.400]  Andrew Kaczynski, from Buzzfeed.
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:46.760]  And he was very, very, very good at finding obscure things on the internet.
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:49.880]  And being basically opposition, opposition research.
[2:47:49.880 --> 2:47:51.560]  So of course, CNN scooped him up.
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:55.640]  He created this whole new K file sector of CNN.
[2:47:55.640 --> 2:47:59.880]  So he might really have been able to dig in and find out who's on this Reddit.
[2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:02.760]  But yeah, this is also very much.
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:07.240]  But CNN's been giving NSA and CIA data illegally reported to be used in the campaign
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:08.440]  and against private citizens.
[2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:09.560]  We know all about Seth Rich.
[2:48:10.280 --> 2:48:10.600]  Right.
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:14.760]  And they're trying to make the argument that Trump is attacking the independent media,
[2:48:14.760 --> 2:48:17.800]  even though we know they're not independent at all.
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:19.560]  They colluded with the DNC.
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:22.680]  I mean, they didn't even do this type of investigation
[2:48:22.680 --> 2:48:26.920]  into all the memes that were attacking their dear leader, Hillary Clinton.
[2:48:26.920 --> 2:48:31.160]  Imagine if they would have outed all the memesters and the giftsters.
[2:48:31.160 --> 2:48:34.200]  Back then, when they were destroying Hillary Clinton,
[2:48:34.200 --> 2:48:34.920]  they didn't even go.
[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:38.200]  It was, it was when it went too far and embarrassed CNN.
[2:48:38.200 --> 2:48:44.200]  That's when they really had to expose this private citizen or issue this blanket warning
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:47.400]  to anyone who was there, let the service of warning to you.
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:49.240]  Here's the takeaway for me.
[2:48:49.240 --> 2:48:51.240]  And then I'm going to take a call and get your take on this, Leigh Ann.
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:53.480]  The intimidation and bullying isn't working.
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:56.040]  It's like when Hitler goes, oh, the Brits aren't giving up.
[2:48:56.040 --> 2:49:01.000]  Let's start bombing the towns that have been designated for the orphans and kids being evacuated,
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:02.040]  you know, out of the cities.
[2:49:02.040 --> 2:49:03.960]  So when Hitler started targeting the kids,
[2:49:04.920 --> 2:49:08.360]  and of course the Brits started targeting Dresden and the German kids as well,
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:13.160]  it did not make the Brits went from not wanting the war to wanting to kill everybody.
[2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:16.600]  So I don't understand this thing where these bullies think they mess with us.
[2:49:16.600 --> 2:49:17.720]  It makes us back down.
[2:49:17.720 --> 2:49:19.400]  It just gives me energy, Leigh Ann.
[2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:20.680]  It just makes me want to take action.
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:22.200]  Absolutely.
[2:49:22.200 --> 2:49:26.200]  And people need to start posting more gifts and memes now to let them see.
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:28.760]  Look, you're not going to CNN, first of all,
[2:49:28.760 --> 2:49:33.080]  is not going to control free speech on the Internet or anywhere else.
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:34.920]  You're not going to be the gatekeepers.
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:38.680]  And that's what they're so afraid of is that they are no longer the gatekeepers
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:41.240]  and that it is the wild, wild West on the Internet.
[2:49:41.240 --> 2:49:45.640]  And that's why they are trying to now change the precedent of who is a private citizen.
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:46.840]  When are we allowed to do this?
[2:49:46.840 --> 2:49:49.480]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm the greatest catcher in the world or anything,
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:53.240]  but the few times I had a girlfriend that I was finally done with and a few that
[2:49:53.240 --> 2:49:54.440]  lived with me or vice versa.
[2:49:54.440 --> 2:49:56.280]  As soon as you start packing your stuff up and leaving,
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:49:57.400]  they try to physically stop you.
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:49:59.720]  I know it's statistically worse for women as well.
[2:49:59.720 --> 2:50:02.280]  That's when they panic and get violent and try to keep from going.
[2:50:02.280 --> 2:50:04.040]  This is like an abusive relationship.
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:05.480]  They don't want us to go out the door.
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:06.760]  They won't let us leave them.
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:10.440]  So they're terrorizing the country to make themselves pertinent,
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:13.640]  knowing that no one would be watching them if they weren't saying kill the president,
[2:50:13.640 --> 2:50:15.240]  kill congressmen, do all this.
[2:50:15.240 --> 2:50:18.280]  Then when we respond lightly back, they throw a hissy fit.
[2:50:18.280 --> 2:50:20.200]  But let me manipulate the meme here.
[2:50:20.200 --> 2:50:22.120]  I do not want to be in memes.
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:24.440]  I do not want to be in these comedy memes.
[2:50:24.440 --> 2:50:25.880]  Do not put me in memes.
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:28.440]  Everyone is bad for putting me in a meme.
[2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:32.280]  And I do not want to have my head put on Trump's head battling CNN.
[2:50:32.280 --> 2:50:35.400]  No one is allowed to put me in memes because quite frankly,
[2:50:35.400 --> 2:50:36.840]  Trump is the number one meme right now.
[2:50:36.840 --> 2:50:38.760]  I I'm only number two.
[2:50:38.760 --> 2:50:39.080]  Okay.
[2:50:39.080 --> 2:50:40.040]  And I am competitive.
[2:50:40.040 --> 2:50:40.760]  Make fun of me.
[2:50:40.760 --> 2:50:41.320]  Whatever.
[2:50:41.320 --> 2:50:42.280]  Please put me in memes.
[2:50:42.280 --> 2:50:42.760]  Oh, excuse me.
[2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:48.040]  I mean, never, never you are hereby ordered like CNN said,
[2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:49.400]  we'll have you arrested.
[2:50:49.400 --> 2:50:50.760]  I'll sue you.
[2:50:50.760 --> 2:50:52.200]  You have no free speech.
[2:50:52.200 --> 2:50:56.280]  Put me in no memes and have no info wars dot com involved that it ever.
[2:50:59.800 --> 2:51:04.280]  It's been said any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[2:51:04.280 --> 2:51:05.880]  Those times may be near.
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:06.680]  Think about it.
[2:51:06.680 --> 2:51:11.400]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:16.360]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[2:51:16.360 --> 2:51:20.360]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long term outages
[2:51:20.360 --> 2:51:22.200]  from a single cyber attack.
[2:51:22.200 --> 2:51:24.600]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises,
[2:51:24.600 --> 2:51:28.840]  the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:31.880]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:34.680]  That's where my patriot supply comes in.

[2:51:59.720 --> 2:52:00.600]  This is Dan Pilla.
[2:52:00.600 --> 2:52:02.360]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:03.960]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[2:53:23.960 --> 2:53:26.200]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[2:54:26.120 --> 2:54:27.240]  Paul Watson tweeted about it.
[2:54:27.240 --> 2:54:27.720]  We checked it.
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:33.320]  It's true that the top hashtag off and on throughout the day, it's been the top 10.
[2:54:34.040 --> 2:54:38.360]  Hashtag CNN blackmail was at the top.
[2:54:38.360 --> 2:54:39.480]  And so everybody was seeing it.
[2:54:39.480 --> 2:54:42.760]  Well, it's been removed by the people at Twitter.
[2:54:43.560 --> 2:54:50.600]  Well, good luck about hashtag CNN blackmailed censored.
[2:54:51.400 --> 2:54:54.120]  Just everybody write about the blackmail, write about their corruption,
[2:54:54.120 --> 2:54:58.680]  write about their evil, give them what they want, hammer them, and never stop.
[2:54:59.960 --> 2:55:03.240]  That's how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:05.480]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, I don't see this going well for them.
[2:55:05.480 --> 2:55:07.080]  And you can see this trend.
[2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:08.520]  I mean, I don't put a good face on things.
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:10.360]  You know, years ago, you criticized me into my face.
[2:55:10.360 --> 2:55:11.720]  And that didn't work positive.
[2:55:11.720 --> 2:55:12.600]  That's how we're going to fix things.
[2:55:12.600 --> 2:55:15.640]  But now I'm more positive because the worm is turning.
[2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:16.200]  What do you think?
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:18.120]  I kind of agree.
[2:55:18.120 --> 2:55:20.120]  I mean, look at this huge smile on my face.
[2:55:20.120 --> 2:55:24.600]  We are still battling them, but it's interesting to see
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:26.840]  that we're landing some of our punches finally.
[2:55:26.840 --> 2:55:28.840]  It's really interesting to watch.
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:31.080]  Going back to talking about the gatekeepers, though,
[2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:35.080]  you can see with them taking down the trending hashtag.
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:37.560]  Twitter is, of course, trying to be the gatekeeper as well.
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:39.880]  They're not independent platform anymore.
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:42.920]  Now you see the top worldwide top trend
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:45.000]  is something with the Kardashians, of course.
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:46.040]  It's the whole bread and circle.
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:47.400]  They always forced that back on.
[2:55:47.400 --> 2:55:49.240]  You know, you're not going to have free speech.
[2:55:49.240 --> 2:55:50.520]  You're, here's Kardashians.
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:52.120]  Exactly.
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:55.480]  That's their go-to bread and circuses right now
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:55:57.960]  in our present day and age.
[2:55:57.960 --> 2:56:00.120]  But I want people to kind of get back to see,
[2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:01.800]  oh, stop talking about CNN.
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:03.400]  Who cares if they don't matter?
[2:56:03.400 --> 2:56:04.120]  You know, who cares?
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:07.720]  The reason why this matters is because they are trying
[2:56:07.720 --> 2:56:10.520]  to make the argument of when it's, when it's,
[2:56:11.720 --> 2:56:14.280]  we shouldn't have any more online anonymity.
[2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:15.880]  So we have Cuomo saying that.
[2:56:15.880 --> 2:56:16.840]  That's Internet ID.
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:19.160]  They want us on there so that they can, you know, exactly.
[2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:21.320]  And we've talked about this before.
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:23.000]  They want to do that three strikes.
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:24.680]  You're out roll where, where you,
[2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:27.240]  you can never access the Internet anymore
[2:56:27.240 --> 2:56:28.280]  with your identity.
[2:56:28.280 --> 2:56:31.160]  That's what China wants and that's what Soros wants
[2:56:31.160 --> 2:56:33.720]  is this new social network deal where you have no anonymity
[2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:35.960]  and then everything you do on the Internet and outside
[2:56:35.960 --> 2:56:37.320]  is on a social score.
[2:56:38.280 --> 2:56:39.240]  Exactly.
[2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:43.160]  And this is the conversation CNN is using to justify
[2:56:43.160 --> 2:56:45.640]  outing a private citizen because they looked
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:48.120]  and he also had some anti-Semitic memes
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:49.400]  and things on his Reddit page.
[2:56:49.400 --> 2:56:49.800]  I don't know.
[2:56:49.800 --> 2:56:52.200]  They called criticizing the Federal Reserve.
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:53.640]  They call me anti-Semitic.
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:55.000]  They just make that up.
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:57.160]  Let's take a call here from Matt Denlysa.
[2:56:57.160 --> 2:56:58.600]  Matt, thanks for holding.
[2:56:58.600 --> 2:57:01.320]  You're on from the great state of Texas with Leanne McAdoo.
[2:57:02.840 --> 2:57:05.400]  Well, thanks for having me and good to see you back, Leanne.
[2:57:06.040 --> 2:57:08.360]  I want to start where I woke up.
[2:57:08.360 --> 2:57:14.920]  I was in Amsterdam waiting for my plane to go to London
[2:57:14.920 --> 2:57:18.520]  in 2012 and I was watching the commentary
[2:57:18.520 --> 2:57:20.040]  about the presidential election.
[2:57:20.040 --> 2:57:21.960]  Mind you, this is in a foreign country.
[2:57:21.960 --> 2:57:25.400]  And they told me on their screen
[2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:27.800]  that Ron Paul was in second place.
[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:32.920]  Whenever I left, Rick Santorum and what was the other guy's
[2:57:32.920 --> 2:57:36.840]  name, Mitt Romney, and then Barack Obama
[2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:38.280]  were the three front runners.
[2:57:38.280 --> 2:57:40.360]  Didn't say anything about Ron Paul.
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:43.160]  Well, over there, they said Ron Paul was in second place
[2:57:43.160 --> 2:57:45.240]  and that was my first realization
[2:57:45.240 --> 2:57:47.320]  that the media was actually lying to us.
[2:57:47.320 --> 2:57:51.000]  And then whenever I came back, I'm a chef by trade
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:52.920]  and I was introduced to some people
[2:57:52.920 --> 2:57:54.120]  that wanted me to participate
[2:57:54.120 --> 2:57:56.040]  in a dinner for cuisine for healing.
[2:57:56.040 --> 2:57:57.640]  They gave me a list of criteria to meet.
[2:57:58.280 --> 2:58:01.560]  And it scared me because I gave the list
[2:58:01.560 --> 2:58:03.720]  to a large food service purveyor
[2:58:03.720 --> 2:58:07.560]  and they have 20,000 items in stock
[2:58:07.560 --> 2:58:10.760]  and only 60 met the criteria.
[2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:14.920]  The criteria was no GMOs, no hormones, no antibiotics,
[2:58:14.920 --> 2:58:16.920]  no pesticides, no insecticides.
[2:58:16.920 --> 2:58:18.840]  And let me guess, this dinner was for elites.
[2:58:19.800 --> 2:58:25.560]  No, actually it was a benefit for cancer survivors
[2:58:25.560 --> 2:58:27.160]  because a lady created it.
[2:58:27.160 --> 2:58:28.680]  Because she had terminal cancer,
[2:58:28.680 --> 2:58:31.320]  it didn't actually help her live longer
[2:58:31.320 --> 2:58:33.800]  but it actually increased the quality of life
[2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:35.080]  while she was here.
[2:58:35.080 --> 2:58:35.720]  And that said-
[2:58:35.720 --> 2:58:36.200]  Hold on, Matt.
[2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:37.160]  I'm going to come back in 70 seconds
[2:58:37.160 --> 2:58:38.200]  to have you briefly finish up
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:41.640]  than at least Charles, then Paul Watson's coming up.
[2:58:42.200 --> 2:58:43.320]  He's in the bullpen.
[2:58:43.320 --> 2:58:43.960]  He's ready.
[2:58:44.760 --> 2:58:46.520]  Champion Paul Watson, straight ahead.
[2:58:46.520 --> 2:59:16.360]  More of Leanne McAdoo, straight ahead.

[3:00:37.240 --> 3:00:39.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:40.440]  You know, I like these longer intros,
[3:00:40.440 --> 3:00:41.640]  but I'm going to cut these back soon,
[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:43.240]  which is kind of stingers that come in and out
[3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:44.920]  because we need all the time to be on air,
[3:00:44.920 --> 3:00:46.600]  but it is fun.
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:48.040]  Matt, real quick, you're a great caller.
[3:00:48.040 --> 3:00:49.560]  I want to get some of these other amazing callers.
[3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:51.880]  Thank you.
[3:00:51.880 --> 3:00:54.920]  I just want to say on the GMO staff,
[3:00:54.920 --> 3:00:56.760]  whenever I started looking into
[3:00:57.560 --> 3:00:59.080]  why they were trying to kill us,
[3:00:59.080 --> 3:01:00.520]  I was led to Dr. Group,
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:02.520]  and that's actually what led me to you.
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:04.760]  And I have bought your products.
[3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:06.840]  I have my own restaurant.
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:10.360]  I actually wear your shirt in an open kitchen,
[3:01:10.360 --> 3:01:12.120]  whether it's the Bill Clinton Rape shirt
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:14.840]  or the Hillary from prison or...
[3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:15.160]  Awesome.
[3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:17.160]  Oh, even the new one,
[3:01:17.160 --> 3:01:20.040]  I get so much resistance from the left,
[3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:21.880]  and some of them, when they come in and see it,
[3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:23.160]  you can see it on their face.
[3:01:23.160 --> 3:01:25.880]  They cower down and don't say anything.
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:28.280]  And that's what we're dealing with,
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:30.440]  is all the cowards that are out there
[3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:32.360]  that are trying to take over our country and...
[3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:33.560]  I agree.
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:36.200]  And they think if they grovel to the system
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:37.640]  and do whatever Stephen Colbert says,
[3:01:37.640 --> 3:01:38.840]  that America will be successful,
[3:01:38.840 --> 3:01:40.440]  they think we're holding them back,
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:41.400]  even though it's the opposite.
[3:01:41.400 --> 3:01:43.000]  Leanne McAdoo, thanks for the call, Matt.
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:44.760]  Yeah, that was a great caller.
[3:01:44.760 --> 3:01:46.600]  Really interesting to see that one of these
[3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:48.920]  large food purveyors didn't have any of the food
[3:01:48.920 --> 3:01:50.920]  that they're selling to the stores and restaurants
[3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:51.960]  that are feeding us.
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:01:55.080]  None of those high-quality food products,
[3:01:55.080 --> 3:01:57.400]  of course, non-GMO, no pesticides.
[3:01:57.400 --> 3:01:59.800]  That's an important thing for people to know out there.
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:00.600]  And I want to be clear.
[3:02:00.600 --> 3:02:02.760]  I'm not some food-naughtsier, super health guy.
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:03.720]  I'm having to get rid of those,
[3:02:03.720 --> 3:02:05.160]  just because I have children and I care.
[3:02:05.160 --> 3:02:06.920]  And the evidence is overwhelming, folks.
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:09.560]  GMO is not like you just cross two plants.
[3:02:09.560 --> 3:02:11.320]  I mean, they're putting insect genes in.
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:13.320]  They're putting pesticide genes in,
[3:02:13.320 --> 3:02:16.520]  where it creates pesticides in the food
[3:02:16.520 --> 3:02:17.720]  so that bugs won't eat it.
[3:02:17.720 --> 3:02:19.880]  And then it bioaccumulates and eats your liver.
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:23.080]  I mean, it is just like, whoa, you mean some of this GMO
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:24.920]  is worse for my liver than Jack Daniels?
[3:02:24.920 --> 3:02:25.880]  I mean, it is just-
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:28.920]  Perforating your intestinal linings,
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:31.720]  giving us all sorts of gastrointestinal disorders
[3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:32.760]  and things.
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:34.680]  But it's just evolution.
[3:02:34.680 --> 3:02:36.520]  You know, cancer is totally normal.
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:37.880]  Yeah, dying is totally normal.
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:39.320]  Dying early, no big deal.
[3:02:39.320 --> 3:02:40.520]  Let's talk to them.
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:41.560]  Let's talk to Lisa.
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:42.840]  You're on the air with Leanne McAdoo,
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:43.720]  broadcasting worldwide.
[3:02:43.720 --> 3:02:45.960]  Thanks for calling, Lisa.
[3:02:45.960 --> 3:02:46.760]  Hi.
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:49.320]  I just wanted to say that, you know,
[3:02:49.320 --> 3:02:53.000]  I really love how the enemy combatants media
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:55.320]  is so upset about Trump tweets.
[3:02:55.320 --> 3:02:57.800]  When, you know, you see like Obama going around
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:02:59.960]  talking to world leaders and things like that,
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:01.960]  kind of, you know, it's just-
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:04.680]  And saying American patriotism is dangerous.
[3:03:04.680 --> 3:03:06.680]  Yeah, I mean, talk about in our,
[3:03:06.680 --> 3:03:09.480]  and talk about in our face, talk about arrogant.
[3:03:09.480 --> 3:03:11.240]  Did you hear how the French president says,
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:13.240]  I'm going to be a god emperor like Zeus?
[3:03:14.520 --> 3:03:16.120]  That's Jupiter and Roman.
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:17.320]  Greek, it's Zeus.
[3:03:17.320 --> 3:03:18.680]  I mean, what a little screwball.
[3:03:19.880 --> 3:03:20.440]  I know.
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:22.840]  And so, you know, they're all upset about that,
[3:03:22.840 --> 3:03:24.120]  but then this is going on.
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:27.080]  And I mean, I can't believe the lies.
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:30.200]  I wish people could understand and think of it
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:31.640]  more on an individual level,
[3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:33.320]  instead of, you know, just a huge big thing
[3:03:33.320 --> 3:03:34.840]  that's not really affecting them.
[3:03:34.840 --> 3:03:36.600]  It is really a direct attack.
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:37.800]  Everything they're doing is a-
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:42.120]  I agree, but doesn't Macron sitting there on a throne,
[3:03:42.120 --> 3:03:45.160]  just on a narcissistic loon ball event?
[3:03:45.160 --> 3:03:47.720]  I mean, no one would hang around with this guy anywhere.
[3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:50.680]  But because he was a child sex toy of the elite,
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:51.720]  which they admit now,
[3:03:52.280 --> 3:03:56.520]  since he was a child sex toy of the globalists,
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:03:57.320]  it's like now they're going to say,
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:03:59.160]  we have to worship their sex toy.
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:01.400]  I mean, he's basically a Rothschild butt plug.
[3:04:02.920 --> 3:04:04.120]  Yeah, he married his Nana.
[3:04:04.120 --> 3:04:09.160]  I mean, imagine the Rothschilds laughing at us right now.
[3:04:09.160 --> 3:04:12.760]  We have to worship their sex toy and put it on a throne.
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:14.600]  That's worse than Caligula marrying his horse.
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:15.640]  What do you think, Leigh Ann?
[3:04:16.600 --> 3:04:19.960]  I think it's really difficult to keep my composure sometimes
[3:04:19.960 --> 3:04:21.720]  when I'm on the other line with you.
[3:04:21.720 --> 3:04:25.080]  She brings up a great point, though.
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:26.360]  You know, let's pay attention to the fact
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:29.080]  that Bill Clinton, no one's talking about him going around
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:31.320]  and talking to the country's mayors,
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:34.200]  trying to get the mayors to go around the president's orders
[3:04:34.200 --> 3:04:35.400]  and say, you guys, you're just a businessman.
[3:04:35.400 --> 3:04:36.600]  Sure, Leigh Ann, you know I'm rarely vulgar.
[3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:39.560]  But I mean, if he's saying he's God, he's Jupiter,
[3:04:40.760 --> 3:04:43.560]  on a little throne, he looks like Napoleon.
[3:04:43.560 --> 3:04:45.240]  Let's both say hi to Paul.
[3:04:45.240 --> 3:04:49.160]  Paul Watson, now talk about God Emperor.
[3:04:49.160 --> 3:04:50.680]  I'm not saying he's actually got Emperor,
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:52.280]  but compared to Macron, he is.
[3:04:52.280 --> 3:04:53.800]  The God Emperor, straight ahead.
[3:04:57.320 --> 3:04:59.080]  The New York Times ran for president
[3:04:59.080 --> 3:05:01.320]  Trump's strong border policy,
[3:05:01.320 --> 3:05:02.680]  but think about the paradigm here,
[3:05:02.680 --> 3:05:04.760]  implying that somehow it is a bad thing
[3:05:04.760 --> 3:05:07.080]  that people aren't rushing to our country in droves
[3:05:07.080 --> 3:05:10.520]  because it's not easy to get in and reside here illegally anymore.
[3:05:10.520 --> 3:05:12.920]  The same people implying this also stress
[3:05:12.920 --> 3:05:16.360]  the hardship of poor people, specifically citing health care.
[3:05:16.360 --> 3:05:18.840]  Well, then how is more people here that are in need
[3:05:18.840 --> 3:05:20.840]  going to help that country?
[3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:22.840]  Well, I think it's really difficult to get into this.
[3:05:22.840 --> 3:05:24.840]  I think it's really difficult to get into this.
[3:05:24.840 --> 3:05:26.840]  I think it's really difficult to get into this.
[3:05:26.840 --> 3:05:29.560]  There are people here that are in need going to help that problem.
[3:05:29.560 --> 3:05:31.160]  So the Democrats complain all day
[3:05:31.160 --> 3:05:33.560]  about how we don't have enough welfare for Americans,
[3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:36.440]  yet they want to take more people in here that need welfare.
[3:05:36.440 --> 3:05:38.120]  But really, all President Trump is doing
[3:05:38.120 --> 3:05:40.280]  is enforcing border security and law.
[3:05:40.280 --> 3:05:42.840]  But since when is it just free for anyone to come here?
[3:05:42.840 --> 3:05:45.960]  Since when is America supposed to have open doors for anyone?
[3:05:45.960 --> 3:05:47.800]  I don't see anyone from North America rushing
[3:05:47.800 --> 3:05:49.240]  to get into Central America.
[3:05:49.240 --> 3:05:52.120]  You know why? Because you couldn't, and it's better here.
[3:05:52.120 --> 3:05:53.960]  This all equates to one thing,
[3:05:53.960 --> 3:05:56.680]  more Democrats losing in upcoming elections.
[3:05:56.680 --> 3:05:59.080]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[3:06:01.160 --> 3:06:04.840]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[3:06:04.840 --> 3:06:07.640]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[3:06:07.640 --> 3:06:10.920]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
[3:06:10.920 --> 3:06:12.680]  and prepare a defense.
[3:06:12.680 --> 3:06:16.840]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching
[3:06:16.840 --> 3:06:19.880]  filled with bombs, they had drums of their own,
[3:06:19.880 --> 3:06:21.240]  air raid sirens.
[3:06:21.240 --> 3:06:25.720]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[3:06:25.720 --> 3:06:28.120]  Pathogens added to the food and water,
[3:06:28.120 --> 3:06:31.320]  and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[3:06:31.320 --> 3:06:35.480]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[3:06:35.480 --> 3:06:38.920]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[3:06:38.920 --> 3:06:44.200]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[3:06:44.200 --> 3:06:46.920]  to create the basic foundation
[3:06:46.920 --> 3:06:50.120]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[3:06:56.040 --> 3:07:25.000]  and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.

[3:07:27.880 --> 3:07:30.520]  containing antibacterial properties that work well
[3:07:30.520 --> 3:07:33.240]  to help tone gums and freshen your breath.
[3:07:33.240 --> 3:07:36.440]  This antiseptic mouthwash is a concentrated formula.
[3:07:36.440 --> 3:07:40.520]  You will need to dilute one part mouthwash to 10 parts water.
[3:07:40.520 --> 3:07:42.920]  Emrex Essentials' mouthwash is a great addition
[3:07:42.920 --> 3:07:45.000]  to your daily brushing routine.
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:48.520]  It is effective, yet gentle enough for the most sensitive gums
[3:07:48.520 --> 3:07:49.960]  and canker sores.
[3:07:49.960 --> 3:07:52.760]  Go organic today with Emrex Essentials.

[3:08:32.120 --> 3:08:33.400]  since she's been gone for over a month
[3:08:33.400 --> 3:08:35.240]  on a sabbatical helping her grandmother.
[3:08:35.240 --> 3:08:36.760]  She just had surgery successfully.
[3:08:37.720 --> 3:08:39.400]  But it's the great part about skypiz.
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:41.080]  Even when I'm out of town,
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:43.080]  I can talk to my son, my daughter's family.
[3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:44.200]  It's like, she's here.
[3:08:44.200 --> 3:08:45.560]  It just makes me happy.
[3:08:45.560 --> 3:08:47.400]  And Paul Watson, who I love as well.
[3:08:47.400 --> 3:08:47.960]  I love Leanne.
[3:08:47.960 --> 3:08:48.920]  I love Paul Watson.
[3:08:48.920 --> 3:08:50.040]  I love this crew in here.
[3:08:50.040 --> 3:08:51.400]  I mean, I just really do.
[3:08:51.400 --> 3:08:53.240]  That the whole crew back there are just awesome folks.
[3:08:53.240 --> 3:08:54.680]  The longer they're here, the more I love them.
[3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:57.960]  You know, Nico and Daria and then CJ and Zach and Matt
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:08:59.240]  and just everybody.
[3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:01.080]  The whole crew, Rob, do everybody.
[3:09:01.080 --> 3:09:02.040]  It's amazing.
[3:09:02.040 --> 3:09:03.000]  And they demonize this.
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:03.800]  They lie about us.
[3:09:03.800 --> 3:09:05.000]  I want to have Paul take over
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:06.680]  because I had to twist his arm to the show.
[3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:09.160]  He's such a dominator of Twitter and everything else
[3:09:09.160 --> 3:09:10.280]  and writing prolific stories.
[3:09:10.280 --> 3:09:13.000]  But I wanted to just have Leanne chime in
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:14.600]  with a quick comment or two and finish up.
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:15.800]  And Paul Watson as well.
[3:09:15.800 --> 3:09:19.480]  But Paul Watson, what do you make of this blowing up
[3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:21.240]  and CNN's face so bad?
[3:09:21.240 --> 3:09:23.320]  I mean, this is intensifying.
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:25.480]  I don't know how long this can go on.
[3:09:25.480 --> 3:09:27.400]  And then the crazy North Korea stuff.
[3:09:27.400 --> 3:09:29.720]  And then the media lying and saying that I said
[3:09:29.720 --> 3:09:32.680]  there's Martian slave colonies of children
[3:09:32.680 --> 3:09:34.200]  when we were talking about, you know,
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:37.000]  the Pope's deputy being indicted
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:38.760]  for mass kidnapping of children.
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:40.360]  I mean, it's just Twilight Zone.
[3:09:40.360 --> 3:09:43.000]  What would you call this period we're in right now, Paul?
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:46.680]  I'd call it the beginning of the great meme war
[3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:48.600]  of summer 2017, Alex.
[3:09:48.600 --> 3:09:51.400]  This CNN thing today is just insane.
[3:09:51.400 --> 3:09:53.720]  You know that it's got them on the ropes, Alex,
[3:09:53.720 --> 3:09:56.440]  because you had Stelty, you had Cuomo,
[3:09:56.440 --> 3:09:59.720]  all the big CNN guys responding to James O'Keeffe
[3:09:59.720 --> 3:10:02.280]  last week during that whole fracar.
[3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:05.400]  Today, they're not responding apart from Cuomo.
[3:10:05.400 --> 3:10:08.520]  None of the other CNN big wigs are saying anything about this.
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:10.920]  They've obviously been ordered to shut up about it.
[3:10:10.920 --> 3:10:13.000]  It is completely embarrassing.
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:14.680]  It's blown up in their face.
[3:10:14.680 --> 3:10:18.200]  The latest is the originator of this Trump meme,
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:22.120]  which CNN tried to out and threatened to out,
[3:10:22.120 --> 3:10:25.560]  basically threatened to blackmail him, threatened to dox him.
[3:10:25.560 --> 3:10:27.960]  He's not even the originator of the meme.
[3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:30.760]  It's actually turned out to be, by the looks of it,
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:33.080]  an anonymous guy in Mexico.
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:36.040]  So even in their complete failure,
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:37.640]  even in this blowing up in their face,
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:39.960]  they've identified the wrong person.
[3:10:39.960 --> 3:10:41.800]  But Paul, that's what I said hours ago.
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:44.360]  I said, my instinct is they made all this up,
[3:10:44.360 --> 3:10:46.120]  identified a numb diplom,
[3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:48.920]  so they could have the person admit they were racist and evil.
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:50.120]  That was just my gut level.
[3:10:50.120 --> 3:10:53.960]  They're such serpents, such liars, such known scumbags.
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:56.280]  It's not speculation when it's known liars,
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:10:57.800]  constantly caught staging,
[3:10:57.800 --> 3:10:59.400]  constantly caught with fake news,
[3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:01.720]  $100 million lawsuits on Scaramucci,
[3:11:01.720 --> 3:11:03.720]  you know, making all this crap up.
[3:11:03.720 --> 3:11:05.320]  That's what I said,
[3:11:05.320 --> 3:11:08.280]  because the whole thing stunk of something they just made up.
[3:11:08.280 --> 3:11:09.480]  What do you think, Watson?
[3:11:10.840 --> 3:11:13.320]  Well, I mean, it doesn't really matter who it is.
[3:11:13.320 --> 3:11:14.840]  They've been caught red-handed.
[3:11:14.840 --> 3:11:18.200]  Of course, they wanted to celebrate it as a great victory.
[3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:21.960]  Like, they had identified this racist anti-Semite homophobe
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:23.640]  who Trump had used his tweet
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:26.280]  so that they had that whole narrative cooking
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:28.120]  completely blown up in their face.
[3:11:28.120 --> 3:11:30.040]  They came out with a statement
[3:11:30.040 --> 3:11:32.840]  after they rightfully got absolutely rinsed,
[3:11:32.840 --> 3:11:35.320]  even by never Trump people,
[3:11:35.320 --> 3:11:38.120]  even by leftist media outlets for this.
[3:11:38.120 --> 3:11:41.240]  They came out with a statement today, Alex, that said, quote,
[3:11:41.240 --> 3:11:44.760]  CNN decided not to publish the name of the Reddit user
[3:11:44.760 --> 3:11:47.000]  out of concern for his safety.
[3:11:48.280 --> 3:11:50.920]  But that kind of contradicts what they said in the article.
[3:11:50.920 --> 3:11:53.000]  In fact, it completely contradicts it.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  When they said, quote,
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:58.360]  CNN reserves the right to publish his identity.
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:01.000]  That is a threat of doxing, by the way.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  Should any of that change?
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:04.520]  What are they talking about when they say,
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:05.960]  should any of that change?
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:07.480]  They're talking about, quote,
[3:12:07.480 --> 3:12:09.480]  his ugly behavior on social media.
[3:12:09.480 --> 3:12:11.560]  That's right. You better be a good boy forever.
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:12.840]  We're watching you.
[3:12:12.840 --> 3:12:14.520]  We're controlling your political speech.
[3:12:14.520 --> 3:12:17.240]  And we'll burn you and make you lose your job.
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:19.640]  If you don't play ball, that's called racketeering.
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:22.840]  That's called extortion. That's called intimidation.
[3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:27.080]  What's the state law in New York has another name, coercion.
[3:12:27.080 --> 3:12:31.320]  I mean, they are involved in serious gangsta activity, Paul.
[3:12:32.280 --> 3:12:34.760]  But it wasn't just coercion against him.
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:36.440]  It was a message to others.
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:37.880]  I mean, let's boil it down.
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:40.840]  He's essentially being threatened and threatened with doxing
[3:12:40.840 --> 3:12:43.640]  because he made fun of CNN.
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:47.320]  CNN has turned what its billion dollar worth of resources
[3:12:47.320 --> 3:12:51.000]  against one anonymous individual for making a meme.
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:53.400]  Do they not understand that people hate seeing
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:54.920]  little people being attacked, Paul?
[3:12:54.920 --> 3:12:57.000]  The cardinal rule here at our office is,
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:58.840]  do your research, have the facts,
[3:12:58.840 --> 3:13:00.840]  try to report with other documentation that,
[3:13:00.840 --> 3:13:02.440]  you know, cooperates, talk to the witnesses,
[3:13:02.440 --> 3:13:04.760]  and never attack little people.
[3:13:05.480 --> 3:13:07.560]  Leigh Ann, let's go to Leigh Ann for a few final comments.
[3:13:07.560 --> 3:13:09.320]  And I'm going to get out of here and let you take over, Paul,
[3:13:09.320 --> 3:13:12.040]  because I can tell you're wound up, the great Paul Watson.
[3:13:12.040 --> 3:13:14.040]  But I do want to ask you one more question before we leave.
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:15.400]  Leigh Ann, your final comments here,
[3:13:15.400 --> 3:13:16.520]  it's always awesome to have you.
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:17.240]  Thank you for joining us.
[3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:19.000]  Well, right.
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:20.760]  And that's what's so important here
[3:13:20.760 --> 3:13:22.120]  that people need to understand is,
[3:13:22.120 --> 3:13:24.680]  they're trying to make the case that it's okay
[3:13:24.680 --> 3:13:27.320]  to dox and attack a private citizen when you're right.
[3:13:27.320 --> 3:13:29.400]  That is the cardinal rule for us at Info Wars.
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:31.160]  We don't go after the little guy.
[3:13:31.160 --> 3:13:33.400]  They're not, it's not, they're not our enemy.
[3:13:33.400 --> 3:13:34.440]  We're not dealing with them.
[3:13:34.440 --> 3:13:37.480]  Now CNN has taken their entire billion dollar empire
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:39.480]  and is targeting private citizens
[3:13:39.480 --> 3:13:41.800]  to send a chilling effect to everyone else
[3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:44.680]  on the internet that might dare post content
[3:13:44.680 --> 3:13:46.280]  that CNN finds questionable.
[3:13:46.840 --> 3:13:50.520]  Paul has reported about this internet ID in depth,
[3:13:50.520 --> 3:13:52.200]  letting people know that this is what's coming,
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:54.600]  this China internet ID policy.
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:13:58.280]  And now CNN is basically trying to get the American people
[3:13:58.280 --> 3:14:01.800]  to go along with setting something up like this,
[3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:05.160]  where we don't, we can do away with anonymity on the internet
[3:14:05.160 --> 3:14:06.520]  if they're racist and bigoted
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:09.480]  and they should have their lives destroyed.
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:12.280]  If the gatekeepers decide that they're posting content
[3:14:12.280 --> 3:14:14.600]  that they don't like, and that is chilling.
[3:14:14.600 --> 3:14:16.840]  Well, Leigh Ann, thank you so much for joining us.
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:18.920]  You've made the best point here today
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:21.240]  and tell folks how they can, I guess for now,
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:23.960]  they just censored the term, as Paul pointed out,
[3:14:23.960 --> 3:14:25.960]  CNN, blackmail off of Twitter,
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:27.240]  how folks follow you on Twitter.
[3:14:28.120 --> 3:14:31.880]  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and also leighannmacadoo.com.
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:33.960]  It's all right there under Leigh Ann Macadoo.
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:35.800]  All right, she's gonna be launching her own show
[3:14:35.800 --> 3:14:37.800]  very, very soon. We're working on whether to do that.
[3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:40.680]  Thank you, Leigh Ann. Thanks, guys. See you soon.
[3:14:40.680 --> 3:14:42.840]  Very exciting. Paul, I'm gonna hand this over to you,
[3:14:42.840 --> 3:14:44.200]  but I always enjoy talking to you.
[3:14:44.200 --> 3:14:45.480]  I always enjoy watching your work.
[3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:47.560]  I'm gonna just ask you this question.
[3:14:47.560 --> 3:14:49.720]  What is your favorite of the compilation of memes
[3:14:49.720 --> 3:14:50.920]  we've put out that we're running
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:53.160]  for TV viewers right now without audio?
[3:14:53.160 --> 3:14:57.400]  I like Trump as the dragon in Mortal Kombat
[3:14:57.400 --> 3:14:59.000]  biting the head off of CNN.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:01.640]  I mean, it's a video game. It's a joke. It's fine.
[3:15:01.640 --> 3:15:03.800]  They're the one that have their listeners
[3:15:03.800 --> 3:15:05.560]  out actually shooting congressmen.
[3:15:05.560 --> 3:15:08.120]  Or is it the Muhammad Ali because he's defensively
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:10.120]  moving out of all their blows?
[3:15:10.120 --> 3:15:11.400]  What's your favorite?
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:14.360]  I like the first one that you mentioned.
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:16.200]  I think the one that was posted about an hour ago.
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:19.320]  There's actually one, just an image
[3:15:19.320 --> 3:15:21.320]  with the tanks from Tiananmen Square
[3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:24.120]  with CNN on the front of them facing up to the guy
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:26.760]  with a Reddit logo, which is, I made that one.
[3:15:26.760 --> 3:15:28.360]  So that's my favorite, but they're all great.
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:28.920]  They've done well.
[3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:31.400]  People are suggesting, yeah, that's the one I made.
[3:15:31.400 --> 3:15:33.160]  People are saying we should have a contest
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:35.160]  for the best CNN meme.
[3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:37.960]  I agree because I only paid out $20,000.
[3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:39.400]  I only paid out the $20,000.
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:40.840]  And I have a great crew.
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:42.760]  Maybe you should manage it because so much comes in
[3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:43.640]  and then we got to pay it out.
[3:15:43.640 --> 3:15:45.000]  You just tell us who to pay, Paul.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:45.800]  Maybe you want to manage it.
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:47.400]  You're so good at juggling 100 things.
[3:15:47.400 --> 3:15:49.160]  I'll give you more work and your brother, Steve,
[3:15:49.160 --> 3:15:49.800]  who works with you.
[3:15:50.440 --> 3:15:53.240]  Yes, I want to pay the other 180 out
[3:15:53.240 --> 3:15:54.760]  on anybody that follows the other rules,
[3:15:54.760 --> 3:15:56.600]  CNN's fake, CNN's terrorist,
[3:15:56.600 --> 3:15:58.520]  which has been picked up in the larger meme.
[3:15:58.520 --> 3:16:00.120]  But yeah, absolutely.
[3:16:00.120 --> 3:16:04.760]  Whoever's got the best meme out of the 180,000 that's left,
[3:16:04.760 --> 3:16:07.000]  whoever does the best meme by next week,
[3:16:07.880 --> 3:16:12.280]  by next Wednesday, that has infowars.com included,
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:15.960]  we'll get $20,000 plus we'll post a lot of the better memes
[3:16:15.960 --> 3:16:18.280]  on infowars.com and on our Twitter and Facebook.
[3:16:18.280 --> 3:16:19.240]  How's that sound, Paul?
[3:16:19.240 --> 3:16:21.720]  Would you like to honcho just that part of it
[3:16:21.720 --> 3:16:23.160]  and then how do folks contact you?
[3:16:23.160 --> 3:16:27.080]  I guess you can get into our email at contest.infowars.com
[3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:29.000]  and will you handle that $20,000 chunk?
[3:16:30.280 --> 3:16:31.240]  Yeah, I can do that.
[3:16:31.240 --> 3:16:33.960]  Of course, it's key to put infowars.com on there
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:35.160]  because there are so many memes,
[3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:37.320]  there's probably 1,000 memes within the past few hours.
[3:16:37.320 --> 3:16:40.280]  It has to have infowars.com on the meme,
[3:16:40.280 --> 3:16:43.240]  so we know that it's an original meme for the contest.
[3:16:43.240 --> 3:16:47.240]  That's right, and you can retool or make a meme documentary.
[3:16:47.240 --> 3:16:51.640]  This is the meme wars of the news wars of the info wars.
[3:16:51.640 --> 3:16:54.280]  Now, Paul Watson, lastly, I'm gonna let you take over here.
[3:16:54.280 --> 3:16:58.520]  What about Macron announcing, I'm gonna be like Jupiter
[3:16:58.520 --> 3:17:02.440]  or that's Zeus in Greek, the God Emperor and will rule,
[3:17:02.440 --> 3:17:05.080]  and I'm gonna forcibly inoculate all children
[3:17:05.080 --> 3:17:06.600]  and we're gonna bring more Muslims in
[3:17:06.600 --> 3:17:07.560]  and we're gonna do whatever we want.
[3:17:08.280 --> 3:17:11.080]  This literally the child sex toy of the elite.
[3:17:11.080 --> 3:17:13.080]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this.
[3:17:13.880 --> 3:17:17.400]  Have you seen the photo of him on the Royal Throne?
[3:17:17.400 --> 3:17:19.880]  We'll try to put that back up on screen for TV viewers.
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:21.880]  I mean, what in Hades is going on here?
[3:17:23.080 --> 3:17:24.760]  Well, he's a sociopath, Alex.
[3:17:24.760 --> 3:17:27.240]  Top psychiatrists have come out and we've written about it
[3:17:27.240 --> 3:17:29.320]  and said, this guy's a sociopath.
[3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:30.760]  He's another elitist.
[3:17:30.760 --> 3:17:32.440]  None of them have had children.
[3:17:32.440 --> 3:17:34.280]  None of them have any empathy.
[3:17:34.280 --> 3:17:38.120]  They think they can rule over as they're completely narcissistic,
[3:17:38.120 --> 3:17:39.720]  especially in his case.
[3:17:39.720 --> 3:17:43.480]  He got with this grandma of a wife simply for power.
[3:17:43.480 --> 3:17:44.600]  He's a sociopath.
[3:17:44.600 --> 3:17:48.760]  That's why he rose to the top, to be successful in politics
[3:17:48.760 --> 3:17:50.760]  with very few exceptions.
[3:17:50.760 --> 3:17:53.240]  You at least have to be an egomaniac
[3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:55.080]  or you have to be a complete sociopath
[3:17:55.080 --> 3:17:55.960]  and that's what he is.
[3:17:55.960 --> 3:17:59.000]  And speaking of that, Nikki Haley just started speaking live
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:01.960]  at the United Nations, the U.S. Ambassador to the UN
[3:18:01.960 --> 3:18:03.720]  on the deepening North Korea crisis.
[3:18:03.720 --> 3:18:06.120]  We're skipping this break, so Paul has more time.
[3:18:06.120 --> 3:18:08.040]  Here is a few minutes of her live announcement.
[3:18:08.040 --> 3:18:08.840]  It is a dark day.
[3:18:09.640 --> 3:18:12.280]  It is a dark day because yesterday's actions
[3:18:12.280 --> 3:18:15.720]  by North Korea made the world a more dangerous place.
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:19.640]  Their illegal missile launch was not only dangerous,
[3:18:19.640 --> 3:18:21.800]  but reckless and irresponsible.
[3:18:22.440 --> 3:18:25.240]  It showed that North Korea does not want to be
[3:18:25.240 --> 3:18:26.440]  part of a peaceful world.
[3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:28.920]  They have cast a dark shadow of conflict
[3:18:28.920 --> 3:18:31.720]  on all nations that strive for peace.
[3:18:33.000 --> 3:18:36.680]  Yesterday's act came from the same vicious dictator
[3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:40.440]  who sent a young college student back home to his parents,
[3:18:40.440 --> 3:18:42.680]  unresponsive and in a coma.
[3:18:43.480 --> 3:18:47.160]  For Americans, the true nature of the North Korean regime
[3:18:47.160 --> 3:18:49.880]  was painfully brought home with the images
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:53.000]  of two guards holding auto-warm beer
[3:18:53.000 --> 3:18:55.640]  up as they transported them from a prison
[3:18:55.640 --> 3:18:57.240]  he should never have been in.
[3:18:57.800 --> 3:19:01.080]  Auto-warm beer is but one person out of millions
[3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:03.880]  who have been killed, tortured, or deprived
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:06.360]  of their human rights by the North Korean regime.
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:10.760]  To Americans, the death of one innocent person
[3:19:10.760 --> 3:19:13.320]  can be as powerful as the death of millions.
[3:19:14.040 --> 3:19:16.920]  Because all men and women are created in God's image,
[3:19:16.920 --> 3:19:20.840]  depravity toward one is a sure sign of willingness
[3:19:20.840 --> 3:19:22.360]  to do much more harm.
[3:19:22.360 --> 3:19:25.080]  The nature of the North Korean regime is clear.
[3:19:25.720 --> 3:19:29.160]  Only the scale of the damage it does could become different.
[3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:32.760]  That's why yesterday's escalation is so alarming.
[3:19:33.240 --> 3:19:36.280]  If North Korea will treat an innocent young student,
[3:19:36.760 --> 3:19:38.760]  the way it treated auto-warm beer,
[3:19:38.760 --> 3:19:42.120]  we should not be surprised if it acts barbarically
[3:19:42.120 --> 3:19:43.480]  on a larger scale.
[3:19:44.520 --> 3:19:46.920]  The United States does not seek conflict.
[3:19:46.920 --> 3:19:49.080]  In fact, we seek to avoid it.
[3:19:49.080 --> 3:19:51.880]  We seek only the peaceful denuclearization
[3:19:51.880 --> 3:19:53.880]  of the Korean Peninsula and an end
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:56.360]  to the threatening actions by North Korea.
[3:19:56.360 --> 3:19:59.800]  Regrettably, we're witnessing just the opposite.
[3:20:00.440 --> 3:20:04.920]  Make no mistake, North Korea's launch of an ICBM
[3:20:04.920 --> 3:20:08.440]  is a clear and sharp military escalation.
[3:20:08.440 --> 3:20:12.440]  The North Korean regime openly states that its missiles
[3:20:12.440 --> 3:20:16.280]  are intended to deliver nuclear weapons to strike cities
[3:20:16.280 --> 3:20:17.640]  in the United States.
[3:20:17.640 --> 3:20:19.400]  South Korea and Japan.
[3:20:19.400 --> 3:20:22.280]  And now it has greater capacity to do so.
[3:20:22.280 --> 3:20:25.400]  In truth, it is not only the United States
[3:20:25.400 --> 3:20:27.400]  and our allies that are threatened.
[3:20:27.400 --> 3:20:30.360]  North Korea's destabilizing escalation
[3:20:30.360 --> 3:20:31.560]  is a threat to all of us.
[3:20:31.560 --> 3:20:32.760]  She's going to call for sanctions.
[3:20:32.760 --> 3:20:34.120]  He's definitely rogue now.
[3:20:34.120 --> 3:20:37.560]  They're acting perfectly closing off the possibility.
[3:20:37.560 --> 3:20:40.040]  Lucy, Russia, for the first time, start threatening him back.
[3:20:40.040 --> 3:20:42.840]  The United States is prepared to use the full range
[3:20:42.840 --> 3:20:45.640]  of our capabilities to defend ourselves
[3:20:45.640 --> 3:20:47.640]  and our allies.
[3:20:47.640 --> 3:20:50.360]  One of our capabilities lies with our considerable
[3:20:50.360 --> 3:20:51.960]  military forces.
[3:20:51.960 --> 3:20:53.960]  We will use them if we must.
[3:20:53.960 --> 3:20:57.160]  But we prefer not to have to go in that direction.
[3:20:57.160 --> 3:21:00.920]  We have other methods of addressing those who threaten us
[3:21:00.920 --> 3:21:04.360]  and of addressing those who supply the threats.
[3:21:04.360 --> 3:21:07.720]  We have great capabilities in the area of trade.
[3:21:07.720 --> 3:21:09.720]  President Trump has spoken repeatedly.
[3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:10.120]  They don't care.
[3:21:10.120 --> 3:21:11.320]  They just starve our people to death.
[3:21:11.320 --> 3:21:13.320]  I spoke with him at length about it this morning.
[3:21:13.320 --> 3:21:16.600]  There are countries that are allowing, even encouraging,
[3:21:16.600 --> 3:21:18.600]  trade with North Korea in violation.
[3:21:18.600 --> 3:21:19.080]  That's enough.
[3:21:19.080 --> 3:21:20.600]  Paul can cover it once the statement's done.
[3:21:20.600 --> 3:21:22.120]  We know what's coming out of this.
[3:21:22.120 --> 3:21:25.800]  The issue is, Trump has said the order of strategic patience
[3:21:25.800 --> 3:21:26.280]  is over.
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:28.600]  The Clintons gave him the reactors, the missiles.
[3:21:28.600 --> 3:21:30.040]  Why did the elites do this?
[3:21:30.040 --> 3:21:31.880]  Where does Paul Watson think this is going?
[3:21:31.880 --> 3:21:32.760]  Paul, take over.
[3:21:32.760 --> 3:21:33.560]  Great job.
[3:21:33.560 --> 3:21:34.600]  Paul, love prison planet.
[3:21:34.600 --> 3:21:36.040]  Go ahead.
[3:21:36.040 --> 3:21:37.080]  OK, thanks, Alex.
[3:21:37.080 --> 3:21:40.040]  Yeah, an interesting sidebar on that was a poll
[3:21:40.040 --> 3:21:42.040]  that I think is going to come out of this.
[3:21:42.040 --> 3:21:45.400]  An interesting sidebar on that was a poll that I ran yesterday.
[3:21:45.400 --> 3:21:48.280]  And it's very different from the Syria situation with North
[3:21:48.280 --> 3:21:48.920]  Korea, of course.
[3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:52.040]  Nikki Haley is absolutely dreadful on Syria.
[3:21:52.040 --> 3:21:55.560]  Last week she was talking about, if there's any chemical weapons
[3:21:55.560 --> 3:21:57.080]  attack, we will blame it on a side,
[3:21:57.080 --> 3:21:59.240]  even though the evidence for the previous one
[3:21:59.240 --> 3:22:01.160]  was dodgy to say the least.
[3:22:01.160 --> 3:22:02.920]  She's terrible on Syria.
[3:22:02.920 --> 3:22:04.840]  It was good of her to mention Otto Warmbier.
[3:22:04.840 --> 3:22:06.200]  Remember, he was made fun of.
[3:22:06.200 --> 3:22:09.560]  He was mocked after he died and before he died
[3:22:09.560 --> 3:22:12.280]  by leftists saying his white privilege
[3:22:12.280 --> 3:22:15.800]  was what got him in that horrible situation as a prisoner
[3:22:15.800 --> 3:22:16.760]  in North Korea.
[3:22:16.760 --> 3:22:19.880]  But the poll I ran, if Trump launched a military strike
[3:22:19.880 --> 3:22:22.040]  on North Korea, would you support it?
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:25.480]  Now, if you're talking about Syria, that was 50% or less
[3:22:25.480 --> 3:22:26.680]  would support it.
[3:22:26.680 --> 3:22:29.840]  In the case of North Korea, 65% said yes.
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:33.080]  And 29,000 people voted, by the way,
[3:22:33.080 --> 3:22:35.720]  almost all of whom are going to be Trump supporters.
[3:22:35.720 --> 3:22:38.160]  So that is a large sample.
[3:22:38.160 --> 3:22:39.520]  65% said yes.
[3:22:39.520 --> 3:22:41.920]  They would support military strike on North Korea.
[3:22:41.920 --> 3:22:43.520]  35% said no.
[3:22:43.520 --> 3:22:47.880]  So there is more support for a strike on North Korea than Syria.
[3:22:47.880 --> 3:22:51.320]  So it would be less controversial amongst Trump's base,
[3:22:51.320 --> 3:22:54.600]  which we know was a huge issue last time around
[3:22:54.600 --> 3:22:57.320]  with the entanglement with Syria back in April.
[3:22:57.320 --> 3:22:59.920]  So we'll continue to watch that and developments
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:01.600]  with North Korea.
[3:23:01.600 --> 3:23:05.560]  Going back to CNN, of course, the whole issue with this
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:11.080]  is that CNN used its resources as a huge news organization,
[3:23:11.080 --> 3:23:13.480]  a more popular news organization, especially
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:16.120]  since the election, their ratings have gone up,
[3:23:16.120 --> 3:23:18.680]  although they've gone down 20% in June.
[3:23:18.680 --> 3:23:21.720]  But they used the mechanism of their resources
[3:23:21.720 --> 3:23:25.000]  not to go after ISIS hate preachers who
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:27.640]  spread propaganda on the internet, who radicalized
[3:23:27.640 --> 3:23:31.640]  actual terrorists, who celebrate terrorist attacks,
[3:23:31.640 --> 3:23:36.200]  not to go after members of Antifa who physically violently
[3:23:36.200 --> 3:23:38.840]  attack Trump supporters on a regular basis
[3:23:38.840 --> 3:23:41.720]  while wearing masks to hide their identity.
[3:23:41.720 --> 3:23:43.720]  And shoot random cops in the back of the head
[3:23:43.720 --> 3:23:45.520]  two more this week.
[3:23:45.520 --> 3:23:46.560]  Exactly, Alex.
[3:23:46.560 --> 3:23:47.640]  And I'm going to get to that.
[3:23:47.640 --> 3:23:49.080]  That was politically motivated.
[3:23:49.080 --> 3:23:51.960]  I actually found his Facebook page before anyone else.
[3:23:51.960 --> 3:23:53.520]  And it was as you would expect.
[3:23:53.520 --> 3:23:54.840]  So I'm going to get onto that.
[3:23:54.840 --> 3:23:56.680]  But they don't use their vast resources
[3:23:56.680 --> 3:23:57.720]  to go after these people.
[3:23:57.720 --> 3:24:02.800]  You had a professor wearing a mask, he was unidentified,
[3:24:02.800 --> 3:24:05.880]  smashed a Trump supporter on the head with a bike lock.
[3:24:05.880 --> 3:24:11.000]  He went unidentified until 4chan did the law enforcement
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:12.080]  job for them.
[3:24:12.080 --> 3:24:13.440]  He was identified.
[3:24:13.440 --> 3:24:16.800]  CNN has never been interested in identifying
[3:24:16.800 --> 3:24:18.000]  any of those people.
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:23.800]  As soon as one guy on Reddit makes a joke meme targeting CNN,
[3:24:23.800 --> 3:24:26.000]  they go after him with the full force.
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:28.640]  And they claim like they have the moral high ground.
[3:24:28.640 --> 3:24:30.160]  That's what really gets me.
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:33.040]  Every time they claim they have the moral high ground,
[3:24:33.040 --> 3:24:37.680]  they threaten to dox him to reveal his identity.
[3:24:37.680 --> 3:24:40.600]  They say, oh, he apologized.
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:41.920]  Look at the tweet.
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:45.800]  Kaczynski, Andrew Kaczynski, he did the story for CNN,
[3:24:45.800 --> 3:24:48.800]  threatening to identify this individual.
[3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:51.600]  His original tweet said that this individual who
[3:24:51.600 --> 3:24:55.120]  created the Trump WWE meme, or at least they said he did,
[3:24:55.120 --> 3:24:59.160]  turns out that's not even true, quote, came out after CNN
[3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:01.640]  identified and reached out to him.
[3:25:01.640 --> 3:25:04.800]  So that's saying he apologized after CNN
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:09.160]  identified him and threatened to reveal his identity.
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:12.600]  As soon as that was pointed out to CNN's Andrew Kaczynski,
[3:25:12.600 --> 3:25:15.120]  he suddenly changed his statement all together
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:18.240]  and said that the individual responsible for the tweet
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:21.800]  had already apologized before CNN contacted him.
[3:25:21.800 --> 3:25:23.200]  So again, completely completely.
[3:25:23.200 --> 3:25:25.320]  When I'm deploying, my instinct tells me the whole thing's
[3:25:25.320 --> 3:25:25.840]  fake.
[3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:27.640]  They thought they couldn't find out who it was.
[3:25:27.640 --> 3:25:29.720]  They just made it up.
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:33.120]  Don't forget, Alex, that this Kaczynski guy is kind of funny
[3:25:33.120 --> 3:25:34.760]  because he's one of the originators
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:36.600]  of Twitter outrage culture.
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:40.920]  He destroyed Justine Sacco, completely destroyed her life.
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:43.720]  This was the woman who went on a holiday to South Africa,
[3:25:43.720 --> 3:25:45.320]  made a joke about getting AIDS.
[3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:47.400]  She wouldn't get AIDS because she was white.
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:25:48.920]  She had white privilege.
[3:25:48.920 --> 3:25:50.880]  She was actually a leftist.
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:52.440]  It was actually an anti-racist.
[3:25:52.440 --> 3:25:54.720]  Or excuse me, anti-white.
[3:25:54.720 --> 3:25:56.920]  Yeah, but he completely destroyed her life.
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:26:00.040]  Her life was ruined as a result of this mob outrage, which
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:00.760]  was originated.
[3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:03.400]  And that's why CNN has hired him to teach them
[3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:04.560]  how to be better bullies.
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:06.240]  And they were very, very excited.
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:09.240]  What's Humpty Dumpty's name?
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:10.880]  The little pegged tooth guy that looks
[3:26:10.880 --> 3:26:13.600]  like he has a neurological disorder.
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:17.360]  I'm sad for him, the CNN host.
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:20.640]  Humpty Dumpty looks just like he's licking his lips
[3:26:20.640 --> 3:26:23.920]  when he talks about going after people.
[3:26:23.920 --> 3:26:25.360]  No, I mean, that's exactly it.
[3:26:25.360 --> 3:26:26.120]  It's the relish.
[3:26:26.120 --> 3:26:28.280]  And in fact, they were laughing about it on New Day
[3:26:28.280 --> 3:26:30.440]  with Chris Cuomo earlier today.
[3:26:30.440 --> 3:26:31.800]  And we're going to play the clip.
[3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:33.040]  They were salivating.
[3:26:33.040 --> 3:26:34.840]  They were saying, oh, it's so remarkable
[3:26:34.840 --> 3:26:36.640]  that we were able to identify.
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:38.160]  Oh, so powerful.
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:41.080]  Yeah, so we were able to bully our gnome diploma.
[3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:42.800]  We were able to bully our gnome diploma.
[3:26:42.800 --> 3:26:45.640]  It was completely blowing up in their face at the same time.
[3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:50.240]  But Chris Cuomo on CNN said that he should be identified,
[3:26:50.240 --> 3:26:51.760]  or at least he tweeted.
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:26:53.920]  He later deleted the tweet asking,
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:56.560]  should CNN reveal the name of the Reddit user who
[3:26:56.560 --> 3:26:58.160]  made Trump's wrestling video?
[3:26:58.160 --> 3:27:01.720]  Had a lot of bigoted and hateful material on page and website.
[3:27:01.720 --> 3:27:05.440]  So that's CNN literally acting as thought police.
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:08.880]  If you've posted anything dodgy on the internet in the past,
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:11.520]  they're coming after you, because they're the new thought
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:11.920]  police.
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:14.160]  They're the new arbiters of absolute truth.
[3:27:14.160 --> 3:27:16.120]  That is sinister.
[3:27:16.120 --> 3:27:18.040]  But is it this meme storm, Paul?
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:19.360]  There's no reason to do that.
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:20.360]  I can't help it.
[3:27:20.360 --> 3:27:21.640]  I'm sitting there watching and having to jump in.
[3:27:21.640 --> 3:27:22.160]  It's a crap.
[3:27:22.160 --> 3:27:23.040]  I don't TV radio show.
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:25.800]  I'm taking it over my amazing host.
[3:27:25.800 --> 3:27:28.400]  I'm asking you, bigger than a tweet storm or a meme storm
[3:27:28.400 --> 3:27:30.320]  or a meme war, is it this really hurting them?
[3:27:30.320 --> 3:27:31.320]  And then I'm out of here.
[3:27:31.320 --> 3:27:33.920]  I'm getting out of the chair.
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:35.960]  Well, it's hurt them since June, of course.
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:38.240]  They had a huge rating spike during the election,
[3:27:38.240 --> 3:27:39.800]  because they were feeding off Trump.
[3:27:39.800 --> 3:27:42.760]  We had the old Keith tapes where they admit the producer admits,
[3:27:42.760 --> 3:27:43.800]  yeah, it's all for ratings.
[3:27:43.800 --> 3:27:45.720]  The Trump-Russia collusions all crap.
[3:27:45.720 --> 3:27:48.000]  Oh, by the way, there's a new story, Alex, about them
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:51.440]  investigating far-right websites linked with Russia.
[3:27:51.440 --> 3:27:55.040]  That's how we know, for sure, the Trump-Russia collusion
[3:27:55.040 --> 3:27:58.240]  story is absolute crap, because we've never
[3:27:58.240 --> 3:28:01.000]  had any kind of contact with any Russian government
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:02.320]  source whatsoever.
[3:28:02.320 --> 3:28:04.600]  But that's bubbling up to the surface again.
[3:28:04.600 --> 3:28:08.240]  But it's, I mean, in the microcosm of Twitter,
[3:28:08.240 --> 3:28:09.920]  and this is what we have to remember,
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:14.440]  the vast majority of dumb leftists and CNN loyalists
[3:28:14.440 --> 3:28:16.280]  will not even find out about this.
[3:28:16.280 --> 3:28:18.840]  CNN's not talking about it on their front page.
[3:28:18.840 --> 3:28:21.960]  So it's whether it can break outside the relatively small
[3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:23.800]  echo chamber of Twitter, where it's
[3:28:23.800 --> 3:28:26.960]  been trending for almost, what, 24 hours now
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:28.600]  until they took it down, when they took it out
[3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:29.720]  in the trending list.
[3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:31.440]  Can it break out of that?
[3:28:31.440 --> 3:28:34.560]  Will it get more attention from the rest of the media?
[3:28:34.560 --> 3:28:35.960]  That remains to be seen.
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:38.960]  Certainly, if it turns out that this guy they identified,
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:43.520]  this poor individual, is not even the originator of the tweet,
[3:28:43.520 --> 3:28:46.520]  that is going to increase the embarrassment.
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:50.280]  But it's the very notion of CNN saying,
[3:28:50.280 --> 3:28:54.160]  this user posted bigoted and racist memes in the past.
[3:28:54.160 --> 3:28:55.880]  Should we identify him?
[3:28:55.880 --> 3:28:57.000]  Should we dox him?
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:28:59.000]  Should we reveal his identity?
[3:28:59.000 --> 3:29:00.880]  That is completely sinister.
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:02.040]  They were caught.
[3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:05.240]  They came out with this ridiculous PR statement saying,
[3:29:05.240 --> 3:29:08.280]  CNN decided not to publish the name of the Reddit user out
[3:29:08.280 --> 3:29:10.600]  of concern for his safety.
[3:29:10.600 --> 3:29:15.080]  Completely contradicting the threat, the implicit threat
[3:29:15.080 --> 3:29:17.720]  that if he changed his behavior back
[3:29:17.720 --> 3:29:22.000]  to his bad old ways of posting anti-CNN memes,
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:25.600]  they reserved the ride to reveal his identity.
[3:29:25.600 --> 3:29:27.920]  Completely contradicted themselves.
[3:29:27.920 --> 3:29:31.080]  Again, the writer Kaczynski said originally
[3:29:31.080 --> 3:29:34.880]  that this meme creator only came out after CNN
[3:29:34.880 --> 3:29:35.680]  reached out to him.
[3:29:35.680 --> 3:29:36.840]  His apology was after that.
[3:29:36.840 --> 3:29:39.000]  He then had to backtrack that.
[3:29:39.000 --> 3:29:41.400]  This is the guy who's destroyed people's lives
[3:29:41.400 --> 3:29:44.840]  in the past with ginned-up outrage on Twitter.
[3:29:44.840 --> 3:29:47.040]  He's an expert at that, kind of blowing back
[3:29:47.040 --> 3:29:49.200]  in his face today, which is interesting.
[3:29:49.200 --> 3:29:50.800]  But again, this is completely sinister.
[3:29:50.800 --> 3:29:53.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:53.000 --> 3:29:55.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:00.640 --> 3:30:02.880]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats
[3:30:02.880 --> 3:30:04.080]  into a tizzy again.
[3:30:04.080 --> 3:30:07.360]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and no IQ Mika
[3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:09.760]  last week, Trump got back on Twitter yesterday
[3:30:09.760 --> 3:30:12.880]  and posted a short video of himself beating up another man
[3:30:12.880 --> 3:30:16.000]  depicted as a CNN logo, a total classic.
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:18.360]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity
[3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:20.720]  towards the fake news network CNN and are now
[3:30:20.720 --> 3:30:22.560]  drumming up the bill for impeachment based
[3:30:22.560 --> 3:30:24.480]  on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds
[3:30:24.480 --> 3:30:26.800]  that the president is mentally unfit to serve.
[3:30:26.800 --> 3:30:29.320]  Now, this would require a medical examination,
[3:30:29.320 --> 3:30:31.600]  which may come back to bite the Democrats that
[3:30:31.600 --> 3:30:32.480]  are calling for it.
[3:30:32.480 --> 3:30:35.680]  You see, given a fair examination of the president's health,
[3:30:35.680 --> 3:30:37.560]  Trump will pass with flying colors.
[3:30:37.560 --> 3:30:40.560]  But imagine if the tables were turned, and Nancy Pelosi,
[3:30:40.560 --> 3:30:43.400]  Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren,
[3:30:43.400 --> 3:30:46.440]  and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test,
[3:30:46.440 --> 3:30:48.280]  given the importance of their jobs.
[3:30:48.280 --> 3:30:50.720]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[3:30:50.720 --> 3:30:52.560]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[3:30:52.560 --> 3:30:55.280]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[3:30:59.840 --> 3:31:02.400]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread

[3:31:04.600 --> 3:31:08.280]  I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee
[3:31:08.280 --> 3:31:08.960]  on the planet.
[3:31:08.960 --> 3:31:11.280]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee
[3:31:11.280 --> 3:31:13.680]  has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[3:31:13.680 --> 3:31:16.360]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown
[3:31:16.360 --> 3:31:17.360]  Arabica beans.
[3:31:17.360 --> 3:31:20.400]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans
[3:31:20.400 --> 3:31:22.240]  in a highly customized blend.
[3:31:22.240 --> 3:31:26.880]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic
[3:31:26.880 --> 3:31:29.040]  coffee at Infowarslife.com.

[3:31:35.400 --> 3:31:36.240]  give me personally.
[3:31:36.240 --> 3:31:38.120]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee,
[3:31:38.120 --> 3:31:41.440]  and it's taken us years to secure connections directly
[3:31:41.440 --> 3:31:43.240]  to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[3:31:43.240 --> 3:31:45.800]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two,
[3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:47.720]  and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[3:31:53.000 --> 3:31:55.680]  all the while enjoying a truly great tasting
[3:31:55.680 --> 3:31:57.400]  cup of my favorite coffee.
[3:31:57.400 --> 3:31:59.920]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[3:31:59.920 --> 3:32:02.320]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[3:32:02.320 --> 3:32:05.560]  and put it together with our own four years of seeking
[3:32:05.560 --> 3:32:08.560]  and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us
[3:32:08.560 --> 3:32:10.520]  through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[3:32:10.520 --> 3:32:12.560]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield,
[3:32:12.560 --> 3:32:15.440]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:32:15.440 --> 3:32:16.840]  It's made in the USA.
[3:32:16.840 --> 3:32:19.640]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[3:32:19.640 --> 3:32:22.440]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body,
[3:32:22.440 --> 3:32:23.720]  and it supports the Infowar.
[3:32:23.720 --> 3:32:25.800]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:32:25.800 --> 3:32:28.080]  This is the formula that I personally
[3:32:28.080 --> 3:32:29.520]  have been taking for over a year,
[3:32:29.520 --> 3:32:32.680]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[3:32:32.680 --> 3:32:35.560]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[3:32:35.560 --> 3:32:37.520]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[3:32:37.520 --> 3:32:40.440]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[3:32:40.440 --> 3:32:43.120]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[3:32:43.120 --> 3:32:45.080]  and as focused as you can be,
[3:32:45.080 --> 3:32:48.000]  because we need you, the remnant of America,
[3:32:48.000 --> 3:32:50.360]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[3:32:50.360 --> 3:32:52.360]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[3:32:52.360 --> 3:32:54.600]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[3:32:54.600 --> 3:32:55.640]  we're changing the world.
[3:32:55.640 --> 3:32:57.240]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[3:32:57.240 --> 3:32:59.600]  with ZShieldInFowarsLife.com.

[3:33:19.520 --> 3:33:21.640]  We're gonna talk about the guy,
[3:33:21.640 --> 3:33:23.720]  the unprovoked attack in New York,
[3:33:23.720 --> 3:33:27.200]  absolutely horrific attack on a mother of three.
[3:33:27.200 --> 3:33:28.960]  Was it politically motivated?
[3:33:28.960 --> 3:33:30.360]  Well, we've been digging into that.
[3:33:30.360 --> 3:33:33.640]  We will get into that story in a little while.
[3:33:33.640 --> 3:33:35.560]  First, with CNN on the ropes,
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:38.240]  Infowars continues to rise, continues to thrive,

[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:05.880]  Of course, I take it before hosting the show.
[3:34:05.880 --> 3:34:07.840]  Gives you mental clarity.
[3:34:07.840 --> 3:34:09.960]  Gives you that little bit of a kick you need
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:13.880]  without the junk side effect that you get from caffeine.
[3:34:13.880 --> 3:34:17.520]  It's loaded with natural compounds like Yerba Marta,
[3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:20.440]  L-Theanine, Alpha, GPC, and many others
[3:34:20.440 --> 3:34:22.120]  that are known to support cognitive health
[3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:24.000]  and give you a major boost.
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:27.280]  This is what all the WizKids out of Silicon Valley are on.
[3:34:27.280 --> 3:34:29.680]  It is the new frontier, new tropics,
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:33.360]  and this is our special blended product, Brainforce Plus.
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:36.120]  It's available at infowarslife.com.
[3:34:36.120 --> 3:34:41.120]  The 30% off as part of the 4th of July summer mega special.
[3:34:42.040 --> 3:34:43.840]  We also have 30 to 40% off
[3:34:43.840 --> 3:34:46.200]  on Infowars Select storeable food
[3:34:46.200 --> 3:34:51.200]  for a limited time, only shelf life of 25 years.
[3:34:51.200 --> 3:34:54.120]  Given what's going on with North Korean right now,
[3:34:54.120 --> 3:34:57.520]  developing ICBMs that could potentially,
[3:34:57.520 --> 3:35:00.480]  within a couple of years hit mainland United States,
[3:35:00.480 --> 3:35:03.160]  maybe it's a good idea just to have that
[3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:04.600]  as an insurance policy.
[3:35:04.600 --> 3:35:05.800]  Of course, if nothing happens,
[3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:10.240]  you can always eat the food and save money anyway.
[3:35:10.240 --> 3:35:12.720]  I mean, you don't appreciate how really affordable that is
[3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:15.840]  until you try and buy storeable food in Europe,
[3:35:15.840 --> 3:35:17.840]  where it's basically cost double what it does
[3:35:17.840 --> 3:35:20.200]  if you were to just get it in the supermarket.
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:23.640]  Massive savings, Infowars Select storeable food,
[3:35:23.640 --> 3:35:28.080]  30 to 40% off right now at infowarsstore.com,
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:30.480]  stock up today.
[3:35:31.600 --> 3:35:33.240]  I'm gonna read some tweets
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:36.040]  in reaction to this CNN blackmail story,
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:37.920]  which is still absolutely huge,
[3:35:37.920 --> 3:35:42.160]  even though it's been removed from Twitter's trending list,
[3:35:42.160 --> 3:35:43.720]  unorganically, I might add,
[3:35:43.720 --> 3:35:46.240]  because everybody's still freaking out about it.
[3:35:46.240 --> 3:35:48.040]  This is what some prominent individuals
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:49.400]  had to say about it today,
[3:35:49.400 --> 3:35:52.680]  and this really sums up the nature of this scandal.
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:35:54.520]  Governor Mike Huckabee said,
[3:35:54.520 --> 3:35:57.040]  CNN, the Corleone News Network,
[3:35:57.040 --> 3:35:59.400]  make fun of them with a humorous gif,
[3:35:59.400 --> 3:36:03.800]  and they threaten you on 4th of July, no less.
[3:36:03.800 --> 3:36:06.360]  That is exactly what we have here.
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:09.080]  It's a mafia style situation.
[3:36:09.080 --> 3:36:13.040]  You keep quiet, don't make any more anti-CNN memes
[3:36:13.040 --> 3:36:15.360]  or something bad might happen to you.
[3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:18.920]  Classic mafia tactics.
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:19.920]  Simple said, quote,
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:23.040]  people posting offensive memes are not newsworthy.
[3:36:23.040 --> 3:36:26.720]  CNN only cared about this guy because of the Trump gif.
[3:36:26.720 --> 3:36:31.560]  They're using racism as an excuse, and that is key,
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:33.440]  because this story was introduced off the back of,
[3:36:33.440 --> 3:36:35.720]  oh, look at this horrible guy lurking
[3:36:35.720 --> 3:36:39.360]  in the dark corners of the internet, posting racist memes.
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:42.720]  So again, they set themselves up
[3:36:42.720 --> 3:36:44.360]  as having the moral high ground.
[3:36:44.360 --> 3:36:46.920]  No, you can disagree with this and say,
[3:36:46.920 --> 3:36:49.000]  this is sinister, this is chilling,
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:52.240]  without having to agree with all the political beliefs
[3:36:52.240 --> 3:36:54.600]  of the person being targeted for it,
[3:36:54.600 --> 3:36:57.000]  which is the point that Glenn Greenwald made.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:58.400]  So no, you're not gonna get out of this
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:37:00.960]  by saying, oh, yeah, but he's racist.
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:01.800]  Doesn't matter.
[3:37:01.800 --> 3:37:04.280]  You can't just strip people's anonymity away
[3:37:04.280 --> 3:37:07.120]  because you don't like what they post on the internet.
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:09.520]  And no, that's not newsworthy, CNN.
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:11.880]  It's obviously agenda-driven,
[3:37:11.880 --> 3:37:14.960]  but hurt because Trump tweeted this out.
[3:37:14.960 --> 3:37:17.560]  You're not a news organization anymore.
[3:37:17.560 --> 3:37:19.560]  You're a far-left activist group
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:24.040]  with far-left activist reporters like Jim Acosta,
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:27.360]  Brian Stelter, and Chris Cuomo.
[3:37:27.360 --> 3:37:30.200]  Oh, yeah, Brian Stelter's got nothing to say about it.
[3:37:30.200 --> 3:37:34.120]  Go on his Twitter today, absolutely zero
[3:37:34.120 --> 3:37:35.920]  to say about the CNN scandal.
[3:37:35.920 --> 3:37:38.400]  Had a lot to say about the James O'Keefe scandal.
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:41.120]  He had a lot to say about info wars last week,
[3:37:41.120 --> 3:37:44.840]  blaming us for the fact that people hate CNN.
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:47.520]  No, Brian, people hate CNN
[3:37:47.520 --> 3:37:50.880]  because you lie relentlessly all the time
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:55.160]  because you try and dox and out people for posting memes.
[3:37:55.160 --> 3:37:57.840]  That's why people hate CNN, okay?
[3:37:57.840 --> 3:37:59.920]  Not info wars fault.
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:03.000]  Continuing Omri Seren tweeted,
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:06.040]  CNN reporters now going after anonymity.
[3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:08.320]  CNN has relied on anonymous sources
[3:38:08.320 --> 3:38:11.280]  for dozens of nonsense Trump Russia stories,
[3:38:11.280 --> 3:38:14.360]  including retracted stories.
[3:38:14.360 --> 3:38:16.560]  So again, CNN's all for anonymity
[3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:18.480]  when they're using it to berate Trump
[3:38:18.480 --> 3:38:21.480]  with baseless crap about Russian collusion.
[3:38:21.480 --> 3:38:24.800]  But as soon as somebody makes fun of CNN with a meme,
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:26.680]  no, we have to out them.
[3:38:26.680 --> 3:38:27.960]  Absolutely insane.
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:31.320]  Donald Trump Jr. tweeted today,
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:34.240]  if only CNN spent as much time tracking down info
[3:38:34.240 --> 3:38:36.760]  on IRS targeting fast and furious,
[3:38:36.760 --> 3:38:41.000]  Iran deal, et cetera, as they did a meme writer.
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:42.760]  Yeah, noticeably less stringent,
[3:38:42.760 --> 3:38:45.720]  noticeably less aggressive in going after those people,
[3:38:45.720 --> 3:38:46.880]  aren't they?
[3:38:46.880 --> 3:38:49.400]  David Burge tweeted this,
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:52.880]  third rate Reddit parody GIF equals equivalent
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:55.880]  of a death threat hunting down and threatening to docs
[3:38:55.880 --> 3:38:59.640]  than nobody who made it equals good journalism.
[3:38:59.640 --> 3:39:01.160]  And again, that gets to the heart of it.
[3:39:01.160 --> 3:39:04.600]  They freaked out beyond anything imaginable
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:08.120]  when Trump tweeted out the wrestling meme a few days ago.
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:12.120]  This guy is completely harassed.
[3:39:12.120 --> 3:39:13.680]  Actually, he's on Twitter.
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:16.200]  I invited him on the show, whether it's him or not,
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:17.880]  people are saying it's him,
[3:39:17.880 --> 3:39:20.120]  this individual who CNN threatened to out,
[3:39:20.120 --> 3:39:22.440]  he's on Twitter and he's saying thanks
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:24.000]  for all the support guys.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:26.960]  So again, if this guy was really apologetic
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:29.840]  with this statement that supposedly came organically
[3:39:29.840 --> 3:39:32.600]  with no pressure whatsoever from CNN,
[3:39:32.600 --> 3:39:35.120]  by the way, the memes on that are hilarious.
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:39.160]  Otto Warmbier in a North Korean prison,
[3:39:39.160 --> 3:39:41.080]  apologizing for everything he's done,
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:43.000]  that's what they're comparing it to.
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:45.200]  But again, if he was so apologetic
[3:39:45.200 --> 3:39:47.240]  and if it was all after CNN
[3:39:47.240 --> 3:39:49.800]  or before CNN even contacted him,
[3:39:49.800 --> 3:39:51.200]  then why is he now on Twitter
[3:39:51.200 --> 3:39:54.680]  saying thanking us for the support?
[3:39:54.680 --> 3:39:56.200]  I think there's a side to the story
[3:39:56.200 --> 3:39:57.880]  not being told there, isn't there?
[3:39:59.200 --> 3:40:00.680]  Chris Barron tweeted,
[3:40:00.680 --> 3:40:02.680]  so it's bullying for Trump to respond
[3:40:02.680 --> 3:40:04.920]  to attacks by millionaire TV star,
[3:40:04.920 --> 3:40:09.920]  but journalism for CNN to blackmail a guy who made a GIF.
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:13.720]  One rule for them, another rule for everybody else.
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:17.800]  Bottom line, CNN essentially blackmailed a private citizen
[3:40:17.800 --> 3:40:19.840]  because he made fun of CNN.
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:21.480]  Let that sink in.
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:23.600]  Oh, but he's racist,
[3:40:23.600 --> 3:40:25.360]  so he can just strip his rights away
[3:40:25.360 --> 3:40:26.640]  and reveal his identity.
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:28.440]  No, it doesn't work like that.
[3:40:28.440 --> 3:40:30.720]  It does not work like that.
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:33.000]  People are asking, should CNN have their
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:35.200]  White House press credentials removed
[3:40:35.200 --> 3:40:39.200]  for harassing, threatening to dox a private citizen?
[3:40:39.200 --> 3:40:42.080]  What other news organization can get away with that
[3:40:42.080 --> 3:40:45.200]  and still have White House press access?
[3:40:45.200 --> 3:40:48.400]  I think it's a very pertinent question to ask.
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:50.800]  Then we've got another angle to it,
[3:40:50.800 --> 3:40:54.760]  which is this whole idea that the public would freak out
[3:40:54.760 --> 3:40:59.160]  and act out violently on a joke Trump tweet
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:03.600]  about WWE, which is a sports entertainment company
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:06.120]  that isn't real, by the way.
[3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:08.160]  By the way, CNN, wrestling's not real.
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:09.760]  It's not real violence.
[3:41:10.640 --> 3:41:11.800]  So there's this whole narrative.
[3:41:11.800 --> 3:41:13.720]  Will the American public just freak out
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:16.400]  and start violently attacking reporters
[3:41:16.400 --> 3:41:18.880]  because of a joke Trump meme?
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:21.160]  Again, that bigotry of low expectations,
[3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:23.400]  treating Americans like animals
[3:41:23.400 --> 3:41:27.520]  who just react violently to any kind of stimulus whatsoever.
[3:41:27.520 --> 3:41:29.960]  Like when they used to say video games caused violence
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:32.960]  with no evidence whatsoever that that was true.
[3:41:32.960 --> 3:41:33.920]  They're doing it once again.
[3:41:33.920 --> 3:41:35.840]  This is out of spite.
[3:41:35.840 --> 3:41:37.040]  I'll read a passage from it
[3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:39.120]  because it's very interesting.
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:41.960]  If it was daft and unpresidential of Trump
[3:41:41.960 --> 3:41:43.480]  to tweet that meme,
[3:41:43.480 --> 3:41:45.640]  the mainstream media's reaction to his tweet
[3:41:45.640 --> 3:41:47.720]  has been positively unhinged.
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:49.800]  The suggestion that a jokey video
[3:41:49.800 --> 3:41:52.560]  showing Trump wrestling a CNN logo head
[3:41:52.560 --> 3:41:55.800]  could incite real world violence against journalists
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:41:58.920]  is just the classic old censorship argument.
[3:41:58.920 --> 3:42:00.760]  The public is gullible and stupid.
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:03.600]  And if they see this image, slash read this book,
[3:42:03.600 --> 3:42:07.360]  slash hear this song, they will go out and beat someone up.
[3:42:08.360 --> 3:42:10.520]  That elitist prejudice lurks behind
[3:42:10.520 --> 3:42:14.680]  pretty much every attempt in history to control speech.
[3:42:14.680 --> 3:42:16.640]  And it lurks behind the media freakout
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:20.000]  over Trump's tweeting of this meme too.
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:22.440]  The media's view of right leaning web users,
[3:42:22.440 --> 3:42:23.760]  especially the younger ones
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:26.320]  who while away their days on Reddit and 4chan
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:28.560]  and other free for all hangouts
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:31.720]  has become crystal clear in recent days.
[3:42:31.720 --> 3:42:35.080]  It views them as almost animals.
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:37.360]  Certainly is incredibly dangerous.
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:40.200]  So brain fried and morally arrested
[3:42:40.200 --> 3:42:42.360]  that if they see one silly meme,
[3:42:42.360 --> 3:42:44.840]  they might storm CNN's HQ.
[3:42:45.880 --> 3:42:47.560]  And that really gets to the bottom of it.
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:49.800]  The bigotry of low expectations,
[3:42:49.800 --> 3:42:52.040]  they crafted this whole narrative.
[3:42:52.040 --> 3:42:54.880]  Will Trump's tweet cause violence against journalists?
[3:42:54.880 --> 3:42:57.720]  This is another example of the war on the media.
[3:42:57.720 --> 3:43:00.360]  Meanwhile, for the best part of the past two years,
[3:43:00.360 --> 3:43:03.200]  they've been openly legitimizing,
[3:43:03.200 --> 3:43:06.400]  inciting violent physical attacks
[3:43:06.400 --> 3:43:08.560]  on Trump and his supporters.
[3:43:08.560 --> 3:43:12.120]  They had the guy on their show within 48 hours
[3:43:12.120 --> 3:43:16.040]  who tried to jump the stage in Ohio, I think it was,
[3:43:16.040 --> 3:43:19.120]  last year to physically attack Trump.
[3:43:19.120 --> 3:43:19.960]  Did they decry it?
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:22.880]  No, they gave him a platform two days later
[3:43:22.880 --> 3:43:26.000]  to say how much of a bully Trump was.
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:30.240]  They ignored or blamed Trump throughout the entire campaign
[3:43:30.240 --> 3:43:31.840]  for violent attacks,
[3:43:31.840 --> 3:43:36.320]  almost all of which targeted his supporters.
[3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:37.600]  This is CNN.
[3:43:37.600 --> 3:43:39.280]  This is Sally Cone,
[3:43:39.280 --> 3:43:42.240]  the woman who supports Black Lives Matter,
[3:43:42.240 --> 3:43:44.400]  even after they marched down the street
[3:43:44.400 --> 3:43:46.400]  chanting for dead cops.
[3:43:46.400 --> 3:43:50.000]  Even though Black Lives Matter's ideological inspiration
[3:43:50.000 --> 3:43:52.280]  is a cop killing terrorist.
[3:43:52.280 --> 3:43:54.720]  These are the people who are decrying violence
[3:43:54.720 --> 3:43:57.160]  and that's what they do in the meantime.
[3:43:57.160 --> 3:44:00.360]  So no, you don't have the moral high ground, CNN.
[3:44:00.360 --> 3:44:04.320]  You don't have the moral high ground, Brian Stelter,
[3:44:04.320 --> 3:44:06.320]  to claim that Infowars is responsible
[3:44:06.320 --> 3:44:08.080]  for the hatred against CNN.
[3:44:08.080 --> 3:44:12.120]  No, the hatred against CNN is a direct result
[3:44:12.120 --> 3:44:16.440]  of you lying on a mechanized industrial scale
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:19.000]  for what, two decades or more now.
[3:44:19.000 --> 3:44:20.800]  That's the source of the hate.
[3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:23.240]  Trust in media was down in the toilet
[3:44:23.240 --> 3:44:26.920]  long before Trump came along, CNN.
[3:44:26.920 --> 3:44:29.040]  Don't point the finger at us
[3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:31.040]  when you're digging your own hole even deeper
[3:44:31.040 --> 3:44:33.680]  and that's exactly what's happening right now.
[3:44:33.680 --> 3:44:35.120]  They refuse to respond to it.
[3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:37.920]  I mean, Cuomo got himself in a mess earlier
[3:44:37.920 --> 3:44:42.360]  had to delete his tweet asking, should we out the identity?
[3:44:42.360 --> 3:44:45.040]  Well, should CNN reveal the name of Reddit user
[3:44:45.040 --> 3:44:47.400]  who made the Trump wrestling video?
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:49.600]  He had a lot of bigoted and hateful material
[3:44:49.600 --> 3:44:50.480]  on his page and website.
[3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:52.600]  Well, yeah, you've got a lot of fake news
[3:44:52.600 --> 3:44:54.520]  on your website, CNN.
[3:44:54.520 --> 3:44:56.840]  You gonna delete your website?
[3:44:56.840 --> 3:44:59.560]  No, but again, they're targeting him.
[3:44:59.560 --> 3:45:02.720]  This is completely sinister.
[3:45:02.720 --> 3:45:04.280]  Even people on the left,
[3:45:04.280 --> 3:45:07.760]  I've seen even never Trump people are freaking out
[3:45:07.760 --> 3:45:11.400]  about this and saying, this is a new low for CNN.
[3:45:11.400 --> 3:45:13.920]  This is a new low.
[3:45:13.920 --> 3:45:15.040]  This is blackmail.
[3:45:16.520 --> 3:45:19.600]  CNN's Cuomo asks if CNN should docks Reddit user
[3:45:19.600 --> 3:45:22.040]  because he holds bigoted views.
[3:45:22.040 --> 3:45:26.200]  Again, absolutely incredible going after people's dodgy posts
[3:45:26.200 --> 3:45:28.800]  on the internet just because they annoyed you
[3:45:28.800 --> 3:45:31.800]  by creating an anti-CNN meme.
[3:45:31.800 --> 3:45:33.640]  Not gonna go after ISIS.
[3:45:33.640 --> 3:45:35.280]  Not gonna go after Antifa people
[3:45:35.280 --> 3:45:38.840]  who literally tack Trump supporters with bike locks.
[3:45:38.840 --> 3:45:41.680]  No, we're gonna go after anonymous guys on Reddit
[3:45:41.680 --> 3:45:44.880]  who create wrestling memes.
[3:45:44.880 --> 3:45:47.800]  Video CNN holds ecstatic about exposing
[3:45:47.800 --> 3:45:50.520]  and identifying Trump meme creator.
[3:45:50.520 --> 3:45:51.680]  In fact, we've got this clip.
[3:45:51.680 --> 3:45:54.880]  This is off CNN New Day from this morning
[3:45:54.880 --> 3:45:57.000]  where they're up there celebrating this.
[3:45:57.000 --> 3:45:58.800]  Let's go to the clip.
[3:45:58.800 --> 3:45:59.640]  Up here.
[3:45:59.640 --> 3:46:01.280]  Something remarkable I thought happened yesterday.
[3:46:01.280 --> 3:46:04.440]  I thought it was remarkable that CNN found this,
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:08.200]  the Reddit user who created the gift of Donald Trump
[3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:11.480]  in the wrestling video and where he punches CNN.
[3:46:11.480 --> 3:46:13.280]  So the investigative team went back
[3:46:13.280 --> 3:46:15.320]  and found the guy who first created this.
[3:46:15.320 --> 3:46:16.360]  He took credit for it.
[3:46:16.360 --> 3:46:18.720]  And then here comes the remarkable part.
[3:46:18.720 --> 3:46:20.160]  He apologized.
[3:46:21.600 --> 3:46:24.440]  Oh, he apologized after your individual
[3:46:24.440 --> 3:46:27.720]  whose previous role on Twitter has been based
[3:46:27.720 --> 3:46:29.600]  around ruining people's lives
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:31.720]  for the comments for the posts they make.
[3:46:31.720 --> 3:46:34.440]  Oh, he apologized after that, didn't he?
[3:46:34.440 --> 3:46:36.400]  They're up there celebrating it.
[3:46:36.400 --> 3:46:40.000]  This is New Day, CNN, the producer of which is caught
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:42.400]  on video by James O'Keeffe and Project Veritas
[3:46:42.400 --> 3:46:45.760]  only last week, calling Americans, quote,
[3:46:45.760 --> 3:46:48.680]  dumb as S-H-I-T.
[3:46:48.680 --> 3:46:52.320]  That's the producer of that show, New Day.
[3:46:52.320 --> 3:46:53.840]  In fact, they caught him again today,
[3:46:53.840 --> 3:46:56.560]  Project Veritas has released a new video today.
[3:46:56.560 --> 3:47:01.080]  The same guy, Jimmy Carr, associate producer of that show
[3:47:01.080 --> 3:47:04.520]  that you just heard, talking about Chris Cuomo,
[3:47:04.520 --> 3:47:07.200]  one of the hosts, saying that they, quote,
[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:10.800]  can't stand the guy and were like, shut up.
[3:47:10.800 --> 3:47:13.600]  They even the producers of that show
[3:47:13.600 --> 3:47:15.680]  absolutely hate their jobs.
[3:47:15.680 --> 3:47:17.200]  They hate the hosts.
[3:47:17.200 --> 3:47:18.680]  They want them to shut up.
[3:47:19.720 --> 3:47:22.160]  If CNN thought his day was bad, it just got worse
[3:47:22.160 --> 3:47:25.000]  with the release of the latest Project Veritas video.
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:27.960]  And that is now starting to trend on Twitter.
[3:47:27.960 --> 3:47:28.840]  That's going viral.
[3:47:28.840 --> 3:47:33.200]  So a lot of hot mess for CNN today.
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:36.360]  But again, they've brought it on all themselves
[3:47:36.360 --> 3:47:39.680]  and they keep digging the hole even deeper.
[3:47:39.680 --> 3:47:41.160]  Few minutes left in this segment though,
[3:47:41.160 --> 3:47:42.720]  so I'm gonna move on to some other news.
[3:47:42.720 --> 3:47:45.200]  Anti-cop Hillary supporter assassinates
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:48.560]  mother of three in unprovoked attack.
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:51.280]  This of course happened early hours of Monday morning
[3:47:51.280 --> 3:47:52.960]  in New York city.
[3:47:52.960 --> 3:47:56.080]  The guy walks up to the female police officer,
[3:47:56.080 --> 3:48:00.200]  mother of three, guns her down in cold blood.
[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:03.000]  Pussy's hood up, walks up to the vehicle passenger side,
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:04.960]  guns her down in cold blood.
[3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:07.120]  Completely unprovoked attack.
[3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:09.080]  It wasn't a situation where it was a shootout,
[3:48:09.080 --> 3:48:10.640]  completely unprovoked attack.
[3:48:11.640 --> 3:48:15.240]  They're speculating what the motive was.
[3:48:15.240 --> 3:48:17.600]  Well, a little clue to the motive was
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:20.440]  Alexander Bond's Facebook page.
[3:48:20.440 --> 3:48:22.440]  He was later shot by police responding
[3:48:22.440 --> 3:48:24.600]  to the incident, shot dead.
[3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:27.040]  The mother later died in hospital.
[3:48:27.040 --> 3:48:30.440]  His Facebook page has anti-cop sentiment.
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:34.880]  It has him urging people to quote get mad
[3:48:34.880 --> 3:48:36.160]  about the election.
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:38.840]  By the way, in Four Wars found this earlier,
[3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:40.960]  nobody else has reported on this.
[3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:43.200]  He wants people to get mad about the election
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:45.480]  and vote for Hillary Clinton.
[3:48:45.480 --> 3:48:47.640]  He rants about how much he hates cops
[3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:49.360]  on this Facebook page.
[3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:53.120]  Now we've seen previous ambush style executions
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:55.720]  of police officers in New York City,
[3:48:55.720 --> 3:48:58.400]  in other cities where they cite
[3:48:58.400 --> 3:49:00.440]  Black Lives Matter style rhetoric
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:03.280]  about hating police officers.
[3:49:03.280 --> 3:49:07.120]  Was this inspired by Black Lives Matter style rhetoric?
[3:49:07.120 --> 3:49:10.280]  It was certainly inspired by anti-cop rhetoric.
[3:49:10.280 --> 3:49:13.480]  Was it inspired by anti-Trump rhetoric,
[3:49:13.480 --> 3:49:15.200]  given that this guy's ranting about
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:17.680]  how people should get mad about the election
[3:49:17.680 --> 3:49:19.960]  and vote for Hillary Clinton?
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:22.400]  We also had the Dallas massacre, remember?
[3:49:22.400 --> 3:49:23.240]  What was it?
[3:49:23.240 --> 3:49:25.280]  Eight, nine police officers shot dead
[3:49:25.280 --> 3:49:28.640]  as a result of an individual who was riled up,
[3:49:28.640 --> 3:49:32.720]  who was radicalized by Black Lives Matter style rhetoric,
[3:49:32.720 --> 3:49:35.280]  wanting to go out and kill white people.
[3:49:35.280 --> 3:49:38.600]  That's what he said motivated the massacre.
[3:49:38.600 --> 3:49:39.600]  Oh, and by the way,
[3:49:39.600 --> 3:49:43.000]  Black Lives Matter supporters were all over Twitter
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:46.080]  after that Dallas massacre, celebrating it.
[3:49:46.080 --> 3:49:50.360]  Even though several of the officers shot dead were Black,
[3:49:50.360 --> 3:49:52.840]  the woman, the mother of three,
[3:49:52.840 --> 3:49:56.200]  gunned down in cold blood in this incident was Black.
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:49:58.640]  What does Black Lives Matter have to say about it?
[3:49:58.640 --> 3:50:00.600]  Absolutely nothing,
[3:50:00.600 --> 3:50:05.200]  because it doesn't feed into their anti-cop narrative,
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:07.600]  their police-hating narrative.
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:11.040]  This is a big deal, but it's gonna disappear.
[3:50:11.040 --> 3:50:13.360]  And of course, the icons of Black Lives Matter
[3:50:13.360 --> 3:50:15.080]  have got absolutely nothing
[3:50:15.080 --> 3:50:16.800]  to say about it.
[3:50:16.800 --> 3:50:21.640]  We found his Facebook page, anti-cop rants, anti-Trump rants.
[3:50:21.640 --> 3:50:24.080]  This could be the main motivation.
[3:50:24.080 --> 3:50:26.080]  It could actually be a terrorist attack
[3:50:26.080 --> 3:50:28.560]  if the violence is politically driven.
[3:50:28.560 --> 3:50:30.280]  So that remains to be seen.
[3:50:31.880 --> 3:50:35.200]  New report, Majority of Voters Back Trump's Travel Ban.
[3:50:35.200 --> 3:50:37.760]  This is a poll released by Politico.
[3:50:37.760 --> 3:50:39.480]  It shows that a clear majority of voters
[3:50:39.480 --> 3:50:41.600]  support Donald Trump's travel ban.
[3:50:41.600 --> 3:50:45.120]  60% of voters back the president's policy,
[3:50:45.120 --> 3:50:47.240]  with 84% backing the restrictions,
[3:50:47.240 --> 3:50:48.640]  56% of independents,
[3:50:48.640 --> 3:50:52.280]  41% of Democrats support the ban as well.
[3:50:52.280 --> 3:50:54.880]  We'll be back to talk more news on the final segment
[3:50:54.880 --> 3:50:56.520]  of the Alex Jones Show Live breaking news
[3:50:56.520 --> 3:50:58.040]  at infowars.com.
[3:50:58.040 --> 3:50:59.520]  Don't go away.
[3:50:59.520 --> 3:51:00.800]  This is Elizabeth McCabe,
[3:51:00.800 --> 3:51:03.000]  aka Lucky One of Truth Requency News.
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:06.080]  I wanted to tell you all about Extendivite from heartdrop.com.
[3:51:06.080 --> 3:51:08.320]  Y'all know I check everything before I air it.
[3:51:08.320 --> 3:51:10.480]  When I heard about Extendivite on TFR,
[3:51:10.480 --> 3:51:12.800]  I went to heartdrop.com and started my research.
[3:51:12.800 --> 3:51:14.040]  It's got cayenne.
[3:51:14.040 --> 3:51:15.440]  That's good for blood and circulation.
[3:51:15.440 --> 3:51:16.840]  It stimulates the blood flow.
[3:51:16.840 --> 3:51:19.680]  It's got garlic, which fights bacteria like antibiotics
[3:51:19.680 --> 3:51:21.920]  and it blowers the cholesterol and blood pressure.
[3:51:21.920 --> 3:51:23.080]  It also has milk thistle,
[3:51:23.080 --> 3:51:24.880]  which is the best detox for liver.
[3:51:24.880 --> 3:51:26.040]  I couldn't wait to try it out
[3:51:26.040 --> 3:51:27.840]  and I'm glad I did four months ago.
[3:51:27.840 --> 3:51:29.360]  And here's obvious results.
[3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:31.040]  My hands and feet don't get cold anymore.
[3:51:31.040 --> 3:51:33.240]  The varicose veins have faded too.
[3:51:33.240 --> 3:51:35.280]  My wrists don't hurt after typing all day.
[3:51:35.280 --> 3:51:36.840]  Now I tell you all this because it's true
[3:51:36.840 --> 3:51:38.440]  and I want you to really live life.

[3:52:01.240 --> 3:52:03.600]  Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[3:52:03.600 --> 3:52:05.200]  Great. Hey, thank you so much.
[3:52:05.200 --> 3:52:08.120]  Listen, I have bought your product
[3:52:08.120 --> 3:52:10.360]  and I gotta say they're amazing.
[3:52:10.360 --> 3:52:12.120]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it
[3:52:12.120 --> 3:52:15.800]  because I've got caveman, superman of vitality,
[3:52:15.800 --> 3:52:18.360]  secret swell, vitamin and infusion.
[3:52:18.360 --> 3:52:19.880]  I've got the body armor.
[3:52:19.880 --> 3:52:21.200]  Wow, thank you.
[3:52:21.200 --> 3:52:23.160]  You're the type of listener that makes them all possible.
[3:52:23.160 --> 3:52:24.960]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[3:52:24.960 --> 3:52:28.560]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[3:52:28.560 --> 3:52:29.800]  That's amazing. That's really incredible.
[3:52:29.800 --> 3:52:31.920]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you,
[3:52:31.920 --> 3:52:33.240]  I felt incredible.

[3:55:36.480 --> 3:55:39.120]  Talking about making mistakes,
[3:55:39.120 --> 3:55:42.800]  New York Times falls for parody North Korea Twitter account.
[3:55:42.800 --> 3:55:47.800]  This is the most obvious satirical Twitter account on Twitter.
[3:55:48.120 --> 3:55:50.640]  The DPRK underscore news account,
[3:55:50.640 --> 3:55:53.760]  they fell for a tweet, a joke tweet,
[3:55:53.760 --> 3:55:55.200]  saying the North Korean government
[3:55:55.200 --> 3:55:58.120]  belittled the joint exercise between the US and South Korea
[3:55:58.120 --> 3:56:02.080]  as demonstrating near total ignorance of ballistic science.
[3:56:02.080 --> 3:56:03.480]  Said it looked like a,
[3:56:03.480 --> 3:56:06.120]  what was it, a drunken Malay or something.
[3:56:06.120 --> 3:56:07.680]  Obviously satirical tweet,
[3:56:07.680 --> 3:56:10.120]  the New York Times treated it as an official tweet
[3:56:10.120 --> 3:56:12.000]  from the North Korean government
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:14.000]  and put it in one of their articles.
[3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:16.600]  So they wind on about, oh, Trump's joke tweets
[3:56:16.600 --> 3:56:18.120]  are gonna start World War Three,
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:21.080]  while they're literally taking fake tweets
[3:56:21.080 --> 3:56:24.120]  and attributing them to the North Korean government
[3:56:24.120 --> 3:56:27.320]  as they test ICBM missiles.
[3:56:28.280 --> 3:56:30.600]  So it's happening to them as well.
[3:56:30.600 --> 3:56:32.920]  Of course, when we make a mistake, it's, oh my God,
[3:56:32.920 --> 3:56:35.440]  this proves how utterly discredited you are.
[3:56:35.440 --> 3:56:37.560]  New York Times, CNN does it on a daily basis,
[3:56:37.560 --> 3:56:40.920]  nobody cares, retraction, back of the newspaper.
[3:56:41.800 --> 3:56:44.920]  Swedish comedian plans Man Free Music Festival
[3:56:44.920 --> 3:56:48.400]  after mass sexual assault scars popular event.
[3:56:48.400 --> 3:56:50.400]  Swedish comedian has proposed what she terms
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:52.200]  a Man Free Music Festival
[3:56:52.200 --> 3:56:54.160]  after the cancellation of an event last weekend
[3:56:54.160 --> 3:56:55.840]  amid a slew of sexual assault reports
[3:56:55.840 --> 3:56:58.280]  and at least four allegations of rape,
[3:56:58.280 --> 3:57:00.640]  which is similar to what they proposed
[3:57:00.640 --> 3:57:03.600]  after the terrorist truck attack in Stockholm
[3:57:03.600 --> 3:57:04.880]  a couple of months ago,
[3:57:04.880 --> 3:57:08.680]  which was to ban vehicles from the city of Stockholm.
[3:57:08.680 --> 3:57:11.520]  Okay, banning men, banning vehicles
[3:57:11.520 --> 3:57:13.680]  isn't gonna get to the heart of the problem.
[3:57:13.680 --> 3:57:16.640]  The heart of the problem is Islamism,
[3:57:16.640 --> 3:57:19.160]  is radical Islamic terrorism.
[3:57:19.160 --> 3:57:21.560]  That's the origin of the problem,
[3:57:21.560 --> 3:57:24.360]  not men in general, not drugs.
[3:57:24.360 --> 3:57:26.080]  These rapes, these sexual assaults,
[3:57:26.080 --> 3:57:29.560]  Swedish music festivals, every single time,
[3:57:29.560 --> 3:57:32.440]  it turns out to be a Muslim migrant.
[3:57:32.440 --> 3:57:33.560]  There's your problem.
[3:57:33.560 --> 3:57:36.360]  Why are you letting in hundreds of thousands of people
[3:57:36.360 --> 3:57:39.680]  who have no respect whatsoever for women?
[3:57:39.680 --> 3:57:40.880]  There's your problem, but no,
[3:57:40.880 --> 3:57:42.640]  we can't admit that that's the problem
[3:57:42.640 --> 3:57:44.000]  because it might be politically incorrect.
[3:57:44.000 --> 3:57:45.360]  So let's just ban all men.
[3:57:46.520 --> 3:57:48.200]  Bill Gates warns that Germany's opened
[3:57:48.200 --> 3:57:50.760]  their policy to migrants will overwhelm Europe.
[3:57:50.760 --> 3:57:53.240]  Bill Gates actually being honest for once,
[3:57:53.240 --> 3:57:55.880]  a broken clock is right twice a day.
[3:57:55.880 --> 3:57:58.000]  He warns that European leaders risk deepening
[3:57:58.000 --> 3:58:00.080]  the migrant crisis by being too generous
[3:58:00.080 --> 3:58:02.400]  to those arriving on the continent.
[3:58:02.400 --> 3:58:03.840]  He's completely correct, of course,
[3:58:03.840 --> 3:58:07.640]  that is probably the highest profile individual
[3:58:07.640 --> 3:58:11.520]  to come out and warn about this migrant crisis.
[3:58:11.520 --> 3:58:14.760]  Even as Italy now says it's overwhelmed,
[3:58:14.760 --> 3:58:19.200]  even as Austria puts armed riot police on the border,
[3:58:19.200 --> 3:58:23.320]  armored trucks, to potentially turn away
[3:58:23.320 --> 3:58:25.120]  this mass wave of refugees,
[3:58:25.120 --> 3:58:26.880]  migrants, economic migrants,
[3:58:26.880 --> 3:58:29.120]  that could cross their border.
[3:58:29.120 --> 3:58:30.800]  Bill Gates is now warning about it.
[3:58:30.800 --> 3:58:31.640]  That is huge.
[3:58:31.640 --> 3:58:32.760]  That's gonna wrap it up for the show,
[3:58:32.760 --> 3:58:34.160]  Infowars Nightly News coming up.
