[01:01.640 --> 01:06.240]  plagued by scandal and when I was up covering Bilderberg a few months ago in
[01:06.240 --> 01:09.720]  Virginia I'd already been following his writing but I thought something like a
[01:09.720 --> 01:14.560]  cogent intelligent person compared to where the media had construed and
[01:14.560 --> 01:18.280]  twisted and exaggerated what he said and they said really well it's funny you
[01:18.280 --> 01:21.760]  notice his writing because he's a listener of yours and would love to come
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.840]  on the show so John Rocker I guess he's probably doing it right now he's going
[01:26.840 --> 01:30.960]  to be joining us for his maiden visit with us and we'll talk about what he
[01:30.960 --> 01:35.640]  really stands for not what the media has said John Rocker stands for I got a
[01:35.640 --> 01:39.120]  copy of his book around here they gave me one I wrote it's pretty darn good we're
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.280]  gonna be talking about that as well John Rocker dot net is his website I of

[02:01.360 --> 02:05.760]  be joining us today to talk about well he said what do you want to talk about
[02:05.760 --> 02:09.880]  he said I want about the PSA and boy there's a lot of news on that front so
[02:09.880 --> 02:14.880]  we'll be discussing it that said then we have a special guest hadn't been on a
[02:14.880 --> 02:19.200]  while but back my pal through demand talk show host and compounding pharmacist
[02:19.200 --> 02:25.920]  Ben Fuchs and I do not intend to belabor a bunch of longevity products that I
[02:25.920 --> 02:29.320]  believe are the best that we that are available info wars team.com he is
[02:29.320 --> 02:32.440]  going to join us we've done research for this interview I have done research
[02:32.440 --> 02:36.560]  because I listen to his show some that comes on right before mine on GCN GCNL
[02:36.560 --> 02:40.800]  com and it's indicated getting on a lot of stations and hurting the other day
[02:40.800 --> 02:44.960]  just going through all the vitamins and minerals and reading what the what what
[02:44.960 --> 02:50.720]  scientists admit it causes if you have a deficiency pancreas going out diabetes
[02:50.720 --> 02:58.600]  cancer skin problems hair falling out I mean just all of it we're gonna go
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.400]  through a blitzkrieg in the third hour I mean I'm gonna just sit here like I
[03:03.400 --> 03:06.880]  did with Tarpley last night for an hour and 30 minutes he talked about 70% of
[03:06.880 --> 03:11.680]  the time and just let him roll with the info on the economy and more that video
[03:11.680 --> 03:14.880]  is up at prisonplanet.tv right now but the point is I'm gonna try to just sit
[03:14.880 --> 03:19.400]  back and have him rapid fire roll through this because I want to know more
[03:19.400 --> 03:22.960]  and I know you want to know more and I want to ask him questions like LA
[03:22.960 --> 03:29.240]  Times no yolk eating the whole egg as dangerous as smoking see it sounds
[03:29.240 --> 03:34.320]  reasonable to ban smoking or put incredible taxes on it but there the
[03:34.320 --> 03:38.120]  globalists don't care about us they push illegal corrupt drugs on us dangerous
[03:38.120 --> 03:42.680]  drugs vaccines but they get something like smoking the UN said 30 years ago
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.600]  they would globally standardize a demonization campaign and I understand
[03:46.600 --> 03:51.120]  why it's really bad for you especially the additives and then set the precedent
[03:51.120 --> 03:55.080]  just like the precedent with toilets or light bulbs or and then pretty soon
[03:55.080 --> 03:58.280]  there's home inspectors in your house and pretty soon you can't have dust in
[03:58.280 --> 04:02.520]  the barn so they shut down the family farm you know child labor laws sound good
[04:02.520 --> 04:06.120]  until they ban you having your 10-year-old carry out the garbage which
[04:06.120 --> 04:09.880]  they've done in areas of Europe and your kids divorce you because the state tells
[04:09.880 --> 04:13.640]  them to on television yeah so this is what's going on the breakup of the
[04:13.640 --> 04:18.800]  family there's all these big moves to outright ban cigarettes you'll just make
[04:18.800 --> 04:24.920]  a black market or bring it to the point of where a package is $20 they want
[04:24.920 --> 04:28.520]  this control because they want to start it's already started in New York outright
[04:28.520 --> 04:33.640]  bans of large 16 ounce and above drinks and things and shins salt and all the
[04:33.640 --> 04:38.600]  rest of it $2,000 fines if you put salt and food I'm not joking this is the
[04:38.600 --> 04:41.400]  control freak model it's not that is that any state loves you they want to
[04:41.400 --> 04:49.480]  control you next is going to be eggs and all the cashless society face-scanning
[04:49.480 --> 04:53.760]  to buy and sell will mark what you're eating you'll be given a surcharge for
[04:53.760 --> 04:58.400]  it that's the plan it's coming just like black boxes in your cars big news

[09:04.040 --> 09:08.600]  deficiencies so that's in the third hour today with compounding pharmacist Ben

[09:12.600 --> 09:18.160]  through with both of those guests obviously that said Paul Watson is
[09:18.160 --> 09:22.560]  working on a story that is going to break in the next 15 to 20 minutes at
[09:22.560 --> 09:30.960]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com if you go to the drudgereport.com right
[09:30.960 --> 09:35.800]  now two of our stories are top stories one of them was the top story yesterday
[09:35.800 --> 09:40.560]  is now gone down the left-hand side the other is the top story on the right-hand
[09:40.560 --> 09:45.440]  side now social security administration to purchase a hundred to seventy four
[09:45.440 --> 09:55.040]  thousand rounds of bullets of ammo that is an info wars.com Paul Joseph Watson
[09:55.040 --> 09:59.960]  article now Paul is hot on the case of this last year it was 250 million
[09:59.960 --> 10:05.080]  rounds of 40-cal alone this year five months ago 450 million rounds made big
[10:05.080 --> 10:11.120]  news now last Friday and we noticed it Sunday did an article Monday that
[10:11.120 --> 10:18.600]  again went national because drudge linked to it they purchased 750 million
[10:18.600 --> 10:23.880]  rounds then it came out the National Weather Service her office was ordering
[10:23.880 --> 10:29.680]  15,000 to 25,000 per office we're talking basically every major city's got a
[10:29.680 --> 10:36.760]  National Weather Service Senate now this morning because these orders are coming
[10:36.760 --> 10:44.640]  so fast on top of the one point four billion in less than 12 months it was
[10:44.640 --> 10:51.640]  what the 250 million round purchase was made in September of last year so 11
[10:51.640 --> 10:58.920]  months ago 250 mil 450 mil 750 mil and now they're breaking the orders up in
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.800]  200,000 300,000 174,000 now they're flooding in and guess what happened
[11:03.800 --> 11:12.080]  this is breaking in the next 20 minutes Homeland Security illegally with new
[11:12.080 --> 11:16.640]  purchase orders yesterday because they know under federal law unless mandated
[11:16.640 --> 11:22.280]  by Congress and the National Security Council in consultation with the
[11:22.280 --> 11:28.080]  National Security Committee in the House of Representatives and the Senate if
[11:28.080 --> 11:32.440]  they don't have authorization and a mandate from Congress they cannot
[11:32.440 --> 11:39.880]  classify something Homeland Security has now blacked out new orders for more
[11:39.880 --> 11:44.800]  ammo on top the one point four bill that went out yesterday Watson is in there
[11:44.800 --> 11:50.880]  every morning he's working at 2 a.m. our time because he's in England six hours
[11:50.880 --> 11:56.800]  ahead of central so so when I'm sawing logs at 6 a.m. Watson's already up and
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.440]  they have now blacked it out in the purchase orders you can go into the
[12:02.440 --> 12:05.920]  federal government websites by law they have to list the open contracts there
[12:05.920 --> 12:12.240]  it's not classified in fact it's not even listed restricted and it lists that
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.760]  they put these bids out and that they're making these purchases and they blacked
[12:16.760 --> 12:20.640]  it out and ladies and gentlemen he's got screenshots of it all it's so
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.520]  infested that they didn't run it through a machine that blacked it out like the
[12:25.520 --> 12:31.720]  CIA they use black markers we blew it up you can read what it is they can't
[12:31.720 --> 12:40.880]  these lazy people are too out of control criminalize to even black it out by the
[12:40.880 --> 12:44.520]  way it's illegal and I've got I looked it up Watson's adding that to his article
[12:44.520 --> 12:49.760]  we had a consultation a little talk before I went live on there today and and I
[12:49.760 --> 12:52.680]  went and looked it up for my memory that's it's not a congressional mandate
[12:52.680 --> 12:56.840]  that's why it's put on that public bid process that's why it's listed they have
[12:56.840 --> 13:00.960]  illegally black this out now don't expect Congress to take them to the
[13:00.960 --> 13:05.600]  woodshed for it but Watson has now found some of these national endowment
[13:05.600 --> 13:11.240]  groups for democracy and others connected to these ammo purchases and now we
[13:11.240 --> 13:15.800]  know why they're getting so many Watson is ferreting this out right now this is
[13:15.800 --> 13:22.160]  not confirmed but we have the linkage it appears a large portion of the 1.4
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.800]  billion plus is being shipped to Turkey and then into Syria so the bullets are
[13:27.800 --> 13:35.240]  going to Al Qaeda I mean you can't make this up it's an Iran conference
[13:35.240 --> 13:40.080]  situation by Hillary over there and that's why they're blacking out these
[13:40.080 --> 13:43.680]  bullets it doesn't matter I tell you man it's fast and furious where they ship
[13:43.680 --> 13:48.240]  20,000 guns hang grenades not just to Mexico but to Honduras and inside the
[13:48.240 --> 13:55.520]  US, Chicago, Illinois, Indianapolis, Indiana, Tampa, Florida yeah they ship
[13:55.520 --> 14:00.680]  guns there to to to gangs that are killing gangs they want to knock out I
[14:00.680 --> 14:04.400]  mean these are just mafia people I shouldn't be sitting around laughing at
[14:04.400 --> 14:08.680]  them I can feel the wings of the angel of death flapping around wouldn't be
[14:08.680 --> 14:12.000]  here but wouldn't forgotten your prayers and by the way I just want to say
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.600]  that here today I am so incredibly thankful that I was ever born I'm so
[14:15.600 --> 14:19.400]  incredibly thankful to my family to my wife my children and their courage I'm
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.760]  so incredibly thankful to you the listeners and supporters and and and
[14:23.760 --> 14:30.000]  people that have supported us in the media out there talk show host webmasters
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.040]  journalists for putting up with us because everybody knows we're not perfect
[14:34.040 --> 14:37.240]  but we're real where we try the best we can we try to tell the truth we try to
[14:37.240 --> 14:40.280]  be accurate we have a really good track record compared to the mainstream media
[14:40.280 --> 14:45.880]  that tries to lie that I have lived a full and great life and I feel successful
[14:45.880 --> 14:54.280]  I feel a life of worth and of value and I don't have any fear because I know I'm
[14:54.280 --> 14:57.600]  on the right path I know I'm in the right course and I hope I'm alive to be a
[14:57.600 --> 15:03.120]  hundred years old I love life I just love my dogs watching them eat and jump
[15:03.120 --> 15:08.760]  around and sit in my lap I love my children watching them learn I just love
[15:08.760 --> 15:14.480]  my family I love goodness and I love truthfulness and and straightforwardness
[15:14.480 --> 15:20.440]  and uprightness doesn't mean I'm up on some high horse myself I recognize my
[15:20.440 --> 15:25.680]  slovenliness and worldliness and all the rest of it I just being honorable and
[15:25.680 --> 15:32.560]  being good and being strong and not being afraid is so fulfilling it is so
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.480]  fulfilling to go through all the tribulations we face and know that more
[15:37.480 --> 15:42.080]  are coming it's just fulfilling the worst things that have happened to me in
[15:42.080 --> 15:46.080]  my life when I'm doing the right thing it is always a lesson it is fulfilling
[15:46.080 --> 15:49.920]  and it's not like oh I'm the poor victim I feel sorry for myself it's the
[15:49.920 --> 15:54.760]  opposite it's the strength of the species it's the it's the communing with
[15:54.760 --> 15:58.560]  my ancestors the ones that were straight and strong and did the right thing and
[15:58.560 --> 16:04.640]  and and lifted up the species it is it is you see I'm an individualist the
[16:04.640 --> 16:08.280]  globalists are counterfeiters they try to create a counterfeit of what's
[16:08.280 --> 16:13.960]  already there we are individuals but individually in our basic code of honor
[16:13.960 --> 16:19.200]  and our basic understanding of what's wholesome and good we are communal we
[16:19.200 --> 16:24.720]  are collective but it's not a force collective it is an individuals through
[16:24.720 --> 16:31.440]  shared beliefs and ideas and passion and and souls that are similar we commune
[16:31.440 --> 16:38.640]  with those in the past because there's a connection mother to son a father to
[16:38.640 --> 16:45.240]  daughter father to son just just down me in the last you know 6,000 years of
[16:45.240 --> 16:52.440]  recorded history there's only been 60 real generations if you ever think
[16:52.440 --> 16:59.360]  about that and and so that's not that long ago is it and so that person you
[16:59.360 --> 17:02.440]  know your great-grandparent even if you never met them they they took care of
[17:02.440 --> 17:06.800]  your grandparents who had your parents who had you there's a direct electrical
[17:06.800 --> 17:10.960]  connection and this isn't even really a spiritual thing it's a genetic thing it's
[17:10.960 --> 17:23.160]  a it's a consciousness art-type old race memory that's what instincts are I let
[17:23.160 --> 17:26.760]  my children go see brave because they're thinking about doing an analysis of it
[17:26.760 --> 17:31.400]  thinking about putting my children on TV they want to go on air they want to you
[17:31.400 --> 17:34.080]  know even though that's dangerous they they have a desire to do it I think I'm
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.680]  gonna let them take the risk that's what's life's all about and I said okay go
[17:38.680 --> 17:42.880]  watch this movie and do a review with your mother the two older ones and my
[17:42.880 --> 17:46.800]  kids don't get scared hardly anything but there's a big evil bear in it and it's
[17:46.800 --> 17:51.160]  a cultic and stuff as well druidic and my daughter came home and said man that
[17:51.160 --> 17:58.520]  really scared me that big bear and that's because instinctively our ancestors
[17:58.520 --> 18:04.360]  dealt with big mean cave bears but twice the size of a grizzly bear and so
[18:04.360 --> 18:08.880]  instinctively that's why when you come out of your house at night when you come
[18:08.880 --> 18:11.000]  you know when you come out of your house it's like coming out of your cave
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.440]  that's where big animals big predators used to wait to eat us that's why you
[18:15.440 --> 18:18.360]  feel fear coming out of your house that's why going in and out of a
[18:18.360 --> 18:21.120]  threshold because that's where something's going to be waiting all of that
[18:21.120 --> 18:28.360]  is really racial memories and it is satisfying in the human race to connect
[18:28.360 --> 18:33.040]  and do the right thing as our forebears did and then we are an example of those
[18:33.040 --> 18:37.440]  that come in the future and that's when everything clicks into position and
[18:37.440 --> 18:41.200]  that's when you become satisfied
[18:41.880 --> 18:46.040]  so many people are not satisfied because you're not going to find
[18:46.040 --> 18:49.920]  satisfaction in sports you're not going to find it in sex you're not going to
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.080]  find it in being a tough guy you're not going to find it in any of those things
[18:54.080 --> 18:58.840]  I mean sure there's a place for all of it but when you think that's the center
[18:58.840 --> 19:02.400]  of your universe and that you're going to find fulfillment just in that that is
[19:02.400 --> 19:08.840]  not the case the great dedications are where you're going to find satisfaction
[19:08.840 --> 19:13.840]  and the defense of the innocent we are winning all the polls are out there
[19:13.840 --> 19:17.040]  we're winning the fight for the Second Amendment we're winning the fight
[19:17.040 --> 19:21.320]  against abortion worldwide they're freaking out young people it's off the
[19:21.320 --> 19:25.120]  chart despite the programming or turning against because they're teaching them
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.160]  that abortions wonderful kids know how to rebel it's built in in case you've
[19:29.160 --> 19:34.240]  got bad people the truth is young people don't really rebel if you teach them to
[19:34.240 --> 19:39.320]  become leaders and and and chiefs in their own area if you put them in danger
[19:39.320 --> 19:44.320]  if you challenge them if you put them out there and treat them as adults they
[19:44.320 --> 19:48.480]  will actually they will never rebel against you because by the time they
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.760]  get to the age to be to rebel they're 13 14 there already men and women they're
[19:52.760 --> 19:57.200]  already ready to be men and women they only rebel when you suppress them they
[19:57.200 --> 20:03.200]  only rebel when you don't turn them into adults Alex Jones here with a great

[24:38.760 --> 24:44.100]  you you're gonna watch us there's seven billion of us and we know about the
[24:44.100 --> 24:49.160]  globalist we know about how you control both sides of conflicts we know your
[24:49.160 --> 24:54.080]  game plan those of us that are awake and we are massive numbers we're gonna
[24:54.080 --> 25:02.360]  wake others up as well thank you so much for joining us again we do have John
[25:02.360 --> 25:08.120]  Rocker joining us I've got something a little lighthearted we're gonna play when
[25:08.120 --> 25:13.600]  we come back from the break I've never aired it before it is satire you will
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.200]  notice that right away and we're gonna post the video of it if you're a radio
[25:18.200 --> 25:22.680]  listener and want to follow along you can go there and watch it it is a new
[25:22.680 --> 25:28.440]  presidential candidate that is announced of that they're running for 2012 on a
[25:28.440 --> 25:34.480]  third-party ticket yes that is coming up in the next segment it's about eight
[25:34.480 --> 25:40.000]  nine minutes long then I will continue with the news but Watson soon will have
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.600]  an article that is not satire unfortunately up and this fits the
[25:46.600 --> 25:51.760]  pattern of fast and furious the 1.4 billion rounds of ammo because now
[25:51.760 --> 25:59.040]  they're ordering millions of rounds of ammo in combat rounds 308 223 but also
[25:59.040 --> 26:09.800]  357 Magnum 357 SIG 38 everything and it looks like what you give a ragtag army
[26:09.800 --> 26:13.840]  that's got a bunch of different governments like NATO consortium giving
[26:13.840 --> 26:16.920]  them weapons and again Watson is ferreting into that I hope other
[26:16.920 --> 26:20.840]  journalists look into it his new article coming out just deals with they're now
[26:20.840 --> 26:26.720]  blacking it out on top of the 1.4 billion and change bullets of the last year
[26:26.720 --> 26:35.240]  or 11 months to be technical again 1 billion this year 250 mil and 750 mil
[26:35.240 --> 26:39.680]  one bill 1 billion bullets bought now they're buying a bunch of others the
[26:39.680 --> 26:45.280]  post office the social security administration the Department of
[26:45.280 --> 26:54.680]  Education the National Weather Service NOAA that is over the fission
[26:54.680 --> 26:58.440]  wildlife the federal folks I mean you would think they were getting ready to
[26:58.440 --> 27:03.160]  fight a trillion Martians landing or something and again some of the spin is
[27:03.160 --> 27:08.360]  all we always buy ammo really we looked up the numbers this is at least ten
[27:08.360 --> 27:13.880]  times what all federal law enforcement has ever bought in fact I've got my
[27:13.880 --> 27:16.560]  researchers putting that article together be out the next few days we've
[27:16.560 --> 27:21.800]  we found some of the numbers I mean in the past they might have bought might
[27:21.800 --> 27:30.400]  have bought a million rounds of ammo for the entire FBI in a year I mean and
[27:30.400 --> 27:33.920]  that's a lot for target shooting and all the things they're doing and what they
[27:33.920 --> 27:40.800]  have there were cases where total you know non-military we're talking about
[27:40.800 --> 27:46.760]  50 60 70 million rounds getting bought in a year we're talking about a billion so
[27:46.760 --> 27:52.560]  when I say ten times it's way over that it's way and again there hundreds and
[27:52.560 --> 27:58.480]  hundreds the last purchase I saw was over 300 last year and they finally got
[27:58.480 --> 28:00.840]  delivered the last few months that's why you're seeing them everywhere first on
[28:00.840 --> 28:08.000]  the back of trucks and trains big giant black war wagons are you know that have
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.200]  a homeland security seal on them and they're given to local police these
[28:11.200 --> 28:14.920]  aren't old army vehicles that are surplus you know for the SWAT team to roll
[28:14.920 --> 28:18.840]  up in a house where there's an active shooter these are big giant armored
[28:18.840 --> 28:23.040]  vehicles that have homeland security that homeland security has but also local
[28:23.040 --> 28:28.640]  police are getting more helicopters more drones weaponizing drones checkpoints
[28:28.640 --> 28:37.800]  of these mobile armored pill boxes it is mind-blowing the military buildup and I
[28:37.800 --> 28:43.560]  know I just keep harping on this and harping on this and harping on this Max
[28:43.560 --> 28:47.440]  Kaiser he's on Friday sent us this article it's out of Bloomberg Paulson
[28:47.440 --> 28:53.200]  Soros had gold his price declines most since 08 yeah big governments universities
[28:53.200 --> 28:57.040]  and the elite the insiders who made their money because they have the inside
[28:57.040 --> 29:03.680]  knowledge that's confirmed now libel or all of its staged they are just hoarding
[29:03.680 --> 29:07.120]  the daylights out of gold right now buying the daylights out of the gold
[29:07.120 --> 29:12.520]  stocks the physical that's Bloomberg so we're gonna be getting into that he
[29:12.520 --> 29:15.480]  sent me this email he said the smart money knows the collapse is coming they
[29:15.480 --> 29:20.160]  are getting ready buying gold silver but the ETFs they buy only honor delivery
[29:20.160 --> 29:26.840]  on fifty thousand dollar buys anyone who buys less will get wiped out so he'll
[29:26.840 --> 29:31.800]  explain that to us on Friday that a bunch of financial news a bunch of Paul
[29:31.800 --> 29:37.400]  Ryan news look I've analyzed Paul Ryan and I've got to say he's always been
[29:37.400 --> 29:43.800]  anti-abortion and he's always been pro-gun and he's actively fought for
[29:43.800 --> 29:52.000]  both so I've got some comments on that we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:52.000 --> 30:02.560]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network Alex Jones here with a great way

[34:22.640 --> 34:27.800]  more than 200 million dollars worth of doctor payoff speaking of Mike Adams

[34:32.200 --> 34:38.280]  Obama over bin Laden bragging leaks yeah cuz it's all a bit big PR made up
[34:38.280 --> 34:41.560]  story it's what they blew the helicopter up on the ground and the rest of steel
[34:41.560 --> 34:46.320]  team six that knew about it got blown up remember that member I didn't predict
[34:46.320 --> 34:51.240]  that would happen Chelsea won't rule out political run oh is there no end of
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.440]  these demons but she's had her nose job and stuff nothing against that it's just
[34:56.440 --> 35:01.000]  whatever bunch of plastic people it's like Joan Rivers it's like she's 40 years
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.320]  old and the portrait of Darian or Dorian Gray or whatever you call it a
[35:05.320 --> 35:12.760]  girl in Poe we're gonna also get into bizarre statements by Biden about Romney
[35:12.760 --> 35:17.000]  saying that you know he wants to put chains back on you and again Romney is
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.480]  a globalist there's no debating that but how does how does Paul Ryan change
[35:22.480 --> 35:27.360]  things because I've really done soul searching about this whole situation and
[35:27.360 --> 35:32.640]  I'm gonna give you my take on where I stand on the 2012 election after we go
[35:32.640 --> 35:41.480]  to this piece of satire now I did this back in back in January of this year
[35:41.480 --> 35:46.800]  about seven months ago and we did it teleprompter free this wasn't written
[35:46.800 --> 35:50.640]  you know when we did this comedy piece people comment oh it's pretty funny you
[35:50.640 --> 35:53.960]  know Alex you need better writers there aren't writers here other than news
[35:53.960 --> 35:57.880]  article writers by the way we're waiting on Watson's article that should go up
[35:57.880 --> 36:01.480]  any minute not the Social Security Administration to purchase a hundred
[36:01.480 --> 36:04.760]  seventy four thousand rounds of hollow point bullets that's the top story at
[36:04.760 --> 36:11.640]  drudgereport.com right now and that is big news and not the weather national
[36:11.640 --> 36:16.480]  weather service doing the same thing no now they're blacking out new purchases
[36:16.480 --> 36:22.480]  and they're of all different types so this is either for a foreign army this
[36:22.480 --> 36:25.720]  is either for Mexico to destabilize things which you know they also shipped
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.560]  ammo down there it's for something clandestine this is even more than they
[36:29.560 --> 36:33.760]  need for an all-out civil war the American people or or maybe it is to
[36:33.760 --> 36:39.760]  bankrupt smaller shops and people who cannot get all this ammo now and who
[36:39.760 --> 36:43.800]  can't sell ammo and it's not that it's just the price is too high to buy you
[36:43.800 --> 36:51.240]  can't get most of it and now they're buying all the calibers so Watson's
[36:51.240 --> 36:54.840]  found some connections to shipping this to Al Qaeda we're gonna get into that as
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.680]  soon as his article goes up it should go up any minute any minute he's also
[36:59.680 --> 37:03.600]  gonna post this video this satire video if you didn't see it because I never
[37:03.600 --> 37:07.640]  played it on air and it gets pretty funny towards the end but why am I airing
[37:07.640 --> 37:11.760]  this now on the radio I didn't air it before I heard on TV again we shot it
[37:11.760 --> 37:17.120]  where I interviewed myself as cover commander it's a joke and you know that
[37:17.120 --> 37:20.480]  we edited it right before the nightly news and put it on so we did all of this
[37:20.480 --> 37:26.240]  in about an hour I got Nicobre commander outfit did my bit didn't did
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.560]  questions to myself on the screen and then put it on air so it's and I want
[37:31.560 --> 37:34.880]  to do more of this it's why we've hired six reporters that are now making their
[37:34.880 --> 37:38.400]  way down here and more video editors and stuff with all the capital you've helped
[37:38.400 --> 37:42.440]  us accrue because I mean I want to do serious stuff I want to get back to
[37:42.440 --> 37:46.080]  making films I want to get back to more you know reporting around the country
[37:46.080 --> 37:51.120]  and I want to do satire because let me tell you our satire pieces have our
[37:51.120 --> 37:54.480]  social commentary pieces and our pieces on media we're gonna do more of that
[37:54.480 --> 38:00.120]  that's what's really reaching a wider audience because our government acts
[38:00.120 --> 38:04.840]  like Cobra commander a fictional bad guy torturing setting people up shipping
[38:04.840 --> 38:11.680]  arms around to destabilize things so why not have Cobra commander run I mean we
[38:11.680 --> 38:16.000]  don't know who Obama really is we don't know who Cobra commander is he's got all
[38:16.000 --> 38:22.960]  these different names and rumors about who he is so here is my little satire
[38:22.960 --> 38:26.160]  piece and then we will come back with Watson's article that I'm told is going
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.640]  up any minute at prisonplanet.com and m4.com this is big now that they're
[38:30.640 --> 38:35.200]  blacking out how much ammo they're getting after 1.4 billion and again they
[38:35.200 --> 38:39.480]  don't have authorization to do that this is supposed to be public you have to get
[38:39.480 --> 38:44.400]  authorization from Congress to classify something if you have a mandate so this
[38:44.400 --> 38:47.360]  is a big deal I mean they'll just start classifying everything they classified
[38:47.360 --> 38:50.160]  how much radiation comes out of the scanners turns out it's enough to kill
[38:50.160 --> 38:55.960]  you over time doctors are saying that so here is my interview with well a
[38:55.960 --> 39:01.040]  humanitarian Cobra commander we're now joined by humanitarian and overall
[39:01.040 --> 39:05.600]  trendy Cobra commander he is a international terrorist a dictator

[39:20.920 --> 39:26.040]  know the media reaches out to Cobra commander or Cobra leader quite often
[39:26.040 --> 39:30.840]  and he refuses to come on but he has agreed to do this interview because he
[39:30.840 --> 39:37.480]  has a big announcement tonight to make to the people that live in this 1984
[39:37.480 --> 39:43.440]  society and again if you're not with the Cobra leader or mr. Cobra then you're

[51:04.800 --> 51:08.960]  hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[51:08.960 --> 51:13.240]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[51:13.240 --> 51:17.520]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[51:17.520 --> 51:21.080]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[51:21.080 --> 51:25.160]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[51:25.160 --> 51:29.160]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients
[51:29.160 --> 51:32.680]  increases e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your
[51:32.680 --> 51:36.240]  supply I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all
[51:36.240 --> 51:39.680]  known this was coming you know about their delicious long-term storeable

[55:11.840 --> 55:17.960]  not gonna get into a whole breakdown of that I will soon okay you know this
[55:17.960 --> 55:22.440]  story is too big I'll have to bring this up with mr. Rocker when he's on and
[55:22.440 --> 55:25.720]  then and then more in the third hour because we're running out of time right
[55:25.720 --> 55:31.320]  now but DHS classifies ammo purchases following controversy and already
[55:31.320 --> 55:34.240]  covered this a lot before the article came out the Department of Homeland
[55:34.240 --> 55:38.880]  Security has redacted information relating to the quantity of bullets it is
[55:38.880 --> 55:42.480]  buying following a controversy concerning the agency's purchase of over a
[55:42.480 --> 55:45.920]  billion rounds of ammo which many fear is a sign of federal government's
[55:45.920 --> 55:49.520]  preparing for civil unrest the United States despite the fact that documents
[55:49.520 --> 55:52.880]  are only supposed to be redacted of authorized by Congress or for national
[55:52.880 --> 55:58.560]  security reasons a solicitation posted on the Fed biz ops website yesterday
[55:58.560 --> 56:02.600]  concerning ammunition purchased by the DHS on behalf immigration and customs
[56:02.600 --> 56:06.600]  enforcement which they used under Rex 84 really for the American people ice
[56:06.600 --> 56:11.160]  contains numerous blacked out sections we know Border Patrol is involved
[56:11.160 --> 56:14.440]  helping arm the Mexicans under Obama's orders wonder if that's part of that is
[56:14.440 --> 56:18.040]  this fast and furious probably the classified portions of the document
[56:18.040 --> 56:26.680]  include references the amount of 223 and 223 64 grain ammunition being
[56:26.680 --> 56:31.440]  purchased and it just goes on so now they're doing that and he goes through
[56:31.440 --> 56:36.520]  the rest of it I'll talk about this more tomorrow but I really want to do the
[56:36.520 --> 56:42.880]  right thing in soul searching I cannot vote for Mitt Romney I know he's been
[56:42.880 --> 56:49.600]  for abortion gunmans open mortars carbon taxes globalism tax exempt garbage
[56:49.600 --> 56:56.360]  all of it he's fake but Paul Ryan has got a lot of issues no child left behind
[56:56.360 --> 57:04.680]  in the AA Patriot Act banker bailouts and I don't get into lesser of two
[57:04.680 --> 57:10.000]  evils here but I do have to say he has voted and actually fought not just paid
[57:10.000 --> 57:17.200]  lip service against abortion that's a big rubber meets the road issue and he's
[57:17.200 --> 57:20.960]  been pro-gun and he's one of the only people out there defending the Second
[57:20.960 --> 57:26.080]  Amendment right now when you've got the Republican leadership Bill Kristol
[57:26.080 --> 57:33.160]  well you name it Bill O'Reilly Rupert Murdoch the list goes Michael Savage
[57:33.160 --> 57:38.440]  saying and we don't need semi-autos ban them so he had leased his paying lip
[57:38.440 --> 57:42.760]  service to that so I don't know what to do I just with Romney there wasn't
[57:42.760 --> 57:45.360]  really a difference between him and Obama and I know if Romney gets in
[57:45.360 --> 57:48.840]  conservatives and libertarians will go to sleep and I guarantee you Romney just
[57:48.840 --> 57:51.880]  going to continue what everything Obama did because that's what the globalist
[57:51.880 --> 57:55.880]  one like Bush supported you know at the end carbon taxes and shutting down
[57:55.880 --> 57:58.800]  power plants it's not about the environment it's about big company
[57:58.800 --> 58:07.080]  shutting down the competition but if I then don't at least admit that Paul
[58:07.080 --> 58:12.200]  Ryan's a better than Obama even though he'd be VP then it's all well I'm like
[58:12.200 --> 58:17.880]  not saying he's good on abortion and guns so I'm rarely is it I'm a good talk
[58:17.880 --> 58:20.840]  shows because I'm decisive I believe what I believe I think about it and
[58:20.840 --> 58:27.320]  that's it but on this I'm just sharing with you my own personal my own personal
[58:27.320 --> 58:31.200]  you know thoughts because I don't want to just be pigheaded and sit here and
[58:31.200 --> 58:37.040]  attack Ryan when he's got some good attributes what do you think let me know
[58:37.040 --> 58:40.320]  at Twitter real Alex Jones
[58:42.280 --> 58:48.880]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:41.680]  eight months is a sign of their abject panic and fear it's a sign of the
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:45.360]  tyrants wanting to mass their weapons against us but more and more of the way
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:48.640]  this ammo is being bought all the different calibers and the way it's
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.800]  connected to the State Department and other groups and other agencies and the
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.600]  way it's being sent all these places on the east coast I think they're fencing
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.560]  this stuff out to the to the al-qaeda rebels and Watson says he's ferreted
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.920]  into some info that suggests that but all I know is they did fast and furious
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.960]  they're capable of doing anything we know they're arming al-qaeda is this part
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:13.280]  of it dhs classifies new ammo purchase following controversy that's up at info

[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.720]  gotten dropped from time to time or very small Israel to demand guarantee Obama
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.640]  will attack Iran that's not just Richard Silver team's excellent article
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.280]  Richard Silver's team we also have articles in Israel saying that's where
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.400]  everything's going I mean this is scary times to say the least that is all
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.240]  coming up but let's look at this top story ahead of John rocker joining us
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:35.040]  dhs classifies ammo purchase following controversy and again they just can't do
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.920]  that because this isn't mandated to be classified that's why they're supposed
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.200]  to put it out for public bid and show what it's for despite the fact the
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.960]  documents are only supposed to be redacted of authorized by Congress for
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.920]  national security reasons a solicitation posted on the Fed biz ops
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.040]  website yesterday concerning ammunition purchases made by dhs that's the foreign
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.000]  banker absorption army on behalf of immigration and customs enforcement
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.600]  contains numerous blacked out sections dealing with 223 and other rounds we have
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.240]  the image of it up there the solicitation and the classified portions of the
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.920]  documents include references the solicitation explains how the contract
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.400]  put up with the dhs to purchase the ammunition was not subject to full and
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:24.360]  open competition ah no bid a process justifiable at dhs claims was an
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.880]  unusual and compelling urgency to require the bullets so that means they
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.760]  can pay way above market to drive up the price that that's and you notice some of
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.320]  these big globalist brokerage firms are buying up the ammo and gun companies and
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.440]  now when dhs buys these it drives up the price out of our reach oh yeah this is
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.120]  part of it no doubt noting that there was a shortage of bullets which is
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.320]  threatening a situation which could cause substantial safety issues for the
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.040]  government oh yeah if you don't have more than 1.4 billion rounds should law
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:58.600]  enforcement officials not be adequately armed the Department of Homeland
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.440]  Security's decision to black out sessions the document including the number of
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.080]  bullets being purchased is likely to be related to a massive controversy which
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:10.720]  is snowballed over the last few weeks yeah we got two articles on drudge right
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.800]  now with it drudgereport.com the last few weeks pertaining to concerns as to
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.600]  why the federal agency has purchased well over a billion rounds of bullets
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:25.880]  over the last six months alone yeah it's over 1.4 billion the last year the
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:30.040]  DHS decision back in March to purchase 450 million rounds of 40 caliber
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.600]  hollow point bullets which are designed to expand upon entry and cause maximum
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.640]  organ damage well the point is they're illegal in warfare under the Geneva
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.120]  Convention so our military doesn't use them but they're used on us because
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.520]  we're the scum we're the milk cows we're the idiots and it just goes on it's a

[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:09.080]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:23.200]  man I tell you they had Joe Biden come out and say that Paul Ryan and Mitt
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:29.880]  Romney want to put chains on the black people basically and it just shows the
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:34.680]  incredible racial division that the left always engages in not because they care
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.360]  about people coming together racially because they want to keep people on that
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:44.200]  hate plantation and it must work because what 95% of folks voted who were
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:51.280]  black ended up voting for Obama again I wouldn't vote for somebody on their
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:58.360]  race I would vote for someone on what they stood for but now the Romney
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.160]  campaign has come out and said quote take your campaign of division and anger
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:08.240]  and hate back to Chicago and I tell you Obama coming out and saying if you have
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.480]  a business you didn't build that you didn't do that somebody did somebody
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:17.240]  else did that that's a quote that's what I would say if I wanted to lose but it
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.760]  also shows you know we got government-run healthcare now I mean they're
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.280]  doing what they want they want to get us a customer of this so they can take
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:32.400]  over businesses like Hugo Chavez does down in Venezuela just amazing to say
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.800]  they're gonna put you all back in chains we've got the clip we're gonna play it a
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:41.800]  little bit later in the broadcast now we are joined for the next 45 minutes or
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:48.560]  so by well author businessman he's been very very successful in business John
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:56.320]  Rocker and of course you also know him as being a top national baseball major
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.160]  league baseball relief pitcher who played for a bunch of major teams like
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.320]  Atlanta Braves Cleveland Indians Texas Rangers you name it and he's known for
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.960]  all the big controversies with statements he made taken out of context
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.480]  twisted because I've seen a lot of other controversial statements even more
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.160]  controversial that don't seem to catch on so we'll ask him today why he thinks
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:20.680]  that happened but we're not we don't have John Rocker here because of all that we
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.920]  have him so you can actually hear him soundbite free in a long-form interview
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.480]  because I like reading his writings over at worldnetdaily.com
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:34.600]  WMD.com and that's why he joins us today and we'll also get into his book
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:42.640]  Rocker Scars and Strikes and he joins us right now good to have you on with us
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:49.960]  John. Well we appreciate having you well I mean tell us who you really are
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.320]  because I know that's kind of what you do with worldnetdaily where you really
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.000]  stand and because I know how the media works once they take something and run
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.840]  with it they once said that I said kill Michelle Malcolm even though I didn't
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.920]  people with her yelled that and then I still and Blaine was saying that so so
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.080]  the and then once it's not in the national news and the truth is there
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.280]  or there's even a retraction in the newspaper nobody reads it. You're
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.040]  absolutely right and Alex I'm gonna be a pain in the back side here for a second
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:26.320]  I'm getting a lot of feedback on my end can we can we hang up start over? Absolutely
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.000]  you called into our system do you want us to call you? How about you guys just
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.160]  return the call? I'm just getting a lot I'm hearing every word that I'm saying and
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.080]  in my right ear here it's gonna be very distracting through it through a long call.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:43.680]  I'm sure maybe we can turn our audio to him down guys. John how's that sound?
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:49.600]  Let me think. Yeah okay I'm not here to speak. I'm still here then Alex.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.080]  Alright well we'll call you right back or you call us back. Hey this is a great way
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.680]  to build up an interview. Exactly call me back man. Alright we'll call your
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:03.720]  right back we'll see how that goes. Is that on our phone lines? They work fine.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:08.560]  He does sound dynamite. Did he call into a digital line a high-def phone line?
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.880]  That's probably what it is which is great you know we try to give you high-def
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.680]  phone lines here and talk radio and we try most talk radio national shows and
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.360]  even do that. We use high-def connections when the person has them but
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.960]  sometimes there's problems and we use Skype audio Skype when they don't want
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:28.240]  to do video because the quality is better. I don't know why I go on a lot of
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.200]  great national shows and they don't ever do that. I'm like hey we have digital
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.920]  phone lines hey we have we have audio Skype hey we have no no regular phone
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.440]  line and and maybe they're right to not do that because sometimes you do have
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.040]  the problems especially when somebody calls in once the show is already in
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.480]  motion. So I hope to get him on the show because I was up at world net daily
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.800]  headquarters and they were telling me he was a listener so I look forward to
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.880]  getting his take on the DHS and TSA was what he wanted to talk about here on the
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:04.480]  broadcast today. Spike Lee says Obama will do whatever he wants in
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:13.320]  second term. New Black Panthers to RNC our feet will be on your mother effing
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:20.040]  necks. Talk about being FBI funded. In Harvard essay young Michelle Obama
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:27.360]  argued for race-based faculty hiring. Top Homeland Security official to leave
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:37.320]  after lewd conduct charges. One of big sister's special friends so you know
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:44.080]  special friends in that she reportedly was promoted without having any of the
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.560]  job requirements she needed. All you got to be is an anti-American jackbooth though
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:56.520]  I thought and have the TSA abuse everybody. Hey John. How's it sound?
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:02.160]  Oh, it's fine. How's it sound now?
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:09.240]  That's okay. Hey listen, good to have you here. Wow, where should we start? Tell us
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.320]  about what you've done out of baseball and are you're very successful in
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.600]  business? You know I guess you know very successful is always I get from the
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.280]  out of the holder always have a relative statement. You know I got in the
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.800]  real estate you know really really back in the late 90s when I first started playing
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.240]  I did a lot of successful deals so just kind of you know just a little bit
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.640]  style investor shopping centers, multifamily deals, a few single family
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.000]  attached deals. I was fortunate enough I guess to kind of surround myself with
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.880]  some very influential people some very noddle people some very experienced
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.920]  people obviously you know 20 30 sometimes 40 years my senior that really
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.920]  gave me kind of a hard for real-world education in real estate. I did my
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.280]  first real estate deal by myself my first solo deal actually I was still
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.480]  playing a little 70 lot deal up north of Atlanta. I did that to complete that back
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:07.240]  in 2004 but got it in 2002. I was still the Texas Rangers up off the dirt and we
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.840]  started designing and felting and things like that. Field took on a little
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.120]  better. I didn't quite fall flat in space but it was really kind of hitting
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.240]  its stride when the market was kind of down the downsliding. Had to cut
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.840]  flights to the decent bit, Dalton, Georgia which is the big north of Atlanta where
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:30.160]  Mohawk is and Shaw has got about 20% unemployment now so you can imagine how
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.920]  that affects real estate. But probably into that I started doing some bigger
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.800]  deals, single family attached deals, multifamily deals and you know in that
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.520]  two three four year period of time from say 06 to 010 it was an absolute
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.960]  display and for the time you know working 12 hours a day kind of stuff
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.920]  but you know you were you were already pregnant. There was no
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:55.640]  choice but to have the kids. So you know all those deals, got them done, got them
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.880]  built. The multifamily has done real well. The first sale party's not done so well.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.760]  It's done like it said kind of basically playing for the time. You're not
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.720]  only making a whole lot of money if you just get out of this trouble you're back
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.080]  you're happy. Well I had just read that you've been pretty successful in real
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:14.360]  estate. And it's done well. I can't say that it's been all roses but it's
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.400]  only had been all bad here. It's been in this market you know if you're making
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.520]  any money I would say you are very successful. You're right. Sure. Tell us
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:27.520]  about the book. I've read it. It's very interesting and then the columns you're
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:33.200]  writing for World Net Daily. You know the book it was just something that you know
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:37.400]  lots of I just kind of need to get off my chest obviously with what you talk
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:41.680]  about before we broke for a brief period of time a few minutes ago. Just the
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.880]  gross dispersection that media has you know continued to hammer home for you
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.560]  know better than a decade or actually more than a decade now. Just kind of gotten
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.680]  tired of it. And you know the old cliche and actually used this cliche in my book.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:00.040]  You know the old cliche is go ahead and pick a fight with a guy who bought an inked
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:04.960]  by the truckload. Well you know like this book I've decided to buy my own
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.800]  truck and write my own book. I didn't I didn't have a dose while this book I
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:15.120]  didn't have a very brief partial extremely you know small amount partial
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.880]  collaboration with Jill by the name of Jay Marshall Craig. I wrote a couple books
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.720]  for Chuck LaValle The Rolling Stones, Eric Berger The Animals. He makes an
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.680]  entertainment type writer and writes about and collaborates with a lot of
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.560]  those type people. He did a nice little intro for me. He helped me out a lot of
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:36.960]  research before sitting down and pounding on those computer keys day in and
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:41.920]  day out for about 14-16 months that that was all me. So just a lot of stuff to
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.880]  get off my chest. A lot of you know close records to clear and just you know
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.120]  kind of kind of make my peace with God sort of thing. And you know I had
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:54.520]  how many interviews I've done, TV, radio, just a lit I mean I mean literally well
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:58.200]  into the hundreds possibly in the thousands over the years when we're
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.320]  conversations have gone just like this, the songs still remain the same. I was
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.240]  just you know kind of like we do what was you were saying earlier. Once a
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.680]  perception is out there, once an ideology, especially about someone a
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:15.560]  specific person is out there, in the media it's very tough to change. In the
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.420]  60s story about John Rocker, the one that drives ratings of films, magazines, and
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:23.280]  newspapers, is John Rocker all the hateful fated racist from the South.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.680]  That's the one that you splash that catch and that headline on top of the
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.440]  newspaper article. You're selling U.S. radio days and you're selling New
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:35.360]  York Times. The truth about John Rocker is not very sexy. It's not going to
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:39.320]  generate ratings. It's not going to sell magazines and newspapers and drive that
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:45.240]  dollar to the bottom line which is what you know journalism and media is.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:49.240]  Kind of like anything else. It survives and thrives off capitalism, off making
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:52.640]  money. The more papers you can sell, the more magazines you can sell. Sure and
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.560]  awful of controversy but I mean I mean a lot of your statements are really
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.880]  taken out of context and weren't even that big of a deal. Why do you think they
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:08.840]  chose you to keep hyping things up? I don't know. I think I was good for ratings. I was
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:14.280]  good for PR and obviously when you pick a fight with possibly the news
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:19.560]  capital of the world, there's a lot of eyes and ears listening and looking and
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:23.840]  a lot of fingers to type and write those articles. Yeah that's probably it. I mean
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.760]  you criticize New York and from some of the quotes and said people were like
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:33.520]  slobs on the train and I guess some of the trains and you do see
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:36.960]  some slobs on them and yeah that's the thing. New York does not like being
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.920]  criticized and so I think it was the hard type of we're gonna get that southern boy
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:47.240]  now. You know there's one quote that's blown around out there you know
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:51.680]  supposed to be hating porters. You know one thing I love to talk here and this is
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.440]  why. Stay there. Let's come back. Stay there. We gotta go to break. John Rocker's
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.480]  our guest. We're gonna get into your view on what's happening right now with the
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:05.160]  TSA as well. Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts. Get off
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.160]  the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power. Folks with what's been
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.240]  going on in this country I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.200]  how vulnerable it is. That's in the mainstream news every day. Millions of
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.920]  people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms

[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.000]  that every family needs to be ready for blackouts and if you don't have a

[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.560]  headline the Huffington Post John Rocker's new book scars and strikes aims to
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:23.000]  fix the former pitcher's public image he's also writing for worldnetdaily.com
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.680]  he gets criticized because he says hey speak English the illegals are running
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.680]  around putting Mexican flags on top of American flags are pulling them down and
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:38.720]  telling us we should speak only Spanish in San Francisco it was in MSNBC a few
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.640]  years ago that the Hispanic kids can't wear American flags at school they're
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.720]  told that's racist so this has gotten so crazy now that if you're for our
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.400]  sovereignty you're bad and we'll cover that with him I totally agree with him
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.840]  on that front and he shouldn't be criticized for that but it shows this
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.240]  out-of-control political correctness how serious it's gotten but but you were
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:02.560]  wanting to make your point about immigrants as we went to break that's
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.160]  why I raised that John yeah we were we're well and like I said well we'll
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.600]  get into a little a little deeper of my old speaking English campaign and kind
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.960]  of the nuances around that a little bit later but you know in in in the one quote
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.600]  that I've been vilified for you know low these 12 13 years was simply talking
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.680]  you know immigration policy benefits detriments legal immigrants things like
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.920]  that and probably went on about 20 or 30 minute conversation I love talking
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.800]  politics I love writing this this week we call for world that daily they just
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.520]  give me cart blocks or write about kind of whatever and a lot of things I write
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:41.360]  about have political and social undertones and that kind of stuff I
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.080]  certainly enjoy doing that's one of my passions but when you have a 30 minute
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.040]  conversation like I said about immigration immigration policy
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:52.520]  benefits detriments illegal immigrant illegal immigration how it's negative
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.800]  and possibly positive you know for our society and for our culture and in the
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.760]  writer and then Mr. Berlman has got a long rich history of defaming and
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.280]  degrading pretty much every single subject he writes about every individual
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.520]  he interviews or chooses to the point of dirty individuals being at pretty much
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.680]  has done to them exactly what he did to me it is my firm belief that I've done
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.880]  so many of these print interviews over the years and actually after about 2006
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:24.560]  2007 I swore off print because so many times it's my belief when you sit down
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.120]  with a print journalist you're basically in consequential they know before they
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.200]  sit down with you what what type of article they're gonna write how they're
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.280]  gonna try to portray you in the or you're a prop you're a prop so they can
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.120]  claim they did a real interview exactly and all they need you for is ability to
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.320]  put a couple of quotation mark within their article to make their article
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.040]  seems seem more legitimate give it some more character and things like that they
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.200]  know what kind of article they're gonna write about you how they're gonna
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:53.560]  portray you in that article long before they sit down with you and Jeff Perlman
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.440]  after the article came out I should have done this obviously before but I've known
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.480]  the man for about two three four years spent you know many afternoons evenings
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.320]  and clubhouse he was ahead of Facebook Wifers Sports Illustrated
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.920]  many afternoons with him and then he was about a year old and I thought we were
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.640]  kind of buddies I don't need to check this guy out but looking back looks he'd
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:16.160]  written articles he'd written and even going forward I mean pretty much anyone
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:19.800]  he writes about he just spared his up one side down another Walter Payton
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:24.120]  recently in his book called sweetest about Walter Payton I mean just rips
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:30.360]  Walter Payton a new one I mean hey the man is a sports icon a legend a
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:34.120]  revered legend and second of all he's dead I mean the guy can even defend himself
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:38.360]  yet Jeff Perlman thinks it's in good taste to write a book that largely talks
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:45.360]  about one of his the beloved American icons and football talk about off field
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:50.000]  transgressions drug abuse marital infidelity all these call the negatives
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.200]  about him that's what Jeff Perlman chooses a focus on that's the man that
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:57.520]  wrote this article about me and yeah he took a 30 minute conversation and
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.720]  gleams out eight words here and half a sentence there and a few little you know
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:07.640]  nuggets there slaps on a page with his context around it and then basically
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:13.640]  fulfilled the theme that he set out to write before we ever even sat down and
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:18.960]  it's disgusting and they they write though for a certain crowd of sports
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:24.120]  fans that really hate athletes and successful people and they just do it
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:29.960]  so they feel good watching somebody big fall and you know if somebody's human
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:34.280]  and has problems I don't want to watch them fall I like watching tyrants and
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:38.240]  abusers fall but it's not a satisfaction it's more of a you know knowing the bad
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.720]  guy's been beaten yeah and then you just just read the headline the caption from
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.280]  the Huffington Post I did an interview about a month ago now that was the first
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.360]  print interview I've done in probably four or five years and going into it I'm
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.600]  like yeah I'm sort of grudgingly doing it I gave the girl a great interview and
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.320]  she was obviously from a democratic side of the political coin we had great
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:15.000]  batter we had great or interviewers what I thought was really good I picked the article of read I'm like is that the same interview I gave really and no matter what I said about how good and or bad the interview I gave that girl
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.240]  now see they're cheaters when I've written articles and interviews because I'm so used to
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:22.280]  doing them live on Arab of the years if somebody makes a good point I leave it in
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.920]  there because I want to have an interesting interview but you're absolutely
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.480]  right a lot of these journalists are archetypal cowards they love the median
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.560]  of a taped interview because they can edit it however they want they can
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:39.800]  always win and in their mind they win when they make somebody more wealthy
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:44.000]  more successful with more physical prowess and mental prowess than them
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:50.080]  look bad what a joke we'll be right back with a long segment stay with us we're

[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:07.960]  grandmothers wig and under you know in in grandmothers pockets
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.760]  safer when I walk through the TSA lines I see some of people are supposed to be
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:14.440]  protecting our countries in the upper-down our country picking our
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:18.440]  airways you know certainly not feel any safer you know looking at some of the
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:22.760]  folks that have been commissioned with that you know I think we can all
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:27.320]  collectively agree on that that will ever be done to improve upon the whole
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:32.240]  system and hold concept there who knows I'm privatizing it would probably a
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.840]  start you know certainly what they're doing I don't think we offer the whole
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:42.040]  lot I believe if I'm speaking incorrectly please correct me all the
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.600]  plots from the underwear bombers of the shoe bombers don't ever else out there
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:52.520]  have been uncovered by CIA and FBI you know and investigations and things like
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:57.960]  that over there been caught in a TSA line it is just a drastic hassle that
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:04.880]  basically weighs down everybody well now the TSA is expanding out to the roads
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:10.160]  the highways the bridges while they basically leave the borders wide open
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.920]  I mean it's amazing what's your what's your take on well I mean give us your
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:25.520]  view on that well actually I'm just hearing about the first time but it is actually laughable to provide that much manpower to roads and
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.640]  roads and bridges and things like that when you just hit the nail on the head the
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:34.280]  borders are wide open you know basically just a chain link fence that anybody can
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:39.920]  just pull right on through yeah that is actually laughable to spend that much
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.560]  energy money manpower secure bridges and obviously that needs to be done to
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:50.120]  watch the bridge you know the Lincoln tunnel things like that obviously you
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.640]  know a extremely traveled thoroughfare here's how about coming in and out of
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:57.800]  New York City definitely safety you know some kind of safety you don't have feds
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.880]  who aren't even police doing it and obviously cameras can you know cameras
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:05.440]  and things to do that the point is it's a giant power grab what's your view on
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:08.760]  fast and furious I mean they've been caught shipping the guns into Mexico
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:15.120]  they've been caught using it to blame the second amendment yeah if you're not
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.400]  doing anything you know that if you don't want the American people to know
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.720]  about the documents yeah how hard is it to be executive privilege we've been
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:27.000]  trying this issue for a president six months now stories seem to change on a
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.200]  weekly basis if you if you're not doing anything that you need to hide you know
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:35.040]  turn over the you know X number of hundred documents that the congressional
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.880]  committee wants to see what's being done with it you know trying to play the
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:42.080]  race card and you know now we tell you how the exertion executive privilege and
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.080]  I mean we're just when we're dancing around things it should be not issues
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.840]  if there's nothing to hide let's see the documents let the American public know
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:52.520]  what the congressional committee have there you know they're there you know
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.640]  they're day in a hearing and say okay we've investigated no harm no foul watch
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:03.000]  our hands clean let's move on this is a situation if there wasn't anything you
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.120]  know overtly wrong was going on it could have been solved months ago
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:12.080]  there's obviously something something money monumental there holders have you
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:19.720]  heard the quote from the vice president saying that if they vote for all Ryan
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:23.880]  and Mitt Romney that they're gonna have chains back on them
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:30.160]  I was watching watching Fox Fox is born man actually heard that and you know
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.520]  you just every time you think you make it some headway you know on the social
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:39.120]  side of the fence race relations you know meaning of race relations and in
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.680]  unifying and becoming a more cohesive America moving forward we can you know
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.640]  look past these you know these differences and nationalities and skin
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:53.200]  segmentation and things like that some boo comes up with a comment like that and
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:57.680]  just drive that nail home once again well sure but my point is they go after
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:01.520]  you for statements that were a lot milder than that racially and then you've
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:06.760]  got Obama the Chicago organizer Reverend right with all this pure race stuff and
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:13.000]  then Biden obviously using racial politics why is it okay for the so-called
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.280]  liberals to do this all day well when you have 80% of the media being of
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:25.160]  liberal mindset and what you were just talking about going in that way I guess
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:31.080]  you know racial rhetoric you have 80% of the media who that's where we get you
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:36.360]  know the large majority you know 90% of our news information comes from media
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:43.280]  who is 80% liberal if the person that's getting that that you know racial
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.760]  rhetoric if they're basically preaching to the choir with 80% of the media who
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.960]  keeps those thoughts and ideals and things like they disagree they're the
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:54.880]  ones are going to be hammered yet if you're if you're preaching to the choir
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:58.160]  the people are getting the message out and getting the word out that they're
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:02.320]  not going to get it out in that fashion and let you're someone like me that's
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.560]  where it goes against the mainstream with the mainstream media their false
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.160]  ideals that they're going to throw on you pretty quick if you're speaking in
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.000]  the same in the same vein that they speak and they think in everything go
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.600]  right along with you and give you carte blanche what is your take on Mitt
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:24.760]  Romney shifting in another area I mean he has a very you know globalist big
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:28.920]  government type voting record is governor and the policy supported
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:34.760]  restricting guns open borders helped write what became Obamacare supported
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:40.520]  no-chall left behind supported carbon taxes Al Gore type stuff I mean what do
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:44.080]  you do when you've got Obama who's so bad and then you've got Mitt Romney I
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:48.040]  mean is it a lesser of two evils I mean I have to say Paul Ryan has been
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.600]  anti-abortion he has been pro-second amendment so that overall is a good
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:56.080]  thing but then I get upset about the Republicans supporting Patriot Act in
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:59.400]  things that are really being used on the American people
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:04.600]  I'm right there with you and it isn't just just one more one more situation one
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:08.240]  more electricity goes by you're not necessarily voting for the candidate you
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:12.240]  like you're voting against the candidate you don't like I mean it's Mitt Romney
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:17.720]  you know if we could build a candidate we built Mitt Romney absolutely not but
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:24.000]  I can tell you if we could be presented with two candidates both of which we
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.560]  didn't build you know what would be people that think with our mindset and
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:32.800]  our mindframes our ideologies would take Mitt Romney all day long over Barack
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:37.760]  Obama he definitely has a lesser of two evils my only issue is if Obama was in
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:40.880]  again I think this country wake up so much it'd be over for that whole
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:45.760]  globalist communist fascist you know I think right now they're just gonna take
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.200]  them heavy lifting I still think we can we can kind of kind of change the tide
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.680]  change the course run it's gonna take you know a big fat parking break to get
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:59.000]  us there turn around reverse go in the other direction I think if we had you
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.640]  know three or four more years of that I think the ship will be too far under
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.720]  water that's a right at that point yeah well and you know that's the debate let
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:10.840]  things get really bad and then America totally swings the other way towards
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.080]  freedom or would it be so bad Obama could stage something I mean if they'd
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.320]  stage fast and furious as Larry Pratt said a few weeks ago from Gunners of
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.520]  America they would stage anything I've got some other political questions for
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.760]  you but let's go to another area you're about to start a national speaking tour
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.040]  and in fact if people want to read what you're actually writing and saying
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.680]  instead of what the media is spinning it's John rocker net is that a good
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:51.040]  website to visit
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:42:06.480]  come out every Tuesday the lack of emphasis put on the family structure
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:10.960]  how that affects our communities how that affects America large you know so
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:13.480]  every week is something different this week I'm gonna write about this kind of
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:17.880]  a tribute to our Olympians so the Olympics into the couple days ago and
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:21.560]  it's just how proud we should be of our weapons and then just this is a kind of
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:25.160]  life they leave and sort of the torch they carry to use the these sort of a
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:29.800]  cliche phrase there for the torch they carry you know and it's a beacon for
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:34.560]  Americans for a great job they do it that I'm gonna write about that this week
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:39.120]  looking at the world in general geopolitically nobody was a fan of
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:43.640]  Gaddafi or even Assad but they they had been working you know with the West and
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.640]  not not you know stirring stuff up and actually kind of come in out of the
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:52.600]  cold and then now Obama and NATO and others I'm sure you saw the controversy
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:56.880]  a few months ago where the Joint Chiefs told Congress that the UN and NATO is
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:01.160]  now over our over our military and then Congress seem to sit there and take it
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:05.440]  have you seen the reports where they admit Al Qaeda is the main force that
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:19.400]  NATO is aiding in Libya taking it over and now in Syria what's your take on
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:48.280]  that that sounds pretty crazy to me that was Gaddafi and Assad I mean they
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.520]  admit Al Qaeda is the craziest bunch so was a why is Obama aligning with Al
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:44:04.720]  Qaeda yeah it's it's a super super creepy
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:17.760]  and we talk and we ran we you know we voice our opinions and we question
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:33.400]  everybody it's very difficult I think to really know exactly what goes on under
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:37.000]  the veil of foreign policy and so we have a full candidate and he's you know
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.760]  he's six months away eight months away from being in office I'm gonna do this
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:44.960]  on foreign policy and this here's me my stance but I would love to be a fly on
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:51.280]  the wall it's a first you know behind the scenes foreign policy meeting date to
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:55.040]  an office you're sitting out all right now president Obama you were saying the
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.480]  campaign trail as it relates to foreign policy here's all things you're gonna do
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:04.920]  let's fill you in on what it's like in Libya in Syria in Egypt in and just
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:09.760]  watch watch the now not Kennedy more but now present just watch the look on his
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:16.320]  face going oh really I would love to really be in the CIA meeting then the
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.920]  end of the covert meeting room and and really know exactly when we were saying
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:23.720]  why are they lying without kind of I would love to know there's I mean
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:29.560]  he's really nice obviously you know policy wise on several you know main
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:33.320]  frames of policy we certainly don't agree with ourselves the eye but he's
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:36.840]  certainly not a dumb man why would he do something like that there definitely has
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:42.080]  to be more than the human eye me and no I know well sure I know why I mean I
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.440]  wanted your take look I mean I've had a bunch of top geopolitical analysts to
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:48.680]  people that formerly headed up the State Department black ops like Steve
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.280]  Pachennick Dr. Pachennick of a few days ago the reason is they want to get a
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.560]  Sunni Shiite civil war going so the Arabs all kill each other and that is
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.840]  sounds like a very immoral thing to me it's one thing people say oh it's a
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:06.280]  class parking lot and all this letting Al Qaeda take over these countries and
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:10.520]  overthrow Western dictators that it actually been a stabilizing force I'm
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:13.880]  not defending Mubarak putting in the Muslim Brotherhood has made it worse
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.080]  for women you name it I mean if we claim we're against all that extremism then
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:23.160]  actually putting it in direct things is very very cold-blooded people say oh
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:27.040]  Obama must be a Muslim he's putting Al Qaeda in now he's putting them in there
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:30.320]  to destroy those countries and it's super
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.120]  based on their you know three thousand year history you really have to make an
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.160]  effort to get those people to fight with each other I mean you really don't know
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:42.320]  exactly so if you ship them a bunch of arms and weapons and inject them in there
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.640]  they're gonna blow the place up no I mean
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:50.600]  they're gonna do that anyway it doesn't it doesn't matter who's in charge yeah but
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:54.480]  I mean I think John that's where this comes from is that is it is there just
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:58.320]  written off all those poor people over there and every time they try to have a
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:02.960]  secular government or a government that builds up their nation the West goes and
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.360]  puts radicals in that's what the British have been doing for a hundred years I
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:12.720]  mean it's it's a program of divide and conquer and I and you know it's a very
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:17.680]  dangerous policy and I I mean I don't think you agree with that policy do you
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:22.640]  know absolutely not but it's like I just in there again you know I'm not
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:29.720]  not even gonna even a claim to be a you know a student on on on on you know the
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:36.480]  philosophy that ideologies of his work in that that that region over there but
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:40.480]  you just just seen you know for centuries for you know for decades and
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:44.840]  certainly century you know what a mess has been over there no no I hear you I
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:48.200]  hear you it is a mess but I mean look at Europe in its constant wars with each
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:52.360]  other I mean this is I think this is more of a human mess but but I I do see
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:55.800]  what you're saying I just want to somehow figure out peace in closing I
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.680]  want to talk a little bit about the tour coming up the specifics how people
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:02.400]  find out about that trying to empower communities a very laudable goal there
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:08.880]  John Rocker famous obvious a baseball player is our guest here what do you see
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:13.600]  happening if Obama gets back in because if he's already engaged in all this
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:18.400]  criminal stuff so far what do you think he'll do if he gets back in John Rocker
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:23.600]  obviously just the massive runaway that will continue the class warfare will
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:29.280]  continue socialism will will begin the blank of socialism I think will it's
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.440]  already begun will continue to spread over our country I think about how he's out
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.400]  of office in four years I think you'll have 70 to 80 plus percent of people in
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:42.720]  in some way to reform living off the federal government hard-working people
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:47.560]  like myself and yourself paying for it passing up to that burden and then that
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:51.880]  financial workload down to our kids and our kids kids I fully but truly you'll
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:57.960]  see the American dream start to disseminate and why do you think the
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:01.560]  collectivists want to discriminate wealth and happiness everywhere they take
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:07.840]  over they create living hells you know I think I think it comes from just a
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.560]  sure simple fact of a bleeding heart but they feel sorry for everyone they they
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:16.440]  want to reach out to those who supposedly can't you know can't can't do
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:21.920]  for themselves and they have a real defeatist attitude as far as the actual
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:27.760]  ingenuity capability and ability above the human man woman and they just um
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:32.400]  that I just think everybody needs to be taken care of obviously look down on
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.080]  those that have excelled and succeeded that somehow at Barack Obama said a
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.680]  couple weeks ago you didn't do that yourself I tell you this right now and
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:45.000]  nobody got big got me to the big leagues except me all the companies I've started
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.600]  the public stuff done nobody has done those except me sure I had people that
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.880]  working for me and things like that I couldn't have done it without some my
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:57.480]  employees and that kind of stuff but in the day 90% of what got done I was I
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:02.080]  was sure the attack on on on the individual is what every collectivist do
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:06.640]  is directly out of Len and Stalin now and and and it does show the crazy
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.320]  disconnect I'm in a total disconnect with reality exactly and those that have
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:15.480]  not done that those that have not looked out for themselves they you know beat
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.800]  down people like me and you that have risen above and then you know an
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:22.680]  introduction and blood sweat and tears have gotten we've gotten somehow we've
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:26.520]  cheated somehow we stepped on the little man and we should we should start
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:29.760]  leaning down and picking up the little man picking them up because Lord knows
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:33.120]  they can't do it themselves well absolutely can't do it themselves but
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:37.120]  that block is our rep in the mind sure they don't want the little guys to know
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:41.040]  they can reach up so they've got to pull anybody who's successful down and
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.720]  they're getting ready to try to take everything that producers have made so
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.720]  they're telling the disenfranchised who they want to keep down that we're the
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:52.360]  bad guys John Rocker thank you so much for spending time with us the book

[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:14.560]  about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:18.480]  news every day millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:22.600]  because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:26.920]  capacity I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:31.040]  and if you don't have a backup system in place I've got a great opportunity for

[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:26.360]  every vitamin and mineral and what is admitted mainline medical science what
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:32.520]  those deficiencies cause what illnesses what diseases this is going to be
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:38.640]  incredibly informative because I've actually preplanned this interview as a
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:43.320]  special presentation so we'll do the full hour with pharmacist Ben Fuchs I
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:48.800]  was calling Doc Fuchs because he knows so much compounding pharmacist of 20
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.840]  years he's going to be joining us remember a year and a half ago Fukushima
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:56.960]  and they told you there's no radiation and it did later come out in mainstream
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:00.480]  news they'd covered up the real level of radiation including what's hitting the
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:07.200]  US and their answer is more reactors and again I understand nuclear power could
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:11.720]  be a good source but you the companies won't run them safely they won't store
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:16.040]  the waste safely they won't go to new designs they've got a bunch of 35 40-year
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.560]  old reactors that are are rotting because the radiation eats through
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:27.120]  everything they're rotting the heat the steam the radiation and they're going off
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:33.640]  I mean I saw a statistic 91% you look this up this type of 90 say actually
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:38.360]  the headlines 90 90% of reactors are leaking of the 400 and something
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.480]  worldwide it's right at 90 it's almost 91 if you round up it's not I think it's
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:48.480]  90.7 but I don't think that's the number 90.7 the study done last year are
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:57.000]  leaking 90.7 90.7 90.7 are leaking leaking and it's like oh well you know
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.480]  what it's out in San Diego we have a leaking reactor we're just not going to
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.640]  have the alarms go off anymore they said a few months ago when it leaks the
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:12.120]  alarms scare everybody there is a leak a leak oh we're just going to turn that
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:18.520]  off now it's this this attitude by the establishment everybody just oh you know
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:22.400]  what we had dozens of GMOs and they're linked to all the sterilization the rest
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.720]  of it like we're just gonna come out with hundreds of crops now hundreds of
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:32.640]  crops it's never mind never mind the bugs need to die it's good for you
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:37.360]  never mind all the studies oh you know what Harvard does admit in their big
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:43.680]  study fluoride is brain damaging you so what hey Fukushima cause mutant
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:48.040]  butterflies French news agency oh there's nothing wrong with that I mean
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:52.440]  look what it did for spider-man get my buddy Shane Steiner was he was telling
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.840]  me the name of the movie I forget the name of he was telling the story of like
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:58.200]  yeah the guy goes and rolls in toxic waste he thinks it'll make him Superman
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:02.920]  and really he just gives leukemia in some comedy he was watching but it's not
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.960]  funny when it's the real world genetic mutations have been found in three
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:12.360]  generations of butterflies from near Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:17.880]  plant scientists said Tuesday raising fears radiation could affect other
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:22.120]  species but George Mombia who was to reduce world population is a
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:26.040]  Bilderberg minion he says it's good I mean in Coulter said they ought to think
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:31.200]  the Japanese government in Tepco even though a bunch of people drop dead you
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:34.800]  have cardiac arrest and their teeth are bleeding there's radiation deaths all
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:43.760]  over Japan you should thank them because Ann Coulter said so around 12% of pale
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:49.640]  grass blue butterflies that are exposed nuclear fallout as larva immediately
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:55.640]  after the tsunami sparked disaster had abnormalities including smaller wings
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:58:00.800]  and damaged eyes well what's wrong with that I mean we're getting massive cancer
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:04.760]  increases and deformities and debilitations the troops are what it's a
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:09.440]  14-fold increase in deformities and if you use DU and major studies but hey
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:13.840]  you know troops they're gonna have you use DU it ignites in the in the barrel
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:17.280]  but you're tough you're tough yeah you're gonna die kidney failure and lung
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:23.400]  cancer early and hey you your babies and you know we'll have horrific
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:29.120]  deformities but so what it's not patriotic to complain and butterflies
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.120]  shouldn't complain either all the kids dropping dead and Japanese schoolyards
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:37.360]  from heart failure from the radiation shouldn't worry about it they'll be

[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.360]  words there's a lot of stuff in the news
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:19.840]  I like the consumer reports article that came out a couple of weeks ago 10
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:23.240]  surprising dangers of vitamins and supplements I'd love to be able to
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:26.960]  address that there was a study that came out I think it was last week in the
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.480]  Journal of Nature Medicine chemotherapy can actually cause cancer I thought that
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:36.120]  was pretty fascinating let's see statin drugs linked with development of
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:40.320]  cataracts what else do you want to talk about here Alex there's a the sugary
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:45.640]  drink ban in in New York in the digital pill they want you to swallow that will

[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:54.360]  could be kind of interesting how about Dennis wanting us to drink more fluoride
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:57.320]  they don't like bottled water because people aren't getting enough fluoride we
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:00.680]  can talk about that too lots of stuff here we can talk about diabetes drugs
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:04.400]  raise the risk of bladder cancer statin drugs raise the risk of diabetes there
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:07.520]  tons of good stuff I want to go over all those studies but I heard your show a

[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:31.600]  rundown of documents and articles and studies and so I want to go over just at
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:36.000]  first the the you know the different vitamins and then what those
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.560]  deficiencies do different minerals what is needed what the really cool co-factors
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:45.760]  are trace elements things like that with pharmacist Ben Fuchs and then we'll get

[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:50.320]  they want to put statin drugs in the water they want to put more fluoride in
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:53.800]  food for kids even though the government admits it's killing them they're
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:57.640]  saying don't eat your yolk and eggs it's more dangerous than smoking now they
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:02.440]  want to tax that just all of this incredible nanny state meanwhile big
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:07.880]  pharma big medical notes that most illnesses in their own documents and we
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:12.160]  have them right here we're gonna go over them today that their own own documents
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:15.640]  show that they know that most diseases are vitamin mineral trace element and
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:20.520]  cofactor deficiencies they know why pancreatic cancer is way up they know
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:24.720]  why type 2 diabetes is way up they know why cancer is way up they knew the 20
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:28.080]  sodium fluoride and other forms of fluoride put in the water causes seven
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:32.080]  fold increase in bone cancer alone and reduced IQ Harvard came out last week in
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:36.800]  a decades plus long study and said combining a whole bunch of other studies
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:41.840]  and said yeah this is happening they know they know it all they know the average
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:46.000]  doctor does it they just follow what they're told but this is a real revolution
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.560]  against tyranny just like the British and I've told this story many times 300
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:54.600]  plus years ago their Academy of Sciences their Royal Academy discovered
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:59.520]  whatever was in green vegetables and fruits vitamin C later discovered but
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:03.000]  they knew if you had that your old wounds didn't open up you stayed healthy
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.120]  your teeth didn't fall out with scurvy so all the other navies the French the
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:13.040]  Spanish that they made fun of them and called them lime ease that's and they
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:17.080]  made fun of Germans because they ate kraut oh you eat kraut oh you eat
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:22.280]  limes lime ease brits are called lime ease but their navy was able to take
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:27.680]  over because of vitamin C the system knows this so they want you to have
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.920]  adulterated food with all these toxic additives hundreds of things you eat
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:39.680]  different fast foods places hundreds of fried you know confections have on record
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:44.360]  silicone in them you they can call it out of it a additive and have you eat it
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:49.120]  so here is pharmacist Ben Fuchs to run through vitamins minerals trace elements
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:53.920]  and Kiko factors that when you don't have them they know is causing these
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:57.400]  debilitating disorders and diseases pharmacist Ben Fuchs great to have you
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:01.800]  here today thank you Alex appreciate it you've got the floor start breaking it
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:04.680]  down okay yeah well it's interesting that you brought up vitamin C first
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:09.600]  because truly vitamin C is the king of vitamin it's so so fundamental to health
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:14.240]  is it's pretty much impossible to think of a disease state or a breakdown state
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:17.800]  that vitamin C doesn't improve the first thing that comes to mind vitamin C
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:20.680]  deficiency is what you said scurvy but what's really important to understand
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:25.680]  about scurvy is the fact that you can have subclinical scurvy by the time
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:29.640]  scurvy hits you're in big trouble but scurvy doesn't all of a sudden happen
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:34.600]  scurvy builds up scurvy is basically a disease where the body destroys itself
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:39.240]  the body's main connective tissue proteins called collagen without vitamin
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:44.200]  C you cannot make collagen period colleges not only the most fundamental
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:47.600]  structural protein in the body it's the most fundamental protein in the body
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:51.680]  without college without vitamin C you can't make collagen that means number
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:56.440]  one your blood vessels will not be strong ultimately your blood vessels will
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:00.760]  break down I think it's ironic how people are so focused on cholesterol and
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.720]  they're not focused on vitamin C considering one of the ways the body
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:11.120]  patches up weak blood vessels is by depositing cholesterol plaques in those
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:14.920]  blood vessels Dr. Matthias Rath has written extensively about this in a
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:19.960]  really neat book called why animals don't get heart attacks and he talks
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:23.160]  about how animals make their own vitamin C and animals don't get heart
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.080]  attacks because they make their own vitamin C and their blood vessels are
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:30.520]  strong and whole how much of one has to wonder when you see the link between
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:34.360]  vitamin C and the strength of blood vessels how much of heart disease is
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:40.800]  simply a vitamin C deficiency disease not only that but vitamin C is key a
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:45.460]  fundamental player in the immune system so if you're dealing with frequent
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:49.240]  colds if you're getting cold so hold on hold your hold your horses there
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:55.520]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs because or hold your rats because the British manual is
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:01.560]  going back up to 300 years ago said if you can't find fresh green vegetables or
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:07.520]  fruits eat rats they had discovered that whatever was in the fruit was in the
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:12.760]  intestines of ship rats and that they would then gobble the guts of rats raw
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:17.440]  so again what you just said most mammals produce it why don't we produce our own
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:20.720]  vitamin C nobody really knows why but they think it has something to do with
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:23.720]  the fact that we were eating fruits and vegetables it turns out that primes
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:27.880]  certain gorillas certain forms of gorillas human beings and guinea pigs of
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:32.080]  all critters are the only animals that don't make vitamin C squirrels make
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:35.280]  vitamin C horses make vitamin C goats make vitamin C and what's really
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:41.000]  fascinating Alex is when an animal is under stress it makes more vitamin C
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.440]  your body's key stress gland key stress handling structure the adrenal glands
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:50.640]  are very high in vitamin C and when we're under stress of any kind whether
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:54.920]  that's emotional stress like a logical stress and certainly physical stress you
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:59.760]  need more vitamin C and this gets us to the whole topic of recommended daily
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.800]  allowances the RDAs which I call the ridiculous deficiency allowance the RDA
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:08.360]  vitamin C the ridiculous deficiency allowance of vitamin C according to
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:13.960]  government is 60 milligrams of vitamin C a billy goat will make a hundred times
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:17.720]  that much vitamin C when it's under stress and it makes much more than the
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:22.320]  recommended daily allowance of vitamin C even on a daily basis so this whole
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:28.320]  idea of vitamins being used simply to treat deficiency diseases it is what
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:31.160]  gives rise to the recommended daily allowance that allows people to think
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:35.040]  well I'll just take this multiple vitamin with the RDAs and I'll be fine or I
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:38.920]  better not take more than the RDAs or I'll be in big trouble nothing speaks to
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:43.600]  this fallacy more than the idea that you only need 55 or 60 milligrams of vitamin
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.400]  C so your points well taken animals are making their own vitamin C we're not
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.240]  that means you gotta be supplementing it's gonna be very difficult to get your
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:57.560]  vitamin C out of food and in fact Alice it's very difficult to get all of the
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:02.360]  vitamins you need from food anyway for example with vitamin E the recommended
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:07.080]  daily allowance of vitamin E is 14 international units every study that's
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:10.480]  ever been done on the protective benefits of vitamin E show that you need
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:15.280]  400 international units of vitamin E and even the most vitamin E dense foods are
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:18.800]  only gonna give you about 40 international units so with vitamin E
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:23.080]  with vitamin C with the B complex you're not going to be able to get what you
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:28.360]  need from food even under the best of circumstances and this is why it's so so
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:32.760]  important to supplement if you're healthy and if you're sick it is
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:36.560]  unspeakably important to get yourself on a good nutritional supplement program
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:42.680]  so vitamin C for the connective tissue in the in the body by the way bones a lot
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:45.240]  of people are under the impression that all you need to do is take calcium for
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:51.000]  your bones well as it turns out your bones to are made of collagen and vitamin
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.840]  C is way more important for the integrity of your bones via this
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:16:00.680]  collagen connection than calcium is in fact many people call osteoporosis the
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:07.040]  disease of bone breakdown of weak bones scurvy of the bones if you have bleeding
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:12.120]  gums if you have nosebleeds if you have chronic bruising if you have any kind of
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:16.000]  heart disease issues not to mention osteoporosis and high blood pressure and
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.280]  joint issues and arthritis you want to make sure that you're getting enough
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:24.160]  vitamin C for people who are interested in skin health vitamin C can be
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:28.640]  amazingly helpful for protecting your skin from the sun in fact as it turns
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:33.960]  out using nutritional supplements are what it is way more important for
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:37.320]  protecting your skin from the sun than any toxic sunscreen you could ever put
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:42.520]  on and vitamin C is the king of sun protection vitamins for folks who are
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:46.720]  out there in the sun get some vitamin C in your body you can even use vitamin C
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:50.080]  topically as a cream and it's got wonderful benefits that way oh no I've been
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:54.240]  using this vitamin C facial cream my wife's got it's awesome and I've really
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:17:00.080]  seen it it make my skin a lot healthier and obviously beyond tangy tangerine or
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:06.040]  polymers plus things like that available at info wars dot info wars team dot com
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:10.280]  that would obviously be some of the best sources of vitamin C heck yes you're
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:13.280]  getting a thousand milligrams of vitamin C per two scoops of the beyond
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:16.560]  tangy tangerine you know here's the thing about the BTT which you mentioned
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:20.480]  the beyond tangy tangerine and the pollen burst they're liquid and the rate
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:23.480]  limiting step in how much you how much value you're going to get out of
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:26.520]  nutritional supplementation if you understand how important nutritional
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:29.880]  supplementation is and you don't have to do much reading to understand how
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:34.360]  important it is then it becomes vital to recognize it's not so much what you're
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.080]  taking in but it's what you're absorbing and if you're one of the 80
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:41.440]  million or more Americans who are dealing with digestive issues bile issues
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:46.080]  gallbladder issues gastritis pancreatitis you can take supplements but you may not
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:50.800]  be getting the value of them and you need those really big dosages from when
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:55.120]  I've read and studied from yourself and others to really have the full effect
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:58.320]  but you'd have to drink two or three containers of orange juice to get the
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:03.200]  same vitamin C in a beyond tangy tangerine scoop and then you'd be getting
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:07.200]  all of that bad overload of fruit toast that attacks the liver and everything
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:11.680]  else not to mention the pesticides as well so no orange juice has got a very
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:16.040]  small amount of vitamin C you get about 30 or 40 milligrams of vitamin C in a
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:18.760]  glass of orange juice and then of course you're exposing yourself to all that
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:22.240]  sugar and all those pesticides one of the neat things about the beyond tangy
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:26.960]  tangerine is the liquid format and so if you're dealing with digestive distress
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:29.800]  but you understand you want to get on a nutritional supplement program you
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:34.480]  understand how important it is please take a shot at liquid nutrition please
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:37.840]  take a shot at products like the beyond tangy tangerine that will well exactly
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:41.840]  but expanding on that expanding on that it's got all the other vitamins minerals
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:45.880]  trace elements cofactors together to supercharge it and I want to talk about
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:49.280]  how things work together when we come back but separately folks green leafy
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:54.560]  vegetables berries there's a lot of great ways to get vitamin C as well it's
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:58.120]  just the products at info wars team.com they're discounted or what I'm using and

[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:14.120]  linked to if you don't have them vitamin E brain health dry skin these are
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.960]  deficiencies in vitamin E vitamin E deficiencies are associated with
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:20.160]  problems with thinking with brain problems with dementia is with macular
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:24.120]  degeneration with eye disease with impotence with infertility by the way
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:27.800]  there's an infertility epidemic in this country vitamins vitamin E is known as
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.560]  the fertility vitamin the technical name for vitamin E is to cough or all which
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:35.600]  means to bear children deficiencies in vitamin E are associated with prostate
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:39.800]  disease another epidemic deficiencies in vitamin E can cause skin problems like

[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:55.800]  you have brain fog all of these are associated with B complex deficiencies
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:26:00.160]  the more sugar you eat the more deficient you're gonna be in key B
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:03.760]  vitamins there's a B vitamin that is so fundamental for brain health that Dr.
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:08.400]  Abram Hoffer wrote a book called ortho molecular psychiatry talking about
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:14.800]  treating schizophrenia successfully that's B12 that's B3 but B3 I'm sorry that's
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:18.560]  but B12 is unspeakably important if you have any digestive issues you're gonna
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:23.320]  be deficient in B12 B12 is critical for the nervous system and for the blood
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:28.000]  system and many people are deficient in B12 and don't notice it if you have any
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.200]  gastritis or low stomach acid issues you're gonna have problems absorbing B12
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:37.040]  vitamin B3 by the way is wonderful for treating social anxiety disorder or
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.440]  jitteriness or just generalized anxiety deficiencies in vitamin B3 are
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:46.320]  associated with brain fog learning disabilities cholesterol it's a more
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:52.160]  powerful cholesterol lowering drug than any statin drug simply vitamin B3
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:56.160]  niacin and you can read all about that all over it's all over the internet of
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:00.800]  niacin for lowering cholesterol if you so desire to lower cholesterol vitamin D
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:04.160]  know everybody's heard about vitamin D these days vitamin D is an immune
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:07.840]  boosting vitamin it's a social deficiencies are associated with diabetes
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:11.840]  with poor sugar control with high blood pressure with multiple sclerosis with
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:15.920]  cardiovascular disease this is like a who's who of all the diseases that we're
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:20.800]  dealing with and they're all associated with nutritional deficiencies vitamin K
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:24.160]  deficiencies associated with bruising the by the way you're not just you're not
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:28.920]  just saying this right now this is admitted and the people they put on
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:32.040]  Cuma and they won't they tell them not to eat green vegetables which has the
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:35.880]  vitamin K and then the and then the rod holes are all in their skin their skins
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:39.680]  falling off they're literally being murdered this is not your opinion they've
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:43.560]  known this for hundreds of years please continue I've some vitamin K it's
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:46.200]  absolutely correct by the way when they put you on Cuma and they tell you not to
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:50.280]  eat any vitamin K containing foods including broccoli and and cauliflower
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:53.560]  and anything that's got vitamin K in it same with vitamin E by the way after
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:57.640]  surgery they and being before surgery vitamin E is such an effective blood
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:01.080]  thinner that they'll tell you not to take vitamin E why don't they give you
[02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:04.520]  vitamin E instead of the Cuma didn't that's a whole nother or instead of the
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:09.040]  medications that's a whole nother question anyway vitamin A is associated
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:13.400]  deficiencies associated with acne I deal with acne all the time and if you want
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:17.080]  to induce acne in a patient or in a laboratory animal you got to do nothing
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:21.360]  more than remove the vitamin A out of the diet vitamin A deficiencies are
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:25.640]  associated with zinc deficiencies which is extremely common vitamin A
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:30.680]  deficiencies can be linked to psoriasis to eczema to dry skin to dry lips to
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:35.480]  cardiovascular disease depressions in the immune system digestive distress
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:40.800]  leaky gut syndrome osteoporosis deficiencies in zinc my favorite
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:45.520]  mineral associated with acne eczema poor wound repair zinc is absolutely vital

[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:30.840]  deficiency states is the more deficient you are the faster your body

[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:32.880]  know that it's boosted the overall young jevity sales period outside of what
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:39.280]  I'm doing about 35% last year because people buy what really works okay again
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:42.600]  I've been promoting this two years knew it was good didn't really you stuck my
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:45.720]  toe in though it's just another sponsorship of something I believed in
[02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:49.280]  but I wasn't when I saw with Aaron and then my family and my mother there's a
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:53.400]  triathlete everybody else and then women I know whose hair was falling out and the
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:57.760]  hair came back in I mean because it wasn't a hormonal issue it was a nutrient
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:03.440]  thing nails growing faster I don't want to get into personal stuff but I've never
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:07.560]  had a really oily skin but I get some you know blackheads and stuff just almost
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:12.600]  gone I mean really dramatic effects the only problem is I feel like I'm 18
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:16.880]  again and I'm being super aggressive I mean super aggressive where I'm just
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:20.880]  ready to get in fights almost instantly but that's most people who doesn't do
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:25.720]  that okay that's just how I am okay I've always been aggressive and going back
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:29.200]  to Ben Fuchs I know a lot of these having this mix also was boosted my
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:34.320]  testosterone naturally I'm not gonna get into how I know that's happened but
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:37.800]  men know when you've got a boosted testosterone what that how you know that
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:41.760]  that the point is this is real now can you do this through other products yet
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:45.800]  it'll cost you more but we've even looked at it it cost a lot more to try to
[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:50.240]  get everything you get in just a few young Jevity products the Alex pack with
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:54.760]  the osteo FX the essential fatty acids the beyond tangerine and the polymers

[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:12.640]  vitamins basic minerals huge dosages of vitamin C and just see what it does for
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:17.280]  you try some other company just just please in fact Ben before we get back
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:19.840]  to the minerals and vitamins we've covered about 10% of them we got a race
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.760]  now because I've heard you talk about this specifically I found that if I
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:29.840]  drink more clean water as well that that's essential and I've seen that help
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.360]  family before I even woke up to this other stuff you know I had like great
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:37.640]  uncles and people who I'd sit there watch you watch drinking coffee and tea all
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:41.200]  day and I said do you drink water and they can hardly get out of their chair
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:44.360]  they're like no and I go you're all shriveled up you're dehydrated do you
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:49.160]  know that's a diuretic I don't want to hear it you know I'm like hey listen you
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:53.320]  know I brought him literature said if you want to feel better do this and it
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:56.840]  was like a new person just off water so we're not selling water by the way we
[02:37:56.840 --> 02:38:00.200]  think you should purify it I mean but there's a lot of stuff hidden in plain
[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:05.880]  view the system knows this pharmacist Ben Fuchs how important is water please
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:11.160]  what me more water means more blood more blood means more oxygen and more
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:14.920]  nutrition and you don't need to know anything more than that especially by
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:17.720]  the way first thing in the morning first thing in the morning we tend to be
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:21.120]  dehydrated because usually we've gone to the bathroom once or twice and we
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:24.000]  haven't replaced our fluids for six or eight hours the first thing in the
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:29.600]  morning you're dehydrated when you drink more water immediately within moments
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.960]  you have more blood volume more blood volume means more nutrients and more
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:39.120]  oxygen and by the way for diabetics drinking more water is absolutely vital
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:43.320]  we know 30% of Americans are either pre-diabetic or diabetic drinking more
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:48.320]  water will dilute your blood you're a blood sugar too so if you're a garbage
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:54.800]  man it helps carry away all the trash it makes your blood more blood volume
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:58.360]  higher and it delivers more nutrients to your tissues when you have high blood
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:02.000]  pressure by the way in almost 80 to 100 million Americans are dealing with high
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:05.960]  blood pressure issues that's a sign that your body is trying to deliver more
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:10.960]  nutrients and more oxygen to the tissues simply drinking more water but by
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:14.000]  virtue of the fact that it will deliver more nutrients to your to your body's
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:18.960]  cells will allow your blood pressure to relax so drinking more water is important
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:21.840]  for brain health it's important for nutrient delivery it's important for
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:26.480]  detoxification but that doesn't make big pharma who happen to be eugenicist more
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:29.440]  money so they don't ever tell you about that at the doctor's office let's
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:33.880]  continue with the vitamins minerals trace elements cofactors race through them
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:37.880]  EFA is essential fatty acids I don't know if you could come up with one
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:41.520]  supplement that's more important than essential fatty acids they are a must
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:46.440]  have nutritional supplement they're very difficult to get out of foods because
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:51.360]  of processing deficiencies in EFA's will wreak havoc on your hormone system it
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:55.320]  will wreak havoc on your skin you cannot make collagen for your skin like
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:59.200]  with vitamin C you can't make collagen without essential fatty acids you can't
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:02.640]  make the skin's barrier so you'll be dealing with all kinds of skin problems
[02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:05.960]  you'll have joint stiffness you'll have pain in your joints you'll have poor
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:09.840]  wound repair if you're a woman you'll be dealing with PMS essential fatty acids
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:14.360]  they're almost like a cure for pre menstrual pre menstrual syndrome issues
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:17.760]  the big problem with essential fatty acids you and I have talked about this in
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:21.600]  the past is if you're deficient you'll find yourself craving fats you won't be
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:24.600]  able to stay away from the french fries that's one of the neat things about
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:29.400]  nutritional supplementation is it will allow you to wean yourself off of foods
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:34.560]  that you know are bad for you but that you cannot resist food manufacturers and
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:38.600]  and chemical companies understand that under conditions of nutritional
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:42.120]  deficiencies we won't be able to stop eating the french fries well yeah that's
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:46.840]  Aaron Aaron lost 92 pounds over a year he's now six months into keeping it off
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:52.000]  but now his muscles are building up and I mean he literally has had a total
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:56.280]  transformation the video of that is now posted info wars team.com we aired it on
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:59.400]  the radio yesterday but for people that want to see the before and after it's at
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:04.040]  info wars team.com just posted there last night
[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:09.080]  I didn't even talk about weight loss well the point is he said whenever he was craving pizza or whatever
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:14.280]  he just would take essential fatty acids go ahead that's exactly right when
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:18.440]  you're craving fats that's your body's cry for good fats your body doesn't have
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:23.080]  a cry for french fry fats but it has a loud cry for essential fatty acids and
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:27.920]  we just don't listen or understand or interpret our body's signals so once you
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:32.000]  get on EFA's the french fries are just not going to taste good to you same with
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  the ice cream and same with the potato chips and all the other fatty foods that
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:40.120]  were addicted to. Alright so continuing on one of my favorite minerals magnesium
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:44.000]  deficiencies are associated with anxiety nervousness jitteriness magnesium is
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.080]  your relaxing mineral take it before you go to bed and you'll have you'll fall
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:52.080]  asleep much easier. No I've started doing that I've started doing that because I sleep
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:55.880]  pretty good but the dogs bark the kids wake up if I take a teaspoon of this
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:00.800]  magnesium stuff that I've gotten from young Jebedee it literally I sleep like
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:05.320]  the dead where you just wake up in the morning boom you know that deep sleep it
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:09.800]  is it's a drug that they don't tell you the vitamins and minerals are the real
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:14.320]  drugs that are natural that our bodies designed to get and the pimps don't want
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:18.800]  us knowing that they sell us manipulated garbage. Well that's a
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:22.800]  brilliant point nutrients are what drugs dream they could be when a drug goes to
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:26.440]  bed at night and has a fantasy it fantasizes that it's a nutrient because
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:32.200]  nutrients give you benefits with no toxicities this is a medicinal dream come
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:37.000]  true to have benefits with no toxicities of a pharmaceutical company could find
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.120]  a drug that was as powerful as vitamin C that had all the benefits of vitamin C
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:44.400]  or any vitamin or mineral but had no side effects what would that drug be
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:47.440]  worth what would a drug be worth that could lower your blood pressure that
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:50.880]  could fight cancer that could boost your immune system that could build bone
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:55.160]  among many other things and have zero toxicity can you name a drug like that
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:42:58.040]  there's no drug on planet well what they're doing is they're coming and
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:03.600]  adding a molecule or something to the molecule and they are starting to patent
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:08.120]  fish oils and things and they're making you pay ten times more. That's right you
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:12.840]  see a cell depends on nutrients nutrients are cells support system
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:16.760]  nutrients are like the cavalry they carry the forces of life drugs are like
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:21.640]  Darth Vader drugs force a cell to do their bidding all supposedly in the
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:26.400]  interests of a greater good drugs are like communist dictated like Mao they
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:29.600]  do they suppose in the in the interest of the greater good of the body they
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:34.880]  poison the individual cells nutrients are like your family nutrients work with
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:39.280]  cells drugs work against the cell that's all you need to know right there
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:44.320]  nutrients work with the cells chemistry they are the support system for a cell
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:50.080]  drugs work against a cell from a cell perspective they are the quintessential
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:54.680]  adversary there are poisons literally they're handled by the body's poison
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:58.800]  control system and this whole idea of medications and drugs and prescriptions
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:03.640]  being handled by the poison control system in the body which is impeccable
[02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:07.080]  this whole idea of drugs being handled this way has two important implications
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:12.360]  number one it depletes your bodies of nutrients when the more prescription
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:16.120]  drugs you're taking the more nutritional deficiencies you will have
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:21.200]  nutrients that are typically not replaced and also secondly focusing on
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:25.960]  drugs makes it more likely that not all other things will get cleared out if
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:29.880]  your poison control system is overwhelmed from detoxifying your statin
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:34.000]  drugs or from detoxifying your your antibiotics or detoxifying whatever
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:39.120]  medications your immune system turns off and you get cancer you'll be depleting
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:42.560]  your body's ability to handle these chemo these cancer causing substances
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:46.760]  you're going to be depleting your impeccable poison control systems energy
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:50.280]  you'll be increasing the risks of poisons being built up and even worse
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:54.200]  you're going to be building up toxic intermediaries and this is a point that's
[02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:57.720]  missed when they taught when we hear about drugs we hear about side effects
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:01.920]  and they're hideous but even worse you're depleting your body's ability to
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:06.240]  handle poisons you're depleting your body's ability to handle cancer causing
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:10.760]  substances you're depleting your body's ability to handle substances that cause
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:14.880]  disease and you may not even make the connection between the two there's not a
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:19.240]  single drug on planet earth that can heal anything in the body they are
[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:23.920]  simply there to change test markers and to eliminate symptoms on the other hand
[02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:29.240]  by using nutritional supplements you can literally reverse the disease process
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:32.920]  that's the beauty of good nutrition and that's why I'm a nutritional pharmacist
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:38.000]  Alex that's why I practice nutrition instead of dispensing toxic
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:43.640]  pharmaceutical drugs because nutrients are the quintessential premier medicines
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:48.520]  they are the very definition of what a medicine should be with no toxicity
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:53.760]  all right continuing here let's get into we've gotten into magnesium we should
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:57.560]  get it we've gotten into fatty acids let's get into selenium then let's get
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:01.240]  into other minerals cofactors and some of the things from your research and
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:06.360]  other major studies some of the other you know things that have been found that
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:10.080]  really supercharged things and help your body use all of these things in
[02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:15.200]  concert selenium is unbelievably important for the bodies detox system we
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:19.160]  just talked about the poison control system there's a there's a chemical in
[02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:22.360]  the body called glutathione some of you may have some of your listeners may
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:26.840]  have heard of glutathione glutathione is your master cancer fighter it's your
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:32.120]  master antioxidant your master detoxification element and it runs on a
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:36.280]  little selenium battery it's one of the neat things about minerals is they function
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:40.680]  electromagnetically as batteries that charge enzymes and one of the most
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:45.280]  important enzymes that selenium charges is glutathione without selenium you can't
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:49.400]  make this master cancer fighter selenium is also an important component in
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:53.640]  thyroid health with your hypothyroid you definitely want to think about getting
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:57.640]  on selenium selenium deficiency is associated with muscle weakness it's
[02:46:57.640 --> 02:47:01.160]  associated with fatigue it's associated with joint disease selenium
[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:05.640]  deficiency can cause miscarriages and birth defects and perhaps most
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:10.080]  importantly selenium deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:14.120]  which is the leading killer in this country and around the world and you
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:18.120]  don't need very much selenium just the amount of selenium that would fit on a
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:22.600]  couple of pinheads is all you need is a daily dose to assure that you don't
[02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:26.720]  suffer from these deficiency diseases that's a tiny tiny little bit of this
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:30.560]  very important substance selenium and selenium is one that you take too much
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:33.760]  of and that's why when you're taking when you're using a nutritional supplement
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:36.960]  program something like the beyond tangy tangerine you don't have to concern
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:41.040]  yourself with the doses as much because the formulators have taken care of those
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:44.240]  dosages for you all right let's talk about this and then I'm going to go into
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:49.080]  some of the current news items that you wanted to mention and others other key
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:52.960]  cofactors and things like what you were just mentioning but why are they
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:58.800]  attacking eggs and even whey protein I guess they don't want us healthy LA
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:04.800]  time says eating whole eggs is dangerous is smoking but then our brain is
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:08.680]  mainly made out of these good cholesterol is it true that that that we
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:12.880]  should be on a low-fat diet well even Ansel Keys is what was the father of the
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:17.120]  of the so-called fat and cholesterol hypothesis has come out saying that we've
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:21.640]  known all along that dietary cholesterol has nothing to do with the amount of
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:24.720]  cholesterol in your body this whole thing on eggs I'm gonna talk about this on my
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:28.840]  program tomorrow this whole thing on eggs is absolutely tragic if anybody
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:33.880]  listens to this silliness it's coming out of this study in Canada is it's very
[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:37.560]  very unfortunate first of all if you look at the numbers you got to be very
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:40.480]  careful with how the press reports things if you look at the numbers right
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:45.480]  out of the study as it turns out people who ate the the highest amount of eggs
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:50.840]  had exactly the same cholesterol even higher cholesterol level levels than
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:56.400]  people who ate less eggs so this whole idea of eating egg yolks and causing
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:01.640]  cancer this is just a bunch of who we the egg yolk is nature's richest source of
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:05.960]  nutrients next to human mother's milk and not in the white the the nutrients
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:08.880]  are not in the white when it comes to an egg they're in the yolk and I'm talking
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:13.560]  vitamin a I'm talking to be complex I'm talking vitamin K I'm talking essential
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:18.520]  fatty acids magnesium calcium vitamin D copper iron manganese selenium zinc
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:21.960]  these are all well they even tell people that have epilepsy eat more eggs
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:26.280]  because it's been associated with helping the brain I mean this is known so
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:30.760]  why are they I mean if they're gonna put taxes on cigarettes I guess you now
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:36.440]  they're saying eggs are bad Bloomberg wants to tax salt he wants to tax he
[02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:41.280]  wants to tax soft drinks again making themselves the good guys while
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:45.000]  ignoring all the real problems are they doing that knowing they're killing us
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:50.240]  with an anti-state so that they can selectively take control and but yeah
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:53.280]  you know that's a that's a point that's well taken but you know what we got to
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:56.840]  take the control back this idea of nutritional supplementation is one of
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:50:01.240]  the best ways that you can take charge of your health and not depend on the
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:05.680]  doctor and Alex you what's gonna happen if we end up with this Obamacare thing
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:11.400]  with managed care government mandated managed care government mandated HMOs
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:15.720]  this is going to be an unmitigated health disaster our best protection is
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:19.160]  to understand how to use nutritional supplementation and by the way as far
[02:50:19.160 --> 02:50:24.600]  as this study goes on egg yolks look to see who the scientists who came up with
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:28.200]  this study Dr. David Spence the Canadian authors David Spence and David Jenkins
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:35.200]  and Jean Dabignan see who these guys get paid for and guess who you will find is
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:41.480]  writing the checks AstraZeneca and the cholesterol the drug companies sure they
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:46.480]  want to say it's the cholesterol that's bad not imbalances in the body and at
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:50.840]  the same time they want to put statins in the water even of children so they're
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:55.160]  creating this world where the building blocks of our body are listed as evil
[02:50:55.160 --> 02:50:59.280]  so they can tax them and regulate them and control them not letting us have
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:05.240]  access to it the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:09.560]  the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[02:51:09.560 --> 02:51:13.840]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[02:51:13.840 --> 02:51:18.440]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers
[02:51:18.440 --> 02:51:22.200]  out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:26.320]  is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of
[02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:30.560]  foods for me foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases eat
[02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:34.280]  foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your supply I recently

[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:10.360]  electrical power folks with what's been going on in this country I don't have to
[02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:13.720]  tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is that's in the
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:17.480]  mainstream news every day millions of people have lost their power in the
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:21.280]  last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing
[02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:25.560]  the grid beyond its capacity I've always said that every family needs to be
[02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:29.600]  ready for blackouts and if you don't have a backup system in place I've got a
[02:53:29.600 --> 02:53:33.400]  great opportunity for you right now our good friends at solutions from science
[02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:38.360]  are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit in fact I
[02:53:38.360 --> 02:53:42.360]  think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make it's literally thousands of
[02:53:42.360 --> 02:53:46.560]  dollars in savings remember these backup systems don't need gas because they're
[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:50.840]  solar-powered that means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise in full
[02:53:50.840 --> 02:53:56.000]  wars listeners can get all the details at beat the blackouts.com that's beat
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:59.560]  the blackouts.com
[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:13.520]  No they don't want us to know that they've produced artificial food designed to
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:18.440]  make us sick and mentally ill they don't want you to know if you can't sleep
[02:54:18.440 --> 02:54:25.480]  it's magnesium they got a deadly class 3 narcotic for you they don't want you to

[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:33.320]  you got zits all over the place they don't want you to know any of this stuff
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:37.840]  by the way a Paul Watson's article is very powerful it's up at info wars.com
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:42.880]  and prismplanner.com DHS classifies new ammo purchases following controversy as
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:48.600]  they buy even more than 1.4 billion and and all these different agencies are

[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:09.440]  are illegal to use in war yep hollow point bullets are too expensive for
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:16.720]  practice uses right hollow points are for our heads and torso and arms and
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:22.960]  legs yeah I mean these are these are bullets for us 1.4 billion bullets
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:26.680]  then I just had to ask you because you're a smart guy what is your take on
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:31.360]  armored pill boxes checkpoints getting set up and 1.4 plus billion rounds of
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:35.600]  ammo for us I mean what are these criminal lunatics planning well you know
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:39.840]  it gets to what you were saying before before we went to the break we are at
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:43.960]  risk of losing our individual freedoms because we're not paying attention and
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:48.040]  we've abdicated our personal responsibility when it comes to our
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:52.400]  health nothing is more dramatic than this idea of medicalizing everything I
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:55.720]  the articles we were taught we were going to talk about should doctors treat
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:59.720]  lack of exercise as a medical condition a little bit of overdrive to get into
[02:55:59.720 --> 02:56:02.520]  that but but yeah I mean here's my frustration I've seen it work with
[02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:06.640]  family Aaron Dykes I lost 40 pounds and then did and then just I'm not in the
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:10.280]  habit of taking stuff all day so I quit doing it now I'm back on it even when I
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:16.640]  know it's real myself I'm so weak I can't fully commit then well you know
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:20.080]  what you can't fully commit until you do because once you do you would not want
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:23.360]  to once you do commit you're not going to be well want to be without your
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:27.520]  beyond tangy tangerine your nutritional supplements and I take them once or
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:30.320]  twice today you're supposed to take them you know three four times a day my
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:34.120]  point is I've already seen dramatic results I just can't believe how real
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:38.920]  this is and how hidden in plain view like drink more water you know right oh
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:42.200]  here's another one just breathing one of the most powerful ways to lower your
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:46.440]  blood blood pressure is to practice diaphragmatic breathing simple oxygen
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:50.440]  can drop your blood pressure and get you off your anti-hypertensive drugs your
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:54.200]  calcium channel blockers and your beta blockers and by the way Alex among the
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:58.280]  deadliest drugs of all and there's a lot of deadly drugs are these anti-hypertensive
[02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:02.520]  drugs now they want to give you the poly pill which is a combination of
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:06.520]  different anti three or four anti-hypertensive drugs that you take in
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:10.400]  one pill that's what I wanted to ask you next and your body's doing all this
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:14.080]  hyper stuff to keep you alive you block it you end up killing yourself what do
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:17.760]  you make of all the big pharma documents in like five companies the last month
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:21.640]  coming out where they know their drugs are killing us and have no benefit and
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:25.840]  are laughing at us I mean they're so evil have you heard about propitia the
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:30.560]  baldness drug now yes tell us propitia is the baldness drug and now people are
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:34.280]  surprised that Merck has been hiding the the side effects the company makes
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:37.200]  propitia has been hiding all the side effects that are associated with this
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:40.720]  but the bottom line here here is we shouldn't be surprised because the
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:46.280]  mechanism of drugs is to block things in the body that's why you have anti
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:52.440]  hypertensives that the MMR shot was actually giving people the measles
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:56.960]  mumps and rubella and they were like ha ha ha we'll get more money as we spread
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:01.640]  the measles mumps and rubella I mean it's just the diabolical nature it is
[02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:05.400]  diabolical that's exactly right you're playing with the body's chemistry if
[02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:10.440]  you're on a prescription drug Alex your number one health objective needs to be
[02:58:10.440 --> 02:58:13.720]  to figure out how to get off that prescription drug if you're on a
[02:58:13.720 --> 02:58:17.200]  prescription drug it's not a matter of losing weight it's not a matter of going
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:21.080]  to the gym it's not a matter of eating better it's a matter of getting off that
[02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:24.520]  prescription drug because it's killing you and nutritional supplementation is
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:28.160]  your best strategy yeah again cuz supplements work with the body we're
[02:58:28.160 --> 02:58:32.200]  designed for those drugs go like you said Darth Vader put a gun to your head
[02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:37.640]  whereas the natural stuff just works with the body as a family symbiotic
[02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:41.440]  incredible infowars team dot-com
[02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:51.920]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting world-wide it's Alex Jones
[02:58:54.840 --> 02:59:00.920]  hi ladies and gentlemen we have now come back and reached our tail this is
[02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:04.360]  the fourth hour we're starting we're live at retransmission coming up
[02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:09.320]  armistice Ben Fuchs was working with us over an info wars team calm went through
[02:59:09.320 --> 02:59:12.800]  a lot of the vitamins and minerals and known illnesses and diseases that are
[02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:18.040]  triggered by lack of that but there's no way these medical doctors are that
[02:59:18.040 --> 02:59:21.200]  stupid that when they see people coming in with rod holes and their skin
[02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:25.600]  falling off they don't ask hey do you eat leafy vegetables and fruits are you
[02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:30.080]  taking any vitamin C no instead they got some you know antibiotic for them
[02:59:30.080 --> 02:59:33.680]  because they got rod holes or whatever or if you've got you know the acne
[02:59:33.680 --> 02:59:36.600]  everywhere they don't tell you hey it's this vitamin this mineral they got a
[02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:40.760]  bunch of topical stuff for you and acids to dry out your skin I mean that's a
[02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:46.000]  perfect example right there I know you're really a big skin expert finishing up
[02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:49.600]  with some of the news articles you wanted to hit fluoride I want to talk
[02:59:49.600 --> 02:59:53.240]  about this Dennis who's telling us the bottle water might be bad for kids
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:57.480]  teeth because it doesn't have fluoride and I love how the mainstream media just
[02:59:57.480 --> 03:00:02.880]  jumped all over this if you look at any website the government's being forced
[03:00:02.880 --> 03:00:06.400]  to take it out of the water admitting it's deadly but have one dentist come
[03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:10.320]  out oh they can all act like it's good because he says so well fluoride
[03:00:10.320 --> 03:00:15.840]  singularly upsets the brain especially a gland in the brain called the pineal
[03:00:15.840 --> 03:00:19.920]  gland which is which it takes up fluoride faster than any other tissue in the
[03:00:19.920 --> 03:00:24.400]  body the pineal gland is the the center of melatonin production of serotonin
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:27.560]  production and we know that serotonin drugs are the best-selling drugs in the
[03:00:27.560 --> 03:00:33.200]  world the pineal gland is responsible for how we perceive reality itself and it
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:39.080]  is singularly dependent on minerals like iodine by the way fluoride iodine
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:42.800]  supplementation is one of the best ways to protect yourself from fluoride for
[03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:45.920]  people who are stuck drinking tap water which I definitely don't recommend but
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:49.440]  if you're stuck drinking it make sure that you're all using iodine
[03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:53.640]  supplementation the pineal gland loves iodine it will take in fluoride under
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:59.520]  iodine under iodine deficiency states and this whole idea of bottle water is
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:02.760]  another problem too I mean our only option really is bottled water but
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:07.040]  there are plasticizers in bottles that are also a big problem some of them
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:10.800]  act like estrogen if you're stuck drinking bottled water and because you
[03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:13.800]  don't want to drink tap water make sure that you're using nutritional
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:16.840]  supplements that will protect you from some of those some of the toxicity
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:21.720]  associated with these bottle water ingredients essential ingredients in the
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:25.880]  bottles of bottled water essential fatty acids are very very important in this
[03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:31.600]  regard what bill or social fatty acids helps block or take away the BPA it'll
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:35.320]  help protect your estrogen your hormone system from some of the estrogen
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:39.360]  mimicking effects of BPA because if you got a lot of the good stuff it'll bond
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:43.120]  instead of your body being desperate I mean that's like the thyroid right it'll
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:48.360]  pick up the toxic stuff if you don't have the iodine right exactly for
[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:51.680]  folks worried about radioactivity for folks worried about heavy metals when
[03:01:51.680 --> 03:01:55.960]  you give yourself the good stuff your body will selectively take that in as
[03:01:55.960 --> 03:01:59.360]  far as this biz phenol a and some of the hardners that they use in plastics that
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:02.280]  act like estrogen mimics and it's other things too cosmetics can act like
[03:02:02.280 --> 03:02:05.440]  astrogen estrogen mimics preservatives can act like estrogen mimics
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:09.360]  fragrances and perfumes can mimic estrogen to protect yourself from
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:12.600]  estrogen mimics you want to use essential fatty acids you want to use
[03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:16.960]  foods like broccoli and cauliflower the cruciferous vegetables and you want to
[03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:21.720]  make sure you're getting enough iodine this is so so important I don't hear
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:25.600]  anybody talking about the importance of iodine for protection against excess
[03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:29.400]  estrogen for protection of the pineal gland for protection of the breast tissue
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:32.880]  for protection of the adrenal glands people will tell you doctors will tell
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:37.360]  you oh you get enough iodine from iodine salt not true and it's even the wrong
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:41.680]  kind of iodine as well well I like modifilin which is an
[03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:45.080]  engemity product but we have it in foreshop.com I talked a lot of folks I
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:49.720]  really like the way this makes me feel and what it's doing for me a lot of
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:54.000]  folks I know well Weldon Weldon it was the one that you first turned me on to
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:57.040]  it and I asked a bunch of different doctors and scientists about it I really
[03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:02.200]  like the brown seaweed from New Zealand myself. Seaweed is amazing amazing stuff
[03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:05.880]  if you can the more seaweed you eat the better of course we know the oceans are
[03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:10.200]  pretty toxic but seaweed actually has an ability to sequester some of the toxins
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:13.800]  that are found in in ocean water so eating seaweed is not only a great way to
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:17.200]  get iodine it's a wonderful source of iodine it's a great source of B vitamins
[03:03:17.200 --> 03:03:20.760]  it's a great source of protein so it's almost a key later it's helping drag
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:24.200]  stuff out of your body that's exactly right it's all right listen we're gonna
[03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:28.200]  post this interview that was live at info wars team.com if you missed any of
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:32.000]  it out there and Aaron Dyke's testimony with the foreign after it's up at
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:36.200]  info wars team.com thank you so much pharmacist Ben Fuchs great job
[03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:44.440]  retransmission starts now
