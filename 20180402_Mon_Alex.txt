[00:00.000 --> 00:17.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[00:17.440 --> 00:26.280]  does he live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones I
[00:26.280 --> 00:35.160]  remember the year was 1988 because I was a freshman in high school and I
[00:35.160 --> 00:40.120]  remember sitting there while my dad was getting the tires rotated on his car
[00:40.120 --> 00:48.960]  Saturday morning still remember it reading on the front page of USA Today
[00:48.960 --> 00:55.680]  that's a good my memory is of past things it's not photographic today I've
[00:55.680 --> 01:01.080]  lost that ability the last five ten years but I remember reading the article
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.840]  while I sat there for 30 minutes while they were rotating the tires about how
[01:06.840 --> 01:17.680]  scientists involved with the cell phone companies were telling folks that we're
[01:17.680 --> 01:23.040]  about to deploy it that it shouldn't be deployed and that if cell phone type
[01:23.040 --> 01:27.200]  systems were deployed they should be in a box on the back of the car the back of
[01:27.200 --> 01:33.400]  the truck and then run up through a wire to a handheld phone because they were
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.520]  explaining that the amount of radiation dissipated massively out from the size
[01:38.520 --> 01:41.760]  of the antenna and it varies the type of radiation but I later talked to
[01:41.760 --> 01:45.480]  engineers about it they confirmed that with with most forms of radiation
[01:45.480 --> 01:51.320]  microwave radiation cell phone tower type stuff UHF VHF for TV AM radio all
[01:51.320 --> 01:57.160]  of it it it does hurt your body an antenna will burn you even if it's a
[01:57.160 --> 02:03.240]  hundred watts up close if you grab it will burn you so as you go out from the
[02:03.240 --> 02:10.320]  antenna each length of the antenna the radiation as a rule cuts by half I'm no
[02:10.320 --> 02:15.840]  engineer that's just what the engineers break down so they knew back then in
[02:15.840 --> 02:23.120]  1988 that remember the big block cell phones that you hold up to your head
[02:23.120 --> 02:34.280]  we're giving rats and studies big fat juicy tumors and so I remember years
[02:34.280 --> 02:37.200]  later in high school telling some of the more wealthy kids I knew that had
[02:37.200 --> 02:40.960]  cell phones in their cars I said you know you shouldn't have it under your
[02:40.960 --> 02:45.760]  seat the transmitter that'll give you testicular cancer because there were
[02:45.760 --> 02:49.400]  studies on that and people like oh shut up Alex people always thought I was
[02:49.400 --> 02:54.520]  showing off because I was a reader they're like you're not like a bookworm
[02:54.520 --> 02:59.880]  you're like a jock why is it jock know about stuff like this like it's kind of
[02:59.880 --> 03:04.760]  like in the movie idiocracy they go what's this guy a crazy person what is
[03:04.760 --> 03:18.400]  he a fag because he knows how to read look we got one here that can read so when
[03:18.400 --> 03:24.720]  I see another article today can cell phones cause cancer and then you read
[03:24.720 --> 03:29.720]  the article because it's always the same formula at CBS news one two three four
[03:29.720 --> 03:33.080]  five six seven eight paragraphs later they go absolute clear evidence
[03:33.080 --> 03:39.320]  absolutely does and it says top researchers top scientists you know US
[03:39.320 --> 03:48.400]  government you name it but they always say that it's always just been discovered
[03:48.400 --> 03:54.680]  so that as massive new brain tumors develop and other tumors they can go
[03:54.680 --> 04:01.840]  oh we just found out sorry we just found out cigarettes were bad in the 70s they
[04:01.840 --> 04:07.960]  had studies 200 years ago in the Royal Society of Medicine in the UK now UK then
[04:07.960 --> 04:14.440]  England they know all this stuff they knew a thousand years ago that you
[04:14.440 --> 04:17.720]  ground up a little bit of fluoride crystals and put it in people's drinks
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.360]  it would make them calm docile and stupid Hitler and Stalin put it in the
[04:22.360 --> 04:25.800]  water supplies in the forced labor camps that's in Pulitzer prize winning books
[04:25.800 --> 04:30.240]  then they do it to us here I go hey that's dangerous they go shut up some
[04:30.240 --> 04:36.000]  kind of weirdo you think you can read huh so the reason I led the broadcast with
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.200]  this today is that with the 5g rollout it is way beyond all of that and we're
[04:42.200 --> 04:45.880]  all just killing ourselves and that's why I told even before I saw these
[04:45.880 --> 04:50.480]  articles this morning I told my wife I said I went I had the whole house wired
[04:50.480 --> 04:54.080]  where it actually wired into the computers everybody keeps putting
[04:54.080 --> 04:57.080]  wireless them without asking me and I said we're getting all this stuff out
[04:57.080 --> 05:02.600]  period it's happening now we need to fund this operation ladies and gentlemen
[05:02.600 --> 05:06.520]  and I make it really easy we went out and looked at what the top new tropics
[05:06.520 --> 05:10.800]  or brain pills are that are healthy for energy stamina mental clarity you name
[05:10.800 --> 05:15.640]  it and we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas
[05:15.640 --> 05:18.600]  out there it's very simple we went out and look what is the top what is the
[05:18.600 --> 05:21.400]  best we'll just put even more product in we'll make it better leading
[05:21.400 --> 05:25.800]  competitors but two dollars a product in it sell it for 60 bucks we put $10 in
[05:25.800 --> 05:31.520]  it and sell it for 30 bucks it's $19.95 right now so you get an incredible top
[05:31.520 --> 05:37.000]  of the line new tropic for $19.95 believe me we're selling it for $35 on average
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.720]  we need that 15-20 bucks we make to fund this operation in the face the global
[05:40.720 --> 05:44.280]  thrust of it but I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two
[05:44.280 --> 05:48.600]  weeks I want to show it all out before the big supply comes in and I want
[05:48.600 --> 05:52.680]  people that haven't tried brain force to try it and find out why it's got 6,000
[05:52.680 --> 05:57.920]  plus five-star reviews it's amazing infowarstore.com infowarslife.com or
[05:57.920 --> 06:01.600]  triple-a 2533139
[06:02.440 --> 06:09.160]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[06:09.160 --> 06:12.800]  lines of the info war
[06:15.720 --> 06:22.480]  thank you so much for joining us on this Monday hard to believe April 2nd
[06:22.480 --> 06:30.040]  2018 time is flying by let me just do this here to give me an idea of how
[06:30.040 --> 06:34.840]  incredible the news and information is I'm sure most of you already know they
[06:34.840 --> 06:39.560]  have a whole flotilla of articles out today where they say they just discovered
[06:39.560 --> 06:45.760]  that cell phone radiation gives you brain tumors and that if you keep the
[06:45.760 --> 06:48.680]  phones near you and other parts of your body even though you think they're off
[06:48.680 --> 06:53.240]  they're always sending back data back and forth as part of their GPS
[06:53.240 --> 06:58.000]  triangulation system and that they're associated with the stick your cancer
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.600]  brain tumors you name it headline can cell phones cause cancer and the downer
[07:03.600 --> 07:06.800]  it says they say they found clear evidence of the phone radiation cost
[07:06.800 --> 07:12.000]  tumors and the hearts of rats which were some of the tumors and people and then
[07:12.000 --> 07:19.400]  it just goes on from there also the heart is extremely electrochemical just
[07:19.400 --> 07:22.360]  like the brain that's why it's particularly bad for the heart and the
[07:22.360 --> 07:27.360]  brain to be associated with cell phone radiation but now the 5g is
[07:27.360 --> 07:32.600]  magnitude stronger so we're going to cover that today now that's just one
[07:32.600 --> 07:40.920]  article in this technological dystopia we're entering no more secrets new mind
[07:40.920 --> 07:44.240]  reading machines can translate your thoughts and display them in text
[07:44.240 --> 07:52.640]  instantly daily mail so it's all here ladies and gentlemen DNA tests for IQ
[07:52.640 --> 07:56.160]  are coming but it might not be smart to take them yeah and then who interprets
[07:56.160 --> 08:02.840]  them let's continue they love Christmas Google refuses to recognize Easter
[08:02.840 --> 08:07.440]  first Apple now Google this is a unified operation but they recognize
[08:07.440 --> 08:12.280]  Muhammad they recognize Buddhist they recognize all these communist officials
[08:12.280 --> 08:15.760]  in the little doodle that's the top of the Google homepage what do Google's
[08:15.760 --> 08:22.000]  best known for Paul Watson pointed this out and James Wood responded back
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.400]  saying they love Christmas plain and simple we're gonna look at that because
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.440]  remember the Pope came out last week and said there is no hell and complete
[08:33.440 --> 08:38.880]  contravention of the Old and New Testament and all the passages that say
[08:38.880 --> 08:42.880]  that anybody tells you there isn't a hell they're the devil but he also says
[08:42.880 --> 08:49.920]  he's nauseous he becomes nauseous whenever he hears about Europe having
[08:49.920 --> 08:59.000]  Christian roots he says we must accept Islam he is a known Marxist he is a
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  completely false Pope but that's what the globalist did the Rockefellers John
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.760]  D Rockefeller funded the World Council of Churches the National Council of
[09:06.760 --> 09:11.560]  Churches and they ran communist operatives and others for the seminary and
[09:11.560 --> 09:17.000]  so you go to your old ornate church and by successive approximation they pull
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.960]  the crosses out they don't talk about Christ they take up your collection
[09:21.960 --> 09:24.440]  plate for the Methodist churches and it goes the Bill and Melinda Gates
[09:24.440 --> 09:29.520]  Foundation and the people just sit there and they take it this is how they've
[09:29.520 --> 09:36.240]  taken over the churches they're not churches they're dens of devils dens
[09:36.240 --> 09:40.760]  of devils but then you go there and there are people seeking God so you might
[09:40.760 --> 09:46.400]  even feel kind of the spirit of good in the church but also spirit of bad
[09:46.400 --> 09:50.640]  because it's a battleground and you've got the big spiders the big serpents up
[09:50.640 --> 09:57.240]  there in the pulp it's praying on those seeking God of course but before you get
[09:57.240 --> 10:03.680]  to Christ there'll be a priest class of serpents just that's what the devil is
[10:03.680 --> 10:09.240]  there to get in front of you that's why Christ said get behind me Methodist
[10:09.240 --> 10:17.440]  church get behind me Vatican get behind me Satan that's what it is ladies and
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.320]  gentlemen pure and simple the Pope is a devil worshiper the Pope is someone on
[10:23.320 --> 10:28.360]  record whose aid to camp is been indicted and arrested for kidnapping over a
[10:28.360 --> 10:33.560]  hundred little boys and supplying them the Pope used pedophilia and the church
[10:33.560 --> 10:42.280]  to remove the other Pope and send him to Gandalf Castle Gandalfus and there is a
[10:42.280 --> 10:46.920]  special place in hell for people that are into this type of behavior ladies and
[10:46.920 --> 10:50.720]  gentlemen but again by successful approximation open your borders world
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.600]  government is good we need a world government church the family is bad oh
[10:55.600 --> 11:03.120]  open your borders open your borders open your borders and suddenly the leftist
[11:03.120 --> 11:08.240]  media that hated the Catholic Church because it was conservative and it had
[11:08.240 --> 11:11.360]  a lot of values they didn't like it's always had problems obviously any big
[11:11.360 --> 11:16.600]  institution does but now you can stick a fork in it and say this is the fall of
[11:16.600 --> 11:23.360]  the Vatican see I have just hit only two articles three articles and it just
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.720]  gets insane I've got hundreds that are all just as bombshell we're going to
[11:27.720 --> 11:37.640]  cover today London murder rate beats New York as stabbing surges highest crime
[11:37.640 --> 11:41.920]  rate in the world of any industrialized nation city for stabbings and
[11:41.920 --> 11:52.160]  muggings London is incredibly dangerous I was just there a few years ago got out
[11:52.160 --> 11:55.560]  of restaurant about 10 trying to get a cab out for just a few minutes and had
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.680]  multiple gangs of people come over but we were a couple big guys and they just
[11:59.680 --> 12:09.720]  kind of smarted off and wandered off but it is something else and don't worry
[12:09.720 --> 12:15.560]  though all the acid attacks up to seven a day all the rest of it a Q con drives
[12:15.560 --> 12:21.360]  to cover it up he says it's the safest place in the world in fact we have a
[12:21.360 --> 12:28.680]  clip of that let's such you that clip up that's just another one of the articles
[12:28.680 --> 12:35.640]  like let's let's let's hear from mr. Khan the Islamist mayor of London London
[12:35.640 --> 12:40.600]  is the safest global city the world are one of the safest cities in the world
[12:40.600 --> 12:45.120]  my thoughts are with the family of a Keith Palmer the police officer who
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.840]  tragically lost his life yesterday keeping our city and keeping Londoners
[12:48.840 --> 12:53.960]  safe and one of the reasons I can say that London is the safest global city
[12:53.960 --> 12:57.160]  in the world and one of the safest cities in the world is because there
[12:57.160 --> 13:01.360]  were literally tens and thousands of Keith Palmer's keeping our city safe
[13:01.360 --> 13:05.840]  working with members of the public who provide intelligence and information
[13:05.840 --> 13:12.040]  working with our security services that is a year ago last March when they had a
[13:12.040 --> 13:16.320]  bunch of bombings and stabbings so it's one of those dangerous cities in the
[13:16.320 --> 13:20.320]  world the police cover up the crime they won't respond when Islamists are
[13:20.320 --> 13:23.400]  kidnapping little girls or selling them into sex slavery or chopping their
[13:23.400 --> 13:27.480]  bodies up and reselling them at the kebab shops that's their favorite
[13:27.480 --> 13:37.480]  fronts you can't make this up it's the worst rate of murder and stabbing since
[13:37.480 --> 13:46.840]  1800 under Sadiq Khan he just told you everything's fine meanwhile the DNC
[13:46.840 --> 13:52.200]  chair calls for repeal of the Second Amendment we've got that video they've
[13:52.200 --> 13:58.960]  also tweeted that out and I've noticed that on Twitter especially the bots come
[13:58.960 --> 14:05.080]  to my real Alex Jones on Twitter and say oh you're a cook nobody wants your
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.760]  guns only wants to fulfill your second amendment it's gaslighting it's
[14:09.760 --> 14:18.200]  unbelievable so that is just a small small small smattering of what we're
[14:18.200 --> 14:23.600]  gonna be covering Kim Jong-un publicly had a concert for what he sends you to
[14:23.600 --> 14:26.840]  force labor camp or execute you for if he catches you listening to it
[14:26.840 --> 14:31.600]  chow korean pop music but what's good for the communist leader is not good the
[14:31.600 --> 14:34.920]  general public that's what we have lots of spoiled brats living in a lap of
[14:34.920 --> 14:37.880]  luxury calling for communism here because they think they'll be the commas
[14:37.880 --> 14:43.080]  ours they'll be the ones in charge and that's what we're facing right now it's
[14:43.080 --> 14:50.400]  all coming up today Trump says no more DACA deal must go nuclear as refugee
[14:50.400 --> 14:56.440]  caravan approaches funded out of Honduras by the UN it's like Soros
[14:56.440 --> 15:03.400]  floods Europe with his zodiac boats coming in so they're priming the pump
[15:03.400 --> 15:07.800]  Mexico's open its borders saying come on through as long as you don't stay go

[19:09.120 --> 19:13.920]  nature to detoxify the body that's why I'm introducing z-shield toxic metal and
[19:13.920 --> 19:19.280]  chemical defense support it's made in the USA it's filled with known compounds
[19:19.280 --> 19:22.800]  from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and
[19:22.800 --> 19:27.360]  it supports the info war it is a classical 360 win this is the formula

[19:56.040 --> 20:01.360]  it's time to change our bodies with z-shield infowarslife.com
[20:01.360 --> 20:08.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:21.040 --> 20:26.800]  coming to you from the former united states of america from deep in the heart
[20:26.800 --> 20:31.600]  of texas it's alex jones
[20:37.480 --> 20:48.160]  you know I don't want to say I got intimidated but in hindsight I kind of
[20:48.160 --> 20:54.920]  suspended my own research just because up front
[20:54.920 --> 21:04.560]  I wanted to believe that the tragic mass shooting a month and a half ago in
[21:04.560 --> 21:08.200]  florida was completely organic I mean we know the police stood down at the
[21:08.200 --> 21:11.920]  school we know they stood down before we know he was in government care and on
[21:11.920 --> 21:15.200]  psychotropic drugs from the health department it's always the same story
[21:15.200 --> 21:22.160]  so it was a false flag in that there was a stand-down and if you know somebody's
[21:22.160 --> 21:24.800]  gonna do something and you don't do anything about it that makes you an
[21:24.800 --> 21:30.840]  accomplice so there's a spectrum of false flags from benign neglect to kind
[21:30.840 --> 21:36.560]  of opening the door and standing down to carrying out a mass shooting yourself
[21:36.560 --> 21:40.120]  and then framing a patsy who conveniently kills themselves there's a
[21:40.120 --> 21:44.120]  spectrum of those and we know governments throughout history have
[21:44.120 --> 21:47.120]  staged false flags that's why the term false flag is in the encyclopedia
[21:47.120 --> 21:52.440]  Britannica that's why it's taught in history books I repopularized the term
[21:52.440 --> 21:59.960]  the last 20 years and there's a lot of declassified examples of false flags
[21:59.960 --> 22:06.320]  there's a Wikipedia page of on false flags that doesn't mean every event so
[22:06.320 --> 22:10.920]  false flag and I think people died and I don't think David Hogs a crisis actor
[22:10.920 --> 22:15.040]  from California he went so far as to go check and get the yearbook from the year
[22:15.040 --> 22:24.800]  before and there he is a sophomore a junior now a senior but the video and I
[22:24.800 --> 22:28.360]  found a bunch of these this weekend I saw these last week we had an article
[22:28.360 --> 22:33.040]  about it headline David Hogg caught lying about what happened at the shooting
[22:33.040 --> 22:40.560]  and I went and watched him this weekend not just a little clips but the longer
[22:40.560 --> 22:49.080]  interviews they were part of and so it's not a context where he says I was at
[22:49.080 --> 22:53.080]  home when the shooting happened so I got on my bike and rode to the school to
[22:53.080 --> 23:01.080]  get as many interviews as I could we'll play it in a moment and then he's in all
[23:01.080 --> 23:10.080]  these other interviews saying I was at the school in the class when the shooting
[23:10.080 --> 23:17.640]  started and I was with the teacher so we heard the shots we closed the door and
[23:17.640 --> 23:20.640]  then other things where he talked about where he was with the shooting started so
[23:20.640 --> 23:24.640]  we got the closet and they conduct interviews in a closet and I'm like
[23:24.640 --> 23:28.840]  there's no way you're three miles away and then you're there and there's a
[23:28.840 --> 23:34.720]  shooting here in class when the shooting starts he closed the door I mean we had
[23:34.720 --> 23:40.840]  an article I mentioned it but I'd already been banned off YouTube or had
[23:40.840 --> 23:45.120]  videos blocked misrepresenting what I'd said when I just pointed out there was a
[23:45.120 --> 23:50.600]  stand down the students told us that who we had on plus local news so they
[23:50.600 --> 23:54.360]  misrepresented what I said and then took the videos down and now I realize
[23:54.360 --> 23:58.760]  why they were so scared they didn't want anybody actually looking at what went
[23:58.760 --> 24:07.960]  on so here's the deal David Hogg is a public figure now and he's called me
[24:07.960 --> 24:12.240]  cussword names and a con artist and a fraud he's in a man's world I haven't
[24:12.240 --> 24:17.480]  done all that and then it came out over the weekend and we guys reprinted an
[24:17.480 --> 24:21.760]  article thanks Paul Joseph Watson found his reddit and it is David Hogg's
[24:21.760 --> 24:30.560]  Reddit and he's there talking about how we it's good that mosquitoes are killing
[24:30.560 --> 24:36.640]  millions of people because we need billions to die for depopulation and
[24:36.640 --> 24:41.880]  see that's just the perfect globalist leftist religion that's Billa Melinda
[24:41.880 --> 24:48.520]  Gates that's the UN that's this whole program there it is David Hogg Reddit
[24:48.520 --> 24:51.720]  post celebrates mosquitoes killing billions of humans I want to put that
[24:51.720 --> 24:58.360]  back up on info wars.com because that came out Saturday and it went viral but
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.040]  didn't get picked up by anybody else and it's his reddit linking back to his
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.560]  other accounts and him over the years they kill humans billions of them which
[25:06.560 --> 25:12.400]  is great for the environment that's like a professor pionka at UT you know
[25:12.400 --> 25:17.080]  saying similar things so oh he wants billions gone but 16 dead he's the
[25:17.080 --> 25:27.400]  saddest person in the world so this is crazy and Hogg needs to be really looked
[25:27.400 --> 25:33.160]  into very very closely obviously and people need to I need to compile just
[25:33.160 --> 25:39.640]  all these interviews of him where he's saying completely different stuff on
[25:39.640 --> 25:46.360]  the same day they're in there with the blurry soulful stuff I'm in here he's
[25:46.360 --> 25:52.360]  he's shooting right now and he's telling you the time but then when it's
[25:52.360 --> 25:55.880]  supposedly happening saying he's three miles away when it starts I mean it's
[25:55.880 --> 25:59.920]  not just one video there's like dozens of these where he's saying two different
[25:59.920 --> 26:08.320]  things and let's go ahead and just roll some of this video go ahead go ahead and
[26:08.320 --> 26:13.160]  roll it with the one where he says he wrote his back in here it is on the day
[26:13.160 --> 26:18.520]  of the shooting I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could
[26:18.520 --> 26:22.640]  three miles from my house to school to get as much video and get him as many
[26:22.640 --> 26:27.120]  interviews as I could because I knew that it this could not be another mass
[26:27.120 --> 26:31.280]  shooting well this is not about us well I was in my AP environmental science class
[26:31.280 --> 26:35.720]  when the first gunshot rang out I mean you look around our classroom told the
[26:35.720 --> 26:39.720]  teacher to close the door she closed the door then right when she did so the fire
[26:39.720 --> 26:44.720]  response and we all started instinctually stupidly inside walking out as we were
[26:44.720 --> 26:49.800]  walking out now let's go to the closet one and there's even more I spent hours
[26:49.800 --> 26:55.760]  and hours and I I'm gonna be honest with you I got tears in my eyes
[26:56.760 --> 27:02.320]  because I started looking into hog even more after I saw Paul's article where he
[27:02.320 --> 27:06.400]  wants billions of people to die and you have to understand something my head
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.840]  exploded with understanding and chills like I'm getting right now because you
[27:11.840 --> 27:15.880]  understand George Soros is one of those 10 people that met at the Rockefeller
[27:15.880 --> 27:20.880]  Foundation meetings that ABC News London Guardian reported headline
[27:20.880 --> 27:24.440]  billionaires meet to discuss overpopulation and they said at the
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.040]  end of the article we need a world government it's like seven years ago we
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.920]  need a world government to reduce population and it was George Soros
[27:32.920 --> 27:41.400]  David Rockefeller Ted Turner Bill Melinda Gates George Soros there it is
[27:41.400 --> 27:46.920]  Wall Street Journal billionaires try to shrink world population 2009 so I guess
[27:46.920 --> 27:54.720]  wow that's already eight nine years ago well and you can go read it secret
[27:54.720 --> 28:00.840]  meeting that got leaked and then hog is funded by George Soros a literal Nazi
[28:00.840 --> 28:06.120]  collaborator the women's march is the main funder he's the main funder of that
[28:06.680 --> 28:11.520]  and then hog wants the population what do you think's really going on here now
[28:11.520 --> 28:32.800]  folks let's go ahead and go to hog here it is
[28:32.800 --> 28:37.920]  around 230 we heard a gunshot and we initially thought it was a drill I just
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.240]  thought I can't handle anymore never listen he says he's we have to get the
[28:42.240 --> 28:45.400]  timeline because he's he's he's here that he's saying on these videos the
[28:45.400 --> 28:50.160]  timeline this is when it's beginning in the closet but when it's beginning he's
[28:50.160 --> 28:55.600]  at his house and rides three miles on his bike and then his story after that is
[28:55.600 --> 29:00.920]  though I was always there when it began in my class hunters anglers campers and

[33:42.840 --> 33:46.920]  texas and I want to put some bookends on what I was just getting into with the
[33:46.920 --> 33:52.560]  huge public figure the anti-gun superstars he's called the guy that said
[33:52.560 --> 33:56.160]  the establishment is shaking in its boots that he thanked all the major
[33:56.160 --> 34:00.560]  corporate groups and government and others for being anti-gun it is the
[34:00.560 --> 34:06.840]  establishment that is for victim disarmament mr. hogg on the day of the
[34:06.840 --> 34:09.640]  shooting said that he was home when he learned of the shooting we've already
[34:09.640 --> 34:15.280]  played that club and then he got on his bike and his camera and then he raced to
[34:15.280 --> 34:20.720]  the school to do interviews then there are interviews he gave where he said
[34:20.720 --> 34:25.440]  that he was at the school in a particular class when they heard what they
[34:25.440 --> 34:30.840]  thought was the shot so he learned of the shooting there then there's other
[34:30.840 --> 34:37.200]  videos where he's in a closet saying that there's a shooting going on and you
[34:37.200 --> 34:43.600]  know it's very dramatic shot like saving saving private ryan style with a
[34:43.600 --> 34:49.400]  shaking camera now I want to be clear I believe the shootings happened I believe
[34:49.400 --> 34:56.040]  mass shootings are a terrible thing I don't blame gun owners for them the
[34:56.040 --> 35:01.280]  media has misrepresented day one somebody else's video said they thought
[35:01.280 --> 35:05.160]  he was a crisis actor they removed that video which I don't think they should do
[35:05.160 --> 35:10.440]  people have their free speech right and then they attributed to me and then took
[35:10.440 --> 35:13.880]  a bunch of our videos down and tried to set a precedent to ban everybody's
[35:13.880 --> 35:19.040]  speech as massive censorship intensifies it wasn't for drudgereport.com and
[35:19.040 --> 35:21.760]  all of you making a big deal out of this Google would not have destroyed our
[35:21.760 --> 35:28.000]  channel and remove the strikes the false strikes which again even the Wall

[35:32.000 --> 35:36.600]  wiki leaks off the internet then it'd be everybody else it's exactly what Matt
[35:36.600 --> 35:40.640]  dredge was warned of two and a half years ago by a conservative chief justice
[35:40.640 --> 35:50.360]  the one that's still living so I really thought about this and I thought about
[35:50.360 --> 36:00.400]  it long and hard why would David Hogg have a camera while the mass shootings
[36:00.400 --> 36:08.760]  going on in a closet but then he's at home and has to get a camera to come
[36:08.760 --> 36:15.480]  cover it because you see people could argue that well he was at the school and
[36:15.480 --> 36:21.720]  he left three miles I guess to get a camera and then came back three miles
[36:21.720 --> 36:25.720]  that's not what he said and then by then the shooting would be over he wouldn't
[36:25.720 --> 36:36.560]  be in a closet so there's no way that that that he either made up some of the
[36:36.560 --> 36:39.320]  stories didn't think it was dramatic enough that he wasn't at the school when
[36:39.320 --> 36:44.920]  it happened he got there after he kind of recreated some of it a lot of a lot of
[36:44.920 --> 36:50.400]  journalists been caught doing that before or he really was at the school
[36:50.400 --> 36:53.600]  during the shooting and for some reason just said he was at home and he's lying
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.720]  about that I mean you can't look at this as a police investigator or a
[36:58.720 --> 37:05.800]  journalist or anybody and say wow there's nothing going on here we'll post this
[37:05.800 --> 37:09.800]  video from this live show the next few hours in full wars calm and try to look
[37:09.800 --> 37:12.920]  at the comments because a lot of times you'll have angles that I didn't think
[37:12.920 --> 37:21.280]  of but I'm just trying to figure this out one way or another maybe from the
[37:21.280 --> 37:27.320]  stress he completely blacked out that's happened before PTSD and just had
[37:27.320 --> 37:30.760]  amnesia when he was at the school and shot these videos at the shooters right
[37:30.760 --> 37:38.240]  outside and we're waiting for the police and all this and he had amnesia and then
[37:38.240 --> 37:43.240]  he went home and then had amnesia and then went back once he didn't have amnesia
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.880]  I'm not being sarcastic I'm trying to believe David Hogg and maybe when he
[37:47.880 --> 37:54.800]  wrote about good thing that billions of people die from mosquitoes because we
[37:54.800 --> 38:00.440]  need to depopulate the earth maybe he has multiple personalities and that was
[38:00.440 --> 38:05.000]  the bad personality maybe there's a good personality a sweet person that does
[38:05.000 --> 38:15.320]  care about 16 dead young people I mean I'm just tongue-in-cheek here at this
[38:15.320 --> 38:20.360]  point trying to come up with some theories here but you notice the media
[38:20.360 --> 38:27.520]  is dead silent in four wars calm hundreds of thousands of people red
[38:27.520 --> 38:31.120]  Paul Watson's article hundreds and hundreds of thousands watched the
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.640]  videos I put out I checked it on Sunday and the view counts on the three
[38:35.640 --> 38:40.560]  different videos we put out on it were about 400,000 so 400,000 people watch
[38:40.560 --> 38:44.560]  videos about Paul Watson's article I know hundreds of thousands read it as I
[38:44.560 --> 38:56.200]  asked Paul and there is no coverage of it there is no discussion there is no
[38:56.200 --> 39:03.400]  debate there is no nothing I mean if we were wrong about this being his reddit
[39:03.400 --> 39:08.880]  handle and or if it's a good thing to want to see billions die then we
[39:08.880 --> 39:17.040]  should hear from Mr. Hogg about it mosquitoes they kill billions of them
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.200]  which is great for the environment they kill humans billions of them which is
[39:21.200 --> 39:24.840]  great for the environment well is 16 dead fellow students go for the
[39:24.840 --> 39:30.360]  environment if you're like Bill Maher that's a liberal political religious
[39:30.360 --> 39:35.120]  sacrament is abortion depopulation not caring about other people Bill Maher I
[39:35.120 --> 39:39.600]  say kill people euthanize them make them commit suicide whatever to whatever
[39:39.600 --> 39:42.680]  gets the freeway moving
[39:46.480 --> 39:52.280]  and so I'm just sitting here dealing with this and asking questions of
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.040]  anomalies I was criticized as a liar three days into it because we had
[39:56.040 --> 39:58.960]  students on the media said Jones media matters
[39:58.960 --> 40:03.840]  George Soros came out and said Jones claims the police stood down Jones claims
[40:03.840 --> 40:10.240]  the deputy didn't go in no the students we had on and that matched up with local
[40:10.240 --> 40:15.120]  newsfeeds you know local eyewitness newsfeeds all saying the same thing and
[40:15.120 --> 40:18.560]  then we get a couple students on and other students contact us are scared to
[40:18.560 --> 40:21.400]  come on and they say yeah there were a bunch of sheriff's deputies there during
[40:21.400 --> 40:25.320]  the shooting and they didn't go in and there were multiple shooters they didn't
[40:25.320 --> 40:29.200]  want that discussed I wasn't saying there were multiple shooters I said the
[40:29.200 --> 40:35.200]  witnesses were all saying it some of them were with Nick Cruz while the
[40:35.200 --> 40:39.520]  shooting still going on and YouTube took that video down because they didn't
[40:39.520 --> 40:45.400]  want that going viral did they then hog challenges me to a debate then hog
[40:45.400 --> 40:52.800]  backs out Laura Ingram hog is saying man four colleges I've applied to none of
[40:52.800 --> 40:57.320]  them want me what's going on I don't know how you're getting your grades when
[40:57.320 --> 41:00.240]  you haven't even been back to school in a month and a half you say you don't need
[41:00.240 --> 41:04.600]  to be in your classes and you're a senior and if you're a university and you
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.040]  see somebody that they know is going to end up taking that school over with the
[41:08.040 --> 41:12.920]  media and they know that it evergreen and it all these other colleges from
[41:12.920 --> 41:19.920]  from from Missouri to to Oregon they have 20 to 30 percent enrollment drops in
[41:19.920 --> 41:27.320]  one year when SJWs have stunts
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.760]  so the globalists are trying to stop us sharing information stop us
[41:35.760 --> 41:39.640]  communicating Facebook Twitter YouTube they're all censoring more than ever
[41:39.640 --> 41:44.240]  Google that's what we've got to talk people word of mouth we got a call to
[41:44.240 --> 41:48.080]  talk radio we got a call in the C-span you got to start a local radio show
[41:48.080 --> 41:54.040]  started access TV show put up a little FM transmitter that just goes a mile in
[41:54.040 --> 42:00.800]  your neighborhood in an open space and and and you know hand out flyers and do
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.120]  your own community broadcast whatever you do we're an information war and we're
[42:05.120 --> 42:11.940]  winning but the globalists are pushing back Trump has a 50% approval rating
[42:11.940 --> 42:15.720]  even though Rasmussen samples more Democrats than Republicans Trump's
[42:15.720 --> 42:20.960]  really at 60 65% just like I told you for the election of voters likely voters
[42:20.960 --> 42:26.080]  the globalists are in panic mode we are culturally winning they are bullying
[42:26.080 --> 42:32.360]  everybody the universities are weaponized political operations pushing a
[42:32.360 --> 42:36.400]  criminal agenda of anti-free speech anti-self-defense anti-free market that
[42:36.400 --> 42:40.720]  are deploying into all the major bureaucracies and systems to try to shut
[42:40.720 --> 42:47.560]  everyone up the answer to that the answer to censorship is action and speech
[42:47.560 --> 42:53.760]  the answer to this is resistance and getting energized and aggressive will
[42:53.760 --> 43:00.160]  be right back info wars calm news wars calm stay with us we need to fund this

[49:54.240 --> 50:02.120]  two incredible ladies and gentlemen that is the next level of all of this now
[50:02.120 --> 50:07.920]  coming up more big studies in fact you were putting some of the other ones up
[50:07.920 --> 50:12.320]  I just have the CBS print me just the latest cell phones cancer click news
[50:12.320 --> 50:16.400]  print me those I want to show people how they're all written the same they just
[50:16.400 --> 50:20.160]  discovered it guaranteed gives you brain cancer and heart cancer and all this
[50:20.160 --> 50:25.680]  other stuff they just they just discovered it yesterday no they knew in
[50:25.680 --> 50:29.680]  the 80s and I'm gonna have my researchers go to the micro fish I'm
[50:29.680 --> 50:33.440]  gonna read the articles in the late 80s and early 90s and I'm gonna pull and
[50:33.440 --> 50:37.440]  show you how it's all the same they always oh we just learned oh we just
[50:37.440 --> 50:41.880]  learns but it's not that bad and then now the 5g is way stronger than the others
[50:41.880 --> 50:47.880]  it's out of control so we're gonna break it all down coming up but first I
[50:47.880 --> 50:54.280]  wanted to tie it into a very powerful report by Leanne McAdoo or yeah if
[50:54.280 --> 50:57.640]  you're predisposed if you smoke three packs of cigarettes to lung cancer you'll
[50:57.640 --> 51:01.800]  get it some people can smoke and not get it but it isn't your genetics is giving
[51:01.800 --> 51:04.920]  you the cancer it's that you're smoking the cigarettes and then your body can't
[51:04.920 --> 51:07.920]  take it it's like some people can drink more not have their liver fail others
[51:07.920 --> 51:11.760]  can yeah genetically you're predisposed if you're a native American not be able
[51:11.760 --> 51:14.760]  to drink as much it's just genetic if you're European where the whole dark
[51:14.760 --> 51:19.000]  ages they survived off fermenting everything during the summer and living
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.640]  off alcohol in the winter the main diet was alcohol even for children
[51:22.640 --> 51:28.120]  everybody died couldn't handle it livers were passed on that were meaner
[51:28.120 --> 51:31.680]  than hell that's why Europeans worldwide are known to be the people that can
[51:31.680 --> 51:37.080]  drink the most right through to Russia because if you didn't have a good liver
[51:37.080 --> 51:41.480]  you died by the time you're about 10 years old and genetically it passed on
[51:41.480 --> 51:46.160]  livers that could operate that way okay so that's what this is all about folks
[51:46.160 --> 51:50.160]  says all the diseases massively increased they keep saying oh oh you have bad
[51:50.160 --> 51:53.000]  genetics of bad genetics though it's what's in the environment here's Leanne's
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.400]  report on Alzheimer's exploding off the charts and what's behind it I came
[51:57.400 --> 52:00.200]  across some really interesting information that I think is going to be
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.320]  urgent for anyone out there who has been affected by Alzheimer's practically
[52:04.320 --> 52:08.360]  every one of us knows at least one person whose life has been affected by
[52:08.360 --> 52:12.240]  this disease if it runs in your family you just prepare yourself that it could
[52:12.240 --> 52:17.840]  happen to you or someone that you love by 2050 we're on track to have 15
[52:17.840 --> 52:22.360]  million Alzheimer's patients in the United States alone those numbers are
[52:22.360 --> 52:27.280]  staggering and it's why most Americans just accept Alzheimer's as an inevitable
[52:27.280 --> 52:34.040]  way of life due to aging or bad genes but in reality less than 1% of the
[52:34.040 --> 52:39.960]  population develops this disease due to a genetic mutation in their DNA now we're
[52:39.960 --> 52:44.600]  learning that much like with cancer or heart disease or diabetes or other
[52:44.600 --> 52:50.040]  conditions it's not due to genetics but the risk is related to lifestyle and
[52:50.040 --> 52:54.120]  behavioral factors and that's really important because it means that we have
[52:54.120 --> 52:59.520]  the power to take actions right now to change the outcome in a recently released
[52:59.520 --> 53:04.320]  large-scale study researchers found that a 10% increase in consumption of
[53:04.320 --> 53:09.960]  ultra-processed foods led to a 12% increase in overall cancer events now
[53:09.960 --> 53:13.680]  the study isn't that shocking mostly as a nation we've become pretty cognizant of
[53:13.680 --> 53:19.640]  how ultra-processed foods and partially hydrogenated oils are having a really
[53:19.640 --> 53:24.480]  detrimental effect on our overall health but this study did really catch the eye
[53:24.480 --> 53:29.600]  of Dr. Lisa Mosconi and others at the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at
[53:29.600 --> 53:35.720]  Wild Cornell Medical because the BMJ study their findings really lined up so
[53:35.720 --> 53:40.560]  closely with research in their field that linked diet and risk of Alzheimer's
[53:40.560 --> 53:45.800]  this new BMJ study underscored their research showing how important lifestyle
[53:45.800 --> 53:51.040]  changes could be to delaying or possibly avoiding altogether the onset of this
[53:51.040 --> 53:56.080]  disease Dr. Mosconi says the consensus among scientists is that over one third
[53:56.080 --> 54:00.640]  of all Alzheimer's cases could be prevented by improving our lifestyle
[54:00.640 --> 54:05.240]  this includes cardiovascular fitness keeping our brains intellectually
[54:05.240 --> 54:09.800]  stimulated and perhaps most of all eating better and for Dr. Mosconi and
[54:09.800 --> 54:14.200]  others at the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic eating better means addressing the
[54:14.200 --> 54:19.800]  ultra-processed foods that can make up half of the American diet in most cases
[54:19.800 --> 54:24.600]  ultra-processed foods include mass-produced packaged foods as well as
[54:24.600 --> 54:29.320]  foods containing manufactured substances like hydrogenated oils also known as
[54:29.320 --> 54:34.360]  trans fats so this means commercial breads and buns and biscuits and crackers
[54:34.360 --> 54:39.520]  packaged snacks industrialized confectionary and desserts like icing
[54:39.520 --> 54:43.840]  that you put on your children's cakes and cupcakes sodas and sweetened drinks
[54:43.840 --> 54:48.960]  meat products like cold cuts and chicken nuggets instant noodles and soups frozen
[54:48.960 --> 54:55.400]  or shelf stable ready meals margarine processed cheese and most creamers these
[54:55.400 --> 54:59.480]  are the foods whose consumption triggered an increase of cancer rates in the
[54:59.480 --> 55:04.520]  BMJ study and according to Dr. Mosconi consuming these foods also increases
[55:04.520 --> 55:09.000]  your risk for cognitive decline and dementia and also when you're looking
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.520]  at the label you really want to pay attention to the ingredients the label
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.320]  might say zero trans fats per serving but if you look closer you're likely to
[55:17.320 --> 55:21.960]  find partially hydrogenated oils in the top five ingredients partially
[55:21.960 --> 55:27.720]  hydrogenated oils have been widely used as ingredients since the 1950s to
[55:27.720 --> 55:32.320]  increase shelf life and flavor stability of processed foods now think about it at
[55:32.320 --> 55:37.760]  that exact same time we've seen a dramatic increase in new cancer cases
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.440]  heart disease diabetes and other conditions so here's a tip if your food
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.200]  can last in your pantry for weeks and weeks without going stale it's likely
[55:47.200 --> 55:55.240]  that trans fats are keeping them fresh again by 2050 15 million people will or
[55:55.240 --> 56:00.240]  will not be diagnosed with Alzheimer's in other words Alzheimer's is not some
[56:00.240 --> 56:04.480]  disease that just flips on like a switch those people who are going to be
[56:04.480 --> 56:09.880]  diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2050 are starting to develop the disease right
[56:09.880 --> 56:17.680]  now and again Alzheimer's is just a catch-all name for older people with
[56:17.680 --> 56:22.240]  neurological disorders and normally brain inflammation of that top neuroscientist
[56:22.240 --> 56:26.840]  top brain surgeons like Blalock on that wrote the book on it and when I say
[56:26.840 --> 56:31.400]  literally literally all of his terms now are the mainline science of it and now
[56:31.400 --> 56:36.480]  you're gonna be with Alzheimer's at age 25 30 so again it's it's the flicker
[56:36.480 --> 56:40.320]  rates it's the television it's the screens it's the chemicals it's the
[56:40.320 --> 56:46.320]  sedentary lifestyle all of it fusing together but the key is electromagnetic
[56:46.320 --> 56:53.760]  you see cell phones oscillate at the exact frequency to cut DNA up into pieces
[56:53.760 --> 57:00.560]  it vibrates it look it up so it causes massive DNA damage and so it's just
[57:00.560 --> 57:04.920]  frying brains and again the heart is also very electrochemical it's got all
[57:04.920 --> 57:09.840]  these key nerves in it as well that operate they get destabilized and and
[57:09.840 --> 57:13.400]  they start to mutate and that's why it's associated in the big studies that are
[57:13.400 --> 57:19.080]  in CBS news with heart attacks and with heart cancer heart cancer used to be
[57:19.080 --> 57:25.200]  extremely rare heart cancer heart cancer is exploding because the cell phones
[57:25.200 --> 57:30.080]  are destabilizing them hey they tell you turn your cell phones off on an
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.800]  airplane it can mess up the avionics what do you think it's doing to you and we
[57:34.800 --> 57:38.720]  all got the things all I'm saying is we got to wake up we got to do something
[57:38.720 --> 57:42.360]  about this my god there's studies that cell phones kill more people than

[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.520]  but there's a lot of controversy around this network about alex jones
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.440]  google is being accused of hiding negative stories about hillary and her
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:14.560]  campaign but changing its algorithm to marry stories like the clinton body count
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.120]  story that's according to website info wars
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.160]  our recent shooters with fully automatic weapons
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.360]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in mess with kennethy
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.600]  JFK was shot from the back and the front
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:34.480]  it was almost as if it were a planned impulsion it just pancaked
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.360]  they took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on a cold spot
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:44.080]  I think this is a national security imperative we have clear things that we do not understand
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.560]  how they were operating in areas that we can't control
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:54.320]  USA is this global governance at last is it one world the central bankers in charge
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.840]  Israel claims the attack was accidental some former US naval officers say it was on purpose
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.360]  they describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.960]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.480]  Russian stop!
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.800]  denied everything he called it all fake news
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.880]  and he accused CNN of being fake news
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.680]  this is a national emergency
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:23.520]  if they kill Trump or remove Trump it will cause a massive civil war in this country
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.480]  this is a female high-level emergency
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.080]  we are at war with Russia
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.800]  are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800]  which leaks
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.800]  the White House president are citing info wars

[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.960]  it's Alex Jones
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.360]  when President Trump signed the 2,232 page left-right corporate credit
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:00.640]  1.6 trillion omnibus last week that barely anyone read or was able to read
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:06.560]  Trump along with many American voters affected by the rampant flow of drugs and illegal immigration
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:13.400]  had hoped for more funding for the border wall instead the budget included a measly 1.6 billion
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.520]  of the needed 25 billion
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.040]  and as Rand Paul tweeted plenty of funds went to wasteful spending
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.360]  6 billion to the National Science Foundation alone
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:27.000]  9 billion for the GSA that oversees federal properties
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.200]  the federal government spent 1.7 billion a year to maintain
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:36.600]  770,000 empty buildings while continuing to buy new properties
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.400]  218 million for promoting democracy development in Europe
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.800]  25 million for international religious freedom
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.080]  and another 10 million for disadvantaged Egyptian students
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.960]  even the 1.6 billion allocated for the wall won't even get the ball rolling
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.200]  according to Homeland Security today
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.840]  641 million will go toward fencing on the southern border
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.920]  while 960 million will be allocated to border surveillance technology
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.680]  and repairing existing infrastructure
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:13.360]  and now President Trump is on the warpath calling out the sanctuary city madness
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.640]  sanctuary cities released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into our communities
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.560]  including drug traffickers drug dealers and vicious gang members
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.080]  in fact several of the criminal aliens who got away in Oakland
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:32.280]  after the mayor helped them evade capture have already committed new crimes
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.000]  crimes that could have been easily prevented
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.160]  if not for Oakland's dangerous sanctuary policies
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.280]  it is no coincidence that six of the biggest heroin markets in the United States
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.200]  are sanctuary cities
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.200]  more than 40% of heroin coming across the southern border
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.640]  is transported through California
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.800]  a sanctuary state
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.400]  drug cartels have transformed sanctuary cities
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.440]  like Denver
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.480]  Los Angeles
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.480]  Chicago
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.600]  and New York
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.480]  into major distribution centers
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.520]  because the criminal aliens in the drug trade
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.600]  know that local politicians will help them
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.600]  evade
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.920]  authorities
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:19.480]  sanctuary cities put innocent Americans at the mercy of hardened criminals and
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.280]  heartless drug dealers
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.000]  these are bad people
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.320]  we want our cities to be safe havens for Americans
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.360]  not criminal aliens
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.280]  it is time for Congress to cut off funds for sanctuary cities
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:37.520]  and to close the loopholes that allow drugs and criminals to violate our borders
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:40.440]  is on info wars dot com
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.560]  it's dims fuel caravan invasion of the US open borders
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.200]  I'm gonna cover this and a lot more on the other side
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.560]  I've cleared the deck of guests we're gonna open the phones up as well and then Matt Bracken will

[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:44.000]  part is most important the ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.080]  plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard that means it's clean
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.280]  that means it's pure and rest assured you're finding the tip of the spear in

[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:07.040]  we now take you live to the central texas commenced out in the heart of the resistance
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.120]  it's alex jones I just want to say something at the kickoff of this hour
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:35.120]  evil knows that good is on the rise and is and evil is throwing everything it's
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:42.720]  got at humanity right now I am seeing in government and media but even locally
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.120]  and even personally the best and worst in people and that's what they say
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:53.120]  historically happens at one of these quickening times when humanity makes big
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:07:00.120]  big collective spiritual decisions and the world is going in to all I can call it
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.360]  is the end times there's always these preachers that say I know the date and
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.640]  it's going to happen and what they're picking up is kind of the foreshadowing
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.600]  of what's coming and the media hype set up and the world doesn't end on a
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.440]  certain day and and I don't think the world's going to end the way a lot of
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:28.760]  people interpret the Bible if you study it deeper it means the end of an age it
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:35.760]  means the end of a system and a whole new system coming into play the Bible
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:42.000]  talks about a thousand year reign after the devil's chained up but in modern
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.360]  liberal cosmology everybody says the Christians say the end of the world's
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:51.920]  coming no the Christians say there's going to be a one world government that
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.160]  makes everybody have one religion and that they're going to persecute
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:01.920]  Christians and that they're going to make people have a digital mark on their
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.240]  hand and forehead where they're scanned to buy and sell and that families will
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:10.680]  be broken up and that children will be put in charge of parents I mean you
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:16.480]  read Daniel or revelations it's all right it's a cure reading it and you're
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:24.960]  like this is exactly what's happening and it says that they worship the beast
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:30.440]  the image of the beast and it's described as like 40 feet tall and it's in
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:37.000]  all the public places and it speaks and it can look whatever it wants to look
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.560]  like and then it communicates to everyone in the world and everyone
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:48.400]  marvels at the beast and then you've got the false prophet who tells you to
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:56.560]  follow the devil and again if you actually study the Bible I don't even
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.760]  look at these theologians actually read it myself and it makes perfect sense
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:05.360]  everything we're looking at today you have the false prophet who tells
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.400]  Christians to go along with it and you've got the beast that's the system and
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:15.240]  the AI it's everywhere and watching everyone and controlling everyone that's
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:21.240]  the AI and then you've got the antichrist who is the son of the devil
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:27.880]  world leader man unbelievable there it is you've got the you've got the pope
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.360]  saying there is no hell he's sick of Christianity open your borders world
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:38.960]  government's good one world religion that is word-for-word revelation and then
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:43.120]  you've got the beast worldwide television and AI and holograms coming in
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:47.520]  where you can have the beast and the supercomputer everyone's gonna worship the
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.240]  beast they don't just worship the devil they don't just worship antichrist they
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:58.880]  worship antichrist and the beast and the false prophet and the whore it rides in
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:10.200]  on what is the whore it's all the people that sold out to it you've got the
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:17.040]  apostate evil Christian religion that's been taken over you've got the
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.880]  worldwide beast system AI world government bureaucracy you've got the
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:29.400]  devil ruling over it and you've got the whore is the whole governmental
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.800]  political shell out system and everybody that's gonna want to have that
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.960]  perfect five-star rating with the beast where they'll be the cool group they'll
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.920]  be the in group they'll walk the red carpet everything for them will be
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:53.520]  taken care of for one year and then word-for-word the big tech giants come out
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.840]  and say we worship an AI God we're gonna be gods we're gonna live forever but our
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:05.320]  AI God says we have to kill 90% of you you should be 80 now it's 90 you really
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:16.880]  then it's gonna be 1% that it's gonna be one tenth of 1% and Zuckerberg walks in
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.320]  and all his employees have the goggles on hunched over in his false world but
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.400]  he sees he's conscious he's the God there in his false reality and then Bezos
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:33.400]  strutting with the attack dog robot all the same thing I am ruling all this and
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.600]  you can see it right there and they say we have to reduce the world population
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:42.680]  and the David Hogg is on Reddit saying hey I love the fact that people are dying
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:52.800]  from a status we need to save the earth that's the religion that's the religion
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.020]  because the computers and the factories are gonna be able to produce all the
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:12:04.680]  widgets and goods you want but you're not gonna have access to any of it you're
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:10.900]  not gonna have access to any of it unless you submit to the global credit
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:14.400]  score the global social score everybody keeps going oh Alex you got that from a
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.680]  black mirror episode about a year and a half ago everybody keeps saying watch
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.120]  the black mirror watch the black mirror episode you keep talking about a digital
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.400]  score and and how it's tied into the internet of things in the real world if
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.840]  you're not popular on it you won't be able to have a car a house or travel
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.360]  Paul Watson wrote the article four years ago the Communist Chinese announced it
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.360]  black mirror was written a year later that episode they get it from reality
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.600]  I'm not getting it from TV they're getting it from us figured it out yet we
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.920]  are the vanguard we are the tip of the spear we tell you about it before it's
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:56.600]  rolled out hoping we can build momentum against it they only announced it once
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.200]  it's ubiquitous and rolling out and I'm not bragging about how we're cutting
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:08.560]  edge everybody should be cutting edge it's life and death people are children
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:16.280]  this system is total death there are hundreds of millions of people that
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.840]  have gotten brain cancer from cell phones I've got the big studies in front
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:25.480]  of me now it's getting even worse because the cell phone power and the 5g
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:29.760]  is going way more powerful and they're gonna go it doesn't matter roll dying of
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:33.440]  cancer it's Mother Earth cleansing us merge with the machine upload your
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.120]  brain but to do it you've got to die I told you that for over a decade it was
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.280]  announced last week we have the company we can upload your brain but you must die
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.560]  in the process it's gonna be a con game it's not gonna be your spirit it's not
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.360]  gonna be you it's a fraud just like computers can already a hundred percent
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:14:00.280]  fake video and audio it's the same crap and these people have signed on to this
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:11.400]  100% so if you want to use a modern cosmology it's basically an
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:15.240]  interdimensional alien transmission meant to make us kill ourselves and
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.240]  metamorphosize into some type of silicon based system that this spirit can
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.200]  interface with and control it doesn't like free will now you can say oh that
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.520]  doesn't really exist the AI tech giants say it does they believe they're
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.000]  channeling interdimensional stuff they go take DMT in ayahuasca they've been
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.440]  doing this for 50 years at Berkeley what do you think Berkeley is it's a
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:42.160]  mushroom cult it's a hallucination cult and they're in there in these DMT
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:46.920]  trances it's there's been books written about it being told and you're gonna
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.480]  have tablets and then they're gonna interface and then the kids will be
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.640]  addicted then we're gonna jack into your brain and they're being told while in
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.200]  an interdimensional trance at six-dimensional level connected in
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.240]  through your brain in that trance with demons telling them how to build this
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.160]  stuff and then it's being done and let the media run wild with that everybody
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:12.000]  at a gut level knows the truth now so that's what this is we have been given
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:24.400]  technology to kill ourselves and it's working quite well and you can know it's
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.960]  just happened over and over again because it's formulaic these these entities
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.320]  aren't even very creative themselves they are repeating stuff has been done
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:37.600]  before and I can just study it and see what it is and know so this is it this
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:43.160]  is space invasion folks sit that's what it is and they've got they've got us
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.480]  turning on things that fry us and kill us and then we beg to be part of it and
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.360]  move into areas that have the best 5g so we can get the biggest fattest juiciest
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.800]  brain tumors and have the best to form babies now that ain't satanic I'll kiss

[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:22.160]  when I grow up I want us to be a type 1 civilization not kill each other at the
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:37.120]  behest of some fallen infancy
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:42.880]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center and the heart of
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:52.000]  the resistance you're listening to alex jones so there is a phenomenon where
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.360]  millions of people who were atheists are no longer atheist and have apologized to
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.040]  me many of them a lot of famous people off record saying I used to be an
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.000]  atheist I thought you were crazy believing in spiritual stuff but when I
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.440]  take DMT or I take ayahuasca I have conversations with advanced space
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:13.800]  aliens on spaceships you know they they they show me the future and it happens
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:19.960]  a week later it's just incredible stuff or sometimes you take it you get
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.520]  transported and put on a slave ship orbiting a star for a thousand years
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:30.280]  that's what people are experiencing I've never taken that stuff I have studied
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:34.080]  CIA mind control I've studied Berkeley where they was the main center of that
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.240]  I have talked to people that were involved in those programs I mean
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.560]  professors and scientists and very successful people when I was a teenager
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:46.000]  and then in college I started this show and I and some people I knew were
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.680]  professors and folks said you want to know what's really going on kid and I
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:53.280]  heard about this stuff 10 years before it was even in literature and then you
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:58.480]  started saying like the CIA put out the LSD formulation in the 60s well they've
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:04.960]  now decided to push the DMT the ayahuasca all of it and people are just
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:10.480]  falling to it and they're having pretty much universal experiences so they now
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:17.840]  believe there's a God or gods once they've taken this understand I am not
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:24.160]  even saying all of this is real I am telling you that this has been deployed
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:29.680]  by Silicon Valley and Big Tech to bring in a one-world religion they believe
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:34.320]  that 90% of you must be exterminated or more before they attain godhood and
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:39.120]  merge with Silicon now I told you that 10 years ago an in-game I told you that
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.280]  20 years ago on the radio people made fun of it the New York Times attacked it go
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:47.760]  watch in game it's free online and it's everything you now see today that the
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:51.120]  elite worship AI gods that they believe they're going to become gods that they
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:54.680]  believe while they take DMT and ayahuasca these executives are just
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:23:02.000]  heavily into the stuff that they're channeling the future people think of
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.600]  an alien invasion as in the third dimension from space there's dimensions
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:15.120]  below and above us the mathematics show it and whether it's real or not you have
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:23.240]  these spirit guides like mescalito and all this little goat man you know you're
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:28.680]  taking DMT and little goat man shows up he's not your buddy okay and he's got a
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:35.440]  plan though you're gonna be a god as long as you kill everybody now that's
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:40.120]  what I got into earlier and whether you believe in this or not the professors
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:44.160]  and the scientists and the ruling class the people that own time-life books
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:49.880]  were taken LSD in the 40s they made the decision the CIA and the 50s should have
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:54.640]  given it to the public but they only wanted on universities they don't want
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:01.200]  the general public taking it's mind control and I'm not some square up here
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:05.840]  saying the LSD you know like throw you in prison for it I'm telling you
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:13.600]  historical facts here the unabomber was in an MK ultra LSD program the Yale or
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:20.400]  Harvard it's in the LA Times yeah there's mescalito everybody sees that and
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.280]  he's just got a nice plan for you don't worry join him to get a lot of power and
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.920]  we're gonna kill everybody but if we kill everybody you'll be a god and if you
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.960]  believe that you're an idiot I mean Bathomet shows up in your face and
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.560]  people go gee I've seen this before gee really bad people that sacrifice kids and

[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:53.520]  leftist or weak fallen people that are taking this stuff every weekend folks and
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:59.120]  they are into it and they want power and they believe it and they want blood and
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:05.640]  you got the darling movie star of the youth that they'll just join the
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.640]  establishment David Hogg in his reddit how he want you know mosquitoes need to
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.080]  kill billions of people it'll be good for the earth but he cares about 16 that
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:19.280]  are dead it's a spirit it's a transmission the angels didn't know
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:27.120]  what to call they called it a spirit it's a transmission and humans are
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:34.800]  receivers and broadcasters transceivers and you get these minds locked in
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.840]  hypnotized by the television hypnotized by the culture and they get
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:46.920]  brought into this and again even if you don't believe in this I'm telling you
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:53.520]  before anybody else told you that Silicon Valley believe they're gonna live
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:57.280]  forever and be gods and they're building an AI world system that you will
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.000]  worship that will interface with all your brains and take control of your
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.760]  consciousness and now Elon Musk comes out six months ago and says I've been at
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.000]  the world government meetings almost all the other billionaires want a world
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.240]  government they want to reduce the population they want to dumb you down
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:16.480]  they want to take total control of you and your family and beware people that
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:25.440]  worship AI gods this way leads to total destruction oh it's in the news every day
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.600]  ABC news DJ describes demonically possessed partygoers at a rave where man
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:35.520]  died from unknown drug and here's the thing the ancients would always start
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.520]  using this stuff and it would be loved it would be science would open them up
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:42.960]  but always a hundred years later there'd be a black pyramid and they'd be
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:49.360]  chopping people's hearts out or they'd be burning kids on to to bail they'd be
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:56.560]  burning kids where they'd have a big steel oven with the hands of the God you
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:01.960]  take your baby up with a 500 degree thing and watch it fry you'd fry a baby
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.920]  on a basically outdoor barbecue pit then eat it watch the priest pull a leg off
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:11.400]  your baby and if that was in the Mediterranean or if you were in England
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.640]  Malibu on they would come a lot of times demand the king give up his son oh
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:20.000]  it's the time the priest class we want your son oh we took your other son to be
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.720]  part of the priest class but no this son we're going to slit his throat and
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:31.520]  bash his brains out and throw him in to a peat bog or throw him on a bone fire
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:37.560]  so you can bond fire and it was a pure exercise a priest taking hallucinogens
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:47.480]  and interfacing with entities that said I will direct you every culture Asians
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:58.640]  Africans Mesoamericans every culture starts taking hallucinogens and then
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:05.880]  starts worshiping entities that demand blood and once you've taken enough times
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:15.680]  ladies and gentlemen just like substance D in PKD's scanner darkly they've got a
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:21.400]  government rehab program to take you in it's the university and now you're a
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:27.680]  programmable zombie they control now if your will is very strong and you can
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:33.880]  control it they'll say oh you're in the priest class but just like fast at the
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:39.560]  end of the day you will be destroyed now the time is short that's why I'm giving
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.800]  you the secrets folks these are the deepest secrets of Silicon Valley the
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:48.440]  Luciferians all of them I'm gonna get into more worldly issues and more
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:53.280]  temporal things happening now when we return I'm Alex Jones and this is an

[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.320]  use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.920]  their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to

[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:35.840]  until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the

[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:47.200]  only way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to

[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.240]  essential to spread the word and again thank you so much for being part of the
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:00.160]  second American Revolution. Infowar's life is bringing you a breakthrough in
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:05.000]  modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.720]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:15.440]  clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:20.240]  1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:25.400]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:29.600]  this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:34.160]  this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:38.720]  distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.800]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.240]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:51.840]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:56.680]  head to infowarstlife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.120]  tablets
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:06.360]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:34.840]  I just laid out what the globalists are into what their religion is I just
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.480]  laid it out in the last two segments because whether it's real or not or
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:44.040]  part of it's real and a lot of it's not true this is the whacked out programming
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:49.600]  that's in our brains that in every culture manifests itself when people
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:56.320]  start taking drugs that's what the Bible says don't take pharmacia don't get
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:03.200]  involved in you know wizardry and all this because you will get knowledge but
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:09.320]  all of it is is is like of the Islamic religion which really just repeats the
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:14.240]  more ancient text of the cultures that picked up in the Middle East a genie
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:18.720]  will give you what you want but you've got to be very careful because it always
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:22.920]  designs it to try to kill you or or or hurts you really bad so if you ask for
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:27.920]  five tons of gold ask for it to be set in front of you and not on top of you
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:32.120]  because the genie will drop it on top of you now do I really believe genies
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:35.800]  exist I think that's a metaphor for the type of advanced knowledge that comes
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:42.560]  from the ether comes from dark places in our brains I don't know all I know is
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:49.000]  I've told you what's real and what's been all the rage in our country's history
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.800]  and other nations histories and what is now manifesting itself in building a
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:58.560]  giant anti-human world government where they're going to put up five six seven
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:07.440]  G the different reports say that 5g is in some cases hundreds of times more
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:14.000]  powerful than regular cell phone transmission radiation well when they
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.440]  first came out with cell phones they admitted it caused brain tumors and
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:22.160]  that's in the news today so what species would know they were putting up
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:31.640]  transmitters all over the place that fry our DNA and fry our connection to God
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:39.880]  what it is is like a jamming system and it's been shown that long-term use of
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:46.920]  cell phones lowers brain waves fries your brain kills brain cells causes brain
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.840]  damage causes DNA breakage just just search engine you know Google drives
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:59.000]  these results down cell phone study damages DNA breaks DNA strands and they
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.880]  go it's very curious the microwave radiation vibrates at the just the
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:08.240]  right frequency to break the DNA they said it's funny a little bit higher it
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.440]  doesn't do a little bit lower it's weird that this broadcast spectrum that's the
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.720]  spectrum they've invented they know about just so happens to be the worst
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:25.720]  one just like the United States has a different flicker rate in Europe and in
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.200]  Europe they're a little bit different flicker rate it's actually not the best
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:36.960]  one but the United States had the best flicker rate that was chosen by federal
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:43.320]  standards back in the 50s and updated the 70s to put you into a dream state not
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:49.040]  just suspended disbelief because you're watching the show but a flicker rate from
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:57.440]  the screen that mesmerizes you that puts you into a literal near-dream state
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:08.680]  and you go out and more than 80% of the people now on a bus or walking down the
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:14.440]  street they're not dialed into the universe not dialed to their family
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:18.680]  they're not dialed into their ancestors are not dialed into God they're not
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:23.240]  dialed into you know the Sun the moon the trees the wind they're not dialed into
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.640]  a homeless person sitting in vomit next to them they're just dialed into that
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:36.440]  little tiny pinhole that is the projection of the establishment and the
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.560]  establishment doesn't like the fact that we jacked into the matrix and the
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:48.480]  info wars and drudge and others operate in that spectrum so now they got
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:53.800]  everybody addicted used to communicating with each other everyone talking to
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:57.000]  friends the family the neighbors seeing baby pictures talking to your mom
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.320]  talking to your father you know my 11 month old daughter when my middle
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:09.000]  daughter is with her mom sometimes she'll call or we'll call and face
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.920]  timer and here's the phone it's this radioactive device it's got these
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.320]  problems the globalist are watching what we're doing but it's great
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:22.160]  technology it has a good side to it the problem is it's being deployed for a
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:25.680]  bad side by the globalist technology itself not bad she's got to be honest
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:32.640]  about it and she gets so excited when she talks on face time and then she
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:40.120]  calls the phone hi and my daughter's name she sees phones and goes I want to
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:45.160]  talk to 11 months I've got video this I just got a bleep out my children's
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:50.440]  names obviously but I've got video of the baby crawling around starting to take
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.520]  a few steps trying to grab at your cell phone saying I want to talk to my
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:00.680]  sister on that because to her that's a system on her favorite person in the
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:08.200]  world my middle daughter it's not me it's not my wife it's that middle daughter
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:13.120]  they just sink up in the room they giggle and play for hours they draw they play
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.240]  with toys they roll around they're in love with each other and in a sisterly
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:23.000]  way and the fact that she gets to look into that crystal ball that that 11
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.800]  month old baby that's magic magic of technology and talk to her sister when
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:33.240]  her sister's on vacation with mom for a week or whatever and she's missing her
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:39.920]  asking for her name she starts pointing at the phone and says hello and her
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:43.720]  sister's name and it's just going I want to fuck me now she's really talking
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:55.760]  surprise my daughter's verbal and she's so amazing and to think the system wants
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:01.680]  to control and rule her life and remember that all the major tech heads
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:04.760]  from Bill Gates to Steve Jobs said we don't let our children have cell phones
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.200]  we don't let them have iPads it lowers their IQ and there's thousands upon
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.640]  thousands of studies admitting all that so so I kind of went off the not the
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:17.840]  deep end today but important things to understand why all this evil is taking
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:24.920]  place why this is going on why people are so zombified how this is an
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.440]  absolute brain-shipping program and now they've got six of the phones they go

[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:05.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:35.760]  all right I want to get into Sacramento where protesters jump in front of

[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:45.400]  victims we're also going to DNC chair vice chair calls for repeal the second
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.400]  amendment while the leftist media says nobody wants your guns it's a
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:53.400]  conspiracy theory absolutely incredible we're gonna get more into DNA tests for
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.240]  IQ or coming but it might not be smart to take one absolutely this whole
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:02.320]  things are fraud in my view and we're gonna also get into the latest North
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:11.600]  Korea developments but David Hogg says it's great corporate America is standing
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:16.600]  with me now we pointed out corporate America basically to a company is
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:21.080]  anti-gun they funded victim disarmament all the world corporations want total
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:25.040]  control and Soros is establishment the Nazi collaborator the Democratic Party's
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.800]  establishment Hollywood's establishment and it's pretty much all behind you
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:34.520]  saying you're above even reproach it cannot be criticized so the fact that
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:37.480]  you say corporate America standing with me I thought the establishment was
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:42.760]  shaking in its boots it's great that corporate America is standing with me
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.840]  and the rest of my friends because when you come against any one of us whether
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.400]  it be me or anybody else you're coming against all of us and I think it's
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.840]  important that we stand together it's both corporate and civic America to take
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:56.240]  action against these people and show them that they cannot push us around
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.400]  especially when we're all we're trying to do here is save lives and when people
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:04.000]  try to distract like Laura's trying to do right now from what the real issue here
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.920]  is which is gun violence in America it's not only sad it's just wrong from a
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.880]  journalistic standpoint I would say that she needs to be more objective and
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:17.520]  needs to stand down because I am not the issue here the issue needs to be gun
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:23.400]  violence in America trying to do so she needs to stand down and stop saying you
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:27.560]  were whining saying why haven't I been led into a college I mean that is whining
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:31.360]  and the fact you're funded by Soros and Nazi collaborator and the fact you're
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.280]  up there saying we're shaking in our boots you are in an arena so now you
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:39.200]  want somebody sponsors taken because they disagree with you hog now you're
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.480]  against the First Amendment just like CNN and your name tried to get me
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:46.800]  removed off of YouTube and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of publications
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:55.920]  over and over again piled on saying why isn't he banned yet that's in between
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:04.360]  him celebrating on Reddit that mosquitoes are killing billions of humans
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:08.680]  student activists concerned for life not so apparent in online comments I want to
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.760]  retweet that at real Alex Jones I want to get that story out that is big we need
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:19.960]  to force that out now here's hog saying the establishment is shaking in its
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:24.200]  boots no the establishment has armed guards the establishment wants the
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:30.120]  general public disarmed here it is if you listen real close you can hear the
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:35.400]  people in power shaking they've gotten used to being protective of their
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:41.720]  positions doing safety the safety of inaction inaction is no longer safe
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:54.440]  and to that we say no more now I'm gonna point this out right now mr. hog if you
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:58.400]  really care about public health why would you want mosquitoes to kill
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:01.160]  billions of people if you want to save every human life you care people so much
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:07.880]  why is the left always so pro-abortion pro depopulation pro eugenics but we
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:11.360]  turn our guns in because 40-something young people die year in mass shootings
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.520]  that's too many but still a very rare form of death why is that but let me draw
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:22.240]  your attention to CBS news with the whitewash headline but you can read the
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:27.520]  article there's thousands of these articles out right now top researchers
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:33.960]  mr. CBS news have done a big study where cell phones are giving rats all sorts of
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:40.160]  cancers you go read the study CBS news can cell phones cause cancer experts
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:46.240]  surprised by the latest test seven paragraphs later I'm sorry eight
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:51.200]  paragraphs later they tell you because they don't want the headline out there
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:54.480]  cell phones give you cancer it's always the same of the thousands of studies
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:58.360]  it's always do cell phones give you cancer and then later well yet does miss
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:02.680]  no big deal they say they found clear evidence that phone radiation caused
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:07.080]  tumors in the hearts of rats which were similar to tumors in people formerly
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:12.640]  tumors that didn't exist it's all these new cancers in humans it's seen in the
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:18.320]  vestibular nerve in the ear the acoustic nerve we found in the heart yet
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:21.960]  particularly affects nerves because they're electrochemical although our
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:28.360]  animals were exposed in their whole body condition John Butcher said while a
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:32.880]  given animal is not making a cell phone call they are throughout their short
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:36.920]  two-year lifespan getting the same exposure that we expect people to get said
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:41.840]  the doctor of environmental health trust and it just goes on from there and it
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:45.880]  goes into all the brain tumor lawsuits
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:52.080]  ladies and gentlemen they have hundreds of studies on just the fact that
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:56.720]  there's a new type of brain tumor you get as they just said on that particular
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:01.360]  nerve that goes into the brain and it starts right there in the nerve and it's
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:07.120]  whatever side of the head you tend to hold it to Ted Kennedy you name it I
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:13.120]  mean these tumors these types of tumors were not even happening 50 years ago
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.440]  cancer doctors would get on an airplane to fly across the country to see a child
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:23.320]  with cancer now they're go them all every fifth child's got a shaved head and
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:30.200]  injector bags on them for the chemo or you'll go in a restaurant there's a
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:33.080]  party for a kid and they're they look like they're about to die you tell
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:38.400]  their own chemo and it's just like you can't eat your dinner anymore and you
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:43.600]  know it's all of this and it's in the literature and it's a fact their
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:47.520]  studies on women that use cell phones and are in houses with Wi-Fi while they're
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:54.280]  pregnant lower IQs more deformities higher levels of cancer all of it but
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:57.600]  they tell us don't worry about it do it do it do it be part of it don't worry
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:59.880]  about it
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:07.880]  even though I know all this and I've told them I want wiring into all the
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:12.560]  computers we got a plug into a computer we've got a wireless this building because
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:16.920]  I haven't gotten angry enough I haven't demanded enough at my house I had wires
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:21.000]  put in everywhere the last two houses no one plugs into them no one uses them I
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.160]  said use a laptop use an iPad use a computer desktop don't use your phone
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:29.360]  well you know what the phones are going because everybody's habituated to them
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:33.200]  and the Wi-Fi is going I don't care if it's a better system for the cameras I
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:41.040]  don't care it's killing us I can't even control myself because like that global
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:46.120]  has told me off record Alex the public's going to adapt to what we're doing to
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:49.560]  them they're not gonna adapt to resist it you don't get what adaptation means
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:58.720]  and I'm like oh my god well you know what I am gonna buck it I know all this
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:10.160]  stuff and I can't even stop it for my own family so David Hogg you need to
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:12.160]  realize if you want to talk about something that's killing millions of
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:18.520]  people not 40 something how about you talk about radiation how about we have
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:21.840]  walkouts at schools over cell towers on top of schools how about we have
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:26.160]  walkouts over cell phone radiation how about we have walkouts over all of that
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:31.000]  because this is what kills thousands of times what guns do every year and this
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.600]  is how the globalists in this silent invisible Holocaust are killing
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:38.160]  everybody in their plan and the globalists have these Wi-Fi free
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:41.160]  retreats out in the middle of the wilderness that they're living in a lot
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:44.040]  of the top billionaires are moving the middle of nowhere as I've told you and
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:53.720]  this is now admitted northern Canada Kauai Hawaii Tasmania New Zealand and you
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:58.080]  read about these Wi-Fi free elite resorts and Wi-Fi communities that are
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:04.680]  Wi-Fi free and they're all hardwired hardwired the if you go to Zuckerberg's
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.400]  house and you look at even some of the photos they try to control I've seen it
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:13.960]  it's plugged in plugged in plugged in plugged in because then the radiation is
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:19.720]  chained down through that electron chain it is not just blasting out like a
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:23.280]  irradiation bomb
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:37.560]  I hope you listen to me and I beg you listen for your family because these

[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:55.600]  dot com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:06.880]  there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones for example
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:14.960]  here's the appearance
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:43.960]  I will not let you down, you will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:56.960]  Volcanic racism has violently erupted and yet the media would have us all quietly look away from the urgency to write the dissent into madness.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:17.960]  Deeming the increasing chaotic situation of far-right conspiracy even after the testimony of brutality on boar farmers in South Africa has been documented over and over including graphic acts involving horrific evil child torture and the raping of entire families followed by slow executions.
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:35.960]  The elderly couple that had boiling water poured over them or the elderly gentleman who recently got locked up in his Ford truck and trussed up and then the truck set on fire and burned to death or the little girl who was raped, the four-year-old girl who was raped by three men survived it.
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:02:01.960]  And because she survived, you know, this was proven in the post-mortem autopsy, she was then bundled up in newspaper with gasoline poured over it and then set on fire or the girl who was crucified on her parents kitchen table and then raped a three-year-old girl in this instance, a three-year-old girl raped by four men while crucified to her parents kitchen table after her father had had his throat slit and her mother being killed as well.
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:12.960]  Hall's husband, David, was murdered in this farm six years ago. She witnessed the murder. Her hands were tied as the intruders also ransacked the farm.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:30.960]  So why must I give up my farm? Well, I bought it legally. I paid every single penny I over it. Every implement I bought on this farm I paid for. I've worked for everything I've got. Now I'm just handed over. It doesn't seem fair.
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:44.960]  My little girl put up her hand and she said, but I've got a piggy bank. You can take my money. My husband said to the police and the one guy said, oh, just kill him, brother. And they shot him between the eyes in front of us.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:03:02.960]  They came with an eye, a normal clothing eye. They burned me on my leg, telling him that they're going to hurt me if he doesn't open the safe. And he tried again and then they burned him on his back.
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:19.960]  I was shot two times here and once here in the neck and went outside my head. Still, the South African communist grip on a white narrative spearheaded by a fantasy of white privilege, a sentiment left over from apartheid,
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:40.960]  allows South African leaders to continue to openly threaten white people. They must come to Australia. If they want to go, they must go.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:52.960]  Recently, social media comments referring to white farmers made by Major Malala of the South African National Defense Force echoed the lunacy, quote, apartheid is in him.
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:04:02.960]  All of these old white people think we are stupid when they say they were opposed to apartheid. We will not forget what they have done. Now it is the white people's turn.
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:10.960]  In fact, the whitest of white albinos are essentially hunted for their supposed magic properties in Africa.
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:19.960]  The South African reports a traditional healer who allegedly killed two children with albinism appeared in a whit bank court last month.
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:28.960]  Following that, the grave of an albino local was dug up in Piyarnar near White River. His hands and right foot had been cut off.
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:42.960]  The unsettling craziness appears to be a world away, but its reverberations can be felt here in the U.S. where the far left would relish in the prospect of igniting a campaign of the same misguided hatred
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:49.960]  and its bid to divide and conquer humanity. John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:05:06.960]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy. We went out and looked at what the top neutropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:19.960]  And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best, we'll just put even more product in, we'll make it better.
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:25.960]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60, we put $10 in it, and sell it for $30. It's $19.95 right now.
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:36.960]  We get an incredible top-of-the-line neutropic for $19.95. Believe me, when we're selling it for $35 on average, we need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it.
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:46.960]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks. I want to shell it all out before the big supply comes in, and I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why.
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:56.960]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews. It's amazing. Infowarsstore.com, InfowarsLive.com, or AAA-2533-139.
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:30.960]  All right, I did a lot of preparation last night and this morning for the broadcast, and I've only covered a thimble of the information because I went off on a jag about the Mark of the Beast, and world government and all these studies
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:49.960]  submitting cell phones are causing massive increases in cancer, and they're claiming, though, that they just discovered this. They've got a formula where it's like, oh, we just discovered, we just discovered so that when your son or daughter gets cancer, you get cancer, you have this idea, like, oh, they didn't know before, they just now learned.
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:07:06.960]  So I'm sending my limited team, and I'm not complaining, but I need, like, a couple full-time people to be able to go to the UT Law Library and others and pull microfish because it's so powerful to show how stuff was reported 20, 30 years ago and to show how they just now claim they learned about it.
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:25.960]  Oh, there is a world government. Oh, the Vatican does want a one-rule government and says, Jesus wasn't Christ, and there's no hell. Oh, they just said that. No, they've been pushing it forever, and now they're just going full bore with it.
[02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:45.960]  So it's incredible. I want to take phone calls for the balance of the hour. The number for you to join us is 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539. You know, so much mainstream media misrepresents what I say and what I do because I'll get up here on air, and when I know something and I know a fact, I'll say it.
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:58.960]  But a lot of times I go, I don't know what's up with David Hogg saying he wasn't at the school and rode three miles and saying he was there and shooting videos during the supposed shooting.
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:07.960]  So the fact that when I don't know what's going on, and I'm just saying we should investigate this, this doesn't make sense. They then just project onto that whatever they want. Fine.
[02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:20.960]  So I want to explain this again because it's so critical. I'm not trying to win a popularity contest. I'm trying to get people thinking.
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:33.960]  I'm trying to talk about unpopular things that are unpopular in mainstream media to break the ice, and that's how we set the trends. That's how we make it safe for other people to come behind us.
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:46.960]  It's true. We are shock troops. That's what M4 Wars is. We're the first people to hit and to see how the enemy is going to get drawn out and to just get the job done.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:55.960]  And that's what M4 Wars is. That's what Prison Planet is. That's what News Wars is, and that's why it needs your support because it is the tip of the spear.
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:09:09.960]  And if you won't desert us what you haven't done, we'll continue to change history together and we'll continue to draw them out, and you will see their attacks become more and more overt, which again only illustrates everything we've said.
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:21.960]  We were the first to tell folks about the world government, the first to tell people about cell tower cancer, the first people to tell folks about the TPP and the IMF and the World Bank and the whole globalist program and how the globalists are in a pedophilia and devil worship and all this stuff.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:40.960]  Because everybody else that researches it knows it, they're scared to say it. Because 23 years ago when I went on air, there were a few researchers and a few people that had figured it out and they got killed.
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:45.960]  They got murdered.
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:56.960]  And I remember calling up, talking to their wives, people that wrote articles about the globalists and their master plan and their world government plan and their eugenics plan.
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:09.960]  And man, I mean, person after person on an interview, when I first got on air, ended up getting shot in the back of the head, walking out to the grocery store in the middle of nowhere, small town, or fell down stairs and broke their neck or whatever.
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:16.960]  And then I got the messages, hey, you see what happened to Jim Keith? We'll kill your ass too.
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:20.960]  And that made me realize how real it was.
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:25.960]  And I said, well, there's no future if we don't fight this thing.
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:47.960]  So you see Trump, who's trying to guide this giant evil swamp and trying to just turn the productivity back on, admit free press is okay, promote free speech, break the back of little correctness, initiate nationalism again, which is the beginning of pulling away from globalism, killing TPP, all the things he's done.
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:57.960]  You look at this and then you see him in Rasmussen at 50 points.
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:03.960]  50 points.
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:20.960]  You know, I look at that picture of Hillary where they've added a pentagram in horns. You don't even need it. That's the face she makes like a great white shark emerging out of the water.
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:29.960]  And then there's just those of us that pick up their will and see their will and go, man, that's really nasty and dirty. I'm going to have to fight that.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:34.960]  Not because we're heroes, but these people are evil.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:42.960]  And an instinct as a man is trying to take care of your family is you got to fight.
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:52.960]  So that's where we stand, ladies and gentlemen, and CNN mocked for glorifying JFK's legendary infidelity after harping on sexual allegations against Trump.
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:12:01.960]  Yeah, Trump didn't say that he was Dudley. Perfect. And I'm sure it'd be better if he was.
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:06.960]  She got Mike Pence, if that's what you're really into.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:13.960]  If you will care about what Trump did 10, 11, 12 years ago or whatever. Oh, he was nice to me. Oh, he had sex once. Oh, my God, he's a devil.
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:18.960]  And oh, it's a full grown woman. That's why they don't like Trump.
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:23.960]  He's just normal. Doesn't mean he's not worldly. Doesn't mean he's perfect. He's just not out to get you.
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.960]  He had into kids. He didn't get on Jerry Epstein's plane with little kids. He's not involved in all that.
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:36.960]  He's not into spirit cooking. He's into hamburgers.
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:46.960]  And he's into fighting scumbags. Trump doesn't like scumbags and he's going to show them.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:53.960]  People fundamentally get the beyond hypocrisy of this and they're angry about it.
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.960]  And that's why Trump's poll is up. They know he's under attack. They've figured out what's going on.
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:04.960]  There's a story here on info wars.com by Kit Daniels.
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:09.960]  Shot poll. A majority of Dems don't fully trust mainstream media.
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:11.960]  And it goes through all the numbers.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:20.960]  77% of Americans now believe MSN pushes fake news. And you see authoritarian regimes like Malaysia saying 10-year sentences if the government says it's fake news.
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:24.960]  Oh, well, in a tyranny, of course, they're going to say the truth is fake news.
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:40.960]  So they've made a really reckless bet here in Europe and the United States and other areas that they're going to be able to bully everybody and kick them off Facebook or Twitter or restrict people.
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:47.960]  And that you'll just self censor and go away. No.
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:53.960]  We understand historically if we don't go through some pain now, we lose it all.
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:57.960]  That's why I go back to this fundamental that globalist minions don't seem to get.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:00.960]  So I harp on it all the time now because I want to explain it to them.
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:08.960]  If you take my sponsors or you sue me or even you shut me down, do you understand I've already won getting the message out and ringing the alarm?
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:10.960]  That was my job.
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:19.960]  If I get an arrow shot through me because I found traders trying to lower the drawbridge the enemy at night and I ring the alarm and flip the switch or raise it again.
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:26.960]  And then somebody stabs me in the back a trader and I end up dying. Hey, you don't burn the whole castle and my family inside.
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:32.960]  You don't take it all down. I'm not a trader and they just don't get they claim their collectivist.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:38.960]  They are the most satanic individualists you've ever seen because satanism is all about being an individual all about yourself.
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:43.960]  It's a counterfeit of being a real individual who loves individuality and respect for people's individuality.
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.960]  The satanists always want to make other people not individuals.
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:49.960]  They want to make them slaves, but they're this individual that rules their slave masters.
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:50.960]  See, it's all twisted.
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:58.960]  No, you're real individuals, but also you can supersede your individualism for your own personal gain for the larger continuum.
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:03.960]  Realizing you're surfing on all the capital of people that sacrificed before you.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:07.960]  And then it's the holy act. It is the true act.
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:13.960]  It is the act of will to then give yourself to the greater cause that is transcendence.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:17.960]  And then you project forward into your children and others and building a better world.
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:22.960]  And that is the real majesty of God's plan.
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:26.960]  Then there's no more fear except not following God's plan.
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:29.960]  The only failure is not joining God.
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:35.960]  The only failure is letting the enemy turn you into a coward and caring what they say about you.
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:39.960]  Why do you care what zombies and devil worshipers and pedophile and scum say to you?
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:44.960]  And why do you care what they even do to you when you're fighting them to defend the innocent?
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:47.960]  You should fear them getting the whole world.
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:51.960]  But more than that, you should fear in the eyes of God failing.
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:54.960]  God's looking on. Fear God, not man.
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:57.960]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.

[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:25.960]  And now, Alex Jones.
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:29.960]  Alright, I'm going to Alex, Rob, Uncle Sam, Bill, Debra, Manny,
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:33.960]  Forrest, Pastor Sam, Jeff, Jason, everybody, right now.
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:36.960]  Just the bottom line is this.
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:38.960]  This is a spiritual war.
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:42.960]  That just means other dimensions, which they've mathematically proven.
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:49.960]  Top scientists, NASA has found power sources many times more powerful than this dimension,
[02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:51.960]  holding everything in place.
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:53.960]  All these billionaires are coming out.
[02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:57.960]  Heads of Bank of America came out and said, this is all false.
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:20:59.960]  We're in a prison. There's an outside God controlling it.
[02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:03.960]  The mathematics shows it. We're going to break out of it.
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:07.960]  That is directly Lucifer talk.
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:12.960]  And you just realize that that's what we're really on.
[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:14.960]  A planet as a test.
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:17.960]  Here in the third dimension.
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:22.960]  And the globalists believe they've got to kill everybody to get total control.
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:24.960]  And this is what they really say.
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:26.960]  This is what Elon Musk is warning you of.
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:32.960]  This is what the Pentagon now knows is going on.
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:37.960]  And that's why the Pentagon, everybody else has resonated.
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:38.960]  It's actually in the know with his broadcasts.
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:44.960]  Because they know I'm not just sitting here saying stuff to be shocking.
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:47.960]  Now we've got the first caller here.
[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:50.960]  Rob in Chicago says brain cancer from cell phones.
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:52.960]  Says he knew about at the 70s.
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:55.960]  I read it in USA Today in 1988.
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:22:00.960]  I was a high school freshman because I remember arguing with people saying,
[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:02.960]  no, I read in USA Today and give you cancer.
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:05.960]  And they said, oh, they wouldn't let that happen.
[02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:08.960]  And the point is, it's like a notice, a legal notice they put in the paper.
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:13.960]  Or it's like a notice on the cigarette packs known to the surgeon in general and give you cancer.
[02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:15.960]  They're always written the same.
[02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:17.960]  Again, I have seen no exaggeration. Everybody's seen it.
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:18.960]  Remember this.
[02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:20.960]  Ruber says he hopes you don't have a memory.
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:24.960]  Thousands and thousands.
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:26.960]  I mean, I've seen like 15 today.
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:29.960]  You guys printed me a big stack of them saying first time.
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:31.960]  It's proven it causes brain cancer.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:34.960]  Look out.
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:37.960]  And I've seen that they always say that like they just discovered it.
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:45.960]  And it's the psychological warfare deal where they want to be able to say, oh, we're just warning you.
[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:47.960]  So the idea is we just learned.
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:52.960]  We just learned so that when you get the brain tumor subconsciously 30 years from now, 20 years from now,
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:55.960]  five years from now, you go, oh, we just learned.
[02:22:55.960 --> 02:22:58.960]  See how evil they are.
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:00.960]  There's a big Sinclair video.
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:02.960]  And I'm not even saying Sinclair is the worst thing on the planet.
[02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:07.960]  They're based out of here at Texas, but it showed how hundreds of Sinclair TV channels have the exact same script,
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:08.960]  the exact same words.
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:09.960]  It's a viral video right now.
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:10.960]  Marley gave it to me last night.
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:11.960]  I meant to give it to you guys.
[02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:12.960]  You can look it up.
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:14.960]  But it just shows at the end.
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:20.960]  It shows like it's almost 100 TV screens all together and then all in unison saying the same thing.
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:21.960]  There it is.
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:22.960]  Sinclair media.
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:25.960]  Dozens of local news anchors recite the same script.
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:26.960]  No, it's not dozens.
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:29.960]  That's the next, the last video file.
[02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:30.960]  It shows the last one.
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:32.960]  It's got to be 100 up there.
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:39.960]  But the point is, I love the New York Times telling people.
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:44.960]  I love the New York Times telling people that there's talking points when they're the kings of it.
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:45.960]  And that's where it rolls downhill.
[02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:46.960]  By the way, go back to that page.
[02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:50.960]  I remember reading, they changed the headline about repeal of the Second Amendment and scroll down.
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:51.960]  There it is.
[02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:52.960]  Scroll down.
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:57.960]  They said, oh, we never said, yeah, go back to the main page or it had a box of other articles below it.
[02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:59.960]  And I've forgotten to get to that too.
[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:01.960]  They changed the headline.
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:06.960]  When you go to that article about repeal of the Second Amendment, they changed it because that, see, that didn't work right.
[02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:07.960]  They were testing with you.
[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:09.960]  It's all psychological warfare.
[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:10.960]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:13.960]  And you have to figure out why am I being given this talking point?
[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:20.960]  I'm not even sure why since 1988, when I first paid attention, they always say, we just learned.
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:22.960]  We didn't know.
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:23.960]  We just learned.
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:37.960]  But it's so when you get the brain tumor or the heart tumor, when you learn about this, you'll just remember they just learned.
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:38.960]  That's the message.
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:39.960]  That's the headline.
[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:40.960]  They just learned.
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:41.960]  They just learned.
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:42.960]  They just learned.
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:45.960]  So you have to look at each PR piece and go, what am I being given here?
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.960]  What is the agenda behind that?
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:49.960]  And you think of that as exhausting.
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:50.960]  It's not.
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:51.960]  It's what your brain's meant to do.
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:54.960]  When you just accept stuff, you get Alzheimer's.
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:55.960]  You get neurological disorders.
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:24:59.960]  But when you make your brain go, what is that I'm being given?
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:05.960]  That's what builds your brain, just like a muscle.
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:09.960]  To the point now, I could be with top, I'm not even bragging, top lawyers.
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:10.960]  And I'll say, this is the legal argument.
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:11.960]  And this is the thing.
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:12.960]  And they go, well, how'd you know that?
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:14.960]  That's actually the top Supreme Court case.
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:15.960]  I go, I don't need to know it.
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:17.960]  I know what logic is.
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:18.960]  And they go, you're right.
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:23.960]  Now all the logic of previous laws being assaulted with disinformation and false logic.
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:25.960]  And that's what this all is, is jamming logic.
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:27.960]  We all know what common sense is.
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:28.960]  We all know what's good.
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:29.960]  We all know what's right.
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:34.960]  We all instinctively understand the globalists are the enemy, not the Russians.
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:37.960]  That's why they want to bombard us and bully us into just fine.
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:38.960]  I'll give in to whatever you say.
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:40.960]  No, that's death.
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:41.960]  All right.
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:42.960]  I said I go to your calls and I apologize.
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:44.960]  Robin Chicago on brain cancer.
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:47.960]  I see in the comment you say you knew about this in the 70s.
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:48.960]  Tell me about it.
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:49.960]  Absolutely.
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:50.960]  Absolutely.
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:53.960]  And what I didn't mention of the screeners, in fact, I am a brain tumor survivor.
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:54.960]  Wow.
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:55.960]  Yes.
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:26:01.960]  But I was an amateur radio operator and we knew about this in the 1970s.
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:03.960]  And we all were shielding our equipment.
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:07.960]  Evidently, it didn't help me much, but I'm still here.
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:11.960]  Well, I talked to a good friend of mine who's getting up there in years.
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:12.960]  We ought to get him in studio.
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:13.960]  He's a pretty humble guy.
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:20.960]  But he was an army officer in North Africa in, I'm trying to remember the exact, see,
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:23.960]  I always get to tell these stories and they kind of get weird because I tell you the exact
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:24.960]  story.
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:25.960]  And I think I have the story.
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:26.960]  I'm trying to pull it up.
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:31.960]  It was what's the Christian country in Africa where a lot of people are actually Jewish.
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:34.960]  What is the name of that?
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:35.960]  The ancient African.
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:36.960]  Yeah.
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:39.960]  Well, they think the Holy, where they think the Ark of the Covenant may be hidden.
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:41.960]  Gosh, now I've had one of those neurotic moments.
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:43.960]  You just pull up a, it's not Ethiopia.
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:44.960]  It's Ethiopia.
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:45.960]  Okay.
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:46.960]  Ethiopia.
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:51.960]  And he was stationed for several years, super clandestine radio station, transmitting
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:55.960]  to operatives on secret bands, but also picking up Russian transmissions out of the Middle
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:56.960]  East.
[02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:03.960]  And he said, this was in the late 60s, they got manual saying, don't tell the rest of
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:08.960]  the men that they've been around something that could literally kill you on site.
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:12.960]  These, these, these transmitters are so powerful and these microwave relays are so powerful
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:16.960]  and have the shieldings going to be shipped to you, put it up, but tell them, tell them
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:19.960]  it's because the equipment's classified now and they can't touch it or something.
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:21.960]  Just tell them some BS story.
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:26.960]  And that was, and he was like, wow, we were already putting our cans of beans on top of
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:28.960]  it to heat it.
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:31.960]  And he said almost all those guys he knew died of cancer.
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:34.960]  He didn't even know that was going on, but he was an officer, so he wasn't running the
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:37.960]  transmissions or servicing them, but he got cancer from it later.
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:38.960]  So think about that.
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:40.960]  Heating the beans on it, brother.
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:41.960]  Go ahead.
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:45.960]  You can only imagine what the heart transmitters are doing up in Alaska.
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:46.960]  Exactly.
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:47.960]  I'll shut up.
[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:48.960]  You've got the floor.
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:49.960]  Tell people about what happened to you.
[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:50.960]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:57.960]  No, just the long story short, I was an electrician by trade, but I, I ended up with a brain tumor
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:00.960]  in 1985, which is several years later.
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:03.960]  And I was fortunate enough to survive.
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:04.960]  I'm still here.
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:06.960]  And thank God.
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:11.960]  I think God was watching me because I ended up with one of the top three neurosurgeons in
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:12.960]  the country.
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:13.960]  Well, that's a blessing.
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:16.960]  I'm going to hold you over because I want to hear from you about this.
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:17.960]  What is it like for you?
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:21.960]  I mean, you're saying, did the doctors admit to you that they thought it was electromagnetic
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:22.960]  cause cancer?
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:30.960]  No, no, they never said what the cause was or could be, but, you know, it's a speculation
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:40.960]  on my part because I know that electronics, microwave radiation can cause brain tumors.
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:44.960]  So you just put one, two and two together and kind of figure it out.
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:48.960]  I want to come back and talk about what is it like for you to see the children, all these
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:52.960]  handheld transmitters that are getting stronger and stronger and stronger and are known to
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:54.960]  cause brain tumor.
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:58.960]  Tired of being censored by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Patreon?

[02:29:57.960 --> 02:29:59.960]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:01.960]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:02.960]  Great.
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:03.960]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:07.960]  Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing.
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:08.960]  Thank you.
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:14.960]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got caveman, superman vitality, secret swell,
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:15.960]  vitamin and infusion.
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:17.960]  I've got the body armor.
[02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:18.960]  Wow, thank you.
[02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:19.960]  Wow.
[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:20.960]  It's a pleasure to make it all possible.
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:22.960]  Which pharmaceutical does you like best?
[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:25.960]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:26.960]  That's amazing.
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:27.960]  That's really incredible.
[02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:30.960]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:31.960]  I haven't felt sweet.
[02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:33.960]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:34.960]  And I love the guys.
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:35.960]  I love the info.
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:36.960]  It's true.
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:41.960]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's
[02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:43.960]  on the fence, just buy it.
[02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:44.960]  We'll love it.
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:46.960]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:50.960]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[02:30:50.960 --> 02:30:55.960]  It's a win-win, infowarslife.com.
[02:30:55.960 --> 02:31:00.960]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an
[02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:01.960]  infowars life.
[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:02.960]  It'd take hours.
[02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:04.960]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:05.960]  It's stronger.
[02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:07.960]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:31:07.960 --> 02:31:10.960]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:11.960]  It's back in stock.
[02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:14.960]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:16.960]  It's got the preglonone.
[02:31:16.960 --> 02:31:18.960]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:21.960]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:22.960]  So you can upload it.
[02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:27.960]  And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine
[02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:31.960]  fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:32.960]  That's a spray you do.
[02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:33.960]  You can also swallow it.
[02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:39.960]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:40.960]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:46.960]  So thank you all for remembering InfowarsStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:50.960]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread
[02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:51.960]  the word.
[02:31:51.960 --> 02:31:55.960]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:31:55.960 --> 02:32:01.960]  Infowars Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds.
[02:32:01.960 --> 02:32:02.960]  And for a good reason.
[02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:06.960]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were, what
[02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:08.960]  were most popular, what were best, what people liked.
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:10.960]  And we made it even stronger.
[02:32:10.960 --> 02:32:15.960]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:17.960]  We only have 150 percent.
[02:32:17.960 --> 02:32:19.960]  And then it helps funder operation.
[02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:21.960]  Well, now it's 50 percent off.
[02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:25.960]  That means we've got a 25 percent markup.
[02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:30.960]  And we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in.
[02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:32.960]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:33.960]  But the two go together.
[02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:35.960]  It's the mind and body challenge.
[02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:41.960]  They're both 50 percent off individually or together they're 50 percent off and free
[02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:44.960]  shipping with the combo at infohorselife.com.
[02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:49.960]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell
[02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:50.960]  out.
[02:32:50.960 --> 02:33:19.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:37.960]  So here's the 60 quadrillion dollar question, the thing that's going to kill millions of
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:38.960]  people.
[02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:40.960]  They estimate already killed hundreds of millions.
[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:41.960]  That's in mainline science.
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:45.960]  Because now they're increasing the power of the radiation, the transmitters, the 5G, 6G,
[02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:46.960]  all of it.
[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:51.960]  Why did the scientists know when they were getting cell towers approved in the 80s and
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:57.960]  all of this, and they knew back in the military before that, that you put the transmitter site
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:04.960]  out away from the building because you're getting massive radiation off of that for whatever
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:09.960]  the length of the antenna is, is the basic rule of law, rule of thumb.
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:14.960]  And so if the antenna is 50 feet long, well 50 feet away, you're getting 100 percent of
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:15.960]  that transmission power.
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:19.960]  You can't walk up to a big AM transmitter and grab it.
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:20.960]  It'll burn you.
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:23.960]  You stand up, you'll start throwing up.
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:25.960]  This is not our opinion.
[02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:31.960]  Well, what do you think cell phones are?
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:35.960]  They're high powered microwave relay systems.
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:40.960]  And yeah, if you keep a few feet away from you and use a little wireless thing, there's
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:41.960]  just radio waves to it.
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:42.960]  That's not as bad.
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:43.960]  But it's still terrible.
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:45.960]  It's killing our DNA.
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:46.960]  It's killing our fertility.
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:48.960]  It's causing neurological problems, behavior problems.
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:49.960]  It's linked to it all.
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:55.960]  I remember studies about cell phones and hyperactivity disorder in adults and anxiety disorders 20
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:35:00.960]  years ago.
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:02.960]  Scientific American, all of it.
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:04.960]  They already knew all this.
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:07.960]  It was already tested in rats when they deployed it.
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:08.960]  Why?
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:09.960]  Why?
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:14.960]  I remember DARPA in the, I could never find the article, but it was in the Baltimore Sun
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:19.560]  said we're testing cell phone towers to calm the public with the waves we're sending out
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:23.460]  from the towers, but also through the cell phones.
[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:25.960]  So we're way down the road here in mind control.
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:28.240]  I don't even know 10 percent of it.
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:30.960]  What I know is all public and nightmare level.
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:32.460]  So I said I got 20 calls.
[02:35:32.460 --> 02:35:33.960]  I'll go to you all.
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:36.160]  Let's go ahead and finish up.
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:39.680]  Rob in Chicago said you got brain cancer from being around this stuff.
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:41.680]  Any other points you'd like to add?
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:46.840]  Well, yeah, you, you mentioned exactly what I was going to head toward.
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:48.680]  They want to use this as a calming effect.
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:55.240]  Well, I'll tell you what, my son was here with his family just this week and everybody
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:36:00.720]  is, you know, it was sitting around the table and they all had cell phones in their hand
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:04.200]  and they're all staring at it like mind numbed robots.
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:05.200]  It was great.
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:10.960]  I go down to big bed once a year when I have time and I feel so calm and so serene because
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:12.880]  there's no, there's no cell phone.
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:17.480]  There's not wireless there and it's so refreshing, little wired thing they got at the hotel.
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:19.440]  The website takes like a minute to load.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:21.000]  It's so good.
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:24.520]  And I just want to lead a, you know, I'll lead a revolution against this crap because
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:25.520]  we know it's evil.
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:30.880]  We know it's bad and I know that I'm diverting my energy even into defending the second amendment
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:34.680]  or any of this because that's all secondary now and I'm still going to defend it against
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:38.720]  the electromagnetic, the GMO, isn't that the big enchilada?
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:41.080]  It sure sounds like it.
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:44.560]  It sure sounds like it and they're hurting us there like, like sheep.
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:46.040]  God bless you, Rob.
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:47.040]  I'm glad you survived.
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:50.280]  You sound like a great patriot, great soul and I want to be clear.
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:53.920]  I'm going to go to the second amendment, the first amendment, 110%.
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:59.440]  But the first amendment is more important than the second because it, it, it's what
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:02.920]  allows you to communicate and warn people and to raise the alarm.
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.760]  I can always get guns as long as I can raise the alarm.
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:09.320]  The butternut brigade is it's known the ball peen hammer, but I mean, I can get as many
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:13.600]  guns as I need, just like lickety split because I've got the will to defend my family and
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:16.120]  will is unstoppable and spirit behind it.
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:23.200]  But ladies and gentlemen, it's the electromagnetic, it's the TVs, it's the smartphones, it's the
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:26.520]  screen sickness that I coined that term.
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:27.920]  It's the screen sickness.
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.860]  That's they, the globalists are afraid with this audience that I might actually start
[02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:32.860]  doing some good.
[02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:37.240]  Cause I'll tell you, I've been really retrospective and we've done maybe 20% of what we could
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:40.640]  if I really got conscious and focused on this.
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:45.680]  And if you do too, and maybe you agree with maybe you don't, but I just, I just, my God,
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:48.280]  the facts are in and we've got to do something.
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:49.280]  Don't we?
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:51.600]  And then it makes me not even hate David Hogg.
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:53.520]  He is a fallen, twisted person.
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:55.520]  They've chosen for this.
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:56.520]  Okay.
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:58.160]  Who's up next here?
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:06.840]  Alex and Uncle Sam, we got a Debra, let's go to Debra and Michigan Debra.
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:08.840]  Thanks for holding it awesome.
[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:10.840]  Hi, Alex.
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:11.840]  Hi.
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:18.080]  Um, I had a, I had three points I wanted to say, um, first I thought it wasn't really
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:24.400]  interesting that the Pope said something along Easter a few years after Obama slamming
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:31.680]  Easter, can you believe that, that Apple and Google have banned Weester?
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:32.680]  They won't promote it.
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:33.680]  They won't put it on calendars.
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:34.680]  They won't link to it.
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:38.720]  They wouldn't even mention it with their thingy called, uh, the doodle they put at the top
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:39.720]  of Google.
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:43.320]  I mean, they'll do it for communist and people that support bin Laden, you name it, but not
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:44.320]  anything Christian, man.
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:45.320]  They hate us.
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:46.320]  Why is it?
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:51.000]  Because the, the, the, the, because it is, there's not just the evil transmission.
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.480]  It's God's holy ghost that is a transmission for us to pick up and fight this.
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:57.720]  We have the intel to beat them.
[02:38:57.720 --> 02:38:58.720]  We've been given the intel.
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:00.040]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:02.680]  God wouldn't leave us here and not give us the intel to win this.
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:04.720]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:06.320]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:07.320]  100%.
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:09.320]  Um, I saw it.
[02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:14.920]  David Hogg reminds me of Lord of the Flies.
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:18.120]  He's just out of control.
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:23.240]  The leftist, I know, uh, Jonathan Till of the Statesman said he just comes off as really
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:24.240]  nasty and evil.
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:26.240]  He just, there's something grasping.
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:30.240]  I mean, the way he turned and did that fascist salute and clicked his heels, he did it better
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:31.240]  than a matador could.
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:33.200]  It's just kind of a rip off of a matador.
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:35.200]  I mean, he did it better than Mussolini or Hitler.
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:38.840]  The way he did it was like, whoa, that, that, that's, that's something, the power he was
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:40.560]  getting off on the people.
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:43.960]  He wasn't like streaming back to the people, all of them together with power.
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:48.640]  It was all them mindlessly chanting and him really, that's what satanic energy is, is
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:49.640]  not giving back.
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:51.320]  He was just sucking off their energy.
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:53.320]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:54.960]  And his face is always scary.
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:56.680]  I've never seen a smile.
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:01.520]  Um, I don't like the looks of him in his eyes at all.
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:07.400]  Um, another point I wanted to make, I, I think, I feel like this, um, this group of people
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:12.480]  heading to our border, it reminds me of Japan bombing Pearl Harbor.
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:17.280]  Uh, Trump has got to put some, some troops down there, uh, we're being, we're being
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:18.280]  attacked.
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:19.280]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:24.360]  I'm not against poor Hondurans in their horrible form of government and, but, but yes, Soros,
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:30.320]  the UN, funding this group, the, the UN was based in Honduras running the, the, the immigration
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:32.080]  program under Obama.
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:33.080]  Trump pulled us out of that last year.
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:34.720]  It was the UN running the vetting.
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:38.400]  That's why all these criminals and jihadis were coming in and just as an American, I
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:43.440]  hear there's thousands of people to set the precedent and the legend, just like the Zodiac
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:48.280]  boats out of North Africa into Italy and, and into Macedonia and into other areas.
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:49.280]  Exactly.
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:51.640]  They're announcing, we're coming in, we're people without borders.
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:53.240]  Well, that's a UN term.
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:54.400]  We're coming.
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:58.320]  And then Mexico opens the doors up to this when they're normally very brutal to immigrants
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:03.200]  and, and they're using these people, but, but like water is a wonderful thing.
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:06.760]  But if a dam breaks, it'll flood you or somebody sticks a fire hose on your throat, it'll kill
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:07.760]  you.
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:08.760]  I don't hate immigrants.
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:16.040]  I don't hate them individually, but they are being used like water to flood us out.
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:19.960]  And this whole methodology is being created of hating America and its racist because the
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:24.000]  future of America is Hispanic, because Hispanics have kids and we're powered to them.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:28.320]  Then come into the ethos of free market and freedom, which you historically as families
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:32.320]  follow pro family, pro free market, but you're always under El Jefe's.
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:36.480]  So break from that and realize the paradigm and don't be followers.
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:41.600]  Exactly, they're, they're, they're expendable and they're being used.
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:45.000]  I instinctively want to go to the border and, and because they're going to catch and release
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000]  them.
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  Trump didn't get the funding.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  He can't get funding.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  He's not a dictator from Congress to block it.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:53.080]  And I think Trump should declare an emergency on this with the state government of Texas
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:57.160]  and Arizona and others, and they can do state compact agreements with other states, volunteer
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:04.960]  states like Tennessee and others that are, we, we, I think we can deploy volunteer people
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:07.800]  that are licensed sheriff's deputies or police.
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:11.880]  And I think a lot of them would be ready to do, you know, two week, three week shifts
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:15.720]  down there to stop this because this is a precedent setting assault.
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:16.720]  Yes.
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:17.720]  Yep.
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:18.960]  They're pushing the issue.
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:21.120]  They're pushing Trump into a corner.
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:24.680]  And I think it could very easily be the beginning of us, our civil war.
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:28.120]  Well, that's what they just did this with 10 million Muslims, almost all of military
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:30.200]  age men that they just did this in Europe.
[02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:32.640]  This is the plan.
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:36.880]  This is the assault and we've got a president standing up and his approval rating is like
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:39.160]  65 in the real world folks.
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:41.040]  That's why the left is so scared.
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:42.040]  Trump's at 65.
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:45.920]  Notice he keeps going up in the polls, up, up, up, up, even their fake polls.
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:46.920]  He's at 50.
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:49.000]  Add another 10, 15, 20 points to that.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:50.160]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:51.520]  We have broken their will.
[02:42:51.520 --> 02:42:52.520]  We just don't know it yet.
[02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:59.840]  The reason that for his life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:00.840]  I want products.
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:01.840]  I'm going to use for my family.
[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:06.080]  I take this, my family takes this and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:08.080]  truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:12.640]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at inforwarslife.com.
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:17.200]  If I ever forget to take them, like I'll I have a noticeable difference.
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:18.400]  I don't feel good.
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:22.040]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:24.800]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:30.880]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:31.880]  Very exciting.
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:32.880]  Feeling great.
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:33.880]  Looking good.
[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:37.200]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:39.320]  So obviously the super female is amazing.
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:40.320]  I love it.
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:43.000]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:47.360]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:49.360]  iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:51.600]  It's got a five star rating.
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:55.880]  It's a win-win inforwarslife.com.
[02:43:55.880 --> 02:44:02.200]  I'm so excited the new product at inforwarslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:07.000]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.480]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:15.440]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:21.760]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:28.360]  it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae, and I came
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:33.320]  up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO made right
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:39.720]  here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:44.160]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:45.880]  hormones in your glands.
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:48.640]  It is amazing.
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:56.600]  Red pill now available at inforwarsstore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:44:59.400]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:05.760]  It's Myco ZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed to your contract

[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:17.960]  to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off because there's a lot of product and
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:20.040]  a lot of ingredient, Myco ZX.
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:23.160]  It's the other side of the equation, everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:27.400]  are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:31.320]  importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help this place.
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:37.600]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:41.600]  that get in there, it causes all sorts of cirrhosis, well this has got a bunch of concentrated
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:47.680]  herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall, don't wait to start detoxifying

[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:11.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:14.480]  I'm going to go right back to your phone calls, thank you for joining me, and look at some
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:16.520]  of these Drudge Report headlines.
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:21.480]  Spring Swing, Trump 50% approval rating, Zuckerberg slammed by photojournalist, escorted to Facebook
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:27.280]  HQ for breaching CEO's privacy, took pics of him cleaning up dog poo, oh, he's really
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:34.560]  into his privacy, you don't get into his privacy, Grinder, little sex dating sites, sharing
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:37.720]  HIV status of users with companies.
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:42.200]  Oh, you thought you were doing something private there telling people you had HIV doing the
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:46.240]  right thing, they're just going to share that with insurance companies.
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:50.400]  Roseanne ratings go from 18 million to 25 million, there's no other show even had that
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:57.840]  in five years, because they just wanted fair, not one message of brainwashing.
[02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:02.480]  Winnie Mandela, the woman that called for and did kill thousands of black people under
[02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:06.520]  orders, hundreds reportedly in part of raids she was part of, they would hang them around
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:10.920]  other, mainly Zulu's necks and burn them to death, but that's liberal, that's beautiful
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:22.080]  when she does that, she's dead in a box of rocks.
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:25.240]  We're going to go back to your phone calls now, it's just amazing, we have a president
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:31.960]  warning of a caravan mass invasion from Central and South America coordinated by the UN, who
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:36.600]  was already coordinating the caravans before, Mexico would tell the people you stay on the
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:40.600]  train and on this corridor or you go to jail, it's before you get six months to a year in
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:47.520]  prison for coming to Mexico illegally, unbelievable, all right, who's up next here, let's talk
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:55.560]  to Pastor Sam in the great state of Texas, Pastor Sam, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:58.000]  I'm sorry, your phone's breaking up, try to talk right in it.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:48:59.400]  Got you right here.
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:00.400]  Go ahead.
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:04.640]  I've got a great teaching on the one world religion, Alex, you're right on.
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:10.120]  I just got a copy of a doctor's room course, he's new book, Killing the Deep State, where
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:15.240]  he talks about the CIA drug pandering and its connection to the one world.
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:20.880]  You got to talk right in your phone.
[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:21.880]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:22.880]  Go ahead.
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:30.080]  I've lost my quote from that, but he tells about the CIA running drugs, an HSBC bank,
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:36.440]  laundering the proceeds from the heroin and the Vietnam War and how then that went on,
[02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:42.360]  Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and then finally, Afghanistan.
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:47.600]  I don't know if you know, you're pretty informed, Alex, but Milton Bearden has moved to Austin
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:52.680]  and he's the biggest crocodile in the swamp and the architect of the modern deep state
[02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:56.800]  as told in the movie and book, Charlie Wilson's War.
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:01.800]  He's the one that set up the whole CIA military operation there in Afghanistan.
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:04.080]  Did you know you had him for a new neighbor?
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:05.320]  I did know that.
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:10.880]  I one time went to a swim meet and I realized after I met the people who they were, it was
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:15.880]  Charlie Wilson's right hand guy and all them and it was something else, but had a little
[02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:21.240]  funny conversation with those guys, but yeah, no, you can't swing a stick around here and
[02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:24.560]  I'm not defending the CIA, but it kind of lessens it.
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:30.600]  It's criminal globalist elements within the CIA using the National Security Act in secrecy
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:34.240]  and using the compartmentalization to carry out their criminal operations.
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:38.440]  And so much of the resistance against the globalist with Trump has now been carried
[02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:40.920]  out through the CIA because it's just a vehicle.
[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:46.520]  It's like Trump, they gave all this unconstitutional power to the president for Obama to sell us
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:47.520]  out.
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:49.640]  Will Trump just use that to kill TPP and a bunch of other stuff?
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:50.720]  That's why they're so upset right now.
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:52.720]  Does that make sense?
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:53.720]  Absolutely.
[02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:59.760]  I mean, Milton Beardham is my personal associate and enemy and his second wife, French born
[02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:02.800]  Marie Catherine, teaches at UT in Austin.
[02:51:02.800 --> 02:51:08.440]  So if anyone would wonder why there's such Islamophilia and Antifa in Austin, perhaps
[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:13.960]  it's because the greatest of the deep state Islamophiles has moved there perhaps to retire
[02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:17.600]  in sunny Texas.
[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:18.600]  Good luck for that.
[02:51:18.600 --> 02:51:19.600]  All right.
[02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:20.600]  We appreciate you.
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:24.720]  There's not a lot of Texas left in the state, but for every real Texan, we cannot remember
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:27.520]  them about a one Texan equals about a hundred of the globalists.
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:30.600]  So we'll see how that all works out.
[02:51:30.600 --> 02:51:31.600]  Pastor Sam's funny.
[02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:35.160]  Who's up next here?
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:36.160]  Jason in Florida.
[02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:42.320]  Let's talk about the big leftist, you know, free for all underground thing, DMT that the
[02:51:42.320 --> 02:51:47.960]  government was shelling out the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s of their agents as part of a mind
[02:51:47.960 --> 02:51:52.640]  control operation and now it's the trendy thing to do so that you can get into the spell
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:53.640]  of the globalist.
[02:51:53.640 --> 02:51:54.640]  Go ahead.
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:55.640]  What up, Alex?
[02:51:55.640 --> 02:51:56.640]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:51:56.640 --> 02:51:57.640]  Love what you do.
[02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:58.640]  Yeah.
[02:51:58.640 --> 02:51:59.640]  I did.
[02:51:59.640 --> 02:52:06.680]  I did DMT like a year ago and I think it brought me closer to God and I think that's because
[02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:09.480]  I'm just a positive person and I believe in God, Jesus Christ.
[02:52:09.480 --> 02:52:13.040]  Well, it's about to say I don't want to encourage drug use, but the people that already believe
[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:17.600]  in Christ and are good people, everything generally they have a really good experience.
[02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:20.600]  It's just that people that didn't believe in God already, they instantly, the spirit
[02:52:20.600 --> 02:52:24.560]  guys show up and it's like, it leads down a really bad path.
[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:30.240]  Yeah, that's what I was going to say, I think that these people are already programmed selfishly
[02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:38.680]  and but just an inborn sort of craziness that they receive those transmissions from the
[02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:39.680]  dark side.
[02:52:39.680 --> 02:52:40.680]  Let me ask you this.
[02:52:40.680 --> 02:52:43.120]  What happened when you took DMT, which is the same chemical for those that didn't know
[02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:48.240]  your brain releases on death and at the very deepest levels of sleep, so I just enjoy it
[02:52:48.240 --> 02:52:49.240]  my sleep.
[02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:52.360]  I control my dreams, having huge adventures every night, you know, and everything else
[02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:55.960]  and it is the higher dimensions and it's all plugged in.
[02:52:55.960 --> 02:52:56.960]  It's the internet.
[02:52:56.960 --> 02:52:59.680]  So when I'm asleep for eight hours at nine, I'm, you know, it's the whole internet out
[02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:04.520]  there of the spirit world, which is just, you know, an ancient term for the whole wireless
[02:53:04.520 --> 02:53:07.000]  internet of the brain and everybody else's brains.
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:08.760]  But what happened when you took DMT?
[02:53:08.760 --> 02:53:17.440]  Well, I took a large dose the very first time and broke through and it was just all I can
[02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:23.600]  describe it as would be like a kaleidoscope of every color you could imagine just all
[02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:29.200]  sort of coming together and just beautiful patterns and then I did see entities and they
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:33.520]  were basically communicating with me that I had been there before and that they were
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:40.400]  happy that I was back and after, I don't know what seemed to be a couple of minutes, I started
[02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:46.080]  to feel my body, I couldn't see or feel my body, but I had a sense that I was like really
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:50.120]  like stiffening up with anxiety because I wasn't sure what was going on and couldn't
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:57.400]  remember why I was there and I was basically just approached by a what just all I can describe
[02:53:57.400 --> 02:54:05.400]  was like an Egyptian goddess made of light with about 50 arms and she opened her arms
[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:11.800]  and put it under my chin and got really close to my face and just communicated with me that
[02:54:11.800 --> 02:54:17.720]  everything was going to be okay and to just, you know, it's fine, you know, you ride it
[02:54:17.720 --> 02:54:22.600]  out and basically that just like completely calmed me and I was able to sort of, you know,
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:27.720]  yeah, well, that's that that's what the angels described an angel looking like. Now, that's
[02:54:27.720 --> 02:54:31.840]  an angel. Can you imagine people that there is a room full of daemons?
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:38.840]  Well, that's the thing too is on my third trip. I went into it with it's all about it's
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:43.520]  similar with psychedelics about your mindset and the third trip I went into it and I was
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:48.920]  listening to like some really hardcore metal that day, you know, nothing super dark, but
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:55.920]  it was a little it was more dark. And it's all about how you go into it. And it's really
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:55:00.400]  like it's it's really touchy. Now, you're saying it's what it's what dimension you're
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:05.600]  resonating with? Exactly. And like when the third time I went into it, you know, I didn't
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:11.200]  I didn't really concentrate on like getting into a good, you know, you know, sort of sort
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:16.600]  of aura, you know, feeling about it. And I just went into it, you know, like, you know,
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:20.920]  see, I don't I don't I'm just saying I just I go into room sleep probably six hours a
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:27.120]  night on an hour like most people, it's wall to wall, wall to wall stuff. It's every time
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:32.800]  is the ultimate adventure. I mean, and I know that a lot of this is not my imagination.
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:39.400]  It's like basically a trip around the universe. And man, I have seen some stuff, let me tell
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:42.800]  you. And that's what it's all about. They want to keep everybody frozen off not knowing
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:49.960]  about this. I just want to tell the average person, you know, that that that this is being
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:53.160]  pushed by the globalist. And some people are going to have good experiences, some are going
[02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:56.520]  to have bad. But the Bible says don't take part in pharma key.
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:56:04.840]  Alex, one more question. Yeah, go ahead. Hey, why can't we get like a special military
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:09.920]  unit of guys that are awake? Now, I'm sure you're I'm sure our guys Zach knows about
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:13.800]  guys like that. And my brother was one of those guys, special force guy, why can't we
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:19.680]  get a group of guys, you know, some sort of a battalion and just take out the globalist,
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:25.560]  take out the top of the pyramid. Everything's already surveilled. And so there's people in
[02:56:25.560 --> 02:56:31.680]  mixed into everything. And it's not like you can't just do something at the top physically,
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:35.600]  it's spiritual for everybody. So the fight is all of us individually communicating with
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:40.880]  each other and recognizing what this is. And then its power will fall away. Like flesh
[02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:44.640]  rotting off bones. There are guys at the top. There are guys at the top. I know, but if
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:49.120]  we weren't under their control, if we weren't following them, if we weren't weak, myself
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:52.900]  included, they would have no power. You understand? Well, this is this is coming from somewhere
[02:56:52.900 --> 02:56:58.480]  and they're human. Okay, if we destroy them, it's the good men and women of this world.
[02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:03.560]  Stand up and fight them and destroy them. Then they're done. And it would be an example
[02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:07.680]  for the whole world and the whole universe to see that we're not going to put up with
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:13.400]  these people. And you want to you want to rob humanity blind? You want to arrest development?
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:19.480]  You die. That's it. It's over. You don't you don't listen, listen. I'm not putting you
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:25.040]  down. I'm not saying you're wrong. This whole thing about physically, there are evil globalist
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:29.080]  positions of power everywhere. And then they've got 10 levels deep of minions, even worse,
[02:57:29.080 --> 02:57:33.880]  ready to take your place. And so it's like shark teeth. We have to change ourselves.
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:38.200]  It's an inside job. That's what we have to do with our choices and what we do. I appreciate
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:42.160]  your call, Jason. More calls straight ahead. And then it's Salente hosting. Salente then
[02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:45.240]  Braggen's coming up.
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:50.520]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:55.800]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:57:55.800 --> 02:58:02.520]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:08.400]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:13.800]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:19.160]  trials. And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable
[02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:25.360]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:29.920]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:35.200]  blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:41.560]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com
[02:58:41.560 --> 02:58:46.400]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:50.240]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an
[02:58:50.240 --> 02:58:56.440]  infolwars life. It takes hours. Michael's EX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger.
[02:58:56.440 --> 02:59:01.280]  It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:06.520]  It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months. It's got the preglonone
[02:59:06.520 --> 02:59:10.360]  that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body. Then it's got all the minerals
[02:59:10.360 --> 02:59:14.400]  and the vitamins, the amino acids. So you can upload it. Our latest product that goes
[02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:20.480]  great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine four to five toothpaste is super
[02:59:20.480 --> 02:59:25.320]  blue silver immune gargle. That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement
[02:59:25.320 --> 02:59:31.440]  with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more. Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:59:31.440 --> 02:59:37.160]  So thank you all for remembering infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:40.600]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake. It's so essential to spread
[02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:45.440]  the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution.
[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:14.440]  That was my uncle's first name. We went by Biff.
[03:00:14.440 --> 03:00:19.060]  Forest in Texas. We'll talk about Compromised Defense Intelligence Network. You're on the
[03:00:19.060 --> 03:00:20.060]  air. Go ahead.
[03:00:20.060 --> 03:00:25.480]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that most of our corporations are completely compromised where
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:29.360]  they don't even have to take an oath to the Constitution. These people are more loyal
[03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:34.600]  to that dollar and that shareholder than they are to the nation. What do you think?
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:39.240]  Absolutely. And the Communist Chinese have been allowed control of the infrastructure,
[03:00:39.240 --> 03:00:44.200]  the telecommunications, all the grids that coordinate all the phone systems, the Panama
[03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:49.280]  Canal, the Deepwater ports. I mean, I just hope Trump had to show up a day late, a dollar
[03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:54.280]  short. Americans in mass should be behind him, removing the globalist, removing it all.
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:59.640]  This is insane that the globalist left ally with Communist China has totally screwed this
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:05.760]  country over and the Democrats are protesting Trump trying to just, when China steals 500
[03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:10.160]  million a year from us, a $50 billion tariff telling him to just be more reasonable. They're
[03:01:10.160 --> 03:01:15.040]  like, no. And then I didn't even get to this. It's in the news today. I'll come back in
[03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:19.160]  the next segment. I have to cover it. And China is like, maximize spy attacks, steal
[03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:24.200]  everything the U.S. has got. Well, they've always been doing that, but now they're publicly
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:30.240]  declared war on us and those arrogant communists to look at those guys that our own CIA put
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:37.400]  in power and 49 makes me sick that the left turned China over to these pieces of crap.
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:42.360]  Yeah. It's also another complex. I'd like to add to it. I mean, how long do you want
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:46.000]  to wait before Jeff Sessions actually does something? I mean, we're going to wait 30
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.440]  years until, you know, I mean, I want to clarify this. Hillary Clinton is basically senile
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:55.560]  and insane and has, you know, some set symptoms. If you look at the picture of her, we can't
[03:01:55.560 --> 03:02:02.200]  even beat a senile drug addict. Yeah. I mean, it's not only that, but the majority
[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:06.200]  of the deep state you were talking about activation, you said some about 10 layers deep to the
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:11.200]  last caller. Well, the thing is, is, you know, we could, we could take the fruit. We could,
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:14.480]  you know, you know, chop off the branch, you know, even cut it at a trunk, but the
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:18.360]  roots still lay there. I guess that's your argument. But if we don't do nothing, we're
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:24.160]  already doomed. I mean, I'm pretty sure I'm not pretty sure. I think they're waiting to
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:29.000]  completely conquer us. And maybe this is some sort of asset, like our country's already
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:33.880]  been sold and we're already in debt and China's just making sure. You know, I saw it. Trump
[03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:38.640]  may not even know it, that he's a rearguard action just to make sure that the consolidation
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:42.840]  that the globalists get paid, what they were supposed to selling us out the Chinese effect
[03:02:42.840 --> 03:02:46.120]  more and more. I think that's what it is. And the president doesn't even realize that
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:49.760]  the way this is going and the way they let him go so far, but not is that he's just there
[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:54.360]  to broker that they all get their money for the sell out. Is that what you think?
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:58.480]  Two, we have two steel factories. That's it. And I just want to clarify this even more.
[03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:02.400]  The majority of Chinese steel is the lowest quality steel ever. There are buildings out
[03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:06.840]  there that in other countries would not even be allowed to be, we should be, we should
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:09.840]  be rejecting it on the dock.
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:14.480]  And not, not just that, but this globalism, the libertarian party has been completely
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:16.720]  conquered. The Republicans have been semi-conquered.
[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:19.760]  No, I agree. Most people will do it for the money, brother. And then if you don't take
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:22.840]  the money, they come after you. So look, I hear you, they've been pushing, they've been
[03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:26.440]  pushing, they've been doing things. And, you know, individuals have to do what individuals
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:31.280]  are going to do. And we know these false flags are always targeting innocent groups of people.
[03:03:31.280 --> 03:03:36.360]  But I know this, the globalists go much further. I can just look at the tea leaves. And that's
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:40.120]  why they've already, listen, brother, they've already gone to New Zealand. They've already
[03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:44.880]  gone to Kauai. The globalists are already scared in arm camps with, with airports a
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:50.160]  mile away. They already know, they already know, man. And so it's, I'm just telling you
[03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:57.560]  that you're going to go become a coffee farmer in Kauai. Because, you know, I mean, I mean,
[03:03:57.560 --> 03:04:01.480]  people sit here and talk about what people are going to do. You thought that stuff through.
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:04.960]  You know, you want to grow some crops of your own. You got to get there and kill the soil
[03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:10.520]  and prepare the soil and plant your seeds and wait till the sun comes up. So I think
[03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:13.480]  they already know, they already, they already know, they already know that people are ready
[03:04:13.480 --> 03:04:18.440]  to start killing them. I just don't, I don't think that's the way to go at this point.
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:21.680]  I really think we need to fight them in the info work is the idea of, well, they come
[03:04:21.680 --> 03:04:25.120]  from my guns, I'll fight back or we're going to get them physically someday. It's almost
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:30.600]  like a cop out. You have to engage them in information war now, now, now. Now, the season
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:35.400]  of blood comes, let it rain. If that's what they want, they will get it. But I'm just
[03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:39.640]  telling you right now, they're already soulless. So it doesn't matter. You hack one head off.
[03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:44.000]  The spirit like came out of the possessed man of the pigs. It was just racing to the
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:54.280]  next zombie. They have an unlimited army of husk ready to be avatar right now.
[03:04:54.280 --> 03:04:58.280]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy. We went
[03:04:58.280 --> 03:05:02.640]  out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy
[03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:08.480]  stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula than some of
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:11.600]  the best selling formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and look, look, what
[03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:14.960]  is the top? What is the best? We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it better
[03:05:14.960 --> 03:05:20.480]  leading competitors, but $2 a product in it, sell it for $60. We put $10 in it and sell
[03:05:20.480 --> 03:05:26.320]  it for $30. It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top of the line new tropic
[03:05:26.320 --> 03:05:32.480]  for $19.95. Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average. We need that 15, 20 bucks.
[03:05:32.480 --> 03:05:36.120]  We make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it. But I'm doing
[03:05:36.120 --> 03:05:40.560]  this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks. I want to shell it all out before
[03:05:40.560 --> 03:05:44.640]  the big supply comes in. And I want people that haven't tried brain force to try it
[03:05:44.640 --> 03:05:50.480]  and find out why it's got 6,000 plus five star reviews. It's amazing info wars store.com
[03:05:50.480 --> 03:06:10.040]  or triple A two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex
[03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:15.520]  Jones. All right, Gerald Salent is taking over in like two minutes. I did not plug last
[03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:20.000]  hour. I need to plug because you know, the globalists are after us. Plus we've got really
[03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:23.880]  great products. It's like our information is cutting edge and it's got the whole globalist
[03:06:23.880 --> 03:06:28.720]  combine upset because we're just telling you really what's going on from their own words.
[03:06:28.720 --> 03:06:33.440]  We have great products and bodies need to cut a new bag as we have a new bottle. I said,
[03:06:33.440 --> 03:06:38.000]  why is the bottle red? Turmeric is orange. The average turmeric product out there is
[03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:43.960]  about 50 milligrams and it's 3% of the curcumin and as they call it or the or the chemical
[03:06:43.960 --> 03:06:48.800]  that's in the turmeric that's so anti inflammatory, so good for the cells. It's beginning to get
[03:06:48.800 --> 03:06:52.880]  into all the claims because they'll come after us. Everybody knows about turmeric. We believe
[03:06:52.880 --> 03:06:56.840]  this is the strongest turmeric on the market. The companies that produce it have tested
[03:06:56.840 --> 03:07:01.720]  they said it's definitely the strongest they've ever put out 95% curcumin and rating and then
[03:07:01.720 --> 03:07:09.080]  it's got a bunch of other compounds that supercharge it. It is a multi month supply and it is a
[03:07:09.080 --> 03:07:16.600]  big old bottle of it. 120 capsules. Take one a day bodies, ultimate tumor formula 25% off.
[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:21.120]  We got in this special very soon brain force plus an amazing new tropic. It is about to
[03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:25.000]  sell out but more is coming in a few weeks. We're going to have to end that 50% off. We've
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:29.480]  got cell force 50% off. It's going to be called DNA force plus because it's even stronger.
[03:07:29.480 --> 03:07:34.840]  That's about to sell out. We've got so much there in inforwarstore.com or inforwarslife.com
[03:07:34.840 --> 03:07:38.440]  and we have the real red pill challenge. You can get it with free shipping and 50% off
[03:07:38.440 --> 03:07:42.520]  when you get it with brain force because brain force takes in in 30 minutes. The real red
[03:07:42.520 --> 03:07:46.280]  pill takes about a four or five days. I just say take the seven day challenge because everybody
[03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:50.640]  I know in the reviews say oh Alex is right. Five, six, seven days later, take a few capsules
[03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:54.880]  of this a day. It's got the right amino acids, the right minerals, the right vitamins but
[03:07:54.880 --> 03:08:01.560]  then it's got the preglonone which is esteroid but it's over the counter. It's the precursor
[03:08:01.560 --> 03:08:05.160]  that your body naturally produces that it makes everything else out of. With all the
[03:08:05.160 --> 03:08:09.000]  chemicals and stuff in our diet after about 25 it goes way down. Studies say it didn't
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:14.320]  used to be like that and so you can't even make the hormones without the preglonone.
[03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:20.080]  It's got everything in it that helps you upload it. So inforwarstore.com, inforwarslife.com
[03:08:20.080 --> 03:08:26.760]  or AAA-253-3139 and again you make it all possible in newswars.com, inforwars.com. A
[03:08:26.760 --> 03:08:29.960]  lot of incredible reports breaking up there right now. My son want to do a report on the
[03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:35.000]  cell phones. He did one. That's up there. Big studies out. Cell phones kill more people
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:41.480]  than cigarettes. So a lot is coming out. A lot is going on and Gerald Salente is taken
[03:08:41.480 --> 03:08:46.920]  over. Gerald what do you got coming up today? Let's stay right with the cell phones. That
[03:08:46.920 --> 03:08:55.040]  was one of our top trends for 2016. Clean phones. You're 100% right. People don't realize
[03:08:55.040 --> 03:09:03.280]  how deadly they are. I started working with the cellular telecommunications industry association
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:08.560]  back in the 90s. I did research for them and that's the days when people used to have
[03:09:08.560 --> 03:09:14.000]  these big things in their trunk with the aerial. And I started following the research continually
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:21.320]  since then. And study after study comes out and study after study keeps being pushed down
[03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:27.440]  and hidden. Just like remember those murderers from the tobacco industry telling Congress
[03:09:27.440 --> 03:09:34.040]  in the 1990s, oh no, no, this stuff doesn't kill you. It's good for you. Yeah, remember
[03:09:34.040 --> 03:09:39.280]  that. They're doing the same thing with cell phones. I don't carry one. I only have one
[03:09:39.280 --> 03:09:44.560]  when I travel so I can tell the call where I'm at. Exactly. It's a very limited, dangerous
[03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:48.200]  computer. And so let me ask you this. You picked up. I don't know if you were listening
[03:09:48.200 --> 03:09:53.240]  the first hour, but that's what I asked. Every article I've seen since 1988 when I first
[03:09:53.240 --> 03:09:56.640]  read it in the U.S. today. And I can go look at the studies going back to the 70s. As you
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:10:01.920]  said, can cell phones cause cancer? And then you read the CBS article. It goes conclusively
[03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:08.440]  major top researchers found that it's causing brain tumors, heart tumors, you name it. That's
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:12.640]  exactly what we already knew. But they always say, oh, we just discovered it. So when you
[03:10:12.640 --> 03:10:17.080]  get a brain tumor, you don't get mad no matter what year it is. You think they didn't know.
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:20.400]  And I wonder how they get CBS and all of them, just like they have this new Sinclair video
[03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:24.520]  out where it shows 100 reporters all saying the exact same thing. They put a talking point
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:29.040]  out and even the reporter doesn't know, why is it always they just found out? I think
[03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:33.520]  it's so when you get the brain tumor or the bone cancer or the tongue cancer or whatever
[03:10:33.520 --> 03:10:38.280]  you get from this, you go, oh, well, that's okay. They just found out. But they knew at
[03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:40.360]  the original studies what was happening.
[03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:45.320]  Again, go back to the cigarette industry. You remember when the presidents of the companies
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:51.640]  was testifying before Congress saying there was no proof. And it's like 1998 or something.
[03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:57.800]  So they know. And the reasons why you hear all the propaganda coming out is because their
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:01.760]  prostitutes, they get paid to put out, they get paid to say what they're getting paid
[03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:07.880]  to say. And why isn't Congress doing anything is like he's saying only people that have,
[03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:13.920]  you know, a brain of a two year old know what they call campaign contributions. They're
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:15.920]  called bribes and payoffs.
[03:11:15.920 --> 03:11:18.720]  And let me say this, let me say this. They talked about Joe Campbell in the nineties
[03:11:18.720 --> 03:11:22.480]  and banning him advertising to kids. And I agree. And when I was a kid, they had all
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:27.840]  the gum cigars and the gum cigarettes. And, you know, they're trying to get us habituated,
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:33.560]  turned out the tobacco companies own subsidiaries pushing that this electromagnetic radiation,
[03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:38.800]  all the studies hurts fast growing cells of children even more because it causes fast
[03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:43.360]  growing cells to mutate. Everybody knows radiation hurts children more. You name it. So where
[03:11:43.360 --> 03:11:47.760]  are the groups saying don't advertise cell phones to children? When we know in studies,
[03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:51.760]  they kill more people than cigarettes. Steve Jobs wouldn't have wireless in his home. Bill
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:55.760]  Gates won't have wireless. They wouldn't let their kids have iPhones or iPads. Joe Salente
[03:11:55.760 --> 03:11:56.760]  take it over.
[03:11:56.760 --> 03:12:01.200]  Oh, again, you got it. And I don't have, we don't have wireless here either. I won't
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:06.280]  allow it. And with children's brains, they're much thinner. So now these little kids are
[03:12:06.280 --> 03:12:10.720]  getting addicted to these things at, at a very young age. And the point is going to
[03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:16.880]  become when people say, you know, this is like cigarette smoking. It's killing me.
[03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:22.120]  But they're addicted to it just like they are with cigarettes. When my friends and,
[03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:27.000]  and business people come over here, no cell phone talk aloud as we're doing business or
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.600]  having a good time and don't allow it.
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:30.600]  So anyway,
[03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:33.160]  What I've told my children, I let them have it when they're Ubering and going to a friend's
[03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:37.720]  house. And I say, this is a weapon. It's like cigarettes. Don't wear it on your body.
[03:12:37.720 --> 03:12:41.160]  Put it in a purse. I give them block it pockets, keep it away. They're like, Oh, dad, I keep
[03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:44.040]  showing them the articles. Now some of their other friends, parents are telling them the
[03:12:44.040 --> 03:12:47.920]  same thing, not for me, but separately parents are starting to get this. And yes, it's a
[03:12:47.920 --> 03:12:51.920]  useful tool, but it's very dangerous. Like a firearm. And you've got to understand how
[03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:55.400]  dangerous it is. And it kills more people than firearms ever have.
[03:12:55.400 --> 03:12:59.960]  Well, again, you know, they, they call them smartphones. Like everybody's getting dumber.
[03:12:59.960 --> 03:13:05.000]  They're so addicted to these things. And again, that's one of our top trends. Clean
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:11.920]  phones. The company that comes out with a phone that diminishes or eliminates this kind
[03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:17.240]  of risk is again, that's going to be the was about to say it needs to be a super compressed
[03:13:17.240 --> 03:13:22.000]  encoded radio transmission that is literally one 1000s of the current cell phones. I've
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:24.400]  looked at the numbers. I was already thinking of this. Funny you say this. I've been thinking
[03:13:24.400 --> 03:13:28.440]  of this too. Of course, I read your journal that then sends a radio encoded transmission
[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:33.000]  to another tower. So you're not at point blank range. And then, and then you communicate
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:37.760]  over that that is that will be the next big mega industry.
[03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:42.640]  Yes, if we let it happen, but when you look at the 5g industry, that's coming. Instead,
[03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:47.880]  they're getting more powerful. Exactly. Yeah, it should be getting lower radiation with
[03:13:47.880 --> 03:13:53.040]  the compression. And then there should be laws. Exactly. And not, Oh, unlimited. I want
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:57.320]  to move in a neighborhood that has 10g in it, where I can download five movies a second.
[03:13:57.320 --> 03:14:03.160]  You don't need to do that. And it's cooking your freaking testicles. Hey, by the way,
[03:14:03.160 --> 03:14:07.480]  that's why they call these things handhelds because people are masturbating in public
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:13.200]  with them. They're not communicating anymore. They're so attached to the handheld and that
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:18.440]  so they're not smart. They're showing young men and even young girls are now romantically
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:24.040]  inclined to their cell phone and now want a robot instead of a person. Yeah. So the whole
[03:14:24.040 --> 03:14:29.120]  thing is again, we've taken over by the geeks. Look at their lifestyle. Don't they dress
[03:14:29.120 --> 03:14:34.720]  wonderfully? Don't they have a lot of class? You couldn't get a lower class and we now
[03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:42.080]  they have infused the geek mind, the geek style into general society. We're following
[03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:48.720]  the worst of the worst. Specialized Ash Burgers. They're basically mainlining an autistic Ash
[03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:55.360]  Burgers program on us. You got it. And again, look at the Silicon Con job. One of our top
[03:14:55.360 --> 03:15:01.840]  trends for 2017 was driverless cliff. We said this driverless. There's like a death every
[03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:06.680]  day now all of a sudden as they roll these out, these cars are killing people everywhere.
[03:15:06.680 --> 03:15:12.080]  And they ignored us and they keep ignoring us and we showed what a fallacy it is. So
[03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:17.960]  again, we've been taken over by the geeks and people don't fight back. Here's the deal.
[03:15:17.960 --> 03:15:21.640]  They admit 5G is way more powerful than cell phone. It's giving you cancer. So when they
[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:25.680]  turn this on, they are assaulting you. I'm not calling for this, but people have a right
[03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:29.280]  at a certain point to go out with a rifle and blast these things, man. You can't just
[03:15:29.280 --> 03:15:33.600]  put something that gives you cancer right there and kill everybody. Again, look what
[03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:38.040]  they're doing to the children. Children addicted. You go out, you see it all the time. You go
[03:15:38.040 --> 03:15:41.760]  out anywhere. They don't even talk. They all look at the, you're taking over someone.
[03:15:41.760 --> 03:15:46.240]  Take God bless you. What do we even call this segment? Like just, I don't even know what
[03:15:46.240 --> 03:15:50.080]  you, it's just, it's insanity. We'll be back with Gerald Sillend and the top trends forecasters

[03:18:56.840 --> 03:19:00.600]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week. Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and
[03:19:00.600 --> 03:19:05.640]  being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots
[03:19:05.640 --> 03:19:12.320]  to do that in our local areas as well. And as a longtime Infowars Listener, I want to
[03:19:12.320 --> 03:19:17.320]  say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks
[03:19:17.320 --> 03:19:19.320]  for the Anthroplex, too. Thank you.
[03:19:19.320 --> 03:19:23.480]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal

[03:19:42.160 --> 03:19:46.720]  that there's a bigger problem going on. And if we can get our houses in order and be good
[03:19:46.720 --> 03:20:15.520]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:20:15.520 --> 03:20:22.520]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.520 --> 03:20:38.200]  Great being here. Real honor, privilege beyond the Alex Jones Show, General Salenti. I want
[03:20:38.200 --> 03:20:44.600]  to talk about some of today's trends in the news. And one of the big trends going on right
[03:20:44.600 --> 03:20:55.520]  now as we speak, the equity market, that was down earlier today, some 750 points. And you
[03:20:55.520 --> 03:21:00.480]  well know, having heard me on Alex and the subscribers to the Trends Journal, that we
[03:21:00.480 --> 03:21:06.240]  were the first ones to call the Trump rally about a week after he got elected back in November
[03:21:06.240 --> 03:21:13.720]  2016. And I did a 180. We thought the markets were going to go down. Wall Street said they
[03:21:13.720 --> 03:21:23.480]  would go down before the election if Trump won. We did the opposite. After the election,
[03:21:23.480 --> 03:21:28.720]  we said it's going up. These are facts. They were betting on Clinton. He's tied very closely
[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:37.480]  into Wall Street. Why else do you think Bill and Hillary get like a half a million, $300,000
[03:21:37.480 --> 03:21:42.040]  from the banksters when they give a speech, when you hear them BS for free all day long?
[03:21:42.040 --> 03:21:51.560]  It's called payback. So they were looking for the Clintons to win. And then in December
[03:21:51.560 --> 03:21:59.880]  of last year, you know, top trends for 2018, we said watch out for the Trump rally correction.
[03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:06.080]  And now we're in that correction. If you listen to the news by the prostitutes and
[03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:13.160]  whether it's the business news, the political news, any news, it's a joke. You know why
[03:22:13.160 --> 03:22:19.320]  the markets are down today, according to them? Well, yeah, those are Chinese. They're going
[03:22:19.320 --> 03:22:29.240]  to put tariffs on American companies. How much is it going to be? Oh, about $3 billion.
[03:22:29.240 --> 03:22:36.600]  I'm not good at math. But what's our trade deficit with China? Merchandise trade deficit?
[03:22:36.600 --> 03:22:50.640]  Oh, $375 billion. This Trump change. It's not why the markets are moving. And why the
[03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:59.200]  so-called progressives and Democrats are against and just about all the business media, renegotiate
[03:22:59.200 --> 03:23:07.560]  these lousy trade deals, I can't figure it out. I can figure it out because it's enriching
[03:23:07.560 --> 03:23:16.760]  the very rich. And that's why the big retailers don't want Trump to put on tariffs and renegotiate
[03:23:16.760 --> 03:23:24.480]  these trade deals because they can get their products made over in these third world countries
[03:23:24.480 --> 03:23:29.800]  and developing nations that pay the people nothing, bring the product back here and
[03:23:29.800 --> 03:23:36.720]  mark up the price rather than paying American workers the wage that the work is worth. So
[03:23:36.720 --> 03:23:41.720]  that's where the fight's coming from. The markets aren't going down today because of
[03:23:41.720 --> 03:23:49.200]  the Chinese $3 billion tree. Come on, grow up. Why should we grow up? We're prostitutes.
[03:23:49.200 --> 03:24:00.240]  We get paid to put out. This is stupid. The markets are overvalued. And Trump going after
[03:24:00.240 --> 03:24:09.020]  Amazon, man, keep going. It's a monopoly. And he's right. And look about them using the
[03:24:09.020 --> 03:24:15.480]  postal service, which we, the people, subsidize. And all the businesses they put out, it's
[03:24:15.480 --> 03:24:25.880]  a monopoly. And then you look at the price earnings ratio of Amazon. A regular PE ratio,
[03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:36.200]  price earnings, it's around 14 and a half. That's a solid one. So every stock you buy
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:46.880]  can make 14 and a half bucks. They have over 300 PE ratio. They're not making a lot of
[03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:52.120]  money, but they've done a great job putting bookstores out of business and a lot of other
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:25:00.120]  people. And now, again, they're using the Washington Post, the Bezo Zones, as a propaganda
[03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:07.920]  tool. And boy, you want to hear an anti-Russian propaganda mill between the New York Slime,
[03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:17.520]  the New York Times, the toilet paper record, and the Washington Post. They got a battle
[03:25:17.520 --> 03:25:25.320]  going on between them to see how they could make us hate Russia more. And Bezo Zones.
[03:25:25.320 --> 03:25:35.520]  And then the arrogance and stupidity of the moron politicians that are giving Amazon $7
[03:25:35.520 --> 03:25:43.600]  billion in tax breaks if they open up one of their slave camps in a state in the city
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:51.480]  near you. It's not a tax break. We, the taxpayers, have to subsidize a guy like Bezo's who's
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:26:01.080]  worth over $100 billion. It's disgusting. And you know why it's disgusting? Because
[03:26:01.080 --> 03:26:07.280]  we've got a bunch of disgusting people called politicians running and ruining our lives.
[03:26:07.280 --> 03:26:13.120]  And again, name the country, name the freak. You like Macron, the cazone over there in
[03:26:13.120 --> 03:26:18.760]  France? Oh, yeah, he's going to send troops into Syria now. That's the latest with him.
[03:26:18.760 --> 03:26:25.080]  A little boy of nothing. Maybe Theresa May is the one you like better. Again, name the
[03:26:25.080 --> 03:26:32.000]  country, name the freaks. They're all over the world. And we're taking orders from them
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:39.200]  as they're destroying our lives. And the media keeps promoting it. So going back to the markets,
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:44.720]  the markets are overvalued and overleveraged and the story. And now you're seeing the tech
[03:26:44.720 --> 03:26:52.120]  stocks down almost 3% today. They're way overvalued and overleveraged.
[03:26:52.120 --> 03:27:01.360]  So gold, gold today was up almost 20 bucks, but it still can't get into that other range.
[03:27:01.360 --> 03:27:06.720]  And that's where it has to go. And before we go and getting in that other range and
[03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:14.760]  gold is that safe haven commodity, you also want that safe haven body armor at the info
[03:27:14.760 --> 03:27:24.160]  wars store. The best protection for less protecting yourself is the number one concern.
[03:27:24.160 --> 03:27:31.480]  As I keep saying of any informed and prepared citizen. So that's why info wars is proud
[03:27:31.480 --> 03:27:39.240]  to offer the best in American made high quality, affordable body armor. Protecting your loved
[03:27:39.240 --> 03:27:47.440]  ones and yourself has never been easier. And they range from backpack size defense to full
[03:27:47.440 --> 03:27:54.080]  body protection. They have a wide variety of sizes, protection levels and even colors
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:28:01.720]  give you all the options you need. And again, things are unwinding here. You know, GCs,
[03:28:01.720 --> 03:28:09.880]  3 Gs, guns, gold and a getaway plan. Put some body armor on that too. Because things are
[03:28:09.880 --> 03:28:16.080]  also heating up in the Middle East. If things really blow up, man, it's going to blow up
[03:28:16.080 --> 03:28:23.480]  in a city or county in a state near you. So body armor at info wars stores, the best
[03:28:23.480 --> 03:28:31.280]  protection for less. Do it back in a little bit. Stay tuned and support info wars with
[03:28:31.280 --> 03:28:44.600]  your money, with your mind defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's
[03:28:44.600 --> 03:28:56.720]  Alex Jones.
[03:28:56.720 --> 03:29:22.040]  Thanks for watching.
[03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:29.040]  I'm Alex Jones and I'll see you in the next video.
[03:30:22.040 --> 03:30:29.040]  I'm Alex Jones and I'll see you in the next video.
[03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:58.440]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[03:30:58.440 --> 03:31:03.160]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[03:31:03.160 --> 03:31:08.840]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense
[03:31:08.840 --> 03:31:14.760]  Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[03:31:14.760 --> 03:31:19.600]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a classical 360
[03:31:19.600 --> 03:31:23.920]  weapon. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we
[03:31:23.920 --> 03:31:29.200]  believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[03:31:29.200 --> 03:31:33.280]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[03:31:33.280 --> 03:31:38.280]  this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[03:31:38.280 --> 03:31:43.560]  you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[03:31:43.560 --> 03:31:47.440]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and
[03:31:47.440 --> 03:31:51.220]  your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies
[03:31:51.220 --> 03:31:53.880]  with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.
[03:31:53.880 --> 03:31:57.880]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy. We went
[03:31:57.880 --> 03:32:02.240]  out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy
[03:32:02.240 --> 03:32:08.080]  stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula than some of
[03:32:08.080 --> 03:32:11.200]  the best selling formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and looked, what
[03:32:11.200 --> 03:32:14.720]  is the top? What is the best? We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it better.
[03:32:14.720 --> 03:32:20.040]  We competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for 60 bucks. We put $10 in it and sell
[03:32:20.040 --> 03:32:25.400]  it for 30 bucks. It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top of the line new
[03:32:25.400 --> 03:32:32.040]  tropic for $19.95. Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average. We need that $15, $20
[03:32:32.040 --> 03:32:35.680]  we make to fund this operation in the face of the global, the rest of it. But I'm doing
[03:32:35.680 --> 03:32:40.080]  this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks. I want to sell it all out before
[03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:44.280]  the big supply comes in and I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and
[03:32:44.280 --> 03:32:51.280]  find out why it's got 6,000 plus five star reviews. It's amazing. InfowarsTour.com, InfowarsLive.com
[03:32:51.280 --> 03:33:17.280]  triple A to five, three, three, one, three, nine. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:17.280 --> 03:33:43.320]  It's always a treat to be here. And I was talking about the equity markets. So now Nasdaq
[03:33:43.320 --> 03:33:52.960]  is down over 3%. Dow's down about 580. Gold's still up there, but it can't break over that
[03:33:52.960 --> 03:34:00.720]  1385 mark. That's where it has to go. But again, I don't give financial advice, but
[03:34:00.720 --> 03:34:07.440]  I'll tell you the story and I've been saying the same story now for four years. The downside
[03:34:07.440 --> 03:34:13.160]  risk of gold right now, which I had that not this part for four years, but this part for
[03:34:13.160 --> 03:34:21.640]  the better part of a year, is another hundred dollars down. That's about the worst that
[03:34:21.640 --> 03:34:30.800]  I see gold going on the downside. It has to break above 1385, which it hasn't been able
[03:34:30.800 --> 03:34:43.360]  to do to reach the next level, which is 1450. When it hits the 1450 mark, boom, zap, 2,000
[03:34:43.360 --> 03:34:52.720]  plus. That part I've been saying now for four years and it hasn't done that. So follow
[03:34:52.720 --> 03:35:00.200]  gold as you follow the markets. The markets go lower, gold should be going higher. And
[03:35:00.200 --> 03:35:11.840]  again, why the markets going down? One reason, the biggest one, interest rates. The higher
[03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:20.600]  interest rates go. All that corporate debt that they got over there, guess what? All
[03:35:20.600 --> 03:35:27.440]  the personal debt they got there, guess what? All the government debt out there, guess what?
[03:35:27.440 --> 03:35:33.800]  It's going to cost you more to pay as interest rates go higher and the whole stock market
[03:35:33.800 --> 03:35:43.720]  is nothing more than a scheme. It's a gambler's paradise and the central banksters gave the
[03:35:43.720 --> 03:35:51.640]  gamblers all the money that they wanted by negative and zero interest rate policy and
[03:35:51.640 --> 03:36:00.160]  quantitative easing. And now the junkies, the money junkies are freaking out because
[03:36:00.160 --> 03:36:10.560]  they can't get their money fixed for free. That's why the markets are going down. End
[03:36:10.560 --> 03:36:21.640]  the story with everything else. Borrowed time, rising debt costs pose private equity challenge.
[03:36:21.640 --> 03:36:27.560]  This is from the Financial Times. Private equity firms are writing large checks. In
[03:36:27.560 --> 03:36:35.880]  January it was Blackstone for the $17 billion acquisition of the Finance and Risk Division
[03:36:35.880 --> 03:36:47.200]  of Thompson Reuters. Now it is Carlisle with a $10 billion purchase of ExcoNoble's specialty
[03:36:47.200 --> 03:36:53.760]  chemical units. This is just the beginning. More merger and acquisition activity has happened
[03:36:53.760 --> 03:37:01.240]  this year for this amount of time than any other time. When I was a young guy, there
[03:37:01.240 --> 03:37:08.320]  were no private equities. There were no Blackstones or Carlisles. There were no corporations
[03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:15.080]  anymore. It's all the money people own everything. And they keep consolidating everything. Putting
[03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:20.840]  on you, we're not getting this money for free. They get these huge debt piles. Look what
[03:37:20.840 --> 03:37:27.360]  happened to Toys R Us. Toys are gone, man. They have over $5 billion worth of debt from
[03:37:27.360 --> 03:37:32.640]  the private equity deal that was done when they bought them out. You want to talk about
[03:37:32.640 --> 03:37:42.400]  the Amazon monopoly? The whole world is monopolized. Private equity groups. Banksters, scamsters,
[03:37:42.400 --> 03:37:54.520]  man. And women got to be equal. Yep. That's what's going on. Interest rates. Student debt
[03:37:54.520 --> 03:38:02.640]  could hold back economic growth. More than 80% of the people aged 20 to 35 with student
[03:38:02.640 --> 03:38:09.680]  debt who haven't bought a house yet blame their educational loans. Spending all that
[03:38:09.680 --> 03:38:21.240]  money to get a degree in worthlessness. I mentioned this one woman here in this story.
[03:38:21.240 --> 03:38:26.720]  Stephanie Pinecuff graduated from Indiana University, Purdue University in Annapolis
[03:38:26.720 --> 03:38:37.120]  with $43,000 in debt. She works for a non-profit, hoping formerly incarcerated people transition
[03:38:37.120 --> 03:38:45.680]  back into the communities, making around $30,000 a year. Her monthly student loan payment
[03:38:45.680 --> 03:38:55.360]  is $450. You look at the numbers. They're all here. Some 45 million people in the United
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:39:06.120]  States carry student debt. The average borrower owes more. Are you ready for this? $30,000
[03:39:06.120 --> 03:39:12.720]  educational system. It's a freak show. If we had any decent education system, you'd
[03:39:12.720 --> 03:39:18.840]  think we'd be in so much trouble that we have right now. If we were educated, we're
[03:39:18.840 --> 03:39:28.480]  not educated. It's a propaganda mill. We're brainwashed. Brainwashed into stupidity. And
[03:39:28.480 --> 03:39:34.360]  by the way, take a trip around the world. It's starting to change. The education system
[03:39:34.360 --> 03:39:40.680]  we have is a relic from the industrial age invented by Germany. One of our top trends
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:50.080]  is interactive view. That's right. Learning online and they're doing it in India big time.
[03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:55.960]  Courses develop for your mind, not general education, general list, general led, general
[03:39:55.960 --> 03:40:03.440]  garbage. You got to learn a bunch of jerk stuff because some morons are telling you
[03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:10.000]  that this is what you need. I got left back in the fifth grade. I ran away from kindergarten.
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:18.800]  I hated every day of school. I wasn't rebelling. It was just a bunch of stuff I couldn't understand.
[03:40:18.800 --> 03:40:24.000]  Interactive view. When I put your money where your mind is also, if you're an investor,
[03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:28.000]  I would consider looking at the companies that are expanding in that field, in other
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:35.120]  countries. It's the future. And the future is, again, for those of us that want to stay
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:41.840]  alive, stay healthy, be on our own and function at the best is to consider, of course, all
[03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:49.440]  those great products that info wars offers. And one of them is they're introducing immune
[03:40:49.440 --> 03:40:59.320]  goggle that's available at an introductory sale price at 33% off. Again, staying healthy
[03:40:59.320 --> 03:41:04.920]  on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home. But sometimes supplements
[03:41:04.920 --> 03:41:11.840]  don't work fast enough. That's why info wars created a powerful new addition to the super
[03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:22.960]  blue line. Super blue silver immune goggle. It's an incredible new purifying formula within
[03:41:22.960 --> 03:41:31.280]  all purpose use. Super blue super immune goggle comes in a convenient small bottle. As we say
[03:41:31.280 --> 03:41:38.800]  in the Bronx, it's densest recommended for daily use whenever you feel like you need
[03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:47.120]  to stay clean. And not only is it a powerful hand purifier, it can also be used orally
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:54.160]  to spray a smaller amount in your mouth, swish and swallow. And ever you feel surrounded
[03:41:54.160 --> 03:42:00.000]  by toxins. So again, put your money where your mind is real hard as you want to keep
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:07.320]  info wars going. Trends journal all of us out there, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others
[03:42:07.320 --> 03:42:13.480]  that put the truth on the line as they're selling line. So support info wars, these
[03:42:13.480 --> 03:42:19.720]  products are important, particularly one like this. If you fly, you got to go on those lousy
[03:42:19.720 --> 03:42:30.200]  airplanes. And boy, oh boy, the germs and stuff on there. You want to have immune goggle.
[03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:53.440]  You could be back in a little bit and watch those markets.
[03:42:53.440 --> 03:43:02.840]  Info wars life is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a best

[03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:47.760]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread
[03:44:47.760 --> 03:45:16.120]  the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:45:16.120 --> 03:45:19.640]  Wow, thank you. You're the top of the list that makes it all possible. Which dude for
[03:45:19.640 --> 03:45:24.720]  surgical does you like best? I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[03:45:24.720 --> 03:45:30.680]  That's amazing. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. My morning
[03:45:30.680 --> 03:45:37.600]  was fantastic and I love the guys. I love the info wars through and I just want to take
[03:45:37.600 --> 03:45:42.800]  this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it. We'll love
[03:45:42.800 --> 03:45:46.920]  it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product. What you find in our news is the

[03:45:54.520 --> 03:46:00.000]  InfoWarsLife Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and
[03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:03.760]  for a good reason. Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling
[03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:07.600]  new tropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked and we made
[03:46:07.600 --> 03:46:13.400]  it even stronger. Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times
[03:46:13.400 --> 03:46:20.920]  markup. We only have 150% and then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's 50% off.
[03:46:20.920 --> 03:46:27.640]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that
[03:46:27.640 --> 03:46:32.640]  takes about seven days to kick in. Brain Force takes about 30 minutes, but the two go together.
[03:46:32.640 --> 03:46:38.920]  It's the mind and body challenge. They're both 50% off individually or together they're
[03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:45.040]  50% off and free shipping with the combo at infowarslife.com. But it's got to end in
[03:46:45.040 --> 03:46:50.640]  a couple of days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out. InfoWarsLife.com
[03:46:50.640 --> 03:46:56.840]  to get your Brain Force Plus and real red pill today.
[03:46:56.840 --> 03:47:06.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:06.840 --> 03:47:26.760]  Hey, it's great being on the Alex Jones show. It's really an honor. Love doing it.
[03:47:26.760 --> 03:47:32.000]  And I go to infowars all the time to see what news they have out there. And one of the stories
[03:47:32.000 --> 03:47:40.760]  that was out recently, London murder rate now beats New York after a surge of stabbings.
[03:47:40.760 --> 03:47:49.360]  Huh, stabbings. I say we've got to bend the knives. You know what the point I'm making?
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:54.320]  People want to do crazy things. You don't need guns. Banning guns isn't going to stop
[03:47:54.320 --> 03:48:02.080]  the psychopaths from doing crazy things. Putting up all these road barriers everywhere
[03:48:02.080 --> 03:48:07.880]  is not going to stop somebody from crazy person driving a car up on the sidewalk and mowing
[03:48:07.880 --> 03:48:16.240]  down masses. It's not going to stop anything. Oh, we're going to put more police on the
[03:48:16.240 --> 03:48:20.920]  street with these guys and all this stuff. Take it easy, man. Somebody wants to put a
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:27.600]  belt on them and blow you up and everybody around you. You ain't going to stop them.
[03:48:27.600 --> 03:48:34.000]  The psychology has to change. America is a nation of violence with all the wars going
[03:48:34.000 --> 03:48:43.720]  on. And you know, I launched Occupy Peace. OccupyPeace.us. OccupyPeace.com. Change
[03:48:43.720 --> 03:48:52.240]  the mentality. Fish rots from the head down. It's great what Trump is saying about pulling
[03:48:52.240 --> 03:49:01.000]  out of Syria. I hope it happens. Enough. Son has to go, arrogant Obama said, the Nobel
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:07.960]  Peace and Craft Prize winner, along with Hillary Clinton, Frankenstein Kerry, and all the other
[03:49:07.960 --> 03:49:16.160]  freaks and fools and liars and cowards running and ruining the nation. They did to Libya.
[03:49:16.160 --> 03:49:25.840]  So if mass murder comes from the top, hey, why not have it on the street? So it's a psychology
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:33.160]  to me that has to change. But going back to this article, more people were murdered in
[03:49:33.160 --> 03:49:40.240]  London in February than in New York City. UK's capital overtook the US city murder rate for
[03:49:40.240 --> 03:49:48.840]  the first time after 15th person was killed. And most of the killings in the capital have
[03:49:48.840 --> 03:50:02.640]  been stabbings. And the Met Police Chief, Chris Sidia, Dick, recently suggested the force
[03:50:02.640 --> 03:50:11.240]  plan to increase stop and search to counter this. Quote, victims, parents all say, get
[03:50:11.240 --> 03:50:21.640]  out and do more, Ms. Dick said. So it's one thing you'll see in the next year. We won't
[03:50:21.640 --> 03:50:35.240]  be held back by political correctness, but it will be fair and irrespective of race.
[03:50:35.240 --> 03:50:46.960]  And Ms. Dick, fair, pure stupidity, robbing people of more of their rights, it won't stop
[03:50:46.960 --> 03:50:58.760]  anything. Anybody that's a fighter knows. You want to pull it off, you'll pull it off.
[03:50:58.760 --> 03:51:09.280]  No, no, we'll just rob your rights away from you. Hey, want to ban guns? Horror on streets
[03:51:09.280 --> 03:51:19.840]  of Germany. State of emergency declared as 80 men brawl with machetes. That's right.
[03:51:19.840 --> 03:51:27.600]  This is going on right now. It's like two days to go. But no, we're going to ban guns
[03:51:27.600 --> 03:51:32.840]  and we'll really be stupid. There are only about 350 million guns out there. And if somebody
[03:51:32.840 --> 03:51:36.480]  wants to get one to do whatever they want to do, they'll do it. And you don't need a
[03:51:36.480 --> 03:51:40.920]  gun. You could use a bomb. You could use a car. You could use a machete. You could use
[03:51:40.920 --> 03:51:51.880]  a knife. And if you listen to the politicians and Ms. Dick, you could use stupidity. Before
[03:51:51.880 --> 03:51:56.840]  I forget, going back to the markets, again, the propaganda coming out today, they're blaming
[03:51:56.840 --> 03:52:04.880]  it all on tariffs that China is putting on the U.S. for the grand total of nothing, $3
[03:52:04.880 --> 03:52:10.920]  billion, with a merchandise trade deficit with the United States that we have against
[03:52:10.920 --> 03:52:18.520]  China of $375 billion. There's nothing. So, and this is the kind of work that I do every
[03:52:18.520 --> 03:52:24.360]  day. I got to read all this stuff and then outline the story. So this, you just pull
[03:52:24.360 --> 03:52:33.080]  this out to show you what's going on in the markets has nothing to do with the tariffs.
[03:52:33.080 --> 03:52:39.120]  It has to do with interest rates and the other reasons I've given you, overvalued stocks
[03:52:39.120 --> 03:52:49.880]  and also overleveraged. Tech worries drag down stocks. Tech shares sank Tuesday, amid
[03:52:49.880 --> 03:52:58.240]  a series of setbacks to major firms and a broad retreat from risk, risk, from gambling
[03:52:58.240 --> 03:53:14.040]  on overvalued stocks. This is from Wednesday, March 28th. What's today? April 2nd. And they're
[03:53:14.040 --> 03:53:23.380]  blaming it on China and Trump because we're prostitutes. And if you're not blaming it
[03:53:23.380 --> 03:53:30.160]  on China and Trump, who could you blame it on? Well, let's see what we could do over
[03:53:30.160 --> 03:53:40.440]  here. From Moscow with murder, Russia hunting defectors in America? A question mark. This
[03:53:40.440 --> 03:53:49.200]  is from the piece of garbage called Newsweek. This is how they're selling hate. From Moscow
[03:53:49.200 --> 03:54:00.400]  with murder, a little clown of a jerk, Jeff Stein. How about Jeff Slime? Or just Slime
[03:54:00.400 --> 03:54:09.600]  to write a headline like this. From Moscow with murder, Russia hunting defectors in America?
[03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:15.920]  They get lonely. They miss their friends and family left behind in Russia. And so, despite
[03:54:15.920 --> 03:54:23.040]  the danger of exposing themselves to Kremlin retribution, Russian defectors hiding abroad,
[03:54:23.040 --> 03:54:29.520]  make phone calls and send emails back to relatives in the motherland. And when they do, that
[03:54:29.520 --> 03:54:40.240]  Kremlin is listening. Hey, Slime Stein. We got the NSA. Listen to every damn thing we
[03:54:40.240 --> 03:54:47.520]  do. We got jerks like Miss Dick telling us we're going to frisk you more. But now, let's
[03:54:47.520 --> 03:54:52.360]  make the hate Russia thing. Oh, they killed a spy over there. Why didn't they kill them?
[03:54:52.360 --> 03:54:56.200]  They poisoned them, but they won't give them any proof over there in the UK. No, we just
[03:54:56.200 --> 03:55:00.760]  said so because that's the propaganda we're putting out. And again, it wasn't like they
[03:55:00.760 --> 03:55:08.040]  killed Mary Poppins, you know, or Mother Teresa here, or tried to, allegedly. I think I was
[03:55:08.040 --> 03:55:16.760]  a former spy to nobody. Why would they do that? Propaganda. Want more propaganda? Again,
[03:55:16.760 --> 03:55:23.120]  this is stuff I got to read everything. This is from the Financial Times. Bannon and the
[03:55:23.120 --> 03:55:31.800]  Big Question. Should we have given a platform to controversial, to controversialists? Fresh
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:40.000]  from talking to Trump's incendiary former advisor. Lionel Barber reflects on the art
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:49.280]  of the interview. The email to the editor is just to the point. Justin Quirk was canceling
[03:55:49.280 --> 03:55:55.600]  his subscription in light of FT's decision to book Steve Bannon for a forthcoming event
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:56:06.120]  in New York on the future of news. Now, here's what this guy writes. This is Lionel Barber.
[03:56:06.120 --> 03:56:14.760]  Now in my near 40 years in journalism, prostitutism, I have interviewed many people of questionable
[03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:24.400]  character. As editor, I have sat down with strong men, such as Paul Kagami of Rwanda,
[03:56:24.400 --> 03:56:34.560]  Alvaro Uribe of Columbia, and Vladimir Putin of Russia. Each might be said to have blood
[03:56:34.560 --> 03:56:45.720]  on their hands. Hey, did you interview George Bush? That cat got blood on his head? How about
[03:56:45.720 --> 03:56:55.800]  slick Willie Clinton and Hillary Clinton and Samantha Power and Susan Rice and Barack Quirk?
[03:56:55.800 --> 03:57:05.080]  I'm really good at killing people, Obama. Interview them? Barber? They got blood on
[03:57:05.080 --> 03:57:11.880]  their hands? No, you got propaganda in your mind, and that's all we're getting, and that's
