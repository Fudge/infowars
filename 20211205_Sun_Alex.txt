[00:00.000 --> 00:10.080]  It is understandable and appropriate to leave this discussion now, how we can encourage
[00:10.080 --> 00:16.160]  and potentially think about mandatory vaccination within the European Union.
[00:16.160 --> 00:22.160]  Maximum Red Alert, unelected EU President, calls for forced inoculations.
[00:22.160 --> 00:27.560]  UK, Australia, US also developing plans for forced injections.
[00:27.560 --> 00:32.080]  It is actively exploring the possibility of making vaccines mandatory.
[00:32.080 --> 00:36.760]  In an address to the nation last night, the president outlined that it will entail limiting
[00:36.760 --> 00:40.080]  access to certain locations and activities.
[00:40.080 --> 00:45.400]  Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg has announced a full nationwide lockdown starting Monday
[00:45.400 --> 00:50.440]  and it will become the first European country to make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory starting
[00:50.440 --> 00:51.440]  February.
[00:51.440 --> 00:57.760]  The restrictions that we decided today will work if they are used appropriately and if
[00:57.760 --> 01:01.600]  we really use them to the fullest extent.
[01:01.600 --> 01:07.360]  Government has announced a ban on the unvaccinated entering bars, restaurants and non-essential
[01:07.360 --> 01:10.360]  shops.
[01:10.360 --> 01:14.800]  This is the situation we are confronted with and it's also clear what we need to achieve
[01:14.800 --> 01:15.800]  first.
[01:15.800 --> 01:18.960]  Those who have not been vaccinated yet need to do so.
[01:18.960 --> 01:25.520]  By the end of October, everyone 12 or older on a plane or train within Canada should be
[01:25.520 --> 01:26.520]  fully vaccinated.
[01:26.520 --> 01:30.720]  So this is martial law, this is how they roll it out, ahead of the global financial collapse
[01:30.720 --> 01:31.840]  and the great reset.
[01:31.840 --> 01:34.560]  This is North Korea, come to the land down under.
[01:34.560 --> 01:38.200]  Good morning, we start with breaking news at a Darwin where three people have escaped
[01:38.200 --> 01:41.400]  from the Howard Springs COVID quarantine facility.
[01:41.400 --> 01:45.440]  Talia Saab is there for us, Talia, good morning, there's a search underway right now.
[01:45.440 --> 01:48.240]  Yes, that's right, Davina, good morning to you.
[01:48.240 --> 01:52.960]  We've been told the trios scaled defence in the early hours of this morning.
[01:52.960 --> 01:58.200]  Police receiving reports around 4.40am, now major police checkpoints have been set up
[01:58.200 --> 02:02.240]  around Howard Springs for the past several hours, as you can see in these pictures, they've
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.240]  been conducting thorough searches in car boots, checking vehicle registrations, cars and buses
[02:08.240 --> 02:09.240]  alike.
[02:09.240 --> 02:11.240]  It's a $5,000 fine if what?
[02:11.240 --> 02:12.880]  If you breach again.
[02:12.880 --> 02:15.880]  If I walk out onto that pass.
[02:15.880 --> 02:17.920]  Without your mask on, if there's no reason, I don't know what to do.
[02:17.920 --> 02:26.400]  If I cross that yellow line that I've broken the rule, I will be issued with a $5,000 fine.
[02:26.400 --> 02:30.160]  So what did that experience make you think?
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.720]  What was your feeling about being in that situation with those people in control of
[02:35.720 --> 02:38.880]  your every movement?
[02:38.880 --> 02:40.480]  It's horrible, it's a horrible feeling.
[02:40.480 --> 02:45.640]  You feel like you're in prison, you feel like you've done something wrong, it's inhumane
[02:45.640 --> 02:52.080]  what they're doing, like, you are so small, they just overpower you and you're literally
[02:52.080 --> 02:56.680]  nothing, it's like, you do what we say or you're in trouble, we'll lock you up for
[02:56.680 --> 02:57.680]  longer.
[02:57.680 --> 03:02.840]  Yeah, they were even threatening me that if I was to do this again, we will extend your
[03:02.840 --> 03:03.840]  time in prison.
[03:03.840 --> 03:04.840]  You are in prison.
[03:04.840 --> 03:05.840]  You are in prison.
[03:05.840 --> 03:06.840]  You are in prison.
[03:06.840 --> 03:07.840]  You are in prison.
[03:07.840 --> 03:08.840]  You are in prison.
[03:08.840 --> 03:09.840]  You are in prison.
[03:09.840 --> 03:10.840]  You are in prison.
[03:10.840 --> 03:11.840]  You are in prison.
[03:11.840 --> 03:12.840]  You are in prison.
[03:12.840 --> 03:22.800]  You are in prison.
[03:22.800 --> 03:35.820]  You are in prison.
[03:35.820 --> 03:37.580]  But that's still the plan.
[03:37.580 --> 03:42.140]  And then now finally coming after our children to just destroy confidence in U.S. government
[03:42.140 --> 03:47.380]  institutions, destroy confidence in the FBI, the FDA, and then the UN and the globalists
[03:47.380 --> 03:52.100]  will come in as the saviors, talking about how it was wrong, what our nation states did.
[03:52.100 --> 03:55.420]  This is all a plan to discredit our countries and collapse them.
[03:55.420 --> 03:57.580]  That's Klaus Schwab's own admissions.
[03:57.580 --> 04:00.500]  This is a life and death situation.
[04:00.500 --> 04:01.700]  Do you understand?
[04:01.700 --> 04:03.860]  It's all coming down now.
[04:03.860 --> 04:09.860]  Obama and Fauci creepily going up and helping whole little kids, while they inject them
[04:09.860 --> 04:17.260]  with GMO garbage, linked to massive death and illnesses that they know was going to happen.
[04:17.260 --> 04:18.260]  Taren, he's not coming.
[04:18.260 --> 04:19.260]  It's here.
[04:19.260 --> 04:22.940]  People with histories of knowingly killing foster children like they were lab rats in
[04:22.940 --> 04:28.340]  illegal experiments are now at schools with parents lined up to see Obama and see Fauci
[04:28.340 --> 04:32.660]  so they can hover over like the angels of death they are and get off on the sickness
[04:32.660 --> 04:34.100]  they're involved in.
[04:34.100 --> 04:38.380]  These are conscious, psychopathic, murdering killers.
[04:38.380 --> 04:45.020]  And I told you, pedophilia is only the entree to the larger feast that is killing our children
[04:45.020 --> 04:46.020]  in mass.
[04:46.020 --> 04:52.340]  It is just the first dinner, the hors d'oeuvres.
[04:52.340 --> 05:07.020]  The report is live at bayonet.vidian for Tabletarian's Band-Aid, Taren and Robloid.

[05:43.460 --> 05:44.460]  an air filtration.
[05:44.460 --> 05:48.620]  But whatever you do, do your shopping there with patriots that are fighting for all of
[05:48.620 --> 05:49.980]  our collective liberties together.
[05:49.980 --> 05:53.420]  In the shop at the big box stores, you deserve to be a slave.
[05:53.420 --> 05:56.740]  If you shop at M4 Wars, you're part of the team fighting for liberty.
[05:56.740 --> 06:20.100]  God bless and thanks for your support.
[06:26.740 --> 06:41.300]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:41.300 --> 06:47.340]  And now you see I wasn't joking about all this coming for all those decades.
[06:47.340 --> 06:51.780]  I was warning you because it was all in the UN documents.
[06:51.780 --> 07:03.420]  Sunday Live, UN is trying to get all children jabbed before mandatory vaccine campaign collapses.
[07:03.420 --> 07:11.140]  Now ladies and gentlemen, again, I want to thank you all for joining us this evening.
[07:11.140 --> 07:13.340]  I don't know how long we'll be here, none of us do.
[07:13.340 --> 07:19.260]  But we are in the midst of a global corporate criminal takeover of the planet.
[07:19.260 --> 07:30.100]  Now on Tuesday, after a federal court ordered the FDA to release the first little drip of
[07:30.100 --> 07:35.140]  hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, we reported on the first 30 pages of documents
[07:35.140 --> 07:36.620]  that came out.
[07:36.620 --> 07:47.580]  And those first 30 pages of documents were a total criminal admission of the FDA in just
[07:47.580 --> 07:54.860]  the first beginning of the so-called vaccine for COVID-19 with Pfizer, causing thousands
[07:54.860 --> 07:57.620]  of deaths.
[07:57.620 --> 08:00.100]  And that they confirmed and knew and covered it up.
[08:00.100 --> 08:01.100]  Well, guess what?
[08:01.100 --> 08:04.740]  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, they're all censoring even medical doctors trying to link
[08:04.740 --> 08:05.740]  to those documents.
[08:05.740 --> 08:07.780]  I mean, they all deserve to go to prison.
[08:07.780 --> 08:13.140]  The executives, every single one of them.
[08:13.140 --> 08:16.900]  And the word is Jack Dorsey, not saying the guy's a great guy, but he wouldn't go along
[08:16.900 --> 08:24.820]  with it, so he had to step down.
[08:24.820 --> 08:32.260]  Sunday Live, COVID-19 hysteria is a psychological warfare weapon launched by the Davos Group
[08:32.260 --> 08:34.300]  to conquer Earth.
[08:34.300 --> 08:41.060]  The Davos Group is the public manifestation of the corporate fascist.
[08:41.060 --> 08:48.660]  I'm going to lay all of this out tonight, and Congress is now, Representative Norman
[08:48.660 --> 08:53.380]  is demanding, I don't care if the FDA goes to the federal court and doesn't want stuff
[08:53.380 --> 09:06.100]  released till 2075, excuse me, 2077, I want it released in one month.
[09:06.100 --> 09:12.540]  And we're going to be going over all of that here tonight.
[09:12.540 --> 09:17.100]  But there is no debate, there is no discussion that we're being censored.
[09:17.100 --> 09:21.460]  There's no debate that the government documents and their own admissions are, this doesn't
[09:21.460 --> 09:26.060]  protect you, it erases your immune system, it makes you twice as likely to contract and
[09:26.060 --> 09:32.660]  even more likely to die what they call COVID-19.
[09:32.660 --> 09:35.260]  And then it was all a premeditated plan.
[09:35.260 --> 09:41.140]  So we are here in the middle of this now.
[09:41.140 --> 09:49.940]  Meanwhile, the deep state is pressing ahead on every front with not just lawfare and lawsuits
[09:49.940 --> 09:57.660]  and civil action, but criminal investigations by the Justice Department of basically every
[09:57.660 --> 10:01.340]  prominent talk show host you can imagine.
[10:01.340 --> 10:07.620]  They even start investigations on people's families.
[10:07.620 --> 10:16.380]  But even the lap dog, grand juries in many cases will not indict who the feds order them
[10:16.380 --> 10:22.460]  to, but then just like they couldn't get the FDA or the CDC boards to go along with these
[10:22.460 --> 10:26.260]  experimental shots, and then after that they couldn't get them to go along with experimental
[10:26.260 --> 10:30.380]  shots for children, they would just remove the boards and appoint people that would, and
[10:30.380 --> 10:34.580]  that's what's happening now with the grand juries.
[10:34.580 --> 10:36.140]  People say, well, how are you taking it, Jones?
[10:36.140 --> 10:37.140]  They're coming for you.
[10:37.140 --> 10:38.140]  They're coming for you.
[10:38.140 --> 10:39.140]  They're coming for everybody.
[10:39.140 --> 10:40.140]  I'm not worried about me.
[10:40.140 --> 10:42.300]  I'm worried about my family and my children.
[10:42.300 --> 10:45.140]  That means your children as well, because we're all on this together.
[10:45.140 --> 10:50.740]  We're all on the same damn ship sinking into the icy waters of tyranny.
[10:50.740 --> 10:55.460]  Better decide which side you're on.
[10:55.460 --> 10:57.540]  And the sooner we wake up and say no to this, the better.
[10:57.540 --> 10:58.540]  It's still going to be rough.
[10:58.540 --> 11:00.580]  They've already committed to a lot of tyranny.
[11:00.580 --> 11:02.980]  They've already put things into motion and they're hard to stop.
[11:02.980 --> 11:08.980]  But the longer we go, the worse it's going to get for almost everybody except for maybe
[11:08.980 --> 11:11.060]  one-one-millionth of a percent.
[11:11.060 --> 11:14.780]  I mean, maybe a few hundred globalists, if they could depopulate the earth and create
[11:14.780 --> 11:20.540]  a shangrel off of themselves and merge with, you know, silicon and live forever, I mean,
[11:20.540 --> 11:25.780]  maybe if that pipe green's real, maybe it's good for them, but it sure as hell isn't good
[11:25.780 --> 11:30.260]  for seven-and-a-half billion people.
[11:30.260 --> 11:35.620]  And it's going to become very evident soon to even the most dumbed-down people that a
[11:35.620 --> 11:39.620]  predatory system's attacking them and that the government's been hijacked and taken
[11:39.620 --> 11:42.100]  control of.
[11:42.100 --> 11:46.140]  They plan to do the bait and switch, though, to go, oh, that's the U.S. government.
[11:46.140 --> 11:48.140]  That was capitalism did that.
[11:48.140 --> 11:52.660]  Claude Schwab-Braggs, they're going to blame their great reset crisis they trigger on the
[11:52.660 --> 11:54.700]  existing institutions.
[11:54.700 --> 11:59.340]  Then they'll order those institutions they control to march out and attack the public.
[11:59.340 --> 12:03.540]  The public will destroy those institutions, and now the globalists come in to a failed
[12:03.540 --> 12:05.180]  state they control.
[12:05.180 --> 12:09.060]  That is the equation.
[12:09.060 --> 12:13.940]  That is the plan.
[12:13.940 --> 12:15.780]  So we have this headline by Tucker Carlson.
[12:15.780 --> 12:18.420]  It's a very important 14-minute breakdown.
[12:18.420 --> 12:19.980]  It's on infowars.com.
[12:19.980 --> 12:24.980]  Tucker Carlson, tyranny is coming unless someone stops Democrats.
[12:24.980 --> 12:29.700]  Now, that headline's almost accurate.
[12:29.700 --> 12:32.860]  We know Tucker's doing the best he can.
[12:32.860 --> 12:33.860]  But it really is.
[12:33.860 --> 12:34.860]  Tyranny's already here.
[12:34.860 --> 12:36.660]  You're already in the frying pan.
[12:36.660 --> 12:38.260]  It's already set up to five.
[12:38.260 --> 12:42.780]  It's going up to 10 if we don't get out of it quick and we're going to be cooked.
[12:42.780 --> 12:44.940]  Our goose is in the oven.
[12:44.940 --> 12:47.980]  The question is, can we get it out of there before it's cooked?
[12:47.980 --> 12:51.740]  The goose isn't cooked yet, but we're in the oven, baby.
[12:51.740 --> 12:53.980]  We still have the power to open it and get out.
[12:53.980 --> 12:54.980]  It doesn't mean we're not burned.
[12:54.980 --> 12:55.980]  It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.
[12:55.980 --> 12:57.780]  It doesn't mean we have to lick our wounds.
[12:57.780 --> 13:02.220]  But our eyes are going to roll back on our heads real soon, and it's going to be bye-bye
[13:02.220 --> 13:03.220]  time.
[13:03.220 --> 13:06.220]  I mean, bye-bye to fixing things peacefully.
[13:06.220 --> 13:14.340]  Bye-bye to civilization, as you know it, and hi, hello to Billions Dead, which is the
[13:14.340 --> 13:19.220]  designed, globalist collapse of civilization that the Davos Group is the front group for
[13:19.220 --> 13:24.220]  the Bilderberg Group admitting it's their plan, and it's not like I just showed up now
[13:24.220 --> 13:27.780]  and said, oh, that's what's going on with all this, and it makes sense to people.
[13:27.780 --> 13:28.780]  I made films.
[13:28.780 --> 13:29.780]  I wrote books.
[13:29.780 --> 13:32.620]  I documented it decades ago, ought their own plans.
[13:32.620 --> 13:36.140]  We're here.
[13:36.140 --> 13:39.140]  All over the world, they're announcing forced inoculations.
[13:39.140 --> 13:40.340]  You know, I've known John Bowne.
[13:40.340 --> 13:44.260]  He's worked here more than 10 years, and I've never seen him put out a report as power
[13:44.260 --> 13:47.180]  powerful as he put out today that's on Band-Aid video.
[13:47.180 --> 13:49.180]  And you know why it's so powerful?
[13:49.180 --> 13:52.820]  Because of the time we live in, just like my broadcast, or more powerful than they've
[13:52.820 --> 13:53.820]  ever been.
[13:53.820 --> 13:54.820]  It's not me.
[13:54.820 --> 14:00.460]  It's the time we live in, the Talitarian's mandate to tear any worldwide.
[14:00.460 --> 14:03.620]  It's only four minutes, 55 seconds long.
[14:03.620 --> 14:08.780]  I suggest if you want to fix things and you don't want to be in a collapsed civilization
[14:08.780 --> 14:11.620]  that you go get that and share it like your life depends on it, because let me give you
[14:11.620 --> 14:15.100]  a little newsflash, it does.
[14:15.100 --> 14:18.860]  I know I'm in a flooding bulkhead and the water's rising.
[14:18.860 --> 14:20.180]  I know I'm captured.
[14:20.180 --> 14:22.100]  I know this is real.
[14:22.100 --> 14:24.100]  I've already dealt with that.
[14:24.100 --> 14:27.980]  I've already psychologically and spiritually prepared for it.
[14:27.980 --> 14:31.700]  The reason I want you to know all this is, is the only hope we've got is for everybody
[14:31.700 --> 14:32.700]  to get this understanding.
[14:32.700 --> 14:36.100]  Because I can tell you, 99% of people in the government, they don't know what's going
[14:36.100 --> 14:37.100]  down.
[14:37.100 --> 14:41.100]  99% of people in the corporations, they don't know what's going down.
[14:41.100 --> 14:46.740]  Whatever if they do, they certainly are believing the official cover story of why all this is
[14:46.740 --> 14:47.740]  good in the end.
[14:47.740 --> 14:49.940]  They're not getting the big picture.
[14:49.940 --> 14:53.420]  But it's going to become rapidly apparent to them that they've been set up, they've
[14:53.420 --> 14:54.620]  been screwed over.
[14:54.620 --> 15:00.220]  And hopefully they don't just engage in pure absolute total Stockholm syndrome and just
[15:00.220 --> 15:04.940]  serve the system even more intensely, hoping somehow they just lock everybody down and
[15:04.940 --> 15:10.100]  force inoculate everybody the lockdowns of the land, because I've got Australia and Germany
[15:10.100 --> 15:17.100]  and Canada and Democrat run states like Oregon in my stack right here saying, oh, this never
[15:17.100 --> 15:18.100]  ends.
[15:18.100 --> 15:19.500]  COVID's quote permanent.
[15:19.500 --> 15:21.140]  You'll always wear masks.
[15:21.140 --> 15:22.140]  They're permanent.
[15:22.140 --> 15:25.140]  And we're going to give you six shots a year.
[15:25.140 --> 15:28.180]  Now I told you 20 something months ago it would be six shots a year, it was in a damn
[15:28.180 --> 15:30.180]  Rockefeller document.
[15:30.180 --> 15:33.300]  And then Gates shot his mouth off.
[15:33.300 --> 15:36.020]  And that's just what they're planning currently.
[15:36.020 --> 15:37.020]  So this is it.
[15:37.020 --> 15:39.300]  This is toe to toe with a new world order.
[15:39.300 --> 15:42.460]  And if you can't believe you're getting attacked and killed, you're going to get killed.
[15:42.460 --> 15:46.380]  If you admit you're under attack, don't accept it.
[15:46.380 --> 15:47.380]  Don't comply.
[15:47.380 --> 15:48.380]  You're going to win.
[15:48.380 --> 15:51.300]  If they get the chains on us like they've done in Australia and Germany, we're going
[15:51.300 --> 15:52.300]  to go down.
[15:52.300 --> 15:57.260]  But as bad as America is, you notice we're still the freest damn country on earth.
[15:57.260 --> 16:00.620]  Let's go ahead and take another.
[16:00.620 --> 16:05.940]  Our 2021 Cyber Week specials end on Monday, December 6.

[16:30.300 --> 16:31.300]  your glands.

[16:42.140 --> 16:43.140]  get an air filtration.
[16:43.140 --> 16:47.540]  But whatever you do, do your shopping there with patriots that are fighting for all of
[16:47.540 --> 16:48.820]  our collective liberties together.
[16:48.820 --> 16:52.260]  If you shop at the big box stores, you deserve to be a slave.
[16:52.260 --> 16:55.860]  If you shop at Info Wars, you're part of the team fighting for liberty.
[16:55.860 --> 16:57.780]  God bless and thanks for your support.
[16:57.780 --> 17:02.460]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[17:02.460 --> 17:07.820]  between free individuals and nation-states on one side and the globalist on the other,
[17:07.820 --> 17:11.060]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[17:11.060 --> 17:15.900]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[17:15.900 --> 17:19.580]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[17:19.580 --> 17:21.500]  That's why they launched their great reset.
[17:21.500 --> 17:26.780]  And their program after collapsing us have built back better.
[17:26.780 --> 17:32.740]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[17:32.740 --> 17:35.580]  Because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow.
[17:35.580 --> 17:40.500]  Because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[17:40.500 --> 17:43.540]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[17:43.540 --> 17:47.420]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[17:47.420 --> 17:48.420]  It's that simple.
[17:48.420 --> 17:51.540]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[17:51.540 --> 17:55.980]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history.
[17:55.980 --> 17:57.980]  This is Sparadon and we win.
[17:57.980 --> 18:04.380]  Cover commander here with an important message to humanity.
[18:04.380 --> 18:12.100]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[18:12.100 --> 18:14.900]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[18:14.900 --> 18:23.940]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can.
[18:23.940 --> 18:32.980]  I also need you to wear a mask, and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[18:32.980 --> 18:39.820]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[18:39.820 --> 18:43.300]  only I own profitable.
[18:43.300 --> 18:45.300]  You will then be my slaves.
[18:45.300 --> 18:53.260]  And then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra, it will remove your immune system,
[18:53.260 --> 18:57.700]  you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[18:57.700 --> 19:03.300]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here, all over the world, from Australia to
[19:03.300 --> 19:05.700]  the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[19:05.700 --> 19:09.020]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to
[19:09.020 --> 19:14.860]  your house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[19:14.860 --> 19:15.860]  facilities.
[19:15.860 --> 19:20.660]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[19:20.660 --> 19:24.660]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[19:24.660 --> 19:26.460]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[19:26.460 --> 19:30.700]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[19:30.700 --> 19:34.980]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[19:34.980 --> 19:37.580]  grade at infowarstore.com.
[19:37.580 --> 19:42.260]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[19:42.260 --> 19:47.980]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[19:47.980 --> 19:50.540]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.

[19:56.300 --> 20:01.740]  at infowarstore.com.
[20:01.740 --> 20:31.100]  Including a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:31.100 --> 20:45.980]  So, you know most of the major comments and asteroids have been discovered not by the
[20:45.980 --> 20:50.940]  radio telescopes of governments, not by the visual telescopes of governments or even
[20:50.940 --> 20:57.260]  universities, but by the millions of amateur astronomers out there.
[20:57.260 --> 21:00.140]  And I kind of use that as an analogy of this show.
[21:00.140 --> 21:03.580]  We've been studying the globalist's plans for a long time, a lot of people before me
[21:03.580 --> 21:04.580]  were studying them.
[21:04.580 --> 21:09.060]  They were always obsessed with depopulation, a world government and cashless societies
[21:09.060 --> 21:12.180]  to control people, but that was theoretical back then.
[21:12.180 --> 21:15.860]  They actually got control of the banking, got control of the currency, got control of
[21:15.860 --> 21:20.780]  society and are now vertically integrating societies using these organized lockdowns
[21:20.780 --> 21:27.300]  they engage in and taking over the planet.
[21:27.300 --> 21:28.540]  And so now here we are.
[21:28.540 --> 21:30.980]  That's not theoretical anymore, we're living in it.
[21:30.980 --> 21:34.780]  So I saw the asteroid when it was out 50 million miles away.
[21:34.780 --> 21:39.980]  Well, now the asteroid's a thousand miles away.
[21:39.980 --> 21:46.660]  In fact, pieces of it have already broken up before it got here, had some leading spurs
[21:46.660 --> 21:47.820]  as they call them.
[21:47.820 --> 21:49.860]  Those are already hitting.
[21:49.860 --> 21:52.820]  This is the planned global deindustrialization.
[21:52.820 --> 21:57.300]  To understand this and how they're personally coming out for myself and others, here's Roger
[21:57.300 --> 22:01.900]  Stone on Tucker Carlson talking about how the Secret Service he believes tried to set
[22:01.900 --> 22:03.540]  him up and I agree with him.
[22:03.540 --> 22:05.380]  I really would have prosecuted you.
[22:05.380 --> 22:07.260]  I think I was being set up.
[22:07.260 --> 22:12.980]  I mean, here's the amazing thing and that is I watched the President's speech from my
[22:12.980 --> 22:19.380]  hotel room at the Willard Hotel and then there was a call on the house phone and two agents
[22:19.380 --> 22:23.140]  from the Secret Service wanted to escort me to the Capitol.
[22:23.140 --> 22:27.420]  Now I've been in politics for a long time, Secret Service doesn't do political chores,
[22:27.420 --> 22:28.420]  they never have.
[22:28.420 --> 22:33.220]  I would have gotten there had I left at that moment at the exact time that these folks
[22:33.220 --> 22:35.220]  broke into the Capitol.
[22:35.220 --> 22:40.700]  Now I know that my friends Alex Jones and Ali Alexander are approached by the Secret
[22:40.700 --> 22:46.940]  Service and asked if they want an escort to the Capitol at the same time.
[22:46.940 --> 22:51.300]  Had Alex Jones not stopped for a bathroom break, they would have gotten there just as
[22:51.300 --> 22:53.740]  the building was being penetrated.
[22:53.740 --> 22:56.860]  As it was, they got there afterwards and you can see it.
[22:56.860 --> 23:01.020]  Jones jumps up on a chair with a bullhorn and says, no, don't go in the building, pull
[23:01.020 --> 23:03.380]  back, this is a peaceful demonstration.
[23:03.380 --> 23:05.780]  He tried to stop it and that's a fact.
[23:05.780 --> 23:10.220]  Sid, do you think the Secret Service wasn't about, Trump's Secret Service wasn't about?
[23:10.220 --> 23:14.100]  I don't know why else they would want to escort me to the Capitol where I had already decided
[23:14.100 --> 23:15.100]  not to go.
[23:15.100 --> 23:16.580]  Why'd you decide not to go?
[23:16.580 --> 23:17.580]  I don't know.
[23:17.580 --> 23:18.580]  It's an excellent question.
[23:18.580 --> 23:23.300]  I had a feeling, I had an intuition, I just did not want to go.
[23:23.300 --> 23:26.500]  I think that God was giving me a signal, I didn't go.
[23:26.500 --> 23:29.860]  By the way, they'll make fun of that too, but that's the fact.
[23:29.860 --> 23:34.580]  The January 6th committee has been an exercise in armed political intimidation.
[23:34.580 --> 23:35.580]  How did it start?
[23:35.580 --> 23:37.060]  You may have forgotten.
[23:37.060 --> 23:41.060]  Congress formed the committee after several members of the U.S. Capitol Police, the same
[23:41.060 --> 23:46.180]  people responsible for protecting members of Congress, anonymously commanded them to
[23:46.180 --> 23:47.180]  do it.
[23:47.180 --> 23:51.180]  This is a ransom note, prosecute our political opponents, that's an order from your bodyguards.
[23:51.180 --> 23:53.100]  Amazingly, they did it.
[23:53.100 --> 23:59.260]  So from the very first day, the January 6th committee was never about gathering information.
[23:59.260 --> 24:02.780]  Obviously, Congress already has the information.
[24:02.780 --> 24:06.980]  Nancy Pelosi knows exactly how many federal agents were in the crowd that day.
[24:06.980 --> 24:08.580]  She won't tell us.
[24:08.580 --> 24:12.620]  Pelosi could release thousands of hours of videotape evidence from January 6th.
[24:12.620 --> 24:14.500]  She refuses to do that.
[24:14.500 --> 24:16.620]  So whatever else this is, don't let them lie to you.
[24:16.620 --> 24:19.500]  This is not a fact-finding effort.
[24:19.500 --> 24:24.140]  This is a highly obvious attempt to punish critics of the Democratic Party, and for months,
[24:24.140 --> 24:26.820]  that's exactly what the committee has been doing.
[24:26.820 --> 24:30.900]  Using the pretext of January 6th, the Biden's Justice Department has indicted former Trump
[24:30.900 --> 24:32.620]  adviser Steve Bannon.
[24:32.620 --> 24:33.620]  What?
[24:33.620 --> 24:34.620]  What was his crime exactly?
[24:34.620 --> 24:37.340]  Oh, talking about election fraud on a radio show.
[24:37.340 --> 24:38.340]  That's illegal now.
[24:38.340 --> 24:41.580]  Pelosi's January 6th committee had him arrested.
[24:41.580 --> 24:47.340]  Liz Cheney, by the way, who is being used as a Republican cover for all of this, stood
[24:47.340 --> 24:48.780]  back and watched it happen.
[24:48.780 --> 24:53.340]  Liz Cheney should be ashamed, but she's become far too degraded for shame, unfortunately.
[24:53.340 --> 24:56.980]  And Bannon, by the way, is not the only prominent Republican who might go to jail.
[24:56.980 --> 25:00.740]  The committee has now subpoenaed several former Trump advisers, as well as the fiancé
[25:00.740 --> 25:01.740]  of another.
[25:01.740 --> 25:05.100]  They've even subpoenaed Roger Stone yet again.
[25:05.100 --> 25:06.740]  Where was Stone on January 6th?
[25:06.740 --> 25:09.580]  He was in a hotel room as the Capitol was being breached.
[25:09.580 --> 25:13.220]  He had literally nothing to do with it, but it doesn't matter.
[25:13.220 --> 25:14.620]  He's criticized Joe Biden.
[25:14.620 --> 25:16.660]  He could be going to jail again.
[25:16.660 --> 25:20.200]  Now the committee has decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the
[25:20.200 --> 25:21.700]  right, Alex Jones.
[25:21.700 --> 25:23.380]  Yes, journalist.
[25:23.380 --> 25:27.180]  Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance, but the truth is he has been a far better
[25:27.180 --> 25:29.500]  guide to reality in recent years.
[25:29.500 --> 25:34.380]  In other words, a far better journalist than, say, NBC News national security correspondent
[25:34.380 --> 25:38.420]  Ken Delanian or Margaret Brennan of CBS.
[25:38.420 --> 25:42.220]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[25:42.220 --> 25:46.180]  And if Jones sat down with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists
[25:46.180 --> 25:47.180]  are supposed to do.
[25:47.180 --> 25:49.820]  He wouldn't just slobber all over him.
[25:49.820 --> 25:53.820]  But Alex Jones makes fun of Joe Biden, so the January 6th committee is threatening him
[25:53.820 --> 25:55.320]  with prison.
[25:55.320 --> 25:59.820]  Now the irony here, and there are many layers of irony here, but the main one is that Alex
[25:59.820 --> 26:04.260]  Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[26:04.260 --> 26:09.700]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[26:09.700 --> 26:13.340]  We're not running interference for Alex Jones, and we're not guessing about it.
[26:13.340 --> 26:17.220]  We happen to know this for a fact, because we looked into it in some detail for Patriot
[26:17.220 --> 26:21.020]  Purge throughout three-part documentary series on Fox Nation.
[26:21.020 --> 26:22.020]  Here are the facts.
[26:22.020 --> 26:30.940]  So the Republican Party, I just want them to hear this message.
[26:30.940 --> 26:33.180]  Look at this crowd.
[26:33.180 --> 26:36.140]  We are the people that you must represent for real.
[26:36.140 --> 26:37.460]  January 6th was all about.
[26:37.460 --> 26:41.260]  It was just about making sure that if you called yourself a conservative, that you stood with
[26:41.260 --> 26:43.180]  the conservative movement.
[26:43.180 --> 26:48.300]  And unfortunately, it spiraled out of control.
[26:48.300 --> 26:51.220]  We coordinated with the U.S. Capitol Police nearly every day.
[26:51.220 --> 26:55.300]  A lot of people don't know that Stop the Steel actually had a permit on the Capitol
[26:55.300 --> 26:56.300]  Ground.
[26:56.300 --> 27:00.900]  So not the Capitol itself, and not the Capitol Plaza, the Capitol Grounds Law 8.
[27:00.900 --> 27:01.900]  We had a permit.
[27:01.900 --> 27:03.460]  Let's just imagine this.
[27:03.460 --> 27:09.620]  20,000 to 50,000 people inside the president's park, we're sitting there at the very front.
[27:09.620 --> 27:12.740]  I'm dead center of the president front row.
[27:12.740 --> 27:16.220]  A Trump campaign staffer walks up to me and says, you know, I'll leave, there are people
[27:16.220 --> 27:22.980]  leaving the overflow, and there are already tens of thousands of people at the U.S. Capitol.
[27:22.980 --> 27:28.460]  With your presence and the presence of Alex Jones, why don't you guys walk down Pennsylvania,
[27:28.460 --> 27:29.460]  gather people together.
[27:29.460 --> 27:31.940]  We're Commodore Creatures!
[27:31.940 --> 27:34.820]  And then position them for your rally on Law 8.
[27:34.820 --> 27:39.700]  I wasn't at the Capitol when it descended into chaos.
[27:39.700 --> 27:43.620]  And that's only by God's grace, because I was scheduled to be there.
[27:43.620 --> 27:46.900]  Secret Service let us out at a point where we would have been there when the first punch
[27:46.900 --> 27:50.220]  was thrown.
[27:50.220 --> 27:51.740]  And that's strange.
[27:51.740 --> 27:55.940]  The only reason that we weren't there is because we stopped and gave an impromptu speech.
[27:55.940 --> 28:07.500]  I get a text from the campaign that you should get there and de-escalate because things are
[28:07.500 --> 28:12.620]  not going well.
[28:12.620 --> 28:18.420]  So we started to approach the side of the Capitol where no protest had happened in November,
[28:18.420 --> 28:21.020]  no protest had happened in December.
[28:21.020 --> 28:25.020]  All I thought was, I need to get them to the other side, and I need to get them to Law 8.
[28:25.020 --> 28:27.780]  Let's march around to the other side.
[28:27.780 --> 28:30.300]  And all we have are equipped with are megaphones.
[28:30.300 --> 28:33.860]  And let's highlight the police and get the system what they want.
[28:33.860 --> 28:36.620]  Maybe a thousand people are listening to us.
[28:36.620 --> 28:38.180]  Come off the stands.
[28:38.180 --> 28:42.180]  And 75 to 100,000 people there in front of us.
[28:42.180 --> 28:44.180]  And it was a very helpless feeling.
[28:44.180 --> 28:51.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, at the competition, at the place, we're going to list out the
[28:51.260 --> 28:52.260]  story.
[28:52.260 --> 28:56.340]  So, folks, we're going to go to break and come back with all of the horrible vaccine
[28:56.340 --> 29:00.020]  poison news and the government suppressing it.
[29:00.020 --> 29:03.340]  I have a question to ask you.
[29:03.340 --> 29:09.100]  Why would you spend your money this Christmas season to buy gifts for friends and family
[29:09.100 --> 29:15.020]  and loved ones with the establishment, with the big corporations that are dedicated to
[29:15.020 --> 29:21.740]  waging war on all of our freedoms and suppressing us and forcing medical tyranny on us?
[29:21.740 --> 29:23.860]  I've never backed down to tyranny.
[29:23.860 --> 29:27.700]  We've had incredible successes fighting them thanks to your support.
[29:27.700 --> 29:34.780]  But now, as 2021 comes to a close, I want to encourage you now more than ever to support

[31:17.180 --> 31:21.020]  their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.

[31:58.660 --> 32:03.460]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[32:03.460 --> 32:05.500]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[32:05.500 --> 32:11.180]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational,
[32:11.180 --> 32:12.180]  but we failed.
[32:12.180 --> 32:13.660]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[32:13.660 --> 32:19.420]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[32:19.420 --> 32:21.780]  deindustrialization great reset.
[32:21.780 --> 32:26.100]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[32:26.100 --> 32:30.700]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[32:30.700 --> 32:33.940]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, and
[32:33.940 --> 32:35.740]  we've also got to get personally prepared.
[32:35.740 --> 32:38.620]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[32:38.620 --> 32:43.580]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarsstore.com.

[33:01.940 --> 33:07.940]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.940 --> 33:42.620]  We're a TV viewer, we're showing you footage of Luxembourg, Germany, where thousands of
[33:42.620 --> 33:49.380]  people have broken through a vaccine checkpoint, not letting them into the quote Christmas market.
[33:49.380 --> 33:51.920]  This is the real rebellion against tyranny.
[33:51.920 --> 33:59.260]  This is the real human revolution and we salute those people involved in civil disobedience.
[33:59.260 --> 34:03.820]  Now is the time because what they can do in Germany today, they can do here tomorrow and
[34:03.820 --> 34:08.660]  Germany's announced forced inoculation door to door on February 1st, if not you go to
[34:08.660 --> 34:13.500]  a camp as the Germans are putting people in camps again when they of course are involved
[34:13.500 --> 34:16.900]  with the UN and the creation of COVID-19.
[34:16.900 --> 34:23.300]  I'm going to hit that information in this hour, the latest developments that are so
[34:23.300 --> 34:24.300]  important.
[34:24.300 --> 34:29.660]  I was just playing some of the really powerful information that Tucker Carlson has to say.
[34:29.660 --> 34:32.620]  If I have time, I'll play that next hour.
[34:32.620 --> 34:37.340]  Tucker Carlson, tyranny is coming unless someone stops Democrats' COVID power grab.
[34:37.340 --> 34:43.340]  But it's a UN worldwide, Klaus Schwab, Debo's group power grab and he knows that, he's just
[34:43.340 --> 34:47.940]  pointing out their political operation here in America because he doesn't think the public
[34:47.940 --> 34:51.180]  is informed yet about who exactly is in control of it.
[34:51.180 --> 34:52.180]  He'll get there.
[34:52.180 --> 34:58.420]  Tucker's very good at bringing his audience along like nobody else does.
[34:58.420 --> 35:01.100]  Joe Rogan's a close second.
[35:01.100 --> 35:05.940]  But let's talk about another hero who has not minced words and who has, I'm not saying
[35:05.940 --> 35:14.260]  Tucker has, but who's really cut to the bone here, Vagano, Archbishop Vagano, who life
[35:14.260 --> 35:19.380]  side has interviewed who I'm very, very jealous of and who I'm trying to work on getting on.
[35:19.380 --> 35:23.780]  But regardless, there's almost no point in getting the Archbishop on because everything
[35:23.780 --> 35:25.460]  he says is so on target.
[35:25.460 --> 35:27.860]  I mean, nothing he says is wrong.
[35:27.860 --> 35:31.020]  It's dead on.
[35:31.020 --> 35:35.260]  So here's a gateway pundit article that I'm going to ask Jamie White, our great writer
[35:35.260 --> 35:40.660]  that's out there right now, to add the live show feed article today so that you can all
[35:40.660 --> 35:42.620]  go read it.
[35:42.620 --> 35:48.100]  Those who resist the new world order will have the help and protection of God, Italian
[35:48.100 --> 35:54.620]  Archbishop Vagano says, you can say what you want about the Catholic church or the institutions,
[35:54.620 --> 35:59.860]  but this guy is telling the truth and Christ said that you judge a tree by its fruits.
[35:59.860 --> 36:07.180]  So I'm going to read to you some of the transcript of the interview that's linked in this article.
[36:07.180 --> 36:14.300]  Archbishop Vagano is the object of evil attacks by the mainstream media because he is a polar
[36:14.300 --> 36:18.940]  star of hope for those Catholics and even nonbelievers who have a thirst for justice
[36:18.940 --> 36:22.340]  and common sense in this upside down world.
[36:22.340 --> 36:26.300]  The Archbishop shares a special message with us in the gateway pundit.
[36:26.300 --> 36:30.420]  And again, he speaks English, so you can go watch the video and hear the audio of the
[36:30.420 --> 36:34.380]  radio and TV interview.
[36:34.380 --> 36:39.220]  I, you and your twin brother Jim are in my prayers.
[36:39.220 --> 36:42.500]  The fact that you are being attacked by the system is proof that you were on the right
[36:42.500 --> 36:43.820]  side.
[36:43.820 --> 36:46.540]  No perseverance and don't be intimidated.
[36:46.540 --> 36:47.540]  We're at war.
[36:47.540 --> 36:48.540]  We have to fight.
[36:48.540 --> 36:53.940]  That's what he's saying to the talk show host below are some of the comments from a recent
[36:53.940 --> 36:58.140]  interview published yesterday when asked about being labeled a public enemy.
[36:58.140 --> 37:06.500]  Archbishop Vagano responded with the following as I have previously noted, it is typical
[37:06.500 --> 37:13.340]  of any totalitarian regime to seek to delegitimize any and every form of dissent.
[37:13.340 --> 37:19.700]  But first by ridiculing the adversary, making him the object of derision, so as to discredit
[37:19.700 --> 37:27.340]  him before the eyes of the public opinion, that after delegitimizing the person as pathological
[37:27.340 --> 37:33.380]  or in need of psychiatric care, suggesting that the adversary is mentally unstable, who
[37:33.380 --> 37:35.940]  should be hospitalized in a mental institution.
[37:35.940 --> 37:40.300]  Finally, the process ends with a complete criminalization of all dissenters.
[37:40.300 --> 37:46.860]  In this way, the regime creates the necessary premise to separate all its adversaries from
[37:46.860 --> 37:51.340]  civil society.
[37:51.340 --> 37:56.020]  When asked about spies attending mass as a priest who warned their congregations about
[37:56.020 --> 38:00.020]  the perils of COVID vaccines, the Archbishop replied, this is happening.
[38:00.020 --> 38:04.460]  I've got articles of British and U.S. doctors being fired that just even question it, even
[38:04.460 --> 38:06.580]  though they're reading real science.
[38:06.580 --> 38:22.460]  I think that every priest has a right or rather the duty to warn his faithful about the real
[38:22.460 --> 38:31.020]  danger not at all merely hypothetical represented by the inculcation of this experimental medical
[38:31.020 --> 38:32.020]  product.
[38:32.020 --> 38:33.020]  It's an inculcation.
[38:33.020 --> 38:35.260]  It's a total takeover society.
[38:35.260 --> 38:41.500]  This is especially the case when the entire psychopandemic farce clearly aims to lead
[38:41.500 --> 38:46.260]  towards the establishment of a dictatorship whose purpose is to control the citizens through
[38:46.260 --> 38:51.860]  a violation of their constitutional and national rights under the guise of a health emergency.
[38:51.860 --> 38:59.220]  At another point, the Archbishop warned about the preparation that took place before the
[38:59.220 --> 39:00.220]  pandemic.
[39:00.220 --> 39:01.220]  Oh, absolutely.
[39:01.220 --> 39:02.980]  Totally staged.
[39:02.980 --> 39:08.660]  The operation required meticulous preparation and needed the participation of large parts
[39:08.660 --> 39:13.900]  of the public institutions and the private sectors, including the complicity of the judiciary,
[39:13.900 --> 39:15.900]  of law enforcement and the media.
[39:15.900 --> 39:24.140]  These combined efforts are a real coup d'etat and the pandemic is a pretext, the prophesiesis
[39:24.140 --> 39:28.940]  through which it introduced, I guess that's the proboscis, the needle, through which it
[39:28.940 --> 39:35.540]  introduced the seemingly inevitable and inevitability of the violation of fundamental rights and
[39:35.540 --> 39:41.060]  the consequent establishment of the utilitarian regime of the new order.
[39:41.060 --> 39:47.620]  In this new order, the pandemic superstition reigns supreme, it's a new religion.
[39:47.620 --> 39:55.900]  With its magicians, its vaccine temples, its irrational rituals, and its excommunications
[39:55.900 --> 40:00.140]  of sinners to be avoided or to be shunned.
[40:00.140 --> 40:06.420]  Those who do not agree or give up their reason even before apostatizing from their faith
[40:06.420 --> 40:12.740]  in order to embrace this insane ideological madness.
[40:12.740 --> 40:15.740]  By the way, their own internal documents, the deep state admits this is the new religion,
[40:15.740 --> 40:18.700]  the medical tyranny, that you're dirty, you're bad, but they give you the sacrament that
[40:18.700 --> 40:22.460]  makes you safe, that actually kills you.
[40:22.460 --> 40:28.860]  In response to the new world order, he says the new world order is neither new nor order.
[40:28.860 --> 40:35.820]  It represents the foolish ambitions of Satan to overthrow the providential plan of God,
[40:35.820 --> 40:40.260]  to cancel the true religion that leads to eternal salvation, and finally to replace
[40:40.260 --> 40:46.780]  the order of the Christian with infernal chaos.
[40:46.780 --> 40:52.060]  In this disorder, the lie replaces the truth and justice and abuse of power replace justice
[40:52.060 --> 40:58.020]  when instead of obedience to the law of God, death instead of life, illness instead of
[40:58.020 --> 41:05.900]  health, legitimization of evil, and the condemnation of good, the persecution of good people, and
[41:05.900 --> 41:10.460]  the praising of evil ones, ignorance in the place of culture and wisdom, ugliness and
[41:10.460 --> 41:16.220]  horror instead of beauty, division and hatred instead of harmony and love, Satan doesn't
[41:16.220 --> 41:23.540]  want to be worshiped by adopting the qualities of God, but by demanding to be an object of
[41:23.540 --> 41:28.820]  adoration through everything that is evil, obscene, false, absurd and monstrous.
[41:28.820 --> 41:39.780]  He seeks complete subversion, a subversion, a total devilish and anti-christic new world
[41:39.780 --> 41:47.020]  order obtained by means of global coup d'etat imposed under the guise of an engineered planned
[41:47.020 --> 41:50.420]  emergency.
[41:50.420 --> 41:57.220]  The vaccine campaign, lacking any scientific validity, serves first of us all as the apparent
[41:57.220 --> 42:00.420]  legitimization for implementing global tracking and controls.
[42:00.420 --> 42:04.780]  Today, are the pretexts of limiting COVID spread, a pretext which is false, because
[42:04.780 --> 42:11.140]  among the reasons the vaccinated can still become infected and be contagious, yeah.
[42:11.140 --> 42:15.100]  What's the difference between people who had three shots and no shots, you're not fully
[42:15.100 --> 42:18.620]  vaccinated, you're all the same, whether you've had three shots or no shots, you're all the
[42:18.620 --> 42:23.620]  same, you're not fully vaccinated, you're never fully vaccinated, you're never sanctified.
[42:23.620 --> 42:28.420]  But tomorrow this campaign aims to expand its reach, extending the green pass to include
[42:28.420 --> 42:34.980]  information used for social credit system to confront a green emergency, which will be
[42:34.980 --> 42:40.540]  likewise false and specious, and it just goes on from there, it's so damn powerful.
[42:40.540 --> 42:44.340]  I'm gonna have the full thing linked up on infowars.com.
[42:44.340 --> 42:51.860]  Oh, it's on Bandod video already, yep, global retaliationism, a bigger threat than the virus,
[42:51.860 --> 43:00.140]  from the LifeSite news site on Bandod video, we'll be right back on Alex Jones.

[43:55.260 --> 43:56.940]  God bless, and thanks for your support.
[43:56.940 --> 43:58.940]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[43:58.940 --> 44:00.940]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[44:00.940 --> 44:01.940]  Welcome.
[44:01.940 --> 44:02.940]  Hello, Alex.
[44:02.940 --> 44:03.940]  Yes, Malcolm.
[44:03.940 --> 44:06.260]  All right, I will make this quick and real short, where the other patriots can get on
[44:06.260 --> 44:07.260]  the line.
[44:07.260 --> 44:11.900]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[44:11.900 --> 44:17.340]  Vitality and Brainforce Plus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[44:17.340 --> 44:19.180]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[44:19.180 --> 44:25.340]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up, and so it has
[44:25.340 --> 44:30.260]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't
[44:30.260 --> 44:31.260]  as strong.
[44:31.260 --> 44:32.660]  This is like a very fine wine.
[44:32.660 --> 44:35.060]  In fact, each batch is different.
[44:35.060 --> 44:37.020]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[44:37.020 --> 44:40.180]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[44:40.180 --> 44:41.180]  strong?
[44:41.180 --> 44:42.180]  Well, it is.
[44:42.180 --> 44:43.180]  It's how it works.
[44:43.180 --> 44:44.740]  So it's always good.
[44:44.740 --> 44:48.820]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong, but yeah, if you want the Rolls-Royce at
[44:48.820 --> 44:57.100]  a decent price, then this is it.
[44:57.100 --> 45:01.540]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[45:01.540 --> 45:02.900]  I like going to concerts.
[45:02.900 --> 45:04.260]  I like going to play golf.
[45:04.260 --> 45:05.660]  I like going out to dinner.
[45:05.660 --> 45:07.700]  I like the metropolitan life.
[45:07.700 --> 45:10.140]  I like everything that comes with this.
[45:10.140 --> 45:16.220]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities,
[45:16.220 --> 45:20.820]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon, it's
[45:20.820 --> 45:21.820]  all crashing down.
[45:21.820 --> 45:25.780]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in
[45:25.780 --> 45:29.220]  the woods and just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off
[45:29.220 --> 45:30.220]  the land?
[45:30.220 --> 45:31.220]  That's the survival instinct.
[45:31.220 --> 45:35.060]  But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says, no,
[45:35.060 --> 45:37.060]  no, no, no, stay in the city.
[45:37.060 --> 45:40.460]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you
[45:40.460 --> 45:42.260]  need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[45:42.260 --> 45:47.780]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you and the audience are facing
[45:47.780 --> 45:48.780]  as well.
[45:48.780 --> 45:53.580]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies, and so we
[45:53.580 --> 45:57.260]  have the best ones at m4store.com.
[45:57.260 --> 45:59.500]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[45:59.500 --> 46:01.100]  Why do the globalists take you so much?
[46:01.100 --> 46:04.300]  Why do they hate America so much?
[46:04.300 --> 46:10.820]  It's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist
[46:10.820 --> 46:11.820]  with.
[46:11.820 --> 46:12.820]  It's very, very simple.
[46:12.820 --> 46:18.940]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenics system to flourish, freedom
[46:18.940 --> 46:24.940]  and liberty and due process, injustice and God fearing systems must fail.
[46:24.940 --> 46:27.500]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[46:27.500 --> 46:30.460]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[46:30.460 --> 46:32.380]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[46:32.380 --> 46:37.340]  They started a fight with you, and they're not going to back down, and they're not going
[46:37.340 --> 46:42.820]  to go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear
[46:42.820 --> 46:44.580]  of God put into them.
[46:44.580 --> 46:48.660]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism
[46:48.660 --> 46:53.220]  or about corporate fascism, and it's not until people understand that and that we're under
[46:53.220 --> 47:07.340]  the attack we have any chance of beating these people.
[30:42.080 --> 47:32.020]  going to happen.
[47:32.020 --> 47:35.820]  I'm going to play part of a Tucker Carlson breakdown on the fraud of this whole COVID
[47:35.820 --> 47:36.820]  rollout.
[47:36.820 --> 47:41.700]  We're going to start the second hour, and then I'm going to cover these five stacks
[47:41.700 --> 47:47.460]  of news you see right here that are government documents and admissions that they know the
[47:47.460 --> 47:52.980]  vaccine isn't a vaccine that erases your immune system and gives you cancer and heart attacks
[47:52.980 --> 47:53.980]  and blood clots.
[47:53.980 --> 48:02.260]  I'm going to show you from the CDC website, from the FDA website, okay?
[48:02.260 --> 48:04.340]  And people are like, well, this is insane.
[48:04.340 --> 48:05.500]  Why are they killing us?
[48:05.500 --> 48:06.740]  Why did Hitler do what he did?
[48:06.740 --> 48:12.620]  Why did Stalin and why did Mao kill, while he was in power, 80 million of his own people?
[48:12.620 --> 48:17.460]  The Chinese government admits that, 86 million is their number.
[48:17.460 --> 48:24.940]  The CIA says he killed 67 million, who knows?
[48:24.940 --> 48:30.020]  It's like people denying, Hitler killed people, Hitler probably killed 20 million people, hell,
[48:30.020 --> 48:36.020]  the Soviets killed more of their own people than that.
[48:36.020 --> 48:42.620]  So in a day and age where Wikipedia is taking down links saying the Communist killed tens
[48:42.620 --> 48:50.420]  of millions in Russia saying, well, you can't prove that when it's on record.
[48:50.420 --> 48:54.860]  The same groups are denying that there aren't just two sexes.
[48:54.860 --> 48:55.860]  It's a war on reality.
[48:55.860 --> 49:01.900]  I got a bunch of examples of that as well that we're going to be getting to next hour.
[49:01.900 --> 49:09.220]  But I'm going to hit all of this, but I wanted to just finish reading from Joe Hoft on the
[49:09.220 --> 49:13.620]  Gateway Pundit that's just a small part of a transcript of an interview that Archbishop
[49:13.620 --> 49:18.060]  Viago, I wish we had him over here in the U.S., had to say because everything he says
[49:18.060 --> 49:19.220]  is this true.
[49:19.220 --> 49:22.620]  Everything he says is this on target.
[49:22.620 --> 49:24.860]  He's a real blessing.
[49:24.860 --> 49:30.380]  And he says here, just the end of this transcript that I was trying to read earlier, we went
[49:30.380 --> 49:36.300]  to break, the vaccine campaign lacking any scientific validity serves first of all as
[49:36.300 --> 49:40.020]  an apparent legitimization for implementing global tracking and controls.
[49:40.020 --> 49:41.740]  Yep, that's step one.
[49:41.740 --> 49:45.860]  Today under the pretext of COVID spread, a pretext which is false because among other
[49:45.860 --> 49:49.660]  reasons the vaccine could still become effective, in fact, they're more likely to spread it
[49:49.660 --> 49:50.860]  and be contagious.
[49:50.860 --> 49:56.620]  But tomorrow the campaign aims to expand its reach, extended the green pass, this is officially
[49:56.620 --> 50:02.540]  announced, it's part two, to include information used as a social credit system and a carbon
[50:02.540 --> 50:08.420]  tax, I would add, to confront a, quote, green emergency, that's the carbon tax, which will
[50:08.420 --> 50:10.660]  be likewise false and spacious.
[50:10.660 --> 50:16.580]  The green pass is being conceived as something like the Mark of the Beast mentioned in Apocalypse
[50:16.580 --> 50:22.780]  of St. John to allow or forbid people to buy, sell, travel, spend, eat or live.
[50:22.780 --> 50:26.340]  It's already here.
[50:26.340 --> 50:32.940]  Secondarily, the inoculation of people, the experimental genetic serum, that's what it
[50:32.940 --> 50:38.060]  is, that provokes a weakening of our natural immune system, hell it basically erases it,
[50:38.060 --> 50:42.540]  represents a very grave crime, yeah, it's like synthetic aids.
[50:42.540 --> 50:46.780]  Because it turns ordinary healthy people into chronically ill people and consequently into
[50:46.780 --> 50:49.980]  customers for healthcare companies and private care.
[50:49.980 --> 50:54.180]  This situation hugely inflates the profits of the globalists to lead and brings the general
[50:54.180 --> 50:56.540]  impoverishment of the population up.
[50:56.540 --> 51:03.140]  You need to go see the full interview, it's right there.
[51:03.140 --> 51:08.340]  So just here's some from Tucker on this, but here's the deal, Joe's almost there, he's
[51:08.340 --> 51:16.260]  basically there, I know probably he gets it all, Tucker's there, so's Viago, and we need
[51:16.260 --> 51:20.660]  to get Rand Paul and others there, and I'm going to talk some about that next hour because
[51:20.660 --> 51:26.020]  there's a video that's gone viral, Jones declares war on Trump, if he doesn't say he was misled.
[51:26.020 --> 51:31.860]  Because now with this FDA stuff, I mean I'm going to go to Marlago and Bullhorn the place.
[51:31.860 --> 51:34.740]  I've already made calls through, I know Trump knows this stuff.
[51:34.740 --> 51:39.940]  His chief of staff, you know Meadows has been confronted about it, if Trump doesn't start
[51:39.940 --> 51:44.660]  coming out against this, then he's aiding and abetting and he signed on to it.
[51:44.660 --> 51:49.220]  And here's the deal, it's not about just bashing Trump, but if he came out against
[51:49.220 --> 51:52.740]  all this, it became over.
[51:52.740 --> 51:56.900]  And I get they might kill him, but I mean they might kill me doing this, they're coming
[51:56.900 --> 52:00.500]  after children now, they're injecting millions of children, there's heart attacks and little
[52:00.500 --> 52:03.780]  kids happening, I will not be part of this.
[52:03.780 --> 52:07.220]  I'm not signed on to all this stuff, and by the way that's a whole other section, I'll
[52:07.220 --> 52:13.540]  get to next hour, everybody's calling me going, oh my God, they admit the CIA was raping children
[52:13.540 --> 52:19.220]  running pettifall rings, how did you know about it, it came out before, back when the FBI wasn't
[52:19.220 --> 52:26.260]  totally controlled, they raided in the 80s the CIA, NDC running a giant pedophile production
[52:26.260 --> 52:32.260]  facility, I mean that's all coming up next hour as well.
[52:32.260 --> 52:38.100]  So we're going to be talking about every bit of it here today.
[52:38.100 --> 52:42.820]  Here's part of Tucker Carlson, the full video, it's on infowars.com, Tucker Carlson.
[52:42.820 --> 52:47.060]  The tyranny is coming unless someone stops the Democrats, COVID power grab, I mean it's
[52:47.060 --> 52:48.060]  actually here.
[52:48.060 --> 52:52.500]  So, so going along with things makes your life worse folks, the only hope's getting off
[52:52.500 --> 52:55.780]  the bench, then we'll play five minutes of Tucker, go to break, come back with a second
[52:55.780 --> 52:56.780]  hour, here it is.
[52:56.780 --> 53:01.420]  People living in the nation of Mozambique along the southern coast of Africa woke up
[53:01.420 --> 53:05.940]  to pretty surprising news this week, not a ton has been happening in Mozambique in recent
[53:05.940 --> 53:08.420]  years, but this really rattled them a little bit.
[53:08.420 --> 53:12.940]  The Biden administration informed people of Mozambique in a presidential proclamation
[53:12.940 --> 53:17.460]  supposedly signed by Biden himself that they are no longer allowed in the United States.
[53:17.460 --> 53:23.100]  Now it's nothing personal, it's Omicron, the new COVID variant that has been used to justify
[53:23.100 --> 53:25.460]  lockdowns around the world.
[53:25.460 --> 53:30.900]  The problem is, and the confusion came from the fact, that there is no Omicron in Mozambique.
[53:30.900 --> 53:34.140]  There's not a single case of it in the country.
[53:34.140 --> 53:38.060]  So it's possible that one of the equity hires at the White House confused Mozambique with
[53:38.060 --> 53:43.660]  Botswana, where the other day two people may possibly have died of Omicron.
[53:43.660 --> 53:47.020]  Other way Mozambique and Botswana don't even share a border, so people in Mozambique were
[53:47.020 --> 53:50.060]  highly confused and probably a little hurt.
[53:50.060 --> 53:54.900]  Today, Tony Fauci, who is the person of course who signed off on this travel ban, was asked
[53:54.900 --> 53:57.540]  about this by an African reporter.
[53:57.540 --> 54:02.860]  You know Fauci replied, that's a good question, an important question.
[54:02.860 --> 54:06.620]  And then Fauci didn't answer it, or even hint at an answer.
[54:06.620 --> 54:10.860]  So as of right now, we still don't know why there is a White House travel ban on Mozambique.
[54:10.860 --> 54:14.260]  Presumably the answer is, because it's in Africa.
[54:14.260 --> 54:17.820]  In Africa is where all of this started just a few days ago, when the head of the South
[54:17.820 --> 54:23.860]  Africa Medical Association, a physician called Anjuli Kotsi, noted that she had seen patients
[54:23.860 --> 54:26.740]  with a new variant of the coronavirus.
[54:26.740 --> 54:31.420]  Within hours of her saying that, politicians in the United States and many other countries
[54:31.420 --> 54:37.860]  began planning elaborate and highly punitive new measures against their own populations.
[54:37.860 --> 54:42.580]  From her office in Pretoria, Dr. Kotsi watched all of this happen with her jaw open.
[54:42.580 --> 54:43.580]  She was horrified.
[54:43.580 --> 54:47.700]  Quote, I have been stunned at the response Kotsi wrote today in a piece of the Daily
[54:47.700 --> 54:48.700]  Mail.
[54:48.700 --> 54:53.620]  No one here in South Africa is known to have been hospitalized with the Omicron variant,
[54:53.620 --> 54:56.580]  nor has anyone here believed to have fallen seriously ill with it.
[54:56.580 --> 55:02.260]  Quote, in other words, Omicron, whatever it is, is far less dangerous than pretty much
[55:02.260 --> 55:05.660]  everything else that's currently going on in South Africa at the moment.
[55:05.660 --> 55:07.180]  But it didn't matter.
[55:07.180 --> 55:12.100]  By this point, the Biden administration had stopped listening to Dr. Anjuli Kotsi.
[55:12.100 --> 55:15.020]  They'd gotten what they needed from her and they moved on.
[55:15.020 --> 55:19.940]  So here's Tony Fauci today announcing that the terrifying scourge of Omicron has reached
[55:19.940 --> 55:20.940]  our shores.
[55:20.940 --> 55:28.940]  A recent case of COVID-19 among an individual in California was caused by the Omicron variant.
[55:28.940 --> 55:35.140]  The individual was fully vaccinated and experienced mild symptoms which are improving at this
[55:35.140 --> 55:36.140]  point.
[55:36.140 --> 55:39.660]  Okay, so let's just parse this just for a moment.
[55:39.660 --> 55:45.580]  A fully vaccinated person in California has Omicron and is doing fine.
[55:45.580 --> 55:47.620]  So what can we conclude rationally from this?
[55:47.620 --> 55:51.860]  Well, obviously the most stringent COVID restrictions in the country are not stopping
[55:51.860 --> 55:57.660]  the spread, masking, social distancing, non-step anxiety, talking about COVID from dawn to
[55:57.660 --> 55:58.660]  dusk.
[55:58.660 --> 56:02.260]  None of it worked and the vaccines didn't work either.
[56:02.260 --> 56:06.860]  The patient in California had two injections and still got Omicron.
[56:06.860 --> 56:11.100]  So maybe the lesson here is viruses are very hard to stop.
[56:11.100 --> 56:15.540]  Sometimes they're virtually impossible to stop because they spread with remarkable efficiency.
[56:15.540 --> 56:21.580]  In the case of coronaviruses, they live in animals, so they're never going away, ever,
[56:21.580 --> 56:22.580]  no matter what.
[56:22.580 --> 56:25.300]  They don't tell you that, but it's true.
[56:25.300 --> 56:29.860]  So given all of those facts, it's possible we would be better off working on medicines
[56:29.860 --> 56:33.460]  to keep those viruses from killing vulnerable people.
[56:33.460 --> 56:36.420]  That seems like a rational approach to the problem.
[56:36.420 --> 56:41.700]  And yet is the one thing the Biden administration is completely uninterested in doing.
[56:41.700 --> 56:44.580]  No interest whatsoever in doing that.
[56:44.580 --> 56:48.340]  And Biden announced today that the lesson he is drawing from the harmless infection
[56:48.340 --> 56:53.220]  of a fully vaccinated person in the state of California is that this is a pandemic of
[56:53.220 --> 56:55.220]  the unvaccinated.
[56:55.220 --> 56:56.900]  They're the ones to blame for it.
[56:56.900 --> 57:00.660]  Not the Chinese government, which likely created this virus and has definitely profited
[57:00.660 --> 57:01.660]  from it immensely.
[57:01.660 --> 57:02.660]  No, no, no.
[57:02.660 --> 57:08.900]  Omicron and COVID more broadly said the president are the direct responsibility of the 20% of
[57:08.900 --> 57:13.460]  the adult American population, many of whom have natural immunity who have resisted submitting
[57:13.460 --> 57:15.620]  to his injections.
[57:15.620 --> 57:17.140]  And they must be crushed for that.
[57:17.140 --> 57:22.140]  Now, if that's what is hardly worth explaining, we're going to go to break here and over the
[57:22.140 --> 57:24.020]  next 10 minutes, he really lays it all out.
[57:24.020 --> 57:29.460]  But when we come back, I have the South African president exposing all of this BS as well.
[57:29.460 --> 57:34.060]  You see, the globalists want to totally lock Africa down and not let them have any trade
[57:34.060 --> 57:36.220]  to kill hundreds of millions of them, starvation.
[57:36.220 --> 57:41.100]  I told you that the next outbreak will be blamed on Africa a year ago so they could shut
[57:41.100 --> 57:42.340]  them down and kill them.
[57:42.340 --> 57:44.340]  So all you left is signing on to the lockdown.
[57:44.340 --> 57:46.500]  You want to murder hundreds of millions of black people.
[57:46.500 --> 57:47.500]  You murdering trash.
[57:47.500 --> 57:48.500]  This is a great sponsor.
[57:48.500 --> 57:57.220]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high quality, high-rated
[57:57.220 --> 57:58.220]  satellite phone.
[57:58.220 --> 58:02.260]  If you can't be tracked, you can't be traced and it'll work anywhere in the world where
[58:02.260 --> 58:03.260]  you can see the sky.
[58:03.260 --> 58:06.860]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car in your house that also are on
[58:06.860 --> 58:07.860]  the site.
[58:07.860 --> 58:12.860]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks, they supply the board with their systems
[58:12.860 --> 58:13.860]  as well.
[58:13.860 --> 58:22.100]  They're amazing folks and you get a free phone of $650 value, absolutely free at m4warsphone.com.
[58:22.100 --> 58:24.140]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[58:24.140 --> 58:25.140]  These aren't.
[58:25.140 --> 58:26.540]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[58:26.540 --> 58:31.340]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[58:31.340 --> 58:33.700]  So the calls you are free works like a regular cell phone.
[58:33.700 --> 58:34.700]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[58:34.700 --> 58:38.740]  And I keep on my car, I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere
[58:38.740 --> 58:40.540]  where regular phones don't work, they work.
[58:40.540 --> 58:49.620]  m4warsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[58:49.620 --> 58:59.260]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains
[58:59.260 --> 59:05.020]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[59:05.020 --> 59:06.020]  in place.
[59:06.020 --> 59:10.260]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[59:10.260 --> 59:15.660]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[59:15.660 --> 59:18.540]  faces from the light of the sun.
[59:18.540 --> 59:26.740]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[59:26.740 --> 59:33.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now, the entire future destiny of humanity
[59:33.100 --> 59:34.100]  is upon us.
[59:34.100 --> 59:38.060]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[59:38.060 --> 59:40.860]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[59:40.860 --> 59:45.620]  Things only get worse from here if we submit, they only get better if we resist and say
[59:45.620 --> 59:46.620]  no.
[59:46.620 --> 59:51.060]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[59:51.060 --> 59:57.020]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:21.060 --> 1:00:29.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two on this live, original
[1:00:29.220 --> 1:00:30.220]  Sunday Transmission.
[1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:37.460]  In one hour, Owen Schroyer with Sunday Live takes over and tomorrow, yet Gary Franchi
[1:00:37.460 --> 1:00:42.500]  who's from Chicago, old friend of mine, very popular talk show host in studio, I'm going
[1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:44.940]  to have dinner and just set that up.
[1:00:44.940 --> 1:00:50.900]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, I'll just be honest with you.
[1:00:50.900 --> 1:00:56.380]  I get in here and re-research all this stuff and see all the new stuff coming in and I've
[1:00:56.380 --> 1:00:58.260]  got a problem where this is all just overwhelming.
[1:00:58.260 --> 1:01:00.460]  I know it's overwhelming to you as well.
[1:01:00.460 --> 1:01:06.100]  We have articles coming up next segment where the government and the corporations know they're
[1:01:06.100 --> 1:01:08.380]  killing us and it's on purpose.
[1:01:08.380 --> 1:01:12.380]  And I know that's the message of this show, but it's public now, okay?
[1:01:12.380 --> 1:01:19.260]  I mean, it's not even debated, it's like something you've all seen in front of the
[1:01:19.260 --> 1:01:21.420]  world happen.
[1:01:21.420 --> 1:01:27.300]  Like we don't know if O.J. Simpson really killed his wife and Ron Goldman, but we know
[1:01:27.300 --> 1:01:34.380]  he ran from police in a white Bronco.
[1:01:34.380 --> 1:01:40.340]  Or this shirt I'm wearing is navy blue and the watch I'm wearing has got an army green
[1:01:40.340 --> 1:01:41.340]  strap on it.
[1:01:41.340 --> 1:01:46.860]  I mean, it's not debatable that this is going on.
[1:01:46.860 --> 1:01:50.460]  And so the answer is, what are we going to do about this?
[1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:58.420]  Because if I explain that this gets worse as it goes, oh my God, we're into year three
[1:01:58.420 --> 1:01:59.420]  or year four.
[1:01:59.420 --> 1:02:03.780]  The worst 15 days, the worst part of the 15 days of flattening the curve is the first
[1:02:03.780 --> 1:02:05.780]  two years.
[1:02:05.780 --> 1:02:08.380]  We'll be two years into this in a month.
[1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:14.220]  It'll be three years, four years, five years, 10 years, 20 years, 1,000 years.
[1:02:14.220 --> 1:02:19.740]  This is never going to end until we're all dead.
[1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:24.940]  And they're already saying it's the unvaccinated on all the late night comedy shows and on
[1:02:24.940 --> 1:02:26.860]  all the so-called new shows.
[1:02:26.860 --> 1:02:29.420]  It's the people that didn't take the shots.
[1:02:29.420 --> 1:02:31.420]  They're the villains.
[1:02:31.420 --> 1:02:34.460]  Anthony Fauci's not the villains at Jimmy Kimmel Friday night.
[1:02:34.460 --> 1:02:35.620]  It's the unvaccinated.
[1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:36.620]  They're murderers.
[1:02:36.620 --> 1:02:41.580]  It doesn't matter if it's not a vaccine, it doesn't matter if it makes you transmit
[1:02:41.580 --> 1:02:42.580]  it more.
[1:02:42.580 --> 1:02:44.620]  Because that's what it's designed to do.
[1:02:44.620 --> 1:02:48.260]  It doesn't matter if there's way more deaths worldwide this year than there were last year
[1:02:48.260 --> 1:02:51.100]  from the shots.
[1:02:51.100 --> 1:03:00.820]  These people have signed on to kill us because that's the response of these globalist bankers.
[1:03:00.820 --> 1:03:05.260]  And now they're saying, oh, the hospitals are all full of dead and dying from Omnicron.
[1:03:05.260 --> 1:03:06.380]  That's all made up.
[1:03:06.380 --> 1:03:09.380]  It's from the vaccine.
[1:03:09.380 --> 1:03:13.940]  And we said a year ago, by next winter, there'll be all these deaths from A.D.E. and these
[1:03:13.940 --> 1:03:16.780]  other issues, and they'll say it's a new variant.
[1:03:16.780 --> 1:03:22.380]  And sure as hell, exactly what we said is here.
[1:03:22.380 --> 1:03:27.820]  So the next phase, we told you, Australia and Germany are a year ahead of us.
[1:03:27.820 --> 1:03:30.020]  So Spain, so is Austria.
[1:03:30.020 --> 1:03:31.620]  I said a year ago.
[1:03:31.620 --> 1:03:35.660]  I said in about a year, Germany will start arresting people that aren't inoculated and
[1:03:35.660 --> 1:03:39.060]  take them to FEMA camps, take them to emergency camps.
[1:03:39.060 --> 1:03:43.500]  Australia the same thing, and sure as the sun came up this morning and is going to set
[1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:48.180]  pretty soon this evening, it happened because it's all in the U.N. plans.
[1:03:48.180 --> 1:03:49.820]  It's all in the CDC plans.
[1:03:49.820 --> 1:03:51.900]  We're just a year or so behind them.
[1:03:51.900 --> 1:03:56.980]  So you see them rolling out this winter, the force inoculations and all this.
[1:03:56.980 --> 1:04:00.540]  It'll be here next winter, or they're going to try it.
[1:04:00.540 --> 1:04:04.540]  But because Americans are uppity, Americans think we have basic freedom, they're not getting
[1:04:04.540 --> 1:04:11.500]  away with it except in blue cities that aren't America anymore, or our basic birthrights have
[1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:15.500]  been flushed down and destroyed, and there's footage everywhere in Germany of them physically
[1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:20.380]  attacking anyone that tries to come out at night and not show them their idea during
[1:04:20.380 --> 1:04:21.860]  the day or go to a grocery store.
[1:04:21.860 --> 1:04:27.460]  In fact, show the footage we showed earlier for TV viewers in Germany today, people breaking
[1:04:27.460 --> 1:04:34.540]  through the vaccine checkpoint to be able to go to the Christmas fair, unbelievable,
[1:04:34.540 --> 1:04:40.100]  a world ID, the domestication of humans, tracker systems on phones that leave your house or
[1:04:40.100 --> 1:04:42.540]  be able to even talk to your neighbors or have a job.
[1:04:42.540 --> 1:04:47.900]  If that isn't something worth fighting against, there is nothing that you'd be willing to
[1:04:47.900 --> 1:04:49.300]  fight against.
[1:04:49.300 --> 1:04:53.140]  We got so much more coming up in T-minus 60 Seconds.
[1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:58.140]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:05:53.140 --> 1:06:20.620]  Well, I got the video coming up later in the hour, it's on Infowars.com, Trumpet Marlago
[1:06:20.620 --> 1:06:29.020]  last night called General Millie the puppet anti-American Chinese agent a effing idiot,
[1:06:29.020 --> 1:06:35.500]  and he is an effing evil person, but I wish he'd call the poisoned vaccine effing garbage
[1:06:35.500 --> 1:06:46.100]  and say that he'd been effing conned by effing big pharma, but that has not happened yet,
[1:06:46.100 --> 1:06:51.220]  ladies and gentlemen.
[1:06:51.220 --> 1:06:59.380]  Let's start plowing through the massive news and information right now.
[1:06:59.380 --> 1:07:01.980]  Where should we start?
[1:07:01.980 --> 1:07:12.580]  Maybe this Dr. Robert Malone information, the inventor of MRNA, German data analyst
[1:07:12.580 --> 1:07:16.780]  the German data from the government, the higher the vaccination rate, the higher the excess
[1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:24.060]  mortality, a doubling in those dying who've been vaccinated.
[1:07:24.060 --> 1:07:29.420]  Same thing in the UK, vaccinated English adults under 60 or dying at twice the rate of unvaccinated
[1:07:29.420 --> 1:07:35.780]  people the same age, and then there's the articles and the statistics for listeners
[1:07:35.780 --> 1:07:36.780]  and viewers.
[1:07:36.780 --> 1:07:41.860]  But don't worry, Fauci says they're coming for the babies now in the new year.
[1:07:41.860 --> 1:07:46.900]  Fauci says they're eligible, first you're eligible, now you must take it.
[1:07:46.900 --> 1:07:52.620]  So just remember a little bit of that in the background before I hit the next news, Fauci
[1:07:52.620 --> 1:07:56.980]  forcibly taking children from their parents and testing these concoctions on them till
[1:07:56.980 --> 1:07:57.980]  they die.
[1:07:57.980 --> 1:08:02.580]  Oh, but that's just a footnote too, I mean, he's a family man, Jimmy Kimmel told us, he's
[1:08:02.580 --> 1:08:10.220]  a good guy, he's not the monster, he's not Joseph Mengele, no, it's the people that don't
[1:08:10.220 --> 1:08:13.580]  take the shots, they need to be rounded up, oh wait, your own numbers say you're twice
[1:08:13.580 --> 1:08:19.700]  lucky to die if you take it, you still transmit it, oh, we're going to arrest you.
[1:08:19.700 --> 1:08:24.020]  That's what's happening all over the world, not in America yet, though they're trying
[1:08:24.020 --> 1:08:29.980]  in New York and LA and San Francisco, but we had founders that tried to enshrine liberties
[1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:37.660]  that were already there, but tried to protect them, enshrine them, make them off limits
[1:08:37.660 --> 1:08:41.260]  to tyrants and point out to the public that these are things you should defend and now
[1:08:41.260 --> 1:08:48.900]  that's all going out the window and so is all of our prosperity.
[1:08:48.900 --> 1:08:55.100]  Such an important Gregory's report, dead man.video, go to the left hand corner of band.video and
[1:08:55.100 --> 1:08:59.420]  click that and go to the Gregory's section, you'll see his last report, Fauci's dead babies
[1:08:59.420 --> 1:09:05.220]  and mass graves from the past, did you know there's mass graves that he ran in New York
[1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:09.780]  City, you don't give those little two year olds, five year olds, seven year olds, ten
[1:09:09.780 --> 1:09:13.620]  year olds, thousands of them, you don't give them a marked grave, that humanizes them,
[1:09:13.620 --> 1:09:19.780]  you throw them in a landfill, but it's okay because they tell us all over the news he's
[1:09:19.780 --> 1:09:27.500]  so loving, he's such a good man, we need him when he ran the Wulon lab, so let's start
[1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:29.860]  going through these headlines, okay?
[1:09:29.860 --> 1:09:41.140]  Poll, majority of voters concerned about potential of harmful side effects, that's a big national
[1:09:41.140 --> 1:09:47.580]  poll out, 74% are concerned about it, you can read all that for yourself, wow what extremist
[1:09:47.580 --> 1:09:51.900]  but don't worry, here's the little weirdo in the Captain Kirk outfit, Biden Surgeon
[1:09:51.900 --> 1:09:55.860]  General says triple Vax people should still wear masks this Christmas because they're
[1:09:55.860 --> 1:10:01.620]  not safe and can still transmit, don't worry though a new shot's coming, oh he always promised
[1:10:01.620 --> 1:10:05.300]  this is better than your natural immunity, one shot in your hand, now we're up to the
[1:10:05.300 --> 1:10:11.540]  third or fourth shot, he says he's just worthless, positions claim 300,000 could suffer from
[1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:16.620]  heart conditions caused by post pandemic stress disorder, it's not a real study, it's not
[1:10:16.620 --> 1:10:21.140]  a real disorder, they say there's hundreds of thousands dying in the UK after they get
[1:10:21.140 --> 1:10:26.820]  the shots because they're upset about the lockdown, that's why there's a massive increase,
[1:10:26.820 --> 1:10:30.160]  not in their own literature, it's causing heart attacks, not in their own British government
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:33.740]  documents and FDA documents that came out even before they started injecting the public
[1:10:33.740 --> 1:10:37.660]  because they had done secret studies, no, no, no, no, no, it's like the billboards down
[1:10:37.660 --> 1:10:42.420]  the side of buses, heart attacks in children, that'll be newborn babies is totally normal,
[1:10:42.420 --> 1:10:46.260]  wasn't before all these football players and folks falling down with heart attacks, wasn't
[1:10:46.260 --> 1:10:54.940]  before, now it is, UK surgeon remains suspended a year after saying government are using COVID
[1:10:54.940 --> 1:11:01.180]  to control people, wow, can't say that the grass is green or the sky is blue, that's
[1:11:01.180 --> 1:11:06.940]  all up on infowars.com, Alex Jones declares war on Donald Trump unless he comes out against
[1:11:06.940 --> 1:11:12.700]  the corona injection agenda, go see the video and also, you know, let Rand Paul all of know,
[1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:17.260]  Rand, you're exposing Fauci created the virus, you're exposing that he's a fraud, Fauci
[1:11:17.260 --> 1:11:21.180]  says that the vaccine is way better than natural immunity, when natural immunity is 20 plus
[1:11:21.180 --> 1:11:27.460]  times better, the study actually says 27 times, that's an Israeli study of 6 million people,
[1:11:27.460 --> 1:11:31.500]  one of the best out there, but you still supported it early on, now you need to come
[1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:35.100]  out against the whole thing and admit it's a fraud, because now they admit it doesn't
[1:11:35.100 --> 1:11:40.300]  give you immunity and erase your immune system, Dr. Paul, I know you're not on the enemy's
[1:11:40.300 --> 1:11:46.700]  team, I know you got bamboozled, don't be arrogant, Trump listened to you, Senator Paul,
[1:11:46.700 --> 1:11:52.460]  Dr. Paul, he's one of the main reasons you went with warp speed, admit you were conned,
[1:11:52.460 --> 1:11:58.780]  Rand Paul, your father needs to come out as well, so does Donald Trump and I'm going
[1:11:58.780 --> 1:12:04.180]  to keep hammering this for months and if you don't, you're going to stand trial at Nuremberg
[1:12:04.180 --> 1:12:11.380]  too as well, but I'm not going to sit here and risk my life doing this and not watch
[1:12:11.380 --> 1:12:14.340]  you put your skin in the game, I know they broke your ribs, I know they shot at you,
[1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:18.300]  I know you're good, Rand Paul, I know the past vaccines, most of them were okay, some
[1:12:18.300 --> 1:12:21.420]  were tainted, but you know it's a real science, you thought, hey, give it to people, we'll
[1:12:21.420 --> 1:12:27.500]  save lives, you were conned, but you're not conned now, so yes, we love you calling for
[1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:34.620]  Fauci to spend five years in prison and we love you exposing Wuhan, but go all the way,
[1:12:34.620 --> 1:12:42.180]  go all the way, I mean, I'm facing prison from these people, I'm facing bankruptcy from
[1:12:42.180 --> 1:12:46.460]  them because I know there's no future if I don't fight back, you know that too, so believe
[1:12:46.460 --> 1:12:52.860]  in America, believe in America, have bodyguards of course, they're going to try to kill you,
[1:12:52.860 --> 1:13:03.260]  but believe in America and do the right thing, believe in the world, believe in humanity,
[1:13:03.260 --> 1:13:08.940]  and again, I love Rand Paul, I love Donald Trump, I really like Ted Cruz, I really like
[1:13:08.940 --> 1:13:13.660]  Josh Hawley, I really like Tom Cotton, they all are as smart as I am or smarter, probably
[1:13:13.660 --> 1:13:18.620]  smarter aren't they, yeah, probably, in a lot of ways they are, they know all this,
[1:13:18.620 --> 1:13:25.100]  they knew it the whole time, once the information came out, so they kept it all secret, but
[1:13:25.100 --> 1:13:29.340]  once the shot started, and now the literature, you have to be hiding in a freaking cave to
[1:13:29.340 --> 1:13:34.900]  not know this, and so we're not going to affect Joe Biden, the evil pedophile, globalist,
[1:13:34.900 --> 1:13:38.260]  Chinese agent, we're not going to get him to stop it, we're not going to get Obama,
[1:13:38.260 --> 1:13:43.740]  the evil degenerates, piece of garbage, his llamasist, we're not going to get Andy for
[1:13:43.740 --> 1:13:48.620]  to stop it, they're evil, they want power, they want to overthrow the system, they want
[1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:53.140]  death, they want to make their bones, they're not going to stop, but we can get the governors
[1:13:53.140 --> 1:13:57.380]  and the legislators, and I'll say this, Greg Abbott, get with the program more, you come
[1:13:57.380 --> 1:14:02.260]  out and become a hero and do the right thing, DeSantis, is it trying to make people take
[1:14:02.260 --> 1:14:07.500]  shots, that's not enough, it was a bad product, it was a fraud, it was a lie, now a third
[1:14:07.500 --> 1:14:15.100]  shot, a fourth shot, let me tell DeSantis and Paul and Trump and Matt Gaetz and all
[1:14:15.100 --> 1:14:19.340]  of them something right now, let me get this through your heads, because Glenn Beck even
[1:14:19.340 --> 1:14:22.980]  gets it now, and I'm like, great, Glenn Beck, we love you, this is the real test of are
[1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:26.580]  you evil or are you good, maybe Glenn Beck thought I was nuts years ago because it sounded
[1:14:26.580 --> 1:14:32.060]  extreme, he said that, now he knows I'm right, so you see what's happening, you want to join
[1:14:32.060 --> 1:14:36.860]  Tucker Carlson, Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, all of our ancestors that stood up against evil
[1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:42.220]  that were good, are you from a good family or a bad family, but I want to tell Rand Paul
[1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:47.100]  and all the ones still, someone on the fence, and Paul's doing a lot of great work, okay,
[1:14:47.100 --> 1:14:54.420]  he's picked his battles and I respect him, but the point is you can't know all this
[1:14:54.420 --> 1:14:58.580]  and do all these other good things and they're not attacking the injection itself and say,
[1:14:58.580 --> 1:15:03.660]  okay, we were lied to, it's all a fraud, and Paul, you and Trump and all of you are losing
[1:15:03.660 --> 1:15:08.020]  support with your constituents and they're getting mad at you, I'm not the only one,
[1:15:08.020 --> 1:15:13.460]  so we're trying to help you, we're trying to get you to be the men you really are and
[1:15:13.460 --> 1:15:19.380]  to go all the way, and so if Rand Paul and others come out and really start saying we
[1:15:19.380 --> 1:15:23.380]  were misled about the vaccine, it's not a vaccine, and it's causing major health problems
[1:15:23.380 --> 1:15:27.660]  and throws down the gauntlet, we will turn the tide worldwide, I mean my God, they start
[1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:33.740]  in a month and a half forced injections in Germany and other areas, I mean this is a
[1:15:33.740 --> 1:15:39.580]  worldwide corporate plan, we need America to be a leader against this, so I'm willing
[1:15:39.580 --> 1:15:46.900]  to do whatever it takes to expose these people peacefully and legally and lawfully, and I
[1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:51.380]  really don't want them to fully take over and keep injecting the children and engage
[1:15:51.380 --> 1:15:54.340]  in all this mass murder, I really want to stop this and I know we can, well, they're
[1:15:54.340 --> 1:15:55.340]  right back.
[1:15:55.340 --> 1:15:59.460]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[1:15:59.460 --> 1:16:01.020]  Why do the globalists take you so much?
[1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:04.260]  Why do they hate America so much?
[1:16:04.260 --> 1:16:10.100]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot
[1:16:10.100 --> 1:16:11.100]  go exist with.
[1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:17.380]  It's very, very simple, for their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenics system
[1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:24.940]  to flourish, freedom and liberty and new process and justice and God fearing systems must fail.
[1:16:24.940 --> 1:16:29.820]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates, you didn't start a fight with David
[1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:35.460]  Rockefeller, you didn't start a fight with the UN, they started a fight with you and
[1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:40.100]  they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away and they're not going to ever
[1:16:40.100 --> 1:16:44.580]  stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[1:16:44.580 --> 1:16:48.620]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism
[1:16:48.620 --> 1:16:53.220]  or about corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and that we're under
[1:16:53.220 --> 1:17:00.220]  attack we have any chance of beating these people.
[1:17:54.220 --> 1:17:57.060]  That's InfoLearnings.store.com.

[1:20:00.380 --> 1:20:19.700]  Being a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:19.700 --> 1:20:24.820]  The United Nations told us decades ago they'd use a virus to bring in world government.
[1:20:24.820 --> 1:20:29.420]  You're like, oh, show us, show us your documents.
[1:20:29.420 --> 1:20:30.420]  One lockstep.
[1:20:30.420 --> 1:20:31.420]  Rockefeller Foundation.

[1:20:32.420 --> 1:20:35.420]  We'll give them to you.
[1:20:35.420 --> 1:20:44.420]  We're going to show you FDA documents, thousands dying at just the beginning of the gene therapy
[1:20:44.420 --> 1:20:53.860]  injections that began this year, and now the evil, wicked, sick, big tech corporate combine
[1:20:53.860 --> 1:21:00.260]  is suppressing even mainline science, even the American Heart Association has had their
[1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:06.100]  tweets blocked and have been threatened to be suspended for publishing what is on the
[1:21:06.100 --> 1:21:11.580]  Pfizer and Moderna injections that now it can cause a heart attack or myocarditis.
[1:21:11.580 --> 1:21:14.580]  That's premeditated evil.
[1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:19.380]  That's making sure they can mania, making sure they can kill you as part of their greedy,
[1:21:19.380 --> 1:21:24.140]  hateful business plan.
[1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:25.140]  Where's the FBI?
[1:21:25.140 --> 1:21:26.140]  Nowhere.
[1:21:26.140 --> 1:21:27.140]  They're all bought off at the top.
[1:21:27.140 --> 1:21:32.820]  Who creates the memos that go out to the big six tech companies so they all work in lockstep,
[1:21:32.820 --> 1:21:38.660]  hence the term lockstep, operation lockstep, to suppress this?
[1:21:38.660 --> 1:21:43.100]  This is all a giant depopulation operation because they believe they're saving the earth.
[1:21:43.100 --> 1:21:46.220]  A lot of people have been pre-programmed to think, well, there are too many people.
[1:21:46.220 --> 1:21:48.260]  Oh, did you know you're on the chopping block, too?
[1:21:48.260 --> 1:21:50.100]  Oh, I guess you didn't.
[1:21:50.100 --> 1:21:53.660]  So since you think you should die, go ahead and take as many shots as you want and you
[1:21:53.660 --> 1:21:56.660]  will die pretty quick in a horrible, degenerate fashion.
[1:21:56.660 --> 1:22:00.980]  They'll suck all the money out of you, just don't do it to children, you murderers.
[1:22:00.980 --> 1:22:05.100]  You're into death, you're into Satanism, kill yourself, not us.
[1:22:05.100 --> 1:22:10.620]  Children offered secret ride to vaccine clinic RT reports and it's on the Canadian news.
[1:22:10.620 --> 1:22:14.180]  I reported this six, eight months ago, but it's also happening in San Francisco where
[1:22:14.180 --> 1:22:20.180]  they take children as young as 12 without parental consent and get them injected.
[1:22:20.180 --> 1:22:23.380]  Oregon may actually make its mask mandate permanent.
[1:22:23.380 --> 1:22:29.340]  Here's links to the Oregon government announcing, oh, it's just best to wear mask always outside
[1:22:29.340 --> 1:22:31.300]  just like you wear a seatbelt.
[1:22:31.300 --> 1:22:35.940]  I told you that 21 months ago because I know their plans about 18 months ago that the New
[1:22:35.940 --> 1:22:40.740]  York Times and CNN said, oh, it's just like seatbelt.
[1:22:40.740 --> 1:22:46.180]  Oh, yes, it's a symbol you're dirty, a symbol you're bad, a symbol that you are horrible
[1:22:46.180 --> 1:22:48.980]  and it gives you bacterial pneumonia.
[1:22:48.980 --> 1:22:49.980]  It doesn't protect you.
[1:22:49.980 --> 1:22:54.620]  It's just the symbol of the cult, the permanent cult.
[1:22:54.620 --> 1:23:01.140]  Biden has spotted masclists at DC restaurant up to saying he caught a cold from his grandson
[1:23:01.140 --> 1:23:02.140]  Bo Jr.
[1:23:02.140 --> 1:23:06.900]  What were you doing kissing them like you do the rest of your children?
[1:23:06.900 --> 1:23:07.900]  You know what I mean?
[1:23:07.900 --> 1:23:10.580]  I don't mean you want to kiss them normal.
[1:23:10.580 --> 1:23:15.340]  Even more key Democrats are getting caught up in engaging in mask hypocrisy.
[1:23:15.340 --> 1:23:19.060]  Pelosi, two more times last week, well, she's a royal emperor.
[1:23:19.060 --> 1:23:20.980]  She doesn't wear a mask.
[1:23:20.980 --> 1:23:26.700]  UFC legend Conor McGregor calls for Ireland to leave the EU over COVID restrictions as
[1:23:26.700 --> 1:23:30.780]  it's a police state, not a free country anymore.
[1:23:30.780 --> 1:23:36.860]  Provaxxers triggered after country music legend reveals he won't get the Vax joins Eric Clapton
[1:23:36.860 --> 1:23:42.540]  and many others saying I won't play any venue that makes everybody have the vaccine.
[1:23:42.540 --> 1:23:52.220]  That's Dale Watson, Berlin wall of COVID supermarkets in Austria fence off Vax from Unvaxxed tell
[1:23:52.220 --> 1:23:55.660]  everyone they're not allowed to go anywhere but the grocery store if they're Unvaxxed
[1:23:55.660 --> 1:23:56.660]  and then still there.
[1:23:56.660 --> 1:23:58.260]  They're checked and harassed.
[1:23:58.260 --> 1:23:59.260]  Total crap.
[1:23:59.260 --> 1:24:02.940]  Meanwhile, the numbers are exploding in all the supervaxxed areas.
[1:24:02.940 --> 1:24:07.620]  Some islands like Gibraltar are 100% highest rates in the world.
[1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:10.300]  Highest rate states of Vermont and in Maine.
[1:24:10.300 --> 1:24:14.300]  Highest rates of vaccinations have the highest rates of sickness, illness, hospitalization
[1:24:14.300 --> 1:24:16.140]  because what do the scientists say?
[1:24:16.140 --> 1:24:21.460]  The vaccine creates the spike protein that the virus itself creates.
[1:24:21.460 --> 1:24:25.100]  Oh, and I'll show you some studies from the FDA in a moment.
[1:24:25.100 --> 1:24:29.060]  South African official COVID cases and children are mild.
[1:24:29.060 --> 1:24:32.500]  People should be less fearful, but they aren't.
[1:24:32.500 --> 1:24:36.740]  They love to get scared and it goes on from there.
[1:24:36.740 --> 1:24:41.940]  Remember that German doctor famously that was on a Facebook live feed with tens of thousands
[1:24:41.940 --> 1:24:48.420]  of people watching medical doctor, Dr. Andreas Nowak with he and his wife.
[1:24:48.420 --> 1:24:53.820]  They swat teaming for being online speaking out because in Australia and Austria and Germany
[1:24:53.820 --> 1:24:55.700]  and Spain are not allowed to criticize.
[1:24:55.700 --> 1:24:59.300]  England's trying to pass the law right now or tell the truth about the deadly injections
[1:24:59.300 --> 1:25:01.140]  because you're such a free country.
[1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:02.220]  Well, he got beaten up.
[1:25:02.220 --> 1:25:07.580]  It sounds like they said men in black, anti-fair police beat him to death two days ago.
[1:25:07.580 --> 1:25:09.820]  Full information on info wars.com.
[1:25:09.820 --> 1:25:18.420]  German doctor murdered hours after exposing graphene hydroxide in vaccines and it's graphene
[1:25:18.420 --> 1:25:21.980]  oxide.

[1:25:27.220 --> 1:25:29.700]  to other destinations in the United States.
[1:25:29.700 --> 1:25:32.660]  A really important John Bowne report.
[1:25:32.660 --> 1:25:36.860]  Talbotarians mandate tyranny worldwide to be aired at the start of the show at the start
[1:25:36.860 --> 1:25:40.180]  of Sunday live in 35 minutes.
[1:25:40.180 --> 1:25:41.780]  It's going to air again.
[1:25:41.780 --> 1:25:43.180]  I suggest you all grab it.
[1:25:43.180 --> 1:25:45.540]  I suggest you all share it.
[1:25:45.540 --> 1:25:49.500]  The most powerful four minute 55 second boil down.
[1:25:49.500 --> 1:25:50.980]  You're going to see anywhere.
[1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:53.700]  It's also at manda video.
[1:25:53.700 --> 1:25:54.700]  Thank you.
[1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:55.700]  Dr. Joe Rogan.
[1:25:55.700 --> 1:25:57.100]  UFC's Dana White credits Joe Rogan.
[1:25:57.100 --> 1:26:01.620]  I remectant for rapid COVID recovery.
[1:26:01.620 --> 1:26:06.580]  South Korea sees record high COVID-19 cases deaths despite country's high vaccination
[1:26:06.580 --> 1:26:09.780]  rate.
[1:26:09.780 --> 1:26:15.380]  Omicron variant shares genetic code with common cold researchers say Omicron more transmissible
[1:26:15.380 --> 1:26:20.340]  less severe due to common cold mutation, but they don't care.
[1:26:20.340 --> 1:26:24.100]  Spanish investigation finds vaccine passports have no impact on infection rates.
[1:26:24.100 --> 1:26:26.420]  Of course, it's all the track and control you.
[1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:30.860]  Good outbreak on U.S. cruise ship despite fully vacs passengers and they're having super
[1:26:30.860 --> 1:26:32.180]  sickness on board.
[1:26:32.180 --> 1:26:35.060]  Isn't that interesting?
[1:26:35.060 --> 1:26:39.420]  Watch Paris police check proof of vaccination while diners eat.
[1:26:39.420 --> 1:26:40.420]  Same thing in Germany.
[1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:41.420]  Same thing in Australia.
[1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:42.420]  Coming here.
[1:26:42.420 --> 1:26:43.420]  Unified.
[1:26:43.420 --> 1:26:44.420]  Global.
[1:26:44.420 --> 1:26:45.420]  Corporate plan.
[1:26:45.420 --> 1:26:48.780]  These leaders aren't French leaders or German leaders or Spanish leaders or Mexican leaders
[1:26:48.780 --> 1:26:49.780]  when they do this.
[1:26:49.780 --> 1:26:50.780]  They're globalist leaders.
[1:26:50.780 --> 1:26:54.580]  But the Mexican president has said it's a power grab and dangerous in the vaccine
[1:26:54.580 --> 1:26:58.740]  attacks your immune system.
[1:26:58.740 --> 1:27:02.660]  And guess who else has come out and said you shouldn't be made to take a forced inoculation
[1:27:02.660 --> 1:27:05.140]  to buy or sell or live.
[1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:06.140]  Guess who else?
[1:27:06.140 --> 1:27:11.220]  Here's the South African president refuses vaccine mandate and vaccine passports.
[1:27:11.220 --> 1:27:18.620]  This is Cyril Ramaphosa.
[1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:19.980]  This vaccine.
[1:27:19.980 --> 1:27:27.900]  I want to repeat, nobody will be forced to take this vaccine.
[1:27:27.900 --> 1:27:35.140]  Nobody will be forbidden from traveling to wherever they want to travel to.
[1:27:35.140 --> 1:27:42.420]  Including from enrolling at school or from taking part in any public activity if they
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:46.780]  have not been vaccinated.
[1:27:46.780 --> 1:27:49.740]  By the way, I'm not saying that president's perfect, but he's the one that arrested some
[1:27:49.740 --> 1:27:52.380]  of the communists that wanted to overthrow and kill all the white people.
[1:27:52.380 --> 1:27:57.420]  So he obviously doesn't want to inject everybody there and basically give them a little bio
[1:27:57.420 --> 1:27:58.580]  weapon disease.
[1:27:58.580 --> 1:28:02.980]  So good for him over there in South Africa.
[1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:07.100]  Hopefully he comes out all the way against the New World Order.
[1:28:07.100 --> 1:28:08.180]  Okay.
[1:28:08.180 --> 1:28:14.340]  I have not gotten into the documents yet, but we will when we return.
[1:28:14.340 --> 1:28:20.140]  The big documents that we covered on Tuesday that now on all the major big tech platforms
[1:28:20.140 --> 1:28:26.540]  from Reddit, to Instagram, to Facebook, to YouTube, to Google, to Twitter, everywhere,
[1:28:26.540 --> 1:28:28.860]  they are blocking it.
[1:28:28.860 --> 1:28:29.860]  They don't want you to know.
[1:28:29.860 --> 1:28:34.820]  Remember, the FDA was like, we do not want to give the public these documents on the
[1:28:34.820 --> 1:28:37.300]  injections on the Pfizer shot.
[1:28:37.300 --> 1:28:40.580]  And the federal judge said, well, you're going to release 500 pages a month of the hundreds
[1:28:40.580 --> 1:28:42.380]  of thousands of pages.
[1:28:42.380 --> 1:28:46.580]  And the first group came out in big techs like doing their job to make sure consumers
[1:28:46.580 --> 1:28:50.660]  can't find out they're being killed and to make sure we get hurt as bad as possible.
[1:28:50.660 --> 1:28:53.300]  They are terrorists helping kill everybody.
[1:28:53.300 --> 1:28:55.300]  They are murderers.
[1:28:55.300 --> 1:29:02.620]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[1:29:02.620 --> 1:29:06.820]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group.
[1:29:06.820 --> 1:29:07.820]  So he didn't stand up.
[1:29:07.820 --> 1:29:10.340]  And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group.
[1:29:10.340 --> 1:29:12.180]  So he didn't stand up.
[1:29:12.180 --> 1:29:15.580]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[1:29:15.580 --> 1:29:18.900]  Well, the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in that's banning people
[1:29:18.900 --> 1:29:22.620]  to three hours of video games a week, and if you criticize the government, you can never
[1:29:22.620 --> 1:29:23.940]  buy or sell again.
[1:29:23.940 --> 1:29:29.660]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world, the guys with COVID vaccine passports,
[1:29:29.660 --> 1:29:30.660]  they even admit it.
[1:29:30.660 --> 1:29:33.260]  Now, there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[1:29:33.260 --> 1:29:36.700]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what
[1:29:36.700 --> 1:29:37.700]  you can do.
[1:29:37.700 --> 1:29:39.500]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:40.500]  You'll accept that.
[1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:42.100]  You'll accept anything.
[1:29:42.100 --> 1:29:46.260]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[1:29:46.260 --> 1:29:49.220]  like they're part of the power structure, but they're all going to be targeted by this
[1:29:49.220 --> 1:29:50.220]  nightmare as well.
[1:29:50.220 --> 1:29:54.340]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them, or all of us will be enslaved
[1:29:54.340 --> 1:29:57.420]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[1:29:57.420 --> 1:30:00.220]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[1:30:00.220 --> 1:30:05.420]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[1:30:05.420 --> 1:30:09.340]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[1:30:09.340 --> 1:30:15.820]  and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:30:15.820 --> 1:30:20.820]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take,
[1:30:20.820 --> 1:30:24.380]  quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:30:24.380 --> 1:30:26.180]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:30:26.180 --> 1:30:30.420]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many
[1:30:30.420 --> 1:30:34.700]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[1:30:34.700 --> 1:30:37.300]  grade at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:37.300 --> 1:30:42.580]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[1:30:42.580 --> 1:30:47.700]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[1:30:47.700 --> 1:30:50.260]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[1:30:50.260 --> 1:30:52.820]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:52.820 --> 1:30:58.340]  So protect your privacy today and support the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:58.340 --> 1:31:03.860]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[1:31:03.860 --> 1:31:09.540]  Most the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[1:31:09.540 --> 1:31:13.780]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:31:13.780 --> 1:31:18.900]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[1:31:18.900 --> 1:31:23.740]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[1:31:23.740 --> 1:31:28.180]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[1:31:28.180 --> 1:31:30.540]  unbelievably unsettling to see.
[1:31:30.540 --> 1:31:33.060]  But there is only two things to do.
[1:31:33.060 --> 1:31:36.180]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:31:36.180 --> 1:31:39.540]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:31:39.540 --> 1:31:44.180]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[1:31:44.180 --> 1:31:45.180]  an end.
[1:31:45.180 --> 1:31:50.580]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration,
[1:31:50.580 --> 1:31:58.180]  survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:58.180 --> 1:31:59.540]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:31:59.540 --> 1:32:01.380]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:02.380]  Welcome.
[1:32:02.380 --> 1:32:03.380]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:32:03.380 --> 1:32:04.380]  All right.
[1:32:04.380 --> 1:32:07.540]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[1:32:07.540 --> 1:32:12.460]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMell
[1:32:12.460 --> 1:32:15.020]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[1:32:15.020 --> 1:32:17.860]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[1:32:17.860 --> 1:32:19.780]  SuperMell Vitality really, really works.
[1:32:19.780 --> 1:32:24.700]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:32:24.700 --> 1:32:30.260]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[1:32:30.260 --> 1:32:31.260]  but just aren't as strong.
[1:32:31.260 --> 1:32:33.300]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:32:33.300 --> 1:32:35.700]  In fact, each batch is different.
[1:32:35.700 --> 1:32:37.700]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[1:32:37.700 --> 1:32:41.180]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:32:41.180 --> 1:32:42.180]  That's just how it is.
[1:32:42.180 --> 1:32:43.180]  It's how it works.
[1:32:43.180 --> 1:32:45.340]  So it's always good.
[1:32:45.340 --> 1:32:47.500]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:32:47.500 --> 1:32:59.100]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:32:59.100 --> 1:33:09.060]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:09.060 --> 1:33:16.340]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.340 --> 1:33:25.060]  So the entire global corporate system is working around the clock to suppress this broadcast.
[1:33:25.060 --> 1:33:30.620]  And they flipped out three and a half years ago and just went crazy.
[1:33:30.620 --> 1:33:35.100]  And then we're hyperventilating on national TV saying he's got to be taken off air.
[1:33:35.100 --> 1:33:36.100]  He's too dangerous.
[1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:37.100]  Oh my God.
[1:33:37.100 --> 1:33:41.060]  They had emergency meetings with all the big tech heads they admitted they had.
[1:33:41.060 --> 1:33:44.100]  And I went and noticed what it was I said when they did that.
[1:33:44.100 --> 1:33:46.340]  And it was you're not going to go out to the ballpark anymore.
[1:33:46.340 --> 1:33:49.900]  They're going to make you wear a mask or to forcibly inject you.
[1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:50.900]  It's operation lockstep.
[1:33:50.900 --> 1:33:54.060]  They're going to use a virus to bring in worldwide viewing control.
[1:33:54.060 --> 1:33:57.980]  And they by then were paying attention when I was saying it 10 years ago, 20 years ago.
[1:33:57.980 --> 1:33:59.980]  They're like, oh, that's just some crazy guy.
[1:33:59.980 --> 1:34:02.300]  They won't listen to him.
[1:34:02.300 --> 1:34:04.140]  But by then we helped get Trump elected.
[1:34:04.140 --> 1:34:07.180]  They were like, you got to shut him up.
[1:34:07.180 --> 1:34:09.820]  But see now they got to shut you up.
[1:34:09.820 --> 1:34:14.700]  They got to shut everybody up and not just online, but in the third dimension on the
[1:34:14.700 --> 1:34:15.700]  ground.
[1:34:15.700 --> 1:34:18.540]  They're trying.
[1:34:18.540 --> 1:34:22.820]  I mean in Germany in places, they're going to people's houses and killing them.
[1:34:22.820 --> 1:34:27.780]  A lot of activists have been killed in Canada and Trudeau says he wants to be a dictator
[1:34:27.780 --> 1:34:28.780]  like China.
[1:34:28.780 --> 1:34:30.540]  When somebody says I want to be a dictator like G.G.
[1:34:30.540 --> 1:34:31.540]  Ping.
[1:34:31.540 --> 1:34:32.540]  G.G.
[1:34:32.540 --> 1:34:38.020]  Ping killed tens of millions of his own people, conservatively 60 plus million.
[1:34:38.020 --> 1:34:39.980]  The CIA says 60 something million.
[1:34:39.980 --> 1:34:43.300]  The Chinese say he killed 80 something million.
[1:34:43.300 --> 1:34:45.060]  But let's just go with a low number.
[1:34:45.060 --> 1:34:51.020]  So it's more manageable here, 60 plus million.
[1:34:51.020 --> 1:34:55.300]  So and people can't ever believe when this happens to them.
[1:34:55.300 --> 1:34:57.780]  They just can't believe it's happening.
[1:34:57.780 --> 1:35:02.380]  People ask why persecuted groups in Germany, when Hitler got in power in 33 and slowly
[1:35:02.380 --> 1:35:05.180]  turned up the heat for seven years, why they stayed there?
[1:35:05.180 --> 1:35:09.340]  Because it's done incrementally, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:35:09.340 --> 1:35:11.420]  I'm trying to save the country as fast as I can.
[1:35:11.420 --> 1:35:12.420]  But this is a global thing.
[1:35:12.420 --> 1:35:16.300]  If there was some free country that run by a patriot I could run to, I'd do it.
[1:35:16.300 --> 1:35:19.020]  But Bolsonaro's hanging on by his fingernails.
[1:35:19.020 --> 1:35:21.740]  But if he could fix Brazil, I'd move down there.
[1:35:21.740 --> 1:35:24.860]  I mean, I love America, but I'm ready to give up on it, folks.
[1:35:24.860 --> 1:35:26.740]  If there was an alternative, there's not.
[1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:29.100]  So everybody always bashes America all day.
[1:35:29.100 --> 1:35:35.260]  We are still of the entire major countries in the world, the freest, most open society
[1:35:35.260 --> 1:35:40.140]  in the world and have the least COVID restrictions because it's not how our background has been
[1:35:40.140 --> 1:35:41.140]  set up.
[1:35:41.140 --> 1:35:43.220]  It's not what our bill of rights and constitution says.
[1:35:43.220 --> 1:35:48.300]  So you better believe that we're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[1:35:48.300 --> 1:35:50.100]  That's why I love this republic, man.
[1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:51.100]  You think it's bad?
[1:35:51.100 --> 1:35:52.100]  You hadn't seen anything.
[1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:53.100]  What's going on?
[1:35:53.100 --> 1:35:57.580]  I mean, in Latin America, most of those countries have been under lockdown for 20 months.
[1:35:57.580 --> 1:36:03.660]  Australia's been a lockdown for over 20 months.
[1:36:03.660 --> 1:36:06.300]  Germany over 20 months.
[1:36:06.300 --> 1:36:09.740]  They were approaching the 600 day mark a few weeks ago.
[1:36:09.740 --> 1:36:12.460]  Guys, look up how many days Germany's under lockdown.
[1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:16.100]  I think it's gone past 600 days.
[1:36:16.100 --> 1:36:17.100]  And I got the articles.
[1:36:17.100 --> 1:36:27.220]  Oh, by the way, it's COVID forever, Bloomberg headline, oh, massacre forever, AP.
[1:36:27.220 --> 1:36:28.220]  And then there's this.
[1:36:28.220 --> 1:36:29.220]  Here it is out of Fox News.
[1:36:29.220 --> 1:36:31.940]  There's finally no last few days since it broke on Monday.
[1:36:31.940 --> 1:36:34.460]  I've learned about it Tuesday.
[1:36:34.460 --> 1:36:36.780]  Got some attention, but where did it break?
[1:36:36.780 --> 1:36:44.220]  The FDA got ordered by a federal judge last week, seven, eight, nine days ago, Friday
[1:36:44.220 --> 1:36:51.660]  before last, eight, nine days ago, got ordered to release these documents.
[1:36:51.660 --> 1:36:54.100]  Remember the headlines in Reuters everywhere?
[1:36:54.100 --> 1:37:01.020]  Oh, FDA wants 55 years to release any Pfizer or Moderna documents, but these were Pfizer,
[1:37:01.020 --> 1:37:03.620]  this particular suit.
[1:37:03.620 --> 1:37:09.900]  And even Reuters said, what, oh, what, yeah, wow, it's so wonderful, works so well.
[1:37:09.900 --> 1:37:12.220]  Why not?
[1:37:12.220 --> 1:37:17.220]  I went and looked today because I heard about it and the crew went and looked and we found
[1:37:17.220 --> 1:37:18.220]  it.
[1:37:18.220 --> 1:37:19.220]  We're going to show it all to you here.
[1:37:19.220 --> 1:37:24.300]  You know what they did to the prominent Twitter accounts?
[1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:30.020]  That link to this, they banned them.
[1:37:30.020 --> 1:37:33.460]  And now they're saying they're going to ban the American Medical Association if they say
[1:37:33.460 --> 1:37:34.460]  anything.
[1:37:34.460 --> 1:37:37.740]  And they have already threatened to ban and already restricted and already banned some
[1:37:37.740 --> 1:37:41.020]  of the links put out by the American Heart Association.
[1:37:41.020 --> 1:37:46.100]  They already restrict Senator Paul when he talks about the Israeli study, 27 times better
[1:37:46.100 --> 1:37:49.180]  natural immunity in these shots.
[1:37:49.180 --> 1:37:54.420]  See, that's not martial law coming.
[1:37:54.420 --> 1:37:56.940]  Martial law is here.
[1:37:56.940 --> 1:38:01.060]  Old Johnny Cash said, I hear the train are coming.
[1:38:01.060 --> 1:38:08.540]  It's rolling around the bend and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck
[1:38:08.540 --> 1:38:13.420]  in Folsom prison and Tom keeps dragging on.
[1:38:13.420 --> 1:38:18.100]  Well, you're going into the globalist prison and the train isn't coming.
[1:38:18.100 --> 1:38:22.340]  The train just ran over us.
[1:38:22.340 --> 1:38:27.620]  So Representative Norman demands FDA release COVID vaccine data in 100 days, says no, you're
[1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:32.980]  not going to release 500 pages a month, which the way the judge did it, still times out
[1:38:32.980 --> 1:38:35.100]  over 50 years.
[1:38:35.100 --> 1:38:40.060]  Meanwhile, we hear about two parents that might have let their teenager get a gun.
[1:38:40.060 --> 1:38:41.060]  They're on every channel.
[1:38:41.060 --> 1:38:47.820]  Oh, look, forget the guy that ran over all the people and killed a bunch in Waukesha.
[1:38:47.820 --> 1:38:48.820]  He's black.
[1:38:48.820 --> 1:38:50.740]  But look, the white parents are guilty.
[1:38:50.740 --> 1:38:53.740]  Look, white people are killing everyone, white people, white people.
[1:38:53.740 --> 1:38:58.460]  Meanwhile, the real globalists that I guess are mainly white people with some chai comms
[1:38:58.460 --> 1:39:04.100]  mixed in, they are running around depopulating people, killing people in front of you and
[1:39:04.100 --> 1:39:05.100]  we can't even get it covered.
[1:39:05.100 --> 1:39:08.980]  If you try to talk about it, you get banned.
[1:39:08.980 --> 1:39:13.780]  Representative Norman demands FDA release COVID vaccine data in 100 days.
[1:39:13.780 --> 1:39:17.900]  Oh, they don't personalize and humanize on all these channels, all the people damaged
[1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:19.380]  by these so-called vaccines.
[1:39:19.380 --> 1:39:20.380]  No, no, no.
[1:39:20.380 --> 1:39:21.620]  Here's another one.
[1:39:21.620 --> 1:39:28.380]  Court orders FDA to comply with FOIA and release information on Pfizer EUA.
[1:39:28.380 --> 1:39:34.940]  First batch of document shows 1,200 plus vaccine deaths in just the first 90 days.
[1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:36.380]  It's a lot worse than that.
[1:39:36.380 --> 1:39:40.700]  They filtered out most of the deaths.
[1:39:40.700 --> 1:39:46.220]  Pfizer COVID jab killed more than 100, 1,200 people within 90 days.
[1:39:46.220 --> 1:39:56.900]  Now, here's the popular Israeli researcher that put it out, Gal Shalev.
[1:39:56.900 --> 1:40:01.700]  But Gal Shalev went viral pointing out the FDA documents and simply pointed out some
[1:40:01.700 --> 1:40:02.820]  pages that were accurate.
[1:40:02.820 --> 1:40:06.900]  They've been banned on Twitter for daring to show the public an FDA document.
[1:40:06.900 --> 1:40:10.780]  That's Twitter aiding and abetting mass murder, but it's okay because a guy with brown skin
[1:40:10.780 --> 1:40:16.020]  runs it, so he's allowed to be involved in all the mass murder.
[1:40:16.020 --> 1:40:20.060]  Here's Gal Shalev.
[1:40:20.060 --> 1:40:24.940]  Gal Shalev was permanently suspended from Twitter today when his tweet blew up virally after
[1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:28.820]  sharing Pfizer docs handed it to FDA.
[1:40:28.820 --> 1:40:30.780]  Well, that's the message.
[1:40:30.780 --> 1:40:33.820]  You better just get on board with killing everybody or you'll be banned.
[1:40:33.820 --> 1:40:38.340]  Let's get Gal Shalev on the show, ASAP, please.
[1:40:38.340 --> 1:40:39.700]  That's a priority, okay?
[1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:43.060]  Because those that get censored, we need to magnify.
[1:40:43.060 --> 1:40:45.380]  How dare I not want to stay permanently locked down in Israel?
[1:40:45.380 --> 1:40:48.740]  Oh, but look, we have his tweet saved.
[1:40:48.740 --> 1:40:50.220]  We have the tweet saved.
[1:40:50.220 --> 1:40:54.780]  Let's read what they don't want us to see from Gal Shalev.
[1:40:54.780 --> 1:40:57.140]  Number one bombshell.
[1:40:57.140 --> 1:41:00.460]  As ordered by the courts, the FDA must release the data.
[1:41:00.460 --> 1:41:03.420]  It's based to EUA for the Pfizer shot.
[1:41:03.420 --> 1:41:08.660]  The FDA release the documents.
[1:41:08.660 --> 1:41:10.460]  The courts to keep the information confidential.
[1:41:10.460 --> 1:41:12.460]  Let me start over.
[1:41:12.460 --> 1:41:14.540]  I try to hurry up, then I run over this stuff too fast.
[1:41:14.540 --> 1:41:15.540]  Number one bombshell.
[1:41:15.540 --> 1:41:23.260]  As ordered by the courts, the FDA must release the date it based its EUA for the Pfizer shot.
[1:41:23.260 --> 1:41:29.540]  The FDA requested the courts to keep the information confidential for no more or less for 55 years.
[1:41:29.540 --> 1:41:34.980]  The court returned with an order to release 500 documents a month.
[1:41:34.980 --> 1:41:40.980]  Number two, we start with the first release of 30 pages of adverse events, including death.
[1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:45.100]  How this product wasn't taken off the shelf within the first months is beyond me.
[1:41:45.100 --> 1:41:47.620]  Not allowed to say that, son, you're banned.
[1:41:47.620 --> 1:41:51.340]  1,227 deaths by February reported.
[1:41:51.340 --> 1:41:55.500]  These are Pfizer and FDA documents.
[1:41:55.500 --> 1:41:56.500]  Here come the Twitter police.
[1:41:56.500 --> 1:42:03.260]  Number three, looking at the amount of adverse events recorded for the 42,000 is jaw dropping.
[1:42:03.260 --> 1:42:08.580]  What's worse, out of the recorded AEs, about 137 is death.
[1:42:08.580 --> 1:42:11.580]  This is insane.
[1:42:11.580 --> 1:42:16.580]  And that's not 137, that's 1.37 out of the 42,000s of thousands.
[1:42:16.580 --> 1:42:24.740]  The FDA admits these are O-N-K-E recorded AEs that are considered above mild.
[1:42:24.740 --> 1:42:28.020]  There was so much more that wasn't released.
[1:42:28.020 --> 1:42:32.500]  Number four, please keep in mind these are adverse events recorded in the first three
[1:42:32.500 --> 1:42:37.820]  months alone from December 1st of February 28th by all means.
[1:42:37.820 --> 1:42:43.820]  And confirmed by Pfizer, these are only recorded AEs, adverse events, and therefore it might
[1:42:43.820 --> 1:42:47.060]  be a small sample of the true number.
[1:42:47.060 --> 1:42:52.340]  Number five, it goes on to talk about spontaneous abortions, miscarriages, deaths.
[1:42:52.340 --> 1:42:56.860]  All of it, read it for yourself.
[1:42:56.860 --> 1:43:03.460]  Our 2021 Cyber Week specials end on Monday, December 6th.

[1:43:45.180 --> 1:43:46.180]  collective liberties together.
[1:43:46.180 --> 1:43:49.780]  If you shop at the big box stores, you deserve to be a slave.
[1:43:49.780 --> 1:43:53.380]  If you shop at InfoWars, you're part of the team fighting for liberty.
[1:43:53.380 --> 1:43:56.260]  God bless and thanks for your support.
[1:43:56.260 --> 1:44:02.300]  God created each and every one of us with free will, but we look at the world system
[1:44:02.300 --> 1:44:05.700]  now openly announcing the mark of the beast.
[1:44:05.700 --> 1:44:10.980]  Everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making
[1:44:10.980 --> 1:44:17.220]  us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics,
[1:44:17.220 --> 1:44:21.420]  our very future over to them.
[1:44:21.420 --> 1:44:23.180]  They want control of procreation.
[1:44:23.180 --> 1:44:26.140]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[1:44:26.140 --> 1:44:31.940]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:44:31.940 --> 1:44:36.900]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind, in God's image, and given free will.
[1:44:36.900 --> 1:44:42.180]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special
[1:44:42.180 --> 1:44:48.020]  time so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[1:44:48.020 --> 1:44:55.500]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:44:55.500 --> 1:45:00.340]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[1:45:00.340 --> 1:45:02.700]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:45:02.700 --> 1:45:07.220]  I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:11.820]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[1:45:11.820 --> 1:45:15.140]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2, you had, you know, with a deep burden
[1:45:15.140 --> 1:45:17.820]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[1:45:17.820 --> 1:45:24.180]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened,
[1:45:24.180 --> 1:45:25.180]  you know.
[1:45:25.180 --> 1:45:26.180]  I could think again.
[1:45:26.180 --> 1:45:27.180]  I could connect with people again.
[1:45:27.180 --> 1:45:31.860]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[1:45:31.860 --> 1:45:33.980]  took basically all of your supplements.
[1:45:33.980 --> 1:45:35.860]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:45:35.860 --> 1:45:40.300]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[1:45:40.300 --> 1:45:41.300]  It's amazing.
[1:45:41.300 --> 1:45:42.300]  It works.
[1:45:42.300 --> 1:45:45.460]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[1:45:45.460 --> 1:45:46.460]  the globalist system.
[1:45:46.460 --> 1:45:50.260]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:45:50.260 --> 1:45:51.380]  Beautifully said, brother.
[1:45:51.380 --> 1:45:58.380]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:28.380]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[1:46:51.380 --> 1:46:58.380]  Thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[1:47:21.380 --> 1:47:28.140]  I'm stuck in COVID prison and time keeps dragging on.
[1:47:28.140 --> 1:47:32.980]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:47:32.980 --> 1:47:36.900]  On down to sad.
[1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:39.740]  I was just a baby.
[1:47:39.740 --> 1:47:42.660]  Stop right there.
[1:47:42.660 --> 1:47:47.460]  So getting serious here, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to show you the actual FDA documents.
[1:47:47.460 --> 1:47:48.460]  You can see it.
[1:47:48.460 --> 1:47:53.140]  This is just the first 30 pages they released, I guess tomorrow they'll release a little
[1:47:53.140 --> 1:48:00.300]  more and it just says everything that we just broke down there on massive miscarriages,
[1:48:00.300 --> 1:48:07.620]  massive deaths, massive heart attacks, massive strokes, all of that right there that the
[1:48:07.620 --> 1:48:11.060]  system is trying to suppress and Congress is saying, hey, release it all.
[1:48:11.060 --> 1:48:14.700]  Yeah, that's what Rand Paul needs to do, but he hasn't gotten to saying the vaccines
[1:48:14.700 --> 1:48:15.700]  of fraud.
[1:48:15.700 --> 1:48:19.820]  Oh, you're learned immunity is better and they censor him for that.
[1:48:19.820 --> 1:48:21.580]  No, no, Paul, you were conned.
[1:48:21.580 --> 1:48:22.580]  This isn't a vaccine.
[1:48:22.580 --> 1:48:23.580]  It's deadly.
[1:48:23.580 --> 1:48:24.580]  You were wrong.
[1:48:24.580 --> 1:48:30.620]  You were wrong.
[1:48:30.620 --> 1:48:34.060]  Let's continue.
[1:48:34.060 --> 1:48:39.100]  In secret vaccine contracts with governments, Pfizer took hard line and it actually admits
[1:48:39.100 --> 1:48:42.740]  even in Yahoo News that Pfizer has secret agreements with the US government that Trump
[1:48:42.740 --> 1:48:47.700]  signed where they run the media and run responses and are giving liability protection.
[1:48:47.700 --> 1:48:49.740]  It's the same thing all over the world.
[1:48:49.740 --> 1:48:53.860]  Here's the Washington Post in secret vaccine contracts with governments, Pfizer took hard
[1:48:53.860 --> 1:48:59.700]  line to push for profit, not profit, it's control.
[1:48:59.700 --> 1:49:02.660]  Pfizer has the power to silence governments and maximize profits.
[1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:08.340]  Consumer Group alleges, alleges, Pfizer's alarming power to silence governments.
[1:49:08.340 --> 1:49:14.140]  I mean, they're silencing the American Heart Association, can't come out and tell you what
[1:49:14.140 --> 1:49:16.020]  the damn insert says.
[1:49:16.020 --> 1:49:17.020]  And what do they tell them?
[1:49:17.020 --> 1:49:26.300]  You're not allowed to talk, only Fauci or the WHO.
[1:49:26.300 --> 1:49:30.540]  So let me show you this next little tidbit.
[1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:34.580]  And as I mentioned, it's a short three and a half minute report by Gregory's on Band-Aught
[1:49:34.580 --> 1:49:36.700]  video that everybody should share and get out there.
[1:49:36.700 --> 1:49:40.300]  I know the audience is highly awake here, but we need to reach people that aren't awake.
[1:49:40.300 --> 1:49:41.500]  That's the key to all this.
[1:49:41.500 --> 1:49:50.220]  That's the whole point, exclusive, forgotten monument to dead orphans from Fauci's torturous
[1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:55.620]  and deadly AIDS testing is located in New York State, heartbreaking photos of the thousands
[1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:59.060]  of children they killed and the mass grave.
[1:49:59.060 --> 1:50:02.980]  So everybody freaks out about keeping dogs, beagles alive and flesh eating, you know,
[1:50:02.980 --> 1:50:05.060]  bugs, because Fauci likes that.
[1:50:05.060 --> 1:50:09.980]  But what about the children and their own illegal experiments on healthy children killing
[1:50:09.980 --> 1:50:13.100]  them?
[1:50:13.100 --> 1:50:16.700]  That used to be in the mainstream news, but they won't touch it now because they're totally
[1:50:16.700 --> 1:50:18.460]  bought and paid for.
[1:50:18.460 --> 1:50:24.180]  Big pharma bought up and took control of big media and big tech and now are unified against
[1:50:24.180 --> 1:50:25.180]  this killing us.
[1:50:25.180 --> 1:50:28.620]  They don't just want the money, they want the power.
[1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:35.700]  But tested AIDS drugs on foster children, NBC News, including lethal ones, 2005, Fauci
[1:50:35.700 --> 1:50:40.380]  ran it, showing people these NBC headlines.
[1:50:40.380 --> 1:50:42.580]  Look at that.
[1:50:42.580 --> 1:50:47.900]  Now you understand how they operate in the revolving door.
[1:50:47.900 --> 1:50:55.100]  Not only did Fauci's NIAID harm dogs, foster children also died during HIV research.
[1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:59.900]  NIH tested AIDS drugs on foster children, including totally healthy ones.
[1:50:59.900 --> 1:51:00.900]  They would try to escape.
[1:51:00.900 --> 1:51:03.580]  They would chain them down until they died.
[1:51:03.580 --> 1:51:09.940]  Oh, but Greece to find elderly 114 for every month, they were unvaccinated.
[1:51:09.940 --> 1:51:16.020]  Oh, and it goes on and on and on.
[1:51:16.020 --> 1:51:20.820]  You see, what they did to the foster children, they're now externalizing on everybody.
[1:51:20.820 --> 1:51:27.980]  And these new injections erase your immunity and turn your white blood cells off on record.
[1:51:27.980 --> 1:51:30.340]  Israel's already on to their fourth and fifth shot.
[1:51:30.340 --> 1:51:33.820]  What's the only thing that vaccinated the unvaccinated have in common?
[1:51:33.820 --> 1:51:35.940]  None of you are fully vaccinated.
[1:51:35.940 --> 1:51:42.980]  You're never fully vaccinated until you're six feet under and dead.
[1:51:42.980 --> 1:51:44.060]  We're going to fight this.
[1:51:44.060 --> 1:51:45.060]  We're going to stand together.
[1:51:45.060 --> 1:51:52.100]  You know, I've got to give support to a lot of prominent people that I've talked to who
[1:51:52.100 --> 1:51:56.900]  are fighting this and they just say, it feels like we've gone too far, there's no return.
[1:51:56.900 --> 1:51:58.100]  And that's the way the universe works.
[1:51:58.100 --> 1:52:01.780]  No, the globalists have gone too far and they can't stop and we can't stop either because
[1:52:01.780 --> 1:52:03.460]  we're not signing on to all this evil.
[1:52:03.460 --> 1:52:05.300]  But yes, you're living in incredible times.
[1:52:05.300 --> 1:52:08.940]  You're living with a world government that bought up the media and big pharma and big
[1:52:08.940 --> 1:52:13.860]  tech literally murdering everybody.
[1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:17.420]  The politicians get the word, they don't take the shots.
[1:52:17.420 --> 1:52:20.220]  It's for us, not for them.
[1:52:20.220 --> 1:52:33.060]  Now, let me show you the next big group of news articles that I've got here in the stack
[1:52:33.060 --> 1:52:39.820]  that are so incredibly important.
[1:52:39.820 --> 1:52:46.140]  I had my whole stack on the Gisling Maxwell cover up and the pedophiles and the government's
[1:52:46.140 --> 1:52:50.820]  running those and the CIA running, the child kidnapping rings.
[1:52:50.820 --> 1:52:53.420]  And for some reason, I'm having trouble finding it in my stacks here.
[1:52:53.420 --> 1:52:57.740]  But let me just go through these headlines and then we'll be able to find them.
[1:52:57.740 --> 1:53:01.540]  We'll be able to find them regardless.
[1:53:01.540 --> 1:53:07.980]  Yeah, let's just run through all these and I'll find them and where the other.
[1:53:07.980 --> 1:53:08.980]  Here it is.
[1:53:08.980 --> 1:53:13.900]  The Biden infrastructure bill includes passive monitoring vehicle kill switch mandate for
[1:53:13.900 --> 1:53:14.980]  automakers.
[1:53:14.980 --> 1:53:16.820]  People just can't believe that was actually in the bill.
[1:53:16.820 --> 1:53:20.740]  We told you and it says that they can remotely monitor you and kill your car.
[1:53:20.740 --> 1:53:22.620]  Oh, but the prisons are wide open.
[1:53:22.620 --> 1:53:25.500]  The borders are wide open, but you're going to have AI watching you.
[1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:26.500]  They get rid of the police.
[1:53:26.500 --> 1:53:27.500]  They get rid of the society.
[1:53:27.500 --> 1:53:30.860]  And when you don't behave, they just turn your vehicle off.
[1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:35.980]  It's AI controlling former CNN host Chris Cuomo is accused of sexual misconduct in media.
[1:53:35.980 --> 1:53:40.420]  How about accused of covering up his brother's mass murder in nursing homes by shipping COVID
[1:53:40.420 --> 1:53:41.420]  patients there?
[1:53:41.420 --> 1:53:46.500]  But they use the smokescreen of the sexual harassment fed fest white supremacist group
[1:53:46.500 --> 1:53:49.700]  who stage March on Capitol ridiculed as FBI scythe.
[1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:51.980]  You got to see the article on infowars.com.
[1:53:51.980 --> 1:53:55.220]  I mean, it was what it's a Lincoln project 2.0, you know, dressed up like this.
[1:53:55.220 --> 1:53:58.380]  They've been wearing the same stupid uniform.
[1:53:58.380 --> 1:54:04.060]  San Francisco restaurant refuses to serve cops, claim guns, make them uncomfortable.
[1:54:04.060 --> 1:54:08.900]  Ever seen anything like it, Los Angeles residents stunned as violent crime creeps into wealthier
[1:54:08.900 --> 1:54:09.900]  communities.
[1:54:09.900 --> 1:54:10.900]  It isn't creeping.
[1:54:10.900 --> 1:54:12.260]  It's rushing in.
[1:54:12.260 --> 1:54:14.420]  Bob Dole dies.
[1:54:14.420 --> 1:54:16.300]  Robots are now able to replicate.
[1:54:16.300 --> 1:54:17.820]  What does this mean for humanity?
[1:54:17.820 --> 1:54:19.340]  Means look out.
[1:54:19.340 --> 1:54:20.340]  Video.
[1:54:20.340 --> 1:54:23.420]  Infowars crashes, Beto rally last night in Austin.
[1:54:23.420 --> 1:54:24.940]  Owen Schwartz did a great job.
[1:54:24.940 --> 1:54:25.940]  That video is on Infowars.
[1:54:25.940 --> 1:54:30.620]  He'll be coming up next hour playing some of that.
[1:54:30.620 --> 1:54:34.420]  Let's continue.
[1:54:34.420 --> 1:54:39.900]  Supply chain issues now causing shortages of heart medications, antibiotics, cancer and
[1:54:39.900 --> 1:54:40.900]  drugs.
[1:54:40.900 --> 1:54:45.540]  But the Democrats respond now by saying, quote, inflation like greed is good.
[1:54:45.540 --> 1:54:47.540]  Big articles out of that.
[1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:53.100]  Big articles in NBC, Associated Press, New York Times, all promoting inflation.
[1:54:53.100 --> 1:54:55.380]  Well, it's good for the bankers.
[1:54:55.380 --> 1:54:59.620]  They use it to buy everything up and then leave us the debt.
[1:54:59.620 --> 1:55:01.340]  But that just incredible.
[1:55:01.340 --> 1:55:03.340]  Here's another double things headline.
[1:55:03.340 --> 1:55:08.660]  Pro-lifers slam New York Times guest essay over claim that adoption can be more traumatic
[1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:09.660]  than abortion.
[1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:13.900]  Being chopped up and killed is better than having loving people adopt you.
[1:55:13.900 --> 1:55:15.860]  You see that?
[1:55:15.860 --> 1:55:16.860]  It's bioethics.
[1:55:16.860 --> 1:55:17.860]  Oh, you have a miserable life.
[1:55:17.860 --> 1:55:19.060]  We're going to go ahead and kill you.
[1:55:19.060 --> 1:55:20.060]  You'll be better.
[1:55:20.060 --> 1:55:21.060]  Never existing.
[1:55:21.060 --> 1:55:26.540]  Dark winter looms for Pennsylvanians as power bills set the store and they cut off coal
[1:55:26.540 --> 1:55:30.060]  production.
[1:55:30.060 --> 1:55:31.540]  And it goes on and on and on.
[1:55:31.540 --> 1:55:37.380]  Oh, but all the big bankers, they're all getting raises as fast as they can.
[1:55:37.380 --> 1:55:43.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, Democrat politicians renew calls to pack the U.S. Supreme Court.
[1:55:43.020 --> 1:55:44.540]  Add more liberal judges.
[1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:45.540]  Yeah.
[1:55:45.540 --> 1:55:47.380]  Hugo Chavez did it.
[1:55:47.380 --> 1:55:49.860]  Why not do it here?
[1:55:49.860 --> 1:55:54.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, oh, here's the stack.
[1:55:54.660 --> 1:55:56.780]  I'll have to cover this first thing on the show tomorrow.
[1:55:56.780 --> 1:55:57.780]  There's so much on this.
[1:55:57.780 --> 1:56:00.540]  I can't really do this justice right here at the end.
[1:56:00.540 --> 1:56:05.540]  But look, slip of the tongue, temporary D-Rail's Gisling Maxwell trial, child sex abusers at
[1:56:05.540 --> 1:56:09.060]  CIA, avoiding prosecution, protected by the CIA.
[1:56:09.060 --> 1:56:11.940]  CIA files say stabbers committed sex crimes involving children.
[1:56:11.940 --> 1:56:12.940]  They weren't prosecuted.
[1:56:12.940 --> 1:56:14.460]  Oh, really think so?
[1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:20.020]  German experiment that placed foster children with pedophiles over 30,000 of them over 30
[1:56:20.020 --> 1:56:21.020]  years.
[1:56:21.020 --> 1:56:27.220]  In one city alone, happened all the country, placing them with 30,000 pedophiles, biggest
[1:56:27.220 --> 1:56:30.220]  publication in Germany.
[1:56:30.220 --> 1:56:34.580]  That's what's at the bottom of this rat hole, of this spider web, of this Satanism.
[1:56:34.580 --> 1:56:36.660]  And now they don't want to just rape your children.
[1:56:36.660 --> 1:56:40.340]  They want to poison them and erase their immune system and give them blood clots and prion
[1:56:40.340 --> 1:56:41.340]  disease.
[1:56:41.340 --> 1:56:43.900]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[1:56:43.900 --> 1:56:44.900]  It's wild.
[1:56:44.900 --> 1:56:47.700]  And it's all here, ladies and gentlemen, and we tried to warn everybody.
[1:56:47.700 --> 1:56:51.060]  So stand up, speak out against it, and be prepared.
[1:56:51.060 --> 1:56:55.060]  Just thank God you live in areas that aren't as bad off as places like Germany and Australia.
[1:56:55.060 --> 1:56:57.580]  But once they make them fall, they're coming here.
[1:56:57.580 --> 1:57:00.900]  So we've got to save them over there to save ourselves over here, plus they're humans made
[1:57:00.900 --> 1:57:02.580]  by God, and we should love them and support them.
[1:57:02.580 --> 1:57:05.940]  Same thing with the new lockdowns in Africa, our design has caused more mass starvation
[1:57:05.940 --> 1:57:06.940]  and death as well.
[1:57:06.940 --> 1:57:07.940]  We don't stand up for them.
[1:57:07.940 --> 1:57:09.420]  God won't stand up for us.
[1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:13.460]  Separately, tomorrow is the last day of store-wide free shipping and double-patriot points on
[1:57:13.460 --> 1:57:17.020]  things like DNA Force Plus and vitamin mineral fusion and all of it.

[1:57:22.300 --> 1:57:26.620]  But whatever you do, if your local station doesn't carry Sunday live every Sunday, 6
[1:57:26.620 --> 1:57:29.420]  to 8 p.m. with Owen Stroyer, they should.
[1:57:29.420 --> 1:57:30.420]  And it's coming up.

[1:57:35.340 --> 1:57:38.980]  page of infowars.com, the live feeds are right there.

[1:57:42.420 --> 1:57:46.420]  Stay with us.
[1:57:46.420 --> 1:57:47.420]  Frank.
[1:57:47.420 --> 1:57:51.180]  I have a question to ask you.
[1:57:51.180 --> 1:57:56.940]  Why would you spend your money this Christmas season to buy gifts for friends and family
[1:57:56.940 --> 1:58:02.820]  and loved ones with the establishment, with the big corporations that are dedicated to
[1:58:02.820 --> 1:58:09.580]  waging war on all of our freedoms and suppressing us and forcing medical tyranny on us?
[1:58:09.580 --> 1:58:11.100]  I've never backed down to tyranny.
[1:58:11.100 --> 1:58:15.580]  We've had incredible success in supporting them, thanks for your support.
[1:58:15.580 --> 1:58:22.660]  But now, as 2021 comes to a close, I want to encourage you now more than ever to support
[1:58:22.660 --> 1:58:23.660]  the truth.
[1:58:23.660 --> 1:58:27.740]  And you do that at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:27.740 --> 1:58:32.460]  Storewide free shipping, double-patriot points running right now, huge deals on bottom mineral
[1:58:32.460 --> 1:58:36.180]  fusion, DNA force plus, lung cleanse and turbo force.
[1:58:36.180 --> 1:58:41.020]  And these are really amazing high-quality products that also fund the infowar.
[1:58:41.020 --> 1:58:47.260]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[1:58:47.260 --> 1:58:52.660]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[1:58:52.660 --> 1:58:58.020]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[1:58:58.020 --> 1:59:04.860]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[1:59:04.860 --> 1:59:10.820]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[1:59:10.820 --> 1:59:13.620]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:59:13.620 --> 1:59:18.900]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[1:59:18.900 --> 1:59:24.300]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[1:59:24.300 --> 1:59:25.800]  symptoms.
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:28.060]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[1:59:28.060 --> 1:59:29.060]  It is not an antihistamine.
[1:59:29.060 --> 1:59:34.060]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[1:59:34.060 --> 1:59:39.540]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:59:39.540 --> 1:59:42.220]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:59:42.220 --> 1:59:48.780]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:59:48.780 --> 2:00:12.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
