[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:30.840]  that's right Prince William and Kate Middleton are going to be married they're
[00:30.840 --> 00:34.160]  getting engaged now they're gonna be married next spring or summer in London
[00:34.160 --> 00:37.680]  there is a statement out of Buckingham kept palace Queen Elizabeth said she is
[00:37.680 --> 00:42.800]  absolutely delighted for her grandson and his bride to be the United States was
[00:42.800 --> 00:50.560]  founded on July 4th 1776 in resistance to the hegemonic despotic tyrannical rule
[00:50.560 --> 00:57.200]  of King George III and the abuse against the colonies and most of the British
[00:57.200 --> 01:02.440]  Parliament was against going to war with their fellow Englishmen because the king
[01:02.440 --> 01:08.320]  was unpopular there as well it was known that he was a German king his father
[01:08.320 --> 01:13.360]  being brought over to rule England these people could barely speak English
[01:13.360 --> 01:17.640]  nothing against Germans but you don't see me going over to Germany to rule them
[01:17.640 --> 01:25.800]  the very essence of July 4th and 1776 is resistance to the disgusting House of
[01:25.800 --> 01:29.760]  Windsor they didn't get that name until around World War one because before
[01:29.760 --> 01:33.640]  that they were known as the Saxe-Coburg gophers notice that we hear their names
[01:33.640 --> 01:38.760]  Prince William you never hear his last name do you the slave public many of
[01:38.760 --> 01:42.080]  them in England who support these people don't even know their last names
[01:42.080 --> 01:46.660]  because they don't want you knowing their last names three times the last three
[01:46.660 --> 01:51.960]  years the Parliament in Canada hasn't done what the Queen of England wants so
[01:51.960 --> 01:56.880]  she suspended them shut down the Parliament happened in the late 70s in
[01:56.880 --> 02:02.760]  Australia this is a tyrannical group pushing eugenics population reduction
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.840]  all the carbon taxes Prince Philip the Queen's husband another German royal
[02:07.840 --> 02:14.200]  Prince is a supporter of eugenics his cousin who was the Prince married to the
[02:14.200 --> 02:18.800]  Queen of the Netherlands unadmitted Nazi unadmitted eugenicist the point is
[02:18.800 --> 02:23.960]  these are the most filthy degenerate people you can imagine she owns more
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.720]  than half of Canada more than half the land in England and then she's paid by
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.640]  the government for her palaces and all the rest of it it's disgusting and to
[02:32.640 --> 02:39.160]  watch US television fawning Fox CNN CBS all of them oh it's so wonderful no one
[02:39.160 --> 02:47.160]  American wait until next week the way they're hyping it one week until the
[02:47.160 --> 02:51.000]  royal wedding this is an exciting stuff I mean it's it's hard I mean the energy
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.400]  is just palpable don't couples get married they're just hoping that some bank
[02:54.400 --> 02:57.360]  will be nice enough to give them a mortgage yeah these folks have a number
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.440]  of palaces to pick from NBC's is launching a free royal wedding app for the
[03:02.440 --> 03:08.400]  iPad gotta this is truly a love story that captures everybody's attention this
[03:08.400 --> 03:12.400]  goes back to Edward Bernays a hundred years ago saying look to make
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.280]  politicians and royalty popular we'll have Hollywood stars come to banquets
[03:16.280 --> 03:20.120]  and events with them we'll have music stars will have other people go there
[03:20.120 --> 03:26.080]  to basically make these elites be seen as celebrities themselves you know why
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.320]  America was founded because under the imperial royal system in Europe and
[03:30.320 --> 03:34.520]  England if you weren't part of the inside group who had basically the
[03:34.520 --> 03:40.480]  patronage of the crown where they gave you land houses jobs you couldn't even
[03:40.480 --> 03:43.920]  get a license to be a carpenter a license to be a blacksmith a license to
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.640]  brew beer unless their local lords gave you the authorization so it wasn't just
[03:49.640 --> 03:54.840]  that you had to pay outrageous taxes you had to get their permission to even
[03:54.840 --> 04:00.720]  have a job to have a profession ladies and gentlemen that's the essence of
[04:00.720 --> 04:06.240]  globalism is big mega corporations many of which are owned and controlled by the
[04:06.240 --> 04:11.360]  German royal family that runs England and of course other Netherlands the whole
[04:11.360 --> 04:15.280]  system they set up and they promote is about this new global corporate system
[04:15.280 --> 04:19.520]  worldwide that through government power shuts down their competition and
[04:19.520 --> 04:24.840]  transfers the people's wealth through taxes to the offshore cartels these
[04:24.840 --> 04:30.000]  people are parasites they're disgusting they're filthy and if we want to
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.560]  reclaim the spirit of 1776 we should realize how abhorrent monarchy is in
[04:35.560 --> 04:40.920]  all of its forms and that includes the UN and the new royalty under the
[04:40.920 --> 04:47.520]  unelected EU bureaucratic system where over 80% of England's laws even though
[04:47.520 --> 04:52.400]  they're not part of the EU are made by EU bureaucrats please everyone remember
[04:52.400 --> 04:56.200]  the spirit of 1776 and a lot of folks in England are saying they're gonna go out
[04:56.200 --> 05:01.240]  and protest it first the government said you've got the day you may be arrested
[05:01.240 --> 05:07.000]  and or subject to other police action tyranny is here the grim future foretold

[07:03.800 --> 07:08.000]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.320]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[07:12.320 --> 07:16.280]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[07:16.280 --> 07:20.720]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[07:20.720 --> 07:24.960]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[07:24.960 --> 07:28.720]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.720 --> 07:32.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:32.840 --> 07:36.800]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:36.800 --> 07:40.640]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[07:59.400 --> 08:05.280]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.280 --> 08:16.680]  because there's a war on for your mind it is Thursday the 28th day of April
[08:16.680 --> 08:24.640]  2011 we're gonna be live here for at least the next three hours obviously the
[08:24.640 --> 08:30.760]  dollar is continuing its accelerated plunge we have Obama releasing his
[08:30.760 --> 08:35.560]  supposed long-form birth certificate yesterday and the anomalies and questions
[08:35.560 --> 08:43.960]  have only intensified Japan is reporting even higher levels now almost six
[08:43.960 --> 08:49.400]  weeks in of radiation coming out of Fukushima and the story is basically not
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.280]  even in the news anymore continued clouds of radioactivity are coming across
[08:54.280 --> 09:00.960]  the Pacific over North America and different radioactive isotope levels
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.680]  are building up and increasing and the feds have nothing to say about it
[09:06.680 --> 09:10.560]  state governments are continuing to report higher and higher levels in food
[09:10.560 --> 09:16.160]  and milk in the produce and the milk particularly building up in the soils
[09:16.160 --> 09:20.960]  and then being transferred to the plants and then the grass being eaten by the
[09:20.960 --> 09:25.400]  cows and then precipitating out in the milk we're gonna be going over all of it
[09:25.400 --> 09:31.760]  today but first I want to just briefly and we'll open the phones I'll get your
[09:31.760 --> 09:36.920]  take on this as well get into the Obama birth certificate I was about to walk out
[09:36.920 --> 09:43.600]  of the office at about 6 p.m. last night and Rob do who's a video guy and also a
[09:43.600 --> 09:49.520]  photoshop does other graphics motion he came over and he said look at this he
[09:49.520 --> 09:52.840]  said a lot of photoshop sites a lot of big sites are pointing out this is in
[09:52.840 --> 09:56.080]  layers and he said that's not the issue because when you put it into
[09:56.080 --> 10:03.200]  illustrator it automatically will separate the text out if you want and
[10:03.200 --> 10:06.560]  they know all the technicals and they explained it to me we've got some other
[10:06.560 --> 10:12.200]  Photoshop people here who looked at it and said yeah normally if you put an
[10:12.200 --> 10:20.080]  illustrator it would remove the text out but this has multiple layers and boxes
[10:20.080 --> 10:27.440]  around areas inside of the text and if you look at the letters it isn't even a
[10:27.440 --> 10:32.960]  good forgery it looks like because it's written with a typewriter but then
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.280]  there are other areas where it's a completely different font and two or
[10:37.280 --> 10:42.000]  three times darker completely black and the other areas are more gray and there's
[10:42.000 --> 10:49.840]  also areas where the signatures and things go over the green hash background
[10:49.840 --> 10:54.040]  of the long-form certificate in fact we'll put that certificate the new
[10:54.040 --> 10:58.640]  long-form certificate on screen for folks and we'll blow it up a little bit but
[10:58.640 --> 11:06.120]  you can see that green square pattern that it has in the background similar to
[11:06.120 --> 11:09.840]  many long-form birth certificates around the country that are either light
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.480]  mint green or light blue mine in Dallas was a light blue where I was born in
[11:15.480 --> 11:22.280]  1974 and it also had the seal on it and my feet marks but the issue it also is
[11:22.280 --> 11:27.560]  they told us for over two years this didn't exist they said that the little
[11:27.560 --> 11:34.840]  printout that was basically a government receipt for one proof of birth you you go
[11:34.840 --> 11:39.880]  to the Bureau of National Statistics vital statistics you can get the original if
[11:39.880 --> 11:43.880]  you didn't have the copy from birth if you lost it but if you go to your
[11:43.880 --> 11:48.120]  County Health Department they will give you a printout that just logs into the
[11:48.120 --> 11:52.120]  computer system with the feds and then they say yes we've got a birth
[11:52.120 --> 11:59.280]  certificate under this name so the form we've got on screen that's part of the
[11:59.280 --> 12:06.360]  long form is reported to have not existed for years this didn't exist you were
[12:06.360 --> 12:10.560]  conspiracy theorists to say that what they'd earlier released was just a
[12:10.560 --> 12:13.800]  computer printout and not a birth certificate but now they're releasing
[12:13.800 --> 12:18.400]  this and saying okay this is the long form and there's a lot of issues they
[12:18.400 --> 12:24.040]  say his father's race is African that was not on birth certificates in the 60s
[12:24.040 --> 12:30.320]  and that's been looked into you've also we'll put it back on screen again you
[12:30.320 --> 12:35.680]  have a what looks like a photo or a scan of it but then part of it is cut off
[12:35.680 --> 12:41.080]  it looks like it's almost a photo if you look on the left hand side or right hand
[12:41.080 --> 12:48.720]  side depending on how you're looking at the image it it it curves off looking
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.640]  more like a photo and not a scan and then they went ahead and put the same
[12:53.640 --> 13:00.320]  hash mark design that's on the background of the supposed paper around it
[13:00.320 --> 13:08.080]  which is even more bizarre and just looking at it on screen some of the
[13:08.080 --> 13:16.720]  hash marks or the pattern design goes over the edge of the photo or scan and
[13:16.720 --> 13:22.680]  hangs over if you look where it says state of Hawaii and then says HA if you
[13:22.680 --> 13:27.680]  look at that you can see what appears at the hash mark or the pattern is going
[13:27.680 --> 13:31.680]  over the edge and then again our Photoshop people have looked at this
[13:31.680 --> 13:37.400]  there there's so many anomalies that it makes your head spin now we went and
[13:37.400 --> 13:41.080]  shot a video last night and we got it out as quickly as we could because do had
[13:41.080 --> 13:46.640]  to go home by 9 and and we did add the point in the video that we shot that we
[13:46.640 --> 13:53.360]  put other things on screen other documents including old documents and did
[13:53.360 --> 13:57.760]  the function to remove the text and it came off in one layer and I'm gonna do
[13:57.760 --> 14:00.720]  another video today where we do this with other birth certificates that are
[14:00.720 --> 14:06.400]  online and we're going to compare it and it it didn't show two three four five
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.840]  layers there's a whole bunch of different layers but that itself isn't the
[14:10.840 --> 14:14.840]  main meat of the matter if you watch the video that we've put out that's up on
[14:14.840 --> 14:20.080]  info wars.com and prison planet.com it's titled video proof Obama birth certificate
[14:20.080 --> 14:27.320]  of fraud and we just show a few of these anomalies a lot of other sites
[14:27.320 --> 14:32.680]  literally hundreds and hundreds of them have have dug in even deeper that well
[14:32.680 --> 14:38.240]  you can just look at it one letter in a word will be a lot darker and even a
[14:38.240 --> 14:44.680]  different font not even close to the rest of the word and then lo and behold
[14:44.680 --> 14:49.000]  in the layers you can see where all the letters that don't look right the
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.560]  numbers that'll look right they're in their own letter and then you can say
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.160]  well that's just the scanner recognizing that it's a different layer or
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.280]  that's a different color absolutely that's the point the computer looks at
[15:01.280 --> 15:05.800]  this and I'm not talking about one area that's typed in and then another word
[15:05.800 --> 15:09.560]  that's typed in you know by different typewriter I'm talking about the words
[15:09.560 --> 15:14.960]  that are congruent have letters added at the front the middle the back the
[15:14.960 --> 15:21.800]  signatures are in different layers so what's happening is the computer in the
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.760]  illustrator program is recognizing all of this and pulling it out separately but
[15:27.760 --> 15:30.680]  then when you and then I could say well that's just the computer doing that and
[15:30.680 --> 15:35.200]  and do made this point but he cut a 22 minute video down to eight minutes and
[15:35.200 --> 15:40.240]  so a lot of you experts are on there going no you know I'm an expert we got a
[15:40.240 --> 15:43.800]  bunch of experts in our office they all concur it's the letters it's the numbers
[15:43.800 --> 15:48.520]  they've been changed yes an illustrator and other programs it will separate
[15:48.520 --> 15:54.040]  things out this is different because the letters aren't even the same and so
[15:54.040 --> 15:57.760]  we'll do a more detailed video on this and have it as a video response and a
[15:57.760 --> 16:05.640]  link posted later today under the current video video proof Obama birth
[16:05.640 --> 16:09.520]  certificate of fraud in fact we might even just take the video that I right
[16:09.520 --> 16:14.320]  now I've been talking about this and then and then do can capture video while
[16:14.320 --> 16:17.960]  he's got an illustrator and show you all of this and also show you many of the
[16:17.960 --> 16:24.360]  other sites even mainline sites that are in the photo shop and study photo shop
[16:24.360 --> 16:31.760]  they're all saying the same thing I'm trying to think of a explanation of
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.800]  where this could be a real birth certificate remember two and a half years
[16:35.800 --> 16:40.320]  ago I had tarply on I had burg on and I was non-committal and I said I don't know
[16:40.320 --> 16:43.560]  where he was really born I know they're covering up his background they should
[16:43.560 --> 16:48.320]  release it but I don't know then in the last few years more evidence came out
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.640]  about the Barry Cetero Cetero and then major papers said well that was his
[16:52.640 --> 16:56.640]  name he did change his name and then it begs the you know the issue of well did
[16:56.640 --> 17:00.960]  he give up his citizenship and clearly clearly he had to to be adopted under
[17:00.960 --> 17:06.160]  Indonesian law and he was known in college as Barry and and and so much of
[17:06.160 --> 17:11.000]  that is suppressed so something's going on but is this just a political football
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.720]  issue because they don't want you looking at the plunging dollar they don't
[17:13.720 --> 17:16.680]  want you looking at the Fukushima they don't want you looking at all the new
[17:16.680 --> 17:20.360]  wars they don't want you looking at all the corruption they don't want you
[17:20.360 --> 17:25.480]  looking at the big banks and in general electric and others paying no taxes a lot
[17:25.480 --> 17:30.880]  of news on that today because people think well why would Obama not release
[17:30.880 --> 17:34.600]  this and build up this controversy and then discredit himself because he's
[17:34.600 --> 17:40.400]  designed to be politically destroyed just like George W. Bush was and then they
[17:40.400 --> 17:45.040]  resuscitate them they rehab them they build them back up later their front
[17:45.040 --> 17:49.680]  men meant to play the part of the buck stops here and then meanwhile it comes
[17:49.680 --> 17:54.520]  and turns into this whole spectacle of how they're actually running things and
[17:54.520 --> 17:58.760]  not the big financial interest that have hijacked this country and written the
[17:58.760 --> 18:03.000]  tax laws and trade laws where they're exempt from the taxes exempt from the
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.680]  tariffs and trade and then anybody who's domestic is paying on average over 60%
[18:07.680 --> 18:12.400]  in one form of taxes or another the middle class that's disappearing and
[18:12.400 --> 18:17.160]  and being made poor and then the poor people are becoming even more poor many
[18:17.160 --> 18:20.920]  of them and being turned into a political weapon at least they're
[18:20.920 --> 18:26.080]  attempting this to sick large portions of the poor against the middle class
[18:26.080 --> 18:36.360]  saying wealth transfer clash of different socio-economic groups class
[18:36.360 --> 18:41.680]  warfare that's going to put food on your table when class warfare is always used
[18:41.680 --> 18:46.640]  by the mega elites to get rid of their competition and and and again I talked
[18:46.640 --> 18:50.000]  about this last week I talked about it Monday I've got to shoot a video sometime
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.280]  this week or a special report dealing with the fact we are winning last night
[18:54.280 --> 19:00.200]  I listened to a ton of talk radio and a ton of television again I listened to
[19:00.200 --> 19:06.200]  TV I don't really watch it and getting addicted to the XM's are just flip
[19:06.200 --> 19:10.600]  around on the TV stations listening without having to watch them and all
[19:10.600 --> 19:16.560]  the teleprompters and the sycophantic behavior and more and more it's coming
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.360]  out hey the mega elite are exempt and they actually get corporate welfare and
[19:21.360 --> 19:25.040]  they're actually trying to destroy the middle class a lot of mainline
[19:25.040 --> 19:28.400]  conservatives libertarians even liberals are starting to get this because the
[19:28.400 --> 19:33.400]  pain is is is intensifying financially and that has a way of getting folks to
[19:33.400 --> 19:38.320]  grow up investigate and really find out what's going on not just this rich
[19:38.320 --> 19:44.040]  people bad or people good or poor people bad rich people good no it's a wide
[19:44.040 --> 19:49.360]  complex spec for them and and and folks are really starting to get that a lot
[19:49.360 --> 19:54.280]  of other news coming up miss USA sexually molested up on drugs since

[22:09.200 --> 22:12.600]  instinct of unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher
[22:12.600 --> 22:16.600]  education but all across America students are graduating with hundreds of
[22:16.600 --> 22:20.760]  thousands of dollars in debt and no jobs most college graduates are now
[22:20.760 --> 22:24.200]  admitting that they would have been better off getting a job at Walmart or

[24:08.880 --> 24:26.320]  mind
[24:26.320 --> 24:32.400]  we are back live and last night in this morning it's now roll up the front page
[24:32.400 --> 24:38.840]  drudge report commas link to curtain emos report new obama birth certificate
[24:38.840 --> 24:44.720]  is a forgery now this is up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[24:44.720 --> 24:52.880]  right now and to be clear national review AP all of them have reported on
[24:52.880 --> 24:58.120]  that the president's long-form birth certificate the purported birth certificate
[24:58.120 --> 25:03.760]  was released in layers just like in Photoshop or Illustrator okay and we go
[25:03.760 --> 25:09.320]  over that in our video in our articles but that's not the main focus the issue
[25:09.320 --> 25:15.400]  is by it being in layers the computer recognizes different fonts and different
[25:15.400 --> 25:21.880]  text that have been manipulated and and this isn't even hard to recognize if you
[25:21.880 --> 25:26.240]  watch the video that rob do and I put together last night yes we talk about it
[25:26.240 --> 25:33.440]  being in layers but the main issue that we focus on is and we show close-ups of
[25:33.440 --> 25:37.040]  it is that when you go through the layers applying the different layers you
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.000]  see all the areas that have been changed but you don't even need the computer to
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.400]  do it you can look and see where they'll have a word and then it gets a lot
[25:46.400 --> 25:54.240]  darker and is a totally different font so something really crazy is going on
[25:54.240 --> 26:01.040]  here and I don't know why they wouldn't produce a better fake if they were or I
[26:01.040 --> 26:07.440]  don't know if when they were scanning it that can it can computers overwrite
[26:07.440 --> 26:14.240]  letters and words I've talked to our Photoshop people and they say no so of
[26:14.240 --> 26:18.720]  course our videos being attacked in the comments and attacked on YouTube and
[26:18.720 --> 26:22.920]  other places and literally hundreds and hundreds of other sites to be
[26:22.920 --> 26:26.840]  conservative are out there pointing out the same thing including a lot of big
[26:26.840 --> 26:30.880]  Photoshop sites they're saying look at these letters look at these words this
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.880]  isn't even the same font there are ones that are digital ones I mean it doesn't
[26:35.880 --> 26:40.920]  even look the same there are letters that are different in fact in my video the
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.440]  eight-minute video we put together proof Obama birth certificate of forgery
[26:45.440 --> 26:50.240]  perhaps you put that video up on screen and and fast forward in it for viewers
[26:50.240 --> 26:54.640]  radio listeners can go watch it and we show some examples but if you just put
[26:54.640 --> 26:59.440]  the birth certificate for yourself on your own computer from White House dot
[26:59.440 --> 27:05.720]  gov and look at all the letters and words that are different fonts different
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.920]  shades of dark and then you put it into Illustrator you'll notice all the ones
[27:09.920 --> 27:13.240]  that stand out and don't look right those are the ones that are in different
[27:13.240 --> 27:16.840]  layers so whether they did this in different layers when they made it or
[27:16.840 --> 27:21.160]  whether the computer is just recognizing different fonts and shades that's the
[27:21.160 --> 27:32.400]  issue is that this thing is really a conundrum because it's hard to believe
[27:32.400 --> 27:38.200]  and we'll put the birth certificate back on screen that the system would put
[27:38.200 --> 27:48.200]  something out this fraudulent this shoddy it really makes the head spin and so
[27:48.200 --> 27:53.280]  many of the words in fact blow it up there in the lower middle kind of six
[27:53.280 --> 28:00.800]  o'clock area where it says none look at none right above the signature or it
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.240]  says Obama right there where it says none the E and we've blown it up to full
[28:06.240 --> 28:12.080]  screen here in the office is a different font clearly and is about three
[28:12.080 --> 28:22.520]  times darker on the computer vector scope it is pure black the blacks are as
[28:22.520 --> 28:31.280]  high as they get and that's a TV term for a vector scope or a color scope it
[28:31.280 --> 28:38.720]  is pure black total black now you know in is barely even readable and a
[28:38.720 --> 28:44.920]  different font and I've got the some of our Photoshop people standing in there
[28:44.920 --> 28:50.480]  in the studio maybe I should try to get them in here and get them on air to talk
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.080]  about this or perhaps I should open the phones up in fact let me just open the
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.280]  phones up now and then after I cover some of the other incredibly important
[28:58.280 --> 29:02.560]  news we'll take some phone calls from Photoshop people from document experts
[29:02.560 --> 29:06.120]  but this would be like if somebody gave you a hundred dollar bill and you're a
[29:06.120 --> 29:11.880]  movie theater ticket teller and or the concession stand selling popcorn they
[29:11.880 --> 29:16.000]  give you a hundred dollar bill and you look at it and you look at the letters
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.240]  and you know what a hundred looks like and and some of them are smudge some of
[29:19.240 --> 29:22.640]  them are more bold some of them are different fonts you go is this a real
[29:22.640 --> 29:26.360]  hundred dollar bill I mean I mean it's really just that I'm no Photoshop person
[29:26.360 --> 29:32.760]  I'm no illustrator person I can just look at this and go look at that and then
[29:32.760 --> 29:42.000]  you've got some of the signatures going over the green background designs again
[29:42.000 --> 29:48.680]  this is very very bizarre and I'd say 99% chance it's been altered and messed
[29:48.680 --> 29:55.600]  with a very squirrely we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[33:41.440 --> 33:46.560]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard time we are here
[33:46.560 --> 33:51.600]  live now I want to hear from Photoshop people illustrator experts on that
[33:51.600 --> 33:56.760]  particular program with the midnight do we're wondering if the only way this
[33:56.760 --> 34:01.920]  could not be a forgery is they have some scanners that when they scan if things
[34:01.920 --> 34:08.720]  aren't readable for the visually impaired sometimes they have programs that
[34:08.720 --> 34:14.720]  will overwrite things that are too faint to read if that setting was basically
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.860]  on so that perhaps we've got to dig more into it could be how this birth
[34:19.860 --> 34:26.120]  certificate is real but then it it it overwrote some of the words so that it
[34:26.120 --> 34:33.520]  could be read but regardless this thing has been altered in some way and is it a
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.120]  fraud a forgery I think the evidence is leaning that way and I've not been a
[34:38.120 --> 34:42.000]  birther we've investigated it we've looked at it we've been criticized for
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.840]  not doing more on it and we know his name was Barry Citero I mean that's
[34:46.840 --> 34:51.520]  always been my big focus and it seems like they're always putting raw meat
[34:51.520 --> 34:57.560]  out there to really try to get people to get obsessed with this when there's so
[34:57.560 --> 35:01.080]  many other things happening but we will open the phones up specifically and
[35:01.080 --> 35:08.280]  only for folks that have gone and looked at this to give us your view of it the
[35:08.280 --> 35:15.720]  toll-free number to join us 1-800-259-9231 but here are some of the
[35:15.720 --> 35:22.320]  headlines new Obama birth certificate is a forgery Kurt Nemo will be Goldberg
[35:22.320 --> 35:28.160]  plays race card on birth certificate issue here's Paul Watson's article
[35:28.160 --> 35:33.440]  Obama birth certificate number proves forgery question mark and it says
[35:33.440 --> 35:37.160]  despite the establishment media declaring case closed on the birth of
[35:37.160 --> 35:40.680]  issue this is another area the release of what proportionate Barack Obama's
[35:40.680 --> 35:43.840]  long-form birth certificate which they said didn't exist and there was no such
[35:43.840 --> 35:48.680]  thing remember that remember that it was only the receipt has only caused a
[35:48.680 --> 35:51.520]  firestorm of new suspicion amongst Americans with the document only
[35:51.520 --> 35:55.320]  serving to confirm unexplained anomalies such as why Obama's birth certificate
[35:55.320 --> 36:01.400]  number is higher than that of people born after him at the same hospital and
[36:01.400 --> 36:06.280]  that's a whole other area and why is the Kenya spell different than what it's
[36:06.280 --> 36:08.800]  spelled today they changed the spelling after it was no longer a British
[36:08.800 --> 36:14.840]  protectorate and now they've got polls out different regional polls national
[36:14.840 --> 36:20.040]  polls they vary but all of them I've seen over 55% of the American people
[36:20.040 --> 36:25.600]  believe that this is a forgery in early reaction is anything to go by the
[36:25.600 --> 36:29.120]  deluge of editorials and outlets like the Washington Post the New York Times
[36:29.120 --> 36:32.960]  claiming the birth or movement is dead are completely off the mark a poll
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.040]  taken by the Colorado Springs Gazette shows 55% believe the birth certificate
[36:37.040 --> 36:41.960]  is probably forged and only 31% believing it's genuine I'm sick of it I
[36:41.960 --> 36:46.080]  want to go after Obama on his issues we're gonna do some of that here in a
[36:46.080 --> 36:50.840]  moment but still he's a puppet at the end of the day but Curt Nemos worked at
[36:50.840 --> 36:56.440]  TV stations and newspapers for decades he's a great Photoshop guy he knows all
[36:56.440 --> 37:00.240]  the programs he said look at these letters look at these numbers these are
[37:00.240 --> 37:03.680]  different these are different fonts we blew it up on a big screen computer and
[37:03.680 --> 37:10.160]  there it was my other Photoshop folks say something's wrong with this I don't
[37:10.160 --> 37:14.480]  know but but more and more we're thinking we're looking into it that it
[37:14.480 --> 37:19.160]  may have been a scanner they use with a setting that went into stuff that was
[37:19.160 --> 37:24.160]  faded out or hard to read and basically there are settings and some scanners and
[37:24.160 --> 37:27.520]  they're in there ferreting out ferreting it out right now that could
[37:27.520 --> 37:32.680]  could could overwrite so that it could be read but but still then why would they
[37:32.680 --> 37:38.960]  put that out knowing that that would heighten the debate and the issue okay
[37:38.960 --> 37:44.680]  so we've got a lot of different views and ideas and info wars.com this has
[37:44.680 --> 37:49.800]  been altered now do you call that a forgery it was our headline right
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.160]  saying it's a hundred percent a forgery or it looks like a forgery am I
[37:53.160 --> 37:58.240]  writing the video saying this is a forgery looking at it is that's what I
[37:58.240 --> 38:06.320]  believe but it becomes one of those so proper a type of events that just
[38:06.320 --> 38:14.280]  basically go on and on and on and on my sinuses have been really totally not
[38:14.280 --> 38:19.920]  even clogged up just swollen the last week so I have to keep clearing my like
[38:19.920 --> 38:23.320]  like someone snorkeling who goes down over 10 feet I've got to keep clearing
[38:23.320 --> 38:31.040]  my middle ear to be able to hear that's why time-to-time but trying to clear my
[38:31.040 --> 38:40.040]  sinuses who continuing here I want to hear from you on this 1-800-259-9231
[38:40.040 --> 38:47.840]  is the toll-free number to join us and we'll get your take on it Tim Jamie and
[38:47.840 --> 38:51.040]  others that are patiently holding again I want to specifically hear from people
[38:51.040 --> 38:54.840]  that work in Photoshop people that work in Illustrator the people that
[38:54.840 --> 39:03.120]  understand scanners what what are you seeing what are you thinking 1-800-259-9231
[39:03.120 --> 39:08.720]  and we'll get you up and on the air now here's all the other news being
[39:08.720 --> 39:15.720]  distracted by the big birth certificate ongoing controversy and debate to see
[39:15.720 --> 39:23.920]  NBC the Fed will make sure Obama wins in 2012 strategist lawmaker attempts to
[39:23.920 --> 39:30.440]  hide from angry taxpayers we've got reports of that where the politicians
[39:30.440 --> 39:35.340]  are hiding out because the public is getting so angry at the state and
[39:35.340 --> 39:40.680]  federal level also Oklahoma Senate okay's bill targeting illegal immigrants
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.000]  and we'll be going over that report continuing here with the big stack of
[39:46.000 --> 39:53.360]  financial news more people applied for unemployment benefits more people
[39:53.360 --> 39:58.600]  requested unemployment benefits last week the second increase in three weeks
[39:58.600 --> 40:05.040]  economic growth slow as inflation measures spikes up but we've seen Bernanke
[40:05.040 --> 40:08.160]  and meeting after meeting in the house banking and Senate banking committee
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.840]  saying there's no problem with inflation no problem in the future with inflation
[40:12.840 --> 40:17.240]  because of quantitative easing that means monetizing debt or turning up the
[40:17.240 --> 40:21.200]  digital printing presses now he's reversing himself saying oh yes inflation
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.160]  is going to be an issue because the head of Walmart the head of McDonald's and
[40:25.160 --> 40:28.440]  countless others are pointing out they've got to raise prices there's a
[40:28.440 --> 40:33.400]  headline today out that Walmart customers running out of money Walmart's
[40:33.400 --> 40:38.280]  complaining about seeing their sales go down I mean it's it's on so so they've
[40:38.280 --> 40:41.920]  gone from denying that we were in a recession and now a depression to more
[40:41.920 --> 40:45.760]  and more having to admit what's happening here's another one out of the
[40:45.760 --> 40:51.360]  Wall Street Journal dollar loses more ground the dollar dropped if our
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.400]  economic indicators pointed to a dismal US unemployment a picture and slowing
[40:56.400 --> 41:02.440]  economic growth first time it claims for unemployment benefits jumped 25,000 to
[41:02.440 --> 41:08.400]  429,000 indicating employers might have recently slowed their hiring recently
[41:08.400 --> 41:15.120]  economists were expecting claims to fall to 3 or 95,000 at the same time
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.880]  gross domestic product rose a modest 1.8% and that's with all that money
[41:19.880 --> 41:24.200]  going out of the economy now here's a Bloomberg report stocks fall dollar
[41:24.200 --> 41:31.880]  weekends as US GDP growth slows gold reaches another record high of $1,534
[41:31.880 --> 41:41.480]  and five cents copper also rose 0.7% continuing London Guardian reports
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.000]  gold hits fresh highs as US dollar falls a three-year low
[41:46.000 --> 41:53.120]  continuing push for Pentagon cuts tops Panetta's agenda President Barack Obama's
[41:53.120 --> 41:56.760]  choice of expert budget cutter Leon Panetta to leave the Defense Department
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.280]  as clear signal the White House perceives the nation's deficit crisis not the
[42:01.280 --> 42:06.320]  wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is its toughest challenge and then a bizarre
[42:06.320 --> 42:10.960]  video statement that we've got linked up on Bloomberg the American dream blog
[42:10.960 --> 42:16.400]  wrote about it we've got it up at info wars.com if you are against raising the
[42:16.400 --> 42:21.960]  debt ceiling you are part of Al Qaeda we have a link to that full video interview
[42:21.960 --> 42:25.480]  we're trying to grab it right now and just grab the specific clip out of the
[42:25.480 --> 42:32.920]  full interview we'll have that later in the transmission but here's the quote by
[42:32.920 --> 42:41.280]  O'Neill the former Bush Treasury Secretary and here's the quote O'Neill
[42:41.280 --> 42:44.840]  actually made the following statement the people who are threatening not to
[42:44.840 --> 42:50.120]  pass the debt ceiling our own version of Al Qaeda terrorist really he goes on
[42:50.120 --> 42:55.960]  they're really putting our whole society at risk by threatening to round up 50
[42:55.960 --> 43:02.240]  percent of the members of Congress who are loony and who put our credit at
[43:02.240 --> 43:06.960]  risk let me let me read that quote again the people they're really putting
[43:06.960 --> 43:12.800]  our whole society at risk by threatening to round up 50 percent of the
[43:12.800 --> 43:19.280]  members of Congress who are loony who would put our credit at risk so he
[43:19.280 --> 43:24.240]  basically stumbles over looks like he's implying we should round them up
[43:24.240 --> 43:27.680]  because they're loony in Congress and don't want to raise the debt ceiling so
[43:27.680 --> 43:32.200]  you've got this insider banker who helped get rid of Glass-Steagall and help
[43:32.200 --> 43:36.360]  continue that along and who helped the banker bailouts making a bizarre
[43:36.360 --> 43:45.320]  statement about well let me just read the quote again the people who are
[43:45.320 --> 43:49.880]  threatening not to pass the debt ceiling are our version of Al Qaeda really
[43:49.880 --> 43:55.360]  they're really putting our whole society at risk by threatening to round up 50
[43:55.360 --> 43:59.360]  percent of the members of Congress who were loony who put our credit at risk I
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.520]  mean take that for what it says that we have the video let's just play it and
[44:03.520 --> 44:07.720]  you make what you can out of it but but remember what they said a month ago with
[44:07.720 --> 44:16.040]  the Bernard von Nuthaus note house statement that the prosecutor after he
[44:16.040 --> 44:19.160]  was convicted and it looks like he's sentenced to 15 years that's what they're
[44:19.160 --> 44:23.720]  shooting for for 13 years putting out the liberty currency that's silver and
[44:23.720 --> 44:27.600]  gold and openly speaks out against the Federal Reserve does not master aid as
[44:27.600 --> 44:34.600]  Federal Reserve knows it's silver and gold the the prosecutor said he is a
[44:34.600 --> 44:40.240]  what's the exact quote effect as we print me the AP it's gonna pop in my
[44:40.240 --> 44:46.680]  head in a minute just Liberty dollar head convicted I believe was the headline
[44:46.680 --> 44:50.920]  and they have several bizarre quotes they said we will infiltrate these
[44:50.920 --> 44:55.880]  groups these people are terrorist undermining our country and undermining
[44:55.880 --> 45:03.560]  our currency he is a unique type of terrorist that was the exact quote he is
[45:03.560 --> 45:08.560]  a unique type of terrorist and we will infiltrate these groups we will take them
[45:08.560 --> 45:13.960]  down we will stop them and so now we have this bizarre statement about how
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.480]  you're a form of al-Qaeda if you don't want to go deeper into debt to the
[45:18.480 --> 45:24.040]  globalist bankers and if you don't want to raise taxes you you just sit down and
[45:24.040 --> 45:29.360]  shut up or you're a terrorist let's go ahead and play that clip and you know I
[45:29.360 --> 45:32.000]  think the people who are threatening not the past but that's really in our
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.200]  our version of al-Qaeda terrorists that really they're really putting our whole
[45:37.200 --> 45:43.840]  society at risk by threatening to round up 50% of the members of Congress who
[45:43.840 --> 45:48.320]  were loony who would put our credit at risk so Bain are not ruling out that
[45:48.320 --> 45:52.400]  any kind of debate over lifting the debt ceiling wrapping that into the budget
[45:52.400 --> 45:57.480]  debate is seriously a threat you think he's dangerous okay back that up because
[45:57.480 --> 46:04.360]  there's a back that up I want to play that clip one more time because now not
[46:04.360 --> 46:09.400]  just reading the text of it but hearing him it becomes clear he's saying they by
[46:09.400 --> 46:16.120]  demanding to cut this are basically pressuring us as if it's their fault what
[46:16.120 --> 46:22.240]  he's saying they're threatening to make us round them up I mean what do you make
[46:22.240 --> 46:26.000]  of that statement I mean he's saying they're our own type of domestic al-Qaeda
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.840]  that's clear and and then he goes on to say they're threatening to have to
[46:30.840 --> 46:34.840]  round up these loonies these members of Congress who are loony let's go ahead
[46:34.840 --> 46:38.520]  and play it again Congress needs to be responsible and adult and take action on
[46:38.520 --> 46:42.180]  the debt ceiling and you know I think the people who are threatening not the
[46:42.180 --> 46:47.480]  past the debt ceiling are our version of al-Qaeda terrorists that really they're
[46:47.480 --> 46:54.160]  really putting our whole society at risk by threatening to round up 50% of the
[46:54.160 --> 46:58.480]  members of Congress who are loony who would put our credit at risk so Bain
[46:58.480 --> 47:02.080]  are not ruling out that any kind of debate over lifting the debt ceiling
[47:02.080 --> 47:06.360]  wrapping that into the budget debate is seriously a threat you think he's
[47:06.360 --> 47:10.760]  dangerous I do wow because there's a chance you know if you just look at some
[47:10.760 --> 47:14.480]  of the things that people say well we'll still have enough money to pay the
[47:14.480 --> 47:19.280]  interest on our debt is beside the point see these globalists are masters so
[47:19.280 --> 47:26.360]  watching that for the third time now that is clearly a threat that is clearly
[47:26.360 --> 47:32.960]  a threat and these lawyers are masters at twisting it all in together and and
[47:32.960 --> 47:37.440]  saying they're threatening to have to round them up because they're looning and
[47:37.440 --> 47:43.760]  she says oh so they are a threat Bainer is a threat and he's like yes so see and
[47:43.760 --> 47:48.720]  he goes on I've got the text here that everything is anyone's fault who wants to
[47:48.720 --> 47:52.920]  cut taxes anyone who wants to not raise the debt ceiling and they keep raising
[47:52.920 --> 47:55.760]  it and raising it and raising it and raising it and raising it and the
[47:55.760 --> 48:01.240]  Republicans with the Democrats only cut 38 billion 38 billion ladies and
[48:01.240 --> 48:06.680]  gentlemen is chicken feed there are hundreds and hundreds depending on how
[48:06.680 --> 48:13.080]  you break it down of trillions of dollars of things that we've signed on to
[48:13.080 --> 48:19.080]  quote obligations oh sure it's 14.3 trillion that's currently owed and then
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.160]  the deficit by a couple trillion every year gets piled on and and and Obama
[48:23.160 --> 48:26.920]  spent more than all presidents before him combined in just two years I mean
[48:26.920 --> 48:30.960]  those numbers are all real and you've seen them out there you can pull them up
[48:30.960 --> 48:34.640]  people say it's Obama it was Republicans went along with getting rid of
[48:34.640 --> 48:39.000]  Glass-Steagall and and we've played the speeches here where Obama says you know
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.440]  we've got to get rid of fractional reserves requirements completely previously
[48:43.440 --> 48:46.440]  it was eight times whatever money you had in the bank you get a loan out then
[48:46.440 --> 48:50.040]  ten times then fifty a hundred two hundred three some of these banks are
[48:50.040 --> 48:56.840]  over five hundred times leveraged now they're too big to fail so we've been
[48:56.840 --> 49:01.880]  told and so we're signed on to all this debt and they're telling us that we've
[49:01.880 --> 49:07.320]  got to pay it it's impossible to pay it and people get confused they say well
[49:07.320 --> 49:11.800]  Alex are you saying throw all the welfare moms off or or or or get rid of
[49:11.800 --> 49:16.880]  the unions or cut Social Security that's not what I'm saying but I'm also
[49:16.880 --> 49:21.080]  pointing out that that has made people dependent you notice now that they're
[49:21.080 --> 49:25.040]  through inflation and other things cutting back what you're getting this
[49:25.040 --> 49:29.440]  was all about domesticating us and there are some poor people who do need help
[49:29.440 --> 49:35.880]  but one of your broke my point is though that is all a sideshow compared to the
[49:35.880 --> 49:43.680]  system itself of the Federal Reserve and to try to oversimplify blue collar
[49:43.680 --> 49:49.640]  working class people below them poor folks people in poverty it's a wide
[49:49.640 --> 49:54.480]  spectrum of people who because of disabilities or because of prison can't
[49:54.480 --> 50:00.800]  get jobs or because of mental illness or because they come from long histories
[50:00.800 --> 50:05.720]  of dependent poverty stricken people on the dole who are who are you know a
[50:05.720 --> 50:11.960]  500 pounds and get six or seven welfare checks I mean it runs the gamma and my
[50:11.960 --> 50:17.160]  point is those tens of millions of people out there who are welfare queens
[50:17.160 --> 50:21.720]  who are part of that you know really dangerous spectrum of people not folks
[50:21.720 --> 50:25.920]  that occasionally have gotten some help or gotten a student loan or been on been
[50:25.920 --> 50:29.720]  on welfare work for a while while they were getting over an illness that's one
[50:29.720 --> 50:34.160]  thing but the people that are a hundred percent dependent historically on the
[50:34.160 --> 50:39.960]  system as it begins to go into meltdown bankruptcy what are they gonna do some
[50:39.960 --> 50:42.800]  estimates are there's fifty something million of these people we know there's
[50:42.800 --> 50:48.680]  now 45 million on food stamps and growing you know what percentage of those are
[50:48.680 --> 50:53.880]  going to riot and burn down major cities as this situation unfolds and then you
[50:53.880 --> 50:58.400]  gotta understand the ultra rich are gonna use those folks as a threat against
[50:58.400 --> 51:02.720]  the middle class to raise taxes hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the
[51:02.720 --> 51:06.640]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[51:06.640 --> 51:10.400]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[51:10.400 --> 51:14.080]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even
[51:14.080 --> 51:17.360]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[51:17.360 --> 51:21.480]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[51:21.480 --> 51:26.840]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[51:26.840 --> 51:30.920]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the
[51:30.920 --> 51:34.840]  best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you
[51:34.840 --> 51:38.960]  actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them
[51:38.960 --> 51:43.960]  today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give
[51:43.960 --> 51:54.360]  them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis
[51:54.360 --> 51:58.440]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[51:58.440 --> 52:06.240]  survival seed bank comm Alex Jones here with key information the US government
[52:06.240 --> 52:09.920]  is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large
[52:09.920 --> 52:14.600]  amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become
[52:14.600 --> 52:19.960]  a seller of US bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing
[52:19.960 --> 52:23.560]  China by calling them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which
[52:23.560 --> 52:27.640]  is already buying about 70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer
[52:27.640 --> 52:32.000]  left of US Treasuries our friends at the National Inflation Association believe
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.680]  that the US dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the
[52:35.680 --> 52:40.000]  purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed I strongly urge my

[54:26.960 --> 54:30.640]  author of Big Brother the Orwellian nightmare come true and we're gonna
[54:30.640 --> 54:33.640]  talk about the birth certificate we're gonna talk about the plunging economy
[54:33.640 --> 54:39.880]  Facebook Google Microsoft all the different spying the government
[54:39.880 --> 54:45.800]  internet ID now we're learning Microsoft based phones are keeping data I told you
[54:45.800 --> 54:51.280]  folks in the telecommunications act of 96 that by October 1st 2001 all phones
[54:51.280 --> 54:56.200]  have the satellite tracking triangulation to the cell towers and then so
[54:56.200 --> 54:59.840]  now we learn that it's basically every phone provider out there but the drudge
[54:59.840 --> 55:07.200]  report has a link up on it to buzzfeed.com it's over on the left hand lower
[55:07.200 --> 55:12.520]  area we'll put a link to this up on info wars as well top 20 conspiracy theories
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.240]  that have already sprung up around President Obama's birth certificate and
[55:17.240 --> 55:20.760]  they're calling them conspiracy theories but they've done a good job actually
[55:20.760 --> 55:25.240]  pointing out all or many of the anomalies that we noticed last night and
[55:25.240 --> 55:28.600]  came out and said something's wrong with this thing it's a forgery it's a fraud
[55:28.600 --> 55:34.360]  or they scrambled it somehow and this is from the White House's own website it
[55:34.360 --> 55:37.680]  says the pattern background is too seamless for a document kept in a
[55:37.680 --> 55:41.880]  bound volume I don't think that's the strongest point to lead with the date
[55:41.880 --> 55:48.600]  accepted is four days later than the date of birth and that's what it appears
[55:48.600 --> 55:54.120]  to say there I hadn't even noticed that smudges in the box next to the name of
[55:54.120 --> 56:00.680]  attendant and that's certainly there MD who signed the document conveniently died
[56:00.680 --> 56:04.200]  eight years ago see I wouldn't even point stuff like that out that's not
[56:04.200 --> 56:09.560]  inclusive two mysterious X's above twin and triplet yeah there's just it's like
[56:09.560 --> 56:12.840]  it's designed to make you think it's fake that's what I said in the video we
[56:12.840 --> 56:20.240]  put out last night continuing here unexplained eight nine nine one on
[56:20.240 --> 56:30.240]  documents right side the biggest one is that it's a number as Paul Watson has
[56:30.240 --> 56:35.240]  written that doesn't match up in the sequential order of dates compared to
[56:35.240 --> 56:38.420]  those issued at the hospital that are known to be birth certificates from that
[56:38.420 --> 56:45.040]  hospital and the date the department 6 1 1 0 6 4 1 that's out of date continues
[56:45.040 --> 56:50.920]  41 at the right of document looks suspicious yeah that's what I'm saying
[56:50.920 --> 56:58.360]  it's not the same font it's in a different layer the computer shows whether
[56:58.360 --> 57:01.960]  that was done intentionally or it's so different that when you put it into
[57:01.960 --> 57:06.400]  illustrator it sees it as his different layer birth certificate of someone born
[57:06.400 --> 57:10.800]  at the same hospital a day later has a lower number that's the point Watson
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.780]  points out there is no official seal all the others from Hawaii at the same time
[57:15.780 --> 57:19.320]  have that that's been pointed out by newspapers still says certificate of
[57:19.320 --> 57:28.040]  live birth meaning that it's the certificate not the original long form
[57:28.040 --> 57:32.760]  instead of African under the father's race colored or Negro would have been
[57:32.760 --> 57:36.920]  used in 61 we've checked into that that's a fact and they've got Donald Trump's
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.760]  head there as if it's a joke I mean Donald Trump saying hey I just want to
[57:41.760 --> 57:44.760]  make sure this is real I mean how much his government lied to us in the past
[57:44.760 --> 57:48.200]  they said that the last birth certificate they put out was the only one
[57:48.200 --> 57:51.520]  and that that was the original when we knew it wasn't it was just the receipt
[57:51.520 --> 57:55.920]  see that's what I'm saying about how much they lie to us and they got an image
[57:55.920 --> 58:01.680]  of Lee Harvey Oswald they're making it a joke no footprint and they put them on
[58:01.680 --> 58:07.520]  a lease in there and then no birth weight flying saucer so basically they they go
[58:07.520 --> 58:12.480]  through a bunch of serious stuff and then they just turn it into a joke by the
[58:12.480 --> 58:17.640]  end of it under the hour of birth the M and the PM is in a different font well
[58:17.640 --> 58:23.120]  that's true so why is it a joke address for Obama's childhood home is the
[58:23.120 --> 58:29.320]  middle of a highway Hawaii's governor until recently claimed there was no birth
[58:29.320 --> 58:36.480]  certificate well that's true 20 obviously photoshopped and there you go
[58:36.480 --> 58:49.960]  folks this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:51.040 --> 58:55.880]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[58:55.880 --> 59:01.520]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[59:01.520 --> 59:05.160]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned members
[59:05.160 --> 59:10.200]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[59:10.200 --> 59:15.560]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[59:15.560 --> 59:20.480]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[59:20.480 --> 59:24.880]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[59:24.880 --> 59:28.600]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[59:28.600 --> 59:32.560]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[59:32.560 --> 59:38.200]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[59:38.200 --> 59:43.800]  Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com
[59:43.800 --> 59:48.480]  we're watching online right now in super-high quality at prison planet dot
[59:48.480 --> 01:00:00.480]  TV waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:28.200]  alex jones we've got
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.880]  our guys join us coming up the next segment to cover a cornucopia of issues
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:40.160]  Tim in Kentucky graphic artist looking at the new Obama long-form birth certificate
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:45.600]  I mean it is in different fonts and I I think that's something we need to it's
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.920]  in our articles but you probably the headlines that smoking gun some of these
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:55.240]  fonts are different and that wouldn't have in the same words what's your view
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:00.360]  on this Tim well it's not really the font they're in question because this is
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.400]  such a low-res shot a leak created document it's how it was constructed and
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.240]  not really what the written word is on the contents it's the fact that every
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:15.360]  single aspect in this document is fake and it's all low-res it's done very
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.280]  amateurish and also the fact that the White House has released this and
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.200]  actually are paunting this off as a real document on the question you have the
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.040]  green green background now you're supposed to stop counterfeiting or
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:33.400]  whatever and they went ahead and boxed the document in with more of the same
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.600]  pattern and then it doesn't even line up and in one area it hangs over it's like
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.360]  they wanted it to look fake and then to make fun of us that can see reality well
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.160]  see the whole thing about that background that I'll start out with that
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.760]  background the background is a low-res highly compressed JPEG they got it from
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:56.400]  somewhere the and when you take a low-res image and you increase the
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.480]  resolution especially on a JPEG it has compression you can do a quality your
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.240]  Photoshop guys should know this that you can go anywhere from a 1 up to a 10
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.840]  which is the highest quality but the more you compress it you get these little
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:13.840]  artifact remnants that yeah yes and if you zoom in tight on this you will see
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.560]  these little there it's not no they're everywhere and if it's an original scan
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:22.040]  it should be pretty high res but it's not saying that they shrunk the res you
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.800]  know that could have happened instead you're saying the original was small
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.560]  they blew it up yes we've noticed that yeah it's extremely lazy on their part
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.280]  and also if this is a scan document it was highly compressed every aspect of the
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.680]  whole document will have these rendering artifacts including the text oh I
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.240]  forgot that's why looking at it we were all freaking out last night we kind of
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.880]  just rushed out you know with a basic report is that the the artifacts are
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:51.040]  different sizes and different patterns that's how when Wired magazine came out
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.000]  and said that the Intel Center's logo was in the same layer as the Al Qaeda logo
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.240]  because he could see that the rendering artifacts were in the same pattern
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.120]  that's right we've had it blown up and it's all different sizes and different
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.920]  shapes of compression showing all sorts of photo shopping that's what you're
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.880]  saying is the key here correct yes I can I've been doing graphic arts for 20
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.360]  years I can tell you every single aspect of this document talk at the bottom I
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.320]  can tell you why it's doing what it is why the outlines are around it the
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.160]  shadow glows which shouldn't be there either because if this is a watermark
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.920]  document you should see it right up to the edge of any of the written content
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.840]  or printed stuff because when a form is made it's just a blank form then you
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.040]  fill it in and it should be with a type why don't you do this why don't you take
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.400]  their res because everything you're saying is what my guys have confirmed
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:47.880]  why don't you point out areas of it and with different shots of it kind of like
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:52.600]  that website earlier did but they made a joke out of it and and and show the
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.440]  different areas and blow it up yourself and send that to us then we'll of course
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.920]  check what you've done and compare it to our own system but I'd like to do an
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:05.920]  article on that to really show people but you're right it's different compression
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.040]  fields everywhere you can see the different areas that have been manipulated
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.160]  some areas don't have the compression artifacts or distortion others do
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.880]  showing it's been just absolutely gone over yeah for example if you just zoom
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.600]  in on like and on a Obama's name or Brock or Stanley or the dates you'll
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.680]  notice that a lot of numbers are there and you're saying that it's black but in
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:33.320]  actuality there's four shades of green in all these overlays what these are
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.640]  bitmap transparent bitmap overlays and when you have your monitor your guys
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.120]  need to tweak their monitor settings with a contrast and brightness I do it
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:47.000]  because I'm a graphic artist and I need to discern between forest green navy and
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.080]  black and if my monitors off I think it's all black now yeah absolutely it's
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.440]  incredible well we need to do more research on this clearly something's
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.000]  going on this thing's a forgery we just don't know exactly why this is Alex
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.600]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:08.840]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:13.120]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.120]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.440]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.800]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.560]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.480]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.200]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:50.200]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.840]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the son so go to
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:06:02.640]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 a very wealthy US citizen is predicting
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.360]  that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.280]  50 years he says it will change everything about our lives the way you
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.160]  shop travel invest educate your children and even how you take care of your health
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.760]  and your own family now this man has made some outrageous predictions of the
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:23.200]  years the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.960]  of GM Panny Mae Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.960]  growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he

[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:40.240]  available at info wars.com big brother they are welling in nightmare come true
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.320]  and and this is for people that know about 1984 but they read the book they
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.280]  see all the parallels and how in many ways we've surpassed it and I go back
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:54.080]  to our article July 20 in 2007 Paul Joseph Watson iPhone a Trojan horse for
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.000]  government surveillance backdoor spyware module allows state corporations and
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.480]  hackers to listen in to dial in and listen to you and track your location
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.800]  there we are July 20 2007 info wars.com but I've been telling you since 1996 not
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.040]  because I'm smart but because it was in the telecommunications act that they
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.760]  gave the phone companies and the manufacturers of phones five years
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.840]  until October 1st 2001 pull up the articles you know new phone new
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.640]  surveillance rules go into law today from back on October 1st 2001 and it was
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.720]  it said they can dial in and turn your phone on even when it's off it looks
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:37.080]  like it's still off listen to you the on-stars the same way they can track
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.160]  everywhere you're going and now it's out today oh it's not just Google and
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.200]  iPhone but the Google phone and the Microsoft phone system and they're all
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:49.480]  doing the same thing and then Steve Jobs comes out and says no we're not it's a
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.640]  lie even when it's admitted and then separately other Apple execs go no it's
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:58.120]  government systems and regulations I mean it's how dumb do they think we are
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.560]  it's like this new birth certificate they put out for two years of fake receipt
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.360]  saying this is it this is a long form this is it we're like no it's not where's
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.280]  the doctor signature and they're like that doesn't exist there's no such thing
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.720]  as that you're like yeah we've all got them now they go oh yeah here is a long
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.400]  form and it's in all these layers but that's not even the issue the computer
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.240]  recognizes all the forgeries as the layers in different fonts three four
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:28.240]  times darker the signatures go over the green background and you look at it in
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.640]  fields and a graphic designer just pointed this out it's one of the issues
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.440]  I hadn't even made but that was what it was the final issue for us last night
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:39.240]  when I kicked in and so that said it's a forgery was we were looking at it blown
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.520]  up on a big screen high-res TV hooked to a computer we had it totally blown up
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:49.120]  had a lights off looking at it and you can see all these different patterns of
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:56.000]  of the JPEG that had artifacts you know in videos not high res or images and it
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.960]  has all that splotchy boxes you blow it up different designs there was different
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.480]  boxes here different different fractals there and then whole areas crisp where
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.960]  they added the new stuff oh totally crisp it was high res it was the new stuff I
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:14.000]  mean it it's designed for people to freak out over it and then they just come
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.160]  out and say aha you're an idiot you know you you're making this up you're
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:24.200]  crazy it's not a forgery and Obama laughs at everybody I think this is a
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.120]  psyop to get everybody fighting with each other and actually obsess over this
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:32.360]  but then you almost have to but if you just obsess over whether it's a forgery
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.640]  or not then it's not really waking folks up but if you pull back and see the
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.160]  Psyop that's going on then it's very educational and enlightening and I'm
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.280]  ranting about a bunch of issues Mark Dyson's new book folks we need this book
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:49.960]  to go viral everywhere because it needs to be read at all the high schools the
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.880]  colleges it needs to be in all the libraries everybody should order it as
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.520]  a public service and put it in the library I know we've had libraries call
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.920]  and get it from us because I helped mark out with the printing of 10,000 of
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.600]  these and we want to get them out there to people and because folks need to
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:08.840]  understand that in the 50s or in the late 40s when this was written this was
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.200]  seen as a police state and now he parallels how it's happening and gone
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.880]  beyond and we're going to go over some of those issues but there's also the
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.440]  mind control issue of them saying there is no radiation Obama said that a month
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.280]  ago no danger in the US no problem in Japan the core exits not a health
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.600]  problem remember his clips of that no health problems in the Gulf core exits
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:34.800]  fine 40 age 52 is the average life expectancy of Exxon Valdez workers massive
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.840]  health problems deaths in the Gulf people breathe in this stuff that he just
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.840]  waves a magic wand says it's fine do you use fine this is how they're basically
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.440]  throttling us mark dice I mean what do you think they're doing here joining us
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.800]  via video Skype for Los Angeles California what do you think's happening
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.640]  with this birth certificate I have a few just two points on the birth certificate
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.400]  I think it's a Psyop I think that this is planned early on as maybe a red herring
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.560]  something to create a suspicious aura around and then to ultimately debunk it
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.800]  as a as a manufactured straw man the one point that I'd like to make about all
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.920]  this is that if Donald Trump I just wish Donald Trump would have been obsessed
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.080]  with the Bilderberg group as much as he was with the birth certificate because
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.480]  this just goes to show that if we can get a person of power and influence to
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.120]  become interested in one of these issues of the new world order and the
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.880]  birth certificate was a small issue in the overall aspect of what it is that
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.720]  we're doing but the fact that Donald Trump was able to bring this to a
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:43.480]  national and global attention shows that if we can get somebody an opinion
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:48.040]  leader an opinion shaper or someone in power to look at important issues let's
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.960]  let's look at the Bilderberg group instead of the birth certificate imagine if
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.440]  Donald Trump was creating this global media phenomenon about the Bilderberg
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.200]  group so that's that's my point is if we can push an important issue into the
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:07.080]  mainstream so let's not focus on these small issues the birth certificate it's
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.680]  interesting there's certainly some shady things there there's probably some
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.360]  obviously some information they don't want everybody to see but is that is that
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.440]  important in the overall scheme of things compared to the Bilderberg group the
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:24.240]  Orwellian nightmare these things Apple tracking our movements that's just the
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.320]  tip of the iceberg Alex later on we can get into some apps on the iPhone that
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.280]  are actually already listening to people the photos the camera in your in your
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:39.560]  iPhone is turned over to the applications and is being used in
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:43.880]  Orwellian ways and and maybe we should talk about what Orwellian is you know
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.520]  this audience is growing and people are at different levels of their
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:53.040]  understanding Orwellian is a reference to George Orwell's book 1984 where he
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:58.560]  talks about this tyrannical government yeah using control of information turning
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.120]  reality upside down confusing people training people to accept lies the general
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:09.880]  public obsessed with sports and lotteries and celebrity stuff instead of
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:17.200]  caring about all the tyranny now Orwell in his book 1984 are such a historical
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.560]  and in a significant piece of literature that that's why we have words
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.920]  like Orwellian double-speak the memory hole so what I've done with big brother
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.520]  the Orwellian nightmare is because we're seeing this unfold and I've been seeing
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:36.400]  this unfold myself for 15 years I wrote all the parallels that I could see and
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.480]  it's 300 pages of them I mean we are living in the Orwellian nightmare when
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:46.840]  Apple can just activate my cell phone and listen to me I'm not paranoid when I
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:52.120]  stick a piece of tape over the camera and microphone in my laptop five years
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.360]  ago people said I was paranoid and the guy all the government's not listening
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.760]  really really they're not let's let's look at how accurate we've been you know
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.760]  I've been doing this for five years six years Alex I think that's why you
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.960]  support me because you know that I'm not just some idiot making YouTube videos
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:11.480]  that makes fun of people you know I'd like people to know that I'm actually a
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.520]  pretty smart guy I know what I'm doing I'm trying to join this fight and do all
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.800]  I can because I'm mad I mean look at this exactly I mean look look look we
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.680]  knew five six years ago Google came out with a press release saying we've got
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.880]  apps that we turn on through the operating system or through you visiting
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.560]  Google that turn your microphone or camera on but don't worry computers are
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.880]  listening and getting keywords and then deciding what advertisement to super
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.560]  imposed on sites that you visit and that's five years ago and people called
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.520]  us nuts now two years ago now that's how old this is Philadelphia comes out and
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.040]  says yeah we've handed out thousands of laptops to kids we're watching them in
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:56.080]  the shower in bed at home and we saw a kid eating Skittles so we kicked them
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.960]  out of school and people said oh that's good the schools watching you at home
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.800]  unannounced I mean if this is already been going on this is Orwellian and so
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:10.320]  if we here's my copy of George Orwell's book 1984 and I urge everybody to to
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.680]  read it whether you read it when you were a child read it again maybe you've
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:17.960]  never read it because the parallels are so striking let me just pull up some
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.240]  random I'm just gonna turn to a random page here in this book here's a quote
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.240]  from some random page the children on the other hand were systematically turned
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.280]  against their parents and taught to spy on them and to report on their
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.240]  deviations the family had become in effect an extension of the thought
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.560]  police this was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded in a
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.080]  day and night by informers who knew them intimately this is this is the Orwellian
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:47.320]  nightmare this is why I'm in this fight this is why I wrote big brother the
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.320]  Orwellian nightmare because page after page of this fictional book is now
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.440]  becoming real the science fiction tyrannical government elements the
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.240]  science fiction technology is not just around the corner it's here they're
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.320]  using it as a handbook of control because Eric Blair aka pen named George
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.720]  Orwell had worked at every level of the imperial system the communist system and
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:15.720]  the media BBC system and he wrote essays for those that haven't read them
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:19.520]  there they're also in books nonfiction where he said this is what I believe is
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:23.800]  going to happen and then Huxley came out in 62 before he died and said no it's a
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.040]  mixture of 1984 and Brave New World it's going to be the drugging and the
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:32.720]  brainwashing and folks are going to love their servitude these the storm
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:36.440]  troopers are in the background for the few that actually wake up but expanding
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:42.480]  on that now I heard local talk radio this morning saying Miss America should
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.120]  enjoy them putting their hand in her pants and actually touching her
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:50.080]  privates and then she's on record they actually stuck the hand in the pants and
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.480]  touched her and then I heard him say go on and basically talk about how it's
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.360]  good that kids are reporting on their parents guns because some kid brought a
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.040]  gun to school they're saying it's the parents fault the point is they use that
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.520]  to say guns should be illegal I mean more and more they just take things that
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:12.320]  that even the dumbest person 20 years ago would know was tyranny and scary and
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.400]  they're saying it's like mother's milk I mean they're really pushing it on us
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.200]  I'm trying not to be an arrogant self-centered jerk because I think I'm
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.920]  fairly intelligent and I'm noticing people in the public just every day are
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.240]  getting dumber and dumber and dumber and that's why I'm in this fight that's
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.720]  why your audience is in this fight because we care we we are trying to
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:38.240]  restore the public let me draw the main source of this Orwellian

[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:10.400]  today's modern smoker coming up in a couple hours curtain
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.800]  mo is got another article coming out proving that all these varying digital
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:21.120]  artifacts show that photoshopping massive ultrasound alterations have been
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:25.840]  done to whatever this birth certificate is okay that's a big deal and they did
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.080]  it where it's very obvious and I agree with Mark Dij's it's meant to be a
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:34.920]  Psyop but we're gonna expand with the added dimension of the fact that it is a
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:39.720]  Psyop that's gonna be up on info wars.com and prison planet.com because
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:46.140]  the fight's on drudge has had us double-linked with our TSA molesting
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:51.840]  miss america and we're gonna be going over that a little bit later and then
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.880]  also our report dealing with the forgery and now I guess to be balanced he's
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.720]  he's kind of linked to some of the others that are resisting that and
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.000]  saying it's not true but the point is this is serious and we're in the fight
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.920]  and we're gonna show the full spectrum of how this is a fraud talking to Mark
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.920]  Dij's joining us via video Skype from his home in Los Angeles the book is
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.120]  big brother there well your nightmare come true 1495 absolute page Turner so
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.960]  much information the full spectrum of the big brother nightmare or well your
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:30.520]  nightmare coming true you can also get it with American conspiracies or you can
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:34.880]  get it with Jesse Ventura's 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.320]  and then get one of my best-selling DVD films or the films I produced
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:45.240]  absolutely free with it but again support alternative information and media
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.240]  and warn everyone you know so before I went to break mark you were getting to
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:54.920]  the heart of it how they use the fake terror the threat of the outsider as the
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.240]  pretext to bring in tyranny and oppression in the name of keeping us
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.240]  safe this is the heart of the issue though the source of really one of the
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.640]  sources of their power so let's draw this major parallel between the storyline
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:14.640]  in 1984 and what we're experiencing in our world today the bad guy in 1984 was
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:20.480]  a guy named Emmanuel Goldstein who was the man behind all terrorist activities
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.880]  fighting the government and fighting the party and you come to learn that he
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.480]  might not even be alive anymore and he's a fictional perpetual creation of the
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.200]  government and he's the face of all terrorism all any disrespect against the
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:40.320]  government is because of him and his teachings in his secretive network
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:45.800]  similar practically identical to what we have with Osama bin Laden today who's in
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.920]  my opinion been dead for many many years now he is the fictional now
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:56.720]  perpetual Osama bin Elvis bogeyman who's most likely been dead for years but
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:01.000]  this is the establishment the military over the last ten years since the 911
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.440]  attacks have happened is yet to admit this because they need him to point as
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:12.920]  the face of fear he is the sole mastermind behind all terrorism and if
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.560]  the government were to admit that he's probably died of natural causes years
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:20.600]  ago it would it would seem like a victory and and the war on terrorism
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.640]  maybe wouldn't need to continue but the fact that he's out there hiding in the
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:32.120]  caves and and releasing videotapes supposedly it's exactly the same in 1984
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.680]  Emmanuel Goldstein with the turban with a beard doing the exact same thing from
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.560]  a cave yeah he is he is this supposed mastermind I mean I guess Osama bin
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:46.040]  Laden was probably behind a liquor store robbery you know downtown last night I
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:50.360]  mean it's once you start to understand this it it becomes very clear it's
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:54.000]  incredible the books almost like prophecy he talks about no one you know
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  knows where Emmanuel is is he in the sewers he's almost omnipresent he just
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.480]  we've got to give all our rides up though and then he starts questioning who's
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.320]  launching these rocket bombs against us more and more he understands its big
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.800]  brother itself to keep the fear up yeah Winston Smith the main character in the
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:16.840]  book his girlfriend Julia starts to talk out loud whether the bombs being
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:21.440]  dropped on London are from the government themselves to perpetuate the
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.840]  fear now again this is what George Orville wrote in 1949 and and I don't
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:31.440]  like to draw parallels between fiction and and what's going on in in our
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.760]  current world but but we have to with 1984 because his book was so
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:41.920]  significant and and he he predicted to a T what is happening today and it's a
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:45.440]  way for all of us to articulate and understand what what is happening and I
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.960]  know that your audience is in different levels of their understanding and that's
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:54.320]  why I want to urge people and and ask them to to buy my book because you can
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:58.960]  sit at your computer like I have for the last six years I've been sitting and
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.480]  researching and you know I had major back problems and I've been seated a
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:06.720]  chiropractor but from sitting in it so get away from your computer you don't
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.520]  get a book and get away and get out and go sit outside in a chair and get some
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.600]  sun and educate yourself just just step back that's that's what I like what
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.520]  you said at the beginning of the interview that you're angry you've got
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.240]  a beef you don't want these con artists to win you're tired of seeing them get
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:29.920]  away with this ridiculous corruption that's so brazen it's clearly Orwellian
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:36.080]  and they're using this book as a template for what they're doing and by
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:40.240]  the way again Aldous Huxley who wrote Brave New World he went on and said no
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:45.520]  my book written in 32 about genetic engineering drugging the public this is
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:48.440]  what we actually plan to do and his brother of course later headed up the
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:56.040]  UN UNESCO program we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.640]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:12.960]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:16.920]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:21.280]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:25.600]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:29.360]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.480]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:37.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:41.280]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.000]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.440]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:17.800]  by the way mark dice is in San Diego the guys went out there to interview him a
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:21.480]  year ago for one of the films and we just see the whole area is LA all of
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:30.520]  California's LA mark dice is our guest I want to get into the way the system
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:36.200]  rolls this stuff out in a ubiquitous way where it's engineered into everything
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.920]  and face scanning cameras are up and license plate readers and I tell people
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:44.520]  about license plate readers 15 years ago from trade publications I was reading
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.240]  and folks would laugh at me but then as soon as it's admitted they go okay big
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.960]  deal schools are watching kids at home in California and Pennsylvania okay the
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:57.360]  government's tracking everything I do okay Apple's doing it okay Google's
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:03.000]  doing it Microsoft phones are doing it the point is it's all there and even the
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.840]  mainstream media can't even do the basic research to figure that out mark they
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:13.960]  just dole the information out to the public continue with the book and
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:20.200]  continue with parallels from 1984 with your book that that goes through the
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:25.040]  fact that we are in many ways surpassing the Orwellian control grid we
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.880]  just haven't gotten to the mass arrest and executions and torture chambers
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:32.680]  though they're trying to get there the government saying that they can
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:37.960]  assassinate you US citizens and not tell anybody try you or torture you in
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:42.280]  front of secret military tribunals we've got to have checkpoints to stop
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:46.520]  illegal drugs but then it comes out the top banks are laundering the money and
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:52.480]  the CIA's bringing it in I mean it's all Orwellian it's Orwellian and we have a
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:58.000]  level of elite that is super educated and intelligent and most of the public
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.760]  are getting stupider and stupider every moment of this is one of the parallels
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:06.960]  the educational system in 1984 the control of information the social
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:13.640]  structure the perpetuation of war the personification of the party all of
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:17.600]  these parallels let's just continue a little bit with the with the fear-based
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:24.240]  parallel and the Immanuel Goldstein and Osama bin Laden parallel in 1984
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:27.840]  there the perpetual war there was a war that was going on obviously that was
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:32.440]  the reason for everybody having to give up their rights and for having to work
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:37.240]  longer hours work for less rations sounding familiar everybody seems like
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:41.840]  our lives today but the war the enemy some people are familiar with this some
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.120]  people aren't I just kept changing at first they were at war with Oceania and
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:50.760]  then they were at war with Eurasia and and they were always at war the public
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:55.000]  thought with whatever country or a region they were at war with at the time
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.800]  that the public were so so uneducated so ignorant so distracted that they
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:05.280]  couldn't tell when the enemy that they were fighting changed sort of like our
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:10.240]  own world today what wait a minute what what what we're fighting Afghanistan
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:16.280]  Pakistan Iraq I know what who is this could off he was our enemy that six
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:21.320]  years ago he was a friend Al Qaeda was the good guys in the 80s then are the
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:25.680]  bad guys now al Qaeda fighting Qaddafi or the good guys again and then when you
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.600]  start to look at this it becomes so scary and confusing that people would
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.080]  rather just turn on the entertainment tonight channel that's key they're
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:36.720]  doing it they're being confusing and putting out conflicting things just
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.480]  getting folks to get flustered and turn away yeah just it's sort of like a rat
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.200]  in a cage if you just start buzzing it it's it's it's just gonna scour in a
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:50.280]  corner it this doesn't matter once you start beating an animal I mean it's
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:53.760]  gonna go into submission and so no we're not gonna go to submission and you
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.440]  know that's why I'm I'm getting I'm getting angry here because the things
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:02.040]  that I've been talking about for six years aren't aren't now just gonna come
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:06.880]  they're here I mean I have a cell phone now that can listen to me wherever
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.440]  wherever it wants to when it's off this is the Aurelian nightmare and what are
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:15.280]  the social implications of this and then what's coming next what's coming in the
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.520]  next two or three years and that is why it's critically important that that us
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:25.560]  this audience be educated stop being afraid of this Osama bin Elvis and you
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:30.680]  know every time they start saying oh pushing their agenda we just need to
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:34.920]  push it back and say no oh wait who Osama bin Elvis he's but where is this
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:41.160]  guy you know I called into the Adam Corolla radio show a week ago and I
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:45.240]  got him and Morgan Spurlock to admit Morgan Spurlock the producer of Where
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:48.160]  in the World is Osama bin Laden supersize me all these films so they
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.680]  admitted because I opposed the question hey where in the world is Osama bin
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:57.240]  Laden isn't isn't he dead isn't aren't they just perpetuating this myth and
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:02.160]  and years ago Alex you know I think I used to do this a lot to Sean Hannity to
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:08.960]  all these main shows to challenge the this mainstream establishment on the
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.360]  lies and the agenda the narrative that they're pushing so years ago I would do
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.200]  this and I would be ridiculed you can find these calls on on YouTube and on
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.320]  the on the internet and now here just last week Morgan Spurlock and Adam
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:26.960]  Corolla admitted instead of me being attacked they said oh yeah it sounds good
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:30.320]  to me you're probably right let's go further let's go further I'm on big
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.880]  conservative radio shows now and they're having to admit Alex you're right it's
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:40.000]  in Fox News and we're all a lucky number two under bin Laden they're now the
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  Washington Post said he is basically the commander he may be number one now he's
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.720]  born into Mexico trained in the US admittedly runs the underwear bomber the
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:54.280]  Fort Hood shooter the Times Square of the shoe bomber meeting secretly at the
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:59.640]  Pentagon while he's most wanted meeting secretly with the Secretary of the Army
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:05.520]  and being protected now it comes out major British news yes top Al Qaeda in
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:13.040]  Pakistan attacking US Pakistani forces is British intelligence yes a SWAT the
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:18.160]  head of the 7-7 is British MI 6 I mean now more and more they don't even care
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:23.280]  they just come out and admit that these guys are working for them and their
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:26.600]  foot soldiers don't even know who they're working for just like our soldiers
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:31.120]  don't know the same globalist are financing both sides I mean it is
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:36.480]  beyond Orwellian and let's let's be clear and we're all a lucky this one of
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:42.800]  the top Al Qaeda leaders has a master's degree in educational leadership from
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:47.240]  San Diego State University that's my backyard okay so wait a minute this is
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:50.760]  the Orwellian nightmare why don't they talk about this on the news well because
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:55.240]  the news is obviously controlled through Operation Mockingbird and issues like
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:00.440]  that you know people your audience may be new to this some people may be you
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.920]  know still skeptical of the kinds of information that you're talking about and
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.360]  so that's why I think I'm pretty confident now Alex and I thank you for
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:13.080]  your support because for the last six years I've been doing this and now now
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:17.080]  we have people in the mainstream that aren't making fun of us anymore they
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:20.920]  are admitting that we're right and so if we're right about these issues in the
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.920]  past from four or five years ago then now everyone is reluctantly agreeing with
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.800]  us on what else are we right about you know so that's why I want to thank you
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:33.880]  Alex thank your audience and and and I know I know what I'm talking about well
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.880]  how do we know this how you know how do we how do we know this because I don't
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:40.640]  watch eight hours of television a day because I read books you to see you
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.720]  maybe see my Skype call just a fraction of the books that I have because I'm a
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:47.880]  big nerd you know that's all I want people to know people who've seen my
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:51.360]  funny YouTube videos I go out and make fun of people I'm not just the class
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:56.600]  clown you know of the of the movement I'm a pretty smart guy so we understand
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.440]  that mark and you certainly are effective and it's good to go out and try
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:06.960]  to buy a $1 taco taco bell with at the time a $1,200 coin that happened a few
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.080]  months ago now it's 1500 plus and have her refuse the one ounce gold American
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:18.800]  Eagle you know now over $1,500 just to illustrate I don't think that's
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.480]  clowning at all you're illustrating absurdity by being absurd and knowledge
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:31.160]  is is power and and and people need to start researching our claims not just go
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:36.560]  off of what we're saying I mean let's go back to Ron Paul 35 years ago giving
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.240]  speeches traveling around talking about dollar devaluation and fractional
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:46.560]  reserve banking or G. Edward Griffin 50 years ago or 50 plus years ago red
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:51.640]  Beckman or 50 years ago Bob Chapman or myself 16 years ago sticking our neck
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:55.840]  out and going over this now just a year ago they were still saying there is no
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:00.960]  inflation QE to isn't bad now they admit yes it's causing inflation again the
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:05.480]  Congress has I was corrected last week I said an 11% approval rating and I
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.920]  was in an email of Reuters article saying it's now a 9% in fact guys let's
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:13.640]  show folks Congress now is a 9% approval rating let's search that and show
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:17.440]  prisonplanet.tv viewers if you're a radio listener I get emails about this
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:20.960]  and see comments because I don't plug it a lot you're like what are you saying you
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:26.160]  put it on screen this is a radio show yes I'd say 90 plus percent of the people
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:30.360]  that hear this show are listening to AM and FM global shortwave satellite or
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:35.000]  internet streams we're also streaming video we're archiving video at
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:41.600]  prisonplanet.tv it's 15 since today 595 a month I would give it away free but
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.680]  obviously we can't finance that you get it first at prisonplanet.tv then we
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:49.560]  post most of it at the YouTube channel one of our YouTube channels now over
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.920]  101 million views on that channel total at the official Alex Jones channel this
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.400]  live stream will also be posted there later today but complete commercial free
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:05.800]  also a podcast at prisonplanet.tv and we are the alternative media we're on
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:10.920]  the tip of the spear it is daunting to always be in the arena to get the
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.960]  criticism to get the attacks but we don't have a future and I have three
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:20.120]  wonderful children I have a wonderful wife I love my parents I love my 86
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:25.320]  87 year old grandmother my last living grandparent there it is Congress
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:31.680]  approves approval plunges to 9% first time ever rating for lawmakers sinks to
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:37.680]  single digits and that was 2008 but that number was also out last week's
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:40.440]  maybe we can find it in the news section good job finding that that's
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:46.780]  WorldNet daily again like to be a part of this fight here the resistance the
[01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:51.240]  patriot movement the Tea Party you know what we're about love and respect and
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:55.280]  treating people with the dignity that they deserve and here's another quote
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.360]  from from Orwell's book if he were allowed talking about the average
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:03.840]  citizen if he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:07.760]  were creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:13.600]  about them is lies so it's just another parallel Orwell's showing that the
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.560]  governments of most countries are going to tell the population lies about the
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:24.080]  supposed enemies if I draw the parallel of in the Orwellian nightmare I talk
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.600]  about this documentary film Rick Steve's Iran he's a PBS documentary he's one of
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.680]  only two journalists I think American journalists allowed in Iran and he
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:37.760]  talked to average Iranian citizens and they're just like me and you there they
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:41.200]  just want to have a good life they want to have friends and family they say
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.840]  Cameron looks like basically Chicago it's a beautiful city and they're just
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.240]  like us they know that their government and their officials are criminal and
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:54.640]  and or an organized criminal mafias are running it just like over here so you
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:59.320]  know that's part of this show is to enlighten ourselves into the truth and
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:02.160]  so that we can change ourselves and become more loving people because
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:06.360]  that's what the system wants you to do is to hate the Iranians and the Syrians
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:11.080]  oh they're all all evil and you hear these morons to to go and say that we
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:15.240]  should we should turn the Middle East into a party like stereotypes I mean they
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:19.680]  want the stereotype of Iran they're all want a murderous or the stereotype of
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.640]  Israel you know that they all have one view of the stereotype of Americans I
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:26.920]  mean I've had Europeans I've talked to come to Texas and they think I thought
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.840]  there were tumbleweeds and cows everywhere and that's the state's so big
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.320]  I mean that is what it's like on its western side but you know they see big
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:38.960]  tall trees and rolling hills and you know beautiful lakes and you know people
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.760]  driving cars and knowing how to use computers and they're actually blown
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.520]  away New Yorkers come here most of them that I talked to believing that it's
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.760]  literally John Wayne Wild Wild West you know that's Hollywood sure you can go
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:56.280]  out to the boondocks and see folks you know roping cows and stuff and it's
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:01.160]  great and you know farmers and people the point is we're all human beings we
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:05.600]  want the same thing for our families we want dignity we want honor we want
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:09.040]  private property now let's get into some more quotes from the book and then
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:13.880]  parallel it from 1984 to your book that's an incredible read big brother
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.200]  there are well in a nightmare come true by mark dies again available at info
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:21.160]  wars.com look at this just another random quote that I've highlighted from my
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:26.240]  personal copy of 1984 as for sending a letter through the mail it was out of
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.880]  the question by routine it was not even secret all letters were opened in
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.160]  transit so I mean just again pair a wireless email tracking warrantless
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:40.880]  email. By the way since 9-11 they now admit they open mail to make sure there's
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:46.480]  not drugs in it but they're really reading it. Right here porno sec the
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:50.600]  subset the subsection of the fiction department which turned out cheap
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:56.120]  pornography for distribution. To degrade humanity start over. Yeah so here's a
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:01.280]  quote about there was a section in the government called porno sec and this was
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:06.680]  the government's creating pornography for the people in order to destroy their
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:10.600]  relationships in order to break up the families and this is this is what we have
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.720]  this is what the Illuminati Elite does that's why they're you look at the
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.760]  garbage on television you look at when I was a kid not that long ago I'm 33 years
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:23.800]  old I grew up on quality shows like family ties and look at this garbage that
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:28.880]  you see. By the way it's not just you know they sell it like it's fun it's sexy
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:32.760]  you're missing out on something all the major studies show that after you watch
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:37.640]  a lot of porn it actually lowers your sex drive actually makes you not
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:43.840]  attracted you know as much or involved it it it basically burns you out and
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:49.960]  and actually stunts you towards real enjoyment and and you know with your
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:55.520]  mate and they know what they're doing I mean it literally creates a facsimile of
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:00.960]  the real thing and is being done as a weapon system. Let me just rapid fire
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:04.560]  just a few of the pages that I have highlighted here in my book and I just
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:09.320]  think they'll resonate with with people the tales of Goldstein this is the the
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:14.360]  enemy in the book and his underground army she said that this is Julia the
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:19.720]  girlfriend were simply a lot of rubbish which the party had invented for its
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.440]  own purposes. Gee seems a lot like Osama bin Laden. Governor Ridge admitted they put
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:28.280]  out fake terror alert sorry go ahead. Let's see here's another just random
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.600]  random highlight here they could be made the public could be made to accept the
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:36.880]  most flagrant violations of reality because they never fully grasped the
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:40.880]  enormity of what was demanded of them and they were not sufficiently interested
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:45.480]  in public events to notice what was happening. The lack of understanding by
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:51.000]  lack of understanding they remained sane. No by lack of understanding we
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.880]  remain destroyed and so this just keeps going on and on and you know I want to
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.120]  just ask people maybe I don't promote my book enough you know I think that
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:05.960]  everybody should get off the computer and I think you can save yourself the
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:09.640]  hundreds of hours of web surfing by reading a book you know and that's why
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:13.240]  I have behind me some of my favorite books about the New World Order and the
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.000]  Illuminati of hundreds of books that I read I love sitting outside and in the
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.120]  nature and in reading and studying get away from the computer and that's
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:24.680]  that's that's part of my point here another quote the brotherhood that's
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:29.120]  the kind of the resistance cannot be wiped out because it is not an
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:33.120]  organization in the ordinary sense so that that's us you know we're the
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:36.840]  resistance we can't be wiped out we're not an organization in the traditional
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:41.600]  sense and we're on the verge of really being able to topple these scum I mean
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:44.360]  look at what we're doing now we're bypassing the mainstream media everybody
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:48.520]  was a cell phone with a video camera can put it on YouTube Luke Radowski is
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:53.360]  confronting all these scum we got Gary Franchi doing his own video shows I mean
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.520]  look at we're replacing these scum and we're getting very close to I think the
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:01.880]  revolution but it's also very dangerous because they could pull their
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:06.240]  population reduction they could pull a false flag attack and really really
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.880]  try to demonize us but I think we're getting close I mean look at what we're
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:14.280]  doing look at what we were capable of delivering the knockout punch and
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:18.840]  by the way we say we're close to winning that's people who love liberty who
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:24.440]  value the truth who value dignity and sovereignty and not being a slave people
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:31.560]  who value reality more and more the alternative media is just surging and
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.240]  growing and the mainstream system is losing all credibility mark I want to
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:40.040]  get in the final segment with you into more from your book because there's just
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.600]  so much in here where it just goes through all the different ways you're

[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:10.200]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more

[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:17.680]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:21.240]  our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of

[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:15.120]  his new video Skype connection from there in his living room again I was very
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.400]  excited to help Mark print these books he's always done it on demand with his
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.840]  other great titles that he's written we also carry those in info wars.com it's
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:28.120]  just adds such a great expense so I went ahead and printed these up for him so
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:34.480]  that he could you know expand out into the future and I just think it's a great
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:38.360]  book everybody should get it and you can get it with 63 documents the government
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.800]  doesn't want you to read by Jesse Ventura another excellent book and when
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:45.600]  you get it with the book you can get one of my best-selling films a whole bunch
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:49.880]  of titles you can pick which one you want absolutely free on top of it or get
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:54.600]  the book alone at info wars.com and support alternative media and what
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.960]  we're doing mark in closing your book again parallels 1984 but goes way
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:04.520]  beyond and shows what's coming next you kind of alluded to that earlier but get
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:09.040]  into some of the areas that you break down in the book well there's systems
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:11.960]  that have been tested for years and they're talking about putting them on
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.280]  the streets of London for the Olympics in 2012 that listened to everyone on
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:23.320]  the street and they analyze the sound patterns using eight different
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:27.120]  characteristics from a hundred yards away these microphones are just on top
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:32.680]  of buildings and if you yell at someone or if the computers detect anger in your
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:37.640]  speech or if the pitch is too fast if it's too loud it can just detect this
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:41.600]  aren't they already testing those I think that's already tested them yeah it's in
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.040]  hall and they've tested it they've dispatched them and they've already been
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:48.800]  used if they've made arrests from them so there the company is trying to pitch
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.200]  that to London to the city of London have them put on the streets to keep the
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.680]  city safe for the Olympics now let me just let me just say this we we we know
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:02.200]  that there's the case of the computers laptop computers in Pennsylvania watching
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:07.720]  the students and we're talking now about the lapel watching us the locations of
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:10.840]  where we're going I don't know if a lot of people know this but there are already
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:16.160]  apps out available in the app store for iPhone and Android that use the
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:21.520]  microphone and your camera in your cell phone and listen to you and it can
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:26.200]  determine whether you're inside or outside or can determine there are
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:31.440]  certain stores now that are putting out sounds emitting sounds in the store and
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.920]  then if you have an app that you authorize the app to have access to your
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:39.120]  microphone at all times on your cell phone so when you walk into the store
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:44.160]  your microphone is active it detects that you're in the store and can log you
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.560]  in that way so you're there are already apps on your phone or or any app store
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:57.400]  that use your microphone and the camera in your cell phone to listen to you at
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:02.280]  all times it's already happening now and they roll it out as oh it's an app but
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.880]  the phone set up to do that and they've all got back doors on record for the
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:12.640]  government or private industry to dial right into it there is an app for the
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:17.680]  phones for the iPhone or the Android that's a it's it's an alarm clock app
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:23.880]  and it listens to you sleeping and if it detects you rustling in your sleep or if
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:28.400]  it's if it hears that you're you're already in the stages of waking up then
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:32.560]  it then it will wake you up at the appropriate time if you are not if
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:37.960]  you're sound asleep it won't wake you up it has these different detections to
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:42.240]  wake you up this is globalist tracker systems where the phone becomes this
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:46.440]  guardian devil not guardian angel surveilling you and they're coming out
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:49.760]  with now old folks homes in the u.s. where the government gives them extra
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:53.920]  money if they'll have smart fridges that watch what they're eating that have
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:58.480]  RFID in the toilet that tracks that you're taking your pills again

[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:06.840]  Reserve is doing you are a terrorist and he goes on to imply the Congress that
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:11.160]  half the Congress who are quote nuts might have to be rounded up it's very
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:17.280]  weird so really an open threat remember Paulson who came after O'Neill under
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:22.960]  Bush Paulson Henry Paulson threatened martial law people said well he met
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:25.560]  martial law would happen no I've interviewed the Congressman they
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:29.240]  threatened martial law these bankers think they run this country it's a
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:35.160]  legitimate Mark Dice finishing up with more quotes from 1984 and and there's
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:38.600]  other things I saw two years ago like 20 plus thousand families a year and a
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:42.920]  pilot program when they have a new baby in England not because they have any
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:46.480]  background of abuse cameras are put in the home for the first few months to
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:51.240]  make sure they're not abusers meanwhile the state on average is five times more
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:56.680]  abusive than parents statistically I mean it's incredible there is an amber
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.560]  alert GPS system now about the size of a silver dollar that parents are
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.040]  implanting on their child not in not in the child not in under the skin yet but
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:09.160]  just in their pocket on their person and it's a GPS tracker with a microphone
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:13.440]  with all sorts of creepy Orwellian applications so just imagine you have a
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:16.560]  little child now and the parent can on their cell phone just activate the
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:21.400]  amber alert GPS and listen to the child see where they're at on the on the
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:26.080]  website advertising this Orwellian device it says it's great for teenagers
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:30.400]  and you can set it so that you can put it in your teenager's car they're
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:35.480]  advertising and if this speed goes over whatever mileage you set say 70 miles
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:40.560]  an hour it will give a text message to the parent as to the speed the location
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:45.680]  meanwhile the hood at transportation others admit Europe is saying this they
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:49.640]  want government to do this to everybody very soon so we're being trained
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:54.560]  through the parents do their kids and pretty soon it's done to everybody where
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:58.560]  you where you're not good because you're good and are honorable you're good
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:04.640]  because I'm spying on you and this goes back to the source of their power one of
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:08.200]  the sources is really the unlimited money supply in the financial reserve it's a
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:11.440]  whole of different issue but one of the major sources of their power is the
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:18.000]  fear is the Osama bin Elvis fear-based system and so it's time I'm not afraid
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:23.120]  and I haven't been afraid for years of al-Qaeda and at this point I'm not
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.920]  really even afraid of my government I was more afraid of the government at one
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:31.280]  point and now I just really have no fear and it's time to I'm gonna just
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:36.040]  ridicule these scumbags at every chance that I get and I have some ideas for
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:40.600]  some things I'm gonna be implementing some jams as I call them to just show
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:46.560]  that big brother is not my god and I'm not afraid of Osama bin Elvis around
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:53.280]  the corner directing his mysterious bogeyman and this is so ridiculous and
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:57.920]  and now I'm able to articulate this because I've been studying this for a
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:01.720]  long time so you're doing a great job and and so many other great people out

[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:30.680]  important information we're going to be covering but in line of what I've heard
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:36.720]  yesterday today on national and local talk radio just amazing how drudge
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:41.200]  report.com can set the media agenda curtain demo yesterday morning wrote an
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:47.440]  article with the headline miss USA sexually molested by TSA and he goes
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:51.960]  on to point out here we've had district attorneys on who say that when they stick
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:56.040]  their hands in your pants it's a felony swarm peace officer can't do that unless
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:00.600]  you just put a gun in there and there's an emergency probable cause it's a
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:07.120]  felony on the outside of they press or even touch it's a misdemeanor and I
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:11.520]  mean you've seen the cases out there cops that go too far and get indicted
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:17.160]  now the feds are just trying to set the precedent outside of law by the
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:23.320]  political action that they can just get away with this and do this but listening
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:31.240]  to talk radio I hear these sycophantic bootlicking servile people making
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:35.400]  excuses for it all the state police in this state matter grabbing your cell
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:39.080]  phone they pull you over and plugging it in and taking all your data or oh they
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:42.400]  got wireless systems that are doing in there oh the government's tracking you
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:46.960]  but if they need to without warrants you know keep us safe or yeah the banks are
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:51.160]  laundering the drug money but ah the drug war is fair and good I hear these
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:58.160]  excuses being made for the system but then last night this morning I heard
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:04.120]  local host and national host as I scan through the stations defending going hey
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:08.040]  it's fine that they grabbed your genitals it's fine that they pressed and quote
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:15.400]  probed it's fine they go in people's pants in the pants and they don't change
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:19.480]  their gloves you take your shoes off you walk to the athletes foot stuff the
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:22.480]  government tries to make you be all scared of germs until they're spreading
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:27.560]  them flesh-eating bacteria you name it have been spread it's on record and they
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:30.640]  were making excuses for this saying well because of the terrorists we've all got
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:34.640]  to lose our rights now they didn't know America works just cuz somebody uses a
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:38.480]  gun and a crime doesn't mean I lose my second amendment by the way the
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:41.680]  criminals are always gonna just violate the law I heard this local host doing
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:45.040]  that when we got to get rid of guns cuz they're dangerous and I'm scared and
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:48.480]  people got these concealed carries statistically your car is the most
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:53.800]  dangerous thing buddy and statistically what is it seven out of ten times people
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:57.400]  with guns are frustrating the crime 30% of the time the guns being used in the
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:02.520]  crime the point is that that they're selling this idea like communist Russia
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:06.440]  that one person does something wrong on the block you all get punished that's
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:11.680]  not how liberty works plus historically you give power to the corrupt system it
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:15.240]  will abuse you every time it's the big threat you should be afraid of your
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:19.120]  government love your country for your government this is common sense but I
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:23.680]  I I hear these people defending and saying oh she shouldn't be crying she
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:28.800]  starts crying happened in Dallas she didn't want to go in the roaster the
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:32.560]  body scanner which they had make and give you cancer top doctors are on record
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:37.000]  and it's much higher levels and they first claim of radiation and so they
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.040]  were gonna grope her and I noticed in our info wars.com article that had
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:46.320]  close to 400 comments and this happens every time it gets on national news or
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:50.200]  linked at drudge same thing with our YouTube videos you will see these cut
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:55.640]  and paste comments by people on YouTube and you go look at their profiles a lot
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:59.200]  of them are admitted TSA and it's come out that people who were against the
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:04.960]  Gulf oil spill had BP people attacking them online or people against the Army
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:08.920]  Corps of Engineers it came out criticizing them in New Orleans had Army Corps
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:12.640]  of Engineers swarming them and attacking them on payroll and the government
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:15.880]  admittedly has sent com doing it and paid bloggers the point is that's
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:21.280]  happening at info wars.com that's the same thing well you should have let us
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:24.880]  scan you if you didn't like being groped oh no the TSA is saying they want to
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:28.480]  make everybody be scanned and be groped and when I've been in airports and
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:32.600]  watched it they scan you and then grop you so see they love to have that you
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:37.200]  know that statement like well you didn't let us scan you so no it's either
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:45.320]  microwave or it's the groping and it's men grabbing little girls little kids
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:49.120]  women doing it it's so disgusting you've all seen it and first last year they
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:53.440]  tried to deny they were sticking hands down pants but until the video came out
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:57.000]  member Michelle was talking about that and people didn't believe it they were
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.800]  trying to you know basically molester one-year-old, eight-year-old they had a
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:05.040]  man doing it until she said no oh how dare her and now they admit they try to
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:08.880]  put on a terror list when you say no no you're the terrorist they're breaking
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:12.800]  our will getting our space then get away with this the sky's the limit and I
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:17.880]  read these comments in the Miss USA sexually molested by TSA article by
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:22.000]  Curt Nimmo you should go in there and counter these guys and there are again
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.280]  close to 400 comments as of this morning and it says oh my gosh get over it we
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:31.860]  need to be checked for all the bad people that ruin it for everybody else is a
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:39.400]  classic TSA thing this is by Clyde 07 Dale this is the way it goes just like
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:43.080]  everything in the world so because somebody might use a gun in a crime I
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:46.920]  have to lose my guns or because somebody might spank their kids the state has to
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:53.240]  take all the kids or because I mean it's incredible I'm sure you did not get
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:57.480]  molested as you explain oh no because you say it isn't when you stick your
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:01.360]  hands in somebody's pants if you would do the scanner it would have been much
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:08.480]  easier and I out for you big deal they see your body we were born they could get

[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:20.840]  proven in double-blind studies using low doses of Allison greatly reduces the
[02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:25.240]  number severity and duration of common colds our powerful Ali see contains
[02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:30.360]  300 milligrams of stabilized Allison just one tablet of Ali see is equivalent to

[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:40.240]  well back but popular demand is fellow GCN radio host pharmacist Ben Fuchs for
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:47.280]  the rest of the hour today and watch info wars.com and prison planet.com we're
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:51.640]  gonna have a detailed analysis of this birth certificate that is fake so fake
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:56.640]  they clearly put it out to to to cause the controversy and to cause this to be
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:03.400]  the issue again we can see in the Photoshop fields different digital
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:06.920]  artifacts and then areas where there are no artifacts showing it's been heavily
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:11.280]  altered that's a hundred percent when you blow it up and areas have digital
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:14.480]  artifacts everywhere from low res and then areas that have been doctored or
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:19.600]  high res they did a very sloppy job on purpose you can look with the eye and see
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:25.280]  the fonts are different in many areas this is incredible and it's so they can
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:30.280]  call us conspiracy theorist when we don't I mean it's it's I want to talk to
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:34.480]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs about because you know he's a guy trained by the main line
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:39.880]  system who witnessed this for himself and oh by the way I wanted to bring Ted
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:45.000]  Anderson back I'm twisting his arm to talk about his family because he listened
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.480]  to pharmacist Ben Fuchs who's been on I don't know for a year or so on Genesis
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:53.600]  with his dad who has Alzheimer's and Ted agreed to do it and I talked to Ted he's
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:56.760]  always with his dad routinely tries to take him fishing and stuff his dad was
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:01.800]  getting the point where didn't even really know who people were and I want to
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:06.320]  get Dr. Blalock back on brain surgeon he talked about here on the year how
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:10.720]  statins attack the brain because they're made up of cholesterol the brain is how
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:16.480]  not having enough minerals is linked to it but side issue this is not
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:22.640]  placebo Ted started giving full-spectrum minerals liquid minerals the
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:25.800]  tangy tangerine that I and my wife started taking a few months ago to his
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:30.520]  dad and his dad has short-term memory back and a bunch of others he used to
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:34.600]  have sores on his skin his skin he bumped the wall it would you know rip you know
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:39.160]  how old folks are now that's not happening it's so incredible that
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:42.880]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs and others break down the fact that I knew this working
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:47.280]  for large animal vets you know back when I was in high school even back to junior
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:51.120]  high on the summer that they were obsessed with vitamins and minerals for
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:57.520]  cows and horses and of course Dr. Joel Wallach is a famous veterinarian in his
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:02.200]  own right and zoologist who worked at major zoos that's how he really
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:05.560]  discovered this for himself but I'm already getting off the reservation and
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:09.920]  we're almost even out of time with our guest it's just so incredible the fact
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:15.160]  that we are under such amazing mineral and vitamin deficiency and just as a
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:18.880]  side issue what do you make about what happened with with Ted Anderson's dad
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:26.360]  with the Alzheimer's Alex yes sir okay well here's the thing Alex we are
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:30.680]  suffering from the signs of nutritional deficiency not diseases we're told that
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:34.080]  we're sick we're told that there are diseases that are numbering in them in
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.280]  the tens of thousands World Health Organization has a list of 12,000 plus
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:42.640]  what they call disease categories and what I've witnessed over the last 25 plus
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.800]  years of practicing a pharmacy and alternative pharmacy and alternative
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:50.600]  medicine is that we're not sick or starving nothing demonstrates that more
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:54.280]  clearly than the experience the Ted had with Alzheimer's disease the brain is
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:58.640]  firing out rapid chemistry at a rapid clip so it will exhibit nutritional
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:02.760]  deficiencies very fast and it will exhibit healing by supplementing with
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:06.760]  nutritional supplements just as rapidly not only that but the nutrients that the
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:11.160]  brain needs are specifically the B complex and essential fatty acids as
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:14.880]  well as minerals and these are nutrients that are not found in food and that are
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:19.080]  excreted rapidly the good news is is that once you start a nutritional
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:22.960]  nutritional supplement program what Ted witnessed is something that I've seen
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:28.680]  over and over and over again we heal rapidly we exhibit the signs of
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:33.400]  nutritional satisfaction nutritional satiety quickly because as soon as the
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:37.600]  body gets the good stuff it starts its God-given healing process but the system
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:41.200]  doesn't want even though they have the studies on this to give this to Alzheimer
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:45.680]  patients or diabetics across the board because they'd rather sell you some
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:50.120]  thousand dollar a month drug now the good news in a way is they're beginning to
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:56.840]  patent the B vitamins the hormones the the minerals the compounds so it does
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:01.240]  cost money a lot more maybe 10 20 30 times but at least now doctors are
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:05.920]  starting to recommend a little of this because now their guild is allowing it
[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:10.040]  here's a couple of points number one when they patent these drugs they tweak
[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:13.080]  or they pat these nutritional supplements they tweak them to make them
[02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:16.240]  drugs because prescription because nutritional supplements cannot be
[02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:19.840]  patented so they have to tweak the molecule they have to change the molecule
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:23.920]  so that it becomes a prescription drug see the power structure wants us to feel
[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:27.280]  out of control that's why the economic figures go up and down that's why the
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:31.000]  TSA is molesting us that's why we get terrorist threats it's all designed to
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:35.280]  make us feel lost and scared and nothing is makes us feel more exactly and
[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:39.680]  they're attacking us through the food supply as Bertrand Russell as George
[02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:43.480]  Bernard Shaw as all the globalists said they would do they're doing at the MSG
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:47.760]  the aspartame now in all major gums at the store you cannot find sugar gum I

[02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:10.200]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:14.080]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:18.480]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:22.920]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:27.680]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:31.480]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:35.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:39.440]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:24.120]  honest with you that it doesn't even mean that I take all of my own advice I
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:29.640]  tried to I'm eating healthier I'm exercising more I'm now taking the
[02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:33.760]  minerals and I can feel a major difference my wife is the one who is
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:38.720]  literally glowing now and I don't want to get into any of her mild health
[02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:45.680]  things but we've seen reversals of stuff and it's not placebo because we're
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:50.080]  very cynical we've tried a lot of different stuff I have there is
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:55.360]  something about liquid natural vitamins we'll have pharmacist Ben Fuchs break
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:34:00.240]  that down and I wasn't planning this Ted I talked to Ted Ted's my friend I
[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:02.880]  talked to Ted all the time he's of Minnesota I've been up there fishing
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:08.400]  with him and hunting and stuff over the years I've known Ted now 14 years it'll
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:14.440]  be 14 years next month and you know Ted's parents are great people in their
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:20.560]  80s and his dad's a great guy and Ted's been really depressed every time I
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:23.400]  don't want to get into all the private stuff but Ted said I could talk about
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:27.800]  some of this almost every time I talked to him on the weekend he's not with his
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:32.400]  son in the army or his kids I mean he is sometimes he's usually trying to take
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:35.760]  his dad fishing because he's saying I don't have a lot of time left and lately
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:40.280]  a few months ago he's like man my dad is really drifting off he almost has no
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:47.040]  memory repeating everything doesn't know people are sometimes and Ted what was it
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:51.240]  six months ago a Michaels whirling who's on a who's the owner of few stations
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:55.640]  were on out in California big stations said look Ted believe me this stuff's
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:00.400]  real try these vitamins okay because they're in the liquid form they're the
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:03.680]  type you actually absorb there's over 90 of them the government says you only
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:09.120]  need 40 try it and Ted's like okay Ted had a knee so bad he's about to have
[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:15.040]  surgery he took this cartilage supplement they've got gone so a month and a
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:18.120]  half ago will tell tell the story briefly and we'll have been fukes comment
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:25.080]  Ted got his dad on and again they got to check out the rest with the doctor so
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:30.080]  he's only got him on the tangy tangerine and got him on the essential fat he
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:34.920]  acids which again the brain is 70% water of the 30% that's solid almost all of it
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:38.520]  is a cholesterol based electrochemical computer and I remember 20 years ago
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:41.960]  reading people with who have epilepsy they tell them get on these certain type
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:48.960]  of high-fat diets I mean this has all been known folks okay and his dad has
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:52.720]  had incredible rebound and I started thinking what Ted was telling me wait
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:57.360]  dr. Blalock talked about all this he talked about chronic brain inflammation
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:03.640]  from the MSG the aspartame the aluminum but also the nutrient deficiencies and
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:06.640]  Blalock has his own line of minerals which we were not affiliated with but I
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:11.240]  say those are great too and and and how the statins are going after the brain
[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:16.600]  because they attack oils the brain's oil folks Ted Anderson tell us what's
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:20.240]  happened with your dad well I mean it's just simple as this Alex you'd be over
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:25.200]  at my my dad's house and my dad would ask you a question and then about a
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:29.880]  minute later ask you the same question and then again and and he just didn't
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:34.240]  have you could ask him what happened just a a few moments ago I remember
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:38.240]  taking him fishing out on the and we went ice fishing up in up north and we
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:42.400]  caught a lot of fish and he caught most and we went in and he says well what are
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:46.280]  we doing I said and my brother says we're fishing and he says oh yeah that's
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:50.720]  right too bad we didn't get any you know but now I can go on there and he can
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:54.760]  tell me what he did two days ago he can tell me what you know like I was over
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:59.080]  for Easter and he was able to recite why my brother wasn't gonna be able to
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:03.120]  show up on time with his wife you know stuff that you just never would expect
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:07.240]  from him his skin was black and blue on his hands if he just brushed against
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:11.480]  something his skin would tear up it was so paper thin and and he always had
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:16.480]  bandages on the band-aids are gone he has a short-term memory back his life
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:20.760]  he's revitalized it's like my dad is back and all he's been doing is taking
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:25.840]  tangy tangerine which is a mineral vitamin mix and you know I'm just so
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:29.640]  tired of being lied to by the doctors they wanted to cut my knees out knee
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:34.200]  surgery want to replace it with a with a hinge for God's sakes and now I've been
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:38.400]  taking the things my left knees as good as my right knee now now lefty was how
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:43.320]  long has your dad been on it dad's been on it for I would say probably about a
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:49.840]  month and a half okay now now here's the issue info wars team.com I don't get
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:53.080]  behind something unless I believe in it you pay $10 and you get a discount on it
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:56.960]  or you can just go buy it and pay the full price and we do want people to pay
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:00.520]  it forward to spread the word about this I've just been buying it and giving it
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:04.720]  to family and now when you drink the tangy tangerine this isn't like your
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:08.640]  normal vitamin thing where it just tastes like little sweet sugar I mean you
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:14.320]  can taste it it's almost like it it's it's it's harsh but in a good way for
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:19.040]  somebody who in past has enjoyed a shot of Jack Daniels it's kind of good in
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:22.200]  that way and it's not as hard as drinking Jack Daniels but I mean it's
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:26.360]  powerful you can taste the vitamins you can taste all the flavors you can taste
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:31.580]  the you know things you've never tasted before and again my wife like three
[02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:34.840]  months ago when Ted was sitting us this stuff was like come on you got to take
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:37.440]  this I'm like I never take vitamins and minerals I'm sure it's great I know it
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:41.880]  is I started taking it it's amazing and and this is real I tell you buy silver
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:46.640]  when it's $5 an ounce it's how much is silver now Ted well it was just under
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:51.200]  $50 an ounce just okay I told people buy gold when it was 260 it's 1500 and
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:56.360]  what now well 1537 okay okay I'm not perfect but I only promote what I feel
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:59.920]  good about I'm a free market capitalist I hope you buy a whole bunch of it we
[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:03.480]  can fund our operation I hope you sign up become a distributor and sell it
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:08.760]  yourself at info wars team.com but I'm gonna be honest I sleep well even though
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:12.240]  the globalist are after me I am a type of person when I do something wrong around
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:16.480]  the office I apologize I feel bad you know just little slights none of us are
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:21.160]  perfect I mean I'm a guy who only promotes what I believe in and I studied
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:24.580]  history I've looked at it I think these are the best supplements out there bar
[02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:28.000]  none and you start getting these testimonies like Ted's talking about
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:32.200]  info wars team.com if I forgot to get the number we got a big team of folks
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:35.160]  who they can answer questions so will you guys pull that off the site for me
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:40.760]  thank you we'll put it on screen info wars team.com Ted Anderson I want you
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:43.800]  to stay with us I know this wasn't planned but we talked about maybe getting
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:48.280]  on a few days ago bringing pharmacist Ben Fuchs again mainline pharmacist who
[02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:52.640]  found out about all this teamed up with info wars team.com what is happening
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:56.800]  with his dad what is happening with his niece out can you hear me out there
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:01.440]  here's the deal here's the deal as we get older our digestive system begins to
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:05.120]  get weaker not only that but 60 to 70 million Americans have digestive
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:08.240]  problems anyway but it's really serious when we get older nice to be a
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:11.640]  consulting pharmacist in nursing homes let me tell you something everybody in
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:14.680]  the nursing home has got a digestive problem one of the things that happens
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:18.720]  when you have digestive impairment is you do not absorb your nutrients I cannot
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:23.160]  tell you how critical it is to take your nutrients in liquid fashion the
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:26.760]  beautiful thing about the supplements that Ted's dad was taking is that they
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:30.360]  were liquid they went to work right away and they went to work where they were
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:34.480]  needed right away specifically the minerals and the B vitamins as we get
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:38.080]  older we don't absorb these substances and Alzheimer's disease and many of the
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:41.880]  diseases of degeneration that older folks suffer from are nothing more than
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:45.560]  nutritional deficiencies and it's critical that we all understand this
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:52.480]  well under scurvy just in in mainline medical encyclopedias it describes not
[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:57.520]  having enough vitamin C alone old wounds opening up old areas where teeth
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:02.400]  have been pulled opening up the hair falling out the eyes degenerating the
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:07.640]  men going crazy because the brain is literally falling apart from not having
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:13.160]  vitamin C explain that one vitamin here's the thing Alex if you look at the
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:15.560]  medical textbooks they'll tell you about the horrible things that go with
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:18.120]  scurvy and they'll tell you about the horrible things that go with pellegra
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:21.480]  which is B3 deficiency they'll tell you about the horrible things that go with
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:25.480]  berry a berry berry which is thiamine deficiency but they don't tell you about
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:32.560]  subclinical pellegra or subclinical scurvy or subclinical berry berry which
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:36.480]  means it's not bad enough that your blood vessels explode but it's bad enough
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:40.200]  that you get little cuts and little mix in your arteries so that cholesterol has
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:43.040]  to come and patch it up it's not bad enough that you have full-blown
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:46.240]  dementia but it's bad enough that you're a little bit forgetful it's not bad
[02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:49.240]  enough that you have full-blown berry berry where you can't get out of bed but
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:52.720]  it's bad enough that you just don't feel good enough you don't feel strong enough
[02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:56.320]  so what we want to understand is that the recommended daily allowances and
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:42:00.480]  these amounts that we're supposed to be taking are based on disease states but
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:05.160]  we all suffer from subclinical disease state disease states that show up is
[02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:09.400]  just getting a cold frequently or just show up as mild depression or just show
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:13.440]  up as blood pressure problems and this is where we have so much opportunity to
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:16.320]  take care of ourselves through nutritional supplementation through
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:20.320]  taking control back of our health through not participating in the food
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:23.160]  system and that's one of the most important things that nutritional
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:27.200]  supplementation allows you to do once you start supplementing folks you will
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:30.400]  not feel like you need fast food as much you will not feel like you need the
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:33.680]  potato chips once you get on your essential fatty acids you will not feel
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:37.040]  like you need the coffee once you get on your B vitamins you will not feel like
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:41.360]  you need a blood pressure medicine once you get on vitamin C taking nutritional
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:44.560]  supplements getting on a nutritional supplement program is the most powerful
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:49.840]  strategy we have at our disposal from disengaging from the machine from the
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:55.960]  state-run monster that's taking control of our lives well it's just amazing to
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:03.000]  to see all this happening and their famous cases of remote tribes in South
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.360]  America and Africa also in Asia who are ignorant don't know who have the big
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:13.800]  giant swollen necks because they're not getting any iodine are you familiar
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:18.360]  with those cases absolutely absolutely just 12 and a half milligrams of iodine
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:21.920]  a day and you don't have to have goiter even less even less than that get
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:25.800]  yourself on a good iodine supplement or get yourself on a good ocean supplement
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:29.920]  seaweed supplement there's so many ways that we can participate in a nutritional
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:34.040]  supplement program to avoid confronting this horrible health crisis that we
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:37.840]  confront there's two point five trillion dollars a year spent on health in this
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:42.120]  country it's 15% of the gross domestic product and how healthy are we for all
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:46.240]  of that a nutritional supplement program is the cheapest insurance program you
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:53.440]  could ever be on well again the system knows this they understand this I mean
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:56.440]  you read the medical books from a hundred years ago the veterinary books
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:02.560]  they all knew that and you'll show much of the wives tales about vitamins you
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:06.360]  know certain certain plants for certain sicknesses you're giving people trace
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:11.680]  minerals and elements that they need what's different about the tangy
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:17.080]  tangerine all these products are at info wars team dot com it's Ted and
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:20.360]  Michael's Rowling that got me into this Ted what are some of the other products
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:24.800]  the fatty acids that you got your dad on as well and then I want pharmacists been
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:28.760]  featured describe what those fatty acids are doing in the brain well the weird
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:32.720]  part about it is that my mom has to clear everything through the doctor first so
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:37.040]  something as simple as essential fatty acids I feel like I have to get clearance
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:42.760]  to see the president or something like that I mean but the EFAs I take my dad
[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:46.360]  will be taking them I mean it's just so good for your skin for your brain I mean
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:52.400]  Ben can talk about the benefits of EFAs I take this stuff called osteo fx that's
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:57.080]  just it's like a magnesium calcium drink I mean I don't I don't feel like my
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:01.280]  knees hurt anymore I mean when the doctor tried to push my leg back to my
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:05.920]  butt when I was laying on my belly and it just you know I was such in such pain
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:09.720]  it just had to scream you know you know and he said look you gotta do these
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:13.440]  stretches and we're gonna shoot you up with cortisone and then eventually
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:17.240]  maybe some arthroscopic surgery and eventually cutting your knee out and
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:21.880]  replacing it that was my future this is what the medical industry is telling me
[02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:26.800]  I need to do and all the cortisone would have done was mask the inflammation that
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:32.840]  was the sign of the underlying problem correct pharmacist Ben Fuchs oh worse
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:36.120]  than mask it it would shut it down inflammation is your body's main
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:40.480]  protective mechanism for from injury and cortisone shuts it down cortisol a
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:45.640]  cortisone cortisol shut down your body's immune system as well so the main
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:50.000]  medical strategies for handling these things not only mask symptomology they
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.680]  shut down the body's defensive mechanisms and the real tragedy of his
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:57.760]  the whole thing is is that simple nutritional supplementation many times
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:00.800]  is all you need and nothing exemplifies that more than these the story with
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:04.680]  essential fatty acids we are if you had to pick the single most important
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:07.840]  nutritional deficiency that we suffer from in this country I would tell you and
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:10.880]  it's a tough call because we suffer from a lot of them I would tell you the
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:15.360]  single most important and critical is essential fatty acids these substances
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:18.960]  are so vital number one they're not in it they're hard to get any foods number
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:23.120]  two your hormone system depends on them they are the precursors to something
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:27.080]  called master hormones if you're a biochemist you'll call them icosanoids
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:32.080]  and these master hormone control the effects of every single hormone in your
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:35.200]  body whether that hormone is insulin or whether that hormone is thyroid
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:39.160]  hormone or whether that hormone is neurotransmitters in the brain essential
[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:43.560]  fatty acids allow these precursors these icosanoids to be made at an effective
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:47.520]  clip so all of the other hormones work better in fact one of the first things
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:51.840]  that women notice when they start taking these EFAs is their menstrual cramps
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:55.840]  disappear it takes about 30 days of EFA supplements and ladies you know good and
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:59.760]  well that if you're getting menstrual cramps you are craving fatty foods at
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:03.920]  the same time and that's the body's cry for essential fatty acids that's one of
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:07.560]  the neat things about because the body needs it I hate to compare women to
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:12.400]  mosquitoes but it's only the female mosquito and all mosquito species that
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:18.000]  goes out and sucks blood it needs it for egg production to produce the larvae
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:23.800]  and it's the same thing with mammals that's why women are craving fatty
[02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:28.280]  things because after they have the menstrual cycle the body needs to
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:35.760]  basically grow the next crop of the system inside the uterus for the
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:39.280]  embryo to implant in and so they're needing they're needing fat they're
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:43.640]  needing protein there go ahead the point the point is once these once you
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:48.120]  start taking these essential fatty acids you don't crave fatty foods anymore you
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:52.240]  can actually get to a point where you will not want french fries because the
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:56.280]  beautiful thing about the human body is once you give it the good stuff it will
[02:47:56.280 --> 02:48:00.600]  automatically take you away from the bad stuff like with protein once you start
[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:04.120]  getting enough protein you will actually be able to wean yourself off
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:08.400]  comfortably from bread and pasta and refined carbohydrates and sugar that we
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:11.680]  know are the bane of western civilization once you start getting enough
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:15.040]  protein and that's why I like these protein powders by the way okay now
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:19.800]  I mean what about the woman's FX 32 ounce system that's an info wars team
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:23.240]  dot-com and when people are checking these out name the specific products they
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:27.520]  want to zero in on you want to zero in on the Suzanne summer shaker on the
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:30.320]  nature's way to make sure you're getting your protein you want to make sure
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:34.080]  you're getting that ultimate EFA that's part of the Alex pack in fact as I was
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:37.800]  saying it's tough to single them it's tough to single out the the most
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:41.720]  critical nutritional supplement you need to be on but I'll tell you what folks a
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:46.720]  strong case could be made for essential fatty acids because every single cell in
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:49.840]  the body depends on them they're critical for hormone function they're
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:52.720]  important for skin health they're important for brain function they're
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:56.440]  important for the central for the circulatory system and they're critical
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:49:00.720]  for the lymphatic system which we hardly ever hear anybody talking about but the
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:04.640]  lymphatic system is your body's immune immune highway it's where all the
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:08.080]  toxins in the white blood cells travel through and many of us suffer from
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:12.760]  lymphatic congestion and rest assured disease follows lymphatic congestion just
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:17.200]  as sure as night follows day well you know that Dennis know that with the
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:21.440]  reporting more than half the heart attacks are related to infections that
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:27.720]  come from the vector point of infected gums and the bacteria flora getting in
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:30.720]  and so just like you have the inflammation infection that's where it's
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:34.920]  all starting the spreading infection to the arteries that's right you don't
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:37.680]  want to shut down inflammation folks and you don't want to shut down the
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:40.560]  immune system that is one of the silliest strategies in all of medicine
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:43.960]  and medicine is filled with silly strategies but one of the silliest is
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:47.640]  this idea that if you have arthritis or you have some kind of inflammation in
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:51.520]  the body or you have God forbid an autoimmune disease oh let's give you a
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:55.400]  little prednisone one of the most toxic drugs known to man and shut down your
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:58.960]  immune system folks if you have an autoimmune problem I don't care if that's
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:02.480]  lupus or rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes or addison's disease or
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:06.480]  Hashimoto's whatever it is if you have an autoimmune disease the dumbest thing
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:10.560]  you can do is shut down your immune system the correct strategy is figure
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:15.400]  out why is your immune system active why is it hyperactive eliminate anything
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:18.520]  that's getting into your into your body that's triggering that in my stand there
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:22.160]  I want to talk about I want to talk about allergies when we come back but thank

[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:16.280]  armisticebenfugeinfowarsteam.com is our guest to Genesis radio host as well
[02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:23.600]  find out more at GCNlive.com obviously will continue to cover more what's
[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:27.360]  happening with the birth certificate controversy the latest on Fukushima's
[02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:31.000]  the radiation intensifies Kurt Nemo's got a new article out that we're going to
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.880]  be expanding digital artifacts prove Obama birth certificate altered we're
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:38.840]  gonna add on some of the other I mean this was put out to create a false
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:44.640]  debate now CBS anchor saying Trump is racist you see now you can't criticize
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:47.880]  Obama or anything he does I mean the former head of the Treasury saying
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:52.720]  you're al-Qaeda and that half the Congress needs to be rounded up bizarre
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:57.600]  statement on Bloomberg if you don't raise taxes and give them the debt ceiling
[02:54:57.600 --> 02:55:01.800]  raised I mean I mean this is insane they're saying if you don't give them
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:06.480]  more money and go into more debt it will cause the default when they're the
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:11.520]  ones that engineered it I mean they're counting on us being dumb just like the
[02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:15.880]  medical system Ben Fuchs you were trained as a regular big pharmacist you
[02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:18.320]  know I talked to doctors they say pharmacists no more about drug
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:21.120]  interactions and then the doctors because you're you know you're the folks
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:25.440]  have got your name and your life on the line if you make a mistake we look at
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:29.360]  how toxic these drugs are and then we see the demonization of minerals and
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:35.600]  vitamins and all the things they're doing we see in the a safe food act they
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:39.600]  tried to pass codex alimentary is it actually says it in there tell folks
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:42.880]  about codex alimentary is they're trying to control how many how much
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:46.040]  nutrition you can get even in some it's already kicking in in some countries in
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:50.800]  Europe you can't get more than 60 or 70 milligrams of vitamin C at a pop it's
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:54.680]  about to happen folks you know it almost happened 20 years ago but everybody
[02:55:54.680 --> 02:55:57.920]  made a big stink about it now it doesn't seem like people care as much and I'll
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:02.000]  tell you what a government would love to control the amount of nutrition that we
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:05.120]  get in our body because that is the final nail in the coffin once they
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:08.960]  control the amount of nutrients that are in our body it's all over I follow
[02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:11.720]  everything that's going on with the TSA and everything that's going on with the
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:15.120]  Patriot Act and everything that's going on with with the government intrusion in
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:18.600]  our lives but I'll tell you there's nothing more fundamental than the right
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:22.200]  we have to take nutritional supplementation and to control the foods
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:26.240]  that we eat and if we don't participate in the nutritional supplement program and
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:33.160]  integrate intimately with nutrients in our bodies it's all over folks well
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:38.760]  you're absolutely right and I wanted to bring Ted up I mean Ted you I mean
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:42.520]  obviously we're selling promoting these products at info wars team.com but we
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:45.600]  sell and promote what we believe in I've talked to you privately you weren't
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:49.120]  even talking about coming on air I twisted your arm to do it I mean you
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:54.760]  literally are like an acolyte supporter now of the young Jebedee products I am
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:56:59.080]  Alex you know I mean I was a I was skeptical I was I'm not a vitamin
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:02.040]  mineral guy I have no nothing about nutrition I mean I've always been
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:07.360]  focused on killing the Federal Reserve system and improving your show and
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:11.080]  making this thing grow to something big but I've never paid attention to my own
[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:14.840]  health which was drifting away I just thought I was getting old it would be
[02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:19.080]  something I'd have to put up with and then Zwirling got me hooked up and I
[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:23.000]  tried this stuff and I just I can't believe I mean I was taking glucosamine
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:27.960]  and chondroitin for five years and I didn't improve my knee problem until I
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:32.000]  started taking the mineral drink the Tangy Tangerine it's like it was a
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:35.840]  cofactor that had to be added to it and then all of a sudden my left knee which
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:39.440]  I was limping around on I had actually absolutely well Ted thank you for
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:44.120]  joining us we're flat out of time finishing up with Ben Fuchs being
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:49.000]  briefly what is the difference between the mineral cocktail that's in a beyond
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:55.240]  Tangy Tangerine and some you know $20 bottle you get put out by big pharma at
[02:57:55.240 --> 02:57:58.560]  the grocery store minerals are very interesting because they come in
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:02.760]  different forms if you look at the periodic table you see 92 or so elements
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:05.760]  on the periodic table what they don't show you is each one of those elements
[02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:08.200]  comes in a different format the minerals that you're getting in the beyond
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:12.360]  Tangy Tangerine are in a format that's called colloidal and this means it's
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:15.120]  simply put that they have a certain electrical activity that makes them
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:20.800]  non-toxic and makes them ready readily available to cells but also reading it's
[02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:24.520]  a particular way they're getting these vitamins to these are plant derived
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:28.720]  they're plant derived what happened over millions of years plants convert rocks
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:32.680]  stones from the earth into usable minerals as those plants die off they
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:35.840]  leave the minerals behind you can scoop those minerals up today and you can put
[02:58:35.840 --> 02:58:39.120]  them in a liquid drink and instead of seeking like stones stay there stay there
[02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:47.440]  five more minutes info wars team dot com thank you for listening to GCN visit

[02:59:54.000 --> 03:00:08.640]  from Austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network you're
[03:00:08.640 --> 03:00:15.640]  the pretender one of us say I will never surrender who are you what side are you
[03:00:15.640 --> 03:00:20.320]  on big news up at prison planet dot com it's not on info wars dot com yet
[03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:24.920]  Rand Paul demands to see original long-form certificate of Trump's
[03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:31.240]  Republican credentials senator draws on farce of birther distraction to make a
[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:36.360]  very serious point and I want to say this this birther thing the way it's been
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:41.120]  positioned is a farce compared to Obama's real actions and the things that
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:46.080]  he's done that are unconstitutional the lies he's told the Wall Street selling
[03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:51.280]  out the GE corruption the socialist health care the waivers it is a
[03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:55.160]  distraction because you can never prove it one way or the other all I'm saying
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:59.200]  is we've blown up this birth certificate and looked at it it's got
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:03.800]  artifacts that are all wild in the background and then not on the areas
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:07.560]  that have been changed showing that they've put new high-res things in and
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:13.240]  the fonts don't match it's an it's obviously been manipulated does that
[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:20.040]  make it a forgery I guess so I mean what else do you call it it's crazy it's
[03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:23.960]  absolutely crazy and we put out one video last night only scratching the
[03:01:23.960 --> 03:01:27.560]  surface I'm gonna try to put another video out going over all the other
[03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:31.480]  anomalies because because you know we've gotten into covering this I don't
[03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:36.320]  know where he was really born all I know is they said the old certificate was a
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:41.120]  certificate there was no long form and now they released this long form and it
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:44.360]  looks as fake as a three dollar bill going back for just three final minutes
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:52.400]  we've got left here with pharmacist Ben Fuchs pharmacist again I just hope
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:56.160]  people will check out info works team comm and try some of the products out
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:02:01.040]  and if it and if it doesn't give them benefits then they can you know just I
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:06.200]  guess they didn't have mineral deficiencies because for my research
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:09.640]  mineral deficiencies and vitamin deficiencies and cofactor deficiencies
[03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:13.520]  are so important speak to that and then talk about what else is in things like
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:18.360]  the Tangierine and why that's got 90 plus instead of 40 plus the white has
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:22.040]  more things in it than the government says you need Alex there's no way you're
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:25.640]  not gonna notice a difference on this we are so starving we're so missing basic
[03:02:25.640 --> 03:02:29.160]  nutrients if you're not a nutrition not on a nutritional supplement program as
[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:32.800]  soon as you do a shot of this beyond Tangierine you will notice a difference
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:36.480]  because it's a liquid nutrients and it goes right to work and the fact that
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:40.400]  these minerals are in a colloidal form that means that they are electrically
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:44.720]  active as I was saying before we went to the break plants have an ability to take
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:49.200]  rocks from the earth and turn them into electrically active minerals that's why
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:52.680]  vegetables are so important among other reasons well as these vegetables and
[03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:56.200]  plants died off millions of years ago this whole part of the world was filled
[03:02:56.200 --> 03:02:59.600]  with swamps as these swamps died off what they left behind where these
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:03.280]  electrically active minerals and when you scoop these minerals up and you put
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:06.880]  them in water you revivify them you bring them back to life and the beyond
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:11.880]  Tangierine and the ultimate classic and the old the Tangierine products are so
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:15.320]  wonderful because they're loaded with these liquid with these colloidal
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:18.720]  minerals and when you put them in a liquid you electrically activated you're
[03:03:18.720 --> 03:03:22.040]  literally drinking electrical energy in addition you're getting your amino acids
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:25.480]  and you're getting your vitamins you're getting all 88 of your 88 nutrients you
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:29.000]  need 90 nutrients you need amino acids you need vitamins you need minerals and
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.720]  you need your three essential fatty acids and that's why that Alex pack is so
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:35.840]  cool it's got your EFA's it's got your beyond Tangierine and it's got the
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:39.400]  osteo FX and folks it's the cheapest insurance program you'll ever go on
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:44.160]  most people notice results in 30 days well I know Ted's raving my wife's
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:51.840]  raving he was his dad didn't was really fading off and couldn't even basically
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:55.560]  operate according to Ted and now Ted's just blown away and he's trying to get
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:04:00.160]  him on all of it but they've got to check with the God the doctor and hopefully
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:04.840]  he'll approve the evil vitamins and minerals the rest of them but very
[03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:08.680]  important let's put it back on screen so I can give folks the number it's info
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:16.000]  wars team.com or 877-551-1301-877-551-1301 if you want to ask any
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:19.760]  questions get a discount when you sign up to be a distributor like you know when
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:23.040]  you go to Costco you get a membership or you just buy the stuff there that's what
[03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:26.240]  I'm doing buying it giving it to family and then they're liking it and getting
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:30.800]  on board but some family I've given it to who just won't even try it and like I
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:34.160]  got family that won't buy gold and silver even when I told them to get it at
[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:41.180]  300 and it was 500 and 800 a thousand but info wars team.com then Fuchs your
[03:04:41.180 --> 03:04:45.520]  shows right before mine at GCN live.com 10 a.m. every morning thank you for
