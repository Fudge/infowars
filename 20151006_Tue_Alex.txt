[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  This is going to be a transmission.
[00:05.000 --> 00:10.000]  The brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network,
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  We knew that they would be coming after the guns
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  in an unprecedented manner in the last year
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.000]  of President Obama's administration.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  We knew that they would either use real crises
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  to demonize the Second Amendment or produce those crises.
[00:39.000 --> 00:45.000]  And we are now seeing Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, CNN,
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  The Washington Post.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  I mean, I've got a stack of news today,
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  a stack of news yesterday.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  We've got a whole bunch of clips where they are saying,
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  it's time to take the guns.
[00:57.000 --> 01:05.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  After all the denials, we don't want your guns.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  They keep saying there can't be one more shooting,
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  or we've got to take your guns,
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  as if citizens in general are committing these crimes
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  when these crimes are flat.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  Less than 170 people a year die.
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  But they want to project the blame collectively,
[01:28.000 --> 01:35.000]  like they say, you're racist if you don't support Obamacare.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  We have a special report up on info wars.com,
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  the title Obama wants your guns,
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  despite committing war crimes in the Middle East
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  that have killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  Where are they personalizing the people killed
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  by radical jihadists?
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  Where are they personalizing all the people
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  getting raped in Europe by the giant refugee flows?
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  That's in the news today.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  Where are the personalization stories
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  about all those killed in Mexico and the United States
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  by the Fast and Furious program?
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  Lo and behold, there'll be no coverage of that.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  We have the Oregon Sheriff where the shooting
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  happened last Thursday saying gun control
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  was not the answer, and residents agree
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  the LA Times accurately reports.
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  And say what you want about the LA Times,
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  they occasionally actually tell the truth.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  They're like, actually, gun crimes weigh down,
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  but people think it's up.
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  Actually, the sheriff's being supported.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  Well, the Bloomberg group, CNN, and others,
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  and we have the clips, are all saying
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  he should resign right now and basically implying
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  he killed the 10 people.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  When he didn't even have the jurisdiction
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  over the gun-free zone at the state college
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  where they had their own security people.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  But you see, it fits the bill
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  of attacking local police, local sheriffs
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  with the national media protecting
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  they're all a bunch of racist white guys,
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  or even if they're black.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  They've got some secret racist agenda
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  like Sheriff Clark or the sheriff
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  in Travis County who's a Democrat,
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  but he's black, and he deports like five
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  violent felon illegals a week.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  Oh my gosh, you can't deport
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  someone that has felonies.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  He's got to be removed. He's evil.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  This is a revolution.
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  This is a globalist takeover
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  by every stretch of the imagination.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  It is tyranny.
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  So, we're going to break all that down.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  Huge developments with the NATO situation.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  Warning rush over.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  Incursions into Turkish airspace now.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  Because the Al Qaeda forces build up
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  on the Turkish side and on the Iraq side
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  and then inject into attack.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  A lot of times getting Turkish artillery support, of course.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  This is a major military operation, western run.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski's saying,
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  let's go ahead and strike Russia.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  Because, you know, he's got access
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  to the former national security advisor
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  to the bunkers, I guess,
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  so he thinks he can live through a nuclear war.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  He just wants to go start wars with Russian allies
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  and invade them with proxy armies.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  NATO is now saying Russian ground troops are in Syria.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  Turkey's airspace has been violated again, they say.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  And yes, there are thousands and thousands
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  of Russian troops reportedly a day
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  now being injected in.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  This is big.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  This is big.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  Russia knows it's going to face a major
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  Saudi NATO counteroffensive.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  And so it believes it's injecting enough troops
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  in to protect its air force as it engages
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  the NATO proxy army and NATO mercenaries
[04:53.000 --> 05:16.000]  in what could shape up to be the next big world war.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  Furthermore, CNN did not show photos
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  of Mercer's mother, who was African-American.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  And the network also didn't report
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  that Mercer was involved in the school play,
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  which contradicts the media's claim that he was a loner.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  Why would they do that?
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  Because a biracial organ shooter does not fit
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  into the establishment's propaganda
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  that mass shooters are white racist men.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  They also don't want you to know that Mercer
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement,
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  because it would be a political nightmare for Obama
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  if the public knew the truth.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  It'd be hard for him to demand more gun control
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  if he didn't know the truth.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  But some people started to realize
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  that President Obama is fueling racial division
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.000]  across the U.S.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels
[06:01.000 --> 06:21.000]  with the top-of-the-line storeable food company,
[06:21.000 --> 06:47.000]  where you can find the best deals and bring it to you.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  Secure you and your families' needs today
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  at InfowarsStore.com
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  with Infowars Select.
[06:53.000 --> 06:55.000]  That's InfowarsSelect.com
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  or 888-253-3139.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  I want more candy.
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  I want more video games. Why, why, why?
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  And it's that type of behavior
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  that spurred me to do the research
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  that was designed to smooth out
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  and help children focus.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  Young humans have not yet developed
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  their nervous system and are being hammered
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  daily by globalist concoctions.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  and calm down and then are put on
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  that children would actually like and take.
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  and nutritional supplements that are safe for children
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  to bring you the most affordable
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  and powerful calming formula out there,
[07:43.000 --> 07:45.000]  introducing child ease with herbs
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  and calming extracts like chamomile
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  and lemon balm and essential nutrients
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  that taste great.

[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  at InfowarsLife.com.
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  That's Child Ease, exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  I was trained in firearms.
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  I carried a concealed weapon.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  I made the determination
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  that if somebody was going to try to take me out,
[08:09.000 --> 08:15.000]  I was going to take them with me.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  If I could have gotten
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  51 votes
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  in the Senate of the United States
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  for an outright ban
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  picking up every one of them,
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America,
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  turn them all in.
[08:29.000 --> 08:43.000]  We are ruled by a social engineering class
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  that uses our goodwill,
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  our humanity against us.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  They guilt us
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  into signing on
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  and at least passively acquiescing
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  to their global hegemonic,
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  planetary, corporate government
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  that is anti-human
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  and that is very close to completing
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  the establishment of a global army
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  and global tax and global courts
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  and global bureaucrats,
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  global political
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  and religious magistrates
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  to carry out
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  the agenda,
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  which is not some star trekking
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  in kumbaya
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  peace fleet
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  going into space together
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  to help little green men.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  No, it is a technocracy
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  meant to end humanity as we know it
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  so the elite can transcend
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  and become gods.
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  I'm not saying they're going to achieve that.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  That's their cosmology.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  That's their cult religion.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  That's what these people believe.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  It's what they're pushing for.
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  It's their goal.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  And this transmission is just an ongoing
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  chronicle
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  of humanity
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  fighting against these tyrants
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  and tracking what the tyrants
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  are engaged in
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  so the humanity can begin to get
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  mobilized, organized
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  in defense of human liberty
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  and I know we'll be successful
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  because
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  as the globalist program unfolds
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  people will then go back and listen to what we've said
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  what we've written, what we have exposed
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  as they're now doing
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  and we'll understand that we do have our finger
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  on the global pulse.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  We do have our finger on the zeitgeist.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  We do understand how the elite operate.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  We do know what their end game is
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  and we know how to stop them
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  and the future
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  that we're promoting is an open source
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  free humanity
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  non-utopia
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  but it is not a dystopia.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  It is free will
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  and the great animating contest of liberty
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  and that's what I stand for.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  That's what we stand for.
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  That's what the end full war is.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  The truth will set you free
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  and we are seeking it.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  We don't have a corner on the truth.
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  We don't have 100% truth
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  but our hearts are looking for truth.
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  Our souls are pointing at the truth
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  like our North Star.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  North Star.
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  Obviously, we have a giant
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  transmission today.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  The enemy is launching
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  its attack on humanity
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  on every front.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  The social attacks on the family.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  The attacks on world currencies.
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  The attacks on rural communities.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  The attacks on producers.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  The attacks on free market.
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  The attacks on small businesses.
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  The attacks on sovereignty.
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  Western world flooded
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  with immigrant populations
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  put on government payroll
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  immediately to be a destabilization
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  force and to drive down wages.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  We're seeing religious leaders
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  from Protestant to Catholic
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  to Buddhist to Islamic
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  getting in line with the big banks
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  calling for one world government
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  calling for UN control.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  We're seeing the Pope promote
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  government.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  We're seeing the TPP
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  signed and agreed to
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  yesterday
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  and still the details are secret
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  but the three sections we've got
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  admit it ends internet freedom
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  as we know it, expands copyright
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  to free speech, creates draconian
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  attacks on whistleblowers,
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  shuts down domestic businesses
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  that aren't in line with global regulations,
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  creates planetary taxes,
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  creates internet taxes
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  I mean it's so over the top
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  forced GMOs worldwide
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  forced medical standards worldwide
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  basically Obamacare worldwide
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  where insurance companies
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  can break down other people's laws
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  and double and triple charge
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  so they can gouge you on medicine prices.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  I mean you want a
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  crony capitalist fascist gang rape
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  wrapped in a big giant
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  communist tortilla
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  you're getting it.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  This is a giant
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  above the law tax exempt
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  megacorporation monstrosity.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  The globalists are launching invasions
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  of almost every sector of northern
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  eastern western and central Africa
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  with al-Qaeda
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  western funded
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  Saudi Arabian quarterback
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  jihad forces
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  then NATO comes in
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  through
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  Africa and takes over
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  in the response to the
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  al-Qaeda mercenaries
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  who are only the pretext for the west to be there
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  even African leaders are saying
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  we think we're battling al-Qaeda then we see
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  it's white mercenaries from
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Africa, from France
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  from Germany, from Belgium
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  from the Netherlands, from England
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  it's on folks
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  proxy armies have been launched
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  out of Saudi Arabia and Turkey
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  against Libya, against Egypt
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  against Syria, against Iraq
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  it is a giant
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  proxy war
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  starting a Shiite Sunni
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  civil war worldwide
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  flooding Asia
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  flooding central Europe, eastern Europe
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  southern Russia, western Europe
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  the UK, the United States, Canada, Australia
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  with
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  the actual Sunni
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  refugees of the conflicts
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  that Saudi Arabia started
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  these are not
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  Shiite, these are not
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  Alawite
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  these are not Christian refugees
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  that's now on record
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  they will use that next phase
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  of the operation
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  to further destabilize the west
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  and then have the security services pretext
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  to come in and really
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  take everybody's liberties
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  then they'll do another bait and switch
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  what they've already done
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  to announce
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  the enemy isn't radical Islam
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  it's the veterans, the gun owners
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  the conservatives, the libertarians
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  just as they signed a global agreement
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  a week ago
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  that's gotten almost no press
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  info wars didn't even cover it
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  Drudge report linked the Breitbart covering it
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  that's why it's good
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  that there's other organizations out there
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  because I can't keep track of how fast this is moving
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  that a global agreement
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  was signed with
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  we'll bring that out of my stack from yesterday
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  we have the Justice Department's own announcement
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  it's not just on Breitbart, this is not just our opinion
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  saying we're preparing a UN force
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  with local mayors to be
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  deputized under the UN
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  under UN speech regulations
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  to go after right-wing extremist
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  libertarians, gun owners, veterans
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  and follow the Homeland Security
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  guidebook on threats
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  which again states returning vets, veterans, gun owners, Christians
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  are the enemy
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  and then all these sheriffs around the country saying
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  we've got armored vehicles
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  for the American people
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  for the veterans, for the constitutionalists
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  for the gun owners
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  these are quotes, there's the headline
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  Obama administration and UN announced
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  global police force to fight extremism in US
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  and if you read down
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  they have the quotes mobilizing the mayors
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  under munialization
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  that's UN control
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  remember Arnold five years ago
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  big Copenhagen, Denmark
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  world government treaty for the carbon tax
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  and when they couldn't get it passed
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  he said that's fine, I will lead
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  the governor association
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  and the mayor or association
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  he wasn't going to govern anymore but I'm going to organize
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  the mayors mainly to implement
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  carbon taxes, they're now doing it
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  they're now doing it
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  this is, this is the beginning
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  of world war four
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  but world war four
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  because again the Pentagon if you read deeply
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  PNAC as well
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  Rebuilding America's defenses and other documents
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  by top think tanks
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  they call the cold war
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  the middle eastern wars
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  all the other skirmish wars
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  from
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  the end of Korea
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  right through Vietnam right up until
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  9-11
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  they call that world war three
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  this is world war four
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  it's cyber war
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  it's currency war
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  global vaccine bio war
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  it's GMO war
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  it's economic war, it's open borders
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  immigrant flood war
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  it is proxy war
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  it is overthrowing states at an accelerated rate
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  this is
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  in their words
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  look it up
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  world war four
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  we are now in world war four
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  and it just hit me before the show today
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  that I've read all their documents
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  I mean I've gone over their research
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  I've covered this before
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  we talked about the global destabilization program that was coming
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  this is now it
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  this is world war four
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  and this is why we've said
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  you can see the ominous storm clouds
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  you can feel the concern in your gut and your spirit
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  you can see all the signs
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  you can see the preparations
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  you can see it in the world leaders eyes
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  because the globalist that own
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  the mega banks
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  and that own the big central corporations
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  they run the politicians and the generals
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  just want to go play golf
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  and visit their mistress after work
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  some of them want more power obviously
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  and they want a global government
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  so that they can be powerful
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  in that next level
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  and so many of them are very very evil
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  but when you get above the people
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  that are the minions
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  and you get to the real controllers
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  these are very very very twisted
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  very very committed to evil
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  very very wicked
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  very very dark
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  people
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  who serve destruction
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  who serve enslavement
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  and this is their push
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  it's biblical
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  it's not driven by logic
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  it's driven by a crazed
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  blood thirsty
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  surging satanic power
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  and that's why everything's coming out
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  that they keep the Chinese distance alive
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  while they harvest their organs
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  they keep the babies alive while they harvest their organs
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  they put the baby flavoring
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  in the testing systems for the soft drinks
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  and the food
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  they put precursor psychotropics in much of the processed food
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  there's drugs and water
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  drugs in just just everywhere
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  we're all being drugged
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  we are in world war 4 folks
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  you're living in a hardcore science fiction movie
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  cashless societies coming in
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  implantable chips to buy and sell
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  mass hack attacks
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  power outages
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  EMPs all of it
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  they're gonna be rolled out incremental
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  as we fight them
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  we may be able to push them back
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  but you need to understand
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  they're making their move
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  they're trying to bring in the antichrist
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  they're trying to bring in world government
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  they're trying to bring their system to the fore
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  they're trying to give birth
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  and Christians believe they're supposed to lay down
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  and let the devil be born
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  on earth
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  and that they're gonna get teleported up to heaven
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  no you're supposed to resist it
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  my name is Bill Bonner
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  and I'm the president of the largest
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  private news and research network
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  in the world and I paid for this airtime
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  because I have an important
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  message to the American people
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  there's a change coming
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  that the government isn't telling you
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.000]  about this change
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  has deep implications for life
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  in America from where you shop
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  to the doctors you visit
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  and the family you want to protect
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  look I've made predictions like this
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  before
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  thing is I was right then too
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  a few years ago I warned
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  that housing prices would collapse
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  they did
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  before that I warned
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  that dot-com companies would crash
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  they did
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  those who listened had a chance
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  to save themselves
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  but this has nothing to do with the stock market
[20:49.000 --> 20:59.000]  this will affect us all
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  not yet develop their nervous system
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  and are being hammered daily
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  by globalist concoctions
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down

[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  my dad was
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  just this past august
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  I loved my dad but boy was he stubborn
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  he hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  his excuse
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  he simply couldn't afford it
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  he was a man by any means

[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  yes I am trying to be alarmist
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  just like Paul Revere was being alarmist
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  we are under attack
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  this is a takeover
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  this weg is a guess
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  for me
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.500]  then yes at 9 really
[24:27.500 --> 24:29.000]  됐ился
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  well we can keep them into circuit
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  so we can get drink
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  but hate
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  so we ah
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  can keep them from connected
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  nobody can do this
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.760]  it we did
[24:42.760 --> 24:44.560]  we got concerts
[24:42.000 --> 24:42.800]  We got concerts
[24:42.800 --> 24:44.000]  we got concerts
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  we got clear
[24:44.000 --> 24:44.960]  we get popular
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.500]  we have music
[24:46.500 --> 24:48.000]  and for For You
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  enough
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  against violent extremism. And that's the feds doing the ADL and Southern
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.640]  Poverty Law Centers hardcore brainwashing. We have the videos of
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.960]  sheriff's departments and police departments in Austin, Texas, in Kansas
[25:06.960 --> 25:11.000]  City, in other areas where they get up there with straight faces and they're
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.960]  made, the police are made, to go sit and listen to the Southern Poverty Law Center
[25:15.960 --> 25:19.800]  and others. And the ADL gives the police chief's awards and all the rest of it.
[25:19.800 --> 25:23.880]  Even Hollywood stars show up and they actually badmouth the founding fathers.
[25:23.880 --> 25:27.760]  They badmouth the Second Amendment. They badmouth private property. They sit there
[25:27.760 --> 25:31.920]  and talk about the Tea Party like it's criminal. The most conservative,
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.680]  libertarian, lowest crime rate, salt of the earth, red, white, and blue, Fourth of
[25:37.680 --> 25:44.320]  July people. But being Fourth of July is illegal now according to these crooks
[25:44.320 --> 25:49.880]  because they hate this country. Now I'm not saying the police that go to these
[25:49.880 --> 25:53.240]  meetings are bad. Most of them hate it. How do you think we get the
[25:53.240 --> 25:57.120]  information? Most police chiefs don't like having to go to it. But if they don't
[25:57.120 --> 26:03.360]  go, they get removed from office. And now the feds are coming in, taking over the
[26:03.360 --> 26:08.600]  local police departments with United Nations guidelines. Remember the UN
[26:08.600 --> 26:12.920]  saying our PIO should be arrested? Because he arrests illegals that commit crimes?
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.480]  It's so incredible. You arrested illegal who was drunk driving. It's unheard of.
[26:17.480 --> 26:23.320]  They're a bubble as if that's anti-Hispanic or anti-Chinese or anti-Eastern
[26:23.320 --> 26:27.600]  European. I don't care if you're Polish, if you're Mexican, if you're Venezuelan,
[26:27.600 --> 26:32.280]  if you're Russian, if you're South African, black or white. You're out drunk
[26:32.280 --> 26:39.640]  driving, blowing you know 2.0 or whatever it is. You go to jail. But this is how
[26:39.640 --> 26:44.080]  we've already gone under UN control. They're launching on every front. I
[26:44.080 --> 26:46.880]  used to have like one article a week where they're banning the word mother and
[26:46.880 --> 26:50.800]  father. I get like five a day now. I used to get one article a week where they're
[26:50.800 --> 26:57.160]  tearing out old bathrooms and putting in bathrooms for transgender or saying
[26:57.160 --> 27:00.480]  this bathroom's now transgender. So you go in the bathroom, I've now gone into
[27:00.480 --> 27:05.680]  them and you see a woman in the bathroom and you're like what the... You know, I
[27:05.680 --> 27:08.760]  don't... I mean I'll be... I don't want to get graphic here but I don't... I'm not
[27:08.760 --> 27:11.600]  super shy but I don't like being in a bathroom with other men. I kind of, oh
[27:11.600 --> 27:17.120]  goodness, bathroom's empty. You run in there, you know. I just... it's all about
[27:17.120 --> 27:22.480]  messing with us. And now Houston's voting to put in transgender bathrooms.
[27:22.480 --> 27:30.360]  That's our new GDP. Transgender bathrooms. People like, yeah, these liberals are
[27:30.360 --> 27:33.640]  crazy. They're not crazy. They run the show. They tell us how to talk. They tell
[27:33.640 --> 27:39.520]  us how to live. They tell us what to do. They put hardcore Nazis in charge of
[27:39.520 --> 27:45.800]  Ukraine to murder people en masse. Actual Nazis that howl Hitler meet with the
[27:45.800 --> 27:51.520]  vice president. Our media says they're good. But then if you're not a Nazi and
[27:51.520 --> 27:57.880]  you oppose Obamacare, they call you a Nazi. See how sick they are, how evil they
[27:57.880 --> 28:04.880]  are. Playing parenthood, all of it. It's all happening. They're making their move
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.280]  on every front right now and they're doing it because they were a good ten
[28:09.280 --> 28:12.640]  years behind schedule for global government. People are opposing it
[28:12.640 --> 28:20.800]  everywhere. GMOs in trouble. Open borders is in trouble. So they know they've got to
[28:20.800 --> 28:24.320]  complete their agenda and they've got to act like everybody supports it and
[28:24.320 --> 28:33.240]  basically just run a giant con game on everyone. Gallup says that 69% of Hispanic
[28:33.240 --> 28:38.800]  Americans that are citizens but also even non-citizens just polled Hispanics
[28:38.800 --> 28:45.840]  do not want open borders and don't want more immigration. Because they just left
[28:45.840 --> 28:51.120]  the collapsing third world, they know what's happening. It's more like 85% in
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.520]  other polls. But they claim every Hispanic in America wants an open border
[28:55.520 --> 29:00.120]  and you're racist if you don't support it. Or you're racist if you don't support
[29:00.120 --> 29:03.200]  Obamacare or you're racist if you don't turn your guns in. That's what they say.
[29:03.200 --> 29:08.640]  It's racist white people that want guns. Really? I want everybody to have guns
[29:08.640 --> 29:12.760]  including criminals because they're gonna have guns anyways. I want zero gun laws
[29:12.760 --> 29:23.480]  just like we had before 1968. It is absolutely imperative right now ladies
[29:23.480 --> 29:29.320]  and gentlemen that we break out of the trance and realize the Republicans
[29:29.320 --> 29:33.400]  aren't conservative, the Democrats aren't liberal, the top echelon is bought and
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.160]  paid for by crooks who have conquered this nation and now want to conquer us
[29:37.160 --> 29:46.680]  individually. 800-259-9231. Do you believe World War 4 has begun? 800-259-9231.
[29:46.680 --> 29:53.160]  First-time callers. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and
[29:53.160 --> 29:56.720]  the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.240 --> 30:03.360]  Air strikes are not always the surgical maneuvers people envision. In a sense
[30:03.360 --> 30:07.960]  civilians have been killed in another botched raid. This time in Afghanistan.
[30:07.960 --> 30:13.200]  The Washington Post reports of the 19 killed three were children with the UN
[30:13.200 --> 30:17.640]  calling the strike an inexcusable war crime. Doctors without border states that
[30:17.640 --> 30:21.640]  while militants had recently entered the area none were using the hospital for
[30:21.640 --> 30:25.760]  offensive measures. Contrast that with the bombing leaving patients burning in
[30:25.760 --> 30:30.080]  their beds. Add this to the famous story of the wedding that became a funeral in
[30:30.080 --> 30:34.640]  Yemen where 12 people died after an attacking drone confused the party for
[30:34.640 --> 30:39.020]  another group. Other reports from January of this year show the deaths of two
[30:39.020 --> 30:44.080]  hostages including an American citizen in a US drone strike and the father who
[30:44.080 --> 30:47.480]  had his children shot at for trying to save a camera crew who had been
[30:47.480 --> 30:51.640]  mistaken for terrorists. Will this be another example of the military going
[30:51.640 --> 30:58.280]  unaccountable? Only time will tell. You can find more reports on infowars.com
[30:58.280 --> 31:03.640]  Many of the products and infowarslife.com are true game changers. They are
[31:03.640 --> 31:07.600]  compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription. But
[31:07.600 --> 31:11.360]  when we look at a product like survival shield nason iodine X2 it's
[31:11.360 --> 31:15.040]  something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years. The
[31:15.040 --> 31:19.560]  federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form
[31:19.560 --> 31:23.120]  of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that
[31:23.120 --> 31:26.800]  dietary deficiency and iodine was causing. I want to challenge the listeners
[31:26.800 --> 31:30.880]  who have not tried X2 for yourselves. What do you have to lose? You are the tip
[31:30.880 --> 31:33.800]  of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high
[31:33.800 --> 31:37.640]  quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's
[31:37.640 --> 31:41.320]  lives that I know. And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep
[31:41.320 --> 31:45.080]  in stock. We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is
[31:45.080 --> 31:48.800]  about to sell out. It may be a month or two until more comes in. I want to
[31:48.800 --> 31:53.240]  challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on survival shield X2 today at

[33:00.000 --> 33:15.040]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide. We the people.
[33:16.160 --> 33:25.040]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones. Generals
[33:25.040 --> 33:30.560]  gathered. Generals gathered in their masses. Just like witches at black masses.
[33:30.560 --> 33:38.120]  Just like witches at black masses. But it is a big ritual. Evil minds that plot
[33:38.120 --> 33:48.720]  destruction. Sorcerers of death construction. In the field. In the fields of
[33:48.720 --> 33:57.200]  bodies burning. As the loving liberal global war machine keeps turning. But
[33:57.200 --> 34:05.960]  here domestically. It's an organized creeping soft kill poison. With a
[34:05.960 --> 34:10.560]  global of spiders creep up in the night and inject their cultural poison. Their
[34:10.560 --> 34:15.640]  spiritual poison. Their chemical poison. Their biological poison. Their
[34:15.640 --> 34:25.440]  electromagnetic poison. Their aerosol poison. And watch their work as it takes
[34:25.440 --> 34:34.280]  hold and giggle to themselves. Because in the dark they are king. Politicians hide
[34:34.280 --> 34:40.640]  themselves away. They only started the war. Treating us just like pawns and
[34:40.640 --> 34:53.400]  chests. Wait till their judgment day comes. Why should they go out and fight?
[34:53.400 --> 35:02.600]  They leave that to the poor. Or to the robots. You just turn those off when
[35:02.600 --> 35:06.400]  you're done with them. Takes a little more time to turn off the veterans, doesn't it?
[35:06.400 --> 35:12.000]  To decommission them. Put them on the don't treat list. Put them on the death
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.240]  list. Making war just for fun.
[35:24.640 --> 35:34.200]  Wait till their judgment day comes. Yeah. That basis could write some poetry.
[35:34.200 --> 35:38.920]  Alright, let me continue here, ladies and gentlemen. You know, since I mentioned
[35:38.920 --> 35:43.040]  this, I'm just gonna save all this news to the second hour and go to your phone
[35:43.040 --> 35:49.520]  calls. And then in the second hour I'm gonna get to this stack on the open
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.800]  borders invasion. This stack dealing with the globalization and federalization of
[35:54.800 --> 36:02.440]  police. The stack on the move to take our guns, that's now as we knew, full court,
[36:02.440 --> 36:06.000]  the biggest pushover. They're talking about open confiscation, total bans now,
[36:06.000 --> 36:13.320]  Australian style. The ultramassive news on Russia, the GMO news, weather weapon
[36:13.320 --> 36:21.360]  news, and more. We've got world leaders reacting to the trade agreement. It's not
[36:21.360 --> 36:24.600]  a trade agreement, it's a global government takeover. Russia deliberately
[36:24.600 --> 36:31.920]  targeting CIA back rebels in Syria. We're gonna get to a lot more coming up. But
[36:31.920 --> 36:36.440]  let me just read these headlines because this is what could lead to a larger,
[36:36.440 --> 36:42.760]  very, very, very serious conflagration. NATO warns Russia over incursions in the
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.240]  Turkish airspace. American officials, you mean globalist occupiers who call
[36:47.240 --> 36:50.880]  themselves American officials, claim Russia bombing of US back Syrian rebels
[36:50.880 --> 36:55.800]  intentional. Russia has substantial number of troops inside Syria, says NATO
[36:55.800 --> 37:00.200]  Secretary General. Substantial Russian military buildup in Syria taking place on
[37:00.200 --> 37:04.120]  an independent Saudi clerics along with the government call for jihad against
[37:04.120 --> 37:07.600]  Russia and Syria. Oh, I thought they were against the al-Qaeda people they were
[37:07.600 --> 37:14.160]  paying. Fatal look characterizes Russian effort as Orthodox Christian crusade.
[37:14.160 --> 37:22.040]  Marco Rubio wants US to risk war with Russia over Syria. Isn't that just cute?
[37:22.400 --> 37:28.720]  That is just some of the news on the whole Russia front. TPP will restrict
[37:28.720 --> 37:32.920]  internet punish whistleblowers. We're gonna be getting to that report. That is
[37:32.920 --> 37:39.920]  coming up. But just to finish up with the global government takeover. The feds,
[37:39.920 --> 37:44.360]  the globalist, the Pentagon, militarized police, give them a bunch of training.
[37:44.360 --> 37:49.000]  Some of it good, some of it bad. Federal funding, acid, forager, seizure, all the
[37:49.000 --> 37:55.880]  rest of it. They know full well cameras proliferate. Police acting badly, gets out
[37:55.880 --> 38:00.560]  there. The police in many areas act arrogant, circle the wagons. The public
[38:00.560 --> 38:05.800]  has outrage. They use this bubbling revolution to then project it in the
[38:05.800 --> 38:12.080]  controlled media and the Soros run White House to collectively project it on to
[38:12.080 --> 38:17.320]  all police period that are not federal and make it a class warfare class envy
[38:17.320 --> 38:22.800]  Robin Hood scenario. They then glorify the killing of random police in cold
[38:22.800 --> 38:29.400]  blood. That causes the police to further militarize. The feds are there then to
[38:29.400 --> 38:35.160]  give them seminars and training on how to behave and how to act so the feds
[38:35.160 --> 38:39.320]  won't come after them. So it's like breaking someone to make them an
[38:39.320 --> 38:45.280]  informant to make them an operative. And that whole process is happening right
[38:45.280 --> 38:49.160]  now. It's been going on for decades. I mean, Bill Clinton and the Delta force
[38:49.160 --> 38:53.600]  paying off local police and narcotics trafficking and just all the rest of it
[38:53.600 --> 38:58.640]  to corrupt them. It's come out so many times makes my head spin. The drug war
[38:58.640 --> 39:03.680]  has been used for 30 years to corrupt the police to pay him off to get him under
[39:03.680 --> 39:07.840]  full globalist control. Not your average beat cop. It's out revenue generating
[39:07.840 --> 39:11.640]  and responding to your house when there's a burglary or whatever or helping
[39:11.640 --> 39:16.760]  move wrecked vehicles. But the detectives, some of those folks above them, the
[39:16.760 --> 39:24.680]  special task forces, the MJTFs, those are just fabulously corrupt, fabulously
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.840]  evil on average. They're testing grounds to find out who from what
[39:29.840 --> 39:35.160]  departments will play ball and play secret agent. And then out of those
[39:35.160 --> 39:39.600]  groups, they're then brought to the international level and basically
[39:39.600 --> 39:48.840]  sheep dipped into Interpol, the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, Defense Intelligence, or
[39:48.840 --> 39:59.160]  InfoPol9, InfraGuard, clergy response teams, all these shadow spy militia
[39:59.160 --> 40:06.120]  auxiliaries, but they're paid into the giant private network. You know, Napoleon
[40:06.120 --> 40:10.520]  said men would kill themselves and throw themselves onto swords and run
[40:10.520 --> 40:19.200]  into cannons for little pieces of metal and ribbon. And so now to get those
[40:19.200 --> 40:25.040]  badges of honor, metals are only a couple hundred years old. Before that,
[40:25.040 --> 40:28.800]  your group might get a standard or a battle victory and then you were just
[40:28.800 --> 40:32.480]  associated with that group, but it was individual pieces of ribbon, you know,
[40:32.480 --> 40:40.000]  trophies, signants, logos, signants to you. And that's what it is now. I mean, these
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.640]  preachers, these police officers, these people, a lot of times they don't even
[40:43.640 --> 40:47.800]  want pay to get that little federal badge, to get that little federal ID to be
[40:47.800 --> 40:52.600]  given entrance into it. And all they're doing is just getting a giant mass of
[40:52.600 --> 40:59.240]  people that don't even know what's going on to join them. I remember 15 years
[40:59.240 --> 41:04.760]  ago, they were sending Austin police to Japan or to Berlin or to other sister
[41:04.760 --> 41:09.880]  cities to learn about international policing and to help them come here when
[41:09.880 --> 41:13.640]  they want to extradite someone or when we want to extradite someone. Well, that's
[41:13.640 --> 41:17.360]  turning you into an international police officer. And you could argue there's
[41:17.360 --> 41:23.360]  times for that, but then, oh, now you're going to be enforcing UN policy and the
[41:23.360 --> 41:29.760]  UN or Germany might want to indict someone under international law and then
[41:29.760 --> 41:34.360]  you're going to come and arrest that person for their speech. This now happens
[41:34.360 --> 41:38.960]  in the UK. This now happens in Canada. And now it's getting ready to start
[41:38.960 --> 41:45.600]  happening here. And they show up, foreign police with a local liaison and they
[41:45.600 --> 41:55.440]  take you and put you on a aircraft and they fly you out of the country. I remember
[41:55.440 --> 41:59.040]  reading in the Washington Post after 9-11, a top general, it's in my film
[41:59.040 --> 42:04.480]  Masters of Terror. I have a shot in the Washington Post. I say that because I tried
[42:04.480 --> 42:07.240]  to Google it and can't find the article itself even with a headline now. It's not
[42:07.240 --> 42:11.360]  on the way back machine. And it talks about in the article, we've got to deal
[42:11.360 --> 42:15.880]  with foreign troops and the UN to come into America to battle right wing
[42:15.880 --> 42:22.880]  extremists and others and help round them up during a collapse. And it said
[42:22.880 --> 42:27.320]  Mexican and Canadian troops are our main groups we're depending on. Then I saw
[42:27.320 --> 42:34.440]  that in a Canadian paper. And then I was sent by Bernadine Smith of the Second
[42:34.440 --> 42:40.080]  Amendment Foundation out in California, an entire binder that if somebody can
[42:40.080 --> 42:43.640]  find it in our storage sets they get a shiny silver dollar. I've been looking
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.280]  for it for years. I've shown it on air many times. I don't know if somebody walked
[42:47.280 --> 42:51.440]  off with it or what. But the point is all the old news articles back to the
[42:51.440 --> 42:56.440]  60s promoting this and a copy of the New York Times from 1937 calling for global
[42:56.440 --> 43:01.200]  government in 10 regions over America. They're the exact regions just like you
[43:01.200 --> 43:06.800]  can show Nelson Rockefeller back in the 50s and stuff calling for national
[43:06.800 --> 43:11.560]  health care and it's exactly the way Obamacare is. Well, yeah, the Republican
[43:11.560 --> 43:14.720]  Rockefeller Republicans is what they're called. They're the ones that first
[43:14.720 --> 43:21.240]  called for it in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. The Republicans wrote it as a giant
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.920]  screw job. And you tell Democrats that they go, no, they did, no, they didn't,
[43:25.920 --> 43:32.120]  no, no, no boo boo, I get it free. And then they don't get it free and they
[43:32.120 --> 43:38.680]  just still don't care. They're that weak minded. So I'll hit your calls, but I
[43:38.680 --> 43:45.000]  want to just because I mentioned it, go to Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch
[43:45.000 --> 43:51.200]  announces the launch of the Strong Cities Network at the United Nations. It is
[43:51.200 --> 43:54.160]  clear, reading from her speech, that the challenge of, we'll just pull this up on
[43:54.160 --> 43:58.320]  C-SPAN and play it, it is clear the challenge of building reliance against
[43:58.320 --> 44:02.760]  violent extremists that they ship into our countries. A challenge that spans
[44:02.760 --> 44:06.920]  vast oceans and borders, while impacting our most tightly knit cities and towns
[44:06.920 --> 44:10.840]  requires a response that is both wide ranging and highly focused. National
[44:10.840 --> 44:15.080]  governments have a crucial role to play in ensuring the safety and security of
[44:15.080 --> 44:19.400]  the nations they serve. And here in the United States, it's our highest priority.
[44:19.400 --> 44:26.400]  Oh, yes, to protect us. Now let's go to the rest of it. Communities have too
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.760]  often been left isolated and alone. But don't worry, the UN's here to help, folks.
[44:31.760 --> 44:35.580]  Now again, then they bait and switch and flip it on the gun owners, veterans, and
[44:35.580 --> 44:42.840]  Christians, which they admit. But through the Strong Cities Network, see, they
[44:42.840 --> 44:45.200]  can't get Congress to fully bring in world government, though they have
[44:45.200 --> 44:49.880]  partially, so they're going to write the cities with federal funds and the UN. But
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.480]  through the Strong Cities Network that we have unveiled today, House Bloomberg
[44:53.480 --> 44:57.120]  going after your guns through the cities, carbon taxes to the cities. But through
[44:57.120 --> 45:00.880]  the Strong Cities Network, we have unveiled today, we are making the first
[45:00.880 --> 45:05.720]  systematic effort in history to bring together cities around the world to share
[45:05.720 --> 45:11.360]  experiences, to pool resources, that means money, and to forge partnerships
[45:11.360 --> 45:15.800]  outside of state. Where is the legislatures in order to build local
[45:15.800 --> 45:22.000]  cohesion and reliance on a global scale? Today, we tell every city, every town,
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.000]  every community that has lost the flower of its youth to a sea of hatred, talking
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.840]  about shooting. See, this is an anti-gun movement. You are not alone. We stand
[45:31.840 --> 45:38.320]  together and we stand with you. This is a truly groundbreaking endeavor by
[45:38.320 --> 45:42.880]  connecting municipal leaders, facilitating information sharing that's with the UN.
[45:42.880 --> 45:46.320]  This is a UN initiative and providing training and other assistance to
[45:46.320 --> 45:49.920]  violate so many state and federal laws, folks, to be giving this to multinational
[45:49.920 --> 45:54.960]  groups, but turning your local cops into UN operatives. They don't even know it
[45:54.960 --> 45:59.000]  when they're putting your data in the squad car, in the health department,
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.280]  your health data, just everything. This is, and they're only announcing this now
[46:02.280 --> 46:07.240]  because the TPP allows this and Congress will then certify it. See how
[46:07.240 --> 46:12.960]  this works? It's just like Chicago launched Obamacare one year before it was
[46:12.960 --> 46:20.280]  passed exactly as it was finally passed. And other major cities, see, they've already
[46:20.280 --> 46:23.920]  hit the ground running with world government, folks. By connecting
[46:23.920 --> 46:26.680]  municipal leaders, facilitating information sharing and providing
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.360]  training, other assistance were appropriate. The Strong Cities Network will help
[46:31.360 --> 46:35.360]  to fashion a global response to global issue. They're going to globalize your
[46:35.360 --> 46:39.760]  local city and not just the police, every function. Without losing
[46:39.760 --> 46:43.520]  sight of its inherently local roots, oh, of course not. You'll all have lots of
[46:43.520 --> 46:47.280]  local, local on the packaging. It will offer city leaders a way to learn from
[46:47.280 --> 46:52.320]  another about successful scams they've run, about successful initiatives and
[46:52.320 --> 46:56.400]  proceeds and productive programs and money you can get from globalists. It will
[46:56.400 --> 47:00.880]  provide a platform for discussing community policing and preventing
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.640]  strategies that safeguard the individual rights of citizens. That means take
[47:05.640 --> 47:09.560]  citizens rights, but create social justice movements, overthrow the local
[47:09.560 --> 47:13.480]  government, bring in socialist movements with race, war, anti-police
[47:13.480 --> 47:17.320]  activity. This is bring in immigrants, bring in minority groups, forge them into
[47:17.320 --> 47:21.560]  angry chip on the shoulder groups, and then be political weapons of the NGOs,
[47:21.560 --> 47:25.960]  battleground, Texas, other groups. I mean, this is total 100% classic
[47:25.960 --> 47:31.360]  sedition as hardcore as it gets. Let me continue. And it will support the
[47:31.360 --> 47:36.600]  practical delivery of community resilience programs in cities that are
[47:36.600 --> 47:42.200]  taking a new look at the evolving issue. And of course the issue is the police
[47:42.200 --> 47:46.920]  being violent, the police being evil, the police being the source of all problems
[47:46.920 --> 47:52.080]  so that local government can be overthrown by the UN federal initiative.
[47:52.080 --> 47:56.000]  That's what Al Sharpton said. Remember a few months ago he said, we're gonna use
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.440]  these shootings to totally federalize the police, close quote. Well, the feds
[48:01.440 --> 48:05.640]  were captured by globalists, so let's translate that to totally globalize,
[48:05.640 --> 48:13.560]  which they say here five times, globalize your local city. I mean, they used to try
[48:13.560 --> 48:17.880]  this in the 90s. They put up a UN flag in Lansing. They put up a UN flag in LA.
[48:17.880 --> 48:22.920]  People wouldn't believe us when we talk about it on air, even though it was in
[48:22.920 --> 48:29.760]  local paper. But that's not happening. That's what this is. They're going to say,
[48:29.760 --> 48:34.000]  through your city, we will achieve an alliance of nations as a global community.
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.120]  I'm not even gonna read the whole thing anymore. I mean, it just goes on. If you
[48:38.120 --> 48:41.320]  want to know, the administration is deeply committed to ensuring that the
[48:41.320 --> 48:45.680]  strong cities network is as strong, vibrant, and resilient as the cities it
[48:45.680 --> 48:50.280]  unites. And then it just goes on to talk about it. Law enforcement, communities,
[48:50.280 --> 48:57.920]  all of it. This is basically Acorn taking over the police department, taking
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.000]  over the city waterworks, taking over zoning, and just bringing in political
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.040]  correctness and just messing with everyone, stirring up in fighting and then
[49:06.040 --> 49:10.040]  grandstanding over the fighting groups in consortium with the mainstream media and
[49:10.040 --> 49:14.760]  the brainwashing. I mean, it's so unbelievable. I knew it was coming, but
[49:14.760 --> 49:19.880]  it's just over the top. And they're going to give jobs to all these trendies and
[49:19.880 --> 49:23.880]  all these nobodies and all these in fighters to help stir stuff up. I'm going
[49:23.880 --> 49:32.360]  to skip this network break so I have more time for your calls. Just this one today.
[49:32.360 --> 49:34.960]  I mean, I know I get up here and I desperately cover this and I get
[49:34.960 --> 49:39.560]  physically nauseous now because I knew all this was coming. The old timers were
[49:39.560 --> 49:47.560]  100% right, but now it's all here. It's so criminal. I'm not kidding. I may throw
[49:47.560 --> 49:50.800]  up actually. I'm mourning really bad right now. This is not drama. I can't handle
[49:50.800 --> 49:56.040]  this anymore. I never had panic attacks and I'm having one right now, folks. I
[49:56.040 --> 50:00.880]  mean, I live in an actual occupied country with criminals. I mean, they
[50:00.880 --> 50:03.600]  actually put cancer viruses on our vaccines. They're poisoning us. They're
[50:03.600 --> 50:08.280]  now going to force them all of us. They are just totally setting us up
[50:08.280 --> 50:12.960]  for a fall. They hate us. They hate everyone. They are the pure scum. The
[50:12.960 --> 50:16.000]  corporations are going to jack up water prices, power prices. They're going to
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.440]  loot everyone. They're going to hurt everyone. They hate everybody. They are
[50:19.440 --> 50:26.320]  so evil. They are committed to evil. Hold on a second.
[50:31.080 --> 50:35.760]  You know, I have a lot of empathy and it'd be like watching some guy with a
[50:35.760 --> 50:41.800]  big pot belly who weighs 300 pounds and a wife beater beat up his 100-pound wife
[50:41.800 --> 50:47.200]  and his little kids. It'd be like watching someone kick a toddler. But I've
[50:47.200 --> 50:50.160]  watched the racial attacks and stuff where a woman's attacked and her baby's
[50:50.160 --> 50:54.160]  attacked and people are laughing about it and people on, you know, World Hip Hop
[50:54.160 --> 50:57.960]  Star or whatever the website is or saying how great it is. I physically get
[50:57.960 --> 51:03.080]  ill because they've turned people into such scum and the empathy's gone and
[51:03.080 --> 51:10.960]  we're just so barbarous and I physically am threatened by the tyranny. My body
[51:10.960 --> 51:18.960]  knows how much trouble and how much danger we're all in. And that nauseous
[51:18.960 --> 51:22.600]  feeling I have is the feeling I had when I had to, you know, grow it up in rough
[51:22.600 --> 51:26.160]  areas of Dallas, fight somebody that weighed 100 pounds more than me and I
[51:26.160 --> 51:29.920]  just automatically start burning and just get nauseous and just, I mean, it's that
[51:29.920 --> 51:35.960]  feeling of about to fight for your life. Where it's just your arms and your back
[51:35.960 --> 51:41.120]  sounds like it's burning. I mean, I can just, and people just don't understand
[51:41.120 --> 51:46.080]  how much attack you're under. You've got to kick in your instincts. You've got to
[51:46.080 --> 51:51.080]  come out of the trance. You've got to understand this is sick. This is
[51:51.080 --> 51:56.800]  criminal. And no wonder Congress won't do anything. They're being blackmailed.
[51:56.800 --> 52:00.400]  They're being threatened. They're being attacked. But we're fighting back. We're
[52:00.400 --> 52:02.640]  getting rid of the speaker. We're trying to get somebody good in. We've got
[52:02.640 --> 52:07.360]  counties and cities attacking. And then all these bullies show up to try to kick
[52:07.360 --> 52:10.440]  this sheriff out where the shooting happened. If they can kick him out
[52:10.440 --> 52:14.520]  because he's pro-gun, they can get rid of everybody. They hate us. They're not
[52:14.520 --> 52:20.600]  going to leave us alone. They're going to shoot cops in the back until they give
[52:20.600 --> 52:23.920]  up and become federalized. And then they're going to stop shooting you in the
[52:23.920 --> 52:27.280]  back. Then they're going to order you to come arrest the Patriots and then all
[52:27.280 --> 52:30.600]  hell is going to break loose. And police know that now and you better tell
[52:30.600 --> 52:34.800]  everybody else that or these people are going to win. Because it's going to start
[52:34.800 --> 52:38.440]  here at the grassroots. It's going to start with bullying local government and
[52:38.440 --> 52:45.600]  taking it over. People know that I've taken more days off now. I don't take
[52:45.600 --> 52:48.320]  off a lot. I usually do six days a week, but I take off maybe one day a week. So
[52:48.320 --> 52:51.160]  I'm still on five days a week. I shoot a lot of other reports and stuff. And it's
[52:51.160 --> 53:00.480]  because I physically can't handle this anymore. I mean, I know how real this is.
[53:00.480 --> 53:06.800]  I know how right I am. This is not a joke. It's not a game. It's not fun. It is
[53:06.800 --> 53:10.960]  the takedown of this country. It is pure evil. I mean, are we really this bad? Are
[53:10.960 --> 53:14.960]  we really going to get conquered by absolute criminal trash that's going to
[53:14.960 --> 53:20.040]  start a civil war next phase in this country? I mean, really? Really? Are we
[53:20.040 --> 53:23.600]  really going to be dominated by the likes of these people who've all got
[53:23.600 --> 53:28.840]  chips on their shoulders? See, the globalist created a liberation theology
[53:28.840 --> 53:33.960]  with the so-called minorities, and most people didn't buy into it. For once the
[53:33.960 --> 53:38.640]  demographics changed to have a socialist globalist takeover, using that as the
[53:38.640 --> 53:42.120]  impetus at the local level. And what you see with the war on police and the rest
[53:42.120 --> 53:48.920]  of it is just the beginning of the warm-up and the testing of that. Meanwhile,
[53:48.920 --> 53:52.840]  the globalists hate everybody no matter what color you are. And it's all a sick,
[53:52.840 --> 53:56.400]  cynical divide and conquer. And that's the issue I'm getting at. You want to talk
[53:56.400 --> 54:00.840]  about identity politics? How about the identity of these children, 55 million of
[54:00.840 --> 54:04.040]  which have been aborted? How about the identity of the troops of every race,
[54:04.040 --> 54:07.880]  color, and creed being put on don't treat death list? You know when they get
[54:07.880 --> 54:11.600]  away with that now for a year and a half that we know of? They say,
[54:11.600 --> 54:19.480]  we can just go all the way. We have been trained by successive approximation to
[54:19.480 --> 54:29.040]  basically put up with anything. And it's only going to get worse the more we lay
[54:29.040 --> 54:32.200]  down. And the biggest thing we've got to do is declare these people the enemy,
[54:32.200 --> 54:36.120]  declare them to be criminals, declare them to be part of a criminal takeover
[54:36.120 --> 54:40.040]  plot. That's why Obama's countering that. Not be afraid of them and say, we
[54:40.040 --> 54:46.440]  understand the great fear is letting you win. We're all done. Everybody. 99% of us
[54:46.440 --> 54:52.400]  are up a creek without a paddle. If this thing comes in and you just got to come
[54:52.400 --> 54:55.160]  to grips with how bad it is and understand it's worse than I'm even
[54:55.160 --> 55:00.680]  saying it's creeping. It's evil. It's scientific. It's organized. But here's
[55:00.680 --> 55:07.200]  the best part. It's formulaic. Something this big is formulaic is very rigid. We
[55:07.200 --> 55:11.880]  know the attack profile, the scripts they use for agenda 21 for their
[55:11.880 --> 55:15.840]  brainwashing for their county and city takeovers, how their operatives
[55:15.840 --> 55:21.560]  operate, how they act, what they do, how they dangle the grant money. We know
[55:21.560 --> 55:29.760]  them. They can be defeated if they're recognized as the enemy, if they're
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.600]  recognized as the usurpers, as they're recognized as the eugenicist. I'm going
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.120]  to go to break and start the second hour with Jimmy, T. W. Danny, Don, Jim and
[55:39.120 --> 55:49.000]  others. Please tell your friends and family about the broadcast because all I
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.880]  am is somebody covering what they're doing out in the open and warning
[55:52.880 --> 55:55.960]  people. So the key is getting other people to become aware of what's
[55:55.960 --> 55:59.320]  happening. And if enough of us understand the program and just don't
[55:59.320 --> 56:02.800]  support it with our dollars, speak out against it and support alternative
[56:02.800 --> 56:07.360]  systems, this thing will fall. You see Obama up there trying to rally his
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.880]  troops, get out the streets, take over your cities, elect new sheriffs, take
[56:11.880 --> 56:16.200]  the guns, sue the gun manufacturers, you know, forward, get these, they're
[56:16.200 --> 56:22.560]  trying to mobilize their armies of idiots. We have to get mobilized and go
[56:22.560 --> 56:28.400]  out and counter them. They've been losing. We're gaining ground, but this is
[56:28.400 --> 56:32.680]  the Battle of the Bulls, folks, with Jeb Dietrich and the whole nine yards
[56:32.680 --> 56:42.800]  throwing everything they've got us. But they're the bad guys, they're going to
[56:42.800 --> 56:54.960]  lose. They're not going to win. The truth is they're winning personally in
[56:54.960 --> 57:00.440]  their own personal evil to hurt people and be nasty and be bad. Evil doesn't
[57:00.440 --> 57:04.040]  ever win in the end because it's not designed to. It's designed to eat
[57:04.040 --> 57:09.440]  itself. These people are miserable scum. They hate you because they know
[57:09.440 --> 57:12.440]  you're good. They hate you because you're honorable. They hate you because
[57:12.440 --> 57:16.160]  you're happy. They're projecting their disgust for themselves onto you and
[57:16.160 --> 57:21.160]  just realize it's time to stop caring what they think. Briefly, ladies and
[57:21.160 --> 57:24.760]  gentlemen, we have a lot of really high quality products that help fund this

[58:15.880 --> 58:19.360]  less time trying to raise capital if folks just flood our coffers with money
[58:19.360 --> 58:23.180]  because we need to be strong. You know, they're strong with our tax money they

[58:52.720 --> 58:56.800]  entire city has been told not to drink the water. Ohio's governor declaring a
[58:56.800 --> 59:01.560]  state of emergency. Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100
[59:01.560 --> 59:06.920]  gallons of water at home every single day? If there's a water emergency will

[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.520]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:26.200]  Alex Jones. The establishment media is telling you everything's fine as long as
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.880]  you do what they say. I'm telling you they're out to get you and are lying to
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.920]  you and all the polls show the people know that. The public just doesn't know
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.080]  how bad it is and I'm here to tell you 20 years ago I thought I might have been
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.960]  exaggerating to my shelf and I was so naive. It's probably ten times worse than
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.080]  I knew 20 years ago. I was pretty informed compared to the average person 20
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:54.680]  years ago. I mean now
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.080]  I go back to this point that I'm going to your phone calls. I realize it's that
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.560]  the average person is not evil. You might be decadent, you might be lazy, you might be
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:12.360]  stupid, you might be whatever, you might be busy but you don't have bad
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.920]  will for people, you don't want to do bad things, you don't dream up scams, you
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:22.200]  don't want to hurt people. But the folks running things and history shows this when
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:28.680]  we go through these bad cycles tend to be absolutely bloodthirsty and blood
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:35.640]  thirsty means something. They thirst for blood, they thirst for the innocence, they
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:41.280]  thirst to dominate, they thirst to control
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.640]  and we just have to come to grips with that. I just cannot believe it's not a
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.240]  bigger uproar that they're gonna turn our local cities into UN, Southern
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:58.520]  Poverty Law Center, total federalization, brainwashing centers to carry out social
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.600]  warfare through fake social justice garbage. I mean they are making their
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:10.120]  move. Jimmy in North Carolina, thanks for holding her on the ear. Hello Alex, I
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.080]  appreciate all your work you do for the American people. This is just exactly
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.800]  what I was getting ready to call you and talk to you about was our fine attorney
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.640]  general or the Rev. Lynch going to the UN and putting all these things in place.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.720]  They say they're totally going to bypass Congress and when they have their next
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:33.880]  meeting at the UN meeting in Paris, France, that's when they're going to
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.480]  implement all this. What do you think the American people can do to just stop this?
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:47.120]  Sir, I'm not acting. I'm not being a drama queen. I almost threw up. I mean I'm
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:54.520]  mourning that bad right now. I've never done this on air. One time when I went
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.680]  to a CPS meeting and watched the judge take the kid from the family for no
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:05.240]  reason and get off on it, I threw up afterwards. I mean I may have to go
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:10.160]  throw up there on the break. I don't even know what you do. It's so bold but it's
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.360]  also covert and they've already lined their ducks up and it's just it gets
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:20.800]  worse from here. It's so over the top. We warn people. We speak out. We get
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.560]  this information local police departments so they know what's going on because
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.360]  the police again aren't perfect but the reason they're being targeted is they
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:33.560]  tend to be more conservative or more libertarian and aren't going along with
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.200]  this. I mean the Southern Parvy Law Center and ADL been trying forever to
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.520]  turn the police into anti-gun scum. They failed in most cities so now they're
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.160]  just going to turn death squads loose on the cops and kill them until they
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:51.960]  submit to the feds. Is that not evil? Yes it's just plum-sick into me. It is. It's
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.960]  sickening. I used to hear old-timers say I'm sick at my stomach and I think they
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.600]  were just saying that. Now I get it. You get old. You really love your family. You
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.760]  got kids. This stuff makes you sick. I mean what am I supposed to do? Leave the
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:08.360]  country. There's nowhere to go with these bastards. Why are people putting up with
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.240]  it? Sorry go ahead. Yeah they say it's gonna be a global initiative. Oh yeah
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.360]  worldwide. World government's being launched brother.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.960]  You were the only one I knew to call. I've been listening to your radio station and
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:29.720]  I get all your programs on my email and and I thought well I need to call Alex
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.920]  and I mean you're the only one person I know that can get the word out there.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.120]  Well I mean I knew these programs were going on. I knew they were bringing out
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:42.440]  world government this in December but I didn't know this. I didn't know bright
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:46.240]  but reported on this a week ago till they told me about it and then you go to
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.400]  it and there it is. I mean that's because they're moving on every front folks.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.760]  This is a blitzkrieg attack. So good job Jimmy reminding me. We'll be back for more
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.880]  calls.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.960]  The politically correct police are calling for the ban of ham sandwiches.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.080]  That's right. Eating lunch is now considered offensive. The guidelines
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:12.200]  published by Coexist House, a US and UK based interfaith group recommended an
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:16.400]  outright ban of pork products from office kitchens to avoid offending
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.680]  employees of Muslim and Jewish faiths. It would be good etiquette to avoid
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.800]  heating up foods that might be prohibited for people of other faiths, said a
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.880]  University of London professor who wrote the guidelines for Coexist House and
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.320]  this isn't a one-off incident. Back in 2013 a Portland principal pushed to ban
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.400]  speaking about peanut butter and jelly because it's not a popular combination
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.360]  around the globe, saying that Somali or Hispanic students may feel left out of
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.000]  the conversation because they don't eat sandwiches. And a grocery store in a
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.880]  Black St. Louis neighborhood filled with questions of racism for not having a
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:58.200]  sphericist sitting in a tray of water. You can find more reports on infowars.com

[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.000]  Brain force is here. Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months. You
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.480]  probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.160]  because of brain force. There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.960]  food has hidden additives. Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good,
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.960]  you're still damaging your brain. Ultimately we've all been dumbed down to
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.960]  some degree. It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:51.880]  natural things that do it clean. You will find brain force and other game
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:58.120]  changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:03.000]  Many of the products at infowarslife.com are true game changers. They are
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.960]  compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription. But
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.720]  when we look at a product like survival shield nascent iodine X2, it's
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:14.400]  something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years. The
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.880]  federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.440]  of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:26.160]  dietary deficiency and iodine was causing. I want to challenge the listeners
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.400]  who've not tried X2 for yourselves. What do you have to lose? You are the tip of
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.600]  the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.560]  product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.480]  I know. And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock. We
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:45.320]  ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.280]  It may be a month or two until more comes in. I want to challenge all of you in the
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:54.400]  next week to stock up on survival shield X2 today at infowarslife.com or by
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.400]  calling 888-253-3139.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:13.120]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:18.400]  unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:25.640]  complex. I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly. I order all those
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:30.760]  assembled to immediately disperse. It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:35.080]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.760]  those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood. If you see
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.600]  military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed. Guns will
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.520]  be taken. No one will be able to be armed. We will take all weapons. Mr. and Mrs.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.080]  America, turn them all in. Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:57.360]  in a vastly different way. Enough. Enough. Enough. Enough. The Department of
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.160]  Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree. It comes out to like
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:08.200]  1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. NSK SLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered that
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.000]  clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem. Us. So
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.400]  belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.240]  kids belong to whole communities. If you got a business that you didn't build
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:29.400]  that somebody else made that happen. Mercury containing vaccines may help not
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.640]  harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics. Blackhawk
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.840]  choppers soaring through the night sky but this is only a drill. Heavily armed
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:51.080]  officers in Watertown search for the suspect house to house. It's a joint
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:57.680]  military training exercise involving local police also military. I am in my
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.160]  apartment sir. I am inside. I have two words for you.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:13.320]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras. Parents grabbing their
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.000]  children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  then finding themselves face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.880]  rifle. They let them in the area. They told them they could come in and now
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:29.160]  they're coming in like their trespassers punching and shoving people and we're
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:36.840]  not running and we're not backing down if you want a commentator. We are on the
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:44.400]  march. The Empire is on the run. Live from the InfoWars.com studios it's Alex
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:11:04.560]  Jones. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:14.200]  persist. This is the heart of 1776. From the front lines of the InfoWars thank you
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.040]  for joining us. I played that intro we've had for about two and a half years
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:23.600]  because the new launch after our guns is on ten people die last Thursday in a
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.080]  tragic shooting that I haven't even gotten into yet. I'm gonna go back to your
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.920]  calls under the news the bottom of the hour. He now had a website or Facebook
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:37.960]  reportedly showing photos of the pills he was taking. He said I'm taking so many
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.160]  pills so many psychotropic, lithium, other things. I don't even know which ones
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:47.200]  I'm taking I just take like five at a time. Five of each is a quote. Living
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.600]  with mommy on psychotropic is always the same story. Part black part white looks
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.240]  mainly white but CNN still didn't like that so they made his nose smaller his
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.480]  lips smaller and turning white as a sheet so they could say he was a white
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.160]  supremacist and you know that fits the race war narrative they want to push.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.840]  Knowing a mentally ill white person doesn't shoot people or a mentally ill
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.400]  mixed person goes they're just a human or a black person it's their mind that
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:20.400]  matters not what color but they make it about that because they don't want you
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.920]  to know it was motivated against Christians for their faith and that's
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.560]  been confirmed that's all coming up. Meanwhile 50 killed in a knife attack at
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:35.600]  Chinese and it goes over the whole report nine suspects are being pursued
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.520]  after they launched a coordinated knife attack of 50 workers at a Northwestern
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.520]  Chinese coal mine Radio Free Asia and they're always having big massacres
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.800]  without the incident occurred September 18th in the and it's just not getting
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:55.280]  reported because this stuff gets shut down. The attackers are alleged to be
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.480]  Unger separatist after overtaking security guards the attackers killed the
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:05.600]  workers while they were asleep in bunk houses at the so-gone mining operation
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:11.360]  in Akusa another 50 workers were injured the suspects were believed to be
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.880]  hiding in a nearby mountain ravine where a manhunt operation is underway most of
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.920]  the victims were hand Chinese well the obvious answer is banned knives they
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.840]  should get Bloomberg over there right now and there it is from the official
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:32.200]  Chinese Daily News and the London Guardian at least 50 reported to have died
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:40.040]  an attack in coal mine in September and it's just now breaking almost a month
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:48.560]  later but you're not gonna hear about that that's not gonna be some some big
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:54.600]  story world mourns because the world mourns the French and the British I got
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:03.280]  a call the other night at like 10 the producer called me up Nico called up and
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.520]  said hey they want you to get up at 3 in the morning and go to a satellite feed
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:13.840]  to debate Pierce Morgan in England about gun control and of course that shows
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.560]  asking on before I knew it was taped I just said no I'm happy to debate him
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.200]  I'm only doing it live because they will take me and they will edit out what I
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.080]  have to say and I'm not gonna get in a ring with that guy with my hands tied
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:32.000]  behind my back and my legs cut off so he can dance around with his little sword
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.560]  and stab me and act like he had some victory I mean I'm not gonna play
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:42.680]  straw man with that cowardly piece of trash anytime Pierce Morgan who has arm
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.080]  bodyguards where he lives out in LA it doesn't want you to have guns anytime
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:52.640]  that cowardly hypocrite wants to debate me live I will destroy him but I'm not
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:57.720]  gonna go on some show with him where it's taped unless I have a video from the
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.520]  producers saying they won't edit it and then I'm going to sit there in the
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.400]  satellite studio and I'm gonna jack into their feed I'm gonna have an agreement
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:09.240]  to do this and I'm gonna record the debate myself so I can show people what
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.120]  happened and the last time I said that I go nope we're not doing it I said good
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.960]  well don't you want to go on the big BBC morning show and I go don't you want to
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:22.360]  go jump off a cliff no I don't care about you lie to your oppressed
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.760]  population sit there and tell them how horrible it is to own guns and be able
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:31.120]  to defend yourself while your crime rate for violent crime is three times that of
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:37.160]  the US oh yeah crime is higher in Chicago or New York but not in the average
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.920]  American city or town you got three times the crime on average so you sit
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:50.640]  there and believe your British pedophile network you go ahead and believe the
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.120]  pedophiles that run that whole operation been caught running that operation
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.680]  you've caught covering up I'll say this the people that run it covered it up so
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.960]  that means they're involved as far as I'm concerned you cover up a crime you're
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.800]  involved in it you're a I mean of course the globalist hire a bunch of pedos to

[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.520]  cancer

[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:16.360]  Independent at my hotel so when I went down where there was like 4,000 people I

[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.560]  there are no moderate rebels everybody knows that they're just a pass between a
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.200]  fence so the US and others can give the weapons to them and then they give it to
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:25.000]  al-Qaeda that's it so now Glenn is supporting ISIS and the rebels over
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.320]  there so they can kill some more Christians and you can check it out
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.440]  for yourself 938 this morning on the Glenn Beck show that's that's the time
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.440]  frame we're just talking thank you for holding to tell us that TW anything else
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:38.600]  I mean you think I'm getting too hysterical because when I learned
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:43.360]  they're openly going to have at the UN ratified to federalized cities and
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.320]  Congress is doing nothing and the vice president is at the meeting with the
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:52.880]  Attorney General announcing community policing through UN directives with
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:22:00.320]  change agents community organizers Saul Olinsky to break down our cities I mean
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.240]  this is just unbelievable to bring the UN in and again the police do bad stuff
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:09.920]  they have problems I'm against the police state but to then have the answer be
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:15.960]  bring in the United Nations into America that's just over the top and you know
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:20.000]  it's it's all coming it's it's time to draw near to the Lord because it's
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.800]  it's it's we're on the doorstep right now yeah we really are and again they'll
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:28.760]  just bring in the UN and suddenly the UN's on TV announcing and suddenly
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.480]  they're talking about extremists they put me up there somebody else up there
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.240]  and they talk about the internet we got to protect you and they just you've
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:39.760]  seen the Democrat supporters in Austin and in San Diego and in LA where we've
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.720]  gone out and you go to Democrat area nine out of ten say put gun owners in
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.440]  forced labor camps nine out of ten say take people's free speech nine out of
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:54.280]  ten say forcibly inoculate nine out of ten I mean these people are totalitarians
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:23:02.000]  they are just as cult like as a Soviet soldier or a Nazi soldier I mean they
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.840]  will do anything they're told the differences they're not tough like a
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:14.200]  Nazi or Soviet soldier they are just the stupid weak cowardly bizarre arrogant
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:21.480]  narcissistic weirdos you watch all those countless videos there's like 20 of them
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.840]  now that I've seen and it's always different plan hood national directors
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:30.440]  or directors of their board or local regional directors or national health
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:33.840]  directors and they're just slurping wine and eating and laughing about dead babies
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:40.200]  and giggling and and just getting off on it and there are gods I guess they should
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.120]  get off on it they're all chicken neck they're ugly they're weak they're
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:49.280]  demonic they rule because we submit thank you TW Don and Illinois you're on
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:55.800]  the air go ahead hello Alex yes sir thanks for holding go ahead oh sure yeah
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:00.360]  I just had a little story I wanted to relate to you in the audience about things
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:03.960]  I think the story that coincides with a lot of the larger issues you've been
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:10.760]  talking about for the last few years I went to a art gallery to see a friend
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:18.160]  who had a show there I'm hanging out and I start to chat up this cute girl at the
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:22.920]  at the at the gallery and we start to get talking back and forth about some
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:26.560]  stuff I you know it eventually gets to what do you do for a living she tells
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:31.480]  me she's a social worker so that's interesting you know and the kind of
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:36.600]  social work are you doing and she says well I'm helping some of the migrants
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:43.320]  facilitating getting legal health housing the whole in the whole you know the
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.080]  whole nine yards of it for people yeah that's all been announced free health
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:53.560]  care free everything and again sure I get helping people from horrible
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.440]  countries but it's meant to draw him here to make them become political weapons
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:03.480]  and we are going bankrupt by design cloward pivot go ahead the kicker so I
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:09.040]  figured she was working for some kind of NGO or something like that but I say so
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:14.720]  who do you work for and she gives me this cute sort of sheepish look and she
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:20.000]  says well I'm working for general dynamics and I had to stop myself from
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.520]  having my jaw fall down and I was like is that right and what would you know it's
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.760]  just put my mind in a spin about what could what would a large industrial
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.240]  military industrial company like that be doing facilitating the movement of
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:41.280]  legal aliens over our borders and then planting them in cities like this
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:48.640]  floundering town Chicago and it was really just something else and I just
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.080]  wanted to tell that story I've been sitting on that for a couple of months and
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:58.320]  I wanted to call in and just you know I think that that that little anecdotal
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:04.440]  story you know speaks a lot all of the issues you've been talking about and
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:10.280]  it's just amazing why would that be I guess they're located in Texas but you
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:17.160]  know as far as all of the you know all of the the money that's you know the
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:21.720]  secret black budgets that go to all of these security companies absolutely
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:27.200]  people aren't really buying $800 hammers or $700 toilet seats whenever you see
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.680]  these different aircraft that you know cost a billion dollars a piece that's
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.400]  not true it's going to all sorts of secretive operations and yes I didn't
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.680]  know about that particular company General Dynamics but they've got the
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:44.440]  major Protestant churches the Catholic Church they've got thousands of
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:51.200]  corporations I know of basically mopping up all the collapsed areas of the US and
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:54.640]  then then they're putting immigrant populations in but not getting them to
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.320]  plant gardens or build factories then that actually would be probably fine
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.480]  they're they're just becoming welfare heads and being given driver's license
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:07.520]  and voter ID cards to secure the corporate takeover of America once the
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.240]  demographic goes to enough point to have a checkmate vote with the immigrant
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.080]  population they're going to shut the borders they're going to use the
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.600]  backlash against it to create a total police state they're going to inject all
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.480]  the poor people with Gardasil and sterilize them so again these people are
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.080]  victims as well they're being used we need to be clear but again water is a
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:30.560]  wonderful thing if somebody's got a fire hose of it though cramming it down
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:34.400]  your mouth it'll blow your guts out your hind end don't mean to be gross so I'm
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:39.100]  all for water I love H2O but I'm all for these immigrants but they are like a
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:41.640]  fire hose crammed on our throat it's going to kill us it's going to kill them
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:49.720]  too so I'm telling you you've got to be the warrior I would go back I would talk
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:55.960]  to her again I would secretly record her I would I'd get to know her I mean I
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:59.000]  don't want to call this espionage against the globalist because terms mean
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.280]  things but that's not what it is we got to start playing hardball and I'm
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:11.520]  somebody who has got more than I can shoot and believe me I mean if I had
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.720]  time to go out and do myself investigative journalism I mean knowing
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.640]  that I know now problem is I'm people know who I am people didn't know who I
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.600]  was I could go out and blow major operations on them all day long we think
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:26.320]  of spies like James Bond who's just totally handsome and can do back flips
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.400]  and is this ninja no it's people that are motivated by truth telling the truth
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.200]  taking action like the mom and pop organization it's blown open Planned
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:39.440]  Parenthood they had the initiative they were empowered they took action and so
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:44.280]  you could call it undercover story Chicago and just go out and interview
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.280]  these leftist change their names and show how they all really work for defense
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:53.200]  contractors and big oil listen go to an environmental movement thing find out
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.920]  who actually runs them most the time it's an oil company I mean it's just so
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:04.320]  crazy when you actually find out how fascist this situation is but great job
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:10.160]  calling in with the report but you're human I mean you are the people on the
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:14.560]  ground and I would just take photos I would talk about it I would get in to
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:18.640]  know these people then I would educate her about what she's really part of and
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:23.240]  a lot of times you can turn these people towards the light and then really get the
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:29.520]  big scoop I bless you I appreciate your called on amazing story Danny you're up

[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.640]  offensive measures contrast that with the bombing leaving patients burning in

[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:38.760]  news tonight and just a data load like a hammer hits me in the head I know in the
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.360]  Canadian government studies two of them British studies Japanese studies you can
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:47.520]  pull these up to type in study shows flu shot doubles your chances of catching
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.280]  flu next year
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:59.640]  or the way they say it having a flu shot increases risk of catching flu that
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:06.080]  that'll bring up the studies and I know they've never in 60 years of flu vaccines
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:11.480]  ever guessed the proper mutation for the main flu strain it's totally worthless
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:16.280]  every year they admit oh it's not that effective
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.880]  ABC News new study confirms flu vaccine really does increase your risk of
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:28.480]  serious pandemic I'm gonna add Dr. Blalock on 20 years ago I was having him on
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:33.000]  when he was still a brain surgeon top brain surgeon invented a bunch of stuff
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:40.480]  ran a university best-selling books newsmax writer and he said diet soda makes
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.400]  you fat I've written three papers on it it's excited toxicity they put it in
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.280]  there in the rat studies with Searle they knew it made the monkeys and the
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.960]  rats more hungry they would consume more and then it destroys their
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:58.320]  endocrine system blah blah blah 15 years after he said that on my show it was
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:04.440]  in CBS news ABC News you name it headline diet sodas make you fat and
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:11.080]  they're designed if they have aspartame in them to hurt you they couldn't get
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.240]  them approved in the 70s because it killed most the Reese's monkeys they
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:22.400]  fed it to I'm gonna say that again it killed them at the doses they were
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:30.680]  giving them and it was put in their meals every day but I mean it grew
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:37.280]  cancers like miracle grow grows big fat tomatoes how can diet sodas make you
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:41.000]  fat study explains it and then they always spend it like they call TPP a
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.560]  trade deal no it's a global government treaty they always call it diet sodas to
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:50.360]  confuse you and then it's aspartame that they're talking about it makes you
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:55.320]  hungry your body thinks it's getting something sweet it still has an insulin
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:05.680]  response it totally screws you up it's a drug I can't get family I have to
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.560]  quit drinking and I'm not on a high horse folks I do bad things to my body
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:12.520]  too but I know they're bad
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:18.200]  but if I drink a diet soda I get a headache for a day other people though
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.040]  addicted it's a toxin and I'm gonna go to your calls and get into the news it's
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:30.840]  just that I get set photos and videos of I'm talking you know a hundred people
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:37.480]  wind up a big long line of people hundreds total going through to get
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:42.960]  their flu shot knowing they had studies a decade ago that if you take three flu
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:48.680]  shots after the age of 50 it was the study you double your chances of all
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:57.840]  timers that was a main line study and was national news and then the flu shot
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:07.600]  today isn't even the flu shot it's nanotech recombinant bizarre the H1N1
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:13.920]  vaccine they admitted was a tracker vaccine a simulant virus they'd
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:21.000]  released a year before oh by the way speaking of vaccines this is in the
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.600]  news they have caught you can look this up the United Nations and others adding
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:35.320]  sterilants or fertility anti-fertility treatments they don't want to completely
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.120]  remove fertility from everybody or it becomes too obvious these are a
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:45.840]  percentage of people and in some cases it's designed to act in a few years so
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:50.800]  you don't know why and this is all in the official UN documents but this is out
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:39:01.160]  of science news today DNA vaccine sterilizes mice could lead to one-shot
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:12.640]  birth control like let's actually pull up the publication itself if we can animal
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.800]  birth control could soon be just a shot away a new injection makes male and
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:21.160]  female mice infertile by tricking their muscles into producing hormone blocking
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:27.960]  antibodies this is exactly what they got caught adding to the tetanus shot in
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.800]  Africa and India in the 90s where it creates an autoimmune response during
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:38.080]  second trimester to cause a spontaneous abortion in the approach works in dogs
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.760]  and cats research and say it can be used to neuter and spate pets and to control
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:47.160]  reproduction in feral animal populations a similar approach could one day spur
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:51.320]  the development of long-term birth control options for humans this looks
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:55.640]  incredibly promising sin William Swanson director of animal research at the
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:01.280]  Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden in Ohio and they're very excited about
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:09.000]  the approach to get their researchers have already created vaccines that
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.520]  trigger an immune response in animals oh an autoimmune oh what's that Gardasil do
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:19.960]  oh you're not gonna hear Metro Laraza tell the senior readers not to take it
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.800]  only the racist fat dumb gringo I'll tell you cuz he hates you he's racist the
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:31.440]  response produces antibodies that block yep this is it GNRH that's the one they
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:34.360]  got I didn't read this article when they gave it to me today I just looked at it
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.400]  and I said oh I know what that'll be I'm not bragging I should read it but there
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.240]  you go same deal far told you just I'm saying they're just announcing their
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:47.880]  bio weapon I mean I'm not being arrogant I mean I'm just saying I've seen this so
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:51.480]  on another next move before it even happens but then I kind of get blind to
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:55.680]  it because I only read the first two paragraphs you got hundreds of articles
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:59.200]  I just scanned it and I thought oh I wonder what this is so we're kind of
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:02.160]  discovering it together and oh it's the same old one they got caught adding to
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:05.160]  the tetanus shot see there you go
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:17.440]  the response produces antibodies that block the releasing hormone GNRH
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:21.080]  required by mammals to turn on the pathways just for the egg or sperm
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:25.200]  development so this blocks it in the first trimester the vaccine in the
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:31.640]  class inducing deer contraception gona con have been shown to effectively work
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:35.640]  at both male and female birth control and animals but like many human
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:39.080]  immunizations the vaccines rely on an immune response that eventually dwindles
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.080]  away forcing the use of booster shots every few years
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:46.400]  biologist Bruce Hay of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:51.440]  colleges took a different approach to blocking GNRH rather than rely on animals
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.160]  immune system to create antibodies he and his colleagues engineered a piece of
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:00.160]  DNA oh genetic engineering they call it a vaccine but it's not it's reengineering
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:06.160]  your body that when packaged inside interactive virus shells oh that sounds
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.960]  like it won't have any side effects are injected into mice turn the muscle cells
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:17.040]  into anti-GNRH antibody factories that's turn your muscles into cancer because
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:22.480]  just gives you cancer basically this is so evil but take all your shots you
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:27.640]  idiots because muscle cells are some of the longest lasting in the body they
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:33.040]  continue to churn out the antibodies for 10 years or more
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:36.360]  doesn't matter if it can kill you from autoimmune disease and that's what
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.840]  Gardasil is doesn't matter if it causes you to bleed out every orifice you know
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:44.360]  that's just a small percentage it works a little too well on oh we just meant to
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:49.920]  kill your reproduction not kill you sorry hope you enjoy that tracheotomy we
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:58.080]  love you so much we care about you and your family so much oh I have to be
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:06.080]  cynical and evil about it or I'm gonna jerk right I'm sick of these people okay
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.960]  I got a mid-air refuel here and then we'll go to your phone calls and then
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:13.400]  I'll get to the news next hour I promise if I can handle it if I already read
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:15.560]  all this news I don't know if I can handle it I don't know if I can look at
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:22.360]  it anymore people are like man this guy's full of drama I see the YouTube
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:28.000]  comments you know what I'm a human I care about 10 million women plus a
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.800]  year in Latin America being injected with this stuff okay I care about it
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:37.080]  happening here in America I'm pissed I'm physically sick over it I want to beat
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:41.720]  people's asses okay I'm just gonna be completely honest with you I'm thinking
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.800]  about them over at that city convention center lining up all the idiot city
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:48.200]  employees right now and I just wanted to start screaming I want my listeners to
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:51.840]  get down there and stand out front it's the one across the river it's the one
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:54.360]  on the south side it's there's just two big invention centers what are they
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:44:00.960]  called we need to look it up it's the city it's the city's own little

[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.120]  their shot and I'll be sitting in a restaurant here and all people talk about
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:32.240]  getting their shots and I'll look at my name that old they look completely blown
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:36.520]  out of their minds I mean look lady if you want to get a city paid for a
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.520]  lobotomy go ahead

[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:25.760]  apologize to Danny for making him hold so long we'll go to other folks here in a
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:29.720]  moment as well Danny and FEMA region 6 what former state are you under an
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:38.320]  occupation yes so I'm under the former state of Texas all right welcome go
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:44.040]  ahead yeah also a former republic as you know yeah first of all I just want to
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:51.520]  say I'm really well done on the brain force and yeah total flam dunk I
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.800]  actually think you guys should do special with the the brain force and the
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:01.960]  knockouts because I've got both of them in my war chest kind of a yin and yang
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:06.520]  quality there how did how did knockout work for you this was not a stage call
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.920]  you called in on World War three current events but you get to that in a
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:16.800]  moment but how is knockout work for you it it turns me into an infant basically
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:23.400]  and yeah I mean it basically just transports me to a place where I'm
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:27.600]  pretty much floating on a cloud drifting off to sleep yeah it's done that a few
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.520]  times for me when I take like two of them but then sometimes I don't want to get
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:35.320]  up eight hours later I I tend to take one and it's just got nine known
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:40.320]  ingredients to get you into deep sleep things like valerian melatonin L trip to
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:45.120]  fan a lot of other folks have said the same thing about it you know they're in
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.280]  there because it's a very powerful smell I'm not saying it's not the pill
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:53.840]  smells great but it smells like some real stuff oh it's real we go out and
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:57.920]  get the most concentrated most organic most expensive we can and then sell it
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:01.400]  for really low prices because even the most expensive of those ingredients is
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:06.400]  not that expensive so that's what we can offer it for $15 is because it is so
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:14.000]  good and then what was your experience with the brain force oh man it's it's
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.600]  it's just it's great I mean it's like it I've pretty much stopped drinking coffee
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:26.760]  and you know but actually the weird thing is that I I'll get these I'll get
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:32.920]  these memories coming in that I haven't thought about for free like like over a
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:36.920]  decade yeah I'm not gonna make any claims about it folks should try it out
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:40.360]  and it's just I think it's 10 ingredients that are like the most known
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:44.360]  couple of ingredients are like building blocks of the brain least one of his
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:50.120]  prescription in Europe and it does have the Urbimate which is a different type
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:54.840]  of caffeine it's a low dose but it helps kind of trigger all of it so it does
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:57.920]  does have a little bit of that in there but it just doesn't have the crash is
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:01.400]  why I like it thank you so much for the review of that what do you want to say
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:06.120]  about World War three current state and new World Order info yeah well I have a
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:11.520]  pretty basic question for you which is you know I've heard you say especially
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:18.600]  you know like as this year has gotten weirder and heavier about how the
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:24.880]  globalists are like from 10 to 15 years behind in their plan and then you had the
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:31.680]  guest on on October the 1st talking about Joel Scalzen and he was saying
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.400]  well the new developments with Russia dropping the bombs this year that has
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.280]  now put them more behind their plan and then lastly I was just gonna say I was

[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:16.160]  wouldn't mention a bunch of news but I've got to get the big push for open
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:21.640]  borders worldwide the escalation with right Russia and NATO Obama
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:25.320]  administration calling for UN takeover of local governments I mean this is just
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:32.200]  insane we're gonna get into so much more as well but we've got Hillary gearing up
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:36.120]  to go after Biden there is a lot and I'll continue with calls as well in the
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.560]  next hour Danny you asked a lot of questions there go ahead and recap
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:44.160]  those and then what was the final one you were bringing up flight 93 and
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:49.480]  Shanksville this still my if I could just distill my question it would be what
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:55.000]  is the importance of the of the timeline in this whole end game and if it gets
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.200]  pushed back or if it's not achieved then how many contingency plans are there
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:05.600]  it and what are the stakes basically of the timeline if they're behind now you
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.080]  know and all that stuff well they know worldwide they've lost the people's
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:14.440]  trust so now they're just announcing to talitarianism in Europe in the US
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:18.080]  saying it's a good thing yes we're gonna arrest you for your speech yes you
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:21.240]  don't have freedom now so they've gone from saying we're here to defend your
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.240]  freedom to more and more they're trying to just hide in plain view that okay
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:30.600]  we're just gonna do what we want now but even local state governments regional
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:34.320]  governments don't want to go along because they want prosperity so there's a
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:38.640]  globalist movement towards austerity world government eugenics and then
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.160]  another movement that just wants prosperity doesn't mean it's perfect
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:46.200]  doesn't mean it's not corrupt but there are folks that are self-interested and
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:51.000]  don't like business being destroyed so there's a real fight going on in the
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.800]  elite right now number one clearly they've been lining up gearing up for
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:01.200]  something big this fall this winter into next year you now see all craziness
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:07.600]  breaking loose as we've been predicting because you could see the movements it's
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:10.720]  like seeing a bunch of ducks fly overhead you know in the fall and you go
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:15.360]  that a cold front's coming in next week here comes the cold front the ducks know
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.840]  when to fly you can see all the action you can see all the preparations you
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:25.240]  can see the statements being made and so they're trying to compress all this
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:31.560]  stuff and it's getting reckless there they're getting exposed which makes
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:36.440]  them only get more aggressive so the stakes are everything this everybody
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:42.640]  can feel it right now because we're in danger of regional war expanding into
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:47.760]  multi-region war between a whole bunch of different countries and that's called
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:53.600]  world war I appreciate your call but if you expand on that the globalist call
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.480]  this world war four when I said last hour world war four has begun that's a
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:03.160]  think tank idea from ran corporation the army war college and others that it's
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:10.480]  cyber war economic war culture war immigrant war proxy war but they said
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:16.280]  we were in the beginnings of world war four this is now it we're now entering
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:21.040]  world war four and it's by multinational corporations against each other and
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:26.500]  against everybody else all cheating all stealing all lying in alliances that
[01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:31.440]  are always changing to see who can get control of the global government but
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:34.440]  none of them want to shut down the global government because they've all
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:39.680]  invested in it they've all built in it and they all get power from the power
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:44.000]  they've given to it they all give power to the beast government and then they
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.520]  get monopolies they get special treatment they get insider deals they get
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:54.920]  diplomatic immunity by giving power to the beast but still they try to cheat
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:58:00.560]  each other as they go up jockeying to be the capstone well they're not gonna be
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:06.000]  the capstone the god of death is the eugenics lord the one that would be god
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.360]  the one that wants to play god a very small number of the elite as his top
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:16.440]  henchmen his top generals these people are building their destruction and most
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.720]  of them admit that and just go isn't it gorgeous isn't it wonderful I give
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:25.640]  myself to it I mean folks believe me believe me folks at the highest levels
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:29.080]  people know and a lot of them are freaked out and hiding out and don't want to be
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:34.680]  part of because when the world government finally gets in place the real

[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:57.800]  and then went over there I'm definitely going to have to play a clip or
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:00.560]  something do we have one of those special reports coming back from the next
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:07.680]  break all right this is this is now in a complete twilight zone hey but we got a
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:12.440]  new article up on info wars Obama arms ISIS militants pushes gun control on
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:17.960]  very same day Obama authorizes a resupplying Syrian opposition on same
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:22.240]  day he demands gun control against American citizens and of course I was
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:25.040]  covering this Breitbart article a lot that I missed I missed up all the time
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.360]  I mean I knew they were doing this but I know they were actually openly doing it
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:34.240]  Obama administration and you and announced global police force to fight
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:38.480]  extremism in US and then we've got all these callers that want to talk to me

[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:48.320]  Limbaugh so I would imagine he could come over here and actually host the show
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:52.360]  for us except he's not really here what if we put a microphone into the darkness
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:56.880]  coming out of the break and folks can do a voice print analysis to see if it's
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:04.960]  Matt Rush he's not gonna do it I'm telling you this is so classically
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:10.760]  reclusive I wish I could do that he is back there right now I know it's taking
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:14.200]  a lot of work to get to this point I admire you maybe I should become
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:20.000]  reclusive huh he's a big guy in good shape to I was like man who is that big
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.240]  guy who is that I recognize that guy who's that with him I was like oh my god

[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:40.000]  a lot of class the way he pulls stuff off I'm kind of the opposite like a bull
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.560]  in a china shop a loose cannon anyways I was already super wound up today I've
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:49.200]  already had too many DNA forces today and this is now just pushing me over the

[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:21.240]  did it is even worse and then it's gonna be even worse when they have like some
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:26.040]  major establishment White House driven publication saying I made it all up so we

[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:19.360]  unable to wake from that dream how would you know the difference between the

[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:32.040]  the answer is up there Neo it's the question that drives us what is the
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:38.360]  matrix the matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:44.520]  from the truth what true human beings are disease you are a cancer of this
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:52.200]  planet we are the cure they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:56.480]  million people in these re-education centers and when I say eliminate I mean
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:59.000]  kill
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:10.400]  the matrix is a system Neo that system is our enemy when you're inside look around
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:16.440]  what do you see businessmen teachers lawyers carpenters the varying minds of
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:20.600]  the people we are trying to save but until we do these people are still a part
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:25.640]  of that system and that makes them our enemy have to understand most of these
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:31.240]  people are not ready to be unplugged and many of them are so inert so hopelessly
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:37.520]  dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it we are trained to
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:40.720]  deceive if we have to you shouldn't trust me I will paint the net our
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:48.600]  propaganda was beginning to pay off and our Lord save you for rock over

[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:13.280]  captain of a scientific technological elite these people are coming for
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:17.240]  everybody I'm not gonna wait around to be soft killed I don't wait around to
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:22.440]  watch my family die around me I'm gonna die fighting take the blue pill the
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.880]  story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to be you take
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:35.920]  the red pill you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes

[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:51.240]  stop being a moron stop being dishonorable within 15 years they say
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:57.960]  CNN that everyone will be merged with the scenes or will be obsolete I'm not
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:02.080]  gonna sit here and take it anymore
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:10.920]  welcome to the real world all right folks Alex Jones here back live well into
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:14.480]  the third hour I did not do this as a stunt neither the Matt Rudge he is here
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:18.200]  we got a hot mic over there he wants to stay literally in the shadows behind a
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.360]  curtain but this is the king of being able to push the story out and make it
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.640]  the number one story in the world they even admit that in New York Times that
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:31.200]  he has more readers on politics and news than Facebook the New York Times and
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:34.880]  the Washington Post LA Times put together he's got some of our stories
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:39.360]  where the shooter himself said he was on a bunch of drugs he's linked to that
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:42.880]  today and that's the story they don't want out there or the story we're seeing
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:47.200]  in took a mixed racial Christian hater and turned him into a right-wing white
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:51.040]  supremacist and turned him white they don't want people knowing that but Matt
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:55.440]  drudge and his great crew can link to alternative stories foreign stories
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:00.800]  mainstream stories photos mug shots and really just focus on what Matt drudge
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:04.120]  thinks is interesting and the public tends to agree with him that what he
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:09.600]  focuses in on is really catching the zeitgeist are the pulse of the people so
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:14.680]  he might have 50 links every day where Facebook has 500 million but he has more
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:20.400]  traffic that is the true David versus Goliath story and this is not scripted I
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:25.200]  have no idea where I should go Matt drudge I guess you're here for ACL or
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:29.760]  why are you in Austin Texas well you were just talking about Facebook and
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:36.320]  thanks again for having me here I'm not on Facebook I don't do the socials I've
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:40.560]  got that little Twitter thing even that's kind of disgusting you know I've
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:43.560]  been doing the internet as long as you've been doing this radio show Alex
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:47.920]  literally every day as you have literally every day practically I think
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:51.320]  you've taken a little more time off than I have actually yes I've kind of I can't
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:56.360]  say that about many people because you are a peer without peer and I'll tell
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:01.560]  you I was there before Facebook I was there for before CNN.com I was there
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:10.280]  before mostly all of them I have a very clear perception what the internet is in
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:16.800]  my mind I'm free I'm not defined by what they say the internet is meaning
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:20.360]  Goldman Sachs meaning who they invest in for the latest startup meaning the
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:25.400]  latest Buzzfeed or Salon or Gawker all well Gawker is more independent but
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:31.200]  there's a lot of corporate makeover of the internet that I have not adapted to
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:36.960]  simply put I'm friends with some of them when I go to New York I make the 6th
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:42.760]  Avenue rounds but I am not a part of that system I am a free thinker I'm an
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:52.200]  American I'm very concerned with what's happening so I just give him my all I've
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:57.880]  learned how to take care of myself and detach from outcomes because otherwise
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:02.320]  you can't survive and I don't know where you are on that topic that I just
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:05.920]  follow my instinct because they always tell us how to adapt to be successful
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:10.840]  but really we're just adapting to their mindset I don't I don't know you don't I
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:18.240]  have remained completely independent from all of them all of them I am not
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:24.400]  influenced by any of them I need no traffic from Google I don't care if I
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:29.840]  get one traffic referral referral from Google or Bing or Yahoo or any of these
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:35.800]  others it's always been that way now if you think of that setup how rare that is
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:41.000]  because everybody is so hungry for referrals for likes I don't need to be
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.760]  liked I don't need to be liked at all I don't care if there's a button right
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:48.800]  there at the top of drudging like or dislike thumbs up thumbs down doesn't
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:54.320]  mean anything now I hope that you come doesn't mean you necessarily have to
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:58.120]  like what I have up there now where I've had a lot of success as I'm getting
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:01.680]  people from both sides of the aisle they've always had always a right-wing
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:05.280]  gossip monger mainly because of Lewinsky in those years which by the way
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:11.160]  are back why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers excuse me why aren't we seeing
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:17.000]  Hillary's lovers it's good question where's the cover-up on this so many
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.600]  issues that are suppressed on a daily basis so that's what I try to do every
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:27.440]  morning incredible well it's amazing to have you here in Austin Texas and I
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:31.800]  tell you you certainly know how to make an entrance I'm in a 72nd break and I
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:38.400]  turn around and there's Matt drudge just boom I tell you I almost had a heart
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:42.640]  attack a good one my cousin said he's never seen me look like that what was
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:49.000]  the word Buckley you used and then I was flabbergasted I was flabbergasted use
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.560]  the word flabbergasted well I I tell you this is like the biggest Christmas
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.680]  present early ever because I just admire true independence I gotta tell you Matt
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:59.720]  and you know this with your crew and Congress knows this we wouldn't have
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:02.920]  won some of these gun battles some of these border battles some of these
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:06.760]  energy battles and we've lost some too but we would have lost so many of them
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:10.160]  if it wasn't for the focal point and even the White House and the Democrats
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:13.040]  admit because I know you're saying you're nonpartisan I mean I would guess
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:16.240]  you're more of a libertarian correct me if I'm wrong just a freedom guy I can't
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:22.520]  be controlled I cannot be controlled there are no interests here but what I
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:27.960]  see as the world events period that is the truth of the situation well they
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:32.640]  hate the fact that they can't control the agenda the Pentagon has briefings
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:37.600]  with the head of psyopsis you know saying we've got to stop drudge changing
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:40.920]  the subject and showing when we're lying I mean that's when you know that's
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:45.240]  them that's crazy town when you get what is it like is it surreal to think back
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:48.480]  to something you started back in the early 90s has now grown into this well
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:52.760]  no because it's been every day so it's just like it's it's happened so
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:57.320]  organically it started with one reader I don't know who that one reader was but
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:02.480]  it started with one reader I've never placed an ad anywhere ever this has all
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:07.800]  been a true organic reader to reader to reader to reader yes I dabbled in the
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:11.240]  corporate with the Fox News show in the clear channels a clear channel radio
[02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:17.880]  show for nine years but even that the website was on its own terms and remain
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:22.480]  so to this very million only gotten bigger since you stopped I don't know
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:26.880]  because this is another thing what the measurements that we have this is another
[02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:33.000]  bogus thing yesterday they released on the AP a wire Twitter followers Hillary
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.640]  is the queen of the Twitters with four point nine million knit they don't say
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:39.920]  how many are fake they don't have this how many are they admit the first ladies
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:44.320]  is like 80% that the AP did not do that Alex so this whole thing this whole
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:49.200]  socials these socials you know beats one music which I'm obsessed with which has
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:53.080]  been launched on Apple which is probably one of the best things they've done
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:58.520]  since Steve Jobs died one radio station interesting they don't know how many
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:02.080]  listeners they have I heard some streams they were down to five thousand an hour
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:09.920]  this whole social media stuff is bogus Facebook we have two billion users this
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:15.880]  is garbage this is designed to demoralize the individual I'll never have
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:20.600]  two billion followers the internet is what you make of it it's the same battle
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:23.400]  as it was in the beginning I remember having this argument with Britt Hume
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:28.680]  once live on C-span he goes oh the internet's all UFOs and all this crap and
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:31.080]  I said no the internet is what you make of it in the beginning they were
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:34.840]  dismissing the internet they were poo-pooing it and isn't that good for us
[02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:38.880]  that that that for so long they were in arrogant denial and they seem like they
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:44.040]  still kind of are in arrogant denial no now they make it over in their image now
[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:51.800]  it's these endless monotonous tweets meaningless meaningless to me it's all
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:57.840]  just a lot of gnats a lot of confusion when the reality of the situation is
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:04.120]  life on earth has not changed we need facts we need events we need specifics
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:08.880]  on things not all this confusion it's almost they've made the internet over
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:13.400]  in their image these corporations and I think they're failing play break skip
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:16.400]  the break oh sorry Matt go ahead I didn't erupt you say you think they're
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:21.440]  failing I think they're failing to the point this is a whole nother discussion
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:24.920]  on how sick are the American people right now I've been saying they could put
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:30.120]  Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar in the Oval Office and she'd be elected people
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:33.560]  are really sick I think you know this deep in your soul and this is why you
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:39.080]  get demoralized here on this very set I shouldn't people are sick how they've
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:45.280]  got here you've been done a wonderful arc over almost decades now explaining why
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:51.480]  people are and have become so sick that being said people are willing to be made
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:55.480]  over in the image of these corporations the reason there's so much anger online
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:59.720]  also is the newspaper like the Washington Post will leave a comment
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:03.480]  section they don't care what you're saying they don't care what you're
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:09.040]  thinking that's why you get these anger that oh I have to be you know I'm
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:13.480]  out here as a citizen and I'm operating on in their playground make your own
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:19.400]  playground the reason I'm here Alex is you've made your own playground this is
[02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:25.280]  a figment of your imagination then and the drudge report is mine it is a very
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:31.640]  simple thesis you are what you dream you are and become and I wish Americans
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:38.080]  would get out of the sickness and just become greater and that's profound I
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:42.800]  mean because if we start creating our own maps our own world our own vision then
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:46.640]  there's no way for these cultural tyrants to program us and that's why
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:50.560]  they're pushing so hard to get more outrageous I mean is this the beginning
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:56.240]  of the end and to operate in their playgrounds so you become famous on
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:21:01.080]  YouTube that's ridiculous I'm not saying you I'm saying the 13-year-old that
[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:04.360]  just died that they're saying is the first YouTube star that died you're
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:11.120]  playing in Google's help it no I agree but I make your own place make your own
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:17.080]  the internet allows you to make your own dynamic your own universe why are you
[02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:22.040]  gravitating towards somebody else's universe and this is kind of again
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:27.560]  we're drudged to me when I look at it right now is a correction to this group
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:31.600]  think that has I totally agree with there's no difference from any of these
[02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:36.560]  websites you go up and down we talk about this what's the difference between
[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:42.640]  the websites between a slate or a salon or a buzzfeed or a huff but what is the
[02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:48.320]  difference there isn't any and this is a travesty it's almost like it's almost
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:54.280]  like a weird conglomerate of group think that has developed in a dynamic era
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:59.080]  that should be vibrating it should be vibrating it should be controversial but
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:04.040]  I guess it's fear and that's not everybody is cut from the same genetic
[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:08.680]  background as you or I Alex of being brave and being able to stand up you're
[02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:14.040]  on the camera I'm not you're more brave than I am so this is the dynamic that I
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:19.160]  meant I would just like to wake people up stop operating in their playground
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:24.000]  stop it well let me say this I totally agree with you I've tried I couldn't pay
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.400]  for the bandwidth to put all of our videos out on our own platforms now
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:31.640]  we're doing that at prisonplanet.tv and the nightly news and putting
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:34.440]  ourselves you know up on television to reach people because it's kind of like
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:39.120]  jacking into the matrix going into their playground I try to then claw them over
[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:42.560]  here to see what we're trying to do what you're trying to do but I totally agree
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:47.880]  with you the answer is for all of us to create our own systems our own ideas
[02:22:47.880 --> 02:22:53.960]  because vibrant independent ideas will trump this corporate plastic borg this
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:58.200]  this this brainwashing they're trying to push I mean banning father and mother
[02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:02.200]  banning you know the word husband and wife I mean that's so cultic that if I
[02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:06.000]  had been told ten years ago they were gonna ban words like that I wouldn't
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.440]  have believed it they do it with straight faces I mean it has the left and
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:13.960]  of course the controlled right as well but have they gone collectively insane
[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:19.680]  on on a control freak bent well I was there a strategy I would also or advise
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:23.880]  people to not waste their time on this I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:29.040]  my face it's over for me said Matt it's over for you they've got the votes now
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:33.060]  to enforce copyright law you're out of there they're gonna make it so headlines
[02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:38.160]  you can't even use headlines to have a Supreme Court justice say that to my
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:43.800]  face that it's over they've got the votes which means time is limited time is
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:49.720]  not forever how many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life rise
[02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:54.880]  and fall there's not that many it's a small amount so for people to be saying
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:59.920]  with this attitude oh I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime no no
[02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:05.080]  you can't we're being enslaved now and that's it under the TPP they admit you
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:09.760]  can't put a headline to the New York Times you're sending massive traffic to
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:14.480]  them they're claiming you're taking their words this is insane and you had the
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:18.240]  justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law now member just
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:21.480]  recently getting it lined up with it so they're getting ready for these
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:25.200]  decisions to come you thought Obamacare was shocking you thought some of these
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:29.120]  other decisions were shocking wait until these copyright laws work their way up
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:35.220]  and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines
[02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:40.800]  linking across the board then that will end for me fine I've had a hell of a
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:45.120]  run it's 20 years next year or 20 years about now hell of a run I couldn't I
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:50.280]  couldn't have gone any further farther I feel completely I have gone as far out
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:54.320]  of the galaxy as I can on this I still want to stay out here but I've gone
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:58.640]  pretty damn far for what one individual can do in this culture but I'm talking
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:03.440]  about the future so I don't know why they've been successful in pushing
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:07.760]  everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks and these tweets and
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:14.360]  these Instagrams these instas this is ghetto this is ghetto this is corporate
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:18.560]  they're taking your they taking your energy they're taking your energy and
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:21.640]  you're getting nothing in return nothing they're dumbing the language down
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:25.480]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language directly out of 1984 it's
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:30.720]  in shock right ultimately it's boring and the kids are always off to something
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:34.280]  new except for the something new is owned by the same freaking company or
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:39.560]  financed by the same banking system so I'm here to say and this is the reason
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:43.560]  why I came to see you Alex is you are one of the very few who are operating
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:49.400]  under this this under this theory to be an independent American and as in a big
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:53.280]  way if you're calling media is if you're calling is media fine if you're
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:56.920]  calling is sports whatever it is but you've got to be the greatest you can
[02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:02.960]  be now now before this country is so completely right and we're left with
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:08.000]  Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar because that's what we're getting
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.080]  she's old and she's sick she's not a contender they're making her a contender
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:16.920]  with these propped up Saturday night live things it's like a head on a stick
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:22.360]  and then on the today's show with the gun three a head on a stick she is not a
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:28.920]  viable vibrant leader for this country of 300 including the illegals 380 million
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:35.320]  Americans so the media is trying to put us to sleep you're not letting them
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:39.920]  Alex I ask you this question man yeah it is the establishment which we know is
[02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:43.480]  diverse but there's different conglomerates is it panicking is it
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:46.280]  trying to push everything through right now because it knows people are waking
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:51.400]  up or is it just completely arrogant and thinks it's invincible it's trying to
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:56.520]  consolidate control yes and there is a sense of panic about it you look at a
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:00.880]  telemundo or a Univision they're kind of panicked you look at some of these
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:04.360]  interviews that are happening this election cycle where Trump comes along
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:10.800]  says a few things just a few things and soars to the top of the list that's
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:16.120]  profound imagine if we actually had a good selection of candidates who are
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:19.840]  saying a lot and then I know Cruz and Rand and all the rest however you've
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:24.000]  got to be dynamic in this atmosphere and it's a media country you've got to be
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.960]  dynamic and media that's the only thing that's going to work so I am left with
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:34.600]  thinking there's not a lot of time to be your greatest self especially online
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:39.880]  because I don't if it continues to get consolidated to this degree and then
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:43.520]  we're moving into the robots which you're so profound on and it's going to
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:48.480]  get really ugly really fast there's already automated news sites Google
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:52.800]  news hello anybody they actually the idiots reading that crap think there is
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:57.680]  actually a human there there is no human there you are being programmed to
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:02.840]  being automated even up to your news and Apple news I don't know what that's
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:09.280]  about that was also creepy a same corporate glaze over everything I don't
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:13.280]  see the world that way I live in a world that's free colorful vibrant takes
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:19.280]  chances bold stands up to power and that's where I've made my success well
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:24.880]  very eloquently said I mean really if we don't affect the battle space if we
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:27.680]  don't get involved in free speech now that's all you the listeners all the
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:31.720]  drudge fans fans of freedom no matter what color you are no matter what
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:35.080]  political ban we're going to lose everything we know what the Talitarian
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:39.040]  looks like we know what oppression looks like we know what the dumb culture of
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:45.560]  of the Talitarianism smells like this is it it's happening now and the future of
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:49.560]  the world is being decided so get out there make your own sides take action
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:52.320]  because Matt you say you'll just go away if they do this we all know we're
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:55.760]  gonna fight it we know they can't enforce it because if they can say that
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:00.160]  you can't even put a link up to a news site then that ends free speech and
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.000]  basic communication I mean I know they got the Democrats out openly saying we
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.680]  need to bring in the fairness doctrine to the internet because of Matt drudge
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:10.680]  because you quote affect elections well you're an American citizen that pays
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:14.480]  taxes and you're allowed to be programmed well but if they get enough sick
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:18.440]  people to elect it the demographics will take care of themselves we had a story
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:22.280]  this morning that they're finally releasing an artist in Cuba who painted
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:29.040]  Raul and cat and a Fidel as a pig jailed without trial for 18 months look at
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:32.120]  Germany where they're arresting people that criticize open borders look you've
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:37.240]  been so it's already happening I'm just warning this country that yes don't get
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:42.040]  into this false sense that you are an individual when you're on Facebook no
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:47.320]  you're not you're a pawn in their scheme stay there we got to come right back
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:51.520]  for a few more minutes and say bye this is incredible the Empire's on the run
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:56.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:58.040 --> 02:30:03.240]  air strikes are not always the surgical maneuvers people envision in a sense
[02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:08.320]  civilians have been killed in another botched raid this time in Afghanistan the
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:13.080]  Washington Post reports of the 19 killed three were children with the UN
[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:17.520]  calling the strike an inexcusable war crime doctors without border states that
[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:21.520]  while militants had recently entered the area none were using the hospital for
[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:25.560]  offensive measures contrast that with the bombing leaving patients burning in
[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:29.960]  their beds add this to the famous story of the wedding that became a funeral in
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:34.520]  Yemen where 12 people died after an attacking drone confused the party for
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:38.880]  another group other reports from January of this year show the deaths of two
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:43.960]  hostages including an American citizen in a US drone strike and the father who
[02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:47.360]  had his children shot at for trying to save a camera crew who had been
[02:30:47.360 --> 02:30:51.520]  mistaken for terrorists well this be another example of the military going

[02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:30.680]  Waging War on Corruption it's Alex Jones. Well I tell you a lot of energy
[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:34.720]  in the building there's already a lot of energy in this building a lot of smiles
[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:40.480]  with Matt Drudge here a Don I guess went to the door and we say don't let
[02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:45.400]  strangers in but it was no stranger Matt Drudge here in studio with us and
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:50.800]  characteristically very kind of like Peter Pan hard to hard to catch hard to
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:55.440]  find moves quick he is right over there in the dark with a handheld microphone
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:58.920]  of course the conspiracy theories will begin this isn't really Matt Drudge people
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:02.600]  can tell it is Matt Drudge I've seen a lot of his speeches hurting pop in on
[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:06.040]  shows here and there and it's always eloquent always thought-provoking this
[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:10.040]  is particularly thought-provoking and will be a big newsmaker they will attempt
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:14.360]  to control reality and say how dare Matt Drudge hang out with that heretic
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:18.280]  Alex Jones and we're always hearing the last six seven years that Matt Drudge is
[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:21.800]  over Matt Drudge doesn't exist but then they have to admit Matt Drudge is bigger
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:27.240]  than ever so this attempt to control reality or control who talks to who by
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:31.440]  these totalitarians that masquerade as liberals I don't think is working and
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:35.680]  now with Boehner being forced out I think it shows the rumblings of the tea
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:40.320]  party beneath the surface so Matt before you leave us and I really appreciate
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.160]  your time oh and by the way the presidential candidates that's exactly
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:48.640]  what you're saying the rumblings look at anybody who has any form of success in
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:54.080]  the polls is because they rumble where it's gonna end up I don't know I'm very
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:58.800]  pessimistic I'm very pessimistic on this race because I'm just not so sure it's
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:03.600]  not gonna end up with the dreaded brain in the in the jar in the Oval Office
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:09.160]  once known as Hillary Clinton who is hypothyroid anybody who is 70 years old
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:13.280]  who's hypothyroid you do not elect president ladies and gentlemen you don't
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:17.920]  do it now they'll say well it has to be who her VP is whether it's the Castro
[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:22.000]  from San Antonio or the other Castro from San Antonio or the other Castro from
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:28.640]  San Antonio whoever it's gonna be I I just shaking now after seeing NBC giving
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:34.880]  her endless hours of airtime over the past 72 hours at Hillary's back and
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:39.200]  she's back for real now what that means to you or me what it means to me I've
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:43.000]  got a long history with these people they're ugly they played dirty they
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.880]  sued me for $30 million last time around with the approval of the president
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:52.120]  announced by the press secretary of the White House a civil action these people
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:55.760]  and they didn't have the NSA then they had echelon it all these other things you
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:36:01.680]  were talking about even then Hillary Clinton with the NSA good luck if you
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:07.320]  dissent good luck if you dissent Snowden I'll switch places with you you can
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:11.000]  come over here in rotten hell because that's what it's gonna be so I'm very
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.440]  concerned with the lay of the land but the rumblings you're talking about that
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:20.160]  we've seen a Trump that we've seen a Carly that do we see in a Sanders yeah
[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:26.840]  maybe also old old can the Democrats find anybody under the age of 70 what is
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:31.800]  this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a new century so
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:37.480]  I don't know I I'm hoping for surprises I'm hoping for some jolts we'll have to
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:41.400]  see on a few other subjects and I appreciate your time I'm quit bugging
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:47.000]  you there's so much going on the world Obama now is talking about well
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.320]  Australia had a good plan we may have to do that that's clearly talking about
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:55.200]  gun confiscation now Hillary's doing it CNN's as pundits just saying let's just
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:59.240]  take them do these people realize that this is the line of the sanity Alamo
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:03.440]  if they really come out in the frontal assault on guns it means I think they're
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:08.720]  trying to start a civil war it just seems like insanity I mean they may think
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:13.520]  that they're Stalin or something well because they're all armed themselves or
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:17.800]  they all have that security around them themselves they don't have to worry
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:24.440]  about I challenge Hillary take away your secret service take it away now take
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:29.040]  away your secret service dismiss them have no security around you have no
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:34.720]  guns around you Hillary I dare you I dare you Obama same thing drop your
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:40.760]  guns Obama take your secret service away Obama take it all away leave the
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:44.320]  White House unguarded Obama let everybody know there's no guns on the
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:48.840]  White House grounds Obama you know what would happen in 30 seconds both of
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:53.440]  those people would no longer be on planet Earth so they're asking us to
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:59.680]  drop our guns and to drop our security measures or or what so this thing is
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:04.080]  very real and I don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:08.240]  voter you can't underestimate the sickness of the American people right now
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:12.600]  they're really sick and that's to me I'm more angry at the sick Americans than
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:17.400]  I am at Obama or Hillary I'm really angry at the sick Americans Matt Drudge I
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:20.680]  used to listen to your radio show almost every Sunday but I got to tell you
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:25.200]  you are even more on fire than you were then and I know you're smart you know
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:29.040]  not to be you know you know too available because distance makes the heart
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:33.640]  grow find and I tell you about it would be great if even once a week you did
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:37.280]  like an hour podcast or something or maybe once a month with these thoughts
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:41.160]  because let me tell you this is some really good radio and I'm enjoying it
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:44.640]  and I know the audience is I mean Matt Drudge is kind of co-host on the Alex
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:50.040]  Jones show right now this is crazy maybe I'll join Facebook oh yeah I don't do
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:55.440]  that no well I can't I realized that I just might my personalities I've got to
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:00.280]  stay focused I can't be I can't be too distracted you know your advice to me
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:03.560]  was right you know like a year ago that don't try to do too much I mean you're
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:08.120]  right Paul Joseph Watson I told him watch out for this this you know that
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.760]  it's it's a it's a larger topic but at my height of media availability I was
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:19.360]  doing the website the TV show and the radio show at the same time as you are
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:25.480]  doing now as you are doing now mine was with the corporations clear channel
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:32.120]  news corp and then the drudge report but still I felt just myself it I felt
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:36.720]  it was just more powerful to go to the web plus not to necessarily be playing
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:41.840]  in their playground because the power of the individual as you represent sitting
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:46.960]  there right now is powerful to the heart I said to Paul Joseph Watson when I saw
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:50.840]  him in London which you just referred to a year ago you're a romantic figure
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:55.360]  Alex in Americana it's wrong it's romantic what you do here every day it
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:40:01.320]  just is this is romance because you're an American standing up tough facing these
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:05.920]  headwinds wow are they blowing but you're there and there there's and you're
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:11.400]  not alone Limbaugh Savage Kennedy Levin there's a lot of people on the airwaves
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:15.440]  who are as brave they are brave and they are living it I've met them all I'm
[02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:22.840]  friends with them all they are also operating against the grain in an
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:26.800]  America that needs to go back to that well the systems tried to put some of
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:29.760]  them in jail I mean I know all those folks don't talk about the stuff that goes
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:33.960]  on behind the scenes I don't either but you know these people play hardball and
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:36.680]  and some folks can say who are libertarians well those folks don't
[02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:40.760]  sound libertarian up to me it doesn't matter the globalist the Democrats the
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:44.720]  the collectivist hate anybody who's conservative anybody who believes in
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:48.320]  the individual and the fact is those people promote individualism
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:52.920]  nationalism and that's why they've got to be eradicated what a horrible world of
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:57.840]  the system is successful Matt drudge in your gut in your heart do you think that
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:01.600]  humanity is going to be successful and make it the next hundred years oh the
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:05.760]  hundred years well of course in less mother nature decides you know I'm a
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:09.520]  big fan of letting mother nature decide some of this too you know we can't
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:15.040]  control a lot of this there is a law to the universe there just is there's just
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.560]  a law to the universe we could have the St. Andrea's rip tonight you have
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:22.440]  nothing to do with that we could have had that super hurricane that look what
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:27.160]  they did to South Carolina two or 300 miles offshore imagine if a category
[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:31.480]  five eyewall went right up the Chesapeake Bay they could say well mankind did
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:35.880]  that no mother nature decides so will we survive I'm sure we will what will we
[02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:42.000]  be not allowed to speak as we are today well we'll have it documented that we
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:47.760]  were allowed to speak that way once so I I don't know am I optimistic for myself
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:52.040]  personally yes I'm strong there's not much they can do they could laser beam me
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:55.720]  they could drone me they can plutonium me they could do whatever they wanted but
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:01.160]  spiritually I'm set I've already got it so they can't do much I just wish there
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:08.400]  was more media that was trailblazing and independent and this to me is of as a
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:12.600]  big danger right now in this setup is you've got these corporations like the
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:17.800]  New York Times and the Amazon now with the Washington Post and Time Warner and
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:24.520]  all of them seem to be the same this is what's frightening and there's so much
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:27.760]  news in the course of the day and the reason I think the drudge report has is
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:33.360]  interesting every morning is it's not exactly the same as you would see
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:38.240]  elsewhere and that's because I'm not involved with other people I'm looking
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:42.720]  at the world through my eyes and that's what you're seeing with bravery and with
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:48.840]  the ability to do it because the ability to do it what you've created here with
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:52.960]  one listener one day that went to 10 listeners that went to 50 to now your
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:57.960]  millions was organically grown and that's kind of how Earth proceeds and
[02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:01.900]  it usually takes time you're absolutely right looking at the open
[02:43:01.900 --> 02:43:05.400]  announcements by the Pope for world government carbon taxes looking for
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:09.960]  Obama announcing similar things they've gone from denying this planetary
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:14.680]  systems being set up to now admitting it we've got all these key meetings TPP
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:20.960]  being agreed on just a few days ago how is that affecting the people that were
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:24.320]  brainwashed and told none of this was happening how are they going to respond
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:29.360]  now when all of this starts coming to fruition I've been traveling a lot and
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:33.680]  I'm seeing a lot of desperation everywhere a lot of sad desperation I was
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:37.520]  just in an airport and even down to this a woman selling Southwest Airlines
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:42.800]  credit cards sending like a robot have you signed up yet are you a member of
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:47.640]  the club it was tragic this is a mature woman with a beautiful face and life and
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:51.160]  I'm like how did she get there what has happened to this culture that she's now
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:57.840]  standing as a robot like this they are sucking our ability to make an income
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.360]  that is compatible with what you need to so I'm getting a little frightened as I
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:05.520]  travel on the other side of it when I go to New York and I see some of the
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:10.720]  billionaires it's the other side endless you know they're fighting over pieces of
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:15.680]  artwork it's it's gotten to the point where they have and they have nots here
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:20.480]  is breaking so and it's the billionaires that are mainly funding the whole
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:23.240]  leftist redistribution movement because they end up getting the money in
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:28.520]  corporate welfare and insider deals it's so sick I watched a great film I don't
[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:32.200]  know if you've seen it yet but it's the best of enemies about Gore Vidal and
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:36.760]  William F. Buckley have you seen that yet no you've got to see it and it shows
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:40.640]  Garvidal arguing saying the answer and by the way why are we not allowed to have
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:44.200]  a Gore Vidal William Buckley anymore in the media scene do you see who they
[02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:50.440]  hire do you see who's hired for the shows how dull they are yes dull dull as
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:53.440]  dishwash they want you to tune out of politics in an entertainment yes they
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:57.640]  make it where are the flamboyant characters this is what America's
[02:44:57.640 --> 02:45:02.680]  desperately needs right now flamboyant intellectual characters who can cut
[02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:07.080]  different ways and that's just what I'm missing I'm been fortunate enough to meet
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:10.520]  some of the greats of this generation and I've got to tell you they are there
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:15.000]  it's just they are suppressed and hidden and they're not hired the way
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.440]  Gore Vidal and Buckley were back of previous generation they were not
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:23.280]  afraid of ideas this generation is frightened of ideas or at least it's
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:26.880]  being suppressed let's throw in in the few minutes we have left we're about to
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:29.480]  go to break and I know you've given us more time you even said you would Matt
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:33.160]  Rogers our gas drudge report calm obviously in studio here in Austin
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:36.400]  Texas visiting a surprise visit one of the best ever that's better than
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:41.040]  surprise birthday parties I've had shifting years I don't think that it's
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:45.480]  Putin's this great angel of this wonderful perfect person but our foreign
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:50.160]  policy is so corrupt so deceptive it makes him look good and nobody's gonna
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:53.520]  back Al Qaeda I talked about this last Thursday and Friday and I'll find the
[02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:56.520]  article and we'll put it in this video later and put it out as a report but it
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:46:02.760]  was it was Reuters reporting that the White House is angry that these
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:07.640]  airstrikes by the Russians have hit the moderates Al Nuzra which is Al Qaeda in
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:12.400]  Syria and then it just went on and they're telling him to stop doing it
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:17.400]  and he didn't hit ISIS but then Putin pointed out no that's the bosses of ISIS
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:20.960]  that's just their fighters it's the same group which is true but it's twilight
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:26.040]  zone I can't even believe I'm reading Reuters who has riders with a straight
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:30.320]  face that will just sit there and write articles about how Al Qaeda is moderate
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:34.360]  and not bad and then we criticize Russia for bombing them when they're
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:39.480]  attacking Russian interest it's just so bizarre it seems like that Carl Rove
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:44.040]  quote we said we control reality I don't think Obama and these guys really
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:48.080]  control reality and now we've got John McCain saying let's go ahead and ends
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:51.800]  the big presence key and have war with Russia let's go ahead and attack the
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:56.120]  Russian aircraft I mean it's crazy town what do you say to that well I'll say
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:00.240]  this we never even heard of ISIS until recently and I remember when that
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:04.320]  name first started coming up do you know it was designed to be confused with
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:08.600]  Darrell Issa no I didn't know that's what it was because Darrell Issa was the
[02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:11.720]  enemy at the time of this administration you know there would have been a time
[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:15.600]  Obama could have been impeached and I'm thinking the IRS scandal most likely
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:19.440]  that would have been the one you get the depositions going you get the president
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:23.640]  under oath you follow the chain Obama most likely would have been opete
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:28.120]  impeached they decided we're not going there we're not gonna have those cities
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:33.840]  burn we're not gonna do it we're not gonna impeach Obama so I felt Darrell
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:39.520]  Issa that's his name right because I'm getting all ISIL Issa Issa Darrell Issa I
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:45.200]  think they were they came up with the name ISIS to be confused with Darrell
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:49.360]  Issa I'm really being honest with you I remember when the first time Christian
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:55.600]  I'm in poor sputtered out this word ISIS I mean where did she get that one you
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:59.480]  know these words are creative these events are created now we act like oh
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:03.120]  ISIS has been around for 20 or 30 years says who let's put around a year and a
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:08.440]  half yeah designed to confuse and then the president going it's not even ISIS
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:16.600]  it's ISIL or ice or ISIL or is this is Dr. Seuss this is madness so well I'm
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:19.920]  not able to follow any of it because when I sit down and look at the news I'm
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:24.400]  not able to follow the bouncing ball is Putin here is Obama here where does
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:28.120]  this one go where I can't follow can you put the pieces together I'm glad you
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:32.560]  can because I can't Wow well we're going to break here in about a minute and a
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:35.200]  half and then I'm gonna come back and play a special report they're gonna go
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:38.800]  into the fourth hour being hosted by one of our co-host today but Matt in the
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:42.000]  two minutes we've got left it's amazing to have you here what else do you think
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.280]  front and center in the universe and the last two minutes here what do you want
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:49.720]  to say to the audience and to the dinosaur media that is going to
[02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:53.760]  gleefully try to edit this and chop this up and I guess use it for their
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:57.600]  funeral pyre well they're welcome to again they've got no control over the
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:04.480]  situation none no control no control over me sorry zero I wanted to congratulate
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:07.520]  you you one of the people don't really talk about this you are one of the first
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:14.000]  to stream 24 hours a day and I think the reason I was drawn into info wars was
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:19.520]  because of this streaming this is a profound break that you did to allow
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:24.520]  the audience to hear you at any time to make it available at any time from
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:30.000]  anywhere looping looping looping until the next broadcast this is a profound
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.720]  thing you did I don't think that's recognized enough in the industry I'm
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:37.800]  just talking shop top shop talk here for a second that was big because what
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:41.920]  you're seeing with the AM dial now and I'm not besmirching any stations that
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:44.880]  are carrying this right now but some of these ratings are frightening some of
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:47.920]  these ratings in these major cities are frightening I'm talking about half the
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:54.400]  listeners generally overall for every a tall coast some of them are down a half
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:50:01.240]  a half in one year something is going on but you broke through with this 24 hour
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:06.040]  looping always available on my happiest nights I'm sitting here and I'm
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:11.520]  listening to you from wherever I am in the world looping getting it getting it
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:16.160]  getting it and the guests this is a profound shift available anytime from
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:21.440]  anywhere well that was you Alex that was like 12 years ago I said why do we just
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:26.200]  send the stream out once and then wait for a podcast to come up for they even
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:30.440]  called it podcast which is an MP3 organically again yet again another
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:34.840]  organically grown decision that changed the media land sure and I said why not
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:38.320]  just have I don't want to just have because I was one of the first people
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:41.400]  are doing this 20 years ago limbo is probably the first with a little you
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:45.360]  know pod cam took a photo every minute or something I said why don't we just put
[02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:48.840]  cameras in here so I can show people articles show them photos show them
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:53.200]  books and even show them video clips and then we'll start streaming it and by the
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:57.600]  way limbo was genius for doing that because he bypassed broadcast he didn't
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:01.640]  have to hook up with a fox or a CNN to show him in real time he was able to
[02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:05.800]  bypass that and I think there was some cams for radio shows before that but he
[02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:10.040]  did it on the larger scale but what you did by breaking the mold by breaking the
[02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:14.040]  mold whatever you said that day like why don't we loop it I can't tell you how
[02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:19.200]  that's changed I would I would say the majority of your listeners are have and
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:23.000]  will discover you through the looping and the broadcast because now we can drive
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.520]  around and listen to you without the streaming even though it seems like the
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:30.520]  streaming is what what the where things are going I gotta say when you broke the
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:35.160]  egg there when you crack the egg that was a big one that was a Stanley Kubrick
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:38.960]  moment of the bone going up what you did with that one so that was well I don't
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:41.440]  think it's as big as the bones you've been throwing up the turn into the space
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:45.040]  ships but I tell you it's amazing to just have the diverse audience that
[02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:48.360]  tunes in to hear me babble speak of the devil like people like Stanley Kubrick's
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:51.000]  daughter and folks that have popped up to and you're like you check it out I
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.280]  know this is really Stanley Kubrick's daughter that helped make some of his
[02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:57.680]  films it just blows your way if Stanley Kubrick was alive can you imagine can
[02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:01.200]  you imagine where he would have gone he would have done some great work oh we're
[02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:04.800]  missing the Hollywood push to where's the greatness coming out of Hollywood they
[02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:07.480]  want it dumbed down I've talked to top enough of the enough of the Martian
[02:52:07.480 --> 02:52:10.800]  crap tell us something was telling something big and real and profound as
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:15.000]  Kubrick would have on a human level on a human level well I'm not allowed to say
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:18.160]  what I was told about Kubrick but let me say it was obvious from his films he
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:22.600]  would he was be on board with us he was Spielberg keeps going back to World
[02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:27.600]  War two I mean enough already let's let's get focused I look at a PT
[02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:31.440]  Anderson and I don't know it's kind of gone into a marijuana cloud for me
[02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:35.280]  where are the artists who are challenging this generation like Kubrick did
[02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:38.680]  so that's another topic separately but we're going to break in one minute we're
[02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:41.760]  gonna air John Bowne's report come back and who's hosting the fourth hour today
[02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:43.200]  I'm so
[02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:47.360]  thunderstruck that I David Knight's got a bunch coming up and obviously we need to
[02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:52.120]  get clips of this epic interview play those and put those out on info wars.com
[02:52:52.120 --> 02:52:56.680]  and prisonplanet.com and Matt how fast do you think here's what's crazy five
[02:52:56.680 --> 02:52:59.800]  years ago I carried a mainstream media wrote stories against us or I cared if I
[02:52:59.800 --> 02:53:02.840]  was on Nightline or something you've been in more big stuff than I am now it
[02:53:02.840 --> 02:53:07.000]  doesn't even do anything when I'm on those shows that's why I know that they
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:11.800]  don't mean anything and so we should end with this you were the guy who tweeted
[02:53:11.800 --> 02:53:16.480]  at least from what I saw at Pierce Morgan three years ago or two and a half
[02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:20.440]  years ago to say have Alex Jones on debate him. Matchmaker yeah behind the
[02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:24.440]  scenes people don't know this about me I'm a matchmaker behind the scenes that
[02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:28.480]  I've had the ability to make some deals happen and do some things behind the
[02:53:28.480 --> 02:53:31.960]  scenes now I've never met Pierce Morgan but I do believe that tweet that day did
[02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:34.360]  lead to that you're right. Well no they told me in his office they said what do
[02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:37.240]  you think of Matt Drudge's idea because they got my cell phone number and called
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:41.280]  me to CNN had it I said which ended up being the most dramatic moment on CNN in
[02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:45.280]  a generation. They admit that they have votes and say that. That's why they need
[02:53:45.280 --> 02:53:49.480]  to hire people away from Sixth Avenue just to look at the scene I remember
[02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:52.600]  once saying to Charlie Rose where why aren't you have more conservatives on
[02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:57.400]  and he says who and I you know there's a whole list of them why are they limiting
[02:53:57.400 --> 02:54:01.760]  themselves because you would say it's a you know it's contrived plan to limit
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:06.200]  but I still think to make provocative programming you've got to have different
[02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:12.000]  points of view a la the Buckley and Vidal Gore Vidal where is that in this
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:16.640]  culture it's missing I get it from Info Wars I get it from other places too
[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:20.240]  mainly talk radio talk radio seems to be the driving force of this culture at
[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:25.280]  least in spoken word I'm not getting it from television that much I'm just not
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:29.880]  where are the intriguing television shows I mean you could say homeland you
[02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:34.960]  can say some of these others okay yes but where are the real dynamic things
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:39.440]  that are pushing where to expand on that appears Morgan had a ratings boost
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:43.560]  for about 30 40% for two weeks after that then it went down steadily declined
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:49.240]  and they got rid of him CNN knows that if they put my commentary on or your
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:52.840]  commentary others tens of millions would tune in to watch it they know that they
[02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:57.080]  have to control the narrative because it's an agenda even if itself defeating
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:01.240]  and destroying them so where do you think that ends up going them attempting to
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:05.060]  censor us well it all depends if the sick Americans will get up get
[02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:09.320]  unsick that's all that's all you just have to do because if you get well if
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:13.840]  you get well you're not that interested in what Anderson Cooper is saying about
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:18.400]  things you're just not I'm sorry I don't need to be insulting if you're sick you
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:25.200]  find comfort in that I don't what are your final words final words these are
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:28.360]  the last words ever spoken on earth as these are the final words yes George
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:33.120]  Washington says as well well again I just wanted to come to congratulate you
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:38.280]  from building organically from the ground up thank you a media that is not
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:42.320]  only American it's just Western it's not even Western it just freedom I can
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:45.720]  imagine somebody right now listening to us who's sitting in a prison cell
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:51.120]  somewhere somewhere awful thinking about freedom so congratulations to you I'm
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:55.320]  more power to you take care of yourself because you know you're the vehicle too
[02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:59.920]  so I'm speechless Matt drudge I can't go on sorry the callers David Knights
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:03.280]  coming up I'll be back tomorrow Lord willing 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central a
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:06.760]  fourth hour coming up as we move into the overdrive show and nightly news
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:11.120]  tonight at 7 but we're gonna go ahead and go to this John bound report and then
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:14.520]  come back with the fourth hour info wars.com forward slash show to find all
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:18.040]  that Matt drudge is here in studio I'm gonna give him the turn now thank you Matt
[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:22.880]  that was an amazing 45 minutes here's the report there's been another mass
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:30.880]  shooting in America this time in a community college in Oregon that means
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:38.200]  there are more American families moms dads children whose lives have been
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:44.520]  changed forever that means there's another community stunned with grief and
[02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:50.720]  communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish and parents
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:57.960]  across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:03.280]  families or their children we talked about this after Columbine and
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:10.400]  Blacksburg after Tucson after Newtown after Aurora after Charleston it cannot
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:15.880]  be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:21.040]  or her hands on a gun more families victimized more average citizens
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:24.680]  president Obama may or may not personally offer his condolences to
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:29.000]  because he is too busy pleading his case to eliminate our constitutional
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:32.520]  Second Amendment right to protect ourselves and our communities Pew
[02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:37.360]  researches July 2014 poll the demographics and politics of gun owning
[02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:42.120]  households found that about six in ten gun household members 64 percent say
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:47.240]  they often feel proud to be an American in contrast about half 51 percent of
[02:57:47.240 --> 02:57:52.440]  other adults say this there exists a constitutional mindset and reason for
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:57.320]  owning a weapon in the United States the United States ranks numero uno in gun

[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:21.360]  the people pushing the international policies to agendize constitutional
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:26.680]  freedoms we as a nation require in order for our republic to operate and the
[02:58:26.680 --> 02:58:31.040]  media spin on the coverage is always the same who cares who the shooter was in
[02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:35.600]  Oregon why should we our immediate and only reality-based concerns should be

[02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:43.720]  whether it's three months or three years from now if we could just all pay

[02:59:49.560 --> 03:00:03.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show from his central Texas command center
[03:00:03.480 --> 03:00:09.600]  deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the
[03:00:09.600 --> 03:00:17.600]  GCN radio network. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this fourth hour the
[03:00:17.600 --> 03:00:21.880]  news wrap up I'm David Knight your host pretty amazing to see Matt Dredge in
[03:00:21.880 --> 03:00:25.400]  here and we have a lot of stories that we cover of his all the time as everyone
[03:00:25.400 --> 03:00:30.280]  does it's pretty amazing to see him in person quite a surprise we're going to
[03:00:30.280 --> 03:00:33.760]  talk in this next hour about something that I think is more important in the
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:36.960]  presidential race certainly more imminent than the presidential race
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:42.280]  that's about a year away but what's gonna happen is within the next few days
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:46.760]  we're going to have another speaker of the house he's going to have a lot of
[03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:50.640]  power a lot of power we've got the Trans Pacific partnership that just was
[03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:55.800]  approved we're told finally although we don't know what's in it yet isn't that
[03:00:55.800 --> 03:01:00.520]  interesting we're getting all kinds of reactions from the corporations that
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:04.560]  put this together with their corporate lobbyists we're getting reactions from
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:08.520]  their political puppets that they pay to be their spokesman their
[03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:11.600]  representatives saying I don't like this part about it I don't like this about
[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:14.720]  this industry so we're going to talk about that but we're also going to talk
[03:01:14.720 --> 03:01:19.880]  about this speaker race because it's going to have a huge impact on the
[03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:22.760]  Trans Pacific partnership for example but it's going to have an impact on
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:28.520]  everything you have to understand how powerful that office is very little
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:31.560]  attention is being given to that there's not much of a choice quite frankly
[03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:33.640]  there's only three people who are running for it they're going to be meeting
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:37.880]  tonight privately so we're going to talk a little bit about who these people are
[03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:41.160]  what we might expect from them are things really going to change are we
[03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:45.360]  simply going to get a new face we're also going to talk about killer robots the
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:51.080]  push to put that on us we see yet again this subject has come up we've talked
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:54.960]  to Noel Sharkey in the past about his concerns about that he's quoted in the
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:01:59.360]  article that's on drudge report about a UN delay could open the door to the
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:03.200]  robot wars and of course what they're trying to do is get some kind of a a ban
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:09.640]  a limit on autonomous killing machines you need to think about how important
[03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:15.000]  this is it was just last Friday that Alex Jones interviewed Annie Jacobson who
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:20.600]  had written the Pentagon's brain a very very compelling history of DARPA and I
[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:24.120]  would say the entire military industrial complex it's a very well-written
[03:02:24.120 --> 03:02:29.240]  book listening to it on audiobook it's like listening to or watching a
[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:32.440]  documentary I just much more compelling than many documentaries I've seen she's
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:36.720]  a very good reader but what she does in her book is she fills out the characters
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:41.160]  there's backstories of these scientists backstories of the organizations and
[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:45.600]  right now I'm still kind of about the first third of the book as I listen to
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:51.400]  it right now she's talking about the Cold War about the efforts to try to limit
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:55.160]  this runaway nuclear race between the Russians and the Americans that happened
[03:02:55.160 --> 03:03:00.200]  sixty some odd years ago we were fortunate at the time to have somebody
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:05.080]  who had a moral compass a sense of proportion and a knowledge of the
[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:09.720]  military president Eisenhower he pushed very hard against this and is she
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:13.760]  pointed out in the interview when she was talking to Alex one of the people
[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:16.320]  that she was very concerned about it there were two people that he said he
[03:03:16.320 --> 03:03:24.280]  feared greatly Edward Teller and Werner von Braun there's a very funny very
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:28.960]  funny song about Werner von Braun that was done by a guy back in the 60s who
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:34.560]  knew many many people knew that he was a hardcore Nazi he was an SS member the
[03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:38.200]  scientists that worked with him at NASA that he wanted to bring in when he was
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:44.000]  offered the leadership of DARPA these guys were hardcore SA and SS members
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:47.680]  they were true believers they were very dangerous people many of the people that
[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:52.160]  we brought over an operation paper clip and it's not just DARPA it was also the
[03:03:52.160 --> 03:03:56.280]  bio weapons technology that was brought over that was essentially manned by
[03:03:56.280 --> 03:04:02.000]  Nazi war criminals Japanese war criminals people who had the idea that
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:06.520]  they could experiment on humans without having because I said it's in the
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:10.240]  greater good they don't need to have informed consent from the individuals
[03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:14.480]  because we're doing this for the greater good so that gave them carte blanche in
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:19.520]  their eyes to do some of the worst atrocities that mankind has ever seen
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:24.040]  that's why it's so important that we do not lose informed consent whether it
[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:29.480]  comes to vaccinations or anything else that the medical community does or
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:32.960]  anything that our government does so we're going to talk about one other
[03:04:32.960 --> 03:04:37.160]  aspect of informed consent and that is our Bill of Rights and how that is under
[03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:40.960]  attack in many different directions we've got a lot to talk about stay with
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:43.760]  us we'll be right back
[03:04:43.760 --> 03:05:02.840]  the politically correct police are calling for the ban of ham sandwiches
[03:05:02.840 --> 03:05:06.960]  that's right eating lunch is now considered offensive the guidelines
[03:05:06.960 --> 03:05:12.080]  published by coexist house a US and UK based interfaith group recommended an
[03:05:12.080 --> 03:05:16.280]  outright ban of pork products from office kitchens to avoid offending
[03:05:16.280 --> 03:05:20.560]  employees of Muslim and Jewish faiths it would be good etiquette to avoid
[03:05:20.560 --> 03:05:24.200]  heating up foods that might be prohibited for people of other faiths
[03:05:24.200 --> 03:05:28.440]  said a University of London professor who wrote the guidelines for coexist house
[03:05:28.440 --> 03:05:33.960]  and this isn't a one-off incident back in 2013 a Portland principal pushed to
[03:05:33.960 --> 03:05:37.720]  ban speaking about peanut butter and jelly because it's not a popular
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:42.720]  combination around the globe saying that Somali or Hispanic students may feel
[03:05:42.720 --> 03:05:47.080]  left out of the conversation because they don't eat sandwiches and a grocery

[03:08:09.920 --> 03:08:18.200]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show in this fourth hour October 6 2015 my name
[03:08:18.200 --> 03:08:22.560]  is David Knight I'm your host this last hour bring a news wrap up one of the
[03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:27.840]  things that is presented itself today yet another example of out of control
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:31.320]  killer robots as I was talking about in the last example we have to get control
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:36.080]  of this like we got control of the runaway race in nuclear arms it took a
[03:08:36.080 --> 03:08:39.880]  president who understood what was going on it took a president who understood
[03:08:39.880 --> 03:08:44.040]  the military industrial complex it was Eisenhower who warned us about that and
[03:08:44.040 --> 03:08:47.760]  it was Eisenhower who fought against the scientists like Edward Teller who
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:51.920]  wanted to create the next bigger bomb and these bombs were growing in their
[03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:58.040]  firepower exponentially looking at the the book that we had the we interviewed
[03:08:58.040 --> 03:09:02.440]  the author Alex interviewed the author on Friday the Pentagon's brain Annie
[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:06.880]  Jacobson a very good history very compelling history very entertaining
[03:09:06.880 --> 03:09:10.000]  history quite frankly I would highly recommend you get it because it fills in
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.760]  all of the details of what's going on you need to educate yourself about what's
[03:09:14.760 --> 03:09:17.880]  going on because these struggles that we're going through today are
[03:09:17.880 --> 03:09:21.960]  essentially the same in principle as the struggles that we've already gone
[03:09:21.960 --> 03:09:25.560]  through the arms race we see the revival of the Cold War quite frankly the
[03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:28.640]  military industrial complex wants to sell these big-ticket items one of these
[03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:34.000]  big-ticket items that's on the table right now are killer robots a very very
[03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:39.320]  dangerous situation as dangerous I would say as nuclear weapons the potential
[03:09:39.320 --> 03:09:44.600]  for mass destruction for giga death we've interviewed Hugo DeGaris remember
[03:09:44.600 --> 03:09:48.720]  the interview that we had with him the artificial intelligence scientist he
[03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:53.040]  talked about the art-elect wars what are the art-elect wars well the
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:59.800]  artificial intelligence wars his idea being that once we had a understanding
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:04.960]  of where this was headed once the public understood where artificial
[03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:07.800]  intelligence truly autonomous artificial intelligence because there's
[03:10:07.800 --> 03:10:10.920]  different kinds of artificial intelligence there's artificial
[03:10:10.920 --> 03:10:16.560]  intelligence that can that has limited scope that basically can make heuristic
[03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:20.840]  decisions about certain things draw conclusions do it more quickly than
[03:10:20.840 --> 03:10:25.520]  humans can do it but we're talking about generalized artificial intelligence
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:29.000]  artificial intelligence that can learn and think on its own that has a
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:32.720]  potential to run away the kind of artificial intelligence that was
[03:10:32.720 --> 03:10:38.720]  depicted in the Terminator series with Skynet that's what we're looking at now
[03:10:38.720 --> 03:10:43.760]  in reality people this is not science fiction and if you look at the history
[03:10:43.760 --> 03:10:48.800]  of DARPA and look at how these what these people were doing 60 years ago
[03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:54.200]  working on EMP bombs it's absolutely amazing to look at that history and to
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:10:58.080]  look at how they had to fight the scientist the military industrial
[03:10:58.080 --> 03:11:02.600]  complex how Eisenhower had to do that to try to limit the expansion of nuclear
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:07.160]  war they had gone from the atomic bomb the fishing bomb to the fusion bomb
[03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:11.760]  that's where her story really begins and that was many orders of magnitude
[03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:15.240]  greater than the atomic bomb and that wasn't good enough for Edward Teller
[03:11:15.240 --> 03:11:19.400]  and the other scientists they were then looking on the soup at the super bomb
[03:11:19.400 --> 03:11:23.320]  which they said could blow up an entire continent well where are you going to
[03:11:23.320 --> 03:11:30.520]  test that it's absolutely insane totally divorced from any reality or any sense
[03:11:30.520 --> 03:11:35.560]  of proportion and at that point Eisenhower as well as even Khrushchev
[03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:39.520]  were getting concerned about what their scientists were doing so they enacted a
[03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:45.440]  test ban treaty trying to put a limit on this runaway expansion now we have the
[03:11:45.440 --> 03:11:49.960]  same thing happening with killer robots we need to understand that we don't have
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:54.120]  a leader with that kind of proportion with that kind of sense no one who will
[03:11:54.120 --> 03:11:56.640]  stand up to the military industrial complex have you heard any questions
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:12:01.200]  about this in the presidential debates no have you heard any questions about the
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:05.320]  Trans-Pacific Partnership and its implications for our economy for our
[03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:09.480]  legal system for global governance no not a single question you're not going to
[03:12:09.480 --> 03:12:15.360]  hear that kind of question from Fox News or from CNN because they are part of the
[03:12:15.360 --> 03:12:19.320]  establishment they want to see these things move forward they want to see the
[03:12:19.320 --> 03:12:22.800]  TPP move forward they don't want to put any obstacles in the way the military
[03:12:22.800 --> 03:12:27.720]  industrial complex or big pharmaceutical companies so they are not asking the
[03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:33.160]  existential questions that affect not only our freedoms but our lives this is
[03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:37.340]  a very serious issue we've talked to Noel Sharkey in the past we've talked to
[03:12:37.340 --> 03:12:40.960]  Hugo DeGaris as I was saying in the last segment Hugo DeGaris said once
[03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:44.680]  people understood where artificial intelligence generalized artificial
[03:12:44.680 --> 03:12:48.800]  intelligence is going on there would be a massive pushback by the population if
[03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:55.200]  we can wake people up he believes at that point there will be a a war between
[03:12:55.200 --> 03:12:59.400]  those who want to continue the Edward Tellers of our time who want to continue
[03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:04.040]  with this no matter what he called them the cosmos because he thinks that they
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:10.520]  have a cosmic view that they want to create the super intelligence the gods
[03:13:10.520 --> 03:13:15.680]  in his words that will replace us and he quite frankly is on the fence with us
[03:13:15.680 --> 03:13:19.160]  he doesn't really know where he where he is on either side of the sea presents
[03:13:19.160 --> 03:13:23.300]  both sides and he's has this ambivalence because on the one hand he thinks it's
[03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:26.600]  going to result in the extinction of the human race and on the other hand he
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:30.260]  would like to be the person who creates the gods who are above us because I
[03:13:30.260 --> 03:13:35.000]  guess that makes him God in some sense in his mind that's what we're looking at
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:38.960]  now that's the kind of mentality that is running the military industrial
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:44.000]  complex one of the examples of where this will go in the near term of course
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:48.840]  are autonomous killing machines autonomous weapons killer robots that
[03:13:48.840 --> 03:13:53.840]  don't require human intervention in order to kill now since we don't have a
[03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:57.320]  leader in the West who will stand up to the military industrial complex some
[03:13:57.320 --> 03:14:01.800]  people are trying to do this through the UN I don't have much confidence in the
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:06.600]  UN I don't think much is going to happen from that I don't think that it's
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:10.120]  strong enough and I don't necessarily I'm concerned about the concentration of
[03:14:10.120 --> 03:14:13.000]  power that would let them do something like this but perhaps they can get
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:17.560]  people together of goodwill in different areas that would be the the best case
[03:14:17.560 --> 03:14:21.840]  scenario I don't likely see that happening nevertheless I stand with
[03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:26.600]  Noel Sharkey and others the who are on the International Committee for Robot
[03:14:26.600 --> 03:14:31.120]  Arms Control somebody needs to do with it so in this particular case it's not a
[03:14:31.120 --> 03:14:34.640]  president who's coming out and trying to control this out of control military
[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:38.320]  industrial complex this is essentially a grassroots movement of scientists
[03:14:38.320 --> 03:14:44.000]  perhaps something will happen if you the people will join them we're not going
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:48.080]  to see this from our leaders they are totally owned by the military industrial
[03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:51.720]  complex just like we're not going to see them stop the trans-pacific partnership
[03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:57.120]  and we're going to talk about that as well because we have a massive sea change
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:02.960]  that is happening right now in the house it is very very important who the
[03:15:02.960 --> 03:15:06.560]  speaker of the house is you understand the speaker is third in line to the
[03:15:06.560 --> 03:15:12.560]  presidency you understand the speaker has control over who gets to sit on which
[03:15:12.560 --> 03:15:15.280]  committees which laws get introduced and that sort of thing that's why
[03:15:15.280 --> 03:15:18.960]  everyone was so concerned about John Boehner that's why the pressure to get
[03:15:18.960 --> 03:15:22.400]  rid of John Boehner was brought up tonight there's going to be a private
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:26.600]  meeting amongst congressmen they're going to talk about who will be
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:31.640]  seceding John Boehner it's very important we only have three people that are
[03:15:31.640 --> 03:15:34.640]  going to be running for that office we're going to break down a little bit
[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:39.480]  their background unfortunately there's not much to cheer about here it's just
[03:15:39.480 --> 03:15:43.960]  like the presidential race we don't have much of a choice really but we need to
[03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:50.560]  try to push for someone who is the least bad or at least someone who is not just
[03:15:50.560 --> 03:15:54.720]  a new face being put on the same old policy so we're going to talk about that
[03:15:54.720 --> 03:15:59.360]  as well as the corporations reacting to the trans-pacific partnership as well
[03:15:59.360 --> 03:16:04.240]  as what is going on again in the presidential race but this is one of
[03:16:04.240 --> 03:16:06.800]  these issues where I've said over and over again I think that the
[03:16:06.800 --> 03:16:12.000]  presidential race for the most part is a distraction is to get us totally
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:18.120]  invested into these candidates so that we don't get invested in issues so we
[03:16:18.120 --> 03:16:22.520]  don't get invested in our local government and one of the issues that we
[03:16:22.520 --> 03:16:26.720]  need to get invested in is we need to join with the this grassroots movement
[03:16:26.720 --> 03:16:30.800]  of scientists who understand the danger of artificial intelligence who
[03:16:30.800 --> 03:16:36.520]  understand the danger of killer robots we as a people for our own survival we
[03:16:36.520 --> 03:16:39.840]  have to get involved with these people we have to support them because it isn't
[03:16:39.840 --> 03:16:43.880]  going to happen from some savior in Washington none of these president
[03:16:43.880 --> 03:16:48.760]  presidential candidates could care less about this quite frankly they're not
[03:16:48.760 --> 03:16:51.040]  even they're not talking about it there's not going to be any questions
[03:16:51.040 --> 03:16:54.720]  asked any of these presidential debates I would venture to guess that most these
[03:16:54.720 --> 03:16:59.960]  presidents presidential candidates aren't even really aware of the issue but
[03:16:59.960 --> 03:17:02.960]  let's take a look at this article that was on the Guardian today UN delay could
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:07.560]  open the door to robot wars say experts observers say the UK and the US are
[03:17:07.560 --> 03:17:11.880]  seeking to water down an agreement so that any autonomous weapons deployed
[03:17:11.880 --> 03:17:16.480]  before talks conclude will be beyond the reach of a ban understand how
[03:17:16.480 --> 03:17:22.160]  dangerous this is understand the plausible deniability that leaders
[03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:27.960]  would have if you just wipe out an entire area they could say well you know
[03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:34.320]  it was a software glitch sorry sorry mistakes were made I'm not responsible
[03:17:34.320 --> 03:17:40.160]  for this it allows them to distance themselves from mass murder and genocide
[03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:45.600]  but it is also something that is very very easy to get out of control and as
[03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:49.080]  they say once this genie is out of the bottle it is going to be very difficult
[03:17:49.080 --> 03:17:54.400]  to put it back in here's the issue we've already got some autonomous killing
[03:17:54.400 --> 03:17:58.400]  machines we've got systems like the phalanx system from the UK we got the
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:02.800]  iron dome that the United States has created and these when you look at them
[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:08.000]  appear to be legitimate weapons and legitimate use you have a situation in
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:12.720]  both of these cases where these are automated firing systems and that
[03:18:12.720 --> 03:18:16.400]  underscores the difficulty of discernment in this because there's a
[03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:20.760]  continuum of these weapons these are automated firing systems that are meant
[03:18:20.760 --> 03:18:25.720]  to protect ships or local areas from incoming missiles because humans can't
[03:18:25.720 --> 03:18:30.720]  react quickly enough humans can't shoot a moving target like a missile
[03:18:30.720 --> 03:18:34.440]  quickly enough but they can't even react quickly enough so they've created
[03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:39.440]  these defensive weapons like the phalanx like the iron dome to stop
[03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:44.760]  incoming missiles but where does that end in this story they're talking about
[03:18:44.760 --> 03:18:49.080]  how in South Korea they have some automated machine guns that are put
[03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:55.200]  over the demilitarized zone and they say that it requires human intervention but
[03:18:55.200 --> 03:18:59.120]  many people believe that it is automatically firing we also have
[03:18:59.120 --> 03:19:02.800]  Israel deploying machine gun turrets along its border at the Gaza Strip to
[03:19:02.800 --> 03:19:07.320]  target Palestinian infiltrators automatically so you see how it's going
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:10.960]  to gradually and incrementally move until you get something that is quite
[03:19:10.960 --> 03:19:16.640]  literally like the Terminator robot that is where we're headed you need to look
[03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:21.960]  at these videos that they put out of Boston Dynamics now owned by Google of
[03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:27.680]  other robotics companies all now owned by Google you need to take a look at these
[03:19:27.680 --> 03:19:35.680]  videos at the bipeds at the quadrupeds at the bug like machines that are moving
[03:19:35.680 --> 03:19:39.840]  very rapidly getting better all the time you need to ask yourself where this is
[03:19:39.840 --> 03:19:44.960]  going how are we going to get control of this we have to get control of our
[03:19:44.960 --> 03:19:48.400]  government we have to have people who are informed who are going to act at the
[03:19:48.400 --> 03:19:51.840]  local level we're going to contain this and quite frankly this is one of the
[03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:56.120]  most dangerous areas where it is getting out of control when we come back I want
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:19:59.280]  to talk to you though how our government is trying to get preschoolers to love

[03:25:09.520 --> 03:25:13.400]  get control of our politicians control of our government control of our
[03:25:13.400 --> 03:25:17.680]  military spending that's where we're headed folks but there's also other
[03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:20.440]  areas that we're concerned about of course with robots we've talked many
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:24.760]  times about how they are going to create massive unemployment it's not just
[03:25:24.760 --> 03:25:29.880]  replacing and automating one industry it's going to be across the board every
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:32.680]  industry is going to be hit it's not going to be like we've had in the past
[03:25:32.680 --> 03:25:38.160]  where farms are automated so people move to the cities to work in factories that
[03:25:38.160 --> 03:25:41.160]  type of thing we had the industrial revolution no this is going to be a
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:46.600]  revolution that is going to affect jobs at every strata of society every
[03:25:46.600 --> 03:25:52.400]  strata we're looking at unemployment figures of 30 to 50% many and the
[03:25:52.400 --> 03:25:56.560]  transportation industry will be the first ones to be hit but we have to get
[03:25:56.560 --> 03:26:00.480]  accustomed to this don't we that's what the elites believe they think that we
[03:26:00.480 --> 03:26:05.880]  have to get accustomed to this so they're spending $440,000 for robots to
[03:26:05.880 --> 03:26:10.360]  tell preschoolers stories isn't that interesting you know you can have a
[03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:16.040]  human read stories to them you could even have recordings and computer images
[03:26:16.040 --> 03:26:20.440]  if you wanted to of the story that you could read to the kids but they want to
[03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:24.840]  have the robots do that I think that's very telling this is coming of course
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:29.440]  from the National Science Foundation they are seeking to quote push the
[03:26:29.440 --> 03:26:35.160]  envelope of normal storytelling that is aimed at four-year-olds understand
[03:26:35.160 --> 03:26:40.760]  that's where you adjust society for the next generation they always want to get
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:44.480]  a hold of the children at a very early age they want to separate them from their
[03:26:44.480 --> 03:26:48.640]  family they want to condition them for the type of society that they want to
[03:26:48.640 --> 03:26:52.080]  do in the future that's what social engineers have done all the way back to
[03:26:52.080 --> 03:26:58.320]  the time of Plato and Plato's Republic he said we want them to have no mother
[03:26:58.320 --> 03:27:02.800]  and father but the state we want the children to not know who their mothers
[03:27:02.800 --> 03:27:06.000]  and fathers are they have all of their allegiance to the state the state is
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:11.960]  their family well they can also have the robots be the face of the state they
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:15.880]  say that these robots are unique because they can play they can learn they can
[03:27:15.880 --> 03:27:21.960]  engage with children in the real world you know we used to call that parents we
[03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:25.960]  used to call it parents there's to be these beings that would play learn and
[03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:30.880]  engage with their children in the real world they were called mom and dad but
[03:27:30.880 --> 03:27:35.400]  those terms are being banned we don't want our children to interact with people
[03:27:35.400 --> 03:27:40.640]  we want them to interact with with these faceless individuals perhaps as people
[03:27:40.640 --> 03:27:44.720]  that they're interacting with maybe it's a bot that they're interacting with on
[03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:48.600]  social media who knows you never know who you're talking to on social media but
[03:27:48.600 --> 03:27:52.760]  now if it's something physical tangible for these four-year-olds we want them
[03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:57.920]  to be interacting literally with robots they say such robots offer unique
[03:27:57.920 --> 03:28:02.960]  opportunities have guided personalized and controlled social interaction during
[03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:07.440]  the delivery of desired curriculum so it's not just enough for them to
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:11.600]  manipulate our children with the curriculum that they teach them they
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:17.720]  have to also have a controlled social interaction that's their words for it
[03:28:17.720 --> 03:28:24.600]  quite frankly I look at this and we need to at the grassroots level as I said you
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:28.640]  have to stand up for your freedoms and you have to take them individually the
[03:28:28.640 --> 03:28:34.400]  first thing you do is take care of your family get them out of the schools get
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:38.240]  them away from these social engineers and that could mean a private school as
[03:28:38.240 --> 03:28:42.120]  well start your own private school with other friends if they won't let you with
[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:45.520]  because of political situations that they put restraints on how you can
[03:28:45.520 --> 03:28:49.200]  educate your children then get involved in local office and remove those
[03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:53.600]  constraints but you have to protect your children you have to understand as many
[03:28:53.600 --> 03:28:57.280]  have been telling you over the decades back in the 1980s we had Charlotte
[03:28:57.280 --> 03:29:01.440]  Issa be with Phyllis Schlafly talking about the deliberate dumbing down of
[03:29:01.440 --> 03:29:05.800]  America the manipulation of our children making sure that they were not
[03:29:05.800 --> 03:29:09.600]  independent thinkers that was always the goal of education with liberal
[03:29:09.600 --> 03:29:14.480]  education to make independent thinkers that's not what they want these are
[03:29:14.480 --> 03:29:19.160]  social engineers these are people who like the utopian societies in the mid
[03:29:19.160 --> 03:29:24.480]  1800s were concerned because they weren't having the these utopian
[03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:29.400]  communist societies were failing in Oneida and other places they said we need
[03:29:29.400 --> 03:29:33.360]  to separate the children from their parents precisely the same conclusion
[03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:36.640]  that tyrants throughout history have had and that's the way they're doing it
[03:29:36.640 --> 03:29:40.440]  stay with us when we come back we're gonna talk about the TPP as well as the
[03:29:40.440 --> 03:29:44.720]  change in the house leadership we'll be right back
[03:29:47.240 --> 03:29:54.240]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[03:29:54.240 --> 03:29:56.720]  network
[03:29:58.280 --> 03:30:03.200]  air strikes are not always the surgical maneuvers people envision in a sense
[03:30:03.200 --> 03:30:08.280]  civilians have been killed in another botched raid this time in Afghanistan the
[03:30:08.280 --> 03:30:13.040]  Washington Post reports of the 19 killed three were children with the UN
[03:30:13.040 --> 03:30:17.480]  calling the strike an inexcusable war crime doctors without border states that
[03:30:17.480 --> 03:30:21.480]  while militants had recently entered the area none were using the hospital for
[03:30:21.480 --> 03:30:25.560]  offensive measures contrast that with the bombing leaving patients burning in
[03:30:25.560 --> 03:30:29.920]  their beds add this to the famous story of the wedding that became a funeral in
[03:30:29.920 --> 03:30:34.440]  Yemen where 12 people died after an attacking drone confused the party for
[03:30:34.440 --> 03:30:38.880]  another group other reports from January of this year show the deaths of two
[03:30:38.880 --> 03:30:43.920]  hostages including an American citizen in a US drone strike and the father who
[03:30:43.920 --> 03:30:47.320]  had his children shot at for trying to save a camera crew who had been
[03:30:47.320 --> 03:30:51.520]  mistaken for terrorists well this be another example of the military going

[03:33:06.600 --> 03:33:13.240]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:33:13.240 --> 03:33:19.320]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host we have an
[03:33:19.320 --> 03:33:24.880]  article up on infowarse.com homeland security detains Stockton mayor forces
[03:33:24.880 --> 03:33:29.960]  him to hand over his passwords this is a very interesting story because I
[03:33:29.960 --> 03:33:34.840]  there's a number of aspects of this that I think are important first of all the
[03:33:34.840 --> 03:33:39.080]  fact that we still have local people that are close enough to us like mayors
[03:33:39.080 --> 03:33:44.520]  that they are treated like we're treated that they are outraged by this kind of
[03:33:44.520 --> 03:33:48.240]  treatment like we are outraged by this kind of treatment that is where our
[03:33:48.240 --> 03:33:52.560]  hope lies at the local level you're not going to find any salvation with a
[03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:55.400]  president they're too far away from you they're too distant from you they're too
[03:33:55.400 --> 03:33:59.840]  far above you they have a completely different level of concern they don't
[03:33:59.840 --> 03:34:04.880]  live with you government needs to be local it needs to be at the level where
[03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:08.000]  you are that's where you can control it and that's where you can have people
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:12.920]  that don't are not so far removed from the population listen to what he suffered
[03:34:12.920 --> 03:34:18.560]  now this is Stockton California mayor Anthony R Silver he had a attended a
[03:34:18.560 --> 03:34:23.200]  recent mayor's conference in China now coming back from China he was amazed at
[03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:26.760]  how he was treated in San Francisco they say at the San Francisco International
[03:34:26.760 --> 03:34:31.040]  Airport agents with Homeland Security detained him detained the mayor they
[03:34:31.040 --> 03:34:35.560]  confiscated his personal cell phone along with other electronics he said
[03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:39.400]  unfortunately they were not willing or able to produce a search warrant or any
[03:34:39.400 --> 03:34:44.080]  court documents suggesting that they had a legal right to take my property he
[03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:48.320]  told the San Francisco gate he said in addition they were persistent about
[03:34:48.320 --> 03:34:54.280]  requiring my passwords for all devices the mayor's attorney told the San
[03:34:54.280 --> 03:34:57.400]  Francisco gate that he was the mayor was not allowed to leave the airport
[03:34:57.400 --> 03:35:01.440]  without forfeiting his passwords the attorney was not present for his
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:04.280]  interaction with Homeland Security agents either the mayor was told that he
[03:35:04.280 --> 03:35:09.440]  had quote no right for a lawyer to be present and that being a US citizen did
[03:35:09.440 --> 03:35:15.400]  not quote entitle me to any rights that I probably thought I had isn't that
[03:35:15.400 --> 03:35:20.640]  interesting isn't that interesting a wake-up call for the mayor you know we
[03:35:20.640 --> 03:35:24.880]  had a wake-up call a few years ago when they started rolling this out very
[03:35:24.880 --> 03:35:31.240]  quickly now the we've been normalized to that okay we now have come to accept
[03:35:31.240 --> 03:35:37.760]  that as the status quo in our minds but in Texas we had David Simpson who led
[03:35:37.760 --> 03:35:43.080]  a revolt against the sexual molestation of minors by Homeland Security by the
[03:35:43.080 --> 03:35:46.440]  idea that they should be able to put their hands on us so that we would have
[03:35:46.440 --> 03:35:50.440]  to demonstrate to them our innocence before we were allowed to move about in
[03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:56.840]  our country we had a law that was passed unanimously in the state house that said
[03:35:56.840 --> 03:36:01.280]  that they would not be allowed to do that at that time the TSA pushed back very
[03:36:01.280 --> 03:36:04.360]  strongly and said we're going to turn Texas into a no-fly zone we later
[03:36:04.360 --> 03:36:10.440]  learned in a lawsuit by John Corbett when the TSA mistakenly published on
[03:36:10.440 --> 03:36:16.880]  pacer.gov an unredacted copy of some of their communications we learned that
[03:36:16.880 --> 03:36:20.840]  they said at the time the very same time they were threatening to turn Texas into
[03:36:20.840 --> 03:36:25.760]  a no-fly zone they said in their own documents there is no threat against
[03:36:25.760 --> 03:36:30.640]  airports or airplanes and we quite frankly know because of their lax methods
[03:36:30.640 --> 03:36:34.480]  and as security experts have pointed out it is nothing but theater if there
[03:36:34.480 --> 03:36:37.760]  really were a threat we would have had many incidents at this point in time
[03:36:37.760 --> 03:36:41.240]  but we haven't because there isn't a threat they knew there wasn't a threat
[03:36:41.240 --> 03:36:46.000]  and the mayor goes on to say as I was being searched at the airport there was
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:49.240]  a Latino couple to my left an Asian couple to my right also being
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:54.160]  aggressively searched I briefly had to remind myself that this was not North
[03:36:54.160 --> 03:37:00.560]  Korea or Nazi Germany that this is the land of the free is it really is it
[03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:06.560]  really or have we become slaves have we adopted the mindset of the people who
[03:37:06.560 --> 03:37:11.080]  lived in East Germany to see something say something let's tattle on
[03:37:11.080 --> 03:37:16.480]  everybody have we come to accept this that we're going to give up our freedom
[03:37:16.480 --> 03:37:21.520]  for the promise of security as I said many times you give up your freedom for
[03:37:21.520 --> 03:37:27.920]  security slaves are never secure saves slaves are never safe slaves are never
[03:37:27.920 --> 03:37:33.560]  rich when you give up your liberty you have no hope of obtaining safety or
[03:37:33.560 --> 03:37:39.560]  security understand that this is for their safety from you and we cannot
[03:37:39.560 --> 03:37:44.680]  tolerate this we need to get more people in office who are outraged by being
[03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:48.920]  treated like this you need to be outraged when I go to the airport I see
[03:37:48.920 --> 03:37:54.400]  people just willingly going through whatever process the TSA tells them to
[03:37:54.400 --> 03:37:59.120]  go through and not trying to shut the system down in any way whatsoever tell
[03:37:59.120 --> 03:38:02.920]  them that you want to opt out shut it down shut the system down if you have
[03:38:02.920 --> 03:38:06.680]  enough people that'll do that I also do not want to I don't like to fly it's
[03:38:06.680 --> 03:38:11.880]  not my choice I have to do it because of work but I don't want to be forced to
[03:38:11.880 --> 03:38:15.800]  have to not fly anymore I'm not going to let them take that over from me I
[03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:18.880]  understand people boycotting it and I think that's a great thing I think we
[03:38:18.880 --> 03:38:22.920]  need to make the airlines feel some economic pressure but I also don't want
[03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:28.640]  to allow them to completely shut me down now in terms of shutting us down look
[03:38:28.640 --> 03:38:32.680]  at this story on info wars.com the Washington Post editor says repeat
[03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:37.000]  after me I want a gun-free society and this is what he has in his story he
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:44.360]  says imagine prohibition imagine a mass buyback imagine a gun-free society he
[03:38:44.360 --> 03:38:49.120]  says those three words prohibition mass buyback and a gun-free society he says
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:53.920]  the NRA has rendered those as to be unmentionable no it's not the NRA folks
[03:38:53.920 --> 03:38:58.840]  it's the Constitution when you talk about prohibition let's talk about the
[03:38:58.840 --> 03:39:01.520]  major prohibitions that we've had in this country let's talk about alcohol
[03:39:01.520 --> 03:39:08.560]  prohibition was that a success no it was an outright failure what happened
[03:39:08.560 --> 03:39:12.520]  during prohibition we had a massive increase in organized crime we had a
[03:39:12.520 --> 03:39:16.440]  massive corruption of the government we had violence in the streets like we'd
[03:39:16.440 --> 03:39:22.640]  never had before and we had an increase in the in the concentration of alcohol
[03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:27.880]  and you know what the same things have happened with the war on drugs but here's
[03:39:27.880 --> 03:39:32.440]  the fundamental difference between the war on drugs and the failed experiment
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:36.280]  with prohibition that only lasted a few years when we had the prohibition
[03:39:36.280 --> 03:39:39.800]  experiment we actually changed the Constitution because there is no
[03:39:39.800 --> 03:39:43.720]  authority to prohibit alcohol there's no authority for the federal government to
[03:39:43.720 --> 03:39:47.160]  prohibit marijuana or anything else that's not in the Constitution as a
[03:39:47.160 --> 03:39:50.280]  matter of fact they're specifically prohibited from doing that the ninth
[03:39:50.280 --> 03:39:55.840]  and tenth amendments say if you do not have if you've not been given express
[03:39:55.840 --> 03:40:00.680]  authority in these areas it remains to the people and to the states and that's
[03:40:00.680 --> 03:40:04.640]  why they passed the 18th Amendment and then the 21st Amendment to undo
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:07.680]  prohibition but when it came to prohibiting drugs we just ignored the
[03:40:07.680 --> 03:40:12.600]  Constitution and so now we're at the point where the Washington Post wants to
[03:40:12.600 --> 03:40:16.240]  come out and say and turn this all upside down they want to prohibit
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:22.320]  something that is expressly permitted and protected by the Constitution you
[03:40:22.320 --> 03:40:26.400]  understand how criminal this is and of course this is the Washington Post
[03:40:26.400 --> 03:40:32.800]  pushing this this is why Matt Drudge has been so important he was here earlier
[03:40:32.800 --> 03:40:38.960]  today and Matt Drudge has allowed us to transcend the controlled media like
[03:40:38.960 --> 03:40:43.480]  this Washington Post editor Fred Hyatt who says he wants gun prohibition he
[03:40:43.480 --> 03:40:48.800]  wants a gun free society I don't really care what he wants we have a
[03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:52.400]  Constitution and we're gonna fight for that Constitution and you're not going
[03:40:52.400 --> 03:40:56.080]  to change that Constitution we have put up with and I can't understand why
[03:40:56.080 --> 03:40:58.920]  people put up with the government prohibiting things that it doesn't have
[03:40:58.920 --> 03:41:03.240]  the authority to prohibit cancer drugs marijuana whatever the FDA should not be
[03:41:03.240 --> 03:41:06.600]  able to turn this into a situation where everything is prohibited unless
[03:41:06.600 --> 03:41:10.800]  expressly permitted but you understand how they have normalized us to that
[03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:15.280]  mentality just like they've normalized us to the TSA now they want to go to the
[03:41:15.280 --> 03:41:19.520]  next level they want to say that things that are specifically prohibited for
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:23.360]  the government to do and that is to infringe our right to self-protection
[03:41:23.360 --> 03:41:27.840]  our right to protect the nation from foreign invaders with an armed militia
[03:41:27.840 --> 03:41:32.840]  they want to say that they're going to just ignore that Obama has been
[03:41:32.840 --> 03:41:37.200]  floating the idea of gun prohibition making references this weekend to
[03:41:37.200 --> 03:41:40.560]  Australia and the UK saying their places where we've just gotten rid of guns
[03:41:40.560 --> 03:41:45.480]  because they understand that it isn't having any effect when they pass these
[03:41:45.480 --> 03:41:49.280]  gun laws none of these gun laws background checks none of this stuff is
[03:41:49.280 --> 03:41:52.760]  effective because criminals are going to get their guns just like criminals get
[03:41:52.760 --> 03:41:57.160]  their drugs everywhere you can't lock people up in jail and keep them from
[03:41:57.160 --> 03:42:02.760]  overdosing on drugs in a federal jail that's just reality you need to
[03:42:02.760 --> 03:42:06.720]  understand that prohibition doesn't work and they don't have the legal
[03:42:06.720 --> 03:42:10.840]  authority for it anyway but it's not just Obama but now we see the Washington
[03:42:10.840 --> 03:42:14.560]  Post is coming out with this we also have a professor at Georgetown University
[03:42:14.560 --> 03:42:19.360]  who is a government and law professor who is also saying the very same thing on
[03:42:19.360 --> 03:42:23.120]  the very same day so now they say well you know these gun laws didn't work so
[03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:26.720]  we just need outright prohibition you know what outright prohibition isn't going
[03:42:26.720 --> 03:42:31.320]  to work either for the same reason the gun laws don't work but of course we're
[03:42:31.320 --> 03:42:37.100]  going to be propagandized endlessly by the Washington Post and that's why you
[03:42:37.100 --> 03:42:41.280]  need alternative media that's why we put together this piece I think it was
[03:42:41.280 --> 03:42:44.200]  about a year ago that Darren McBrane put this piece together at the time that
[03:42:44.200 --> 03:42:48.560]  the Pentagon came out and and there was that press conference surfaced and this
[03:42:48.560 --> 03:42:52.800]  this one young officer said to the officer that was briefing the group she
[03:42:52.800 --> 03:42:57.720]  said nobody believes us anymore they just think it's outright propaganda and
[03:42:57.720 --> 03:43:01.800]  lies and and they were going back and forth and say yeah you know people can
[03:43:01.800 --> 03:43:06.240]  go the dredge report and they can go to directly to the sources and they're
[03:43:06.240 --> 03:43:09.240]  bypassing us and we just don't have the kind of control we had anymore the kind
[03:43:09.240 --> 03:43:13.400]  of control that they're trying to exercise to the Washington Post and by
[03:43:13.400 --> 03:43:17.240]  the way when you look at that article there's a picture of Jeff Bezos on there
[03:43:17.240 --> 03:43:23.360]  that we have up there because Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon also owns the Washington
[03:43:23.360 --> 03:43:27.240]  Post so just keep that in mind when you do your shopping okay talk about boycotts
[03:43:27.240 --> 03:43:30.520]  or whatever I mean just just understand what you're feeding and I understand I
[03:43:30.520 --> 03:43:35.840]  still get stuff from from Amazon I get books from Amazon like audio books like
[03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:38.880]  the one I'm listening to about the Pentagon's brain but just understand
[03:43:38.880 --> 03:43:43.280]  that all of these guys people like Jeff Bezos he goes to the Bilderberg group he
[03:43:43.280 --> 03:43:47.120]  buys the Washington Post because he wants political clout in Washington
[03:43:47.120 --> 03:43:50.600]  and what is he using that political clout for right now well he's using that
[03:43:50.600 --> 03:43:55.520]  political clout to try to call for outright gun prohibition and again as I
[03:43:55.520 --> 03:44:00.920]  said that's why it's so important for us to be able to transcend the controlled
[03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:06.840]  media we did a report Darren McBreen put this together a lot of clips how Matt
[03:44:06.840 --> 03:44:09.680]  drudged changed the world I want to play a little bit of that for you right
[03:44:09.680 --> 03:44:16.640]  now it's been more than 16 years since Matt drudge gave his historic speech
[03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:22.760]  at the National Press Club on June 2nd 1998 at that time he said that the
[03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:27.800]  mainstream media would go bankrupt that individual bloggers and researchers on
[03:44:27.800 --> 03:44:32.640]  the Internet were just as important as the New York Times the controlled
[03:44:32.640 --> 03:44:38.600]  state-run media had a field day making fun of Matt drudge but today their
[03:44:38.600 --> 03:44:44.440]  hubris has drained away and they're no longer as arrogant as they once were now
[03:44:44.440 --> 03:44:49.720]  we see calls for the FCC to regulate print news and online news and we see
[03:44:49.720 --> 03:44:54.760]  establishment publications like Time Magazine Newsweek and the New York Times
[03:44:54.760 --> 03:45:01.080]  battling to keep from going completely bankrupt and imploding it turns out
[03:45:01.080 --> 03:45:06.520]  pretty much everything that Matt drudge said in that 40-minute speech has now
[03:45:06.520 --> 03:45:11.560]  come true well Matt drudge is saying a lot of things today that the mainstream
[03:45:11.560 --> 03:45:15.760]  media is still laughing at why do they laugh at people that have been proven
[03:45:15.760 --> 03:45:20.240]  right over and over again here are some of the most important moments in my view
[03:45:20.240 --> 03:45:25.560]  from drudge's speech and we're also adding headlines from over the years to
[03:45:25.560 --> 03:45:32.240]  show just how much of what he had to say came true this is something new this
[03:45:32.240 --> 03:45:39.960]  marks the first time that an individual has access to the newswires outside of
[03:45:39.960 --> 03:45:48.360]  a newsroom you get to read all the news from the Associated Press UPI Reuters to
[03:45:48.360 --> 03:45:53.080]  the moral can the moral cane agency French press in the Shenhua I'm a
[03:45:53.080 --> 03:46:00.760]  personal fan of the Shenhua press in time was only newsrooms had access to
[03:46:00.760 --> 03:46:07.520]  the full pictures of the day's events but now any citizen does we get to see
[03:46:07.520 --> 03:46:13.960]  the kinds of cuts that are made for all kinds of reasons endless layers of
[03:46:13.960 --> 03:46:18.160]  editors with endless agendas changing bits and pieces so by the time the
[03:46:18.160 --> 03:46:25.280]  newspaper hits your welcome mat it had no meaning now with a modem anyone can
[03:46:25.280 --> 03:46:33.440]  follow the world and report on the world no middleman no big brother and I guess
[03:46:33.440 --> 03:46:38.120]  this changes everything more than 10 years after breaking the Clinton Lewinsky
[03:46:38.120 --> 03:46:42.640]  story Matt drudge remains more powerful than ever with his website the dredger
[03:46:42.640 --> 03:46:46.720]  report dot com that drudge is a legend on the internet every journalist and
[03:46:46.720 --> 03:46:51.960]  politician in America reads his website on a daily basis when radio lost out to
[03:46:51.960 --> 03:46:59.400]  television there was anxiety the people in the radio business were absolutely
[03:46:59.400 --> 03:47:06.800]  anxious and demanded government stop the upcoming television wave television was
[03:47:06.800 --> 03:47:14.920]  very nervous about other mediums coming forward cable the movies were didn't
[03:47:14.920 --> 03:47:19.080]  want sitcoms to be taped at movie studios for fear it would take away from the
[03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:25.480]  movies no television save the movies the internet is going to save the news
[03:47:25.480 --> 03:47:35.600]  business I envision of a future where there'll be 300 million reporters or
[03:47:35.600 --> 03:47:40.200]  anyone from anywhere can report for any reason it's freedom of participation
[03:47:40.200 --> 03:47:45.240]  absolutely realized first of all you just respected me this badge and my
[03:47:45.240 --> 03:47:50.040]  department you understand me when I'm talking to you you shut your mouth and
[03:47:50.040 --> 03:47:59.520]  you listen did I not give you a warning I know my right you mean the board
[03:47:59.520 --> 03:48:03.840]  obviously your parents don't put a foot in your butt quite enough cuz you don't
[03:48:03.840 --> 03:48:11.640]  understand the meaning respect you see this yes you see this I took the boy you
[03:48:11.640 --> 03:48:18.240]  have a problem with it bring your parents down we'll discuss go for it have
[03:48:18.240 --> 03:48:22.760]  you been there for the ceremony with the the cremation of care frankly that's
[03:48:22.760 --> 03:48:26.400]  that I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about really that's
[03:48:26.400 --> 03:48:30.480]  right well I'm Alex Jones and I snuck in there in 2000 I'm the guy that blew it
[03:48:30.480 --> 03:48:34.400]  wide open and got the video it's been on national TV well I disrespect you for
[03:48:34.400 --> 03:48:39.560]  that you do I do but it's a lot of big public officials that's Alex Jones in
[03:48:39.560 --> 03:48:43.920]  the early days talking to David Gergen a regular attendee at the Bilderberg
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:48.600]  conference about the cremation of care and that's precisely what drudge was
[03:48:48.600 --> 03:48:52.560]  talking about about citizen journalists and about the internet
[03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:55.440]  transcending that if you want to see the rest of that report it's about 15
[03:48:55.440 --> 03:48:59.360]  minutes is how Matt drudge changed the world that's on our YouTube channel
[03:48:59.360 --> 03:49:03.920]  probably put that link up again on our our site at info wars I'm sure there'll
[03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:09.240]  be a clip there from Matt drudge being in studio talking to Alex Jones earlier
[03:49:09.240 --> 03:49:14.360]  today about the state of our society what's going on in our government very
[03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:19.760]  interesting talk that Matt drudge had it's amazing to to see him that today
[03:49:19.760 --> 03:49:24.480]  we're tonight we're going to have a meeting a private meeting on the house
[03:49:24.480 --> 03:49:28.240]  and the Congress they're going to be talking about who the next speaker is
[03:49:28.240 --> 03:49:31.960]  going to be and I want to give you a little bit of background to these guys
[03:49:31.960 --> 03:49:36.120]  because there's a lot of very important things that are coming up and the
[03:49:36.120 --> 03:49:40.280]  speaker has a tremendous amount of power everybody is focused on the
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:44.720]  presidential race but this is something that's going to happen right now and it's
[03:49:44.720 --> 03:49:49.200]  something that you can still influence by calling some of your congressmen now
[03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:52.040]  who are these players that are going that are setting up to replace John
[03:49:52.040 --> 03:49:56.320]  bear first of all we had Kevin McCarthy and he was essentially the
[03:49:56.320 --> 03:50:00.760]  establishment choice and then on Wednesday he went on the Sean Hannity show
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:03.960]  and he made some comments he said I put together them Benghazi investigation
[03:50:03.960 --> 03:50:09.480]  look at her poll numbers now well the Democrats were outraged they said look
[03:50:09.480 --> 03:50:14.400]  at this it just shows that Benghazi was completely political you know what I
[03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:19.600]  agree with them I agree that the Benghazi investigation was completely
[03:50:19.600 --> 03:50:24.320]  political the only thing that the Boehner Republicans and people like
[03:50:24.320 --> 03:50:27.560]  Kevin McCarthy who was trying to take Boehner's place wanted to do out of that
[03:50:27.560 --> 03:50:33.120]  was to score some cheap political shots at Hillary Clinton and they're exactly
[03:50:33.120 --> 03:50:37.360]  right it's not right to say that there wasn't any criminal action with Benghazi
[03:50:37.360 --> 03:50:40.600]  that there wasn't any criminal action with the emails that there weren't issues
[03:50:40.600 --> 03:50:44.800]  where Obama should have been impeached but we've seen over and over again that
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:49.480]  the establishment GOP leadership has merely taken the opportunity to
[03:50:49.480 --> 03:50:54.960]  ingrandize themselves politically but they will never purge the corruption they
[03:50:54.960 --> 03:50:58.560]  own it they want to be part of it they want to have that power when they take
[03:50:58.560 --> 03:51:06.160]  the reins stay with us we'll be right back hey neighbor what are you doing

[03:54:54.240 --> 03:54:58.800]  now back in stock at info wars life calm now just before the break I was
[03:54:58.800 --> 03:55:04.920]  talking about the house speaker race that is heating up tonight remember that
[03:55:04.920 --> 03:55:10.240]  it was just this summer that Mark Meadows introduced an off by a motion to
[03:55:10.240 --> 03:55:16.320]  vacate the seat for John Boehner in other words just go just resign at first he
[03:55:16.320 --> 03:55:19.080]  was laughed at then they looked at it and they said hey you know what we don't
[03:55:19.080 --> 03:55:24.480]  have the votes it was a razor thin margin and it was just before recess so they
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:28.600]  decided they would wait they would work on the congressman and the GOP and see
[03:55:28.600 --> 03:55:32.880]  if they could maintain his position obviously they realized that they were
[03:55:32.880 --> 03:55:37.240]  not going to be able to keep people in line and so when they came back from
[03:55:37.240 --> 03:55:40.560]  recess John Boehner announced that he's going to take take an immediate
[03:55:40.560 --> 03:55:44.480]  retirement you know it's the kind of you can't fire me I quit type of attitude
[03:55:44.480 --> 03:55:48.280]  you're not going to have Nixon to kick around anymore that type of thing it's
[03:55:48.280 --> 03:55:52.040]  so good that's fine don't let the door hit you on the way out okay but who is
[03:55:52.040 --> 03:55:55.480]  replacing him as I mentioned before we have Kevin McCarthy that's the GOP
[03:55:55.480 --> 03:55:59.320]  establishments candidate apparently there he was the one that they put up and
[03:55:59.320 --> 03:56:03.720]  he was the one who bragged this last Wednesday about how they put together the
[03:56:03.720 --> 03:56:06.920]  Benghazi investigation look at what it did to Hillary Clinton's poll numbers
[03:56:06.920 --> 03:56:12.320]  that's being used now in commercials to revitalize Hillary Clinton to say
[03:56:12.320 --> 03:56:17.120]  there's nothing to this no there's a lot to that that's one of the things that
[03:56:17.120 --> 03:56:21.080]  people are so upset with the GOP leadership or there are many issues for
[03:56:21.080 --> 03:56:25.040]  which Hillary should have been prosecuted for which Obama should have
[03:56:25.040 --> 03:56:29.480]  been impeached and they do nothing because they won't go beyond just using
[03:56:29.480 --> 03:56:34.400]  it for cheap political gain and that's precisely what Kevin McCarthy did so the
[03:56:34.400 --> 03:56:38.900]  Democrats are right about that that's all it was it should have been a real
[03:56:38.900 --> 03:56:41.800]  criminal investigation there should have been real consequences but there weren't
[03:56:41.800 --> 03:56:46.280]  and you're not going to get that from the GOP leadership so after that happened
[03:56:46.280 --> 03:56:51.080]  on Wednesday that's huge moment they say it was a gaffe no it was a moment of
[03:56:51.080 --> 03:56:56.520]  candor okay it was it was a candid truth where he told people what was going on
[03:56:56.520 --> 03:57:02.640]  so Sunday we had Jason Chafetz enter the race now who is this guy is he
[03:57:02.640 --> 03:57:05.440]  somebody that we can trust let me give you a little bit of background on Jason
[03:57:05.440 --> 03:57:11.720]  Chafetz okay his father was a co-chair of the Dukakis campaign in his state his
[03:57:11.720 --> 03:57:16.440]  father had been married to Dukakis's former wife so he's got long roots on
[03:57:16.440 --> 03:57:20.400]  both sides of this when he decided he was going to come into politics in 2009
[03:57:20.400 --> 03:57:24.760]  just before the massive influx of Republicans in 2010 he positioned
[03:57:24.760 --> 03:57:30.680]  himself as a Tea Party candidate has he operated as a Tea Party candidate well
[03:57:30.680 --> 03:57:35.760]  let me tell you the same guy Mark Meadows who said he was tired of the
[03:57:35.760 --> 03:57:40.440]  heavy-handedness the heavy-handed rule of John Boehner when anybody would not do
[03:57:40.440 --> 03:57:44.800]  exactly as he said he threw him off of subcommittees they were upset with his
[03:57:44.800 --> 03:57:50.520]  position on issues well it was the same Mark Meadows that Jason Chafetz threw
[03:57:50.520 --> 03:57:54.440]  off of a subcommittee because he wouldn't do what the GOP leadership wanted
[03:57:54.440 --> 03:57:59.720]  on the trade promotion authority because he opposed the TPP because he
[03:57:59.720 --> 03:58:04.240]  opposed the unconstitutional operation of fast-track he was thrown off the
[03:58:04.240 --> 03:58:10.400]  subcommittee by Jason Chafetz is Jason Chafetz nothing but a new face for the
[03:58:10.400 --> 03:58:14.520]  same old politics in my opinion yes and so that leaves us with the third person
[03:58:14.520 --> 03:58:20.440]  who is a little-known congressman from Florida and nobody gives him much of a
[03:58:20.440 --> 03:58:24.920]  chance but we need to take a look at him at least he opposed the Trans-Pacific
[03:58:24.920 --> 03:58:28.440]  Partnership tonight Info Wars Nightly News Leanne McAdoo we're going to take a
[03:58:28.440 --> 03:58:33.920]  look at this launch of the Strong Cities Network a UN initiative for global
