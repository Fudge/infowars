[00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:05.415]  This is going to be a transmission.
[00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:06.336]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:08.116]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:09.876]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.437]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:12.997]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:17.178]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:22.659]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:30.441]  We knew that they would be coming after the guns in an unprecedented manner in the last year of President Obama's administration.
[00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:38.959]  We knew that they would either use real crises to demonize the Second Amendment or produce those crises.
[00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:46.083]  And we are now seeing Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, CNN, The Washington Post.
[00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:51.547]  I mean, I've got a stack of news today, a stack of news yesterday.
[00:00:51.547 --> 00:00:57.390]  We've got a whole bunch of clips where they are saying it's time to take the guns.
[00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.172]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:13.421]  After all the denials, we don't want your guns, they keep saying there can't be one more shooting or we've got to take your guns.
[00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:17.463]  As if citizens in general are committing these crimes.
[00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:24.285]  When these crimes are flat, less than 170 people a year die.
[00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:27.586]  But they want to project the blame collectively.
[00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:31.908]  Like they say, you're racist if you don't support Obamacare.
[00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:44.876]  We have a special report up on InfoWars.com, the title, Obama Wants Your Guns Despite Committing War Crimes in the Middle East that have killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:49.318]  Where are they personalizing the people killed by radical jihadists?
[00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:55.401]  Where are they personalizing all the people getting raped in Europe by the giant refugee flows?
[00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:57.062]  That's in the news today.
[00:01:57.062 --> 00:02:03.545]  Where are the personalization stories about all those killed in Mexico and the United States by the Fast and Furious program?
[00:02:05.563 --> 00:02:08.186]  Lo and behold, there'll be no coverage of that.
[00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:19.938]  And we have the Oregon Sheriff, where the shooting happened last Thursday, saying gun control is not the answer, and residents agree the LA Times accurately reports.
[00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:22.741]  You can say what you want about the LA Times, they occasionally actually tell the truth.
[00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:26.925]  They're like, actually gun crime's way down, but people think it's up.
[00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:28.807]  Actually, the Sheriff's being supported.
[00:02:30.114 --> 00:02:41.522]  Well, the Bloomberg Group, CNN and others, we have the clips, are all saying he should resign right now and basically implying he killed the 10 people.
[00:02:41.522 --> 00:02:50.949]  When he didn't even have the jurisdiction over the gun-free zone at the State College, where they had their own security people.
[00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.310]  But, you see, it fits the bill.
[00:02:53.737 --> 00:03:01.180]  Of attacking local police, local sheriffs, with the national media projecting they're all a bunch of racist white guys.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.843]  Or even if they're black, you know, they've got some secret racist agenda like Sheriff Clark or the sheriff in Travis County who's a Democrat.
[00:03:08.843 --> 00:03:10.423]  But he's black!
[00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:15.545]  And he deports like five violent felon illegals a week!
[00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:17.746]  Oh my gosh!
[00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:19.787]  You can't deport someone that has felonies!
[00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.762]  He's got to be removed!
[00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:25.824]  He's evil!
[00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:27.045]  This is a revolution.
[00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:31.829]  This is a globalist takeover by every stretch of the imagination.
[00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.492]  It is tyranny.
[00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:37.514]  So, we're going to break all that down.
[00:03:37.514 --> 00:03:41.457]  Huge developments with the NATO situation.
[00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:44.540]  Warning Russia over incursions into Turkish airspace now.
[00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:55.258]  Because the Al-Qaeda forces build up on the Turkish side and on the Iraq side and then inject in to attack.
[00:03:55.258 --> 00:03:58.620]  A lot of times getting Turkish artillery support, of course.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.441]  This is a major military operation.
[00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:01.781]  Western run.
[00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:05.163]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski is saying, let's go ahead and strike Russia.
[00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:14.824]  You know, he's got access to the former National Security Advisor to the bunkers, I guess, so he thinks he can live through a nuclear war.
[00:04:14.824 --> 00:04:22.651]  He just wants to go start wars with Russian allies and invade them with proxy armies.
[00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:25.413]  NATO's now saying Russian ground troops are in Syria.
[00:04:25.413 --> 00:04:28.036]  Turkey's air spade has been violated again, they say.
[00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:35.918]  And yes, there are thousands and thousands of Russian troops reportedly a day now being injected in.
[00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:37.678]  This is big.
[00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:38.479]  This is big.
[00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.980]  Russia knows it's going to face a major Saudi-NATO counteroffensive.
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:56.585]  And so it believes it's injecting enough troops in to protect its air force as it engages the NATO proxy army and NATO mercenaries in what could shape up to be the next big world war.
[00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:01.185]  Kit Daniels, InfoWurst.com.
[00:05:01.185 --> 00:05:05.926]  CNN reportedly altered the photo of the biracial organ shooter to make him look more white.
[00:05:05.926 --> 00:05:08.587]  Now, that's a shocking revelation, so let me repeat that.
[00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:14.348]  CNN apparently doctored the photo of the biracial organ shooter, Christopher Mercer, to make people think he's Caucasian.
[00:05:14.348 --> 00:05:23.110]  Mercer uploaded a selfie to social media, but when CNN used the photo in its news broadcast, Mercer's skin tone had dramatically changed to that of a white man.
[00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.391]  Furthermore, CNN did not show photos of Mercer's mother, who is African American.
[00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:33.634]  And the network also didn't report that Mercer was involved in a school play, which contradicts the media's claim that he was a loner.
[00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:34.674]  Why would they do that?
[00:05:34.674 --> 00:05:40.997]  Because a biracial Oregon shooter does not fit into the establishment's propaganda that mass shooters are white racist men.
[00:05:40.997 --> 00:05:48.361]  They also don't want you to know that Mercer was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, because it would be a political nightmare for Obama if the public knew the truth.
[00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:55.223]  It'd be hard for him to demand more gun control if more people started to realize that President Obama is fueling racial division across the U.S.
[00:05:55.223 --> 00:05:58.805]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:58.805 --> 00:05:59.745]  Alex Jones here.

[00:06:18.132 --> 00:06:19.733]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:25.096]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.

[00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:11.685]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:14.387]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:17.949]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:24.254]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:07:24.254 --> 00:07:29.118]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:07:29.378 --> 00:07:35.762]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:07:35.762 --> 00:07:43.507]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:07:43.507 --> 00:07:51.051]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:54.654]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:54.654 --> 00:07:57.595]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:02.166 --> 00:08:04.527]  I was trained in firearms.
[00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:06.649]  I carried a concealed weapon.
[00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:15.633]  I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.
[00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:29.481]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:08:31.405 --> 00:08:36.286]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:36.286 --> 00:08:39.567]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:39.567 --> 00:08:46.789]  We are ruled by a social engineering class that uses our goodwill, our humanity against us.
[00:08:46.789 --> 00:09:00.392]  They guilt us into signing on and at least passively acquiescing to their global hegemonic planetary corporate government that is anti-human and that is very close to completing
[00:09:01.328 --> 00:09:15.961]  The establishment of a global army, a global tax, and global courts, and global bureaucrats, global political and religious magistrates to carry out the agenda.
[00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:23.889]  Which is not some Star Trekian, Kumbaya, peace fleet going into space together to help little green men.
[00:09:25.276 --> 00:09:34.061]  No, it is a technocracy meant to end humanity as we know it, so the elite can transcend and become gods.
[00:09:34.061 --> 00:09:35.982]  I'm not saying they're going to achieve that.
[00:09:35.982 --> 00:09:37.702]  That's their cosmology.
[00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.503]  That's their cult religion.
[00:09:39.503 --> 00:09:41.784]  That's what these people believe.
[00:09:41.784 --> 00:09:43.525]  It's what they're pushing for.
[00:09:43.525 --> 00:09:45.266]  It's their goal.
[00:09:45.266 --> 00:09:49.949]  And this transmission is just an ongoing chronicle of humanity
[00:09:51.411 --> 00:10:03.179]  Fighting against these tyrants and tracking what the tyrants are engaged in so that humanity can begin to get mobilized, organized in defense of human liberty.
[00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:09.583]  And I know we'll be successful because as the globalist program unfolds,
[00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:22.501]  People will then go back and listen to what we've said, what we've written, what we have exposed, as they're now doing, and will understand that we do have our finger on the global pulse.
[00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:25.003]  We do have our finger on the zeitgeist.
[00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:27.685]  We do understand how the elite operate.
[00:10:27.685 --> 00:10:31.347]  We do know what their endgame is, and we know how to stop them.
[00:10:31.347 --> 00:10:40.994]  And the future that we're promoting is an open source, free humanity, non-utopia.
[00:10:40.994 --> 00:10:42.295]  But it is not a dystopia.
[00:10:43.746 --> 00:10:48.167]  It is free will and the great animating contest of liberty.
[00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:50.228]  And that's what I stand for.
[00:10:50.228 --> 00:10:51.988]  That's what we stand for.
[00:10:51.988 --> 00:10:53.689]  That's what the Infowar is.
[00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:57.390]  The truth will set you free and we are seeking it.
[00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.771]  We don't have a corner on the truth.
[00:10:59.771 --> 00:11:04.332]  We don't have 100% truth, but our hearts are looking for truth.
[00:11:04.332 --> 00:11:07.573]  Our souls are pointed at the truth like our North Star.
[00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:19.325]  Obviously, we have a giant transmission today.
[00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:24.609]  The enemy is launching its attack on humanity on every front.
[00:11:24.609 --> 00:11:37.678]  The social attacks on the family, the attacks on world currencies, the attacks on rural communities, the attacks on producers, the attacks on free market, the attacks on small businesses, the attacks on sovereignty.
[00:11:39.039 --> 00:11:48.865]  Western world flooded with immigrant populations, put on government payroll immediately to be a destabilization force and to drive down wages.
[00:11:48.865 --> 00:12:01.373]  We're seeing religious leaders from Protestant, Catholic, to Buddhist, to Islamic, getting in line with the big banks, calling for one world government, calling for UN control.
[00:12:01.373 --> 00:12:03.215]  We're seeing the Pope promote world government.
[00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:20.842]  We're seeing the TPP signed and agreed to yesterday and still the details are secret, but the three sections we've got admit it ends internet freedom as we know it, expands copyright to free speech, creates draconian attacks on whistleblowers,
[00:12:21.503 --> 00:12:30.969]  Shuts down domestic businesses that aren't in line with global regulations, creates planetary taxes, creates internet taxes, and every other nightmare you can imagine.
[00:12:30.969 --> 00:12:32.891]  I mean, it's so over-the-top.
[00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:47.741]  Forced GMOs worldwide, forced medical standards worldwide, basically Obamacare worldwide, where insurance companies can break down other people's laws and double and triple charge so they can gouge you on medicine prices.
[00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:51.203]  I mean, you want a crony capitalist fascist gang rape.
[00:12:51.924 --> 00:12:57.051]  Wrapped in a big giant communist tortilla.
[00:12:57.051 --> 00:12:59.454]  You're getting it.
[00:12:59.454 --> 00:13:05.343]  This is a giant, above-the-law, tax-exempt, megacorporation monstrosity.
[00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:23.693]  The globalists are launching invasions of almost every sector of Northern, Eastern, Western, and Central Africa with Al-Qaeda, Western-funded, Saudi Arabian-quarterbacked, Jihad forces.
[00:13:23.693 --> 00:13:30.418]  Then NATO comes in through AFRICOM and takes over in the response to the
[00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.453]  Al-Qaeda mercenaries who are only the pretext for the West to be there.
[00:13:35.453 --> 00:13:48.144]  Even African leaders are saying, we think we're battling Al-Qaeda, then we see it's white mercenaries from Afrikan, from France, from Germany, from Belgium, from the Netherlands, from England.
[00:13:48.144 --> 00:13:49.665]  It's on, folks!
[00:13:49.665 --> 00:13:56.972]  Proxy armies have been launched out of Saudi Arabia and Turkey against Libya, against Egypt, against Syria, against Iraq.
[00:13:58.231 --> 00:14:21.731]  It is a giant proxy war starting a Shiite-Sunni civil war worldwide, flooding Asia, flooding Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Russia, Western Europe, the UK, the United States, Canada, Australia, with the actual Sunni refugees of the conflicts that Saudi Arabia started.
[00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:23.933]  These are not Shiite.
[00:14:23.933 --> 00:14:24.933]  These are not
[00:14:25.874 --> 00:14:26.714]  Alawite.
[00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:28.715]  These are not Christian refugees.
[00:14:28.715 --> 00:14:33.017]  That's now on record.
[00:14:33.017 --> 00:14:46.364]  They will use that next phase of the operation to further destabilize the West and then have the security services pretext to come in and really take everybody's liberties.
[00:14:46.364 --> 00:14:48.985]  Then they'll do another bait-and-switch, which they've already done.
[00:14:51.684 --> 00:15:05.296]  To announce, oh, the enemy isn't radical Islam, it's the veterans, the gun owners, the conservatives, the libertarians, just as they signed a global agreement a week ago that's gotten almost no press.
[00:15:05.296 --> 00:15:07.879]  Infowars didn't even cover it.
[00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:09.840]  Drudge Report linked to Breitbart covering it.
[00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:28.645]  That's why it's good that there's other organizations out there, because I can't keep track of how fast this is moving, that a global agreement was signed with, in fact, let me bring that out of my stack from yesterday, we have the Justice Department's own announcement, it's not just on Breitbart, this is not just our opinion, saying we're preparing a U.N.
[00:15:28.645 --> 00:15:32.867]  force with local mayors to be deputized under the U.N.
[00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:33.708]  under U.N.
[00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:38.791]  speech regulations to go after right-wing extremists, libertarians, gun owners, veterans.
[00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:48.148]  And follow the Homeland Security guidebook on threats, which again states returning vets, veterans, gun owners, Christians, are the enemy.
[00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:51.531]  And then all these sheriffs around the country saying, we've got armored vehicles.
[00:15:53.243 --> 00:15:58.207]  For the American people, for the veterans, for the constitutionalists, for the gun owners.
[00:15:58.207 --> 00:15:59.588]  These are quotes.
[00:15:59.588 --> 00:16:05.273]  There's the headline, Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremism in the US.
[00:16:05.273 --> 00:16:12.179]  And if you read down, they have the quotes, mobilizing the mayors under munialization, that's UN control.
[00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:18.485]  Remember Arnold five years ago when he went to the big Copenhagen Denmark World Government Treaty for the carbon tax?
[00:16:19.599 --> 00:16:26.824]  And when they couldn't get it passed, he said, that's fine, I will lead the Governor Association and the Mayoral Association.
[00:16:26.824 --> 00:16:31.707]  He wasn't even governor anymore, but I'm going to organize the mayors mainly to implement carbon taxes.
[00:16:31.707 --> 00:16:33.369]  They're now doing it.
[00:16:33.369 --> 00:16:35.450]  They're now doing it.
[00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.413]  This is the beginning of World War IV.
[00:16:39.413 --> 00:16:47.899]  But World War IV, because again, the Pentagon, if you read deeply, and you read PNAC as well, Rebuilding America's Defenses and Other Documents by Top Think Tanks,
[00:16:49.386 --> 00:17:03.969]  They call the Cold War, the Middle Eastern Wars, all the other skirmish wars from the end of Korea right through Vietnam right up until 9-11, they call that World War III.
[00:17:06.018 --> 00:17:07.219]  This is World War 4.
[00:17:07.219 --> 00:17:08.460]  It's cyber war.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.901]  It's currency war.
[00:17:09.901 --> 00:17:13.103]  It's soft kill vaccine bio war.
[00:17:13.103 --> 00:17:14.725]  It's GMO war.
[00:17:14.725 --> 00:17:15.946]  It's economic war.
[00:17:15.946 --> 00:17:18.908]  It's open borders immigrant flood war.
[00:17:18.908 --> 00:17:20.869]  It is proxy war.
[00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.692]  It is overthrowing states at an accelerated rate.
[00:17:23.692 --> 00:17:30.717]  This is, in their words, look it up, World War 4.
[00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.698]  We are now in World War 4.
[00:17:33.817 --> 00:17:42.762]  And it just hit me before the show today that I've read all their documents, I mean, I've gone over their research, I've covered this before, we talked about the Global Destabilization Program that was coming.
[00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:44.243]  This is now it.
[00:17:44.243 --> 00:17:46.865]  This is World War 4.
[00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:56.731]  And this is why we've said, you know, you can see the ominous storm clouds, you can feel the concern in your gut and your spirit, you can see all the signs, you can see the preparations, you can see it in the world leader's eyes.
[00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:06.276]  Because the globalists that own the mega banks and that own the big central corporations, they run the politicians and the generals.
[00:18:06.276 --> 00:18:10.778]  The politicians and the generals just want to go play golf and visit their mistress after work.
[00:18:10.778 --> 00:18:18.062]  Some of them want more power, obviously, and they want a global government so that they can be powerful in that next level.
[00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:21.312]  And so many of them are very, very evil.
[00:18:21.312 --> 00:18:41.221]  But when you get above the people that are the minions and you get to the real controllers, these are very, very, very twisted, very, very committed to evil, very, very wicked, very, very dark people who serve destruction, who serve enslavement.
[00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:42.661]  And this is their push.
[00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:44.282]  It's biblical.
[00:18:44.282 --> 00:18:45.923]  It's not driven by logic.
[00:18:45.923 --> 00:18:48.044]  It's driven by a crazed,
[00:18:49.278 --> 00:18:55.781]  Bloodthirsty, surging satanic power.
[00:18:55.781 --> 00:18:57.542]  And that's why everything's coming out.
[00:18:57.542 --> 00:19:01.283]  That they keep the Chinese distance alive while they harvest their organs.
[00:19:01.283 --> 00:19:03.944]  They keep the babies alive while they harvest their organs.
[00:19:03.944 --> 00:19:08.326]  They put the baby flavoring in the testing systems for the soft drinks and the food.
[00:19:08.326 --> 00:19:12.228]  They put precursors, psychotropics, in much of the processed food.
[00:19:12.228 --> 00:19:13.369]  There's drugs in water.
[00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:14.829]  Drugs in just everywhere.
[00:19:14.829 --> 00:19:16.250]  We're all being drugged.
[00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.950]  We're being hit.
[00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.611]  I mean, we are in World War IV, folks.
[00:19:19.031 --> 00:19:30.260]  You're living in a hardcore science fiction movie, cashless societies coming in, implantable chips to buy and sell, mass hack attacks, power outages, EMPs, all of it.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.863]  And it's going to be rolled out incrementally.
[00:19:33.863 --> 00:19:35.765]  As we fight them, we may be able to push them back.
[00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:40.049]  But you need to understand, they're making their move.
[00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:42.471]  They're trying to bring in the Antichrist.
[00:19:42.471 --> 00:19:44.854]  They're trying to bring in world government.
[00:19:44.854 --> 00:19:47.537]  They're trying to bring their system to the fore.
[00:19:47.537 --> 00:19:49.579]  They're trying to give birth.
[00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:55.685]  And Christians believe they're supposed to lay down and let the devil be born on earth, and then they're going to get teleported up to heaven.
[00:19:55.685 --> 00:19:56.887]  No, you're supposed to resist it!
[00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:06.017]  My name is Bill Bunner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:20:06.017 --> 00:20:11.499]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:20:11.499 --> 00:20:16.040]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.322]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:20:20.322 --> 00:20:24.583]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:20:25.163 --> 00:20:28.305]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:28.305 --> 00:20:31.247]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:20:31.247 --> 00:20:35.669]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:36.770]  They did.
[00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:41.813]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:20:41.813 --> 00:20:42.973]  They did.
[00:20:42.973 --> 00:20:46.836]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:20:46.836 --> 00:20:49.197]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:20:49.197 --> 00:20:50.718]  This will affect us all.
[00:20:50.718 --> 00:20:52.619]  You can watch the video for free right now.
[00:20:52.699 --> 00:20:53.180]  I think.
[00:21:02.189 --> 00:21:11.795]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:21:11.795 --> 00:21:14.497]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:21:14.497 --> 00:21:18.060]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:24.324]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:21:24.324 --> 00:21:29.027]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:21:29.327 --> 00:21:35.712]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:43.377]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:21:43.377 --> 00:21:50.822]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[00:22:28.516 --> 00:22:31.559]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:34.201]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:22:34.201 --> 00:22:34.942]  Croix River.
[00:22:34.942 --> 00:22:35.983]  I loved my dad.
[00:22:35.983 --> 00:22:37.184]  The boy was too stubborn.
[00:22:37.184 --> 00:22:40.146]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:40.146 --> 00:22:40.667]  His excuse?
[00:22:40.667 --> 00:22:42.348]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:42.348 --> 00:22:43.969]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:22:43.969 --> 00:22:44.630]  At less than $107 per month,
[00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:49.713]  LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.901]  Come and take it!
[00:24:06.318 --> 00:24:10.862]  And yes, my friends, this is Alex Jones here, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:24:10.862 --> 00:24:13.664]  Yes, I am trying to be alarmist.
[00:24:13.664 --> 00:24:18.529]  Just like Paul Revere was being alarmist, we are under attack.
[00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:19.649]  This is a takeover.
[00:24:19.649 --> 00:24:27.716]  Our criminal hijacked government, our occupied government, by globalists, funds radical Islamic jihadists.
[00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:29.438]  Actual Al-Qaeda by name.
[00:24:31.229 --> 00:24:39.473]  And tells Russia how dare you bomb these targets when they're attacking even Russian targets in southern Russia.
[00:24:39.473 --> 00:24:52.038]  And then they have the nerve to have the Attorney General with the United Nations announce the launch of Strong Cities Network to strengthen community resilience against violent extremism.
[00:24:53.618 --> 00:25:00.405]  And that's the Feds doing the ADL and Southern Priority Law Centers hardcore brainwashing.
[00:25:00.405 --> 00:25:05.110]  We have the videos of Sheriff's Departments and Police Departments in Austin, Texas.
[00:25:06.337 --> 00:25:29.913]  In Kansas City, in other areas, where they get up there with straight faces, and they're made, the police are made, to go sit and listen to the Southern Poverty Law Center and others, and the ADL gives the police chiefs awards and all the rest of it, even Hollywood stars show up, and they actually badmouth the Founding Fathers, they badmouth the Second Amendment, they badmouth private property, they sit there and talk about the Tea Party like it's criminal!
[00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:40.001]  The most conservative, libertarian, lowest crime rate, salt of the earth, red, white and blue, 4th of July people.
[00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:48.426]  But being 4th of July is illegal now, according to these crooks, because they hate this country.
[00:25:48.426 --> 00:25:50.988]  Now I'm not saying the police that go to these meetings are bad.
[00:25:50.988 --> 00:25:52.469]  Most of them hate it.
[00:25:52.469 --> 00:25:54.290]  How do you think we get the information?
[00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.451]  Most police chiefs don't like having to go to it.
[00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:59.213]  But if they don't go, they get removed from office.
[00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:08.006]  And now the feds are coming in taking over the local police departments with United Nations guidelines.
[00:26:08.006 --> 00:26:11.048]  Remember the UN saying Arpaio should be arrested?
[00:26:11.048 --> 00:26:13.809]  Because he arrests illegals that commit crimes?
[00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:14.770]  It's so incredible!
[00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.831]  You arrested an illegal who was drunk driving!
[00:26:16.831 --> 00:26:18.292]  It's unheard of!
[00:26:18.292 --> 00:26:24.036]  As if that's anti-Hispanic, or anti-Chinese, or anti-Eastern European.
[00:26:24.036 --> 00:26:30.761]  I don't care if you're Polish, if you're Mexican, if you're Venezuelan, if you're Russian, if you're South African, black or white.
[00:26:31.682 --> 00:26:38.968]  You're out drunk driving, blowing, you know, 2.0 or whatever it is, you go to jail!
[00:26:38.968 --> 00:26:41.470]  But this is how we've already gone under U.N.
[00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:42.611]  control.
[00:26:42.611 --> 00:26:44.172]  They're launching on every front.
[00:26:44.172 --> 00:26:47.175]  I used to have like one article a week where they're banning the word mother and father.
[00:26:47.175 --> 00:26:49.397]  I get like five a day now.
[00:26:49.397 --> 00:26:55.562]  I used to get one article a week where they're tearing out old bathrooms and putting in bathrooms for transgender
[00:26:56.494 --> 00:27:04.198]  Or saying, this bathroom's now transgender, so you go in the bathroom, I've now gone into them, and you see a woman in the bathroom, and you're like, what the?
[00:27:04.198 --> 00:27:11.082]  You know, I don't, I mean, I'll be, I don't want to get graphic here, but I don't, I'm not super shy, but I don't like being in a bathroom with other men.
[00:27:11.082 --> 00:27:12.843]  I kind of, oh, good, this bathroom's empty.
[00:27:12.843 --> 00:27:16.125]  You run in there, you know.
[00:27:16.125 --> 00:27:18.827]  I just, it's all about messing with us.
[00:27:18.827 --> 00:27:22.909]  And now Houston's voting to put in transgender bathrooms.
[00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:24.570]  That's our new GDP.
[00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.951]  Transgender bathrooms.
[00:27:29.175 --> 00:27:30.836]  People are like, yeah, these liberals are crazy.
[00:27:30.836 --> 00:27:31.536]  They're not crazy.
[00:27:31.536 --> 00:27:32.377]  They run the show.
[00:27:32.377 --> 00:27:33.398]  They tell us how to talk.
[00:27:33.398 --> 00:27:34.538]  They tell us how to live.
[00:27:34.538 --> 00:27:37.780]  They tell us what to do.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:43.124]  They put hardcore Nazis in charge of Ukraine to murder people en masse.
[00:27:43.124 --> 00:27:45.385]  Actual Nazis that howl Hitler.
[00:27:45.385 --> 00:27:47.026]  Meet with the Vice President.
[00:27:47.026 --> 00:27:50.208]  Our media says they're good.
[00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:56.011]  But then if you're not a Nazi and you oppose Obamacare, they call you a Nazi.
[00:27:56.011 --> 00:27:57.172]  See how sick they are?
[00:27:57.172 --> 00:27:58.133]  How evil they are?
[00:27:59.482 --> 00:28:03.505]  Planned Parenthood, all of it?
[00:28:03.505 --> 00:28:04.185]  It's all happening.
[00:28:04.185 --> 00:28:11.750]  They're making their move on every front right now, and they're doing it because they were a good 10 years behind schedule for global government.
[00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.552]  People are opposing it everywhere.
[00:28:13.552 --> 00:28:14.953]  GMO's in trouble.
[00:28:14.953 --> 00:28:19.816]  Open borders is in trouble.
[00:28:19.816 --> 00:28:28.082]  So they know they've got to complete their agenda, and they've got to act like everybody supports it, and basically just run a giant con game on everyone.
[00:28:29.162 --> 00:28:44.875]  Gallup says that 69% of Hispanic Americans that are citizens, but also even non-citizens, just polled Hispanics, do not want open borders and don't want more immigration.
[00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:49.599]  Because they just left the collapsing third world, they know what's happening.
[00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:52.001]  It's more like 85% in other polls.
[00:28:52.001 --> 00:28:57.225]  But they claim every Hispanic in America wants an open border and you're racist if you don't support it.
[00:28:58.451 --> 00:29:02.674]  Or, you're racist if you don't support Obamacare, or you're racist if you don't turn your guns in.
[00:29:02.674 --> 00:29:03.515]  That's what they say.
[00:29:03.515 --> 00:29:05.957]  It's racist white people that want guns.
[00:29:05.957 --> 00:29:06.257]  Really?
[00:29:06.257 --> 00:29:11.521]  I want everybody to have guns, including criminals, because they're going to have guns anyways.
[00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:14.123]  I want zero gun laws, just like we had before 1968.
[00:29:14.123 --> 00:29:24.131]  It is absolutely imperative right now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:37.862]  That we break out of the trance and realize the Republicans aren't conservative, the Democrats aren't liberal, the top echelon is bought and paid for by crooks who have conquered this nation and now want to conquer us individually.
[00:29:37.862 --> 00:29:38.542]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:38.542 --> 00:29:40.743]  Do you believe World War 4 has begun?
[00:29:40.743 --> 00:29:40.903]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:40.903 --> 00:29:42.003]  First time callers.
[00:29:42.003 --> 00:29:42.444]  We're on the march.
[00:29:42.444 --> 00:29:43.044]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:43.044 --> 00:29:44.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.033 --> 00:30:02.955]  Airstrikes are not always the surgical maneuvers people envision.
[00:30:02.955 --> 00:30:08.357]  Innocent civilians have been killed in another botched raid, this time in Afghanistan.
[00:30:08.357 --> 00:30:16.101]  The Washington Post reports of the 19 killed, three were children, with the UN calling the strike an inexcusable war crime.
[00:30:16.101 --> 00:30:19.863]  Doctors Without Borders states that while militants had recently entered the area,
[00:30:20.183 --> 00:30:22.945]  None were used in the hospital for offensive measures.
[00:30:22.945 --> 00:30:26.689]  Contrast that with the bombing leaving patients burning in their beds.
[00:30:26.689 --> 00:30:35.556]  Add this to the famous story of the wedding that became a funeral in Yemen where 12 people died after an attacking drone confused the party for another group.
[00:30:35.556 --> 00:30:45.264]  Other reports from January of this year show the deaths of two hostages including an American citizen in a US drone strike and the father who had his children shot at
[00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:48.905]  For trying to save a camera crew who had been mistaken for terrorists.
[00:30:48.905 --> 00:30:52.745]  Will this be another example of the military going unaccountable?
[00:30:52.745 --> 00:30:53.865]  Only time will tell.
[00:30:53.865 --> 00:30:58.946]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:30:58.946 --> 00:31:03.107]  Many of the products at InfoWarsLife.com are true game changers.
[00:31:03.107 --> 00:31:07.508]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[00:31:07.508 --> 00:31:14.789]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[00:31:14.969 --> 00:31:25.634]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:29.155]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:31:29.155 --> 00:31:30.296]  What do you have to lose?
[00:31:30.296 --> 00:31:32.997]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[00:31:33.117 --> 00:31:38.721]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:31:38.721 --> 00:31:42.023]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[00:31:42.023 --> 00:31:46.226]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[00:31:46.226 --> 00:31:48.528]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[00:31:48.528 --> 00:31:55.493]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[00:32:49.996 --> 00:32:51.376]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:32:51.376 --> 00:32:51.857]  We the people.
[00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:21.883]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:21.883 --> 00:33:24.704]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.704 --> 00:33:25.705]  Generals gathered.
[00:33:25.705 --> 00:33:28.146]  Generals gathered in their masses.
[00:33:28.146 --> 00:33:31.127]  Just like witches at black masses.
[00:33:31.127 --> 00:33:33.568]  Just like witches at black masses.
[00:33:33.568 --> 00:33:36.789]  But it is a big ritual.
[00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:40.771]  Evil minds that plot destruction.
[00:33:40.771 --> 00:33:42.612]  Sorcerers of death's construction.
[00:33:43.596 --> 00:33:47.659]  In the fields.
[00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:55.485]  As the loving, liberal, global war machine keeps turning.
[00:33:57.142 --> 00:34:05.365]  But here domestically, it's an organized, creeping, soft kill poison.
[00:34:05.365 --> 00:34:21.970]  Where the globalist spiders creep up in the night and inject their cultural poison, their spiritual poison, their chemical poison, their biological poison, their electromagnetic poison, their aerosol poison.
[00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:23.571]  And watch their work as it
[00:34:25.259 --> 00:34:26.800]  Takes hold.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.921]  And giggle to themselves.
[00:34:28.921 --> 00:34:32.903]  Because in the dark, they are king.
[00:34:32.903 --> 00:34:36.145]  Politicians hide themselves away.
[00:34:36.145 --> 00:34:39.207]  They only started the war.
[00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:43.529]  Treating us just like pawns in chess.
[00:34:43.529 --> 00:34:48.972]  Wait till their judgment day comes.
[00:34:48.972 --> 00:34:50.073]  Why should they go out and fight?
[00:34:54.236 --> 00:34:55.517]  They leave that to the poor.
[00:34:55.517 --> 00:34:59.980]  More to the robots.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.963]  You can just turn those off when you're done with them.
[00:35:03.963 --> 00:35:06.905]  Takes a little more time to turn off veterans, doesn't it?
[00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:08.206]  To decommission them?
[00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:11.029]  Put them on the don't treat list?
[00:35:11.029 --> 00:35:15.372]  Put them on the death list?
[00:35:15.372 --> 00:35:16.693]  Making war just for fun?
[00:35:25.524 --> 00:35:29.826]  Wait till their judgment day comes.
[00:35:29.826 --> 00:35:31.887]  Yeah.
[00:35:31.887 --> 00:35:34.908]  That bassist could write some poetry.
[00:35:34.908 --> 00:35:37.689]  All right, let me continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:37.689 --> 00:35:44.912]  You know, since I mentioned this, I'm just going to save all this news for the second hour and go to your phone calls.
[00:35:44.912 --> 00:35:50.414]  And then in the second hour, I'm going to get to this stack on the open borders invasion.
[00:35:51.894 --> 00:35:58.299]  This stack dealing with the globalization and federalization of police.
[00:35:58.299 --> 00:36:03.703]  The stack on the move to take our guns, that's now as we knew, full court, the biggest push ever.
[00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:08.267]  We're talking about open confiscation, total bans now, Australian style.
[00:36:08.267 --> 00:36:10.829]  The ultra-massive news on Russia.
[00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:12.710]  The GMO news.
[00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.973]  Weather weapon news.
[00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:16.373]  And more.
[00:36:18.524 --> 00:36:21.147]  We've got world leaders reacting to the trade agreement.
[00:36:21.147 --> 00:36:23.910]  It's not a trade agreement, it's a global government takeover.
[00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.452]  Russia deliberately targeting CIA-backed rebels in Syria.
[00:36:26.452 --> 00:36:31.818]  We're going to get to a lot more coming up.
[00:36:31.818 --> 00:36:39.726]  But let me just read these headlines because this is what could lead to a larger, very, very, very serious conflagration.
[00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.012]  NATO warns Russia over incursions into Turkish airspace.
[00:36:44.012 --> 00:36:53.218]  American officials, you mean globalist occupiers, who call themselves American officials, claim Russia bombing of U.S.-backed Syrian rebels intentional.
[00:36:53.218 --> 00:36:56.940]  Russia has a substantial number of troops inside Syria, says NATO Secretary General.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.162]  Substantial Russian military buildup in Syria taking place.
[00:37:00.162 --> 00:37:01.623]  Unindependent.
[00:37:01.623 --> 00:37:05.325]  Saudi clerics, along with the government, call for jihad against Russia and Syria.
[00:37:05.325 --> 00:37:07.867]  Oh, I thought they were against the al-Qaeda people they were paying.
[00:37:08.846 --> 00:37:14.871]  Fatawa characterizes Russian effort as orthodox Christian crusade.
[00:37:14.871 --> 00:37:16.492]  Marco Rubio wants U.S.
[00:37:16.492 --> 00:37:19.454]  to risk war with Russia over Syria.
[00:37:19.454 --> 00:37:23.337]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:37:23.337 --> 00:37:26.780]  That is just some of the news on the whole Russia front.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.363]  TPP will restrict internet, punish whistleblowers.
[00:37:30.363 --> 00:37:32.544]  We're going to get into that report.
[00:37:32.544 --> 00:37:34.906]  That is coming up.
[00:37:34.906 --> 00:37:37.268]  But just to finish up with the global government takeover.
[00:37:39.502 --> 00:37:44.944]  The feds, the globalists, the Pentagon, militarized police, give them a bunch of training.
[00:37:44.944 --> 00:37:46.645]  Some of it good, some of it bad.
[00:37:46.645 --> 00:37:51.527]  Federal funding, asset forfeiture, seizure, all the rest of it.
[00:37:51.527 --> 00:37:54.008]  They know full well cameras proliferate.
[00:37:54.008 --> 00:37:56.249]  Police acting badly gets out there.
[00:37:56.249 --> 00:38:00.151]  The police in many areas act arrogant, circle the wagons.
[00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:01.892]  The public has outrage.
[00:38:01.892 --> 00:38:08.735]  They use this bubbling revolution to then project it in the controlled media and the Soros-run White House
[00:38:10.151 --> 00:38:20.156]  To collectively project it onto all police, period, that are not federal and make it a class warfare, class envy, Robin Hood scenario.
[00:38:20.156 --> 00:38:25.219]  They then glorify the killing of random police in cold blood.
[00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:27.921]  That causes the police to further militarize.
[00:38:27.921 --> 00:38:36.045]  The feds are there then to give them seminars and training on how to behave and how to act so the feds won't come after them.
[00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:42.816]  So it's like breaking someone to make them an informant to make them an operative.
[00:38:42.816 --> 00:38:45.520]  And that whole process is happening right now.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.001]  It's been going on for decades.
[00:38:47.001 --> 00:38:54.289]  I mean, Bill Clinton and the Delta Force paying off local police and narcotics trafficking and just all the rest of it to corrupt them.
[00:38:55.649 --> 00:38:58.070]  It's come out so many times it makes my head spin.
[00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:05.434]  The drug war has been used for 30 years to corrupt the police, to pay them off, to get them under full globalist control.
[00:39:05.434 --> 00:39:12.658]  Not your average beat cop that's out revenue generating and responding to your house when there's a burglary or whatever, or helping move wrecked vehicles.
[00:39:13.902 --> 00:39:27.629]  But the detectives, some of those folks above them, the special task forces, the MJTFs, those are just fabulously corrupt, fabulously evil on average.
[00:39:27.629 --> 00:39:34.372]  They're testing grounds to find out who from what departments will play ball and play secret agent.
[00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:38.134]  And then out of those groups, they're then brought to the international level
[00:39:39.133 --> 00:40:04.433]  And basically sheep-dipped into Interpol, the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, Defense Intelligence, or InfoPoll 9, InfraGard, clergy response teams, all these shadow spy militia auxiliaries, but they're paid, into the giant private network.
[00:40:05.455 --> 00:40:17.999]  You know, Napoleon said men would kill themselves and throw themselves onto swords and run into cannons for little pieces of metal and ribbon.
[00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:22.800]  And so now to get those badges of honor, medals are only a couple hundred years old.
[00:40:24.568 --> 00:40:29.851]  Before that, your group might get a standard or a battle victory and then you were just associated with that group.
[00:40:29.851 --> 00:40:38.877]  But it was individual pieces of ribbon, you know, trophies, signets, logos, signets to you.
[00:40:38.877 --> 00:40:39.717]  And that's what it is now.
[00:40:39.717 --> 00:40:42.019]  I mean, these preachers, these police officers, these people.
[00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:50.101]  A lot of times they don't even want pay to get that little federal badge, to get that little federal ID, to be given entrance into it.
[00:40:50.101 --> 00:40:55.369]  And all they're doing is just getting a giant mass of people that don't even know what's going on to join them.
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:13.427]  I remember 15 years ago they were sending Austin police to Japan or to Berlin or to other sister cities to learn about international policing and to help them come here when they want to extradite someone or when we want to extradite someone.
[00:41:13.427 --> 00:41:16.588]  Well that's turning you into an international police officer.
[00:41:16.588 --> 00:41:25.472]  And you could argue there's times for that but then, oh, now you're going to be enforcing UN policy and the UN or Germany might want to
[00:41:26.332 --> 00:41:33.554]  Indict someone under international law, and then you're going to come and arrest that person for their speech.
[00:41:33.554 --> 00:41:35.575]  This now happens in the UK.
[00:41:35.575 --> 00:41:37.855]  This now happens in Canada.
[00:41:37.855 --> 00:41:39.996]  And now it's getting ready to start happening here.
[00:41:39.996 --> 00:41:50.079]  And they show up, foreign police, with a local liaison, and they take you and put you on a aircraft, and they fly you out of the country.
[00:41:55.134 --> 00:42:00.319]  I remember reading in the Washington Post after 9-11, a top general, it's in my film, Masters of Terror.
[00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:03.802]  I have a shot in the Washington Post.
[00:42:03.802 --> 00:42:08.766]  I say that because I've tried to Google it and can't find the article itself, even with the headline now, it's not on the Wayback Machine.
[00:42:08.766 --> 00:42:19.296]  And it talks about in the article, we've got a deal with foreign troops and the UN to come into America to battle right-wing extremists and others and help round them up during a collapse.
[00:42:22.526 --> 00:42:26.750]  And it said Mexican and Canadian troops are our main groups we're depending on.
[00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:31.995]  Then I saw that in a Canadian paper.
[00:42:31.995 --> 00:42:39.662]  And then I was sent by Bernadine Smith of the Second Amendment Foundation out in California an entire binder.
[00:42:39.662 --> 00:42:43.306]  If somebody can find it in our storage sets, they get a shiny silver dollar.
[00:42:43.306 --> 00:42:44.207]  I've been looking for it for years.
[00:42:44.207 --> 00:42:45.188]  I've shown it on air many times.
[00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:58.953]  I don't know if somebody walked off with it or what, but the point is all the old news articles back to the 60s promoting this and a copy of the New York Times from 1937 calling for global government in 10 regions over America.
[00:42:58.953 --> 00:43:00.773]  They're the exact regions.
[00:43:00.773 --> 00:43:09.355]  Just like you can show Nelson Rockefeller back in the 50s and stuff calling for national health care and it's exactly the way Obamacare is.
[00:43:10.472 --> 00:43:13.875]  Well yeah, the Republican, Rockefeller Republicans is what they're called.
[00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:19.000]  They're the ones that first called for it in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.741]  The Republicans wrote it.
[00:43:20.741 --> 00:43:23.104]  It's a giant screw job.
[00:43:23.104 --> 00:43:30.490]  And you tell Democrats that, they go, no they didn't, no they didn't, nanana boo boo, I get it free, uh uh uh uh uh.
[00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:34.194]  And then they don't get it free, and they just still don't care, they're that weak minded.
[00:43:37.355 --> 00:43:40.325]  So I'll hit your calls, but I want to just because I mentioned it.
[00:43:42.697 --> 00:43:51.041]  Go to Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announces the launch of the Strong Cities Network at the United Nations.
[00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:55.443]  It is clear, reading from her speech, that the challenge of... We ought to just pull this up on C-SPAN and play it.
[00:43:55.443 --> 00:44:10.109]  It is clear the challenge of building reliance against violent extremists that they ship into our countries, a challenge that spans vast oceans and borders while impacting our most tightly-knit cities and towns, requires a response that is both wide-ranging and highly focused.
[00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:23.661]  National governments have a crucial role to play in ensuring the safety and security of the nations they serve, and here in the United States, it's our highest priority, oh yes, to protect us.
[00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:25.462]  Now let's go to the rest of it.
[00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:29.786]  Communities have too often been left isolated and alone.
[00:44:29.786 --> 00:44:32.389]  But don't worry, the UN's here to help, folks.
[00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:36.973]  Now again, then they bait and switch and flip it on to gun owners, veterans, and Christians, which they admit.
[00:44:40.407 --> 00:44:49.753]  But through the Strong Cities Network, see they can't get Congress to fully bring in world government, though they have partially so, they're going right to cities with federal funds and the UN.
[00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:54.255]  But through the Strong Cities Network that we have unveiled today, how's Bloomberg going after your guns?
[00:44:54.255 --> 00:44:55.296]  Through the cities.
[00:44:55.296 --> 00:44:56.757]  Carbon taxes to the cities.
[00:44:56.757 --> 00:45:06.482]  But through the Strong Cities Network we have unveiled today, we are making the first systematic effort in history to bring together cities around the world to share experiences
[00:45:07.643 --> 00:45:12.807]  To pool resources, that means money, and to forge partnerships outside of state.
[00:45:12.807 --> 00:45:14.669]  Where's the legislatures?
[00:45:14.669 --> 00:45:20.134]  In order to build local cohesion and reliance on a global scale.
[00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:27.980]  Today we tell every city, every town, every community that has lost the flower of its youth to a sea of hatred, talking about shooting.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.761]  See, this is an anti-gun movement.
[00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:31.363]  You are not alone.
[00:45:31.363 --> 00:45:33.825]  We stand together and we stand with you.
[00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:43.359]  This is a truly groundbreaking endeavor by connecting municipal leaders, facilitating information sharing, that's with the U.N., this is a U.N.
[00:45:43.359 --> 00:45:52.507]  initiative, and providing training and other assistance, this violates so many state and federal laws, folks, to be giving this to multinational groups, but turning local cops into U.N.
[00:45:52.507 --> 00:45:54.109]  operatives.
[00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:56.531]  They don't even know it when they're putting your data in the squad car.
[00:45:58.118 --> 00:46:01.100]  In the health department, your health data, just everything.
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:06.943]  And they're only announcing this now because the TPP allows this and Congress will then certify it.
[00:46:06.943 --> 00:46:09.804]  See how this works?
[00:46:09.804 --> 00:46:16.388]  Just like Chicago launched Obamacare one year before it was passed, exactly as it was finally passed.
[00:46:16.388 --> 00:46:19.770]  And other major cities, see?
[00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:22.211]  They've already hit the ground running with world government, folks.
[00:46:23.407 --> 00:46:33.630]  By connecting municipal leaders, facilitating information sharing, and providing training and other assistance where appropriate, the Strong Cities Network will help to fashion a global response to global issue.
[00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:39.131]  They're going to globalize your local city, and not just the police, every function.
[00:46:39.131 --> 00:46:51.514]  Without losing sight of its inherently local roots, of course not, it'll all have lots of local local on the packaging, it will offer city leaders a way to learn from another about successful scams they've run, about successful initiatives,
[00:46:52.705 --> 00:46:53.046]  I don't know.
[00:47:02.779 --> 00:47:05.160]  That safeguard the individual rights of citizens.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.661]  That means take citizens' rights.
[00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:14.225]  But create social justice movements, overthrow the local government, bring in socialist movements with race war, anti-police activity.
[00:47:14.225 --> 00:47:22.969]  This is bring in immigrants, bring in minority groups, forge them into angry, chip-on-the-shoulder groups, and then be political weapons of the NGOs, battleground Texas, other groups.
[00:47:22.969 --> 00:47:28.452]  I mean, this is total, 100% classic sedition, as hardcore as it gets.
[00:47:28.452 --> 00:47:28.892]  Let me continue.
[00:47:30.123 --> 00:47:39.269]  And it will support the practical delivery of community resilience programs in cities that are taking a new look at the evolving issue.
[00:47:39.269 --> 00:47:52.958]  And of course the issue is the police being violent, the police being evil, the police being the source of all problems, so that local government can be overthrown by the UN federal initiative.
[00:47:52.958 --> 00:47:59.222]  That's what Al Sharpton said, remember a few months ago he said, we're going to use these shootings to totally federalize the police, close quote.
[00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:04.100]  Well, the feds were captured by globalists, so let's translate that.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:12.761]  To totally globalize, which they say here five times, globalize your local city.
[00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:14.382]  I mean, they used to try this in the 90s.
[00:48:14.382 --> 00:48:16.342]  They'd put up a UN flag in Lansing.
[00:48:16.342 --> 00:48:18.202]  They'd put up a UN flag in LA.
[00:48:18.202 --> 00:48:23.403]  People wouldn't believe us when we talk about it on air, even though it was in the local paper.
[00:48:23.403 --> 00:48:24.704]  But that's not happening.
[00:48:24.704 --> 00:48:25.604]  That's what this is.
[00:48:29.209 --> 00:48:34.470]  They're going to say, through your city, we will achieve an alliance of nations as a global community.
[00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:36.210]  I'm not even going to read the whole thing anymore.
[00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.951]  I mean, it just goes on.
[00:48:37.951 --> 00:48:46.832]  If you want to know, the administration is deeply committed to ensuring that the Strong Cities Network is as strong, vibrant, and resilient as the cities it unites.
[00:48:46.832 --> 00:48:48.733]  And then it just goes on to talk about it.
[00:48:48.733 --> 00:48:52.813]  Law enforcement, communities, all of it.
[00:48:52.813 --> 00:48:56.014]  This is basically ACORN taking over the police department.
[00:48:57.625 --> 00:49:12.049]  Taking over the city waterworks, taking over zoning, and just bringing in political correctness and just messing with everyone, stirring up infighting, and then grandstanding over the fighting groups in consortium with the mainstream media and the brainwashing.
[00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:13.209]  I mean, it's so unbelievable.
[00:49:13.209 --> 00:49:17.710]  I knew it was coming, but it's just over the top.
[00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:23.632]  And they're going to give jobs to all these trendies and all these nobodies and all these infighters to help stir stuff up.
[00:49:23.632 --> 00:49:26.093]  I'm going to skip this network break so I have more time for your calls.
[00:49:26.093 --> 00:49:26.793]  Just this one today.
[00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:42.159]  I mean, I know I get up here and I desperately cover this and I get physically nauseous now because I knew all this was coming, the old-timers were 100% right, but now it's all here.
[00:49:42.159 --> 00:49:46.763]  It's so criminal.
[00:49:46.763 --> 00:49:48.245]  I'm not kidding, I may throw up, actually.
[00:49:48.245 --> 00:49:49.506]  I'm mourning really bad right now.
[00:49:49.506 --> 00:49:50.347]  This is not drama.
[00:49:50.347 --> 00:49:53.930]  I can't handle this anymore.
[00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:55.892]  I never have panic attacks and I'm having one right now, folks.
[00:49:57.637 --> 00:50:00.558]  I live in an actual occupied country of criminals.
[00:50:00.558 --> 00:50:02.619]  I mean, they actually put cancer viruses in our vaccines.
[00:50:02.619 --> 00:50:03.459]  They're poisoning us.
[00:50:03.459 --> 00:50:05.420]  They're now going to force it on all of us.
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.942]  They are just totally setting us up for a fall.
[00:50:08.942 --> 00:50:09.962]  They hate us.
[00:50:09.962 --> 00:50:11.183]  They hate everyone.
[00:50:11.183 --> 00:50:12.903]  They are the pure scum.
[00:50:12.903 --> 00:50:15.744]  The corporations are going to jack up water prices, power prices.
[00:50:15.744 --> 00:50:17.065]  They're going to loot everyone.
[00:50:17.065 --> 00:50:18.085]  They're going to hurt everyone.
[00:50:18.085 --> 00:50:19.266]  They hate everybody.
[00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:20.486]  They are so evil.
[00:50:20.486 --> 00:50:21.607]  They are committed to evil.
[00:50:21.607 --> 00:50:24.348]  Hold on just a second.
[00:50:32.042 --> 00:50:43.301]  You know, I have a lot of empathy and it'd be like watching some guy with a big pot belly who weighs 300 pounds and a wife beater beat up his 100 pound wife and his little kids.
[00:50:43.301 --> 00:50:45.184]  It'd be like watching someone kick a toddler.
[00:50:47.005 --> 00:50:58.916]  When I watch the racial attacks and stuff, where a woman's attacked and her baby's attacked, and people are laughing about it, and people on, you know, World Hip Hop Star, or whatever the website is, are saying how great it is, I physically get ill.
[00:50:58.916 --> 00:51:06.262]  Because they've turned people into such scum, and the empathy's gone, and we're just so barbarous.
[00:51:06.262 --> 00:51:10.566]  And I physically am threatened by the tyranny.
[00:51:10.566 --> 00:51:13.449]  My body knows how much trouble and how much danger we're all in.
[00:51:18.206 --> 00:51:31.557]  And that nauseous feeling I have is the feeling I had when I had to, you know, growing up in rough areas of Dallas, fight somebody that weighed a hundred pounds more than me, and I just automatically start burning and just get nauseous and just, I mean, it's that feeling of about to fight for your life.
[00:51:34.738 --> 00:51:37.399]  Where it's just your arms and your back, sounds like it's burning.
[00:51:37.399 --> 00:51:43.461]  I mean, I can just... And people just don't understand how much attack you're under.
[00:51:43.461 --> 00:51:45.541]  You've got to kick in your instincts.
[00:51:45.541 --> 00:51:47.402]  You've got to come out of the trance.
[00:51:47.402 --> 00:51:50.763]  You've got to understand this is sick!
[00:51:50.763 --> 00:51:54.424]  This is criminal!
[00:51:54.424 --> 00:51:55.984]  And no wonder Congress won't do anything.
[00:51:55.984 --> 00:51:56.885]  They're being blackmailed.
[00:51:56.885 --> 00:51:57.605]  They're being threatened.
[00:51:57.605 --> 00:51:59.145]  They're being attacked.
[00:51:59.145 --> 00:52:00.106]  But we're fighting back.
[00:52:00.106 --> 00:52:01.246]  We're getting rid of the Speaker.
[00:52:01.246 --> 00:52:02.406]  We're trying to get somebody good in.
[00:52:02.406 --> 00:52:04.347]  We've got counties and cities attacking.
[00:52:05.558 --> 00:52:09.641]  And then all these bullies show up to try to kick this sheriff out, where the shooting happened.
[00:52:09.641 --> 00:52:12.703]  They can kick him out because he's pro-gun, they can get rid of everybody.
[00:52:12.703 --> 00:52:14.064]  They hate us.
[00:52:14.064 --> 00:52:17.707]  They're not going to leave us alone.
[00:52:17.707 --> 00:52:22.510]  They're going to shoot cops in the back until they give up and become federalized.
[00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:24.592]  And then they're going to stop shooting you in the back.
[00:52:24.592 --> 00:52:28.575]  And they're going to order you to come arrest the patriots, and then all hell's going to break loose.
[00:52:28.575 --> 00:52:32.558]  And police know that now, and you better tell everybody else that, or these people are going to win.
[00:52:33.837 --> 00:52:35.997]  Because it's going to start here at the grassroots.
[00:52:35.997 --> 00:52:42.319]  It's going to start with bullying, low government, and taking it over.
[00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:44.239]  People know that I've taken more days off now.
[00:52:44.239 --> 00:52:45.960]  I don't take off a lot.
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:49.160]  I usually do six days a week, but I take off maybe one day a week, so I'm still on five days a week.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:56.822]  I shoot a lot of other reports and stuff, and it's because I physically can't handle this anymore.
[00:52:58.769 --> 00:53:00.570]  I mean, I know how real this is.
[00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:02.332]  I know how right I am.
[00:53:02.332 --> 00:53:03.513]  This is not a joke.
[00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:04.373]  It's not a game.
[00:53:04.373 --> 00:53:05.194]  It's not fun.
[00:53:05.194 --> 00:53:08.096]  It is the takedown of this country.
[00:53:08.096 --> 00:53:09.137]  It is pure evil.
[00:53:09.137 --> 00:53:10.898]  I mean, are we really this bad?
[00:53:10.898 --> 00:53:17.163]  Are we really going to get conquered by absolute criminal trash that's going to start a civil war next phase in this country?
[00:53:17.163 --> 00:53:18.003]  I mean, really?
[00:53:18.003 --> 00:53:19.004]  Really?
[00:53:19.004 --> 00:53:24.608]  Are we really going to be dominated by the likes of these people who've all got chips on their shoulders?
[00:53:26.547 --> 00:53:33.294]  The globalists created a liberation theology with the so-called minorities and most people didn't buy into it.
[00:53:33.294 --> 00:53:40.181]  For once the demographics changed, to have a socialist globalist takeover, using that as the impetus at the local level.
[00:53:40.181 --> 00:53:46.407]  And what you see with the war on police and the rest of it, is just the beginning of the warm-up and the testing of that.
[00:53:48.598 --> 00:53:51.899]  Meanwhile, the globalists hate everybody, no matter what color you are.
[00:53:51.899 --> 00:53:54.520]  And it's all a sick, cynical divide-and-conquer.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.101]  And that's the issue I'm getting at.
[00:53:56.101 --> 00:54:02.344]  You want to talk about identity politics, how about the identity of these children, 55 million of which have been aborted?
[00:54:02.344 --> 00:54:07.206]  How about the identity of the troops, of every race, color, and creed, being put on don't-treat-death-list?
[00:54:07.206 --> 00:54:11.347]  You know when they get away with that now, for a year and a half, that we know of?
[00:54:11.347 --> 00:54:14.088]  They say, we can just go all the way.
[00:54:14.088 --> 00:54:15.249]  We have been trained
[00:54:17.418 --> 00:54:26.564]  By successive approximation, to basically put up with anything.
[00:54:26.564 --> 00:54:29.486]  And it's only going to get worse the more we lay down.
[00:54:29.486 --> 00:54:32.808]  And the biggest thing we've got to do is declare these people the enemy.
[00:54:32.808 --> 00:54:34.509]  Declare them to be criminals.
[00:54:34.509 --> 00:54:36.490]  Declare them to be part of a criminal takeover plot.
[00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.292]  That's why Obama's countering that.
[00:54:38.292 --> 00:54:39.492]  Not be afraid of them.
[00:54:39.492 --> 00:54:42.594]  And say, we understand the great fear is letting you win.
[00:54:42.594 --> 00:54:44.255]  We're all done.
[00:54:44.255 --> 00:54:44.716]  Everybody.
[00:54:46.243 --> 00:54:51.306]  99% of us are up a creek without a paddle if this thing comes in.
[00:54:51.306 --> 00:54:55.469]  And you've just got to come to grips with how bad it is and understand it's worse than I'm even saying.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:02.042]  It's creeping, it's evil, it's scientific, it's organized, but here's the best part.
[00:55:02.042 --> 00:55:03.763]  It's formulaic.
[00:55:03.763 --> 00:55:07.144]  Something this big is formulaic, is very rigid.
[00:55:07.144 --> 00:55:21.190]  We know the attack profile, the scripts they use for Agenda 21, for their brainwashing, for their county and city takeovers, how their operatives operate, how they act, what they do, how they dangle the grant money.
[00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.850]  We know them.
[00:55:23.677 --> 00:55:29.586]  They can be defeated if they're recognized as the enemy.
[00:55:29.586 --> 00:55:32.290]  If they're recognized as the usurpers.
[00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:34.453]  As they're recognized as the eugenicists.
[00:55:34.453 --> 00:55:39.441]  I'm going to go to break and start the second hour with Jimmy, T.W., Danny, Don, Jim and others.
[00:55:45.865 --> 00:55:53.309]  Please tell your friends and family about the broadcast because all I am is somebody covering what they're doing out in the open and warning people.
[00:55:53.309 --> 00:56:04.756]  So the key is getting other people to become aware of what's happening and if enough of us understand the program and just don't support it with our dollars, speak out against it and support alternative systems, this thing will fall.
[00:56:05.376 --> 00:56:08.018]  You see Obama up there trying to rally his troops.
[00:56:08.018 --> 00:56:09.179]  Get out in the streets!
[00:56:09.179 --> 00:56:10.419]  Take over your cities!
[00:56:10.419 --> 00:56:11.640]  Elect new sheriffs!
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.721]  Take the guns!
[00:56:12.721 --> 00:56:14.442]  Shoo the gun manufacturers!
[00:56:14.442 --> 00:56:15.903]  You know, forward!
[00:56:15.903 --> 00:56:20.666]  They're trying to mobilize their armies of idiots.
[00:56:20.666 --> 00:56:24.749]  We have to get mobilized and go out and counter them.
[00:56:24.749 --> 00:56:26.490]  They've been losing.
[00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:27.871]  We're gaining ground.
[00:56:27.871 --> 00:56:30.173]  But this is the Battle of the Bulls, folks.
[00:56:30.173 --> 00:56:34.236]  With Jeb Dietrich and the whole Nine Yards throwing everything they've got at us.
[00:56:40.285 --> 00:56:41.946]  But they're the bad guys.
[00:56:41.946 --> 00:56:46.267]  They're going to lose.
[00:56:46.267 --> 00:56:47.367]  They're not going to win.
[00:56:47.367 --> 00:56:59.851]  The truth is, they're winning personally in their own personal evil to hurt people and be nasty and be bad.
[00:56:59.851 --> 00:57:03.212]  Evil doesn't ever win in the end because it's not designed to.
[00:57:03.212 --> 00:57:04.413]  It's designed to eat itself.
[00:57:05.896 --> 00:57:08.378]  These people are miserable scum.
[00:57:08.378 --> 00:57:09.940]  They hate you because they know you're good.
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.722]  They hate you because you're honorable.
[00:57:11.722 --> 00:57:13.303]  They hate you because you're happy.
[00:57:13.303 --> 00:57:19.369]  They're projecting their disgust for themselves onto you and just realize it's time to stop caring what they think.
[00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:25.394]  Briefly, ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot of really high quality products that help fund this operation.
[00:57:26.454 --> 00:57:26.774]  I think so.
[00:57:46.159 --> 00:57:50.241]  And Survival Shield X2 is selling out, but we should get more in about a month.
[00:57:50.241 --> 00:57:59.887]  But that game-changing trunation iodine from the Deep Earth Crystal Source, the cleanest, purest we could get, the cleanest, purest that we know of that anybody else has got.
[00:57:59.887 --> 00:58:03.429]  In our quest to find bigger and better supplies of it, we discovered this.
[00:58:03.429 --> 00:58:05.690]  And it's just amazing what it's done for myself and my family.
[00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:10.173]  You can read the rave reviews at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-LIFE.
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:19.864]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9, and we could do so much more, and I could spend a lot less time trying to raise capital if folks just flood our coffers with money.
[00:58:19.864 --> 00:58:21.225]  Because we need to be strong.
[00:58:21.225 --> 00:58:23.886]  You know, they're strong with our tax money they take.
[00:58:23.886 --> 00:58:26.548]  You freely give and get high-quality products back.
[00:58:26.548 --> 00:58:28.289]  I'm all about symbiosis.
[00:58:28.289 --> 00:58:29.369]  I'm all about give and take.
[00:58:29.369 --> 00:58:30.650]  I'm all about win-win.
[00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:32.471]  I know you know that, so thank you for your support.
[00:58:32.471 --> 00:58:37.234]  I salute all of you that go to InfoWarsLife.com, or if you spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:58:37.234 --> 00:58:39.555]  We'll be back with a second hour of your calls and more.
[00:58:39.555 --> 00:58:40.736]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.028 --> 00:58:45.241]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:49.051 --> 00:58:50.311]  Another major health threat.
[00:58:50.311 --> 00:58:55.273]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:58:55.273 --> 00:58:57.954]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:58:57.954 --> 00:59:04.996]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:04.996 --> 00:59:07.977]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:10.958]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:10.958 --> 00:59:12.958]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:12.958 --> 00:59:15.799]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:15.879 --> 00:59:21.601]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:21.601 --> 00:59:25.122]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:25.122 --> 00:59:28.203]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:28.203 --> 00:59:35.525]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:59:35.525 --> 00:59:38.746]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:59:45.168 --> 00:59:45.669]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:59:45.669 --> 00:59:46.852]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:06.352]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:08.114]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.114 --> 01:00:09.875]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.875 --> 01:00:11.456]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.456 --> 01:00:13.018]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.018 --> 01:00:17.201]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.201 --> 01:00:22.726]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.726 --> 01:00:28.590]  The establishment media is telling you everything's fine as long as you do what they say.
[01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:32.814]  I'm telling you they're out to get you and are lying to you, and all the polls show that people know that.
[01:00:33.882 --> 01:00:35.783]  The public just doesn't know how bad it is.
[01:00:35.783 --> 01:00:41.404]  And I'm here to tell you, 20 years ago, I thought I might have been exaggerating to myself and I was so naive.
[01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:46.045]  It's probably 10 times worse than I knew 20 years ago.
[01:00:46.045 --> 01:00:52.127]  And I was pretty informed compared to the average person 20 years ago.
[01:00:52.127 --> 01:00:59.969]  I mean, now, I go back to this point that I'm going to your phone calls.
[01:01:01.303 --> 01:01:03.745]  I realize it's that the average person is not evil.
[01:01:03.745 --> 01:01:19.079]  You might be decadent, you might be lazy, you might be stupid, you might be whatever, you might be busy, but you don't have bad will for people, you don't want to do bad things, you don't dream up scams, you don't want to hurt people.
[01:01:19.079 --> 01:01:25.866]  But the folks running things, and history shows this, when we go through these bad cycles, tend to be absolutely bloodthirsty.
[01:01:28.396 --> 01:01:29.939]  And bloodthirsty means something.
[01:01:29.939 --> 01:01:31.703]  They thirst for blood.
[01:01:31.703 --> 01:01:35.571]  They thirst for the innocence.
[01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:38.276]  They thirst to dominate.
[01:01:38.276 --> 01:01:39.338]  They thirst to control.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.800]  And we just have to come to grips with that.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.002]  I just cannot believe it's not a bigger uproar that they're going to turn our local cities into U.N.
[01:01:52.002 --> 01:02:02.265]  Southern Poverty Law Center total federalization brainwashing centers to carry out social warfare through fake social justice garbage.
[01:02:02.265 --> 01:02:04.986]  I mean, they are making their move.
[01:02:04.986 --> 01:02:07.326]  Jimmy in North Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:02:07.326 --> 01:02:10.187]  Hello, Alex.
[01:02:10.187 --> 01:02:13.108]  I appreciate all your work you do for the American people.
[01:02:14.032 --> 01:02:21.496]  Uh, this is just exactly what I was getting ready to call you and talk to you about, was our fine Attorney General Loretta Lynch going to the U.N.
[01:02:21.496 --> 01:02:25.518]  and putting all these things in place.
[01:02:25.518 --> 01:02:34.802]  They say they're totally going to bypass Congress, and when they have their next meeting at the U.N., meeting in Paris, France, that's when they're going to implement all this.
[01:02:36.656 --> 01:02:40.018]  What do you think the American people can do to stop this?
[01:02:40.018 --> 01:02:41.558]  Sir, I'm not acting.
[01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:43.499]  I'm not being a drama queen.
[01:02:43.499 --> 01:02:45.920]  I almost threw up.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:53.884]  I mean, I'm mourning that bad right now, and I've never done this on air.
[01:02:53.884 --> 01:03:01.828]  One time when I went to a CPS meeting and watched the judge take the kid from the family for no reason and get off on it, I threw up afterwards.
[01:03:04.642 --> 01:03:06.504]  I mean, I may have to go throw up during the break.
[01:03:06.504 --> 01:03:07.885]  I don't even know what you do.
[01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:15.173]  It's so bold, but it's also covert, and they've already lined their ducks up, and it's just, it gets worse from here.
[01:03:15.173 --> 01:03:17.855]  It's so over the top.
[01:03:17.855 --> 01:03:23.761]  We warn people, we speak out, we get this information to local police departments so they know what's going on.
[01:03:25.342 --> 01:03:33.887]  Because the police, again, aren't perfect, but the reason they're being targeted is they tend to be more conservative or more libertarian and aren't going along with this.
[01:03:33.887 --> 01:03:39.551]  I mean, the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL have been trying forever to turn the police into anti-gun scum.
[01:03:39.551 --> 01:03:46.235]  They failed in most cities, so now they're just going to turn death squads loose on the cops and kill them until they submit to the feds.
[01:03:46.235 --> 01:03:48.616]  Is that not evil?
[01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:50.578]  Yes, it's just plum-sickening to me.
[01:03:51.638 --> 01:03:52.438]  It is, it's sickening.
[01:03:52.438 --> 01:03:56.781]  I used to hear old-timers say, I'm sick at my stomach, and I think they were just saying that.
[01:03:56.781 --> 01:03:57.681]  Now I get it.
[01:03:57.681 --> 01:04:03.284]  You get old, you really love your family, you got kids, this stuff makes you sick.
[01:04:03.284 --> 01:04:04.465]  I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:05.145]  Leave the country?
[01:04:05.145 --> 01:04:07.026]  There's nowhere to go with these bastards.
[01:04:07.026 --> 01:04:08.887]  Why are people putting up with it?
[01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.588]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:04:10.588 --> 01:04:12.990]  Yeah, they say it's going to be a global initiative.
[01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.950]  Oh yeah, worldwide.
[01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.471]  World government's being launched, brother.
[01:04:19.628 --> 01:04:21.829]  You were the only one I knew to call.
[01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:30.594]  I've been listening to your radio station, and I get all your programs on my email, and I thought, well, I need to call Alex.
[01:04:30.594 --> 01:04:34.056]  I mean, you're the only person I know that can get the word out there.
[01:04:34.056 --> 01:04:35.797]  Well, I mean, I knew these programs were going on.
[01:04:35.797 --> 01:04:40.020]  I knew they were bringing out world government in December, but
[01:04:41.241 --> 01:04:42.002]  I didn't know this.
[01:04:42.002 --> 01:04:45.584]  I didn't know Breitbart reported on this a week ago until they told me about it.
[01:04:45.584 --> 01:04:47.085]  And then you go to it, and there it is.
[01:04:47.085 --> 01:04:49.786]  I mean, that's because they're moving on every front, folks.
[01:04:49.786 --> 01:04:51.928]  This is a blitzkrieg attack.
[01:04:51.928 --> 01:04:53.188]  So good job, Jimmy, reminding me.
[01:04:53.188 --> 01:04:54.049]  We'll be back with more calls.
[01:04:58.959 --> 01:05:03.300]  The politically correct police are calling for the ban of ham sandwiches.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.501]  That's right, eating lunch is now considered offensive.
[01:05:06.501 --> 01:05:09.702]  The guidelines published by Coexist House, a U.S.
[01:05:09.702 --> 01:05:18.725]  and U.K.-based interfaith group, recommended an outright ban of pork products from office kitchens to avoid offending employees of Muslim and Jewish faiths.
[01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:29.028]  It would be good etiquette to avoid heating up foods that might be prohibited for people of other faiths, said a University of London professor who wrote the guidelines for Coexist House.
[01:05:29.028 --> 01:05:31.309]  And this isn't a one-off incident.
[01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:46.313]  Back in 2013, a Portland principal pushed to ban speaking about peanut butter and jelly because it's not a popular combination around the globe, saying that Somali or Hispanic students may feel left out of the conversation because they don't eat sandwiches.
[01:05:46.673 --> 01:05:48.654]  And a grocery store in a black St.
[01:05:48.654 --> 01:05:54.157]  Louis neighborhood fielded questions of racism for not having asparagus sitting in a tray of water.
[01:05:54.157 --> 01:05:58.760]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:03.663]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:06:03.903 --> 01:06:10.005]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:06:10.005 --> 01:06:14.806]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:06:14.806 --> 01:06:18.367]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:06:18.367 --> 01:06:20.348]  No needles, no injections.
[01:06:20.348 --> 01:06:25.469]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:29.711]  BrainForce is here.
[01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:31.932]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:31.932 --> 01:06:36.915]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:06:36.915 --> 01:06:40.196]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:43.678]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:43.678 --> 01:06:45.679]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:06:45.679 --> 01:06:49.781]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[01:06:49.781 --> 01:06:55.284]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:58.346 --> 01:07:02.649]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[01:07:02.649 --> 01:07:06.893]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[01:07:06.893 --> 01:07:14.178]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:07:14.338 --> 01:07:25.028]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[01:07:25.028 --> 01:07:28.551]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:07:28.551 --> 01:07:29.672]  What do you have to lose?
[01:07:29.672 --> 01:07:37.960]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.401]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[01:07:41.401 --> 01:07:45.603]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:47.904]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[01:07:47.904 --> 01:07:54.868]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:08:08.747 --> 01:08:18.903]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:08:20.991 --> 01:08:24.734]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:28.337]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.539]  It's a military mission in North St.
[01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:31.180]  Louis.
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.742]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:38.406]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:43.210]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:44.091]  Guns will be taken.
[01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:45.592]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:08:45.592 --> 01:08:46.593]  We will take all weapons.
[01:08:46.753 --> 01:08:49.134]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:08:49.134 --> 01:08:53.697]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:54.557]  Enough.
[01:08:54.557 --> 01:08:55.358]  Enough.
[01:08:55.358 --> 01:08:56.418]  Enough.
[01:08:56.418 --> 01:08:56.798]  Enough.
[01:08:56.798 --> 01:09:01.361]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:09:01.361 --> 01:09:05.303]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:09:05.723 --> 01:09:12.566]  MSKS Late News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:12.906]  Us.
[01:09:12.906 --> 01:09:20.909]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:09:20.909 --> 01:09:24.530]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:26.171]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:33.249]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:09:33.249 --> 01:09:38.215]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:42.901]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:55.865]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:09:55.865 --> 01:09:57.306]  You're in your apartment!
[01:09:57.306 --> 01:09:58.427]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:09:58.427 --> 01:09:59.628]  Go back inside right now!
[01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:00.669]  I am inside.
[01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:02.571]  I have two words for you.
[01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:04.393]  Predator gloves.
[01:10:04.393 --> 01:10:05.374]  You will never see it coming.
[01:10:09.443 --> 01:10:12.284]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[01:10:12.284 --> 01:10:21.546]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:10:21.546 --> 01:10:26.988]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[01:10:26.988 --> 01:10:32.069]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[01:10:32.069 --> 01:10:34.110]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:10:35.883 --> 01:10:37.564]  We are on the march.
[01:10:37.564 --> 01:10:40.426]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:10:40.426 --> 01:10:44.928]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:59.961 --> 01:11:05.504]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[01:11:05.504 --> 01:11:11.926]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:11:11.926 --> 01:11:14.988]  From the front lines of the Info War, thank you for joining us.
[01:11:14.988 --> 01:11:21.611]  I played that intro we've had for about two and a half years because the new launch after our guns is on.
[01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:26.373]  Ten people died last Thursday in a tragic shooting that I haven't even gotten into yet.
[01:11:26.373 --> 01:11:28.774]  I'm going to go back to your calls under the news at the bottom of the hour.
[01:11:29.834 --> 01:11:36.937]  He now had a website, or Facebook, reportedly showing photos of the pills he was taking.
[01:11:36.937 --> 01:11:42.780]  He said, I'm taking so many pills, so many psychotropics, lithium, other things, I don't even know which ones I'm taking.
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.841]  I just take like five at a time.
[01:11:44.841 --> 01:11:47.002]  Five of each, is a quote.
[01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:50.364]  Living with mommy on psychotropics, always the same story.
[01:11:50.364 --> 01:11:52.925]  Part black, part white, looks mainly white.
[01:11:52.925 --> 01:11:59.048]  But CNN still didn't like that, so they made his nose smaller, his lips smaller, and turned him white as a sheet.
[01:12:00.509 --> 01:12:06.916]  So they can say he was a white supremacist, and you know that fits the race war narrative they want to push.
[01:12:06.916 --> 01:12:17.647]  No, when a mentally ill white person goes and shoots people, or a mentally ill mixed person goes, or just a human, or a black person, it's their mind that matters, not what color, but they make it about that.
[01:12:18.786 --> 01:12:25.609]  Because they don't want you to know it was motivated against Christians for their faith, and that's been confirmed.
[01:12:25.609 --> 01:12:26.910]  That's all coming up.
[01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:34.173]  Meanwhile, 50 killed in a knife attack at Chinese... And it goes over the whole report.
[01:12:34.173 --> 01:12:42.077]  Nine suspects are being pursued after they launched a coordinated knife attack on 50 workers at a northwestern Chinese coal mine.
[01:12:42.077 --> 01:12:43.197]  Radio Free Asia.
[01:12:43.197 --> 01:12:44.878]  Yeah, they're always having big massacres with that.
[01:12:44.878 --> 01:12:45.919]  The incident occurred September 18th.
[01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:56.997]  In the, and it's just now getting reported because this stuff gets shut down, the attackers are alleged to be Unger separatists.
[01:12:56.997 --> 01:13:08.146]  After overtaking security guards, the attackers killed the workers while they were asleep in bunkhouses at the Shogun mining operation in Akusa.
[01:13:08.146 --> 01:13:10.247]  Another 50 workers were injured.
[01:13:10.247 --> 01:13:15.592]  The suspects were believed to be hiding in a nearby mountain ravine where a manhunt operation is underway.
[01:13:16.636 --> 01:13:19.138]  Most of the victims were hand Chinese.
[01:13:19.138 --> 01:13:21.861]  Well, the obvious answer is ban knives.
[01:13:21.861 --> 01:13:23.803]  They should get Bloomberg over there right now.
[01:13:23.803 --> 01:13:29.668]  And there it is from the official Chinese Daily News.
[01:13:29.668 --> 01:13:30.769]  And the London Guardian.
[01:13:30.769 --> 01:13:36.034]  At least 50 reported to have died in an attack in a coal mine in September.
[01:13:36.034 --> 01:13:40.338]  And it's just now breaking almost a month later.
[01:13:46.044 --> 01:13:47.124]  But you're not going to hear about that.
[01:13:47.124 --> 01:13:49.345]  That's not going to be some big story.
[01:13:49.345 --> 01:13:54.406]  World mourns, because the world mourns the French and the British.
[01:13:54.406 --> 01:13:59.968]  I got a call the other night at like 10.
[01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:02.309]  The producer called me up.
[01:14:02.309 --> 01:14:10.931]  Nico called up and said, hey, they want you to get up at three in the morning and go to a satellite feed to debate Piers Morgan in England about gun control.
[01:14:12.998 --> 01:14:15.420]  And of course, that show's asked me on before I knew it was taped.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.641]  I just said, nope!
[01:14:17.641 --> 01:14:18.642]  I'm happy to debate him.
[01:14:18.642 --> 01:14:34.174]  I'm only doing it live because they will take me and they will edit out what I have to say and I'm not going to get in a ring with that guy with my hands tied behind my back and my legs cut off so he can dance around with his little sword and stab me and act like he had some victory.
[01:14:34.174 --> 01:14:38.317]  I mean, I'm not going to play straw man with that cowardly piece of trash.
[01:14:40.177 --> 01:14:52.307]  Anytime Piers Morgan, who has armed bodyguards where he lives out in LA and doesn't want you to have guns, anytime that cowardly hypocrite wants to debate me live, I will destroy him.
[01:14:52.307 --> 01:15:09.541]  But I'm not going to go on some show with him where it's taped unless I have a video from the producers saying they won't edit it and then I'm going to sit there in the satellite studio and I'm going to jack into their feed, I'm going to have an agreement to do this, and I'm going to record the debate myself so I can show people what happened.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.662]  And the last time I said that, they go, nope, we're not doing it.
[01:15:12.662 --> 01:15:13.502]  I said, good!
[01:15:13.502 --> 01:15:16.085]  Well, don't you want to go on the big BBC morning show?
[01:15:16.085 --> 01:15:18.487]  And I go, don't you want to go jump off a cliff?
[01:15:18.487 --> 01:15:21.189]  No, I don't care about you!
[01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:33.239]  Lie to your oppressed population, sit there and tell them how horrible it is to own guns and be able to defend yourself while your crime rate for violent crime is three times that of the US.
[01:15:33.239 --> 01:15:38.203]  Oh yeah, crime is higher in Chicago or New York, but not in the average American city or town.
[01:15:39.005 --> 01:15:41.206]  You got three times the crime on average.
[01:15:41.206 --> 01:15:48.929]  So you sit there and believe your British pedophile network.
[01:15:48.929 --> 01:15:57.832]  You go ahead and believe the pedophiles that run that whole operation, been caught running that operation, you've caught covering up.
[01:15:57.832 --> 01:16:00.573]  I'll say this, the people that run it cover it up.
[01:16:00.573 --> 01:16:02.874]  So that means they're involved as far as I'm concerned.
[01:16:02.874 --> 01:16:04.535]  You cover up a crime, you're involved in it.
[01:16:06.067 --> 01:16:10.091]  You're a... I mean, of course the globalists hire a bunch of pedos to run things.
[01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:12.893]  They're the only trash that would get up there and do this type of dishonorable stuff.
[01:16:12.893 --> 01:16:16.537]  Let me get back to what I was saying.
[01:16:16.537 --> 01:16:19.740]  I have all these different British shows call up, wanting me on about guns.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.861]  And I go, is it live?
[01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:26.186]  Well, no, it's not live, but we'll... You know what?
[01:16:26.186 --> 01:16:31.171]  Tie a couple bowling balls to your legs and go swim out in the Atlantic Ocean for a couple days, then I'll talk to you.
[01:16:32.262 --> 01:16:34.103]  What type of bizarre statement is that?
[01:16:34.103 --> 01:16:37.484]  Well, it's asinine for me to come on where you can edit stuff however you want.
[01:16:37.484 --> 01:16:38.945]  I only go on shows live.
[01:16:38.945 --> 01:16:40.205]  Period.
[01:16:40.205 --> 01:16:41.586]  Get that through your head.
[01:16:41.586 --> 01:16:42.566]  I don't waste my time.
[01:16:42.566 --> 01:16:45.007]  I don't want to digress.
[01:16:45.007 --> 01:16:46.268]  I'm just so sick of these traitors.
[01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.669]  Oh, I'm so sick of them.
[01:16:48.669 --> 01:16:52.450]  Anyways, see how globalism works out for you over there in the UK.
[01:16:52.450 --> 01:16:55.791]  Keep taking all those National Health Service shots.
[01:16:55.791 --> 01:16:59.433]  Your own government says by 2030 half of you will be dying of cancer.
[01:17:01.038 --> 01:17:10.686]  By 2025, half of you will have cancer.
[01:17:10.686 --> 01:17:14.428]  I remember seeing that, I already knew that, it was on the cover of the London Independent at my hotel.
[01:17:14.428 --> 01:17:19.873]  So when I went down where there was like 4,000 people I was going to speak to, right by where they were having the Bilderberg Group meeting a few years ago.
[01:17:21.212 --> 01:17:27.855]  I carried that newspaper, and I would hold it up to the police, and I'd say, you and your wives and your children are all going to be killed.
[01:17:27.855 --> 01:17:29.435]  They're putting it in the vaccines.
[01:17:29.435 --> 01:17:30.596]  And do you know what the cops were doing?
[01:17:30.596 --> 01:17:32.957]  They were nodding to him.
[01:17:32.957 --> 01:17:39.039]  Yeah, we know.
[01:17:39.039 --> 01:17:39.340]  See?
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:40.280]  I've done my job, haven't I?
[01:17:42.298 --> 01:17:45.239]  Imagine I'm walking through a crowd, police lining both sides.
[01:17:45.239 --> 01:17:46.640]  I don't want to be a rock star.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.900]  I don't want to be famous.
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:50.762]  I want success to know I'm winning the fight against the globalists.
[01:17:50.762 --> 01:18:02.466]  It does nothing for my ego to march out on a beautiful green field above the hotel where the Bilderbergs are meeting and the Prime Minister's meeting and have 4,000 people there to hear me speak.
[01:18:02.466 --> 01:18:05.268]  That wasn't the enjoyment.
[01:18:05.268 --> 01:18:06.008]  The enjoyment
[01:18:07.657 --> 01:18:10.659]  Was seeing how the police and the locals were awake.
[01:18:10.659 --> 01:18:16.282]  Except we went in one pub later that day down the street to get hamburgers and, you know, eat.
[01:18:16.282 --> 01:18:22.245]  And the guy was a globalist minion and he goes, get out!
[01:18:22.245 --> 01:18:23.445]  I'm not going to serve you people in here.
[01:18:23.445 --> 01:18:25.967]  I don't like what you're doing down the street.
[01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:26.927]  And I said, sure, I'll leave.
[01:18:26.927 --> 01:18:28.448]  And he goes, I told you, get out of here!
[01:18:28.448 --> 01:18:31.830]  And I went, oh, you're a little wannabe establishment guy.
[01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:33.391]  You feel like you're part of the agenda.
[01:18:34.434 --> 01:18:35.674]  I bet you're a little leftist.
[01:18:35.674 --> 01:18:37.735]  You don't want the right winger in here.
[01:18:37.735 --> 01:18:41.216]  And I go, I'm more left than you'll ever be, you little fascist.
[01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.116]  He said, I told you to get out of here.
[01:18:42.116 --> 01:18:44.297]  And I said, hey, you're the one bowing up, punk.
[01:18:44.297 --> 01:18:46.237]  I'm going to walk out of here.
[01:18:46.237 --> 01:18:56.020]  But if you want to come up and attack me, you and you two guys, you think you're tough, I'm going to stomp you into the ground.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:56.480]  Oh, I see.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.880]  You're not so tough now.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.621]  You think I'm one of these people been henpecked into submission all day?
[01:19:00.621 --> 01:19:02.742]  I'm glad you're not going to get my money.
[01:19:02.742 --> 01:19:03.022]  Let's go.
[01:19:15.396 --> 01:19:16.300]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.668]  I'm skipping this break too.
[01:19:18.668 --> 01:19:19.912]  But John, no more this week.
[01:19:19.912 --> 01:19:20.876]  I'm not allowed to anymore.
[01:19:22.042 --> 01:19:23.003]  Let's go to T.W.
[01:19:23.003 --> 01:19:31.869]  in Texas, I'm sorry, and I'm not bragging in those stories, I'm saying this is the response we have to have to these henpeckers that want to intimidate us and make us submit to them.
[01:19:31.869 --> 01:19:49.781]  It's time to say, look, you're part of a lowdown criminal operation, I hate your filthy guts, and I'm gonna shun you, and I'm gonna speak out against you, and I'm gonna badmouth you, and I'm gonna spit on you, and I'm gonna pray against you, and I'm gonna work against you, you filth!
[01:19:49.781 --> 01:19:50.241]  T.W.
[01:19:50.241 --> 01:19:51.142]  in Texas, go ahead.
[01:19:52.236 --> 01:19:53.056]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[01:19:53.056 --> 01:19:55.737]  I think I've got some breaking news for you.
[01:19:55.737 --> 01:20:01.000]  This morning, on the effeminate Glenn Beck Show, obviously he is working with the White House.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.940]  He's got people on the ground in Syria.
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:10.303]  He's handing out night-vision goggles to the Syrian rebels slash jihadis slash Christian slayers.
[01:20:10.303 --> 01:20:11.804]  You're kidding!
[01:20:11.804 --> 01:20:12.524]  No, no.
[01:20:12.524 --> 01:20:15.946]  I'll tell you, it was at 9.38 Texas time.
[01:20:15.946 --> 01:20:18.307]  And I couldn't believe it.
[01:20:18.307 --> 01:20:21.188]  But you and I both know you can't get these things out of the country.
[01:20:21.944 --> 01:20:27.910]  That's a federal offense, bringing firearms, optics, or night vision goggles out of the country.
[01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:28.631]  You can't bring this out.
[01:20:28.631 --> 01:20:32.034]  You'll be arrested at the airport.
[01:20:32.034 --> 01:20:34.216]  Well, you certainly can't bring it into a war zone.
[01:20:34.216 --> 01:20:36.278]  I mean, I believe you.
[01:20:36.278 --> 01:20:37.719]  I don't want to get in a fight with Glenn Beck.
[01:20:37.719 --> 01:20:38.920]  I want to believe he's a good guy.
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.523]  I haven't been following him.
[01:20:41.523 --> 01:20:44.506]  Are you telling me he's backing the Syrian rebels?
[01:20:45.578 --> 01:20:52.664]  He has got people on the ground and made it part of his podcast this morning where he's handing out night vision goggles to the rebels.
[01:20:52.664 --> 01:21:00.150]  Well, I've heard him say he wants to bring Christians into the country, and I wouldn't be against helping the Christians out, but I'd like to stop the war to begin with.
[01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:01.711]  That's how you really help them.
[01:21:01.711 --> 01:21:04.413]  But are you... Who's he giving night vision to?
[01:21:04.413 --> 01:21:09.117]  He's got people on the ground that are passing out night vision to the rebels.
[01:21:10.148 --> 01:21:14.289]  Well, the Pentagon has admitted, and the Russians have said, there are no moderate rebels.
[01:21:14.289 --> 01:21:15.310]  Everybody knows that.
[01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:18.271]  There's just a pass between offense, so the U.S.
[01:21:18.271 --> 01:21:22.052]  and others can give the weapons to them, and then they give it to Al Qaeda.
[01:21:22.052 --> 01:21:27.654]  So now Glenn is supporting ISIS and the rebels over there, so they can kill some more Christians.
[01:21:27.654 --> 01:21:30.935]  And you can check it out for yourself, 9.38 this morning on the Glenn Beck Show.
[01:21:31.627 --> 01:21:33.148]  That's the time frame we're just talking about.
[01:21:33.148 --> 01:21:34.948]  Well, thank you for holding to tell us that, T.W.
[01:21:34.948 --> 01:21:35.769]  Anything else?
[01:21:35.769 --> 01:21:37.810]  I mean, you think I'm getting too hysterical?
[01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:41.451]  Because when I learned they're openly going to have at the U.N.
[01:21:41.451 --> 01:21:52.076]  ratified the federalized cities, and Congress is doing nothing, and the Vice President is at the meeting with the Attorney General announcing community policing through U.N.
[01:21:52.076 --> 01:21:58.959]  directives with change agents, community organizers, Saul Alinsky, to break down our cities.
[01:22:00.106 --> 01:22:01.807]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[01:22:01.807 --> 01:22:15.674]  To bring the UN in, and again, the police do bad stuff, they have problems, I'm against the police state, but to then have the answer be, bring in the United Nations into America, that's just over the top.
[01:22:15.674 --> 01:22:17.595]  You know what, it's all coming.
[01:22:17.595 --> 01:22:22.138]  It's time to draw near to the Lord, because we're on the doorstep right now.
[01:22:23.123 --> 01:22:24.063]  Yeah, we really are.
[01:22:24.063 --> 01:22:26.564]  And again, they'll just bring in the U.N., and suddenly the U.N.'
[01:22:26.544 --> 01:22:44.568]  's on TV announcing, and suddenly they're talking about extremists, and they put me up there, somebody else up there, and they talk about the Internet, and we've got to protect you, and they just... You've seen the Democrat supporters in Austin and in San Diego, and in L.A., where we've gone out, and you go to a Democrat area, nine out of ten say put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[01:22:45.365 --> 01:22:47.966]  Nine out of ten say take people's free speech.
[01:22:47.966 --> 01:22:50.467]  Nine out of ten say forcibly inoculate.
[01:22:50.467 --> 01:22:54.368]  Nine out of ten... I mean, these people are totalitarians.
[01:22:54.368 --> 01:23:01.611]  They are just as cult-like as a Soviet soldier or a Nazi soldier.
[01:23:01.611 --> 01:23:05.433]  I mean, they will do anything they're told.
[01:23:05.433 --> 01:23:08.074]  The difference is they're not tough like a Nazi or Soviet soldier.
[01:23:09.045 --> 01:23:19.331]  They are just these stupid, weak, cowardly, bizarre, arrogant, narcissistic weirdos.
[01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:37.101]  You watch all those countless videos, there's like 20 of them now that I've seen, and it's always different plan hood national directors or directors of their board or local regional directors or national health directors and they're just slurping wine and eating and laughing about dead babies and giggling and just getting off on it.
[01:23:38.683 --> 01:23:39.603]  And there are gods.
[01:23:39.603 --> 01:23:40.844]  I guess they should get off on it.
[01:23:40.844 --> 01:23:41.784]  They're all chicken neck.
[01:23:41.784 --> 01:23:42.364]  They're ugly.
[01:23:42.364 --> 01:23:42.984]  They're weak.
[01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:43.825]  They're demonic.
[01:23:43.825 --> 01:23:45.605]  They rule.
[01:23:45.605 --> 01:23:46.506]  Because we submit.
[01:23:46.506 --> 01:23:48.286]  Thank you, GW.
[01:23:48.286 --> 01:23:49.647]  Don in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:23:49.647 --> 01:23:50.087]  Go ahead.
[01:23:50.087 --> 01:23:52.368]  Hello, Alex?
[01:23:52.368 --> 01:23:52.748]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:52.748 --> 01:23:53.308]  Thanks for holding.
[01:23:53.308 --> 01:23:54.708]  Go ahead.
[01:23:54.708 --> 01:23:55.649]  Oh, sure.
[01:23:55.649 --> 01:24:00.750]  Yeah, I just had a little story I wanted to relay to you in the audience about things.
[01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:05.852]  I think a story that coincides with a lot of the larger issues you've been talking about for the last few years.
[01:24:07.358 --> 01:24:13.162]  I went to an art gallery to see a friend who had a show there.
[01:24:13.162 --> 01:24:18.746]  I'm hanging out and I start to chat up this cute girl at the gallery.
[01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:23.391]  And we start talking back and forth about some stuff.
[01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:26.213]  It eventually gets to, what do you do for a living?
[01:24:26.213 --> 01:24:29.154]  She tells me she's a social worker.
[01:24:29.154 --> 01:24:30.375]  I said, oh, that's interesting.
[01:24:30.375 --> 01:24:33.037]  What kind of social work are you doing?
[01:24:33.037 --> 01:24:39.341]  And she says, well, I'm helping some of the migrants, facilitating, getting legal help,
[01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:45.184]  The whole, you know, the whole nine yards of it.
[01:24:45.184 --> 01:24:47.625]  Oh yeah, that's all been announced.
[01:24:47.625 --> 01:24:50.066]  Free healthcare, free everything.
[01:24:50.066 --> 01:24:59.550]  And again, sure, I get helping people from horrible countries, but it's meant to draw him here to make them become political weapons, and we are going bankrupt by design.
[01:24:59.550 --> 01:25:02.151]  Cloward Piven, go ahead.
[01:25:02.151 --> 01:25:03.272]  The kicker.
[01:25:03.272 --> 01:25:10.235]  So I figured she was working for some kind of NGO or something like that, but I say, so who do you work for?
[01:25:10.954 --> 01:25:18.337]  And she gives me this cute, sort of sheepish look, and she says, well, I'm working for General Dynamics.
[01:25:18.337 --> 01:25:21.759]  And I had to stop myself from having my jaw fall down.
[01:25:21.759 --> 01:25:24.880]  And I was like, is that right?
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:37.926]  And what would, you know, it just put my mind in a spin about what could, what would a large industrial, military industrial company like that be doing facilitating the movement of legal aliens over our borders?
[01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:38.607]  I don't
[01:25:56.312 --> 01:26:04.656]  I think that that little anecdotal story speaks a lot to all of the issues you've been talking about.
[01:26:04.656 --> 01:26:05.636]  And it's just amazing.
[01:26:05.636 --> 01:26:06.536]  Why would that be?
[01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:09.918]  I guess they're located in Texas, but as far as all of the...
[01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:21.132]  You know, all of the money that, you know, these secret black budgets that go to all these security companies.
[01:26:21.132 --> 01:26:21.773]  Absolutely.
[01:26:21.773 --> 01:26:26.655]  People aren't really buying $800 hammers or $700 toilet seats.
[01:26:26.655 --> 01:26:30.716]  Whenever you see these different aircraft that, you know, cost a billion dollars a piece, that's not true.
[01:26:30.716 --> 01:26:33.777]  It's going to all sorts of secretive operations.
[01:26:33.777 --> 01:26:37.359]  And yes, I didn't know about that particular company, General Dynamics, but they've got
[01:26:38.595 --> 01:26:45.893]  The major Protestant churches, the Catholic Church, they've got thousands of corporations I know of.
[01:26:47.469 --> 01:26:51.631]  Basically, mopping up all the collapsed areas of the U.S.
[01:26:51.631 --> 01:26:59.154]  and then they're putting immigrant populations in, but not getting them to plant gardens or build factories, then that actually would be probably fine.
[01:26:59.154 --> 01:27:07.257]  They're just becoming welfare heads and being given driver's license and voter ID cards to secure the corporate takeover of America.
[01:27:07.257 --> 01:27:12.839]  Once the demographic goes to enough point to have a checkmate vote with the immigrant population, they're going to shut the borders.
[01:27:13.519 --> 01:27:16.762]  They're going to use the backlash against it to create a total police state.
[01:27:16.762 --> 01:27:21.005]  They're going to inject all the poor people with Gardasil and sterilize them.
[01:27:21.005 --> 01:27:23.427]  So, again, these people are victims as well.
[01:27:23.427 --> 01:27:24.608]  They're being used.
[01:27:24.608 --> 01:27:25.369]  We need to be clear.
[01:27:25.369 --> 01:27:27.951]  But, again, water is a wonderful thing.
[01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:32.955]  If somebody's got a fire hose of it, though, cramming it down your mouth, it'll blow your guts out, your hind end.
[01:27:32.955 --> 01:27:33.816]  Don't mean to be gross.
[01:27:33.816 --> 01:27:35.217]  So, I'm all for water.
[01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:37.379]  I love H2O, but I'm all for these immigrants.
[01:27:38.359 --> 01:27:40.359]  But they are like a fire hose crammed down our throat.
[01:27:40.359 --> 01:27:41.060]  It's going to kill us.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.020]  It's going to kill them too.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:47.541]  So, I'm telling you, you've got to be the warrior.
[01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:49.242]  I would go back.
[01:27:49.242 --> 01:27:50.362]  I would talk to her again.
[01:27:50.362 --> 01:27:52.922]  I would secretly record her.
[01:27:52.922 --> 01:27:55.683]  I would... I'd get to know her.
[01:27:55.683 --> 01:28:00.224]  I mean, I don't want to call this espionage against the globalists because terms mean things, but that's not what it is.
[01:28:00.224 --> 01:28:02.405]  We've got to start playing hardball.
[01:28:02.405 --> 01:28:07.786]  And I'm somebody who has got more than I can shoot.
[01:28:08.979 --> 01:28:17.686]  And believe me, I mean, if I had time to go out and do my self-investigative journalism, I mean, knowing what I know now, the problem is people know who I am.
[01:28:17.686 --> 01:28:22.329]  If people didn't know who I was, I could go out and blow major operations on them all day long.
[01:28:22.329 --> 01:28:27.713]  We think of spies like James Bond, who's just totally handsome and can do backflips and is this ninja.
[01:28:27.713 --> 01:28:34.879]  No, it's people that are motivated by truth, telling the truth, taking action, like the mom-and-pop organization that's blown up in Planned Parenthood.
[01:28:34.879 --> 01:28:38.262]  They had the initiative, they were empowered, they took action.
[01:28:39.133 --> 01:28:43.095]  And so, you could call it undercover story Chicago.
[01:28:43.095 --> 01:28:49.839]  And just go out and interview these leftists, change their names, and show how they all really work for defense contractors and big oil.
[01:28:49.839 --> 01:28:52.800]  Listen, go to an environmental movement thing.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.641]  Find out who actually runs them.
[01:28:54.641 --> 01:28:56.222]  Most of the time it's an oil company.
[01:28:57.955 --> 01:29:03.759]  I mean, it's just so crazy when you actually find out how fascist this situation is.
[01:29:03.759 --> 01:29:06.441]  But great job calling in with the report.
[01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:08.682]  But you're HUMET.
[01:29:08.682 --> 01:29:10.583]  I mean, you are the people on the ground.
[01:29:10.583 --> 01:29:11.844]  And I would just take photos.
[01:29:11.844 --> 01:29:13.905]  I would talk about it.
[01:29:13.905 --> 01:29:15.827]  I would get in to know these people.
[01:29:15.827 --> 01:29:19.049]  Then I would educate her about what she's really part of.
[01:29:19.049 --> 01:29:23.712]  And a lot of times you can turn these people towards the light and then really get the big scoop.
[01:29:24.642 --> 01:29:25.203]  God bless you.
[01:29:25.203 --> 01:29:26.444]  I appreciate your call, Don.
[01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:28.245]  Amazing story.
[01:29:28.245 --> 01:29:29.987]  Danny, you're up next.
[01:29:29.987 --> 01:29:32.349]  And then Julian, Bob, Bill, and others.
[01:29:32.349 --> 01:29:32.469]  800-259-9231.
[01:29:32.469 --> 01:29:32.729]  And then...
[01:29:37.509 --> 01:29:41.693]  World War 4 has begun, but it's a different type of war.
[01:29:41.693 --> 01:29:48.499]  It's the war against humanity, national sovereignty, local government, religious freedom, free market and private property.
[01:29:48.499 --> 01:29:52.282]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.282 --> 01:29:54.985]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.931 --> 01:30:02.855]  Airstrikes are not always the surgical maneuvers people envision.
[01:30:02.855 --> 01:30:08.260]  Innocent civilians have been killed in another botched raid, this time in Afghanistan.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:16.027]  The Washington Post reports of the 19 killed, three were children, with the UN calling the strike an inexcusable war crime.
[01:30:16.027 --> 01:30:22.613]  Doctors Without Borders states that while militants had recently entered the area, none were used in the hospital for offensive measures.
[01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:26.594]  Contrast that with the bombing leaving patients burning in their beds.
[01:30:26.594 --> 01:30:35.436]  Add this to the famous story of the wedding that became a funeral in Yemen, where 12 people died after an attacking drone confused the party for another group.
[01:30:35.436 --> 01:30:42.178]  Other reports from January of this year show the deaths of two hostages, including an American citizen in a U.S.
[01:30:42.178 --> 01:30:48.799]  drone strike, and the father who had his children shot at for trying to save a camera crew who had been mistaken for terrorists.
[01:30:48.799 --> 01:30:52.320]  Will this be another example of the military going unaccountable?
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.761]  Only time will tell.
[01:30:53.761 --> 01:30:58.824]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:58.824 --> 01:31:04.568]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[01:33:00.407 --> 01:33:10.636]  Big Brother.
[01:33:10.636 --> 01:33:12.517]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:12.517 --> 01:33:14.139]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:14.139 --> 01:33:15.700]  You want answers?
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.321]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:20.945]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:32.442 --> 01:33:34.963]  You know, some days I get up here and I joke around, I have a good time.
[01:33:34.963 --> 01:33:40.466]  Other days... People get upset when their football team loses.
[01:33:40.466 --> 01:33:48.930]  I get upset seeing just crazy, destructive levels of tyranny going on.
[01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:50.991]  The globalists already control America.
[01:33:50.991 --> 01:33:52.152]  They already control most of the world.
[01:33:53.867 --> 01:33:54.868]  They're in control.
[01:33:54.868 --> 01:33:56.889]  Why are they dismantling prosperity?
[01:33:56.889 --> 01:34:00.711]  Why are they doing all these bad things?
[01:34:00.711 --> 01:34:17.061]  I have a friend who's working today down at a city-only fair for city employees at the convention center, and they sent me photos and videos of hundreds of city employees, hundreds, lined up to get free flu shots.
[01:34:21.693 --> 01:34:26.095]  lined up to get their quote free flu shots.
[01:34:26.095 --> 01:34:27.776]  And they send me the photos and the videos.
[01:34:27.776 --> 01:34:28.616]  I have them here on my phone.
[01:34:28.616 --> 01:34:32.217]  I may show some of these on the nightly news tonight.
[01:34:32.217 --> 01:34:38.380]  And just a data load, like a hammer, hits me in the head.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:48.284]  I know in the Canadian government studies, two of them, British studies, Japanese studies, you can pull these up, just type in study shows flu shot doubles your chances of catching flu next year.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.564]  Or the way they say it, having a flu shot increases risk of catching flu.
[01:34:59.564 --> 01:35:01.985]  That'll bring up the studies.
[01:35:01.985 --> 01:35:10.331]  And I know they've never, in 60 years of flu vaccines, ever guessed the proper mutation for the main flu strain.
[01:35:10.331 --> 01:35:12.052]  It's totally worthless.
[01:35:12.052 --> 01:35:14.374]  Every year they admit, oh, it's not that effective.
[01:35:20.362 --> 01:35:25.247]  ABC News, new study confirms flu vaccine really does increase your risk of serious pandemic.
[01:35:25.247 --> 01:35:31.372]  I mean, I had Dr. Blaylock on 20 years ago I was having him on when he was still a brain surgeon.
[01:35:31.372 --> 01:35:36.537]  Top brain surgeon, invented a bunch of stuff, ran a university, best-selling books, Newsmax writer.
[01:35:38.854 --> 01:35:41.055]  And he said, diet soda makes you fat.
[01:35:41.055 --> 01:35:42.675]  I've written three papers on it.
[01:35:42.675 --> 01:35:43.915]  It's excitotoxicity.
[01:35:43.915 --> 01:35:46.976]  They put it in there, in the rat studies, with Searle.
[01:35:46.976 --> 01:35:49.437]  They knew it made the monkeys and the rats more hungry.
[01:35:49.437 --> 01:35:54.558]  They would consume more, and then it destroys their endocrine system, blah, blah, blah.
[01:35:54.558 --> 01:36:01.000]  Fifteen years after he said that on my show, it was in CBS News, ABC News, you name it.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.221]  Headline, diet sodas make you fat.
[01:36:05.221 --> 01:36:08.202]  And they're designed, if they have aspartame in them, to hurt you.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:15.704]  They couldn't get them approved in the 70s because it killed most of the rhesus monkeys they fed it to.
[01:36:15.704 --> 01:36:17.786]  I'm going to say that again.
[01:36:17.786 --> 01:36:24.372]  It killed them at the doses they were giving them.
[01:36:24.372 --> 01:36:26.534]  And it was put in their meals every day.
[01:36:26.534 --> 01:36:33.380]  I mean, it grew cancers like Miracle-Gro grows big fat tomatoes.
[01:36:35.919 --> 01:36:37.680]  How can diet sodas make you fat?
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:39.081]  Study explains it.
[01:36:39.081 --> 01:36:41.722]  And then they always spin it, like they call TPP a trade deal.
[01:36:41.722 --> 01:36:43.023]  No, it's a global government treaty.
[01:36:43.023 --> 01:36:45.804]  They always call it diet sodas to confuse you.
[01:36:45.804 --> 01:36:49.746]  And then it's aspartame that they're talking about.
[01:36:49.746 --> 01:36:51.347]  It makes you hungry.
[01:36:51.347 --> 01:36:54.368]  Your body thinks it's getting something sweet.
[01:36:54.368 --> 01:36:56.709]  It still has an insulin response.
[01:36:56.709 --> 01:37:00.952]  It totally screws you up.
[01:37:00.952 --> 01:37:01.492]  It's a drug.
[01:37:02.902 --> 01:37:06.243]  I can't get family I have to quit drinking.
[01:37:06.243 --> 01:37:08.663]  And I'm not on a high horse, folks.
[01:37:08.663 --> 01:37:15.204]  I do bad things to my body, too, but I know they're bad.
[01:37:15.204 --> 01:37:17.825]  But if I drink a diet soda, I get a headache for a day.
[01:37:17.825 --> 01:37:18.845]  Other people, though, are addicted.
[01:37:18.845 --> 01:37:20.325]  It's a toxin.
[01:37:20.325 --> 01:37:21.985]  And I'm gonna go to your calls and get into the news.
[01:37:21.985 --> 01:37:31.367]  It's just that... I get sent photos and videos of, I'm talking, you know, a hundred people lined up.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:50.067]  A big long line of people, hundreds total, going through to get their flu shot, knowing they had studies a decade ago that if you take three flu shots after the age of 50, it was the study, you double your chances of Alzheimer's.
[01:37:50.067 --> 01:37:53.628]  That was a mainline study and was national news.
[01:37:56.857 --> 01:38:01.381]  And then the flu shot today isn't even the flu shot.
[01:38:01.381 --> 01:38:06.705]  It's nanotech, recombinant, bizarre.
[01:38:06.705 --> 01:38:18.914]  The H1N1 vaccine they admitted was a tracker vaccine, a simulant virus they'd released a year before.
[01:38:18.914 --> 01:38:21.236]  Oh, by the way, speaking of vaccines, this is in the news.
[01:38:23.254 --> 01:38:34.504]  They have caught, you can look this up, the United Nations and others adding sterilants or fertility, anti-fertility treatments.
[01:38:34.504 --> 01:38:38.647]  They don't want to completely remove fertility from everybody or it becomes too obvious.
[01:38:38.647 --> 01:38:43.371]  These are a percentage of people.
[01:38:43.371 --> 01:38:46.834]  And in some cases it's designed to act in a few years, so you don't know why.
[01:38:46.834 --> 01:38:51.258]  And this is all in the official UN documents, but this is out of
[01:38:53.186 --> 01:39:02.151]  Science news today, DNA vaccine sterilizes mice could lead to one-shot birth control.
[01:39:02.151 --> 01:39:12.377]  In fact, let's actually pull up the publication itself if we can.
[01:39:12.377 --> 01:39:15.118]  Animal birth control could soon be just a shot away.
[01:39:15.118 --> 01:39:21.742]  A new injection makes male and female mice infertile by tricking their muscles into producing hormone-blocking antibodies.
[01:39:25.322 --> 01:39:35.423]  This is exactly what they got caught adding to the tetanus shot in Africa and India in the 90s, where it creates an autoimmune response during second trimester to cause a spontaneous abortion.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:44.845]  If the approach works in dogs and cats, researchers say it can be used to neuter and spay pets and to control reproduction in feral animal populations.
[01:39:44.845 --> 01:39:50.968]  A similar approach could one day spur the development of long-term birth control options for humans.
[01:39:50.968 --> 01:39:59.393]  This looks incredibly promising, said William Swanson, Director of Animal Research at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden in Ohio.
[01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:01.955]  And they're very excited about the approach.
[01:40:06.638 --> 01:40:11.040]  To get there, researchers have already created vaccines that trigger an immune response in animals.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:11.980]  Oh, an autoimmune?
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:13.721]  Oh, what's Gardasil do?
[01:40:13.721 --> 01:40:20.383]  You're not going to hear Metro La Raza tell the senoritas not to take it.
[01:40:20.383 --> 01:40:23.665]  Only the racist, fat, dumb gringo will tell you, because he hates you.
[01:40:23.665 --> 01:40:24.745]  He's racist.
[01:40:24.745 --> 01:40:27.186]  The response produces antibodies that block
[01:40:28.732 --> 01:40:29.953]  Yep, this is it.
[01:40:29.953 --> 01:40:30.954]  GNRH.
[01:40:30.954 --> 01:40:31.835]  That's the one they got.
[01:40:31.835 --> 01:40:32.976]  I didn't even read this article.
[01:40:32.976 --> 01:40:35.357]  When they gave it to me today, I just looked at it and I said, I don't know what that'll be.
[01:40:35.357 --> 01:40:36.618]  I'm not bragging, I should read it.
[01:40:36.618 --> 01:40:38.160]  But there you go, same deal.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.482]  Before I told you, I just thought, same deal.
[01:40:40.482 --> 01:40:44.845]  They're just announcing their bioweapon.
[01:40:44.845 --> 01:40:45.966]  I mean, I'm not being arrogant.
[01:40:45.966 --> 01:40:49.969]  I mean, I'm just saying, I've seen this so long, I know their next move before it even happens.
[01:40:49.969 --> 01:40:52.692]  But then I kind of get blind to it.
[01:40:52.692 --> 01:40:54.813]  Because I only read the first two paragraphs.
[01:40:54.813 --> 01:40:56.375]  You got hundreds of articles, I just scanned it.
[01:40:57.588 --> 01:41:01.391]  And I thought, oh, I wonder what this is, so we're kind of discovering it together, and oh, it's the same old one.
[01:41:01.391 --> 01:41:02.752]  They got caught adding to the tetanus shot.
[01:41:02.752 --> 01:41:13.059]  See, there you go.
[01:41:13.059 --> 01:41:22.506]  The response produces antibodies that block the releasing hormone GnRH required by mammals to turn on the pathways to spur the egg or sperm development.
[01:41:22.506 --> 01:41:24.508]  So this blocks it in the first trimester.
[01:41:24.508 --> 01:41:25.709]  The vaccine in the class
[01:41:27.136 --> 01:41:34.779]  Inducing deer contraception, gonocon, have been shown to effectively work at both male and female birth control in animals.
[01:41:34.779 --> 01:41:42.463]  But like many human immunizations, the vaccines rely on an immune response that eventually dwindles away, forcing the use of booster shots every few years.
[01:41:42.463 --> 01:41:49.286]  Biologist Bruce Hay of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and colleges took a different approach to blocking GnRH.
[01:41:50.359 --> 01:41:56.126]  Rather than rely on animals' immune system to create antibodies, he and his colleagues engineered a piece of DNA.
[01:41:56.126 --> 01:41:57.968]  Oh, genetic engineering!
[01:41:57.968 --> 01:41:59.630]  They call it a vaccine, but it's not.
[01:41:59.630 --> 01:42:00.872]  It's re-engineering your body.
[01:42:00.872 --> 01:42:08.781]  That, when packaged inside interactive virus shells, oh, that sounds like it won't have any side effects, are injected into mice.
[01:42:09.844 --> 01:42:14.467]  Turn the muscle cells into anti-GNRH antibody factories.
[01:42:14.467 --> 01:42:16.808]  That's turn your muscles into cancer.
[01:42:16.808 --> 01:42:19.550]  Because it just gives you cancer, basically.
[01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:20.950]  This is so evil.
[01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:23.992]  But take all your shots, you idiots.
[01:42:23.992 --> 01:42:27.574]  Because muscle cells are some of the longest lasting in the body.
[01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:33.698]  They continue to churn out the antibodies for 10 years or more.
[01:42:33.698 --> 01:42:35.959]  Doesn't matter if it can kill you from autoimmune disease.
[01:42:35.959 --> 01:42:37.080]  And that's what Gardasil is.
[01:42:38.547 --> 01:42:40.688]  Doesn't matter if it causes you to bleed out every orifice.
[01:42:40.688 --> 01:42:43.669]  You know, that's just a small percentage it works a little too well on.
[01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:46.249]  Oh, we just meant to kill your reproduction, not kill you.
[01:42:46.249 --> 01:42:46.929]  Sorry.
[01:42:46.929 --> 01:42:49.830]  Hope you enjoy that tracheotomy.
[01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.531]  We love you so much.
[01:42:51.531 --> 01:42:57.513]  We care about you and your family so much.
[01:42:57.513 --> 01:43:04.455]  I have to be cynical and evil about it or I'm gonna start crying.
[01:43:04.455 --> 01:43:05.315]  I'm sick of these people.
[01:43:05.859 --> 01:43:11.961]  Okay, I got a mid-air refuel here, and then we'll go to your phone calls, and then I'll get to the news next hour, I promise.
[01:43:11.961 --> 01:43:12.722]  If I can handle it.
[01:43:12.722 --> 01:43:13.982]  Have I already read all this news?
[01:43:13.982 --> 01:43:14.863]  I don't know if I can handle it.
[01:43:14.863 --> 01:43:19.765]  I don't know if I can look at it anymore.
[01:43:19.765 --> 01:43:21.765]  People are like, man, this guy's full of drama.
[01:43:21.765 --> 01:43:23.346]  I see the YouTube comments.
[01:43:23.346 --> 01:43:24.106]  You know what?
[01:43:24.106 --> 01:43:25.227]  I'm a human.
[01:43:25.227 --> 01:43:30.249]  I care about 10 million women plus a year in Latin America being injected with this stuff, okay?
[01:43:32.304 --> 01:43:34.285]  I care about it happening here in America.
[01:43:34.285 --> 01:43:35.305]  I'm pissed.
[01:43:35.305 --> 01:43:36.666]  I'm physically sick over it.
[01:43:36.666 --> 01:43:38.206]  I want to beat people's asses, okay?
[01:43:38.206 --> 01:43:41.267]  I'm just going to be completely honest with you.
[01:43:41.267 --> 01:43:49.851]  I'm thinking about them over at that city convention center, lining up all the idiot city employees right now, and I just want to start screaming, I want my listeners to get down there and stand out front.
[01:43:49.851 --> 01:43:51.451]  It's the one across the river.
[01:43:51.451 --> 01:43:52.652]  It's the one on the south side.
[01:43:52.652 --> 01:43:54.592]  There's two big convention centers, what are they called?
[01:43:54.592 --> 01:43:57.734]  We need to look it up.
[01:43:57.734 --> 01:43:58.254]  It's the city...
[01:43:59.744 --> 01:44:03.286]  It's the city's own little convention where they prey on their people.
[01:44:03.286 --> 01:44:04.426]  It's at the Long Center.
[01:44:04.426 --> 01:44:05.887]  It's the Long Center, yeah.
[01:44:05.887 --> 01:44:17.252]  It's, it's, oh, we have a free day for you where you can get discounts on, on yoga and exercise and, you know, and, and, and nutrition and get vaccines.
[01:44:17.252 --> 01:44:19.433]  And so there's all these vaccine booths there.
[01:44:19.433 --> 01:44:22.015]  And yeah, look at the video of all these old city employees.
[01:44:22.015 --> 01:44:26.297]  They're 50, look, they're 100, shuffling up to get their shot.
[01:44:27.365 --> 01:44:31.287]  I'll be sitting in a restaurant hearing old people talk about getting their shots and I'll look up and they're not even that old.
[01:44:31.287 --> 01:44:34.728]  They look completely blown out of their minds.
[01:44:34.728 --> 01:44:37.629]  I mean, look lady, if you want to get a city paid for lobotomy, go ahead.
[01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:47.813]  I mean, I'm not going quietly into the night.
[01:44:47.813 --> 01:44:51.234]  These are death camps they have set up for us.
[01:44:51.234 --> 01:44:53.995]  And I know what they are and I know what's going on and I'm tired of it!
[01:44:56.155 --> 01:45:00.799]  They have just built it up where they can get away with anything now.
[01:45:00.799 --> 01:45:05.404]  But they know there's a resistance, they know folks are speaking out, they know people are involved, and that's the good news.
[01:45:05.404 --> 01:45:12.250]  Okay, briefly, I told you for the last three weeks we had the best deal ever on the new M4 Select.
[01:45:12.250 --> 01:45:13.471]  It's horrible food.
[01:45:13.471 --> 01:45:14.813]  I believe the world is so insane.
[01:45:16.018 --> 01:45:17.699]  That you need high quality storable food.
[01:45:17.699 --> 01:45:19.881]  This is storable food that I chose for myself and my family.
[01:45:19.881 --> 01:45:21.902]  It's insurance you can eat.
[01:45:21.902 --> 01:45:27.786]  We have a full spectrum of MyPatriotSupply that creates these meals for InfoWars Select.

[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.081]  And with the type of attack we're under,
[01:47:12.541 --> 01:47:20.484]  I believe people are insane out there not to check out the reviews and find out the details at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:47:20.484 --> 01:47:21.504]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[01:47:21.504 --> 01:47:24.866]  I apologize to Danny for making him hold so long.
[01:47:24.866 --> 01:47:26.326]  We'll go to other folks here in a moment as well.
[01:47:26.326 --> 01:47:34.329]  Danny in FEMA Region 6, what former state are you under in occupation?
[01:47:34.329 --> 01:47:37.490]  Yes, I'm under the former state of Texas.
[01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:38.231]  All right, welcome.
[01:47:38.231 --> 01:47:38.571]  Go ahead.
[01:47:39.508 --> 01:47:42.492]  Yeah, I'm also a former Republican, as you know.
[01:47:42.492 --> 01:47:48.961]  Yeah, first of all, I just want to say, really well done on the brain force.
[01:47:48.961 --> 01:47:52.066]  And, yeah, total flam dunk.
[01:47:52.066 --> 01:47:56.492]  I actually think you guys should do a special with the brain force and the knockout.
[01:47:57.349 --> 01:48:00.691]  Because I've got both of them in my war chest.
[01:48:00.691 --> 01:48:04.434]  It's kind of a yin and yang quality there.
[01:48:04.434 --> 01:48:05.655]  How did knockout work for you?
[01:48:05.655 --> 01:48:06.736]  This was not a stage call.
[01:48:06.736 --> 01:48:10.279]  You called in on World War III, current events, but you can get to that in a moment.
[01:48:10.279 --> 01:48:14.001]  But how has knockout worked for you?
[01:48:14.001 --> 01:48:17.384]  It turns me into an infant, basically.
[01:48:17.384 --> 01:48:20.306]  And yeah, I mean, it basically just
[01:48:21.081 --> 01:48:26.626]  transports me to a place where I'm pretty much floating on a cloud, drifting off to sleep.
[01:48:26.626 --> 01:48:31.470]  Yeah, it's done that a few times for me when I take like two of them, but then sometimes I don't want to get up eight hours later.
[01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:37.875]  I tend to take one, and it's just got nine known ingredients to get you into deep sleep.
[01:48:37.875 --> 01:48:44.560]  Things like valerian, melatonin, L-tryptophan, a lot of other folks have said the same thing about it.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.043]  You know they're in there because it's a very powerful smell.
[01:48:48.043 --> 01:48:50.165]  I'm not saying the pill smells great, but
[01:48:50.774 --> 01:48:52.594]  It smells like some real stuff.
[01:48:52.594 --> 01:48:53.415]  Oh, it's real!
[01:48:53.415 --> 01:48:59.396]  We go out and get the most concentrated, most organic, most expensive we can, and then sell it for really low prices.
[01:48:59.396 --> 01:49:02.756]  Because even the most expensive of those ingredients is not that expensive.
[01:49:02.756 --> 01:49:07.317]  So that's why we can offer it for $15, is because it is so good.
[01:49:07.317 --> 01:49:11.198]  And then, what was your experience with the Brain Force?
[01:49:11.198 --> 01:49:15.959]  Oh man, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's just, it's great.
[01:49:15.959 --> 01:49:16.859]  I mean, it's like, uh,
[01:49:18.584 --> 01:49:34.632]  I've pretty much stopped drinking coffee and you know but actually the weird thing is that I'll get these I'll get these memories coming in that I haven't thought about for like like over a decade.
[01:49:34.632 --> 01:49:36.153]  I'm not going to make any claims about it.
[01:49:36.153 --> 01:49:40.575]  Folks should try it out and it's just I think it's 10 ingredients that are like the most known.
[01:49:40.575 --> 01:49:43.477]  A couple of ingredients are like building blocks of the brain.
[01:49:43.477 --> 01:49:47.239]  At least one of them is prescription in Europe and it does have the
[01:49:48.459 --> 01:49:56.602]  Yeah, well, I have a pretty basic question for you, which is, you know, I've heard you say, especially, you know, like, as this year has gotten weirder and heavier about how
[01:50:18.553 --> 01:50:23.714]  The globalists are, like, from 10 to 15 years behind in their plan.
[01:50:23.714 --> 01:50:39.557]  And then you had the guest on, on October the 1st, talking about Joel Stalzin, and he was saying, well, the new developments with Russia dropping the bombs in Syria, that has now put them more behind in their plan.
[01:50:39.557 --> 01:50:47.519]  And then lastly, I was just going to say, I was watching your great film, Marshall Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State, in which you said,
[01:50:48.388 --> 01:50:57.811]  That Flight 93, having crashed into that field, and not into, like, the White House or something, could have... Hold on, I'll come back to you.
[01:50:57.811 --> 01:50:59.092]  I wanna hear that.
[01:50:59.092 --> 01:51:03.053]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.053 --> 01:51:06.154]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.154 --> 01:51:07.695]  Does that sound right to you?

[01:54:03.431 --> 01:54:10.596]  Okay, I'm going to try to rattle through Danny, Bob, Bill, Alamo, Joe, Scott, and others.
[01:54:10.596 --> 01:54:24.706]  And then I've got, I'm going to mention a bunch of names, but I've got to get the big push for open borders worldwide, the escalation with Russia and NATO, Obama administration calling for UN takeover of local governments.
[01:54:24.706 --> 01:54:25.907]  I mean, this is just insane.
[01:54:25.907 --> 01:54:28.089]  We're going to get into so much more.
[01:54:29.335 --> 01:54:33.936]  As well, but we've got Hillary gearing up to go after Biden.
[01:54:33.936 --> 01:54:37.177]  There is a lot, and I'll continue with calls as well in the next hour.
[01:54:37.177 --> 01:54:39.117]  Danny, you asked a lot of questions there.
[01:54:39.117 --> 01:54:40.818]  Go ahead and recap those.
[01:54:40.818 --> 01:54:42.158]  And then what was the final one?
[01:54:42.158 --> 01:54:46.959]  You were bringing up Flight 93 and Shanksville.
[01:54:46.959 --> 01:54:54.241]  If I could just distill my question, it would be, what is the importance of the timeline in this whole endgame?
[01:54:54.241 --> 01:54:57.462]  And if it gets pushed back or if it's not achieved,
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:07.847]  Then how many contingency plans are there and what are the stakes, basically, of the timeline if they're behind now, you know, and all that stuff?
[01:55:07.847 --> 01:55:10.629]  Well, they know worldwide they've lost the people's trust.
[01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:14.531]  So now they're just announcing totalitarianism in Europe and the U.S.
[01:55:14.531 --> 01:55:15.692]  saying it's a good thing.
[01:55:15.692 --> 01:55:17.714]  Yes, we're going to arrest you for your speech.
[01:55:17.714 --> 01:55:19.555]  Yes, you don't have freedom now.
[01:55:19.555 --> 01:55:26.580]  So they've gone from saying we're here to defend your freedom to more and more they're trying to just hide in plain view that, okay, we're just going to do what we want now.
[01:55:27.895 --> 01:55:33.999]  But even local state governments, regional governments don't want to go along because they want prosperity.
[01:55:33.999 --> 01:55:41.264]  So there's a globalist movement towards austerity, world government, eugenics, and then another movement that just wants prosperity.
[01:55:41.264 --> 01:55:44.166]  Doesn't mean it's perfect, doesn't mean it's not corrupt.
[01:55:44.166 --> 01:55:49.230]  But there are folks that are self-interested and don't like business being destroyed.
[01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:52.152]  So there's a real fight going on in the elite right now, number one.
[01:55:53.607 --> 01:55:58.609]  Clearly they've been lining up, gearing up for something big this fall, this winter, into next year.
[01:55:58.609 --> 01:56:03.692]  You now see all craziness breaking loose.
[01:56:03.692 --> 01:56:07.514]  As we've been predicting, because you can see the movements.
[01:56:07.514 --> 01:56:10.315]  It's like seeing a bunch of ducks fly overhead, you know, in the fall.
[01:56:10.315 --> 01:56:13.376]  And you go, bet a cold front's coming in next week.
[01:56:13.376 --> 01:56:14.837]  Here comes the cold front.
[01:56:14.837 --> 01:56:17.218]  The ducks know when to fly.
[01:56:17.218 --> 01:56:18.579]  You can see all the action.
[01:56:18.579 --> 01:56:20.780]  You can see all the preparations.
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:22.401]  You can see the statements being made.
[01:56:23.577 --> 01:56:29.359]  And so they're trying to compress all this stuff, and it's getting reckless.
[01:56:29.359 --> 01:56:33.260]  They're getting exposed, which makes them only get more aggressive.
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:36.121]  So the stakes are everything.
[01:56:36.121 --> 01:56:48.605]  Everybody can feel it right now, because we're in danger of regional war expanding into multi-region war between a whole bunch of different countries, and that's called World War.
[01:56:48.605 --> 01:56:50.186]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:50.186 --> 01:56:51.386]  But if you expand on that,
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:54.841]  The globalists call this World War 4.
[01:56:54.841 --> 01:57:09.946]  When I said last hour, World War 4 has begun, that's a think tank idea from Rand Corporation, the Army War College and others, that it's cyber war, economic war, culture war, immigrant war, proxy war.
[01:57:09.946 --> 01:57:13.787]  But they said we were in the beginnings of World War 4, this is now it.
[01:57:15.302 --> 01:57:17.704]  We're now entering World War 4.
[01:57:17.704 --> 01:57:31.375]  And it's by multinational corporations against each other and against everybody else, all cheating, all stealing, all lying, in alliances that are always changing to see who can get control of the global government.
[01:57:31.375 --> 01:57:41.143]  But none of them want to shut down the global government because they've all invested in it, they've all built in it, and they all get power from the power they've given to it.
[01:57:41.143 --> 01:57:42.825]  They all give power to the beast government.
[01:57:43.735 --> 01:57:49.459]  And then they get monopolies, they get special treatment, they get insider deals, they get diplomatic immunity.
[01:57:49.459 --> 01:57:53.822]  By giving power to the beast.
[01:57:53.822 --> 01:57:59.586]  But still they try to cheat each other as they go up, jockeying to be the capstone.
[01:57:59.586 --> 01:58:01.387]  Well, they're not gonna be the capstone.
[01:58:01.387 --> 01:58:03.068]  The god of death is.
[01:58:03.068 --> 01:58:05.150]  The eugenics lord.
[01:58:05.150 --> 01:58:06.210]  The one that would be god.
[01:58:06.210 --> 01:58:08.472]  The one that wants to play god.
[01:58:08.472 --> 01:58:11.914]  A very small number of the elite as his top henchmen.
[01:58:11.914 --> 01:58:12.695]  His top generals.
[01:58:14.136 --> 01:58:16.197]  These people are building their destruction.
[01:58:16.197 --> 01:58:18.558]  And most of them admit that and just go, isn't it gorgeous?
[01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:19.458]  Isn't it wonderful?
[01:58:19.458 --> 01:58:20.459]  I give myself to it.
[01:58:20.459 --> 01:58:23.540]  I mean, folks, believe me.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:24.821]  Believe me, folks.
[01:58:24.821 --> 01:58:26.842]  At the highest levels, people know.
[01:58:26.842 --> 01:58:30.704]  And a lot of them are freaked out and hiding out and don't want to be part of it.
[01:58:30.704 --> 01:58:35.986]  Because when the world government finally gets in place, the real horror begins.
[01:58:35.986 --> 01:58:37.947]  We'll be back.

[02:00:04.915 --> 02:00:06.216]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.216 --> 02:00:07.978]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.978 --> 02:00:09.740]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:11.341]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.341 --> 02:00:12.883]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.883 --> 02:00:17.067]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.067 --> 02:00:21.131]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.332 --> 02:00:28.954]  I have never had a deer-in-the-headlights experience this crazy, because I'm not really a fan of like rock stars, movie stars, people like that.
[02:00:28.954 --> 02:00:44.620]  I like politics, and I'm sitting there during that 70-second break, and Matt Drudge rounds the corner over here, and it was just like total and complete deer-in-the-headlights, and I'm still double-taking here, and then he's hiding over there in the shadows right now.
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:45.300]  I'm not kidding.
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:49.782]  They're gonna say there's another conspiracy theory, and we got Anthony Guicciardi.
[02:00:49.782 --> 02:00:50.602]  Is Matt Drudge over there?
[02:00:52.162 --> 02:00:53.342]  He is over there.
[02:00:53.342 --> 02:00:56.163]  Come on, just for a second to give the national media a heart attack.
[02:00:56.163 --> 02:00:57.803]  Can you just walk over here behind the stage?
[02:00:57.803 --> 02:00:59.064]  They're not going to believe it.
[02:00:59.064 --> 02:01:01.124]  No, see, it's right around this way.
[02:01:01.124 --> 02:01:02.845]  I haven't had one photo in eight years.
[02:01:02.845 --> 02:01:04.205]  I know you haven't had one photo in eight years.
[02:01:04.205 --> 02:01:06.846]  All right, I'm going to turn the mic your way.
[02:01:06.846 --> 02:01:07.886]  They can do voiceprint.
[02:01:07.886 --> 02:01:08.866]  Is this Matt Grudge?
[02:01:08.866 --> 02:01:10.827]  Uh-oh.
[02:01:10.827 --> 02:01:11.127]  I know.
[02:01:11.127 --> 02:01:11.727]  Okay, it's made up.
[02:01:12.774 --> 02:01:13.895]  It's a stunt.
[02:01:13.895 --> 02:01:15.015]  April Fools came early.
[02:01:15.015 --> 02:01:15.175]  What?
[02:01:15.175 --> 02:01:15.896]  How many months early?
[02:01:15.896 --> 02:01:17.396]  Five months early?
[02:01:17.396 --> 02:01:19.838]  April Fools, folks, I fooled ya.
[02:01:19.838 --> 02:01:22.999]  Well, am I supposed to go to rebroadcast now that you're here?
[02:01:22.999 --> 02:01:25.180]  Because I'm in a... You get to hang out with my crew and I'm on the air?
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:29.122]  This is, like, diabolical.
[02:01:29.122 --> 02:01:30.763]  Oh my gosh.
[02:01:30.763 --> 02:01:32.544]  Anyways, no, seriously.
[02:01:32.544 --> 02:01:34.305]  Do you think folks are going to believe Matt Drudge was here?
[02:01:36.919 --> 02:01:38.500]  I don't even believe he's here.
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:02:00.789]  I didn't believe it only because it's like it was like such short notice it was like boom I remember years ago well anyways I'm not gonna get into it this is this is crazy all right well I'm not gonna be aggressive and turn the lights on over there and aim the document cam over there but Matt Drudge came in said hi to me thought it was a three-minute break and then went over there I'm definitely going to have to play a clip or something we have one of those special reports coming back from the next break
[02:02:02.742 --> 02:02:06.943]  Alright, this has now entered complete twilight zone.
[02:02:06.943 --> 02:02:09.544]  Hey, but we got a new article up on InfoWars.
[02:02:09.544 --> 02:02:14.245]  Obama arms ISIS militants, pushes gun control on very same day.
[02:02:14.245 --> 02:02:21.627]  Obama authorizes resupplying Syrian opposition on same day he demands gun control against American citizens.
[02:02:21.627 --> 02:02:24.168]  And of course I was covering this Breitbart article a lot that I missed.
[02:02:24.168 --> 02:02:25.648]  I miss stuff all the time.
[02:02:25.648 --> 02:02:29.309]  I mean, I knew they were doing this, but I didn't know they were actually openly doing it.
[02:02:30.189 --> 02:02:31.949]  Obama administration and U.N.
[02:02:31.949 --> 02:02:36.410]  announced global police force to fight extremism in U.S.
[02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:39.031]  And then we've got all these callers that want to talk to me.
[02:02:39.031 --> 02:02:44.792]  You know, Matt has hosted the Drudge Report show for so long, but also Rush Limbaugh.
[02:02:44.792 --> 02:02:50.033]  So I would imagine he could come over here and actually host the show for us, except he's not really here.
[02:02:50.033 --> 02:02:57.394]  What if we put a microphone into the darkness coming out of the break and folks can do a voice print analysis to see if it's Matt Drudge?
[02:03:00.165 --> 02:03:03.368]  He's not gonna do it?
[02:03:03.368 --> 02:03:05.590]  I'm telling you, this is so classically reclusive.
[02:03:05.590 --> 02:03:06.691]  I wish I could do that.
[02:03:06.691 --> 02:03:08.132]  He is back there right now.
[02:03:08.132 --> 02:03:10.174]  It's taken a lot of work to get to this point.
[02:03:10.174 --> 02:03:12.375]  I know it's taken a lot of work to get to this point.
[02:03:12.375 --> 02:03:13.216]  I admire you.
[02:03:13.216 --> 02:03:15.698]  Maybe I should become reclusive.
[02:03:15.698 --> 02:03:16.459]  Huh?
[02:03:16.459 --> 02:03:17.460]  He's a big guy.
[02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:19.021]  And in good shape, too.
[02:03:19.021 --> 02:03:20.242]  I was like, man, who is that big guy?
[02:03:20.242 --> 02:03:20.703]  Who is that?
[02:03:20.703 --> 02:03:21.904]  I recognize that guy.
[02:03:21.904 --> 02:03:22.544]  Who's that with him?
[02:03:22.544 --> 02:03:24.986]  I was like, oh my God.
[02:03:24.986 --> 02:03:26.668]  What did I look like, Buckley, when he walked in?
[02:03:29.544 --> 02:03:31.966]  I mean, I literally was like, who is that?
[02:03:31.966 --> 02:03:33.567]  You are something else, man!
[02:03:33.567 --> 02:03:35.468]  God, I tell you.
[02:03:35.468 --> 02:03:38.890]  He's got a lot of class, the way he pulls stuff off.
[02:03:38.890 --> 02:03:41.272]  I'm kind of the opposite, like a bull in a china shop.
[02:03:41.272 --> 02:03:43.613]  A loose cannon.
[02:03:43.613 --> 02:03:45.435]  Anyways, I was already super wound up today.
[02:03:45.435 --> 02:03:49.537]  I've already had too many DNA forces today, and this is now just pushing me over the edge.
[02:03:49.537 --> 02:03:53.360]  I need some Jack Daniels Buckley immediately.
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:54.261]  I've not been drinking.
[02:03:55.219 --> 02:04:05.267]  Since last Thursday, I've been being a good boy, and I've been being nice, but I tell you, I may have to, I don't have any, what do you call them?
[02:04:05.267 --> 02:04:06.448]  Tranquilizers.
[02:04:06.448 --> 02:04:09.610]  But I think I need a tranquilizer dart or something.
[02:04:09.610 --> 02:04:11.311]  All right, folks, we'll be right back.
[02:04:11.311 --> 02:04:14.174]  No, seriously, because I'm starstruck right now.
[02:04:14.174 --> 02:04:14.814]  This is crazy.
[02:04:14.814 --> 02:04:17.436]  And the way he did it is even worse.
[02:04:17.436 --> 02:04:19.438]  And then it's going to be even worse when they have, like,
[02:04:21.112 --> 02:04:25.855]  Some major establishment, White House-driven publication saying I made it all up.
[02:04:25.855 --> 02:04:28.696]  So we at least, well we can't get a photo for Twitter.
[02:04:28.696 --> 02:04:29.857]  What are we gonna do?
[02:04:29.857 --> 02:04:31.378]  The suspense is deafening.
[02:04:31.378 --> 02:04:45.746]  Drugsreport.com, you can read up there where this guy put stuff on his Facebook, the supposed shooter, about how he just had so many pills he was on, psychotropics, lithium, and other things, that he ended up just taking five at a time.
[02:04:45.746 --> 02:04:47.608]  So the question is, was he on meds?
[02:04:47.608 --> 02:04:49.309]  And the answer is, does a bear
[02:04:50.512 --> 02:04:53.634]  You know, do different things like jump rope in the woods.
[02:04:53.634 --> 02:04:58.918]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.918 --> 02:05:03.261]  The politically correct police are calling for the ban of ham sandwiches.
[02:05:03.261 --> 02:05:06.463]  That's right, eating lunch is now considered offensive.
[02:05:06.463 --> 02:05:09.665]  The guidelines published by Coexist House, a U.S.
[02:05:09.665 --> 02:05:18.691]  and U.K.-based interfaith group, recommended an outright ban of pork products from office kitchens to avoid offending employees of Muslim and Jewish faiths.
[02:05:19.071 --> 02:05:28.974]  It would be good etiquette to avoid heating up foods that might be prohibited for people of other faiths, said a University of London professor who wrote the guidelines for Coexist House.
[02:05:28.974 --> 02:05:31.255]  And this isn't a one-off incident.
[02:05:31.255 --> 02:05:46.259]  Back in 2013, a Portland principal pushed to ban speaking about peanut butter and jelly because it's not a popular combination around the globe, saying that Somali or Hispanic students may feel left out of the conversation because they don't eat sandwiches.
[02:05:46.619 --> 02:05:48.583]  And a grocery store in a black St.
[02:05:48.583 --> 02:05:54.095]  Louis neighborhood fielded questions of racism for not having asparagus sitting in a tray of water.
[02:05:54.095 --> 02:05:57.642]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:22.066]  How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
[02:08:22.066 --> 02:08:28.415]  The answer is out there, Neo.
[02:08:28.415 --> 02:08:31.559]  It's the question that drives us.
[02:08:31.559 --> 02:08:32.460]  What is the Matrix?
[02:08:36.226 --> 02:08:39.248]  That has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[02:08:39.248 --> 02:08:40.650]  What truth?
[02:08:40.650 --> 02:08:43.132]  Human beings are a disease.
[02:08:43.132 --> 02:08:45.694]  You are a cancer of this planet.
[02:08:45.694 --> 02:08:49.677]  And we... ...are the cure.
[02:08:49.677 --> 02:08:55.622]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[02:08:55.622 --> 02:09:03.428]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[02:09:03.428 --> 02:09:04.729]  The Matrix is a system, Neo.
[02:09:06.636 --> 02:09:08.738]  That system is our enemy.
[02:09:08.738 --> 02:09:11.160]  When you're inside, you look around, what do you see?
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:18.346]  Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, the very minds of the people we are trying to save.
[02:09:18.346 --> 02:09:23.290]  But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.
[02:09:23.290 --> 02:09:28.815]  You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
[02:09:28.815 --> 02:09:34.800]  And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.
[02:09:36.605 --> 02:09:38.750]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:39.631]  You shouldn't trust me.
[02:09:39.631 --> 02:09:40.673]  I will taint the news.
[02:09:40.673 --> 02:09:43.018]  Our propaganda was beginning to pay off.
[02:09:43.018 --> 02:09:45.723]  And our Lord and Savior, Barack Obama!
[02:09:48.417 --> 02:09:51.418]  Genetically modified sounds Frankenstein-ish.
[02:09:51.418 --> 02:09:54.819]  Drought resistance sounds really something you'd want.
[02:09:54.819 --> 02:09:59.481]  I am not a dictator, I'm the president.
[02:09:59.481 --> 02:10:05.302]  This is a full, dishonorable, scientific mafia warfare takedown.
[02:10:05.302 --> 02:10:07.203]  Public policy could itself
[02:10:07.923 --> 02:10:11.905]  Become the captain of a scientific technological elite.
[02:10:11.905 --> 02:10:14.225]  These people are coming for everybody!
[02:10:14.225 --> 02:10:16.206]  I'm not gonna wait around to be soft killed.
[02:10:16.206 --> 02:10:18.907]  I'm not gonna wait around and watch my family die around me.
[02:10:18.907 --> 02:10:20.648]  I'm gonna die fighting!
[02:10:20.648 --> 02:10:22.388]  Take the blue pill.
[02:10:22.388 --> 02:10:24.169]  The story ends.
[02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:27.610]  You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
[02:10:27.610 --> 02:10:29.171]  You take the red pill.
[02:10:29.171 --> 02:10:31.792]  You stay in Wonderland.
[02:10:31.792 --> 02:10:34.013]  And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[02:10:38.407 --> 02:10:40.587]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:40.587 --> 02:10:45.949]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[02:10:45.949 --> 02:10:48.209]  Stop being a moron!
[02:10:48.209 --> 02:10:50.149]  Stop being dishonorable!
[02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:56.911]  Within 15 years they say, CNN, that everyone will be merged with machines, or will be obsolete.
[02:10:56.911 --> 02:11:03.952]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[02:11:03.952 --> 02:11:06.273]  Welcome to the real world.
[02:11:08.929 --> 02:11:11.730]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live well into the third hour.
[02:11:11.730 --> 02:11:13.870]  I did not do this as a stunt, neither did Matt Drudge.
[02:11:13.870 --> 02:11:15.111]  He is here.
[02:11:15.111 --> 02:11:16.171]  We got a hot mic over there.
[02:11:16.171 --> 02:11:19.592]  He wants to stay literally in the shadows behind a curtain.
[02:11:19.592 --> 02:11:24.393]  But this is the king of being able to push a story out and make it the number one story in the world.
[02:11:24.393 --> 02:11:33.875]  They even admit that in the New York Times, that he has more readers on politics and news than Facebook, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, LA Times put together.
[02:11:33.875 --> 02:11:37.896]  He's got some of our stories where the shooter himself said he was on a bunch of drugs.
[02:11:38.516 --> 02:11:38.856]  I don't know.
[02:11:58.948 --> 02:12:09.512]  And really just focus on what Matt Drudge thinks is interesting, and the public tends to agree with him that what he focuses in on is really catching the zeitgeist or the pulse of the people.
[02:12:09.512 --> 02:12:15.534]  So he might have 50 links every day, where Facebook has 500 million, but he has more traffic.
[02:12:15.534 --> 02:12:20.436]  That is the true David versus Goliath story, and this is not scripted.
[02:12:20.436 --> 02:12:22.816]  I have no idea where I should go.
[02:12:22.816 --> 02:12:26.878]  Matt Drudge, I guess you're here for ACL, or why are you in Austin, Texas?
[02:12:27.964 --> 02:12:32.332]  Well, you were just talking about Facebook, and thanks again for having me here.
[02:12:32.332 --> 02:12:34.877]  I'm not on Facebook.
[02:12:34.877 --> 02:12:36.280]  I don't do the socials.
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.683]  I've got that little Twitter thing.
[02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:39.086]  Even that's kind of disgusting.
[02:12:40.134 --> 02:12:43.875]  You know, I've been doing the Internet as long as you've been doing this radio show, Alex.
[02:12:43.875 --> 02:12:47.696]  Literally every day, as you have literally every day, practically.
[02:12:47.696 --> 02:12:50.157]  I think you've taken a little more time off than I have, actually.
[02:12:50.157 --> 02:12:55.739]  Yes, I've kind of gone... And I can't say that about many people, because you are a peer without peer.
[02:12:55.739 --> 02:13:05.642]  And I'll tell you, I was there before Facebook, I was there before CNN.com, I was there before mostly all of them.
[02:13:05.642 --> 02:13:08.823]  I have a very clear perception what the Internet is.
[02:13:10.259 --> 02:13:11.219]  In my mind.
[02:13:11.219 --> 02:13:12.480]  I'm free.
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:16.561]  I'm not defined by what they say the Internet is.
[02:13:16.561 --> 02:13:23.522]  Meaning Goldman Sachs, meaning who they invest in for the latest startup, meaning the latest BuzzFeed or Salon or Gawker.
[02:13:23.522 --> 02:13:25.303]  Well, Gawker's more independent.
[02:13:25.303 --> 02:13:31.845]  But there's a lot of corporate makeover of the Internet that I have not adapted to.
[02:13:31.845 --> 02:13:32.805]  Simply put.
[02:13:34.171 --> 02:13:35.471]  I'm friends with some of them.
[02:13:35.471 --> 02:13:41.573]  When I go to New York, I make the 6th Avenue rounds, but I am not a part of that system.
[02:13:41.573 --> 02:13:42.553]  I'm a free thinker.
[02:13:42.553 --> 02:13:43.393]  I'm an American.
[02:13:43.393 --> 02:13:52.156]  I'm very concerned with what's happening, so I just give it my all.
[02:13:52.156 --> 02:13:57.217]  I've learned how to take care of myself and detach from outcomes, because otherwise
[02:13:58.823 --> 02:14:00.265]  You can't survive.
[02:14:00.265 --> 02:14:02.087]  And I don't know where you are on that topic.
[02:14:02.087 --> 02:14:09.836]  I just follow my instinct because they always tell us how to adapt to be successful, but really we're just adapting to their mindset to be their slaves.
[02:14:09.836 --> 02:14:10.236]  I don't.
[02:14:10.236 --> 02:14:11.217]  No, you don't.
[02:14:11.217 --> 02:14:16.383]  I have remained completely independent from all of them.
[02:14:16.383 --> 02:14:17.144]  All of them!
[02:14:17.865 --> 02:14:21.752]  I am not influenced by any of them.
[02:14:21.752 --> 02:14:23.795]  I need no traffic from Google.
[02:14:23.795 --> 02:14:30.546]  I don't care if I get one traffic referral from Google, or Bing, or Yahoo, or any of these others.
[02:14:30.546 --> 02:14:31.487]  It's always been that way.
[02:14:32.304 --> 02:14:41.993]  Now if you think of that setup, how rare that is, because everybody's so hungry for referrals, for likes, I don't need to be liked.
[02:14:41.993 --> 02:14:43.434]  I don't need to be liked at all.
[02:14:43.434 --> 02:14:47.778]  I don't care if there's a button right there at the top of Drudge saying like or dislike.
[02:14:47.778 --> 02:14:50.380]  Thumbs up, thumbs down, doesn't mean anything.
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:55.345]  Now, I hope that you come, doesn't mean you necessarily have to like what I have up there.
[02:14:56.107 --> 02:15:00.328]  Now, where I've had a lot of success is I'm getting people from both sides of the aisle.
[02:15:00.328 --> 02:15:06.709]  They've always said, oh, he's a right-wing gossip monger, mainly because of Lewinsky in those years, which, by the way, are back.
[02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:09.590]  Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?
[02:15:09.590 --> 02:15:10.530]  Excuse me.
[02:15:10.530 --> 02:15:12.031]  Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?
[02:15:12.031 --> 02:15:13.431]  That's a good question.
[02:15:13.431 --> 02:15:16.512]  Where's the cover-up on this?
[02:15:16.512 --> 02:15:20.513]  So many issues that are suppressed on a daily basis.
[02:15:20.513 --> 02:15:21.873]  So that's what I try to do every morning.
[02:15:23.246 --> 02:15:23.866]  Incredible.
[02:15:23.866 --> 02:15:29.648]  Well, it's amazing to have you here in Austin, Texas, and I tell you, you certainly know how to make an entrance.
[02:15:29.648 --> 02:15:36.969]  I'm in a 70-second break, and I turn around, and there's Matt Drudge, just boom!
[02:15:36.969 --> 02:15:40.110]  I tell you, I almost had a heart attack, a good one.
[02:15:40.110 --> 02:15:42.431]  My cousin said he's never seen me look like that.
[02:15:42.431 --> 02:15:45.152]  What was the word, Buckley, you used?
[02:15:45.152 --> 02:15:46.292]  And then I was flabbergasted.
[02:15:47.276 --> 02:15:48.457]  I was flabbergasted.
[02:16:03.550 --> 02:16:08.572]  Energy battles, and we've lost some too, but we would have lost so many of them if it wasn't for the focal point.
[02:16:08.572 --> 02:16:14.335]  And even the White House and the Democrats admit, because I know you're saying you're non-partisan, I mean, I would guess you're more of a libertarian.
[02:16:14.335 --> 02:16:15.856]  Correct me if I'm wrong, you're just a freedom guy.
[02:16:15.856 --> 02:16:17.677]  I can't be controlled.
[02:16:17.677 --> 02:16:20.298]  I cannot be controlled.
[02:16:20.298 --> 02:16:24.720]  There are no interests here but what I see as the world events.
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:25.901]  Period.
[02:16:25.901 --> 02:16:27.781]  That is the truth of the situation.
[02:16:27.781 --> 02:16:28.682]  Well, they hate the fact
[02:16:29.002 --> 02:16:30.823]  That they can't control the agenda.
[02:16:30.823 --> 02:16:39.345]  The Pentagon has briefings with the head of PSYOPS, as you know, saying we've got to stop drudge changing the subject and showing when we're lying.
[02:16:39.345 --> 02:16:41.225]  I mean, that's when you know that's them.
[02:16:41.225 --> 02:16:42.866]  That's crazy town when you get.
[02:16:42.866 --> 02:16:43.526]  What is it like?
[02:16:43.526 --> 02:16:48.367]  Is it surreal to think back to something you started back in the early 90s has now grown into this?
[02:16:48.367 --> 02:16:50.128]  Well, no, because it's been every day.
[02:16:50.128 --> 02:16:50.868]  So it's just like.
[02:16:51.716 --> 02:16:53.857]  It's happened so organically.
[02:16:53.857 --> 02:16:55.437]  It started with one reader.
[02:16:55.437 --> 02:16:58.418]  I don't know who that one reader was, but it started with one reader.
[02:16:58.418 --> 02:17:00.699]  I've never placed an ad anywhere.
[02:17:00.699 --> 02:17:01.979]  Ever.
[02:17:01.979 --> 02:17:06.621]  This has all been a true organic reader to reader to reader to reader.
[02:17:06.621 --> 02:17:12.123]  Yes, I dabbled in the corporate with the Fox News Show and the Clear Channel Radio Show for nine years.
[02:17:13.171 --> 02:17:19.637]  But even that, the website was on its own terms and remains so to this very minute.
[02:17:19.637 --> 02:17:24.741]  Well, you've only gotten bigger since you stopped... Well, I don't know, because this is another thing.
[02:17:24.741 --> 02:17:27.623]  The measurements that we have, this is another bogus thing.
[02:17:27.623 --> 02:17:29.785]  Yesterday they released on the APA Wire...
[02:17:30.786 --> 02:17:32.628]  Twitter followers.
[02:17:32.628 --> 02:17:36.251]  Hillary is the queen of the Twitters, with 4.9 million.
[02:17:36.251 --> 02:17:37.832]  They don't say how many are fake.
[02:17:37.832 --> 02:17:38.953]  They don't say how many are true.
[02:17:38.953 --> 02:17:40.815]  They admit the First Ladies is like 80% fake.
[02:17:40.815 --> 02:17:42.677]  Well, the AP did not do that, Alex.
[02:17:42.677 --> 02:17:46.920]  So this whole thing, this whole socials, these socials.
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:55.448]  You know, Beats 1 Music, which I'm obsessed with, which has been launched on Apple, which is probably one of the best things they've done since Steve Jobs died.
[02:17:55.448 --> 02:17:56.268]  One radio station.
[02:17:57.029 --> 02:17:57.850]  Interesting.
[02:17:57.850 --> 02:17:59.571]  They don't know how many listeners they have.
[02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:02.853]  I heard some streams they were down to 5,000 an hour.
[02:18:02.853 --> 02:18:06.115]  This whole social media stuff is bogus.
[02:18:06.115 --> 02:18:09.838]  Facebook, we have 2 billion users.
[02:18:09.838 --> 02:18:11.359]  This is garbage.
[02:18:11.359 --> 02:18:15.321]  This is designed to demoralize the individual.
[02:18:15.321 --> 02:18:17.302]  I'll never have 2 billion followers.
[02:18:18.163 --> 02:18:19.884]  The Internet is what you make of it.
[02:18:19.884 --> 02:18:21.464]  It's the same battle as it was in the beginning.
[02:18:21.464 --> 02:18:24.605]  I remember having this argument with Brit Hume once, live on C-SPAN.
[02:18:24.605 --> 02:18:28.606]  He goes, oh, the Internet's all UFOs and all this crap.
[02:18:28.606 --> 02:18:30.247]  And I said, no, the Internet is what you make of it.
[02:18:30.247 --> 02:18:32.568]  In the beginning, they were dismissing the Internet.
[02:18:32.568 --> 02:18:33.788]  They were poo-pooing it.
[02:18:33.788 --> 02:18:38.229]  And isn't that good for us that for so long they were in arrogant denial?
[02:18:38.229 --> 02:18:40.950]  And they seem like they still kind of are in arrogant denial.
[02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:41.570]  No.
[02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:43.171]  Now they make it over in their image.
[02:18:43.951 --> 02:18:47.272]  Now it's these endless, monotonous tweets.
[02:18:47.272 --> 02:18:48.632]  Meaningless!
[02:18:48.632 --> 02:18:50.633]  Meaningless!
[02:18:50.633 --> 02:18:53.934]  To me, it's just a lot of gnats.
[02:18:53.934 --> 02:18:55.635]  A lot of confusion.
[02:18:55.635 --> 02:19:00.316]  When the reality of the situation is, life on earth has not changed.
[02:19:00.316 --> 02:19:01.977]  We need facts.
[02:19:01.977 --> 02:19:03.137]  We need events.
[02:19:03.137 --> 02:19:05.137]  We need specifics on things.
[02:19:05.137 --> 02:19:07.058]  Not all this confusion.
[02:19:07.058 --> 02:19:09.539]  It's almost they've made the internet over in their image.
[02:19:10.259 --> 02:19:11.079]  These corporations.
[02:19:11.079 --> 02:19:12.300]  And I think they're failing.
[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:13.220]  Skip the break.
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:13.860]  Skip the break.
[02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:14.601]  Oh, sorry, Matt.
[02:19:14.601 --> 02:19:15.001]  Go ahead.
[02:19:15.001 --> 02:19:15.841]  I had to interrupt.
[02:19:15.841 --> 02:19:17.342]  You say you think they're failing?
[02:19:17.342 --> 02:19:18.642]  I think they're failing.
[02:19:18.642 --> 02:19:23.824]  To the point, this is a whole nother discussion on how sick are the American people right now.
[02:19:23.824 --> 02:19:29.847]  I've been saying they could put Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar in the Oval Office and she'd be elected.
[02:19:29.847 --> 02:19:31.267]  People are really sick.
[02:19:31.267 --> 02:19:35.469]  I think you know this deep in your soul and this is why you get demoralized here on this very set.
[02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:36.289]  I shouldn't.
[02:19:36.289 --> 02:19:37.690]  People are sick.
[02:19:38.710 --> 02:19:47.416]  How they've got here, you've been on a wonderful arc over almost decades now, explaining why people are and have become so sick.
[02:19:48.433 --> 02:19:53.895]  That being said, people are willing to be made over in the image of these corporations.
[02:19:53.895 --> 02:20:00.477]  The reason there's so much anger online also is a newspaper like the Washington Post will leave a comment section.
[02:20:00.477 --> 02:20:02.398]  They don't care what you're saying.
[02:20:02.398 --> 02:20:04.599]  They don't care what you're thinking.
[02:20:04.599 --> 02:20:12.901]  That's why you get this anger that, oh, I have to be, you know, I'm out here as a citizen and I'm operating in their playground.
[02:20:12.901 --> 02:20:14.562]  Make your own playground.
[02:20:14.562 --> 02:20:16.783]  The reason I'm here, Alex, is you've made your own.
[02:20:17.895 --> 02:20:19.015]  Playground.
[02:20:19.015 --> 02:20:21.336]  This is a figment of your imagination.
[02:20:21.336 --> 02:20:24.438]  And the Drudge Report is mine.
[02:20:24.438 --> 02:20:27.919]  It is a very simple thesis.
[02:20:27.919 --> 02:20:30.820]  You are what you dream you are and become.
[02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:36.203]  And I wish Americans would get out of the sickness and just become greater.
[02:20:36.823 --> 02:20:37.964]  Well, that's profound.
[02:20:37.964 --> 02:20:46.108]  I mean, because if we start creating our own maps, our own world, our own vision, then there's no way for these cultural tyrants to program us.
[02:20:46.108 --> 02:20:49.650]  And that's why they're pushing so hard to get more outrageous.
[02:20:49.650 --> 02:20:51.351]  I mean, is this the beginning of the end?
[02:20:51.351 --> 02:20:54.593]  And to operate in their playgrounds.
[02:20:54.593 --> 02:20:56.835]  So, you become famous on YouTube.
[02:20:57.745 --> 02:20:58.445]  That's ridiculous.
[02:20:58.445 --> 02:20:59.266]  I'm not saying you.
[02:20:59.266 --> 02:21:04.227]  I'm saying the 13-year-old that just died that they're saying is the first YouTube star that died.
[02:21:04.227 --> 02:21:07.468]  You're playing in Google's hell pit.
[02:21:07.468 --> 02:21:08.689]  No, I agree, but I'm invaded almost.
[02:21:08.689 --> 02:21:10.269]  Make your own place.
[02:21:10.269 --> 02:21:11.570]  Make your own.
[02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:16.492]  The Internet allows you to make your own dynamic, your own universe.
[02:21:16.492 --> 02:21:20.873]  Why are you gravitating towards somebody else's universe?
[02:21:20.873 --> 02:21:25.495]  And this is kind of, again, where drudge to me, when I look at it right now, is a correction
[02:21:26.628 --> 02:21:29.210]  I totally agree with what you're saying.
[02:21:45.521 --> 02:21:47.845]  And this is a travesty.
[02:21:47.845 --> 02:21:56.019]  It's almost like a weird conglomerate of groupthink that has developed in a dynamic era that should be vibrating.
[02:21:56.019 --> 02:21:57.962]  It should be vibrating, it should be controversial.
[02:21:58.973 --> 02:22:00.094]  But I guess it's fear.
[02:22:00.094 --> 02:22:08.603]  Not everybody is cut from the same genetic background as you or I, Alex, of being brave and being able to stand up.
[02:22:08.603 --> 02:22:10.164]  You're on the camera, I'm not.
[02:22:10.164 --> 02:22:12.006]  You're more brave than I am.
[02:22:12.006 --> 02:22:14.349]  So, this is the dynamic that I'm in.
[02:22:14.349 --> 02:22:16.091]  I would just like to wake people up.
[02:22:16.091 --> 02:22:19.254]  Stop operating in their playground.
[02:22:19.654 --> 02:22:20.315]  Stop it!
[02:22:20.315 --> 02:22:20.955]  Well, let me say this.
[02:22:20.955 --> 02:22:22.636]  I totally agree with you.
[02:22:22.636 --> 02:22:23.457]  I've tried.
[02:22:23.457 --> 02:22:27.300]  I couldn't pay for the bandwidth to put all of our videos out on our own platforms.
[02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:37.548]  Now we're doing that at PrisonPlanet.tv and the Nightly News and putting ourselves up on television to reach people because it's kind of like jacking into the Matrix going into their playground.
[02:22:37.548 --> 02:22:41.811]  I try to then claw them over here to see what we're trying to do, what you're trying to do.
[02:22:41.811 --> 02:22:42.792]  But I totally agree with you.
[02:22:43.092 --> 02:22:56.701]  The answer is for all of us to create our own systems, our own ideas, because vibrant, independent ideas will trump this corporate plastic borg, this brainwashing they're trying to push.
[02:22:56.701 --> 02:23:00.363]  I mean, banning father and mother, banning the word husband and wife.
[02:23:00.363 --> 02:23:06.888]  I mean, that's so cultic that if I'd have been told ten years ago they were going to ban words like that, I wouldn't have believed it.
[02:23:06.888 --> 02:23:08.229]  They do it with straight faces.
[02:23:08.809 --> 02:23:18.060]  I mean, has the left, and of course the controlled right as well, but have they gone collectively insane on a control freak bent, or is there a strategy?
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:21.765]  I would also advise people to not waste their time on this.
[02:23:21.765 --> 02:23:25.209]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:23:26.915 --> 02:23:28.156]  Matt, it's over for you.
[02:23:28.156 --> 02:23:30.637]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:23:30.637 --> 02:23:31.878]  You're out of there.
[02:23:31.878 --> 02:23:35.200]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:43.265]  To have a Supreme Court justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[02:23:43.265 --> 02:23:45.447]  Time is not forever.
[02:23:45.447 --> 02:23:48.569]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[02:23:49.389 --> 02:23:50.609]  Uh, rise and fall.
[02:23:50.609 --> 02:23:51.690]  There's not that many.
[02:23:51.690 --> 02:23:53.690]  It's a small amount.
[02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:59.371]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[02:23:59.371 --> 02:23:59.811]  No.
[02:23:59.811 --> 02:24:00.771]  No, you can't.
[02:24:00.771 --> 02:24:02.832]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[02:24:02.832 --> 02:24:08.033]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[02:24:08.033 --> 02:24:10.374]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[02:24:10.374 --> 02:24:13.094]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[02:24:13.094 --> 02:24:13.954]  This is insane.
[02:24:13.954 --> 02:24:17.155]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[02:24:17.515 --> 02:24:19.996]  Now, remember just recently... Getting it lined up with it!
[02:24:19.996 --> 02:24:22.477]  So, they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[02:24:22.477 --> 02:24:24.497]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[02:24:24.497 --> 02:24:26.358]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[02:24:26.358 --> 02:24:37.102]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[02:24:37.682 --> 02:24:39.383]  Then that will end for me.
[02:24:39.383 --> 02:24:39.803]  Fine.
[02:24:39.803 --> 02:24:41.104]  I've had a hell of a run.
[02:24:41.104 --> 02:24:43.845]  It's 20 years next year, or 20 years about now.
[02:24:43.845 --> 02:24:44.626]  Hell of a run!
[02:24:44.626 --> 02:24:47.407]  I couldn't have gone any further.
[02:24:47.407 --> 02:24:52.450]  I feel completely I have gone as far out of the galaxy as I can on this.
[02:24:52.450 --> 02:24:58.113]  I still want to stay out here, but I've gone pretty damn far for what one individual can do in this culture.
[02:24:58.113 --> 02:24:59.714]  But I'm talking about the future.
[02:24:59.714 --> 02:25:05.057]  So I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos.
[02:25:05.757 --> 02:25:11.120]  Of these Facebooks, and these tweets, and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:12.701]  This is ghetto!
[02:25:12.701 --> 02:25:13.501]  This is ghetto!
[02:25:13.501 --> 02:25:15.102]  This is corporate!
[02:25:15.102 --> 02:25:17.463]  They're taking your energy!
[02:25:17.463 --> 02:25:20.145]  They're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return!
[02:25:20.145 --> 02:25:20.525]  Nothing!
[02:25:20.525 --> 02:25:21.986]  They're dumbing the language down!
[02:25:21.986 --> 02:25:24.747]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language directly out of 1984!
[02:25:24.747 --> 02:25:25.027]  It's Ingsoc!
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:36.763]  Right, ultimately it's boring and the kids are always off to something new, except for the something new is owned by the same freaking company or financed by the same banking system.
[02:25:36.763 --> 02:25:47.646]  So I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you Alex, you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[02:25:48.906 --> 02:25:50.427]  In a big way.
[02:25:50.427 --> 02:25:53.088]  If your calling is media, fine.
[02:25:53.088 --> 02:25:55.469]  If your calling is sports, whatever it is.
[02:25:55.469 --> 02:25:57.750]  But you've got to be the greatest you can be.
[02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:59.131]  Now.
[02:25:59.131 --> 02:25:59.851]  Now.
[02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:02.252]  Before this country is so completely fractured.
[02:26:02.252 --> 02:26:06.794]  And we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar.
[02:26:06.794 --> 02:26:08.375]  Because that's what we're getting.
[02:26:08.375 --> 02:26:10.116]  She's old and she's sick.
[02:26:10.116 --> 02:26:11.696]  She's not a contender.
[02:26:11.696 --> 02:26:15.918]  They're making her a contender with these propped up Saturday Night Live things.
[02:26:15.918 --> 02:26:16.979]  It's like a head on a stick.
[02:26:17.739 --> 02:26:21.882]  And then on the Today Show with the Gun 3, a head on a stick.
[02:26:21.882 --> 02:26:30.970]  She is not a viable, vibrant leader for this country of 300, including the illegals, 380 million Americans.
[02:26:30.970 --> 02:26:34.593]  So the media is trying to put us to sleep.
[02:26:34.593 --> 02:26:35.794]  You're not letting them, Alex.
[02:26:35.794 --> 02:26:36.955]  Let me ask you this question, Matt.
[02:26:38.432 --> 02:26:43.314]  Is the establishment, which we know is diverse, but there's different conglomerates, is it panicking?
[02:26:43.314 --> 02:26:46.895]  Is it trying to push everything through right now because it knows people are waking up?
[02:26:46.895 --> 02:26:50.776]  Or is it just completely arrogant and thinks it's invincible?
[02:26:50.776 --> 02:26:55.978]  It's trying to consolidate control, yes, and there is a sense of panic about it.
[02:26:55.978 --> 02:27:00.039]  You look at a Telemundo or a Univision, they're kind of panicked.
[02:27:00.039 --> 02:27:04.481]  You look at some of these interviews that are happening this election cycle where Trump comes along
[02:27:04.861 --> 02:27:10.646]  Says a few things, just a few things, and soars to the top of the list.
[02:27:10.646 --> 02:27:12.027]  That's profound.
[02:27:12.027 --> 02:27:19.413]  Imagine if we actually had a good selection of candidates who were saying a lot, and I know Cruz and Rand and all the rest.
[02:27:19.413 --> 02:27:23.496]  However, you've got to be dynamic in this atmosphere, and it's a media country.
[02:27:23.496 --> 02:27:25.237]  You've got to be dynamic in media.
[02:27:25.237 --> 02:27:27.279]  That's the only thing that's going to work.
[02:27:27.279 --> 02:27:30.842]  So I am left with thinking there's not a lot of time
[02:27:31.502 --> 02:27:45.954]  To be your greatest self, especially online, because I don't, if it continues to get consolidated to this degree, and then we're moving into the robots, which you're so profound on, and it's going to get really ugly, really fast.
[02:27:45.954 --> 02:27:50.058]  There's already automated news sites, Google News, hello anybody.
[02:27:50.058 --> 02:27:54.181]  They actually, the idiots reading that crap, think there is actually a human there.
[02:27:54.181 --> 02:27:55.883]  There is no human there.
[02:27:56.283 --> 02:28:00.887]  You are being programmed to being automated, even up to your news.
[02:28:00.887 --> 02:28:02.008]  And Apple News?
[02:28:02.008 --> 02:28:03.429]  I don't know what that's about.
[02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:05.071]  That was also creepy.
[02:28:05.071 --> 02:28:09.054]  A same corporate glaze over everything.
[02:28:09.054 --> 02:28:10.415]  I don't see the world that way.
[02:28:10.415 --> 02:28:16.520]  I live in a world that's free, colorful, vibrant, takes chances, bold, stands up to power.
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:17.882]  And that's where I've made my success.
[02:28:19.172 --> 02:28:33.944]  Well, very eloquently said, I mean really, if we don't affect the battle space, if we don't get involved in free speech now, that's all you the listeners, all the Drudge fans, fans of freedom, no matter what color you are, no matter what political bent, we're going to lose everything.
[02:28:33.944 --> 02:28:41.811]  We know what totalitarian looks like, we know what oppression looks like, we know what the dumb culture of totalitarianism smells like.
[02:28:41.811 --> 02:28:42.472]  This is it.
[02:28:43.152 --> 02:28:46.895]  It's happening now, and the future of the world is being decided.
[02:28:46.895 --> 02:28:49.556]  So get out there, make your own sites, take action.
[02:28:49.556 --> 02:28:51.738]  Because Matt, you say you'll just go away if they do this.
[02:28:51.738 --> 02:28:53.139]  We all know we're going to fight it.
[02:28:53.139 --> 02:28:54.680]  We know they can't enforce it.
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:57.662]  Because if they can say that you can't even put a link up to a news site,
[02:28:58.442 --> 02:29:01.443]  Then that ends free speech and basic communication.
[02:29:01.443 --> 02:29:08.784]  I mean, I know they got the Democrats out openly saying, we need to bring in the Fairness Doctrine to the Internet because of Matt Drudge, because you quote, affect elections.
[02:29:08.784 --> 02:29:13.045]  Well, you're an American citizen that pays taxes and you're allowed to be pro-gun.
[02:29:13.045 --> 02:29:17.906]  Well, but if they get enough sick people to elect it, the demographics will take care of themselves.
[02:29:17.906 --> 02:29:27.068]  We had a story this morning that they're finally releasing an artist in Cuba who painted Raul and Fidel as a pig, jailed without trial.
[02:29:27.768 --> 02:29:28.809]  For 18 months.
[02:29:28.809 --> 02:29:31.811]  Look at Germany, where they're arresting people that criticize open borders.
[02:29:31.811 --> 02:29:34.132]  Look, you've been... So it's already happening.
[02:29:34.132 --> 02:29:41.937]  I'm just warning this country that, yes, don't get into this false sense that you are an individual when you're on Facebook.
[02:29:41.937 --> 02:29:44.358]  No, you're not.
[02:29:44.358 --> 02:29:46.360]  You're a pawn in their scheme.
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:46.680]  Stay there.
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:48.501]  We gotta come right back for a few more minutes and say bye.
[02:29:48.501 --> 02:29:49.622]  This is incredible.
[02:29:49.622 --> 02:29:52.143]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.143 --> 02:29:54.825]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.934 --> 02:30:02.838]  Airstrikes are not always the surgical maneuvers people envision.
[02:30:02.838 --> 02:30:08.243]  Innocent civilians have been killed in another botched raid, this time in Afghanistan.
[02:30:08.243 --> 02:30:16.010]  The Washington Post reports of the 19 killed, three were children, with the UN calling the strike an inexcusable war crime.
[02:30:16.010 --> 02:30:19.774]  Doctors Without Borders states that while militants had recently entered the area,
[02:30:20.074 --> 02:30:22.837]  None were used in the hospital for offensive measures.
[02:30:22.837 --> 02:30:26.582]  Contrast that with the bombing leaving patients burning in their beds.
[02:30:26.582 --> 02:30:35.453]  Add this to the famous story of the wedding that became a funeral in Yemen, where 12 people died after an attacking drone confused the party for another group.
[02:30:35.453 --> 02:30:39.558]  Other reports from January of this year show the deaths of two hostages.
[02:30:39.838 --> 02:30:43.180]  Including an American citizen in a US drone strike.
[02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:48.783]  And the father who had his children shot at for trying to save a camera crew who had been mistaken for terrorists.
[02:30:48.783 --> 02:30:52.645]  Will this be another example of the military going unaccountable?
[02:30:52.645 --> 02:30:53.746]  Only time will tell.
[02:30:53.746 --> 02:30:57.328]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[02:31:32.014 --> 02:31:36.997]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:31:36.997 --> 02:31:40.279]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:40.279 --> 02:31:43.761]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:43.761 --> 02:31:45.522]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:45.742 --> 02:31:46.662]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:31:46.662 --> 02:31:47.843]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:31:47.843 --> 02:31:49.864]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[02:31:58.368 --> 02:32:04.131]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[02:32:04.131 --> 02:32:09.954]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds
[02:32:09.974 --> 02:32:10.394]  I'm good.
[02:32:32.389 --> 02:32:35.951]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[02:32:35.951 --> 02:32:40.072]  LiverShield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[02:32:40.072 --> 02:32:44.414]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[02:32:44.414 --> 02:32:48.536]  LiverShield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[02:33:09.199 --> 02:33:11.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:11.840 --> 02:33:15.741]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.741 --> 02:33:24.803]  Well, I tell ya, a lot of energy entered the building.
[02:33:24.803 --> 02:33:31.365]  There's already a lot of energy in this building.
[02:33:34.023 --> 02:33:36.066]  A lot of smiles with Matt Drudge here.
[02:33:36.066 --> 02:33:39.630]  A Don, I guess, went to the door.
[02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:42.173]  And we said don't let strangers in, but it was no stranger.
[02:33:42.173 --> 02:33:45.376]  Matt Drudge here in studio with us.
[02:33:45.376 --> 02:33:46.638]  And characteristically, very...
[02:33:48.479 --> 02:33:51.924]  Kind of like Peter Pan, hard to catch, hard to find, moves quick.
[02:33:51.924 --> 02:33:55.969]  He is right over there in the dark with a handheld microphone.
[02:33:55.969 --> 02:34:00.395]  Of course, the conspiracy theories will begin that this isn't really Matt Drudge, but people can tell it is Matt Drudge.
[02:34:00.395 --> 02:34:03.399]  I've seen a lot of his speeches, heard him pop in on shows here and there.
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:05.960]  And it's always eloquent, always thought-provoking.
[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:09.541]  This is particularly thought-provoking and will be a big newsmaker.
[02:34:09.541 --> 02:34:15.442]  They will attempt to control reality and say, how dare Matt Drudge hang out with that heretic Alex Jones.
[02:34:15.442 --> 02:34:20.323]  And we're always hearing over the last six, seven years that Matt Drudge is over, Matt Drudge doesn't exist.
[02:34:20.323 --> 02:34:22.624]  But then they have to admit Matt Drudge is bigger than ever.
[02:34:22.624 --> 02:34:29.825]  So this attempt to control reality or control who talks to who by these totalitarians that masquerade as liberals
[02:34:30.325 --> 02:34:31.345]  I don't think it's working.
[02:34:31.345 --> 02:34:37.207]  And now with Boehner being forced out, I think it shows the rumblings of the Tea Party beneath the surface.
[02:34:37.207 --> 02:34:45.610]  So, Matt, before you leave us, and I really appreciate your time... Oh, and by the way, the presidential candidates, that's exactly what you're saying, the rumblings.
[02:34:45.610 --> 02:34:52.352]  Look at anybody who has any form of success in the polls is because they rumble.
[02:34:52.352 --> 02:34:53.793]  Where it's going to end up, I don't know.
[02:34:53.793 --> 02:34:55.273]  I'm very pessimistic.
[02:34:55.273 --> 02:34:59.615]  I'm very pessimistic on this race because I'm just not so sure it's not going to end up
[02:35:00.155 --> 02:35:07.398]  With the dreaded brain in the jar in the Oval Office, once known as Hillary Clinton, who is hypothyroid.
[02:35:07.398 --> 02:35:12.860]  Anybody who is 70 years old who's hypothyroid, you do not elect president, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:12.860 --> 02:35:14.621]  You don't do it.
[02:35:14.621 --> 02:35:23.205]  Now they'll say, well, it has to be who her VP is, whether it's the Castro from San Antonio or the other Castro from San Antonio or the other Castro from San Antonio, whoever it's going to be.
[02:35:24.527 --> 02:35:31.104]  I'm just shaking now after seeing NBC giving her endless hours of airtime.
[02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:36.792]  Over the past 72 hours that Hillary's back, and she's back for real.
[02:35:36.792 --> 02:35:41.173]  Now what that means to you or me, what it means to me, I've got a long history with these people.
[02:35:41.173 --> 02:35:51.297]  They're ugly, they play dirty, they sued me for $30 million last time around, with the approval of the President, announced by the Press Secretary of the White House, a civil action.
[02:35:51.297 --> 02:35:56.839]  These people, and they didn't have the NSA then, they had Echelon, they had all these other things you were talking about even then.
[02:35:57.779 --> 02:36:00.502]  Hillary Clinton with the NSA?
[02:36:00.502 --> 02:36:02.764]  Good luck if you dissent.
[02:36:02.764 --> 02:36:04.986]  Good luck if you dissent.
[02:36:04.986 --> 02:36:07.068]  Snowden, I'll switch places with you.
[02:36:07.068 --> 02:36:10.471]  You can come over here and rot in hell, because that's what it's going to be.
[02:36:10.471 --> 02:36:14.655]  So I'm very concerned with the lay of the land, but the rumblings you're talking about
[02:36:15.310 --> 02:36:17.012]  That we've seen a Trump.
[02:36:17.012 --> 02:36:18.313]  That we've seen a Carly.
[02:36:18.313 --> 02:36:19.995]  Do we see a Sanders?
[02:36:19.995 --> 02:36:20.896]  Yeah, maybe.
[02:36:20.896 --> 02:36:22.718]  Also old.
[02:36:22.718 --> 02:36:23.399]  Old!
[02:36:23.399 --> 02:36:26.582]  Can the Democrats find anybody under the age of 70?
[02:36:26.582 --> 02:36:31.687]  What is this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a new century?
[02:36:31.687 --> 02:36:32.969]  So, I don't know.
[02:36:32.969 --> 02:36:35.071]  I'm hoping for surprises.
[02:36:35.071 --> 02:36:37.073]  I'm hoping for some jolts.
[02:36:37.073 --> 02:36:37.674]  We'll have to see.
[02:36:38.852 --> 02:36:43.313]  On a few other subjects, and I appreciate your time, I'll quit bugging you.
[02:36:43.313 --> 02:36:45.294]  There's so much going on in the world.
[02:36:45.294 --> 02:36:49.415]  Obama now is talking about, well, Australia had a good plan, we may have to do that.
[02:36:49.415 --> 02:36:51.716]  That's clearly talking about gun confiscation.
[02:36:51.716 --> 02:36:53.216]  Now Hillary's doing it.
[02:36:53.216 --> 02:36:56.157]  CNN has pundits saying, let's just take them.
[02:36:56.157 --> 02:36:59.758]  Do these people realize that this is the line in the sand at the Alamo?
[02:36:59.758 --> 02:37:04.780]  If they really come out in a frontal assault on guns, it means I think they're trying to start a civil war.
[02:37:05.874 --> 02:37:07.196]  It just seems like insanity.
[02:37:07.196 --> 02:37:11.002]  I mean, they may think that they're Stalin or something.
[02:37:11.002 --> 02:37:17.090]  Well, because they're all armed themselves, or they all have that security around them themselves.
[02:37:17.090 --> 02:37:18.773]  They don't have to worry about.
[02:37:18.773 --> 02:37:21.717]  I challenge Hillary, take away your Secret Service.
[02:37:22.489 --> 02:37:24.230]  Take it away now!
[02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:25.830]  Take away your Secret Service!
[02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:27.151]  Dismiss them!
[02:37:27.151 --> 02:37:28.751]  Have no security around you!
[02:37:28.751 --> 02:37:30.512]  Have no guns around you, Hillary!
[02:37:30.512 --> 02:37:31.272]  I dare you!
[02:37:31.272 --> 02:37:32.753]  I dare you!
[02:37:32.753 --> 02:37:34.313]  Obama, same thing!
[02:37:34.313 --> 02:37:36.354]  Drop your guns, Obama!
[02:37:36.354 --> 02:37:38.235]  Take your Secret Service away, Obama!
[02:37:39.201 --> 02:37:40.482]  Take it all away.
[02:37:40.482 --> 02:37:42.743]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[02:37:42.743 --> 02:37:45.785]  Let everybody know there's no guns on the White House grounds, Obama.
[02:37:45.785 --> 02:37:48.607]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[02:37:48.607 --> 02:37:51.489]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[02:37:51.489 --> 02:37:58.894]  So they're asking us to drop our guns and to drop our security measures, or what?
[02:37:58.894 --> 02:38:04.818]  So this thing is very real, and I don't see how it's being taken seriously, except for the sick voter.
[02:38:05.538 --> 02:38:08.520]  You can't underestimate the sickness of the American people right now.
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:09.942]  They're really sick.
[02:38:09.942 --> 02:38:13.945]  And that's to me, I'm more angry at the sick Americans than I am at Obama.
[02:38:13.945 --> 02:38:14.645]  Or Hillary.
[02:38:14.645 --> 02:38:16.147]  I'm really angry at the sick Americans.
[02:38:16.877 --> 02:38:23.542]  Matt Drudge, I used to listen to your radio show almost every Sunday, but I gotta tell you, you are even more on fire than you were then.
[02:38:23.542 --> 02:38:30.468]  And I know you're smart, you know not to be, you know, you know, too available, because distance makes the heart grow fond.
[02:38:30.468 --> 02:38:42.297]  And I tell you, but it would be great if even once a week you did like an hour podcast or something, or maybe once a month with these thoughts, because let me tell you, this is some really good radio, and I'm enjoying it, and I know the audience is.
[02:38:42.297 --> 02:38:45.520]  I mean, Matt Drudge is kind of co-hosting the Alex Jones Show right now.
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:46.161]  This is crazy!
[02:38:46.881 --> 02:38:49.443]  Well, maybe I'll join Facebook.
[02:38:49.443 --> 02:38:51.564]  Oh yeah, don't do that.
[02:38:51.564 --> 02:38:52.765]  No, I can't.
[02:38:52.765 --> 02:38:57.928]  I realize that just my personality is I've got to stay focused.
[02:38:57.928 --> 02:38:59.630]  I can't be too distracted.
[02:38:59.630 --> 02:39:03.332]  Your advice to me was right, you know, like a year ago, that don't try to do too much.
[02:39:03.332 --> 02:39:04.112]  I mean, you're right.
[02:39:04.112 --> 02:39:07.635]  Paul Joseph Watson, I told him, watch out for this.
[02:39:07.635 --> 02:39:14.840]  You know, it's a larger topic, but at my height of media availability, I was doing the website
[02:39:15.782 --> 02:39:20.566]  The TV show and the radio show at the same time, as you are doing now.
[02:39:20.566 --> 02:39:23.188]  As you are doing now.
[02:39:23.188 --> 02:39:28.192]  Mine was with the corporations, Clear Channel, News Corp, and then the Drudge Report.
[02:39:28.192 --> 02:39:37.939]  But still, I felt just myself, I felt it was just more powerful to go to the web, plus not to necessarily be playing in their playground.
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:44.723]  Because the power of the individual, as you represent sitting there right now, is powerful.
[02:39:44.723 --> 02:39:45.323]  To the heart.
[02:39:45.323 --> 02:39:52.466]  I said to Paul Joseph Watson when I saw him in London, which you just referred to a year ago, you're a romantic figure, Alex, in Americana.
[02:39:52.466 --> 02:39:55.307]  It's romantic what you do here every day.
[02:39:55.307 --> 02:39:56.188]  It just is.
[02:39:56.188 --> 02:39:57.388]  This is romance.
[02:39:57.388 --> 02:40:02.530]  Because you're an American standing up, tough, facing these headwinds.
[02:40:02.530 --> 02:40:03.451]  Wow, are they blowing.
[02:40:04.011 --> 02:40:04.752]  But you're there.
[02:40:04.752 --> 02:40:06.916]  And you're not alone.
[02:40:06.916 --> 02:40:09.961]  Limbaugh, Savage, Hannity, Levin.
[02:40:09.961 --> 02:40:12.605]  There's a lot of people on the airwaves who are as brave.
[02:40:12.605 --> 02:40:13.867]  They are brave.
[02:40:13.867 --> 02:40:14.729]  And they are living it.
[02:40:14.729 --> 02:40:15.370]  I've met them all.
[02:40:15.370 --> 02:40:17.012]  I'm friends with them all.
[02:40:17.012 --> 02:40:17.814]  They are...
[02:40:19.818 --> 02:40:25.501]  Also, operating against the grain in an America that needs to go back to that.
[02:40:25.501 --> 02:40:28.063]  Well, the system's tried to put some of them in jail.
[02:40:28.063 --> 02:40:30.504]  I mean, I know a lot of those folks don't talk about the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.
[02:40:30.504 --> 02:40:36.047]  I don't either, but, you know, these people play hardball, and some folks can say they're libertarians.
[02:40:36.047 --> 02:40:38.128]  Well, those folks don't sound libertarian enough to me.
[02:40:38.128 --> 02:40:39.209]  It doesn't matter.
[02:40:39.209 --> 02:40:45.252]  The globalists, the Democrats, the collectivists hate anybody who's conservative, anybody who believes in the individual.
[02:40:45.652 --> 02:40:51.755]  And the fact is, those people promote individualism, nationalism, and that's why they've got to be eradicated.
[02:40:51.755 --> 02:40:53.996]  What a horrible world if the system is successful.
[02:40:53.996 --> 02:40:56.877]  Matt Drudge, in your gut, in your heart, do you think
[02:40:57.745 --> 02:41:01.187]  That humanity's gonna be successful and make it the next hundred years.
[02:41:01.187 --> 02:41:02.368]  Oh, the hundred years?
[02:41:02.368 --> 02:41:05.230]  Well, of course, unless Mother Nature decides.
[02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:08.893]  You know, I'm a big fan of letting Mother Nature decide some of this, too.
[02:41:08.893 --> 02:41:11.074]  You know, we can't control a lot of this.
[02:41:11.074 --> 02:41:13.295]  There is a law to the universe.
[02:41:13.295 --> 02:41:14.716]  There just is.
[02:41:14.716 --> 02:41:15.917]  There's just a law to the universe.
[02:41:15.917 --> 02:41:18.419]  We could have the San Andreas ripped tonight.
[02:41:18.419 --> 02:41:19.380]  You had nothing to do with that.
[02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:26.023]  We could have had that super hurricane that, look what they did to South Carolina, two or three hundred miles offshore.
[02:41:26.023 --> 02:41:30.285]  Imagine if a Category 5 eyewall went right up the Chesapeake Bay.
[02:41:30.285 --> 02:41:31.885]  They could say, well, mankind did that.
[02:41:31.885 --> 02:41:33.506]  No, Mother Nature decides.
[02:41:33.506 --> 02:41:34.547]  So will we survive?
[02:41:34.547 --> 02:41:35.267]  I'm sure we will.
[02:41:35.267 --> 02:41:36.187]  What will we be?
[02:41:38.331 --> 02:41:40.513]  Not allowed to speak as we are today?
[02:41:40.513 --> 02:41:44.435]  Well, we'll have it documented that we were allowed to speak that way once.
[02:41:44.435 --> 02:41:46.337]  So, I... I don't know.
[02:41:46.337 --> 02:41:47.958]  Am I optimistic for myself?
[02:41:47.958 --> 02:41:48.879]  Personally, yes.
[02:41:48.879 --> 02:41:49.959]  I'm strong.
[02:41:49.959 --> 02:41:51.020]  There's not much they can do.
[02:41:51.020 --> 02:41:52.201]  They could laser beam me.
[02:41:52.201 --> 02:41:53.082]  They could drone me.
[02:41:53.082 --> 02:41:54.703]  They can plutonium me.
[02:41:54.703 --> 02:41:57.065]  They could do whatever they wanted, but spiritually, I'm set.
[02:41:57.725 --> 02:41:58.965]  I've already got it.
[02:41:58.965 --> 02:42:00.466]  So they can't do much.
[02:42:00.466 --> 02:42:06.967]  I just wish there was more media that was trailblazing and independent.
[02:42:06.967 --> 02:42:20.271]  And this to me is a big danger right now in this setup is you've got these corporations like the New York Times and the Amazon now with the Washington Post and Time Warner and all of them seem to be the same.
[02:42:21.482 --> 02:42:32.968]  This is what's frightening and there's so much news in the course of the day and the reason I think the Drudge Report is interesting every morning is it's not exactly the same as you would see.
[02:42:34.204 --> 02:42:37.787]  Elsewhere and that's because I'm not involved with other people.
[02:42:37.787 --> 02:42:39.708]  I'm looking at the world through my eyes.
[02:42:39.708 --> 02:42:53.598]  And that's what you're seeing with bravery and with the ability to do it because the ability to do it what you've created here with one listener one day that went to 10 listeners that went to 50 to now your millions.
[02:42:54.338 --> 02:42:57.901]  Was organically grown, and that's kind of how Earth proceeds.
[02:42:57.901 --> 02:43:00.864]  And it usually takes time, you're absolutely right.
[02:43:00.864 --> 02:43:12.674]  Looking at the open announcements by the Pope for world government, carbon taxes, looking for Obama announcing similar things, they've gone from denying this planetary system is being set up to now admitting it.
[02:43:12.674 --> 02:43:17.339]  We've got all these key meetings, TPP being agreed on just a few days ago.
[02:43:19.208 --> 02:43:23.392]  How is that affecting the people that were brainwashed and told none of this was happening?
[02:43:23.392 --> 02:43:28.257]  How are they going to respond now when all of this starts coming to fruition?
[02:43:28.257 --> 02:43:31.500]  I've been traveling a lot and I'm seeing a lot of desperation everywhere.
[02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:33.542]  A lot of sad desperation.
[02:43:33.542 --> 02:43:39.848]  I was just in an airport and even down to this, a woman selling Southwest Airlines credit cards, standing like a robot.
[02:43:40.268 --> 02:43:41.888]  Have you signed up yet?
[02:43:41.888 --> 02:43:43.489]  Are you a member of the club?
[02:43:43.489 --> 02:43:44.229]  It was tragic.
[02:43:44.229 --> 02:43:49.471]  This is a mature woman with a beautiful face and life, and I'm like, how did she get there?
[02:43:49.471 --> 02:43:52.831]  What has happened to this culture that she's now standing as a robot like this?
[02:43:52.831 --> 02:43:59.853]  They are sucking our ability to make an income that is compatible with what you need to.
[02:43:59.853 --> 02:44:01.934]  So I'm getting a little frightened as I travel.
[02:44:02.714 --> 02:44:07.799]  On the other side of it, when I go to New York and I see some of the billionaires, it's the other side!
[02:44:07.799 --> 02:44:09.280]  Endless!
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:12.383]  You know, they're fighting over pieces of artwork.
[02:44:12.383 --> 02:44:16.587]  It's gotten to the point where the have and the have-nots here is breaking.
[02:44:17.848 --> 02:44:25.050]  And it's the billionaires that are mainly funding the whole leftist redistribution movement because they end up getting the money in corporate welfare and insider deals.
[02:44:25.050 --> 02:44:26.971]  It's so sick.
[02:44:26.971 --> 02:44:28.051]  I watched a great film.
[02:44:28.051 --> 02:44:32.933]  I don't know if you've seen it yet, but it's The Best of Enemies about Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley.
[02:44:32.933 --> 02:44:33.613]  Have you seen that yet?
[02:44:33.613 --> 02:44:33.993]  No.
[02:44:33.993 --> 02:44:34.613]  You've got to see it.
[02:44:36.454 --> 02:44:43.643]  It shows Gore Vidal arguing, saying the answer is... Oh, and by the way, why are we not allowed to have a Gore Vidal-William Buckley anymore in the media scene?
[02:44:43.643 --> 02:44:45.205]  Do you see who they hire?
[02:44:45.205 --> 02:44:47.608]  Do you see who's hired for the shows?
[02:44:47.608 --> 02:44:48.589]  How dull they are?
[02:44:48.589 --> 02:44:49.330]  Yes.
[02:44:49.330 --> 02:44:50.171]  Dull!
[02:44:50.171 --> 02:44:50.912]  Dull as dishwater.
[02:44:50.912 --> 02:44:52.995]  They want you to tune out of politics and into entertainment.
[02:44:53.035 --> 02:44:53.796]  Yes, they make it.
[02:44:53.796 --> 02:44:56.798]  Where are the flamboyant characters?
[02:44:56.798 --> 02:44:59.239]  This is what America desperately needs right now.
[02:44:59.239 --> 02:45:04.683]  Flamboyant intellectual characters who can cut different ways.
[02:45:04.683 --> 02:45:05.944]  And that's just what I'm missing.
[02:45:05.944 --> 02:45:10.587]  I've been fortunate enough to meet some of the greats of this generation, and I've got to tell you, they are there.
[02:45:11.287 --> 02:45:18.089]  It's just they are suppressed and hidden, and they're not hired the way Gore Vidal and Buckley were back a previous generation.
[02:45:18.089 --> 02:45:19.949]  They were not afraid of ideas.
[02:45:19.949 --> 02:45:24.910]  This generation is frightened of ideas, or at least it's being suppressed.
[02:45:24.910 --> 02:45:26.551]  Let's throw in in the few minutes we have left.
[02:45:26.551 --> 02:45:29.392]  We're about to go to break, and I know you've given us more time than you even said you would.
[02:45:29.392 --> 02:45:35.973]  Matt Drudge is our guest, DrudgeReport.com, obviously in studio here in Austin, Texas, visiting a surprise visit, one of the best ever.
[02:45:35.973 --> 02:45:37.854]  That's better than surprise birthday parties I've had.
[02:45:39.443 --> 02:45:50.972]  Shifting gears, I don't think that it's Putin's this great angel or this wonderful perfect person, but our foreign policy is so corrupt, so deceptive, it makes him look good, and nobody's going to back Al-Qaeda.
[02:45:50.972 --> 02:46:08.186]  I talked about this last Thursday and Friday, and I'll find the article and we'll put it in this video later and put it out as a report, but it was Reuters reporting that the White House is angry that these airstrikes by the Russians have hit the moderates, al-Nusra, which is Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[02:46:09.210 --> 02:46:14.958]  And then it just went on, and they're telling him to stop doing it, and he didn't hit ISIS.
[02:46:14.958 --> 02:46:18.602]  But then Putin pointed out, no, that's the bosses of ISIS, that's just their fighters.
[02:46:18.602 --> 02:46:20.164]  It's the same group, which is true.
[02:46:20.164 --> 02:46:21.606]  But it's Twilight Zone.
[02:46:21.606 --> 02:46:26.532]  I can't even believe I'm reading Reuters, who has writers with a straight face,
[02:46:27.153 --> 02:46:36.199]  That we'll just sit there and write articles about how Al Qaeda is moderate and not bad, and then we criticize Russia for bombing them when they're attacking Russian interest.
[02:46:36.199 --> 02:46:38.300]  It's just so bizarre.
[02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:42.303]  It seems like that Karl Rove quote where he said, we control reality.
[02:46:42.303 --> 02:46:45.125]  I don't think Obama and these guys really control reality.
[02:46:45.125 --> 02:46:50.649]  And now we've got John McCain saying, let's go ahead and end Zbigniew Brzezinski and have war with Russia.
[02:46:50.649 --> 02:46:52.730]  Let's go ahead and attack the Russian aircraft.
[02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:54.511]  I mean, it's crazy town!
[02:46:54.511 --> 02:46:55.252]  What do you say to that?
[02:46:55.252 --> 02:46:56.413]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:46:56.413 --> 02:47:01.557]  We never even heard of ISIS until recently, and I remember when that name first started coming up.
[02:47:01.557 --> 02:47:04.960]  Do you know it was designed to be confused with Daryl Issa?
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:06.020]  No, I didn't know that.
[02:47:06.020 --> 02:47:07.462]  Do you know that's what it was?
[02:47:07.462 --> 02:47:10.824]  Because Daryl Issa was the enemy at the time of this administration.
[02:47:10.824 --> 02:47:13.606]  You know, there would have been a time Obama could have been impeached.
[02:47:13.606 --> 02:47:15.608]  And I'm thinking the IRS scandal, most likely.
[02:47:15.608 --> 02:47:16.289]  That would have been the one.
[02:47:17.042 --> 02:47:24.669]  You get the depositions going, you get the president under oath, you follow the chain, Obama most likely would have been impeached.
[02:47:24.669 --> 02:47:29.152]  Boehner decided, we're not going there, we're not going to have those cities burn.
[02:47:29.152 --> 02:47:30.153]  We're not going to do it.
[02:47:30.153 --> 02:47:32.375]  We're not going to impeach Obama.
[02:47:32.375 --> 02:47:35.878]  So, I felt Daryl Issa, that's his name, right?
[02:47:35.878 --> 02:47:36.739]  Issa, Daryl Issa.
[02:47:40.143 --> 02:47:45.749]  I think they came up with the name ISIS to be confused with Daryl Issa.
[02:47:45.749 --> 02:47:47.490]  I'm really being honest with you.
[02:47:47.490 --> 02:47:52.215]  I remember when the first time Christiane Amanpour sputtered out this word ISIS.
[02:47:52.215 --> 02:47:54.777]  I'm thinking, where did she get that one?
[02:47:55.538 --> 02:47:57.561]  You know, these words are creative.
[02:47:57.561 --> 02:47:58.662]  These events are creative.
[02:47:58.662 --> 02:48:01.766]  Now we act like, oh, ISIS has been around for 20, 30 years.
[02:48:01.766 --> 02:48:02.226]  Says who?
[02:48:02.226 --> 02:48:03.608]  It's been around a year and a half.
[02:48:03.608 --> 02:48:04.109]  Yeah.
[02:48:04.109 --> 02:48:06.291]  Designed to confuse.
[02:48:06.291 --> 02:48:10.076]  And then the president going, it's not even ISIS, it's ISIL.
[02:48:10.076 --> 02:48:10.977]  Or ice.
[02:48:10.977 --> 02:48:11.838]  Or isl.
[02:48:11.838 --> 02:48:12.379]  Or is.
[02:48:13.410 --> 02:48:14.992]  This is Dr. Seuss!
[02:48:14.992 --> 02:48:15.973]  This is madness!
[02:48:15.973 --> 02:48:22.079]  I'm glad you're able to follow any of it, because when I sit down and look at the news, I'm not able to follow the bouncing ball.
[02:48:22.079 --> 02:48:22.940]  Is Putin here?
[02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:24.121]  Is Obama here?
[02:48:24.121 --> 02:48:25.722]  Where does this one go?
[02:48:25.722 --> 02:48:26.463]  I can't follow.
[02:48:26.463 --> 02:48:27.664]  Can you put the pieces together?
[02:48:27.664 --> 02:48:29.006]  I'm glad you can, because I can't.
[02:48:30.424 --> 02:48:34.885]  Wow, well we're going to break here in about a minute and a half, and then I'm going to come back and play a special report.
[02:48:34.885 --> 02:48:37.826]  They're going to go into the fourth hour, being hosted by one of our co-hosts today.
[02:48:37.826 --> 02:48:41.367]  But Matt, in the two minutes we've got left, it's amazing to have you here.
[02:48:41.367 --> 02:48:43.848]  What else do you think is front and center in the universe?
[02:48:43.848 --> 02:48:54.451]  In the last two minutes here, what do you want to say to the audience and to the dinosaur media that is going to gleefully try to edit this and chop this up, and I guess use it for their funeral pyre?
[02:48:55.211 --> 02:48:56.393]  Well, they're welcome to again.
[02:48:56.393 --> 02:48:58.517]  They've got no control over the situation.
[02:48:58.517 --> 02:48:59.318]  None.
[02:48:59.318 --> 02:49:00.119]  No control.
[02:49:00.119 --> 02:49:01.061]  No control over me.
[02:49:01.061 --> 02:49:01.882]  Sorry.
[02:49:01.882 --> 02:49:03.244]  Zero.
[02:49:03.244 --> 02:49:04.747]  I wanted to congratulate you.
[02:49:04.747 --> 02:49:06.710]  You're one of the... and people don't really talk about this.
[02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:08.613]  You are one of the first to stream 24 hours a day.
[02:49:10.439 --> 02:49:16.463]  And I think the reason I was drawn into InfoWars was because of this streaming.
[02:49:16.463 --> 02:49:29.110]  This is a profound break that you did to allow the audience to hear you at any time, to make it available at any time, from anywhere, looping, looping, looping, until the next broadcast.
[02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:30.571]  This is a profound thing you did.
[02:49:30.571 --> 02:49:32.652]  I don't think that's recognized enough in the industry.
[02:49:32.652 --> 02:49:35.954]  I'm just talking shop talk here for a second.
[02:49:35.954 --> 02:49:36.555]  That was big.
[02:49:37.395 --> 02:49:44.641]  Because what you're seeing with the AM dial now, and I'm not besmirching any stations that are carrying this right now, but some of these ratings are frightening.
[02:49:44.641 --> 02:49:47.043]  Some of these ratings in these major cities are frightening.
[02:49:47.043 --> 02:49:52.988]  I'm talking about half the listeners, generally overall, for every talk host.
[02:49:52.988 --> 02:49:56.310]  Some of them are down a half, a half in one year.
[02:49:57.151 --> 02:50:05.305]  Something is going on, but you broke through with this 24-hour looping, always available, on my happiest nights.
[02:50:05.305 --> 02:50:08.611]  I'm sitting here and I'm listening to you from wherever I am in the world.
[02:50:09.454 --> 02:50:10.595]  Looping.
[02:50:10.595 --> 02:50:11.915]  Getting it, getting it, getting it.
[02:50:11.915 --> 02:50:13.236]  And the guests.
[02:50:13.236 --> 02:50:14.797]  This is a profound shift.
[02:50:14.797 --> 02:50:16.638]  Available anytime, from anywhere.
[02:50:16.638 --> 02:50:17.879]  That was you, Alex.
[02:50:17.879 --> 02:50:18.419]  That was a big one.
[02:50:18.419 --> 02:50:19.519]  That was like 12 years ago.
[02:50:19.519 --> 02:50:27.624]  I said, why don't we just send the stream out once, and then wait for a podcast to come up before they even called it podcast, which is an MP3.
[02:50:27.624 --> 02:50:29.505]  So organically again.
[02:50:29.505 --> 02:50:34.007]  Yet again, another organically grown decision that changed the media landscape.
[02:50:34.007 --> 02:50:35.448]  Well sure, and I said, why not just have
[02:50:35.808 --> 02:50:44.015]  I don't want to just have, because I was one of the first, people were doing this 20 years ago, Limbaugh was probably the first, with a little, you know, pod cam, took a photo every minute or something.
[02:50:44.015 --> 02:50:52.963]  I said, why don't we just put cameras in here so I can show people articles, show them photos, show them books, and even show them video clips, and then we'll start streaming it.
[02:50:52.963 --> 02:50:56.927]  And by the way, Limbaugh was genius for doing that because he bypassed broadcast.
[02:50:57.327 --> 02:51:01.130]  He didn't have to hook up with a Fox or CNN to show him in real time.
[02:51:01.130 --> 02:51:02.491]  He was able to bypass that.
[02:51:02.491 --> 02:51:05.314]  And I think there was some cams for radio shows before that.
[02:51:05.314 --> 02:51:05.614]  Sure.
[02:51:05.614 --> 02:51:07.015]  But he did it on the larger scale.
[02:51:07.015 --> 02:51:12.540]  But what you did by breaking the mold, by breaking the mold, whatever you said that day, like, why don't we loop it?
[02:51:13.396 --> 02:51:15.377]  I can't tell you how that's changed.
[02:51:15.377 --> 02:51:28.506]  I would say the majority of your listeners are, have, and will discover you through the looping and the broadcast, because now we can drive around and listen to you without the streaming, even though it seems like the streaming is where things are going.
[02:51:28.506 --> 02:51:31.108]  I gotta say, when you broke the egg there,
[02:51:31.889 --> 02:51:34.071]  When you cracked the egg, that was a big one.
[02:51:34.071 --> 02:51:37.213]  That was a Stanley Kubrick moment of the bone going up.
[02:51:37.213 --> 02:51:38.153]  What you did with that one.
[02:51:38.153 --> 02:51:38.654]  So that was a big one.
[02:51:38.654 --> 02:51:54.104]  Well, I don't think it's as big as the bones you've been throwing up to turn into the spaceships, but I tell you, it's amazing to just have the diverse audience that tunes in to hear me babble, speak of the devil, like people like Stanley Kubrick's daughter and folks that have popped up too, and you're like, you check it out, this is really Stanley Kubrick's daughter that helped make some of his films.
[02:51:54.104 --> 02:51:54.725]  It just blows your mind.
[02:51:54.725 --> 02:51:57.547]  Oh, and by the way, if Stanley Kubrick was alive, can you imagine?
[02:51:57.547 --> 02:51:58.828]  Can you imagine where he would have gone?
[02:51:59.508 --> 02:52:00.689]  He would have done some great work.
[02:52:00.689 --> 02:52:01.029]  Oh.
[02:52:01.029 --> 02:52:03.190]  We're missing the Hollywood push too.
[02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:04.751]  Where's the greatness coming out of Hollywood?
[02:52:04.751 --> 02:52:05.632]  They want it dumbed down.
[02:52:05.632 --> 02:52:08.253]  Enough of the Martian crap.
[02:52:08.253 --> 02:52:11.555]  Tell us something big and real and profound as Kubrick would have.
[02:52:11.555 --> 02:52:12.555]  On a human level.
[02:52:12.555 --> 02:52:13.136]  On a human level.
[02:52:13.956 --> 02:52:20.298]  Well, I'm not allowed to say what I was told about Kubrick, but let me say, it was obvious from his films, he would be on board with us.
[02:52:20.298 --> 02:52:23.559]  You know, Spielberg keeps going back to World War II.
[02:52:23.559 --> 02:52:24.960]  I mean, enough already.
[02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:26.881]  Let's get focused.
[02:52:26.881 --> 02:52:27.761]  I look at a P.T.
[02:52:27.761 --> 02:52:31.882]  Anderson, and I don't know, it's kind of gone into a marijuana cloud for me.
[02:52:31.882 --> 02:52:35.424]  Where are the artists who are challenging this generation like Kubrick did?
[02:52:35.424 --> 02:52:37.204]  So, that's another topic separately.
[02:52:37.204 --> 02:52:38.625]  Well, we're going to break in one minute.
[02:52:38.625 --> 02:52:40.445]  We're going to air John Bowne's report, come back.
[02:52:40.445 --> 02:52:41.806]  And who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[02:52:43.877 --> 02:52:53.822]  Thunderstruck, David Knight's got a bunch coming up and obviously we need to get clips of this epic interview, play those and put those out on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:53.822 --> 02:53:02.506]  Matt, how fast do you think, here's what's crazy, five years ago I cared if mainstream media wrote stories against us or I cared if I was on Nightline or something, you've been in more big stuff than I have.
[02:53:02.506 --> 02:53:10.170]  Now it doesn't even do anything when I'm on those shows, that's why I know that they don't mean anything and so we should end with this, you were the guy
[02:53:11.107 --> 02:53:19.215]  Who tweeted, at least from what I saw, at Piers Morgan three years ago, or two and a half years ago, to say, have Alex Jones on, debate him.
[02:53:19.215 --> 02:53:19.836]  Matchmaker.
[02:53:19.836 --> 02:53:24.340]  Yeah, behind the scenes, people don't know this about me, I'm a matchmaker behind the scenes.
[02:53:24.340 --> 02:53:28.884]  That I've had the ability to make some deals happen and do some things behind the scenes.
[02:53:28.884 --> 02:53:32.508]  Now I've never met Piers Morgan, but I do believe that tweet that day did lead to that.
[02:53:32.768 --> 02:53:41.978]  Well, no, they told me in his office, they said, what do you think of Matt Drudge's idea, because they got my cell phone number and called me, CNN had it, and I said... Which ended up being the most dramatic moment on CNN in a generation.
[02:53:41.978 --> 02:53:43.259]  They admit that.
[02:53:43.259 --> 02:53:44.600]  They have votes and say that.
[02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:48.764]  That's why they need to hire people away from 6th Avenue just to look at the scene.
[02:53:48.764 --> 02:53:52.688]  I remember once saying to Charlie Rose, why aren't you having more conservatives on?
[02:53:52.688 --> 02:53:54.130]  And he says, who?
[02:53:54.130 --> 02:53:55.611]  And, you know, there's a whole list of them.
[02:53:56.312 --> 02:53:57.933]  Why are they limiting themselves?
[02:53:57.933 --> 02:54:02.514]  Because you would say it's a, you know, it's a contrived plan to limit.
[02:54:02.514 --> 02:54:10.756]  But I still think to make provocative programming, you've got to have different points of view, a la the Buckley and Vidal, Gore Vidal.
[02:54:10.756 --> 02:54:13.057]  Where is that in this culture?
[02:54:13.057 --> 02:54:13.717]  It's missing.
[02:54:13.717 --> 02:54:15.478]  I get it from Infowars.
[02:54:15.478 --> 02:54:17.759]  I get it from other places too, mainly talk radio.
[02:54:17.759 --> 02:54:22.780]  Talk radio seems to be the driving force of this culture, at least in spoken word.
[02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:24.821]  I'm not getting it from television that much.
[02:54:24.821 --> 02:54:25.441]  I'm just not.
[02:54:26.221 --> 02:54:28.442]  Where are the intriguing television shows?
[02:54:28.442 --> 02:54:31.704]  I mean, you could say Homeland, you can say some of these others.
[02:54:31.704 --> 02:54:33.205]  Okay, yes.
[02:54:33.205 --> 02:54:35.646]  But where are the real dynamic things that are pushing?
[02:54:35.646 --> 02:54:37.327]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:54:37.327 --> 02:54:42.070]  Piers Morgan had a ratings boost for about 30-40% for two weeks after that.
[02:54:42.070 --> 02:54:45.372]  Then it went down, steadily declined, and they got rid of him.
[02:54:45.372 --> 02:54:47.093]  CNN knows that if they
[02:54:47.853 --> 02:54:49.915]  Well, it all depends if the sick Americans get un-sick.
[02:54:49.915 --> 02:54:50.775]  That's all.
[02:54:50.775 --> 02:54:52.917]  That's all you just have to do because if you get well, if you get well,
[02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:14.552]  You're not that interested in what Anderson Cooper is saying about things.
[02:55:14.552 --> 02:55:15.593]  You're just not, I'm sorry.
[02:55:15.593 --> 02:55:17.314]  I don't mean to be insulting.
[02:55:17.314 --> 02:55:21.316]  If you're sick, you find comfort in that.
[02:55:21.316 --> 02:55:22.917]  What are your final words?
[02:55:22.917 --> 02:55:24.979]  What do you mean final words?
[02:55:24.979 --> 02:55:27.180]  These are the last words ever spoken on earth?
[02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:28.021]  These are the final words?
[02:55:28.021 --> 02:55:29.742]  Yes, George Washington says tis well.
[02:55:30.992 --> 02:55:35.795]  Well, again, I just wanted to come to congratulate you from building organically from the ground up.
[02:55:35.795 --> 02:55:37.416]  Thank you.
[02:55:37.416 --> 02:55:40.178]  A media that is not only American, it's just Western.
[02:55:40.178 --> 02:55:42.139]  It's not even Western, it's just freedom.
[02:55:42.139 --> 02:55:49.344]  I can imagine somebody right now listening to us who's sitting in a prison cell somewhere, somewhere awful, thinking about freedom.
[02:55:49.344 --> 02:55:50.985]  So, congratulations to you.
[02:55:50.985 --> 02:55:52.025]  I have more power to you.
[02:55:52.025 --> 02:55:52.866]  Take care of yourself.
[02:55:53.601 --> 02:55:55.622]  Because, you know, you're the vehicle, too.
[02:55:55.622 --> 02:55:57.562]  Well, I'm speechless, Matt Drudge.
[02:55:57.562 --> 02:55:58.502]  I can't go on.
[02:55:58.502 --> 02:55:59.523]  Sorry to the callers.
[02:55:59.523 --> 02:56:00.623]  David Knight's coming up.
[02:56:00.623 --> 02:56:02.324]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[02:56:02.324 --> 02:56:02.804]  to 2 p.m.
[02:56:02.804 --> 02:56:03.544]  Central.
[02:56:03.544 --> 02:56:08.365]  A fourth hour coming up as we move into the Overdrive Show and Nightly News tonight at 7.
[02:56:08.365 --> 02:56:12.607]  But we're going to go ahead and go to this John Bowne report and then come back with the fourth hour.
[02:56:12.607 --> 02:56:15.007]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find all that.
[02:56:15.007 --> 02:56:16.208]  Matt Drudge is here in studio.
[02:56:16.208 --> 02:56:17.608]  I'm going to give him the tour now.
[02:56:17.608 --> 02:56:18.108]  Thank you, Matt.
[02:56:18.108 --> 02:56:19.709]  That was an amazing 45 minutes.
[02:56:19.709 --> 02:56:20.309]  Here's the report.
[02:56:22.093 --> 02:56:25.396]  There's been another mass shooting in America.
[02:56:25.396 --> 02:56:30.600]  This time in a community college in Oregon.
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:41.150]  That means there are more American families, moms, dads, children, whose lives have been changed forever.
[02:56:41.150 --> 02:56:43.272]  That means there's another community stunned with grief.
[02:56:44.555 --> 02:57:00.980]  And communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children.
[02:57:00.980 --> 02:57:10.023]  We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston.
[02:57:10.023 --> 02:57:12.984]  It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict
[02:57:18.245 --> 02:57:19.866]  More families victimized.
[02:57:19.866 --> 02:57:32.377]  More average citizens President Obama may or may not personally offer his condolences to because he is too busy pleading his case to eliminate our constitutional Second Amendment right to protect ourselves and our communities.
[02:57:32.377 --> 02:57:40.725]  Pew Research's July 2014 poll, The Demographics and Politics of Gun Owning Households, found that about 6 in 10 gun household members
[02:57:41.365 --> 02:57:44.386]  Over 64% say they often feel proud to be an American.
[02:57:44.386 --> 02:57:49.007]  In contrast, about half, 51% of other adults say this.
[02:57:49.007 --> 02:57:54.548]  There exists a constitutional mindset and reason for owning a weapon in the United States.
[02:57:54.548 --> 02:58:02.209]  The United States ranks numero uno in gun ownership, dominating at 88.8% per 100 residents.
[02:58:02.209 --> 02:58:06.910]  According to 2014 numbers from the Small Arms Survey based in Geneva, Switzerland,
[02:58:07.090 --> 02:58:08.111]  We're good to go.
[02:58:22.265 --> 02:58:26.466]  We as a nation require an order for our republic to operate.
[02:58:26.466 --> 02:58:29.347]  And the media spin on the coverage is always the same.
[02:58:29.347 --> 02:58:31.648]  Who cares who the shooter was in Oregon?
[02:58:31.648 --> 02:58:32.628]  Why should we?
[02:58:32.628 --> 02:58:42.472]  Our immediate and only reality-based concerns should be for the families and communities that need to be protected by the next incident, whether it's three months or three years from now.
[02:58:42.472 --> 02:58:44.972]  If we could just all pay attention to the numbers.
[02:58:49.019 --> 02:58:49.219]  Thank you.
[02:59:18.590 --> 02:59:19.710]  BrainForce is here.
[02:59:19.710 --> 02:59:21.911]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:21.911 --> 02:59:26.912]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:26.912 --> 02:59:28.612]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:59:28.612 --> 02:59:30.193]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:30.193 --> 02:59:33.674]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:33.674 --> 02:59:35.654]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:35.654 --> 02:59:36.514]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:59:36.514 --> 02:59:37.795]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:37.795 --> 02:59:39.775]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:59:39.775 --> 02:59:45.356]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:50.834 --> 03:00:01.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.539 --> 03:00:08.182]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.182 --> 03:00:11.144]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:14.904 --> 03:00:16.525]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:16.525 --> 03:00:19.908]  On this fourth hour of the news wrap-up, I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:00:19.908 --> 03:00:22.169]  Pretty amazing to see Matt Drudge in here.
[03:00:22.169 --> 03:00:25.732]  We have a lot of stories that we cover of his all the time, as everyone does.
[03:00:25.732 --> 03:00:28.594]  It's pretty amazing to see him in person.
[03:00:28.594 --> 03:00:29.895]  Quite a surprise.
[03:00:29.895 --> 03:00:34.678]  We're going to talk in this next hour about something that I think is more important than the presidential race.
[03:00:34.678 --> 03:00:37.080]  Certainly more imminent than the presidential race.
[03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:38.601]  That's about a year away.
[03:00:39.722 --> 03:00:45.584]  But what's going to happen is within the next few days, we're going to have another Speaker of the House.
[03:00:45.584 --> 03:00:47.565]  He's going to have a lot of power.
[03:00:47.565 --> 03:00:48.445]  A lot of power.
[03:00:48.445 --> 03:00:52.566]  We've got the Trans-Pacific Partnership that just was approved, we're told, finally.
[03:00:52.566 --> 03:00:54.687]  Although, we don't know what's in it yet.
[03:00:55.507 --> 03:00:56.908]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:00:56.908 --> 03:01:03.170]  We're getting all kinds of reactions from the corporations that put this together with their corporate lobbyists.
[03:01:03.170 --> 03:01:10.813]  We're getting reactions from their political puppets that they pay to be their spokesman, their representative, saying, I don't like this part about it.
[03:01:10.813 --> 03:01:12.394]  I don't like this about this industry.
[03:01:12.394 --> 03:01:13.855]  So we're going to talk about that.
[03:01:13.855 --> 03:01:21.598]  But we're also going to talk about this speaker race, because it's going to have a huge impact on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example.
[03:01:21.598 --> 03:01:23.919]  But it's going to have an impact on everything.
[03:01:24.679 --> 03:01:28.101]  You have to understand how powerful that office is.
[03:01:28.101 --> 03:01:29.842]  Very little attention is being given to that.
[03:01:29.842 --> 03:01:31.562]  There's not much of a choice, quite frankly.
[03:01:31.562 --> 03:01:32.983]  There's only three people who are running for it.
[03:01:32.983 --> 03:01:34.964]  They're going to be meeting tonight, privately.
[03:01:34.964 --> 03:01:39.566]  So we're going to talk a little bit about who these people are, what we might expect from them.
[03:01:39.566 --> 03:01:40.947]  Are things really going to change?
[03:01:40.947 --> 03:01:43.088]  Are we simply going to get a new face?
[03:01:43.088 --> 03:01:45.850]  We're also going to talk about killer robots, the push to
[03:01:46.670 --> 03:01:48.251]  Put that on us.
[03:01:48.251 --> 03:01:50.691]  We see yet again this subject has come up.
[03:01:50.691 --> 03:01:54.313]  We've talked to Noel Sharkey in the past about his concerns about that.
[03:01:54.313 --> 03:02:00.034]  He's quoted in the article that's on Drudge Report about a UN delay could open the door to the robot wars.
[03:02:00.034 --> 03:02:06.937]  And of course what they're trying to do is get some kind of a ban, a limit, on autonomous killing machines.
[03:02:07.844 --> 03:02:10.565]  You need to think about how important this is.
[03:02:10.565 --> 03:02:23.472]  It was just last Friday that Alex Jones interviewed Annie Jacobson, who had written The Pentagon's Brain, a very, very compelling history of DARPA and, I would say, the entire military-industrial complex.
[03:02:23.472 --> 03:02:25.433]  It's a very well-written book.
[03:02:25.433 --> 03:02:30.116]  Listening to it on audiobook is like listening to or watching a documentary.
[03:02:30.116 --> 03:02:32.277]  It's much more compelling than many documentaries I've seen.
[03:02:32.277 --> 03:02:34.318]  She's a very good reader, but what she does in her book
[03:02:35.058 --> 03:02:46.790]  She fills out the characters, there's backstories of these scientists, backstories of the organizations, and right now I'm still kind of about the first third of the book as I listen to it.
[03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:56.700]  Right now she's talking about the Cold War, about the efforts to try to limit this runaway nuclear race between the Russians and the Americans that happened 60 some odd years ago.
[03:02:57.608 --> 03:03:07.212]  We were fortunate at the time to have somebody who had a moral compass, a sense of proportion, and a knowledge of the military, President Eisenhower.
[03:03:07.212 --> 03:03:21.478]  He pushed very hard against this and as she pointed out in the interview when she was talking to Alex, one of the people that she was very concerned about, there were two people that he said he feared greatly, Edward Teller and Werner Von Braun.
[03:03:21.478 --> 03:03:22.318]  There's a very funny
[03:03:24.156 --> 03:03:32.739]  Very funny song about Wernher von Braun that was done by a guy back in the sixties who knew, many, many people knew that he was a hardcore Nazi.
[03:03:32.739 --> 03:03:34.500]  He was an SS member.
[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:44.144]  The scientists that worked with him at NASA that he wanted to bring in when he was offered the leadership of DARPA, these guys were hardcore SA and SS members.
[03:03:44.144 --> 03:03:45.184]  They were true believers.
[03:03:45.184 --> 03:03:47.085]  They were very dangerous people.
[03:03:47.085 --> 03:03:49.906]  Many of the people that we brought over in Operation Paperclip, and it's not just
[03:03:50.851 --> 03:04:12.045]  DARPA, it was also the bioweapons technology that was brought over, that was essentially manned by Nazi war criminals, Japanese war criminals, people who had the idea that they could experiment on humans without having, because they said it's in the greater good, they don't need to have informed consent from the individuals because we're doing this for the greater good.
[03:04:12.844 --> 03:04:20.286]  So that gave them carte blanche in their eyes to do some of the worst atrocities that mankind has ever seen.
[03:04:20.286 --> 03:04:31.248]  That's why it's so important that we do not lose informed consent, whether it comes to vaccinations or anything else that the medical community does, or anything that our government does.
[03:04:31.248 --> 03:04:39.109]  So we're going to talk about one other aspect of informed consent, and that is our Bill of Rights and how that is under attack in many different directions.
[03:04:39.109 --> 03:04:40.690]  We've got a lot to talk about.
[03:04:40.690 --> 03:04:41.310]  Stay with us.
[03:04:41.310 --> 03:04:41.910]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:58.835 --> 03:05:03.177]  The politically correct police are calling for the ban of ham sandwiches.
[03:05:03.177 --> 03:05:06.398]  That's right, eating lunch is now considered offensive.
[03:05:06.398 --> 03:05:09.579]  The guidelines published by Coexist House, a U.S.
[03:05:09.579 --> 03:05:18.622]  and U.K.-based interfaith group, recommended an outright ban of pork products from office kitchens to avoid offending employees of Muslim and Jewish faiths.
[03:05:19.002 --> 03:05:28.905]  It would be good etiquette to avoid heating up foods that might be prohibited for people of other faiths, said a University of London professor who wrote the guidelines for Coexist House.
[03:05:28.905 --> 03:05:31.186]  And this isn't a one-off incident.
[03:05:31.186 --> 03:05:46.191]  Back in 2013, a Portland principal pushed to ban speaking about peanut butter and jelly because it's not a popular combination around the globe, saying that Somali or Hispanic students may feel left out of the conversation because they don't eat sandwiches.
[03:05:46.531 --> 03:05:48.515]  And a grocery store in a black St.
[03:05:48.515 --> 03:05:54.046]  Louis neighborhood filled with questions of racism for not having asparagus sitting in a tray of water.
[03:05:54.046 --> 03:05:57.573]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[03:07:07.463 --> 03:07:15.551]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:07:15.851 --> 03:07:20.735]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:08:00.276 --> 03:08:05.678]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:05.678 --> 03:08:07.939]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:13.735 --> 03:08:17.982]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this 4th hour, October 6, 2015.
[03:08:17.982 --> 03:08:18.843]  My name is David Knight.
[03:08:18.843 --> 03:08:20.225]  I'm your host this last hour.
[03:08:20.225 --> 03:08:22.288]  We're doing a news wrap-up.
[03:08:22.288 --> 03:08:24.592]  One of the things that has presented itself today...
[03:08:25.675 --> 03:08:28.476]  Yet another example of out-of-control killer robots.
[03:08:28.476 --> 03:08:35.819]  As I was talking about in the last example, we have to get control of this like we got control of the runaway race in nuclear arms.
[03:08:35.819 --> 03:08:38.460]  It took a president who understood what was going on.
[03:08:38.460 --> 03:08:41.522]  It took a president who understood the military-industrial complex.
[03:08:41.522 --> 03:08:43.963]  It was Eisenhower who warned us about that.
[03:08:43.963 --> 03:08:50.125]  And it was Eisenhower who fought against the scientists like Edward Teller who wanted to create the next bigger bomb.
[03:08:50.125 --> 03:08:53.447]  And these bombs were growing in their firepower exponentially.
[03:08:54.332 --> 03:09:07.822]  Looking at the book that we interviewed the author, Alex interviewed the author on Friday, The Pentagon's Brain, Annie Jacobson, a very good history, very compelling history, very entertaining history, quite frankly.
[03:09:07.822 --> 03:09:12.926]  I would highly recommend you get it because it fills in all of the details of what's going on.
[03:09:12.926 --> 03:09:19.972]  You need to educate yourself about what's going on because these struggles that we're going through today are essentially the same in principle.
[03:09:20.612 --> 03:09:22.595]  As the struggles that we've already gone through.
[03:09:22.595 --> 03:09:23.156]  The arms race.
[03:09:23.156 --> 03:09:25.499]  We see the revival of the Cold War, quite frankly.
[03:09:25.499 --> 03:09:28.364]  The military-industrial complex wants to sell these big-ticket items.
[03:09:28.364 --> 03:09:30.867]  One of these big-ticket items that's on the table right now.
[03:09:31.733 --> 03:09:33.013]  ...are killer robots.
[03:09:33.013 --> 03:09:35.894]  A very, very dangerous situation.
[03:09:35.894 --> 03:09:38.655]  As dangerous, I would say, as nuclear weapons.
[03:09:38.655 --> 03:09:42.817]  The potential for mass destruction, for gigadeth.
[03:09:42.817 --> 03:09:44.297]  We've interviewed Hugo de Garis.
[03:09:44.297 --> 03:09:48.659]  Remember the interview that we had with him, the artificial intelligence scientist?
[03:09:48.659 --> 03:09:51.680]  He talked about the artilect wars.
[03:09:51.680 --> 03:09:52.760]  What are the artilect wars?
[03:09:52.760 --> 03:09:55.281]  Well, the artificial intelligence wars.
[03:09:55.281 --> 03:10:00.383]  His idea being that once we had a understanding of
[03:10:01.471 --> 03:10:10.318]  Where this was headed, once the public understood where artificial intelligence, truly autonomous artificial intelligence, because there's different kinds of artificial intelligence.
[03:10:10.318 --> 03:10:25.511]  There's artificial intelligence that can, that has a limited scope, that basically can make heuristic decisions about certain things, draw conclusions, do it more quickly than humans can do it, but we're talking about generalized artificial intelligence.
[03:10:25.811 --> 03:10:31.033]  Artificial intelligence that can learn and think on its own, that has the potential to run away.
[03:10:31.033 --> 03:10:37.235]  The kind of artificial intelligence that was depicted in the Terminator series with Skynet.
[03:10:37.235 --> 03:10:40.776]  That's what we're looking at now in reality, people.
[03:10:40.776 --> 03:10:42.477]  This is not science fiction.
[03:10:42.477 --> 03:10:45.958]  And if you look at the history of DARPA, and look at how
[03:10:47.098 --> 03:11:02.854]  What these people were doing 60 years ago, working on EMP bombs, it's absolutely amazing to look at that history and to look at how they had to fight the scientists, the military-industrial complex, how Eisenhower had to do that to try to limit the expansion of nuclear war.
[03:11:03.715 --> 03:11:07.240]  They had gone from the atomic bomb, the fission bomb, to the fusion bomb.
[03:11:07.240 --> 03:11:09.643]  That's where her story really begins.
[03:11:09.643 --> 03:11:13.728]  And that was many orders of magnitude greater than the atomic bomb.
[03:11:13.728 --> 03:11:16.672]  And that wasn't good enough for Edward Teller and the other scientists.
[03:11:16.672 --> 03:11:22.038]  They were then looking at the super bomb, which they said could blow up an entire continent.
[03:11:22.725 --> 03:11:23.966]  Well, where are you going to test that?
[03:11:23.966 --> 03:11:27.070]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:11:27.070 --> 03:11:31.776]  Totally divorced from any reality or any sense of proportion.
[03:11:31.776 --> 03:11:38.503]  And at that point, Eisenhower, as well as even Khrushchev, were getting concerned about what their scientists were doing.
[03:11:38.503 --> 03:11:40.966]  So they enacted a test ban treaty.
[03:11:42.028 --> 03:11:44.692]  Trying to put a limit on this runaway expansion.
[03:11:44.692 --> 03:11:47.916]  Now we have the same thing happening with killer robots.
[03:11:47.916 --> 03:11:49.518]  We need to understand that.
[03:11:49.518 --> 03:11:53.563]  We don't have a leader with that kind of proportion, with that kind of sense.
[03:11:53.563 --> 03:11:55.786]  No one who will stand up to the military-industrial complex.
[03:11:55.786 --> 03:11:58.730]  Have you heard any questions about this in the presidential debates?
[03:11:58.730 --> 03:11:58.830]  No.
[03:11:59.704 --> 03:12:07.786]  Have you heard any questions about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its implications for our economy, for our legal system, for global governance?
[03:12:07.786 --> 03:12:08.246]  No.
[03:12:08.246 --> 03:12:09.087]  Not a single question.
[03:12:09.087 --> 03:12:13.648]  You're not going to hear that kind of question from Fox News or from CNN.
[03:12:13.648 --> 03:12:16.709]  Because they are part of the establishment.
[03:12:16.709 --> 03:12:18.369]  They want to see these things move forward.
[03:12:18.369 --> 03:12:20.670]  They want to see the TPP move forward.
[03:12:20.670 --> 03:12:25.211]  They don't want to put any obstacles in the way of the military-industrial complex or big pharmaceutical companies.
[03:12:25.811 --> 03:12:32.893]  So they are not asking the existential questions that affect not only our freedoms, but our lives.
[03:12:32.893 --> 03:12:35.153]  This is a very serious issue.
[03:12:35.153 --> 03:12:36.934]  We've talked to Noel Sharkey in the past.
[03:12:36.934 --> 03:12:39.974]  We've talked to Hugo deGarris, as I was saying in the last segment.
[03:12:39.974 --> 03:12:50.837]  Hugo deGarris said once people understood where artificial intelligence, generalized artificial intelligence, is going on, there would be a massive pushback by the population, if we can wake people up.
[03:12:50.837 --> 03:12:51.877]  He believes at that point,
[03:12:52.602 --> 03:13:01.049]  There will be a war between those who want to continue the Edward Tellers of our time, who want to continue with this no matter what.
[03:13:01.049 --> 03:13:12.799]  He called them the Cosmists because he thinks that they have a cosmic view, that they want to create the superintelligence, the gods in his words, that will replace us.
[03:13:13.860 --> 03:13:15.762]  And he, quite frankly, is on the fence with us.
[03:13:15.762 --> 03:13:18.744]  He doesn't really know where he is on either side of this.
[03:13:18.744 --> 03:13:34.116]  He presents both sides, and he has this ambivalence, because on the one hand, he thinks it's going to result in the extinction of the human race, and on the other hand, he would like to be the person who creates the gods who are above us, because I guess that makes him God, in some sense, in his mind.
[03:13:34.116 --> 03:13:35.377]  That's what we're looking at now.
[03:13:35.377 --> 03:13:39.461]  That's the kind of mentality that is running the military-industrial complex.
[03:13:40.618 --> 03:13:51.581]  One of the examples of where this will go in the near term, of course, are autonomous killing machines, autonomous weapons, killer robots that don't require human intervention in order to kill.
[03:13:51.581 --> 03:13:59.763]  Now, since we don't have a leader in the West who will stand up to the military-industrial complex, some people are trying to do this through the UN.
[03:14:00.501 --> 03:14:02.663]  I don't have much confidence in the UN.
[03:14:02.663 --> 03:14:04.745]  I don't think much is going to happen from that.
[03:14:04.745 --> 03:14:12.073]  I don't think that it's strong enough and I'm concerned about the concentration of power that would let them do something like this.
[03:14:12.073 --> 03:14:15.976]  But perhaps they can get people together of goodwill in different areas.
[03:14:15.976 --> 03:14:18.419]  That would be the best case scenario.
[03:14:18.419 --> 03:14:20.081]  I don't likely see that happening.
[03:14:20.081 --> 03:14:22.843]  Nevertheless, I stand with Noel Sharkey.
[03:14:23.832 --> 03:14:27.715]  And others who are on the International Committee for Robot Arms Control.
[03:14:27.715 --> 03:14:28.996]  Somebody needs to do with it.
[03:14:28.996 --> 03:14:35.780]  So, in this particular case, it's not a president who's coming out and trying to control this out-of-control military-industrial complex.
[03:14:35.780 --> 03:14:38.882]  This is essentially a grassroots movement of scientists.
[03:14:38.882 --> 03:14:43.505]  Perhaps something will happen if you, the people, will join them.
[03:14:43.505 --> 03:14:45.306]  We're not going to see this from our leaders.
[03:14:45.306 --> 03:14:48.448]  They are totally owned by the military-industrial complex.
[03:14:48.448 --> 03:14:51.731]  Just like we're not going to see them stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:14:51.731 --> 03:14:53.432]  And we're going to talk about that as well because
[03:14:54.452 --> 03:14:59.914]  We have a massive sea change that is happening right now in the House.
[03:14:59.914 --> 03:15:04.416]  It is very, very important who the Speaker of the House is.
[03:15:04.416 --> 03:15:07.798]  You understand the Speaker is third in line to the presidency.
[03:15:07.798 --> 03:15:10.839]  You understand the Speaker has control over
[03:15:11.656 --> 03:15:14.840]  Who gets to sit on which committees, which laws get introduced, and that sort of thing.
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:17.724]  That's why everyone was so concerned about John Boehner.
[03:15:17.724 --> 03:15:21.249]  That's why the pressure to get rid of John Boehner was brought up.
[03:15:21.249 --> 03:15:24.533]  Tonight, there's going to be a private meeting amongst congressmen.
[03:15:24.533 --> 03:15:28.318]  They're going to talk about who will be seceding John Boehner.
[03:15:29.159 --> 03:15:29.819]  It's very important.
[03:15:29.819 --> 03:15:32.761]  We only have three people that are going to be running for that office.
[03:15:32.761 --> 03:15:36.102]  We're going to break down a little bit their background.
[03:15:36.102 --> 03:15:39.203]  Unfortunately, there's not much to cheer about here.
[03:15:39.203 --> 03:15:40.504]  It's just like the presidential race.
[03:15:40.504 --> 03:15:43.305]  We don't have much of a choice, really.
[03:15:43.305 --> 03:15:53.789]  But we need to try to push for someone who is the least bad, or at least someone who is not just a new face being put on the same old policy.
[03:15:53.789 --> 03:15:58.491]  So we're going to talk about that as well as the corporations reacting to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:15:59.071 --> 03:16:03.593]  As well as what is going on, again, in the presidential race.
[03:16:03.593 --> 03:16:10.315]  But this is one of these issues, where I've said over and over again, I think that the presidential race, for the most part, is a distraction.
[03:16:10.315 --> 03:16:17.898]  It's to get us totally invested into these candidates, so that we don't get invested in issues.
[03:16:17.898 --> 03:16:20.439]  So we don't get invested in our local government.
[03:16:21.502 --> 03:16:33.530]  And one of the issues that we need to get invested in is we need to join with this grassroots movement of scientists who understand the danger of artificial intelligence, who understand the danger of killer robots.
[03:16:33.530 --> 03:16:38.353]  We, as a people, for our own survival, we have to get involved with these people.
[03:16:38.353 --> 03:16:43.056]  We have to support them because it isn't going to happen from some savior in Washington.
[03:16:43.056 --> 03:16:47.419]  None of these presidential candidates could care less about this, quite frankly.
[03:16:48.490 --> 03:16:50.010]  They're not talking about it.
[03:16:50.010 --> 03:16:53.251]  There's not going to be any questions asked in any of these presidential debates.
[03:16:53.251 --> 03:16:59.853]  I would venture to guess that most of these presidential candidates aren't even really aware of the issue.
[03:16:59.853 --> 03:17:02.254]  Let's take a look at this article that was on The Guardian today.
[03:17:02.254 --> 03:17:05.835]  UN delay could open the door to robot wars, say experts.
[03:17:05.835 --> 03:17:14.577]  Observers say the UK and the US are seeking to water down an agreement so that any autonomous weapons deployed before talks conclude will be beyond the reach of a ban.
[03:17:15.836 --> 03:17:17.757]  Understand how dangerous this is.
[03:17:17.757 --> 03:17:26.843]  Understand the plausible deniability that leaders would have if you just wipe out an entire area.
[03:17:26.843 --> 03:17:29.445]  They could say, well, you know, it was a software glitch.
[03:17:29.445 --> 03:17:30.405]  Sorry.
[03:17:30.405 --> 03:17:31.646]  Sorry.
[03:17:31.646 --> 03:17:32.367]  Mistakes were made.
[03:17:32.367 --> 03:17:35.249]  I'm not responsible for this.
[03:17:35.249 --> 03:17:40.232]  It allows them to distance themselves from mass murder and genocide.
[03:17:41.530 --> 03:17:45.351]  But it is also something that is very, very easy to get out of control.
[03:17:45.351 --> 03:17:50.612]  And as they say, once this genie is out of the bottle, it is going to be very difficult to put it back in.
[03:17:50.612 --> 03:17:52.493]  Here's the issue.
[03:17:52.493 --> 03:17:55.354]  We've already got some autonomous killing machines.
[03:17:55.354 --> 03:17:58.055]  We've got systems like the Phalanx system from the UK.
[03:17:58.055 --> 03:18:01.636]  We've got the Iron Dome that the United States has created.
[03:18:01.636 --> 03:18:02.836]  And these, when you look at them,
[03:18:03.812 --> 03:18:07.076]  Appear to be legitimate weapons and legitimate use.
[03:18:07.076 --> 03:18:18.030]  You have a situation in both of these cases where these are automated firing systems and that underscores the difficulty of discernment in this because there's a continuum of these weapons.
[03:18:19.056 --> 03:18:27.141]  These are automated firing systems that are meant to protect ships or local areas from incoming missiles, because humans can't react quickly enough.
[03:18:27.141 --> 03:18:33.765]  Humans can't shoot a moving target like a missile quickly enough, but they can't even react quickly enough.
[03:18:33.765 --> 03:18:41.409]  So they've created these defensive weapons, like the Phalanx, like the Iron Dome, to stop incoming missiles.
[03:18:41.409 --> 03:18:42.510]  But where does that end?
[03:18:43.550 --> 03:18:49.063]  In this story they're talking about how in South Korea they have some automated machine guns that are put...
[03:18:50.157 --> 03:18:58.482]  Over the demilitarized zone, and they say that it requires human intervention, but many people believe that it is automatically firing.
[03:18:58.482 --> 03:19:06.187]  We also have Israel deploying machine gun turrets along its border of the Gaza Strip to target Palestinian infiltrators automatically.
[03:19:06.187 --> 03:19:13.612]  So you see how it's going to gradually and incrementally move until you get something that is quite literally like the Terminator robot.
[03:19:14.471 --> 03:19:15.992]  That is where we're headed.
[03:19:15.992 --> 03:19:26.801]  You need to look at these videos that they put out of Boston Dynamics, now owned by Google, of other robotics companies, all now owned by Google.
[03:19:26.801 --> 03:19:37.970]  You need to take a look at these videos at the bipeds, at the quadrupeds, at the bug-like machines that are moving very rapidly, getting better all the time.
[03:19:37.970 --> 03:19:40.692]  You need to ask yourself where this is going.
[03:19:40.692 --> 03:19:42.854]  How are we going to get control of this?
[03:19:43.434 --> 03:19:45.457]  We have to get control of our government.
[03:19:45.457 --> 03:19:50.563]  We have to have people who are informed, who are going to act at the local level, who are going to contain this.
[03:19:50.563 --> 03:19:55.049]  And quite frankly, this is one of the most dangerous areas where it is getting out of control.
[03:19:55.049 --> 03:19:59.735]  When we come back, I want to talk to you, though, how our government is trying to get preschoolers to love robots.

[03:21:58.874 --> 03:22:09.784]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[03:22:13.948 --> 03:22:16.090]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:16.090 --> 03:22:21.575]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:21.715 --> 03:22:31.743]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.

[03:22:41.572 --> 03:22:43.654]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:22:43.654 --> 03:22:46.596]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:22:46.776 --> 03:22:49.257]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[03:22:58.600 --> 03:23:09.665]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[03:23:09.665 --> 03:23:13.386]  Fortunately, a simple, safe, and effective alternative exists.

[03:24:09.682 --> 03:24:11.043]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:11.043 --> 03:24:20.827]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to go back to talking about how they are using robots to accustom your children to loving robots.
[03:24:20.827 --> 03:24:23.808]  Loving their future masters, quite frankly.
[03:24:23.808 --> 03:24:25.609]  Their future task masters.
[03:24:25.609 --> 03:24:30.712]  Before we do, though, I want to tell you that we have a sale going on Prostagard at Infowarslife.com.
[03:24:30.712 --> 03:24:33.353]  We have 20% off Prostagard for this week only.

[03:25:01.820 --> 03:25:09.085]  Now, when we were talking about robots and the killer robots, and of course that is the end game with this if we don't control this.
[03:25:09.085 --> 03:25:16.810]  If we don't get control of our politicians, control of our government, control of our military spending, that's where we're headed, folks.
[03:25:16.810 --> 03:25:19.992]  But there's also other areas that we're concerned about, of course, with robots.
[03:25:19.992 --> 03:25:24.235]  We've talked many times about how they are going to create massive unemployment.
[03:25:24.235 --> 03:25:26.956]  It's not just replacing and automating one industry.
[03:25:26.956 --> 03:25:28.678]  It's going to be across the board.
[03:25:29.551 --> 03:25:31.292]  Every industry is going to be hit.
[03:25:31.292 --> 03:25:38.756]  It's not going to be like we've had in the past, where farms are automated so people move to the cities to work in factories, that type of thing.
[03:25:38.756 --> 03:25:40.357]  We had the Industrial Revolution.
[03:25:40.357 --> 03:25:46.460]  No, this is going to be a revolution that is going to affect jobs at every strata of society.
[03:25:46.460 --> 03:25:47.601]  Every strata.
[03:25:47.601 --> 03:25:50.222]  We're looking at unemployment figures of 30 to 50 percent.
[03:25:51.843 --> 03:25:55.505]  Many in the transportation industry will be the first ones to be hit.
[03:25:55.505 --> 03:25:58.226]  But we have to get accustomed to this, don't we?
[03:25:58.226 --> 03:26:00.047]  That's what the elites believe.
[03:26:00.047 --> 03:26:01.427]  They think that we have to get accustomed to this.
[03:26:01.427 --> 03:26:08.490]  So they're spending $440,000 for robots to tell preschoolers stories.
[03:26:08.490 --> 03:26:09.831]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:26:09.831 --> 03:26:12.252]  You know, you could have a human read stories to them.
[03:26:12.252 --> 03:26:18.975]  You could even have recordings and computer images, if you wanted to, of the story that you could read to the kids.
[03:26:19.875 --> 03:26:22.676]  But they want to have the robots do that.
[03:26:22.676 --> 03:26:23.876]  I think that's very telling.
[03:26:23.876 --> 03:26:27.297]  This is coming, of course, from the National Science Foundation.
[03:26:27.297 --> 03:26:34.779]  They are seeking to, quote, push the envelope of normal storytelling that is aimed at four-year-olds.
[03:26:34.779 --> 03:26:39.680]  Understand, that's where you adjust society for the next generation.
[03:26:40.140 --> 03:26:43.021]  They always want to get a hold of the children at a very early age.
[03:26:43.021 --> 03:26:45.361]  They want to separate them from their family.
[03:26:45.361 --> 03:26:49.162]  They want to condition them for the type of society that they want to do in the future.
[03:26:49.162 --> 03:26:54.023]  That's what social engineers have done all the way back to the time of Plato.
[03:26:54.023 --> 03:27:00.944]  In Plato's Republic, he said, we want them to have no mother and father but the state.
[03:27:00.944 --> 03:27:03.824]  We want the children to not know who their mothers and fathers are.
[03:27:03.824 --> 03:27:05.585]  They have all of their allegiance to the state.
[03:27:05.585 --> 03:27:07.025]  The state is their family.
[03:27:07.025 --> 03:27:07.225]  Well,
[03:27:08.018 --> 03:27:11.879]  They can also have the robots be the face of the state.
[03:27:11.879 --> 03:27:17.841]  They say that these robots are unique because they can play, they can learn, they can engage with children in the real world.
[03:27:17.841 --> 03:27:20.581]  You know what we used to call that?
[03:27:20.581 --> 03:27:21.902]  Parents.
[03:27:21.902 --> 03:27:23.542]  We used to call it parents.
[03:27:23.542 --> 03:27:27.743]  There used to be these beings that would play, learn, and engage with their children in the real world.
[03:27:27.743 --> 03:27:30.804]  They were called mom and dad.
[03:27:30.804 --> 03:27:33.065]  But those terms are being banned.
[03:27:33.065 --> 03:27:35.726]  We don't want our children to interact with people.
[03:27:35.726 --> 03:27:36.746]  We want them to interact with
[03:27:37.699 --> 03:27:45.602]  With these faceless individuals, perhaps it's people that they're interacting with, maybe it's a bot that they're interacting with on social media.
[03:27:45.602 --> 03:27:46.062]  Who knows?
[03:27:46.062 --> 03:27:48.503]  You never know who you're talking to on social media.
[03:27:48.503 --> 03:27:56.425]  But now, if it's something physical, tangible for these four-year-olds, we want them to be interacting literally with robots.
[03:27:56.425 --> 03:28:05.148]  They say, such robots offer unique opportunities of guided, personalized, and controlled social interaction during the delivery of desired curriculum.
[03:28:05.148 --> 03:28:06.169]  See, it's not just enough
[03:28:06.829 --> 03:28:11.513]  For them to manipulate our children with the curriculum that they teach them.
[03:28:11.513 --> 03:28:16.397]  They have to also have a controlled social interaction.
[03:28:16.397 --> 03:28:18.379]  That's their words for it.
[03:28:18.379 --> 03:28:27.867]  Quite frankly, I look at this and we need to, at the grassroots level, as I said, you have to stand up for your freedoms and you have to take them individually.
[03:28:28.601 --> 03:28:31.487]  The first thing you do is take care of your family.
[03:28:31.487 --> 03:28:34.292]  Get them out of the schools.
[03:28:34.292 --> 03:28:36.477]  Get them away from these social engineers.
[03:28:36.477 --> 03:28:38.441]  And that could mean a private school as well.
[03:28:38.441 --> 03:28:40.224]  Start your own private school with other friends.
[03:28:41.044 --> 03:28:49.827]  If they won't let you because of political situations, if they put restraints on how you can educate your children, then get involved in local office and remove those constraints.
[03:28:49.827 --> 03:28:51.888]  But you have to protect your children.
[03:28:51.888 --> 03:29:02.072]  You have to understand, as many have been telling you over the decades, back in the 1980s we had Charlotte Isserby with Phyllis Schlafly talking about the deliberate dumbing down of America.
[03:29:02.492 --> 03:29:07.157]  The manipulation of our children, making sure that they were not independent thinkers.
[03:29:07.157 --> 03:29:12.102]  That was always the goal of education, with liberal education, to make independent thinkers.
[03:29:12.102 --> 03:29:14.084]  That's not what they want.
[03:29:14.084 --> 03:29:15.625]  These are social engineers.
[03:29:16.482 --> 03:29:28.473]  These are people who, like the utopian societies in the mid-1800s, were concerned because they weren't having these utopian communist societies were failing in Oneida and other places.
[03:29:28.473 --> 03:29:32.056]  So they said, we need to separate the children from their parents.
[03:29:32.056 --> 03:29:36.720]  Precisely the same conclusion that tyrants throughout history have had, and that's the way they're doing it.
[03:29:36.720 --> 03:29:37.621]  Stay with us when we come back.
[03:29:37.621 --> 03:29:42.305]  We're going to talk about the TPP as well as the change in the House leadership.
[03:29:42.305 --> 03:29:42.826]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:48.194 --> 03:29:52.124]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.124 --> 03:29:54.810]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.914 --> 03:30:02.838]  Airstrikes are not always the surgical maneuvers people envision.
[03:30:02.838 --> 03:30:08.243]  Innocent civilians have been killed in another botched raid, this time in Afghanistan.
[03:30:08.243 --> 03:30:15.990]  The Washington Post reports of the 19 killed, three were children, with the UN calling the strike an inexcusable war crime.
[03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:22.596]  Doctors Without Borders states that while militants had recently entered the area, none were used in the hospital for offensive measures.
[03:30:22.816 --> 03:30:26.577]  Contrast that with the bombing leaving patients burning in their beds.
[03:30:26.577 --> 03:30:35.419]  Add this to the famous story of the wedding that became a funeral in Yemen, where 12 people died after an attacking drone confused the party for another group.
[03:30:35.419 --> 03:30:42.161]  Other reports from January of this year show the deaths of two hostages, including an American citizen in a U.S.
[03:30:42.161 --> 03:30:48.782]  drone strike, and the father who had his children shot at for trying to save a camera crew who had been mistaken for terrorists.
[03:30:48.782 --> 03:30:52.303]  Will this be another example of the military going unaccountable?
[03:30:52.623 --> 03:30:53.727]  Only time will tell.

[03:31:18.076 --> 03:31:19.677]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[03:31:19.677 --> 03:31:24.840]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.

[03:31:44.321 --> 03:31:48.363]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:48.363 --> 03:31:52.545]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:32:07.073 --> 03:32:07.353]  I don't know.
[03:32:28.419 --> 03:32:29.519]  BrainForce is here.
[03:32:29.519 --> 03:32:31.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:31.740 --> 03:32:36.721]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:32:36.721 --> 03:32:38.421]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[03:32:38.421 --> 03:32:40.022]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:40.022 --> 03:32:43.503]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:43.503 --> 03:32:45.483]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:45.483 --> 03:32:46.403]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:32:46.403 --> 03:32:47.584]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:32:47.584 --> 03:32:49.584]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[03:33:01.644 --> 03:33:08.267]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:08.267 --> 03:33:15.570]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:15.570 --> 03:33:17.271]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.271 --> 03:33:19.112]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:33:19.112 --> 03:33:21.172]  We have an article up on Infowars.com.
[03:33:21.172 --> 03:33:24.594]  Homeland Security detains Stockton Mayor.
[03:33:24.594 --> 03:33:27.015]  Forces him to hand over his passwords.
[03:33:28.430 --> 03:33:33.260]  This is a very interesting story because there's a number of aspects of this that I think are important.
[03:33:33.260 --> 03:33:39.132]  First of all, the fact that we still have local people that are close enough to us like mayors.
[03:33:40.080 --> 03:33:43.022]  That they are treated like we're treated.
[03:33:43.022 --> 03:33:47.325]  That they are outraged by this kind of treatment, like we are outraged by this kind of treatment.
[03:33:47.325 --> 03:33:50.707]  That is where our hope lies, at the local level.
[03:33:50.707 --> 03:33:53.008]  You're not going to find any salvation with a president.
[03:33:53.008 --> 03:33:54.049]  They're too far away from you.
[03:33:54.049 --> 03:33:55.150]  They're too distant from you.
[03:33:55.150 --> 03:33:56.691]  They're too far above you.
[03:33:56.691 --> 03:33:59.553]  They have a completely different level of concern.
[03:33:59.553 --> 03:34:00.413]  They don't live with you.
[03:34:02.294 --> 03:34:03.135]  Local.
[03:34:03.135 --> 03:34:05.215]  It needs to be at the level where you are.
[03:34:05.215 --> 03:34:11.638]  That's where you can control it, and that's where you can have people that are not so far removed from the population.
[03:34:11.638 --> 03:34:12.959]  Listen to what he suffered.
[03:34:12.959 --> 03:34:17.361]  Now, this is Stockton, California, Mayor Anthony R. Silver.
[03:34:17.361 --> 03:34:20.262]  He attended a recent mayor's conference in China.
[03:34:20.942 --> 03:34:24.963]  Now, coming back from China, he was amazed at how he was treated in San Francisco.
[03:34:24.963 --> 03:34:30.945]  They say, at the San Francisco International Airport, agents with Homeland Security detained him, detained the mayor.
[03:34:30.945 --> 03:34:35.246]  They confiscated his personal cell phone, along with other electronics.
[03:34:35.246 --> 03:34:43.648]  He said, unfortunately, they were not willing or able to produce a search warrant or any court documents suggesting that they had a legal right to take my property.
[03:34:44.008 --> 03:34:45.729]  He told the San Francisco gate.
[03:34:45.729 --> 03:34:51.832]  He said, in addition, they were persistent about requiring my passwords for all devices.
[03:34:51.832 --> 03:34:59.357]  The mayor's attorney told the San Francisco gate that the mayor was not allowed to leave the airport without forfeiting his passwords.
[03:35:00.168 --> 03:35:03.389]  The attorney was not present for his interaction with Homeland Security agents either.
[03:35:03.389 --> 03:35:08.570]  The mayor was told that he had, quote, no right for a lawyer to be present and that being a U.S.
[03:35:08.570 --> 03:35:15.132]  citizen did not, quote, entitle me to any rights that I probably thought I had.
[03:35:15.132 --> 03:35:16.932]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:35:16.932 --> 03:35:17.712]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:35:17.712 --> 03:35:19.273]  A wake-up call for the mayor.
[03:35:20.401 --> 03:35:25.308]  You know, we had a wake-up call a few years ago when they started rolling this out very quickly.
[03:35:25.308 --> 03:35:29.754]  Now we've been normalized to that, okay?
[03:35:29.754 --> 03:35:33.859]  We now have come to accept that as the status quo in our minds.
[03:35:34.704 --> 03:35:51.933]  But in Texas, we had David Simpson who led a revolt against the sexual molestation of minors by Homeland Security by the idea that they should be able to put their hands on us so that we would have to demonstrate to them our innocence before we were allowed to move about in our country.
[03:35:51.933 --> 03:35:58.416]  We had a law that was passed unanimously in the State House that said that they would not be allowed to do that.
[03:35:59.440 --> 03:36:04.102]  At that time, the TSA pushed back very strongly and said, we're going to turn Texas into a no-fly zone.
[03:36:04.102 --> 03:36:27.194]  We later learned, in a lawsuit by John Corbett, when the TSA mistakenly published on Pacer.gov an unredacted copy of some of their communications, we learned that they said at the time, the very same time they were threatening to turn Texas into a no-fly zone, they said in their own documents, there is no threat against airports or airplanes.
[03:36:28.100 --> 03:36:34.284]  And we quite frankly know because of their lax methods and as security experts have pointed out, it is nothing but theater.
[03:36:34.284 --> 03:36:38.227]  If there really were a threat, we would have had many incidents at this point in time.
[03:36:38.227 --> 03:36:40.128]  But we haven't because there isn't a threat.
[03:36:40.128 --> 03:36:41.709]  They knew there wasn't a threat.
[03:36:41.709 --> 03:36:45.312]  And the mayor goes on to say, as I was being searched at the airport,
[03:36:45.772 --> 03:36:50.516]  There was a Latino couple to my left, an Asian couple to my right, also being aggressively searched.
[03:36:50.516 --> 03:36:59.143]  I briefly had to remind myself that this was not North Korea or Nazi Germany, that this is the land of the free.
[03:36:59.143 --> 03:37:00.404]  Is it really?
[03:37:00.404 --> 03:37:00.925]  Is it really?
[03:37:00.925 --> 03:37:02.586]  Or have we become slaves?
[03:37:02.586 --> 03:37:08.851]  Have we adopted the mindset of the people who lived in East Germany?
[03:37:08.851 --> 03:37:11.713]  The see something, say something, let's tattle on everybody?
[03:37:12.654 --> 03:37:18.518]  Have we come to accept this, that we're going to give up our freedom for the promise of security?
[03:37:18.518 --> 03:37:25.443]  As I've said many times, you give up your freedom for security, slaves are never secure.
[03:37:25.443 --> 03:37:27.244]  Slaves are never safe.
[03:37:27.244 --> 03:37:28.986]  Slaves are never rich.
[03:37:28.986 --> 03:37:34.249]  When you give up your liberty, you have no hope of obtaining safety or security.
[03:37:34.249 --> 03:37:37.251]  Understand that this is for their safety from you.
[03:37:38.723 --> 03:37:41.064]  And we cannot tolerate this.
[03:37:41.064 --> 03:37:45.767]  We need to get more people in office who are outraged by being treated like this.
[03:37:45.767 --> 03:37:47.207]  You need to be outraged.
[03:37:47.207 --> 03:37:58.974]  When I go to the airport, I see people just willingly going through whatever process the TSA tells them to go through and not trying to shut the system down in any way whatsoever.
[03:37:58.974 --> 03:38:00.534]  Tell them that you want to opt out.
[03:38:00.534 --> 03:38:01.055]  Shut it down.
[03:38:01.835 --> 03:38:04.556]  Shut the system down if you have enough people that'll do that.
[03:38:04.556 --> 03:38:06.596]  I also do not want to, I don't like to fly.
[03:38:06.596 --> 03:38:07.437]  It's not my choice.
[03:38:07.437 --> 03:38:09.817]  I have to do it because of work.
[03:38:09.817 --> 03:38:13.799]  But I don't want to be forced to have to not fly anymore.
[03:38:13.799 --> 03:38:16.139]  I'm not going to let them take that over from me.
[03:38:16.139 --> 03:38:18.600]  I understand people boycotting it and I think that's a great thing.
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:21.681]  I think we need to make the airlines feel some economic pressure.
[03:38:21.681 --> 03:38:24.842]  But I also don't want to allow them to completely shut me down.
[03:38:26.195 --> 03:38:30.798]  Now, in terms of shutting us down, look at this story on Infowars.com.
[03:38:30.798 --> 03:38:35.341]  The Washington Post editor says, repeat after me, I want a gun-free society.
[03:38:35.341 --> 03:38:36.982]  And this is what he has in his story.
[03:38:36.982 --> 03:38:39.323]  He says, imagine prohibition.
[03:38:39.323 --> 03:38:41.565]  Imagine a mass buyback.
[03:38:41.565 --> 03:38:44.347]  Imagine a gun-free society.
[03:38:44.347 --> 03:38:48.890]  He says those three words, prohibition, mass buyback, and a gun-free society.
[03:38:48.890 --> 03:38:52.632]  He says the NRA has rendered those as to be unmentionable.
[03:38:52.632 --> 03:38:54.473]  No, it's not the NRA, folks.
[03:38:54.473 --> 03:38:55.394]  It's the Constitution.
[03:38:56.530 --> 03:39:00.512]  When you talk about prohibition, let's talk about the major prohibitions that we've had in this country.
[03:39:00.512 --> 03:39:02.894]  Let's talk about alcohol prohibition.
[03:39:02.894 --> 03:39:04.935]  Was that a success?
[03:39:04.935 --> 03:39:06.096]  No.
[03:39:06.096 --> 03:39:08.097]  It was an outright failure.
[03:39:08.097 --> 03:39:09.798]  What happened during prohibition?
[03:39:09.798 --> 03:39:12.280]  We had a massive increase in organized crime.
[03:39:12.280 --> 03:39:14.581]  We had a massive corruption of the government.
[03:39:14.581 --> 03:39:17.223]  We had violence in the streets like we'd never had before.
[03:39:18.496 --> 03:39:23.241]  And we had an increase in the concentration of alcohol.
[03:39:23.241 --> 03:39:23.742]  And you know what?
[03:39:23.742 --> 03:39:27.546]  The same things have happened with the war on drugs.
[03:39:27.546 --> 03:39:34.453]  But here's the fundamental difference between the war on drugs and the failed experiment with prohibition that only lasted a few years.
[03:39:35.421 --> 03:39:41.987]  When we had the prohibition experiment, we actually changed the Constitution because there is no authority to prohibit alcohol.
[03:39:41.987 --> 03:39:45.990]  There's no authority for the federal government to prohibit marijuana or anything else.
[03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:47.131]  That's not in the Constitution.
[03:39:47.131 --> 03:39:50.013]  As a matter of fact, they're specifically prohibited from doing that.
[03:39:50.013 --> 03:39:59.461]  The Ninth and Tenth Amendments say, if you do not have, if you've not been given express authority in these areas, it remains to the people and to the states.
[03:40:00.422 --> 03:40:05.443]  And that's why they passed the 18th Amendment and then the 21st Amendment to undo prohibition.
[03:40:05.443 --> 03:40:08.985]  But when it came to prohibiting drugs, we just ignored the Constitution.
[03:40:08.985 --> 03:40:15.386]  And so now we're at the point where the Washington Post wants to come out and turn this all upside down.
[03:40:15.386 --> 03:40:22.268]  They want to prohibit something that is expressly permitted and protected by the Constitution.
[03:40:22.268 --> 03:40:24.489]  You understand how criminal this is.
[03:40:24.489 --> 03:40:27.390]  And of course, this is the Washington Post pushing this.
[03:40:28.444 --> 03:40:32.069]  This is why Matt Drudge has been so important.
[03:40:32.069 --> 03:40:45.087]  He was here earlier today, and Matt Drudge has allowed us to transcend the controlled media, like this Washington Post editor Fred Hyatt, who says he wants gun prohibition, he wants a gun-free society.
[03:40:46.417 --> 03:40:48.558]  I don't really care what he wants.
[03:40:48.558 --> 03:40:53.881]  We have a constitution, and we're going to fight for that constitution, and you're not going to change that constitution.
[03:40:53.881 --> 03:41:00.164]  We have put up with, and I can't understand why people put up with the government prohibiting things that it doesn't have the authority to prohibit.
[03:41:00.164 --> 03:41:01.985]  Cancer drugs, marijuana, whatever.
[03:41:01.985 --> 03:41:07.789]  The FDA should not be able to turn this into a situation where everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted.
[03:41:07.789 --> 03:41:13.572]  But you understand how they have normalized us to that mentality, just like they've normalized us to the TSA.
[03:41:14.312 --> 03:41:16.255]  Now they want to go to the next level.
[03:41:16.255 --> 03:41:30.973]  They want to say that things that are specifically prohibited for the government to do, and that is to infringe our right to self-protection, our right to protect the nation from foreign invaders with an armed militia, they want to say that they're going to just ignore that.
[03:41:32.136 --> 03:41:46.281]  Obama has been floating the idea of gun prohibition, making references this weekend to Australia and the UK, saying they're places where we've just gotten rid of guns, because they understand that it isn't having any effect when they pass these gun laws.
[03:41:46.281 --> 03:41:50.462]  None of these gun laws, background checks, none of this stuff is effective.
[03:41:50.462 --> 03:41:54.204]  Because criminals are going to get their guns, just like criminals get their drugs everywhere.
[03:41:54.204 --> 03:41:59.906]  You can't lock people up in jail and keep them from overdosing on drugs in a federal jail.
[03:42:00.726 --> 03:42:02.387]  That's just reality.
[03:42:02.387 --> 03:42:03.507]  You need to understand that.
[03:42:03.507 --> 03:42:05.808]  Prohibition doesn't work.
[03:42:05.808 --> 03:42:08.429]  And they don't have the legal authority for it anyway.
[03:42:08.429 --> 03:42:12.110]  But it's not just Obama, but now we see the Washington Post is coming out with this.
[03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:20.374]  We also have a professor at Georgetown University who is a government and law professor who is also saying the very same thing on the very same day.
[03:42:20.374 --> 03:42:24.475]  So now they say, well, you know, these gun laws didn't work, so we just need outright prohibition.
[03:42:24.475 --> 03:42:25.495]  You know what?
[03:42:25.495 --> 03:42:29.277]  Outright prohibition isn't going to work either for the same reason the gun laws don't work.
[03:42:30.327 --> 03:42:35.752]  But of course, we're going to be propagandized endlessly by the Washington Post.
[03:42:35.752 --> 03:42:38.755]  And that's why you need alternative media.
[03:42:38.755 --> 03:42:40.897]  That's why we put together this piece.
[03:42:40.897 --> 03:42:43.279]  I think it was about a year ago that Darren McBrain put this piece together.
[03:42:43.279 --> 03:42:54.328]  At the time that the Pentagon came out and there was that press conference that surfaced, and this one young officer said to the officer that was briefing the group, she said, nobody believes us.
[03:42:55.174 --> 03:42:55.534]  Anymore.
[03:42:55.534 --> 03:43:08.979]  They just think it's outright propaganda and lies and they were going back and forth and saying, yeah, you know, people can go to the Dredge Report and they can go to directly to the sources and they're bypassing us and we just don't have the kind of control we had anymore.
[03:43:08.979 --> 03:43:13.240]  The kind of control that they're trying to exercise to the Washington Post.
[03:43:13.240 --> 03:43:14.481]  And by the way, when you look at that article,
[03:43:15.021 --> 03:43:23.666]  There's a picture of Jeff Bezos on there, that we have up there, because Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon, also owns the Washington Post.
[03:43:23.666 --> 03:43:26.408]  So just keep that in mind when you do your shopping, okay?
[03:43:26.408 --> 03:43:27.829]  Talk about boycotts or whatever.
[03:43:27.829 --> 03:43:29.870]  I mean, just understand what you're feeding.
[03:43:29.870 --> 03:43:33.192]  And I understand, I still get stuff from Amazon.
[03:43:33.192 --> 03:43:37.715]  I get books from Amazon, like audiobooks, like the one I'm listening to about the Pentagon's brain.
[03:43:38.115 --> 03:43:47.578]  But just understand that all of these guys, people like Jeff Bezos, he goes to the Bilderberg Group, he buys the Washington Post because he wants political clout in Washington.
[03:43:47.578 --> 03:43:50.059]  And what is he using that political clout for right now?
[03:43:50.059 --> 03:43:54.960]  Well, he's using that political clout to try to call for outright gun prohibition.
[03:43:54.960 --> 03:44:01.742]  And again, as I said, that's why it's so important for us to be able to transcend the controlled media.
[03:44:02.932 --> 03:44:08.315]  We did a report, Darren McBreen put this together, a lot of clips, how Matt Drudge changed the world.
[03:44:08.315 --> 03:44:12.057]  I want to play a little bit of that for you right now.
[03:44:12.057 --> 03:44:21.662]  It's been more than 16 years since Matt Drudge gave his historic speech at the National Press Club on June 2nd, 1998.
[03:44:21.662 --> 03:44:31.268]  At that time, he said that the mainstream media would go bankrupt, that individual bloggers and researchers on the internet were just as important as the New York Times.
[03:44:32.128 --> 03:44:44.352]  The controlled state-run media had a field day making fun of Matt Drudge, but today their hubris has drained away and they're no longer as arrogant as they once were.
[03:44:44.352 --> 03:44:59.878]  Now we see calls for the FCC to regulate print news and online news, and we see establishment publications like Time Magazine, Newsweek, and the New York Times battling to keep from going completely bankrupt and imploding.
[03:45:00.558 --> 03:45:07.763]  It turns out, pretty much everything that Matt Drudge said in that 40-minute speech has now come true.
[03:45:07.763 --> 03:45:13.427]  Well, Matt Drudge is saying a lot of things today that the mainstream media is still laughing at.
[03:45:13.427 --> 03:45:17.710]  Why do they laugh at people that have been proven right over and over again?
[03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:22.513]  Here are some of the most important moments, in my view, from Drudge's speech.
[03:45:22.513 --> 03:45:28.697]  And we're also adding headlines from over the years to show just how much of what he had to say came true.
[03:45:32.122 --> 03:45:40.461]  This marks the first time that an individual has access to the news wires outside of a newsroom.
[03:45:42.523 --> 03:45:52.930]  You get to read all the news from the Associated Press, UPI, Reuters, to the Morrocan Agency French Press and the Genois.
[03:45:52.930 --> 03:45:56.772]  I'm a personal fan of the Genois Press.
[03:45:56.772 --> 03:46:03.476]  And time was, only newsrooms had access to the full pictures of the day's events.
[03:46:03.476 --> 03:46:06.799]  But now any citizen does.
[03:46:06.799 --> 03:46:11.682]  We get to see the kinds of cuts that are made for all kinds of reasons.
[03:46:12.964 --> 03:46:23.714]  Endless layers of editors with endless agendas changing bits and pieces so by the time the newspaper hits your welcome mat, it had no meaning.
[03:46:23.714 --> 03:46:28.659]  Now with a modem, anyone can follow the world and report on the world.
[03:46:28.659 --> 03:46:30.801]  No middleman, no big brother.
[03:46:33.107 --> 03:46:34.848]  And I guess this changes everything.
[03:46:34.848 --> 03:46:43.512]  More than 10 years after breaking the Clinton-Lewinsky story, Matt Drudge remains more powerful than ever with his website, thedrudgereport.com.
[03:46:43.512 --> 03:46:45.813]  Matt Drudge is a legend on the internet.
[03:46:45.813 --> 03:46:50.236]  Every journalist and politician in America reads his website on a daily basis.
[03:46:50.236 --> 03:46:52.557]  When radio lost out to television,
[03:46:54.167 --> 03:46:56.469]  There was anxiety.
[03:46:56.469 --> 03:47:06.058]  The people in the radio business were absolutely anxious and demanded government stop the upcoming television wave.
[03:47:06.058 --> 03:47:11.723]  Television was very nervous about other mediums coming forward.
[03:47:11.723 --> 03:47:13.885]  Cable.
[03:47:13.885 --> 03:47:19.470]  The movies didn't want sitcoms to be taped at movie studios for fear it would take away from the movies.
[03:47:20.894 --> 03:47:21.715]  No.
[03:47:21.715 --> 03:47:23.496]  Television saved the movies.
[03:47:23.496 --> 03:47:29.640]  The internet is going to save the news business.
[03:47:29.640 --> 03:47:33.002]  I envision a future where there will be 300 million reporters.
[03:47:35.512 --> 03:47:38.995]  Where anyone from anywhere can report for any reason.
[03:47:38.995 --> 03:47:42.217]  It's freedom of participation absolutely realized.
[03:47:42.217 --> 03:47:46.541]  First of all, you disrespected me, this badge, and my department.
[03:47:46.541 --> 03:47:47.442]  You understand me?
[03:47:47.442 --> 03:47:51.025]  When I'm talking to you, you shut your mouth and you listen.
[03:47:51.025 --> 03:47:52.466]  Did I not give you a warning?
[03:47:52.466 --> 03:47:53.607]  You gave me a warning.
[03:47:53.607 --> 03:47:55.248]  I have a right in the United States.
[03:47:55.248 --> 03:47:56.309]  I know my rights.
[03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:57.029]  I don't care.
[03:47:57.029 --> 03:47:58.871]  I don't care.
[03:47:58.871 --> 03:47:59.892]  You mean the board.
[03:47:59.892 --> 03:48:03.414]  Obviously, your parents don't put a foot in your butt quite enough.
[03:48:03.414 --> 03:48:05.176]  Because you don't understand the meaning of respect.
[03:48:08.075 --> 03:48:09.175]  You see this?
[03:48:09.175 --> 03:48:10.356]  Yes, you see this.
[03:48:10.356 --> 03:48:11.556]  I took the void.
[03:48:11.556 --> 03:48:12.916]  You have a problem with it?
[03:48:12.916 --> 03:48:14.017]  I have a problem.
[03:48:14.017 --> 03:48:15.277]  Then bring your parents down.
[03:48:15.277 --> 03:48:17.238]  We'll discuss this.
[03:48:17.238 --> 03:48:18.138]  Go for it.
[03:48:18.138 --> 03:48:22.159]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of care?
[03:48:22.159 --> 03:48:25.180]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[03:48:25.840 --> 03:48:26.221]  Really?
[03:48:26.221 --> 03:48:27.081]  That's right.
[03:48:27.081 --> 03:48:29.684]  Well, I'm Alex Jones and I snuck in there in 2000.
[03:48:29.684 --> 03:48:31.906]  I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the video.
[03:48:31.906 --> 03:48:33.228]  It's been on national TV.
[03:48:33.228 --> 03:48:35.009]  Well, I disrespect you for that.
[03:48:35.009 --> 03:48:35.470]  You do?
[03:48:35.470 --> 03:48:35.730]  I do.
[03:48:35.730 --> 03:48:37.612]  But it's a lot of big public officials.
[03:48:37.612 --> 03:48:46.521]  Now that's Alex Jones in the early days talking to David Gergen, a regular attendee at the Bilderberg conference about the cremation of care.
[03:48:46.521 --> 03:48:49.324]  And that's precisely what Drudge was talking about.
[03:48:49.884 --> 03:48:53.507]  About citizen journalists and about the internet transcending that.
[03:48:53.507 --> 03:48:56.129]  If you want to see the rest of that report, it's about 15 minutes.
[03:48:56.129 --> 03:48:58.390]  It's how Matt Drudge changed the world.
[03:48:58.390 --> 03:48:59.351]  It's on our YouTube channel.
[03:48:59.351 --> 03:49:03.474]  We'll probably put that link up again on our site at InfoWars.
[03:49:03.474 --> 03:49:14.242]  I'm sure there'll be a clip there from Matt Drudge being in the studio talking to Alex Jones earlier today about the state of our society, what's going on in our government.
[03:49:14.242 --> 03:49:17.024]  Very interesting talk that Matt Drudge had.
[03:49:17.024 --> 03:49:18.545]  It was amazing to see him.
[03:49:19.445 --> 03:49:26.612]  Tonight we're going to have a meeting, a private meeting, on the House and the Congress.
[03:49:26.612 --> 03:49:28.634]  They're going to be talking about who the next Speaker is going to be.
[03:49:28.634 --> 03:49:35.901]  And I want to give you a little bit of background to these guys, because there's a lot of very important things that are coming up.
[03:49:35.901 --> 03:49:39.285]  And the Speaker has a tremendous amount of power.
[03:49:39.285 --> 03:49:43.269]  Everybody is focused on the presidential race, but this is something that's going to happen right now.
[03:49:44.488 --> 03:49:49.111]  And it's something that you can still influence by calling some of your congressmen.
[03:49:49.111 --> 03:49:52.614]  Now, who are these players that are setting up to replace John Boehner?
[03:49:52.614 --> 03:49:58.338]  First of all, we had Kevin McCarthy, and he was essentially the establishment choice.
[03:49:58.338 --> 03:50:01.901]  And then on Wednesday, he went on the Sean Hannity Show, and he made some comments.
[03:50:01.901 --> 03:50:04.403]  He said, I put together the Benghazi investigation.
[03:50:04.403 --> 03:50:07.165]  Look at her poll numbers now.
[03:50:07.165 --> 03:50:09.106]  Well, the Democrats were outraged.
[03:50:09.106 --> 03:50:10.227]  They said, look at this!
[03:50:10.227 --> 03:50:12.689]  It just shows that Benghazi was completely political.
[03:50:13.783 --> 03:50:14.864]  You know what?
[03:50:14.864 --> 03:50:16.124]  I agree with him.
[03:50:16.124 --> 03:50:20.906]  I agree that the Benghazi investigation was completely political.
[03:50:20.906 --> 03:50:31.612]  The only thing that the Boehner Republicans and people like Kevin McCarthy, who was trying to take Boehner's place, wanted to do out of that was to score some cheap political shots at Hillary Clinton.
[03:50:32.432 --> 03:50:33.713]  And they're exactly right.
[03:50:33.713 --> 03:50:43.119]  It's not right to say that there wasn't any criminal action with Benghazi, that there wasn't any criminal action with the emails, that there weren't issues where Obama should have been impeached.
[03:50:43.119 --> 03:50:54.867]  But we've seen over and over again that the establishment GOP leadership has merely taken the opportunity to engrandize themselves politically, but they will never purge the corruption.
[03:50:54.867 --> 03:50:58.890]  They own it, they want to be part of it, they want to have that power when they take the reign.
[03:50:58.890 --> 03:50:59.871]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:02.352 --> 03:51:06.833]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:06.833 --> 03:51:08.514]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:08.514 --> 03:51:10.034]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:10.034 --> 03:51:11.955]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:11.955 --> 03:51:13.535]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:13.535 --> 03:51:15.376]  Well, I've been taking ExtendoVite.
[03:51:15.376 --> 03:51:17.136]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:17.136 --> 03:51:18.177]  ExtendoVite?
[03:51:18.177 --> 03:51:19.057]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:19.915 --> 03:51:21.276]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:21.276 --> 03:51:25.098]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:25.098 --> 03:51:25.739]  Herbal?
[03:51:25.739 --> 03:51:27.239]  How can that help?
[03:51:27.239 --> 03:51:31.822]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years, and Xtendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:31.822 --> 03:51:34.424]  Does your doctor know about Xtendivite?
[03:51:34.424 --> 03:51:38.326]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:38.326 --> 03:51:40.087]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:40.087 --> 03:51:41.248]  I don't want to stop.
[03:51:41.248 --> 03:51:42.209]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.

[03:54:04.369 --> 03:54:05.890]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:05.890 --> 03:54:10.112]  I want to get back to the speakers race that is heating up tonight.
[03:54:10.112 --> 03:54:11.693]  Talk about the three candidates there.
[03:54:11.693 --> 03:54:13.274]  I just mentioned Kevin McCarthy.
[03:54:13.274 --> 03:54:20.038]  I want to get back and talk about that, especially in light of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is going to be coming up pretty soon.
[03:54:20.038 --> 03:54:24.700]  Before I do, I just want to let you know real quickly, Liver Shield is back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:24.700 --> 03:54:27.702]  We keep selling out of Liver Shield with every new run.
[03:54:27.702 --> 03:54:29.823]  We do it very quickly and we have a good reason for that.
[03:54:29.823 --> 03:54:30.764]  You've probably heard
[03:54:31.324 --> 03:54:33.645]  My personal liver flush story using Liver Shield.
[03:54:33.645 --> 03:54:35.285]  The results are dramatic.
[03:54:35.285 --> 03:54:44.689]  It uses a powerful blend of organic and wild crafted herbs, specifically formulated to support natural function and detoxification of the liver and the gallbladder.
[03:54:44.689 --> 03:54:46.489]  Again, you can try Liver Shield.
[03:54:46.489 --> 03:54:47.670]  Take a look at our website.
[03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:51.091]  It'll tell you how to perform a liver flush at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:54:51.091 --> 03:54:52.471]  You can look at the reviews.
[03:54:52.471 --> 03:54:54.072]  Again, this is a limited run.
[03:54:54.072 --> 03:54:56.693]  It is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:54:57.853 --> 03:55:04.457]  Now just before the break I was talking about the House Speaker race that is heating up tonight.
[03:55:04.457 --> 03:55:07.079]  Remember that it was just this summer that Mark Meadows
[03:55:07.950 --> 03:55:11.911]  Introducing a motion to vacate the seat for John Boehner.
[03:55:11.911 --> 03:55:14.512]  In other words, just go.
[03:55:14.512 --> 03:55:15.932]  Just resign.
[03:55:15.932 --> 03:55:17.132]  At first he was laughed at.
[03:55:17.132 --> 03:55:18.813]  Then they looked at it and they said, hey, you know what?
[03:55:18.813 --> 03:55:20.233]  We don't have the votes.
[03:55:20.233 --> 03:55:22.414]  It was a razor-thin margin.
[03:55:22.414 --> 03:55:24.154]  And it was just before recess.
[03:55:24.154 --> 03:55:25.515]  So they decided they would wait.
[03:55:25.515 --> 03:55:30.576]  They would work on the congressman and the GOP and see if they could maintain his position.
[03:55:30.576 --> 03:55:33.957]  Obviously, they realized that they were not going to be able to
[03:55:34.697 --> 03:55:35.978]  Keep people in line.
[03:55:35.978 --> 03:55:41.720]  And so, when they came back from recess, John Boehner announced that he's going to take an immediate retirement.
[03:55:41.720 --> 03:55:44.582]  You know, it's the kind of, you can't fire me, I quit, type of attitude.
[03:55:44.582 --> 03:55:48.223]  You're not going to have Nixon to kick around anymore, that type of thing.
[03:55:48.223 --> 03:55:48.823]  And so, good.
[03:55:48.823 --> 03:55:49.244]  That's fine.
[03:55:49.244 --> 03:55:51.445]  Don't let the door hit you on the way out, okay?
[03:55:51.445 --> 03:55:52.765]  But, who is replacing him?
[03:55:52.765 --> 03:55:54.426]  As I mentioned before, we have Kevin McCarthy.
[03:55:54.426 --> 03:55:57.607]  That's the GOP establishment's candidate, apparently.
[03:55:57.607 --> 03:55:58.548]  He was the one that they put up.
[03:55:59.941 --> 03:56:04.988]  And he was the one who bragged this last Wednesday about how they put together the Benghazi investigation.
[03:56:04.988 --> 03:56:07.692]  Look at what it did to Hillary Clinton's poll numbers.
[03:56:07.692 --> 03:56:13.220]  That's being used now in commercials to revitalize Hillary Clinton, to say there's nothing to this.
[03:56:13.220 --> 03:56:15.383]  No, there's a lot to that.
[03:56:16.345 --> 03:56:19.188]  That's one of the things that people are so upset with the GOP leadership for.
[03:56:19.188 --> 03:56:27.155]  There are many issues for which Hillary should have been prosecuted, for which Obama should have been impeached, and they do nothing.
[03:56:27.155 --> 03:56:32.300]  Because they won't go beyond just using it for cheap political gain.
[03:56:32.300 --> 03:56:34.242]  And that's precisely what Kevin McCarthy did.
[03:56:34.242 --> 03:56:36.344]  So the Democrats are right about that.
[03:56:36.344 --> 03:56:37.225]  That's all it was.
[03:56:38.160 --> 03:56:40.022]  It should have been a real criminal investigation.
[03:56:40.022 --> 03:56:42.004]  There should have been real consequences, but there weren't.
[03:56:42.004 --> 03:56:44.726]  And you're not going to get that from the GOP leadership.
[03:56:44.726 --> 03:56:50.112]  So, after that happened on Wednesday, this huge moment, they say it was a gaffe.
[03:56:50.112 --> 03:56:52.994]  No, it was a moment of candor, okay?
[03:56:52.994 --> 03:56:56.698]  It was a candid truth where he told people what was going on.
[03:56:56.698 --> 03:57:00.322]  So, Sunday, we had Jason Chaffetz enter the race.
[03:57:01.400 --> 03:57:02.461]  Now who is this guy?
[03:57:02.461 --> 03:57:03.601]  Is he somebody that we can trust?
[03:57:03.601 --> 03:57:06.623]  Let me give you a little bit of background on Jason Chaffetz.
[03:57:06.623 --> 03:57:06.903]  Okay?
[03:57:06.903 --> 03:57:11.625]  His father was a co-chair of the Dukakis campaign in his state.
[03:57:11.625 --> 03:57:14.827]  His father had been married to Dukakis' former wife.
[03:57:14.827 --> 03:57:18.048]  So he's got long roots on both sides of this.
[03:57:18.048 --> 03:57:26.773]  When he decided he was going to come into politics in 2009, just before the massive influx of Republicans in 2010, he positioned himself as a Tea Party candidate.
[03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:30.551]  Has he operated as a Tea Party candidate?
[03:57:30.551 --> 03:57:31.891]  Well, let me tell you.
[03:57:31.891 --> 03:57:43.693]  The same guy, Mark Meadows, who said he was tired of the heavy-handedness, the heavy-handed rule of John Boehner, when anybody would not do exactly as he said, he threw him off of subcommittees.
[03:57:43.693 --> 03:57:46.634]  They were upset with his position on issues.
[03:57:46.634 --> 03:57:56.356]  Well, it was the same Mark Meadows that Jason Chaffetz threw off of a subcommittee because he wouldn't do what the GOP leadership wanted on the Trade Promotion Authority.
[03:57:57.409 --> 03:58:07.256]  Because he opposed the TPP, because he opposed the unconstitutional operation of Fast Track, he was thrown off the subcommittee by Jason Chaffetz.
[03:58:07.256 --> 03:58:11.999]  Is Jason Chaffetz nothing but a new face for the same old politics?
[03:58:11.999 --> 03:58:12.860]  In my opinion, yes.
[03:58:12.860 --> 03:58:18.604]  And so that leaves us with the third person, who is a little-known congressman from Florida
[03:58:19.324 --> 03:58:23.166]  And nobody gives him much of a chance, but we need to take a look at him.
[03:58:23.166 --> 03:58:25.727]  At least he opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:58:25.727 --> 03:58:27.988]  Tonight, InfoWars Nightly News, Leanne McAdoo.
[03:58:27.988 --> 03:58:34.630]  We're going to take a look at this launch of the Strong Cities Network, a UN initiative for global policing.
[03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:41.473]  Stay with us and join us tonight for InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:58:41.473 --> 03:58:45.415]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
