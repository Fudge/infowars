[00:23.640 --> 00:35.000]  well I'm really glad that you made the decision to tune in today this is going
[00:35.000 --> 00:44.000]  to be a particularly important worldwide transmission one of controlled rage I
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.720]  am so angry and so focused and so sure in my analysis of the globalist master plan
[00:52.720 --> 01:06.120]  that I am beside myself with concern and energy to resist these people I am beside
[01:06.120 --> 01:14.620]  myself the globalist are preparing and we can back them off to not just launch new
[01:14.620 --> 01:20.600]  wider wars but to also stage domestic terror attacks blaming domestic groups
[01:20.600 --> 01:24.800]  and publicly rolling out homeland security against the American people
[01:24.800 --> 01:29.960]  which they've already begun to do after a decade of claiming it was for al-CIA
[01:29.960 --> 01:33.800]  and then all the major operatives for al-Qaeda are on record working at the
[01:33.800 --> 01:39.600]  Pentagon from Adam Gadan grandson of the former head of the ADL to and we're all
[01:39.600 --> 01:44.080]  a locky dining secretly with the Secretary of the Army on record Fox News
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.560]  Associated Press to the underwear bomber drugged and put on the plane and we of
[01:48.560 --> 01:51.960]  course broke down a month and a half before it was mainstream news because
[01:51.960 --> 01:57.560]  our people see something they say something and when they see government
[01:57.560 --> 02:05.720]  terrorists they don't call the government terrorist they call us and so I'm
[02:05.720 --> 02:09.880]  going to give you real incredible threats not oh we're taking all your right
[02:09.880 --> 02:13.640]  swing and stick our hands on your pants for an unspecified threat I'm going to
[02:13.640 --> 02:19.800]  give you specified threats today I'm going to tell you who the terrorists are

[02:39.560 --> 02:45.240]  was already going on because the enemy programs you out in the open but if you
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.240]  are conscious and not hypnotized you see the magician leading the hypnotized
[02:49.240 --> 02:54.680]  person around by the nose I was able to say they're launching a bio attack to
[02:54.680 --> 02:59.520]  create fear and shut down the government even the ADL attacked me

[03:16.120 --> 03:20.960]  would be used to shut down the government exactly that happened I know the
[03:20.960 --> 03:27.720]  enemy's mind I study this so in-depth that it's like looking out of their own
[03:27.720 --> 03:32.440]  eyes and they're hesitating right now with different levers they can pull so
[03:32.440 --> 03:36.920]  I'm not sure what led where they're gonna pull because they're watching us

[08:09.520 --> 08:32.720]  it is February 7th 2012 this will be one of the most important broadcast I have
[08:32.720 --> 08:41.040]  ever done coming up in about 15 minutes at info wars dot com and prison planet
[08:41.040 --> 08:45.880]  dot com an article that Paul Watson and I have been working on this morning that
[08:45.880 --> 08:53.320]  he's finishing up right now will be posted to the websites and it is a
[08:53.320 --> 09:07.280]  worldwide private sector media alert info wars is going to issue a worldwide
[09:07.280 --> 09:16.880]  terrorism threat alert years before the State Department admitted that Mexico
[09:16.880 --> 09:19.640]  was one of the most dangerous countries in the world that you shouldn't travel
[09:19.640 --> 09:23.880]  there we could see the numbers of thousands of dead hundreds of US
[09:23.880 --> 09:28.280]  tourists every year and tell you that even though they wouldn't issue the
[09:28.280 --> 09:34.600]  alert that it's not safe and when it became cartoonishly obvious with 40
[09:34.600 --> 09:38.440]  thousand dead or so in just a few years hundreds and hundreds of US citizens
[09:38.440 --> 09:43.400]  kidnappings murders you name it they finally issued those a couple years ago
[09:43.400 --> 09:48.520]  so when the federal government who's been caught and we're going to have this in
[09:48.520 --> 09:54.360]  the article issuing fake terror alerts in 2005 and then again in 2009 and
[09:54.360 --> 09:57.640]  Governor Ridge the former head of Homeland Security two years ago wrote a
[09:57.640 --> 10:04.440]  book about it these are the terrorist these are the people trying to scare
[10:04.440 --> 10:08.600]  us into submission to give up our Bill of Rights and Constitution but when you
[10:08.600 --> 10:13.080]  look at it they're the ones lying about WMD's that take us to war that's that's
[10:13.080 --> 10:17.880]  a false flag terror threatening us with those weapons that don't exist that's
[10:17.880 --> 10:26.600]  the definition of terrorism the definition of terrorism throughout
[10:26.600 --> 10:34.280]  history is to carry out violence or threaten violence so that populations
[10:34.280 --> 10:39.560]  will accept a political goal and so you're told give up your right so the
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.280]  terrorist will kill you that is terrorizing someone telling a child be
[10:44.280 --> 10:48.440]  good or the boogeyman's gonna get you that's an old-fashioned way to make
[10:48.440 --> 10:52.440]  kids behave but the old-timers did telling him parables
[10:52.440 --> 10:57.880]  canceling Gretel and things like that that's terrorizing them
[10:59.640 --> 11:03.480]  telling the child don't go swim in the water or a shark will eat you that's
[11:03.480 --> 11:07.880]  terrorizing someone and that's what the system does they dance around going
[11:07.880 --> 11:10.840]  uga booga but here's the deal with all of the
[11:10.840 --> 11:14.600]  preconditioning the rollouts we're seeing the media hype that i'm going to go
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.520]  over here in a moment with all of this going on
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.680]  with all of this happening we are in a prime
[11:24.680 --> 11:31.480]  zone ahead of this war with iran for staged terror
[11:31.480 --> 11:35.240]  in europe israel the united states asia africa
[11:35.240 --> 11:38.680]  latin america you name it as governments everywhere
[11:38.680 --> 11:42.840]  higher private corporations or higher terror groups many of which are just
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.320]  mercenary groups operating under different shadowy names
[11:47.320 --> 11:53.400]  to stage a tax as pre-tax to get the population to go along with war
[11:53.400 --> 11:57.480]  and with the financial global consolidation the global financial
[11:57.480 --> 12:01.160]  takeover that's taking place as the megabank steal tens of
[12:01.160 --> 12:04.600]  trillions of dollars from taxpayers globally every year
[12:04.600 --> 12:10.520]  and have those governments sign over fraudulent what they say is a revocable
[12:10.520 --> 12:14.120]  control of their nations all the big movements are happening the
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.360]  political planets are aligning for global consolidation
[12:18.360 --> 12:24.360]  open world government giant wars bigger than just regional wars that the rand

[16:30.200 --> 16:34.680]  first line of the article scouts train to fight terrorists and more first line of the article
[16:34.680 --> 16:40.120]  they train to take out an iraq war vet people laugh and symbol they're 14 year olds this is
[16:40.120 --> 16:46.520]  from three years ago they're now 17 you ever heard of the hitler you again you know the soviets did
[16:46.520 --> 16:52.360]  that it's not about them being the toughest or the smartest it's about them being young and
[16:52.360 --> 16:59.800]  following orders and being cannon fodder you know what the hitler youths did to the russian army
[17:00.360 --> 17:05.080]  coming in to those cities they killed tens of thousands of russian soldiers

[17:10.120 --> 17:20.280]  phosphorus mine on it they're dumb because they're young they're not informed yet that's why they
[17:20.280 --> 17:24.840]  want you at 18 to join the military and that's why by the time you get out when you're 30 years old
[17:24.840 --> 17:30.120]  you're marked as the enemy because they know you've been psychologically profiled and hired into a
[17:30.120 --> 17:35.800]  police department or into a security system if you follow orders watch football all day and
[17:35.800 --> 17:41.720]  think the american people are your enemy that's the 30 in the actuaries and all the different
[17:41.720 --> 17:47.000]  studies around 30 generally it's really about 28 on average but let's just say 30 30 percent
[17:47.000 --> 17:55.960]  we'll do anything they're told tsa people like that 70 percent are awake and you know what you're
[17:55.960 --> 18:01.160]  the number one enemy your track your trace your watch you're in a file okay just get that straight
[18:01.160 --> 18:05.800]  and that's on record just like before it was on record i told you that was the case because i've
[18:05.800 --> 18:12.360]  been to the drills and watched it i'd snuck into drills the feds were so mad that they were threatening
[18:12.360 --> 18:17.800]  to kill me over the telephone on a weekly basis and had people when i was in florida and other
[18:17.800 --> 18:23.080]  areas jumping out of the woods at night because i was trying to film drills taking on they were
[18:23.080 --> 18:28.200]  practicing taking over us cities and they would have guys but this happened my hands and saw it
[18:28.200 --> 18:34.040]  a guy jumps out of the bushes and starts lighting things on fire saying i'd done it and i had to
[18:34.040 --> 18:39.640]  put it out and start tackling the guy and threatened to physically stomp his guts out and take the
[18:39.640 --> 18:46.600]  lighter away from him and of course he was assigned to military intelligence that's who
[18:46.600 --> 18:52.120]  runs america because i fight the narcotics trafficking because i fight the treason because i
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.600]  am a soldier of the republic defending this country because i know what i'm talking about
[18:56.600 --> 19:03.320]  because i'm motivated and i improvise from nowhere and saw the un documents when i was 20 years old
[19:03.320 --> 19:07.720]  and got motivated to get a media system and developed this and built it brick by brick from
[19:07.720 --> 19:13.240]  nothing and i'm an example of what you can do to expose these people and what all you can do to
[19:13.240 --> 19:17.880]  fight the new world order it's time to get aggressive because they're coming into the end
[19:17.880 --> 19:24.520]  game right now with this new war and the checkpoints and the rollouts and a stack of globalist media

[24:25.480 --> 24:31.880]  is get it twitter at facebook it get it out to everybody because this isn't 2001 when i was doing
[24:31.880 --> 24:35.800]  every show saying they're going to blow up the world trade center blaming on their cia asset
[24:35.800 --> 24:41.880]  bin laden and then launch an anthrax attack how did i know the globalists were drilling for it
[24:41.880 --> 24:48.280]  and openly hyping it in the media it's like fire departments that have been caught many times setting
[24:48.280 --> 24:53.640]  fires whenever budget cuts come or firefighters that get caught planting bombs it happens all
[24:53.640 --> 24:59.640]  the time the average firefighter is a great person but there's a certain type who does this so they
[24:59.640 --> 25:05.480]  can be the hero it's the oldest trick in the book moonshows and by proxy abusing your kids you can
[25:05.480 --> 25:12.760]  be the savior and all of us are basically acting like a bunch of stock home syndrome folks well not
[25:12.760 --> 25:19.800]  me i don't like my abusers i don't appreciate it and i see him building a giant army of scum
[25:19.800 --> 25:24.840]  um we're the boss in this country the federal government can't say my bill of rights is gone
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.480]  they can't say my declaration of independence is gone my constitution is gone they can't say
[25:29.480 --> 25:35.240]  they can secretly arrest me and kill me they can try it through terrorist illegal force just like
[25:35.240 --> 25:40.280]  somebody can try to rob a bank and shoot the teller but they're lawless and i'm calling them out
[25:40.920 --> 25:48.520]  i'm not here to do this at half speed i'm not here to lose and i see you murderers
[25:48.520 --> 25:53.960]  and all of your childlike idiot servants and government all the compartmentalized twits
[25:53.960 --> 25:57.560]  who are too weak-minded to see what's going on and that's the general public more than even
[25:57.560 --> 26:02.520]  police and military i've got to be honest most police and military i talk to an average are
[26:02.520 --> 26:10.120]  more awake than the public by far but that's low and mid-level feds and police and military when
[26:10.120 --> 26:17.560]  you get into the higher ranks they are power tripping servants or they're very stupid bag men
[26:17.560 --> 26:24.840]  who will do whatever they're told okay it's very simple it's not complex this has happened over

[33:26.600 --> 33:54.840]  welcome ladies and gentlemen to a emergency worldwide citizen alert
[33:56.920 --> 34:05.960]  this is a real terror attack threat alert the globalists are so arrogant that in open white
[34:05.960 --> 34:12.120]  papers democratic operatives are openly discussing and saying they want to have a staged attack
[34:12.120 --> 34:20.280]  blamed on libertarians and conservatives even fox news has covered this it is in our article
[34:20.280 --> 34:27.240]  and i'm seeing the pre-propaganda accelerate like i did before 9 11 but a rebranding off of a muslim
[34:27.240 --> 34:36.760]  threat onto a domestic threat and that is in the news today fbi paying cash for a cup of coffee a
[34:36.760 --> 34:42.840]  potential indicator of terror activity they also ask the internet cafe coffee shops that if someone
[34:42.840 --> 34:53.080]  is using a server proxy to surf the internet or to get search results that you should call the fbi
[34:53.080 --> 34:59.160]  on them after decades of denying that government was spying on us without warrants and after the
[34:59.160 --> 35:04.280]  decade of google promising to never keep the results or share them they're now admitting you have no
[35:04.280 --> 35:10.280]  rights we're going to use the data and sell it medical information anything you do anything you
[35:10.280 --> 35:16.920]  search and so that's the equivalent of saying all your mail has to be in a see-through plastic
[35:17.560 --> 35:22.280]  container or envelope or that you have to live in a glass house that if you want to close the
[35:22.280 --> 35:29.800]  blinds i mean i went in the bathroom this morning i closed the door that that's bad this is the total
[35:29.800 --> 35:39.480]  overthrow of all basic liberty and paul watson has the link to the fbi's flyer and announcement
[35:40.360 --> 35:46.600]  this is big breaking news at info wars dot com communities against terrorism potential indicators
[35:46.600 --> 35:51.800]  of terrorist activities related to internet cafe and we've shown you dozens of these for barbershops
[35:51.800 --> 35:58.760]  for gun shops for five and dimes for uh farm and ranch supply stores for tattoo shops you know they
[35:58.760 --> 36:05.800]  say do they have american flag tattoos go ahead and call us uh at the gun shop are they missing
[36:05.800 --> 36:12.280]  fingers at the farmer supply shop are they missing fingers go ahead and call us let's say about 10
[36:12.280 --> 36:18.600]  percent of farmers i know are missing fingers or are missing arms i got family missing fingers
[36:20.440 --> 36:26.680]  you ever actually worked in your life on a farm or a ranch you've worked about heavy equipment
[36:26.680 --> 36:30.440]  you ever driven tractors have stuck your arm in a combine to pull something out
[36:33.320 --> 36:38.200]  the point is is it's about training everyone to be spies and to trust no one
[36:39.720 --> 36:47.080]  or a threat that doesn't kill as many people every year as honeybees so we have that report
[36:47.800 --> 36:53.000]  then we have roiders fbi warns of threat from anti-government extremist

[43:41.880 --> 43:47.080]  did it's all in the war powers act read it routine encounters with police can turn violent
[43:47.080 --> 43:51.640]  drop of the hat yeah you pulse my over their family you start talking about you're taking to jail
[43:51.640 --> 43:55.160]  because you know they they you know they can't pay all their tickets because you bankrupted them

[44:12.280 --> 44:17.320]  of the hat said steward macArthur deputy assistant director and fbis counterterrorism division gotta
[44:17.320 --> 44:21.160]  love that counterterror division you mean the folks that ship guns into mexico
[44:21.160 --> 44:27.160]  to blame the second amendment you mean those those kind of terror attacks we thought it
[44:27.160 --> 44:31.160]  was important to increase the visibility of the threat with the state and local law enforcement
[44:31.160 --> 44:35.640]  they're getting ready for some new Oklahoma cities to blame us and they want the cops to go you did
[44:35.640 --> 44:40.680]  warn us you care about us yeah we're sorry they hit the local police department daycare center
[44:40.680 --> 44:45.160]  don't know how the terrorists found that one oh yeah yeah yeah oh and immediately and if your
[44:45.160 --> 44:50.040]  local cop and catch him get video get it out that day or they'll kill you they kill a lot of cops and

[44:55.720 --> 44:58.920]  cowards they call up and threaten you and your family you'll just roll over right there
[45:01.640 --> 45:05.400]  we thought it was important to increase the visibility of the threat with state and local
[45:05.400 --> 45:10.600]  law enforcement he said in may of 2002 Memphis west Memphis Arkansas police officers were shot and
[45:10.600 --> 45:15.080]  killed in an argument that developed after they pulled over a sovereign citizen in traffic that
[45:15.080 --> 45:18.680]  whole thing was really shady last year in extremists in texas open fire and police officer
[45:18.680 --> 45:24.040]  during a traffic stop the officer was not yet legal convictions is such extremist mostly for
[45:24.040 --> 45:28.120]  white collar crimes is fraud that means actually suing the criminals back have increased and it
[45:28.120 --> 45:33.800]  just goes on and they're going on to say get ready for it to happen now let me give you the
[45:33.800 --> 45:39.720]  worldwide terror alert this is a maximum alert okay a lot of data goes into this a lot of data
[45:39.720 --> 45:45.000]  points but i can see them gearing up for the new war all of it and they're going to want to clamp
[45:45.000 --> 45:50.440]  down on free speech and the rest of it they know we're getting close to them info wars issues
[45:50.440 --> 45:55.560]  emergency terror alert threat of false flag event has never been greater given the fact of the u.s
[45:55.560 --> 46:05.080]  and israel are both yearning for a uh causes beli to launch an attack on iran added to recent
[46:05.080 --> 46:10.760]  history where a staged provocation was considered and in addition to the innumerable examples
[46:10.760 --> 46:15.400]  of false flags overseen by the obama administration alone the threat of staged terror has never been
[46:15.400 --> 46:19.880]  greater unlike the plethora of fake terror alerts that former homeland security director
[46:19.880 --> 46:25.000]  tom ridge admitted were issued for political propaganda this one is very serious indeed
[46:26.120 --> 46:31.880]  and i'm giving you specific threats u.s intelligence officials that's the people doing it last week
[46:31.880 --> 46:37.080]  upped the rhetoric against iran during congressional testimony by claiming that tehran is preparing to
[46:37.080 --> 46:43.560]  launch reprisal attacks inside the united states and they also separately in the in the brookings
[46:43.560 --> 46:48.520]  institution and others said that they would stage a provocation like we don't read that like we're
[46:48.520 --> 46:53.480]  idiots director of natural intelligence james r clapper junior side of the alleged iranian plot
[46:53.480 --> 46:58.040]  to assassinate a saudi ambassador on u.s soil has assigned that some iranian officials probably
[46:58.040 --> 47:03.160]  including supreme leader have changed their calculus and are now willing to conduct an attack
[47:03.160 --> 47:06.760]  in the united states in response to real or perceived u.s actions that threaten the regime
[47:06.760 --> 47:10.120]  that way they've laid there even in the region and taken the attacks inside their country
[47:10.120 --> 47:14.520]  as we document at the time according to u.s army lieutenant colonel anthony schaefer no
[47:14.520 --> 47:18.760]  information concerning the supposed plot even existed within fbi channels strongly suggesting
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.440]  the story was manufactured by the obama administration the new york times also reported
[47:22.440 --> 47:28.040]  that dubious nature of the plot caused a wave of puzzlement and skepticism from some foreign
[47:28.040 --> 47:32.520]  leaders and outside experts advocates of an attack on iran have implied the u.s could stage a
[47:32.520 --> 47:38.040]  provocation we have links to them saying it as a pretext for a military assault in january of
[47:38.040 --> 47:42.360]  08 dick cheney's office considered staging an incident we have a link to pull a surprise
[47:42.360 --> 47:47.480]  winner writing about that to blame on iran warships and us ships patrolling the state of
[47:47.480 --> 47:54.920]  hormuz were attacked the big threat is domestic folks that's what they're hearing up for despite
[47:54.920 --> 47:59.960]  this sordid history of lies that were manufactured about weapons of mass destruction nidra yellow
[47:59.960 --> 48:06.120]  cake and dodgy dossiers to justify the invasion of iraq in 03 we're seeing history repeat itself
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.720]  as the u.s seeks to exploit another artificial crisis as a pretext to back the israeli attack
[48:11.720 --> 48:16.760]  on iran numerous examples since obama took office illustrate how this administration
[48:16.760 --> 48:22.440]  and the intelligence agencies are surrounded are by no means uh reticent to bizarrely lie
[48:22.440 --> 48:26.680]  and stage events for political purposes despite the obama administration's best efforts to
[48:26.680 --> 48:31.800]  characterize operation fast and furious an atf program that sought to put us based firearms
[48:31.800 --> 48:35.400]  in the hands of mexican drug smugglers has little more than a screw up the most damning
[48:35.400 --> 48:39.480]  evidence strongly indicates that the whole operation well a bcbs news got the fact that
[48:39.480 --> 48:44.760]  it was doesn't indicate is an attempt to launch a false flag assault on the second amendment of
[48:44.760 --> 48:49.800]  the american people yeah they said they blame it on that obama himself told gun control advocate
[48:49.800 --> 48:54.360]  sarah brady last year that his administration was working under the radar to sneak attack the
[48:54.360 --> 48:59.720]  second amendment just months before the fast and furious scandal leaked and at the same time as
[48:59.720 --> 49:03.400]  the administration officials were blaming violence in mexico on the second amendment
[49:03.400 --> 49:07.720]  when in reality the administration itself was responsible for arming the drug cartels these
[49:07.720 --> 49:17.640]  are terrorist eight agencies involved a further example of false flag attack under the current
[49:17.640 --> 49:24.120]  administration involves the christmas day underwear bomber who was helped through security despite
[49:24.120 --> 49:29.400]  being on a terrorist watchlist with no passport by a well-dressed indian man on christmas day
[49:29.400 --> 49:34.920]  o nine it later emerged the state department was ordered this is on c-span not to revoke
[49:34.920 --> 49:40.520]  his visa by federal counterterrorism officials even though the accused bomber had known terrorist
[49:40.520 --> 49:47.640]  ties that's a quote in addition to the fact that his own father had worked uh his own father had
[49:47.640 --> 49:55.160]  warned us intelligence officials on the threat posed by him a month before the attempted attack
[49:56.440 --> 50:02.120]  while the public is now being told that terrorists are about to strike on us soil the us government
[50:02.120 --> 50:09.000]  itself has warned that al-qaeda funded terrorists in libya again all the public is being told that
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.160]  terrorists are about to strike on us soil the us government itself has armed and funded al-qaeda
[50:15.160 --> 50:20.600]  terrorists in libya to overthrow qaddafi and it's now backing al-qaeda groups in iran to
[50:20.600 --> 50:24.440]  carry out bombings and assassinations links to the government admitting all this in an effort
[50:24.440 --> 50:30.440]  to undermine akmed denizad government the same terrorists used in libya were also subsequently
[50:30.440 --> 50:37.560]  subsequently airlifted to syria as part of an effort to depose president basheer Assad now it
[50:37.560 --> 50:42.840]  goes on in the domestic areas and that's the most important part of this i'm going to have this
[50:42.840 --> 50:49.720]  updated there and uh point out that we are issuing a real terror threat because these

[54:21.800 --> 54:26.440]  domestic events so they can go after free speech and continue to get away with their criminal
[54:26.440 --> 54:32.920]  activities it's the oldest trick in the book and it's happening and i'm seeing massive media hype
[54:32.920 --> 54:39.800]  in movies but also you know uh in non-fiction but it really is fiction nightly news everywhere
[54:39.800 --> 54:46.200]  they're saying the right-wingers are getting ready to attack and there's all these advisors to obama
[54:46.200 --> 54:51.000]  Shapiro and others saying a big terror attack well is the only thing that will save you and now the
[54:51.000 --> 54:57.080]  media is saying get ready for the attack and we and i've learned how to watch these people so
[54:57.080 --> 55:01.720]  i want the system to know our people are everywhere that's the only thing but it's been holding it
[55:01.720 --> 55:07.640]  back so far is the system knows we continue to catch them we caught them on fast and furious
[55:07.640 --> 55:12.120]  i reported on that six years ago that's how i was able to tell you bush was involved and that holder
[55:12.120 --> 55:19.720]  would then play that card um on issa months later he did i know how they work the mutual blackmail
[55:19.720 --> 55:25.080]  society and i mean you can sit there and play chess with them all day you can see their next
[55:25.080 --> 55:30.360]  moves and i'm telling you they look like they're going for the terror card and you've got iran in
[55:30.360 --> 55:35.720]  there they could just have iran stage an attack you know say iran did it uh or provocateurs some
[55:35.720 --> 55:41.240]  group or they could claim that domestic groups hit and iran hit and link that up but now they're
[55:41.240 --> 55:49.800]  saying paying for coffee with cash and and telling internet bars internet shops cafes to watch what
[55:49.800 --> 55:58.360]  you're surfing again it's a total spy society how about we watch you crooks how about we watch the
[55:58.360 --> 56:02.360]  folks that are known for doing this and i just called paul during the break because we went over
[56:02.360 --> 56:07.240]  this article this morning i'm going to have him up front in the article add the part about
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.720]  they're going after domestic not just saying it's al-qaeda
[56:15.560 --> 56:21.080]  it continues here while the public is being told that terrorists are about to strike on us soil
[56:21.080 --> 56:25.400]  the u.s government itself has armed and funded al-qaeda terrorists in libya and it goes through
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.440]  all that fact it is crystal clear that the gigantic anti-terror apparatus itself created in the
[56:30.440 --> 56:37.720]  aftermath of 9 11 is now being used against the american people with citizens being trained to
[56:37.720 --> 56:43.160]  spy on each other under the auspices of homeland security see something say something campaign
[56:43.160 --> 56:49.160]  to illustrate the absurdity of how far this reaches hot dog sellers at the recent super bowl
[56:51.080 --> 56:53.640]  were trained by the tsa to spot terrorists
[56:53.640 --> 57:02.520]  both the dhs and the fbi are also characterizing mundane behavior such as paying for a cup of
[57:02.520 --> 57:08.920]  coffee with cash using a video camera talking to police officers yet talking terrorism now wearing
[57:08.920 --> 57:16.200]  hoodies driving vans uh writing on a piece of paper we have links to all this and using a cell
[57:16.200 --> 57:21.000]  phone recording application as indicators of terrorist activity how about working for a government
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.920]  that's been known to stage terror attacks have been caught doing it how about that the top of
[57:24.920 --> 57:29.480]  it all off the obama administration was also instrumental in passing a provision of the
[57:29.480 --> 57:34.760]  ndaa bill which authorizes the military to kidnap and incarcerate u.s citizens without trial
[57:34.760 --> 57:40.280]  merely on the accusation that they may be terrorist the environment of fear and paranoia has been
[57:40.280 --> 57:45.320]  created as a result of all this makes fertile ground for the government to stage a crisis
[57:45.320 --> 57:50.600]  or manufacture an emergency situation that will be used to rally the american people around a
[57:50.600 --> 57:57.800]  number of different domestic and geopolitical agendas and again paul i told i called about an
[57:57.800 --> 58:01.720]  hour and a half before news time went over some notes some points i wanted in this alert he's
[58:01.720 --> 58:11.000]  going to add some more he's going to point out that i warned in sep in uh july of 2001 about the
[58:11.000 --> 58:17.400]  upcoming attack i even called the target and and and i did have dr monteef coming on i'm going to
[58:17.400 --> 58:21.160]  push him back 20 minutes into the next hour because i've got to continue breaking this down
[58:21.160 --> 58:30.520]  how i know all this okay again we have a fraudulent government i mean they they take kids from people

[58:35.400 --> 58:39.560]  violating the truancy laws we've got proof of that that's a lawless group of criminals

[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.120]  the folks that are actually staging the terror attacks our government has been taken over by

[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:22.600]  specifically on the subject of info wars issues emergency terror alert now things have built
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:30.840]  to a head before and i've issued deeds in month after underwear bombing a few weeks after a
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:37.160]  son attack a month after 9 11 attack i mean i've learned when they're building this up
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:41.480]  we've issued terror alerts over the years i don't know i might have issued seven or eight
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:48.120]  where i'm saying this is an alert and there's been cases where it doesn't develop because we've
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:55.240]  got people watching and this backs the globalist off but they think we're so stupid that obama
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.520]  has all these advisors in the financial times of london you name it writing articles about how
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:08.440]  great a stage terror attack would be and then you have a government that lies and says it's the law
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.840]  to take vaccines and takes kids to kangaroo courts and takes them from their parents when there's no
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:18.520]  law and now all over the country they're trying to take people's children if they're uh you know
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:26.600]  tardy to class that's in the washington post judge sets trial date in london school tardiness case
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:32.120]  and the father who's a lawyer before he'd come on he says i keep getting invited on talk shows and
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:39.640]  burned where they say they're my friend and they get me on and then they say why don't you take
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.400]  your kid to school and i point out it's not even the law i could take my kid out of the school if
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:49.400]  i wanted to she's a it's a five-year-old they've been late and they're combining these and saying
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.680]  it's truancy the code says it's this many unexcused they're excused i'm the parent but even
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.320]  they were unexcused it takes more than this this isn't what the law says but they won't let them get

[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.520]  in juvenile halls like a janet reno type he's like no no but she actually looks just like mr
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:32.040]  napolitano no no not that the dad's like whatever and they signed their kid over into juvenile
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:38.040]  signed him over into an adjudication where now he's a criminal in their racial hygiene court that's
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.640]  what the family court is not a real court and so this father who's a lawyer they report here in
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:51.400]  the washington post you know their lawyers the couple was arraigned monday morning in juvenile
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:57.080]  domestic relations court judge pamela l brook see it's not a real court the dinner courts are each
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:04.520]  charged with three cases of class three misdemeanors and it goes on to have the dinner courts both
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:11.000]  trained as lawyers argue that whoever's one's option of their parenting the county has no legal
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.680]  authority to convict them of a crime and of course he sent me the code 22.1-254 right just like texas
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:25.400]  parents to do whatever they want parents to take their kids out period it's when it's incredible
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:31.480]  and it's not even enough truancies to kick in and be criminal let's see they don't care it's all
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:42.200]  about criminal activity and here it is late to class this is that this is uh this is late
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:50.040]  i've got the daisy's tardiness the five-year-old and here is the summons and they've now been
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.360]  arraigned for something and i've got the code that isn't even the law and again we probably got the
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:00.120]  father on the last 30 minutes of the show today this is the type of garbage i'm talking about and
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:07.000]  it's everything it's everywhere the police break the law they've got the military on the streets
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.920]  breaking the law they're saying there's no constitution that they'll spy on us without
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:16.280]  warrants they're stealing tens of trillions of dollars for foreign banks the congress says
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:23.240]  they're allowed to insider trade that's totally illegal they're just exercising criminal authority
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:30.920]  on us trying to break our will the tsa's out of their jurisdiction all of it sworn police can't
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:37.400]  stick their hands down your pants it the martial law is everything is an arrest situation you're
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:43.240]  under arrest that's what martial law is and we're all prisoners we're all under custodial arrest
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:48.360]  in a national emergency carried out by foreign banks that hijacked the country and are training
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:55.160]  the cops for war with us cops that's basically the system training you to jump in front of 18
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:00.440]  wheelers going 100 miles an hour or to stick your hand down garbage disposals i don't hate you
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:06.520]  i don't want war with you but i'm sure not scared of you all your black uniforms all your junk i mean
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:12.440]  you know if civil war starts you're going to be hiding out in your bunkers and that's part of
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:18.360]  the globalist plan as well i look i don't want to go there just have an awakening realize training
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.480]  people serving coffee to spy on folks and that paying with cash is criminal just just just just
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:30.520]  wake up for heaven sakes let's take a few calls but i've put out this worldwide alert info wars
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.760]  issues emergency terror alert that there's never been a time when they're getting more ready for
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.320]  this right now and saying domestic groups are getting ready to hit any minute and you know that
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:44.440]  we're evil because we love america i mean we're just aware of what's happened please get this out
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:49.880]  please get this out please get this out to everybody brent in pennsylvania you're on the air
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:59.000]  yeah i like how you do man i'm okay yeah i tell you what this is just a further acclimation to the
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:05.880]  further marshal law police state that's ongoing every day it's ridiculous by every yardstick
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.760]  the united states is a cartoon level tyranny and now they're saying we'll secretly arrest you and
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.480]  we're gonna start shutting the media down i mean they're now openly admitting it notice all the
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:20.280]  criminals at once are saying yeah we're gonna share all your data with google yeah microsoft's
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.320]  spying on you yeah the schools are watching you at home over your laptops yeah we're putting gps
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:30.440]  on your car yeah when we pull you over we're gonna take blood without a warrant yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.600]  yeah we're gonna shoot your kids up whether you like it or not yeah we're gonna take your kids
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:41.640]  yeah we're criminals go ahead get it the self-fulfilling prophecy and whether they like it or not
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:47.800]  they're pushing the people against the wall and you know i don't want to see the people get anger
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:53.640]  and resort to violence but you know it's like uh putting a rabbit in the cage you mean you can't
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:59.160]  expect it not to bite you all part of the plan they've told the cops get ready for for terrorist
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.240]  they force people into situations to defend themselves that'll be called terrorism i hear you
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.000]  good points but to prime it all to make anybody resisting look bad they'll blow up some daycare
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.200]  centers and stuff see the feds will like they've done before it's all part of them posing and the
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.160]  cops running up and grabbing the leg of the fed the fed puts the wing over but if the cop wakes up
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.840]  the fed being the terrorist they'll just kill the cop and their family uh let's because the cops love
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:29.560]  that anyways let's talk to mark in new york mark you're on the air go ahead hey elix hey buddy um
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:35.480]  you know you left one thing out in your report though obama is starting a war with the roman
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:42.280]  catholic church and according to the drudge report they were saying that there might be war on the
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:49.160]  streets because of it yeah they're saying that all churches have to hire people who are for abortion
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:54.920]  and of other sexual persuasions and in england they are banning christians from proselytizing on
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:01.640]  the street if it the the advertising commission is saying if we don't like like saying there's a god
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:05.560]  and that you could live forever that's false advertising your band so they're banning free
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:11.480]  speech in england magna carta uh that's uh bbc is very proud of it and yes they're announcing
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:17.560]  that you will you but again it's only christianity you know i saw a newsweek cover that i actually
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.800]  bought it forgot to bring it today it was the war on christianity but it's how pockets of
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.040]  muslims are attacking christians which is true but it's only to get christians mad at muslims for a
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:32.440]  new war the state is waging war against christians and yes they're saying that catholic schools will
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:39.560]  teach all this stuff and that they will uh you know promote and fund abortion and and that's you
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:45.320]  know if he goes against uh the roman catholic church that could be really bad but i do agree
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.600]  with you i read drudge report this morning on what you wrote in you know you would be
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:57.800]  considered a cyber incident quote unquote according to the api yeah well i know drudge linked to our
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:03.800]  article uh senate passes bill allowing airports to evict tsa screeners legislation could lead to
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:08.920]  despise federal agency being marginalized from aviation security people say well they'll just
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:14.520]  bring in private gropers yeah but but then that'll be marginalized this is going to be the beginning
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:20.040]  it see they've got to break our will in the airports groping us and everything and and force the
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.680]  line of the radiation machines because they got to have it on the streets if they fail there they
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:30.520]  fail everywhere if the globalists fail anywhere they fail everywhere do you see that but it also
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:36.440]  depends on what pistol has to say today in the committee because he's up there representing the
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:45.960]  the tsa and personally i think pistol is a known congenital liar well that's true he said that
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:51.320]  machines of intensive radiation not true he said they don't grow up children under 12 not true
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.960]  he said they don't strip old ladies not true they don't rip off colostomy bags not true
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:03.000]  liars liars and i mean i'm seeing 10 cases or more a day of them robbing people who else do you
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.040]  think is going to want to grow up old ladies all day and grow up children oh i mean of course
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:13.880]  they're robbing bags and raping women and parking lots and and planting things on people of course
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:20.760]  who would wait hours a day want to sit there bullying people but the lowest forms of brown
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:28.680]  shirt trash i agree with you man i just wanted to make that point uh with uh roman catholic
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.640]  church because i think that could be another fault sir i agree with you but did you hear
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:39.640]  me england is saying the advertising authority that the the truth and advertising commission
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:44.280]  is now you know you've heard of them banning bible passages because it's anti gay or whatever
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:49.480]  now this is in the news it's in my stack it just doesn't even rate as important compared
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:53.400]  to all the other it's very important that's how conditioned i've gotten to accept pure evil it's
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:58.120]  just everywhere they're saying we're not going to let you go on the street and preach because we

[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:59.800]  soviet uh surveillance grid tattletale squad systems being set up and so the system's gotta tell
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:03.560]  police the military yeah we're gonna start torturing people and killing them and secretly
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.920]  arresting them yeah we spy without warrants now there's all these movies glorifying it i mean
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:14.680]  it's full on brainwashing and uh yeah these groups that uh think there's an evil takeover of america
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:20.360]  they're the terrorist and they're getting ready to hit the government and then we know the government's
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:26.520]  hit itself before because it's not the government it's it's it's a government that's been hijacked so
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:35.560]  the report is at info wars dot com it's linkedin red info wars issues emergency terror alert
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:42.600]  hall joseph watson and alex jones and remember i'm the guy that told you july 25th 2001 they
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:48.120]  were going to blow up the world trade center and blame it on their asset bin laden and i'm the guy
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.480]  that told you september 11th they were going to launch a bio attack to shut down the government
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:57.800]  for a time i can just tell by the way they were behaving that indeed happened it's all on record
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:06.440]  and uh i i i'm seeing it come to recusindo and remember they've got three different
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:12.120]  white house advisors and one of their think tanks putting out recruitment letters saying don't worry
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:17.320]  give to obama he's gonna win even if you don't think he will there's gonna be a new alcohol
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:23.320]  in the city and that'll really make the president look strong i mean they think we're so dumb and
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:27.720]  you show this to police and fbi most of their like i'm not going to look at that you know
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:33.240]  here's the point i want to make before we go to dr monteef and i want you to hear this carefully
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:37.720]  they're always saying see something say something so we all spy on each other and see
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:43.160]  everyone is a threat so we don't trust each other they tell cops if somebody tries to talk to you
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.760]  they're probably a terrorist if somebody pays for coffee with cash they're a terrorist
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:50.200]  they got a ron paul sticker they're a terrorist and they actually say this
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:55.560]  no we know who the terrorist are we know who has the history
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:36:01.240]  who has the motive who has the means you have the background you've been caught doing it
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:08.920]  you have the motive and you have the means and you're hyping terror so you can take over more
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:14.200]  of society and always these movies and tv shows with the where the feds are so concerned about human
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.680]  life it's the opposite i've seen their training videos i have a clip of it in road to tyranny
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.520]  where the fema guy is going the first terrorist where george washington thomas jefferson the cops
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:28.520]  are like yes yes and then cops are agreeing he went good job good job he goes listen when the
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:32.440]  domestic groups attack and kill a whole lot of civilians too bad for the civilians we don't care
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:39.240]  about them it's about keeping us safe and the cops are like oh you'll keep me safe these are the feds
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:48.600]  that bomb the local cops oh man it's it's just too rich it's just too sick there are no feds
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:53.400]  there's not a federal government it's run by globalists now wake up to that hoax and i know you've
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:57.560]  woken up so they're getting ready for new terror attacks to blame it on us they're admitting they
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:03.560]  want to censor us now dr monteef was on with us a few weeks ago and then he had to go out of town
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:07.240]  for a while and he's really concerned about he talked about that council on foreign relations
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:12.680]  report that i did see where they were saying oh we'll attack iran but then we've got to
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:16.040]  accept their attack but again it's not we'll attack the banks that run us will attack them
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:22.920]  but uh the word is iran's been told associated press reported do not respond to an attack
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:28.680]  or israel may even use tactical nukes on them so we're gonna attack you and if you fight back
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:35.000]  we're gonna nuke you dr stan monteef practiced orthopedic surgery in santa cruz for 35 years
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.560]  and he led a delegation uh to of course the uh was an advisor to the state house and
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:46.280]  it's an expert on aides being a government bio weapon syndicated talk show host fight the new
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:51.320]  world order for almost 50 years uh he joins us better uh better a bit late than ever i backed
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:55.400]  him off 20 minutes to be able to finish my alert and then we had isdn issues but he joins us now
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:00.760]  radio liberty dot com's his website doc you know i i know you're back about the whole iran thing and
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:09.160]  uh since you were on sec sec def came out and said yeah the war is on in march april or may uh
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:14.120]  net nyahu says stop chattering about it uh all of this is getting crazy they're saying iran's
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:20.200]  going to attack domestically uh when that would bring down absolute you know bloody you know what
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.000]  on them and then meanwhile there's all these alerts there's going to be a new oklahoma city
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.160]  i mean can you not do you see the same chatter i see the same preconditioning
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:35.640]  to roll out domestic terror attacks as a pretext for a further clampdown uh dr monteef
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:41.640]  absolutely i think there's no question at all this is what they intend to do they intend
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:48.280]  to create a situation of chaos and crisis to justify the implementation of the dictatorship
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:55.960]  and everything is in place i mean it is simply so amazing i mean everybody in this country in fact
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:39:00.440]  everybody in the whole world now has a number there they're numbering all the people over in
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:07.320]  india every person in america has a number we get it at birth i said that they have their cameras
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:14.680]  out everybody has a card you use that card uh for purchases a visa card a grocery store card
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:20.760]  they know and they keep a list of everything you buy they have dosiers on everyone that said the
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:28.760]  the DARPA has a dosier homeland security has a dosier the fbi has a dosier the ci has a dosier
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:36.520]  i've seen my fbi dosier page after page after page blocked out in the name of national security
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:42.680]  i said they and they tap our telephones as you know through echelon they read all of our emails
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:49.320]  and all of our faxes they were doing this long before september 11th project echelon e c h e l o
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.560]  when anybody can go up in the internet and see it they have their fusion centers that's what they
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:58.920]  correlate our they're now saying cia is going to operate domestically totally illegal it is a
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:04.040]  lawless takeover because they're collapsing the world economy i mean remember 10 years ago they
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:07.720]  say we were conspiracy theorists for saying derivatives would be used to implode the world
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:14.440]  economy and bring in a world government now the un says world government world tax it's all here
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:20.360]  absolutely this is what it's all about everything is about establishing that
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:26.920]  world government and that is why we're going to have this war with Iran and of course well
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:33.720]  i'd sent you and it had been based upon a more or less covert meeting held at the
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:41.080]  council on foreign relations at their herald bradhouse 50 80 60 street new york city and because
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:48.920]  i'm a a a media person accredited for the cfr material they were kind enough to send me the
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:55.960]  transcript of this meeting and the remarks by a man named matthew crony who'd written the lead
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:03.880]  article in the january february issue of foreign affairs magazine entitled time to attack iran
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.480]  that was the title of the article and here in this this private briefing and you have a copy of it
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:16.200]  that why he is explaining to the members of the cfr a very small group apparently from the uh from
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:21.720]  the report there there were not too many people in the audience but he was explaining this whole
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:28.840]  rationale uh that well of course iran has not decided to build a bomb iran hasn't started to
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:35.480]  build a bomb uh iran is cooperating with the inspectors from the international atomic energy
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:41.800]  commission but they might at some time in the future decide to build a bomb and since we cannot
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:48.920]  live with a nuclear armed iran because they might give the technology to somebody like you go
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:56.200]  suvez therefore we have to attack and we have to attack now but we will do a surgical attack it
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:02.760]  won't be a regular attack it will be a surgical attack uh that we will leave uh or rand's uh
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:10.200]  nuclear uh a military intact so that they can retaliate against us now why if you're going to
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:15.640]  attack a country would you leave their military intact so they can retaliate but that's exactly
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:20.280]  what he's advocating we will not try to bring down the regime we will not try to hurt their
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:26.600]  military so they can attack us because they have to attack us to maintain credibility
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:33.640]  but then after we've absorbed their attack why their counterattack uh then we will tell them
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:40.920]  they simply cool it everything's got to be fine uh we'll go on as it was before without ever
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:47.080]  falling to consider what would happen if if iran we say to uh sink one of our carriers or two of
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:53.000]  our carriers and kill a couple of thousand people what would our leaders do at that time
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.720]  uh this gentleman talks about in his experience he's a relatively young man
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:04.040]  he has he forgotten what happened during the first world war when it was just supposed to be
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:10.120]  just a very very temporary war suddenly uh everybody anticipated the war war was gonna
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:15.560]  only last for a few weeks or a few months people were talking about korea with the
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:23.880]  slogan our boys will be home by christmas that was 1950 we are still at war with iran with north
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:32.920]  korea our our troops are still stationed in south korea um 60 70 years later 60 years later
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:42.360]  this gentleman is a man who makes major decisions he was a senior advisor to the secretary of defense
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:50.440]  he is currently the the stratum the nuclear security fellow at the council on formal relations a
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:57.000]  professor at georgetown university and he is telling us in my experience you know i don't
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:03.480]  think the retaliation will be too bad how can he be certain that this won't trigger a major war
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:10.040]  what he says i think it won't well we can't have people saying i think and yet he points out that
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:16.200]  other people in the key positions like denise ross who you pointed out was a member of the
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:21.560]  trilateral commission you look at the current list he's not listed there but he was listed before
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:26.360]  when you join government you when you go into a key position the state department
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:32.600]  you have to resign from the uh trilateral commission's temporarily which denise ross did but
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:38.520]  denise ross is saying exactly the same thing representing the trilateral commission and
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:45.880]  so by the way doc i was talking off record to a major media figure and he was telling me how
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:51.880]  he's been in newsrooms and seen them say kill that ron paul story uh say he can't win and
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:45:00.280]  he was telling me how most of the big national radio host because he's seeing he was giving
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:07.160]  me names everything it's it's delayed more than 15 seconds not for callers but that they even delay
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.440]  most the big national talk show host whenever they don't like what they're saying and i said well
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.880]  what are they and he he said well there's only about 30 things and i said what you mean cuss words
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:24.760]  he goes no you can't say trilateral commission cfr new world order now now if those things weren't real
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:30.040]  why don't talk about it well see and then if anybody ever calls in limbaugh laughs about it
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:35.160]  that's because that's the real government and look the u n this week admitted global government
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:40.760]  said they want a world tax they've stalled us this whole time now we've been proven right
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:47.720]  and it's just incredible it's just incredible well i think you're doing a great job of waking
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:53.080]  people up i know an awful lot of people in our area listen to your programs and people
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:59.320]  are be realize what's going on uh we just have to reach a lot more people in a short period of time
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:05.080]  because i like you sense that we're moving into a very very difficult period i think it's going
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:10.280]  to be this year i don't know what's going to happen i think there will probably be a war of
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:16.520]  some sort with it ran but i think as you point out it's going to be used to justify implementing
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:24.760]  the the police state it really is planned there really are female camps uh there really is the
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:32.360]  there really are militarizing our police they're preparing the police to work with the federal
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:37.960]  government to establish a dictatorship that's what the national defense appropriations act was all
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:43.480]  about where christin was said you know something that they can arrest anyone that's declared to be
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:48.840]  a terrorist and when they wanted to amend that and say well but this will not include american
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:55.320]  citizens that was voted down they would not allow that to be included they know exactly what they're
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:02.840]  doing but this is not allowed to be certainly mentioned on radio or television as you said in
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:10.920]  fact many years ago i was on a talk show opposite studio with jimmy sent up in san francisco i think
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:18.440]  i can say that now because he's long since retired but oh this was 25 30 years ago and he set off the
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:26.600]  air you know if anybody if i went on this radio and i said what i really believe about what's going
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:34.440]  on i would be fired tomorrow we went back on the air and he said if anybody told me what to say on
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:42.040]  this radio station not walk out of here right now and he looked over at me smiled and waked that's
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:49.240]  the way what's really going on in america and time people understood that the media is controlled
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:55.560]  in fact everything every aspect of our society is controlled uh but fortunately for the first
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:02.200]  time now we have alternative radio we have uh the internet the center we have short wave
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:09.160]  people are waking up across america i think it's amazing rawn wall rawn paul is doing as well as
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:17.560]  he is um sunday remember he's only really dealing with republicans almost half of the american people
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:23.640]  are registered as independents and they're not going to vote for the republican candidate if rawn
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.600]  paul were to get the nomination he would pick up a majority of the independents i honestly believe
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:35.640]  that and an awful lot of the democrats who don't want another senseless war because when you start
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:43.400]  a war you never know how it's going to end and the our leaders are intent upon starting a war
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:52.040]  with iran anticipating a retaliation and what happens if the iranians love a hundred vessels
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:57.320]  at israel or a thousand well it's perfect israel gets to attack them the moolas stay in power
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:01.960]  forever every study shows that'll empower them in the west they can take more of our rights and
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:08.040]  liberties tyrants everywhere get power out of a war war is the health of the state and we're
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:14.040]  fighting status insiders and the globalist have stolen over 27 trillion dollars in the last few
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.280]  years from the us alone and they're going to keep doing it because they can always blow stuff up
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:24.520]  and blame it on the on on their opposition and and that's how it works and you got a lot of dumb
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:29.960]  down control freaks that like their black uniforms doctor well do you know the interesting thing is
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.360]  right now of course the people of iran are very unhappy with their government there's a tremendous
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:40.680]  amount of unrest but if we were to attack iran which i think is what is planned then that's
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:47.240]  what this whole idea of time to strike iran this lead article in foreign affairs is all about and
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:53.080]  what Dennis Ross and the other trilateralists are talking about but if we were to attack iran
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:59.720]  it would unite the iranian people behind the moolas not only that but i fear it would unite
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:05.160]  of the two branches the major branches of three major branches the muslim faith the
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:11.560]  of the sufi the sunni and the shia against the common enemy maybe the the shias and the sunnis
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:19.320]  don't like one another but if we were to get to attack iran i think we would unite the entire
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:26.200]  muslim world which incidentally we are uniting we're behind all of these revolts going on over
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:34.280]  there we these countries one after another are falling under the control of the muslim brotherhood
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:41.320]  who is the muslim brotherhood why was organized by american and british intelligence agencies in
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:49.320]  1928 we have a book called the devil's game goes into the background of how it was the british
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:56.440]  mi6 that organized the muslim brotherhood back in 1928 and the sure the whole thing stay there we

[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:09.480]  news on that front now actually we were able to find the document dr monteef's talking about
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:13.960]  that i guess he might have been sent beforehand this is actually on the council on foreign
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:19.400]  relations own website cfr.org i can show people watching on prison planet dot tv a document

[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:46.680]  that um and then the former head guy at the department of defense under sec def breaking
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:54.760]  it down and yeah here they are publicly what about gary hart writing that letter uh to akma
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:59.960]  denigit saying our government will stage a gulf of tonketer main don't think we won't attack you
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:04.760]  a public letter what about all these obama advisors like robert shapiro in the financial times of
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:11.080]  london saying well that in oklahoma city or 9 11 to blame on obama's opposition he's not going to
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:17.000]  win reelection and then internal memos that have gone public where they're like sir we need one it's
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.760]  like that famous audio that got leaked of the six former generals that were all the uh pundits on
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:28.600]  news shows and an aide recorded it where they're like they're like secretary rimsfeld we need a new
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:34.360]  9 11 they will not listen he's like i know but it's hard why do they even release that i mean
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:40.520]  dr monteef they come within one inch over and over again these days from just admitting
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:46.520]  they're doing it they act like we're children clapper they had a national security he's in the
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:51.240]  in in white paper saying we need a provocation with iran i mean they act like we that we're
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:54.600]  not reading what they're saying it's like all the books are in the library but nobody reads
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:57:00.760]  you're absolutely right and the thing is that they have totaled us dame for us common people
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:06.120]  because they don't think we're smart enough or already care enough i mean they keep us entertained
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:13.000]  we have the super bowl we have Madonna dancing there at the at the at the super bowl of vulgar
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:20.040]  display you know and certainly if this is our now i mean i love football but certainly i i object to
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:26.840]  the to the the the the violence of so many of the much the watching a disgusting globalist
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:33.080]  in a in a luciferian outfit prance around it was pathetic but to see that the thing is
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:39.800]  is a alexis you've recognized the spirits and components of this and i do as well the average
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:45.320]  individual doesn't they look upon this that is democrat republican right left conservative
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:50.680]  liberal they look upon this thing from a geopolitical point of view without understanding
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:58.040]  that there are spiritual forces behind the scenes if you read what matthew crony says and this
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:04.440]  publication that you're displaying there on the screen why it doesn't make sense i mean here is
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:10.360]  an intelligent articulate individual who's talking about you know well we know that after there's
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:17.000]  an attack there's going to be retaliation we'll be prepared to absorb the retaliation then we'll
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.080]  try to certainly quiet things down afterwards what makes him think for one minute that's at the
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:28.920]  you that's because they're going to blow stuff up if iran doesn't guaranteed because the real target
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:34.200]  is us the american people that's why they're going to stage this dr monteev let's talk to you again

[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:54.520]  like combat uniforms with the exception of they were not wearing the helmets they did not have mc
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:02:02.200]  16 and instead of camo it was all green i mean it was it was crazy they were lining

[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:36.040]  and they train for war with us and they work for the foreign banks and they've done a superb job

[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:51.480]  had fbi people send me documents i know there's good people in the government but that's in the
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:58.520]  lower strata up top they ship tens of thousands of guns to mexico to control the drug war to get
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:03.320]  the drug shipped in and to blame the second amendment and i told you that six years ago now
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:11.560]  it's on record i told you holder would play the card that bush was involved in a similar things he
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:17.960]  did play it because i knew that's why is it can't bring down obama that's why they can't bring down
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:23.000]  mf global that's why they can't punish any of these people because it's all a bunch of crux
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:31.480]  and when you reach the point where the whole top echelon is crux are on the take and nobody can
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:36.680]  bust anybody you know low-level crooks are like hey you're running child kidnapping rings i don't

[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:10.760]  glenn beck uh convert i enrolled in your prison war and dumped back in the other corporate heads
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:15.960]  behind um and i kind of had two quick questions for you i think i'm going to skip the one because
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:23.240]  you seem kind of wound up today so uh the uh my question really is it seems like they're
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:28.040]  setting people up to fight you know and they want them to fight you know they want them out in the
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:34.200]  street so then they can take control but my real question is do you think that they may bite off
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:38.440]  more than they can chew uh or do you think no they're gonna sit off sure the cops are gonna
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:42.440]  bite off more than they can chew but they're dumb cannon fodder according to Henry Kissinger
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:48.280]  and they like it they'll all bite off more than they can chew but they don't care all they care
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:54.120]  about is ego they like walking around and people being scared of them they like shooting their
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:59.720]  kids up with mercury they like cps taking people's kids no due process they like violating the law
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:04.200]  so they're going to have it violated on them and uh of course the the whole plan of the
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:09.640]  new rulers to bite off more than they can chew and then get humanity in such a crisis that they
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:14.760]  can then prance around as the saviors to take even more freedom and consolidate even more power
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:21.960]  so then do you feel that even if uh we would manage to push back the technocrite equipped
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:27.560]  brown shirts that the un would just swoop in and there's just really not much hope of fighting this
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:33.400]  back well just know this it's public plan now to use un forces and mexican and canadian troops
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:38.680]  during quote battles with extremists and i don't know if it's going to come to that but i mean the
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:42.440]  bankers aren't going to stop they're going to keep bankrupting everything shutting everything down
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:47.480]  paying companies to leave hiring more people telling them grow mustaches so they can act tough i mean
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:52.360]  it's just an army of people in black uniforms with mustaches waddling around fighting imaginary
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:57.400]  terrorists while their bosses are jacking their water with sodium fluoride and their food with
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:02.200]  bisphenol and they don't care because they get to have mustaches so much it's we should understand
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:06.520]  this is all about wearing mustaches and acting tough i mean it's literally a big joke it's like

[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:10.520]  over the years who were on record being there where the fbi said we'll kill your family if you
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:16.520]  talk about what you saw i mean i wish the fbi wasn't telling cops will kill your family believe me i

[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:35.080]  it but again the reason we're gonna beat them is they can't stop themselves they're gonna steal
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:44.600]  everything and my message is already gone out and everybody's gonna know who did it so you go ahead

[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:37.480]  the prosecutor one in round rock knew the guy he sent to prison was innocent and didn't even have
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:41.240]  that much of a criminal record i like they're saying well he's a bad guy so we're doing this
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:45.960]  that's the road to hell's path with that type of activity but but then they try to keep them in

[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:23.000]  for a lot of you this is just entertaining radio and tv
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:28.200]  and for some others most of you you're you're aware stuff's bad but still i don't think it's
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:34.120]  here between the eyes for me i'm in the front lines every day i think about this when i dream
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:39.720]  i think about it when i read books to my children when they're going to sleep at night and how i've
[02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:47.960]  had to risk their lives and their future to tell the truth i am bitter i am angry because the world
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:53.240]  is a beautiful good place full of really good things but good people not enough that you stand
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:34:01.080]  up against corruption and it it it it really tears my guts out because it's not a feeling of fear of
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:09.240]  the new world order it's a feeling of disgust it's so ridiculous it's like watching somebody's house
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:13.160]  burned down with their kids in it and you come to their door and say get out and they're like
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:23.240]  there's no fire as their hair burns off it it's just it's a bad nightmare and you know i get up
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:29.160]  here and i joke around some and stuff and then i get mad at myself because the magnitude of this
[02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:36.840]  information is so much crazier than i could even describe and i listened to the show sometimes
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:41.240]  on the rebroadcast and i didn't make all the points i wanted to make i i didn't cover all the news i
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:47.320]  wanted to cover i just don't feel worthy to even be bringing you this information but i've just
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:53.720]  decided to stop caring and i'm going to let it all hang out because i'm just doing the best i can
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:04.520]  but we have a horrible case of tyranny and i'm going to your call so i want to i want to boil
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:09.960]  it down to this this is nothing but slavery governments have figured out how to repackage
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:15.400]  slavery they ship in addictive chemicals they then sell them to you when you get addicted
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:20.360]  they put you in private prisons that they own and tax the public to pay for it
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:30.200]  they take people's children now outside of law and sell them we are farmed by the criminal class
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:37.560]  and i declare independence against it and i see it you know they there's passages in the bible where
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:44.600]  says uh the the beginning of knowledge is sorrow guys i forget what passage that is will you search
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:51.080]  engine the beginning of knowledge is sorrow bible passage and i remember being in sunday
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:56.600]  school as a kid not knowing what that meant well knowledge and that's going to be great i know why
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:01.000]  people don't want to stand up against evil because you start looking into it you're like whoa that's
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.920]  scary that's creepy knowing about this is sorrow people say kids should be more positive the most
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:14.120]  positive thing i can do is attack these people in savagely in an info war i mean i am waging war
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:20.360]  with the truth i am attacking with everything i've got i'm not the best manager i'm not the best
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:25.560]  orator i'm not the best filmmaker any of that but i've had a big effect because i am fighting hard
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:33.000]  and i am honing my skills but at the end of the day i can't even sit here and and give eloquent
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:38.600]  perfect calm speeches all the time i do sometimes because a photo can freak me out
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:43.880]  or reading about where they're taking somebody's kids because they didn't vaccinate and i know there's
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:47.960]  not a law in that state but i still look it up and i know there isn't and i see a bunch of cops and
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:54.120]  black uniforms with little freaky mustaches dragging the parents off and i just i just want to defend
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:37:03.480]  those people i just i see organized crime organized gangs hurting us and lying to themselves while
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:12.360]  they're doing it and it every bit of my manhood is try to reach out to these people that serve
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:17.880]  evil and wake them up maybe they're just dumb and then even after all the evil world government
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:24.120]  un tax global banker takeover secret arrest of citizens total surveillance poison the food and
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:31.480]  water with all the documents how they're doing it still it just moves forward and you tell people
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:37.400]  this they're like oh thanks for what you do i'm like what are you doing i mean i don't think i'm
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:42.920]  doing enough being assaulted i think i need to sue the city of austin i've i've hinted for you to do
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:49.080]  it they put sodium fluoride a toxic waste in your water along with hundreds of other chemicals
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:57.000]  and they pay a million bucks a year or more we've gotten the bills we've gotten from the city
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:02.600]  to maybe pay for it and this goes for all the other cities i mean we should be suing the mayor
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:08.920]  suing the city manager suing the water department and you're like well the courts are corrupt no
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:13.080]  you'll start getting some headway we're getting it pulled out all over the country a lot of times
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:17.640]  it's when suits get do get filed and the states come in and say well we're gonna make you now
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:23.080]  will you change the legislature well there's a vote fraud will you change that i mean you know
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:27.640]  i mean you know somebody assaulting you and putting stuff in your water
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:35.400]  under common law you can do a lot more than sue somebody i blew my voice out later just growling
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:41.320]  with hatred the ending of sorrow is the beginning of wisdom no it's another quote
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:50.360]  the ending of sorrow the beginning of wisdom no there's another quote or a or a variant of it
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:52.760]  fear of god's the beginning of wisdom
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:01.800]  the point is it doesn't matter i'm gonna go to your calls quickly now i got to finish up
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:06.440]  uh josh in california you were you were talking to you the person in the military
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:13.080]  the part or or or the department of defense person go ahead yeah my uncle he previously
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:18.520]  worked in the pentagon doing radio he was one of those radio guys in vietnam running around
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:25.240]  with radio pack on you know which later led him to be a career intelligence um communications
[02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:31.160]  i guess is what it's called and um so i'd always asking questions about different technology or
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:36.920]  this and that and over time my questions progressed into uh more political things especially after
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:44.680]  seeing you and this and that okay what do you say after 9 11 after 9 11 he um really said to me
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:53.960]  that oh there's some bad people in there and he was referring to really just um the pentagon
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:59.160]  in general so to ask him you know about anything he might know or this and that and he said you
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:05.400]  know there's really some bad people in there now and he seems scared it seemed really different to
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:10.760]  me than anything else before like where he was proud about you know hiding something cool from me
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:16.600]  you know what i mean well you know why it's all come out they've had fbi uh intelligence people
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:23.560]  like civil evidence come out and she heard al qaeda under pentagon command on 9 11 on 9 11 and she
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:30.280]  said they're they're shipping kids guns and weapons uh and and drugs i mean look look look look look
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:39.080]  i have multiple family members who were in the army and then got recruited by the cia for domestic
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:46.040]  operations and said no once they got into it that's a lie that you can't ever get out you know that
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:50.760]  that's another mind control idea that oh you never get out oh i never get out then you told me so
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:57.880]  so and they wanted them to kill people and deal drugs i mean who do you think does the hits it's
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:03.720]  it's army officers that's their favorite group to recruit from that's why that was you know whenever we
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:10.760]  get um dr pacinica and he's like i'm tired of hearing about these seals all day it's the army
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:18.280]  that's actually doing the work but they don't talk about it yeah no kidding uh so i mean and again
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:24.040]  it's not like people like who who someone was a hitman for the cia who that's like saying oh you
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:30.840]  were a delivery driver uh for frito lay i mean they got tens of thousands of hitmen
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:38.200]  i i i mean who do you think runs 500 billion in drugs a year it sure isn't you know the mexican
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:50.600]  mafia the russian mafias fsb that's on record the mafia is just one lower level of criminals
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:57.960]  that work for the big banks so you're saying he's scared now josh well i'm saying you really
[02:41:57.960 --> 02:42:03.000]  well i wouldn't say now i don't i don't know how he directly feels this was after 9 11 that i could
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:08.760]  really see a change in his attitude towards what was going on inside where he was getting his
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:14.200]  information from and then the next thanksgiving this wasn't the internet i'm getting this information
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:23.000]  from he tells me about um how they want to put in um i d cards to pass from state to state and
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:27.640]  then a next thanksgiving comes three years later or something and i get information about oh don't
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:33.080]  vote for obama he was working with a terrorist organization quote unquote i didn't believe this
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:38.520]  but later on i see you know i can't stay at the glenn beck talk about um the weatherman underground
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:43.560]  and i said i really don't know the weatherman underground were all government too exactly it

[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:46.840]  we see the collapse around us and most people want to muddle through it and act like we're
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:50.360]  just going to get through it you just said it you just crystallize it that's why i should take
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:55.880]  more calls they're getting ready for iran war and admitting it russia and china are threatening to
[02:43:55.880 --> 02:44:01.720]  respond and everybody's just totally calm because the super bowl was on we've just gotten used to it
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:07.080]  and they do that on purpose sticking their hands down our pants it's to make us get used to incredible
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:12.440]  garbage sorry go ahead that's okay it's all out in the open i mean they don't need to hide it anymore
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:18.120]  and what we're dealing with is something that's way older than america something that is so deep
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:24.680]  rooted in human history that i mean honestly we need to have real solutions at this point i mean
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:28.200]  i'm not trying to rally you up there or say that i totally respect what you're doing but

[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:34.360]  dollars but i want to win just like you wanted the giants to win the super bowl that meant so
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:40.600]  much to you i want to defeat tyranny one thousand times that feeling okay i'm fighting this enough
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:46.520]  to be ready to be demonized and attacked and laughed at and to have people physically attack me
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:52.440]  and death threat my family i'm willing to face murdering killers who torture children to death
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:58.760]  on record and don't get in trouble because i know it's got to be done okay you know about commitment
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:04.600]  so there is no silver bullet other than repenting to god and they did find the bible verse what was
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:11.160]  the quote uh it's ecclesiasties i said to myself look i have increased in wisdom more than anyone
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:15.480]  who has ruled over jerusalem before me i've experienced much of wisdom and knowledge
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:20.680]  then i applied myself to the understanding of wisdom and also of madness and folly but i learned
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:28.680]  this too is chasing after the wind 18 for with much wisdom comes much sorrow the more knowledge
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:33.960]  the more grief oh man that's true i have to see all their crimes i have to know their minds
[02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:39.240]  and just they just go on and on and on and nothing ever stops them they just like maggots
[02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:44.280]  they're so weak and evil it's like little spindly legged demons sucking the soul out of people
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:49.480]  and and and in strong people lay there and let them suck their soul because they're afraid of them
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:56.280]  because they're wearing a uniform and some tin badge you've got the seal of the almighty creator

[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:42.760]  inside the government yeah no it's wouldn't wouldn't it be smart for people if they see something
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:47.880]  you know how the government says see something say something against you know we should report on
[03:00:47.880 --> 03:00:53.400]  each other shouldn't we if we're like a deli owner or a house owner or a business owner
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:58.360]  if we see government agents surrounding a building or checking out the surveillance
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:03.080]  maybe we should turn our cameras on no no that's what i meant to say we need to film
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:09.560]  government people and we do need to say something the problem is people warned about 9 11 when the
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:14.520]  feds are getting ready for it and we're ordered to shut up or killed including the former head of
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:20.440]  fbi anti-terror uh who they basically hired to run the security there who died in it uh john o'neill
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:28.040]  no we need no i'm exactly we need to know they're the terrorist it's people in uniform major defense

[03:01:33.560 --> 03:01:39.880]  take taken out the the uh federal buildings and stuff and i mean you see feds putting gray sticks
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:44.600]  of butter in there don't just think as they got security badges they're not but understand if you
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:49.240]  report it and your boss knows about the bombing they're just going to kill you uh and then throw
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:52.600]  you into the rubble the fact that happens at a lot of these events so you've got to get it out on
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:58.520]  youtube yourself and get it out before you tell superiors because they may be in on it and i'm
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:04.600]  not kidding i mean these are i mean we got terrorists running the country alex i'm i'm in a hundred

[03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:16.600]  the air at all that if we see something suspicious we need to film it and hold on to it not give it
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:23.000]  to homeland security not give it to the fbi hold on to it if we're wrong we're wrong but if something
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:29.240]  does happen then you know what it needs to come they confiscated the cameras on 9 11 from the pentagon
[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:35.000]  and world trade centers they confiscated them from oklahoma city and a good fbi agents told the la

[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:47.000]  real the government admits they have them again i'm not saying all the feds are bad but even they
[03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:54.200]  are told sit down and shut up i mean it's total proof they did it think about that
