[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You've got it
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.360]  Waging war on corruption
[00:09.360 --> 00:29.360]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[00:29.360 --> 00:34.360]  Welcome my friends, welcome to another live transmission
[00:34.360 --> 00:41.360]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, back Sundays 4 to 6
[00:41.360 --> 00:46.360]  and we attempt and in many cases have great success thanks to you spreading the word
[00:46.360 --> 00:50.360]  in setting brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[00:50.360 --> 00:56.360]  to be able to recognize the difference between liberty and slavery
[00:56.360 --> 01:00.360]  freedom and tyranny
[01:00.360 --> 01:04.360]  controlling your own destiny versus bondage
[01:04.360 --> 01:07.360]  and that's why I'm here
[01:07.360 --> 01:13.360]  we'd already lost a lot of our rights and liberties and basic freedoms and our sovereignty by the time I got on the air
[01:13.360 --> 01:20.360]  right at 17 years ago
[01:20.360 --> 01:26.360]  but today unfortunately
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.360]  the tyranny is of the most virulent organized type
[01:31.360 --> 01:34.360]  and it's because the corrupt ruling elite
[01:34.360 --> 01:39.360]  right at the point that they're taking over the world through financial Ponzi scheme frauds
[01:39.360 --> 01:43.360]  right as they engage in financial fraud based conquest
[01:43.360 --> 01:46.360]  the world is beginning to awaken
[01:46.360 --> 01:50.360]  and that awakening is beginning to accelerate
[01:50.360 --> 01:55.360]  and that is why the social controllers, the social engineers
[01:55.360 --> 02:00.360]  are openly overturning every cannon
[02:00.360 --> 02:06.360]  every bedrock value of freedom not just here in the United States but worldwide
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.360]  and now in Russia, in China, in Saudi Arabia even
[02:11.360 --> 02:17.360]  in other nations they marvel at the police state and use the United States now
[02:17.360 --> 02:24.360]  as an excuse to carry out the horrible repression that many of those countries are engaged in
[02:24.360 --> 02:28.360]  so when we come back from break I'm going to attempt
[02:28.360 --> 02:30.360]  and you know what it doesn't mean I'm always successful at
[02:30.360 --> 02:34.360]  I'm going to attempt to go over
[02:34.360 --> 02:37.360]  the fact that the time for denial is over
[02:37.360 --> 02:39.360]  there's no excuse to live in denial
[02:39.360 --> 02:43.360]  and the time for action is here
[02:43.360 --> 02:46.360]  in every way
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.360]  tyranny with a capital T and all that that word means is here
[02:52.360 --> 02:56.360]  but like judo we can use this assault as
[02:56.360 --> 03:00.360]  a way to really get a lot more people to awaken and take action
[03:00.360 --> 03:04.360]  the system likes to just sell tyranny and corruption and oppression and control
[03:04.360 --> 03:08.360]  with a velvet glove over the iron fist and have people acquiesce
[03:08.360 --> 03:11.360]  they don't like to have to come out
[03:11.360 --> 03:21.360]  with open, brazen, hubris, hutsma-filled, arrogant
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.360]  baseline oppression
[03:25.360 --> 03:31.360]  they're only doing this because their in game is threatened
[03:31.360 --> 03:34.360]  because they are weak
[03:34.360 --> 03:40.360]  we have massive news on now the open admissions of shutdown of the internet as we know it
[03:40.360 --> 03:44.360]  the end of the internet as we know it that's not even my headline
[03:44.360 --> 03:50.360]  that's the type of headlines we see in the Associated Press and MSNBC
[03:50.360 --> 03:52.360]  in the Hill newspaper
[03:52.360 --> 03:54.360]  in fact you guys pull me some of those from Thursday and Friday
[03:54.360 --> 03:57.360]  I want to show viewers on there when we get to those
[03:57.360 --> 03:59.360]  I don't want to just go from memory
[03:59.360 --> 04:01.360]  thank you
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.360]  and headlines like
[04:05.360 --> 04:07.360]  new internet bill
[04:07.360 --> 04:10.360]  free speech kill switch
[04:10.360 --> 04:13.360]  saw that headline out of the Hill
[04:13.360 --> 04:19.360]  all of this is going on in fact I saw a headline in the weekly standard
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.360]  talking about the draconian attack on free speech in the internet
[04:23.360 --> 04:26.360]  and then there's a separate article out today
[04:26.360 --> 04:32.360]  attacking myself and Ron Paul out of the same publication saying we're crazy
[04:32.360 --> 04:36.360]  because we warn of tyranny
[04:36.360 --> 04:39.360]  and we warn of the military being used against the American people
[04:39.360 --> 04:42.360]  even as it's in CBS news and ABC news
[04:42.360 --> 04:46.360]  that the NDAA does affect US citizens
[04:46.360 --> 04:49.360]  and as the end of Posse commentators
[04:49.360 --> 04:54.360]  the weekly standard is saying we're basically crazy and none of this is going on
[04:54.360 --> 04:58.360]  I don't like the tanks assaulting Waco saying this is not an assault
[04:58.360 --> 05:03.360]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011
[05:03.360 --> 05:07.360]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[05:07.360 --> 05:09.360]  he says it will change everything about our lives
[05:09.360 --> 05:12.360]  the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children
[05:12.360 --> 05:15.360]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family
[05:15.360 --> 05:18.360]  now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[05:18.360 --> 05:20.360]  the crazy part is he's usually right
[05:20.360 --> 05:24.360]  you see he predicted the collapse of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac
[05:24.360 --> 05:27.360]  and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties
[05:27.360 --> 05:30.360]  in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[05:30.360 --> 05:33.360]  recently he created a video which you can watch online for free
[05:33.360 --> 05:36.360]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[05:36.360 --> 05:38.360]  and it's a real eye-opener
[05:38.360 --> 05:39.360]  I can't stress this enough
[05:39.360 --> 05:41.360]  you should at least watch this free video online today
[05:41.360 --> 05:43.360]  he explains everything you need to know
[05:43.360 --> 05:46.360]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[05:46.360 --> 05:50.360]  you can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[05:50.360 --> 05:53.360]  that's End of America, the number 3.com
[05:53.360 --> 05:57.360]  watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[05:57.360 --> 06:14.360]  you are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report
[06:14.360 --> 06:28.360]  from deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas
[06:28.360 --> 06:34.360]  transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones
[06:34.360 --> 06:38.360]  here we are my friends we're live
[06:38.360 --> 06:42.360]  we'll be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday afternoon
[06:42.360 --> 06:46.360]  or in the morning or in the middle of the night depending on your time zone
[06:46.360 --> 06:48.360]  where you're living in the world
[06:48.360 --> 06:52.360]  or any ships at sea tuning in to our transmission
[06:52.360 --> 06:56.360]  it is a 406 Central Standard Time
[06:56.360 --> 07:01.360]  I am broadcasting to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin
[07:01.360 --> 07:04.360]  as the introduction laid out
[07:04.360 --> 07:11.360]  and it is Sunday the 18th day of December 2011
[07:11.360 --> 07:18.360]  this is a very important broadcast today
[07:18.360 --> 07:21.360]  every broadcast I do the weekday show the Sunday show
[07:21.360 --> 07:23.360]  they're all very important
[07:23.360 --> 07:25.360]  they were important 17 years ago and I started out
[07:25.360 --> 07:28.360]  to try to warn people about globalization
[07:28.360 --> 07:32.360]  and this whole new order takeover system
[07:32.360 --> 07:36.360]  but now classical oppression
[07:36.360 --> 07:40.360]  classical usurpation
[07:40.360 --> 07:43.360]  the fact that our liberties are being usurped
[07:43.360 --> 07:45.360]  taken over, destroyed
[07:45.360 --> 07:47.360]  is undeniable
[07:47.360 --> 07:50.360]  and then you have to ask the question and do the research
[07:50.360 --> 07:56.360]  why is it happening and who is doing it
[07:56.360 --> 08:01.360]  my job is getting a lot easier
[08:01.360 --> 08:06.360]  it'd be basically like if you saw some kids playing on a train track
[08:06.360 --> 08:10.360]  and you walked out to them and said hey there's a train coming
[08:10.360 --> 08:14.360]  at high noon it's a bullet train travels 150 miles an hour
[08:14.360 --> 08:18.360]  you might want to get off the tracks it's really dangerous
[08:18.360 --> 08:21.360]  and they look at the old man it's three minutes to noon
[08:21.360 --> 08:25.360]  and they say I don't see any train mister
[08:25.360 --> 08:28.360]  alright I'm telling you it's gonna come over that hill here
[08:28.360 --> 08:31.360]  in just a few minutes and you'll have to jump out of the way
[08:31.360 --> 08:34.360]  it's moving so quick
[08:34.360 --> 08:37.360]  and a couple minutes later they start to hear a noise off of the distance
[08:37.360 --> 08:43.360]  and then sure enough there is the white light of its train light
[08:43.360 --> 08:46.360]  coming up over that hill going 150 miles an hour
[08:46.360 --> 08:48.360]  and will they jump out of the way of the train
[08:48.360 --> 08:50.360]  that is the question
[08:50.360 --> 08:52.360]  I've been telling you this train's coming
[08:52.360 --> 08:59.360]  and now it's barreling down the tracks right at us
[08:59.360 --> 09:01.360]  right at us
[09:01.360 --> 09:05.360]  you know I told you a decade ago that they would sell us
[09:05.360 --> 09:07.360]  the derivatives they were already selling
[09:07.360 --> 09:09.360]  they'd gotten rid of Glass-Steagall
[09:09.360 --> 09:11.360]  I guess 12 years ago I told you
[09:11.360 --> 09:13.360]  that they would implode the world economy
[09:13.360 --> 09:16.360]  first imploding Europe then Asia then the United States announced
[09:16.360 --> 09:20.360]  a new bank of the world that we would all pay our VAT and carbon taxes to
[09:20.360 --> 09:23.360]  and it wasn't because I had a crystal ball
[09:23.360 --> 09:26.360]  in my basement and I was consulting with Ouija boards
[09:26.360 --> 09:30.360]  no it was because the trilateral commission plan is public
[09:30.360 --> 09:34.360]  the State Department memorandum 200 is public
[09:34.360 --> 09:36.360]  the club of Rome's reports are public
[09:36.360 --> 09:40.360]  these globalists write books bragging to each other
[09:40.360 --> 09:42.360]  about what they're doing to us
[09:42.360 --> 09:44.360]  it's all very funny to them
[09:44.360 --> 09:47.360]  that the average male lives through other males
[09:47.360 --> 09:50.360]  that throw balls around on a field
[09:50.360 --> 09:53.360]  and doesn't actually have any real life themselves
[09:53.360 --> 09:56.360]  and just goes from work home drinks beer watches TV
[09:56.360 --> 09:59.360]  and their children are programmed by the television set
[09:59.360 --> 10:02.360]  their wives are and that is living on this planet today
[10:02.360 --> 10:05.360]  and I'm not judging people that live like that
[10:05.360 --> 10:08.360]  any more than I judge someone who's been lobotomized
[10:08.360 --> 10:12.360]  or put in under shock therapy or run over by a car
[10:12.360 --> 10:15.360]  these are victims of the social engineering
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.360]  and I've read the father of social engineering's books
[10:20.360 --> 10:23.360]  Edward Bernays I've studied Joseph Goebbels
[10:23.360 --> 10:27.360]  I know what they've done
[10:27.360 --> 10:29.360]  I know it's a conscious plan
[10:29.360 --> 10:32.360]  and I sit here saying okay this is what's going to happen next
[10:32.360 --> 10:35.360]  and here's all the documentation
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.360]  oh by the way here's a 1965 Rockefeller Foundation document
[10:39.360 --> 10:42.360]  it's up at info wars.com with links to the National Archives
[10:42.360 --> 10:44.360]  in case you don't believe it
[10:44.360 --> 10:47.360]  where they add sterilence to the vaccines and cancer viruses
[10:47.360 --> 10:51.360]  and their plan was to start reducing fertility
[10:51.360 --> 10:54.360]  and life expectancy and now you can see if that's happened
[10:54.360 --> 10:57.360]  but here's the document people are like you know that's too crazy
[10:57.360 --> 10:59.360]  that guy must be making that up
[10:59.360 --> 11:02.360]  most people at least the past would not even go to the website
[11:02.360 --> 11:05.360]  link it go read it and find out it's true
[11:05.360 --> 11:08.360]  I mean do you have children?
[11:08.360 --> 11:10.360]  are you just going to say it isn't true
[11:10.360 --> 11:12.360]  and line them up and take the vaccines
[11:12.360 --> 11:15.360]  because the government wouldn't be doing that
[11:15.360 --> 11:19.360]  kind of like 14 years ago when a nurse inside
[11:19.360 --> 11:22.360]  a department of defense lab
[11:22.360 --> 11:25.360]  and San Antonio sent me documents that for
[11:25.360 --> 11:28.360]  decades all children in the western world
[11:28.360 --> 11:31.360]  have their blood taken and put in secret databases for eugenics
[11:31.360 --> 11:34.360]  of course you know in the last four years it's national news
[11:34.360 --> 11:36.360]  I got a lot of apologies on that one
[11:36.360 --> 11:38.360]  well I gave you the documents at the time
[11:38.360 --> 11:40.360]  I got death threats over it
[11:40.360 --> 11:43.360]  I've had whistleblowers that give me information
[11:43.360 --> 11:46.360]  that end up dead repeatedly
[11:48.360 --> 11:50.360]  why am I still alive then
[11:50.360 --> 11:52.360]  I'm here awake and conscious
[11:52.360 --> 11:55.360]  and putting my life in God's hands
[11:55.360 --> 11:57.360]  and people are praying for me
[11:57.360 --> 11:59.360]  that's in the spiritual realm
[11:59.360 --> 12:01.360]  but in the temporal realm if they kill me
[12:01.360 --> 12:03.360]  and underlines everything I've said
[12:03.360 --> 12:05.360]  it highlights it in indelible
[12:05.360 --> 12:08.360]  yellow marker highlighter
[12:08.360 --> 12:10.360]  it puts a hundred a thousand
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.360]  exclamation points behind everything I've said
[12:14.360 --> 12:16.360]  but they still may
[12:16.360 --> 12:18.360]  so I'm committed
[12:18.360 --> 12:20.360]  because I know there's no future
[12:20.360 --> 12:22.360]  because I know more importantly
[12:22.360 --> 12:24.360]  that there's a world government run by the fortune 100
[12:24.360 --> 12:26.360]  I know what drives them
[12:26.360 --> 12:28.360]  their end game is not money
[12:28.360 --> 12:30.360]  and power and sex
[12:30.360 --> 12:33.360]  that's what they get the general public to sell out for
[12:35.360 --> 12:38.360]  at the highest levels these are highly
[12:38.360 --> 12:40.360]  dedicated people
[12:40.360 --> 12:42.360]  who are
[12:42.360 --> 12:44.360]  absolutely given to obsessive
[12:44.360 --> 12:46.360]  compulsive
[12:46.360 --> 12:48.360]  control freakism
[12:48.360 --> 12:50.360]  and who want their global
[12:50.360 --> 12:52.360]  takeover to be complete
[12:52.360 --> 12:54.360]  so that's why they want to dumb down the general population
[12:54.360 --> 12:56.360]  ahead of accelerated controlled
[12:56.360 --> 12:58.360]  plagues to forcibly reduce
[12:58.360 --> 13:00.360]  population by 80-90%
[13:00.360 --> 13:02.360]  as the UN club of Rome and others have stated
[13:02.360 --> 13:04.360]  and the weekly standard
[13:04.360 --> 13:06.360]  can come out and attack Ron Paul
[13:06.360 --> 13:08.360]  for coming on my show
[13:08.360 --> 13:10.360]  and talking about CIA drug dealing
[13:10.360 --> 13:12.360]  which has been in congressional reports and confirmed
[13:12.360 --> 13:14.360]  they can criticize him
[13:14.360 --> 13:16.360]  for being in the film Endgame
[13:16.360 --> 13:18.360]  where they say Jones is nuts
[13:18.360 --> 13:20.360]  he says the elite
[13:20.360 --> 13:22.360]  say they can live forever
[13:22.360 --> 13:24.360]  I'm not the crazy one
[13:24.360 --> 13:26.360]  I'm not the top globalist listed
[13:26.360 --> 13:28.360]  in the film with a bibliography
[13:28.360 --> 13:30.360]  at WhatIsTheEndgame.com
[13:30.360 --> 13:32.360]  where they say they're going to do this
[13:32.360 --> 13:34.360]  I'm not saying it's real
[13:34.360 --> 13:36.360]  I'm not saying that
[13:36.360 --> 13:38.360]  Lord Rothschild is going to attain this
[13:38.360 --> 13:40.360]  or Prince Philip
[13:40.360 --> 13:42.360]  or Prince Charles
[13:42.360 --> 13:44.360]  or
[13:44.360 --> 13:46.360]  the others
[13:46.360 --> 13:48.360]  that are in these reports
[13:48.360 --> 13:50.360]  Ray Kurzweil
[13:50.360 --> 13:52.360]  these are quotes from
[13:52.360 --> 13:54.360]  their books saying it
[13:54.360 --> 13:56.360]  see when I show
[13:56.360 --> 13:58.360]  you a UN document
[13:58.360 --> 14:00.360]  like the UN documents that are in Endgame
[14:00.360 --> 14:02.360]  and the UN document says once world government is established
[14:02.360 --> 14:04.360]  they won't just try to hold
[14:04.360 --> 14:06.360]  population at one point
[14:06.360 --> 14:08.360]  they will then try to massively reduce it
[14:08.360 --> 14:10.360]  with controlled airborne Ebola and things
[14:10.360 --> 14:12.360]  as Dr. Pionka
[14:12.360 --> 14:14.360]  at UT talked about
[14:14.360 --> 14:16.360]  and made national news four years ago
[14:16.360 --> 14:18.360]  and so we need a world police state
[14:18.360 --> 14:20.360]  to carry out the 90% reduction
[14:22.360 --> 14:24.360]  and then all this creepy stuff about
[14:24.360 --> 14:26.360]  the time will soon be at hand
[14:26.360 --> 14:28.360]  we must prepare
[14:28.360 --> 14:30.360]  this is a guy that wins international awards
[14:30.360 --> 14:32.360]  from the UN and others
[14:32.360 --> 14:34.360]  and get standing ovations when he talks about this
[14:36.360 --> 14:38.360]  in this control freak cult that they're part of
[14:38.360 --> 14:40.360]  I report on that
[14:40.360 --> 14:42.360]  at Endgame and show clips of him
[14:42.360 --> 14:44.360]  and clips of his papers
[14:44.360 --> 14:46.360]  and what does the weekly standard do
[14:46.360 --> 14:48.360]  they run out
[14:48.360 --> 14:50.360]  with this article
[14:50.360 --> 14:52.360]  the company Ron Paul keeps next sub headline
[14:52.360 --> 14:54.360]  meet Alex Jones
[14:56.360 --> 14:58.360]  and it says here
[14:58.360 --> 15:00.360]  oh my gosh Ron Paul was just on Alex's show
[15:00.360 --> 15:02.360]  this week I'm going to read this later
[15:02.360 --> 15:04.360]  we're going to re-hear the Ron Paul interview at least part of it
[15:04.360 --> 15:06.360]  it literally got picked up by hundreds of newspapers
[15:06.360 --> 15:08.360]  because it was powerful
[15:08.360 --> 15:10.360]  it said oh my gosh
[15:10.360 --> 15:12.360]  Ron Paul came on and talked about
[15:12.360 --> 15:14.360]  Northcom and the US military
[15:14.360 --> 15:16.360]  and enemy
[15:16.360 --> 15:18.360]  combatants for US citizens
[15:18.360 --> 15:20.360]  and he's nuts
[15:20.360 --> 15:22.360]  it says Alex Jones is the biggest
[15:22.360 --> 15:24.360]  conspiracy theory in the world
[15:24.360 --> 15:26.360]  except for maybe Ron Paul
[15:26.360 --> 15:28.360]  they have this little fake epiphany of
[15:28.360 --> 15:30.360]  oh no there's one bigger it's Ron Paul
[15:30.360 --> 15:32.360]  he's Obi Wan Kenobi
[15:32.360 --> 15:34.360]  the Luke Skywalker
[15:34.360 --> 15:36.360]  ladies and gentlemen
[15:36.360 --> 15:38.360]  I have CBS news
[15:38.360 --> 15:40.360]  USA Today all right here
[15:40.360 --> 15:42.360]  saying military on the streets of America
[15:42.360 --> 15:44.360]  arresting citizens forever
[15:44.360 --> 15:46.360]  it's national news
[15:46.360 --> 15:48.360]  and they're saying no Alex Jones and Ron Paul
[15:48.360 --> 15:50.360]  are insane
[15:50.360 --> 15:52.360]  we're going to come back with the internet censorship
[15:52.360 --> 15:54.360]  bill in your face
[15:54.360 --> 15:56.360]  the inventors of the internet

[20:32.360 --> 20:34.360]  alright, here is what we're gonna do
[20:34.360 --> 20:36.360]  what do you mean I don't suppose
[20:36.360 --> 20:39.360]  I am going to cover the open announcement
[20:39.360 --> 20:42.360]  that the worldwide, the UN
[20:42.360 --> 20:44.360]  along with the federal government, the US
[20:44.360 --> 20:48.360]  is going to openly start censoring the internet
[20:48.360 --> 20:51.360]  we're gonna break that down
[20:51.360 --> 20:53.360]  and we're gonna get into
[20:53.360 --> 20:55.360]  the National Defense Authorization Act
[20:55.360 --> 20:57.360]  that Obama has said that he will sign
[20:57.360 --> 20:59.360]  after saying he wouldn't sign it
[20:59.360 --> 21:01.360]  and of course it's now come out
[21:01.360 --> 21:04.360]  from all of the cosponsors and authors
[21:04.360 --> 21:08.360]  Carl Levin, John McCain, Lindsey Graham
[21:08.360 --> 21:11.360]  all US senators, the clips are up at infowars.com
[21:11.360 --> 21:14.360]  Drugs report had it linked to front page for two days
[21:14.360 --> 21:16.360]  millions of people watch the videos
[21:16.360 --> 21:19.360]  of them all saying Obama told us to add
[21:19.360 --> 21:22.360]  the provision to have military on the streets
[21:22.360 --> 21:25.360]  of America and to secretly arrest citizens
[21:25.360 --> 21:28.360]  and to have citizens disappear
[21:28.360 --> 21:30.360]  meanwhile the ACLU was running around
[21:30.360 --> 21:33.360]  saying Obama was against it
[21:33.360 --> 21:35.360]  I was telling you three weeks ago
[21:35.360 --> 21:37.360]  no, here is the letters from Obama's lawyers
[21:37.360 --> 21:40.360]  saying he doesn't particularly like the bill
[21:40.360 --> 21:43.360]  because he already has the power without Congress
[21:43.360 --> 21:45.360]  remember he launched wars without Congress
[21:45.360 --> 21:47.360]  so at the end of the day though
[21:47.360 --> 21:49.360]  he said he's gonna sign it because
[21:49.360 --> 21:51.360]  well if you wanna go ahead and give me
[21:51.360 --> 21:53.360]  the editorial powers and say I have them
[21:53.360 --> 21:54.360]  which is what the bill says
[21:54.360 --> 21:57.360]  it says the president can kill any citizen he wants
[21:57.360 --> 21:59.360]  do anything is the furor
[21:59.360 --> 22:02.360]  now I wanna be clear about this
[22:02.360 --> 22:06.360]  just because the president says
[22:06.360 --> 22:07.360]  that he's God
[22:07.360 --> 22:10.360]  just because the Congress says he's our furor
[22:10.360 --> 22:12.360]  that means our leader
[22:12.360 --> 22:15.360]  just because the North Koreans call Kim Jong-il
[22:15.360 --> 22:17.360]  dear leader, dear furor
[22:17.360 --> 22:20.360]  doesn't mean that
[22:20.360 --> 22:22.360]  he's above the law
[22:22.360 --> 22:24.360]  doesn't mean he's not a degenerate criminal
[22:24.360 --> 22:26.360]  protected by an armed gang
[22:26.360 --> 22:28.360]  called the North Korean military
[22:28.360 --> 22:30.360]  now Obama himself is a puppet
[22:30.360 --> 22:32.360]  a teleprompter reading puppet
[22:32.360 --> 22:34.360]  but the office of the presidency
[22:34.360 --> 22:36.360]  and the foreign banking interests
[22:36.360 --> 22:38.360]  that bankrolled him and others
[22:38.360 --> 22:40.360]  and they're bankrolling Mitt Romney and Newt Gennrich
[22:40.360 --> 22:42.360]  and demonizing Ron Paul
[22:42.360 --> 22:44.360]  and brainwashing the public that Ron Paul can't win
[22:44.360 --> 22:46.360]  even though in some polls he's number one in Iowa
[22:46.360 --> 22:52.360]  and New Hampshire
[22:52.360 --> 22:54.360]  just because their puppet
[22:54.360 --> 22:56.360]  is being endowed now
[22:56.360 --> 22:58.360]  with these false powers
[22:58.360 --> 23:00.360]  doesn't mean they're constitutional
[23:00.360 --> 23:03.360]  what, 180 years ago or so
[23:03.360 --> 23:06.360]  the Supreme Court ruled black people weren't humans
[23:06.360 --> 23:08.360]  and folks didn't like that
[23:08.360 --> 23:10.360]  so later ruling they said well okay
[23:10.360 --> 23:15.360]  they're two-thirds human
[23:15.360 --> 23:17.360]  now
[23:17.360 --> 23:19.360]  they had laws where if a black man
[23:19.360 --> 23:21.360]  didn't pull a plow right you could kill him
[23:21.360 --> 23:23.360]  now does the black man have a right
[23:23.360 --> 23:25.360]  200 years ago
[23:25.360 --> 23:27.360]  in a sugar cane field in Cuba
[23:27.360 --> 23:29.360]  or in Alabama
[23:29.360 --> 23:31.360]  to grab the
[23:31.360 --> 23:33.360]  bull whip away and beat
[23:33.360 --> 23:35.360]  his would-be master over the head with it
[23:35.360 --> 23:37.360]  yes organic galactic
[23:37.360 --> 23:39.360]  common law
[23:39.360 --> 23:41.360]  organic law universal law
[23:41.360 --> 23:43.360]  says yes
[23:43.360 --> 23:45.360]  because the Nazis had laws
[23:45.360 --> 23:47.360]  saying Hitler could kill anybody he wanted to
[23:47.360 --> 23:49.360]  and they could come to your house and arrest you
[23:49.360 --> 23:51.360]  and disappear you doesn't mean
[23:51.360 --> 23:53.360]  that it's legitimate
[23:53.360 --> 23:55.360]  you see we had a rule of law
[23:55.360 --> 23:57.360]  a bill of rights and constitution
[23:57.360 --> 23:59.360]  that said
[23:59.360 --> 24:01.360]  that it wasn't just your right
[24:01.360 --> 24:03.360]  it was your duty
[24:03.360 --> 24:05.360]  Declaration of Independence
[24:05.360 --> 24:07.360]  to physically
[24:07.360 --> 24:09.360]  attack anyone
[24:09.360 --> 24:11.360]  who tried to take your life for liberty
[24:11.360 --> 24:13.360]  and government was so afraid of the population
[24:13.360 --> 24:15.360]  for hundreds of years in this country
[24:15.360 --> 24:17.360]  that despite the fact that we weren't perfect
[24:17.360 --> 24:19.360]  we were the freest nation ever
[24:19.360 --> 24:21.360]  known and produced the most wealth
[24:23.360 --> 24:25.360]  Mexico has tripled the natural resources
[24:25.360 --> 24:27.360]  on average according to CIA fact
[24:27.360 --> 24:29.360]  book and other perspectives than the
[24:29.360 --> 24:31.360]  United States but
[24:31.360 --> 24:33.360]  can't produce one-tenth the wealth why because
[24:33.360 --> 24:35.360]  there's no freedom there's a tiny elite
[24:35.360 --> 24:37.360]  same thing with all these other countries
[24:37.360 --> 24:39.360]  but now you notice as the liberties
[24:39.360 --> 24:41.360]  are gotten rid of the prosperity
[24:41.360 --> 24:43.360]  is going out the window let me ask you
[24:43.360 --> 24:45.360]  how do you like the fruits of the new world order
[24:45.360 --> 24:47.360]  of NAFTA of GATT of globalism
[24:47.360 --> 24:49.360]  of the TSA of the everything
[24:49.360 --> 24:51.360]  changed after 9-11
[24:51.360 --> 24:53.360]  and all the bull of buying into that official
[24:53.360 --> 24:55.360]  story I mean even if you believe 9-11
[24:55.360 --> 24:57.360]  was as they said it was they certainly use it
[24:57.360 --> 24:59.360]  to take the general public's rights
[24:59.360 --> 25:01.360]  to launch illegal wars
[25:01.360 --> 25:03.360]  to lie about WMD's to bankrupt
[25:03.360 --> 25:05.360]  the country the United States
[25:05.360 --> 25:07.360]  is run by corporate interest
[25:07.360 --> 25:09.360]  that are anti-free market use government
[25:09.360 --> 25:11.360]  to shut down their competition and who are
[25:11.360 --> 25:13.360]  anti-family and anti-independence
[25:13.360 --> 25:15.360]  on every front and openly
[25:15.360 --> 25:17.360]  fund the environmental land grabbers
[25:17.360 --> 25:19.360]  the carbon taxers all of it
[25:19.360 --> 25:21.360]  go look at who funds it Goldman Sachs
[25:21.360 --> 25:23.360]  JP Morgan Bank of America
[25:23.360 --> 25:25.360]  Wells Fargo they're all the ones that
[25:25.360 --> 25:27.360]  fund middle-class tax increases
[25:27.360 --> 25:29.360]  to funnel your money and banker bell
[25:29.360 --> 25:31.360]  outs to them
[25:31.360 --> 25:33.360]  they are the enemy
[25:33.360 --> 25:35.360]  there is no America anymore
[25:35.360 --> 25:37.360]  we're a corporate fiefdom
[25:37.360 --> 25:39.360]  we're a corporate holding
[25:39.360 --> 25:41.360]  we were conquered through fraud
[25:41.360 --> 25:43.360]  but they can only hold it
[25:43.360 --> 25:45.360]  as long as you're not aware of it
[25:45.360 --> 25:47.360]  for a time but they're doing all of this
[25:47.360 --> 25:49.360]  now saying yeah we're going to censor the internet
[25:49.360 --> 25:51.360]  no due process shut down whatever we want
[25:51.360 --> 25:53.360]  AP Reuters news week time
[25:53.360 --> 25:55.360]  magazine wikipedia
[25:55.360 --> 25:57.360]  all of them admitting it right now wikipedia is going to go dark
[25:57.360 --> 25:59.360]  they're saying for a few days just to show you
[25:59.360 --> 26:01.360]  what it's going to be like
[26:01.360 --> 26:03.360]  the feds already grabbing thousands of websites
[26:03.360 --> 26:05.360]  a week some of them totally legal
[26:05.360 --> 26:07.360]  that are posting alternative music
[26:07.360 --> 26:09.360]  with authorization that's kicking the
[26:09.360 --> 26:11.360]  mainline recording industries but
[26:11.360 --> 26:13.360]  so they don't have a monopoly on what becomes popular
[26:13.360 --> 26:15.360]  so they had the feds just go shut down
[26:15.360 --> 26:17.360]  a multi-million dollar website
[26:17.360 --> 26:19.360]  and the feds had to admit last week
[26:19.360 --> 26:21.360]  the site wasn't even illegal
[26:21.360 --> 26:23.360]  but your site's still gone
[26:23.360 --> 26:25.360]  this is all enshrined in part of a UN
[26:25.360 --> 26:27.360]  treaty that nexus is in
[26:27.360 --> 26:29.360]  with this US law
[26:29.360 --> 26:31.360]  our law is all under
[26:31.360 --> 26:33.360]  UN now
[26:33.360 --> 26:35.360]  as Obama has said
[26:35.360 --> 26:37.360]  as four of the supreme court justices
[26:37.360 --> 26:39.360]  have said
[26:39.360 --> 26:41.360]  it can happen here it is
[26:41.360 --> 26:43.360]  happening here
[26:43.360 --> 26:45.360]  so for three weeks we have a debate
[26:45.360 --> 26:47.360]  about does the NDAA national
[26:47.360 --> 26:49.360]  defense authorization act get rid of posse
[26:49.360 --> 26:51.360]  comatatus put trips on the streets
[26:51.360 --> 26:53.360]  allow them to attack anybody anywhere in the world
[26:53.360 --> 26:55.360]  including US citizens in the United States
[26:55.360 --> 26:57.360]  kill you torture you disappear you
[26:57.360 --> 26:59.360]  and at first people
[26:59.360 --> 27:01.360]  couldn't believe it
[27:01.360 --> 27:03.360]  so they said it can't be true
[27:03.360 --> 27:05.360]  I saw articles Ron Paul's wrong
[27:05.360 --> 27:07.360]  Alex Jones is wrong all over the country
[27:07.360 --> 27:09.360]  it can't be true
[27:09.360 --> 27:11.360]  because one subsection said
[27:11.360 --> 27:13.360]  citizens are exempt until another section
[27:13.360 --> 27:15.360]  and said unless the government says so
[27:17.360 --> 27:19.360]  until Carl Levin and all these other
[27:19.360 --> 27:21.360]  senators and there's video after video on
[27:21.360 --> 27:23.360]  infowars.com breaking this down
[27:23.360 --> 27:25.360]  came out and said no it does affect US citizens
[27:25.360 --> 27:27.360]  here's the article that we reposted
[27:27.360 --> 27:29.360]  on the front page that has a boil down
[27:29.360 --> 27:31.360]  of all this presidential frontrunner
[27:31.360 --> 27:33.360]  warns martial law being established
[27:33.360 --> 27:35.360]  in America
[27:35.360 --> 27:37.360]  it's got all the videos the Ron Paul
[27:37.360 --> 27:39.360]  interview here where he said the NDAA
[27:39.360 --> 27:41.360]  establishes
[27:41.360 --> 27:43.360]  martial law of course
[27:43.360 --> 27:45.360]  it does it's beyond martial law
[27:45.360 --> 27:47.360]  even under classical
[27:47.360 --> 27:49.360]  martial law the military
[27:49.360 --> 27:51.360]  can't kill you torture you
[27:51.360 --> 27:53.360]  or disappear you forever this
[27:53.360 --> 27:55.360]  is now codified
[27:55.360 --> 27:57.360]  in an abomination
[27:57.360 --> 27:59.360]  that actually has the rest of the world
[27:59.360 --> 28:01.360]  marveling
[28:01.360 --> 28:03.360]  they are marveling in Australia
[28:03.360 --> 28:05.360]  in France Al Jazeera
[28:05.360 --> 28:07.360]  drudge out the headline
[28:07.360 --> 28:09.360]  even Al Jazeera asked how did it come to this
[28:09.360 --> 28:11.360]  because let me add
[28:11.360 --> 28:13.360]  something
[28:13.360 --> 28:15.360]  they always talk about al qaeda
[28:15.360 --> 28:17.360]  when you get the actual training manuals
[28:17.360 --> 28:19.360]  that law enforcement have sent us
[28:19.360 --> 28:21.360]  that have made national news over and over again

[28:43.360 --> 28:45.360]  anybody
[28:45.360 --> 28:47.360]  you are the people on the list

[34:11.360 --> 34:13.360]  a year ago now
[34:13.360 --> 34:15.360]  laundering
[34:15.360 --> 34:17.360]  $376 billion
[34:17.360 --> 34:19.360]  in narcotics money
[34:19.360 --> 34:21.360]  out of the $500 billion
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.360]  here industry again just here in the US
[34:23.360 --> 34:25.360]  it's $500 billion in opium worldwide
[34:25.360 --> 34:27.360]  our own government says
[34:27.360 --> 34:29.360]  the government has been taken
[34:29.360 --> 34:31.360]  over by criminals this is what
[34:31.360 --> 34:33.360]  happens over and over again
[34:33.360 --> 34:35.360]  but here's the good news
[34:35.360 --> 34:37.360]  they wouldn't be coming out and openly
[34:37.360 --> 34:39.360]  saying okay we are going to start
[34:39.360 --> 34:41.360]  shutting down talk radio and bring
[34:41.360 --> 34:43.360]  back the fairness doctrine
[34:43.360 --> 34:45.360]  okay we are going to not let people criticize the government
[34:45.360 --> 34:47.360]  okay we are going to turn
[34:47.360 --> 34:49.360]  the Pentagon Lush
[34:49.360 --> 34:51.360]  and the private mercenary companies
[34:51.360 --> 34:53.360]  over 200 of them hired to wage
[34:53.360 --> 34:55.360]  offensive internet war
[34:55.360 --> 34:57.360]  on detractors of our agenda
[34:57.360 --> 34:59.360]  that means if you're not a globalist trader
[34:59.360 --> 35:01.360]  the reason
[35:01.360 --> 35:03.360]  we get hack attacks
[35:03.360 --> 35:05.360]  all the time out of department of defense
[35:05.360 --> 35:07.360]  and all sorts of dirty tricks the reason that
[35:07.360 --> 35:09.360]  happens is because they're scared to death
[35:09.360 --> 35:11.360]  because 74%
[35:11.360 --> 35:13.360]  of all donations
[35:13.360 --> 35:15.360]  from the military for both parties
[35:15.360 --> 35:17.360]  for presidential candidates
[35:17.360 --> 35:19.360]  go to Ron Paul
[35:19.360 --> 35:21.360]  because the military loves my radio show
[35:21.360 --> 35:23.360]  because they're average men and women
[35:23.360 --> 35:25.360]  who join for the right reasons
[35:25.360 --> 35:27.360]  and they know what I'm saying is the truth
[35:27.360 --> 35:29.360]  because they're in there getting the training for riot control
[35:29.360 --> 35:31.360]  and gun confiscation
[35:31.360 --> 35:33.360]  and they're good people
[35:33.360 --> 35:35.360]  and they know what's going on
[35:35.360 --> 35:37.360]  and so you bet they're in news week
[35:37.360 --> 35:39.360]  magazine and the hill
[35:39.360 --> 35:41.360]  all over the news admitting
[35:41.360 --> 35:43.360]  oh yeah the government's getting ready to shut down free speech
[35:43.360 --> 35:45.360]  why because we're
[35:45.360 --> 35:47.360]  destroying them
[35:47.360 --> 35:49.360]  we're defeating the small criminal group
[35:49.360 --> 35:51.360]  like John Corzine
[35:51.360 --> 35:53.360]  former head of Goldman Sachs
[35:53.360 --> 35:55.360]  that's the head of the new world order
[35:55.360 --> 35:57.360]  sets up his own MF global makes a 40 to one bet
[35:57.360 --> 35:59.360]  Goldman Sachs
[35:59.360 --> 36:01.360]  is told by its owner
[36:01.360 --> 36:03.360]  because it was just basically
[36:03.360 --> 36:05.360]  a front group again for JP Morgan
[36:05.360 --> 36:07.360]  a subsidiary of that MF global
[36:07.360 --> 36:09.360]  you give us that money
[36:09.360 --> 36:11.360]  it disappears out of the private customer accounts
[36:11.360 --> 36:13.360]  and Corzine now last week
[36:13.360 --> 36:15.360]  in Congress got caught
[36:15.360 --> 36:17.360]  when the head of the biggest commodity trading group
[36:17.360 --> 36:19.360]  the CMT went public
[36:19.360 --> 36:21.360]  we played the clip
[36:21.360 --> 36:23.360]  Financial Times of London ran with it as well
[36:23.360 --> 36:25.360]  and said Corzine did know
[36:25.360 --> 36:27.360]  and did direct the private accounts to be taken
[36:27.360 --> 36:29.360]  after he'd perjured himself
[36:29.360 --> 36:31.360]  before two committees
[36:31.360 --> 36:33.360]  he's at the highest level of government
[36:33.360 --> 36:35.360]  top Obama's
[36:35.360 --> 36:37.360]  advisor, former New Jersey governor
[36:37.360 --> 36:39.360]  former head of Goldman Sachs
[36:39.360 --> 36:41.360]  that's as high level as it gets
[36:41.360 --> 36:43.360]  and he's a common
[36:43.360 --> 36:45.360]  crook
[36:45.360 --> 36:47.360]  he's a common crook just like Bernie Madoff
[36:47.360 --> 36:49.360]  who founded the Nasdaq
[36:51.360 --> 36:53.360]  Ken Lay
[36:53.360 --> 36:55.360]  who came up with carbon taxes
[36:55.360 --> 36:57.360]  and all the stuff with Al Gore in meetings
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.360]  a common crook
[36:59.360 --> 37:01.360]  they're crooks
[37:01.360 --> 37:03.360]  and you go study who's funding
[37:03.360 --> 37:05.360]  the Ford Foundation
[37:05.360 --> 37:07.360]  who's funding RAND Corporation
[37:07.360 --> 37:09.360]  who's putting out these reports
[37:09.360 --> 37:11.360]  it's those very same companies
[37:11.360 --> 37:13.360]  they're the ones lobbying
[37:13.360 --> 37:15.360]  and giving money to pass NDAA
[37:15.360 --> 37:17.360]  of course
[37:17.360 --> 37:19.360]  foreign crook banks want the army
[37:19.360 --> 37:21.360]  on the streets
[37:21.360 --> 37:23.360]  what do you think they do
[37:23.360 --> 37:25.360]  it came out in 2002 when the BBC
[37:25.360 --> 37:27.360]  got the IMF World Bank documents
[37:27.360 --> 37:29.360]  when Joseph Stiklitz left
[37:29.360 --> 37:31.360]  first we take over and buy off both parties
[37:31.360 --> 37:33.360]  or all three parties in a third world country
[37:33.360 --> 37:35.360]  or a first world country or an old world country
[37:35.360 --> 37:37.360]  and then we implode the economy
[37:37.360 --> 37:39.360]  and then people get mad and
[37:39.360 --> 37:41.360]  once there's a revolution we try to bring in Marshall law
[37:41.360 --> 37:43.360]  and that further destroys things
[37:43.360 --> 37:45.360]  and they've got a plan for us
[37:47.360 --> 37:49.360]  and there's no reason
[37:49.360 --> 37:51.360]  it has to happen
[37:53.360 --> 37:55.360]  Ron Paul being number one, number two and number three
[37:55.360 --> 37:57.360]  and all polls combined
[37:57.360 --> 37:59.360]  in second place I've been telling you for six months
[37:59.360 --> 38:01.360]  the media now admits that
[38:03.360 --> 38:05.360]  the fact that he is in second place
[38:05.360 --> 38:07.360]  despite all the demonization
[38:07.360 --> 38:09.360]  and everything else shows you
[38:09.360 --> 38:11.360]  is a bellwether or a barometer
[38:11.360 --> 38:13.360]  or a gauge like in your car
[38:13.360 --> 38:15.360]  for the temperatures rising
[38:15.360 --> 38:17.360]  of the people
[38:17.360 --> 38:19.360]  this is a guy who understands it
[38:19.360 --> 38:21.360]  who does the real research
[38:21.360 --> 38:23.360]  weekly standard says he sounds
[38:23.360 --> 38:25.360]  just like Alex Jones, of course he does
[38:25.360 --> 38:27.360]  he's reading the same globalist documents
[38:27.360 --> 38:29.360]  I can't tell you how refreshing it is
[38:31.360 --> 38:33.360]  to have a Lord Moncton on
[38:33.360 --> 38:35.360]  or a Ron Paul on or someone who's a
[38:35.360 --> 38:37.360]  true scholar like I am who spends
[38:37.360 --> 38:39.360]  countless hours studying
[38:39.360 --> 38:41.360]  and I can say something and they finish my sentence
[38:41.360 --> 38:43.360]  up to date info
[38:43.360 --> 38:45.360]  people who know what they're talking about
[38:49.360 --> 38:51.360]  so again
[38:51.360 --> 38:53.360]  I'm going to warn everybody right now
[38:53.360 --> 38:55.360]  that we are at a historic crossroads
[38:55.360 --> 38:57.360]  remember just three weeks ago
[38:57.360 --> 38:59.360]  oh it's not true they're not going to use the army
[38:59.360 --> 39:01.360]  on the streets of America and the rest of American citizens
[39:01.360 --> 39:03.360]  and Obama's going to veto
[39:03.360 --> 39:05.360]  then they said okay it is in there
[39:05.360 --> 39:07.360]  but don't worry Obama's going to veto
[39:07.360 --> 39:09.360]  what the ACLU said
[39:09.360 --> 39:11.360]  and I said here's his letters to congress
[39:11.360 --> 39:13.360]  they're in the congressional record saying
[39:13.360 --> 39:15.360]  that he wants the pure power
[39:15.360 --> 39:17.360]  himself and they changed it and gave it to him
[39:17.360 --> 39:19.360]  he says he's going to sign it
[39:19.360 --> 39:21.360]  said he'd sign it Thursday he hadn't signed it yet
[39:21.360 --> 39:23.360]  unconstitutional robot signer
[39:23.360 --> 39:25.360]  that robo signer just like the big banks do
[39:25.360 --> 39:27.360]  to take your house that they don't own
[39:27.360 --> 39:29.360]  and remember ten years ago I was a conspiracy
[39:29.360 --> 39:31.360]  theorist having insiders on tell you
[39:31.360 --> 39:33.360]  that now it's admitted I mean
[39:33.360 --> 39:35.360]  you better start listening to me
[39:35.360 --> 39:37.360]  I don't watch football
[39:37.360 --> 39:39.360]  I don't
[39:39.360 --> 39:41.360]  screw around with my hair all day
[39:41.360 --> 39:43.360]  I don't run around acting trendy
[39:43.360 --> 39:45.360]  with my buddies and acting tough
[39:45.360 --> 39:47.360]  I spend my time researching
[39:47.360 --> 39:49.360]  I'm going to tell you again
[39:49.360 --> 39:51.360]  I know what I'm talking about
[39:51.360 --> 39:53.360]  you're in peril not listening to every word
[39:53.360 --> 39:55.360]  I tell you and I'm talking to new listeners
[39:57.360 --> 39:59.360]  we're all in peril
[39:59.360 --> 40:01.360]  I'm not up here risking my life my name
[40:01.360 --> 40:03.360]  my treasure my family folks
[40:03.360 --> 40:05.360]  because
[40:05.360 --> 40:07.360]  I don't think and know we can win
[40:07.360 --> 40:09.360]  and losing to these people
[40:09.360 --> 40:11.360]  a high tech eugenics based
[40:11.360 --> 40:13.360]  population reduction control freak
[40:13.360 --> 40:15.360]  system
[40:15.360 --> 40:17.360]  that's not an option if this was
[40:17.360 --> 40:19.360]  some boss hog corruption
[40:19.360 --> 40:21.360]  business as usual I wouldn't be so frantic
[40:21.360 --> 40:23.360]  it'd be a problem
[40:23.360 --> 40:25.360]  I'd say get involved in your government
[40:25.360 --> 40:27.360]  that was 30 40 years ago
[40:27.360 --> 40:29.360]  we've got really
[40:29.360 --> 40:31.360]  virulent tyranny with a bunch of control freaks
[40:31.360 --> 40:33.360]  who've never lost and who
[40:33.360 --> 40:35.360]  are very arrogant and who want
[40:35.360 --> 40:37.360]  global domination and want us to pay
[40:37.360 --> 40:39.360]  for it and fight for it
[40:39.360 --> 40:41.360]  and let me tell you you see the fruits
[40:41.360 --> 40:43.360]  of the new world order it isn't good
[40:43.360 --> 40:45.360]  you like it so far
[40:45.360 --> 40:47.360]  if talk show host across this country
[40:47.360 --> 40:49.360]  and prominent media people
[40:49.360 --> 40:51.360]  would all just start rebelling
[40:51.360 --> 40:53.360]  and start telling the truth because I know
[40:53.360 --> 40:55.360]  you're not stupid men and women we turn this
[40:55.360 --> 40:57.360]  around very quickly I know you get threatened
[40:57.360 --> 40:59.360]  with firing and the rest of it but if you all
[40:59.360 --> 41:01.360]  start rebelling and by the way I put this call
[41:01.360 --> 41:03.360]  out more and more I'm seeing it happen
[41:03.360 --> 41:05.360]  I'm not going to name names but I see it across
[41:05.360 --> 41:07.360]  the board good
[41:07.360 --> 41:09.360]  even if you're evil and corrupt you know
[41:09.360 --> 41:11.360]  you don't have a seat at this table in the new world
[41:11.360 --> 41:13.360]  order where it's going your own self
[41:13.360 --> 41:15.360]  preservation says you've got to fight this
[41:15.360 --> 41:17.360]  you know what your gut
[41:17.360 --> 41:19.360]  you know it intellectually you know I'm
[41:19.360 --> 41:21.360]  right so stand with humanity
[41:21.360 --> 41:23.360]  stand with the people and wake up
[41:23.360 --> 41:25.360]  so first I go through this
[41:25.360 --> 41:27.360]  exercise of explaining
[41:27.360 --> 41:29.360]  no it really does affect citizens here's clips
[41:29.360 --> 41:31.360]  of senators and people saying it
[41:31.360 --> 41:33.360]  here's the text then
[41:33.360 --> 41:35.360]  Obama's going to save us that was so people
[41:35.360 --> 41:37.360]  wouldn't lobby against it and stop it I'm like no
[41:37.360 --> 41:39.360]  he's going to sign it now he says he's going to sign
[41:39.360 --> 41:41.360]  it but in case you're a new
[41:41.360 --> 41:43.360]  listener
[41:43.360 --> 41:45.360]  let me just play one of four or five clips
[41:45.360 --> 41:47.360]  that are at info wars.com
[41:47.360 --> 41:49.360]  in the article presidential front runner warren's
[41:49.360 --> 41:51.360]  martial law being established in America
[41:51.360 --> 41:53.360]  the video of Ron Paul right there
[41:53.360 --> 41:55.360]  on our show breaking it down
[41:55.360 --> 41:57.360]  and I have the clips
[41:57.360 --> 41:59.360]  of the other senators saying it there
[41:59.360 --> 42:01.360]  but here is senator Carl
[42:01.360 --> 42:03.360]  Levin the author
[42:03.360 --> 42:05.360]  of the bill
[42:05.360 --> 42:07.360]  telling another senator hey don't gripe
[42:07.360 --> 42:09.360]  at me Obama asked for this
[42:09.360 --> 42:11.360]  okay
[42:11.360 --> 42:13.360]  and no wonder people can't
[42:13.360 --> 42:15.360]  figure out politics this is the deception
[42:15.360 --> 42:17.360]  you've got to wallow through four or five
[42:17.360 --> 42:19.360]  layers of it every time
[42:19.360 --> 42:21.360]  we're going to go to break and come back with this video
[42:21.360 --> 42:23.360]  but
[42:23.360 --> 42:25.360]  ladies and gentlemen
[42:25.360 --> 42:27.360]  I knew their game plan I know their plays
[42:27.360 --> 42:29.360]  so well like it's football
[42:29.360 --> 42:31.360]  that I said they're they just introduced
[42:31.360 --> 42:33.360]  this bill they're going to claim it's not in there
[42:33.360 --> 42:35.360]  then they're going to claim I said this three weeks ago that Obama's going to veto it
[42:35.360 --> 42:37.360]  but he's not going to veto it
[42:37.360 --> 42:39.360]  and sure enough
[42:39.360 --> 42:41.360]  now that they pass it they go yeah it affects citizens
[42:41.360 --> 42:43.360]  yeah the army's going to start being on the streets
[42:43.360 --> 42:45.360]  well of course they're going to start being on the streets
[42:45.360 --> 42:47.360]  the bankers are all going to go to prison
[42:47.360 --> 42:49.360]  if they don't have a stage civil emergency

[47:29.360 --> 47:31.360]  and they hear this type of news
[47:31.360 --> 47:33.360]  and they think what do we do
[47:33.360 --> 47:35.360]  you become aware of it
[47:35.360 --> 47:37.360]  you learn how the global system works
[47:37.360 --> 47:39.360]  you decide that being informed
[47:39.360 --> 47:41.360]  is important
[47:41.360 --> 47:43.360]  and you realize that most media
[47:43.360 --> 47:45.360]  gives you different flavors
[47:45.360 --> 47:47.360]  of spin and bull
[47:47.360 --> 47:49.360]  but more and more because
[47:49.360 --> 47:51.360]  the private corporate world government
[47:51.360 --> 47:53.360]  is out in the open
[47:53.360 --> 47:55.360]  they don't even deny it now
[47:55.360 --> 47:57.360]  in fact things are so bad
[47:57.360 --> 47:59.360]  we're seeing
[47:59.360 --> 48:01.360]  horrified responses to what's happening
[48:01.360 --> 48:03.360]  from even powerful institutions
[48:03.360 --> 48:05.360]  and I'm going to get to some of that in a moment
[48:07.360 --> 48:09.360]  look at these headlines the hill
[48:09.360 --> 48:11.360]  internet piracy bill
[48:11.360 --> 48:13.360]  a free speech kill switch
[48:13.360 --> 48:15.360]  here's AP
[48:15.360 --> 48:17.360]  internet architects oppose
[48:17.360 --> 48:19.360]  US online privacy bill
[48:19.360 --> 48:21.360]  another headline
[48:21.360 --> 48:25.360]  this is the Chinese model of censorship
[48:25.360 --> 48:27.360]  the father of the internet
[48:27.360 --> 48:29.360]  and we're not talking about Al Gore
[48:29.360 --> 48:31.360]  the real inventors
[48:31.360 --> 48:33.360]  if the US begins
[48:33.360 --> 48:35.360]  its use of
[48:35.360 --> 48:37.360]  central position in the network
[48:37.360 --> 48:39.360]  for censorship that advances
[48:39.360 --> 48:41.360]  its political and economic agenda
[48:41.360 --> 48:43.360]  the consequences will be far reaching
[48:43.360 --> 48:45.360]  and destructive that's AP
[48:45.360 --> 48:47.360]  AFP
[48:47.360 --> 48:49.360]  NDAA bill aims to suppress internet freedom
[48:49.360 --> 48:51.360]  here's another one
[48:51.360 --> 48:53.360]  congress declares offensive war on the internet
[48:53.360 --> 48:55.360]  and NDAA
[48:55.360 --> 48:57.360]  listen to the NDAA national defense authorization act
[48:57.360 --> 48:59.360]  which already has all four branches of the military
[48:59.360 --> 49:01.360]  meaning the private contractors that run it
[49:01.360 --> 49:03.360]  section 954
[49:03.360 --> 49:05.360]  of the NDAA
[49:05.360 --> 49:07.360]  titled military activities in cyberspace
[49:07.360 --> 49:09.360]  receive no debate in congress as well
[49:09.360 --> 49:11.360]  as in the media
[49:11.360 --> 49:13.360]  the section states clearly quote
[49:13.360 --> 49:15.360]  congress affirms the department of defense
[49:15.360 --> 49:17.360]  has the capability and upon direction
[49:17.360 --> 49:19.360]  may conduct offensive operations
[49:19.360 --> 49:21.360]  in cyberspace to defend our nation
[49:21.360 --> 49:23.360]  allies and interest
[49:23.360 --> 49:25.360]  offensive, preemptive
[49:25.360 --> 49:27.360]  and you find out about what these generals have been saying for years
[49:27.360 --> 49:29.360]  they call it sock puppets
[49:29.360 --> 49:31.360]  and megathones
[49:31.360 --> 49:33.360]  they've got fake programs already disseminating
[49:33.360 --> 49:35.360]  disinfo, engaging in domestic propaganda
[49:35.360 --> 49:37.360]  and attacking
[49:37.360 --> 49:39.360]  websites and groups that don't agree
[49:39.360 --> 49:41.360]  with quote America's agenda
[49:41.360 --> 49:43.360]  that means the
[49:43.360 --> 49:45.360]  made off banker types that run our country's
[49:45.360 --> 49:47.360]  agenda
[49:47.360 --> 49:49.360]  and remember that
[49:49.360 --> 49:51.360]  remember that
[49:51.360 --> 49:53.360]  to simplify this
[49:53.360 --> 49:55.360]  it's a bunch of Kinley, Bernie made off
[49:55.360 --> 49:57.360]  John Corzine crooks
[49:57.360 --> 49:59.360]  people even worse than them
[49:59.360 --> 50:01.360]  that run this
[50:01.360 --> 50:03.360]  and are the ones setting this up
[50:03.360 --> 50:05.360]  and they created 1.5
[50:05.360 --> 50:07.360]  quadrillion
[50:07.360 --> 50:09.360]  1500
[50:09.360 --> 50:11.360]  trillion conservatively
[50:11.360 --> 50:13.360]  Washington Post says 654
[50:13.360 --> 50:15.360]  trillion of that is quote America's debt
[50:15.360 --> 50:17.360]  now your own personal debt
[50:17.360 --> 50:19.360]  government debt everything combined is 14.5
[50:19.360 --> 50:21.360]  trillion
[50:21.360 --> 50:23.360]  they've got you convinced that you're going to be debtor slaves because of that
[50:23.360 --> 50:25.360]  and meanwhile
[50:25.360 --> 50:27.360]  there's 600 plus trillion
[50:27.360 --> 50:29.360]  they say we've signed on to
[50:29.360 --> 50:31.360]  because it's their debt they create the derivatives
[50:31.360 --> 50:33.360]  buy up the world through the fraud
[50:33.360 --> 50:35.360]  the Ponzi scheme but they don't go to jail
[50:35.360 --> 50:37.360]  they just turn America and the rest of the world
[50:37.360 --> 50:39.360]  into a jail
[50:39.360 --> 50:41.360]  they finance al-Qaeda to start overthrowing
[50:41.360 --> 50:43.360]  those other countries all over the Middle East
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.360]  call it democracy as they stone and beat women
[50:45.360 --> 50:47.360]  and tell you
[50:47.360 --> 50:49.360]  to give your rights up where al-Qaeda will get you
[50:49.360 --> 50:51.360]  when they get al-Qaeda on the airplanes that protect them
[50:53.360 --> 50:55.360]  this is full spectrum dominance
[50:55.360 --> 50:57.360]  these global bankers control al-Qaeda
[50:57.360 --> 50:59.360]  and they use it to menace us
[50:59.360 --> 51:01.360]  so that we then give up our liberties
[51:01.360 --> 51:03.360]  be a little more sophisticated okay folks
[51:03.360 --> 51:05.360]  if you're a new listener
[51:05.360 --> 51:07.360]  figure out why the bankers are able to take over
[51:07.360 --> 51:09.360]  can you figure that out
[51:09.360 --> 51:11.360]  that Amaral Alaki died secretly at the Pentagon
[51:11.360 --> 51:13.360]  and got walking orders from the Pentagon brass
[51:13.360 --> 51:15.360]  AP Fox News
[51:15.360 --> 51:17.360]  can you figure out that we broke before it was even in congressional testimony
[51:17.360 --> 51:19.360]  for my witnesses at the U.S.
[51:19.360 --> 51:21.360]  government got the underwear Christmas Day
[51:21.360 --> 51:23.360]  bomber on the plane two years ago
[51:23.360 --> 51:25.360]  for two months
[51:25.360 --> 51:27.360]  that was not in the news you heard it here first
[51:27.360 --> 51:29.360]  because the people that witnessed it
[51:29.360 --> 51:31.360]  are my listeners
[51:31.360 --> 51:33.360]  and the media said they were full of baloney and then it came out
[51:33.360 --> 51:35.360]  it was all true in congressional testimony
[51:35.360 --> 51:37.360]  and the Congress said let's just move on
[51:37.360 --> 51:39.360]  the government got him on the plane
[51:39.360 --> 51:41.360]  let's just move on national security
[51:41.360 --> 51:43.360]  you bet they did
[51:43.360 --> 51:45.360]  to put those naked body scanners in
[51:45.360 --> 51:47.360]  so they can train you to be a good little slave
[51:49.360 --> 51:51.360]  now here's the deal I want to get into the internet situation
[51:51.360 --> 51:53.360]  and this global
[51:53.360 --> 51:55.360]  announcement to shut down free speech and how they're going to do it
[51:55.360 --> 51:57.360]  as I've been telling you for a decade
[51:57.360 --> 51:59.360]  how did I know
[51:59.360 --> 52:01.360]  there's a consortium called internet 2
[52:01.360 --> 52:03.360]  they've met in Austin
[52:03.360 --> 52:05.360]  they've met in London
[52:05.360 --> 52:07.360]  they've met in Tokyo
[52:07.360 --> 52:09.360]  it's made up of major corporations
[52:09.360 --> 52:11.360]  and big government institutions and universities
[52:11.360 --> 52:13.360]  and they openly a decade ago
[52:13.360 --> 52:15.360]  well actually the first meeting I saw
[52:15.360 --> 52:17.360]  was in 2000 so 12 years
[52:17.360 --> 52:19.360]  ago almost
[52:19.360 --> 52:21.360]  11 plus years ago they
[52:21.360 --> 52:23.360]  they said how they were going to do the whole thing
[52:23.360 --> 52:25.360]  and again I'm absolutely right again
[52:25.360 --> 52:27.360]  not because I'm smart
[52:27.360 --> 52:29.360]  you know when I learned that the enemy tells me
[52:29.360 --> 52:31.360]  exactly what they're going to do
[52:31.360 --> 52:33.360]  like I was a football coach and the other coach walked over
[52:33.360 --> 52:35.360]  an hour before the game and said
[52:35.360 --> 52:37.360]  here's my complete playbook
[52:37.360 --> 52:39.360]  and exactly how I'm going to run every play
[52:39.360 --> 52:41.360]  just want you to have it
[52:41.360 --> 52:43.360]  and then at first I wouldn't trust them
[52:43.360 --> 52:45.360]  but after I saw the first 5-6 plays exactly as they said
[52:45.360 --> 52:47.360]  I would start using that playbook
[52:47.360 --> 52:49.360]  a menu
[52:49.360 --> 52:51.360]  and I've got their entire playbook
[52:51.360 --> 52:53.360]  the entire playbook's there for you
[52:53.360 --> 52:55.360]  even if you're some selfish little globalist want to be
[52:55.360 --> 52:57.360]  you know how successful you can be in life
[52:57.360 --> 52:59.360]  having their playbook
[52:59.360 --> 53:01.360]  being into researching reality
[53:01.360 --> 53:03.360]  not living I mean I talked to business people
[53:03.360 --> 53:05.360]  executives most of them are like children
[53:05.360 --> 53:07.360]  they live in just a phony fantasy land
[53:07.360 --> 53:09.360]  interfacing with all the dis info
[53:09.360 --> 53:11.360]  they're given
[53:11.360 --> 53:13.360]  there's very few people
[53:13.360 --> 53:15.360]  that pierce it
[53:15.360 --> 53:17.360]  but once you've pierced it
[53:17.360 --> 53:19.360]  and studied the enemy you know
[53:19.360 --> 53:21.360]  everything they're going to do and that's what's frustrating
[53:21.360 --> 53:23.360]  to know this to know it's illegitimate
[53:23.360 --> 53:25.360]  to know it's horrible where it's leading us
[53:25.360 --> 53:27.360]  do you think things are bad now
[53:27.360 --> 53:29.360]  just wait to watch them
[53:29.360 --> 53:31.360]  say we're not in a depression when they know full well it is
[53:31.360 --> 53:33.360]  to watch the public train
[53:33.360 --> 53:35.360]  to live off lies
[53:35.360 --> 53:37.360]  to watch people being conned
[53:37.360 --> 53:39.360]  by it and being helpless
[53:39.360 --> 53:41.360]  because they're willfully ignorant
[53:41.360 --> 53:43.360]  that's painful look at this headline
[53:43.360 --> 53:45.360]  US mayors to cry rise in poverty
[53:45.360 --> 53:47.360]  homelessness and it says they ask a fed
[53:47.360 --> 53:49.360]  we were getting a record
[53:49.360 --> 53:51.360]  request for food and shelter
[53:51.360 --> 53:53.360]  crimes exploding but
[53:53.360 --> 53:55.360]  we've got you know
[53:55.360 --> 53:57.360]  close to 50 something million people
[53:57.360 --> 53:59.360]  what is it 46.2 million people
[53:59.360 --> 54:01.360]  on food stamps that's electronic
[54:01.360 --> 54:03.360]  soup kitchens
[54:03.360 --> 54:05.360]  we need your help but something's happening
[54:05.360 --> 54:07.360]  why do you say it's not a depression
[54:07.360 --> 54:09.360]  the government's like no we had a recovery
[54:09.360 --> 54:11.360]  three years ago everything's fine
[54:11.360 --> 54:13.360]  it's just such a lie
[54:13.360 --> 54:15.360]  like fast and furious
[54:15.360 --> 54:17.360]  the government caught shipping the guns into
[54:17.360 --> 54:19.360]  Mexico and two weeks ago
[54:19.360 --> 54:21.360]  CBS News gets the documents
[54:21.360 --> 54:23.360]  as if I needed them because I have inside sources already knew
[54:23.360 --> 54:25.360]  that it was to blame the Second Amendment
[54:25.360 --> 54:27.360]  of course it was a false flag
[54:27.360 --> 54:29.360]  of course it was stage terror
[54:29.360 --> 54:31.360]  of course it's their number one
[54:31.360 --> 54:33.360]  play it's up the
[54:33.360 --> 54:35.360]  middle
[54:35.360 --> 54:37.360]  half their play is on
[54:37.360 --> 54:39.360]  that that's all they run over
[54:39.360 --> 54:41.360]  and over and over and over again
[54:41.360 --> 54:43.360]  I'm playing the real game
[54:43.360 --> 54:45.360]  of life I'm not focused
[54:45.360 --> 54:47.360]  on Tebow losing right now
[54:47.360 --> 54:49.360]  and I'm not saying you're bad if you're
[54:49.360 --> 54:51.360]  into that but that doesn't
[54:51.360 --> 54:53.360]  affect you at the end of the day it's a
[54:53.360 --> 54:55.360]  prosthesis for manhood
[54:55.360 --> 54:57.360]  it is a fake appendage it isn't
[54:57.360 --> 54:59.360]  real you get in and a mail
[54:59.360 --> 55:01.360]  soap opera to what other men do
[55:01.360 --> 55:03.360]  in a simulated battle that doesn't
[55:03.360 --> 55:05.360]  matter while your entire bill of rights
[55:05.360 --> 55:07.360]  constitution and your dollar
[55:07.360 --> 55:09.360]  is being destroyed
[55:09.360 --> 55:11.360]  while torture and secret arrest
[55:11.360 --> 55:13.360]  and Chinese style internet censorship
[55:13.360 --> 55:15.360]  is all publicly
[55:15.360 --> 55:17.360]  announced everything we warned you about
[55:17.360 --> 55:19.360]  and I told you months ago it was all about to be
[55:19.360 --> 55:21.360]  announced and now it is being announced
[55:21.360 --> 55:23.360]  and they're going into the worldwide
[55:23.360 --> 55:25.360]  implosion they're going into the next
[55:25.360 --> 55:27.360]  hellish phase
[55:27.360 --> 55:29.360]  and people are waking up but not fast enough
[55:29.360 --> 55:31.360]  let's go to the short clip of
[55:31.360 --> 55:33.360]  the senator
[55:33.360 --> 55:35.360]  Carl Levin going hey don't blame me for this
[55:35.360 --> 55:37.360]  affecting US citizens this NDA
[55:37.360 --> 55:39.360]  bill and the end deposit commentatus the president
[55:39.360 --> 55:41.360]  asked for this are you aware of that senator
[55:41.360 --> 55:43.360]  the senator says yes I am here it is
[55:43.360 --> 55:45.360]  and I'm wondering whether
[55:45.360 --> 55:47.360]  the senator is familiar with
[55:47.360 --> 55:49.360]  the fact that the language
[55:49.360 --> 55:51.360]  the language which
[55:51.360 --> 55:53.360]  precluded the application
[55:53.360 --> 55:55.360]  of section
[55:55.360 --> 55:57.360]  1031
[55:57.360 --> 55:59.360]  two American citizens
[55:59.360 --> 56:01.360]  was in the bill
[56:01.360 --> 56:03.360]  that we originally approved in the armed
[56:03.360 --> 56:05.360]  services committee and the administration
[56:05.360 --> 56:07.360]  asked us to remove
[56:07.360 --> 56:09.360]  the language which says
[56:09.360 --> 56:11.360]  that US citizens in lawful residents
[56:11.360 --> 56:13.360]  would not be
[56:13.360 --> 56:15.360]  subject to this section is the senator
[56:15.360 --> 56:17.360]  familiar with the fact that it was the administration
[56:17.360 --> 56:19.360]  that asked us to remove
[56:19.360 --> 56:21.360]  the very language
[56:21.360 --> 56:23.360]  which we had in the bill which passed the committee
[56:23.360 --> 56:25.360]  and that we removed it at the request
[56:25.360 --> 56:27.360]  of the administration
[56:27.360 --> 56:29.360]  that would have said that this
[56:29.360 --> 56:31.360]  determination
[56:31.360 --> 56:33.360]  would not apply to
[56:33.360 --> 56:35.360]  US citizens in lawful residents
[56:35.360 --> 56:37.360]  I'm just wondering is the senator
[56:37.360 --> 56:39.360]  familiar with the fact that it was the administration
[56:39.360 --> 56:41.360]  which asked us to remove
[56:41.360 --> 56:43.360]  the very language
[56:43.360 --> 56:45.360]  the absence of which
[56:45.360 --> 56:47.360]  is now objected to
[56:47.360 --> 56:49.360]  by the senator from Illinois
[56:49.360 --> 56:51.360]  I'm familiar now because the senator from Michigan
[56:51.360 --> 56:53.360]  has shared that fact with me
[56:53.360 --> 56:55.360]  that is the chairman of the armed services
[56:55.360 --> 56:57.360]  committee
[56:57.360 --> 56:59.360]  I've got three or four other senators saying the same thing
[56:59.360 --> 57:01.360]  who were cosponsors
[57:01.360 --> 57:03.360]  so let's get it straight
[57:03.360 --> 57:05.360]  it does affect US citizens
[57:05.360 --> 57:07.360]  you just bought the Psyop
[57:07.360 --> 57:09.360]  this is all a military handbook
[57:09.360 --> 57:11.360]  as they assault you they deny it's an assault
[57:11.360 --> 57:13.360]  then the president comes in
[57:13.360 --> 57:15.360]  he's going to veto it
[57:15.360 --> 57:17.360]  just so there's not opposition to it
[57:17.360 --> 57:19.360]  and then as soon as they get the votes to pass it
[57:19.360 --> 57:21.360]  he comes in and signs it
[57:21.360 --> 57:23.360]  it's a fake handoff
[57:23.360 --> 57:25.360]  again you want to use more football analogies
[57:25.360 --> 57:27.360]  okay
[57:27.360 --> 57:29.360]  I mean we don't have time to play games
[57:29.360 --> 57:31.360]  they're getting ready to launch giant wars
[57:31.360 --> 57:33.360]  and I'm telling you I got their memos
[57:33.360 --> 57:35.360]  they're public I'll cover this when we come back
[57:35.360 --> 57:37.360]  they're getting ready to stage terror attacks
[57:37.360 --> 57:39.360]  and blaming on domestic groups
[57:39.360 --> 57:41.360]  they think we're so dumb
[57:41.360 --> 57:43.360]  they publicly are talking about it in major newspapers
[57:43.360 --> 57:45.360]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com

[58:54.360 --> 58:55.360]  tyranny is here
[58:55.360 --> 58:58.360]  the grim future foretold in 1984

[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.360]  because it's such a big interview
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.360]  and it got picked up by hundreds
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.360]  of blogs and websites well really thousands

[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.360]  and Ron Paul agreed

[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.360]  Al Qaeda has been given control Libya
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.360]  and is being put into Syria
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.360]  and other areas by our government

[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.360]  to fight Al Qaeda
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.360]  that's crazy Jones
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.360]  reads government documents everything he's
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.360]  saying is coming true that makes him even more

[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.360]  took your private bank accounts and doesn't know
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.360]  where the money is because he's a good guy

[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.360]  you can have a football team with a three-corner hat
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.360]  they're all having
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.360]  a big battle right now
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.360]  they're all having

[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.360]  not the absolute
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.360]  total police state
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.360]  control grid coming down on our heads

[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.360]  and get all upset and paint yourself up in war
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.360]  paint the medial say it's normal
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.360]  and good but if you
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.360]  get upset about the military
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.360]  that you pay for and drones
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.360]  now being used against farmers
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.360]  predator drones and the Air Force
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.360]  and and Obama's rural
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.360]  affairs
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.360]  system
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.360]  national council under the Pentagon
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.360]  that is supposed to spy on rural
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.360]  communities and if you get upset
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.360]  about SWAT teams you're going after Amish
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.360]  for selling milk to their neighbors
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.360]  you're a bad person
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.360]  and if you get upset about the military
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.360]  announcing they're now going to be used domestically
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.360]  against the American people and that you can be
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.360]  disappeared into a black hole
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.360]  and then you get the training manuals as nothing to do with Al Qaeda
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.360]  it's all for US citizens
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.360]  why have you raised your voice
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.360]  or get a little frantic about that
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.360]  if you get frantic about Bernie Madoff
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.360]  stealing a hundred billion dollars
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.360]  you're a bad person
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.360]  if you get mad at White House
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.360]  advisor, former head of Goldman Sachs
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.360]  John Corzine lifting
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.360]  1.2 plus billion
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.360]  and saying he doesn't know where the money went
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.360]  as CEO and the feds saying
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.360]  they don't know either as if they can't
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.360]  follow wire transfers when Forbes
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.360]  and others say it's JP Morgan
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.360]  and they say they don't know
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.360]  and the head of the CME group came out
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.360]  the biggest commodity group said
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.360]  no we talked to them they took the money
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360]  out of people's private accounts
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.360]  it's a bank robbery but nobody's going to get in trouble
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.360]  yeah that shouldn't concern you at all
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.360]  you know what
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.360]  in fact it's bad to get upset
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.360]  I'm going to apologize
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.360]  again I mentioned this earlier that I'm going to your phone calls
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.360]  then I'll get more into internet censorship
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:41.360]  and then we got that Ron Paul interview
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360]  that he was on this live
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.360]  re-arrived here for some stations
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.360]  that just carry the Sunday show
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.360]  because it's powerful it's one of the most powerful
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.360]  Ron Paul interviews ever not just one that I've done
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.360]  where he laid it all out and said
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.360]  the National Defense Authorization Act
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.360]  now passed the House and Senate on Obama's desk
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.360]  establishes
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.360]  martial law in America
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.360]  because that's what it does
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.360]  that's what the military
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.360]  on the streets is but it goes one further
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.360]  they can disappear you
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.360]  it's illegitimate
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.360]  fraud
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.360]  they could say that we've all got to worship Santa Claus
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.360]  in a federal law doesn't mean it's so
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.360]  or they can announce they're going to
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.360]  catapult children
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.360]  homeless children and use them
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.360]  as skeet
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.360]  for the president doesn't mean he can do that
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.360]  Hitler could pass whatever law he wanted
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.360]  Stalin or Mao doesn't mean
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.360]  it's legitimate
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360]  it violates the Constitution, Bill of Rights
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.360]  Declaration of Independence, common sense
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.360]  universal law
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.360]  it's a fraud
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.360]  but the crooks in government
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.360]  know they got a 9% approval rating
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.360]  they know the public's awake to them
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.360]  they know the awakenings accelerating
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.360]  and they're scared and so their long
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.360]  backup plans are being activated
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.360]  what came out two weeks ago we were sent the documents
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.360]  with the phone numbers they were confirmed
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360]  to be real documents
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.360]  Homeland Security is now
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.360]  manning the FEMA camps across the country
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.360]  we have the internal emails
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.360]  the maps the documents everything
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.360]  for Halliburton and Kellogg Brown en route
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.360]  and did any mainstream media pick it up
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.360]  zero
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.360]  because that's why they're dying
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.360]  why does info wars get a million visitors a day
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.360]  why does my radio show have 3 million listeners a day
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.360]  because we're real media you
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.360]  aren't
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.360]  you aren't and so what's their plan
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.360]  oh they'll just shut it down
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.360]  and I have a report here how China
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.360]  and Russia
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.360]  the New York Times and others have reported
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360]  use the same system
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.360]  that we're setting up
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.360]  where the Pentagon could shut websites down
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.360]  without due process for copyright
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.360]  or slander and where the government
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.360]  can direct messages over your website
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.360]  when they want that's now happening with EAS
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.360]  alerts over your cell phones as we told you years ago
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.360]  American future
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.360]  Russia and China use copyright laws
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.360]  to crush government criticism here is
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.360]  the Hill newspaper internet
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.360]  piracy bill a free
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.360]  speech kill switch
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.360]  here's AFP
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.360]  and Breitbart internet architects
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.360]  oppose online piracy bills
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.360]  here's the same letter from the AP
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.360]  this is from
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.360]  the inventors of the internet and the real
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.360]  inventors not Al Gore another congenital
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.360]  wire all censorship schemes
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.360]  impact speech beyond the category they were
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.360]  intended to restrict but these bills are
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.360]  particularly egregious in the regard
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.360]  because they cause entire domains to vanish
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.360]  from the web they say a link
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.360]  on a message board to an article
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.360]  they claim is copyright under this
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.360]  they say a link to an article
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.360]  this isn't a joke here
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.360]  a link to a mainstream article is copyright
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.360]  you're not even allowed to link
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.360]  which is how the internet works your site
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.360]  and the entire server system is taken down
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.360]  so it's a reign of terror
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.360]  not just infringing pages or files
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.360]  they say an incredible
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.360]  range of useful law abiding sites
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.360]  can be blacklisted under these proposals
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.360]  already happening folks
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.360]  the signatories have included
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360]  vent surf
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.360]  considered one of the fathers of the internet
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.360]  said censorship of internet infrastructure
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.360]  will invariably cause network errors
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.360]  and security problems and you got Cass Sunstein
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.360]  the regulations are and Obama's administration
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.360]  saying censor the internet
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.360]  shut down people that criticize the government
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.360]  and go one further he says
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.360]  you can go pull this up wait in the Washington Post
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.360]  report it and said well maybe it's reasonable
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.360]  New York magazine when they wrote a profile
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.360]  on me earlier this year said
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.360]  maybe Cass Sunstein's right
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.360]  they said once we shut their sites down
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.360]  then we're gonna arrest them
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.360]  but we gotta first shut the sites down
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.360]  and now they got the army
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.360]  trucks ready to come pick you up at your house
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.360]  oh is everybody
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.360]  gonna do like they did Nazi Germany and go line up
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.360]  I don't think so
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360]  cops like pepper spray and you know
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.360]  college students at sit-ins and stuff
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.360]  or billy clubbing them
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.360]  ooh this is kind of escalating
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.360]  into something that's gonna be too pretty
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.360]  but I know you've had
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.360]  a fluoride head public put up with everything
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.360]  so you think we're sheep
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.360]  you're wolves a nation of sheep will be
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.360]  ruled by wolves Thomas Jefferson
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.360]  don't worry though the system's gonna hurt you too
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.360]  all you so-called enforcers they're gonna hurt you
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.360]  real good
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.360]  an incredible range of useful
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.360]  law-abiding sites can be blacklisted under these proposals
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.360]  the signatories included
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.360]  vent surf and vendor of the internet
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.360]  this is true in China
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.360]  Iran other countries that censor the network today
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.360]  it will be just as true of American
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.360]  censorship they said
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360]  if the US begins to use the its
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.360]  central position in the network
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.360]  for censorship
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.360]  that advances its political and economic agenda
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.360]  because that's what they plan to do with it
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.360]  the consequences will be far-reaching and destructive
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.360]  oh you want me to continue
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.360]  just type in new bill
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.360]  is Chinese censorship model
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.360]  here's another one international business
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.360]  times india a bill
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.360]  aims to suppress internet freedom it says
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.360]  the Pentagon can shut down anything
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.360]  it doesn't like for any reason
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.360]  offensively in America we've already
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.360]  tracked Pentagon servers knocking us down over
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.360]  and over again that's why we ended up spending
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.360]  so much money to build three layer
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.360]  deep constellations of different systems
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.360]  when they shut one down we go okay
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.360]  turn up this back back up
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.360]  I'm already building more backups outside the
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.360]  US but under this it's an international
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.360]  treaty they're going to block that and
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.360]  de-list it from Google oh my gosh
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360]  they've got new systems where they can de-list
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.360]  a voice from the internet
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.360]  they have systems where you hold your iPhone up for years
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.360]  and it picks up whatever the music is you like
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.360]  Christmas music whatever the case is
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.360]  different programs that do that would like Shazam
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.360]  well now
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.360]  what's the name of that program
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.360]  actually Rob has it on his phone
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.360]  pull up iPhone app
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.360]  that could tell you what a song is
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.360]  that's Shazam camera right good I just want to test my memory here
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.360]  the point is now they
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.360]  have those loaded on the internet
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.360]  where my voice
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.360]  has now been banned on
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360]  YouTube in one respect
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.360]  I and I'm going to go to bring
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.360]  come back to your calls I
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.360]  to put in game as a test
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.360]  in stores four years ago and it did become
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.360]  the number one documentary for two months running on
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.360]  Amazon
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.360]  to beat Al Gore's film out for months
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.360]  up
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.360]  up against his head to head
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.360]  surprisingly easy to do
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.360]  I let a distributor I hold the
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.360]  copyright a distributor put it out worldwide
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.360]  the Canadian group
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.360]  that is distributing in Canada
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.360]  put the program on YouTube
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.360]  through their system where my voice
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.360]  we try to upload 30 seconds
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360]  of my film to YouTube
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.360]  boom shuts it down before it goes up
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.360]  not the music my voice
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.360]  now think of the powers
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360]  of that for censorship
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.360]  Alex Jones gone

[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.360]  but also use it like it won't be there tomorrow

[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.360]  a full acre crisis garden
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.360]  of nutritionally dense life sustaining food
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.360]  and the survival seed bank is not just a box
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.360]  of open pollinated seeds
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.360]  it's an indestructible water proof seed bank
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.360]  that can even be buried
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.360]  if we face a real meltdown
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.360]  and here's the best part
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.360]  in the survival seed bank
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360]  go through strict germination testing
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.360]  so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.360]  give a survival seed bank this Christmas

[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.360]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.360]  and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.360]  now you can produce pure
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.360]  and endless colloidal silver
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.360]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.360]  by breathing the solution through the lungs
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.360]  the respiratory system
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.360]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.360]  and viruses
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.360]  the Silver Lungs Generator

[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.360]  with their fingers crossed
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.360]  everybody knows
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.360]  the war is over
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.360]  everybody knows
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.360]  the good guys lost

[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.360]  the fight was fixed
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.360]  the poor stay poor
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.360]  the rich get rich
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.360]  that's how it goes
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.360]  and everybody knows
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.360]  everybody knows
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.360]  everybody doesn't know though
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.360]  they don't understand there's different types
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.360]  of rich people
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.360]  there are the ultra rich
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.360]  that are collectivists
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.360]  that use government to consolidate power
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.360]  and shut down their competition
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.360]  there's the middle class that just wants to be left alone
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.360]  and there's the hard working
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.360]  underclass blue collar
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.360]  that wants to make it into the middle class
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.360]  and then you've now got the giant
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.360]  welfare dependent class
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.360]  that doesn't know what planet they're on in many cases
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.360]  and thinks that anybody with a dollar
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.360]  more than them are the rich guys
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360]  and they'll vote to take guns
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.360]  to bring in socialism
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.360]  whatever as long as they get some money
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.360]  and that's where we stand
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.360]  okay I'm going to go to your phone calls
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360]  but I've tried my best today to sit here and warn you
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.360]  I mean here's even
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360]  MSNBC
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360]  that bill
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.360]  it says it D indexes by search engines
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.360]  blocks internet service providers
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.360]  black balls payment
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.360]  black balls people being able to even be on the internet
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.360]  shuts down free speech
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.360]  shuts down even proxy servers
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.360]  and allows the pentagon to run it all
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.360]  the pentagon running our lives
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.360]  what happens to every third world country
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.360]  the military takes over
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.360]  that is the crooks that run the military takeover
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.360]  this is foreign banks
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.360]  crime bosses that make made off
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.360]  look like a choir boy running our society
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.360]  very simple
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.360]  and if Americans just bow down
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.360]  to authority and bow down
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.360]  to torture and bow down to black uniforms
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.360]  a long long night
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.360]  is coming you think the depression
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.360]  is bad now you ain't seen
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.360]  nothing yet our debt is predominantly
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.360]  owned by China and foreign banks
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.360]  here's a headline China trims holdings
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.360]  of US Treasury debt because
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.360]  of dollar devaluation
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.360]  look they're not gearing up for
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.360]  martial law for no reason and they started
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.360]  getting ready for it when they got rid of glass
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.360]  steel they knew
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.360]  12 years ago what they were
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.360]  doing
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.360]  this is all premeditated
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.360]  because I don't want to hear when all this stuff comes into
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.360]  place well Alex you were right they were
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.360]  going to do it but
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.360]  they just thought of this just now
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.360]  no it's been a long term
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.360]  takeover
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.360]  but what I love is how
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.360]  even though world governments now admitted and it's run
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.360]  by the very groups we said would announce it
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.360]  the big mega brokerage banks
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.360]  and central banks even though we're totally
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.360]  right
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.360]  they have people coming out writing hit pieces
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.360]  the Ron Paul interview is coming up right now
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.360]  let's rampage through your calls

[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.360]  hey uh yeah I'm out here in California
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.360]  little country town out in the middle of San
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.360]  Joaquin Valley and
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.360]  moved out of here well I lived here about 17
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.360]  years ago moved out about 10 and just moved back
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.360]  a year ago yeah right outside your town
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.360]  it was in the news last week
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.360]  that the sheriff meets secretly with the ADL
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.360]  and the feds quote about small government
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.360]  terrorists and they're teaching the
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.360]  locals and the police that tea partiers
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.360]  might need to be arrested that broke
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.360]  last week I'm sorry go ahead oh I'm
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.360]  surrounded by zombies fluoride heads
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.360]  aspartame zombies
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.360]  and gangbangers and my kids
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.360]  they go to school here and every single school
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.360]  here has got fences all the way around
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.360]  they're about seven eight foot tall they're locked
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.360]  in as parents we got to go in there at
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.360]  certain times to go you know pick up our
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.360]  kids or whatever we have to go through the
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.360]  office at a certain time it's all prison
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.360]  training but the illegal aliens are above the
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.360]  law yes yeah and exactly
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.360]  and then and the files that work for the
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.360]  school they don't even run their backgrounds
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.360]  in most states
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.360]  they wanted locked down while they're having fun
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.360]  with the kids that must be it
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360]  and listen yeah we're driving
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.360]  down the freeway we've been noticing there's
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.360]  little black boxes in the middle of the lanes
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.360]  we're thinking maybe license plate readers
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.360]  we don't know and they go down a little further
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.360]  there's like new poles up there with
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.360]  oh no they've got license plate readers
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.360]  in nationwide they're now putting
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.360]  in pulse kill switches in all
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.360]  the new cars they have kill switch systems
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.360]  they've got helicopters a decade ago
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360]  we're all mounted with kill systems
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.360]  but they don't want the enemy that's the
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.360]  American people to know
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.360]  about their secret weapons
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.360]  until they're ready to roll out 15 years
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.360]  ago they had ground penetrating radar
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.360]  they look right through your walls most police
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.360]  departments have it that everything's
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.360]  listened to everything's tracked I was a
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.360]  kook saying it years ago now it's admitted
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.360]  I mean just a total criminal government
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.360]  yeah we've we've got I've had a black

[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.360]  a friend of mine named Don about it and
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360]  he keeps telling me you know
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.360]  that Ron Paul is not going with the

[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.360]  well all right he's trying
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.360]  to say that Ron Paul is just
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.360]  like saying
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.360]  rambling things

[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.360]  and we've got way more than that now in the
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.360]  info war we don't want this to get physical
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.360]  but they'll probably try to start something
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.360]  look your friends okay but he's a coward
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.360]  deep down so he makes excuses
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.360]  I can play I can play four
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.360]  senators who authored and cosponsored the
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.360]  bill I can play the clips

[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.360]  affect citizens
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.360]  that the army times says
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.360]  their training in brigade homeland

[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.360]  on tea partiers that look
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.360]  I've been to the drills before they called
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.360]  it a tea party I've been to the marine
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.360]  corps drills they practice killing people
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.360]  where in John Deere
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.360]  hats and and and
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.360]  in red and white checkered vest
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.360]  they practice killing your granddaddy
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.360]  where the enemy
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.360]  before I went blind I was going to
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.360]  join the military and now that I can't
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.360]  see I don't I did a lot of research on
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.360]  the military and stuff and I'm realizing
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.360]  slowly that all they're doing
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.360]  is is using
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.360]  using us against
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.360]  each other I mean they're trying to
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.360]  pretty much make a civil war
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.360]  on purpose yeah they make it super sexy
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.360]  to torture super sexy
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.360]  to have checkpoints and then
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.360]  it's all about al-qaeda and meanwhile
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.360]  none of it's about al-qaeda behind the scenes
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.360]  Josh good to hear from you just tell your friend
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.360]  enjoy himself then okay
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.360]  just tell him enjoy everything that happens
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.360]  Virgil in Nevada you're on the air go ahead
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.360]  Hi Alex, good afternoon
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.360]  good afternoon Info Warriors nationwide
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.360]  I've been wanting to share
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360]  an idea on the broadcast for some time
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.360]  now maybe let let me know what you think
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.360]  and if it'll work or not
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.360]  and that is what if we were
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.360]  to similar how you do the
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360]  Google bombs go after
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.360]  pro-new world
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.360]  NWO globalist corporations
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.360]  that have an A plus rating with the
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.360]  Better Business Bureau and file complaints
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360]  My only issue
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.360]  is that you'd have to have a real grievance
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360]  with them to file the complaint
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.360]  I mean I know
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.360]  it's a war but I don't ever resort
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.360]  to I'm not saying you're saying this
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.360]  to any dark side tactics
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.360]  or deception because that only gives the enemy
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.360]  power you may get results with
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.360]  lies up front that always manifests
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.360]  in some other greater more evil way
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.360]  I see
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.360]  well I was thinking Coca-Cola
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.360]  if we could maybe go after
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360]  them and
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.360]  regards to
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.360]  they are in the Better Business Bureau
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.360]  and have an A plus rating and I have
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.360]  this I know this
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.360]  if you went blind from their
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.360]  aspartame in their drinks which the studies show it does
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360]  then you could file a complaint on them
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.360]  that's a good idea
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.360]  Coca-Cola funding globalist
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.360]  occupation worldwide in Terany
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.360]  which they do and open borders
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.360]  then I would file a complaint on them for that
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:49.360]  now that's a good idea, Virgil anything else
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.360]  absolutely I just like the
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360]  bombarded corporations worldwide
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.360]  you know I got a point on that
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.360]  we come back and then more of your calls
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.360]  and then Ron Paul stay with us
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.360]  Hundreds of nations have fallen
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.360]  to Terany in the last century alone
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.360]  this is our last chance
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.360]  to not relive history
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.360]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.360]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.360]  at home
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.360]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.360]  in Congress and they really
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.360]  are calling the shots
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.360]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.360]  as American citizens to pay attention
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.360]  for the republic identifies
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.360]  the enemies of our nation
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.360]  the criminal offshore cartel
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.360]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.360]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.360]  they're asking for more matches
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.360]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.360]  today seems like nobody does care
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.360]  and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.360]  we have seen

[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.360]  coming up in the next segment
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.360]  interview I did earlier in the week
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.360]  a lot of stations that don't pick up the weekday show
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.360]  pick up the Sunday night show
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.360]  and so I want people to be able to hear this Ron Paul interview
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.360]  and I've said it
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360]  it's a powerful interview I ever did with him
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.360]  because he lays it down
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.360]  and it's been attacked by a bunch of different newspapers
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.360]  this incredible one
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.360]  out of the weekly standard says
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.360]  the company Ron Paul keeps
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.360]  mean Alex Jones
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.360]  and I'm going to do more on this tomorrow
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.360]  on the 11am show
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.360]  because I just saw this where I went live today
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.360]  Aaron was up here doing some updating of the news sites
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360]  and brought it into me
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360]  because there's literally hundreds of articles
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360]  including dozens of major newspapers about the interview
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360]  take some more calls
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360]  and Aaron brought it into me
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.360]  and I was reading over it
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.360]  and it says basically
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.360]  we're insane that we're worried about the military on the streets of America
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.360]  even though it's already happening in many cases
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360]  people pull up to Marine Corps
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360]  checkpoints you name it in America
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360]  I mean this has been going on for a long time
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.360]  this is called Brigade Homeland
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.360]  TSA checkpoints here on the highway
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.360]  I told you years ago it was going to happen because they said it was
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.360]  I mean it's like
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.360]  shut up Coug we're not going to have checkpoints on the highways
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.360]  but there's a press release by the TSA
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.360]  about
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.360]  that's what's so frustrating
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.360]  and in this weekly standard article
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.360]  by James Kerchick you see everything
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.360]  that's wrong with this country
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.360]  this weird almost schizophrenic craziness
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.360]  where
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.360]  there was a couple articles I saw this week in the weekly standard
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.360]  criticizing the NDAA
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.360]  saying it puts troops on the streets
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.360]  and allows us to be secretly arrested
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.360]  and then there's an article him saying
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.360]  me and Ron Paul are crazy
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.360]  it just doesn't work anymore
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.360]  I mean I remember being told 16 years ago
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.360]  I was crazy that the Federal Reserve was private
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.360]  you guys failed on that front
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360]  now everybody knows it
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.360]  you know
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.360]  your incredible ignorance which I find hard to believe
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.360]  or your deception isn't working anymore
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360]  dinosaur media
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.360]  you're not the mainstream media anymore
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.360]  and that's why you want to censor talk radio
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.360]  and online news
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.360]  and let me tell you something
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.360]  you're picking a fight that's waking people up
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.360]  I've never seen such an awakening
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.360]  as happening right now
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360]  the huge awakening that I saw two weeks ago
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.360]  has been turbo charged
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.360]  to a level I've never seen
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.360]  I'm going to give each caller a minute
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.360]  I want to get to everybody
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.360]  George in Connecticut you're on the air go ahead
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.360]  I don't know if a minute or two it but I'll try
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.360]  quickly I have three points
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360]  I think we should start making
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.360]  of all the pertinent supporting materials
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.360]  pass it out to friends
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.360]  and second point
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.360]  go to police, go to military people
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.360]  homes that we know in our areas
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.360]  talk to them and say look
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.360]  are you going to go Nazi
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.360]  or are you going to go Republic
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.360]  I mean it's a bottom line
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.360]  and otherwise we go swamp fox
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.360]  and you remember when you start picking up families
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.360]  we're going to be going after your families
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.360]  because if you're going to kill us
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.360]  then if it's going to cross that line
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.360]  you've got to realize that there is no line
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.360]  anymore there is no law and order
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.360]  I forgot the first point
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360]  George I've got to stop because I can't go out of the collars
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.360]  you're on fire and what you said
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.360]  we've got to do emergency backups
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.360]  of all the proof
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.360]  because again they wouldn't be trying
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.360]  to bring in censorship if we weren't hurting them
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.360]  which lets us know
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.360]  they're not invincible
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360]  they're a bunch of Kinley, Bernie Madoff, John Corzines
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.360]  it would be so easy
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.360]  to just arrest them all
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.360]  they've all committed treason
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360]  instead they want to arrest us
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.360]  because we're the real Americans
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.360]  and they know it George
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.360]  Third point I just remembered
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.360]  go to every station
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.360]  every newspaper
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.360]  talk to the
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.360]  actual reporters
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.360]  that have reported this bullsh**
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.360]  and go right in their face
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.360]  Sir I've got to let you go
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.360]  I understand you're upset here but we're a broadcast radio station
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.360]  the quickest way to get caught off the air
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.360]  okay we wanted to hear what you had to say
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.360]  and he made great points and I know he's mad
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.360]  he's saying don't go after our families
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.360]  don't destroy the rule of law
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360]  because then there is no law
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.360]  get the hard copies of the films
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.360]  the books the materials
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.360]  again value this information
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.360]  and reach out to reporters
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.360]  and media people and explain to them
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.360]  what they're doing
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.360]  I saw articles this week
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.360]  even after it was national news that the NDAA
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.360]  did affect citizens
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.360]  I saw them attack Ron Paul and myself
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.360]  and say we're liars
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.360]  even when it's admitted
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.360]  now that's conscious disinfo
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.360]  in most of these articles I saw
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360]  were on the editorial pages of newspapers
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.360]  they wouldn't put their name on it
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.360]  folks if a name had known something
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360]  number one
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.360]  if it's a gnome to plume
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.360]  or a gnome to garer
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.360]  I don't respect that
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.360]  I want to see the John Hancock on it
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.360]  you know what
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.360]  I got to Los Angeles to be in a movie
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.360]  and they said we got to follow this paperwork
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360]  and give us your real name on the paperwork
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.360]  and I said it's Alex Jones
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.360]  it's Alexander Emrick Jones
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.360]  yeah that's my name this is me
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.360]  this is who I am
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.360]  okay there's no act here
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.360]  I know what I'm talking about
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.360]  I put it all on the line
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.360]  I face debt every day because I know
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.360]  that I cannot give in to the evil and serve it
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.360]  I cannot put it on my name and my soul
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.360]  I will not be part of it
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.360]  all right
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.360]  Lance in Pennsylvania then V-man
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.360]  Sean Zeke, Sam Donk, Rick and everybody
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.360]  Lance you're on the air go ahead
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.360]  hi Alex great to talk to you
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.360]  the one thing
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.360]  I'm awake I follow everything you're saying
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360]  and I'm with you
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360]  the one thing though
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360]  that I have to kind of question
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.360]  and never really hear it
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.360]  and you just kind of touched on it a little bit
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.360]  every day citizen
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.360]  I mean I post up the link from my Facebook
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.360]  I call my representatives and senators
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.360]  and say don't say yes to this
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.360]  you got to do banner hangs
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.360]  you got to put a pirate system
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.360]  free to your neighborhood and broadcast videos
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.360]  or whatever view HFVHF
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.360]  FMAM you got to get aggressive
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.360]  you got to go
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.360]  you got to do what I do drive around with bullhorns
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.360]  hanging off a car
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.360]  used to when I was on radio one day a week
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.360]  and I was only on X's TV one day a week
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.360]  I'd drive around bullhorns hanging off the roof of my car
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360]  I mean you got to shake people out of their trance
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.360]  you got to get aggressive
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.360]  let me tell you
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.360]  government's so criminal
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360]  if you just start following city people around
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.360]  you're going to find them committing crimes
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.360]  I mean I'm telling you
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.360]  you scratch the paint in this rotten house
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:21.360]  you're going to find evil right behind the paint
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.360]  I mean these evils taking over man
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360]  you can't
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360]  it's all around you
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.360]  you can go in any direction and run into these people
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.360]  you don't have to fix it all yourself
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.360]  you just find your little evil
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.360]  and you get after it right there at point blank range
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.360]  and there's nothing they can do
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.360]  let me tell you something when good people take action
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.360]  no amount of evil can stop you
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.360]  they're scared of you
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.360]  evil people should be scared of good people
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.360]  good people got 10,000 times
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.360]  the power of evil
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.360]  and it's time we stop being buffaloed by them

[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.360]  I need to get Roy Masters back on
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.360]  he started the talk radio network

[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:13.360]  I even told him 6 months ago try to get Roy Masters on
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360]  we have any luck with that
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.360]  I think Roy Masters even sought us out at the time
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.360]  get him on
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:21.360]  I don't even try to talk to talk radio network
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.360]  clear channel all those people
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.360]  whatever

[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.360]  so let's go ahead and take another call here
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.360]  V-Man in Ohio you're on the air
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.360]  yeah Alex
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.360]  been waiting to talk to you Alex
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.360]  I need you to reiterate for the tea party
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.360]  that they are in grave danger
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:41.360]  and that they gotta stand behind and join the resistance
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.360]  and I need you to do one thing for me
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.360]  tell me when the guns come out
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.360]  and I want you to leave when the show
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.360]  go off and play that
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.360]  what if I say I'm not like others
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.360]  what if I say I'm not just another one
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.360]  what if I say
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:57.360]  you're the pretend dog
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.360]  what if I say you're never surrender
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.360]  I love it
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.360]  what if I say that I'll never surrender
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.360]  I love it I love your passion
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.360]  it's that energy listen
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.360]  listen here's the issue we've got to identify
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.360]  the globalists and identify their crimes
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.360]  the pen is 10 times more mighty than the sword
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.360]  we are never offensive
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.360]  we're trying to wake up as many people as we can
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360]  and when the globalist pounce they're gonna have a good surprise
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360]  for them
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.360]  they're planting info weapon time bombs
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.360]  in everybody's mind
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.360]  so they know the truth
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.360]  and when the tyranny comes in
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.360]  and certifies everything we've said
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.360]  that's when the victory comes
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.360]  but I don't want to go to that point
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.360]  they can all just start going to jail
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.360]  like Bernie Madoff and Ken Lay
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.360]  again we are gonna face them down
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.360]  every time tyranny tries to take over
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.360]  it doesn't succeed
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.360]  we need to face them down and get it
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.360]  let me tell you they're scared
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.360]  of the resources we've got in government
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.360]  70 plus percent of all military donations
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:55.360]  both parties

[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.360]  it's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:49.360]  the police state isn't coming

[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:24.360]  In the heart of the Resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:32.360]  You go to infowars.com, there's a big data page up there
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:39.360]  Top story, LinkedIn Red, and it is titled Presidential Front Runner
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:42.360]  Government is establishing martial law
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:48.360]  The government has proven itself totally traitorous when they let Obama launch that war in Libya without congressional approval
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:56.360]  Now here's about 10 minutes of an interview I did, the second half, this is the second half, the first half is up at infowars.com
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:09.360]  The whole interview is posted in that data page with the sponsors of the bills, admitting it censors the internet, admitting it's the end of free speech, admitting they can secretly grab you and throw you in a dungeon for any reason
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:16.360]  Again, there's the headline Presidential Front Runner warns martial law being established in America
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.360]  Infowars.com, get the link, get it out to everybody
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:30.360]  Now here is some of the key parts of the interview with Ron Paul where he talks about fast and furious, and Holder needs some criminal charges for his false flag
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:35.360]  Now this is just common sense, this is just being an American, a constitutionalist
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.360]  But in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:48.360]  I saw the Republicans here in Austin are going to protest Eric Holder, the Attorney General today, because he wants the UN to oversee our elections
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.360]  And I agree, that's certainly out of control and treasonous
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:56.360]  But this is the guy caught perjuring himself in the memo CBS released last week
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.360]  Show that they said they were going to blame the guns in Mexico on the Second Amendment
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.360]  Is that not a form of false flag against our most basic of rights, sir?
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:11.360]  And what would you do, President, to people like Eric Holder?
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:16.360]  Well, he should be immediately fired and then there should be an investigation and find out if charges should be made
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:23.360]  And that's obviously over the top, and all these kind of sting operations and false flag
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:36.360]  This is criminal, and I think they do it constantly, I think they were doing that when there was this so-called attempt to kill the Saudi or the Iranian ambassador
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:41.360]  That kind of stuff is just way too much, but no, they should be investigating
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:54.360]  You know, that's one thing I think the government and the House committee is doing a pretty good job at investigating that, but I don't know whether charges will be made, but they deserve to have charges up against him
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:50:00.360]  Well said, and you got it right the first time, the claim of the youth car salesman wanting to kill the Saudi ambassador
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:05.360]  And even mainstream media had to admit that was totally phony and a pretext to attack Iran
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:13.360]  Yeah, that was the real excuse to blame it on them, and we know that is...
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:19.360]  You know, I just wonder about that whether that guy will ever get tried, because if he does, maybe the truth will come out
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:26.360]  And sometimes they won't try these people because they don't want the truth to come out, so it's just another propaganda stunt, as far as I'm concerned
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:33.360]  Now they want to go after Syria, it's now admitted the US, Israel and others are staging giant military attacks inside Iran
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.360]  What do you make of Congress not being consulted on that?
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:43.360]  Well, unfortunately, that's been happening for a long time, and Congress is just totally negligent on this
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:54.360]  You know, the other night when they were talking about this in the debates, you know, on what the President's responsibility is, is when they shoot down or are able to get one of our drones
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:51:00.360]  And the argument was, should we go in and get it, or should we just go in and destroy it?
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:11.360]  And I tried to get attention on that, my suggestion would be, why don't we avoid it by not sending drones over a sovereign nation, just looking for a problem to start another war
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:21.360]  I mean, they never talked about, you know, the lack of wisdom of having been over there and losing a drone over a foreign nation, which we consider an enemy
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:25.360]  I just think that it's a reflection of a policy that has to be changed
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:32.360]  What's your view on the NDAA and the Indo-Pacific commentatus and the declaration of the whole world as a battlefield?
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:41.360]  Yeah, well, I think the significant difference is not so much in what they have done, but the announcement and the arrogance of it all that they actually put it into law
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:48.360]  You know, our government's been involved with our CIA involvement and they were throwing governments and this for a long, long time
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:57.360]  And of course, last spring, I guess it was in February where the administration admitted that they could assassinate American citizens and now they're putting it into law
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:04.360]  So this to me is an extremely wrong way to go, this is a giant step
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:11.360]  This should be the biggest news going right now, literally legalizing martial law
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:19.360]  But, you know, in our debates, how often does it come up? It didn't come up at all, you know, and then the arrogance, and this is the one thing Rand got stopped
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:29.360]  The arrogance of them trying to push through on their voice vote that if you go through a trial and found innocent, the government wants the right to push in prison for life anyway
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:36.360]  And fortunately, they wanted to do that in voice vote and he finally got a vote on that and that was canceled out
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:46.360]  But that is arrogance of the administration and neglect of the Congress in using their authority and responsibility as well as the people
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:52.360]  That's why it's up to so many of us now to wake the people up because they don't probably realize the significance of it
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:57.360]  But this is big, this is big, you know, the monetary issue is big, all these things I've talked about
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:07.360]  But this step where they can literally arrest American people, American citizens and put them away without a trial and you heard what Lindsey Graham say
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:15.360]  What they ask for a lawyer, tell them no lawyer for you, I mean that is arrogant and bold and dangerous
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:18.360]  That's the hope and pray that we can get that kind of stuff reversed
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:25.360]  Congressman, we've only got a few minutes left with you here and I wanted to continue looking at the presidential race
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:36.360]  What would be the first three things that you would do, the first three goals when you got into office, when you were sworn in in January of 2013?
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:45.360]  Well, there are three big goals, but you might not be able to do as much all by yourself the first few days, but you could change the foreign policy
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:53.360]  Send the message to the world that we are not looking for more wars, we are looking for a more peaceful solution to the problems
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:54:00.360]  And that is to start bringing our troops home, which would send a message that that money is going to be spent at home instead of overseas
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.360]  Might send a message to the market that things will be different
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:11.360]  But then other than that, then it would be working on the budget to cut the spending, you know, my proposal that if we're serious about this we have to cut the budget
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:13.360]  I want to cut it first year at $2 billion
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:18.360]  And the other thing that must be changed is curtailing the power of the Federal Reserve to monetize debt
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:30.360]  And get something passed where we can either or or both, you know, restrain the Federal Reserve to act on its own to print trillions and trillions of dollars in bailing on everybody around the world
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:39.360]  As well as a thorough audit of the Federal Reserve and then find out, you know, find out exactly what they have been doing
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:42.360]  And then aim for legalizing the competing currency
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:52.360]  Some of those messages, if we change our foreign policy, bring our troops home, start balancing the budget, you know, you don't have to wait for everything to be perfect
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:55:00.360]  It's just the direction we're going with people might say, hey, you know, this is different and maybe some optimism would come back, which we need a lot of
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:02.360]  Beautifully said
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:08.360]  What can we do on the campaign trail briefly? And then finally, I know you've written a piece today that's on your congressional side
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:20.360]  It's also on infowords.com about forced drug research where they're trying to psychologically screen the kids, internet kill switch admitted in the Washington Post
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:26.360]  All of this is happening, but what can we do to ensure that you win an Iowa congressman in closing?
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:38.360]  Well, to continue to do what we're doing and if anybody's not involved, want to go to Ron Paul 2012 and find out because people can phone from home, they certainly can raise funds
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:48.360]  People are going out to Iowa, there's activity, but there's a lot of electronic activity going on, you know, with automatic phoning and different things that's done
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:56.360]  This is very, very important. So we're in the last lap here right now. So it's very important that we get maximum effort made
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:06.360]  All right, I was about to say now is the time. Okay, that's just part of the interview. That's kind of the tail end of it when he got into the NDAA and the martial law and the rest of it
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:15.360]  But the first half of the interview is up at info wars.com in the article presidential front runner warrants martial law being established in America
