[01:00.000 --> 01:11.360]  I don't know exactly what's going on in El Paso, but I do know that the media is using
[01:11.360 --> 01:15.720]  the crisis to try to cause a race war in this country, and that the corporate media has
[01:15.720 --> 01:26.280]  been pushing massive, massive, massive cultural division in an attempt to get an explosion.
[01:26.280 --> 01:35.080]  There's been a full-on, full-on press for that, non-stop, continually.
[01:35.080 --> 01:39.040]  How do you explain the frequency of these clearly racist shootings?
[01:39.040 --> 01:43.680]  Well, I think it really mirrors the polarization that's happening in the country, and it's
[01:43.680 --> 01:46.240]  being amplified now to include violence.
[01:46.240 --> 01:50.120]  We've got to acknowledge the hatred, the open racism that we're seeing.
[01:50.120 --> 01:52.520]  There's an environment of it in the United States.
[01:52.520 --> 01:58.560]  We see it on Fox News, we see it on the Internet, but we also see it from our Commander-in-Chief,
[01:58.560 --> 01:59.720]  and he is encouraging this.
[01:59.720 --> 02:01.100]  He doesn't just tolerate it.
[02:01.100 --> 02:02.100]  He encourages it.
[02:02.100 --> 02:08.360]  Calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals warning of an invasion at our border, seeking
[02:08.360 --> 02:11.320]  to ban all people of one religion.
[02:11.320 --> 02:12.320]  Folks are responding to this.
[02:12.320 --> 02:13.840]  It doesn't just offend us.
[02:13.840 --> 02:17.760]  It encourages the kind of violence that we're seeing, including in my hometown of El Paso
[02:17.760 --> 02:18.760]  yesterday.
[02:18.760 --> 02:22.760]  President Trump is a white nationalist.
[02:22.760 --> 02:23.760]  Yes, I do.
[02:23.760 --> 02:27.760]  You don't have to use a lot of imagination to connect the dots here.
[02:27.760 --> 02:33.200]  It is very clear that this kind of hate is being legitimized from on high.
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.440]  And if that were not true, the president would be acting and speaking very, very differently
[02:37.440 --> 02:39.520]  than what he's doing right now.
[02:39.520 --> 02:43.600]  We both know that if this had been a brown or a black-skinned gunman, people would have
[02:43.600 --> 02:46.560]  been talking about terrorism within five or ten minutes.
[02:46.560 --> 02:51.360]  Well, unfortunately, there is a plague of terrorists in this country who are not black
[02:51.360 --> 02:52.360]  or brown-skinned.
[02:52.360 --> 02:57.200]  They are oftentimes lonely white men who are radicalized online, and that is a danger right
[02:57.200 --> 02:58.200]  now.
[02:58.200 --> 03:05.080]  So many years, really, since World War II, young white men have been entitled and privileged
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.920]  in promised and easy life, and if they fight for their country and work hard and follow
[03:10.920 --> 03:14.800]  the rules, they're going to be given a job and a house and a car and a pretty wife and
[03:14.800 --> 03:18.760]  a ticket fence and a golden retriever, and I'm being a little facetious, but the world
[03:18.760 --> 03:22.440]  has changed dramatically in the last seven, five years.
[03:22.440 --> 03:28.040]  And with equity comes great resentment from people who still think that those rules from
[03:28.040 --> 03:30.320]  the last century are still in effect.
[03:30.320 --> 03:34.600]  They don't want to share the playing field with other people, specifically women and
[03:34.600 --> 03:40.520]  immigrants, and they see with resentment that they are failing in life and want to externalize
[03:40.520 --> 03:41.760]  or scapegoat that plane.
[03:41.760 --> 03:48.760]  But there's no question that public rhetoric, stokes, hatred, and racism, and some of that
[03:48.760 --> 03:52.720]  rhetoric has come from the president.
[03:52.720 --> 03:58.840]  Beto, Roark, and all the rest of them up there totally capitalizing on it, blaming the president.
[03:58.840 --> 04:03.960]  When you can clearly blame the Democrats if you believe their official story about what's
[04:03.960 --> 04:09.360]  happened here by foaming all of this up and making it about race war, when Trump's not
[04:09.360 --> 04:14.000]  made about race or your color or where you're from, he's made about the law, well, they're
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.600]  the ones that are invoking all this hate, always saying that Trump is the one that is
[04:19.600 --> 04:21.400]  invoking it all.
[04:21.400 --> 04:23.600]  Hate has no place in our country.
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.400]  You know why I question mass shootings, because real mass shootings happen.
[04:27.400 --> 04:31.160]  We have a lot of evil, sick people in the world.
[04:31.160 --> 04:32.320]  But why do mass shootings happen?
[04:32.320 --> 04:35.120]  They're statistically still rare, but the media hypes them up.
[04:35.120 --> 05:01.000]  And so mentally ill people begin to think it's how they become superstars.
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.960]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[05:04.960 --> 05:09.320]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.240]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by
[05:13.240 --> 05:17.400]  some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.400]  independent of all that.
[05:18.400 --> 05:24.240]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[05:24.240 --> 05:28.080]  and freedom of speech, that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[05:28.080 --> 05:32.360]  the country that they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[05:32.360 --> 05:36.000]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.840]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.960]  who have been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to
[05:43.960 --> 05:48.560]  have or express or hear and the Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[05:48.560 --> 05:52.920]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[05:52.920 --> 05:53.920]  freedom.
[05:53.920 --> 05:58.400]  There has been an unprecedented onslaught of deep platforming, defamation, lawfare and
[05:58.400 --> 06:10.800]  libel targeting youth.
[06:10.800 --> 06:17.320]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[06:17.320 --> 06:19.040]  Well so does he.
[06:19.040 --> 06:26.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:26.040 --> 06:34.000]  It's Monday, August 5th, 2019, I have your host Alex Jones kicking off the main broadcast
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.040]  right now as we speak from Austin, Texas.
[06:39.040 --> 06:45.520]  200,000 plus people have been killed according to the Mexican government in the last decade
[06:45.520 --> 06:50.160]  who were civilians in the drug cartel wars.
[06:50.160 --> 06:55.520]  Thousands of them children, many people tortured to death, their heads cut off.
[06:55.520 --> 07:01.080]  Most of the deaths were caused though by firearms and Mexico has a complete ban on the civilian
[07:01.080 --> 07:07.120]  ownership of firearms but Mexico has a crime rate and a firearms death rate that is the
[07:07.120 --> 07:15.640]  second highest in the world only after Guatemala that also has a total ban on guns.
[07:15.640 --> 07:19.400]  And so when you see President Trump out there saying oh we need to look at mental health,
[07:19.400 --> 07:25.840]  we need to look at more screening, we need to look at all these things, that's fine.
[07:25.840 --> 07:31.800]  But what about the elephant in the room that the crime in this country is in pockets like
[07:31.800 --> 07:38.680]  Chicago and other leftist areas and that mass shootings are on a slight uptick but statistically
[07:38.680 --> 07:46.040]  still you don't even have 100 people a year dying in them, which is still terrible.
[07:46.040 --> 07:51.800]  But tens of thousands dying in automobile crashes, 2,000 a year dying on average from
[07:51.800 --> 07:54.640]  firearms in Chicago.
[07:54.640 --> 07:59.160]  But those people are dehumanized because it's drug related, you never hear about it.
[07:59.160 --> 08:07.560]  But when it's a right winger supposedly, the entire corporate media jumps in and throws
[08:07.560 --> 08:12.960]  the kitchen sink at things and says it's Trump's fault, it's Alex Jones' fault, it's
[08:12.960 --> 08:16.560]  the governor of Texas' fault, you gotta turn your guns in.
[08:16.560 --> 08:21.200]  Oh, so that nobody can fight back against crazies?
[08:21.200 --> 08:29.120]  Now in every case where they have social media that we're able to see, these shooters are
[08:29.120 --> 08:35.160]  obsessed with shoot-em-up video games, they're in cells, they all basically look the same
[08:35.160 --> 08:43.240]  and they say that they're in to the occult, almost all of them.
[08:43.240 --> 08:48.680]  There was another shooter a few years ago, remember down by Galveston, South of Houston
[08:48.680 --> 08:52.960]  and he was into Satanism and he was mad at everybody.
[08:52.960 --> 08:59.640]  Well, guess what, the individual who's a big Antifa leftist on his Facebook, on his
[08:59.640 --> 09:05.080]  Instagram, Paul Watson's written a big article about it with screenshots of it, said, I love
[09:05.080 --> 09:15.240]  Satan, I hate Christians, I hate Trump supporters and so he was wearing a mask and ear protection
[09:15.240 --> 09:22.800]  and all the rest of it, just like the other shooter in El Paso, Texas, isn't that interesting.
[09:22.800 --> 09:32.320]  Always the same MO, over and over and over and over again.
[09:32.320 --> 09:40.120]  The preeminent article breaking it all down is on infowars.com and newswars.com by Paul
[09:40.120 --> 09:47.120]  Joseph Watson and we're gonna be going over all of it here today but you look at the photos
[09:47.120 --> 09:54.280]  of him, they took himself, what an evil, evil eyes, always got that weird, lazy, satisfied
[09:54.280 --> 09:57.120]  look, that's the look of demon possession.
[09:57.120 --> 10:02.680]  That's the look they've all got, that sick, enjoyable look, how much he loves Elizabeth
[10:02.680 --> 10:08.960]  Warren, how much he loves Bernie Sanders, how he wants to kill fascist and he loves
[10:08.960 --> 10:09.960]  Antifa.
[10:09.960 --> 10:18.720]  Now I can't wait to go to hell and serve Satan and he hails Satan, almost every one
[10:18.720 --> 10:25.440]  of them when you dig is into the same thing but here's the big issue I'm gonna tackle
[10:25.440 --> 10:33.360]  first, President Trump came out after the Vegas massacre that was an internal Saudi
[10:33.360 --> 10:39.600]  Arabian Civil War, they used a CIA, US gun dealer to bring guns to the hotel room to
[10:39.600 --> 10:44.240]  get around the fact that they couldn't fly in with the guns, there were 10,000 Saudis
[10:44.240 --> 10:49.160]  meeting in Vegas, they flew in on their jets from the Saudi military, mainly the Saudi
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.520]  Air Force was having a convention there, ground prince was there all nine yards, he was in
[10:53.520 --> 11:00.920]  the same hotel, he goes believing he's gonna sell weapons to them, they kill him and then
[11:00.920 --> 11:04.960]  carry out the mass attack as a way to terrorize Trump and embarrass Trump, you saw Trump
[11:04.960 --> 11:11.160]  then overthrow the Saudi establishment and get them back in line, but that's what really
[11:11.160 --> 11:15.640]  happened there, you notice the media dropped it real quick and still they won't say what
[11:15.640 --> 11:23.840]  happened, well I was told by the FBI hostage rescue team, that's really the SWAT team,
[11:23.840 --> 11:30.040]  directly the morning after, specifically about the paraphernalia, the Islamic paraphernalia
[11:30.040 --> 11:36.680]  that he was a gun dealer, that he, that there was anti-filterator, but that it was a Saudi
[11:36.680 --> 11:45.160]  situation gone awry and later all that information came out, but notice they dropped it real
[11:45.160 --> 11:50.920]  quick, hundreds dead, but you don't hear anything about that now, they want you to forget but
[11:50.920 --> 11:58.800]  not this, oh this is done because Trump wants to kill Hispanics and Trump's out to get Hispanics
[11:58.800 --> 12:04.920]  and oh don't vote for Trump because he's a, he's a Nazi, Trump comes out and decries
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.760]  all of this and says we need red flag laws that even Ted Cruz is pushing, we already
[12:09.760 --> 12:15.880]  have laws where if you threaten to kill somebody your guns are taken, but this is now, oh someone
[12:15.880 --> 12:20.800]  feels threatened, you didn't even say anything, accelerated due process is what Trump calls
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.200]  it, that's not due to process, and see what Trump does is remember last year Pelosi's
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.800]  in the White House and she says well can we compromise on guns, he says yeah, tell me
[12:29.800 --> 12:36.120]  whatever you want we'll try to do it, we'll see if we can do it and then she says I want
[12:36.120 --> 12:41.960]  to ban all guns and then they couldn't pass anything because Trump tricked her, I was
[12:41.960 --> 12:47.960]  in on conversations with folks high level in the NRA right before that meeting happened
[12:47.960 --> 12:53.000]  who'd met with Trump and said don't worry when Trump does this it's to get them to admit
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.560]  they want to ban the guns because then he can politically neutralize them, he can take
[12:59.560 --> 13:04.520]  all their criticism away and then they're going to call for total gun confiscation and
[13:04.520 --> 13:11.520]  then they'll get nothing, okay, but the big headline info wars dot com today is is Trump
[13:11.520 --> 13:21.360]  a Trojan horse will he take our guns because even playing along with this even though it's
[13:21.360 --> 13:26.840]  expedient at the time builds the idea that every time there's a mass shooting that we've
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.800]  got to take the guns so it never happens again even though I have a stack of statistics around
[13:31.800 --> 13:39.480]  the world here of the 200 million people killed the last century, tens of millions this century
[13:39.480 --> 13:46.880]  last 19 years in countries where only the government or select tribes have the weapons
[13:46.880 --> 13:52.520]  called a fate worse than death and you'll have 10 20 30 times the number of people being
[13:52.520 --> 13:59.960]  killed in a Rwanda or or or in a Syria or in any of these places where the public is
[13:59.960 --> 14:04.360]  disarmed and a foreign group just comes in and takes over or the drug cartels that don't
[14:04.360 --> 14:06.880]  even follow laws.
[14:06.880 --> 14:12.920]  Every major Mexican city is devastated is collapsed with almost no tourism now the hotel prices
[14:12.920 --> 14:20.000]  are a third what they were just a year ago because while I was even in Cancun this year
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.920]  and was warned by our security you need to go another place believe me the US news doesn't
[14:23.920 --> 14:28.760]  cover it there have been killings kidnappings murders here every day they they went showed
[14:28.760 --> 14:33.800]  me the places we left went to another area while we were there a police officer was shot
[14:33.800 --> 14:41.600]  in the back of the head ladies and gentlemen the public has no guns so when we come back
[14:41.600 --> 14:48.520]  we're gonna break this down but here's the final equation and everybody knows it everybody
[14:48.520 --> 14:59.000]  understands it it's that we have an evil problem ladies and gentlemen in this country we have
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.680]  a problem with Satanism we have a problem with corruption we have a problem with evil
[15:05.680 --> 15:12.560]  and just a spirit of selfishness growing where we kill already born babies what about them
[15:12.560 --> 15:17.280]  being protected they harvest their organs they're making human animal hybrids that's
[15:17.280 --> 15:23.200]  now all over the news and notice all of this distracts from the giant industrial level pedophile
[15:23.200 --> 15:35.600]  scheme going on with Jeffrey Epstein and all of this and right on time right on time individuals
[15:35.600 --> 15:43.800]  clearly with Antifa in cell MO who say they love Satan and they love Democrats and they
[15:43.800 --> 15:52.360]  want a universal wage the guy in El Paso said all that well remember that's why we have
[15:52.360 --> 15:57.320]  guns protect us from maniacs in times of evil and we're entering one of those times of evil
[15:57.320 --> 16:01.320]  the trump clips are straight ahead most of you know that heart disease is the number

[18:22.560 --> 18:30.440]  is true as long as we stay true to our clothes as long as we remember our great history as
[18:30.440 --> 18:37.320]  long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future then there will be nothing that
[18:37.320 --> 18:54.920]  America can not do info wars dot com tomorrow's news today full power the republic in the name
[18:54.920 --> 19:01.400]  of jesus christ full power damn the torpedoes go straight at him before i started working
[19:01.400 --> 19:07.280]  at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and in force dot com but also the products
[19:07.280 --> 19:10.960]  at info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info wars store
[19:10.960 --> 19:16.280]  dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember
[19:16.280 --> 19:20.720]  when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres
[19:20.720 --> 19:25.400]  and telomere support with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what
[19:25.400 --> 19:31.440]  telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your
[19:31.440 --> 19:36.680]  telomere so i started looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is
[19:36.680 --> 19:41.960]  an elite supplement and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive
[19:41.960 --> 19:48.080]  supplements for telomere support and they came and they went but dna force plus is still
[19:48.080 --> 19:53.360]  there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know
[19:53.360 --> 19:58.840]  it's expensive so you should take advantage of fifty percent off dna force plus at info
[19:58.840 --> 20:26.000]  wars store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show the fact is they try to take
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.720]  our firearms it's going to cause a real civil war and we won't be like leftists that go
[20:31.720 --> 20:36.480]  target innocent men women and children because their skin color their little staged events
[20:36.480 --> 20:41.720]  now it'll be the leadership of the globalist operation that's another telltale sign about
[20:41.720 --> 20:47.040]  these mass shootings a lot of them are obviously being provocateur and staged but it's the
[20:47.040 --> 20:52.480]  media itself hyping it up giving it attention that does cause this very rare phenomenon
[20:52.480 --> 20:57.320]  to become now more commonplace those statistically out of three hundred forty million americans
[20:57.320 --> 21:02.520]  it's one of the rarest ways to be killed but the media just like shark attacks maybe seven
[21:02.520 --> 21:07.640]  people a year get killed by great white sharks but they'll see a great white shark siding
[21:07.640 --> 21:11.640]  off of nand tuckett or something on the east coast and no one will get in the water and
[21:11.640 --> 21:15.560]  then the tourist towns will just dry up fact after jaws came out in the early seventies
[21:15.560 --> 21:22.120]  for a decade they had more than half the public stopped going to the beach around the world
[21:22.120 --> 21:27.600]  and they had to do ads in the newspaper saying it's very rare but imagine the media hyped
[21:27.600 --> 21:34.480]  up shark attacks you'd have empty beaches again and I stand we have an archetypal fear
[21:34.480 --> 21:38.880]  of a shark an archetypal fear of going to walmart and some crazy person coming and shooting
[21:38.880 --> 21:43.080]  us but the truth is you've got a lot better chance of somebody trying to break in your
[21:43.080 --> 21:47.880]  house with a gun in cities where the public's been disarmed because let me tell you thieves
[21:47.880 --> 21:51.440]  will break in your car and stuff in most areas of texas but they don't come in your house
[21:51.440 --> 21:56.080]  because they'll get their ass blown off home invasions are very rare here in chicago in
[21:56.080 --> 22:03.720]  new york and detroit in every leftist area like baltimore maryland they are epidemic
[22:03.720 --> 22:10.120]  but you know what's going to happen if they try to take our firearms crime drop in the
[22:10.120 --> 22:16.120]  last nine years real violent crime because more guns means less crime britain took the
[22:16.120 --> 22:22.720]  guns 15 16 years ago tripling of your overall violent crime true we have a higher gun violence
[22:22.720 --> 22:27.800]  level but overall mugging stabbing deaths you those men raped that woman in india to
[22:27.800 --> 22:32.920]  death with an iron rod four feet long you can't ban the iron rods the guns the iron
[22:32.920 --> 22:38.440]  rods pierced didn't do it the tyrants did it hitler took the guns Stalin took the guns
[22:38.440 --> 22:42.880]  mal took the guns that el castro took the guns you go show this took the guns and I'm here
[22:42.880 --> 22:48.600]  to tell you 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms doesn't matter how
[22:48.600 --> 22:52.400]  many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken
[22:52.400 --> 22:57.320]  we will not relinquish them do you understand that's why you're going to fail in the establishment
[22:57.320 --> 23:02.200]  knows no matter how much propaganda the republic will rise again when you attempt to take our
[23:02.200 --> 23:07.160]  guns and that's been their goal all along and all the major democrat candidates say
[23:07.160 --> 23:13.280]  just ban them take them all that's their goal take the and I've got all the articles right
[23:13.280 --> 23:17.000]  here the shooter a couple years ago that killed all those poor people at that baptist church
[23:17.000 --> 23:25.200]  in south texas but it was a citizen with a gun took him out he was trying to kill more
[23:25.200 --> 23:31.800]  that individual ladies and gentlemen had been an air force mental institution and have been
[23:31.800 --> 23:36.720]  adjudicated with a dishonorable discharge and they could not own a gun the air force
[23:36.720 --> 23:44.960]  didn't put it in the database oh gee and then he had some special psychiatric handlers connected
[23:44.960 --> 23:53.280]  to DARPA oh and the latest shooter his daddy is in a cult and is a psychologist that runs
[23:53.280 --> 24:02.800]  government programs for PTSD and troops hmm Saturday when it happened I told reporters
[24:02.800 --> 24:06.640]  I said check in and see if this guy's family or psychologist and it just so happened that
[24:06.640 --> 24:14.200]  was the case it's very interesting so why'd you let him out of the mental institution
[24:14.200 --> 24:20.360]  see but so now they didn't follow the law they let him have a gun because the government
[24:20.360 --> 24:24.080]  didn't put him in the database and now the answer is well if somebody thinks you're dangerous
[24:24.080 --> 24:30.080]  or scary you know you didn't threaten anybody we're going to take your guns well that's what
[24:30.080 --> 24:36.400]  they already do in areas like California and New York here's president trump really playing
[24:36.400 --> 24:47.680]  with fire fourth we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety
[24:47.680 --> 24:53.680]  do not have access to firearms and that if they do those firearms can be taken through
[24:53.680 --> 25:02.200]  rapid due process that is why I have called for red flag laws also known as extreme risk
[25:02.200 --> 25:10.520]  protection orders today I'm also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation
[25:10.520 --> 25:19.200]  ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty and
[25:19.200 --> 25:25.680]  that this capital punishment be delivered quickly decisively and without years of needless
[25:25.680 --> 25:33.640]  delay yeah the coward up in Ohio within five seconds was shot dead by police five seconds
[25:33.640 --> 25:42.720]  five seconds but that wasn't before he could spray the bullets into all those people reload
[25:42.720 --> 25:50.880]  and spray again unbelievable again ladies and gentlemen the man said that he worships
[25:50.880 --> 25:59.440]  Satan hates Christians and wants to go to hell as soon as possible oh but oh it's the
[25:59.440 --> 26:05.200]  gun it's not another liberal I mean look at this guy here TV viewer if you just look at
[26:05.200 --> 26:12.800]  the face it's that same weird in a love with themselves sickening baby face that all these
[26:12.800 --> 26:26.840]  guys have almost every one of them says they love Satan love Satan yeah no kidding gee
[26:26.840 --> 26:32.880]  Satanist are going around killing people dressing in black gee we always heard that in the old
[26:32.880 --> 26:37.960]  times oh that's a conspiracy there's no devil worshipers there's no pedophilia there's nothing
[26:37.960 --> 26:43.920]  going on of course there is there always has been some people but in the old days we dealt
[26:43.920 --> 26:49.000]  with them the village would recognize them the first time they got caught doing something
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.280]  weird and sick well you know what the village would do and usually their parents will even
[26:56.280 --> 27:04.240]  join in beating their brains out people didn't put up with this kind of crap the old days
[27:04.240 --> 27:08.160]  you acted sick and weird said you wanted to kill kids got caught doing something weird
[27:08.160 --> 27:20.760]  well where'd Bob go well nobody knows where old Bob went the last 10 shooters or so all
[27:20.760 --> 27:30.800]  said they hated Christians and that they love Satan except the El Paso shooter because they've
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.640]  expunged all the stuff and then putting fake stuff up about how he's a Trump supporter
[27:34.640 --> 27:45.280]  you know that's admitted that his social media was anti-Trump Democrat I mean there's screenshots
[27:45.280 --> 27:49.440]  of it it's confirmed it didn't matter it all got put out there it all got force fed on
[27:49.440 --> 27:55.920]  Saturday we've been banned from the larger internet we couldn't counter it and so now
[27:55.920 --> 28:04.920]  it is the accepted fact that the supposed lone shooter in El Paso, Texas was a Trump
[28:04.920 --> 28:09.880]  supporter even though we have all the screenshots from his social media and they changed it
[28:09.880 --> 28:20.040]  we ought to be asking who changed it within 30 minutes who was able to do that think about
[28:20.040 --> 28:25.680]  that think about that long and hard those articles are on info wars.com they're on news wars.com
[28:25.680 --> 28:31.680]  gateway pundit did a story on it but be sure you go read Paul Watson's article and read
[28:31.680 --> 28:38.800]  how much he hates oh oh he's for gun control too of course you're for gun control oh oh
[28:38.800 --> 28:48.640]  and the supposed shooter in El Paso his daddy isn't just a guy that ran a psychiatric facility
[28:48.640 --> 28:57.320]  no no no no no no not just in a cult he admits but also something else he's for gun control
[28:57.320 --> 29:04.400]  oh yes heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure and high cholesterol

[31:03.920 --> 31:07.360]  but I decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements and that if you
[31:07.360 --> 31:11.160]  go back five six years ago before all the censorship of the tax and fake lawsuits the
[31:11.160 --> 31:14.600]  rest of it I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and
[31:14.600 --> 31:18.400]  why they were and I'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead
[31:18.400 --> 31:21.920]  the last few years I'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down
[31:21.920 --> 31:24.640]  the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[31:24.640 --> 31:29.240]  wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[31:29.240 --> 31:34.800]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't
[31:34.800 --> 31:38.880]  say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[31:38.880 --> 31:42.480]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all
[31:42.480 --> 31:46.520]  drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do
[31:46.520 --> 31:50.280]  different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[31:50.280 --> 31:55.640]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest info wars store dot com
[31:55.640 --> 32:08.080]  or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[32:08.080 --> 32:34.840]  and
[32:34.840 --> 32:39.920]  In 4's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[32:39.920 --> 32:44.660]  real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an independent
[32:44.660 --> 32:45.660]  free press.
[32:45.660 --> 32:49.300]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to
[32:49.300 --> 32:53.420]  try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling
[32:53.420 --> 32:55.040]  us the whole time it's not happening.
[32:55.040 --> 32:56.840]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[32:56.840 --> 33:03.520]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw, even it is what you just saw.
[33:03.520 --> 33:10.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:33.520 --> 34:00.720]  The first lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their
[34:00.720 --> 34:04.600]  families and the survivors.
[34:04.600 --> 34:09.600]  We will stand by their side forever, we will never forget.
[34:09.600 --> 34:17.560]  These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation
[34:17.560 --> 34:21.020]  and a crime against all of humanity.
[34:21.020 --> 34:30.200]  We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil, the cruelty, the hatred, the malice,
[34:30.200 --> 34:33.040]  the bloodshed and the terror.
[34:33.040 --> 34:39.360]  Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands and wives
[34:39.360 --> 34:43.920]  were ripped from their arms and their lives.
[34:43.920 --> 34:46.880]  America weeps for the fallen.
[34:46.880 --> 34:52.680]  We are a loving nation and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful and
[34:52.680 --> 34:55.080]  loving society.
[34:55.080 --> 34:58.920]  Together we lock arms to shoulder the grief.
[34:58.920 --> 35:06.640]  We ask God in heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer and we vow to act with urgent
[35:06.640 --> 35:09.080]  resolve.
[35:09.080 --> 35:15.160]  I want to thank the many law enforcement personnel who responded to these atrocities with the
[35:15.160 --> 35:20.000]  extraordinary grace and courage of American heroes.
[35:20.000 --> 35:28.440]  I have spoken with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine as well as Mayor
[35:28.440 --> 35:37.920]  DeMargo of El Paso, Texas and Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio to express our profound sadness
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.760]  and unfailing support.
[35:41.760 --> 35:48.640]  Today we also send the condolences of our nation to President Obrador of Mexico and
[35:48.640 --> 35:54.840]  all the people of Mexico for the loss of their citizens in the El Paso shooting.
[35:54.840 --> 35:58.080]  Terrible, terrible thing.
[35:58.080 --> 36:06.000]  I have also been in close contact with Attorney General Barr and FBI Director Ray.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.520]  Federal authorities are on the ground and I have directed them to provide any and all
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.840]  assistance required, whatever is needed.
[36:16.840 --> 36:24.640]  The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate.
[36:24.640 --> 36:32.120]  In one voice our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy.
[36:32.120 --> 36:36.040]  These sinister ideologies must be defeated.
[36:36.040 --> 36:38.760]  Hate has no place in America.
[36:38.760 --> 36:45.640]  Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart and devours the soul.
[36:45.640 --> 36:52.280]  We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt
[36:52.280 --> 36:58.280]  hate crimes and domestic terrorism, whatever they need.
[36:58.280 --> 37:05.280]  We must recognize that the Internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize, disturb
[37:05.280 --> 37:09.560]  minds and perform demented acts.
[37:09.560 --> 37:15.920]  We must shine light on the dark recesses of the Internet and stop mass murders before
[37:15.920 --> 37:18.000]  they start.
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.240]  The Internet likewise is used for human trafficking, illegal drug distribution and so many other
[37:25.240 --> 37:27.200]  heinous crimes.
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.120]  The perils of the Internet and social media cannot be ignored.
[37:32.120 --> 37:36.960]  We're going to get to more of this later, but I totally agree with Trump about unity.
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.080]  The globalist chai-com controlled media is creating division, trying to create a race
[37:41.080 --> 37:42.080]  war.
[37:42.080 --> 37:49.920]  But saying that the Internet is what radicalized this guy, we don't even know that.
[37:49.920 --> 37:57.440]  An 8-chan is full of trolls, full of government operatives, full of some good people as well,
[37:57.440 --> 37:59.640]  but it's total free-for-all.
[37:59.640 --> 38:01.400]  It constantly attacks me.
[38:01.400 --> 38:02.400]  That's fine.
[38:02.400 --> 38:03.400]  That's their first amendment.
[38:03.400 --> 38:12.120]  The fact that this individual supposedly uploaded this manifesto to 8-chan, and now 8-chan's
[38:12.120 --> 38:18.680]  been taken down off of their Internet provider, is beyond dangerous, ladies and gentlemen,
[38:18.680 --> 38:27.200]  and next they're talking about taking away URLs as well as if 8-chan caused this individual
[38:27.200 --> 38:28.600]  to go and do this.
[38:28.600 --> 38:39.480]  That's just preposterous, and it's, again, very, very dangerous to have Trump going down
[38:39.480 --> 38:41.360]  that avenue.
[38:41.360 --> 38:47.280]  But that's where they're going, and that's what they're doing.
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.920]  And you could say, well, Trump's just politically getting ahead of this, sure.
[38:52.920 --> 38:57.600]  But then that allows the lie to continue, that there's an epidemic of white supremacist
[38:57.600 --> 39:02.440]  killing people, and it allows the idea to be pushed, that it's guns that have done the
[39:02.440 --> 39:09.080]  killing, and it allows the lie to be pushed, that we need to blame the Internet and free
[39:09.080 --> 39:15.800]  flow of ideas for what this individual did when Trump's been doing very little to stop
[39:15.800 --> 39:20.440]  the massive censorship of conservatives, nationalists, gun owners, Christians, veterans,
[39:20.440 --> 39:21.920]  you name it.
[39:21.920 --> 39:29.760]  And so, if Trump is a Trojan horse in anything, it's that he has not been a big defender of
[39:29.760 --> 39:43.440]  free speech, and he is beginning to slide towards gun control, which is only going to
[39:43.440 --> 39:51.680]  encourage the establishment out there to provocateur and wind up more individuals like this, because
[39:51.680 --> 39:57.280]  you take what happened last year on Valentine's Day in Parkland, Florida.
[39:57.280 --> 40:03.840]  We had students on, it was on local news as well, people were shooting interviews, the
[40:03.840 --> 40:07.720]  news wouldn't air it, but that they'd be talking to news cameras, and people hold up their
[40:07.720 --> 40:12.560]  cell phones and record, witness after witness saying the police stood down for 20, 30 minutes,
[40:12.560 --> 40:13.960]  no one came in.
[40:13.960 --> 40:17.600]  I still heard shots going off when I saw the supposed shooter.
[40:17.600 --> 40:20.800]  We just reported that, and they didn't like the fact that it was getting tens of millions
[40:20.800 --> 40:26.680]  of views, and CNN said that one of the students we had on was an actor, and that we had a
[40:26.680 --> 40:32.360]  fake actor on, so they made it up that I said the kids were actors when I didn't say that,
[40:32.360 --> 40:35.760]  and that nobody got shot when I didn't say that, and then they turned around and said
[40:35.760 --> 40:40.080]  that I was using actors on the show.
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.880]  The level of lying is insane by these people.
[40:44.880 --> 40:51.400]  We're going to go to break, and we come back, I've done too much preparation for this show,
[40:51.400 --> 40:52.560]  my head is spinning.
[40:52.560 --> 40:58.520]  I don't just put these hundreds of articles out here, it was a prop where look, I've got
[40:58.520 --> 41:07.200]  all the research, I learned a long time ago that computers can crash, they change stories,
[41:07.200 --> 41:13.600]  they remove stories, so I've been on there 25 years, for 25 years, used to it took like
[41:13.600 --> 41:18.640]  a couple minutes to load an article, remember that 25 years ago, so I learned that if I
[41:18.640 --> 41:24.360]  got an article loaded, I would print it, I would sit around the radio, a news talk station
[41:24.360 --> 41:30.120]  and watch folks writing notes about articles online, and then they'd even bitch at some
[41:30.120 --> 41:34.560]  people and say you're using all the print paper, the sales guys need it, so I started
[41:34.560 --> 41:42.720]  just bringing in my own printer, my own paper, and I said you know what, I'm going to print
[41:42.720 --> 41:47.800]  every damn article I look at, because it's something for me to remember, so I have a
[41:47.800 --> 41:54.320]  record of it, and that's why we do this, but I've got all this research here, and buried
[41:54.320 --> 42:01.840]  in all this while we're focused on this shooting, and these events is human animal hybrids,
[42:01.840 --> 42:08.120]  it's now all over the news, world government, mark of the beast, global internet ID, you'll
[42:08.120 --> 42:13.480]  buy and sell if you're not a good leftist, they're actually saying that, prophecy is
[42:13.480 --> 42:19.520]  being fulfilled, and you don't believe in God, this is a nightmare system that if Satan
[42:19.520 --> 42:24.440]  didn't exist, they're building it, if Satan didn't real, they're sure as hell fans of
[42:24.440 --> 42:30.480]  the archetype and they're building it, so it's all coming up today, ladies and gentlemen,
[42:30.480 --> 42:35.360]  and I'll do the best job I can, but this is all just mind-blowing at this point, the big
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.080]  way to get around the censors, because they fought hard to remove us off air, ahead of
[42:39.080 --> 42:43.800]  all of what's coming, and the only ace in the hole they had was to stage these attacks
[42:43.800 --> 42:48.640]  or provocateur them, and now you see it happening with the election, and the FBI's warning,
[42:48.640 --> 42:52.720]  look out for copycats, no kidding, this is going to get a lot worse for it, it's better,
[42:52.720 --> 42:59.840]  so the answer is, keep your eyes peeled and be armed, good guys, stop bad guys, the globalists
[42:59.840 --> 43:05.320]  are hyper-competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are control freaks
[43:05.320 --> 43:09.040]  in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own
[43:09.040 --> 43:14.520]  decisions hits on the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods, now we're fighting
[43:14.520 --> 43:18.520]  them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the 3rd dimension, but
[43:18.520 --> 43:22.600]  one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control
[43:22.600 --> 43:27.680]  in our lives is our bodies, if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from Forrest
[43:27.680 --> 43:33.520]  Life.com, I couldn't do it, that's why we decided to take our original Secret 12, it
[43:33.520 --> 43:39.960]  was incredibly high quality, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12,
[43:39.960 --> 43:45.120]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[43:45.120 --> 43:50.520]  to find anywhere, it is amazing, experience pure, Medica B12 for yourself, and fund the
[43:50.520 --> 43:58.760]  second American evolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or
[43:58.760 --> 43:59.760]  AAA-253-3139.
[43:59.760 --> 44:00.760]  Alex.
[44:00.760 --> 44:01.760]  Yes.
[44:01.760 --> 44:02.760]  I got a plug for the Patriot points I get.
[44:02.760 --> 44:03.760]  Oh thanks.
[44:03.760 --> 44:07.640]  I got $180 so far this year, and I feel like I'm stealing from you, I buy so much in the
[44:07.640 --> 44:10.160]  store because I mean I don't want to give that money to Walmart, I don't want to give
[44:10.160 --> 44:13.480]  that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in, so I'd rather
[44:13.480 --> 44:16.880]  give that money to you, and they're getting quality products, the products that I do receive
[44:16.880 --> 44:21.560]  have changed my life, I mean the X2 has really done a lot for me, I've lost weight, my brain
[44:21.560 --> 44:26.320]  works a whole lot better, my kids, they use the toothpaste, my son used to get these little
[44:26.320 --> 44:30.320]  sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat, he
[44:30.320 --> 44:31.320]  loves it.
[44:31.320 --> 44:33.800]  Well sir, let me break this down for you, I want high quality stuff in there, I want
[44:33.800 --> 44:37.880]  a good price, but I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's
[44:37.880 --> 44:42.040]  50% off, I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off, and so it's the same thing like the
[44:42.040 --> 44:46.240]  fish oil, or the turmeric, or the bone broth, thank you so much for the plugs, but listen,
[44:46.240 --> 44:50.320]  when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later, because
[44:50.320 --> 44:53.920]  if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing 50%
[44:53.920 --> 44:57.400]  off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot points, we lose money,
[44:57.400 --> 45:01.040]  but that's okay, thanks for the support.
[45:01.040 --> 45:08.800]  We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed the continent, harness science,
[45:08.800 --> 45:15.720]  took to the skies, and soared into the heavens, because we will never forget that we are
[45:15.720 --> 45:24.680]  Americans, and the future belongs to us.
[45:24.680 --> 45:29.680]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.
[45:29.680 --> 45:36.960]  We are one people chasing one dream, and one magnificent destiny.
[45:36.960 --> 45:45.360]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the
[45:45.360 --> 45:48.360]  same Almighty God.
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.840]  In FullWars.com, tomorrow's news today, full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus
[45:52.840 --> 45:54.840]  Christ, full power!
[45:54.840 --> 46:00.560]  Damn the torpedoes, go straight at them!
[46:00.560 --> 46:05.560]  George R. Wells said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary
[46:05.560 --> 46:10.240]  act, and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag, because we still
[46:10.240 --> 46:13.840]  loved our country, and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it, but
[46:13.840 --> 46:18.160]  now they're trying to take it out of schools, they're taking it down off of government
[46:18.160 --> 46:19.160]  buildings.
[46:19.160 --> 46:22.720]  Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running
[46:22.720 --> 46:24.520]  up Mexican flags.
[46:24.520 --> 46:28.840]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing, so now it is a revolutionary
[46:28.840 --> 46:34.440]  act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag, particularly
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.880]  the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly when it says on the back, right there ladies
[46:39.880 --> 46:43.480]  and gentlemen, America's back in FullWars.com.
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.680]  Whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face, all
[46:48.680 --> 46:52.600]  over not just the U.S., but worldwide, because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol
[46:52.600 --> 47:22.080]  of freedom against globalism.
[47:22.080 --> 47:38.960]  My eyes are blind, but I can see.
[47:38.960 --> 47:51.680]  The sun no longer sets people free, like Connor Betts, a Satanist, a hater of Christians,
[47:51.680 --> 47:58.480]  a lover of abortion, a lover of socialism, his hoodie, and a famous French Marxist on
[47:58.480 --> 48:04.800]  it, but he's a right-wing white supremacist killer.
[48:04.800 --> 48:06.840]  That's how they roll, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.000]  The other guy, classic leftist cutout.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.560]  This manifesto, we have no idea, just pops up, it's shared everywhere.
[48:14.560 --> 48:20.760]  Oh, they let you share it all over Facebook, Twitter, but because it was uploaded to H-Hand,
[48:20.760 --> 48:25.280]  they lose their Internet service provider.
[48:25.280 --> 48:35.160]  Oh, when the Christchurch guy uploaded that questionable video of that massacre, of that
[48:35.160 --> 48:40.240]  strange event, did Facebook lose its Internet service provider?
[48:40.240 --> 48:43.280]  Oh, no, no, no.
[48:43.280 --> 48:48.480]  It's anything that has a lot of traffic that rivals them, they then go around and demonize.
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.280]  You could look at Facebook and Twitter all day, calling for killing conservatives, video
[48:53.280 --> 49:02.320]  of them beating people up, oh, Facebook, Twitter, they leave it up, but when it's H-Hand, oh,
[49:02.320 --> 49:07.800]  you can't have your Internet service provider, and we've been dumped by dozens of Internet
[49:07.800 --> 49:12.520]  service providers over the years, have to go through the whole rigour-moror of changing
[49:12.520 --> 49:19.080]  and moving because your leftist complaining and all the rest of it, oh, build your own
[49:19.080 --> 49:23.880]  website, have your own thing, they go after your bank accounts, they go after everything.
[49:23.880 --> 49:26.240]  And yeah, H-Hand's a lot more racy than we are.
[49:26.240 --> 49:30.520]  I don't have some free open platform where you can run around there and say, you know,
[49:30.520 --> 49:34.800]  Jews are the devil or black people are the devil or white people are the devil.
[49:34.800 --> 49:40.360]  There's everything goes there, and they have a right to do that.
[49:40.360 --> 49:45.560]  But everything doesn't go here because, A, I don't agree with that, and this is my show,
[49:45.560 --> 49:50.960]  but also, B, they would shut us down like that.
[49:50.960 --> 49:54.920]  They already misrepresent everything we say and everything we do because we're promoting
[49:54.920 --> 49:57.680]  unity and Americana.
[49:57.680 --> 50:03.360]  And the first half of Trump's 10-minute speech is solid gold, and I totally agree with it.
[50:03.360 --> 50:07.480]  The one he gave a few hours ago, and then it goes downhill off the edge of a cliff from
[50:07.480 --> 50:08.480]  that point on.
[50:08.480 --> 50:15.520]  Yeah, I get it is expedient in the current time space to neutralize everybody saying
[50:15.520 --> 50:19.960]  he's a white supremacist when he isn't, to take that lie away from them and to say, yeah,
[50:19.960 --> 50:24.800]  we need to have red flag laws that accelerate due process.
[50:24.800 --> 50:30.040]  We already have systems where if someone says they think you're scaring, they have the Baker
[50:30.040 --> 50:35.000]  Act and a bunch of others, and you can have someone put in a mental hospital for 24 hours
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.800]  for an evaluation just on your word.
[50:39.800 --> 50:44.400]  This individual was on his site saying he wants to kill people.
[50:44.400 --> 50:45.400]  We have screenshots.
[50:45.400 --> 50:47.040]  I want to kill fascist.
[50:47.040 --> 50:51.240]  That means anyone right of Mao Zedong and V.I.
[50:51.240 --> 50:52.240]  Lenin.
[50:52.240 --> 50:53.920]  He said, I love Satan.
[50:53.920 --> 50:54.920]  Here's a little tip.
[50:54.920 --> 50:59.120]  When someone says I love Satan and can't wait to die and go to hell, that's what he
[50:59.120 --> 51:04.680]  said, and I'm going to kill people, you don't need some red flag act that gets rid of due
[51:04.680 --> 51:07.080]  process.
[51:07.080 --> 51:18.520]  Look at that guy, pale, have that distant stare like a little spoiled rotten baby.
[51:18.520 --> 51:21.120]  Probably jerks off 50 times a day.
[51:21.120 --> 51:29.320]  I mean, we know the exact M.O. of these dudes, women run from them, they're creeps because
[51:29.320 --> 51:35.080]  I guarantee your daddy wasn't home and nobody ever beat his ass.
[51:35.080 --> 51:40.640]  I mean, that guy needed to have his ass kicked royal.
[51:40.640 --> 51:47.400]  When he was, I guarantee he was a bully when he was, I love the NPR fake origin story they
[51:47.400 --> 51:53.400]  put out on me, totally made up all eyes that I was a bully, that I was beating up people
[51:53.400 --> 51:54.400]  smaller than me.
[51:54.400 --> 52:00.800]  No, I was bullied and I beat the living hell out of people once I hit puberty.
[52:00.800 --> 52:03.880]  That's what happened.
[52:03.880 --> 52:09.920]  That's why I never had any convictions when I was a juvenile, even though I did put people
[52:09.920 --> 52:14.480]  in comas and I did break people's jaws.
[52:14.480 --> 52:20.680]  When they put their hands on me, but I'm not a bully.
[52:20.680 --> 52:22.280]  I fight tyrants.
[52:22.280 --> 52:27.880]  I take on the big dogs when I'm 45, just like when I was 15.
[52:27.880 --> 52:31.840]  And I'll say this right now.
[52:31.840 --> 52:34.000]  I agree with the FBI.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.760]  Most of the FBI are good people.
[52:35.760 --> 52:41.000]  They've got all these different compartmentalized political groups, though, that put out the
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.160]  report a few days before this happens that, oh, the conspiracy theorists, they're violent.
[52:46.160 --> 52:49.520]  That Southern Poverty Law Center stuff that they had Democrat FBI put out.
[52:49.520 --> 52:51.800]  But what did the FBI also put out that week?
[52:51.800 --> 52:56.200]  In cells of the number one threat after Islamist, we're finding that all these mass shooters
[52:56.200 --> 52:57.200]  are into death.
[52:57.200 --> 53:01.880]  The devil can't get a girl and hate women.
[53:01.880 --> 53:07.240]  And they put out a report saying that in cells are the major threat.
[53:07.240 --> 53:08.240]  Remember that?
[53:08.240 --> 53:10.240]  Stories up on infowars.com.
[53:10.240 --> 53:13.320]  That's an article from June 24th.
[53:13.320 --> 53:20.880]  The article I'm talking about is from August 1st, Paul Joseph Watson DHS awards $200,000
[53:20.880 --> 53:26.680]  study male supremacist terror threat posed by in cells.
[53:26.680 --> 53:31.160]  It's a male supremacy thing by total nerd wimps.
[53:31.160 --> 53:33.600]  And again, I'm not saying banned video games.
[53:33.600 --> 53:36.640]  Our normal person plays a shoot them up video game or a hunting game.
[53:36.640 --> 53:40.120]  It's all about skill and camaraderie and fun.
[53:40.120 --> 53:44.120]  But if you're mentally ill and hateful and listening to devil worship music all day and
[53:44.120 --> 53:50.120]  are into Satanism and feel really bad about yourself and then start getting into darkness,
[53:50.120 --> 53:52.680]  well then death metal might not be for you.
[53:52.680 --> 54:00.160]  And if you go to these guys profile, death metal, Satanism, and they hate women, including
[54:00.160 --> 54:08.440]  his sister, who you reportedly killed up in Dayton, Ohio, talking about Connor Betts.
[54:08.440 --> 54:11.440]  You want to look into the eyes of evil, ladies and gentlemen, look into his eyes.
[54:11.440 --> 54:17.320]  So the FBI was right about that report, put out the day before all this crap started,
[54:17.320 --> 54:18.320]  and then look at this.
[54:18.320 --> 54:27.640]  The FBI report I agree with totally from the Hill 100% true FBI says brace for copycats.
[54:27.640 --> 54:35.640]  You know this Ohio thing was a copycat dressed the same or ear protection, everything.
[54:35.640 --> 54:39.600]  Because they're used to wearing the headphones when they play the shoot them up games.
[54:39.600 --> 54:41.200]  And he was into that too.
[54:41.200 --> 54:44.640]  You see when you're highly suggestible and already in a near trance state, probably on
[54:44.640 --> 54:50.040]  psychotropics, both of them, you're going to end up learning, it's always that way.
[54:50.040 --> 54:53.520]  Under the care of some weird psychologist, psychiatrist like his daddy, the El Paso
[54:53.520 --> 55:07.640]  shooter, you're going to see the copycat attacks.
[55:07.640 --> 55:13.880]  And that's what the one on Saturday night was Sunday morning over and over and over
[55:13.880 --> 55:16.000]  and over and over again.
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.480]  FBI warns of copycat attacks in wake of mass shootings.
[55:21.480 --> 55:25.400]  The FBI is warning a potential for copycat attacks by domestic extremists after two
[55:25.400 --> 55:28.600]  mass shootings rocked the country over the weekend, including one that appeared to be
[55:28.600 --> 55:31.600]  motivated by animus towards Hispanics and immigrants.
[55:31.600 --> 55:36.080]  In a statement released Sunday, the FBI said it's possible extremists could be inspired
[55:36.080 --> 55:37.480]  by the attacks.
[55:37.480 --> 55:41.840]  The FBI remains concerned that the U.S.-based domestic violent extremists could become inspired
[55:41.840 --> 55:45.280]  by those previous high profile attacks to engage in similar acts of violence.
[55:45.280 --> 55:46.280]  Of course.
[55:46.280 --> 55:49.120]  And again, I'll go back to this for the 500th time.
[55:49.120 --> 55:53.680]  If you read basic criminology, they learned back in the 30s that if somebody jumped off
[55:53.680 --> 55:59.720]  the Empire State Building, suddenly three more people try it that same day or the next
[55:59.720 --> 56:02.200]  day.
[56:02.200 --> 56:05.720]  And so maybe somebody didn't jump for six months, but when somebody jumped, they would
[56:05.720 --> 56:12.960]  put police up there when it was open to stop it because you learn how copycats work.
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.880]  Well, the media knows when they cover this like it's super common and they hype it up
[56:17.880 --> 56:24.480]  constantly that certain types of people that are already suicidal, but the sick were in
[56:24.480 --> 56:28.760]  love with themselves and into Satanism and hate people are going to go do this to go
[56:28.760 --> 56:31.680]  down with infamy.
[56:31.680 --> 56:37.120]  Just like Satan wants to destroy God's creation, the earth and God's creation humans because
[56:37.120 --> 56:44.400]  we're made by God, the devil wants to kill, steal and destroy and take everyone with him.
[56:44.400 --> 56:48.920]  That's how these spoiled rotten people that didn't get invited to the party behave and
[56:48.920 --> 56:49.920]  act.
[56:49.920 --> 56:53.480]  That's how creepozoids are.
[56:53.480 --> 56:58.480]  And so they know who to profile, they know who to go after.
[56:58.480 --> 57:03.080]  What these guys were putting out chatter and talking about all this stuff and what they
[57:03.080 --> 57:10.680]  were going to do and they were all left alone because the system wanted this to happen.
[57:10.680 --> 57:12.920]  It pushed the atmosphere.
[57:12.920 --> 57:20.320]  It created the environment for this to happen and now they're hyping it 24 seven with their
[57:20.320 --> 57:21.760]  fingers crossed.
[57:21.760 --> 57:27.480]  So every time there's another attack, the media can say, Oh, you see, it was another attack.
[57:27.480 --> 57:29.120]  We didn't take all the guns.
[57:29.120 --> 57:32.520]  Never to mention a millions of Christians killed the last decade by Muslims.
[57:32.520 --> 57:36.040]  Never to mention hundreds of thousands dead in Mexico or millions dead in Latin America
[57:36.040 --> 57:37.760]  from crime where the people are disarmed.
[57:37.760 --> 57:42.040]  None of the real statistics just all look at this, look at this, you're all dead.
[57:42.040 --> 57:45.200]  They're coming to get you unless you turn in your guns.
[57:45.200 --> 57:48.280]  Can you imagine what it would be like when only the criminals in the government has the
[57:48.280 --> 57:49.800]  guns?

[59:53.400 --> 01:00:00.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:08.320]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:15.680]  We got Mike Adams coming up at 15 after and I can tell you right now he thinks it's just
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.280]  funny is $3 bill mass shootings and he's got an absolute right to say that and to believe
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.280]  that.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:28.080]  But I'll tell you this, if you look at all the admitted staged events, it'll make your
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.080]  head spin.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:36.920]  In fact, when he joins us, let's look at Operation Gladio partially declassified by the US declassified
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.720]  fully by the Italians and we ought to try to get Leo Zagami on.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.360]  He was actually part of Operation Gladio when he was in the Italian Air Force and believe
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.120]  me, I've been to Rome with Zagami, he's not making it up.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.560]  That guy can get in the Vatican castles, nobody can get into, I mean, he's definitely in the
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:59.080]  secret societies and then people say, why do you trust Zagami?
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:06.120]  No, Zagami was from the inside and exposed the entire thing.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:11.400]  So yeah, print me some stuff on Operation Gladio, hundreds of bombings and mass shootings in
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:22.440]  Italy alone by the US government in NATO to stop the left from getting into power.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.320]  See how it works?
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:32.840]  So yeah, yeah, it's even in army manuals in special operations, captain or above, how
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:39.920]  to stage false flags, ever seen Graham Greene's book turn into the quiet American, that's
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.680]  actually a composite of true stories.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.400]  He puts it out as fiction though, so he doesn't get sued about how the CIA was staging terror
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:53.800]  attacks in southern Vietnam as the US started taking over in 54, 55.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:02:01.000]  We were really there in Indochina before 1960 and staging the terror attacks to get the
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.680]  South on our side against the North.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.320]  And I'm not defending the communists, I'm not defending Ho Chi Minh, but he wanted to
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:16.200]  work with us from the beginning, but certain folks did not want that to happen.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:22.400]  They wanted to have the long term extended war.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:28.440]  And so that's how this stuff really works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:33.960]  So we have a right and a duty to look at every event as if it could be staged.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:40.200]  Like the babies in the incubators, again, 1990, Desert Shield, the buildup before Desert
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.240]  Storm, the offensive.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.520]  And they came and testified that they saw babies by the hundreds pulled out their brains
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520]  bashed out.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.680]  The girl had never been to Kuwait, none of it happened.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:55.960]  She was the daughter of a PR firm controlled by the Saudis.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.040]  She was four years older than they said, she was 18, she wasn't 14.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.120]  It was a lie.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.720]  You know, they have Hollywood movies like Wag the Dog, Bill Clinton liked that movie
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:17.560]  so much with Dustin Hoffman and Willie Nelson that he staged it a year after it came out
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:22.320]  exactly that in real time in the same area.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.560]  So do they stage events?
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.280]  You better bet your bottom greenbacks they do.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:35.120]  But they don't need to with 340 million people, most of them sitting in front of video games
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:42.120]  and TV all day taking serotonin reuptake inhibitors because they don't make you see
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:49.760]  pretty colors like a hit of acid does or peyote or mescaline.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:58.240]  But they put you into that state of high suggestibility.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:05.720]  And so one day you just get suited up because that girl was mean to him.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.840]  You go kill her and a bunch of other people.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.760]  Let's see the feminist groups, they just want to control women.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.760]  They're not warning women about incels.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.520]  They're just saying we need to get the guns.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.080]  No, it's still very rare.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:26.040]  But there are little spoiled rotten demonic brats who always love Satan, who are killed
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:32.600]  twice, and because they're scared of women and exponentially feel powerless, they go
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.240]  I could be powerful if I was dark and evil and they have little devils sit on their shoulders.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:42.640]  Well then put the helmet on, put on the body armor, go show them you're a man.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.120]  Show them, show them your power.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.160]  You know what the power with these son would be going to a soup kitchen helping homeless
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.560]  people or going to join the Peace Corps, take care of your grandma, change your grandma's
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.480]  diapers to see you're not a man, you don't do that, you go kill people.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:05.000]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.040]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.800]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:20.720]  The world is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.920]  to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:30.080]  The system is vulnerable, electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.440]  be empty in three days.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:37.920]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.520]  next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.120]  dying system.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.680]  Buy storable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:06:14.680]  Get mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from infowarstore.com.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:32.840]  Come deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:40.680]  We are back, we're into hour number two, we've seen tragic attacks that have killed 30 people
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.360]  over the weekend and that's terrible.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.000]  We also have had thousands of babies killed since then in abortuaries and hundreds have
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.720]  been kept alive for their organs to be harvested after they're born.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:55.920]  But the media is not going to humanize them like the poor folks killed in Dayton, Ohio
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:03.440]  by an avowed satanist and Obama supporter and Hillary supporter or the other incel reportedly
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.640]  attacked in El Paso.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.440]  No, they're only going to hype up this because they want to demonize Trump and the fact that
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.240]  we have a border that even exists that people are fighting to get across because we have
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.360]  that border and are not a third world country.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:21.960]  Please remember that it's not just the Alex Jones show that's here fighting in the face
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.800]  of all the censorship and attacks.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:31.280]  It's also the David Knight show, 8am to 11am every weekday morning doing a fabulous job
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.920]  and David's taking the week off but I got to tell you we had our own Greg Reese sitting
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:43.680]  in, sounds great, looks great, he's an awesome dude, great camera guy, great editor and he
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:48.040]  really pulled it off this morning and then we've got Owen Schreuer at 3pm every day
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:54.200]  with the war room that obviously you don't want to miss.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:08:00.360]  Okay, we've got Mike Adams joining us in the next segment to get into all the bizarre
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.200]  anomalies and more.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.160]  But I know what he's going to talk about because I know he's a smart guy.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:12.240]  It's the season we're in and the FBI is saying look for copycats and way more of these and
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.720]  I agree that's what's going to happen because the media hypes this and these mentally ill
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.400]  people that want to go down in a blaze of infamy, they're going to go out and stage
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.880]  more events and the way the media is giving this full wall-to-wall coverage they know
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:31.000]  out of 240 million people, it's going to happen and it's just a sickening tragedy to watch
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  all this unfold.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.040]  There will be another 24-year-old that can't get a girlfriend who's a devil worshiper
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.180]  and if you joined us now, last hour I went over the M.O. on all these people and I've
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:46.000]  got a bunch of the past shooters as well, it is the same person, a devil worshiper
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  who can't get women, who's looking for power and who plays shoot-em-up video games all
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  day.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.960]  Normal person plays shoot-em-up video games, it's not a bad thing but these guys, these
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.720]  incels are all the same and we've been saying this for five, six years, Paul Watson's really
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.320]  been harping on it, now the FBI completely agrees with that and says that's who you should
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.120]  be worried about.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:19.800]  But the big issue here is that media matters is the mouth of George Soros and Alexander
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.480]  Soros and undoubtedly they picked up this report I put out because they want to show
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.280]  Alexander Soros this and say, see sir, he's attacking you, give us another 50 million
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.560]  this year and Alexander Soros is the main funder through democracy and action that he's
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:39.680]  the main funder of, of the Antifa movement that says they're coming September 1st through
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:45.960]  November to lay siege and kill Border Patrol and ICE.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:50.520]  So Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and in Texas, the Lieutenant Governor has more power
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:56.160]  than the Governor, came out and said you're not welcome in Texas, don't come here in
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.680]  the middle of this crisis.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.960]  So in reaction to the old Paso Mass shooting, Alex Jones, Lieutenant Governor, Dan Patrick
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:08.480]  sound a lot alike, well because obviously if Antifa's coming here and wanting to have
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:14.760]  a civil war, that's not a good mix, obviously don't do it, that's not hard to say and they're
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.840]  saying they're going to be violent, they put out graphics of burning American flags and
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.120]  of dead ICE agents and pools of blood, my God.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.920]  Trump says if someone says they're going to kill somebody, go after one of the red flags,
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.360]  the law already says that.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.840]  I mean I don't make a big deal about this, but when people death threat this office and
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.720]  death threat our people, we report it to the FBI and local police and others and three
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.760]  or four times a year people get arrested and indicted that threaten us and threaten any
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:48.720]  of our crew and sometimes they show up here and we go press charges, you go to jail.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:54.680]  Well how is Antifa, who's already fire bombed and shot up things, attacks people with concrete
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:59.200]  and metal bars, how are they allowed to be organizing this?
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.560]  How this guy in Dayton, Ohio, this monster, say I love Satan, I'm going to kill fascists,
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:07.400]  I'm about to die and go to hell, I'm about to die and go to hell, I'm going to kill
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:13.320]  people and I love Satan, yeah that's somebody you need to go put in a mental institution
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:20.080]  for a few weeks to see what the hell is going on, but yeah that's a close up of the graphic,
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:25.720]  we can put the whole graphic up, articles are on infowars.com by some of our reporters
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:33.240]  that put that out, but right now let's go ahead and go to Dan Patrick on Fox News that
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.840]  media matters is reporting on like they caught him doing something, here it is.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:43.520]  You know I was looking at a story recently, I just saw in the last couple of days where
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.800]  Antifa is posting, you know they want to come to El Paso and do a 10 day siege, clear message
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:54.120]  to Antifa, stay out of El Paso, stay out of Texas basically, but we don't need them
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.720]  coming in on September 1st, we didn't need them to begin with before this happened, but
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:04.640]  I would say to Antifa, scratch Texas off your map and don't come in, it is not the time
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.520]  and place for them to come at any time, but particularly in the aftermath of what's just
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.680]  happening in El Paso, so Antifa message for Lieutenant Governor, stay out of Texas.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.320]  They're meeting all over the country and they're going to converge on El Paso to attack ICE,
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:24.280]  to quote lay siege, and then media matters is this huge article demonizing it and how
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.200]  fascist it is, because that's their little army, a lot of the folks at media matters
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.600]  you know dress up on the weekend as Antifa, go out and do the type of stuff, so here's
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:39.840]  a clip from my report Saturday I shot, and they act like this is somehow bad, I'm very
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.600]  proud of what I said here, here it is.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:50.640]  NBC reports Patrick Crucius, the leftist savior who just shows up right at the moment when
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.760]  the left is being exposed, when our whole agenda is falling apart, and when Trump is
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:01.880]  defending our borders, supposing as evil racists, right as Antifa announces nationwide funded
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:10.440]  by Alexander Soros, that they are going to be marching and across the US in the meeting
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:19.720]  September 1st in like 26 days, in El Paso to cross the border patrol and to lay siege
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:24.920]  to them, these are quotes, they put out graphics showing American flags burning, they put out
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:30.880]  graphics showing dead ICE officers, and I said what are they planning to stage, I said this
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:39.280]  is on Friday's show, what are they planning to stage and on Thursday's show, what are
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:46.200]  they planning to stage, I had an Antifa showing up right on time at El Paso, so that looks
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:52.200]  legitimate when they attack physically the ICE agents and call them Nazis and say kids
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.400]  are turning out toilets and the people are being killed, and they're actually coming
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.560]  here from the countries that are collapsing, and I saw a new FBI report that came out saying
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:08.640]  that conspiracy theorists are the big terror threat in America, and that it's Q and O that's
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:14.960]  the threat, when you've had a few obvious schizophrenics go and commit crimes believing
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:19.440]  that Trump ordered them to do it, when it's obvious that the whole Q movement is a bunch
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:25.160]  of leftist intelligence ops jerking people's chains, doesn't mean if you like the Q movement
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.080]  you're evil in yourself, but it's a weird shadowy thing that you can't ever tell who's
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.080]  the commander, but it's perfect to get people to join it under one auspice and then later
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:40.800]  commit crimes under its manor, so I've been saying this is all coming, this person can
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:45.600]  be completely just wound up by all the media and all the civil war talk, and the Democrats
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.640]  saying go out and kill Republicans, and the Democrats saying kill more than just police
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:55.640]  and kill Trump, and it's time to fight dirty, I mean these are all the quotes, and it's
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:02.160]  time for a physical revolution, Joe Biden, you see all these statements, so just making
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:10.760]  statements like that can trigger unhinged other people to go out and carry out violence,
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:16.200]  or as has happened in other parts of history, this could be totally staged, Operation Northwoods
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:22.280]  declassified in 2001, broke down how the U.S. government planned to stage mass shootings
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:29.320]  and bombings across the U.S. to blame on Cubans, and then trigger a war with the Soviet Union,
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:34.400]  Kennedy said no to the plan, but it was green-lipped at his level, every single news.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:45.560]  So they put out a report showing all the evidence of what I just said, why do they do that?
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:51.560]  I believe because they actually want to use that to give orders to their in-sales who
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:58.080]  are actually Antifa to go out and pose as conservatives and launch attacks.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.880]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you

[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:05.200]  Last night, I'm on infowars.com and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.960]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned. A Betsy Ross but also another just classic
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:16.040]  American flag all 50 stars with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it. And on the back,
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.640]  America's back infowars.com. But what's better than just an American flag about a don't
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.200]  try it on me under the flag? Say don't try on the American flag. It's a perfect combo.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.200]  So great minds think alike. I mean whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:31.320]  with the exact same similar design. It is the don't try it on me American flag t-shirt
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:36.560]  inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt. But it's a battle
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.640]  tattered flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter. And again on the back, it says
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:47.560]  America's back infowars.com. 4,000 of these babies. And that's it. So we've got the Betsy
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:53.280]  Ross version and the American flag version at infowars.com. Be imprinted in the USA right
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:59.280]  now infowars.com. We'll be right back. The most banned broadcast in the world. It's not
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:03.240]  only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square. The other thing
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:08.320]  that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.480]  by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed by some billionaire. That's
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.560]  not being funded by a secret foreign government. It is completely independent of all that it
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:22.280]  is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:26.160]  and freedom of speech. That in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.480]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.040]  because this was the kind of press they wanted. And then ultimately we now live in an era
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.920]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.000]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.760]  have or express or hear. And the info wars audience has broken through that. They are
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:51.440]  the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.440]  That's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation, lawfare and
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:01.080]  libel targeting you.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:10.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:21.360]  We've known ladies and gentlemen that big events were coming. We know criminal
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:29.600]  foundations and organizations have staged events in the past. And so it's right to
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:35.000]  look at any of these events and say they can be staged. But even if they're not staged,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.960]  the media is organically promoting it and hyping it up to create the copycats. And the
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.440]  FBI has come out and said that we're going to go to Mike Adams at naturalnews.com. Holy
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:48.560]  smart researcher here in a moment. Leo Zagami is going to be popping in next hour as well
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:53.000]  as others. I tend to open the phones up to get your take like we did yesterday on the
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.640]  Sunday show. And then no one's lawyers going to come up is going to be covering this in
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:03.840]  death because I agree more attacks are coming. And they're going to come for our guns. It
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.400]  is Trump really a Trojan horse. I don't think so. But coming out and saying we need red
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:15.560]  flag laws. One of these individuals said I'm a Satanist. I want to kill Trump supporters
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:19.720]  and I'm going to go to hell soon. I mean that's pretty right there. You don't need a red flag
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:24.600]  law to get around due process. Trump said red flag laws with expedited accelerated due
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.440]  process. There's no such thing. Look at Mexico. Again, a higher crime rate than us. You never
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.840]  hear about all the murders there, though, because the media doesn't personalize it.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:40.400]  This is so manipulative. And yes, it's senseless and evil. And you ask why because evil's real.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.840]  And civilization is unraveling. People are becoming corrupt. Illegitimacy is massive.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:50.840]  You talk about the internet corrupting people turn on Netflix. I had a crew member go to
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.400]  Sundance this year. I was invited. I didn't go and they were at Sundance and it was all
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.880]  about we want to corrupt people. The funding is all just destroy society. Talk to Mike Adams
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:07.160]  NaturalNews.com in a moment. We are extending the sale. The money bomb sale that is the
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:12.880]  biggest we've done since Christmas because folks like the specials. It helps fund our
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:19.760]  operation. And I was talking to our general manager, Tim Frosier this weekend. He said,
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:27.840]  you know, you know that Tuesday is the anniversary of your massive deplatforming that was the
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:33.000]  precedent for everybody else last August 6. And I said, you know, I forgot about that.

[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.480]  important is that when they were demonizing people filtering their water last few years
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.560]  against us, David Hogg and others, when they had all the debates about how bad our water
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:37.600]  is at the Democrat debate, suddenly sales of water filters exploded. Yeah. I sell what

[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.480]  forgot to plug last hour. That's how we fund ourselves. I want to thank all the viewers
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.400]  and let's just for your support without you. We wouldn't be here. Mike, where do you want
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:11.400]  to start? We can get into the shooting, the anomalies, but just what about we knew this
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.760]  was coming right on time, the election, the way the media is working at the way they're
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:20.480]  changing is social media and live time. I mean, this stinks worse than a shipload of
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:26.600]  rotting fish. Well, let's start with the New York Times. Here's an article from 2012 by
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:34.280]  David K. Shippler, a terrorist plots hatched by the FBI. This is New York Times. Okay,
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.360]  we this was not us saying this. And if you look at this article, the New York Times said,
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.960]  Hey, there's a, there's a suicide bomber and set intercepted on his way to the Capitol
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:49.440]  to bomb synagogues to shoot Stinger missiles at military aircraft and to fly explosive
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.820]  laden model planes into the Pentagon. And this is the New York Times again saying this,
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:59.360]  but all of these dramas were facilitated by the FBI, whose undercover agents and informers
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:06.920]  posed as terrorists and offered rudimentary training, by the way. And then they, they
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:11.560]  recruited people to play the role and jump into the van or, or punch the button or do
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:17.560]  whatever was the final act. So the FBI, according to the New York Times, and again, this is
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:23.000]  not me or you saying this, Alex. This is the New York Times. The FBI, and this is from
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.560]  2012, the FBI has more experience creating terrorist plots in America than any other
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:34.960]  organization that you could even think of. And that's not just the New York Times. Here's
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:43.440]  the Kansas city star, an article by Ian Cummings, FBI undercover steams, foil terrorist plots,
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:50.760]  but often plots of the agency's own making. And in this article, it talks about the terrorism
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:56.880]  investigations. I'm sorry. Here we go. The jihadist attacks on a train station in Kansas
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:04.000]  city to bomb a September 11 memorial to blow up a thousand pound bomb at Fort Riley. The
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.320]  detonator weapon of mass destruction at the Wichita airport. The failed plans all show
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:15.080]  imagination, but how much of it was real, asks the Kansas city star. It turns out often
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:20.000]  not much. They're all plotted by the FBI. Now, the reason I mentioned this, Alex, is
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:27.080]  because Friday in front page mag, new evidence unveils disturbing facts about Hillary's
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:32.720]  email scandal. This story from front page mag sites J. Seculo's American Center for
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:40.900]  Law and Justice that found documents where the FBI agreed to destroy the computers that
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:47.040]  had the backup emails from Hillary Clinton's email servers. These emails that show a pattern
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:53.800]  of criminal activities on the part of Hillary Clinton. And we now know the FBI took part
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:00.200]  in the destruction of evidence, the obstruction of justice that at least one faction of the
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:06.600]  FBI under James Comey and Barack Obama helped Hillary Clinton carry out acts of treason.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.920]  You can see the massive evidence coming out of the pedophile rings out of the Clintons
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:18.000]  and of all their people getting in major trouble and AOC reportedly stealing millions and
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.560]  about to get indicted for it. And right on time, boom, this, this, this, these Manchurian
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:31.360]  candidates activate. That's exactly right. We see the media desperately working to change
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:36.280]  the narrative. Now, I'm sure you would agree that the violence was real. People were really
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.360]  shot and killed. None of us are saying that that didn't happen. What we're saying, what
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:45.600]  we're asking the question is what, why was this violence taking place? Or why was this
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:53.080]  person a dispatched to this Walmart in El Paso to carry out this shooting? And if he was
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:58.360]  on a suicide mission, why was he wearing hearing protection? Why was he wearing I pro and ear
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:03.640]  pro as we say in the shooting community? You only do that if you expect to survive, which
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.000]  is why I don't believe that his so-called manifesto was real at all. I think the manifesto
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.560]  Let's explain how this works. You think you're going to a drill or you think you're taking
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.560]  part of something is you're in the Q movement and Trump's got you as a secret agent. And
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:22.520]  you get set up in the process. But then you get given electroshock therapy a few hours
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:28.640]  later. You never remember what happened. The FBI has a long history of recruiting people
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:34.000]  to play a role in stage terror events. And that's the New York Times, Alex. That's not
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.280]  info wars saying that that's the New York Times or and the Kansas City Star. The FBI
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:42.720]  is expert. They are experts. These are compartmentalized groups in the FBI that are the Clinton
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:47.920]  operatives that are set to go to prison forever. If they don't do that, we're going to break
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:58.040]  down how they set people up on the other side, the Arlington road system. Stay with us, fellow

[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:10.560]  if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.440]  to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:18.360]  to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:22.280]  about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:26.100]  truth. And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.680]  love in my heart. I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank

[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.080]  I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.720]  The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight. We're being used by God. You're

[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:58.200]  done from the bottom of my heart. InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:03.680]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com,
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:08.120]  but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com and there's one product that's offered at
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:13.560]  InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus. Now
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:17.600]  I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:22.960]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA. So I started to look into the science and
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:29.000]  what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.680]  your telomeres. So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive. Why? Because
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:39.680]  it is an elite supplement. And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:45.160]  supplements for telomere support and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:50.360]  still there. It is the elite supplement. I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:56.360]  because I know it's expensive, so you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:16.040]  InfoWarsStore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Make no mistake, we're writers
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:25.280]  of the store, my friends. You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report. If you
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:32.000]  are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. So yes, the FBI's had a long history
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.200]  of problems. Any big domestic security force always has corruption problems. Whether it
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:42.520]  was the Victorian Guard guarding the Caesars in ancient Rome or whether it's been the
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:47.200]  secret police of Pinochet or whether the secret police of Mao Zedong, power corrupts
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:52.440]  absolute power corrupts absolutely. And so what Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is expertly
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:58.720]  laying out is that there is a history of staging terror attacks and provocaturing them. And
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.560]  a lot of times people think they're part of a drill. They come to the drill and then they
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:11.160]  get set up. That's how that works. Meanwhile, Ray welcomes Peter Strock back to the FBI.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.920]  Almost one year after he was fired from his top position. He's back there in meeting after
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:20.560]  meeting. It's all being reported. So they're getting their ducks in a row. They know they've
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.200]  committed all these crimes. They know Hillary's email servers have been found. All this incriminating
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:31.520]  stuff is going to come out now. Trump's got all the NSA stuff on him. He's got him. He's
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:35.840]  got him in the crosshairs and he's been ordering them to be criminally prosecuted. He says I'm
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:40.920]  not a wimp. We're not backing off. Boom. Mass shooting start. What does Saudi Arabia do?
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:46.640]  They're in that civil war that we won. They did Vegas show folks need to know that the
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.600]  left's tools to start a race war. That's the race in the hole. All the movies, all the
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.320]  Netflix, all the TV shows are race war, race war, race war. And so I think Trump's right
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:58.560]  to come out and say, Hey, white supremacism is terrible. Even though we know this guy's
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:03.960]  the leftist and the other guys have an admitted Antifa member that loves Satan. I get why
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.640]  Trump is doing this politically. It's still very dangerous with his base to talk about
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:13.360]  getting rid of due process with red flag laws. But again, Arlington Road came out, I don't
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:19.800]  know, 15 years ago, Jeff Bridges. He's a libertarian professor. He's a critic of the government
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:25.000]  having too much power. And there's this weird shadowy right wing group. The movie pretty
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.920]  much it's shadow government CIA. They set him up. He believes he's stopping the truck
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:35.840]  bomb. But all they really do is trick him to get in there when it goes off so they can
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:40.080]  then put it on the news to make it look like he's the terrorist. And look, it's a respected
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.520]  professor that did this. Let's go to the audio. Here it is. Sir, step out of the vehicle.
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:51.680]  The bomb in the van. Michael, it's got a goddamn bomb. Michael, wait, wait, wait. That's the
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:58.120]  man. That's the man was authorized. That's the man. Branson's talking. It's the noon
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:15.080]  delivery. Branson, it's got a goddamn bomb. Hold your fire.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:43.800]  In the van. You got any new another ability, Frank? In the van.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:49.860]  It's a man. Frank? Where? packing the bag? Don't get him out of the building. Get him out of
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:51.580]  the building. семon.
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:54.640]  We're gonna get everybody out of here.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.480]  We're from Kong.
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.520]  It's in there.
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.520]  Rick!
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.520]  Wait.
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:04.520]  He's...
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.520]  That's not the man.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.520]  All right.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.520]  All right.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.520]  Grant?
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:09.520]  Let him go.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:10.520]  Let the boys.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:11.560]  I said let him go.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.560]  What the...
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.560]  Let him go.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.560]  What the...
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.560]  Stay out.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.560]  The van is clean.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.560]  We've got the man here.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.560]  Grant!
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.560]  We're out!
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.560]  Michael, go ahead, buddy.
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.560]  Go ahead.
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.560]  Let's go on!
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.560]  It's in your car, buddy.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.560]  You just got set up.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.560]  Michael, it's all clear.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:41.560]  The guys authorized to be here.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.560]  We're all authorized to be here.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:46.560]  Everyone except you.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.560]  And then he figures it out.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.560]  All right.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.560]  It's your car.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.560]  Michael?
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.560]  It's a really good movie.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.560]  You know how these people work, folks? This is it.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.560]  You know who writes most of these scripts?
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.560]  See that?
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.560]  Michael? Michael!
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.560]  Boom!
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.560]  Michael!
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.560]  Michael!
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.560]  Figured out whose car it's in.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.560]  Stand by.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.560]  You're not good for any of it.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.560]  TV, you can all see it.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.560]  Into Arlington Road.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.560]  Right as he perfectly opens the car.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.560]  So he detonated it.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.560]  At least he's there.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.560]  Everybody thinks he did.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.560]  He opens it.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:13.560]  They're telling you how they do it, folks.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.560]  Everyone except you.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.560]  And there's the bomb.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:27.560]  I thought you were in QAnon, but you weren't.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:32.560]  Bye-bye.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.560]  And then it's on the news that he's the right-wing terrorist.
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.560]  And now the police take and take over.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:49.560]  So Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, that's where you were going with this.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.560]  We can pull up Cyclopedia Britannica about Operation Gladio.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:55.560]  Hundreds of bombings and shootings conducted in Italy
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:58.560]  blamed on the political enemies of NATO.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.560]  That's the reality, Mike.
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:03.560]  What you just showed there was a very important depiction of
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:06.560]  even the PSYOP that's happening inside the FBI.
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.560]  And for the record, I think most men and women who join the FBI
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.560]  have positive intentions.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:14.560]  They are pro-law and order people.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.560]  They want to do what's right for their country.
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:18.560]  That's how they go into it.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.560]  But there's a black hat element, of course, the James Comey, Barack Obama,
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.560]  Deep State element inside the FBI that's actually running a PSYOP
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:28.560]  on the other factions of the FBI itself.
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:32.560]  So an FBI agent that's going out and recruiting somebody
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.560]  to engage in an act of terrorism, that agent himself or herself
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:41.560]  may not even be aware of the bigger plan of how the fake explosives
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.560]  are going to be swapped out with real explosives, for example.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:47.560]  Or the fake debt cord becomes real debt cord.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:51.560]  Or the gunman that you're recruiting is actually augmented by
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:55.560]  three or four other gunmen who actually do the targeted shooting
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:56.560]  in a wall.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.560]  And by the way, that's what credible witnesses said at the Walmart
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:02.560]  and Mall area was, well, no, I saw them.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.560]  They were Anglo men in full black head-to-toe with masks on,
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:06.560]  but I saw their blue eyes.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.560]  I mean, that's what people saw.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.560]  Well, and remember, look, I've been a longtime supporter of law enforcement,
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:16.560]  and I've trained with many police officers, sheriffs, deputies,
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.560]  and even former FBI agents that I know quite well.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:23.560]  And we're all trained in self-defense, you know,
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.560]  tactical response kinds of situations.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.560]  If you are moving with a long gun, an AR or an AK,
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.560]  you're moving and trying to shoot targets that are running,
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.560]  it is extremely difficult.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.560]  That takes an expert marksman to pull that off.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.560]  That's not something that a casual 21-year-old with no experience
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.560]  can accomplish.
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:46.560]  That takes years of training to do it properly.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.560]  I don't know if your listeners have ever, you know,
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:50.560]  you go to a shooting range, you're not allowed to move.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.560]  You're not allowed to run and shoot.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.560]  You have to just shoot at still targets.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:01.560]  Real training and first responders are trained to shoot moving targets,
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.560]  running targets, especially lateral movement,
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.560]  is very, very difficult to nail.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:08.560]  And that's why I believe this 21-year-old person who's depicted
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:11.560]  in the surveillance screenshot, and by the way,
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:15.560]  we've seen no video footage of him actually carrying out any of the shooting.
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.560]  No video footage has been released whatsoever.
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.560]  He does not have spare magazines in the still shot.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.560]  Exactly, so Mike, stay there.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.560]  And I'm going to say this.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.560]  I've watched the video and photos put up by police.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.560]  He looks very calm.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:30.560]  It looks very rehearsed.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:36.560]  Again, but it's also the climate, the time we're in, antipaccoming,
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.560]  the media hyping this, the fact that all the corruption is coming out.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:42.560]  This whole situation, I mean, let me tell you,
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.560]  if you just shot 20-something people,
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:46.560]  I don't care what police department it is,
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:48.560]  you're going to get your ass kicked some.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.560]  This guy does not have a blemish on him.
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.560]  And I guarantee you this guy would have been jumped on.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.560]  He'd have a black guy with a bloody nose.
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:54.560]  He was lucky.
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.560]  But no, nothing.
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.560]  Something's going on.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.560]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit,
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.560]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:05.560]  And so, it used to, it wasn't that important to wear the American flag,
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.560]  because we still loved our country.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:10.560]  And there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.560]  But now, they're trying to take it out of schools.
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.560]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.560]  Weird white leftist that won a virtue signal
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.560]  are pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.560]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing.
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:27.560]  So now, it is a revolutionary act in the time of incredible deceit and oppression
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:30.560]  and bullying to wear the American flag,
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:33.560]  particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag.
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:35.560]  And particularly, when it says on the back,
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.560]  right there, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.560]  America's back, infowars.com.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:42.560]  So whatever you do, take action today
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.560]  and exercise your free speech in these bullies' face,
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.560]  all over, not just the U.S., but worldwide,
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:44:06.560]  because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:21.560]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.560]  And they will become the big tech oligarchs,
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.560]  the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century,
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:27.560]  who ran American politics and ran American economy,
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.560]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:36.560]  The infowars' audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.560]  to make real the actions of independent free speech,
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:41.560]  to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:45.560]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:48.560]  to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.560]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.560]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.560]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:57.560]  Even it is what you just saw.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:02.560]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.560]  They are technocrats.
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:05.560]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.560]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:12.560]  gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.560]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.560]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:22.560]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.560]  is our bodies.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.560]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from the ForwardsLive.com,
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:29.560]  I couldn't do it.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:32.560]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:34.560]  that was incredibly high quality medical bottleman
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:38.560]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:42.560]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:44.560]  over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:45.560]  It is amazing.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:48.560]  Experience pure medical bottleman B12 for yourself
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.560]  and fund the Second American Revolution
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.560]  against the tyrants at InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLive.com,
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:58.560]  or AAA-253-3139.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.560]  Serving with Infowars is a great honor.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.560]  But I still need my morning coffee.
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:08.560]  And luckily, our break room at the Infowars headquarters
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.560]  is stocked full of high quality InfowarsStore Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:16.560]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:21.560]  the Chiapas Farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:25.560]  at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:30.560]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:34.560]  There has never been a more important time to support Infowars.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:39.560]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom,
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:41.560]  then you can help.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:44.560]  Order now at the InfowarsStore.

[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:53.560]  of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:47:00.560]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:44.560]  Now by the way, I haven't played all these videos.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.560]  I'm sitting here mentioning these.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.560]  Mike Adams is raising them.
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:51.560]  We have very credible service member
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.560]  that saved a bunch of kids saying all the kids said
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.560]  they saw three shooters all in black.
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:58.560]  Very credible Hispanic American man.
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.560]  Very credible in the video.
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:03.560]  Saying I looked at him, he was in Anglo, saw his eyes.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560]  He had a black mask on.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.560]  Okay, well this other guy didn't have blue eyes.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:10.560]  And then there's a Hispanic lady, very credible.
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.560]  She's very clear.
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.560]  She's saying three shooters.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:14.560]  We've got all those clips.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:17.560]  And I don't even want to come up here and say
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.560]  this was staged or fake.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:22.560]  But man, this guy's dad works as a psychiatrist
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.560]  but only with a two-year degree, running a facility.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.560]  And then he's part of a weird cult.
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.560]  It's just always the same MO.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.560]  The first thing I said Saturday was see of his family
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.560]  or psychologist or psychiatrist.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:38.560]  Holmes, James Holmes in the Aurora shooting.
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:41.560]  His dad headed up DARPA brain computer interface.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.560]  He was in the program.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:47.560]  He was getting paid $87,000 a year by the government.
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:50.560]  Remember they said, oh, local police can't go in his apartment.
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:51.560]  It's got bombs.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:52.560]  There weren't bombs.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.560]  There was a bunch of MKUltra stuff.
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:56.560]  Theodore Kaczynski was MKUltra.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.560]  Type in Unabomber MKUltra, LA Times Associated Press.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:02.560]  That was CIA.
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:03.560]  You understand now, folks?
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.560]  I mean, of course we've got to ask this.
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:07.560]  Here's a few minutes from the intro video
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:10.560]  that Greg Reese and I put out, showing clips
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.560]  from when I predicted all this last Thursday,
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.560]  titled Operation Northwoods Part Two.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:19.560]  Here's just the intro because it's got one of the witnesses.
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.560]  I have a prediction.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.560]  I'm not sure if it's Sunday, but I just didn't want to sound
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:27.560]  like I was stirring up trouble.
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.560]  I've always got to go in my gut.
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:32.560]  Man.
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:36.560]  They're going to list antipositera group.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:39.560]  And they're going to list Q as one as well.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.560]  Like they already did.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:44.560]  And Q is the perfect cutout.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.560]  Because they can have their operatives do it
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.560]  and then blame it on the movement.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.560]  Anything anonymous like that is made to set people up.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:54.560]  That's why I'm out in the open and what I stand for is clear.
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:50:14.560]  Info wars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:18.560]  Two days after Alex Jones predicts that false flags
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.560]  are going to be carried out and blamed on the QAnon movement
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.560]  and American patriots,
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:29.560]  lone gunman Patrick Crucius is arrested for the El Paso Massacre.
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.560]  His social media page My Life was changed to say
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.560]  that he was a follower of QAnon
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:38.560]  and his designation as a registered Democrat
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:42.560]  was changed to Republican.
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:46.560]  The first reports from El Paso police and the El Paso mayor
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:49.560]  were that there were multiple shooters.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:52.560]  Eyewitnesses claimed to have seen multiple shooters
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.560]  dressed in black.
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:55.560]  What else did you see?
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.560]  Did you see people running out, that kind of thing?
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:00.560]  I even saw the guy with the gun.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.560]  I saw him twice.
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:03.560]  What did he look like?
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.560]  Was he dressed in an angle?
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:08.560]  About six foot.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.560]  He had an AK-47.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.560]  Was he dressed in military?
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.560]  All black, all black.
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.560]  He had a mask.
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.560]  How many people did you see?
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:22.560]  Three or four people.
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:24.560]  But before the end of the day,
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:26.560]  without any investigation,
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:29.560]  Patrick Crucius was named as the lone gunman,
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.560]  white nationalist,
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.560]  and linked to the 8chan board
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:35.560]  where the QAnon movement resides.
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:36.560]  So that's some of the clips.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:37.560]  Great job guys pulling that up.
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:38.560]  I literally told the crew coming out of break,
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.560]  find the video, they scrambled and did it.
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.560]  So Mike, you mentioned that.
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:43.560]  I thought we'd play some of that.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.560]  I mean, this is ridiculous
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:48.560]  how many holes are in this.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:50.560]  Yeah.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:53.560]  And some big breaking items here.
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.560]  Fedbizops.com has a bid put out by the FBI
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:01.560]  to build what they call a pre-crime system
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:03.560]  where they want every FBI agent
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:05.560]  to be able to search social media
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:09.560]  and find people who they say are guilty of pre-crime.
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:12.560]  Now, Alex, you and I know that will be used
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:15.560]  by the FBI to recruit people
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:18.560]  to carry out acts of terrorism
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.560]  as described by the New York Times
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:21.560]  and the Kansas City Star Wars.
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:22.560]  Exactly.
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:23.560]  It's to scan and find all the unstable people
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:25.560]  that fit the prototype.
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:26.560]  Exactly.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:29.560]  And sadly, President Trump is falling right into this.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.560]  President Trump is saying that the tech giants
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.560]  need more power to stop shootings
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:36.560]  by having pre-crime algorithms,
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.560]  not knowing that President Trump himself
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:40.560]  is contributing to the construction
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.560]  of a massive surveillance police state system
[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:46.560]  that's actually going to be used by the corrupt factions
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:47.560]  of the FBI.
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.560]  Again, not all factions are bad,
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.560]  but there are bad factions in the FBI
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:54.560]  to recruit people to carry out these acts of terrorism.
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:57.560]  And that's indisputable that the FBI
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:00.560]  has a long history of recruiting people to carry out acts.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.560]  Now, typically, the FBI will stop those acts
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.560]  at the very last minute,
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.560]  or the bomb will be a fake,
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:10.560]  or the gun will have a black...
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:12.560]  Let's be clear from declassified documents
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.560]  like Northwoods and many others.
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:15.560]  Most of the FBI, or even the CIA,
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:17.560]  is trying to catch real people doing it.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:18.560]  They can only convict them,
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:19.560]  or they can convince them to carry it out.
[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:21.560]  But then, other times, they'll remove people.
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.560]  Black cats will step in.
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:25.560]  They'll use the drill as the bootleg
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:26.560]  to fund the real event.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.560]  Then they'll set up the Patsy.
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.560]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:31.560]  And importantly, Alex,
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:33.560]  because notice the extreme censorship
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:34.560]  that's in place right now.
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:36.560]  Over the weekend, you did not see any videos
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.560]  on YouTube that were allowed
[01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:40.560]  to question the official narrative.
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:42.560]  This means the censorship overlay
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.560]  is so complete now, and so effective,
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.560]  that no alternative analysis is allowed
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:49.560]  on any major platform.
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:51.560]  This is the test case, I believe, Alex.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.560]  This is the test case.
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:53.560]  Now, they can roll out...
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:54.560]  We said this. We said this.
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:55.560]  Christ... I'm just interrupting,
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:56.560]  because you're so on target.
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:58.560]  Christ Church was the baited test
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.560]  in a more controlled, safe nation
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.560]  where the globalists had full control.
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:03.560]  Now, they're going to export this everywhere else.
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.560]  You said that at the time.
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:07.560]  Well, that's exactly right, yeah.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.560]  And the next attack to come
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:11.560]  will be much, much bigger.
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:13.560]  And it's clear they're going to target
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.560]  either a crowd of Antifa people
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:18.560]  and then blame it on a QAnon follower, perhaps,
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:20.560]  or a white supremacist or a Trump follower,
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.560]  or someone who watches Infowars,
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:23.560]  for that matter.
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:25.560]  Or there are calls now
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:28.560]  for anti-gun marches across America.
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.560]  I think John Kasich called for that.
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:32.560]  And it's clear that these marches
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.560]  will likely be targeted
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:37.560]  by, again, some kind of a patsy setup.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:39.560]  Exactly. They'll get a bunch of kids leading it.
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.560]  And, of course, the politicians
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:42.560]  will step away last minute
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.560]  and a bunch of kids will get mowed down.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.560]  Yeah. Look, the radical left,
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:47.560]  they know they're losing.
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.560]  The deep state is about to be exposed.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:51.560]  They have to change the narrative.
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:53.560]  There are probably going to be criminal indictments
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:55.560]  against many of the people in the deep state,
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:56.560]  even inside the FBI,
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.560]  who have been involved
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.560]  in these types of events in the past.
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.560]  So they have to change the narrative.
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:06.560]  They need, they need a 9-11 scale event
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:09.560]  to have national outrage
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:12.560]  to condemn their political enemies,
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:15.560]  who are, of course, Trump supporters,
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.560]  you know, QAnon followers, and so on.
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.560]  So we're in very dangerous waters right now.
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.560]  And most of the violence that's taking place
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:24.560]  in America is pre-planned.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.560]  Now, the violence is real,
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:29.560]  but it is being manipulated or shaped
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:30.560]  for a political purpose.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:32.560]  And that is the definition of terrorism,
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:34.560]  to carry out acts of violence
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.560]  in order to achieve a political outcome.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:39.560]  And this is terrorism that's false flagged terrorism.
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:41.560]  In other words, the violence is real,
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:42.560]  but the narrative is fake,
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:45.560]  and it's designed to achieve a specific political purpose.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:48.560]  So that's, things are about to get way worse.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:49.560]  Just as you said, Alex,
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:50.560]  this is just the beginning
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:52.560]  of what we're going to see in America.
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:55.560]  And Mike, everybody can feel it.
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:56.560]  Everybody can see it.
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:57.560]  There's a history of this.
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:55:58.560]  You can see the scripting.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:00.560]  You can see the preparations.
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.560]  You can see Antifa coming down there,
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:04.560]  right as Steve Bannon is organizing a rally
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.560]  that was already set up September 1st.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.560]  This is a major confluence way beyond
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:11.560]  what we saw in Charlottesville
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.560]  that was also a staged event by both sides.
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:15.560]  That's why they're so angry at us for exposing
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:17.560]  that the entire leadership were Democrats
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:18.560]  a year before.
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:21.560]  This is the only way they can try to bring us down
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:24.560]  and defeat this American reassurgence.
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:27.560]  But when you talk about how we're entering
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.560]  this great time of crisis,
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:31.560]  there's no doubt the Chai comms
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.560]  on a scale of one to 10 have pulled an 11
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:36.560]  trying to crush the U.S. economy.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.560]  All I can tell TV and radio listeners
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.560]  and people that are watching and listening,
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.560]  there could come a time very soon
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.560]  where the only way you can communicate with us
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.560]  is at infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:46.560]  because you gave us your emails
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:48.560]  so we can send you videos and articles.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:49.560]  This could all be shut down.
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.560]  The only way you can communicate with Mike
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:52.560]  is if you sign up for his newsletter.
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:55.560]  We are really entering a real crisis time
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:57.560]  that we've been preparing for for a long time.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:01.560]  So right now, whether you're listening on AM, FM stations,
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:04.560]  whether you are listening on shortwave,
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:05.560]  whether you're listening on the Internet,
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:09.560]  you've got to tell people,
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:12.560]  you've got to tell people, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:15.560]  that it is critical for them to tune into this broadcast
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.560]  so they understand what's really happening,
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.560]  so they understand what's really unfolding.
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:23.560]  Because they've had the power to shut down
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.560]  everything on the Internet for a while.
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:26.560]  They've already put the kill switch in
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.560]  on all the big platforms.
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:30.560]  Now they're coming for everybody else right now.
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:32.560]  And they got something really big planned
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.560]  that they don't want us on air when they pull it,
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.560]  and I think everybody can see that.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:37.560]  Everybody knows that.
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:39.560]  Something big is about to hit.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:40.560]  This is just a prelude.
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:42.560]  They're trying to start a race war.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:44.560]  It's an incredibly dangerous prey
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:46.560]  that God opens people's eyes.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.560]  Before I started working at infowars,
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:52.560]  I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and infowars.com,
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.560]  but also the products at infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:57.560]  And there's one product that's offered at infowarsstore.com
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:00.560]  that is the elite of the supplements,
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.560]  and that's DNA Force Plus.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.560]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.560]  with some of his special guests,
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:09.560]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:11.560]  So I started to look into the science
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.560]  and what telomeres were,
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:16.560]  and how it can improve your health and longevity
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.560]  when you protect your telomeres.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.560]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus,
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.560]  but it's expensive.
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:24.560]  Why? Because it is an elite supplement.
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.560]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:30.560]  with competitive supplements for telomere support,
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:32.560]  and they came and they went.
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:35.560]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:37.560]  It is the elite supplement.
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.560]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:41.560]  because I know it's expensive.
[01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:43.560]  So you should take advantage of 50% off
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:50.560]  DNA Force Plus at infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:16.560]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.560]  We need it now.
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.560]  You can take on Big Tech.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:24.560]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war,
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:28.560]  pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:31.560]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones,
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:33.560]  then when people say,
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:35.560]  okay, take him off the air,
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:37.560]  everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:40.560]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:42.560]  and make it a standard of freedom
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:43.560]  and free speech.
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:45.560]  Understand that they believe they can take us down.
[01:59:45.560 --> 02:00:14.560]  They'll take everybody else down.
[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:17.560]  The law enforcement sources in El Paso
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:21.560]  who gave me the apprehended shooter's name and age,
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:24.560]  a second suspect was killed when police responded
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:26.560]  to the Walmart shooting.
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:28.560]  The police have not disclosed this info yet.
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:30.560]  Mayor says otherwise, but my sources says
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:34.560]  second suspect is dead.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:36.560]  Now, again, this is a respected reporter that's talking to police
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:39.560]  that she says gave her the name and photo of the guy
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:41.560]  before it even broke.
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:44.560]  And they're saying, no, we killed somebody.
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:46.560]  There's witnesses, there's dozens of these videos.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.560]  They said they either saw multiple shooters
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:52.560]  or saw people in full black with masks on.
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:55.560]  You don't just confuse one guy without wearing a mask,
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:57.560]  with guys wearing masks.
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:59.560]  This is amazing information.
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:02.560]  So there you have Washington Examiner reporting
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.560]  that the police said, no, we killed somebody else,
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:06.560]  but they're being told be quiet.
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.560]  Just like Vegas, folks.
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:10.560]  Just like Vegas.
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:13.560]  So this is some big stuff going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:15.560]  Now, let's stop by a club of a few of the witnesses.
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:17.560]  Here it is.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:18.560]  I'm going to go now.
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.560]  When we get there, we're going to pay.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:26.560]  I'm going to wait to see some men on the end.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.560]  Is that for one person?
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:29.560]  Yes.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:34.560]  At least three or four people.
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:36.560]  How are they dressed?
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:38.560]  They're dressed in black.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:40.560]  I was just so worried about those kids, man,
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:43.560]  because I heard there was more than one shooter.
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:44.560]  I heard it was four.
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.560]  And I'm just worried about those kids.
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:47.560]  I wasn't even really worried about them.
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:48.560]  I was trying to pick up the kids, man.
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:51.560]  I wasn't really worried about myself.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:53.560]  And we've got witness after witness.
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:56.560]  We just played them last segment saying the same thing, Mike Adams.
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:57.560]  Yes, Alex.
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:00.560]  What's crucial to understand about all of this
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:03.560]  is the fact that one person could not have possibly carried out
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.560]  this shooting according to any kind of common sense analysis.
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:13.560]  Number one, he's firing an AK-47, which uses 7.62x39 ammunition.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.560]  And that ammunition has a conical shape,
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:17.560]  which is why the magazines are curved,
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:19.560]  which means magazines that are curved
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:22.560]  will tend to flop out of your pockets if you don't secure them.
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:25.560]  People who've never done running and gunning
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:26.560]  probably don't realize this,
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:29.560]  but you have to have a chest rig to carry spare magazines
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:30.560]  for an AK-47.
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.560]  You can't just slap it in the back pocket.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:35.560]  You can see he doesn't have anything in his pockets,
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:37.560]  anything on his back.
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:40.560]  He just has one banana clip.
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:41.560]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:43.560]  He would have had to have a chest rig.
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:47.560]  He would have needed a minimum of three to four magazines to carry this out.
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:50.560]  You don't shoot and kill 20 people and wound almost 30 people
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.560]  with one 30-round magazine,
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:55.560]  which is what is shown in that screenshot.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:58.560]  Even the best shooters, military-train shooters,
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:00.560]  miss all the time.
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.560]  90% plus of all the shots fired by soldiers are misses.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:07.560]  It's probably like 98%.
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:13.560]  It's not easy to carry out what he is alleged to have done,
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:15.560]  and I'm not saying that people weren't shot.
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:17.560]  People were obviously shot and killed,
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:21.560]  but they were clearly shot and killed by more than one assailant.
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:22.560]  That's my point.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:23.560]  More than one,
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:26.560]  and the eyewitnesses are saying that they were masked assailants.
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:28.560]  So put the pieces of this puzzle together.
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:30.560]  It's pretty obvious what happened.
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:34.560]  And again, we'll add in post to this when we uploaded the photo of him
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:36.560]  coming into the supposed Walmart,
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:38.560]  and he doesn't have any of the stuff added to it.
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:39.560]  That's key to add post.
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:43.560]  Absolutely essential for TV viewers and for radio listeners
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:45.560]  so that they can see that he's coming in.
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:46.560]  He doesn't have any of the gear on.
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:47.560]  Nothing in his pockets.
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:51.560]  That is a critical piece of evidence that you just raised there, Mike Adams.
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:54.560]  Right, and the photo shows that he's a right-handed shooter.
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:57.560]  So when you're reloading an AK and you're a right-handed shooter,
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:03:59.560]  you're reloading with your left hand.
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:02.560]  Your left hand is what's reaching for the magazine.
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:06.560]  So you would position and stage magazines on the left side of your body,
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:08.560]  the left side of the chest rig,
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:10.560]  or the left side of a battle belt.
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:13.560]  A battle belt, the magazines would normally be stacked
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:16.560]  so that they're positioned vertically on that battle belt.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:17.560]  They would be very obvious.
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:19.560]  They would not be difficult to see.
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:20.560]  I mean, they stick out.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:21.560]  They're curved magazines, again,
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.560]  because of the shape of the brass of the AK rounds.
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:27.560]  So it's clear this guy had one magazine.
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:28.560]  That's it.
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:30.560]  And you can't do this shooting with one magazine.
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:31.560]  And we had...
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:34.560]  Even if they threw spare magazines on the ground,
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:38.560]  the crucious El Paso shooter couldn't have done this.
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:41.560]  Not with one magazine. It's impossible.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:44.560]  They don't even have this guy on the ground.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.560]  I mean, this whole thing is just unbelievable.
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:48.560]  Well, you can see how the media is acting.
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:49.560]  They're going to make their move.
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:51.560]  The FBI says more shootings are coming.
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:52.560]  And the American people are being told,
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:53.560]  turn our guns in.
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:54.560]  Wow.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:57.560]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:04:59.560]  of a new supplement routine.
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:02.560]  That's why we created the 8-Pack PowerStack,
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.560]  your go-to option for the building blocks
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:07.560]  of a successful approach to supplementation.
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.560]  This one-stop shop for those looking to simplify
[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:11.560]  or adjust their routine
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:14.560]  is perfect for new and old info warriors alike.
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:17.560]  With the 8-Pack PowerStack, there's no trial and error,
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:19.560]  messy bottles laying across the counter,

[02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:23.560]  Very credible saying we saw three or four shooters,
[02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:25.560]  black masks on.
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:28.560]  This guy comes in with one magazine,
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:31.560]  Banana Magazine, doesn't have anything in his pockets,
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:33.560]  appears not to have a backpack.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:35.560]  How'd he do all this?
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:37.560]  Mike Adams is making a great point,
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:40.560]  and then Anna Gerritelli is the reporter
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:42.560]  covering DHS, border immigration,
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:45.560]  and alumni for Washington Examiner.
[02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:47.560]  She says, listen, I've talked to law enforcement,
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:49.560]  they killed another suspect,
[02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:51.560]  but I've been told not to talk about it,
[02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:53.560]  and this just fits into everything.
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:55.560]  This whole thing, Mike Adams of naturalnews.com,
[02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:57.560]  stinks to high heaven,
[02:06:57.560 --> 02:06:59.560]  and I think you've been making the right point.
[02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:01.560]  I have a huge point here, Alex.
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:03.560]  I'm sorry to interrupt,
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:06.560]  but when people are trained to be shooters,
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:09.560]  whether in the military or as private citizens,
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:11.560]  the only time you wear ear pro and eye pro,
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:13.560]  that's protection for your ears and eyes,
[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:15.560]  is when you are engaged in training.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:17.560]  This so-called shooter
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:19.560]  was wearing ear protection and eye protection,
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:21.560]  which means that in his mind,
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:23.560]  he believed this was a training exercise.
[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:25.560]  You don't go into a suicide mission
[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:28.560]  worried about whether or not your ears are going to work
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:31.560]  after you kill a bunch of people and get killed yourself.
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:33.560]  He, in his mind,
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:35.560]  believed this was a training exercise
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:37.560]  and it's visual proof right there.
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:39.560]  And let me add more.
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:41.560]  What about the Antifa individual who said he loves Satan
[02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:43.560]  and all the rest of it,
[02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:45.560]  up in Ohio,
[02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:47.560]  he was reportedly,
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:50.560]  ABC News is reporting, CNN is reporting,
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:53.560]  was wearing ear protection as well.
[02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:55.560]  Well, I hadn't heard that yet.
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:57.560]  If that's confirmed, that's yet another
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:07:59.560]  shocking example of this.
[02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:01.560]  You have to start to wonder,
[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:03.560]  did these people believe they were firing blanks?
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:05.560]  Did these people believe they were aiding
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:07.560]  law enforcement in a training exercise
[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:09.560]  to protect innocent people
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:11.560]  from antifa terrorism, perhaps?
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:13.560]  And you've alluded to that possibility.
[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:15.560]  Again, we don't know exactly what happened.
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:17.560]  We're asking a lot of what if questions,
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:19.560]  but the visual evidence is undeniable.
[02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:21.560]  You don't go into a suicide mission
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:23.560]  wearing ear protection.
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:25.560]  You only wear that if you think it's a training exercise.
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:27.560]  It's very clear.
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:29.560]  And of course, the media won't allow you to ask any of these questions
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:31.560]  and the tech giants have censored everybody
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:33.560]  who has an independent analysis
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:35.560]  of this.
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:37.560]  So you're not even allowed to analyze events anymore
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:39.560]  unless you agree with the official narrative,
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:41.560]  which frankly is unraveling
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:43.560]  by the hour.
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:45.560]  Now, there's the CNN headline.
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:47.560]  He wore hearing protection.
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:49.560]  This is just unprecedented.
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:51.560]  And what I used to
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:53.560]  hear from some of the experts
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:55.560]  and people I trust is, in the future
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:57.560]  they would use all these active shooter drills
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:59.560]  as the cover then
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:01.560]  for someone else
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.560]  to then come in and carry something out.
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.560]  But look, we know last year
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:07.560]  in Broward County controlled by the Clintons
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:09.560]  that the police stood down on purpose
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:11.560]  and that David Hogg
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:13.560]  said he was at home
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:15.560]  when the shooting happened and got there after.
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:17.560]  But then he's in videos. I'm inside.
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:19.560]  I'm in the closet. He's outside shooting.
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.560]  I mean, which David Hogg is telling the truth here?
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:23.560]  Well, it's also, it's very sad
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:25.560]  that Trump is parroting
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:27.560]  the mainstream media narrative here saying
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:29.560]  that this is white supremacist behind all of this.
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.560]  Now, perhaps the El Paso shooter
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:33.560]  had some very bizarre racial
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:35.560]  segregation views.
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:37.560]  Those are the views actually espoused
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:39.560]  by Democrat KKK leaders
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:41.560]  who supported segregation
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:43.560]  and opposed integration.
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:45.560]  You know, it's the Democrat KKK
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:47.560]  that wanted blacks and whites to be separate
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:49.560]  which is what this El Paso
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:51.560]  shooter has espoused.
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:53.560]  So, you know, Trump is falling for the media narrative
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.560]  on this and he's calling for red flag laws
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:57.560]  and he used a quote
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:59.560]  where he wants guns to be
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:01.560]  taken through rapid due process.
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:03.560]  Well, Alex,
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:05.560]  if it's rapid, it's not due process.
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:07.560]  So, Trump is falling
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:09.560]  for this and he needs to be
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:11.560]  alerted to the fact that he's playing right into the narrative
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:13.560]  of the gun control left.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.560]  All right. Well,
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:19.560]  one thing's for sure. I'm on the edge of my seat
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:21.560]  and you can see the media saying it's Trump's fault.
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.560]  It's all gun owners fault.
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.560]  It's QAnon's fault. It's my fault.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:27.560]  It's Paul Joseph Watson's fault.
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:29.560]  The Southern Parvy Law Center that kind of writes the scripts
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:31.560]  for all this. We know they ran El Ames City
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:33.560]  and the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:35.560]  That even came out in federal law suits and court documents
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:37.560]  that they were controlling major white supremacist
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:39.560]  groups across the country.
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:41.560]  They came out and said, oh, look, it's QAnon and Alex Jones.
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:43.560]  This guy's a fan of them.
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:45.560]  Off of people going on his social media,
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:47.560]  taking down that he was a Democrat
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:49.560]  and adding
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:51.560]  that it's us.
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:53.560]  I mean, that right there is just bombshell information.
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:55.560]  This whole thing is unraveling
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:57.560]  Mike Adams incredibly quick.
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:59.560]  Well, we know you'll be following and covering it all
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:01.560]  at naturalnews.com. Thanks for joining us.
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:03.560]  Thank you.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:05.560]  Okay, we got Leo Zagami who's an expert on false flags
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:07.560]  and actually worked in the Italian Air Force
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:09.560]  and was involved
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:11.560]  on the edge of Operation Gladio
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:13.560]  that was a NATO plan staging hundreds
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.560]  of terror attacks to blame it on the left
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:17.560]  to maintain control.
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:19.560]  Some of our other guests were in and around
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:21.560]  Italy at the same time
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:23.560]  like Steve Pachimic.
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:25.560]  But we're going to be talking to Leo Zagami
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:27.560]  coming up.
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:29.560]  The fact is this stuff goes on.
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:31.560]  It's not just in movies like Arlington Road
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:33.560]  and
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:35.560]  when you've got the Washington Examiner
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:37.560]  saying the police
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:39.560]  told their reporters that there were multiple shooters
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:41.560]  and all these credible witnesses
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.560]  are like,
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:45.560]  no, I saw the shooters.
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:47.560]  They were running around three or four of them
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:49.560]  and I was up close there wearing full black
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:51.560]  mask and everything.
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:53.560]  And then you got the one idiot running in
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:55.560]  whose dad's
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:57.560]  run psychiatric facilities
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:59.560]  but only has a two-year degree.
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:01.560]  That's always really interesting.
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:03.560]  And then it's in a cult
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:05.560]  admittedly in a new age cult that they run.
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:07.560]  I mean, that's always the MO.
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:09.560]  Psychiatric facilities and they've got a cult
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:11.560]  on the side and then, oh, members of the cult
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.560]  go out and do something. I'm not saying
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:15.560]  that's what happened here.
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.560]  I'm saying
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:19.560]  with the whole history of things being staged
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:21.560]  we'd be crazy if we weren't talking about it
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:23.560]  and we weren't looking at it
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:25.560]  and just see the media seize on this
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:27.560]  and try to create copycats.
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.560]  As the FBI is now warning
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:31.560]  and to see gun owners blame
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:33.560]  when still mass shootings don't even kill
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:35.560]  100 people here in this country
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:37.560]  but the media hypes them like they're the end
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:39.560]  of the world and they are if the people
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:41.560]  getting killed. It's terrible.
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:43.560]  They don't talk about the hundreds of thousands
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:45.560]  dead in Mexico or mass shootings every day there.
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:47.560]  No.
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:49.560]  They do it to invoke
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.560]  racial division
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:53.560]  and then eight chans taken down
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:55.560]  but, oh,
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:57.560]  everybody else, Facebook, Twitter, they let you
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:59.560]  promote the manifesto
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:01.560]  but then say, should we start censoring
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.560]  the web more to stop hateful manifestos?
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:05.560]  All the media does
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:07.560]  is create hate division. We're going to go
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:09.560]  to break, come back with Leo Zagami
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:11.560]  here in the U.S. right now
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:13.560]  but also a researcher, expert
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:15.560]  on the Illuminati. Now these secret societies
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:17.560]  work and operate.
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:19.560]  Say hi to Leo. Leo, how you doing
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:21.560]  my friend? We're going to go to you in just
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.560]  a second. I know you've got a lot coming up.
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:25.560]  Great to be
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:27.560]  with you and great to see that you're right
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:29.560]  on target with everything you're saying.
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:31.560]  Well, I just can feel the energy and the danger right now
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:33.560]  so we'll talk to you my friend. Thanks for coming on a short notice
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:35.560]  and then please don't forget ladies and gentlemen
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:37.560]  we are
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:39.560]  100% here because of you
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:41.560]  and
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:43.560]  they've clearly been trying to silence us. Everybody
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:45.560]  gets it up ahead of this. They don't want to see
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:47.560]  you're asking these questions. They don't want to see
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:49.560]  you're covering all these different angles.
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:51.560]  So
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.560]  again, your financial support
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:55.560]  is how we operate but folks
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:57.560]  love big sales so it takes a lot of sales
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:59.560]  at this price
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:01.560]  but people respond so we're able to fund ourselves

[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:23.560]  down, don't say his name
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:25.560]  and Facebook says okay, we won't allow you to even say his name
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.560]  in a positive light
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:29.560]  or his website, well, they can't stop you
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.560]  from telling people it's still up, it's still

[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:17.560]  Make no mistake, you're living in
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:21.560]  incredibly historical times.
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:25.560]  I am so
[02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:27.560]  wound up by the energy and what's
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:29.560]  happening that I'm just beside myself
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:31.560]  right now. This is it.
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:33.560]  The giant pedophile rings are being
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.560]  exposed, the world government is being
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:37.560]  exposed, the tyranny is being
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:39.560]  exposed, and the whole world
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:41.560]  government system is in collapse
[02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:43.560]  and then magically the mass shooting
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:45.560]  start and one of them is admitted
[02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:47.560]  Antifa that says Hail Satan
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:49.560]  almost nine out of ten are like that.
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:51.560]  And then you've got this other guy
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:53.560]  with his dad running
[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:55.560]  psychiatric facilities and running a cult
[02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:57.560]  even the media says a cult leader.
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:20:59.560]  Well that's mind control.
[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:01.560]  And then you've got
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:03.560]  them going into social media and
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:05.560]  changing him from democrat to republican
[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:07.560]  and it just gets crazier
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:09.560]  and crazier and crazier
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:11.560]  and crazier and crazier and crazier
[02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:13.560]  and crazier and crazier. Please don't forget
[02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:15.560]  it's not just the Alex Jones show here
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:17.560]  at the tip of the spear with
[02:21:17.560 --> 02:21:19.560]  Info Wars. It's the David Knight show
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:21.560]  weekday mornings 8 a.m.
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:23.560]  till 11 when I come on
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.560]  and then after I go off at 3 p.m. it is
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:27.560]  the great Owen Schreuer.
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:29.560]  So you definitely don't want to miss
[02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:31.560]  any of these broadcasts. And again
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:33.560]  I keep hammering it because it's
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:35.560]  beyond key. If you don't tell
[02:21:35.560 --> 02:21:37.560]  people by word of mouth about newswars.com
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:39.560]  about infowars.com about your local
[02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:41.560]  radio stations and TV stations, no one
[02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:43.560]  will do it. You've been doing it.
[02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:45.560]  It's making them really angry. We're in a total
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:47.560]  war. If you don't tell people about LeoZagami.com
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:49.560]  he's been de-platformed.
[02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:51.560]  He's been arrested. I mean LeoZagami
[02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:53.560]  told us
[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:55.560]  who the new pope would be five years before
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:57.560]  that they didn't have two popes that never happened
[02:21:57.560 --> 02:21:59.560]  before that they would start talking about having
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:01.560]  world
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:03.560]  government and all of this
[02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:05.560]  and he's been proven right and he was in the
[02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:07.560]  Air Force. He was even involved
[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:09.560]  in Gladio.
[02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:11.560]  And so we'll tell you about Gladio. That was a
[02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:13.560]  NATO operation with our government involved
[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:15.560]  staging hundreds of shootings
[02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:17.560]  and bombings against political enemies
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:19.560]  to blame them
[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:21.560]  with false flags.
[02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:23.560]  So I'm not saying this is a false flag
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:25.560]  but you have the reporter for business
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:27.560]  insider. You have reporters
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:29.560]  for Washington examiners saying
[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:31.560]  they've talked to the police
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:33.560]  and they shot a second shooter
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:35.560]  but have been told don't talk about it.
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:37.560]  Anna
[02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:39.560]  Giuratelli
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:41.560]  and you've got all the witnesses saying the same thing.
[02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:43.560]  I'm saying we have a right to question this
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:45.560]  with the gulp of Tonkin getting us into
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:47.560]  Vietnam attacks on ships that never happened.
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:49.560]  I mean we did have some of our patrol boats
[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.560]  fire on our ships. That did happen.
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:53.560]  But the North Vietnamese didn't do it.
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:55.560]  We did have no babies
[02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:57.560]  and incubators to get in the Iraq war.
[02:22:57.560 --> 02:22:59.560]  This is done over and over again. So LeoZagami
[02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:01.560]  you've got the floor my friend for the rest of
[02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:03.560]  the hour here that Matt Bracken pops in
[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:05.560]  and of course
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:07.560]  the trends forecaster and good friend of mine
[02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:09.560]  also be joining us Gerald Salente
[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:11.560]  but folks need to understand
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:13.560]  that from just a gut level the way the media is behaving
[02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:15.560]  the way all this stuff doesn't add up
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:17.560]  the way they are lying
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:19.560]  the way they're blaming everybody that
[02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:21.560]  this is clearly how they're going to try to start their race for.
[02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:23.560]  What do you think LeoZagami?
[02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:25.560]  Hello Alex. Well I was actually
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:27.560]  involved like you said in the last
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:29.560]  year of Operation Gladio that was finally
[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:31.560]  revealed by
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:33.560]  an Italian politician called Julio Andreotti
[02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:35.560]  in October of 1990.
[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:37.560]  I was in the Air Force
[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:39.560]  and I was recruited by Operation Gladio
[02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:41.560]  mainly to dispose
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:43.560]  of all the documents that
[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:45.560]  had been
[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:47.560]  of course they were compromising documents
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:49.560]  and also lists of members that needed
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:51.560]  to disappear.
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:53.560]  So I unfortunately
[02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:55.560]  became part of this operation
[02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:57.560]  and I got to meet some of the
[02:23:57.560 --> 02:23:59.560]  key people in this operation
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:01.560]  and Dante Giorgio Balestieri who then was
[02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:03.560]  protected
[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:05.560]  by the US and became a US citizen
[02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:07.560]  and involved with the Democratic
[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:09.560]  Party and he
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:11.560]  also started to work for this
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:13.560]  great alliance that has been going on for years
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:15.560]  between the sons of Italy and the Democratic
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:17.560]  Party here in the US which was also
[02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:19.560]  connected to Operation Gladio.
[02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:21.560]  So watching
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:23.560]  these terrorists this because
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:25.560]  we can call them terrorist attacks that's what they
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:27.560]  are I mean they're not
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:29.560]  killing them as such but
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:31.560]  these people of course are being used
[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:33.560]  they are subliminally
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:35.560]  being convinced
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:37.560]  of what they are doing most of them don't
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:39.560]  even know that they are part of a scheme
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:41.560]  that is one of the great
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:43.560]  things that they have been
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:45.560]  experimented in the CA mine control
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:47.560]  quarters for a long time
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:49.560]  I think about
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:51.560]  we have probably a hundred years of experimentation
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:53.560]  on how subliminally
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:55.560]  be able to
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:57.560]  recruit people without even them knowing
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:59.560]  that they have been recruited
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:01.560]  and like you said earlier they are at times
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:03.560]  connected to the mental health
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:05.560]  institutions and
[02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:07.560]  myself I have my father
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:09.560]  who was a great psychiatrist who in the middle
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:11.560]  of the 70s actually abandoned
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:13.560]  completely psychiatry because
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:15.560]  of this kind of things because
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:17.560]  he was fed up that psychiatry could be
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:19.560]  used and manipulated
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:21.560]  for things that have nothing to do
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:23.560]  with mental health but
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:25.560]  everything to do with political
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:27.560]  he didn't like the weaponization
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:29.560]  because you come from an aristocratic family
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:31.560]  which I've been over there and seen for myself
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:33.560]  in Rome so it's not like you're part of the
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:35.560]  Illuminati you were just pretty much born
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:37.560]  into that recruited because
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:39.560]  of your aristocratic background
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:41.560]  yeah people don't know this but for example
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:43.560]  they attempted assassination of
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:45.560]  John Paul II was done by a gladio
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:47.560]  agent Aliakcha was not
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:49.560]  an agent of Bulgaria or the Russians
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:51.560]  he was an agent of NATO
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.560]  and gladio so
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:55.560]  I even met the guy
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:57.560]  who handed the pistol
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:25:59.560]  for killing the Pope this guy was
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:01.560]  called Prince Aliata di Moreale
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:03.560]  and he handed the pistol
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:05.560]  in a Masonic lodge in Sicily
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:07.560]  so things are very
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:09.560]  different from how they appear and
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:11.560]  what is happening now is very interesting
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:13.560]  and I've been reporting on it on my site
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:15.560]  because there is a lot of connections
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.560]  like for example last week
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:19.560]  we had this triggering word
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:21.560]  by one of the aspiring candidates
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:23.560]  this dark psychic force
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:25.560]  mentioned by Mariam Wills
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:27.560]  Williamson and we'll play that next segment
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:29.560]  since you mentioned it what was she invoking there
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:31.560]  well this is a trigger word
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:33.560]  because once you trigger
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:35.560]  with these words subliminally
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:37.560]  the agents get in action
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:39.560]  and Mariam Wills Williamson
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:41.560]  actually published a tweet
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:43.560]  between her and the father
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:45.560]  of the El Paso shooter
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:47.560]  so there is a connection
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:49.560]  both to say it it's a new age cult
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:51.560]  people think they are getting into the new age
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:53.560]  but really once they get into it
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:55.560]  they are being programmed
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:57.560]  but they are connected to one of the worst
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:59.560]  new age cult leaders of all time
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:01.560]  John of God who was connected
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:03.560]  also to Oprah Winfrey
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:05.560]  who has been exposed as a child trafficker
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:07.560]  and by the way they admit
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:09.560]  that this guy is a follower of John of God
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:11.560]  yes and he actually
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:13.560]  admitted himself in a video which I have
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:15.560]  published on one of my latest
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:17.560]  article because he actually
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:19.560]  says that admits that
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:21.560]  the followers of John of God inspired him
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:23.560]  from starting to work with crystals
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:25.560]  and he had rented his space
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:27.560]  to people that were trained directly
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:29.560]  by John of God so he admits it
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:31.560]  on camera we don't have to
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:33.560]  make a conspiracy theory about it
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:35.560]  we just have to see the evidence
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:37.560]  people don't know how this works when someone is in psychiatry
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:39.560]  he only had a two year degree
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:41.560]  but ran a major psychiatric facility
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:43.560]  that got Pentagon contracts of PTSD
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:45.560]  then
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:47.560]  they always have them set up a side cult
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:49.560]  to do stuff outside the medical license
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:51.560]  he leads cult groups
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:53.560]  in programming people and removing bad memories
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:55.560]  with sound therapy
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:57.560]  and when you start seeing those keywords
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:59.560]  you know what you are dealing with
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:01.560]  well my father got involved
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:03.560]  and that's why he worked out of it
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:05.560]  he had his own groups
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:07.560]  he was experimenting
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:09.560]  of course people from the intelligence world
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:11.560]  wanted to do dirty work
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:13.560]  that he didn't want to take
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:15.560]  he didn't want to operate with
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:17.560]  and this guy here
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:19.560]  the father of the El Paso shooter
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:21.560]  was involved with the Timberland
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:23.560]  psychotic hospital
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:25.560]  which was actually closed last year
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:27.560]  for safety violations
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:29.560]  and treated their patients in a terrible way
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:31.560]  because most of the time these people
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:33.560]  in the outside world
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:35.560]  they promote themselves as the great gurus
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.560]  of some new age and life
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:39.560]  well stay there explain to us when we come back
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:41.560]  but the big thing is what's coming next
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:43.560]  everyone can feel the swarm clouds
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:45.560]  it ever felt like a heavy air but electricity
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:47.560]  you haven't been looking at the weather
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:49.560]  but you go outside and there's giant thunder heads
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:51.560]  it's that feeling it's like big thunder heads
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:29:20.560]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and will never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the name.
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:23.560]  National treatment advisors

[02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:54.560]  That's 800-506-6740
[02:29:56.560 --> 02:30:00.560]  We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:02.560]  crossed the continent
[02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:04.560]  harness science

[02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:32.560]  it's Alex Jones
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:35.560]  Well, good and evil never been more clear
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:38.560]  the Democrats and liberals all over the world
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:41.560]  are uncloking his leftist left hand path stateless
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:43.560]  they're openly saying we're going to pull down
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:45.560]  God, country, the family
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:48.560]  we're going to kill the born, the unborn, the old people
[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:50.560]  but oh, people got shot, give us your guns
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:52.560]  we're so sad
[02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:54.560]  it's unbelievable
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:56.560]  the cultural rot and evil we're seeing
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:58.560]  expand everywhere
[02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:00.560]  and they're making their move
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:02.560]  and I have this sense of urgency
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:04.560]  this sense of I'm upset at myself
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:06.560]  that there's something I need to do
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:08.560]  there's something I need to say
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:11.560]  to stop this
[02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:14.560]  because we know more is coming
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:17.560]  and we know both these guys were leftist
[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:19.560]  they were so sloppy
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:21.560]  they didn't even cover up their social media
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:23.560]  when they said I hate God
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:25.560]  I hate Christians, I hate fascists
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:27.560]  that means conservatives and Christians
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:29.560]  I'm going to kill them
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.560]  and then it all gets taken down and replaced
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:33.560]  with fake stuff
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:35.560]  and you go to the Wayback Machine and the Google Archive
[02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:37.560]  and it's really them saying
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:39.560]  I'm a Satanist, Hail Satan
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:41.560]  and then we watch them in real time
[02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:43.560]  change it
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:45.560]  I've now learned on both of them
[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:47.560]  and how huge is that
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:49.560]  now it turns out
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:51.560]  there's dozens of videos
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:53.560]  of credible veterans and people
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:55.560]  saying multiple shooters
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:57.560]  men in all black
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:59.560]  this guy comes in
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:01.560]  with a gun and one
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:03.560]  banana
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:05.560]  magazine
[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:07.560]  and
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:09.560]  then his dad
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:11.560]  is involved in all this weird crap
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:13.560]  the first thing I said Saturday was
[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:15.560]  I'm talking to reporters
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:17.560]  I go check and see if his family are psychiatrists
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:19.560]  or if he's been in the psychiatric system
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:21.560]  just like this guy that shot up the Baptist church
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:23.560]  was in an Air Force
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:25.560]  mental institution
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:27.560]  wasn't supposed to own a gun but was allowed to go buy one
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:29.560]  and now
[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:31.560]  what's the in-game goal of this Leo Zagami
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:33.560]  and do you have that same earnest
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:35.560]  pregnant feeling like something big
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:37.560]  is about to happen
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:39.560]  it's not even a fear or a verboding
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:41.560]  it's like we're already in the thick of the battle
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:43.560]  there's something we're not doing
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:45.560]  there's something we're missing here
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:47.560]  that's the overriding thing in my gut
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:49.560]  the Vatican
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:51.560]  has basically inspired
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:53.560]  in the last month or so
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:55.560]  a lot of his agents
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:35:57.560]  to arrange
[02:35:57.560 --> 02:35:59.560]  and push for a civil war
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:01.560]  they actually openly said that
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:03.560]  themselves that
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:05.560]  in their Catholic publications
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:07.560]  they are inviting people to civil disobedience
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:09.560]  that's the start of a civil war
[02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:11.560]  of course
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:13.560]  so they are secretly moving all their agents
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:15.560]  towards that project
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:17.560]  which is to create complete chaos
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:19.560]  and at that point
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:21.560]  they can install martial law
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.560]  and of course
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:25.560]  it's going to be our worst nightmare
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:27.560]  but what they are doing
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:29.560]  before that is even worse
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:31.560]  they are activating
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:33.560]  their sleeping cells
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:35.560]  all these Manchurian candidates
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:37.560]  people might not believe in this
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:39.560]  but there is plenty of evidence
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.560]  that subliminal operations
[02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:43.560]  have been conducted
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:45.560]  on unwilling citizens
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:47.560]  so inform yourself better
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:49.560]  and you will see that we are not
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:51.560]  conspiracy theorists here, we are just realists
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:53.560]  and I'm afraid that this is going to go on
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:55.560]  triggering more attacks
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:57.560]  and of course
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:36:59.560]  that their final end
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:01.560]  is to take all our guns away
[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:03.560]  because the US is one of the few states
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:05.560]  in the world
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:07.560]  that still has this
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:09.560]  great possibility
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:11.560]  for people to embrace a gun
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:13.560]  and defend yourself
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:15.560]  something that the rest of the world doesn't do anymore
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:17.560]  because now that kind of thing
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:19.560]  is done by the police
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:21.560]  by the military
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:23.560]  by all the mercenaries of the states
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:25.560]  that of course are prevalently socialist
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:27.560]  and that are implementing
[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:29.560]  this left wing and new war door
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:31.560]  so when it comes to Gladio
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:33.560]  people think that Gladio was only
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:35.560]  a communist operation
[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:37.560]  well it wasn't, it was much more than that
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:39.560]  it was both an anti-communist
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:41.560]  but also an anti-fascist
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:43.560]  it was everything
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:45.560]  that sabotaged
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:47.560]  the state
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:49.560]  so to make it very weak
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:51.560]  my readings of it, anything that was populist
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:53.560]  that would make the nation state strong
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:55.560]  they would sabotage, it was a sabotage
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:57.560]  of the nation state
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:37:59.560]  well in fact there was actually
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:01.560]  a guy called Andre Moyer
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:03.560]  who was a member of the Belgian military
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:05.560]  who was involved with Operation Gladio
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:07.560]  who said that the states behind networks
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:09.560]  were not only anti-communist
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:11.560]  but they were made for fighting
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:13.560]  subversion in general
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:15.560]  now what did they mean with that
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:17.560]  subversion was a very different thing
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:19.560]  that's right, Trump is seen as a subversion
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:21.560]  to the global order, populists now
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:23.560]  are and so these very same tools
[02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:25.560]  that were used against communists and others
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:27.560]  are now being used against the patriots
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:29.560]  well and of course now
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:31.560]  the whole thing after the end of the Cold War
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:33.560]  has reversed
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:35.560]  because communism and socialism
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:37.560]  are now being made gradually
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:39.560]  acceptable by the U.S. public
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:41.560]  something that would have been
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:43.560]  longer, let me bring up this wild card
[02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:45.560]  you know the anti-communists in this country
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:47.560]  knew about this full paradigm shift
[02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:49.560]  and they created an organic stay behind networks
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:51.560]  you could say I'm part of an organic
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:53.560]  stay behind network
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:55.560]  I was never officially paid
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:57.560]  I was never trained
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:38:59.560]  when I was around was already
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:01.560]  aware of the new world order
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:03.560]  the whole system coming
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:05.560]  and so basically there are organic groups
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:07.560]  everywhere preparing and preparing to resist
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:09.560]  but also politically fighting
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:11.560]  so there's also a third rail
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:13.560]  you could say of true organic
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:15.560]  stay behind paramilitary
[02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:17.560]  that's not under globalist control
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:19.560]  what would you call that?
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:21.560]  Yeah, I would call that a true resistance
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:23.560]  but then we have Antifa
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:25.560]  that is now instead
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:27.560]  is focusing on that kind of operation
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:29.560]  how to trigger Antifa
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:31.560]  against the conservatives
[02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:33.560]  and how to diminish
[02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:35.560]  the influence of conservative forces
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:37.560]  in this country this is their priority
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:39.560]  and of course with all the money
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:41.560]  that George Soros has invested in this
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:43.560]  about 18 billion
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:45.560]  well we have a
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:47.560]  long way to go.
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:49.560]  You didn't just say that
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:51.560]  he used to spend like 5 billion a year trying to topple Europe
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:53.560]  in the U.S. and Russia
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:55.560]  and the entire fortune
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:57.560]  last year they reported of
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:39:59.560]  86 billion
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:01.560]  to overthrow in the U.S.
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:03.560]  I mean that was the headline
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:05.560]  he literally just went all in
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:07.560]  I mean you can buy a lot of fake stuff for that
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:09.560]  Yeah, you can buy
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:11.560]  the lives of a lot of people
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:13.560]  and I've actually
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:15.560]  infiltrated years ago the
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:17.560]  black block groups that were
[02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:19.560]  basically what Antifa has become
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:21.560]  and those groups
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:23.560]  are very easily to both
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:25.560]  infiltrate, manipulate and buy
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:27.560]  because I mean
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:29.560]  most of them are
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:31.560]  living with money
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:33.560]  that comes either from
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:35.560]  the rich parents or either
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:37.560]  from the state that gives them this
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:39.560]  Exactly, they're all government employees
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:41.560]  or newspaper people
[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:43.560]  or they're paid by the foundations
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:45.560]  but what's coming next, I mean I can feel it
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:47.560]  you agree, you can feel it, you can see it
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:49.560]  all these reports coming out
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:51.560]  saying conspiracy theorist or the terrorist
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:53.560]  how they're using QAnon
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:55.560]  when people that like Q aren't bad
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:57.560]  I'm not saying they're bad but it uses it
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:40:59.560]  because it's secret as a way to set people up
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:01.560]  Yeah, of course
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:03.560]  this warning by the FBI
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:05.560]  means that
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:07.560]  they might try to restrict
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:09.560]  our civil liberties and the possibility
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:11.560]  to even investigate
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:13.560]  what they are planning behind closed doors
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:15.560]  so I don't like
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:17.560]  this situation and what
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:19.560]  is leading to
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:21.560]  I think that their plan is really
[02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:23.560]  to incite a civil war
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:25.560]  and this is really detrimental
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:27.560]  for people
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:29.560]  by the way Leo, you're not just saying that
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:31.560]  we now know this is happening
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:33.560]  that's the Rubicon we've passed
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:35.560]  they intend to remove populist and Trump
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:37.560]  they're committed now and they're really going to try it
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:39.560]  and when they finally try to remove Trump
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:41.560]  and the rest of his support
[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:43.560]  they're going to shut the internet off
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:45.560]  so I think that's why we're also freaked out
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:47.560]  right now they're going to go for it
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:49.560]  and the enemy
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:51.560]  is actually making themselves known as
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:53.560]  Satanist because that's their
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:55.560]  ideology in the end Antifa
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:57.560]  is overlapping with
[02:41:57.560 --> 02:41:59.560]  the satanic temple for that reason
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:01.560]  their ideology is
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:03.560]  Satanism and that means
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:05.560]  that we are going towards the mark of the
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:07.560]  Oh I saw that movie Hail Satan
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:09.560]  where they later admit they're real Satanists
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:11.560]  and they promote for Antifa in it
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:13.560]  it's the same group
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:15.560]  and of course we know how popular
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:17.560]  that movie was
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:19.560]  within the left wing
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:21.560]  you know the democrats this year
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:23.560]  they love this kind of things
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:25.560]  and they love Satanists
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:27.560]  because of course they are all
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:29.560]  prevalently atheist
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:31.560]  they're not necessarily Satanist
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:33.560]  they are satanist without knowing it
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:35.560]  because anybody who is an atheist
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:37.560]  is actually a satanist
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:39.560]  and that's a big problem that we're going to have
[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:41.560]  in the future we're going to end up probably
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:43.560]  against satanists
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:45.560]  that's right let's talk about that coming war
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:47.560]  with the satanist because it's here
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:49.560]  this is a war against the satan
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:51.560]  it's God versus the devil
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:53.560]  that's all there's ever been
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:55.560]  all there will ever be
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:13.560]  I remember when Alex first started talking about this
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:15.560]  with some of his special guests
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:17.560]  Telomere's and Telomere's support
[02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:19.560]  with your DNA
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:21.560]  so I started to look into the science
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:23.560]  and what Telomere's were
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:25.560]  health and longevity
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:27.560]  when you protect your Telomere
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:29.560]  so I started looking into DNA Force Plus
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:31.560]  but it's expensive why because it is
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:33.560]  an elite supplement
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:35.560]  and then I started seeing other competitors
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:37.560]  coming up with competitive supplements
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:39.560]  for Telomere's support
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:41.560]  and they came and they went
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:43.560]  but DNA Force Plus is still there
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:45.560]  it is the elite supplement
[02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:47.560]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:49.560]  because I know it's expensive
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:51.560]  so you should take advantage of 50% off
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:53.560]  DNA Force Plus
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:55.560]  at InfowarsStore.com
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:57.560]  It's not only that you have a unique voice
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:43:59.560]  in the public arena and the public square
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:01.560]  the other thing that's unique about Infowars
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:03.560]  is it isn't the only network of this reach
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:05.560]  that is not backed by a corporate donor
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:07.560]  or corporate sugar daddy
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:09.560]  that's not backed by some billionaire
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:11.560]  that's not being funded by secret foreign government
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:13.560]  it is completely independent of all that
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:17.560]  it is an old school American 1776 style experiment
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:19.560]  in the expression of the freedom of press
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:21.560]  in the expression of speech
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:23.560]  that in fact the founders were so concerned with
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:25.560]  at the beginning of the country
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:27.560]  they actually tried to support and subsidize
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:29.560]  organizations just like this
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:31.560]  because this was the kind of press they wanted
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:33.560]  and then ultimately we now live in an era
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:35.560]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:37.560]  or billionaire sugar daddies
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:39.560]  who've been able to control and manipulate
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:41.560]  what news and views the person's allowed to have
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:43.560]  or express or hear
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:45.560]  and the Infowars audience has broken through that
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:47.560]  they are the bridge from the founding
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:49.560]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:51.560]  onslaught of the blackwarming
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:53.560]  defamation, lawfare, and libel
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:55.560]  targeting youth
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:57.560]  last night
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:44:59.560]  I'm on infowars.com
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:01.560]  and I read Chris Pratt
[02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:03.560]  criticized for t-shirt choice
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:05.560]  it is literally the shirt that I
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:07.560]  envisioned a Betsy Ross
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:09.560]  but also another just classic American flag
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:11.560]  all 50 stars with the Gadsden snake
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:13.560]  superimposed over it
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:15.560]  and on the back America's back
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:17.560]  but what's better than just an American flag
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:19.560]  about a don't tread on me under the flag
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:21.560]  take don't tread on the American flag, it's a perfect combo
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:23.560]  so great minds think alike, I mean whoever designed that shirt
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:25.560]  we'd already come up with the exact same similar design
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:27.560]  it is the don't tread on me
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:29.560]  American flag t-shirt
[02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:31.560]  inspired by the triggering of leftist
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:33.560]  of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt
[02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:35.560]  but it's a battle tattered flag
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:37.560]  like the one that flew over Fort Sumter
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:39.560]  and again on the back it says
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:41.560]  americasbackinfowars.com
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:43.560]  4,000 of these
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:45.560]  eight babies and that's it
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:47.560]  so we've got the Betsy Ross version
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:49.560]  and the American flag version
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:51.560]  at infowarstore.com
[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:53.560]  they're printed in the USA

[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:57.560]  they'll be right back

[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:11.560]  but I wanted to take just a minute out here
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:13.560]  in my heart to tell you how much it means to me
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:15.560]  that when you saw those lies
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:17.560]  against us last week the worst things you can say about people
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:19.560]  that you knew they were liars
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:21.560]  you went and looked it up and found out the truth
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:23.560]  and so I feel very strong
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:25.560]  and I feel God's hand on my shoulder
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:27.560]  and I feel your love in my heart
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:29.560]  and I want you to know that love is right back at you
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:31.560]  and I want to thank you for all you've done

[02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:35.560]  and your financial support because I'm committed to fight to the end
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:37.560]  but I want to win
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:39.560]  and without you I'm going to be destroyed
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:41.560]  and that's not what's important the enemy could win
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:43.560]  we're a key chess piece in this fight
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:45.560]  we're being used by God
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:47.560]  you're being used by God this is providence

[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:29.560]  I've been on air 25 years

[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:33.560]  at a gut level felt

[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:03.560]  of the globalist knowing that they're playing
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:05.560]  for world government
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:07.560]  and they're playing for total censorship
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:09.560]  and they're playing for human animal clones
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:11.560]  and sex with children
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:13.560]  and Satanism is in trouble
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:15.560]  it can feel the spirit of Christ
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:17.560]  coming back into the world
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:19.560]  there's going to be a tribulation
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:21.560]  during this fight but the devil knows
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:23.560]  to lose
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:25.560]  the devil sins the beast with wrath
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:27.560]  because he knows his time is short
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:29.560]  and I can feel Satan's rage
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:31.560]  I know you can feel it
[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:33.560]  and they are planning a bloody revolution here
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:35.560]  they're planning massive censorship
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:37.560]  across the country and the world
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:39.560]  this is a time to be praying to Christ
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:41.560]  for justice and for freedom
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:43.560]  and that God's spirit come into you
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:45.560]  and lead God and direct you
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:47.560]  but it's also time to be politically
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:49.560]  and culturally active
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:51.560]  and I've heard about infowars.com
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:53.560]  and newswars.com
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:55.560]  and override the AI censors
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:57.560]  to override their systems
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:59.560]  and to let people know hey
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:01.560]  here's the name that must not be spoken
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:03.560]  here's what the world fears
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:05.560]  here's the guest and the information
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:07.560]  and the history and the analysis
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:09.560]  that is the cure to the globalist poison
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:11.560]  info wars
[02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:13.560]  strength lies entirely with you
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:15.560]  and the action you take
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:17.560]  you are the info war
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:19.560]  you are the resistance
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:21.560]  and everything you do now will affect
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:23.560]  the battle space for billions of lives
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:25.560]  going to the future
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:27.560]  the war has already begun
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:29.560]  it's an information and spiritual war
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:31.560]  the enemy is losing that war
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:33.560]  so they want to make it a physical war
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:35.560]  so prepare yourselves
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:37.560]  you have been warned
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:39.560]  Leo you want to issue any statements
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:41.560]  about this time we're in
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:43.560]  it's a critical time
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:45.560]  and it's not a coincidence
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:47.560]  on the 31st of July
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:49.560]  a special place went on fire
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:51.560]  and it was actually set on fire
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:53.560]  it was a place
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:55.560]  that was used by that infamous magician
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:49:57.560]  called Alistair Crowley
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:49:59.560]  to evoke those demons
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:01.560]  that will eventually channel through him
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:03.560]  on Loch Ness
[02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:05.560]  and for those of us that are Christians we think of him as an idiot
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:07.560]  a joke but I've been around billionaires
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:09.560]  and globalists they worship Crowley
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:11.560]  they believe he brought the new books
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:13.560]  the new way of Satan
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:15.560]  yes and we are in the critical days
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:17.560]  here of the summer
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:19.560]  known as the dog star days
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:21.560]  connected to Sirius
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:23.560]  which have a very big importance
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:25.560]  for the Satanists
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:27.560]  Sirius for the Satanists is set Satan
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:29.560]  and so
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:31.560]  the Boleskian house
[02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:33.560]  that already went on fire in 2015
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:35.560]  suddenly goes on fire again
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:37.560]  and this time they know
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:39.560]  it's Larsson but they don't know who is behind it
[02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:41.560]  in the meantime
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:43.560]  I have exposed with an article
[02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:45.560]  which is also on info wars
[02:50:45.560 --> 02:50:47.560]  dot com
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:49.560]  that this foundation behind
[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:51.560]  the Boleskian house
[02:50:51.560 --> 02:50:53.560]  this new foundation
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:55.560]  had people from the British intelligence
[02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:57.560]  community involved in it
[02:50:57.560 --> 02:50:59.560]  like Andrew Kerley and Satan is like marching
[02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:01.560]  and let's go further
[02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:03.560]  Jack Parsons, the Jet Propulses Laboratory
[02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:05.560]  that became NASA, all Crowleyites
[02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:07.560]  and there is a TV series
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:09.560]  Alex have you seen that TV series
[02:51:09.560 --> 02:51:11.560]  Strange Angel
[02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:13.560]  because that TV series is for the first time
[02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:15.560]  unveiling
[02:51:15.560 --> 02:51:17.560]  really what went on
[02:51:17.560 --> 02:51:19.560]  and people
[02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:21.560]  they are not even hiding anymore in Hollywood
[02:51:21.560 --> 02:51:23.560]  I haven't seen the TV series
[02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:25.560]  but I saw an ad for it
[02:51:25.560 --> 02:51:27.560]  where they just admitted that Hollywood was founded by Satanist
[02:51:27.560 --> 02:51:29.560]  I went on
[02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:31.560]  and went through it
[02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:33.560]  and I was astonished for the first time
[02:51:33.560 --> 02:51:35.560]  they showed the methods of recruitment
[02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:37.560]  the rituals, what went on
[02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:39.560]  and the whole plan
[02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:41.560]  and they are not even hiding it
[02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:43.560]  they are coming out in the open
[02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:45.560]  and that means that if they are coming out in the open
[02:51:45.560 --> 02:51:47.560]  soon
[02:51:47.560 --> 02:51:49.560]  there is going to be the follow up
[02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:51.560]  which you just talked about unfortunately
[02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:55.560]  How bad is it going to get
[02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:57.560]  because even their lowest level minions
[02:51:57.560 --> 02:51:59.560]  are like attacking Trump supporters
[02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:01.560]  at events and just screaming
[02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:03.560]  and howling like maniacs
[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:05.560]  like they are being empowered
[02:52:05.560 --> 02:52:07.560]  they are all empty husk
[02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:09.560]  but for the first time in their lives
[02:52:09.560 --> 02:52:11.560]  this satanic energy is entering them
[02:52:11.560 --> 02:52:13.560]  and they are like undead zombie hordes
[02:52:13.560 --> 02:52:15.560]  they are trying
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:17.560]  to get Trump
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:19.560]  in a way in their club
[02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:21.560]  they have attempted already
[02:52:21.560 --> 02:52:23.560]  at the last Bilderberg meeting
[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:25.560]  with Pompeo to do that
[02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:27.560]  but they are not
[02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:29.560]  of course successful up until now
[02:52:29.560 --> 02:52:31.560]  and I hope that Trump will resist the temptation
[02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:33.560]  of getting his whole family
[02:52:33.560 --> 02:52:35.560]  in the establishment
[02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:37.560]  him and his family need to stay out of this
[02:52:37.560 --> 02:52:39.560]  New World Order
[02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:41.560]  and this bunch of
[02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:43.560]  people that are basically
[02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:45.560]  following the devil
[02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:47.560]  in his ultimate quest
[02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:49.560]  for presenting then the result of all this
[02:52:49.560 --> 02:52:51.560]  which will be the Antichrist
[02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:53.560]  because let's not forget the follow up
[02:52:53.560 --> 02:52:55.560]  is also the Antichrist
[02:52:55.560 --> 02:52:57.560]  but we all know that when all these things materialize
[02:52:57.560 --> 02:52:59.560]  we have the good side
[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:01.560]  the good side is
[02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:03.560]  to come back
[02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:05.560]  of Jesus
[02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:07.560]  and new Christianity that will of course save
[02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:09.560]  all the true believers
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:11.560]  so we have a positive thing around the corner
[02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:13.560]  that we have a lot of bad things that are going to be
[02:53:13.560 --> 02:53:15.560]  unfortunately happening next
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:17.560]  Leo Zagami, thank you for joining us
[02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:19.560]  LeoZagami.com, God bless you
[02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:21.560]  we look forward to speaking to you again soon
[02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:23.560]  thank you Alex, God bless America
[02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:25.560]  folks can find his books there now
[02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:27.560]  I'm going to do a little bit more of the next hour with Matt Bracken
[02:53:27.560 --> 02:53:29.560]  then we have our next guest taking over
[02:53:29.560 --> 02:53:31.560]  first
[02:53:31.560 --> 02:53:33.560]  I want to play a little four minute piece we played a month ago
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:35.560]  of the last celebrating abortion
[02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:37.560]  and the death of children
[02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:39.560]  they don't care about dead people in a Walmart
[02:53:39.560 --> 02:53:41.560]  they love death, they love hurting our most innocent
[02:53:41.560 --> 02:53:43.560]  they are the Satanist
[02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:45.560]  they are pure evil, here's the report
[02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:47.560]  our main story tonight
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:49.560]  concerns breast implants
[02:53:49.560 --> 02:53:51.560]  some are against them, others believe they're fine
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:53.560]  in rare cases and many believe
[02:53:53.560 --> 02:53:55.560]  you should be able to get them whenever the f*** you want
[02:53:55.560 --> 02:53:57.560]  sorry did I say
[02:53:57.560 --> 02:53:59.560]  breast implants are meant abortions
[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:01.560]  tonight's main topic
[02:54:01.560 --> 02:54:03.560]  concerns abortion
[02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:05.560]  so tonight in honor of America
[02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:07.560]  I'd like to do a salute to abortion
[02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:09.560]  in the Bracken annual
[02:54:09.560 --> 02:54:11.560]  salute to abortion
[02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:15.560]  get out of my behind
[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:17.560]  get out of my vagina
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:19.560]  it's a woman's body and she should not
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:21.560]  be forced to carry anything inside of it
[02:54:21.560 --> 02:54:23.560]  wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:25.560]  that has a heartbeat
[02:54:25.560 --> 02:54:27.560]  are you comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:29.560]  a fetus is a parasite
[02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:35.560]  you think that it is the white man's duty
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:37.560]  to fix everybody's problems
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:39.560]  how many did you adopt?
[02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:41.560]  how many did I adopt? I kill my kids
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:43.560]  well that's what you do to babies huh?
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:45.560]  I love it
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:47.560]  I do
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:49.560]  I hope that you come to Christ
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:51.560]  I hope that you come to Christ
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:53.560]  I don't go to Christ
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:55.560]  you are my baby
[02:54:55.560 --> 02:54:57.560]  are you human being?
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:54:59.560]  because I don't let him come babies
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:01.560]  you let them live so they can starve to death
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:03.560]  d*** you
[02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:05.560]  why'd you spit at us?
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:07.560]  I uh
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:09.560]  don't agree with you
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:11.560]  understand me mother f***er
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:13.560]  in the ninth month you can take the baby
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:15.560]  and rip the baby
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:17.560]  out of the womb of the mother
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:19.560]  just prior to the birth
[02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:21.560]  of the baby
[02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:23.960]  You can say that that's OK.
[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:26.360]  And Hillary can say that that's OK,
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:27.920]  but it's not OK with me.
[02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:30.200]  Well, that is not what happens in these cases.
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:33.480]  And using that kind of scare rhetoric
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:35.400]  is just terribly unfortunate.
[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:38.360]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up the One World Trade
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:41.000]  Center's Spire in Pink to celebrate
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.640]  his erotical expansion of abortion in New York.
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:46.360]  State lawmakers approved a law permitting abortion
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:50.400]  in the state for any reason until a 24th week of pregnancy
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:52.000]  and is then up until birth.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.200]  If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:55.720]  happen.
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:57.720]  The infant would be delivered.
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:00.160]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:02.640]  The infant would be resuscitated if that's
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:05.320]  what the mother and the family desired.
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:08.480]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:09.200]  and the mother.
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:10.320]  There was a question over here.
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:11.640]  Yes.
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:14.760]  Are you for third trimester abortions?
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:17.440]  My answer to you is that that should be a decision
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:18.760]  that the woman makes.
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:20.840]  Yeah.
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:24.360]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:26.080]  are going to be very difficult.
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:28.160]  Is it OK to still have children?
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:31.840]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:35.360]  to rent in this city for free?
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:35.920]  It's your time.
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:36.600]  Next speaker.
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:41.040]  There's a new video out on inforwars.com of two
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:45.480]  partial birth abortions, eight and a half month old babies.
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:48.600]  And it makes you want to kill people.
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:51.120]  I'm just being honest with you right now.
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:55.280]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby who got killed
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:56:58.040]  and its brain sucked out by some asshole.
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:56:59.600]  And then they make a joke out of it.
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:03.840]  These are abortion doctors with third trimester babies
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:06.360]  that were about to be born, defiling them,
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:08.880]  making jokes about them, that they're having a fight.
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:14.920]  They're playing with dead babies in a little medical pan.
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:17.000]  And it was pretty shocking through some stuff
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:20.320]  you see and just the total lack of regard for humanity.
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:22.280]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:26.280]  We're going to have Abby Johnson.
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:27.000]  I'm sorry.
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:30.480]  God bless abortions and God bless America.
[02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:36.800]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:39.360]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:41.280]  You know, you got to get that baby out of there.
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:46.560]  It's about to Marcus in New York.
[02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:47.360]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:47.960]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:48.480]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:51.280]  Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:53.560]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City.
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:56.200]  And one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody
[02:57:56.200 --> 02:57:57.400]  agrees with these wars.
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:57:59.640]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately
[02:57:59.640 --> 02:58:01.960]  to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:04.400]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:06.880]  in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:07.400]  That's it.
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:08.840]  I mean, if Trump buys into this,
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:10.080]  it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:11.640]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated
[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:12.840]  other than assassinating him.
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:14.280]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:58:14.280 --> 02:58:15.120]  I agree entirely.
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:16.680]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:18.360]  is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:20.440]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:23.120]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:25.360]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:28.680]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:30.600]  You've won a lot of battles.
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:33.480]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:34.640]  who are going to continue.
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:36.440]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:38.960]  And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[02:58:38.960 --> 02:58:41.840]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
[02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:43.000]  fired up for liberty.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.240]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:59:13.640 --> 02:59:19.320]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:21.200]  There has never been a more important time
[02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:23.360]  to support Info Wars.
[02:59:23.360 --> 02:59:27.600]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom,
[02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:30.200]  then you can help.

[02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:41.640]  supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door.

[02:59:49.120 --> 02:59:51.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:57.640 --> 03:00:00.800]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:00:00.800 --> 03:00:04.960]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:04.960 --> 03:00:10.160]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here
[03:00:10.160 --> 03:00:11.120]  in this country.
[03:00:11.120 --> 03:00:16.440]  Well, the left is going crazy.
[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:18.600]  And it's just getting crazier.
[03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:22.080]  The author, Stephen King, is calling for Mitch McConnell
[03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:28.840]  to be charged as an accomplice in the attacks in South Texas
[03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:30.640]  and in Ohio.
[03:00:30.640 --> 03:00:32.520]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL best-selling author
[03:00:32.520 --> 03:00:36.000]  and good friend of the show, co-host quite a bit.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:37.320]  I've been so busy the last few days,
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:40.080]  I haven't followed his take on it, but I always respect it.
[03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:43.480]  I got to say, either way, you slice it.
[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:45.120]  Their editing is profiled.
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:46.520]  They're covering it up.
[03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:49.520]  The FBI admits this amount of hype
[03:00:49.520 --> 03:00:51.920]  is going to cause other people to attack.
[03:00:51.920 --> 03:00:53.320]  What's the big takeaway from this?
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:55.840]  Because it seems like the left's making their big move right now,
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:00:58.200]  Matt.
[03:00:58.200 --> 03:01:03.760]  Yeah, the fact that the Ohio shooting happened 13 hours
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:08.200]  after seems really just amazingly significant.
[03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:10.400]  It shows me there are a lot of people out there
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:14.040]  that are just primed, like walking bombs.
[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:17.600]  The Ohio shooter obviously had it in his mind
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:19.520]  because he killed his sister.
[03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:21.840]  That wasn't random, obviously.
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:27.560]  But the fact that what he perceived as a white nationalist
[03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:29.920]  committed the atrocity in El Paso,
[03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:37.800]  I think triggered him to create a Satanist leftist atrocity
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:39.840]  in Ohio.
[03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:41.720]  Obviously, he's very mixed up in his mind.
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:44.360]  He kills his sister and his brother.
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:46.960]  But I have to wonder how many more of these freaks
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:48.280]  are out walking around.
[03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:51.040]  And the Paul Joseph Watson video that's just up
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:52.520]  is really important.
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:56.520]  Taking 810 down, for example, which
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:01:59.200]  would have been a vehicle for the FBI to surveil,
[03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:01.720]  and possibly if they were on the ball,
[03:02:01.720 --> 03:02:07.080]  get ahead of shootings like Parkland or El Paso or Ohio.
[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:10.520]  But when you drive these people completely underground
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:12.720]  so that they're not talking to anybody,
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:15.560]  they're just going to give maybe a 20-minute warning,
[03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:19.000]  post a manifesto, and then go somewhere shooting.
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:22.240]  But I think that the pot is starting to boil over.
[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:23.320]  Well, I agree.
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:24.480]  But I mean, take Facebook.
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:30.760]  The Christ Church attack in New Zealand,
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:32.920]  they didn't take down Facebook because the guy uploaded
[03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:33.880]  the video there.
[03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:37.000]  How is it eight hands fault that the supposedly
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:41.040]  puts a manifesto up on there minutes before he attacks?
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:42.960]  Yeah, and it's so minuscule compared
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:47.280]  to the greater spectrum of social media.
[03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:52.360]  But if anything, eight hand would be a tool for the FBI.
[03:02:52.360 --> 03:02:55.600]  They should have, if a fusion center is looking at anything,
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:57.280]  they should have a rapid response teams
[03:02:57.280 --> 03:03:00.040]  that when somebody posts a manifesto,
[03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:03.920]  they should be able to get slot teams and law enforcement
[03:03:03.920 --> 03:03:06.920]  out in front of these people instead of always being
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:08.520]  an hour late.
[03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:10.200]  In Hawaii, it would just happen that the cops
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:12.240]  were patrolling on the street.
[03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:14.360]  And the man, let's expand on this.
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:16.280]  I don't know about saying this is a false flag yet,
[03:03:16.280 --> 03:03:18.320]  but we know those go on.
[03:03:18.320 --> 03:03:20.840]  The fact that this guy had his social media
[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:23.040]  changed to right winger from left winger
[03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:25.800]  and the whole MO on it and just the whole thing,
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:27.080]  how do we know Antifa isn't going
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:28.560]  to start carrying out attacks?
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:31.760]  Because that's a smart way to demonize the right wing.
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:34.920]  Either carry out attacks or cultivate and trigger
[03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:38.880]  people who are just labile and are like a vessel ready
[03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:40.240]  to be filled.
[03:03:40.240 --> 03:03:42.840]  I wrote a short story called Professor Raoul
[03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:45.680]  X a couple of years ago about how easy it
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:50.960]  is to locate somebody who's mentally and emotionally
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:55.040]  susceptible and then form them into a weapon.
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:59.120]  Then the person who actually is the guide of this human
[03:03:59.120 --> 03:04:02.240]  missile just disappears into the shadows.
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:03.920]  And I don't think that there's anywhere
[03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:07.960]  where there's a federal law enforcement people that
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:10.000]  are saying, hey, let's do this.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:14.840]  What I think is that much lower, like the guy who
[03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:17.800]  went into the Obama White House 100 times,
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:23.160]  who was instigating the fights outside of the Trump rally.
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:26.280]  I think his name was Kramer, but spelled like Kramer.
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:30.280]  These are the kind of guys that arranged and pushed
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:33.720]  the tools forward via a series of cutouts.
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:36.800]  So the people, whoever you're going to see on television,
[03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:38.880]  they're never going to have a memo connecting them
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:39.960]  to anything.
[03:04:39.960 --> 03:04:44.160]  But via a series of cutouts, these mental time bombs
[03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:46.160]  can be weaponized and directed very easily.
[03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:47.760]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:49.960]  And is Trump dumb enough to try to gun
[03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:51.120]  control to appease the left?
[03:04:51.120 --> 03:04:54.120]  That'll do nothing.
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:56.680]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[03:04:56.680 --> 03:04:58.840]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[03:04:58.840 --> 03:05:00.480]  And the way they did so is because they
[03:05:00.480 --> 03:05:02.800]  face no consequence of social, economic, political,
[03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:05.320]  or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[03:05:05.320 --> 03:05:07.680]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges,
[03:05:07.680 --> 03:05:09.920]  the juries, the members of the independent free press
[03:05:09.920 --> 03:05:11.960]  that care about this, the ordinary members of the public
[03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:13.280]  and the audience that care about this
[03:05:13.280 --> 03:05:16.400]  have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:17.400]  to their course of conduct.
[03:05:17.400 --> 03:05:18.840]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:21.240]  And they will become the Big Tech Gola Garcs, the equivalent
[03:05:21.240 --> 03:05:22.840]  to the big trust of the 19th century,
[03:05:22.840 --> 03:05:25.520]  who ran American politics and ran American economy almost
[03:05:25.520 --> 03:05:27.560]  into the ground until we were able to recover
[03:05:27.560 --> 03:05:28.560]  after the Great Depression.
[03:05:28.560 --> 03:05:30.240]  The inforwer's audience is the fuel
[03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:33.480]  that flames the light of liberty across the world
[03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:36.160]  to make real the actions of independent free speech,
[03:05:36.160 --> 03:05:38.720]  to make real the original promise of an independent free
[03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:41.280]  press, real collusion is Big Tech and big media
[03:05:41.280 --> 03:05:43.040]  manipulating and working with each other
[03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:45.680]  to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's
[03:05:45.680 --> 03:05:46.180]  thoughts.
[03:05:46.180 --> 03:05:48.120]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time
[03:05:48.120 --> 03:05:48.760]  it's not happening.
[03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:50.520]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[03:05:50.520 --> 03:05:52.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[03:05:52.400 --> 03:05:55.080]  Even it is what we just saw.
[03:05:55.080 --> 03:06:19.280]  That Rockins, an author, researcher, good friend
[03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:21.200]  of the show, from an ABC Old Smart guy.
[03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:25.560]  And man, I look at these stories.
[03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:28.360]  Ohio shooter was radical leftist who supported Elizabeth
[03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:32.280]  Warren, said he wanted to kill, fascist.
[03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:34.680]  They wanted to go to hell.
[03:06:34.680 --> 03:06:36.920]  AP reports, classmates, Ohio shooter
[03:06:36.920 --> 03:06:39.520]  kept a hit list and a rape list.
[03:06:39.520 --> 03:06:42.440]  So we don't need red flag laws that are outside.
[03:06:42.440 --> 03:06:44.840]  Trump said accelerated due process.
[03:06:44.840 --> 03:06:46.680]  That's an Orwellian term.
[03:06:46.680 --> 03:06:49.200]  We already have the Baker Act and all this stuff
[03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:50.960]  where people feel threatened, even though we
[03:06:50.960 --> 03:06:52.040]  haven't been threatening.
[03:06:52.040 --> 03:06:56.120]  You can be put under psychiatric evaluation for 24 hours.
[03:06:56.120 --> 03:06:58.680]  That's what happened to Kanye West when he supported Trump.
[03:06:58.680 --> 03:07:01.040]  But the red flag laws Democrats want is just, oh,
[03:07:01.040 --> 03:07:02.000]  I don't like that person.
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:02.960]  I'm scared.
[03:07:02.960 --> 03:07:04.200]  And your guns are taken away.
[03:07:04.200 --> 03:07:06.280]  But in almost every case, these people
[03:07:06.280 --> 03:07:09.400]  are very clear about what they're planning.
[03:07:09.400 --> 03:07:12.400]  Yeah, and the red flag laws, a similar thing
[03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:15.320]  happens on social media called brigading.
[03:07:15.320 --> 03:07:17.840]  If a social media site says, all right,
[03:07:17.840 --> 03:07:24.560]  if we get 100 complaints against somebody, 100 objections,
[03:07:24.560 --> 03:07:27.280]  well, then the left just says, hey, let's get 200 people
[03:07:27.280 --> 03:07:29.560]  and put in complaints.
[03:07:29.560 --> 03:07:32.080]  That's what would happen with red flag laws.
[03:07:32.080 --> 03:07:35.400]  They would essentially swat you by brigading you
[03:07:35.400 --> 03:07:37.880]  on social media.
[03:07:37.880 --> 03:07:41.400]  I can see that happening very readily with these accelerated
[03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:43.000]  due process deals.
[03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:44.160]  And they already do this.
[03:07:44.160 --> 03:07:44.880]  They swat people.
[03:07:44.880 --> 03:07:46.440]  They find somebody they don't like,
[03:07:46.440 --> 03:07:49.480]  and they get a burner phone, and they call the swat team
[03:07:49.480 --> 03:07:50.760]  and say, help.
[03:07:50.760 --> 03:07:54.040]  I'm being held in Sam Smith's basement.
[03:07:54.040 --> 03:07:56.640]  He's got pit bulls and AK-47s, and he already
[03:07:56.640 --> 03:07:57.800]  killed my sister.
[03:07:57.800 --> 03:08:02.320]  And the swat team just comes roaring in at ODark 30
[03:08:02.320 --> 03:08:04.520]  to an innocent conservative's house.
[03:08:04.520 --> 03:08:05.320]  This happens.
[03:08:08.120 --> 03:08:11.080]  The left gets more and more deranged all the time.
[03:08:11.080 --> 03:08:12.880]  And they seem to really have seized on this.
[03:08:12.880 --> 03:08:14.000]  This is their moment.
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:15.240]  They did that with the Russia guy.
[03:08:15.240 --> 03:08:16.360]  They did with everything else.
[03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:19.280]  Everything seems different this time.
[03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:22.040]  Yeah, the one thing that's very significant to me,
[03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:26.240]  that the deep state seems to totally be unraveling.
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:28.920]  George Papadopoulos is sort of the touchstone
[03:08:28.920 --> 03:08:33.360]  of all of these intel operations that were run against Trump.
[03:08:33.360 --> 03:08:36.600]  That's right, so it's all coming out, the pedophile rings,
[03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:39.880]  Hillary servers are found, all this huge news is breaking,
[03:08:39.880 --> 03:08:42.280]  and then magically this happens.
[03:08:42.280 --> 03:08:45.920]  And team deep state, like the Andrew McCabe's, the Brennan's,
[03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:48.680]  and the Clappers, they're suddenly back on TV
[03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:52.200]  talking about the shootings to blame this on Trump.
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:54.320]  So you can see it's like a poker game.
[03:08:54.320 --> 03:08:56.560]  Everybody's pushing all in.
[03:08:56.560 --> 03:08:58.680]  And they're using this like a facelift.
[03:08:58.680 --> 03:09:01.720]  Like you said, why do you think that Peter Strock
[03:09:01.720 --> 03:09:04.680]  has been welcomed back to the FBI now a year after being fired
[03:09:04.680 --> 03:09:06.480]  and is now there almost every day?
[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:11.360]  Yeah, this is by no means is it a foregone conclusion
[03:09:11.360 --> 03:09:13.000]  that Trump is gonna win.
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:16.840]  And this is a great smokescreen and cover.
[03:09:16.840 --> 03:09:20.480]  And they'll probably, I'm not saying like directly trigger,
[03:09:20.480 --> 03:09:22.920]  like boom, boom, boom, cause and effect.
[03:09:22.920 --> 03:09:27.640]  But the way that the media is putting heat under the fire,
[03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:31.320]  we can expect more of these, like more shooters for sure.
[03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:33.160]  Oh yeah, the FBI came out today,
[03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:35.160]  the FBI came out actually last night and said,
[03:09:35.160 --> 03:09:38.040]  you're going to have more copycats, look out for those.
[03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:41.280]  And not only shooters, all the shooters work the best
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:43.320]  for the left-wing narrative.
[03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:46.160]  You'll also see things now that I think that big,
[03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:48.760]  one of the biggest mass murders in American history
[03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:52.080]  was in New York at a nightclub with a can of gasoline.
[03:09:52.080 --> 03:09:55.560]  Same thing in Tokyo at that anime cartoon factory
[03:09:55.560 --> 03:09:56.920]  like two weeks ago.
[03:09:56.920 --> 03:10:01.560]  And by the way, there is a Drudge Report siren.
[03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:02.960]  And I kept saying the last three hours,
[03:10:02.960 --> 03:10:03.920]  what is it I'm missing?
[03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:05.320]  What is it I'm not covering?
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:07.080]  It was in our headline today for the live show,
[03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:11.520]  but I just dropped the ball spectacularly until now.
[03:10:11.520 --> 03:10:13.520]  The Dow is down 900 points.
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:15.720]  It's been described by economists as an 11
[03:10:15.720 --> 03:10:17.600]  on a one to 10 Richter scale.
[03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:20.640]  China has absolutely devalued their currency
[03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:23.680]  in an attempt to win their trade war with the United States.
[03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:26.640]  What do you make of this, Matt Brocken?
[03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:30.160]  Yeah, and there could be other pretty humongous things
[03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:33.680]  that happen because there's also, of course,
[03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:37.080]  this currency war in the background with the dollar
[03:10:37.080 --> 03:10:40.920]  losing its status as the global reserve currency.
[03:10:40.920 --> 03:10:43.160]  You could even have something like China announcing
[03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:45.120]  it's going on to a gold standard.
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:47.440]  They've been collecting gold for a long time.
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:49.520]  The Russians have always had a lot of gold.
[03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:51.600]  Brazil has a surprising number of gold.
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:53.040]  It's now down 950.
[03:10:53.040 --> 03:10:53.880]  It's plunging.
[03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:57.480]  Let's pull up MSNBC, CNBC folks.
[03:10:57.480 --> 03:10:59.680]  And let's show it in live time
[03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:01.520]  or the Wall Street Journal Market Watch.
[03:11:01.520 --> 03:11:03.400]  So there it is in live time.
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:05.840]  And again, as you said, they had Goldman Sachs.
[03:11:05.840 --> 03:11:08.400]  They've had JPMorgan badmout the dollar last week.
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:11.120]  And I said they wanna stop the Trumpian Revolution.
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:12.680]  And so it's all a concerted effort.
[03:11:12.680 --> 03:11:14.880]  This thing is completely obvious.
[03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:18.320]  What do you make of China going thermonuclear here?
[03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:19.560]  Very, very arrogant.
[03:11:19.560 --> 03:11:21.720]  They're talking about invading Hong Kong.
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:23.160]  Trump said go easy on China.
[03:11:23.160 --> 03:11:25.240]  I saw that as a act of weakness.
[03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:27.360]  What do you make of all that?
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:31.600]  I could definitely, China has put up these warning videos
[03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:36.600]  showing paratroopers and commandos attacking urban targets.
[03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:40.600]  And essentially warning Hong Kong,
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:42.360]  this is gonna be your fault.
[03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:44.040]  You've gone too far.
[03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:48.420]  You're disrespecting the Chinese Communist flag.
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:52.680]  When we see America, Uncle Sam in peril,
[03:11:52.680 --> 03:11:55.560]  all the other dogs are gonna get in on the dog pile.
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:59.440]  I wouldn't also rule out Iran, firing a missile
[03:11:59.440 --> 03:12:01.880]  or at a refinery, something like that.
[03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:04.320]  Because it's to the advantage of all
[03:12:04.320 --> 03:12:08.800]  of the smaller enemies of America
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:12.480]  to throw bricks into this boiling kettle
[03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:13.840]  while it's boiling over.
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:16.760]  It's like, hey, this is a good time for me
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:19.800]  to ratchet it up a little bit more
[03:12:19.800 --> 03:12:22.200]  and just see if we can shake America loose.
[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:24.600]  And we can be careful.
[03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:27.080]  Because if the veneer of civilization
[03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:29.120]  ever peels away completely,
[03:12:29.120 --> 03:12:30.760]  don't all these leftists and people know
[03:12:30.760 --> 03:12:32.920]  that they are gonna be sitting ducks
[03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:34.880]  and the walking dead for a lot of people
[03:12:34.880 --> 03:12:37.280]  that are really, really angry and upset?
[03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:38.440]  They may or may not.
[03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:40.120]  But no matter how we get there,
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:43.440]  if transportation systems are disrupted in this country,
[03:12:43.440 --> 03:12:45.600]  things go haywire really fast.
[03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:47.160]  And all of our enemies know it.
[03:12:47.160 --> 03:12:49.520]  You don't need to fire a nuclear missile
[03:12:49.520 --> 03:12:51.560]  at an American city to burn it down.
[03:12:51.560 --> 03:12:54.120]  All you've gotta do is cut off its electricity.
[03:12:54.120 --> 03:12:56.240]  Big enough riots will do that.
[03:12:56.240 --> 03:13:00.640]  Hacking the electronic benefit transfer system
[03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:04.840]  and ATMs and credit cards, it would be enough to do it.
[03:13:04.840 --> 03:13:08.800]  So if it comes to a war with China, for example,
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:11.440]  it might not be the Chinese invading Taiwan
[03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:12.960]  and us trying to stop it.
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:16.240]  It'll be China completely hacking our systems,
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:17.360]  blaming it on Iran or North Korea.
[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:18.560]  Sure, well, there's no doubt.
[03:13:18.560 --> 03:13:19.400]  I agree.
[03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:22.280]  There are times when everything comes to a head at one point
[03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:23.640]  and we're entering that season.
[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:25.720]  Matt Brackett, enemiesfarndomestic.com.
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:28.280]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:30.000]  Thank you.
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.520]  Okay, Gerald Solente's coming up and I was gonna leave,
[03:13:32.520 --> 03:13:36.000]  but I saw the 500 points when we started the show.
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:38.680]  It's at 950 right now.
[03:13:38.680 --> 03:13:40.080]  We're gonna follow this as an unfolder
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:42.240]  and come back with Gerald Solente right now.
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:45.120]  But Dow has plunged 950 points.
[03:13:45.120 --> 03:13:46.840]  Looks like the plunge protection team's involved.
[03:13:46.840 --> 03:13:49.640]  It's suddenly just started going back up.
[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:51.960]  China retaliation is 11 on a scale of one to 10.
[03:13:51.960 --> 03:13:56.320]  Wall Street warns, perfect storm for the summer brewing,
[03:13:56.320 --> 03:13:59.400]  for stock correction, as trade war simmers
[03:13:59.400 --> 03:14:01.440]  and more Fed action awaited.
[03:14:01.440 --> 03:14:02.280]  It's all coming up.
[03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:03.800]  Speaking of money, I didn't even plug hardly
[03:14:03.800 --> 03:14:05.040]  in the last three hours.
[03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:07.120]  Without you financially supporting us,
[03:14:07.120 --> 03:14:08.960]  we can't be here to support you.
[03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:10.960]  We've got great coffee, great fish oil,
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:13.480]  great new tropics like Brainforce Plus,
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:15.200]  just any great supplement you can imagine.
[03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:16.880]  We have the best, highest quality
[03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:18.440]  at the lowest prices you're gonna find.
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:21.440]  I can easily put $2 a crap in something and sell it for 20.
[03:14:21.440 --> 03:14:23.600]  A lot of these products have $20, $30 a product
[03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:24.920]  at them if they're 50 bucks.
[03:14:24.920 --> 03:14:27.440]  If they're 30 bucks, they've got $10 a product at them,
[03:14:27.440 --> 03:14:28.400]  then I discount it.
[03:14:29.240 --> 03:14:31.280]  We have the one year anniversary,
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:33.920]  the banniversary of when we were banned last year.
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:37.240]  Tomorrow will be the anniversary,
[03:14:37.240 --> 03:14:39.120]  except for our own platform infowars.com,
[03:14:39.120 --> 03:14:40.680]  our own audio streams, our own video streams
[03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:43.760]  and great analog and digital AM and FM stations.
[03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:45.360]  So it's the one year anniversary of that.
[03:14:45.360 --> 03:14:49.080]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points
[03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:53.160]  and 50 to 60% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:14:53.160 --> 03:14:58.160]  So again, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com
[03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:02.360]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[03:15:02.360 --> 03:15:04.680]  And without your purchases, we will not be here.
[03:15:04.680 --> 03:15:06.360]  Plus these are great products you need.
[03:15:06.360 --> 03:15:09.640]  We're almost sold out of the Chris Pratt inspired
[03:15:09.640 --> 03:15:14.600]  Gadsden flag shirt that says don't tread on me American flag
[03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:16.160]  and so much more.
[03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:19.200]  But that is how we fund this operation.
[03:15:19.200 --> 03:15:21.920]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com
[03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:27.320]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[03:15:27.320 --> 03:15:30.520]  And again, we haven't had sales as big since Christmas,
[03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:32.800]  but normally the summer is the doldrum times
[03:15:32.800 --> 03:15:35.560]  and we've been behind on the funding we need to expand,
[03:15:35.560 --> 03:15:36.520]  much less stay on air.
[03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:39.240]  So please commit today in this incredible time
[03:15:39.240 --> 03:15:41.400]  we're living in to do something that's very simple
[03:15:41.400 --> 03:15:43.480]  but very strong, get great products
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:45.480]  and fund an operation that doesn't back down
[03:15:45.480 --> 03:15:47.080]  the face and tear you at the same time.
[03:15:47.080 --> 03:15:50.560]  Gerald Salente, who's a great market expert
[03:15:50.560 --> 03:15:52.960]  on the economy is coming up right now.
[03:15:53.840 --> 03:15:56.320]  When you have a pain in the neck,
[03:15:56.320 --> 03:15:59.680]  a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs,
[03:15:59.680 --> 03:16:03.240]  you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief
[03:16:03.240 --> 03:16:04.880]  without taking another pill.
[03:16:04.880 --> 03:16:07.840]  Because now Sunny Bay heating wraps and pillows

[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:32.760]  I buy some, I use some, I store some, awesome.

[03:17:54.400 --> 03:17:57.240]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[03:17:57.240 --> 03:17:59.280]  Hundreds of different political systems
[03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:02.160]  and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[03:18:02.160 --> 03:18:05.600]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:07.240]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it,
[03:18:07.240 --> 03:18:08.520]  trying to shut it down.
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:10.120]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:18:10.120 --> 03:18:12.680]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana
[03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:14.760]  and what really works for humanity
[03:18:14.760 --> 03:18:16.720]  and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:18:16.720 --> 03:18:18.600]  And lo and behold, it's super popular
[03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:20.560]  like it's always been.
[03:18:20.560 --> 03:18:22.760]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down
[03:18:22.760 --> 03:18:25.560]  so desperately because we have the light
[03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:28.560]  in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:31.120]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself
[03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:33.200]  and Infowars by buying the great products
[03:18:33.200 --> 03:18:35.480]  at infoarstore.com, by spreading the articles,
[03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:37.520]  by spreading the videos and by praying
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:39.760]  for this operation and for praying for this nation
[03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:42.120]  and the world for peace and discernment.
[03:18:42.120 --> 03:18:44.720]  For myself and the whole Infowars family,
[03:18:44.720 --> 03:18:46.840]  I wanna thank all of you for what you've done
[03:18:46.840 --> 03:18:49.960]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:52.680]  You are the Infowars and I salute you.
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.160]  Before I started working at Infowars,
[03:18:56.160 --> 03:18:59.640]  I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and Infowars.com
[03:18:59.640 --> 03:19:02.240]  but also the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:02.240 --> 03:19:04.160]  And there's one product that's offered
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:07.920]  at Infowarsstore.com that is the elite of the supplements
[03:19:07.920 --> 03:19:09.520]  and that's DNA Force Plus.
[03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:11.840]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this
[03:19:11.840 --> 03:19:13.440]  with some of his special guests,
[03:19:13.440 --> 03:19:17.280]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[03:19:17.280 --> 03:19:18.920]  So I started to look into the science
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:22.320]  and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[03:19:22.320 --> 03:19:25.760]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:27.760]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus
[03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:29.440]  but it's expensive, why?
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:32.240]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[03:19:32.240 --> 03:19:35.080]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up
[03:19:35.080 --> 03:19:37.960]  with competitive supplements for telomere support
[03:19:37.960 --> 03:19:39.560]  and they came and they went
[03:19:39.560 --> 03:19:42.520]  but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[03:19:42.520 --> 03:19:44.160]  It is the elite supplement.
[03:19:44.160 --> 03:19:46.520]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale
[03:19:46.520 --> 03:19:47.920]  because I know it's expensive.
[03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:51.080]  So you should take advantage of 50% off
[03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:54.040]  DNA Force Plus at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:54.040 --> 03:20:00.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:24.040 --> 03:20:31.040]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:42.040 --> 03:20:43.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us
[03:20:43.800 --> 03:20:48.400]  as we broadcast worldwide on this Monday,
[03:20:48.400 --> 03:20:50.480]  August 5th, 2019 broadcast.
[03:20:50.480 --> 03:20:53.360]  I can't think of a better guest to be joining us right now
[03:20:53.360 --> 03:20:55.320]  and co-hosting than Gerald Salente,
[03:20:55.320 --> 03:20:58.520]  best-selling author for 30 years,
[03:20:58.520 --> 03:21:01.960]  top trans forecaster, economist, you name it,
[03:21:01.960 --> 03:21:04.120]  political atheist.
[03:21:04.120 --> 03:21:07.160]  The super rich are selling stocks, buying properties
[03:21:07.160 --> 03:21:10.600]  and keeping cash ready.
[03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:15.080]  Dow plunges 950 points in worst drop in 2019
[03:21:15.080 --> 03:21:18.560]  as losses accelerate into close.
[03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:20.480]  On a scale of 1 to 10, it's 11.
[03:21:20.480 --> 03:21:25.320]  Wall Street reacts to China's retaliation.
[03:21:25.320 --> 03:21:27.040]  This is huge, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:31.760]  That's Bloomberg saying on a scale of 1 to 10, it's an 11.
[03:21:31.760 --> 03:21:34.600]  Gerald Salente joins us right now
[03:21:34.600 --> 03:21:39.960]  to give us his take on how serious this situation is.
[03:21:39.960 --> 03:21:43.400]  Again, for me, China, from what I've researched,
[03:21:43.400 --> 03:21:45.720]  has been giving us one-sided deals for a long time.
[03:21:45.720 --> 03:21:48.880]  We've been massively deindustrialized.
[03:21:48.880 --> 03:21:50.760]  Trump, it looks like, has tried to get a few hundred billion
[03:21:50.760 --> 03:21:54.480]  back a year of the 900 billion of intellectual property
[03:21:54.480 --> 03:21:57.000]  and trade deficit.
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:00.000]  China's threatening to invade Hong Kong, Taiwan.
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:03.120]  We're having confrontations with their ships on a daily basis.
[03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:04.960]  How would you describe the climate right now,
[03:22:04.960 --> 03:22:07.560]  Gerald, as you take over?
[03:22:07.560 --> 03:22:09.320]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[03:22:09.320 --> 03:22:12.440]  And again, thank you for all that you do.
[03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:17.840]  We sent out a notice to subscribers
[03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:21.000]  who's subscriptions have expired, ex-subs.
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:23.320]  This morning, it went out at 7 AM.
[03:22:23.320 --> 03:22:25.760]  I wrote it on Friday.
[03:22:25.760 --> 03:22:30.520]  And we said that, are you ready to lose your business,
[03:22:30.520 --> 03:22:35.520]  your job, your house, because the greatest depression
[03:22:35.520 --> 03:22:37.200]  is on the way.
[03:22:37.200 --> 03:22:38.760]  And about a month and a half ago,
[03:22:38.760 --> 03:22:42.080]  I don't remember the exact date when I was on with David
[03:22:42.080 --> 03:22:46.680]  Knight, I said, prepare for the greatest depression.
[03:22:46.680 --> 03:22:48.880]  This has nothing to do with trade wars.
[03:22:48.880 --> 03:22:52.440]  That's just kind of like a little spark here and there.
[03:22:52.440 --> 03:22:54.840]  One of the ways of forecasting trends
[03:22:54.840 --> 03:22:56.960]  is that current events form future trends.
[03:22:56.960 --> 03:23:01.480]  So what I do each day is I study the news that's
[03:23:01.480 --> 03:23:04.120]  going on and analyze it.
[03:23:04.120 --> 03:23:05.760]  So for example, over the weekend,
[03:23:05.760 --> 03:23:08.160]  when I would love to do other things,
[03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:10.960]  I have to read the Financial Times and other weekend
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:12.520]  newspapers.
[03:23:12.520 --> 03:23:19.600]  India index in worst July for 17 years amid economic woe.
[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:23.400]  Now, India is not doing any trade with China.
[03:23:23.400 --> 03:23:26.840]  We're not doing a lot of trade with India.
[03:23:26.840 --> 03:23:31.120]  This has very little to do with the trade wars.
[03:23:31.120 --> 03:23:34.800]  That's just a line they keep throwing out.
[03:23:34.800 --> 03:23:36.000]  The game is over.
[03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:38.080]  Fight's on.
[03:23:38.080 --> 03:23:41.760]  They've been pumping in monetary methadone into the system
[03:23:41.760 --> 03:23:45.760]  to keep the addicted bull running following
[03:23:45.760 --> 03:23:46.760]  the Great Recession.
[03:23:46.760 --> 03:23:48.720]  Well, Gerald, I'm going to have you take over here.
[03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:50.480]  And I'm not disagreeing with you.
[03:23:50.480 --> 03:23:52.480]  There's a global race of bubbles here.
[03:23:52.480 --> 03:23:53.560]  No one's doubting that.
[03:23:53.560 --> 03:23:56.560]  But China massively devaluing their currency
[03:23:56.560 --> 03:23:58.840]  was a response to the trade war.
[03:23:58.840 --> 03:24:00.440]  And I get it's just more of the same.
[03:24:00.440 --> 03:24:02.400]  The devaluation is accelerating.
[03:24:02.400 --> 03:24:06.080]  So I get in the end game, in the final equation, you're right.
[03:24:06.080 --> 03:24:07.880]  I'm saying currently, though, this
[03:24:07.880 --> 03:24:11.120]  is a pissing match between Trump and the Chinese.
[03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:13.200]  It is that as well.
[03:24:13.200 --> 03:24:16.400]  But they're not devaluing their currency on purpose,
[03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:18.040]  as I see it.
[03:24:18.040 --> 03:24:20.400]  And I'll tell you the reason why.
[03:24:20.400 --> 03:24:26.120]  80% or more of China's GDP is consumer-based.
[03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:28.800]  About 2 thirds of ours is.
[03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:32.280]  That means stuff that they buy they're paying more for.
[03:24:32.280 --> 03:24:35.760]  And they're also concerned about capital outflows.
[03:24:35.760 --> 03:24:37.920]  That's a big one.
[03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:40.840]  That's what happened back in 2015.
[03:24:40.840 --> 03:24:42.480]  That's one of the reasons why you're dead.
[03:24:42.480 --> 03:24:44.800]  Trump wants businesses and their money to leave them.
[03:24:44.800 --> 03:24:47.720]  He's been so successful at cratering them
[03:24:47.720 --> 03:24:49.280]  that now they're having to put this in,
[03:24:49.280 --> 03:24:51.720]  you're saying, to protect themselves.
[03:24:51.720 --> 03:24:53.880]  Yeah, I'm saying they don't want it.
[03:24:53.880 --> 03:24:54.560]  It's happening.
[03:24:54.560 --> 03:24:58.000]  It's being devalued because their economy's going down.
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:24:58.920]  Well, I respect you.
[03:24:58.920 --> 03:24:59.600]  I respect you.
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:02.960]  So do you think Trump has been squeezing them too hard?
[03:25:02.960 --> 03:25:04.320]  No, not at all.
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:05.200]  I don't think he's.
[03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:07.520]  Again, I don't agree with the Trump plan.
[03:25:07.520 --> 03:25:09.720]  To me, it's a very simple plan.
[03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:14.000]  You go back to what was before NAFTA and what it was before China
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:16.680]  came into the World Trade Organization.
[03:25:16.680 --> 03:25:21.200]  When Trump said recently that why are we giving China
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:24.880]  the benefits of being the developed nation under the terms
[03:25:24.880 --> 03:25:26.760]  of the World Trade Organization?
[03:25:26.760 --> 03:25:28.360]  He's 100% right.
[03:25:28.360 --> 03:25:29.840]  They're not a developing nation.
[03:25:29.840 --> 03:25:31.320]  Again, so I respect you.
[03:25:31.320 --> 03:25:34.480]  You were advising people 40 years ago in Congress on the economy.
[03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:36.280]  Talk to me like I'm five years old.
[03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:38.240]  What's really going on?
[03:25:38.240 --> 03:25:42.560]  What's going on is the bubble is bursting.
[03:25:42.560 --> 03:25:46.640]  They're lowering interest rates around the world.
[03:25:46.640 --> 03:25:48.880]  China is dumping dough in.
[03:25:48.880 --> 03:25:51.960]  They have no reserve ratio requirements of banks
[03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:53.720]  that are worth anything.
[03:25:53.720 --> 03:25:58.840]  You have interest rates in Australia at an all-time low.
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:02.720]  In Turkey, they just lowered interest rates 4 and 1 half
[03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:04.160]  percent.
[03:26:04.160 --> 03:26:08.680]  They need, Trump is doing this, by the way, with the China deal
[03:26:08.680 --> 03:26:12.400]  to get the Fed to lower interest rates more.
[03:26:12.400 --> 03:26:16.600]  They have to lower interest rates because they
[03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:18.720]  have to keep pumping cheap money.
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:20.160]  No, I totally agree.
[03:26:20.160 --> 03:26:22.680]  And that's bad, and it abandons physical responsibility.
[03:26:22.680 --> 03:26:25.120]  But aren't we, like you said, already so far gone?
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:27.440]  Trump's just kind of like, I had a friend that
[03:26:27.440 --> 03:26:30.760]  was dying of organ failure because he got sick from a surgery.
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:32.840]  And they were just giving him shots of adrenaline
[03:26:32.840 --> 03:26:35.240]  so his dad, who was driving in from Dallas,
[03:26:35.240 --> 03:26:36.720]  couldn't see him before he died.
[03:26:36.720 --> 03:26:38.400]  His dad got there right after he died.
[03:26:38.400 --> 03:26:40.600]  And they were just, listen, this will keep me alive 20 minutes,
[03:26:40.600 --> 03:26:41.560]  go say bye to him.
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:44.120]  And literally, they were giving him more and more adrenaline
[03:26:44.120 --> 03:26:45.840]  until his arteries collapsed, and he died
[03:26:45.840 --> 03:26:47.280]  as I was looking into his eyes.
[03:26:47.280 --> 03:26:50.240]  One of my best friends, my best friend growing up with Ryan.
[03:26:50.240 --> 03:26:53.400]  And so I think that's kind of almost what you're saying is,
[03:26:53.400 --> 03:26:54.920]  this is just last-ditch efforts,
[03:26:54.920 --> 03:26:57.640]  but they know it's going to go belly up.
[03:26:57.640 --> 03:26:59.120]  You got it.
[03:26:59.120 --> 03:27:01.280]  And very sad about your friend.
[03:27:01.280 --> 03:27:05.200]  And that's, by the way, that's the moral of the whole story,
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:10.640]  is that we have to put more into life of dignity and respect
[03:27:10.640 --> 03:27:12.920]  rather than the sickness that we have now
[03:27:12.920 --> 03:27:15.000]  that's running the world.
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:18.200]  And so that's on the grand scale.
[03:27:18.200 --> 03:27:21.320]  But on the economic scale, games over, fights on.
[03:27:21.320 --> 03:27:23.720]  Look, you get our stuff.
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:28.960]  On June 6th, we sent out a trend alert.
[03:27:28.960 --> 03:27:32.120]  The gold bull run.
[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:37.200]  Gold was $1,332 an ounce.
[03:27:37.200 --> 03:27:42.120]  As we're speaking, it's around $1,465.
[03:27:42.120 --> 03:27:42.920]  No, you're right.
[03:27:42.920 --> 03:27:46.520]  And if this bubble bursts, it's going to go to $5,000.
[03:27:46.520 --> 03:27:51.320]  What I have been saying, I was bearish on gold for five years,
[03:27:51.320 --> 03:27:52.800]  six years.
[03:27:52.800 --> 03:27:54.560]  I changed the forecast.
[03:27:54.560 --> 03:27:58.440]  As you well know, I call the Trump rally two weeks
[03:27:58.440 --> 03:28:01.520]  after he got elected in 2016.
[03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:04.560]  I call it as I forecast it.
[03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:06.920]  We are in the beginning.
[03:28:06.920 --> 03:28:07.960]  And people know it.
[03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:09.640]  They feel it in their pocketbook,
[03:28:09.640 --> 03:28:11.240]  and they feel it in their bones.
[03:28:11.240 --> 03:28:12.360]  I feel it in my bones.
[03:28:12.360 --> 03:28:13.320]  The pressure is on the way.
[03:28:13.320 --> 03:28:14.560]  What is it I'm feeling in my bones?
[03:28:14.560 --> 03:28:16.600]  Because I've been really upset.
[03:28:16.600 --> 03:28:19.200]  You're feeling depression about what's going on.
[03:28:21.680 --> 03:28:24.280]  You're unhappy with it.
[03:28:24.280 --> 03:28:26.120]  Yeah, and then I get mad at the people around me.
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:26.880]  I love all you guys.
[03:28:26.880 --> 03:28:29.280]  I hear you will take over, Gerald.
[03:28:29.280 --> 03:28:31.080]  I hear you have something bad's about to happen.
[03:28:31.080 --> 03:28:32.680]  Stay on as much as you want.
[03:28:32.680 --> 03:28:33.720]  You have any questions?
[03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:34.320]  I love talking to you.
[03:28:34.320 --> 03:28:35.080]  No, I love talking to you.
[03:28:35.080 --> 03:28:36.600]  I've got 100 things to take care of.
[03:28:36.600 --> 03:28:38.000]  But I'll be watching tonight.
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:39.160]  I'll be watching the archive.
[03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:41.080]  And then Owen Troyer is coming up in 30 minutes.
[03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:42.120]  Great job of the crew.
[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:44.840]  Hey, Imple Wars used to stay on the air during all this,
[03:28:44.840 --> 03:28:45.340]  folks.

[03:28:49.980 --> 03:28:50.960]  until we come back.
[03:28:53.760 --> 03:28:56.280]  When you have a pain in the neck,
[03:28:56.280 --> 03:28:59.640]  a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs,
[03:28:59.640 --> 03:29:01.800]  you now have two convenient choices
[03:29:01.800 --> 03:29:04.880]  to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[03:29:54.360 --> 03:29:57.480]  Alex, I got a plug for the Patriot points I get.
[03:29:57.480 --> 03:29:57.840]  Oh, thanks.
[03:29:57.840 --> 03:29:59.520]  I got $180 so far this year.
[03:29:59.520 --> 03:30:01.400]  And I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[03:30:01.400 --> 03:30:03.240]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean,
[03:30:03.240 --> 03:30:04.600]  I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[03:30:04.600 --> 03:30:06.520]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going
[03:30:06.520 --> 03:30:07.800]  to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:09.360]  So I'd rather give that money to you.
[03:30:09.360 --> 03:30:10.560]  And I'm getting quality products.
[03:30:10.560 --> 03:30:13.040]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[03:30:13.040 --> 03:30:15.280]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[03:30:15.280 --> 03:30:16.040]  I've lost weight.
[03:30:16.040 --> 03:30:17.800]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[03:30:17.800 --> 03:30:19.560]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[03:30:19.560 --> 03:30:21.760]  My son used to get these little sore throats.
[03:30:21.760 --> 03:30:23.760]  And he puts X2 in water and drinks it.
[03:30:23.760 --> 03:30:25.160]  And he gets rid of his sore throat.
[03:30:25.160 --> 03:30:26.920]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[03:30:26.920 --> 03:30:28.400]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[03:30:28.400 --> 03:30:29.520]  I want a good price.
[03:30:29.520 --> 03:30:31.360]  But I've kind of obituated everybody
[03:30:31.360 --> 03:30:33.600]  to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[03:30:33.600 --> 03:30:35.840]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[03:30:35.840 --> 03:30:38.480]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil, or the turmeric,
[03:30:38.480 --> 03:30:39.440]  or the bone broth.
[03:30:39.440 --> 03:30:40.440]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[03:30:40.440 --> 03:30:43.040]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points,
[03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:44.640]  a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[03:30:44.640 --> 03:30:47.160]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're
[03:30:47.160 --> 03:30:49.280]  on auto-ship, then we're doing 50% off.
[03:30:49.280 --> 03:30:51.480]  And then you do something like that, where you have Patriot
[03:30:51.480 --> 03:30:52.360]  points, we lose money.
[03:30:52.360 --> 03:30:52.880]  But that's OK.
[03:30:52.880 --> 03:30:55.040]  Thanks for the support.
[03:30:55.040 --> 03:30:56.840]  I talk about this on the air, and I
[03:30:56.840 --> 03:30:57.920]  know it sinks into people.
[03:30:57.920 --> 03:31:00.080]  But I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot
[03:31:00.080 --> 03:31:02.280]  all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years
[03:31:02.280 --> 03:31:04.200]  ago, before all the censorship and attacks
[03:31:04.200 --> 03:31:05.640]  and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[03:31:05.640 --> 03:31:07.520]  I would talk about how great the products are
[03:31:07.520 --> 03:31:09.240]  and how they were the best and why they were.
[03:31:09.240 --> 03:31:10.560]  And I'd have doctors on and experts
[03:31:10.560 --> 03:31:11.800]  to explain why they were so good.
[03:31:11.800 --> 03:31:13.760]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey,
[03:31:13.760 --> 03:31:15.040]  we need to really support us.
[03:31:15.040 --> 03:31:15.920]  Or they'll shut us down.
[03:31:15.920 --> 03:31:17.600]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements,
[03:31:17.600 --> 03:31:19.440]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they
[03:31:19.440 --> 03:31:19.440]  were.
[03:31:19.440 --> 03:31:21.320]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[03:31:21.320 --> 03:31:24.200]  Joan sells unapproved supplements,
[03:31:24.200 --> 03:31:25.560]  and he claims her supplements.
[03:31:25.560 --> 03:31:28.160]  No, under federal law since 1996,
[03:31:28.160 --> 03:31:31.520]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA
[03:31:31.520 --> 03:31:33.560]  because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[03:31:33.560 --> 03:31:36.200]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[03:31:36.200 --> 03:31:38.040]  And all drugs are is the system trying
[03:31:38.040 --> 03:31:40.200]  to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it
[03:31:40.200 --> 03:31:41.120]  and do different things.
[03:31:41.120 --> 03:31:42.320]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[03:31:42.320 --> 03:31:44.200]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature.
[03:31:44.200 --> 03:31:47.360]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine
[03:31:47.360 --> 03:31:47.840]  chest.
[03:31:47.840 --> 03:31:54.240]  Infoorstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:31:54.240 --> 03:31:57.760]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific
[03:31:57.760 --> 03:31:58.400]  dictators.
[03:31:58.400 --> 03:31:59.480]  They are technocrats.
[03:31:59.480 --> 03:32:01.760]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:32:01.760 --> 03:32:03.800]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life
[03:32:03.800 --> 03:32:05.840]  and make your own decisions hits the way
[03:32:05.840 --> 03:32:09.120]  of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:32:09.120 --> 03:32:11.000]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:13.560]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:32:13.560 --> 03:32:16.560]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget
[03:32:16.560 --> 03:32:18.640]  is that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[03:32:18.640 --> 03:32:19.960]  is our bodies.
[03:32:19.960 --> 03:32:22.320]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[03:32:22.320 --> 03:32:25.200]  from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
[03:32:25.200 --> 03:32:28.640]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that
[03:32:28.640 --> 03:32:30.560]  was incredibly high quality Methylcobalamin
[03:32:30.560 --> 03:32:35.120]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[03:32:35.120 --> 03:32:38.360]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality
[03:32:38.360 --> 03:32:41.120]  B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[03:32:41.120 --> 03:32:42.080]  It is amazing.
[03:32:42.080 --> 03:32:45.240]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself
[03:32:45.240 --> 03:32:48.520]  and fund the second American evolution against the tyrants
[03:32:48.520 --> 03:32:57.120]  at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[03:32:57.120 --> 03:33:17.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:22.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:22.600 --> 03:33:30.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[03:33:30.400 --> 03:33:32.320]  Hey, everybody.
[03:33:32.320 --> 03:33:36.080]  What a day to be here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.080 --> 03:33:39.440]  The market's doused down over 800 points.
[03:33:39.440 --> 03:33:43.040]  NASDAQ's down, both of them down over 3%.
[03:33:43.040 --> 03:33:45.200]  Gold price is spiking.
[03:33:45.200 --> 03:33:47.880]  This isn't news to you.
[03:33:47.880 --> 03:33:51.640]  Again, as I mentioned before, when I was on with Alex,
[03:33:51.640 --> 03:33:54.480]  I was on with David Knight about a month and a half ago
[03:33:54.480 --> 03:33:57.920]  and forecast the beginning of the greatest depression.
[03:33:57.920 --> 03:34:01.000]  Again, people feel it in their pocketbook
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:03.080]  and they feel it in their bones.
[03:34:03.080 --> 03:34:03.880]  They're depressed.
[03:34:03.880 --> 03:34:11.920]  Look at the pharmaceutical drugs, the drug pushes there,
[03:34:11.920 --> 03:34:16.600]  big pharma, all these depression drugs.
[03:34:16.600 --> 03:34:18.160]  People feel it.
[03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:21.640]  You're seeing it in a lot of different areas.
[03:34:21.640 --> 03:34:23.960]  You saw the job numbers that came out.
[03:34:23.960 --> 03:34:26.160]  Where were most of the jobs created in the health care
[03:34:26.160 --> 03:34:26.680]  sector?
[03:34:26.680 --> 03:34:27.800]  What do they pay?
[03:34:27.800 --> 03:34:29.760]  Not a lot.
[03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:31.040]  We go over all the data.
[03:34:31.040 --> 03:34:33.240]  You know how the middle class is shrunk so terribly
[03:34:33.240 --> 03:34:36.120]  and all the money's gone to the 1%?
[03:34:36.120 --> 03:34:37.080]  I'm not making that up.
[03:34:37.080 --> 03:34:40.400]  Even the Wall Street Journal did a huge story on it last week
[03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:44.360]  about how bad it is for what used to be called the middle class.
[03:34:44.360 --> 03:34:46.960]  When this thing goes down, it's going to go down like,
[03:34:46.960 --> 03:34:49.640]  we've never seen before.
[03:34:49.640 --> 03:34:55.680]  The debt bubble, probably more like about $280 trillion
[03:34:55.680 --> 03:34:58.040]  worth of global debt.
[03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:01.720]  The last official numbers were about $250 trillion
[03:35:01.720 --> 03:35:03.040]  that I was about a year ago.
[03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:08.480]  This isn't news.
[03:35:08.480 --> 03:35:13.120]  Again, on June 4th, we sent our subscribers a trend alert.
[03:35:13.120 --> 03:35:16.640]  The goal bull run has begun.
[03:35:16.640 --> 03:35:20.760]  I've been saying this now for six years
[03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:25.880]  that gold had a break over $1,385.
[03:35:25.880 --> 03:35:27.240]  And be steady over that.
[03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:31.480]  And the next mark to break through was 1,450.
[03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:35.600]  It's broken through that first mark very solidly.
[03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:38.200]  And now it's breaking through the second mark.
[03:35:38.200 --> 03:35:44.640]  And I said, when it breaks through the second mark of $1,450
[03:35:44.640 --> 03:35:51.080]  an ounce, a sharp rise to the 2,000 levels.
[03:35:51.080 --> 03:35:53.440]  Well, there'll be ups and downs, of course, there will.
[03:35:53.440 --> 03:35:55.360]  I do not give financial advice.
[03:35:55.360 --> 03:35:58.440]  I want to make that 100% clear.
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:36:01.640]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:36:01.640 --> 03:36:08.520]  The downside risk of gold, as I see it now, 1,400 at the worst.
[03:36:08.520 --> 03:36:13.400]  So that's where I see this going.
[03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:17.000]  We were talking before about China devaluing its currency
[03:36:17.000 --> 03:36:20.720]  so they get increased exports.
[03:36:20.720 --> 03:36:22.600]  I don't buy it.
[03:36:22.600 --> 03:36:28.800]  China is very concerned about capital outflows.
[03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:33.360]  It started happening in 2016 when the yuan went down.
[03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:36.000]  Now the yuan's down to a 10-year period.
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:40.080]  Now the yuan went down, now the yuan's down to a 10-year low.
[03:36:40.080 --> 03:36:44.320]  And that's what I put on strict capital control devices
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:47.640]  to stop the money from flowing out of China.
[03:36:47.640 --> 03:36:49.600]  Then China has another problem.
[03:36:49.600 --> 03:36:51.840]  It's called Hong Kong.
[03:36:51.840 --> 03:36:55.160]  Yeah, how nice.
[03:36:55.160 --> 03:36:58.320]  By the way, here's my forecast with Hong Kong.
[03:36:58.320 --> 03:37:02.400]  All these protests are going to be nothing.
[03:37:02.400 --> 03:37:04.880]  The Chinese are going to come in and control the place
[03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:07.000]  and the story.
[03:37:07.000 --> 03:37:12.680]  They got 7 million plus in Hong Kong.
[03:37:12.680 --> 03:37:17.560]  They got 140 billion in China.
[03:37:17.560 --> 03:37:18.520]  Numbers count.
[03:37:22.040 --> 03:37:26.200]  This is what we sent to ex-subscribers this morning.
[03:37:26.200 --> 03:37:29.920]  I was mentioning to Alex.
[03:37:29.920 --> 03:37:37.960]  Are you prepared to lose your business, your job, your home?
[03:37:37.960 --> 03:37:41.600]  Prepare for the greatest depression.
[03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:44.280]  That was the subject line.
[03:37:44.280 --> 03:37:48.640]  This past June, a few days after I forecast the global run,
[03:37:48.640 --> 03:37:52.320]  gold is up over $100 per ounce since then.
[03:37:52.320 --> 03:37:55.840]  Now it's up about $150.
[03:37:55.840 --> 03:37:58.400]  I warn subscribers that the greatest depression
[03:37:58.400 --> 03:38:01.080]  is on the near horizon.
[03:38:01.080 --> 03:38:03.120]  The fallout from the greatest depression
[03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:07.640]  will reverberate far beyond economics.
[03:38:07.640 --> 03:38:13.040]  As the natives grow restless and social unrest intensifies,
[03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:19.400]  quote, when all else fails, they take us to war.
[03:38:19.400 --> 03:38:23.400]  Beyond the trends of increasing military conflict,
[03:38:23.400 --> 03:38:27.760]  the warning signs are flashing, quote, danger ahead.
[03:38:27.760 --> 03:38:31.080]  Among them, the unprecedented global trend
[03:38:31.080 --> 03:38:34.720]  of governments and central banks pumping in heavy doses
[03:38:34.720 --> 03:38:40.360]  of monetary methadone to keep the addicted bull markets running
[03:38:40.360 --> 03:38:44.560]  and failing economies from crashing.
[03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:45.640]  The future is now.
[03:38:45.640 --> 03:38:47.800]  The Trends Journal will show you what will happen,
[03:38:47.800 --> 03:38:49.920]  why it will happen, and provide you
[03:38:49.920 --> 03:38:54.400]  with trend forecast analysis and action plans
[03:38:54.400 --> 03:38:57.240]  that you will not get from any other magazine in the world,
[03:38:57.240 --> 03:39:00.040]  money-back guarantee.
[03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:02.760]  I truly suggest you take action now
[03:39:02.760 --> 03:39:06.400]  and prepare for the worst that is yet to come.
[03:39:06.400 --> 03:39:09.400]  The facts are clear.
[03:39:09.400 --> 03:39:13.160]  Our subscribers who followed my gold bull run forecast
[03:39:13.160 --> 03:39:16.240]  that invested in gold are richly golden.
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:22.520]  I call it like I see it.
[03:39:22.520 --> 03:39:25.880]  Like I said to Alex, I was the first person
[03:39:25.880 --> 03:39:30.760]  to call the Trump rally in November of 2016
[03:39:30.760 --> 03:39:31.640]  when he got elected.
[03:39:34.680 --> 03:39:36.520]  I call them as I see them.
[03:39:39.120 --> 03:39:43.480]  They're going to keep pumping more cheap money into this.
[03:39:43.480 --> 03:39:46.640]  And the sad story that Alex said about his dear friend
[03:39:46.640 --> 03:39:50.600]  passing on as they try to inject more stimulants
[03:39:50.600 --> 03:39:53.800]  into him to keep him alive is the same thing
[03:39:53.800 --> 03:39:56.040]  with the addicted bull.
[03:39:56.040 --> 03:39:59.280]  It's been pumped up with cheap money, nothing else.
[03:39:59.280 --> 03:40:01.000]  There's no such thing in the world
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:05.160]  as zero and negative interest rate policy.
[03:40:05.160 --> 03:40:07.600]  There's no such thing as quantitative easing.
[03:40:07.600 --> 03:40:10.640]  They made all this stuff up.
[03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:12.880]  It didn't teach me that in economics 101
[03:40:12.880 --> 03:40:15.440]  of graduate school.
[03:40:15.440 --> 03:40:21.360]  You're looking at 30-year bond yields, 30-year bond yields,
[03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:25.080]  now in negative territory.
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:29.920]  Who in their right mind would buy a bond that's
[03:40:29.920 --> 03:40:35.800]  going to pay you back less than what you bought it for?
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:37.360]  It's a government scam.
[03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:40.320]  The governments are buying 10-year and 30-year bond
[03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:43.680]  yields, corporate and government,
[03:40:43.680 --> 03:40:50.280]  to keep this failing economy going forward.
[03:40:50.280 --> 03:40:52.200]  The Plunge Protection Team, that's
[03:40:52.200 --> 03:40:58.160]  scammed to keep the markets going,
[03:40:58.160 --> 03:40:59.680]  they're going to pump it back up.
[03:40:59.680 --> 03:41:01.360]  No question about it.
[03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:02.520]  How long will it last?
[03:41:02.520 --> 03:41:03.680]  Will it last?
[03:41:03.680 --> 03:41:04.600]  Time will tell.
[03:41:07.360 --> 03:41:11.600]  I'm on this show a lot, and I rarely
[03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:13.880]  promote my magazine, The Trends Journal.
[03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:20.960]  I promote the products from Info Wars,
[03:41:20.960 --> 03:41:23.960]  like my super mail vitality.
[03:41:23.960 --> 03:41:26.680]  Yes, yes.
[03:41:26.680 --> 03:41:33.200]  So tune in the news today after the markets close
[03:41:33.200 --> 03:41:36.040]  and find out what happened.
[03:41:36.040 --> 03:41:40.680]  Or you can subscribe to The Trends Journal
[03:41:40.680 --> 03:41:43.640]  and find out what's going to happen
[03:41:43.640 --> 03:41:47.600]  to read tomorrow's news today history before it happens.
[03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:49.640]  This is a serious time.
[03:41:49.640 --> 03:41:51.960]  You know one of my sayings.

[03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:16.960]  they take you to war.
[03:42:16.960 --> 03:42:19.840]  To the jack and Jill on the street.
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:22.760]  That'll do anything to cheat, to make ends meet.

[03:47:21.640 --> 03:47:24.880]  Hey, great being here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.880 --> 03:47:26.840]  And you know, what about a topic that you
[03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:29.840]  want to know, Alex Jones Show, and you know,
[03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:36.120]  one of our top trends for 2019 was censorship, 2019.
[03:47:36.120 --> 03:47:37.960]  So you're getting from Alex Jones Show,
[03:47:37.960 --> 03:47:41.320]  you get from Alan Magazine and a few others of us,
[03:47:41.320 --> 03:47:45.680]  or Insights Information, Forecasts, and Analysis
[03:47:45.680 --> 03:47:47.520]  that you won't find anywhere else.
[03:47:47.520 --> 03:47:49.320]  And they don't want that.
[03:47:49.320 --> 03:47:55.400]  As I said, tune into the news if you want to know what happened.
[03:47:55.400 --> 03:47:58.720]  Alex Jones, if you want to know what's going to happen.
[03:47:58.720 --> 03:48:04.840]  So this is the first anniversary, the annual, I should say,
[03:48:04.840 --> 03:48:11.320]  banniversary, store-wide sale with 50% to 60% off Infowars
[03:48:11.320 --> 03:48:15.840]  Life, free shipping, double-patriot points.
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:20.160]  Banniversary, how disgusting it all has become.
[03:48:20.160 --> 03:48:23.320]  That we got little clowns, morons, cowards, freaks,
[03:48:23.320 --> 03:48:26.280]  and fools telling us what we should know and not know,
[03:48:26.280 --> 03:48:30.280]  who we should listen to, and who we should believe.
[03:48:30.280 --> 03:48:32.960]  Like those conspiracy theorists.
[03:48:32.960 --> 03:48:35.120]  I'm going to tell you that guy, Saddam Hussein,
[03:48:35.120 --> 03:48:38.000]  has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:41.960]  And all you little prostitutes are going to repeat it.
[03:48:41.960 --> 03:48:44.960]  You know those Iranians, they sabotaged all those ships
[03:48:44.960 --> 03:48:46.040]  a couple of months ago.
[03:48:46.040 --> 03:48:49.360]  We don't have any proof, but we're going to say it anyway.
[03:48:49.360 --> 03:48:51.880]  You'll call that a conspiracy theory, wouldn't you?
[03:48:51.880 --> 03:48:53.680]  Well, not if the government says it,
[03:48:53.680 --> 03:48:56.040]  only if people like myself, Alex Jones, or others,
[03:48:56.040 --> 03:48:57.960]  say things that they don't want us to say
[03:48:57.960 --> 03:49:00.920]  because they don't want the people to hear.
[03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:04.240]  So it's the one-year anniversary of Alex Jones
[03:49:04.240 --> 03:49:07.720]  and Infowars de-platforming.
[03:49:07.720 --> 03:49:10.600]  More than ever, the First and Second Amendment
[03:49:10.600 --> 03:49:12.520]  must be defended.
[03:49:12.520 --> 03:49:17.440]  With an unprecedented 50% to 60% off Infowars Life,
[03:49:17.440 --> 03:49:20.600]  free shipping, and double-patriot points,
[03:49:20.600 --> 03:49:25.240]  it's the perfect opportunity for a 360 win.
[03:49:25.240 --> 03:49:27.000]  So they got a load of products out there
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:30.760]  that run sale DNA, forced plus for 50% off,
[03:49:30.760 --> 03:49:34.400]  survival shield X2, one after another.
[03:49:34.400 --> 03:49:40.240]  And of course, my favorite, supermail, vitality.
[03:49:40.240 --> 03:49:46.360]  So do what you need to do to keep the truth coming
[03:49:46.360 --> 03:49:51.120]  because it's going to turn ugly out there.
[03:49:51.120 --> 03:49:56.520]  And remember, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:49:56.520 --> 03:49:57.920]  You know what happened over the weekend
[03:49:57.920 --> 03:50:02.480]  with the horrors in Texas?
[03:50:02.480 --> 03:50:08.920]  El Paso in Dayton, Ohio, mentally disturbed people.
[03:50:08.920 --> 03:50:10.080]  Who are you going to blame it on?
[03:50:10.080 --> 03:50:12.840]  Everybody's blaming it on somebody else.
[03:50:12.840 --> 03:50:16.560]  Here's who I blame it on.
[03:50:16.560 --> 03:50:21.640]  You know, I don't like this guy down the street.
[03:50:21.640 --> 03:50:25.640]  I don't like the way he treats his family.
[03:50:25.640 --> 03:50:28.880]  I don't like what he stands for.
[03:50:28.880 --> 03:50:32.520]  I want to get rid of this guy.
[03:50:32.520 --> 03:50:38.840]  Give me some money and some guns so I could go kill him.
[03:50:38.840 --> 03:50:42.320]  If you gave me money or guns to kill him,
[03:50:42.320 --> 03:50:45.760]  you'd be an accessory to the crime.
[03:50:45.760 --> 03:50:48.840]  And you would say that I was insane.
[03:50:48.840 --> 03:50:51.360]  Of course, of course, you wouldn't give me money, right?
[03:50:54.520 --> 03:50:56.760]  Here's another one.
[03:50:56.760 --> 03:51:00.440]  You know, I don't like that guy, Gaddafi.
[03:51:00.440 --> 03:51:04.400]  I don't like what he's doing to his people.
[03:51:04.400 --> 03:51:07.280]  I want to get rid of him.
[03:51:07.280 --> 03:51:08.240]  He got a gun.
[03:51:08.240 --> 03:51:20.240]  What's different than the mentally deranged Obama
[03:51:20.240 --> 03:51:24.880]  destroying and killing people throughout Syria
[03:51:24.880 --> 03:51:29.720]  to overthrow the government than any of these two sick
[03:51:29.720 --> 03:51:37.440]  individuals that slaughtered the people in Dayton, Ohio.
[03:51:37.440 --> 03:51:38.840]  El Paso, Texas.
[03:51:38.840 --> 03:51:40.680]  You know, I don't like that guy Assad.
[03:51:40.680 --> 03:51:43.240]  I want to get him out of here.
[03:51:43.240 --> 03:51:45.240]  Go do the job.
[03:51:45.240 --> 03:51:47.440]  Hide his killers.
[03:51:47.440 --> 03:51:50.480]  Yeah, he's ISIS guy.
[03:51:50.480 --> 03:51:51.880]  He's mass murderers.
[03:51:51.880 --> 03:51:53.520]  I want to overthrow that country.
[03:51:53.520 --> 03:51:54.840]  I want him out of there.
[03:51:57.840 --> 03:52:07.080]  What makes the murderer Obama any different than the murderer?
[03:52:07.080 --> 03:52:10.560]  You know, El Paso, Texas, with Dayton, Ohio.
[03:52:10.560 --> 03:52:13.800]  That Assad is gone.
[03:52:13.800 --> 03:52:16.200]  He's not gone yet, but we got rid of Gaddafi.
[03:52:16.200 --> 03:52:18.480]  And you know that guy who's saying,
[03:52:18.480 --> 03:52:20.080]  I don't like what he's doing.
[03:52:20.080 --> 03:52:20.640]  You know what?
[03:52:20.640 --> 03:52:22.720]  I'm worried about him.
[03:52:22.720 --> 03:52:23.920]  He could get some weapons.
[03:52:23.920 --> 03:52:25.000]  It is going to be dangerous.
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:27.560]  Get rid of him.
[03:52:27.560 --> 03:52:28.840]  I'll make up lies.
[03:52:28.840 --> 03:52:31.120]  I don't give a damn.
[03:52:31.120 --> 03:52:33.400]  Get rid of him.
[03:52:33.400 --> 03:52:35.520]  Yeah, send our troops.
[03:52:35.520 --> 03:52:38.080]  I don't count when he get killed.
[03:52:38.080 --> 03:52:41.240]  Overthrow the country.
[03:52:41.240 --> 03:52:47.760]  What makes those two guys from El Paso, Texas,
[03:52:47.760 --> 03:52:52.640]  to Dayton, Ohio any different than the sixth son of a bitch
[03:52:52.640 --> 03:52:56.000]  to mentally impaired George, the murderer,
[03:52:56.000 --> 03:52:58.240]  slimy little boy, Bush?
[03:52:58.240 --> 03:53:02.760]  And I'll call you that to your face, Junior.
[03:53:02.760 --> 03:53:05.320]  Yep, come over to Kingston.
[03:53:05.320 --> 03:53:07.000]  Most historic four corners in America,
[03:53:07.000 --> 03:53:09.080]  where the seeds of democracy was sown,
[03:53:09.080 --> 03:53:13.800]  and the founding fathers, well, Alex used the word before,
[03:53:13.800 --> 03:53:17.360]  pissed off, they pissed on you.
[03:53:17.360 --> 03:53:20.520]  Get this little boy out of here, they would say.
[03:53:20.520 --> 03:53:23.840]  How about murder of Bill Clinton?
[03:53:23.840 --> 03:53:27.800]  Every time he got caught with his pants down,
[03:53:27.800 --> 03:53:30.840]  or as you know what, where it shouldn't have been,
[03:53:30.840 --> 03:53:34.560]  bombs away over Iraq, that no flying zone,
[03:53:34.560 --> 03:53:37.800]  killed over 500,000 kids under the age of five
[03:53:37.800 --> 03:53:40.960]  with his sanctions against Iraq.
[03:53:40.960 --> 03:53:45.880]  You know, Madeleine, not all that bright.
[03:53:45.880 --> 03:53:48.720]  On Leslie Stahl, Leslie Stahl asked her when she was
[03:53:48.720 --> 03:53:50.240]  the ambassador of the United States,
[03:53:50.240 --> 03:53:53.080]  is the price of 500,000 Iraqi children?
[03:53:53.080 --> 03:53:56.760]  Under the age of five, were it the sanctions?
[03:53:56.760 --> 03:53:59.480]  Yes, it is said, arrogant, all bright.
[03:53:59.480 --> 03:54:01.640]  Totally women's were in charge.
[03:54:01.640 --> 03:54:05.480]  Black, white, male, female, gender doesn't make a difference.
[03:54:05.480 --> 03:54:08.680]  Creed color, couldn't bear to come in all of them.
[03:54:08.680 --> 03:54:11.640]  Everybody could say they're baloney for somebody else.
[03:54:11.640 --> 03:54:14.880]  What makes those two murderers?
[03:54:18.200 --> 03:54:21.480]  In Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas,
[03:54:21.480 --> 03:54:24.880]  any different than Bill Clinton, Madeleine, or bright?
[03:54:24.880 --> 03:54:28.600]  Susan Rice, Condoleezza Rice, Hillary Clinton,
[03:54:28.600 --> 03:54:32.120]  Penis Cheney, Wolfischitz and all the others.
[03:54:33.600 --> 03:54:38.600]  Rumsel, all the liars, all the people calling for murder,
[03:54:39.320 --> 03:54:43.120]  all the people calling for murder,
[03:54:43.120 --> 03:54:45.960]  murder in the first degree.
[03:54:45.960 --> 03:54:48.240]  What makes them any different than the murderers
[03:54:48.240 --> 03:54:50.240]  that are sick out of their mind,
[03:54:50.240 --> 03:54:52.080]  that kill those innocent people,
[03:54:52.080 --> 03:54:56.320]  as the United States stole trillions of our dollars
[03:54:56.320 --> 03:55:00.160]  to kill millions of people, and by the way,
[03:55:00.160 --> 03:55:02.640]  that's why I launched Occupy Peace,
[03:55:02.640 --> 03:55:07.640]  and I'm thinking of launching on this coming September 21st,
[03:55:08.360 --> 03:55:12.120]  International Peace Day and Occupy Peace Party
[03:55:12.120 --> 03:55:13.920]  up here in Colonial Kingston,
[03:55:13.920 --> 03:55:16.440]  we're putting it together, anybody that wants to help,
[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:20.360]  you could go to my website, go to Occupy Peace, rather,
[03:55:20.360 --> 03:55:23.360]  Occupy Peace website, and do all you can
[03:55:23.360 --> 03:55:25.840]  to help us push this piece forward,
[03:55:25.840 --> 03:55:29.200]  because as all else fails, they take you to war,
[03:55:29.200 --> 03:55:32.040]  not only our government, all over the world.
[03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:34.520]  Watch what's going on with Hong Kong.
[03:55:35.840 --> 03:55:36.840]  You know what?
[03:55:37.840 --> 03:55:39.880]  You're gonna start seeing a lot of people
[03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:42.400]  with a lot of dough leaving Hong Kong.
[03:55:43.720 --> 03:55:47.600]  That's right, because they know what's gonna come down.
[03:55:47.600 --> 03:55:48.440]  Fuck!
[03:55:49.680 --> 03:55:52.600]  And that sledgehammer of communism
[03:55:52.600 --> 03:55:55.120]  is gonna crash through them.
[03:55:55.120 --> 03:55:58.600]  Oh yeah, remember how they told us to hate those commies?
[03:55:58.600 --> 03:56:03.600]  Vietnam War, Cold War, can't trust those commies,
[03:56:03.840 --> 03:56:05.080]  but we could do business with them,
[03:56:05.080 --> 03:56:06.800]  because we'll take our manufacturing,
[03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:09.800]  give them all our technology, all our information,
[03:56:09.800 --> 03:56:11.800]  get the products made from slave labor people,
[03:56:11.800 --> 03:56:13.520]  bring it back and make a lot of money.
[03:56:13.520 --> 03:56:18.200]  Commies are okay, hey, you know why our trade deficit
[03:56:18.200 --> 03:56:20.280]  with China's going down a bit?
[03:56:20.280 --> 03:56:22.160]  Because it's going way up with Vietnam.
[03:56:22.160 --> 03:56:25.200]  All those commies, you remember the Liars,
[03:56:25.200 --> 03:56:29.320]  the Freaks, the Johnsons and all of the others
[03:56:29.320 --> 03:56:34.320]  that got 58,000 of our guys my age killed,
[03:56:34.600 --> 03:56:37.200]  250,000 wounded, destroyed the country,
[03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:38.600]  killed over three and a half million.
[03:56:38.600 --> 03:56:41.120]  Hey, but now we're doing business with that commie country.
[03:56:41.120 --> 03:56:41.960]  It's okay.
[03:56:41.960 --> 03:56:46.680]  What makes those sick people that destroyed the lives
[03:56:46.680 --> 03:56:50.040]  of so many in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas,
[03:56:50.040 --> 03:56:53.240]  any different than Lyndon Baines Johnson,
[03:56:53.240 --> 03:56:55.640]  Harry Truman or all the other murderers
[03:56:55.640 --> 03:56:57.600]  connected with them?
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:56:59.720]  To me, nothing.
[03:56:59.720 --> 03:57:02.760]  Nothing is going to change until we occupy peace
[03:57:02.760 --> 03:57:04.640]  and we'd better do it now.
[03:57:04.640 --> 03:57:07.040]  We have to stop wasting money on the military
[03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:08.680]  and start building our economy.
[03:57:08.680 --> 03:57:10.400]  It's our only way out.
[03:57:12.280 --> 03:57:14.480]  As I see it, and you know the motto
[03:57:14.480 --> 03:57:17.680]  of the Trends Journal, think for yourself.
[03:57:17.680 --> 03:57:22.680]  And remember, today is the one year anniversary
[03:57:23.080 --> 03:57:25.640]  of Alex Jones' and Info Wars deep platforming.
[03:57:26.720 --> 03:57:30.480]  Anniversary, do everything you can to support them.
[03:57:30.480 --> 03:57:34.160]  Keep the truth alive and keep speaking out
[03:57:34.160 --> 03:57:37.760]  and doing the best you can to society and yourself.
[03:57:38.680 --> 03:57:39.680]  See you next week.
[03:57:43.200 --> 03:57:46.920]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit,
[03:57:46.920 --> 03:57:49.160]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[03:57:49.160 --> 03:57:50.720]  And so it used to, it wasn't that important
[03:57:50.720 --> 03:57:53.320]  to wear the American flag because we still loved
[03:57:53.320 --> 03:57:55.000]  our country and there wasn't a large group
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:57:56.400]  of people that actually hated it.
[03:57:56.400 --> 03:57:59.400]  But now they're trying to take it out of schools.
[03:57:59.400 --> 03:58:01.520]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[03:58:01.520 --> 03:58:03.560]  Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal
[03:58:03.560 --> 03:58:05.160]  are pulling down American flags
[03:58:05.160 --> 03:58:07.080]  and running up Mexican flags.
[03:58:07.080 --> 03:58:10.000]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing.
[03:58:10.000 --> 03:58:12.200]  So now it is a revolutionary act in the time
[03:58:12.200 --> 03:58:14.680]  of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[03:58:14.680 --> 03:58:18.200]  to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross
[03:58:18.200 --> 03:58:19.560]  anti-slavery flag.
[03:58:19.560 --> 03:58:21.960]  And particularly when it says on the back,
[03:58:21.960 --> 03:58:23.480]  right there ladies and gentlemen,
[03:58:23.480 --> 03:58:26.080]  America's back in FullWars.com.
[03:58:26.080 --> 03:58:28.440]  So whatever you do, take action today
[03:58:28.440 --> 03:58:31.280]  and exercise your free speech in these bullies' face.
[03:58:31.280 --> 03:58:33.440]  All over, not just the U.S. but worldwide
[03:58:33.440 --> 03:58:34.280]  because more than ever,
[03:58:34.280 --> 03:58:37.160]  the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[03:58:37.160 --> 03:58:47.960]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom,
[03:58:47.960 --> 03:58:52.480]  we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage.
[03:58:52.480 --> 03:58:55.160]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories
[03:58:55.160 --> 03:58:58.640]  ever told, the story of America.
[03:58:58.640 --> 03:59:01.600]  It is the epic tale of a great nation
[03:59:01.600 --> 03:59:03.560]  whose people have risked everything
[03:59:03.560 --> 03:59:05.680]  for what they know is right
[03:59:05.680 --> 03:59:08.440]  and what they know is true.
[03:59:08.440 --> 03:59:11.400]  As long as we stay true to our cause,
[03:59:11.400 --> 03:59:14.280]  as long as we remember our great history,
[03:59:14.280 --> 03:59:19.360]  as long as we never, ever stop fighting for a better future,
[03:59:19.360 --> 03:59:24.080]  then there will be nothing that America cannot do.
[03:59:24.080 --> 03:59:26.560]  In FullWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[03:59:26.560 --> 03:59:29.360]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[03:59:29.360 --> 03:59:30.640]  Full power!
[03:59:30.640 --> 03:59:51.800]  Damn the torpedoes, go straight at them!
