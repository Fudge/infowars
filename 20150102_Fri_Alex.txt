[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.800 --> 00:21.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.560 --> 00:30.960]  well the Obama's diner the restaurant charging $500,000 for a membership
[00:30.960 --> 00:43.040]  $295 pre-fix menu that dovetails with these little jewels we have here today
[00:43.040 --> 00:52.200]  Obamacare finds rising in 2015 IRS prepares to collect it was of course in
[00:52.200 --> 00:55.960]  the bill the IRS would collect and take your tax refunds and grab your bank
[00:55.960 --> 01:00.760]  accounts but they would just have people go on MSNBC and CNN and say it's a
[01:00.760 --> 01:05.360]  hoax there are no death panels it doesn't increase prices you can keep your
[01:05.360 --> 01:11.800]  doctor cabler elves are real unicorns are real well now it's kicking in for the
[01:11.800 --> 01:18.320]  mass of the public so enjoy we're gonna be going over that today but see you'll
[01:18.320 --> 01:22.200]  be all by yourself though just talking to your neighbor when you get your
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.360]  insurance doubled or tripled or they come in and fine you or whatever the
[01:26.360 --> 01:32.080]  case is it'll just be wait Obama lied to me and it's like yeah too late suckers
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.600]  Obamacare finds a rising in 2015 as the IRS prepares to collect and there's
[01:37.600 --> 01:41.920]  another story that one's out of Fox News the Washington Times Obamacare
[01:41.920 --> 01:47.080]  employer mandate kicks in kicked in yesterday January 1st we're gonna be
[01:47.080 --> 01:52.320]  looking at some of that today that's just one of the little stacks Harry Reid
[01:52.320 --> 01:57.760]  broke his face that's the headline in an exercise accident he's probably
[01:57.760 --> 02:01.720]  practicing sneaking through windows at night as an osforatu probably actually
[02:01.720 --> 02:05.520]  thought of a window climbing up to steal a baby I'm being sarcastic before
[02:05.520 --> 02:09.480]  before the New York Times picks up on that he actually just sucks the blood of
[02:09.480 --> 02:15.280]  our children's future through through the Senate but the top senator 75 breaks
[02:15.280 --> 02:22.000]  ribs and face an exercise accident is falling off a treadmill and seriously
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.480]  good news though is a new poll shows tepid GOP support for Boehner enroll the
[02:27.480 --> 02:34.800]  speaker as they prepare for a big budget war looming that is all coming up on
[02:34.800 --> 02:39.600]  that front I will get into the health and science news today the economic news
[02:39.600 --> 02:45.680]  is very interesting a lot of world news but on the economic front Chinese
[02:45.680 --> 02:51.200]  economy set to miss growth target for the first time since Asian financial
[02:51.200 --> 02:56.480]  crises that ties into Japan's demographic cliff they just had with their
[02:56.480 --> 03:02.440]  population declining in their new census we've also got the disgusting news of
[03:02.440 --> 03:08.080]  with an eye of 2016 Jeb Bush resigns from all boards Rubio says he will run for
[03:08.080 --> 03:13.240]  president whether whether the GOP says that everyone should stand down for Jeb
[03:13.240 --> 03:23.040]  of the Rhino blue blood country club Rockefeller Republican set who want our
[03:23.040 --> 03:30.200]  guns who want open borders I mean holy Toledo with Republicans like this who
[03:30.200 --> 03:34.600]  needs Hillary Clinton and that's how they fix this Don King horse race this
[03:34.600 --> 03:39.600]  Don King boxing match is you've got the bushes that groomed and created the
[03:39.600 --> 03:47.760]  Clintons running against the Clintons and Hillary is so hated and reviled that
[03:47.760 --> 03:52.800]  even playing the stupid card that she's a woman isn't gonna work to vote for her
[03:52.800 --> 03:58.880]  here against women it will put Jeb Bush King George III he should change his
[03:58.880 --> 04:12.000]  name to George if he could be King George III is there no end to this Paul
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.760]  Watson's joining us at the bottom of the hour terrifying Scottish police to
[04:15.760 --> 04:21.200]  investigate offensive remarks if you say that that person is fat and they hear
[04:21.200 --> 04:25.960]  you say it you will be arrested by the way there is no law really stating this
[04:25.960 --> 04:30.560]  but in England they have secret police that sit in the coffee shops in places
[04:30.560 --> 04:34.960]  listening for any type of racial comments and you're arrested it's all
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.320]  part of the intimidation and the model you see in Europe in the UK is now
[04:39.320 --> 04:44.320]  coming here we're gonna break that down a very important article by Christina
[04:44.320 --> 04:47.760]  Sarich who just does amazing stories this story should go viral geo
[04:47.760 --> 04:51.480]  engineering scientists don't want to get them on terrified of projects he helped
[04:51.480 --> 04:56.400]  create a real window into chemtrailing coming up stay with us it's a big
[04:56.400 --> 05:02.840]  transmission the government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up

[08:25.000 --> 08:32.120]  first live transmission for the info wars operation in 2015 it is now
[08:32.120 --> 08:41.320]  friday the second day of january 2015 blink your eye or look at the twinkle in
[08:41.320 --> 08:54.920]  your damsel's eye and it will be 2016 2020 2025 2030 2040 20 100 and beyond
[08:54.920 --> 09:01.920]  Chuck Norris the only man who counted to infinity twice I was thinking about all
[09:01.920 --> 09:04.960]  the cool interviews we've done over the years of people because we reared
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.200]  yesterday just a small snippet of them and definitely got a dredge up some of
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.800]  the Chuck Norris interviews and kind of have a really cool second amendment show
[09:13.800 --> 09:18.440]  with our second amendment guess we've had on that's a side issue I just thought
[09:18.440 --> 09:23.960]  I would throw out the silly silly quote about Chuck Norris you know when
[09:23.960 --> 09:30.600]  Chuck Norris bench presses or does push-ups that the earth moves not him
[09:30.600 --> 09:36.040]  okay now I'm getting really silly and I don't know why I went there hey but the
[09:36.040 --> 09:40.920]  new Pew research has come out and shown that Americans compared to any other
[09:40.920 --> 09:46.080]  country in the world that is industrialized and quote wealthy are the
[09:46.080 --> 09:53.040]  most upbeat Pew research says and also Pew research says that our economy is
[09:53.040 --> 09:59.280]  doing great and that everything is awesome when you're part of a team
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.840]  people on average are probably happier despite a lot of the sociological
[10:04.840 --> 10:10.200]  tyranny we're under because they're not aware of how they're losing their
[10:10.200 --> 10:19.080]  humanity they are distracted they are diverted by scientific systems that were
[10:19.080 --> 10:28.040]  formulated to keep us in a very spectator like position of suspended
[10:28.040 --> 10:36.720]  disbelief living in a matrix like fantasy land so we're losing our real
[10:36.720 --> 10:44.280]  health and we're losing our higher brain waves on average we are having our
[10:44.280 --> 10:50.600]  consciousness doled that's in every major spectrum study out there we are
[10:50.600 --> 10:55.000]  losing our families we are losing our wealth we are losing our savings we are
[10:55.000 --> 11:03.160]  losing our sovereignty but we are entertained just as Rome as it declined
[11:03.160 --> 11:10.240]  became more and more a spectator based game based gladiatorial based lottery
[11:10.240 --> 11:23.920]  based gambling based fraudulent system based bamboozle system we too are
[11:23.920 --> 11:30.480]  following that gulag casino model that max keiser talks about but that is
[11:30.480 --> 11:36.480]  coming up chart Americans are in unusually good mood all the time well
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.200]  there's enough serotonin re uptake inhibitor in every major municipal water
[11:41.200 --> 11:47.040]  supply that was an AP study done a decade ago at levels by the way higher than
[11:47.040 --> 11:51.360]  scientists thought could be in there from just sewage runoff from all of the
[11:51.360 --> 12:00.400]  prozac family of drugs you can look up studies in birds and in mammals and I
[12:00.400 --> 12:07.200]  was just reading in a big ornithology paper a few weeks ago about birds but
[12:07.200 --> 12:18.680]  shrimp fish other marine life other invertebrates across the board are quote
[12:18.680 --> 12:26.640]  suicidal they're so happy shrimp will not even try to avoid birds now in areas
[12:26.640 --> 12:33.680]  where sewage is dumping out by the Mississippi and so yes people are either
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.240]  really awake and really concerned or they are completely distracted and
[12:38.240 --> 12:44.880]  diverted caught kind of in a mesmerized field the allegory would be the snake in
[12:44.880 --> 12:51.720]  the jungle book whose eyes spin like pinwheels and is constantly trying to
[12:51.720 --> 13:02.080]  hypnotize fellow inhabitants of the jungle so that he may dine on them this
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.560]  is the great challenge can we keep our consciousness so let me just tell you
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.520]  what's coming up today biological bad luck blamed in two-thirds of cancer cases
[13:13.520 --> 13:18.880]  Reuters says we've interviewed the top scientist across the board on this
[13:18.880 --> 13:26.800]  subject genetic engineers you name it geneticist it's true that you are
[13:26.800 --> 13:32.840]  predisposed to get cancer if you have certain deficiencies or if certain
[13:32.840 --> 13:39.640]  toxins are in abundance but they're saying it's all nature that causes cancer
[13:39.640 --> 13:45.120]  not nurture or not stimulus not environment and everybody knows from
[13:45.120 --> 13:49.400]  common sense you smoke two three packs of cigarettes a day for 40 years you're
[13:49.400 --> 13:54.760]  going to probably get lung cancer some people though they found are over a
[13:54.760 --> 14:01.160]  hundred years old in areas of Japan and France who eat certain diets high in
[14:01.160 --> 14:05.400]  minerals and they don't die of lung cancer when they're smoking two three
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.240]  packs of cigarettes a day and drinking two bottles of wine a day in the case of
[14:09.240 --> 14:19.640]  the French and it's connected directly to their diet getting things they need to
[14:19.640 --> 14:24.640]  not cause a deficiency that then when you add a bunch of other carcinogens on top
[14:24.640 --> 14:30.560]  of it triggers a chain reaction so undoubtedly everybody knows that certain
[14:30.560 --> 14:33.800]  families have heart attack problems heart problems certain families are
[14:33.800 --> 14:40.600]  predisposed to cancer that loads the gun is what geneticists say your genetics
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.800]  loads the gun
[14:44.800 --> 14:50.120]  environment pulls the trigger and they've done studies on this you can have one
[14:50.120 --> 14:58.160]  brother who has genetics to be very aggressive and the other brother has
[14:58.160 --> 15:01.760]  genetics to be very aggressive but one ends up being sent away to boarding
[15:01.760 --> 15:05.440]  school and beat up a bunch and so that person turns into a fighter and then
[15:05.440 --> 15:11.200]  into a killer whereas the other brother doesn't get put in something like that
[15:11.200 --> 15:16.640]  doesn't get put under the pressure and so it doesn't trigger those traits that
[15:16.640 --> 15:23.520]  are already there so genetics loads the gun environment pulls the trigger and I
[15:23.520 --> 15:29.520]  was reading over this article they're really pushing the idea in the London
[15:29.520 --> 15:34.360]  Guardian and Reuters and just everywhere else that you need to get genetic
[15:34.360 --> 15:42.920]  testing for cancer predisposition pre predisposition and now they're they're
[15:42.920 --> 15:46.160]  doing genetic testing where they're claiming they find cancer in you
[15:46.160 --> 15:50.520]  live time when pretty much everyone on the planet gets cancer every day and
[15:50.520 --> 15:55.440]  your body just takes it out with your immune system that's all your immune
[15:55.440 --> 15:58.600]  system gets overwhelmed weighed down doesn't know what's going on anymore
[15:58.600 --> 16:02.640]  gets confused by vaccines we know lowers your immune system in every study
[16:02.640 --> 16:08.240]  look it up then suddenly you don't go after the cancer so lack of oxygen lack
[16:08.240 --> 16:13.600]  of nutrients lack of key minerals lack of sunshine all of this is in the real
[16:13.600 --> 16:18.080]  studies accelerating cancer then you had a bunch of heavily cooked red meat a
[16:18.080 --> 16:22.600]  bunch of processed alcohol a bunch of GMO a bunch of cigarettes to that and then
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.840]  a bunch of pharmacological synthetic drugs you're dead in the doornail you
[16:28.840 --> 16:36.960]  had a bunch of stress to that you're in trouble so I guess I've already kind of
[16:36.960 --> 16:41.320]  covered this story but plain old bad luck plays a major role in determining who
[16:41.320 --> 16:46.000]  gets cancer and who does not according to researchers who found that two-thirds
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.360]  of cancer instances of various types can be blamed on random mutations and not
[16:50.360 --> 16:57.320]  hereditary or risk habits like smoking so they're saying it's hereditary or its
[16:57.320 --> 17:04.200]  mutations because one school says it's all hereditary others say it's all
[17:04.200 --> 17:09.080]  mutations others say oh it's smoking how about it's all of them what are you but
[17:09.080 --> 17:12.680]  but they're now saying in this in these new studies that it's mutations that are
[17:12.680 --> 17:21.680]  happening what do you think causes mutations GMO crops pesticides all these
[17:21.680 --> 17:26.240]  new synthetic toxins that have never existed before cell phone radiation on
[17:26.240 --> 17:35.440]  record causes mutations in the DNA of the brain the researchers said on
[17:35.440 --> 17:39.600]  Thursday that random DNA mutations accumulated in various parts of the
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.880]  body during ordinary cell division are the prime culprits behind many cancer
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.360]  types well we've always known since they discovered cancer that it's a
[17:50.360 --> 17:59.800]  mutation in the DNA division that then causes the cells to go haywire but the
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.520]  big issue is why are so many cancers exploding and why they never try to find
[18:04.520 --> 18:11.360]  out why cancer rates are increasing in so many areas and why don't they try to
[18:11.360 --> 18:17.480]  find out how to stop the cause not quote try to cure something that's that's got
[18:17.480 --> 18:25.480]  thousands of different corollary reasons for triggering it so I want to find out
[18:25.480 --> 18:31.160]  why cancers exploding because they're not ever really gonna find a cure for it
[18:31.160 --> 18:36.120]  because there's so many new cancers because our bodies are being bombarded
[18:36.120 --> 18:42.880]  and our cells are put under stress and they're trying to find ways what's
[18:42.880 --> 18:46.480]  happening is just like with insects or bacteria that are put under poison or
[18:46.480 --> 18:49.840]  pesticides or biological attack they will start mutating a lot of them will
[18:49.840 --> 18:53.280]  start dying they'll start getting a lot of deformities but then they will have
[18:53.280 --> 18:59.120]  genetic divisions that will actually cause resistance or immunity to the
[18:59.120 --> 19:05.920]  poison to the toxin to the cancer so this will cause in a minority of our
[19:05.920 --> 19:12.480]  offspring superhumans that will be resistant to the BT corn and all the
[19:12.480 --> 19:17.440]  chemicals in the fluoride I mean insects are reproducing sometimes on a
[19:17.440 --> 19:20.840]  weekly basis a lot of times on a yearly basis that's why they become drug
[19:20.840 --> 19:24.800]  resistant or drug immune within a few years bacteria within a few years
[19:24.800 --> 19:34.200]  because they're dividing sometimes every day so see they do cause mutations that
[19:34.200 --> 19:38.320]  ends up causing most of the bacteria or most the insects to not be viable but
[19:38.320 --> 19:42.200]  some of them the mutations right and the globalist in some of their papers that

[24:43.520 --> 24:48.000]  repeal John Boehner and he needs to be recalled he certainly needs to be removed
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.520]  from his leadership position period he can go play golf with Obama where
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.160]  Obama has been snorkeling on his new three-week vacation and dining at a
[24:59.160 --> 25:07.000]  restaurant charging $500,000 that's out of the weekly standard to have a
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.120]  membership at the restaurant $500,000 $295 a plate President
[25:13.120 --> 25:16.960]  Barack Obama and his I mean the reason I raise this is all their class warfare
[25:16.960 --> 25:22.080]  business and Obama and Al Gore's telling Africans they can't have cars or air
[25:22.080 --> 25:26.560]  conditioning and that we can't have that either all these people live like King

[25:31.280 --> 25:36.360]  break down oil hits five year low below $56 a barrel as supply glut
[25:36.360 --> 25:42.520]  persists it's an oil war we've got Peter Schiff manager of billions over at
[25:42.520 --> 25:46.400]  global Pacific capital he's gonna look forward into the year give us his
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.840]  breakdown of what he thinks happening in the third hour and we have Paul Watson
[25:51.840 --> 25:57.280]  joining us in the next segment headline terrifying Scottish police to
[25:57.280 --> 26:01.880]  investigate offensive comments including telling someone their dress or clothes
[26:01.880 --> 26:08.200]  don't look nice or saying someone's fat even in a tweet if you say say the fake
[26:08.200 --> 26:13.240]  Rick Ross rapper is a big fat pig you would be arrested there is no law it's
[26:13.240 --> 26:17.480]  just pure tyranny England does the same thing Paul Watson from her Britannic
[26:17.480 --> 26:23.680]  Majesty's Kingdom London will be joining us with an eye on 2016 Jeb Bush
[26:23.680 --> 26:29.160]  resigns from all boards that's just some of the disgusting news we're gonna be
[26:29.160 --> 26:33.960]  getting to as they prepare to run the family that helped put the Clintons in
[26:33.960 --> 26:37.720]  power who vacation together and who call each other family against each other
[26:37.720 --> 26:42.040]  talk about a can't do we just have Don King
[26:43.200 --> 26:47.480]  run against Don King for president I mean it's it's it's for those that don't
[26:47.480 --> 26:50.920]  follow boxing what killed heavyweight boxing is pretty much dead compared to
[26:50.920 --> 26:55.840]  what it was 20 years ago is all the rigged events where King would have
[26:55.840 --> 27:01.480]  both corners under him an event after event it would be Don King running the
[27:01.480 --> 27:07.400]  whole show would be like if one stable had all ten horses in a Kentucky derby
[27:07.400 --> 27:15.080]  and you saw the jockey of the fastest horse pulling back the reins to slow
[27:15.080 --> 27:18.280]  the horse down and the horse wouldn't stop so the jockey shoots it in the
[27:18.280 --> 27:24.880]  head while riding it I mean that's how stage these elections are but the
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.280]  American people sent the Tea Party to Congress they didn't take it over but
[27:29.280 --> 27:32.800]  close the Republicans took over the House and Senate but I don't think
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.520]  obviously the Tea Party didn't get full control yet but we've come a long way
[27:36.520 --> 27:46.760]  certainly come a long way and I don't see the American people buying in the
[27:46.760 --> 27:51.840]  Jeb Bush versus Hillary and let me get something straighter I detest Hillary
[27:51.840 --> 27:57.880]  more than Jeb Bush but only because I've been living under her and her
[27:57.880 --> 28:05.440]  tyranny in her anti-gun anti-family garbage since I was in high school but
[28:05.440 --> 28:14.960]  then I know the backside just as a acid test I recoil from Hillary Clinton but
[28:14.960 --> 28:19.920]  it doesn't matter it's all part of the same rigged game like saying I like this
[28:19.920 --> 28:26.680]  boxer more than that boxer Don King runs them both it doesn't matter so in a
[28:26.680 --> 28:29.920]  way I kind of want Hillary to get in because it'll just be that much more
[28:29.920 --> 28:34.960]  horrible and in our face and wake people up more Jeb Bush gets in the
[28:34.960 --> 28:38.040]  Republican blue bloods that are starting to wake up and the Republican
[28:38.040 --> 28:44.280]  country club types that realize they're in trouble and then the grassroots kind
[28:44.280 --> 28:53.840]  of Republican blue blue-collar Reagan Democrats are going to go to sleep for
[28:53.840 --> 28:58.280]  four to eight years while they open the borders up bring us into all these
[28:58.280 --> 29:03.360]  international unions got our sovereignty bringing internet censorship I mean Jeb
[29:03.360 --> 29:09.480]  Bush once opened borders Jeb Bush is anti-gun Jeb Bush vacations with the
[29:09.480 --> 29:16.640]  Clintons I mean come on remember when Terry Reed of the CIA and others told me
[29:16.640 --> 29:20.240]  about the Bush's vacationing with Clinton when he was governor 11 times and
[29:20.240 --> 29:25.160]  secretly hanging out with him and seeing him in limousines together this is
[29:25.160 --> 29:30.800]  like back in 96 I was interviewing Terry Reed Larry Nichols everybody on record
[29:30.800 --> 29:36.760]  that worked for Clinton and I mean I believed him but it was wild back then
[29:36.760 --> 29:41.240]  now it's just in the news oh they've been friends for decades they're best

[35:21.920 --> 35:30.800]  a whole section of articles dealing with Obamacare Obamacare employer mandate
[35:30.800 --> 35:38.320]  kicks in January 1st and Fox News is reporting with direct links to the law
[35:38.320 --> 35:47.760]  itself Obamacare finds rising in 2015 IRS prepares to collect now remember that
[35:47.760 --> 35:51.240]  the last four or five years we would point out sections of the bill then it
[35:51.240 --> 35:54.400]  became law the last two years and we would point out that it was getting
[35:54.400 --> 36:00.840]  ready to start kicking in in 2014 2015 2016 the law is staggered to mainly kick
[36:00.840 --> 36:06.000]  in after the 2014 election well here we are don't have health insurance get
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.240]  ready to pay up but see health insurance itself is going up my parents have both
[36:11.240 --> 36:14.240]  been told that their premiums are going to more than double they already went
[36:14.240 --> 36:19.080]  up about 45% last year now they just got told with Blue Cross Blue Shield
[36:19.080 --> 36:23.720]  you've got too low an insurance we have to comply with Obamacare and can't
[36:23.720 --> 36:28.120]  compete with it so we're going to basically double your rate isn't that
[36:28.120 --> 36:33.640]  special and the main architect of it Gruber said they had to hide the fact it
[36:33.640 --> 36:37.360]  was going to do this and he laughed about it because it's funny because we're
[36:37.360 --> 36:43.680]  stupid member I don't know Gallup says bad politicians and corrupt government
[36:43.680 --> 36:49.640]  are the top concern of the American people maybe we're not so stupid we just
[36:49.640 --> 36:53.400]  don't know what to do because the criminals are in control and want to
[36:53.400 --> 37:00.520]  start a civil war as a pretext to totally take the country over the
[37:00.520 --> 37:03.640]  individual requirement to buy health insurance went into effect earlier this
[37:03.640 --> 37:08.320]  year but the coming tax season is the first time all taxpayers will have to
[37:08.320 --> 37:12.560]  report to the IRS whether they had health insurance for the prior year
[37:12.560 --> 37:17.360]  under penalty of perjury the IRS is now has a new federal database I should add
[37:17.360 --> 37:22.280]  that's in the news today that is meant to track all that and of course the IRS
[37:22.280 --> 37:26.520]  will get your medical records Nixon got in trouble for having about 120 records
[37:26.520 --> 37:30.520]  but they get to have all of them and share them with other agencies and
[37:30.520 --> 37:37.920]  private groups okay the fines for 2014 year were relatively modest 95 per person
[37:37.920 --> 37:45.160]  or 1% of the household income but now it goes up ladies and gentlemen into the
[37:45.160 --> 37:52.200]  thousands in that just special and then by 2016 over 5,000 and the IRS will be
[37:52.200 --> 38:00.480]  taking it in that just sweet in that just darling feds are building a national
[38:00.480 --> 38:06.240]  data warehouse for Obamacare and Medicare to keep track of everything you do the
[38:06.240 --> 38:12.000]  weekly standard reports that's all up on info wars.com prisonplanet.com and I'm
[38:12.000 --> 38:20.200]  also reading from drudgereport.com you can dial 1800 Obamacare I guess 1800
[38:20.200 --> 38:27.240]  affordable care and it dolls 1800 FU still says that by the way feds looking
[38:27.240 --> 38:34.040]  for company to run national data warehouse for Obamacare hope you enjoy
[38:34.040 --> 38:38.400]  them in your business because that's what was in the bill and that's what it
[38:38.400 --> 38:50.160]  does so we're gonna be breaking more of that now I'm coming up. We'll also talk about NASA's Don
[38:50.160 --> 38:57.760]  spacecraft begins its approach to Cirrus. Is that how you pronounce that? An asteroid the
[38:57.760 --> 39:04.080]  size of Texas. We're also gonna break this down I mentioned it was just a
[39:04.080 --> 39:08.920]  fascinating article geoengineering scientists terrified of projects he
[39:08.920 --> 39:14.680]  helped create an excuse for weather modification programs. Dr. Matthew Watson
[39:14.680 --> 39:19.240]  from Bristol University UK told the media recently that he's terrified by many
[39:19.240 --> 39:22.960]  of the geoengineering projects currently in the works to thwart man-made
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.480]  climate change a phenomenon being hawked as an excuse for weather modification
[39:27.480 --> 39:33.160]  programs by many in mainstream science as a threat to humanity but see the
[39:33.160 --> 39:40.720]  projects going on worldwide are admitted but the details are secret. The
[39:40.720 --> 39:44.800]  patents are public that they add the barium salts, lumen dioxide and some
[39:44.800 --> 39:50.280]  radioactive isotopes to the kerosene jet fuel then the pilots everybody don't
[39:50.280 --> 39:54.160]  know what's going on the airlines don't even know what's going on and then they
[39:54.160 --> 39:58.600]  become aerosolized dispersal units then they put in kids textbooks we showed
[39:58.600 --> 40:02.880]  this about six years ago in a mainline textbook being used all over the country
[40:02.880 --> 40:08.400]  that look that up textbook teaches kids about chemtrails I think was the
[40:08.400 --> 40:12.440]  headline and it says yes we have patents it's added to jet fuel it goes
[40:12.440 --> 40:17.760]  through the jet engine and puts a sunscreen was the quote up there to
[40:17.760 --> 40:21.960]  protect you from global warming there's a whole giant global secret project
[40:21.960 --> 40:26.440]  going on they tell adults it isn't happening and then it's in textbooks it
[40:26.440 --> 40:33.080]  is there it is science textbook teaches about chemtrails there it is
[40:33.080 --> 40:40.680]  that's the center point learning science one essential interactions and that is
[40:40.680 --> 40:49.240]  used in most of the 50 states you talk about frustrating folks I still get
[40:49.240 --> 40:53.160]  emails saying I'm a liar that they don't have goats that are part spider that
[40:53.160 --> 40:57.080]  produce body armor when I did the first interview with the guy before there was
[40:57.080 --> 41:02.480]  ever even in the news in 1997 and listeners thought it was a fake
[41:02.480 --> 41:07.080]  interview with the CEO in upstate New York with thousands of spider goats with
[41:07.080 --> 41:14.160]  the Department of Defense program we ain't in Kansas no more folks that was
[41:14.160 --> 41:23.760]  1997 above ground not even secret this is 2015 baby this is Buck Rogers but we
[41:23.760 --> 41:27.400]  are in this suppressed system not aware of it while there's a literal breakaway
[41:27.400 --> 41:33.640]  civilization operating in plain view Jack in our food our water the drug
[41:33.640 --> 41:39.480]  supply everything what I know is so insane I can't believe it what is
[41:39.480 --> 41:45.920]  admitted is so over-the-top I can't even comprehend it can you imagine what
[41:45.920 --> 41:48.840]  they're doing there's a reason to act like we don't exist and don't care
[41:48.840 --> 41:54.040]  there's a reason the elites are so arrogant because they got privy to the
[41:54.040 --> 41:58.080]  life extension technologies you name it does it mean they're immortal no it means
[41:58.080 --> 42:04.880]  though they're going for it almost no one survives I looked up the numbers we
[42:04.880 --> 42:08.720]  did articles about a few years ago with a heart pump it's a bio it's a
[42:08.720 --> 42:15.360]  bionic heart outside the body the uses your heart as the bag more than six
[42:15.360 --> 42:20.400]  seven months the record longevity with those was about a year and a half Dick
[42:20.400 --> 42:24.840]  Cheney lived past that and there was never an article about how he held the
[42:24.840 --> 42:32.960]  record and he went out did all these PR pieces on C-span you name it they had
[42:32.960 --> 42:36.360]  like some two-hour special about Dick Cheney's heart on C-span I think that
[42:36.360 --> 42:40.440]  was the name of the special I watched the whole thing in a hotel room on a
[42:40.440 --> 42:44.360]  journalist trip I couldn't go to sleep I watched like two hours of Dick Cheney
[42:44.360 --> 42:48.960]  talk about his heart with his doctor Dick Cheney looks better than he looked
[42:48.960 --> 42:58.120]  15 years ago Dick Cheney lived almost two years with a bionic heart without a
[42:58.120 --> 43:04.600]  pulse and he went on to say before he got a new heart a real heart from a donor
[43:04.600 --> 43:11.720]  that he didn't get anything special Dick Cheney it's my new heart not someone
[43:11.720 --> 43:18.240]  else's old heart that's out of what AP the point is they're getting stuff we're
[43:18.240 --> 43:21.520]  not getting access to you better believe Harry Reid who fell off his treadmill
[43:21.520 --> 43:26.880]  and broke his face in a bunch of ribs and I don't even take pleasure and even
[43:26.880 --> 43:29.920]  though I detest Harry Reid I'd rather him get right with God and repent of all
[43:29.920 --> 43:33.920]  his evil but the point is is that none of them are immortal I don't care how
[43:33.920 --> 43:37.160]  many technologies they get they may be able to store their memories in a
[43:37.160 --> 43:44.640]  computer and they'll the scientists will call that computer homo trend you know
[43:44.640 --> 43:52.200]  homo sapien transcendent but it's not really you it's just more flim flam from
[43:52.200 --> 43:58.480]  a bunch of con artists you globalist for all your power couldn't hold Baghdad with
[43:58.480 --> 44:07.040]  100,000 US trips and you're not gonna hold the human spirit that's the type of
[44:07.040 --> 44:10.360]  stuff that's coming up today Paul Watson will be with us about 10 15 minutes to
[44:10.360 --> 44:14.760]  the next hour then I'll get into the geoengineering news the economic news on
[44:14.760 --> 44:19.080]  oil what that really means from my view Peter Schiff's coming up I want to ask
[44:19.080 --> 44:24.800]  Paul Watson about several terrifying and that's in the headline articles at
[44:24.800 --> 44:32.440]  info wars calm by he and Kurt Nemo the vaunted Kurt Nemo terrifying Scottish
[44:32.440 --> 44:37.920]  police to investigate offensive comments prospect of Orwellian thought
[44:37.920 --> 44:43.200]  police prompts huge backlash now I had Robin Page on about 14 years ago it was
[44:43.200 --> 44:49.000]  the year 2000 so 15 years ago he's host of one man and his dog where he would
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.000]  walk from town to town visit different pubs different restaurants all the cool
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.920]  areas in England and in the UK also in Ireland you know up into Scotland he gave
[44:59.920 --> 45:02.800]  a rural affairs speech where he said rural communities to serve the same
[45:02.800 --> 45:09.000]  protections as homosexuals and Muslims page wasn't even a right winger they
[45:09.000 --> 45:14.840]  arrested him saying the word homosexuals hurtful and for saying that
[45:14.840 --> 45:20.360]  Muslims were offended and that was in the news BBC apologized for his great
[45:20.360 --> 45:26.080]  evil I that Robin Page interview is out there I interviewed him you can pull up
[45:26.080 --> 45:31.240]  other headlines hundreds arrested in London sting of racist words where they
[45:31.240 --> 45:40.880]  sit it said in Indian curry shops and in coffee shops listing for any racist
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.840]  terms under the breath and then you are arrested to create fear this is what
[45:45.840 --> 45:49.400]  political correctness is nothing to do with stopping racism they let known
[45:49.400 --> 45:54.640]  al-Qaeda terrorists come in Rashida Swat in my six and run the the seven seven
[45:54.640 --> 46:00.560]  bombings that came out on Fox News even on Fox News and in British news so it's
[46:00.560 --> 46:04.800]  all staged it's all a big joke it's total tyranny I want to talk about that
[46:04.800 --> 46:12.960]  with Paul Watson and I want to get into the Royals all the their top buddies
[46:12.960 --> 46:17.640]  caught with secret slave rooms with kids and dead kids and dead kids found on
[46:17.640 --> 46:24.560]  their property and Jimmy Savelle and and all these leaders in the admit the
[46:24.560 --> 46:29.960]  point is this is all being brought out though to blackmail the UK Empire into
[46:29.960 --> 46:33.680]  the final New World Order folks this is being brought out at a key time for a
[46:33.680 --> 46:37.600]  reason through the control press so I'm sure a lot of it's true because it just
[46:37.600 --> 46:44.360]  keeps happening but at the same time there's something else behind it the
[46:44.360 --> 46:48.520]  the UK's and trying to get out of the EU there's major power jockeying just like
[46:48.520 --> 46:51.560]  you saw stuff being brought on the Vatican at a key time there is an
[46:51.560 --> 46:56.760]  unseen hand above this manipulating it so all that with Paul Watson Paul let's
[46:56.760 --> 47:01.440]  get into this article Scottish police to investigate offensive comments well
[47:01.440 --> 47:05.360]  they're now arresting people I saw you wrote about two days ago who call
[47:05.360 --> 47:10.360]  someone fat because quote they felt offended that's what hate speech is
[47:10.360 --> 47:14.360]  that's what they're trying to pass here but I guess it's already arrived where
[47:14.360 --> 47:19.480]  you're at we already had the mayor a few months ago of Houston send out subpoenas
[47:19.480 --> 47:24.360]  and was looking at criminal charges for preachers who were preaching that your
[47:24.360 --> 47:29.040]  homosexuality was a dangerous lifestyle I mean is there free speech since when
[47:29.040 --> 47:33.600]  did tolerance which I believe in become no you have no free speech and we don't
[47:33.600 --> 47:39.440]  tolerate your views what is happening in her Britannic Majesty's Kingdom well
[47:39.440 --> 47:44.200]  I'm Alex this controversy started earlier this week when a British TV host
[47:44.200 --> 47:49.160]  called Katie Hopkins tweeted out a joke we had an Ebola patient arrive in
[47:49.160 --> 47:53.320]  Scotland earlier this week she was transferred to a hospital in London so
[47:53.320 --> 47:57.760]  this TV host who is known for making these controversial comments tweeted a
[47:57.760 --> 48:02.920]  joke about quote Glaswegian Ebola patient moved to London's Royal Free Hospital
[48:02.920 --> 48:07.880]  not so independent when it matters most are we jocks fill so the response to
[48:07.880 --> 48:14.640]  this relatively tame joke was for tens of thousands of people to sign more than
[48:14.640 --> 48:20.280]  one online petition calling for her arrest and for her to be charged with
[48:20.280 --> 48:25.720]  racial hatred and apparently now Alex I've learned this week that Scottish
[48:25.720 --> 48:30.440]  people are in fact a race you know Liberals are so obsessed with being
[48:30.440 --> 48:35.160]  offended that they're now inventing whole new races of people to claim that
[48:35.160 --> 48:39.960]  somebody's racist so instead of completely dismissing this out of hand for
[48:39.960 --> 48:45.600]  the idiocy that it is police Scotland the official Twitter account tweeted out
[48:45.600 --> 48:49.400]  quote please be aware we will continue to monitor comments on social media and
[48:49.400 --> 48:54.320]  any offensive comments will be investigated now of course they won't be
[48:54.320 --> 49:00.280]  investigating the threats to kill this TV host which I actually tweeted out
[49:00.280 --> 49:04.320]  earlier today they won't be investigating given that they're now
[49:04.320 --> 49:10.160]  acting as thought police for Twitter the 77 unsolved murders in Scotland
[49:10.160 --> 49:14.760]  Scotland is the number two murder crime capital of Europe but they will be
[49:14.760 --> 49:19.920]  investigating people who make jokes on Twitter so the response to this was
[49:19.920 --> 49:24.840]  completely vitriolic forage came out and basically said the people who
[49:24.840 --> 49:28.760]  complain should be charged with wasting police time on the other side of the
[49:28.760 --> 49:33.240]  political equation a London independent writer came out and rightly said this is
[49:33.240 --> 49:38.160]  terrifying this is George Orwell's thought police so people across the
[49:38.160 --> 49:44.240]  border united in their outrage that this has become a police issue that it's now
[49:44.240 --> 49:50.600]  a racial crime to make fun of Scottish people with tens of thousands of people
[49:50.600 --> 49:56.280]  signing these petitions calling for this TV show host arrest
[49:56.280 --> 50:03.680]  continue Paul and it's it's the same TV host we had the previous article where
[50:03.680 --> 50:08.240]  she did a recording for a weight loss show with fat people and this is the
[50:08.240 --> 50:13.320]  whole fat acceptance movement which I'm doing a video about on Monday where she
[50:13.320 --> 50:18.480]  merely asked somebody how they became fat if it was due to overeating one of
[50:18.480 --> 50:24.800]  these fat activists then proceeded to call the police and report the TV show
[50:24.800 --> 50:29.920]  host for committing a hate crime in questioning why this fat person became
[50:29.920 --> 50:32.640]  fat because I did see it in the news where the police went and interviewed
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.440]  and took somebody in but didn't charge him was that this talk show host or
[50:36.440 --> 50:40.640]  another one because there's so many instances of this Paul they're still
[50:40.640 --> 50:45.720]  investigating the the TV host they did arrest somebody for again making another
[50:45.720 --> 50:49.600]  joke about an accident that occurred with a bin lorry running over some people
[50:49.600 --> 50:52.760]  in Glasgow a couple that's right stay there I want to come back and go over
[50:52.760 --> 50:56.640]  this because now they're wanting us arrested you arrested Lord Monkton by

[54:52.200 --> 54:59.000]  to spy on us and control our lives but Politico now says it's dangerous so it
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.320]  must be true now that they said smart grid powers up privacy worries and they
[55:04.320 --> 55:11.440]  get into all that Congress demands answers on feds cell tower tracking by
[55:11.440 --> 55:16.600]  simulator towers it's only a simulator when it steals all your data without a
[55:16.600 --> 55:24.640]  warrant that's all coming up the geoengineering news and more by the way

[55:54.360 --> 55:59.280]  I'm going to officially start it next week and go for one month taking photos

[56:05.240 --> 56:08.680]  anybody's here folks are on vacation but I just got to pick a spot for pulling my
[56:08.680 --> 56:11.720]  shirt off for taking the photos it's got to be done and we're going to see what
[56:11.720 --> 56:18.320]  happens when I take the oxy powder super mill vitality and the metha cabalamin
[56:18.320 --> 56:24.720]  nutraceutical beyond that grade secret 12 vitamin B12 religiously several times
[56:24.720 --> 56:27.600]  a day I'm going to take oxy powder for like a seven-day period but the others
[56:27.600 --> 56:31.600]  because I always forget to take this but every couple days and I'll keep doing
[56:31.600 --> 56:36.040]  the same amount of exercise the same amount of eating you name it we'll see
[56:36.040 --> 56:39.520]  what happens but I've already had dramatic effects as folks can see
[56:39.520 --> 56:44.480]  watching on television with the infowarslife.com products the X2 you
[56:44.480 --> 56:49.200]  name it we're going to see what happens with this 2015 health challenge but 48
[56:49.200 --> 56:53.440]  percent off those three products when you get them together infowarslife.com
[56:53.440 --> 57:03.960]  or 888-253-3139 Paul we'll get more into this in the next hour but continuing
[57:03.960 --> 57:11.520]  with this Orwellian move it segues right into being climate deniers or if you
[57:11.520 --> 57:15.360]  don't want open borders they say they may arrest you so already saying it's a
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.080]  race crime to say you don't like you know there's too many this too many that I
[57:19.080 --> 57:23.640]  mean the truth is every group of immigrants has its own racist stuff people
[57:23.640 --> 57:27.080]  in the country have their own racist still it's just tribalism and some of
[57:27.080 --> 57:31.720]  the discrimination is legitimate if say you're Tibetan and you don't like the
[57:31.720 --> 57:36.200]  fact that the Chinese are being forcibly migrated there and that they're trying
[57:36.200 --> 57:39.720]  to force Tibetan women to marry Chinese men I mean I don't have a dog in the
[57:39.720 --> 57:43.000]  fight whether you're Tibetan or Chinese I like Chinese folks the point is is
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.720]  that immigration can be used as a weapon but they want to try to ban even
[57:46.720 --> 57:50.860]  criticizing that or say you can't even use the word immigrant now first it's
[57:50.860 --> 57:55.480]  don't use illegal now don't use immigrant now it's migrant what's the
[57:55.480 --> 58:01.680]  bottom line here bottom line Alex is that they're taking on board any
[58:01.680 --> 58:06.280]  discrimination whatsoever even if it's mere discernment like I said with a fat
[58:06.280 --> 58:11.160]  acceptance movement now feminists are glomming on to this they're embracing it
[58:11.160 --> 58:15.840]  they're promoting a lifestyle that is incredibly harmful to women we know
[58:15.840 --> 58:20.360]  obesity is linked with a myriad of different diseases it costs the economy
[58:20.360 --> 58:26.920]  cost the US economy 663 billion dollars a year yet now we're being taught and in
[58:26.920 --> 58:32.040]  fact TLC has just given the star of fat girl dancing her own TV show to push
[58:32.040 --> 58:35.720]  this propaganda I want to talk about this is not that we hate fat people I
[58:35.720 --> 58:39.720]  mean I switch 270 foot nine pounds is that we care about them and they're
[58:39.720 --> 58:43.920]  trying to say we can't tell folks hey you want to try to control your diet

[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:29.680]  Paul Watson from the UK joins us Peter Schiff economists Europe Pacific
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.040]  capital manager of billions will be joining us to give us his prospectus
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:40.000]  in a 2015 on the economy the oil wars and more coming up in the next segment
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.440]  I'm gonna shift ears with Paul talk about this article by Curtin MO and
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.560]  them for wars.com lawsuit claims Prince Andrew had sex with underage sex
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.880]  slave and this stuff just keeps coming out and a lot of it ends up getting
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:58.560]  verified Jimmy Savelle who ended up having secret sex dungeons for children
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.880]  and it's all been confirmed at the BBC in a sex ring hanging out with these
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:09.040]  people constantly having the highest level royal access Princess Diana didn't
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.040]  have one half this access he could go anywhere including their private
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:20.440]  chambers any time of day or night what do you think's going on there but the
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:25.960]  larger issues why is this coming out now massive blackmail in my view who are
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.840]  the power structures we'll talk about it the news behind the news the rest of the
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:36.440]  story Paul Watson though getting into this this move to now make it racist to
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:42.200]  not like Obamacare or turn your guns in well how about racist if you don't
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:49.760]  praise 500 pound women particularly well I mean that's that's starting to happen
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.600]  there there was a TED talk I'm putting all this together for a video where a
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.880]  woman made the comparison between racial discrimination gender discrimination and
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:06.120]  obesity discrimination now we have smoker shaming okay we have pictures of
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:11.000]  diseased lungs on packets of cigarettes people are encouraged not to smoke they
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.360]  can smoke that's their personal choice but rightly they're encouraged not to do
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.320]  so because we know it's unhealthy and in the UK it cost the economy five billion
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:26.360]  pounds a year the economic burden of obesity in the UK is 47 billion pounds
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.440]  a year because of all the diseases linked with obesity and the fact that we
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.160]  have to pay for it on the NHS and look you know with my tax money I pay for
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:42.720]  people on the NHS transgender people to have their penises removed now if
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.000]  that's what they want to do with their bodies then more power to them but don't
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.040]  ask me to pay for it and now we're starting to see the same kind of thing
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.840]  with obesity so as I said before the break this big YouTube star fat girl
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:04.200]  dancing has been given her own TV show on TLC to promote acceptance at any size
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.200]  so they're pushing onto young impressionable impressionable people
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:13.040]  that to be fat is something to be embraced not something to be fought
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.960]  against despite the fact that it leads to early death in all manner of terrible
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.120]  diseases and that anybody who questions that even asks how you became fat in the
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.560]  first place is a thought criminal who could be charged with a hate crime if it
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:34.640]  offends somebody well now they're moving not just in San Francisco or Austin
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:43.160]  Texas but other areas of the US to make me pay for not just people's abortions
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:47.240]  but as you said sex changes and then if you're against that they say oh you're
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:54.280]  just a sexist homophobe or whatever no what's going on is what if somebody
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.440]  wants to put devil horns on their head we know that's a popular modification
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.440]  starting up should I then have to pay for that or should you have to pay for my
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.680]  nose job let's just say I decide I want a nose job I like my nose let's just say
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:10.440]  and it costs $20,000 and then and then you go I don't want to pay for your nose
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.320]  job but I go you're being racist to white man I get my nose job I mean where
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.760]  does it in Paul well I mean you've talked about it before there's a there's a
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.280]  syndrome called body identity integrity disorder where people feel that they
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.760]  should amputate their own limbs and hey you know you could say that that's just
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.200]  a lifestyle choice and under socialized health care like we have in the UK with
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.160]  the NHS which if you criticize it it's like blaspheming against Muhammad or
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.520]  something then you know you're hurtful I mean I've had arguments with people at
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.640]  parties and stuff who get in my faces and say it's hurtful and insensitive for
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.800]  me not to want to pay for transgender people that's because they've attached
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:58.640]  their identity on the NHS stay there we're talking about this more

[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:14.000]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:20.040]  I'm Alex Jones your host Peter Schiff economist manager of Euro Pacific
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:26.000]  Capital an excellent track record of predicting major trends we'll look at
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.680]  the economy is it really doing great like the mainstream media saying what's
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:35.240]  the oil war about driving down oil prices is that good or bad what do you
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.480]  think is going on behind that Peter Schiff joins us coming up in about 52
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:43.360]  minutes from now Paul Watson's with us to the bottom of the hour that I'm going
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.920]  to shift gears into geoengineering scientist that's weather control
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:56.240]  scientist terrified of projects he helped create but finishing up with Paul
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.120]  Watson if you just joined us in the United States in many states and
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:07.080]  cities and in the UK and Europe they make you pay as taxpayers for sex
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:13.200]  changes and we got off into this whole issue because they're now doing criminal
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.560]  investigations arresting people you name it that even use the word homosexual in
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:22.560]  the UK or of a talk show host says yeah you know there's too many fat people we
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.960]  need to get them some you know better lifestyles then thought crimes are
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.360]  reported the thought police come after you and there's not even a law they're
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:38.080]  using a racial discrimination law that I believe anti-magnicarta anti-constitution
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.160]  as long as you don't hurt somebody have a right to say or do whatever you want to
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.240]  then apply that to denying global warming's man-made or criticizing
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.360]  government officials this is about getting rid of free speech and they're
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.080]  moving in the UK they're moving in Europe they're moving here to Chinese
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.760]  style net censorship that's what's behind this while serious crimes are
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.440]  being committed citizens are being attacked you name it but if it's
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:09.640]  politically incorrect say in the UK if say gypsies steal your trailer this has
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:14.040]  been mainstream news or attack you the police will not respond because they're
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.760]  a minority and they just go they're allowed to that's an actual headline
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.360]  about six months has passed and police will do nothing about family stolen
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.920]  travel trailer and it shows where the people are living in it what they've
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.520]  done yeah click on the Daily Mail link there will show to TV viewers and they
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.600]  just say we're keeping it police won't hand stolen caravan back to couple to
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.720]  protect human rights of the travelers living in it and they've had it for
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.000]  months so this is what we're talking about folks in the UK if somebody breaks
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.400]  in your house and you defend yourself they throw the book at you this is
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.920]  about total enslavement Paul two years ago couldn't get in to see the NIH won't
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.560]  let him see a private doctor about their authorization for a month had strep throat
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.760]  had to quit working for a few weeks they wouldn't let him get health care and he
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.920]  was saying that if he's at a party and says I shouldn't have to pay for people
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.520]  to have their sexual members chopped off if you want to do that pay for it
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.080]  yourself it's not that we're criticizing your wonderful sacrament and
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.720]  we're not cool and into it like I am tired of being everybody's slave I'm
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:22.840]  tired of paying foreign banks trillions of banker bailout money I'm tired of it
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.680]  I'm tired of General Electric being tax exempt with their head promoting higher
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:32.320]  taxes on the middle class I'm tired of being sucked off of Paul Watson go ahead
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:37.720]  I'm ranting yeah and the problem is now we have the state responding to this
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.560]  minority of professionally offended people on Twitter who were largely
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.160]  feminist to actually police ideas and free speech this is where it gets really
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.440]  scary in Kafka S because just about a week or two ago Janet Bloomfield the
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:58.280]  founder of the women against feminism hashtag on Twitter had her account
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.600]  suspended merely for disagreeing with a feminist Jessica Valenti who wrote in
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:08.160]  The Guardian that Christmas was oppressive to women what happened was a bunch of an
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.000]  army of feminists contacted Twitter claimed that she was spamming when she
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.720]  obviously wasn't they got her account shut down there was also a fitness
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:23.680]  instructor Maria Kang who took a picture of herself in good shape with her three
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.200]  children as a kind of female empowerment mind over matter message you know
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.800]  genuine female empowerment of course the feminists hate that so then they went
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.720]  on this crusade to label her as a thought criminal she was banned from
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.720]  Facebook for her hate speech of encouraging women to be fit and healthy
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:46.560]  and saying that they can live fit and healthy people are not crazy they are
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:51.640]  classic totalitarian authoritarians who want to be able to tell us how to think
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:57.600]  what to say what to do and their main army are these women who were tricked to
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.560]  not need men to be part of the system and the woman wants to be in the system
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.440]  and not have a man that's their issue but to do it as if they've joined the
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:10.640]  special forces and this is their big crusade and then to go around and
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.600]  hin-peck other women that have children in whole foods which they do you
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.160]  shouldn't have two kids you shouldn't have three kids to do nothing about the
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.480]  true sexualization of women that the systems engaged in these are women that
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:27.120]  bought into the system and now hate other happy empowered women this is
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.880]  nothing but a vampire like cult of scum yeah and that's exactly it third third
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.000]  wave feminism has nothing to do with equality and everything to do with
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.520]  social engineering this is what it's all about and they will contradict the
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:47.760]  very biological truths of human nature and biology they will claim and they
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.800]  will write books that men are only attracted to good-looking women because
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.960]  they've been brainwashed by the diet and cosmetic industry not because
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:01.560]  they're you know healthy-looking fertile and genuinely attractive apparently we
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.000]  should be you know attracted to faties and people who are really out of shape
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.960]  and unhealthy and we're not just because we've been brainwashed by the diet
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.520]  industry which shows you the insanity the total vacuum of logic that these
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:19.120]  feminists imbue when they go on these kind of crusades and when it becomes a
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.480]  threat to free speech when police are saying they will now investigate people
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:30.200]  for making jokes on Twitter about fat people or jokes about Ebola patients it's
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:35.120]  downright terrifying as the leftist London Guardian London independent
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.400]  writer said in his column that's right and let's be clear Paul this is all
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.400]  selective a seven-year-old an art project draws a picture of his dad who's in the
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.480]  army with his m16 when they say on career day draw a picture of your father
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.320]  and your mother he gets kicked out of school suspended for a week
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:59.360]  criminally investigated that's a real case I just mentioned one of many but
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.840]  you can go to after school events and play Call of Duty where you're
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.480]  simulating the death of thousands or World of Warcraft where you're chopping
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:15.640]  people's heads off it's only the system is allowed to put these images out then
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.440]  if you do anything I mean it's okay for Quentin Tarantino to have movies with
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.440]  the n-word and and and you know movies with men raping men and everything else
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.800]  because that's art but see they say what's art when it's their art then it's
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:40.280]  socially okay when the the gay community wants to use words that then you get
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:45.160]  arrested for using in the UK if you're quote not part of the club it's not just
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.280]  discrimination against free speech it's creating a new royalty class where these
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:56.200]  politically correct groups nest within the overall power structure and so they're
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:02.880]  a protected system that's given little goodies indulgences given royal patronage
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:07.800]  so that others will then want to join the guild I mean this is this is cult
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:13.080]  programming it's it's pure cultural Marxism it's the belief that oppression
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:16.760]  comes from within the culture not from the state and so then they join with the
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.880]  state and get those little goodies that you talked about and it's it's evident in
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:26.400]  Gamergate which was it basically emerged that all these top feminists in leaked
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:31.320]  email conversations were attempting to subvert the gaming industry to push
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.680]  their own social engineering was confirmed that they've been able to do
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:40.400]  it yeah and you know that their claims are completely spurious like there are
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.400]  no positive female characters in video games somebody made a video literally
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:50.360]  listing two three hundred positive female characters in video games over the
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:54.880]  past two decades so it's completely without foundation and it's this
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:00.400]  authoritarian zeal to make society conform around their belief system which
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.560]  is ultimately a way of putting them on top of the power structure you know in
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.400]  their ivory towers so it has nothing to do with equality and everything about
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.520]  them hoisting it over everybody else telling us what we can think what we can
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.400]  say and again completely conflicting against the very biological innate
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:25.000]  human nature that we all share with each other it's like the current governor
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:31.040]  who's mourning I guess the death of his father Mario Cuomo today at 88 years old
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:36.000]  he said if you are pro-liver pro-gun get out you're not welcome here in New
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.360]  York this year and he was asked are you serious you said yeah get out what a
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:46.440]  gangster thug and it just shows that the totalitarianism of the left these
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.400]  people are the opposite of tolerant they are monsters who have successfully seized
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.840]  power oh yeah that they're tolerant until you voice an opinion which differs with
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.320]  theirs and then they're intolerant and call for your arrest and for your social
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.280]  media accounts to be banned and you know this is harmful in the I mean I made a
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:10.520]  video about the sex of this got absolutely huge response thousands and thousands of
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.840]  comments which is that because of this feminism because there are less real
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:19.880]  women men are just giving up on marriage altogether and basically checking out of
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.400]  society not because their failures they can't get women they're still having sex
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.120]  with women they're just rejecting and shunning marriage because their
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.440]  relationships are not working because of the brainwashing and the social
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:36.040]  engineering that third wave feminism which has nothing to do with original
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:41.720]  feminism has raw on society well let's be clear women wanted basic rights it was
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.280]  a very barbarous world most men didn't have rights 300 years ago 200 years ago
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.840]  and so women who'd been in a protected class under chivalry but were oppressed
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.120]  in certain degrees but they also had a lot of other like they you get off the
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.720]  ship first when it's sinking and you don't have to carry things and you know
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.200]  on and on and on so they've tried to project something I'm not defending
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.200]  that system it was just a primitive system but the new one has been
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.920]  scientifically deployed where Edward Bernays and others said we will hijack
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:14.680]  the suffrage movement by the 20s we will control it we will break up the
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:19.800]  family we will tax we will yoke both the men and the women now they'll and then
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.320]  the kids will belong to the state as Hitler said first you get the women
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.080]  then you've got the children so follow the men this is not our debate with the
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.680]  I'm gonna skip this network break I need time thank you this is not a debate
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:37.880]  with the feminist and the control to calitariants known as the left and then
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:43.520]  they're kissing cousin the controlled right it is a fact and an in-game 2.0
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.560]  that's on prisonplanet.tv we break this down with Dr. Michael Kauffman with the
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:53.960]  Carnegie documents the Ford documents the MIT documents it's all there where
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:59.120]  they said in the 50s and 60s we're gonna put out in the name of empowerment
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:03.840]  women in the workforce and all this but really all it is is a takeover then
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.760]  we're going to have a sexless society when we're all done first it'll be obi
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.960]  gay or be transgender then we're gonna come out with hundreds of sexual
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:16.560]  identities which Facebook just did this year this is all scientific until there
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:21.360]  is no identity and the only crime is having an identity you say you're
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.520]  straight that's a thought crime that hurts others you say you're gay that's a
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:32.000]  thought crime no no no you're going to have to be gray sexless nothing they
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.960]  want plastic people and actually in Charlotte Israbe's book she shows a
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.640]  restricted document from the Department of Education you guys go find it it was
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.400]  in the original edition I think there's one back in the shipping department one
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:50.000]  that's sold out and it shows them taking a kid through like eight stages through
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.200]  the revolutionary stage and then finally a brainwashed quote carbon unit that
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:21:00.880]  serves the state this is the real plan that's what so frustrating is that come
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:07.120]  on folks saying that you is on a TV show can't talk about how fat people need to
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.320]  lose weight so the police come that's not freedom that's super dangerous and
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:19.880]  is terrifying and it's all being done to end the human system imagine saying
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:28.720]  to deer it's oppressive that male deer fight with each other and it's oppressive
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:33.760]  that male deer who are inherently bad because they're males run up on a female
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.840]  and chase them around and then the female may be responsive may not be
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:45.320]  responsive if she's in estrus if she is ovulating that's biology folks it's a
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:51.320]  war on biology it is a war on reality and first they're like oh just be
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:56.560]  tolerant of other people well I'm a libertarian but listen I listen I got
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.320]  my own life I've always noticed losers always want to run other people's
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.320]  lives losers always want to control their people people that don't have
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.320]  something going on they want to get in your business I've got stuff going on my
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.320]  whole life I don't want to be in your business but let me explain something you
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:17.600]  keep out of mind do you understand you slack jawed nothing control freak scum
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.480]  you may want to read Gloria Stein of Miss magazine put out by the CIA declassified
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.280]  to turn you into slave of the government you may want to die younger cancer you
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.600]  may love tyranny but don't you hate me that I'm red-blooded and trying to
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:37.120]  fight for the basic code of humanity that we should be able to be humans and
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.800]  not have fluoride put in our water lower our IQ this is social engineering
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:47.160]  to sabotage the human instinct so we can be put into an unnatural destructive
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:54.960]  exterminist transhuman eugenics global program that we are all living in Buck
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:03.840]  Rogers baby 2015 it's real it's all public now Watson I want to shift gears
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.160]  final comment on that and then I want to get into info wars calm prison planet
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:14.480]  calm lawsuit claims Prince Andrew had sex with underage sex slave allegedly
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:19.280]  arranged by former Bear Stearns financier how many of these bankers and
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:24.800]  members of parliament and BBC presenters you hear these wild claims for 30 years
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.200]  you know a thousand times we heard about with Bill Cosby but notice this isn't in
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:33.040]  the news over here they admit their blackmailing parliament with it it's like
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:36.160]  you can hardly get in unless you're part of the club to begin with they don't
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.120]  trust you dead bodies being dug up on the royal grounds Jimmy Savelle the top
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:44.600]  pedophile who had total access to the Royals turns out everything we heard
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:49.280]  about him was true seek secret sex dungeons you know little kids sex with
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:53.880]  dead bodies the guy was obviously a pedophile the archetypal pedo and you
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.120]  see photos of him that's a big issue I want to review some of that with you and
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.920]  and being in the UK what it's like but then the big question why is it coming
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:08.200]  out now it looks like a larger power struggle within the elite to force some
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:14.120]  of the old elites over there into this larger global system we're seeing a
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:19.880]  consolidation everywhere well yeah final comment on the previous subjects the
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:25.240]  good news is that 77% of American women according to a poll last year don't
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:30.200]  identify as feminists the problem is feminists have got control of large
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:36.240]  portions of the media which is why when any public figure is criticized with by
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.680]  them immediately apologizes we saw the ridiculous fiasco with let me just say
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.200]  that all of the establishment transhumanist feminists can go to hell
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:51.320]  I'll never apologize to them they are a bunch of scum who hate strong women and
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.800]  don't want women to be armed against criminals they're a bunch of filth who
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.200]  want women alone wards of the state sorry Paul we're gonna go to break come
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:02.960]  back with a pedophile stuff you've got the floor go ahead yeah exactly Kaley
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.280]  Kuoco this TV star came out and said I like being with my husband I like
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.600]  cooking for him I like looking after my children I mean God forbid the reaction
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:15.920]  was overwhelming she was castigated by feminists and she had to come out and
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.440]  apologize you know feminists would love North Korea because you know if you
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:24.240]  don't profess your faith your belief in the dear leader and all his dogmas and
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:28.480]  you will be silenced that's the kind of authoritarian society they want in the
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.240]  West that's why we should oppose it at every turn well that's right Kurt
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:36.600]  Nemo wrote about it a feminist post hateful tweets after actress says she
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:40.840]  loves serving her husband but of course the flip size is her husband I guarantee
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:46.160]  you love serving her that's like when you scrub your wife's backers she scrubs
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.480]  yours or you meant or my family comes over and I grill steaks or you know
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.400]  that my wife would cook dinner I mean it's not about someone's a slave but
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.000]  they put this idea out there that if you ever help your neighbor or you ever
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.280]  stand up for somebody you somehow are losing out this because they all want
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:08.960]  us totally alone and let's face it nothing against what you'd call
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.960]  classically unattractive women because of a woman is exciting and funny and
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:17.240]  neat even if they're not classically Marilyn Monroe beautiful I see you know
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.560]  beauty in them if a person's old and is aged you know gracefully and as a
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.840]  loving spirit there's something beautiful about how old they are and
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:29.200]  they're twisted you know joints like an old twisted tree can be beautiful but
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.200]  if they're an ugly old person in their heart the ugliness like a stained glass
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:38.640]  window projects that ugliness in a macabre fashion but I'll tell you at the
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.360]  heart of this is a bunch of women that don't feel successful who are part of a
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:47.920]  cult guild in the state who hate good-looking women I've experienced it
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:52.080]  I've seen it firsthand and it isn't that they're lesbians it isn't they're
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.920]  attracted to women sexually though some are and there's a you know large
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.800]  percentage higher than the average rate of lesbians in the feminist movement
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:08.440]  they want to conquer classically hot virals a male term but you know powerful
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:13.280]  feminine truly feminine women it is a conquering feminist everybody knows
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.400]  women on average dressed up for other women women are in competition with
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:22.240]  women on average it is it is a sect of women trying to dominate other women
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:27.640]  and trying to become a classical male role that they claim they are trying to
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:32.440]  get rid of they're not trying to kill the king to get rid of monarchy they're
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.240]  trying to kill the king to make themselves the king the Janet Reno's the
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:43.360]  big sisters the mr. Maddow's and I call them out that's all they want to wear
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.880]  the pants they want to be John Wayne and so they want to assassinate men and then
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:52.080]  assassinate real women so they could sit up there and build the world in the
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:56.480]  image of Janet Reno well guess what the world don't like that and doesn't want
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:03.400]  you filth you got it to go to hell excuse me go ahead Paul yeah generally
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:07.760]  speaking there's I mean the women in their 20s who I talked to see right
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.760]  through it they don't they're not feminists they don't identify it but
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:15.400]  it's just generally unhappy women and this applies to men too who as he said
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:19.480]  are jealous of fertility jealous of younger women they've missed out on
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.120]  having kids getting married having success they joined a death cult they
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.760]  want flora in the water they want GMO they want sterilization they don't
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.640]  believe in having kids they hate life we know who you are go ahead sorry Paul
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.520]  yeah so if they want to get into their 30s and 40s and engage in this miss
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.360]  and they're attacking the goddess and I don't get it that in a religious way they
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:46.640]  hate the goddess they hate the goddess that's who these people are they are
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:52.320]  devils sorry Paul go ahead yeah and if they want to live unhappy lives then
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:57.000]  that's their business but don't don't then try and take away my free speech by
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.400]  claiming that hi I have male privilege or white privilege and that my free
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:06.440]  speech is invalidated because of my gender or skin color that is at its root
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:11.720]  sexist and racist so that's when they become an actual threat to the society
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:16.240]  and to freeze they're projecting they're projecting we're libertarians we're
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:20.360]  living let live we don't care about them we're not what we don't care but they
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:25.720]  care they care I mean I've seen it with these modern fascist so-called liberal
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.880]  women they get mad at families they get mad at women you know you know dress
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.120]  classically but everybody's looking at the woman dress classically there's a
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:37.560]  reason women dress like that in every culture because it's powerful they don't
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.920]  want women and men having innate human power they're anti-human they want a
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.920]  bunch of anti-human devils in their state-run monopolies to have all the

[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:58.640]  and holy living dead they'd like to lock us up put us in there pretty pins I like
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.160]  to say pretty pins instead of pretty jails whenever we talk about England being
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.760]  turned into a total police state with the rest of the UK we come in with the
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:14.560]  misfits London Dungeon should have come in with Hollywood Babylon Wednesday when
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:19.280]  I was talking about Hollywood collapsing
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:31.200]  make sure your face is clean can't have no dirty dead that's right all the
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:37.800]  corpses here clean boy some poetry right there actually talking about fake high
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:41.280]  society that's carrying out all its corruption all its murders all its
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:46.760]  cultural death all its rot but doing it all with an air of respectability in
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:52.520]  the establishment and I want to be clear about something here I truthfully do not
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:59.840]  dislike anybody for their race or quite frankly with their sexual proclivities
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.040]  does that mean that I don't know the statistics that the gay lifestyle of
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.960]  having hundreds of sexual partners a year isn't very destructive with drugs
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:13.520]  and diseases and I feel sorry for those folks and I've had friends and even
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:21.640]  family cousins and people that I've seen absolutely destroyed by that culture
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.920]  it's a critique on a culture kind of like gangster culture that's been forced
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.960]  fed to the black community I have a critique on gangster culture is very
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:35.720]  destructive thug life is very destructive and is a social primer to
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:40.320]  prepare young black males for induction into their college that is the pen
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:47.080]  attention and it's now the calling card for white kids Hispanic kids mixed kids
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:52.440]  most of kids I see around Austin what's the system going to do when people are
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:56.480]  all intermarrying like they're doing now well they'll just say you're not black
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:00.600]  enough or you're not wide enough it's just more mindless divide and conquer by
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:06.000]  people that don't have issues that are real that's why we have to force debates
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.240]  about real issues hey you know foreign banks have signed us on to two quadrillion
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:18.080]  two thousand trillion that's in USA today hey did you know the fluoride lowers
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:23.240]  your IQ by about 10 points that for three years here's a Harvard study hey did
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.280]  you know that they're preparing the army for mass gun confiscation here's the
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:33.080]  army times hey did you know they built FEMA camps did you know Bill Gates gets
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:37.760]  paid about five billion dollars a year through a tax-free foundation to run and
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:44.160]  administer a secret program to change the weather of North America did you know
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:49.000]  that's been in the news but details again are classified see there's hundreds of
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:56.640]  huge things like that and so I'm so sick of cartoons and movies everywhere just
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:02.000]  anti-gun propaganda anti-heterosexual propaganda anti-family propaganda
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.920]  anti-male propaganda anti-private property propaganda anti-rural
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:11.960]  community propaganda it's just you shows the twisted disconnected from reality
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:17.520]  globalist eugenicist view so as long as it means you die alone as long as it
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:20.840]  means you die broke as long as it means you don't have a community other than
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:30.960]  the community that's controlled and centralized they want you all in ghettos
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:35.680]  in barrios in the gay neighborhood in the black neighborhood in the lesbian
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.000]  neighborhood in the Arab neighborhood in the Southerner neighborhood in the
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:47.200]  northerner neighborhood in the they want balkanization the great game and so in
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.840]  my heart I don't dislike anybody and I'm not a hypocrite who sits there and
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.760]  tries to look into everybody's bedrooms and what they're up to but it's mental
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:03.240]  illness writ large when the big issues in this country and what's taught to kids
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:10.440]  as young as five years old in public schools about homosexual sex give me a
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:14.800]  break that's not tolerance that's sexualization of children that's
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:20.540]  pedophilia Calvin Klein can get in trouble for having what looks like some
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:28.000]  16 to 20 year olds in underwear and it's called pedophilia but then when it's
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.520]  being taught to kids it's okay to five-year-olds see see how they'll do
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:39.240]  that dying core can be caught it can be in the Chicago Tribune that they were
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.800]  running thousands of kidnapped little kids out of central Europe alone in one
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:49.560]  year disappearing them and women there wasn't one big feminist group said
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:55.480]  squat whenever we criticize radical Islamists as sexually mutilating women
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.360]  slung into sex slavery you don't hear word one from Gloria Steinem and that
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:04.120]  group of hags who've all got their husbands and kids oh they're gonna have
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:10.320]  kids they're gonna live and have a life they just don't want you to have one
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.240]  you're not gonna hear anything out of the control left about that because all
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:20.160]  they want to attack is men that aren't ashamed that they're men and so they got
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:29.280]  a lot of men either acting like fake males watching ESPN all day or
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:36.120]  being dominated by their woman and that's what women hate women may think
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.680]  intellectually that they want to dominate their man because they think men
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:45.720]  used to dominate them which is not the case and then they're so unhappy and
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.360]  we'll go through man after man till they find somebody that just won't let them
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.280]  push them around because a woman's trying to find their equilibrium they're
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:59.840]  trying to test you and biologically they don't like you if you aren't strong
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:04.920]  why do you think so many young women 20 years old go for the bad boy because
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:09.440]  biologically they think he must be dominant even if most bad boys are
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:15.880]  fake dominance who are smart enough to try to act dominant to accrue women and
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:22.840]  this is all the biological drive of humans and civilization what really
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:30.040]  attracts the finest women is a man that's honorable a man that works hard a
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:36.040]  man that's strong a man who's not a coward a man that will protect them but
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.240]  all of those traits are under attack and the male itself is under attack
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:43.880]  because you take it down there's nobody to protect the women and the children
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:50.040]  anymore the state will set up women that's supposed guardians and in some
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:54.880]  cases they'll even do a good job but the natural dynamic has now been sabotage
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:00.520]  and you see society in every metric falling apart as the system grinds to
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.880]  a halt just like collectivism didn't work in the Soviet Union or in
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:10.280]  communist China or in Nazi Germany it never works in the end because it's
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:18.760]  based on fraud and when the wheels come off civilizations implode it's an
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:24.080]  unnatural system it works for the elites for a season it allows them to
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:29.240]  overturn the natural order into their image they're not saying the existing
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.360]  order was an enslavement that's what they say to you in their own internal
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:38.680]  manuals it is an affront to them because they don't run it they want to be
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:43.760]  God they want to control the genetics they want to control procreation they
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.440]  want to control your desires and your appetites they want to control your free
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:54.360]  will Paul I've held you longer today I appreciate the great job of doing you
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.400]  already written two articles today and info wars.com and prison planet.com but
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.280]  but finishing up on this because this is the big issue I want to get into real
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.480]  self-help more like Michael Savages said he's gonna do as well I know we've
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.960]  privately talked about this drilling into the social engineering drilling into
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:15.160]  how they're attacking us as humans and how they're doing it to all of us so I
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:19.080]  all of branch out to women that have become modern feminists believing it
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:24.480]  was for empowerment I care about them but but the evil Gloria Steinem's the
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:28.840]  evil people like big sis and others they know what they're doing they're
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:35.000]  preying on like pimps giant throngs of women that they've helped this enfranchise
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.200]  as you see women now desperate in the streets prostitution at all-time records
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:48.560]  in recorded history women's sexualized turned into into the most base of objects
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:55.640]  by the feminist god they worshipped Paul Watson yeah that's that's partly why
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:00.280]  marriage rates are collapsing and I did a video called the sex of this which I
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:06.080]  mean it got 6,000 comments on info wars another 5,000 on YouTube it was
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:11.760]  completely insane with all these men who were for the vast majority successful
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:16.520]  go-getting men they weren't losers sat in their bedroom playing computer games
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.920]  who had just given up on trying to find a woman to marry all together because of
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:27.440]  this notion this creation of the modern female as somebody who is basically
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:30.880]  impossible to get along with because they've been brainwashed so badly by
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:37.120]  feminism to hate men to you know it's divide and conquer another interesting
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:43.480]  thing was you mentioned in homosexuals earlier I mean I back in 2008 I wrote an
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:49.680]  article pointing out that the ban on gay people donating blood in the UK was
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.000]  probably a good idea and should be kept even though it was later lifted because
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.400]  gay people were more likely to give blood which was contaminated with the HIV
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:03.200]  virus now you can debate that on either side we know that AIDS isn't as big a
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.640]  problem as it used to be it's up for debate no somebody threatened to call
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:11.640]  the police on me and said they'd actually called the police on me for
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:16.400]  saying that medically it was probably quite risky to allow gay people to go
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:19.840]  even though the vast majority of medical doctors in the UK in the US are saying
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:25.200]  don't do it including gay ones but but here's the larger problem they won't get
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:35.640]  mad about the whole controversy Paul that took place back in the 90s
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:41.640]  Clinton in the 80s as governor with a whole chain of state prisons with the
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:45.720]  guards this came out in the news selling drugs they had a doctor with a
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:50.880]  whistle to the people to give blood sometimes once a week knowing they had
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.880]  HIV and hepatitis it was then sent up to Canada produced into factor 8 and
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:02.040]  contaminated hundreds of thousands of people conservatively worldwide and
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:07.280]  many of them died and then there was a whole lawsuit and a chain and then the
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:10.800]  hemophilia society they exposed it got fire bombed the same night that the
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.360]  doctor got fire bombed we had the doctor on they got so threatening never
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:19.160]  did another interview out of Little Rock but oh there's no discussion of how the
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:23.640]  blood supply is so incredibly dangerous oh but don't worry now it's a political
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:27.600]  correct issue yeah go get your blood transfusion even though it's one of the
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:31.760]  most dangerous things you can do just slap a gay label on it and then it's a
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:37.520]  sacrament go get your AIDS blood or you're against gay people see see they
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.680]  can just don't like Obamacare you're racist don't want to turn your guns in
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:46.320]  your races don't want hepatitis blood you're you're against gay people and the
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:52.200]  truth is is that there is a small subsection as reported by every time I
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.760]  mentioned people don't believe it San Francisco Chronicle Rolling Stone Google
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:05.000]  bug chasers gay bug chasers gift givers gift receivers and there's also a
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.360]  subset that wants to give blood to give the gift well I don't want the gift if
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.280]  I'm in a big car wreck and bleeding to death and they got to do a blood
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:17.640]  transfusion I'm sorry I don't want to die I know in the dark human sacrifice
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:23.440]  world of extreme people that are very unhappy that you know want to do things
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:27.240]  sexually that leaves their intestines hanging out their rear end I'm sorry
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:30.920]  out it's not that I'm not cool and trendy I just my intestines I don't want
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:34.720]  them hanging out on the ground I don't want AIDS I'm sorry I am a homophobe
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.520]  it's true I'm being sarcastic about that I mean it's just incredible how
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:44.800]  nihilistic and decadent things have gotten it's just insane Paul yeah they
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:51.360]  place political correctness above basic proven science and health it's like with
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:56.760]  the fat acceptance movement instead of acknowledging that obesity is a terrible
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:00.720]  affliction that you know you should just do as much as possible to be fit
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.720]  healthy to exercise to eat right because it causes terrible diseases and
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:12.280]  premature death instead they've created this whole new level of PC whereby it's
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:16.400]  a new sense of victimhood it's not that they're unhealthy and fat and that they
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:22.040]  overeat it's that they're being condemned and discriminated against simply for
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:26.680]  embracing their own lifestyle and if you say that that lifestyle is unhealthy
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:32.440]  and destructive mainly to women then you're akin to a racist and then you
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:35.320]  could never discuss why people are getting obese a lot of the additives
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.880]  and things because now it's in the racist area basically thinking and having
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:42.680]  your own view as racist because you're not allowed to have your own
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:48.360]  discrimination of restaurants of flavors of ice cream of women of men anything
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:52.280]  you're going to do what the high priest say or it's over that's what it's all
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:58.000]  about it is total tyranny it is thought police it's here 2015 we're living in
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.600]  but we are the resistance folks over 70% of youth now in the U.S. are against
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:09.600]  abortion the numbers were flipped in 1973 you heard Paul national polls 70 plus
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:14.720]  percent of women don't like feminists and understand it's a trap the problem is
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:19.200]  the average man's drooling watching ESPN so this is up to the women to lead us
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:22.840]  out of this it's not about men and women fighting with each other it's not about
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:26.040]  gay straight fight with each other it's about admitting the agenda of
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:30.720]  dehumanization that's hijacked any minority movement that's out there now
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:34.960]  Paul I want to go to this article by Kurt Nemo info wars.com and it's in the
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:40.200]  UK news lawsuit claims Prince Andrew had sex with underage sex slave allegedly
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:45.080]  arranged former Bear Stearns financier Jeffrey Epstein a lawsuit filed in
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:48.600]  Florida accused of the Duke of York having sexual relations with underage
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.720]  sex slave the allegation names multi-millionaire financier Jeffrey
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:59.560]  Espen Epstein who was also convicted of soliciting sex with underage girl one
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.560]  such powerful individual Epstein forced the woman to have sexual relations with
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:08.800]  a member of the British Royal family Prince Andrew Duke of York the
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:15.280]  document claims who knows if this is true but my gosh Paul we're gonna go to
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:19.600]  break in a few minutes but just the firestorm of pedophile news and Seville
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:26.120]  having high-level access to all these royals above even a secret service what
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:31.280]  do you think's really going on well in every single country where this happens
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:36.120]  whether it be Belgium France Bosnia the Netherlands you name it whenever it gets
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:40.720]  to the level of celebrities yes sometimes they get burned any level
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.520]  above that judges or politicians the case gets shut down so you saw with
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:50.920]  Seville back in 2009 three years before it actually came out the police
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:54.640]  actually quizzed him on these allegations of course we know he was a
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:50:02.440]  close friend with Prince Charles and the Royal family redacted 90s in 96 places
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:07.920]  redacted Seville's connections to the Royal family this was back in 2009 so
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:12.160]  three years before it came out that he was involved in raping these hundreds of
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.320]  girls chanting Hail Satan at these occult rituals the Royal family were
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:21.760]  busy removing their connection to his activities so again it's this notion that
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:26.520]  the Royal family has no power whatsoever they don't control anything they just
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.360]  axed a documentary on the order of why are you being a pedophile phobe though I
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.080]  mean I mean next you'll be arrested probably and that's where this is all
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:43.280]  going Paul exactly and again the Royal family has exacts a massive amount of
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:47.880]  power in the UK we see numerous examples over and over again we come back by the
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.520]  while you're talking we're putting up mainstream news articles with everything

[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:27.560]  of the producers things look at all these headlines about Jimmy Savelle
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:32.000]  in his secret rendezvous with Prince Charles and coming in all hours of the
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.400]  night and he said yeah it is weird that it's all coming out now Jimmy Savelle
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:40.960]  suspicious behavior at the palace set to be revealed in a new book the mirror
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:47.400]  reports be another headline about arrest explode across the UK as hundreds of
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:51.800]  prominent pedophiles are arrested but look at Jimmy Savelle if you're a TV
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:58.240]  viewer radio listeners go to info wars.com forward slash show look at him
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:01.760]  imagine if you went to a daycare center and it's like hi I'm gonna keep your
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:06.400]  kids but he would run at children's charities like these photos are nothing
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:11.240]  just do his name and then click Google images nightmarish and it's him like in
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.480]  bath rubs with kids sitting on his knees and then he would run these children's
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:18.840]  charities and do satanic rituals and they found the satanic altars and
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:24.600]  everything I mean this stuff's going on all over the place look look at that one
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:29.240]  in the middle right there with his hands together I mean central casting for a
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:33.400]  child molester he is the archetypal child molester and he ran children's
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:38.320]  charities that you can Google Jimmy Savelle with children and it's him in
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:42.000]  bath rubs little kids sitting on his knees hanging out with Prince Charles I
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.960]  mean two plus two equals we know what so Paul continue with these scandals
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:51.840]  coming out why do you think they're coming out now because this I mean was
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:56.640]  David Ike saying this 20 years ago so I think it really scares me how much more
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:00.120]  of what David says might be true I mean I believe he believes what he says but
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:06.800]  my god I mean it's you look at Jimmy Savelle I mean that is a demon from
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:12.440]  hell go ahead I think basically they know it has to come out at some point
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:16.760]  they're bringing it out now on the other own accord so they can try and control it
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:22.880]  by burning these patsies who are mainly TV hosts and disc jockeys from the
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:28.200]  70s who basically had you know relationships with 17 year old girls I
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.520]  mean it they should still be punished but it's not nowhere near the same in the
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:36.520]  same league as what Savelle did allegedly with members of the royal
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:41.320]  family but what's actually happening now is that they can't find somebody to
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:46.200]  investigate the parallel scandal which is the Westminster pedophile scandal
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:50.480]  where they literally abducted boys strangled them to death I'm talking
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:56.040]  about Tory MPs members of Parliament ran them over in vehicles and that's what Ike
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:01.520]  said 20 years ago and he's name names and now it's confirmed I mean folks this
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:06.040]  is insane but they can't actually get somebody who isn't a part of the
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:11.160]  establishment to investigate it a lady Elizabeth Butler Sloss had to step down
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.520]  because the victims the family members complained that she's she was just gonna
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:19.360]  whitewash it so now they're saying oh because we can't find anybody who isn't
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:23.400]  directly in with the establishment we're just gonna leave this investigation
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:29.120]  for now and basically the UK justice system is completely controlled by
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:33.840]  Freemasons this has come out over and over again I mean look at the Hillsborough
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:39.960]  disaster it's 25 26 years later and still they're covering it up and it came
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:44.360]  out a couple of weeks ago that they got together at a Freemasonic Lodge in
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:47.720]  Sheffield where I used to live the heads that who were in charge of the
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:52.480]  Hillsborough football stadium disaster which happened in 1989 got together and
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:56.720]  basically agreed to blame it on this one police constable during their
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:01.480]  Freemasonic Lodge meeting and this is the same thing happening with all these
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:05.840]  judges who are appointed to whitewash these investigations they're all
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:09.720]  Freemasons they're all protecting each other and that's why they're burning
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:14.600]  these lower-level entertainers so what you say in the UK it is the Mason's that
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:22.040]  are king yeah that's that's who's running this whole show it came out that
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:27.080]  criminal gangs in the UK have infiltrated Scotland yard and are working
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:30.480]  with police to commit crimes and it's just calmly reported in the

[01:59:50.760 --> 02:00:09.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show big brother mainstream media government
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:16.760]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:23.240]  network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones well we've had a pretty
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:29.640]  dynamic hour of a lot of key information like the moral the story is no
[02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:34.360]  matter how hard the establishment tries these ghouls they're not going to be
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:38.800]  able to hide their crimes forever by these the naivete of the public that
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:45.480]  allows us to grow they have had cases on record in Europe in the UK in the US
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:50.400]  snuff films little kids you name it with high-level judges government people
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:54.160]  because they start recruiting their own people into government and then that's
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:59.880]  a rite of passage or a gang initiation like most mafias and stuff you got to
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:03.840]  make your bones you got to kill a few people you got to testify in court and
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:10.920]  you know lie you got to prove that you can be a trusted member of the team but
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:15.440]  with the real global mafias you've got to hate humanity and want to hurt
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:20.480]  innocence and so for people that care about children and love children and
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:26.840]  would soon die is see an innocent child hurt the fact that these ghouls want to
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:34.680]  hurt children is just lost on us and so it allows it to grow again the masonic
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:37.960]  system and I'm not defending it it's just historically with secret
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:43.440]  construction guilds colleges you didn't just give the colleges tricks out you
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:49.080]  had to be an initiate it was secret and had a lot of religious stuff associated
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:54.280]  with it I won't go into the whole story but I'm somewhat of a lay expert on it
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:57.720]  and been interviewed by History Channel and others on the subject of the Masons
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:01.000]  George Washington was a Mason who's really great guy but he warned about it
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:07.120]  being used by corrupt groups to create mafias and now especially in the UK it's
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:12.400]  just become a get out of jail free card organization and then there's no justice
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:17.680]  and then what do you do when you can't even investigate get back into the case
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:21.000]  you were getting into this in the news now of strangling boys running them over
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.080]  with cars after they rape them and this new lawsuit with Prince Andrew I mean
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:31.120]  there's no way they can hide this forever Paul well what's interesting Alex is
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:36.160]  that when the royal family knew that these several allegations and proof that
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:39.720]  he raped hundreds of girls they knew that was going to come out because the
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:44.200]  police had interviewed him in 2009 and the royal family had made those 90 odd
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:49.240]  redactions to that report disassociating Saville from the royal family
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:54.800]  after that they passed a law which changed the Freedom of Information Act in
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:00.160]  the UK so that letters emails and all documents relating to the royal family
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:05.600]  the Queen Prince Charles Prince Philip would no longer be disclosed even if
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:09.840]  they were in the public interest so before they knew it was going to come out
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:12.840]  because Saville had already been interviewed by police they made these
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:16.680]  redactions they then passed this law to prevent those documents being released
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:20.560]  which would obviously show their close relationship which we know the likes of
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:24.880]  Prince Charles had with Jimmy Saville so they were on it from the very beginning
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:29.880]  they were prepared for this to come out and now it's you know it's expanded to
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:34.720]  these Westminster MPs in the 80s and others say this is still going on with
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:40.560]  MPs today who would literally set up these rape dens in London abduct young
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:45.760]  boys take them to these places strangle them to death as they're raping them and
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:49.960]  then in in another case they literally just one of them ran over one of these
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:54.880]  young boys in his vehicle. Why are you a boy stranglephobe? Hold on racist why are
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:04:01.560]  you a boy stranglephobe? Well victims who were there at the time eye
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:05.880]  witnesses you know kids who were being raped who are now in their 30s came out
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.120]  they've come out with all this information and as I said before the
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:12.880]  break it's going nowhere because they're saying oh we can't get somebody who isn't
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:17.000]  a member of the establishment to investigate it so it's well imagine
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.320]  being a member of the government and instead of going home and having a glass
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.960]  of wine and food with the family you go to a rape den where you rape little
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.840]  boys and then strangle them I mean it's just we're in so much trouble Paul it's
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:33.200]  just insane. And then they find dead bodies of women who've been murdered on
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:36.960]  the Queen's Sandringham estate and it's now you know no big deal they they were
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:41.080]  out shooting on boxing day and then they find this woman's dead body right in
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:49.320]  the spot where they were shooting and it's just no big deal. The Royals here though Paul I wonder what the Queen's
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:58.320]  going to be eating at dinner tonight. Alright Watson great job Peter Schiff's coming up stay with us.
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:03.080]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape and the truth is
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:07.920]  it's hard even with diet and exercise because of toxic food in our environment

[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:47.440]  to tell us what he thinks coming up
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:51.880]  peter that's a lot i threw out there you can tackle whatever you want first or
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:54.800]  out of the gates where do you want to take us what do you think most important
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:55.840]  right now
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:58.720]  well first of all happy new year alex and uh... to you in your audience and you
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:01.520]  know i used to do my own radio show but i stopped doing it
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.800]  uh... back in august so uh...
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:07.440]  at least the alex jones show is still on the air so i could settle for the
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:11.280]  guest appearances on your show is popular but you're busy guys we want to
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.960]  welcome you on whenever you want to come on or you know
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:16.840]  uh... because your analysis is so needed thank you peter
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:20.760]  yeah but there's so much to discuss i mean you hit on a lot of topics there in
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:22.160]  the introduction so
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:25.880]  i don't know necessarily where to start but just to say that i think as we ring
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:27.480]  in this new year
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:31.920]  i think that there is a bigger disconnect right now
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:35.160]  between what people expect to happen particularly
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:39.120]  uh... in wall street people that manage other people's money and economists you
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:41.880]  know i think there's a bigger disconnect now
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:46.200]  between what people expect to happen what is going to happen
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:49.600]  anything i've seen i think in my career which is saying a lot because it
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:51.880]  certainly includes the dot com bubble
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:55.600]  that burst in two thousand and the real estate bubble that burst at ushered in
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:00.360]  the financial crisis i think people are more clueless today with respect to the
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:03.960]  true state of the u.s economy and what is lying right around the corner
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:09.480]  then they were in nineteen ninety nine and january two thousand rather or january two thousand and eight
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:14.720]  sure there's that famous story of uh... jfk's dad the big stockbroker
[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:17.800]  uh... joseph kennedy and he says he dumped all the stock weeks before the
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:18.600]  crash
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:22.160]  when a shoe shine boy was telling him that the market would never go down and
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.960]  telling him what stocks to buy
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:26.080]  now whether that story is true or not
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:30.560]  i think it's indicative of the type of uh... irrational exuberance use a
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.760]  green spanish and uh... type quote that we see eighteen thousand
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:35.960]  uh... dowell
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:40.000]  what's really behind this and and what are you saying is really coming
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.600]  uh... versus uh... the euphoria
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:45.600]  they know you know a green span is starting to come clean now i guess now
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:47.600]  that he's getting closer to
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:51.400]  and meet his maker he he wants to uh... get a few things off his chest so he's
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:53.040]  starting to criticize
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:56.640]  the federal reserve criticize quantitative easing he's telling people that
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:59.480]  they should buy gold would be great if you can get him as a guest
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:00.720]  guest on your show
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:03.360]  uh... now that he's you know coming back from the dark side
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:06.840]  you know kind of like uh... you know darth vader you know uh... you know
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:08.080]  you can come back
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:08.960]  uh...
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:11.800]  but i think that the real disconnect here
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:12.880]  is that people
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:16.400]  actually believe that what the fed has created
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.240]  is a legitimate economic recovery and that because we have this real
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:22.280]  recovery
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:25.120]  that the fed no longer has to support the economy
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:28.240]  with quantitative easing or zero percent interest rates
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:31.520]  that we can normalize everything no harm no foul
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:35.360]  uh... and the u.s. economy is going to continue to grow the reality is this is
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:39.200]  the fact the fed's biggest bubble ever and i think it's ultimately to be a
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:42.920]  swan song because it may well be the last bubble this could be the bubble
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:47.360]  that finally breaks the dollar despite its recent rally and breaks the fed and
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:48.560]  the confidence
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:52.520]  the misplaced confidence that people have in the fed because they cannot end
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:56.800]  qe they cannot raise interest rates without bringing on a financial crisis
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:00.560]  worse than the one that they caused in two thousand and eight and i think for
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:04.280]  that reason they will not do that i think they are ready to queue up and
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:09.920]  launch qe four to keep the economy from leo relapsing back into recession in
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:13.480]  twenty fifteen and i think that's gonna be a game changer for the markets for
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:18.480]  the dollar for commodities for gold and i think most people are not prepared
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:21.760]  just like they weren't prepared in january two thousand or january two
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:23.640]  thousand and eight
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:27.680]  and you predicted both of those how much bigger do you think this major
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:28.960]  correction
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:31.000]  or bottom will be
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.160]  and will it be smaller than two thousand eight
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:37.400]  well i think it's going to be bigger in the ramifications that it has for
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:41.000]  investors and for the standard of living of most americans
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.360]  i don't know that the stock market is going to be cut in half again
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:48.640]  the way it was in two thousand and eight and two thousand it would be if the
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:53.440]  federal reserve doesn't launch qe four and raises rates then the carnage on
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:58.200]  wall street is going to be as bad maybe even worse than two thousand eight but
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:01.360]  i think the fed is not going to let that happen i think the fed this time
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:05.600]  realizes that this bubble is too big to pop and they're going to do whatever
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:09.080]  they can to prevent it from popping and so what they end up doing is
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:13.840]  sacrificing the dollar in order to prop up the stock market the real estate
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:17.720]  market the u.s. government so i think the impact on the dollar and the dollar
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:21.760]  lost a lot of value between two thousand and two thousand and eight the dollar
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:28.040]  index went from 120 down to 70 it's now managed its way back up to about 91 a lot
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:31.480]  of those gains happened just in the last few months on all this false
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:36.040]  expectations but i think the dollar index is going to decline even more at
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:39.600]  this time around so it's even more important for people to be prepared by
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:43.080]  being out of the dollar you know that that's where the real damage is going
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:47.480]  to come in the real purchasing power of your savings of your investment so
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:51.280]  people need to be cognizant on now about being out of u.s. assets foreign
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:55.120]  stocks precious metals commodities things that will retain their value in
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:59.080]  this inflationary environment that we're going to be living through and that was
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:04.160]  my next question i mean i'm not an economist but i just studied you know
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:08.600]  more than most economists well all i know is bubbles historically are super
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:13.720]  dangerous this infinity bubble that they bet everything on just looks like
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:18.520]  financial armageddon if it ever goes meanwhile china is sinking it looks like
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:22.160]  some evidence shows but you're an expert on that i mean correct me if you don't
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:27.360]  agree we see major problems in russia i see them trying to back off global
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:33.640]  inflation by lowering oil prices but then that causes its own domino effects in
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:38.520]  different economies i just don't see how they're going to manage all of this
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:43.640]  what's the big threat then in the future is it inflation or is it deflation well
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:47.200]  you know when people talk about inflation deflation they're normally
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:52.400]  referring to consumer prices not money supply or credit and so if consumer
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:56.720]  prices were to come down that's never a threat that's always a good thing when
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:01.440]  the price of the things that you need to buy is you know less expensive because
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:05.520]  nobody has an unlimited amount of money except maybe the central bankers and so
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:10.080]  as prices come down we can have a higher standard of living because we can buy
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:13.920]  more stuff like oil prices have come down recently so that means that gas is
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:17.440]  cheaper that means products could be cheaper that require gasoline in the
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:22.640]  production process or the transportation process but when when central
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:25.920]  bankers are talking about deflation they're trying to pretend that they're
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:29.720]  worried about falling consumer prices that's not a concern that that's a good
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:33.720]  thing what they're worried about is financial assets falling they're worried
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:37.720]  about the stock markets coming down the bond markets coming down the real state
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:41.440]  markets coming down because they've been propping those markets up to sustain
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:45.960]  these bubble economies and what they're also worried about is the inability of
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:49.680]  governments to repay their debt and because politicians don't want to
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:53.880]  admit that they're broke and honestly default on their commitments they need
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:58.600]  inflation to wipe out their liabilities and so that's why central bankers are
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:02.640]  concerned we don't have enough inflation is because we have so much debt we need
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:06.560]  the inflation to wipe it out because we don't have the integrity to honestly
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:11.040]  default on commitments that we can't keep so we're not going to have falling
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:15.240]  consumer prices as beneficial as that would be and as temporary as that is
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:18.720]  for oil because I think oil prices are going to go much higher once the Fed
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:22.720]  has to launch QE for unfortunately but we're not going to get falling consumer
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:26.240]  prices we're going to get skyrocketing consumer prices and the average
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:31.080]  American already knows that prices are rising and the government can pretend
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:35.640]  otherwise with these CPI numbers but if you go to the supermarket you know if
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:39.400]  you if you pay well that was my next question is that everything's going up
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.560]  in price except for gas exponentially the last five six years and then open up
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:48.640]  the newspaper or or read the financial online it's like boy prices are dropping
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:52.520]  and everything's great everybody's happy this is really freaking the public
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:56.040]  out because they know that's not true oh I know I mean that's why the
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:00.560]  Republicans unfortunately why they did so well in the last election is just
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:04.360]  because the economy is so miserable voters are just trying to do whatever
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:08.880]  they can to express their frustration they're not necessarily embracing
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:13.120]  Republican principles because a lot of the states that voted Republicans in
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:17.320]  and Democrats out also voted to raise the minimum wage in their state so this
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:20.640]  is just people that are frustrated because there is no legitimate recovery
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:24.600]  and they see the cost of living is going up look all the prices of the things
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:28.300]  that I buy everything is getting more expensive I get you know letters in the

[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:07.280]  we are back Peter Schiff is our guest financial analyst a broker author
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:14.480]  financial commentator manages Euro Pacific capital Inc. and other
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:18.360]  organizations EuroPak.net a lot of interesting information on that site
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:22.600]  certainly and he is our guest today this is a short segment long segment coming
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:28.800]  up with him folks throughout history Zimbabwe, Weimar Republic Germany you
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:33.920]  all know better than I that when they start printing money it causes major
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:40.720]  problems and usually a collapse hyperinflation war you name it now they
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:43.960]  found these ways to manipulate it worldwide and have other currencies
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:48.520]  devalue at the same time but more and more of that inflation is coming home
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:53.080]  and from what I've seen historically Peter correct me if I'm wrong the
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:59.720]  inflation builds at first but slowly and then exponentially it starts compounding
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:03.640]  especially when they try to internationalize the money printing that
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:07.560]  it's more parabolic towards the end of the graph we knew that something would
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:12.000]  happen with QE one two and three it did create like a sugar high as it's been
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:19.440]  called by many more dollars chasing stocks that boost that so it looks good
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.480]  on paper but in the real economy we just talked about it being bad how long in
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:29.840]  your gut can this go on and how do you think the dollar will die will it be
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:34.240]  over time will it be in a big a catastrophe or will it bounce back I
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:38.920]  know you can't predict the future but what are some of the scenarios yeah well
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:42.800]  first of all the real economy has suffered during the entirety of this so
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:46.920]  called recovery it's been a financial recovery yes we've managed to prop up
[02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:51.760]  stock prices and real estate prices but at what cost I think the resources that
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:55.800]  the Fed has misdirected to Wall Street have come at the expense of Main Street
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:59.440]  so instead of making real capital investment growing our productive
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:04.120]  capacity creating high paying jobs for our people we're just enriching a few
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:08.920]  speculators and so real wages are falling real household noteworthy is declining
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:12.800]  full-time jobs are being destroyed they're being replaced by part-time
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:16.680]  jobs the standard of living is going down and and we're disguising it you know
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:21.600]  within this bubble and they can only inflate it so big but what's going on
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:26.920]  with the dollar right now and inflation is because we're not the only country
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:30.440]  that's in trouble and there's politicians all around the world that
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:34.200]  have bought elections with promises they can't keep and people are worried
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:37.800]  about Europe they're worried about Japan they're worried about China and they're
[02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:41.600]  buying the dollar and as a result of that we get a reprieve you know the
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:45.800]  dollar buys more we can borrow more we can spend more and our bubble gets bigger
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.480]  but people who are buying dollars because they're worried about Europe for
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:52.560]  example they're jumping out of the frying pan into the fire they don't
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:56.840]  understand that our problems are even larger than theirs and it's all about
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:01.520]  confidence and one of the reasons that people are confident dollar is because
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:06.280]  they believe that QE is temporary that the Fed has ended it after three times
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:09.680]  and that they're going to raise interest rates but I think that it's pure
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:14.880]  fantasy because I think we have too much debt this bubble is too big that even a
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:19.520]  small increase in interest rates will pop it and then we will have a huge
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:24.680]  financial crisis worse than before and so the Fed is going to continue to revive
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:28.880]  QE remember when they did the first one I said we would have more QEs than
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:33.200]  Rocky movies and so far we've had three and I think we had five or six Rocky
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:36.720]  movies so we have a few more to go but the reason I knew they would have so
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:40.760]  much QE is because I knew it wouldn't work and because it doesn't work because
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:44.800]  it exacerbates the very problems that you're trying to solve the solution is
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:48.560]  always to do more of it and I think when we have to come out with a bigger
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:53.160]  round of QE that could be the beginning of the end of the confidence and you know
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:58.400]  look at what's happening in Russia right now the ruble is down precipitously
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:03.840]  40-50% or so they're responding by raising interest rates short-term
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:08.560]  interest rates in Russia are 17% the Russian economy is slowing down but
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:13.720]  it's not broken they're withstanding 17% interest rates imagine what's going to
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:19.240]  happen in America when there's a loss of confidence in the Fed and the dollar and
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:23.840]  our currency starts to drop what are we going to do to protect it can we raise
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:28.680]  interest rates to 17% like they're doing in Russia not a chance because we have
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:34.400]  so much more debt than we they do we can't afford 17% we can't afford 7% I
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:38.880]  don't even think we can afford 1% so we're really in a bind when the dollar
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:43.040]  goes there's no way to stop it from falling doesn't it become a catch 22
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:48.240]  because the world runs back into the dollar knowing it's the biggest piece
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:52.000]  of the pie of this whole unstable mess but as they run into it that only
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:58.000]  accelerates the establishments leaning towards printing more of it which then
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.640]  in tune just makes the bubble that much bigger I mean it's every bubble is popped
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:07.240]  I mean how big could it potentially get before it's already it's already
[02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:11.840]  enormous but you know as long as people want dollars we can keep creating them
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:14.960]  but what happens where they don't want them anymore and we've created too many
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:18.440]  look that's what happened with real estate they kept building houses as people
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:21.440]  were buying them but then when they didn't want them anymore you had this
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:25.960]  huge supply of houses that nobody could afford and the prices come down well
[02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:30.800]  when nobody wants the dollars anymore and we have an enormous supply of them then
[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:34.840]  you know the bottom drops out and of course what happens is the Fed then
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:39.280]  prints more money as people don't even want the money that's there because we
[02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:42.480]  have all this debt that keeps maturing we have all these short stay there I want
[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:45.680]  to come back and ask you how it unravels what it looks like and then other

[02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:24.240]  to look for next year what you personally are telling all the folks
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:30.360]  wealth whose wealth you manage what are other big issues we face and then
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:36.560]  finishing up maybe now specifically what could trigger the dollar dying what
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:40.800]  would it look like what are some of the scenarios how bad would it be what
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:45.240]  inflation suddenly just explode or what would that look like I think I was
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:49.400]  talking about it a little bit before the break but you know once once it
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:53.360]  changes it does change very rapidly because when the confidence is lost in
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:56.240]  the currency and we've been printing a lot of dollars because people who've
[02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:59.680]  wanted dollars but they wanted them because they didn't understand the
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:02.280]  fundamentals when they figure it out they're not going to want them anymore
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:07.040]  meanwhile we have an enormous supply we have all this debt outstanding and the
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:10.560]  Federal Reserve has been buying a lot of it but there are there has been private
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:16.000]  demand for that debt as well but not private demand is gone the Federal
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.880]  Reserve is not going to start contracting the money supply they're not going to
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:21.920]  start you know reducing the amount of money out there because nobody wants
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:25.800]  dollars anymore it's going to be the opposite as people don't want to buy US
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.760]  treasuries or dollar denominated mortgages the Fed is just going to print
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:33.720]  even more money to buy the bonds that nobody wants but now your increase the
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:38.240]  supply of dollars just as demand for those dollars is going up and then the
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:42.360]  velocity really picks up because anybody who has a dollar wants to get rid of it
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:46.480]  as quickly as possible before it loses value because nobody wants to be left
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:50.280]  ahold in the bag so I think once it accelerates it's not just like a
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:54.080]  snowball rolling down a hill where it just gets bigger gradually all of a
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:58.520]  sudden I think you know you get a lot of snow very very quickly and you can get
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:03.480]  crushed so I think people have to prepare way in advance you know before
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:08.560]  that snowball you know becomes a boulder while they can still do something
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:11.560]  about it but there are a lot of warning signs that you look at the price of oil
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:16.320]  coming down and we can all be happy hey this is great I can go and I can I can
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:21.640]  get some gasoline cheaper but I think this is just an example of what's going
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:27.280]  to happen in asset markets without the help of the Fed because it's not just
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:33.040]  oil prices that were pushed up by cheap money stock prices real estate prices
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:37.480]  bond market what's going to happen when all the markets look like the oil market
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:41.920]  what's going to happen when they all come crashing down like they did in 2008 so
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:46.640]  you know you can be happy now but you have to understand the the reason that
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:51.240]  oil prices are coming down is not good as far as what's going to happen to the
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:56.560]  economy in the short run and you know it didn't stop the big drop in oil prices
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:01.360]  in 2008 didn't stop the great recession it didn't stop the financial crisis we
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:06.160]  still had it even though we had the relief of cheaper gas so I think
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:11.360]  without the Fed doing another round of QE we're gonna see that kind of carnage
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:16.200]  in these other asset markets and you know I think this whole recovery just
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:20.920]  remember the recovery that the Fed built is based on asset bubbles that's the
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:25.840]  foundation of this financial recovery is stock prices going up and real estate
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:31.080]  price prices going up but this is not benefiting the average American the
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:35.160]  average American doesn't own stocks anymore that's why CNBC's ratings just
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:40.040]  hit a new record low in 2014 despite the fact that the stock market is going up
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:44.400]  and home ownership rates just hit a new 20 year low despite the fact that real
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:48.160]  estate prices are going up because the average American can't buy a house even
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:52.360]  with the lowest mortgage rates ever and 3% down payments they're still too
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:57.120]  broke and so most Americans now or more Americans are renting and so the wealth
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:05.360]  is only being you know distributed to a very small a fraction of the population
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:15.880]  what concerns me most Peter is that now we see the paramilitary armored vehicles
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:20.320]  the training the riot training proliferating everywhere and it was
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:24.400]  easy for me to say six seven years ago this is in preparation for economic
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:31.960]  collapse but now the Pentagon and others admit that's what it's for and they're
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:37.800]  using other events as a pretext to kind of condition the public but when the
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:42.200]  government itself is hardening its facilities and storing food and weapons
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:47.320]  and saying well we're afraid of economic disasters that shows that they
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:51.560]  understand they're not in control of this and if other governments in history
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:55.520]  didn't have the computers to manipulate things you know maybe I'm wrong maybe
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:00.280]  they can keep the bubble going forever but that itself is unnatural I mean what
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:04.600]  goes up must come down especially when it's not based on reality and you've
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:10.280]  got China with with with its issues its growth not as big as they thought you've
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:15.760]  got Russia you've got Japan with all its problems it just seems like the United
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:18.720]  States even though we have the world reserve currency can't be isolated
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:25.360]  forever and you add government getting prepared feverishly and and I think
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:29.600]  because the dollar is the words world's reserve currency we've been spared from
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:34.400]  suffering the full consequences of our own profligacy and that's what can't go
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:38.080]  on forever and I think one of the burdens that the global economy is
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:41.880]  bearing right now is supporting the United States you know we just had our
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:46.320]  trade deficit last week and we had our biggest deficit ever in manufactured
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:50.600]  goods so that means the rest of the world has to manufacture goods that we
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:55.480]  consume but we can't afford to pay for there is a big cost to supporting 300
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:41:59.640]  million Americans who collectively are no longer very productive because we're
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:04.000]  involved in all this service sector employment and so many Americans don't
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:08.600]  even work anymore I mean you mentioned that the shrinking labor force participation
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:12.640]  one of the reasons the primary reason that the unemployment rate has come down
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.800]  is because one so many people have left the labor force they've just thrown in
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:20.760]  a towel so they're no longer counted as unemployed but a lot of people had to
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:24.240]  accept part-time jobs in lieu of full-time jobs and so they're not
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:28.240]  counted as being unemployed either but they're underemployed and in fact if you
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:33.040]  look at the people who are getting jobs the the net jobs are going to people who
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:37.920]  are in their 50s and 60s labor force participation among 60 and 70 year olds
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:43.160]  is rising sharply and for 20 and 30 year olds it's collapsing to record lows
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:47.320]  you've got older people who don't want to work who are being forced into part-time
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:52.400]  employment in order to pay the electric bills and then you have Americans in
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:56.800]  their 30s and 40s who need full-time jobs but all they can get is a part-time job
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:00.400]  and the younger people who maybe want a part-time job while they're in school
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:03.920]  they can't even get those jobs because their grandparents have those jobs and
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:07.800]  they get you know they can't compete because they don't have they don't have
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:11.020]  the skills or the experience sure now you've got all these people say well the
[02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:14.440]  solution is to raise the minimum wage because everybody is stuck with a
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:17.400]  minimum wage job that's not going to solve the problem that's just going to
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:21.440]  destroy the minimum wage jobs in fact 20 states were dumb enough to raise their
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:25.720]  minimum wage today and so that's going to make it that much more expensive for
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:29.560]  businesses to hire people in those states and so there's about the same
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:34.440]  explain to people why a minimum wage is a bad idea it never works well because
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:39.640]  you cannot dictate productivity right the government can set a price but they
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:44.400]  can't force anybody to pay that price so when it comes to labor if the government
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:49.040]  wants to say well you've got to pay somebody ten dollars an hour or you can
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:54.160]  hire them well if that person doesn't deliver ten dollars of productivity then
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:58.920]  no employer is going to hire them and so what you do is you make it illegal
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:04.160]  for significant you know percentages of the population to get jobs and the
[02:44:04.160 --> 02:44:09.320]  people who are most affected are younger low skilled workers who desperately
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:12.920]  need a job they need a job and work experience more than they need the money
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:16.920]  because if they can get their foot in the door and actually learn something on
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:21.480]  the job then years later they could make many times the minimum wage but if you
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:25.280]  knock the bottom rung off of the job ladder then millions of people never
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:29.680]  climb on so it's not the entrepreneur or the business owner that suffers it's the
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:33.680]  guy who doesn't get a job who doesn't get a career and of course all consumers
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:37.040]  suffer because they end up paying higher prices for the goods that they buy
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:41.800]  there are you know this is one of the dumbest things you could do and it's
[02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:45.680]  one of the simplest things that you can even explain because it's just basic
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:49.640]  supply and demand everybody knows if you make something more expensive as the
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:54.320]  price goes up the demand goes down so if you make hiring people more expensive
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:57.840]  then fewer people will get hired I mean that's basic economics and you can't
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:01.000]  get around that anymore than you can get around the laws of gravity well that
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:04.840]  takes me my next point you know your dad best-selling author writing about the
[02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:09.360]  Federal Reserve writing about the IRS from a conspiratorial angle look at how
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:13.160]  it's been proven the IRS is persecuting people politically who are libertarian
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:17.560]  Christian or conservative you have always taken the approach of you know it's
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:22.520]  just corrupt forces but you know there's not really a centralized conspiracy but
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:28.560]  from the Cloward and Piven liberal socialist perspective they knew NAFTA
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:33.040]  and GATT weren't really free trade and would actually get rid of our jobs they
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:37.520]  know Obamacare will make tens of millions of people be kicked off full
[02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:42.080]  time to part time they know raising payroll taxes will push people into
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:47.120]  poverty just make them go on welfare they know as you said two plus two
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:53.040]  supply and demand we know what this does so the social engineers I'm not saying
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:56.960]  it's one monolith but they really do want us domesticated they want us
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:46:01.280]  dependent they want us a service economy well that the government always
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:05.280]  wants to create dependencies so that way they can count on your support when
[02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:08.280]  people are bankrupted and the government promises a handout that's what
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:12.160]  Harry Brown used to always say that the government is great at breaking your leg
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:16.040]  and then handing you a crutch and then saying see without me you couldn't walk
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:20.080]  this is the strategy of government but government destroys every industry that
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:24.160]  they infect so it is a conspiracy though well not necessarily conspiracy people
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:28.040]  just acting in their own self-interest politicians want power and since
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:32.200]  unfortunately it's a democracy and not a republic that the power is where the
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:35.800]  votes are and so they need to count on votes and this is what they do like look
[02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:39.520]  at education the government got involved in education and what is the
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:44.200]  consequence look at colleges the value of a college degree has collapsed but the
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:48.360]  price of getting one has skyrocketed and so now because of government we have
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:54.200]  kids 23 24 25 finishing a four-year degree it now takes five or six years to
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:59.080]  get a four-year degree you graduate you got 50 to $100,000 worth of debt and you
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:03.520]  know nothing you majored in some Mickey Mouse liberal arts you know discipline
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:07.560]  and so you learn nothing valuable you have no marketable skills and because
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:11.280]  everybody and their brother has the same worthless degree as you it means
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:15.360]  nothing I was about to say apprenticing I mean in the old days people would go
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:19.280]  worldwide and be an apprentice for a year or two proving how hard they would
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:23.400]  work to then get a good paying or high paying job with that company and many
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:28.240]  times the head of the firms whether it was a factory a law firm brokerage you
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:31.560]  know a hundred other professions carpentry was whoever was the smartest and
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:36.240]  hardest-working lawyers didn't used to go to law school they went and
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:40.040]  apprenticed with another lawyer and then sat in front of the bar so they've
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:45.760]  gotten rid of that completely I mean you try to get interns and even pay them
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:50.840]  they won't do any work Carnegie Mellon Rockefeller billionaires never went to
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:54.560]  college never went to high school but then even graduate elementary school you
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:58.480]  know it used to be very rare in America to go to college if you wanted to be a
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:03.200]  doctor I may you go to college but most people didn't go to college and they
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:07.240]  were able to be very successful whether they had a blue collar career or ended
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:12.360]  up being ahead of a fortune 500 company working their way from the mail room to
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:15.840]  the board room they didn't start in the mail room with a college degree they
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:19.080]  just worked hard and they worked out of that mail room but now you can't even
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.080]  get into the mail room probably without a college degree and even that is
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:25.920]  probably hard but you know I did this video I know if you ever saw it it's on
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:28.960]  YouTube I did it when I was at the New Orleans conference a couple of years
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:32.920]  ago and if you go on YouTube and you type in my name Peter Schiff College you
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:36.240]  can see this five or six minute video where I'm walking around Bourbon Street
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:41.320]  and I'm interviewing all the you know the bartenders and the the pedicab
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:45.400]  drivers and the barkers at the strip clubs and I'm asking them if they went
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:49.040]  to college what their major was you know how much student loans they have and
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:53.640]  just about everybody I talked to was a college grad do needle jobs and this is
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:58.000]  the reality and thank the government for this you know if this is why you know
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:03.480]  they have created this bubble in education in college degrees just like
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:06.600]  they created a bubble in housing we have a bubble you know in the dollar in the
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:10.560]  bond market all this thing collapses I mean it's collapsing now in education
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:14.760]  because you got all these young kids who are now too broke you know they what
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:18.560]  they left home to go to college and now they're right back in home in the same
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:21.920]  bedroom that they grew up in because they're too broke to move out of the
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:24.720]  house even if they get a job they can't make their student loan payments and
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:28.120]  there's no good jobs available because the government is destroy the economy
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:33.160]  exactly and now the answer is more education more debt when all you learn is
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:36.800]  a bunch of political correct garbage but that was the point I was getting at
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:42.600]  is that you used to go to work in companies and the college was learning
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:47.600]  how that company worked and how it operated and then if you performed then
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:52.560]  you would move up but but more and more people with college degrees you name it
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:56.920]  they don't want to work in fact they think doing and so let's not just the
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:50:01.160]  elite here we become a nation of TV heads Peter and I'm really worried about
[02:50:01.160 --> 02:50:05.320]  this country but what you even do at college very little of what you study
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:08.480]  has any relevance to any job that you might be able to get once you graduate
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:13.400]  and most people college is just a five or six year excuse to have a party you
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:17.280]  know you live you know you go to parties and you know you go you know you get
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:21.000]  drunk and you know that's it you don't really learn anything you just go
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:24.600]  through the motions because you've been you've been brainwashed into thinking you
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:28.520]  need to have this diploma and that somehow is your ticket to easy street and
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:32.360]  if you don't have this diploma you know you're gonna be nothing Peter we got a

[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:39.960]  now finishing up other key points you'd like to make other things you think we
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:43.800]  should go over and we see how these bubbles are popping how old folks have
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:48.560]  got to work now we're told it's the best economy ever but a new pullout today by
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:52.000]  Gallup shows the public doesn't trust the government and sees it as the number
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:57.280]  one threat all these lines are coming together what do you see in 2015 2016
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:00.920]  when does your gut tell you the breaking point is and what is that breaking
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:04.480]  point I think the frustration is going to get deeper and deeper because so many
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:07.640]  people know from their own experience that things are getting worse that
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:11.040]  they're trapped in debt that the cost of living is going up their employment
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:14.800]  prospects have diminished yet they keep hearing how great things are and they
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:18.200]  assume that it must be great for somebody else and maybe they think it's the
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:23.320]  rich the 1% and there's a lot of envy in class warfare and a lot of those fires
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:26.840]  are being stoked by by the politicians so it's going to get worse and you know
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:30.960]  there's an example of being careful what you wish for I think the Republicans
[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:36.520]  doing so well and capturing the Senate could come back to hurt us in that it's
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:41.360]  going to allow the Democrats to now run against the Republican-controlled
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:47.640]  Congress when the recovery goes away and the recession resumes in 2015 2016
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:52.400]  now the voters might blame the weak economy on the Republicans in Congress
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:56.000]  rather than the man in the White House so it might make it more difficult to
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:00.280]  recapture that house or maybe even retain the Congress in the 2016 elections
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:03.720]  because people are going to be a lot more pissed off then than they are now
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:07.960]  because the economy is going to be much weaker we may even officially be back in
[02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:13.320]  recession and if if the people buy more of that snake oil if the politicians
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:16.840]  that destroyed the economy benefit from its destruction because they can
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:21.040]  promise more relief in the form of more you know political and monetary snake
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:25.400]  oil that they peddle it doesn't work it could be a very very dangerous dangerous
[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:31.000]  time the London Telegraph has the headline the year of dollar danger for
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:35.920]  the world and it says that there will no longer be an automatic Fed put do you
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:40.000]  agree with that statement what do you think that overall I think the Fed put
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:44.760]  is coming back I do not believe the Fed is going to sit by and allow all the
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:48.720]  bubbles that they work so hard to inflate deflate because they're not going
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:52.280]  to allow stocks to crash they're not going to allow real estate to crash when
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:57.520]  they built this whole phony recovery on those very bubbles see the idea that the
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:01.760]  Fed can stop the stimulus and not collapse the markets is like saying a
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:06.600]  drug addict can stop taking drugs and stay high it is impossible if you want
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:10.480]  the high you need to keep doing the drugs and unfortunately we got the big
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:13.920]  pusher at the Fed and we're going to do these drugs so the dollar is not going
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:18.200]  to go up it's going to collapse we've got a minute and a half left pull out
[02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:22.280]  60% of Republicans want in Congress want Boehner gone
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:27.840]  Obamacare is such a criminal monstrosity I think it's a litmus test if we can't
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:31.440]  repeal this or make the Republicans do it I think the sky is the limit I mean
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:36.680]  Obamacare is so evil as somebody that has 45 people working for me knowing how
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:40.240]  healthcare works my dad's been healthcare management it's so evil that if
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:44.240]  they can keep this in place when it's so unpopular even with Democrats then this
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:48.160]  country's done and it's just getting started I mean remember how house you
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:51.560]  know when they first made these promises about Medicaid or Medicare was
[02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:55.600]  supposed to be so small cost so little and that thing blew up this is a much
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:57:58.960]  bigger experiment than that and it's blowing up you know right out of the
[02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:02.360]  gate I mean so this thing is going to be much bigger I guess the good news is
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:05.680]  the whole economy is going to collapse before we have to deal with a full weight
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:09.520]  of the problems brought about by Obamacare what do you think of them
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:13.520]  pushing Jeb and Hillary again yeah that's yeah that's all we need right there's
[02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:17.320]  another Bush or another Clinton in the White House but unfortunately that might
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:20.880]  be what we get you know it's just gonna be more of the same that you know the
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:25.840]  the players change but the game is the same it's gonna take a real crisis a real
[02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:30.040]  collapse of my and I guess the good news is one's coming and hopefully we get it
[02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:33.240]  over sooner rather than later and we do the right thing in the aftermath all
[02:58:33.240 --> 02:58:37.040]  right well listen I'm glad that you were our first guest of the year Peter will
[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:40.720]  have you back very soon thanks for the time hey anytime happy day everybody and
[02:58:40.720 --> 02:58:44.800]  doing the right thing I guess is letting stuff go down right yeah letting
[02:58:44.800 --> 02:59:08.040]  the free market work that's right see you guys great job
