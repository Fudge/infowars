[01:44.800 --> 01:47.560]  fell on its own even though the government announced they blew it up and
[01:47.560 --> 01:52.520]  then changed their story do you like how 9-11's been used to take your liberties

[02:27.560 --> 02:31.840]  mean I'd like to hear from people who think I'm wrong about the way I see the

[04:36.240 --> 04:41.400]  their terrorist that would be the common government view the way they frame
[04:41.400 --> 04:47.040]  peaceful demonstrations like terrorism now or then there's another perspective

[08:05.320 --> 08:13.360]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:15.720 --> 08:22.360]  this night there was a picture came out last night and it's on the internet this
[08:22.360 --> 08:31.280]  morning and it's a picture of myself with I think the governor of Texas several
[08:31.280 --> 08:34.720]  governors out there was a governor of Texas the truth is that I had never met
[08:34.720 --> 08:40.360]  him before people in the media so I don't believe you how could that be true
[08:40.360 --> 08:44.400]  he's your governor and you both been in business political business for a long
[08:44.400 --> 08:50.000]  time it's true we've never crossed paths so last night we did and the picture
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.720]  of course if you haven't seen it he is very straight at me he has his hand on
[08:57.720 --> 09:13.600]  my arm like he's not gonna let me do this morning we have a call from the
[09:13.600 --> 09:20.360]  boy register what was he saying to you and I said well I'll tell you what when
[09:20.360 --> 09:31.800]  he was saying to me I cannot repeat I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
[09:31.800 --> 09:41.360]  it doesn't matter it'll be on the internet saying it was so bad but the
[09:41.360 --> 09:45.440]  truth is I wish there were a much more interesting story than that because I
[09:45.440 --> 09:53.160]  don't even recall the moment that was occurring and I don't remember if we
[09:53.160 --> 09:58.960]  didn't have any crossword so I'm sorry about that the most challenging words
[09:58.960 --> 10:04.280]  were set on the stage when not only I but others called upon some of the
[10:04.280 --> 10:12.360]  programs in Texas and it's okay so there is what Ron Paul had to say about
[10:12.360 --> 10:16.360]  Rick Perry coming up and grabbing his arm and wagging his finger in his face
[10:16.360 --> 10:25.080]  taking the high road saying he doesn't recall what Perry said to him so there
[10:25.080 --> 10:28.480]  you have it but you can certainly see that Rick Perry is scared of Ron Paul
[10:28.480 --> 10:32.680]  and is scared of Ron Paul pointing out the Hillary Clinton and Al Gore
[10:32.680 --> 10:37.240]  affiliations it's one thing to support Al Gore and be the head of his campaign in
[10:37.240 --> 10:43.400]  Texas in 1988 and then to switch to Republican in 1990 but leopards don't
[10:43.400 --> 10:50.000]  change their spots easily 1993 and 94 energetically giving speeches and
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.400]  writing letters and supporting national government-run single payer
[10:54.400 --> 11:01.000]  health care and the issue here is he isn't a Democrat he's not a Republican
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.240]  he's not a socialist he's not a communist he's not a fascist he's not a
[11:07.240 --> 11:14.360]  Zorro aster he's not a Christian he is a political chameleon who will do
[11:14.360 --> 11:19.280]  whatever it takes to get power very interesting I talked to a good longtime
[11:19.280 --> 11:24.040]  friend who's a prominent businessman here in Austin and I'm not gonna say his
[11:24.040 --> 11:28.120]  name even though he was like no don't say it and he said well yeah you can say
[11:28.120 --> 11:35.400]  it last night I went to dinner with but I'm not going to say the name but he
[11:35.400 --> 11:42.840]  knows Rick Perry very well I didn't know this and he said basically that Rick
[11:42.840 --> 11:48.880]  is is a very competitive climber and basically just wants to be president
[11:48.880 --> 11:54.400]  and to dominate and that's what I've gotten I've run into Perry a few times
[11:54.400 --> 11:58.040]  and he's even been on the show before to call me a big fat ugly sweaty hog and
[11:58.040 --> 12:01.640]  still trying to dig that audio up a lot of you heard it for some reason it was
[12:01.640 --> 12:06.560]  four years ago we can't find it anywhere but anybody can find Rick Perry on
[12:06.560 --> 12:10.160]  Alex Jones show an email it to us that'd be greatly appreciated we play that
[12:10.160 --> 12:13.520]  my crew all of them tried and failed I tried and failed to find it again
[12:13.520 --> 12:24.440]  who's go but the issue is that I was told by this businessman that Rick Perry
[12:24.440 --> 12:33.080]  would give him anti-New World Order books in 1998-99 when he was still
[12:33.080 --> 12:38.160]  agriculture commissioner and about to run for governor that Rick Perry would
[12:38.160 --> 12:44.520]  give him anti-globalist anti-New World Order books and that they would work out
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.960]  together at the country club you know I'm not gonna get into too much more of the
[12:48.960 --> 12:56.880]  story but Rick Perry and of course this person is known to folks on the show but
[12:56.880 --> 13:00.440]  I again I'm not I'll just leave it at that if ever wants to tell the story on
[13:00.440 --> 13:06.640]  air then he's welcome to he told me more about Perry it was nothing nothing
[13:06.640 --> 13:21.760]  really bombshell but just that I'm just gonna shut up right there Rick Perry
[13:21.760 --> 13:30.280]  giving him anti-New World Order books that's what's so bad about Rick Perry
[13:30.280 --> 13:36.880]  that's why he told a Fox News individual well-known to everyone almost a year and
[13:36.880 --> 13:43.560]  a half ago at a tea party event in Dallas that he got him in the green room
[13:43.560 --> 13:46.600]  and said I there's two people I'm afraid of he said three at the time he said
[13:46.600 --> 13:50.560]  Ron Paul Alex Jones and then and this governor's race Debra Medina but he said
[13:50.560 --> 13:54.840]  I'm scared of Ron Paul and Alex Jones those are the two main ones and then
[13:54.840 --> 13:59.720]  out of the other is a caveat he's afraid of people that know who he is Rick
[13:59.720 --> 14:05.760]  Perry knows all this stuff I was talking to my friend and he said we would have
[14:05.760 --> 14:11.560]  long discussions about it Rick Perry's giving people anti-New World Order books
[14:11.560 --> 14:17.640]  and then he's running around trying to give forced inoculations going to
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.240]  Bilderberger at meetings handing over trying to hand over 8,000 miles of
[14:21.240 --> 14:27.400]  Texas roads to the globalist Texas power companies this is a guy like Alan
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.720]  Greenspan you don't have to hear this is some story with a radio talk show host
[14:32.720 --> 14:38.800]  telling you about how you know a print told me this about Rick Perry this Alan
[14:38.800 --> 14:44.520]  Greenspan wrote essays published news articles what the Wall Street Journal in
[14:44.520 --> 14:49.160]  places Harry Brown one of the first libertarian books I read in high school
[14:49.160 --> 14:55.600]  had a giant chapter I'd say about a third of the book what is it I forget
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.560]  which was it's a compilation fact guys search it for me Alan Greenspan's
[14:59.560 --> 15:05.200]  anti-fellow reserve writings in Harry Brown's book or Alan Greenspan
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.120]  writings in Harry Brown book Brown put out a compilation book of like five or
[15:10.120 --> 15:15.600]  six people himself but the point is it sounds like it sounds like Ron Paul see
[15:15.600 --> 15:21.040]  see Ron Paul got all the offers to join the establishment he was sent to
[15:21.040 --> 15:25.300]  Congress he got in as a libertarian one of the only ever elected as a
[15:25.300 --> 15:33.880]  libertarian that's a big deal Ron Paul knew Greenspan Ron Paul Ron Paul was in
[15:33.880 --> 15:40.880]  the late 70s running with this whole crew and he didn't sell out but Alan
[15:40.880 --> 15:47.320]  Greenspan sold out and then in later date Ronald Reagan I know people that
[15:47.320 --> 15:49.480]  know Ronald Reagan in fact I've interviewed famous people that knew
[15:49.480 --> 15:54.440]  Ronald Reagan he was handing out John Birch Society literature Ronald Reagan
[15:54.440 --> 15:59.560]  was running around talking about the New World Order he had been a communist
[15:59.560 --> 16:06.320]  that's on record woke up became more of a Republican conservative and then as a
[16:06.320 --> 16:10.800]  governor what literally sat around at his ranch talking about the New World
[16:10.800 --> 16:14.720]  Order and the elites and then in speeches actually we have clips of this
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.200]  in Jason Burmese's film Invisible Empire George Herbert Walker Bush running
[16:19.200 --> 16:22.600]  against Reagan having to respond to the Trialateral Commission World
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.760]  Government stuff and George Herbert Walker laughing at Reagan so I mean
[16:28.760 --> 16:32.160]  they're all just humans and you know a lot of this is you get in a powerful
[16:32.160 --> 16:36.280]  position you have enemies and the only way you can beat your enemies is by
[16:36.280 --> 16:41.320]  joining the dark side or that's that's that's what they see they're like I'm
[16:41.320 --> 16:45.680]  tired of it I'm a better man than these guys I'm smarter I'm gonna beat them by
[16:45.680 --> 16:51.100]  by by by by compromising a little bit and then the minute you start
[16:51.100 --> 16:55.600]  compromising it's like the ring of doom in Lord of the Rings you know when the
[16:55.600 --> 16:59.800]  hobbits try to give it to Gandalf and in you can defeat any enemy with it and
[16:59.800 --> 17:04.760]  Gandalf says no do not offer that to me I would try to use that for good and it
[17:04.760 --> 17:15.920]  cannot be you cannot use the ring of power you cannot try to use evil to then
[17:15.920 --> 17:21.480]  do good the minute you start down that road oh it works at first works very
[17:21.480 --> 17:28.520]  well but in the end it will destroy you but just to hear about Rick Perry
[17:28.520 --> 17:40.960]  constantly talking about the New World Order and globalism and things and to to
[17:40.960 --> 17:46.040]  know that he knows all this now see Reagan got in and was really trying to
[17:46.040 --> 17:49.920]  put in place what he believed in and he got shot then they took him to a
[17:49.920 --> 17:54.160]  military base they basically from a lot of big sources we know they gave him
[17:54.160 --> 17:58.000]  cold blood which can really you know cause brain damage but they started
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.640]  drugging him and reportedly they would keep him he twice slept most the time
[18:01.640 --> 18:06.040]  it wasn't seen and they would get him on other drugs to wake him up and then
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.880]  rolling out with cue cards so the and it's really easy with an older person
[18:11.880 --> 18:16.800]  the word is after he was shot and in the hospital for a few weeks under
[18:16.800 --> 18:22.040]  military control Ronald Reagan basically rolled out under mind control and by
[18:22.040 --> 18:27.760]  mind control I mean kind of addled confused a cocktail of drugs where just
[18:27.760 --> 18:30.760]  like McVay they get him drugged up for court and then let him go off the drugs
[18:30.760 --> 18:34.000]  then for another interview getting drugged up and confusing and then
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.280]  rolling back out but you can give somebody amnesics I could drop in a
[18:38.280 --> 18:43.480]  halcyon in somebody's drink out here and in 45 minutes they wouldn't know where
[18:43.480 --> 18:47.680]  they were and I could basically give him a script and have him say whatever I
[18:47.680 --> 18:53.400]  wanted and then three hours later they wouldn't remember what they did I mean
[18:53.400 --> 18:56.720]  that's your basic mind control because because because Reagan would snap back in
[18:56.720 --> 19:00.520]  and snap back out I remember seeing old interviews with him and when he'd be
[19:00.520 --> 19:05.640]  caught off guard I mean he was just completely out of it at that point all
[19:05.640 --> 19:08.640]  right I said I was going to take calls today and then we get into all the news
[19:08.640 --> 19:15.640]  it's just that I thought I'd tell that I thought I'd tell that Rick Perry story you
[19:15.640 --> 19:19.640]  know perhaps before my friend leaves town again perhaps I should try to get him
[19:19.640 --> 19:23.280]  on there to talk about Rick Perry's I think was really interesting stories so
[19:23.280 --> 19:27.640]  you just hear it from him but but again he's like oh no I'm not going to do it
[19:27.640 --> 19:31.120]  well maybe I should well it was a private club but well it wasn't in
[19:31.120 --> 19:36.480]  confidence well so we'll we'll see what happens with that okay I need to hit the
[19:36.480 --> 19:40.280]  fact that stocks dropped sharply amid uncertainty after Obama's job speech last
[19:40.280 --> 19:47.920]  night also the union group taking over and holding people hostage and then the
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.520]  media is like well that's reasonable so so we're gonna analyze that a little bit
[19:51.520 --> 19:55.800]  and then I promise bottom of the hour it's only about 13 14 minutes away when

[22:51.200 --> 23:00.240]  it's an info war the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984 what you're
[23:00.240 --> 23:04.320]  about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight
[23:04.320 --> 23:09.840]  by becoming hormonally balanced again I lost 20 pounds I lost 40 pounds I lost
[23:09.840 --> 23:16.400]  55 pounds I went from a size 14 to a size 8 their secret is amber in the
[23:16.400 --> 23:21.640]  revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally the
[23:21.640 --> 23:25.960]  leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance until you balance
[23:25.960 --> 23:30.000]  your hormones losing weight can be practically impossible but amber in
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.640]  restores hormonal balance naturally so the weight can just fall right off even
[23:34.640 --> 23:38.920]  that stubborn belly fat plus amber in eliminates other symptoms of hormonal
[23:38.920 --> 23:43.760]  aging like hot flashes night sweats low libido difficulty concentrating and

[24:13.240 --> 24:16.680]  they certainly have
[24:17.520 --> 24:22.920]  okay after I take a whole bunch of calls I'm gonna get into world-entering
[24:22.920 --> 24:28.280]  dangerous new phase the new head of the International Monetary Fund said of
[24:28.280 --> 24:32.200]  course it's a new phase of power consolidation for them so they are now
[24:32.200 --> 24:38.280]  going to basically fear monger the population into giving them more power
[24:38.280 --> 24:43.280]  and establishing this private economic dictatorship over Europe that's already
[24:43.280 --> 24:50.320]  in control of the United States ancient meteorites showered earth with gold
[24:50.320 --> 24:56.800]  study finds NBC they've done these different scientific scans of gold and
[24:56.800 --> 25:02.680]  find that it's not of this earth and is younger well no kidding the earth is
[25:02.680 --> 25:07.640]  part of the larger universe and so gold most gold is actually meteorite
[25:07.640 --> 25:15.920]  deposits how how interesting is that continuing pensioners turned back to
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.760]  living off the land in Greece because things have imploded so bad under
[25:19.760 --> 25:27.120]  banker takeover austerity a wealthy cultured nation with great tourism
[25:27.120 --> 25:30.600]  suddenly overnight they're they're they're poppers because their government
[25:30.600 --> 25:34.760]  signed them on to the derivatives the bankers created the ball and chain they
[25:34.760 --> 25:38.800]  created instead of the bankers going to jail they take over but the people are
[25:38.800 --> 25:42.840]  now trying and succeeding getting back to the land and all this farmland not
[25:42.840 --> 25:45.760]  being used is now being used and of course the government wants to come in
[25:45.760 --> 25:50.200]  and tax even private food grown for yourself that's why that there's a
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.160]  crackdown on the underground markets here in the United States even if they're
[25:55.160 --> 25:59.720]  considered always to be legal and lawful it's like no no no no we want you
[25:59.720 --> 26:04.520]  dependent on us as we shut things down for social engineering purposes because
[26:04.520 --> 26:09.280]  as things get worse and you're dependent on us you'll do whatever we say this is
[26:09.280 --> 26:15.040]  the process that's going on and obviously stocks are falling right now
[26:15.040 --> 26:19.360]  we'll continue to watch that but longshoremen in Washington storm a
[26:19.360 --> 26:25.480]  railroad facility port facility and it says six guards were held hostage for a
[26:25.480 --> 26:29.880]  couple of hours after 500 a more longshoremen broke down gates at 430
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.920]  a.m. and smashed windows in the guard shack he said no one was hurt but nobody
[26:33.920 --> 26:38.480]  has been arrested most of the protesters protesters see now when you think of
[26:38.480 --> 26:42.440]  protesters think of folks with hostages see they'll use a term lesser than what's
[26:42.440 --> 26:46.440]  actually happening to something that's reasonable to then in the minds of
[26:46.440 --> 26:52.120]  people infect the term protester with holding hostages it's what they'll call
[26:52.120 --> 26:57.000]  a suicide bomber an extremist then they can legally call me an extremist in the
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.560]  news but it has the suicide bomber connotation see it's all word manipulation
[27:01.560 --> 27:08.000]  most of the protesters returned to their union hall after cutting break lines
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.560]  at spilling grain from a car at the egt terminal and it goes on to say that the
[27:14.560 --> 27:17.960]  police were threatened with baseball bats I've seen the video and the cops
[27:17.960 --> 27:21.920]  back down when they lines there was only one copters I've seen photos with a
[27:21.920 --> 27:27.840]  whole bunch of cops and they back down now now it I've seen in in Washington
[27:27.840 --> 27:32.160]  state and other areas peaceful people at demonstrations and cops come I guess it
[27:32.160 --> 27:37.560]  was in Oregon south of there and spray mace in a big can into the baby carriage
[27:37.560 --> 27:41.000]  and Legos why'd you do that he goes you shouldn't bring a bleep and baby to a
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.560]  protest you know they tell them disperse unpermitted and so the peaceful
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.120]  people start going down this road and they block them in and start beating them
[27:50.120 --> 27:58.880]  so see why would the cops let people take hostages attack things and then it's
[27:58.880 --> 28:01.680]  like all they took some hostages they're just protesters nobody's gotten in
[28:01.680 --> 28:08.440]  trouble and they say the police aren't going to do anything why is that
[28:09.600 --> 28:14.840]  well there's a lot of reasons but it's because Obama is big in with the unions
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.720]  and so the word has gone down leave them alone now whether you support what
[28:19.720 --> 28:25.000]  the unions did and see it is like the Tea Party 1776 or if you think they're
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.240]  terrorists there's different views of this they certainly are getting special
[28:29.240 --> 28:34.680]  treatment so you have to ask yourself why is that why is that is it because the
[28:34.680 --> 28:37.960]  government doesn't want to start start a spark yeah they don't want to start a
[28:37.960 --> 28:42.040]  spark with this group with the unions they want the unions to think that the
[28:42.040 --> 28:45.520]  government's their friend while they deindustrialize while they ship the
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.120]  jobs overseas you know most the union support open borders and low wage
[28:50.120 --> 28:54.280]  people coming in unlimited well that's what's really one of the biggest things
[28:54.280 --> 29:00.000]  driving down your your wages so see they just want to play unions and private
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.080]  companies off against each other so the private companies just leave and go
[29:03.080 --> 29:08.040]  overseas why they put up with being raided or put up with the unions or put
[29:08.040 --> 29:12.560]  up with what happened to Gibson guitar so see it's a very complex issue I like
[29:12.560 --> 29:15.680]  the fact that there are some counter balancing unions I think there is a
[29:15.680 --> 29:24.200]  place for unions people's right to collectively organize but it always gets
[29:24.200 --> 29:28.800]  abused and always gets co-opted I mean I look at where your union dues go
[29:28.800 --> 29:33.280]  universally it pretty much goes to take my guns take my private property get
[29:33.280 --> 29:37.280]  rid of my country and then you guys get upset when your country falls apart and
[29:37.280 --> 29:42.600]  blame some private company and then you're allowed to go take people hostage
[29:42.600 --> 29:50.040]  and if you'd adjust up the grain out I'd say 1776 but taking hostages we're on
[29:50.040 --> 30:00.720]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a very

[35:02.080 --> 35:08.000]  he won the poll so many MSNBC and NBC articles don't even mention Ron Paul

[35:40.200 --> 35:45.840]  ever since and it's a circus act down here right now there's everybody running
[35:45.840 --> 35:51.200]  around they're hyping up all of their it's a police state basically we have
[35:51.200 --> 35:55.800]  six checkpoints going to work today six checks point going home they are
[35:55.800 --> 35:59.880]  running around frantic they have police boats in the harbors telling everybody
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.600]  that you know they're about to attack my take on this is that they have
[36:04.600 --> 36:08.680]  everything in place to have an attack because they're out of bullets so when
[36:08.680 --> 36:12.840]  they do attack all very convenient that the subways were shut down a few weeks
[36:12.840 --> 36:17.280]  ago for that forest with the hurricane and when they do something it's gonna
[36:17.280 --> 36:22.080]  have to be more spectacular than what they pulled on 9-11 well there's no
[36:22.080 --> 36:26.880]  doubt that if a government the people running our government have been caught
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.360]  nerve-gassing our own troops spraying radiological on them biologicals
[36:31.360 --> 36:37.920]  killing them in thousands of different studies adding all sorts of
[36:37.920 --> 36:42.360]  sterilants to vaccines shooting little kids up all over the world but syphilis
[36:42.360 --> 36:47.520]  and polio I mean this is all admitted and people go but it's it's it's crazy to
[36:47.520 --> 36:51.440]  think that they would stage a terror attack and well no it's not and then
[36:51.440 --> 36:54.200]  you're like well they created al-qaeda they use them against the Serbs the
[36:54.200 --> 36:59.840]  Russians they've given them control of Libya the head of the US Embassy said
[36:59.840 --> 37:03.360]  they were ordered to let the hijackers back in the US even though they were in
[37:03.360 --> 37:07.480]  the terror database because quote that was their cover and they told the US
[37:07.480 --> 37:11.720]  Embassy they work for us and then the government gets mutalib the underwear
[37:11.720 --> 37:16.440]  bomber on Christmas Day on the plane we tell you that from eyewitnesses a month
[37:16.440 --> 37:23.760]  before the deputy secretary of state Kennedy comes out and says yes we were
[37:23.760 --> 37:30.120]  ordered by an unnamed US intelligence agency to do this I mean folks this this
[37:30.120 --> 37:35.560]  gets announced and then it just gets glazed over it's like yeah and we're all
[37:35.560 --> 37:39.560]  the locky number three in al-qaeda some say number one hanging out at the Pentagon
[37:39.560 --> 37:44.400]  when he's on the most wanted list and secret meetings no big deal oh you you
[37:44.400 --> 37:48.400]  want to sue and you know judicial watcher other groups want to know his
[37:48.400 --> 37:52.240]  travel records from the State Department no for his privacy you don't get to have
[37:52.240 --> 37:58.480]  that I mean all of the hijackers living at military bases or FBI paying for
[37:58.480 --> 38:04.040]  their houses and I'll sit there with these reporters from Nightline and MSNBC
[38:04.040 --> 38:11.240]  and and and and slate and and Rolling Stone and all of it and I'll say do you
[38:11.240 --> 38:16.080]  really here here let me show you where the hijackers live we're living at
[38:16.080 --> 38:19.080]  military bases let me show you where the head of the US Embassy said they were
[38:19.080 --> 38:21.840]  ordered to let them in let me show and they just go no I don't want to look at
[38:21.840 --> 38:25.880]  it and then I'll say but but you're but you don't agree with me that it could
[38:25.880 --> 38:29.080]  be an inside job no it's just crazy the government wouldn't do something like
[38:29.080 --> 38:32.560]  that yeah but look but look at Gulf of Tonkin well that wasn't as big it didn't
[38:32.560 --> 38:37.000]  kill anybody yeah but it led to 58,000 dead Americans 300 something thousand
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.240]  wounded disabled arms legs gone faces gone eyeballs gone testicles gone
[38:42.240 --> 38:48.160]  everything else gone and a million dead Vietnamese and it just goes on I go look
[38:48.160 --> 38:51.040]  at what other governments have done over and over again and they just won't
[38:51.040 --> 38:56.000]  listen or sometimes I go okay well admit to me reporter admit to me reporter
[38:56.000 --> 39:03.280]  that at least government has used us to take our rights and they'll go yeah I
[39:03.280 --> 39:07.840]  guess they kind of have that it doesn't matter in the final equation it's been
[39:07.840 --> 39:12.800]  used to take our liberties it doesn't keep us safe and I could go on and on and
[39:12.800 --> 39:17.160]  on and on and it's not fun to get up here and say 9-11's an inside job but
[39:17.160 --> 39:22.320]  you know what we don't have a future if we don't face facts okay it's synthetic
[39:22.320 --> 39:26.040]  terror they are financing the radical Muslims and you know I was on Mancow
[39:26.040 --> 39:29.440]  this morning and I appreciate I appreciate your call ma'am good to
[39:29.440 --> 39:34.040]  hear from you I was on Mancow this morning and and I was bringing up
[39:34.040 --> 39:37.200]  Amaral Locky at the Pentagon and I was bringing up you know trying to bring up
[39:37.200 --> 39:42.080]  the underwear bomber and all the rest of it and he was having to admit that Al
[39:42.080 --> 39:45.080]  Qaeda has been given control of the beginning he's like I you know I do see
[39:45.080 --> 39:49.720]  in project gun runner you know to blame the Second Amendment fashion furious
[39:49.720 --> 39:54.240]  I'm starting to get you and I said yeah even Chuck Norris you know is waking up
[39:54.240 --> 39:57.800]  and he goes oh well he's the authority got to go Alex you know that was the end
[39:57.800 --> 40:01.840]  of the interview and I meant to go on and say Chuck Norris you know who's made
[40:01.840 --> 40:05.600]  all these movies about the Muslims being the ultimate devil and drilling our
[40:05.600 --> 40:09.000]  troops kneecaps because they're evil torturers but our government's good
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.560]  torturing and Chuck Norris this icon of you know get the Muslim extremist and
[40:14.560 --> 40:19.360]  and and Chuck Norris is finally saying who's a good guy he means well two plus
[40:19.360 --> 40:22.880]  two equals four he's good on the Second Amendment sovereignty and things like
[40:22.880 --> 40:31.320]  that but he likes the woodchuck Chuck could be another fake slick guy and it's
[40:31.320 --> 40:34.040]  Chuck's been listing he's told me for 16 years since the beginning of the show he
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.920]  started he's got a couple ranches you can hear the show one of our affiliates we
[40:37.920 --> 40:41.800]  had years ago but you know talk talking to Chuck Norris it wasn't oh well Chuck
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.080]  Norris says so you know who's the boogeyman afraid of who does he look
[40:46.080 --> 40:51.440]  under the bed for Chuck Norris that's the variant you know when fascism goes
[40:51.440 --> 40:54.600]  asleep what is it afraid of what's it look under the bed for Ron Paul you know
[40:54.600 --> 40:57.800]  we have that have that t-shirt if you want to spread the word about Ron Paul
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.760]  and also support our operation that's available at info wars.com but the
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.400]  issue is even Chuck Norris wrote a big article and quoted info wars.com in
[41:06.400 --> 41:09.920]  world at Daily Town Hall it's syndicate a column and a bunch of newspapers across
[41:09.920 --> 41:17.240]  the country millions of readers and he you know he said our government's helping
[41:17.240 --> 41:20.780]  Al Qaeda our government's financing them and our government's rebranding
[41:20.780 --> 41:27.280]  terrorism on to the American people and mainly white people and people say oh
[41:27.280 --> 41:30.320]  you're being racist saying that it's branded to whites no no no the ad is
[41:30.320 --> 41:38.200]  branding it to whites we're reporting on the racial branding and Chuck Norris
[41:38.200 --> 41:43.920]  sees that I mean you finally get it it's fun and tribal to get upset at people
[41:43.920 --> 41:48.120]  that don't look like us and then they've got big beards and are basically the
[41:48.120 --> 41:52.080]  equivalent of you know Middle Eastern rednecks I mean you actually act a lot
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.880]  of the same like guns you know the whole nine yards they're people just like us
[41:56.880 --> 42:02.080]  and if you go back 50 years the State Department's on record paying up until a
[42:02.080 --> 42:05.880]  decade ago for textbooks all over the Middle East and in North Africa and
[42:05.880 --> 42:10.920]  Central Asia radicalizing the jihadist and the line was is a
[42:10.920 --> 42:18.520]  bullwork against communism you know our government the social engineers took the
[42:18.520 --> 42:22.600]  most radical forms of Islam and supercharged them and used them to put
[42:22.600 --> 42:26.440]  them in power all over the Middle East in the 50s 60s and 70s because they didn't
[42:26.440 --> 42:31.040]  want secular leaders there with golf courses in big hotels and I mean you
[42:31.040 --> 42:35.480]  know the Arabs all those people they want civilization you know they had it
[42:35.480 --> 42:41.320]  4,000 years ago they invented a lot of our sciences so it what did the British
[42:41.320 --> 42:45.320]  do they went and got warlike better ones that were basically like cowboys
[42:45.320 --> 42:50.840]  while while West folks and gave them billions of dollars in today's numbers
[42:50.840 --> 42:55.640]  of weapons systems to go take over five or six different countries and turn into
[42:55.640 --> 43:00.560]  one nation and they went in and totally set up a society and they were the ones
[43:00.560 --> 43:07.640]  that said now a hood's going over your head you know before it was rich women
[43:07.640 --> 43:12.120]  who didn't want men in the market freaking out over really beautiful rich
[43:12.120 --> 43:15.720]  women would have servants with them and they would have a thin veil just like
[43:15.720 --> 43:18.920]  veils were in a hundred two hundred years ago for women here they're
[43:18.920 --> 43:23.640]  delicate white skin same that's been in style for thousands years or yeah or
[43:23.640 --> 43:26.920]  whatever color their skin was they they don't want sun on it and so women would
[43:26.920 --> 43:30.640]  have a veil in the hot hundred and twenty degree temperature if they went
[43:30.640 --> 43:36.960]  out they would have gloves on but the British went in and said no women aren't
[43:36.960 --> 43:41.560]  going to college you're gonna wear bags over your head and and and again then
[43:41.560 --> 43:46.960]  use that whole threat to then menace the West and say we're taking your rights
[43:46.960 --> 43:51.040]  away because these crazy people are coming to get you I mean this is how it
[43:51.040 --> 43:54.440]  really works then they play us off against each other and the bankers
[43:54.440 --> 43:59.720]  destroy both Christendom and Islam at the same time what Albert Pike wrote
[43:59.720 --> 44:05.160]  about in 1878 the Illuminati okay I said I take a lot of calls I'm not doing it
[44:05.160 --> 44:09.160]  let's go to Julio in Illinois we're talking about ten years later 9-11 your
[44:09.160 --> 44:14.520]  views on the whole thing go ahead Julio welcome Alex pleasure speaking to you as
[44:14.520 --> 44:20.560]  always 9-11 man that can't believe it's already been ten years I was 11 years
[44:20.560 --> 44:26.240]  old when the false flag attacks took place and I remember one thing
[44:26.240 --> 44:31.720]  specifically from that day I come home from school thank goodness my school
[44:31.720 --> 44:36.360]  didn't allow us to watch any of that propaganda on TV so I didn't get filled
[44:36.360 --> 44:41.720]  with that propaganda from the beginning but I remember watching building seven
[44:41.720 --> 44:48.160]  collapse live on ABC and I remember thinking how weird that was just because
[44:48.160 --> 44:52.280]  you know all throughout that day what what did we hear oh you know you know the
[44:52.280 --> 44:55.640]  Twin Towers got hit you know Pennsylvania and the Pentagon and whatnot so
[44:55.640 --> 45:00.120]  remember seeing building seven you know collapse and then and the reporters were
[45:00.120 --> 45:03.920]  down there yeah again I heard it on radio TV and the clips later did surface
[45:03.920 --> 45:07.440]  that I'd seen people dug them out people found them in digital archives and
[45:07.440 --> 45:11.040]  they kept saying well seven's gonna fall in its own footprint and the
[45:11.040 --> 45:14.040]  government may blow it up and then yeah they're getting ready to bring it down
[45:14.040 --> 45:18.000]  and then oh it's already falling when it hadn't fallen because the cops were
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.040]  having to be the cops weren't part of it so the government had to tell the cops
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.960]  the feds did and the firemen get back we're bringing it down so cops went to
[45:26.960 --> 45:29.840]  media and said they're getting ready to bring it down then the feds got behind
[45:29.840 --> 45:32.760]  blowing it up and so it's like well they said they're gonna blow it up and they
[45:32.760 --> 45:36.800]  came back and said it fell but we didn't blow it up I mean we have them on seven
[45:36.800 --> 45:40.320]  we have the cops saying get back they're getting ready to bring it down I mean we
[45:40.320 --> 45:46.520]  have them on CNN they we have the blast squibs and when Barry Jennings came out
[45:46.520 --> 45:49.520]  and said yeah they blew up the building you notice he died a month later but he
[45:49.520 --> 45:53.320]  was the deputy head of emergency management I mean I'm sorry go ahead sir
[45:53.320 --> 45:57.800]  now just doing all the research being awake the last couple of years in
[45:57.800 --> 46:03.240]  college just seeing what we're seeing right now with the preparatory phase for
[46:03.240 --> 46:07.360]  another false flag the exact same thing happened on 9-11 I remember I did a
[46:07.360 --> 46:14.760]  report in school and I found Operation El Malcom Virgo June of 2001 with the CIA
[46:14.760 --> 46:19.280]  asset Osama bin Laden on the cover and on that document it specifically stated
[46:19.280 --> 46:23.240]  about hijacking planes and going into buildings I mean this was a couple of
[46:23.240 --> 46:29.040]  months before 9-11 now and then the CIA ran drills of the Pentagon and the
[46:29.040 --> 46:34.160]  World Trade Centers being hit by planes a year before six months before a
[46:34.160 --> 46:37.120]  couple months before and then the day of the event and then we have the air
[46:37.120 --> 46:41.040]  traffic controller tapes going get the simulations of the drill off my screen
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.240]  it's confusing me that's how they got nor had everybody to stand down as they
[46:45.240 --> 46:50.600]  were told it's a drill it's a drill sorry go ahead no no worries Alex just
[46:50.600 --> 46:54.200]  looking at all the preparatory phase right now for for false flag as the
[46:54.200 --> 46:58.960]  first woman mentioned a few moments ago they're gonna have to do something worse
[46:58.960 --> 47:04.880]  than 9-11 and you know I'm hearing Steve Quayle talk a lot about the possible
[47:04.880 --> 47:09.280]  biological attack and you know I see I mentioned this on your show a couple
[47:09.280 --> 47:13.360]  months ago how the University of Illinois Chicago received a grant a couple
[47:13.360 --> 47:18.560]  million dollars to make an anthrax viruses you hear about this is this is
[47:18.560 --> 47:22.400]  crazy Alex this is really 1984 state the last 10 years we're living in the new
[47:22.400 --> 47:25.840]  world order oh absolutely and they've got they've got all these movies really I
[47:25.840 --> 47:29.640]  appreciate your call all these movies coming out about the plague is coming
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.360]  take your shots the plague is coming and this is a military industrial complex
[47:34.360 --> 47:39.760]  banking pharma system that is obsessed with putting the stuff in vaccines
[47:39.760 --> 47:44.800]  water food obsessed with giving people autoimmune diseases and neurological
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.840]  problems and I mean we we just oh this is a system that's been caught over and
[47:49.840 --> 47:53.920]  over again trying to hurt people through the vaccines here let me go take a
[47:53.920 --> 47:59.200]  shot and by the way I hadn't gotten to that yet here is Prince Charles London
[47:59.200 --> 48:03.760]  telegraph he gave a big speech mankind faces extinction the Prince of Wales is
[48:03.760 --> 48:07.320]  warned unless humans transform our lifestyles to stop mass consumption
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.840]  runaway climate change and destruction of wildlife now that the elite are
[48:12.840 --> 48:16.880]  running pale male for a power grab with genetic engineering toxic waste dumping
[48:16.880 --> 48:20.800]  they could care less but then they always claim they care about the
[48:20.800 --> 48:24.720]  environment to get us to give up control of our private property to let them into
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.280]  our houses the green police the control the selective enforcement but see it's a
[48:29.280 --> 48:33.840]  self-fulfilling prophecy when they release bioplegs that only kill a few
[48:33.840 --> 48:38.760]  hundred million then everybody locks down does what they're told they're
[48:38.760 --> 48:42.360]  saying the biopleg is coming because of global warming you'll be taught it's
[48:42.360 --> 48:47.760]  your fault then you'll take all the shots they say to protect yourself even
[48:47.760 --> 48:52.200]  though it kills a lot of people oh it's it's still worth it you know this guy
[48:52.200 --> 48:55.480]  didn't get vaccinated he spread it to a bunch of people so you don't have a
[48:55.480 --> 49:01.800]  choice then they set that precedent to force inoculate okay and then once
[49:01.800 --> 49:08.760]  that's in place then the big mega attacks come and they are just getting
[49:08.760 --> 49:14.920]  this big police state in place world government is the extermination pin
[49:14.920 --> 49:20.200]  world government is only the guillotine once the world government's finished the
[49:20.200 --> 49:28.320]  head goes in the guillotine by the way Rob do had to go to a funeral and he
[49:28.320 --> 49:31.160]  gave me an article of the day and I sent it to Kurt and everything two days ago
[49:31.160 --> 49:36.200]  and it was about was it in Phoenix they had live explosives in a drill and they
[49:36.200 --> 49:40.800]  got lost and that looked to me like an attempted false flag and I mean this is
[49:40.800 --> 49:44.080]  coming in so fast that I can't even keep track of it all anymore and I forgot to
[49:44.080 --> 49:52.000]  even I forgot to even cover that and I can run around everybody and guys guys
[49:52.000 --> 49:58.000]  go to the search engine security test live explosives lost at airport live
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.720]  explosives lost at airport search that for me that was three days ago my
[50:01.720 --> 50:05.120]  goodness I didn't even because it was like eight o'clock at night we done the
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.000]  TV show dudes like look at this and I'm like I am at the memo and Watson they
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.320]  may have done something I never saw it and it got no attention nobody talked
[50:12.320 --> 50:17.160]  about it and I again I just can't even keep track of it all anymore but here's
[50:17.160 --> 50:21.040]  one before we start telegram mash casually exercise scheduled in Tarrant
[50:21.040 --> 50:27.280]  County that's up in the Dallas, Fort Worth area on 9 11 weekend hundreds of

[54:23.600 --> 54:31.880]  case acting Phoenix police chief Joe Yoner wants to know which officer wasn't
[54:31.880 --> 54:35.120]  watching explosives at Sky Harbor International Airport when they were
[54:35.120 --> 54:40.280]  stolen Friday now do you believe any of this statistically they do a drill a
[54:40.280 --> 54:47.200]  with real explosives and that in the rare drill using real explosives they
[54:47.200 --> 54:52.400]  happen to get stolen this is their excuse for getting caught or somebody
[54:52.400 --> 54:56.040]  blowing the whistle and this is their problem when they see the sharp dressed
[54:56.040 --> 55:01.440]  man ordering them to get the underwear bomber on the plane and my listeners 9
[55:01.440 --> 55:06.320]  11 truthers are watching they blow the whistle and everything they said turned
[55:06.320 --> 55:11.040]  out to be true sounded outrageous US government got him on the plane turned
[55:11.040 --> 55:15.640]  out it was true no investigation no nothing now there's police now there's
[55:15.640 --> 55:18.800]  others that know and know how to keep their mouth shut and just get out the
[55:18.800 --> 55:22.160]  right people that when there's a drill listen if you're ever somebody wants to
[55:22.160 --> 55:25.720]  hire you to be part of a drill and that's why they have these drills hundreds
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.360]  and hundreds of them per country is that then they'll have an unannounced drill
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.000]  that goes live and they'll tell you yeah you're gonna practice going in the
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.840]  subway with this simulated backpack bomb okay Hassan you're a good school
[55:37.840 --> 55:41.680]  teacher you know you're writing essays against radical Islam and we're gonna
[55:41.680 --> 55:44.920]  have even shoot a video for training you know for all and then they get
[55:44.920 --> 55:47.720]  everybody in a little broom and everybody practices it okay this is the
[55:47.720 --> 55:52.440]  tabletop simulation and you're meeting with the head of the underground here
[55:52.440 --> 55:55.360]  in England that we're running a drill of attacks remember the exact drill the
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.920]  exact targets exact trains and exact bus attack the same time exact same place
[55:59.920 --> 56:07.760]  that's BBC news and then they bore the guys up but a few of them got wise and
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.280]  ran and it came out the news at Canary Wharf they caught them and the police
[56:11.280 --> 56:13.840]  gunned them down and killed them and then that was kept quiet it was on the
[56:13.840 --> 56:17.040]  news they gunned them down killed them and said don't worry about it then they
[56:17.040 --> 56:21.240]  had other people put part of the drill they had to track down and kill
[56:24.080 --> 56:31.480]  this is how America and England and the world operates so does anyone believe
[56:31.480 --> 56:37.960]  they lost three nuclear weapons a few years ago out of my not on the B-52s
[56:37.960 --> 56:42.840]  the cruise missiles does anybody believe that does anybody believe that they had
[56:42.840 --> 56:48.520]  real explosives and then in the drill they got lost when all they would do is
[56:48.520 --> 56:52.040]  something that looks like explosives and put residue on it instead this was
[56:52.040 --> 57:02.280]  giant kegs of plastic explosive right before 9-11 everybody's criticizing the
[57:02.280 --> 57:08.640]  TSA my god my gut tells me I'd say about a 90% chance they were planning to blow
[57:08.640 --> 57:12.920]  up an aircraft and they would have picked one that a Muslim was getting on they
[57:12.920 --> 57:17.600]  had the flight manifest sometimes weeks ahead do they want to shut up they'll
[57:17.600 --> 57:23.200]  go put stuff on your laptop and then they've got you Habib Hassan he did it
[57:23.200 --> 57:26.880]  oh look Habib Hassan this will be a good plane that sounds real Islamic that'll
[57:26.880 --> 57:32.600]  scare the public go with Habib Hassan again it's a hypothetical folks it's not
[57:32.600 --> 57:38.640]  a real Habib Hassan it's like a John Doe and then they do it but somebody blew
[57:38.640 --> 57:43.160]  the whistle on this bad boy they're like oh Jeepers we real explosive got

[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.880]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.800]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.800]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid

[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:18.400]  in the poll conducted by NBC News now has 57.7 percent of the votes a day and a
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:25.560]  half after the debate in second place with 14.3 is meant Romney Rick Perry
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:34.400]  with 12.2 and it goes down from there Bachman with 1.8 so there you have it
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.400]  and and and Ron Paul is one the majority of straw polls he's or come in second
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:44.240]  place he is probably the leader definitely in the top two no debate top
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.640]  three and but they tell you he cannot win oh he just won the new half your
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.680]  straw poll just came in second in the aims oh cannot win oh he's breaking
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.440]  fundraising records cannot win oh we just won this scientific poll just came
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:01.480]  in second place in this scientific poll cannot win wow we're in a position here
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:06.280]  where the mind control of the globalist is becoming more evident than ever but
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:16.880]  people who are still in the mind control they have a choice they can either use
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.200]  common sense or think they're voting for the winner see a lot of folks just want
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.240]  to vote for the winner like to feel like well that team looks like they're gonna
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.680]  win the Super Bowl you know they're undefeated right now so I think I'll
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:31.320]  also you'll go go by one of their jerseys or one of their baseball caps
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:38.680]  they see politicians like Coker Pepsi Ford or Chevy and we were talking to
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.800]  Marcellus in Tennessee and then I'm gonna go to other callers after he has a
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:49.000]  chance to comment on my answer and he was saying why is it that people will
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:59.440]  listen to some painted trollop or some newsman in a $2,000 suit and a fancy tie
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:05.160]  reading off a teleprompter a script and take that as credible but then laugh at
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.960]  their friends and family there's a lot of reasons there but any salesman will
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.440]  tell you the hardest people to sell things to are your family
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:22.760]  because they don't respect you there's an old saying familiarity breeds
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:31.360]  contempt absence makes the heart grow fond and even if you are seen as the
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:37.000]  leader of your family when you're selling something or you have an idea they
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.840]  have seen you stumble they've seen you make mistakes they've seen you get angry
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:50.600]  they've seen you brush in your teeth and so they don't respect themselves and so
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:56.520]  they don't respect you most people in this modern society it's always been
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:02.760]  this way but it's more pronounced now than ever most people are wildly insecure
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.880]  that's what Madison Avenue does they say you're ugly you're fat we've got
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:13.000]  products to sell you or terrorists are gonna get you you know we're selling you
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:22.440]  tyranny you'll buy it they're selling this insecurity okay and they sell false
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.360]  insecurities you know the best sales pitch is for things that are actually
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.120]  good but but but the system's always trying to sell things that really aren't
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.720]  needed so they take the female form that's natural it's voluptuous that in
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:37.560]  university studies and in marketing studies men really want a voluptuous
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:44.360]  Marilyn Monroe they don't want the 90-pound woman whose bulimic and
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:51.000]  a heroin sheik that may be what the gay men designers are into because
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.280]  they look like an 18 year old man with a wig on that's what these women some of
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.920]  these women look like with big knobby knees and the rest of it but but but
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:04.240]  that's that's their particular view so so the social engineers pick that idea
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.200]  and sell that so women then feel insecure and it gets it compounds women
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.360]  then grow up hearing their mothers hearing their grandmothers do nothing
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.400]  but talk about their way and nothing but talk about how they look so see now
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:27.280]  it's only about image and they take vain ideas of shallowness the only happy
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.520]  old women you find or a woman that really love their grandchildren or into
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:35.160]  painting or into bird watching women either get just like men either get
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:42.160]  greater and and better or they just degenerate into bitterness it was the
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.520]  same thing for men hey if you don't have a goatee and a shaved head and a bunch
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.680]  of tattoos and act tough to people you're not a man I'm not saying you're
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.240]  bad if you got tattoos and got a you know shaved head and a goatee the point
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:13:00.080]  is is that they sell that idea to men okay and you got a strut around all day
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.960]  and act tough well well why don't you try to go get in some police face faces
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.880]  who are running a checkpoint or why don't you try to go speak to a city
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.480]  council and tell them they're putting poison in the water you know that being
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.960]  a man isn't about going around and acting tough all day in fact real men
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:19.720]  have to restrain themselves from wanting to kill people I mean it's not like it's
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.520]  a good thing that you're that you're a killing machine we get it you're tough
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:30.960]  alright I understand it you need to learn to control that and focus it into
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:37.720]  action because in modern warfare 90% of it is psychological and informational but
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.040]  but but you see he has such a such a foundational question that I'm that I'm
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:49.640]  elaborating on this right now why won't his family listen to them let me give
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:55.200]  me another angle of it people who are quote at the best country club in
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.360]  Austin or Dallas or wherever you live always when they open some new super
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.760]  signature golf course they've got to go get on the waiting list or try to get
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.360]  invited to join that just because they've got to be exclusive they've got to
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.000]  have the newest car they've got to have the biggest house I mean I've been at
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  worldly rich people's houses and you can see them kind of talking about their
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.880]  neighbor and some new giant thing they're building and they're like I've got to
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:21.600]  add that they're in some competition it's not that a horse is stupid or bad
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.400]  it's an incredible animal but you try to get up beside a horse on another horse
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:30.160]  and go faster than them they're going to try to get up ahead of you it's just
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.360]  instinctiveness and the globalists are punching our lower instinctive levels
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.760]  I always wonder why I'm gonna hurry to get to work and I'm going 75 miles an
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:44.120]  hour in a 65 and people are in the slow lane and they'll they'll speed up even
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:49.880]  though you were never on their tail to get ahead of you and then sometimes
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:54.040]  they'll speed up get in front of you and and drive right by another car in the
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:59.160]  slow lane like this is their substance like this is their weird psychic vampire
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.280]  power I would be completely embarrassed by being petty like that and would feel
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.360]  completely disempowered I would probably throw up when I got out of the car if I
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:13.400]  became someone who wanted to park who wanted to block other people I want to
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.560]  see people unleashed I want to see potential I like seeing big rockets
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:21.760]  launch and I like seeing science and people pole vaulting over things and
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:27.080]  beauty and people succeeding you see it's that idea versus people that are
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.280]  freaked out by other success you've got to know that's the globalist prime mover
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.720]  it's why they attack success attack enlightenment because they're threatened
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:43.200]  by it they can only rule a population that is in darkness now here's an
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:48.920]  example and I was never that worldly but it was still wow movie stars what would
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:53.400]  it be like to know famous movie stars what would it be like another world like
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:58.560]  being an outer space or visiting another planet you know that unattainable that
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:02.040]  unattainable what would it be like to have the big house what would it be like
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:06.240]  to have the cool car what would it be well for folks I've talked to it becomes
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.640]  a hassle becomes a ball and chain if you're more centered or it becomes your
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:17.120]  God well that isn't my God I don't I don't resonate with that it's fine to be
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:21.680]  comfortable but that's not that's not in my hierarchy of needs anywhere near the
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:27.600]  top and so over the years getting to know some of the most famous people in
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.640]  the world I'd say 95% of the famous people I know you'll never hear on air
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:37.280]  they just reach out to me and it's incredible I mean you could name it you
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:43.120]  could basically name it okay and it's not that I don't want to talk to him on
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.720]  the phone now when they call it's that I am just trying to unlock minds I'm so
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:52.080]  busy I don't even really call these people anymore I don't even really try to
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:56.200]  get people on the show half the time now I don't even call a super famous person
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:01.040]  back not because I'm high and mighty but because I'd rather go out and listen to
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:08.800]  frogs at dusk I'd rather oil paint I would rather research information I'd
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:13.280]  rather carry the trash out here at this office because I'm unlocking minds and
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:19.120]  that is the most important thing we can do in this plane of existence now
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:25.200]  finishing up for people that have never met super famous people or really know
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.800]  them or spent a lot of time with them they just I've talked to famous movie
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.520]  stars and they say even presidents and people freak out and act weird around
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.360]  them because those aren't developed people and it turns out really famous
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.200]  powerful people like other people who have figured out that none of it means
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.520]  anything it's weird you find out really famous people they then think you're a
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.120]  star and then they want to meet you and then they like you once they meet you
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.520]  but then it's kind of like yeah you're just like everybody else so it's the
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.800]  same thing your family doesn't think much of themselves so they still think
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:05.320]  much of you I'd rather out the back of some old fishing shack talk to some
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:14.000]  quiet old weird old man and drink beer with them then hang out with some super
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:25.400]  a-list Hollywood star I'd rather walk around in the high desert then then go
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.040]  out on a date with the most beautiful supermodel in the world and it's
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:34.520]  because I realized this planet is just one little planet I mean look folks
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:39.200]  we're we're in outer space what is this we're orbiting a giant burning
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:46.640]  fireball and so you a lot of people won't wake up or get involved because
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.880]  they make a split-second decision that they're powerless they make a split
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:58.920]  second decision that oh I'm not gonna believe there's corruption because why
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:03.040]  should I believe it I'm powerless I couldn't do anything about it when they
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:08.120]  have no idea how much power they've really got and that this whole life is a
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:16.800]  test and so that's why your family laughs at you you know I've seen this I've
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.960]  talked to a lot of high-powered media people and every years ago I was eating
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:23.200]  dinner with a guy I said you almost everybody I talked to I can convince
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.760]  or they wake up I said everybody's waking up he said or you speak
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.040]  authoritatively and they're only responding the next message they'll get
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:37.120]  they'll buy into that and that was that was that was a key under Tommy Pallotta
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.720]  told me that and he was absolutely right it's that these once the globalist
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:48.560]  engineer you to not have a mooring or a compass you just float around you don't
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:58.520]  have a core now we all have that core you just got to ignite it we'll be right

[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:18.040]  alright Marcellus I was gonna go back to you to let you comment on the question
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:22.560]  you'd asked but I'm gonna go back to the calls now to try to boil down the
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.480]  answer in just 30 seconds to your question why won't your family listen
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.360]  to you but they'll listen to somebody reading off a teleprompter it's an
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.800]  appeal to authority they project that you've never been in a place surrounded
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:40.000]  by a glistening set in a fancy suit with a guy's you know face that's been
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.360]  scored and cued in front of audiences to sell that they're believable or a woman
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.800]  smiling at you seductively she's looking at a camera she's not actually
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.720]  looking at you with sexual desire they found that sells lies to men so that you
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:01.600]  get into a frame of mind to believe it they're just accepting it like oh that's
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:09.080]  the big TV thing in the sky that's that's CNN that's the expert and you see
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:12.400]  establishment hacks when they get on shows at the base will go very well
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.760]  Mr. Tenfoil let's talk about what everybody knows and then they go into
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:24.080]  their little stick but once you know the tricks you totally understand it okay
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:31.760]  so that's what's happening and you need to lovingly talk to your family about
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.760]  these things there's a lot of times family also thinks especially of your
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.560]  younger which I think you're basically you said 9-11 happened when you were in
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:47.680]  fourth grade so what your know you're basically a young man now but they
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.720]  probably still think of you as a kid they think you're showing off so I would
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:57.800]  say the way if you want to really wake your family up is become successful live
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:03.000]  your life become a political leader in your area and stop stop trying to
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.560]  convince them you can either lovingly explain to them the manipulation or you
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.760]  can just tell them I really care about you I wish you'd wake up and just move
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.760]  on because we need to reach people there's the old saying the teacher
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.040]  appears when the student is ready and students can teach teachers teachers can
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:29.120]  teach students we're all teachers life is a is a process all right let's go to
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.480]  Nina in Washington then ya don Sheldon Bishop and others go ahead Nina you're
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.800]  on the air hi yeah I called actually I thought I would would go to the front
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.680]  line since I wanted to disagree with a lot of things you said oh you know what
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:46.000]  I wasn't we've got a new call system and I wasn't reading the fine print there
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.720]  yes but hey you're on now hey and I wanted to call in I'm one of your Muslim
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:58.960]  sisters over here in Seattle I was about time a Muslim woman called in I've been
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:06.680]  listening to you for six years so I'm you know I feel qualified to comment
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:12.880]  Chris I'd like to say my husband was a virgin he didn't screw around and I
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.080]  didn't make any woman pregnant so they had to go out and get abortions and
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.040]  that's one reason they hate the Muslims is you know the conservatives don't
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.560]  don't hate the abortuaries most of them they just hate Muslims all day that
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.040]  have killed 50 plus million American babies but but ma'am what do you disagree
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:33.480]  with because I don't I mean I mean let's cut to the chase yeah I'm a Muslim
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:40.280]  woman and I you know I my Muslim husband he didn't screw around he doesn't screw
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.160]  around ma'am but ma'am what what are you saying you disagree with me on just say
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:52.920]  is that I've been listening to you for six years and you keep saying I'm not
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:56.360]  saying there aren't some Muslim extremists who don't hate America wouldn't
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:01.560]  don't want to hurt America Fox News says and we're a lucky blah blah blah the
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:10.520]  Muslims ran a forthood this is this is serving the Illuminati okay Muslims did
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:16.560]  not do any of this and you're still keeping the lie alive that well they're
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:20.120]  dumb Muslims who did it that they thought they were doing it but they were
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:25.840]  really being used ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am you're completely confused here last
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.600]  year even mainstream media had to admit that there were more than 10 cases last
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.240]  year and a couple this year where they would recruit quote new Muslims
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.920]  generally Hispanics or black folks in every case none of them were Anglo well
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:44.000]  no one woman was and they would get them out of prison where they basically are
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.440]  forced to join these gangs and then the FBI would lead them as their E-mom and
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.360]  try to get them to blow something up and so there are real people who say
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.680]  they're Muslims who were trying to blow stuff up the point is the government was
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:02.960]  trying to lead them and and and there are real terrorists you know people who
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:09.520]  militarily asymmetrical warfare do attack Western targets in cases that
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:14.280]  I've seen that are not manufactured most of it is manufactured but I'm just
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:19.440]  about research history what's going on I think it's terrorism when they drop a
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.080]  hellfire missile on a wedding to kill 200 people to kill one person they claim
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:28.560]  might be a terrorist so I mean so you see what I'm saying right there let me
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:33.080]  let me say something hold me over because I have something to say to you
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.880]  okay okay I'll let you finish man but I think it's I think it's naive to say
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:42.160]  that there I mean there are there are Christians who've blown up a board
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:46.560]  cheerwereys I mean and that that that is an act of terrorism is that saying all
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:54.200]  Christians are bad it's crazy we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:27.600]  feels the way I do about you now okay we are going back to your calls and the
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:32.760]  news here in a moment Bob Chapman is coming up we're opening the phones up
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:37.800]  to say what's your view of ten years later how America's changed 9-11 is the
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:42.000]  event that's been used to basically kill the Republic but you're the Bill of
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.320]  Rights and they've now removed most of the Bill of Rights and are actively
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:52.640]  setting the precedents to now go after the general population and the you know
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:57.920]  the big issue is they're clearly rebranding away from Muslims and again
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:01.040]  I'm reaching out to folks that have a fetish of fearing Muslims and they're
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.280]  under the bed they're gonna get you to I told you the internal manuals this was
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:11.120]  for conservatives libertarians gun owners anti-globalist but they always
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:15.720]  branded on a group that's a minority and seen as unpopular Hitler did it
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.360]  Stalin did it they always pick a minority to take their rights first and
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:24.000]  prime the pump then they move on to who they really want to rob and that's the
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.760]  general public and namely seen as the big enemy because it's seen as the
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:33.480]  establishment at the local level as more wealthy per capita white people
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:38.280]  there's a new ad there's got to be ten of these now we're in every ad everyone
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.200]  is white and it's minorities that report them and then the Southern Poverty
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.640]  Law Center comes out and says well Jones is racist he pointed out these ads
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.960]  everybody's white so now they run the ads and if you pointed out well you're
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:56.520]  clearly rebranding now as you always meant to do now that it's in place to
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:01.480]  whitey because again if whitey is the terrorist first it's people that are
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:07.160]  brown don't trust any of them and whites are like yeah get them and then oh now
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:11.520]  the whites are the terrorists too so see now everybody's a terrorist it's just a
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:15.600]  total branding now if you're a union and want to storm a facility and hold
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.440]  people hostage and threaten cops with baseball bats and sabotage equipment and
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:24.840]  cut break lines on trains you don't get in trouble because you're seen as part
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:28.880]  of the establishment for now and again I'm not saying I'm against unions
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:33.080]  completely I'm saying why are they exempt why will they attack peaceful
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:39.160]  protesters of any political stripe and say it's normal but then call what the
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:43.080]  union did okay what's the larger strategy I'm there you've got to ask
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:49.160]  yourself why is that happening why is that going on well the unions are
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.520]  supporting open borders globalism they're not supporting actually keeping
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:56.800]  their jobs so they don't want to demonize a group they've been using to go out
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.400]  and beat up tea partiers they're gonna put out their video games where you
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:05.360]  kill tea partiers and it's all it's cute and funny and call for violence
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:09.800]  constantly but then I'm not calling for violence and they have MSNBC report
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:15.280]  specials Alex Jones and Ron Paul calling for violence remember that the rise in
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:21.400]  the new right and then we don't say anything about violence and every time
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:26.920]  reporters are here they say are you causing violence are you wanting violence
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:31.480]  aren't you worried violence is about to happen I'm like yeah your bosses are
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:34.480]  getting ready to stage some terror attacks and blame it on us I've I've
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.480]  gotten the internal memos it's going to go public soon they're going to roll out
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:41.920]  white al-qaeda and then sure enough they roll out the white al-qaeda I got the
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.640]  talking points from police years before it happened they always train the
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:51.120]  internal group it's a party system inner party the globalist outer party which is
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:54.400]  the enforcers and minions who are compartmentalized and then us under
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:37:00.640]  that outer party who I've woken up in this global syndicate send me the info
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:04.800]  so I can say okay this is the next script coming out stand by it should come
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.800]  up right now okay yep there it is see this is this this is all a projection
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:16.640]  this is a trance it's a it's not a not a literal matrix of digital stuff it's
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.840]  we're here living and operating but but but our eyes see information like a
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:28.160]  computer and so they pump us with disinformation and false ideas okay so
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:32.200]  they either say you're with the muslim extremist or you're with America well
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:35.960]  America's been taken over by big foreign banks that are destroying what you would
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.400]  think of as America Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.720]  so see I'm a guy who really wants the real America so those that claim they're
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.240]  the new America the tyrants they're now busy behind the scenes building a giant
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:55.760]  paramilitary spying suppression grid and training behind the scenes that they're
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.680]  going to wage war against real America I've known it's going on I've been to
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.720]  the drills have the sources and now I've been warning you for 16 years and now
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.880]  the shields are dropping and it's like a whole new ship's been built in dry dock

[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.320]  foreign banks take America over they come in stage terror attacks poses of
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:44.760]  saviors get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution say it's for a far
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.280]  enemy they're fighting knowing you give up the rights then flip it onto the
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:53.440]  general public and even if you think 9-11 was an outside job even if you
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:59.400]  think 9-11 was an outside job they've used it to kill our liberties while
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:04.200]  putting al-Qaeda into Libya and get the underwear bomber on the plane and and
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:09.200]  and we're all the locky hanging out the Pentagon I mean they run these people in
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:16.520]  front of you it's 100% they blew up building 7 in front of everybody with
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:23.720]  cops saying get back they're getting ready to blow it up I'm not a hero I'm
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:31.520]  not special I'm nobody I can see though I can see it and it's all because I saw
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.920]  cops dealing drugs when I was a kid and and and like cops deal drugs dad and he
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:40.960]  goes well yes the CIA's been well known and it's part of corruption here I'll
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.120]  go to them we just got in a vcr when I was like you know 10 or whatever and we
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:56.600]  got one late and he went and got serpico and popped it in I watched it I guess
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:02.840]  I was more like 12 11 I don't remember and see just from that and reading
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:07.240]  history history is all about intrigue and corruption and combines and
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:12.120]  monopolies and subterfuge and Kings courts and Byzantine Machiavelli
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:15.680]  manipulation and then they sit up here and tell you none of that's going on
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:22.040]  nowadays government cares about you and the big corporations care about you too
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:25.920]  all right I'm gonna go to this lady here I'm gonna go back and give her a

[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:33.520]  even how much of what I said before was aired I know that you're not gonna give
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:39.560]  much time it's ironic after ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am put her on hold ma'am
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:43.720]  listen you're on air you've complained we didn't go to you quick enough now
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.160]  you're complaining again okay it's obvious you're mad at me because I haven't
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.360]  joined Islam or whatever at the end of the day I'm a Christian it's what I
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:56.960]  believe I'm not bad and and make your point please I don't want to be your
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.760]  enemy just you've got the floor make your point you keep saying your husband's
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:04.240]  was a virgin now I don't know how I disagree with that I don't know your
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:09.760]  husband I'm sure he was a virgin but what do you disagree with people okay you
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.360]  don't want to hear you don't have much time for it but you have thousands of
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.960]  hours to talk about all this what I call I've begin to call else Jones hail
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:22.600]  Mary's bad-mouthing Muslims okay I have two points because you're not going to
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:28.960]  give me much time one Dimitri Kalazov says that he personally knows who
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:34.760]  organized 9-1-1 my carari method agent you can listen to chip Tatum about my
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:42.320]  carari of Manuel new egg and the holy Ron Contra and he claims Dimitri Kalazov
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:47.080]  claims it was a missile that was fired into the Pentagon Muslims did not fire
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:50.960]  missile into the Pentagon so there's a question there there's a question there
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:55.560]  with your let it happen a theme that's been going on for six years now that I've
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.520]  been listening to you the other thing I want to say is that I think that's a
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:07.640]  very valid point that you are showing a very bizarre covering up of the the role
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:16.280]  that the the fact that the CIA da connects into skull and bones which is
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.600]  all tied in with nights of Malta night's Templar in the Vatican okay ma'am I've
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:27.240]  given you your your time straw man asinine baloney garbage and then your
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:34.560]  proof is Vatican assassin cherry on top at the end okay I don't know what I can
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.880]  say to you I've made five films on 9-11 saying it was a completely engineered
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.600]  inside job carried out by the military industrial complex and clearly other
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:47.360]  Western intelligence agencies were involved I've been quoted just this
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:51.960]  month and major newspapers saying that and on BBC television and you you're now
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:59.360]  saying that I am saying the government let it happen just unbelievable but you
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.920]  said it so it must be true and I don't want to attack you or dislike you if you
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:11.720]  really believe I said those things then fine I have said to listeners even if you
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:20.200]  think 9-11 was an outside job for the sake of argument even though it's clearly
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:24.800]  an inside job it's been used to take our liberties and target the American
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:31.720]  people yet I mean do you understand that I've been against all these wars all of
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:37.520]  it and instead of talking about the New World Order you call in your call is not
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:42.240]  screened you volunteer you disagree we go to you you're able to say what you
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:45.320]  want you talk about I don't know how much of my call minute on air well I put
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:54.920]  you on hold publicly to go to break and come back but it's again it's bizarre to
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:46:02.240]  to sit there I mean they they do have Muslim extremist al-CIA to Wahhabi is
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:06.200]  funded out of Saudi Arabia that the British put into power to dominate and
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:13.720]  control and re-engineer Islam they are used all over the world and then when I
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.800]  point out their use to take over part of Serbia and steal it for the globalist
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.040]  then I get Muslims call me going how dare you support the Serbs look I know
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:26.360]  I'm not a Serb I'm not a Muslim I'm not any of this the facts are they sent
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:30.600]  al-Qaeda in to start the war when the Serbs defended themselves in that
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:35.400]  southern area they had a globalist bombardment of their country including
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:40.520]  their infrastructure with depleted uranium I'm not a fan of sloven milage
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:46.240]  of it but the point is their country was industrializing and compared to some of
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:51.600]  the neighbors like Albania was much more progressive I'm not a fan of Muammar
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:55.880]  Gaddafi but they've issued a ridiculous interpoll arrest warrant interpolled is
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:47:01.920]  on record even in mainstream news running white slavery rings and idiots in me
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:05.120]  letters saying what about black slavery doesn't it matter hey if you're a more
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.640]  on and don't know what white slavery is it's not white people white slavery means
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:13.800]  sex slavery okay again it's the problem is I have language I have a history I
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.640]  have understanding and I've got to remember a lot of folks again I've been
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:19.760]  set in front of television sets their whole life and they don't even know what
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:23.840]  language is they hear all this and they think it's fancy pants talk or something
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:29.000]  yeah I mean I'm here really expressing about as much truth as you're gonna find
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.760]  anywhere okay I mean I'm really someone who is seeking it seeking the answers
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:43.960]  see seeking the secrets seeking it and I'm leaving I found a lot and it is
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:52.800]  painful to hear that level of ignorance it is it is mind-numbing that that they've
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.200]  put al-Qaeda in and they're slaughtering tens of thousands of people that's
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:04.160]  admitted and murdering every black person they can get their hands on and I got a
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:07.920]  lady calling in saying I'm bashing Muslims and claiming that they let the
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:13.560]  Muslims do 9-11 no ma'am I said that the the hijackers were US government agents
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:20.760]  who thought they were taking part in a drill and were set up and we have real
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:25.920]  air phone calls that were made with the with the multiple stewardess is saying I
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:31.600]  can't breathe there's gas we actually pretty much know what happened and in
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:37.080]  all a decade of work a decade plus of work exposing it as an inside job before
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:43.480]  it even happened and it all is just reduced to someone just hand fistedly
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:51.320]  saying you say they let 9-11 happen you say the Muslim did it it's just it's
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.960]  just it's it's like a it's like baby it's like there's no bad Muslims doing
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:01.480]  anything bad and there's never Muslims that you know go on an Israeli bus and
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:09.600]  stab 14 people it doesn't happen Alex you are Vatican what I'm not even
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:14.280]  Catholic and then it's some known Israeli agent has put out the story for
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:21.000]  five years I work for the Vatican with no proof the guy says that Catholic
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.600]  priests fly flying saucers and drop atomic bombs out of them with a black
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:34.040]  magic ritual that's the people that make up all this stuff about me you think I'm
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.360]  joking that's that I was sent a video clip of the person actually saying this
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:41.000]  and by the way the person's an operative he knows full well what he's doing the
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.120]  more asinine the better as Cass Sunstein said to get us all fighting with each
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.560]  other and this has been a great learning experience with this lady here
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:53.520]  while all these other people hold listening to it you get to hear just
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:58.800]  labels instead of complex frustrating thought and understanding and
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:05.160]  enlightenment and and and nuanced understandings of history and
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:10.080]  intelligence and sociology and anthropology you just call in and say
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:15.880]  Alex Jones doesn't think 9-11's an inside job Alex Jones doesn't like
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:28.080]  Muslims Alex Jones covers up for the Pope that is incredible that is amazing
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:33.520]  but you that has to be expected because we challenge people's thought
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:40.480]  processes and so they're going to it's also good for an ego for people you can
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:43.720]  have somebody works 18 hours a day tirelessly changing the course of
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.360]  history together with my good activist listeners and then other people could
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:55.280]  just say up I'm better than that Alex's hope for a CIA or he's reptoid all right

[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:18.960]  YAH Don Sheldon others ahead of Bob Chapman joining us but for that woman
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:23.640]  tuning in earlier lady it's fun to just get in fights with people it's fun to
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:30.480]  hate on you and and hear the straw man stuff you put out but I actually I
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:36.680]  understand that you think you've heard things that put Muslims in a bad life
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:44.200]  but see everything is about labels I try to judge people individually okay I've
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:49.960]  been a great friend to peaceful Muslims I've really tried hard back when it was
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:53.920]  unpopular day one to stop the wars on these countries and millions dead
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:59.760]  people I've gone through death threats you name it and I've seen kind of the
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:05.760]  fake anti-Israel lobby that's that's government run attack anybody that
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:10.120]  reasonably criticizes Israel and I've seen their operatives come out and say
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:14.720]  that I was for the attack on the flotilla that happened a while back and I
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.400]  never said that I said if you think I work for Israel you're mentally ill
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:24.600]  then it became if you criticize Israel you're mentally ill and and and people
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.200]  even play the clip and then say it says one thing when it does in another this
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:33.400]  is a new level of mind control but I want to try to get through to you if you'll
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:36.640]  just listen to me if you'll just go online you can watch it for free or we
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:40.400]  want to support us by the DVD and info wars.com it's also in higher quality
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.400]  at prisonplanet.tv and that's terror storm a history government sponsored
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:50.240]  terror and I have copies of the CIA's own declassification and other news
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:54.240]  clips but I mean it's it's public Kermit Roosevelt wrote a book about it
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.880]  before it was declassified in 99 before he died he was the deputy head of the
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:03.800]  CIA head of foreign operations and he was with the grandson of Teddy Roosevelt
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:11.640]  and he was at Franklin Delano and I think it was Teddy they launched an
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:18.760]  attack and they went in and funded a radical Muslim sect to start blowing
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:25.400]  stuff up in Operation Ajax and they also had some army folks they bought off to
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:30.360]  it and then they blamed it on Mozadek and said that he'd done it the the leader
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:36.440]  of Iran and double crossed him and threw him out of power then they double
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:41.080]  crossed the extremist I mean if you don't know that they're putting a Muslim
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:45.600]  brotherhood in charge in Egypt and getting rid of the old dictator who I
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:50.440]  was against Mubarak and if you don't know that they're putting these Arab
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:57:04.800]  Wahhabist brigades in in I mean I so many American Muslims you I hear them
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:09.080]  talk and see their videos on YouTube and it's very childish I mean do you know
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:15.240]  that the Shiites and the Sunnis kill each other 24-7 and and have absolute
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:18.480]  enmity against each other a lot more than the West and you say the Muslims
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:24.920]  have no enmity for the West well that's that's just not true I mean as a whole
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:28.400]  there are large segments that do and I think I have a lot of reasons to be
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:33.040]  upset she you said that the you know I say the Muslims hate the West well
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:36.120]  there certainly are people that hate the West and have some reasons to for who
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:39.880]  runs the West but I can also talk about some of the things they're doing that
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:44.680]  are bad I have my free will this isn't like some religion where I'm gonna be
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:50.560]  beating the head you know and and and and then agree with your view I mean
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:56.960]  you've got probably 10 different sects of you know sects different subgroups of
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:02.840]  Muslims 80% roughly
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.960]  okay are the group based in Saudi Arabia that spread all over the world then
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:12.240]  you got about 18% that are Shiite you got eight other sects or so that are
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:18.200]  making up the other 2% okay and they they they are constantly killing each
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:25.280]  other this is human tribalism they'll use any name any excuse okay so your
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:29.720]  statement that there's this one Islam and everybody's getting along is not
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:32.800]  true just like there's not one Christianity everybody's getting along
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:40.520]  okay so you need to really educate yourself with a ride back

[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:23.520]  Alex Jones
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:33.680]  let's go back to your phone call sorry to folks that I got off into that warren
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:38.360]  of argument for so long Bishop in Illinois you're on the air Bishop thank
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:43.320]  you for holding Alex the last time I talked to you was probably about three
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:47.960]  weeks after I started doing a talk show on an AM station that was over five
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:54.600]  years ago I had you on well good to talk to you yeah most definitely I'm still
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:59.240]  doing it strong and reporting and doing all kinds of things but I wanted to talk
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:04.000]  about a couple things you've brought up so far and I did well I have to follow
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.080]  that past caller because you can go off on so many tangents but medium
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:14.080]  manipulation I'm finishing up a master's degree and I want to focus on the
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:19.840]  alternative media and the mainstream media and how they frame certain
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:24.080]  political activist groups so I'm hoping in the future I can kind of touch base
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:28.760]  with you because I do want to focus on info wars prison planet you know the
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:33.080]  Alex Jones show as being an alternative media outpost and how you frame
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:38.000]  political action versus how say you know box news frames political action so
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.760]  they frame everything in little limited boxes to basically shunt political
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:47.320]  movements like a river you know diverting it away from real common sense
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:53.480]  into just a la la land where they debate a bunch of minutia right and you know
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:56.560]  just listening to some of the callers earlier somebody mentioned a 9-11
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:02.800]  conspiracy theory what was it a film festival over in the Bay area yeah
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:09.480]  why would they even call their event a conspiracy theory event no it's a it
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:14.320]  doesn't matter go ahead I'm right there with you I turned the TV off weeks ago
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:19.560]  or not weeks ago but years ago and now anything I see even if it's online you
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:23.520]  know you just look around and if you can critically digest what you're seeing you
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:29.480]  can see all those tricks they become so clear it's not even tricks once the big
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:34.960]  national print TV you know does this stuff long enough it just becomes the
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:40.040]  language and people copy the false language in baloney not even knowing
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:46.480]  and it just becomes second nature that's what's so crazy the media manipulation
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:51.960]  it's it's unbelievable and it's all you know agenda setting and how these
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:54.600]  particular things are framed but I definitely want to be able to get a
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:58.500]  hold of you sometime in the very near future so I can interview you off the
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:03.440]  air kind of gets your feel for you know what what your information outlet does
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:07.520]  for the alternative media I'm also gonna try to contact democracy now and talk
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:11.680]  with them and review some of the shows from you know the alternative media and
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:15.240]  then also mainstream media but anyways that aside all this mean media
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:19.960]  manipulation something else I wanted to contact you about was being able to help
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.560]  the battle in this info war now I know you've got so many listeners across the
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:30.520]  world and a lot of them are media savvy and a lot of them do have experience
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:36.800]  with maybe that being news gatherers you know you've got Luke Radowski with we
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:41.840]  are change in the media they put together and he's a newsmaker because he
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:45.140]  does what the corporate prostitute media won't do he goes and ask real
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:48.360]  questions like hey Gary Hart you wrote a public letter saying the government
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.520]  stages terror attacks and threatening Iran to stage more if they don't submit
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:55.800]  is like I didn't write that letter they go here's the letter and he goes oh I did
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:58.880]  write it and suddenly he steps back and starts sweating goes because then it's
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:02.160]  like a new rule it's like they have these weird rules okay you're a human and
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:05.840]  then that's how they see it you're not cattle my little mind game didn't work
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.240]  and he's just going yeah I did I did send the letter but this is for high level

[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:05.800]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:17.360]  because there's a war on for your mind okay if you're watching this on
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:21.520]  prisonplanet.tv I know I've been talking about this since yesterday but the
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:31.600]  poll has now closed out with over 200,005 votes and it's geolocated you can
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:41.160]  only vote once Ron Paul got 57.8% but now in this new Orwellian world 14.3
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:49.600]  14.3 is basically almost you know half of 57 even though in the real world it
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:55.360]  isn't now they had it even more skewed a day ago and they got caught when we had
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:01.120]  you know 20-something more points than Mitt Romney it barely on the graph was
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:05.000]  a millimeter bigger and so they've gone ahead and expanded it out some I guess
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.720]  Ron Paul's defeating them so bad their graph can't even you know go off the page
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:18.200]  I mean he's got 57.8% of the 100% but we're told Bachman's a big big leader
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:23.560]  with 1.8 Herman came with 3% Newt Gennrich you might as well elect
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:35.080]  Moussey Tong has 4% John Huntsman with 6 Rick Perry 12.1 Mitt Romney 14.3 and I
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.920]  can't believe my good friend last night when I hadn't told me that he knew Rick
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:43.360]  Perry real well from a country club over many years when he was lieutenant
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:48.440]  governor not lieutenant governor when he was agriculture secretary and that Rick
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:53.560]  Perry was giving him anti-New World Order stuff this makes it even worse man
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:58.520]  that's what I mean that's what's so bad about Rick Perry is that he knows all
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:02.720]  this stuff and has decided to sell out but that he can also act like a patriot
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.840]  good because he used to be into it I don't know that really freaks me out I
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:09.860]  wonder if the globalist like knowing that Rick Perry used to not like the New
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:14.720]  World Order because anybody with it with their head screwed on is not gonna
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:18.560]  like the New World Order I mean it's a bad vision of humanity it's not a nice
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:27.800]  place to go these are some ugly ugly minded people I want to go to ya and
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:31.680]  Robert and Don and Sheldon who's been holding the longest we're gonna get to
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.200]  ya and then Sheldon and Don we'll get to everybody here today
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:42.240]  Otter but going to Bob Chapman Bob we've seen the stock market plunging today
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.480]  we've seen gold shooting back up oh and I forgot zero hedges reporting that the
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:58.160]  federal government and what is it Goldman Sachs people are saying hey we can
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:03.080]  we can have the government come in and reduce gold price so this is a pretty
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:08.720]  stunning statement if you weren't aware of that I can dig it out and then read
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:13.600]  it to you and get your take but Bob good to have you here with us well thank
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:19.480]  you very much and I wouldn't expect anything else and normally from Goldman
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:27.520]  Sachs or Citigroup or HSBC or JPM although a week ago JPM said gold by the
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:31.960]  end of the years going to $2500 an ounce and I think they said that because they
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:35.280]  thought it was going higher than that and they hoped that this statement would
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.240]  keep it from going higher than that these people are desperate well Goldman
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.640]  Sachs comes out and says well you know the government could sell gold well the
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:47.600]  question is where they're gonna find it aren't they in trouble on silver as well
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:53.520]  I mean how much real silver is there discovered and versus how much they're
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:12:00.360]  short on it well the US government's been out of silver for 10 years so they
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:04.800]  don't have any I mean that is in the minute fact so they would have to go and
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:09.840]  have somebody lend it to them or they would have to buy it and if they bought
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:16.680]  it they would make the price go up so it's nothing but unfounded propaganda
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:21.400]  and if it was going to affect the market well gee the markets been all over the
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:26.280]  place today I think it ended up five points it's been flipping between 260 and
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:32.280]  560 for the past 10 or 15 minutes on the plus side and so there's plenty of
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:40.080]  action they met their masters during this day they try to take it down they
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:44.920]  couldn't do it they just couldn't do it there's too many physical buyers in
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:53.240]  there and as I said last week we touched 1800 we're gonna go back up to 1900
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:13:00.280]  again and probably take a week or so and test that into day 1928 and they'll
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:05.840]  break it how long will it take I don't know a week or two three four five six
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:12.160]  and then we get 2200 then what are they gonna do then come out and say well
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:17.560]  we're gonna take all of the gold out of everybody's fillings and we're gonna
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:21.680]  sell it into the market I mean that's a stupid it is well they keep as you know
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:25.600]  what two times in the last few months raised the margin you know how much
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:29.000]  money you have to put down to be in there manipulating it and then that's
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.280]  barely put the brakes on only for a short period then it races back up at
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:38.080]  zero hedge great inside sources this is up at info wars calm but in this case
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:42.640]  they're just linking directly to their insiders that leaked them well Goldman
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.360]  sacks last week was saying internally to their big investors we believe a total
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:50.360]  implosions coming go ahead and sucker the public like to do with Timberwolf you
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:53.120]  know these people are scum we're gonna get them you know you hate you feel the
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:56.880]  earthquake yeah it was my wallet hitting the ground ha ha ha but here's the
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:01.880]  headline Goldman sacks head gold trader authorities could intervene to slam down
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:08.680]  price of gold former Goldman not former from Goldman's head gold trader
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:14.720]  Zach da balia and it goes through the quotes to say the source of this flow
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:19.000]  seems hard to pin down with some speculating over whether authorities
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.480]  were concerned with the signals of an accelerating gold price and its impact on
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:29.280]  other fragile markets are exposing their paper markets however official sector
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:34.360]  activity with the PWM is already using this latest dip to re-accumulate and it
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:38.200]  may be the case the market is already close to clean positions and even higher
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:45.720]  prices despite the much higher volume we are happy to own short date one dash two
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:50.800]  mth high stakes more than flat price positions in the current environment then
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:54.600]  it goes on to talk about the government stepping in to try to try to suppress it
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:15:02.080]  what is all this coded babble mean nothing it is babble and they don't have
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:06.840]  any gold and if they do they're not going to use it to try to manipulate the
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:12.360]  market they're just not going to do it and so you know it's a big secret no
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:17.400]  audit since 1954 so we don't know what they've got are they going to do borrow
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:22.120]  it from Germany or did they already sell that off we never heard whether they
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:28.160]  gave German Germany delivery that was almost two years ago yeah and what
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:34.560]  about Chavez demanding his 144 tons out of England what's that what about Chavez
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:40.400]  demanding his gold from England well I I thought that was a good idea by Mr.
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:46.560]  Chavez and hopefully he'll get delivery it'll be interesting to see if he does
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:51.320]  because if he doesn't that means they don't have the gold to deliver and they'll
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:56.160]  have to go find it someplace yeah they'll try to play him in dollars he's
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:01.680]  gonna say I don't want dollars I want my gold they'll go get it and it is the
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:05.960]  dictators gold I guess the dictator wants it from the I think say he's been
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:10.440]  elected but he's the chicane that position you know Chavez beating the
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:13.840]  free trade area the Americans and stuff that was a that was an example of a
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:18.200]  blind hog finding Akron's but overall he is more and more cracking down and I've
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:21.960]  talked to folks that are in Venezuela they say his communism is just
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:25.400]  destroying the country so it's an example of the bankers are rotten and
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:29.200]  horrible and Chavez is rotten but I guess in a way you know he's less
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:33.040]  rotten because he's not putting cancer viruses in our vaccines like the
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:37.160]  globalist are what do you think of the whole Muammar Gaddafi situation they
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:39.640]  keep saying they're gonna kill him they're gonna kill him they're gonna
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:43.680]  kill him but now they admit notice Libby has left left the front pages and they
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:46.560]  admit now the rebels don't have a bunch of the cities and it's just a horrible
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:52.600]  civil war 30 plus thousand dead quite a humanitarian intervention Bob yeah
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.960]  another one you know they keep on bettering themselves all the time in
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:02.240]  their effort to relieve the people from the earth or the useless eaters as they
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:08.000]  call them I noticed nothing that's been said about the gold we were told the
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.960]  other day that in the process of the last six months that mr. Gaddafi had
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:20.080]  sold 12 tons of gold well he had a lot more than that the question is where is
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:24.560]  it we don't know we haven't been told did he take it to Algeria with him is he
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:29.800]  really in Algeria well undoubtedly he wouldn't be able to transport all that
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:33.840]  so I'm sure the rebels have gotten large caches of it and we'll never hear where
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:38.160]  that went any either into into some politicians hands undoubtedly this is
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:46.800]  just a rape and repine going on at an expanded level Bob I wanted to bring up
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:51.400]  another issue this is old news for us but you know we've always known that the
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:55.320]  euro was meant to take over countries get him into debt through fraud take over
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:59.880]  the ministers implode them into a greater more dictatorial union but they're
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:05.520]  going right to the end game and saying it's a financial union run by banks no
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:09.840]  more power for the countries fully conquered the country's being conquered
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:14.360]  by the Ponzi scheme operators that that that that induced their leaders to sign
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:18.760]  on to their debt so I mean this is this is wild you pay off the leaders to sign
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:22.720]  on to your debt and then you become the dictatorial rulers and take everybody's
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:27.480]  pension funds for yourself this is just incredible and raise all these new VAT
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:31.720]  taxes and now they're just all over the talking point yes there's going to be a
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:37.040]  new financial order and it's going to kind of merge with the new American
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:43.560]  order I mean they're going right to this banking authority not with a bang but
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:46.360]  with a whimper Bob
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:52.000]  where do you see that for everything and it's breeze in an arrogant they don't
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.840]  care what you think they're telling you we're going to steal everything you've
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:02.360]  got and I think the German people may stop them it'll be interesting to see if
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:08.440]  they can get this legislation passed to continue to fund the bailout for these
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:15.600]  countries that are insolvent or close to being so and if that passes I would
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:20.280]  think that there would be some pretty nasty things going on in Germany like
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:26.160]  demonstrations and riots and and I wouldn't be surprised that they didn't
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:32.840]  try to assassinate some of the members of the Bundesstag which would have okayed
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:38.600]  this legislation it's a pretty hot topic there yeah stop right there stop right

[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:23.720]  I want to get into all the 9-11 fear mongering with Bob Bob but they have
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:29.000]  now run at least 10 TV ads and we're seeing them now air on the different
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.440]  television sets we've got here around the office we've recorded some that a new
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:36.760]  report coming out later by Paul Watson on it they've now got at least 10 ads
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:42.240]  well some of them aren't even ads they're like little mini TV shows 10 15 minutes
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:46.320]  long depending on which one but some are only about 30 seconds long a minute
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:54.120]  long where you'll have 50 terrorists in one 15 minute show and one person's not
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:59.200]  white who's a terrorist all the people reporting with terrorist are quote
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.000]  minorities and then now I've seen a whole bunch of other ads where all the
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.760]  terrorists are white and everyone reporting them is is a minority this is
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:15.840]  100% naked in our face to completely rebrand okay the brown people are the
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:21.160]  terrorists that was the earlier branding but we're gonna not not profile
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.520]  we're gonna stick our hands on everybody's pants to know it's now the
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:29.040]  tea partiers and you've got the vice president all these others saying the
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:36.680]  tea partiers are terrorists are gonna kill us so I see a prime mover but I
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:40.120]  need to get hurt in them or somebody do a story on this this this came out three
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:46.600]  days ago four days ago this came actually on 9 6 it's 9 9 right now that on
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:55.480]  Memorial Day Labor Day Monday the the police tried to smuggle huge kegs of
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:26:01.600]  plastic explosives through terminal 4 and then once they got through of course
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.280]  they're supposed to use inert explosives and drills in test then it was quote
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:10.320]  stolen I mean number one they don't use real explosives in drills number two what's
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:15.320]  the chances of the explosives being stolen this just means somebody got
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:18.760]  wise that it wasn't a drill they were trying to get it on the aircraft this
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:23.480]  is the standard way to do it they pick a name on the plane that sounds like they
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:27.240]  can sell it they plant something on the patsy's computer after they raid their
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:31.240]  house or even beforehand you after they've died in the suicide bomb or after
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:35.960]  they've got them in custody and they blow an aircraft up and I think this Phoenix
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:41.880]  police admit mistake and stolen explosives case is that and they could
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:45.600]  have been a tea party or you name it but this article is big here it is
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:49.760]  explosive stolen from Phoenix Airport have been found police say police
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:53.520]  recovered a potentially dangerous container of explosive stolen during a
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:57.800]  training exercise at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix authorities not servants
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:02.160]  said the missing cooler was found Monday morning when a motorist in Phoenix
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:06.680]  spotted the container on the side of the road and learned police a bomb squad
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:09.400]  with the Phoenix Police Department all the same folks that did it with the feds
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:13.440]  cold folks that did it was called the scene and determined that the items
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:17.800]  inside the container had not been tampered with and it goes on to say and
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:23.920]  and there's images of the bombs in another article plastic explosives Bob a
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:28.840]  why would they be trying to ship real plastic explosives through the airport
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:35.320]  onto a plane a and then be statistically that that cooler gets stolen and then
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:39.720]  ends up on the side of the road did their patsy get wise and just get rid of
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:49.360]  it it's a hard call because was there a patsy and also if they want to get it
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:54.720]  through the airport they have no problem doing so because of the police so I
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:28:03.400]  think it was just a setup and probably the suspect will be a member of the tea
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:09.480]  party what else oh I get it they'll claim that a tea party or stole the
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:13.760]  government's bombs that yeah because I'll be clearly they don't you know real
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:17.480]  explosives in a thing and then they get stolen and then left on the side of the
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:23.640]  road it's just the reason I actuary in and the prime thing that pops up is you
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:26.160]  know how they say oh you're part of a drill they blow you up on a train it
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:29.240]  turns out there's a drill of it happening the exact thing or 9-11 they
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:32.840]  think they're part of a drill to see if they alert air marshals that are in test
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:37.560]  and we know that's what happened there at least how they set up the decoys I
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:41.720]  mean I mean that's what I see here is that somebody got wise and something
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:51.160]  happened and you know when I have exercises they don't use live or C4 or
[02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:56.640]  something like that I mean they they use dummies
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:00.960]  yeah well or they have something looks like a bomb and put a little residue on
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:05.640]  it to test the sniffers you don't have a big keg of plastic explosives I mean
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:11.040]  these people make me want to throw up I mean the things that they do are so
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:17.320]  dumb you know it's not only the local law enforcement but the federal government
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:25.240]  as well I did the stories that come up whether just mind-blowing it's dumb it's
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:31.400]  just another effort I think to make people think that there's some real
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:35.480]  terrorists out there who might have intercepted what the government was
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:39.800]  doing or what the police were doing I mean there's a lot of angles to this
[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:43.400]  it's hard yeah the police gonna stop the feds that's another point but then the
[02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:46.920]  cops that's what I said earlier don't want to get busted and for doing the
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:51.720]  right things they just stick it on the side of the road we're on the march the
[02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:58.880]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:34.680]  that's also one of the other specials at 800 686 237 but how good of a deal is
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:40.720]  two silver dollars for 88 bucks with shipping a book and a DVD on top it's
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:47.760]  probably underpriced by 50% but we're bad words if you went and bought it you'd
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:51.640]  pay twice as much but we're still bad though because we told folks by silver
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:38:02.120]  at $5 and now it's where is silver right now oh it's 41 44 off a dollar 9 and
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:07.760]  gold's off 540 right now that's been shooting up and down as it as the stuff
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:12.880]  ping-pongs so I don't know folks I'm trying to knock it down and and the
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:18.560]  physical buy is from China and India and and other countries that they're in
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:25.440]  there buying what they think is very cheap gold and silver well remember gold
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:29.720]  until they devalued their currency or attempted to this week gold's gotten
[02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:33.520]  cheaper in Switzerland the last five years I mean it's it's it's the dollar
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:39.240]  devaluation that's causing this correct gold isn't really going up is it Bob you
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:46.200]  might put it that way yes but the the Switzerland has kept even but there's
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:53.000]  been some years out of the last 11 that they have fallen behind the price of
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:00.160]  gold if you take the nine major currencies and each year you compare
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:05.360]  them with the prices of gold and silver then you'll find that both gold and
[02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:12.960]  silver are up more than 20% each year against those nine currencies but
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:18.440]  within that nine currency structure the Swiss Swiss franc has done the best but
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:22.160]  I don't know about the future you know they're picking a thing at 120 which
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:28.880]  means it can't go any higher so I would think that people who might have gone
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:35.160]  since they made that fix so to speak and in the future they probably would have
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:43.240]  been buying gold instead but my point is I get emails saying well gold's you know
[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:49.920]  almost $1900 you know it's too late to get it well when it was 265 was it too
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:54.040]  late when it was 400 was it too late when it was 800 a thousand twelve hundred
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:57.880]  fifteen hundred sixty hundred seventy hundred eighteen hundred nineteen hundred
[02:39:57.880 --> 02:40:01.680]  I mean when I mean when it's three thousand will it be too late to get it
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:05.680]  because they're devaluing the dollar people are like why is it so much I'm
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:11.120]  like the dollar is being devalued and because they're signaling they're going
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:15.840]  to devalue it further people are trying to get a hedge and now it's not even
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:18.760]  becoming a hedge it's becoming I mean I was even listed in the Bloomberg and
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:22.080]  they had all these top financial experts who usually are busy lying all day and
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:25.360]  they were they were talking about five thousand three thousand they were
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:28.720]  debating will it be five thousand a year or three thousand look I don't know
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:33.240]  I'll be happy of golds fifteen hundred bucks in a year I don't buy it as an
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:38.360]  investment I buy it as a backup because this currencies cannot be trusted but my
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:42.160]  gut tells me and history tells me you know next year sometime we're gonna be
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:45.640]  looking at twenty five hundred now Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan but they're
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:49.960]  saying twenty five hundred this year whatever the point is is I've never
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:54.520]  sold a stinking piece of silver or gold I've bought Bob and gold could go up to
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:59.000]  ten thousand tomorrow I'm not selling it because I'm not gonna cash the gold in
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.960]  for more fiat garbage when this all planes out and something new comes out
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:08.920]  and it starts over I know my gold is gonna save my investment versus losing
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:15.440]  it in hyperinflation so I know I'm better off is it perfect no but we've
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:20.280]  been totally correct and it's been the smart move the only move and then we get
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:25.680]  attacked and criticized it's like saying this guy told me you know to buy
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:31.320]  stock in Ford Motor Company you know for two cents a share and it went up to 20
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:36.440]  bucks a share a year later it's a bad deal this guy told me to you know buy
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:45.720]  stock in Apple you know before it went up 400% I hate him this guy this guy told
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:49.480]  me not to walk in front of a train he's he's scum I mean is it just that some
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:53.840]  people are mad Bob that they didn't get into gold and silver and so they still
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:57.960]  because I've had family I've told you the story extended family laugh at me that
[02:41:57.960 --> 02:42:01.520]  I'm right about gold it's like haha you've been you've had five six seven
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:05.600]  eight-fold increase when everybody else hasn't you're crazy and I'm like okay
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:10.840]  are you are you mentally ill I don't even say that I just go yes how are those
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:19.440]  mashed potatoes you know it's yes yes I'm crazy yes I mean what is this well
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:25.280]  it tells you a lot about people and if they don't think it can happen and they
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:31.840]  don't act on it then they don't talk about it but if it goes up and you did
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:38.280]  it and you said it was going up they will attack you because you've been
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:43.440]  right it's just like the guy who is a great star in whatever field he's in
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:49.720]  and everybody wants to knock him down it's part of human nature I mean I was
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:53.960]  one of the top stock brokers in the world I mean I never it was endless the
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:43:00.000]  attacks and I still get them as a writer and I just ignore them I get I get to I
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:07.720]  get too busy a schedule and too much to do that's positive to listen to that
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:12.760]  garbage yeah and it's not the criticism my mind Bob it's that I feel sorry for
[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:18.240]  them but I guess losers like to try to pull other people down I just don't get
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:21.760]  it when I see somebody successful and they've done it through hard work I
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:28.240]  admire them and I and I feel good that humanity is doing well you know I think
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.840]  more and more I want your view that we're going to calls on this Bob that
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:34.480]  that you can break people into 50 different groups if you want or a
[02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:37.520]  thousand or five different groups but at the end of the day there's two groups
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:42.120]  there's destructive people that hate other humans and don't like others being
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:46.080]  successful whether they're successful or not successful they just don't like it
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:51.320]  and there's people that like goodness and and success and and are optimistic and
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:57.240]  and and believe we can succeed and like seeing other people do good I mean
[02:43:57.240 --> 02:44:00.560]  because I remember being a kid and being shocked that people would be jealous
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:03.760]  that I was really good-looking when I was younger or they would get really
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:08.400]  jealous when I came into a restaurant with a beautiful woman and I just I
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:13.600]  don't understand that you know people versus folks that like you because you're
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.040]  good-looking or smart or whatever and and and then there's but there's others
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:22.960]  who hate you do you see what I'm saying oh yes I've experienced it I've known
[02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:29.000]  people for 20 or 30 years and all of a sudden they become insanely jealous of
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:33.320]  me and it's very disheartening because you know fundamentally you like the
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:38.400]  people but people change because they say what you just said how can he be so
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:43.120]  successful how can he be right all the time how can he be so good-looking and
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:48.600]  so just like you've stated here and but that doesn't make up much of the
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:54.680]  population I don't think I think maybe at the very outset outside it might be
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:45:01.600]  15% I agree but the media is trying to make people artificially like that could
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:10.240]  be because very well be any any sort of discontent is what they like
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:18.960]  anything I mean look at divorces and then you have children I mean I coached
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:26.120]  for 35 years almost every team I had of 12 kids eight didn't have one parent or
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:29.920]  the other and they do that to their children time and I've been studying
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:34.280]  government likes that because it makes the people dependent on government not
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:38.520]  and mom or dad yeah and they sell it I've been studying and I'm not blaming
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:42.560]  women but if you look at it women are sold now that it's really cool to get
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:47.880]  divorced and they're the boss and they and they rationalize when children are
[02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:52.240]  four to three times depending on which actuary likely end up on drugs in
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:58.240]  prison ruined lives if they're divorced and and it's like and and some men are
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:01.280]  bad and leave too but I mean you agree with my statement that more and more
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:06.520]  women just think it's really cool to get a divorce yes I do and and there's
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:12.960]  another factor here I heard her a lot of young men a young men are men under 50
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:19.880]  especially in their 30s that haven't been married they'll run out to someone
[02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:23.920]  who hasn't been married either and they'll get married and I'll have a couple
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:27.840]  of children and the wife will say I don't think I want to live with you
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:34.120]  anymore and then what happens you find out that the woman from the time she was
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:40.920]  perhaps 16 until she was 30 only had lesbian relationships there's a lot of
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:47.200]  that going on and they're just using you to have the kid and then pay them child
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:51.920]  support you notice women don't have to pay it in most cases they they sit there
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:55.920]  they get your kids then and they like it and they love it and the kids are all
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:59.520]  screwed up and society's collapsing but they don't care because the women shows
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:04.400]  and the TV tell them they're winning and they love it just oh it's it's so
[02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:12.600]  scientific how Hitler said first thing at first hand and it's it you know on the
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:19.920]  other side of the coin the life of the male involved gets all messed up as well
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:25.560]  and usually he doesn't want to get married again because of the dreadful
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:31.200]  experience that he had you know you come home and there's your wife and a girl
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:34.640]  from the kids kitchen and they're kissing and they say hey your money's
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:38.160]  mine pal get out of here by the way we're going to shoot the kids up with
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:41.280]  and then the women even like it when the kids get an illness from the vaccine
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:44.720]  then they get to take them and hook them all up with the wires and get
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:51.240]  attention when the kid dies just a real sick society you said it and it's not
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:56.120]  only in America it's another places as well well Hitler said society's so
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:48:00.680]  volatile today that's why you see the demonstrations and the rioting throughout
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:08.080]  the world yes they're frustrated but the cohesion of society all societies is
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:16.240]  not what it was say in the 30s 40s and 50s which is nearby because the government
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:23.200]  has destroyed deliberately the family unit unbelievable let's take some calls
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:27.560]  yeah in Colorado you're a champion holder there you're on the air with Bob
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:35.560]  Chapman go ahead yes my name is yes okay I'm sorry they only had the they had it
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:41.520]  broken into so go ahead okay yeah I wanted to make two comments and ask
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:46.800]  your question my first comment was about that woman caller you shouldn't have paid
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:50.920]  her any mind she didn't have any idea what she was talking about she says she
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:57.320]  listened to you for six years but obviously she hasn't been and if even if
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:03.120]  she did disagree with you I disagree with you but on five percent of what you
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:08.920]  say but that's not the major deal it's about the big things we agree on we should
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:15.800]  agree on that they're trying to kill us yes that should be the biggest point of
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:22.840]  it all yeah why don't we make it about Alex Jones or Yassab or Bob Chapman this
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:25.960]  is about the globalist are attacking everybody they don't care if you're
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:30.480]  Christian Muslim atheists the New World Order is jacking with the food the water
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:35.240]  of everybody they're playing God and we're all fighting with each other
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:39.920]  exactly that's my whole point we're fighting that's how they get us we we
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:44.600]  have a disagreement on one little thing and then we're fighting with it then I
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:48.320]  don't like you and I don't like you for this reason but they're still doing the
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:52.560]  same thing they're killing us and people need to understand that my second
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:59.520]  point is all like I said 9 11 and they're killing us in any kind of way
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:05.480]  and taking our freedom away and these Christians don't understand what they
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:09.120]  have to think they have to stand down because they think they're gonna give
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:16.200]  rapture but they don't realize in history and for 1800 years most feel
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:21.360]  loaded and people that believe in the scriptures they knew that the rapture
[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:25.800]  was not happening at the end when all the tribulation was over a five-year-old
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:29.320]  could read that it says when the angel comes and grabs the devil and puts him
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:33.040]  in the pit that's when the dead in Christ rise of a five-year-old can
[02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:37.440]  understand that you're absolutely right exactly and it was a British
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:45.440]  advantage of John Nelson Garvey they started that in 1900 yep people they
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:50.920]  need to search research and do the history and another question I want you
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:53.560]  to finish this is a great call do five minutes overdrive with Bob's we can get
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:57.680]  to Don Sheldon Otter Robert we'll get to everybody but quickly finish call her
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:51:01.960]  when we come back we'll get Bob Chapman's take on this why is it so many
[02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:05.720]  people suffer from so many illnesses today why don't doctors know how to help
[02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:09.160]  you could it be that our doctors don't know how because there's a nutrition
[02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:13.600]  solution and they only know about drugs over 68 diseases are known to be
[02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:17.120]  connected to a deficiency of glutathione the missing ingredient to

[02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:55.080]  christians if they think they are just fake christians if they think they're
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:58.120]  gonna make it to heaven we're not standing up for what's right and what's
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:02.640]  righteous there's sadly mistake okay going back to the question I have a
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:11.120]  question there do you know anything about the king Alfred plan king Alfred
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:16.640]  plan Chapman don't know never heard it it rings the bell with me but I can't
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:21.280]  remember what it is go ahead call or tell us what it is it's basically about
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:28.000]  how they're going around the world and killing up all the the color people but
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:33.880]  then they revised it in the wrecks 84 about how they're gonna do in America
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:39.720]  with all the black people they put the Hispanics on it too no I was aware of the
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:43.680]  king Alfred plan yeah no no it's admitted the king Alfred plan was a
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:48.120]  fictional CIA led scheme supporting international effort to eliminate people
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:51.760]  of Africa and essentially it defined how to deal with the threat of black
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:56.720]  uprising United States the plan first appeared in John A. Williams novel the
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:01.920]  man who cried I am a fictionalized account but again it goes into the fact
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:06.960]  that it was probably something mirroring real plans like Rex 84 Bob any
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:13.040]  comments no now that you speak of it I've heard of the plan but I really don't
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:16.360]  know much about it all right sir I got a jump get to a few other people good to
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:21.800]  hear from you okay let's I just lost my phone list I tell you this computerized
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:27.640]  phone system drives me insane John who's up next there Don and Michigan you're on
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:35.360]  the air go ahead hey Don is that down in Michigan yep that's you buddy okay
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:39.840]  broke up I'm sorry hey real quick I know you're running short on time and I don't
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:44.440]  mean to keep addressing Nina but I want to let her know that a couple people that
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:48.520]  scare me more than her virgin husband or her people or whatever she wants to
[02:56:48.520 --> 02:56:53.720]  call him is John McCain and Joe Lieberman any persons including a US
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:57.760]  citizen can be detained for the duration of a conflict the enemy
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:02.160]  belligerent act so I would be more I would be the hair would stand up on my
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:06.520]  neck more running into John McCain at 711 then it would her husband well
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:10.360]  that's right they try to scare us with the Muslims and then try to put in these
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:14.000]  laws to just have us disappear into a dungeon and the government says they
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:18.080]  can do that Obama says that right and then I'm trying to be really quick as I
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:21.120]  know you're running time but another point I want to make was do you want a
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:24.920]  pretty doctor to give surgery to your three-year-old or do you want somebody
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:28.880]  with an excellent record of my point there is do you want somebody with pretty
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:33.680]  hair like Romney or or Perry or do you want Ron Paul with a perfect record I'm
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:37.240]  gonna pick Ron Paul with a perfect record to take care of my kid exactly I
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:41.840]  want the specialist who has the best record of success not the little cutesy
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:46.080]  doctor that's what you check for and that's a I'm gonna steal that analogy
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:50.520]  did you come up with that because that is very effective to say hey we're going
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:54.280]  to a doctor it isn't about looks it's about their record and Ron Paul's got a
[02:57:54.280 --> 02:57:58.360]  perfect record now if I'm scared to death and my kid might be in danger I'm
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:02.200]  gonna go look at their their histories I'm gonna look at the best doctor I'm
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:07.920]  gonna say I don't care if you look like an ogre but one last thing because I'm
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:11.120]  trying to be really quick because I know you're so short another idea for
[02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:14.440]  getting out the information one thing I do I've given out about a thousand DVDs
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:18.240]  and now that I've given lots a lot of people I know what I do is I just get
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:22.720]  the paper sleeves they're cheap right the name of the DVD right info wars calm

[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:17.440]  Sheldon in Wisconsin you're on the air with Bob Chapman go ahead
[03:00:17.440 --> 03:00:21.440]  hi good afternoon mr. Jones have a quick question for you
[03:00:21.440 --> 03:00:28.040]  besides the oily pates and Larry Sinclair is there anybody out here who has
[03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:35.440]  tried to file a lawsuit for impeachment for mr. Soar Toro and then yeah
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:39.560]  question for mr. Chapman sure Phil Berg has tried and the courts basically throw
[03:00:39.560 --> 03:00:43.640]  it all out and I tell you I'm just gonna tell you his uncle that's the illegal
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:47.600]  alien and all that looks nothing like him his dad looks nothing like him and
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:51.920]  the intel I've got from Wayne Madsen who again is a big liberal he is he's not
[03:00:51.920 --> 03:00:55.200]  bashing Obama because he's you know he doesn't like him because he's black or
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:01:05.440]  whatever is that he is basically his dad is a is a you know part Hispanic part
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:09.640]  black guy from Cuba but I mean you can just look at it his dad is not his dad
[03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:13.440]  and even the state after I heard this years later the State Department came
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:17.560]  out and had to release the documents that at major universities his dad got
[03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:21.360]  kicked out for getting a bunch of women pregnant and then it was fake and then
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:26.840]  he had fake marriages with women that had other husbands and I'm sorry your
[03:01:26.840 --> 03:01:32.200]  question for Bob Chapman yeah well but to piggyback on what you were saying
[03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:38.560]  mr. Soar Toro just got caught I believe a few weeks ago filing an income tax
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:42.760]  with an invalid social security number I'm paying for that and along with the
