[00:00.000 --> 00:10.500]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.500 --> 00:11.500]  You want answers?
[00:11.500 --> 00:13.500]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.500 --> 00:17.820]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.820 --> 00:38.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.220 --> 00:40.020]  Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:40.020 --> 00:45.340]  Thank you for joining us on this very important 20th day of August, 2008.
[00:45.340 --> 00:51.900]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours, guess who we have joining us today.
[00:51.900 --> 00:59.060]  In 30 minutes from now, Congressman Ron Paul, on a host of final issues, Paul Joseph Watson
[00:59.060 --> 01:05.420]  on the war in the frontiers with Russia on the Russian front, on the police state in
[01:05.420 --> 01:09.900]  England, on a host of other issues, Jonathan Allenoff.
[01:09.900 --> 01:16.340]  We are Change Colorado as we give you some lead-up reporting on what's happening in Denver,
[01:16.340 --> 01:23.140]  this giant in-cap or promotional event for martial law for the rest of the country.
[01:23.140 --> 01:30.900]  Wayne Madsen, the former NSA officer, and Peter Dale Scott, top professor on government
[01:30.900 --> 01:33.620]  narcotics trafficking and government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:33.620 --> 01:39.580]  So, Ron Paul, Paul Watson, Jonathan Allenoff, Wayne Madsen, and Peter Dale Scott today for
[01:39.580 --> 01:41.540]  you.
[01:41.540 --> 01:43.860]  I am going to be here live tomorrow.
[01:43.860 --> 01:45.820]  I haven't decided whether I want to run a best of.
[01:45.820 --> 01:50.060]  I have a whole bunch of the wonderful interviews we've done the last few months on Friday because
[01:50.060 --> 01:54.020]  I'm just not going to be able to leave town Friday night if I don't take off Friday.
[01:54.020 --> 02:00.020]  I may just have Jason Burmus sit in, but he's busy with the fabled enemies website and some
[02:00.020 --> 02:03.300]  new trailers and a bunch of work he's doing, but he wants to do the show Friday.
[02:03.300 --> 02:06.300]  You'll probably hear Jason Burmus on the show Friday.
[02:06.300 --> 02:11.180]  I know he's doing the Sunday show, and Jason will be doing next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[02:11.180 --> 02:17.900]  Thursday, Friday here on air while I call in live from the DNC.
[02:17.900 --> 02:27.180]  Also, we're going to have a live video feed at least one hour today up on infowars.com,
[02:27.180 --> 02:29.100]  free to the public.
[02:29.100 --> 02:32.940]  And when I go down to the FEMA camp, probably Monday or Tuesday, we'll have a live video
[02:32.940 --> 02:37.220]  in case the police start shotgunning us or beating our heads with clubs or murdering
[02:37.220 --> 02:41.500]  us or God knows what and saying that we pulled out weapons on them.
[02:41.500 --> 02:46.100]  We'll have video of us defenselessly being bludgeoned by demons of hell on the least
[02:46.100 --> 02:48.180]  to destroy the country.
[02:48.180 --> 02:49.860]  That's what it is.
[02:49.860 --> 02:54.340]  So we're going to be there with the live video rolling out.
[02:54.340 --> 02:58.860]  This technology is devastating to them, devastating to enemy forces.
[02:58.860 --> 03:03.500]  We can show their lives and show you who their father is.
[03:03.500 --> 03:08.260]  I love exposing your evil.
[03:08.260 --> 03:12.460]  NATO suspends formal contacts with Russia.
[03:12.460 --> 03:15.900]  Merrill Lynch, Wachovian, danger of failing.
[03:15.900 --> 03:19.860]  You that have helped the parasites will now reap the whirlwind.
[03:19.860 --> 03:21.660]  You have showed it.
[03:21.660 --> 03:25.540]  MSNBC reports Bush is creating an embryonic police state.
[03:25.540 --> 03:36.260]  Well, if it's embryonic, then a NFL lineman is an embryonic male or a 35-year-old woman
[03:36.260 --> 03:37.740]  is an embryonic female.
[03:37.740 --> 03:39.700]  No, it's not embryonic.
[03:39.700 --> 03:45.220]  It is glistening, armored all around you, constantly scanning everything, building
[03:45.220 --> 03:51.020]  giant death camps, bringing in hardened felons to join the police force and military, building
[03:51.020 --> 03:54.700]  giant forces of darkness all around you.
[03:54.700 --> 04:00.780]  Like embryonic, they're just now getting around to telling you and admitting it's all being
[04:00.780 --> 04:01.780]  passed.
[04:01.780 --> 04:06.820]  It's all oiled and loved and machined and all being passed to the Democrats, the new
[04:06.820 --> 04:11.940]  guardians of evil, if there to be elected, or the new guardian of evil, John McCain,
[04:11.940 --> 04:15.060]  there's nothing new.
[04:15.060 --> 04:18.900]  Don't worry, all of you that have served evil, you're going to get to see real evil
[04:18.900 --> 04:23.620]  very soon, everything you love, everything you want, everything that attracts you like
[04:23.620 --> 04:27.220]  a moth to the flame.
[04:27.220 --> 04:32.060]  NSA security officer, we should just kill these people, speaking of bloggers, that from
[04:32.060 --> 04:34.220]  Wayne Madsen, who's really turned out to be an accurate source.
[04:34.220 --> 04:36.380]  I hope he's wrong on this.
[04:36.380 --> 04:39.820]  Man arrested and locked up for five hours, also physically attacked, and for taking photo
[04:39.820 --> 04:43.260]  of a police van that was going the wrong way down the street.
[04:43.260 --> 05:01.780]  Pop just came out and said, you don't take a photo of God, you kneel to me, flame.
[05:01.780 --> 05:06.980]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[05:06.980 --> 05:10.940]  on, and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[05:10.940 --> 05:16.220]  This rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.780]  to tell their story.
[05:17.780 --> 05:26.820]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[05:26.820 --> 05:30.940]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth, as brave souls throughout the
[05:30.940 --> 05:33.860]  world take action against their global masters.
[05:33.860 --> 05:37.860]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown, he takes his hand off
[05:37.860 --> 05:42.820]  and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[05:42.820 --> 05:46.300]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[05:52.140 --> 05:54.820]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[05:54.820 --> 05:58.460]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[05:58.460 --> 06:00.500]  and bring in martial law.
[06:00.500 --> 06:05.020]  Hello, this is Tom with hempusa.org.

[07:58.660 --> 08:01.540]  Provider and licensing details are available.
[08:01.540 --> 08:15.820]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:15.820 --> 08:21.860]  All over Europe, all over England, all over the United States, just like Communist China.
[08:21.860 --> 08:25.020]  Those are beating people up, you videotape them 100 yards away, they come over and beat
[08:25.020 --> 08:27.020]  you up and charge you with assaulting them.
[08:27.020 --> 08:31.140]  You try to just peacefully videotape them, they come over and arrest you and charge you
[08:31.140 --> 08:32.420]  with attacking them.
[08:32.420 --> 08:35.980]  On video, you don't touch them, they just commit crimes right on video.
[08:35.980 --> 08:38.940]  Evil and corruption is now authorized.
[08:38.940 --> 08:43.700]  They are rewarded in most major departments for this now.
[08:43.700 --> 08:47.060]  Darkness is descending quickly and then I see the very same case out of England, this
[08:47.060 --> 08:49.860]  cop should drive down the wrong way of the street park.
[08:49.860 --> 08:54.220]  Of course, this fella had been ticketed before for doing a similar thing, he lives there,
[08:54.220 --> 08:59.380]  so he gets out and takes a photo and the police run out and the cop knocks the camera out
[08:59.380 --> 09:04.260]  of his hands, grabs him, slams him down and then charges him with assaulting the officer
[09:04.260 --> 09:08.980]  with the camera.
[09:08.980 --> 09:13.220]  You know, every day I see a report about SWAT teams going to the wrong house.
[09:13.220 --> 09:14.220]  Every day.
[09:14.220 --> 09:15.220]  I'm not even looking for them.
[09:15.220 --> 09:16.220]  Every day.
[09:16.220 --> 09:18.220]  I might not see one for two days, but then I'll see two or three stories in one day.
[09:18.220 --> 09:22.500]  That's about every day where they go to the wrong house, not the right house, the wrong
[09:22.500 --> 09:23.500]  house.
[09:23.500 --> 09:25.420]  You only hear about it when it's the wrong house.
[09:25.420 --> 09:31.580]  They shoot the family Chihuahua, Beagle, Chained, Labrador, the dogs will run and they will
[09:31.580 --> 09:35.220]  gun them down, shooting them in the hind quarters.
[09:35.220 --> 09:38.460]  These guys are the type that you take deer hunting and they call it buck fever and they
[09:38.460 --> 09:39.460]  can...
[09:39.460 --> 09:42.580]  I've known deer hunters back when I had a lot of time to deer hunt many moons ago.
[09:42.580 --> 09:48.180]  I like I saw a deer hunting two years ago when I had time, but the point is that...
[09:48.180 --> 09:53.900]  They would hunt for years in areas just full of big deer, nice racks, they could never
[09:53.900 --> 09:54.900]  shoot one.
[09:54.900 --> 09:57.780]  They were great shots at the range too, you know, they had a little range there at One
[09:57.780 --> 09:58.780]  Deer Camp.
[09:58.780 --> 10:02.980]  The great shots, but when they saw a buck, they'd start shaking and it's the same thing
[10:02.980 --> 10:06.020]  with these SWAT team guys, especially in the middle sized towns where they're really not
[10:06.020 --> 10:07.220]  well trained.
[10:07.220 --> 10:16.340]  They just dogs he'd run and they just, you know, I want to kill something.
[10:16.340 --> 10:19.140]  And they defend that.
[10:19.140 --> 10:28.540]  They defend the killing of the dogs, but then if you yell at a police dog, you get gel time.
[10:28.540 --> 10:32.220]  I have seen at least three national attention stories.
[10:32.220 --> 10:36.980]  The first one was eight years ago in Newcastle, Pennsylvania, Associated Press.
[10:36.980 --> 10:40.300]  I have a story memorized, I must have covered it on there 20 times.
[10:40.300 --> 10:44.660]  I'm covering it 21st time right now or whatever it is, 50th time, I don't know.
[10:44.660 --> 10:51.420]  One of the guys walking through a parking lot and a police dog, the wind is down.
[10:51.420 --> 10:56.060]  It's in the summer and the police dog's head lunges out, snarling and trying to bite him.
[10:56.060 --> 11:05.580]  And he screams, oh my God, oh my God, F-U dog.
[11:05.580 --> 11:09.420]  The officer's walking out, sees it, runs, grabs him, tackles him, takes him to jail.
[11:09.420 --> 11:13.100]  He was charged, he was convicted and he was given, you know, you can go pull the article
[11:13.100 --> 11:17.140]  up, I believe it was two year sentence, but I think it was cut down for yelling at a dog.
[11:17.140 --> 11:18.820]  That was called assault by the court.
[11:18.820 --> 11:25.660]  That's how fraudulent these courts are, what criminal jokes they are.
[11:25.660 --> 11:28.180]  Now that just so happens to have happened to me five or six times.
[11:28.180 --> 11:32.780]  Even eight years ago when I first heard of that happening, I had had that happen to me,
[11:32.780 --> 11:37.260]  I think it was in a Target parking lot one time with a big dog.
[11:37.260 --> 11:40.860]  One time it was even a shepherd in the back of a cab of a pickup truck.
[11:40.860 --> 11:42.420]  I'm sure it's happened to all of you.
[11:42.420 --> 11:45.500]  You out there have been in parking lots and the dogs are sleeping there.
[11:45.500 --> 11:48.140]  You're walking in a restaurant, you're walking in the mall, you're walking in the grocery
[11:48.140 --> 11:51.100]  store, and all of a sudden it's on a short chain.
[11:51.100 --> 11:53.420]  Over the side you're like, oh my God, whoa.
[11:53.420 --> 11:57.260]  And then yeah, I'm frankly, I'm a primitive human, I scream back, you piece of fill, I'm
[11:57.260 --> 12:03.340]  just walking through the parking lot.
[12:03.340 --> 12:12.860]  You don't do that to a God's dog because a dog of King Zeus is a God to you.
[12:12.860 --> 12:19.020]  I've seen people get 20, 30, 40 years in prison for shooting a police dog when they
[12:19.020 --> 12:22.300]  send it into the house.
[12:22.300 --> 12:26.220]  Any Houston a few years ago, they had this thing with helicopters and giant parades
[12:26.220 --> 12:30.180]  for some police dog.
[12:30.180 --> 12:35.020]  And the point is that they can hold two opposite completely different ideas.
[12:35.020 --> 12:39.140]  Your dog is a piece of fill to be gunned down in the back.
[12:39.140 --> 12:43.580]  But their dog is a God because it's about setting a precedent that you are beneath
[12:43.580 --> 12:44.580]  their animals.
[12:44.580 --> 12:51.580]  Next time I get the awesome police chief in here, I'm going to actually print up some
[12:51.580 --> 12:55.980]  of those articles asking me if a police dog is better than a human.
[12:55.980 --> 13:00.260]  I've seen cases of where a police dog just goes crazy walking down the street with cops
[13:00.260 --> 13:05.820]  and starts biting some innocent person and the person kicks it in the mouth and is charged
[13:05.820 --> 13:09.380]  and gets jail time because they are officers.
[13:09.380 --> 13:14.340]  They see police when a cop gets killed 90 plus percent of the time, they hunt down who
[13:14.340 --> 13:17.060]  killed the cop and they go to prison and get the death penalty.
[13:17.060 --> 13:20.580]  I know the conviction rates above 90 percent.
[13:20.580 --> 13:27.340]  When a slave human, a bond slave of the government is killed, they solve less than 10 percent
[13:27.340 --> 13:31.980]  of murders.
[13:31.980 --> 13:38.740]  So when a God is killed, they catch the mere mortal 90 percent of the time.
[13:38.740 --> 13:47.340]  But when a mere slave mortal is killed, they only catch him 10 percent of the time.
[13:47.340 --> 13:51.260]  Now the police have gotten a little upset and it's kind of like Robbie the robot cannot
[13:51.260 --> 13:53.380]  compute.
[13:53.380 --> 14:02.100]  In California, in Texas, in Nevada, in Arizona, in New Mexico, where every couple days I read
[14:02.100 --> 14:07.740]  about a cop, an FBI, federal, state, local being killed by an illegal alien who runs
[14:07.740 --> 14:13.140]  back to Mexico and Mexico won't even extradite him up here and then in a lot of cases they
[14:13.140 --> 14:14.700]  let them go.
[14:14.700 --> 14:20.940]  If they're connected to drug cartels, is that who runs Mexico?
[14:20.940 --> 14:23.100]  And the police are like, well, we can't have this.
[14:23.100 --> 14:26.940]  Well, why when it happens to us, the dirt level citizens, it's all right.
[14:26.940 --> 14:29.980]  I mean, I don't want cops getting killed.
[14:29.980 --> 14:30.980]  I think it's horrible.
[14:30.980 --> 14:32.700]  I think I wish no police were killed in line of duty.
[14:32.700 --> 14:36.100]  Maybe they wouldn't be so militarized and crazy and act like when they pull old ladies
[14:36.100 --> 14:42.420]  over that they pulled over Godzilla.
[14:42.420 --> 14:47.380]  I don't like your dogs being better than me and I don't like you treating our dogs like
[14:47.380 --> 14:53.860]  they're worth nothing.
[14:53.860 --> 14:58.860]  I went to one time for an access TV show we did years ago, about nine years ago I went
[14:58.860 --> 15:03.940]  to one house where the police came in.
[15:03.940 --> 15:08.860]  The chained lab was in the kitchen, chained up on his bed.
[15:08.860 --> 15:12.940]  He growled at them like any dog would do and they shot the dog a whole bunch of times.
[15:12.940 --> 15:14.500]  Bullets, brains all over the wall and I was there.
[15:14.500 --> 15:15.500]  I saw the brains.
[15:15.500 --> 15:19.820]  They'd remove the dog and then fired through the wall wildly and a bullet went through
[15:19.820 --> 15:26.820]  the wall and lodged one inch above the baby crib.
[15:26.820 --> 15:32.700]  Just down off First Street right down by the river.
[15:32.700 --> 15:36.660]  That was the Austin SWAT team.
[15:36.660 --> 15:42.220]  Just wildly spraying bullets when they come in the back door of some little hippie house
[15:42.220 --> 15:46.900]  looking for marijuana.
[15:46.900 --> 15:49.340]  God help us.
[15:49.340 --> 15:51.260]  And there are all of these surveillance grids.
[15:51.260 --> 15:54.500]  They're federalizing local police, building the command centers.
[15:54.500 --> 15:55.780]  Many of them are already built.
[15:55.780 --> 15:59.220]  Building secret prisons than denying they exist and when they get caught saying you don't
[15:59.220 --> 16:03.020]  have a right to know citizens about secret local prisons.
[16:03.020 --> 16:07.500]  The military industrial complex is eating the United States.
[16:07.500 --> 16:09.500]  And what does Keith Oberman do?
[16:09.500 --> 16:13.540]  Keith makes it a partisan issue of George Bush.
[16:13.540 --> 16:17.660]  But then it goes on to admit that the Washington Post reported it's all being standardized and
[16:17.660 --> 16:20.580]  transferred over to whoever comes in next in office.
[16:20.580 --> 16:21.740]  Bush is a puppet.
[16:21.740 --> 16:23.020]  This has been growing for decades.
[16:23.020 --> 16:26.260]  Let's go ahead and play part of that MSNBC piece to analyze it.
[16:26.260 --> 16:37.340]  Of course, persons and also my special comment on Mr. McCain's ambition ahead.
[16:37.340 --> 16:39.380]  Number three, support the troops gate.
[16:39.380 --> 16:44.340]  Remember that is a brand name, not actual support, 20 soldiers at the Army Wounded Vets
[16:44.340 --> 16:49.020]  Medical Center at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, telling USA Today that the facility there is just
[16:49.020 --> 16:55.180]  like part of the Walter Reed Center for Wounded Vets in Washington was infested by mold.
[16:55.180 --> 16:57.660]  Medellation ducts were reported encrusted with the mold.
[16:57.660 --> 17:02.660]  Medellation ducts in two of the barracks each is made up of 48 rooms filled with wounded
[17:02.660 --> 17:04.260]  soldiers and their family.
[17:04.260 --> 17:07.460]  The commanding officer at Fort Sill says they're working on it now.
[17:07.460 --> 17:10.500]  Number two, that's why they call it counterintelligence gate.
[17:10.500 --> 17:12.180]  The Pentagon has a new unit.
[17:12.180 --> 17:18.180]  The Defense Intelligence Agency Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center.
[17:18.180 --> 17:23.020]  It will have within it an office dedicated to strategic offensive counterintelligence
[17:23.020 --> 17:24.020]  operations.
[17:24.020 --> 17:29.380]  As part of the cardinal tenet of American law, such operations spying on people who are
[17:29.380 --> 17:33.340]  known or suspected to be foreign intelligence officers or connected to foreign intelligence
[17:33.340 --> 17:38.500]  or international terrorist activities, that will of course be carried out abroad.
[17:38.500 --> 17:40.820]  Also in this country.
[17:40.820 --> 17:44.340]  And number one in case that's not direct enough, domestic spying gate.
[17:44.340 --> 17:48.700]  Now that the Democrats were nice enough to fold up on FISA, the issue is all contained
[17:48.700 --> 17:50.260]  now, right?
[17:50.260 --> 17:51.260]  Not exactly.
[17:51.260 --> 17:54.900]  The Justice Department wants to revise the federal government's rules for intelligence
[17:54.900 --> 18:00.660]  gathering by state and local police, making it easier to share anything those police find
[18:00.660 --> 18:04.980]  about U.S. citizens with the federal government and all the intelligence agencies.
[18:04.980 --> 18:10.220]  But let all those federal agencies retain all that information for as much as a decade.
[18:10.220 --> 18:13.180]  Not that the local police would be able to do anything about it if they didn't like it
[18:13.180 --> 18:17.740]  since this would apply to all 18,000 local agencies who get any kind of funding for the
[18:17.740 --> 18:18.740]  feds.
[18:18.740 --> 18:24.500]  The point of this, to increase our security and counter terror threats, no.
[18:24.500 --> 18:28.460]  To pass these changes before Mr. Bush leaves office so that the next president can't do
[18:28.460 --> 18:34.380]  a damned thing about unraveling this disaster, which is, appropriately enough, an embryonic
[18:34.380 --> 18:35.540]  police state.
[18:35.540 --> 18:42.460]  This were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the
[18:42.460 --> 18:43.460]  dictator.
[18:43.460 --> 18:46.300]  Let me explain to the police shop though what this is for.
[18:46.300 --> 18:50.740]  This is so they can take your grandmother and grandfather's pension fund.
[18:50.740 --> 18:52.540]  It's so they can take your pension fund.
[18:52.540 --> 18:58.820]  It's so they can enforceably inject you as they tried five years ago with smallpox vaccine.
[18:58.820 --> 19:02.740]  But they gave 4,000 people and a whole bunch of them died of the 4,000 that took it, so
[19:02.740 --> 19:03.940]  the cops said no.
[19:03.940 --> 19:04.940]  The firemen said no.
[19:04.940 --> 19:06.700]  It's so they can make you do it.
[19:06.700 --> 19:08.300]  Do you understand?
[19:08.300 --> 19:10.300]  You are building your own cage.
[19:10.300 --> 19:13.060]  You are going along with all of this.
[19:13.060 --> 19:14.260]  This isn't freedom.
[19:14.260 --> 19:15.260]  This isn't liberty.
[19:15.260 --> 19:20.140]  They always tell you about the domestic spying after it's already been in place.
[19:20.140 --> 19:28.460]  Look, in 1978 the state police in Texas were caught with files on over 100,000 Texans,
[19:28.460 --> 19:33.180]  prominent preachers, politicians spying, listening to everyone.
[19:33.180 --> 19:39.260]  This is nothing new, ladies and gentlemen, and these criminal groups use this intelligence
[19:39.260 --> 19:43.500]  gathering for business, for blackmail, for narcotics trafficking.
[19:43.500 --> 19:49.780]  I mean, even Fahrenheit 9-11 that came out four years ago reports the local peace group
[19:49.780 --> 19:53.780]  that begs cookies once a week, they had the local sheriff's department with a federal
[19:53.780 --> 19:55.300]  grant spying on them.
[19:55.300 --> 19:56.700]  You understand?
[19:56.700 --> 20:01.500]  And trying to get them to carry out violence, of course.
[20:01.500 --> 20:06.740]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[20:06.740 --> 20:08.260]  against this country.
[20:08.260 --> 20:10.500]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[20:10.500 --> 20:12.500]  But who is the enemy?
[20:12.500 --> 20:17.500]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[20:17.500 --> 20:22.260]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[20:22.260 --> 20:24.860]  networks inside the United States.
[20:24.860 --> 20:29.340]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[20:29.340 --> 20:31.500]  in and on the U.S.
[20:31.500 --> 20:35.140]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[20:35.140 --> 20:40.660]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[20:40.660 --> 20:44.820]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[20:44.820 --> 20:45.820]  much more.
[20:45.820 --> 20:46.820]  Fabled Enemies.
[20:46.820 --> 20:51.780]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of
[20:51.780 --> 20:53.780]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[20:53.780 --> 21:02.340]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[21:02.340 --> 21:06.180]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[21:06.180 --> 21:07.680]  dollar has been evaluating.
[21:07.680 --> 21:11.500]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[21:11.500 --> 21:14.420]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[21:14.420 --> 21:16.500]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[21:16.500 --> 21:19.820]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[21:19.820 --> 21:26.660]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them
[21:26.660 --> 21:32.420]  both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold
[21:32.420 --> 21:35.540]  and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[21:35.540 --> 21:37.700]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[21:37.700 --> 21:44.900]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[21:52.780 --> 21:55.740]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[21:55.740 --> 22:00.540]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[22:00.540 --> 22:02.540]  Hey Clyde!
[22:02.540 --> 22:03.540]  What's up, Bonnie?
[22:03.540 --> 22:07.820]  Well, I got a question about those shielded Secure Sleeves from Identity Stronghold.
[22:07.820 --> 22:11.340]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards
[22:11.340 --> 22:12.860]  with RFID chips.
[22:12.860 --> 22:13.860]  What about them?
[22:13.860 --> 22:16.980]  Well, I mentioned them to our friends and they went in for them purchasing the Secure
[22:16.980 --> 22:17.980]  Sleeves.
[22:17.980 --> 22:19.060]  Oh, Bonnie?
[22:19.060 --> 22:22.700]  If everyone starts hearing about the Secure Sleeve, it'll destroy our plan to steal credit
[22:22.700 --> 22:25.380]  card numbers at the mall with my new RFID reader.
[22:25.380 --> 22:27.300]  I know, but these are our friends, Clyde.
[22:27.300 --> 22:29.100]  They promise not to tell anyone else.
[22:29.100 --> 22:30.100]  I guess you're right.
[22:30.100 --> 22:32.100]  That's what friends are for, I suppose.
[22:32.100 --> 22:35.540]  Tell them they can get a five-pack of Secure Sleeves that will fit credit cards and driver's
[22:35.540 --> 22:37.860]  licenses for $19.95.
[22:37.860 --> 22:43.260]  And Identity Stronghold also has a three-pack of Secure Sleeves for passport books for $14.95.
[22:43.260 --> 22:44.540]  And where do they buy them?
[22:44.540 --> 22:48.460]  They can buy them online or get a mail-in order form at idstronghold.com.
[22:48.460 --> 22:49.460]  idstronghold.com.
[22:49.460 --> 22:52.820]  Okay, well, what if they don't have the internet?
[22:52.820 --> 22:56.540]  They can call 1-800-610-2770.
[22:56.540 --> 22:59.940]  That's 800-610-2770.
[22:59.940 --> 23:01.940]  Thanks, Clyde.
[23:01.940 --> 23:05.260]  How much longer will you ignore the warning signs?
[23:05.260 --> 23:07.260]  How much longer?
[23:07.260 --> 23:10.100]  How much longer will you turn away like a blind man?
[23:10.100 --> 23:11.100]  How much longer?
[23:11.100 --> 23:12.100]  A choice.
[23:12.100 --> 23:16.100]  A choice of life or death, abundance or starvation is made today.
[23:16.100 --> 23:19.460]  Do you have a long-term food solution?

[23:45.980 --> 23:46.980]  Patriots prepare.
[23:46.980 --> 23:47.980]  Patriots prepare.
[23:47.980 --> 23:48.980]  Slaves, hesitate.
[23:48.980 --> 23:49.980]  Soon will soon.
[23:49.980 --> 23:51.980]  We'll know which one you are.
[23:51.980 --> 23:53.980]  Soon we'll know which one you are.
[23:53.980 --> 23:55.620]  You have no more excuses.
[23:55.620 --> 23:58.620]  You have no more excuses.
[23:58.620 --> 24:12.620]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[24:12.620 --> 24:17.620]  Is it getting better?
[24:17.620 --> 24:22.620]  Or do you feel the same?
[24:22.620 --> 24:26.620]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[24:26.620 --> 24:30.620]  Got someone to blame?
[24:30.620 --> 24:36.620]  You said one love, one life, one life.
[24:36.620 --> 24:42.620]  When it's one knee in the night, in the night.
[24:42.620 --> 24:45.620]  One love, we get to share it.
[24:45.620 --> 24:48.620]  It leaves you baby, it leaves you baby.
[24:48.620 --> 25:03.620]  If you don't care for it.
[25:03.620 --> 25:07.620]  Did I disappoint you?
[25:07.620 --> 25:13.620]  Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
[25:13.620 --> 25:21.620]  You act like you never had love, and you want me to go without.
[25:21.620 --> 25:26.620]  NATO suspends formal contract with Russia.
[25:26.620 --> 25:29.620]  Bosphorus of Belgium.
[25:29.620 --> 25:33.620]  NATO upholds its punches against Russia on a Tuesday.
[25:33.620 --> 25:41.620]  Suspending formal contacts as punishment for the Georgian invasion.
[25:41.620 --> 25:43.620]  Did you hear that?
[25:43.620 --> 25:46.620]  That NATO is pulling its ambassadors from Russia?
[25:46.620 --> 25:52.620]  I mean, that's the next step before war.
[25:52.620 --> 25:56.620]  But bucking US pressure for more severe penalties.
[25:56.620 --> 25:58.620]  More severe.
[25:58.620 --> 26:03.620]  The Russian ambassador to NATO played down the impact of the emergency meeting on the Western alliance.
[26:03.620 --> 26:09.620]  The mountain gave birth to a mouse, said Dmitry Rogazin.
[26:09.620 --> 26:13.620]  Although the allies said they would not convene any more meetings.
[26:13.620 --> 26:16.620]  The NATO Russian Council, the Russian troops withdraw from Georgia.
[26:16.620 --> 26:29.620]  They bound to concerns from Europe, which depends heavily on Russia for energy and stop short of adopting specific long term steps to punish Moscow for its actions.
[26:29.620 --> 26:32.620]  You got to love that associated press headline.
[26:32.620 --> 26:34.620]  It's every headline is punish Russia.
[26:34.620 --> 26:36.620]  Russia's preemptive out of the blue invasion.
[26:36.620 --> 26:38.620]  Russia attacked Georgia.
[26:38.620 --> 26:43.620]  Man, are we going to let Russia get away with the crime they've committed?
[26:43.620 --> 26:47.620]  But they know it's a gullible public.
[26:47.620 --> 26:53.620]  And so they can blame Russia for what they have done.
[26:53.620 --> 26:59.620]  And move weapons systems, even more weapons systems in all around them, escalating things.
[26:59.620 --> 27:05.620]  Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch will covia in danger of failing, says top strategist.
[27:05.620 --> 27:17.620]  Merrill Lynch will covia other financial companies under a risk of failure as the cost of raising capital sores at a time when the banks need to pay settlements over auction rate securities.
[27:17.620 --> 27:23.620]  David Coddick, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland advisors told CNBC today.
[27:23.620 --> 27:26.620]  I think the financial problem is halfway through the cycle.
[27:26.620 --> 27:28.620]  There's another shoe to drop ahead of us.
[27:28.620 --> 27:30.620]  And it could be more severe.
[27:30.620 --> 27:37.620]  And so that's what's going on.
[27:37.620 --> 27:41.620]  And it goes on from there.
[27:41.620 --> 27:44.620]  The cash companies need to shore up bad investments.
[27:44.620 --> 27:46.620]  It's up to about 500 billion.
[27:46.620 --> 27:49.620]  We'll probably top 100 billion before it's all over.
[27:49.620 --> 27:50.620]  Billion.
[27:50.620 --> 27:53.620]  They've already pumped in something like 900 billion.
[27:53.620 --> 27:59.620]  And he went on to say that it's Merrill Lynch and want covia could go under basically at any time.
[27:59.620 --> 28:06.620]  Meanwhile, repossession of houses was up 55% last month alone.
[28:06.620 --> 28:09.620]  We just got those numbers on Monday.
[28:09.620 --> 28:11.620]  Bankruptcies are way up.
[28:11.620 --> 28:14.620]  These are the worst economic numbers we've seen in decades.
[28:14.620 --> 28:19.620]  And we haven't even begun to go down into the trough yet, according to all the experts.
[28:19.620 --> 28:20.620]  I mean, they're all agreeing on this.
[28:20.620 --> 28:29.620]  And then, meanwhile, the dollar that dropped to 60 plus percent, a couple pennies back and they're saying, oh, dollar strong again.
[28:29.620 --> 28:30.620]  Everything's fine.
[28:30.620 --> 28:35.620]  Well, all the fundamental show is going to go down even further as they print more currency, as they issue more liquidity,
[28:35.620 --> 28:39.620]  as they pay off more debts through the national debt.
[28:39.620 --> 28:42.620]  That is private banks are bailed out.
[28:42.620 --> 28:47.620]  Foreign companies are bailed out on the taxpayer dime.
[28:47.620 --> 28:52.620]  We're shouldered with that as they race to build more prisons, race to militarize police,
[28:52.620 --> 28:58.620]  race to roll out microwave guns and sound cannons and secret detainment facilities as they race to hire felons
[28:58.620 --> 29:03.620]  and set the precedent for private mercenary forces to engage in gun confiscation.
[29:03.620 --> 29:07.620]  As they announce the National Guard to the door to our gun confiscation in Illinois,
[29:07.620 --> 29:10.620]  as they do knock and talk gun confiscations coast to coast.
[29:10.620 --> 29:16.620]  Just there, there, heating up the police state as fast as they can, getting you ready.
[29:16.620 --> 29:19.620]  Because you're not going to like what they're going to do to you.
[29:19.620 --> 29:21.620]  Only politically exposing them.
[29:21.620 --> 29:24.620]  Only showing their agenda will stop them.
[29:24.620 --> 29:28.620]  If they're able to pose as the saviors, they've got their ear to the ground.
[29:28.620 --> 29:30.620]  If they think you're going to buy it, they're going to launch it.
[29:30.620 --> 29:34.620]  If the crooks think they can fool you, they're going to drop the hammer.
[29:34.620 --> 29:35.620]  Do you understand?
[29:35.620 --> 29:37.620]  That's why we've got to expose government-sponsored terror.
[29:37.620 --> 29:41.620]  Expose what they've done with the making system by design, another controlled system.
[29:41.620 --> 29:43.620]  If we don't, they're going to win.
[29:43.620 --> 29:46.620]  Ron Paul's coming up with a lot of other big guests.
[29:46.620 --> 30:15.620]  Stay with us.
[30:25.620 --> 30:28.620]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.

[31:04.620 --> 31:07.620]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[31:07.620 --> 31:10.620]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel,
[31:10.620 --> 31:13.620]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[31:13.620 --> 31:17.620]  Finalize the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston,
[31:17.620 --> 31:20.620]  online from my desk with WebEx.
[31:20.620 --> 31:23.620]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[31:23.620 --> 31:25.620]  I just talked to clients on the phone,
[31:25.620 --> 31:28.620]  and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop,
[31:28.620 --> 31:33.620]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[32:01.620 --> 32:04.620]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[32:04.620 --> 32:08.620]  Did you know that it doesn't matter which political party occupies the White House?
[32:08.620 --> 32:12.620]  They have both been captured by those who are working for world government
[32:12.620 --> 32:15.620]  and the destruction of our Constitution.
[32:15.620 --> 32:19.620]  They believe that governments formed in the 18th and 19th centuries
[32:19.620 --> 32:25.620]  based upon constitutional rights of the people are now obsolete and need to be changed.
[32:25.620 --> 32:29.620]  That change will be to communism, socialism, fascism,
[32:29.620 --> 32:33.620]  a form of government that takes away all our rights.
[32:33.620 --> 32:36.620]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening
[32:36.620 --> 32:42.620]  and offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[32:42.620 --> 32:50.620]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[32:50.620 --> 32:56.620]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[32:56.620 --> 33:01.620]  Call now while operators are standing by to receive your call.
[33:01.620 --> 33:07.620]  We up go to Alaska.
[33:07.620 --> 33:13.620]  No to Alaska, no north for us is home.
[33:13.620 --> 33:15.620]  No to Alaska.
[33:15.620 --> 33:18.620]  Carol Paul, the wife of Dr. Ron Paul.
[33:18.620 --> 33:20.620]  Big Sam, left Seattle.
[33:20.620 --> 33:23.620]  You know, had three emergency surgeries and was in critical condition.
[33:23.620 --> 33:25.620]  She's a little bit better now.
[33:25.620 --> 33:28.620]  He is at the hospital with her now.
[33:28.620 --> 33:30.620]  We even have the hospital room number. We can call it.
[33:30.620 --> 33:32.620]  But I'm not going to call.
[33:32.620 --> 33:34.620]  We've got Jesse Benton's back up.
[33:34.620 --> 33:37.620]  Ron Paul's supposed to be calling any time now.
[33:37.620 --> 33:41.620]  But he's got to get away to a place in the hospital to come on the show.
[33:41.620 --> 33:43.620]  We really appreciate that.
[33:43.620 --> 33:47.620]  And if he has to come on in the next hour, we'll push Paul Watson back
[33:47.620 --> 33:51.620]  because we've got to get Ron Paul's take on what's happening with the economy,
[33:51.620 --> 33:54.620]  what's happening in Georgia, what's happening with the Iran attack,
[33:54.620 --> 33:56.620]  the intel he's getting.
[33:56.620 --> 34:01.620]  We've got a great guy to come on this show, even when his wife has been
[34:01.620 --> 34:03.620]  fighting for her health to put it lightly.
[34:03.620 --> 34:06.620]  So Dr. Paul scheduled to be joining us right now.
[34:06.620 --> 34:08.620]  We'll see when he makes it.
[34:08.620 --> 34:11.620]  Paul Watson in 30 minutes. Jonathan Ellen off in a couple hours.
[34:11.620 --> 34:13.620]  Wayne Madsen with big breaking news.
[34:13.620 --> 34:21.620]  Professor Peterdale Scott, author Peterdale Scott as well today.
[34:21.620 --> 34:30.620]  I do want to encourage the listeners to pre-order Jason Burmese's new film.
[34:30.620 --> 34:34.620]  This is Jason going out on his own.
[34:34.620 --> 34:39.620]  This is his standalone film.
[34:39.620 --> 34:43.620]  And we helped him make it at his request.
[34:43.620 --> 34:45.620]  But I really like Jason.
[34:45.620 --> 34:47.620]  I have to say he's my favorite of the trio.
[34:47.620 --> 34:50.620]  I like the other guys too, but he really is a great guy.
[34:50.620 --> 34:52.620]  And his film is excellent.
[34:52.620 --> 34:56.620]  It turned out better than I thought it would be with his directorial debut.
[34:56.620 --> 34:59.620]  Fabled enemies. It's a very good documentary.
[34:59.620 --> 35:04.620]  Our past films covered how they blew the towers up and how they did the bombs
[35:04.620 --> 35:11.620]  and the NORAD drills and the stand down and the fact that they were caught lying
[35:11.620 --> 35:15.620]  or they had the motive and the history of government sponsored terror.
[35:15.620 --> 35:19.620]  That's what my films have covered and they've been very effective.
[35:19.620 --> 35:28.620]  But fabled enemies gets into the hard cold facts.
[35:28.620 --> 35:32.620]  How the hijackers in detail were trained at U.S. military bases.
[35:32.620 --> 35:37.620]  How they were really decoys hired by the U.S. government with Mr. Springman,
[35:37.620 --> 35:42.620]  the head of the embassy visa division going public about how he was ordered to let them in
[35:42.620 --> 35:46.620]  and basically told their CIA assets their terror designation as a cover.
[35:46.620 --> 35:50.620]  It's got Ray McGovern in it. It's got Cynthia McKinney.
[35:50.620 --> 35:53.620]  It's just an excellent film. Fabled enemies. We went and interviewed them.
[35:53.620 --> 36:02.620]  Also, it shows you Israel's involvement. It shows how Israel was shadowing the whole thing
[36:02.620 --> 36:07.620]  and deeply penetrating intelligence and how they got the codes.
[36:07.620 --> 36:14.620]  How only Israel could get the daily White House top ultra secret above top secret codes
[36:14.620 --> 36:26.620]  for the stand down in Washington and how they got the transponder code for Air Force One.
[36:26.620 --> 36:33.620]  Remember all that? Well, that supposedly happened because Al Qaeda penetrated the White House.
[36:33.620 --> 36:38.620]  Yeah, right. So, I mean, it just covers so much more.
[36:38.620 --> 36:45.620]  There's a lot of areas that aren't well known that is some of the most powerful information.
[36:45.620 --> 36:50.620]  Fabled enemies available at infowars.com. You can pre-order the DVD.
[36:50.620 --> 36:56.620]  Also, get big discounts on loose change final cut or truth rising when you get them together
[36:56.620 --> 37:00.620]  with fabled enemies now available at infowars.com.
[37:00.620 --> 37:04.620]  And the DVDs will ship out to you September 1st on that Monday.
[37:04.620 --> 37:10.620]  So, if you pre-order, you will get the video first mailed to you.
[37:10.620 --> 37:16.620]  And then, of course, you can also get a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[37:16.620 --> 37:20.620]  If you have a prisonplanet.tv membership, you get truth rising in super high quality,
[37:20.620 --> 37:26.620]  terror storm, terror storm final cut, in game, in game 1.5, an hour and a half of extras
[37:26.620 --> 37:29.620]  that aren't even on the official DVD.
[37:29.620 --> 37:38.620]  Weekly TV reports, the fourth hour we always stream live over the web.
[37:38.620 --> 37:44.620]  Truth rising, terror storm, in game.
[37:44.620 --> 37:47.620]  Fabled enemies, first in super high quality.
[37:47.620 --> 37:50.620]  I mean, it looks like DVD. It's not as good, but it's almost as good.
[37:50.620 --> 37:57.620]  At prisonplanet.tv, 15 cent a day membership and your support, your membership with prisonplanet.tv
[37:57.620 --> 37:59.620]  makes what we do here possible.
[37:59.620 --> 38:02.620]  Allows us to fund this very expensive operation.
[38:02.620 --> 38:04.620]  So, I want to thank all the members.
[38:04.620 --> 38:09.620]  It's also an armory in the information war.
[38:09.620 --> 38:11.620]  Thousands of videos we've posted.
[38:11.620 --> 38:15.620]  All 19 of my films and Bermas' new film, it'll be the 20th.
[38:15.620 --> 38:17.620]  We're producing it.
[38:17.620 --> 38:23.620]  The Sunday Show videotapes, special in-studio guest interviews, behind the scenes,
[38:23.620 --> 38:27.620]  expanded extras, prisonplanet.tv.
[38:27.620 --> 38:33.620]  Prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day, $5.95 for a monthly membership,
[38:33.620 --> 38:39.620]  or get a yearly membership and get three months free on the already low, low price.
[38:39.620 --> 38:43.620]  I've really been forgetting to plug the films and plug prisonplanet.tv,
[38:43.620 --> 38:47.620]  and that's such an effective part of our arsenal and what we do in the fight.
[38:47.620 --> 38:53.620]  With Truth Rising and now with Fable to Enemies, we have DivX versions,
[38:53.620 --> 39:01.620]  which most, I keep saying half, but most of the new DVD players have the DivX format.
[39:01.620 --> 39:04.620]  And so, that means you can put it on a normal CD.
[39:04.620 --> 39:07.620]  On a normal CD, you can put a whole bunch of films.
[39:07.620 --> 39:09.620]  It depends on their size, but scores of them.
[39:09.620 --> 39:15.620]  Well, you can just take cheap, regular disc and burn a DivX version that looks amazingly clear.
[39:15.620 --> 39:21.620]  I mean, we've been watching in here on big screen, 40-something inch TV that we have in our editing suite,
[39:21.620 --> 39:23.620]  so we can check the quality.
[39:23.620 --> 39:26.620]  We need a big screen TV, but I'll be able to blow it up to make sure stuff looks good on a big screen TV,
[39:26.620 --> 39:31.620]  because that's where they really test the resolution and the pixelation.
[39:31.620 --> 39:34.620]  And our DivX looks almost as good as regular DVD.
[39:34.620 --> 39:38.620]  I mean, not as good, but almost as good.
[39:38.620 --> 39:40.620]  Obviously, a lot of our footage is shot in high def,
[39:40.620 --> 39:43.620]  and then when you see it crunched to DivX and blown up on a high def,
[39:43.620 --> 39:46.620]  plasma screen TV, it doesn't look as good.
[39:46.620 --> 39:56.620]  But it's very watchable, very nice, and...
[39:56.620 --> 40:00.620]  Well, I'm done babbling about it.
[40:00.620 --> 40:09.620]  Bottom line, people need to get a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[40:09.620 --> 40:11.620]  I mean, it just gets better and better.
[40:11.620 --> 40:14.620]  I want to thank all the members that were members four years ago.
[40:14.620 --> 40:17.620]  We had one little server, and it would slow down at night when you were on it,
[40:17.620 --> 40:20.620]  and then we had two fancy servers and then four fancy servers,
[40:20.620 --> 40:25.620]  and then we graduated in the 21st century and got a CDN about a year ago.
[40:25.620 --> 40:28.620]  Now we have two CDNs, and so it's just rip-roaring.
[40:28.620 --> 40:31.620]  And so we just continue to invest in making it better and better,
[40:31.620 --> 40:34.620]  because it is a huge conduit in getting the truth out.
[40:34.620 --> 40:36.620]  And I've already said that.
[40:36.620 --> 40:39.620]  It's just any subject you want, any topic you want.
[40:39.620 --> 40:41.620]  You can burn it to death, give it to people,
[40:41.620 --> 40:43.620]  make a file, email it to somebody.
[40:43.620 --> 40:47.620]  It's just a labyrinth of information.
[40:47.620 --> 40:51.620]  One thing I want to do is hire another person to work on prisonplanet.tv
[40:51.620 --> 40:54.620]  to better categorize all the videos, better promote them.
[40:54.620 --> 40:56.620]  I mean, there's just so much there.
[40:56.620 --> 41:00.620]  And my book, 9-11, Descent into Terony, is about to go out of print.
[41:00.620 --> 41:06.620]  There's about 200 left of those, by the way.
[41:06.620 --> 41:08.620]  In fact, I need to tell my shopping cart guy,
[41:08.620 --> 41:11.620]  I need to go ahead and just jack the price up on those,
[41:11.620 --> 41:13.620]  because it's worth it and it raises capital for us.
[41:13.620 --> 41:17.620]  When the last hundred and sign them in number of them is the last hundred.
[41:17.620 --> 41:21.620]  It's kind of sad, and plus people deserve the value of the last hundred.
[41:21.620 --> 41:24.620]  People want that collector, so we'll do that.
[41:24.620 --> 41:27.620]  I know Tex Marsh just ordered 200.
[41:27.620 --> 41:29.620]  I think we're almost down.
[41:29.620 --> 41:36.620]  Actually, I better run in there and do an accounting of that before they're gone.
[41:36.620 --> 41:39.620]  Because when Descent into Terony's gone, it's gone.
[41:39.620 --> 41:41.620]  No more Alex Jones books.
[41:41.620 --> 41:47.620]  For about a year, Paul Watson's book has been out of print, ordered out of chaos.
[41:47.620 --> 41:56.620]  We printed 7,000 of those, and they're all gone.
[41:56.620 --> 42:00.620]  Took like four or five years to sell them, they're gone.
[42:00.620 --> 42:06.620]  And that is an e-book, Descent into Terony's an e-book on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[42:06.620 --> 42:11.620]  That's my whole point in getting off into that.
[42:11.620 --> 42:15.620]  John, I guess, Ron Paul obviously hasn't called, has he?
[42:15.620 --> 42:18.620]  Yeah, let's not call the hospital number even though we're authorized to.
[42:18.620 --> 42:24.620]  You know what, he's so professional, he wouldn't be calling unless Carol is having a bad time.
[42:24.620 --> 42:28.620]  I almost feel guilty even having him on, though they've been asking us to have him on,
[42:28.620 --> 42:30.620]  because they've got their big event coming up.
[42:30.620 --> 42:32.620]  No, this is a big show, I want to promote it.
[42:32.620 --> 42:37.620]  I almost don't even want to bug Jesse Benton about this,
[42:37.620 --> 42:41.620]  but I also want to get Ron Paul's take on Georgia.
[42:41.620 --> 42:43.620]  We haven't had him on in about three weeks.
[42:43.620 --> 42:46.620]  He was on right before all this started, about three or four days before it started.
[42:46.620 --> 42:49.620]  I guess he was on the Monday before it all started.
[42:49.620 --> 42:51.620]  And I really want to get his analysis on that,
[42:51.620 --> 42:54.620]  not just because I want his take on it and his analysis,
[42:54.620 --> 42:58.620]  but because then whatever he has to say on the show will get a lot of attention,
[42:58.620 --> 43:03.620]  and then people will, for some reason, I mean, Ron Paul will say something somewhere else that doesn't get a lot of attention.
[43:03.620 --> 43:07.620]  They know, the stuff he says here on this show, because it's so big,
[43:07.620 --> 43:10.620]  thank God we're in this position and the show is just exploding,
[43:10.620 --> 43:15.620]  that things are actually able to get out to a larger audience.
[43:15.620 --> 43:19.620]  And that's why we shouldn't take any of this for granted.
[43:19.620 --> 43:25.620]  Any of the time we have to warn people before the global stage of nuke attack or a bioweapons release,
[43:25.620 --> 43:29.620]  or before they pull the rug out and there's a complete depression,
[43:29.620 --> 43:33.620]  or before they start a war with Russia or Iran and people email me and say,
[43:33.620 --> 43:38.620]  oh, you're a fearmonger. How?
[43:38.620 --> 43:42.620]  Is it fearmongering when we know the government, the criminals that run it,
[43:42.620 --> 43:46.620]  for 50-plus years have been testing deadly biological weapons,
[43:46.620 --> 43:52.620]  radiological systems, chemical weapons on the American people and the troops and the police and the military.
[43:52.620 --> 43:56.620]  For some reason, they're most dutiful servants.
[43:56.620 --> 44:00.620]  They're most loyal, dog-like servants.
[44:00.620 --> 44:02.620]  That's actually a compliment.
[44:02.620 --> 44:06.620]  Or the ones they enjoy hurting the most. It's so sick.
[44:06.620 --> 44:10.620]  Well, the New World Order has a weird philosophy. They say, if you're dumb,
[44:10.620 --> 44:14.620]  and let us do it to you, you're fair game.
[44:14.620 --> 44:23.620]  I mean, how is it not scary that there are thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of separate programs?
[44:23.620 --> 44:27.620]  Some may have a dozen. Some may have 5,000 people, 1,000 involved.
[44:27.620 --> 44:30.620]  Some may have 110,000 involved.
[44:30.620 --> 44:35.620]  We've listed them. We've covered them. It's an in-game, all mainstream news admitting
[44:35.620 --> 44:40.620]  that they strap down children
[44:40.620 --> 44:46.620]  and stuck ice picks in their brain in front of classrooms thousands of times.
[44:46.620 --> 44:51.620]  Oh, you don't believe me. Just type lobotomy ice pick.
[44:51.620 --> 44:56.620]  You can watch black and white films from the 30s and 40s as a crying child going,
[44:56.620 --> 44:59.620]  look how they're insane. Look how they're rationally scared.
[44:59.620 --> 45:04.620]  They just jab the ice pick in to the front of lobe and laugh as the demonic psychiatrist
[45:04.620 --> 45:06.620]  students laugh and giggle and snicker.
[45:06.620 --> 45:10.620]  See, these are professions which they're allowed to carry out their black ops.
[45:10.620 --> 45:16.620]  It's psychopaths creating criminal guilds.
[45:16.620 --> 45:25.620]  Or just type in government footage of shock therapy.
[45:25.620 --> 45:32.620]  Or type in children radiated to death in atomic experiments.
[45:32.620 --> 45:37.620]  I mean, go look at it. Go look at the photos of a two-year-old in a chamber
[45:37.620 --> 45:40.620]  about to be radiated to death.
[45:40.620 --> 45:43.620]  What is that? Is that fair mongering? You bet.
[45:43.620 --> 45:48.620]  We better be concerned and scared of these people and fight them and stand up against them
[45:48.620 --> 45:52.620]  and just vomit on them basically and say, we vomit you out.
[45:52.620 --> 45:57.620]  We are not part of you and we don't trust you or anything you do or say
[45:57.620 --> 46:01.620]  because you've committed millions of crimes we know about.
[46:01.620 --> 46:05.620]  500 plus thousand women from the 20s until 1987,
[46:05.620 --> 46:09.620]  last state to publicly stop doing and it still goes on,
[46:09.620 --> 46:14.620]  was Oregon and they'd go grab teenage girls out of class that made bad grades
[46:14.620 --> 46:16.620]  and they'd take them and sterilize them.
[46:16.620 --> 46:19.620]  And then if they complained about it,
[46:19.620 --> 46:22.620]  they would just grab them and drug them for a few years.
[46:22.620 --> 46:25.620]  And where do you think psychopathic people that want to rape people go?
[46:25.620 --> 46:28.620]  They go get jobs at mental institutions because they think, oh, they're just crazy.
[46:28.620 --> 46:33.620]  Where do you think pedophiles go? They go to become CPS workers and truancy officers.
[46:33.620 --> 46:36.620]  That's in criminology. That's just a fact.
[46:36.620 --> 46:41.620]  Don't roll your eyes, police. You must not have taken any criminology.
[46:41.620 --> 46:45.620]  So this is the type of stuff we deal with.
[46:45.620 --> 46:48.620]  And the crimes go on and on and on.
[46:48.620 --> 46:53.620]  Just a little in the last few years, New York Daily News and a few others have reported
[46:53.620 --> 47:01.620]  that they take children and they test pesticides and drugs on them till they die.
[47:01.620 --> 47:06.620]  And we know about that because even the sicko CPS workers who were taking the children
[47:06.620 --> 47:09.620]  and then selling them to the state to private medical firms,
[47:09.620 --> 47:14.620]  even they freaked out when they saw them killing the children and went and said,
[47:14.620 --> 47:19.620]  is this authorized?
[47:19.620 --> 47:25.620]  I mean, does it concern you that our criminal government snuck attack Russia two weeks ago?
[47:25.620 --> 47:34.620]  Does it concern you that our criminal government is so evil that they actually have convinced
[47:34.620 --> 47:39.620]  the public through deception that Russia attacked Georgia premeditatedly?
[47:39.620 --> 47:51.620]  AP Today. It says NATO has withdrawn its ambassadors from Russia.
[47:51.620 --> 47:54.620]  That's a big deal to suspend diplomatic links.
[47:54.620 --> 47:58.620]  That always happens right before a war.
[47:58.620 --> 48:03.620]  In punitive steps to punish Moscow for its actions.
[48:03.620 --> 48:06.620]  See how everything is its actions, its actions.
[48:06.620 --> 48:13.620]  Oh, and people just hear that. Oh, Russia's being punished for its actions.
[48:13.620 --> 48:23.620]  Over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[48:23.620 --> 48:27.620]  I mean, I don't know what's bigger, the sneak attack on Russia or the media,
[48:27.620 --> 48:30.620]  the dominant media lying.
[48:30.620 --> 48:32.620]  I mean, does that make you sleep good at night?
[48:32.620 --> 48:39.620]  People who rationalize the neocon tune in and make jokes and talk about how they want to kill me on their websites all day.
[48:39.620 --> 48:45.620]  Or now the liberals calling me a fascist because I'm telling you Barack Obama's a complete warmongering fraud,
[48:45.620 --> 48:49.620]  just like John McCain. I mean, I won't buy into your delusions.
[48:49.620 --> 48:54.620]  Does it make you feel good knowing the corporate media lies that bad and twists and spins?
[48:54.620 --> 49:01.620]  I mean, our country's in a lot of trouble.
[49:01.620 --> 49:10.620]  When the lies are that blatant and then they're just getting worse and worse, more and more obvious.
[49:10.620 --> 49:14.620]  And you know why it's happening? Because the establishment is going for broke.
[49:14.620 --> 49:18.620]  They have thrown in all their force behind the New World Order.
[49:18.620 --> 49:21.620]  They know they're in trouble. That only encourages them.
[49:21.620 --> 49:30.620]  That's only the hell, the hellfires licking at them, lashing them as they pull this carriage over the cliff.
[49:30.620 --> 49:35.620]  That only makes the froth fly out of their horses mouths that much thicker.
[49:35.620 --> 49:42.620]  The veins bulge out on their chest and legs. Imagine them as four black horses drawing a carriage in it over the cliff.
[49:42.620 --> 49:52.620]  It only intensifies their lying and twisting and spinning and every form of disinformation and forgery and fraud.
[49:52.620 --> 50:01.620]  But as above so below, you look at the general public below, more fraud, more scams, more cheating, more laziness, more...
[50:01.620 --> 50:12.620]  And you've still got a lot of hard working, good decent people that keep this nation together and keep it moving forward to some degree.
[50:12.620 --> 50:17.620]  We are a nation in massive decline.
[50:17.620 --> 50:21.620]  We are a nation imploding on every front.
[50:21.620 --> 50:25.620]  And we have to admit how bad we are before we can set about fixing it.
[50:25.620 --> 50:32.620]  We have to admit we have a problem, like a drug addict, like an alcoholic.
[50:32.620 --> 50:38.620]  And we have to admit that what we're doing is wrong, but instead we're just lying to ourselves and we want the delusion.
[50:38.620 --> 50:45.620]  We want to be lied to. We don't want to admit what we've done wrong.
[50:45.620 --> 50:49.620]  And that's why we're in a lot of trouble.
[50:49.620 --> 50:53.620]  Alright, we're going to come back. Ron Paul should be popping in later.
[50:53.620 --> 51:01.620]  This happens quite often between Congress, his wife being sick, the campaign for liberty, but he's scheduled, so is Paul Watson.
[51:01.620 --> 51:07.620]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[51:07.620 --> 51:12.620]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[51:12.620 --> 51:17.620]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[51:17.620 --> 51:21.620]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[51:21.620 --> 51:29.620]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.

[51:35.620 --> 51:41.620]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[51:41.620 --> 51:47.620]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[53:00.620 --> 53:07.620]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[53:07.620 --> 53:11.620]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[53:11.620 --> 53:12.620]  Bin Laden.
[53:12.620 --> 53:13.620]  This is his MO.
[53:13.620 --> 53:16.620]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[53:16.620 --> 53:23.620]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[53:23.620 --> 53:30.620]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[53:30.620 --> 53:34.620]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[53:34.620 --> 53:41.620]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[53:41.620 --> 53:45.620]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[53:53.620 --> 53:57.620]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[53:57.620 --> 54:09.620]  The Preacher Man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold grime.
[54:09.620 --> 54:12.620]  Ron Paul is calling in in the next 10 minutes. He just called us.
[54:12.620 --> 54:20.620]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go down.
[54:20.620 --> 54:22.620]  I'm going to treat you to a minute or two, a junior.
[54:22.620 --> 54:32.620]  I live back in the woods, you see, a woman and the kids and the dogs and me.
[54:32.620 --> 54:42.620]  I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive and a country boy can survive.
[54:42.620 --> 54:54.620]  Country folks can survive. I can fly a field all day long.
[54:54.620 --> 55:05.620]  I can catch catfish from dust till dawn. We'll make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[55:05.620 --> 55:13.620]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[55:13.620 --> 55:20.620]  We're both good old maters and homemade wine and a country boy can survive.
[55:20.620 --> 55:24.620]  Country folks can survive.
[55:24.620 --> 55:27.620]  Because you can't starve us out.
[55:27.620 --> 55:31.620]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[55:31.620 --> 55:35.620]  Those wisdom old boys raised old shotguns.
[55:35.620 --> 55:37.620]  We say grace.
[55:37.620 --> 55:39.620]  We say grace.
[55:39.620 --> 55:41.620]  We say amen.
[55:41.620 --> 55:46.620]  Ain't in the black we don't give a damn.
[55:46.620 --> 55:54.620]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines and the Rocky Mountains and the Western skies.
[55:54.620 --> 55:57.620]  We can skin a buck.
[55:57.620 --> 56:01.620]  We can run a trot line and a country boy can survive.
[56:01.620 --> 56:03.620]  And the establishment doesn't like that.
[56:03.620 --> 56:05.620]  Country folks can survive.
[56:05.620 --> 56:10.620]  They want you yielded, neutered in the city.
[56:10.620 --> 56:14.620]  I had a good friend in New York City.
[56:14.620 --> 56:17.620]  He never called me by my name, just healed billing.
[56:17.620 --> 56:21.620]  You want to beat the New World Order? Make the countryside survive.
[56:21.620 --> 56:25.620]  My grandpa taught me how to live off the land.
[56:25.620 --> 56:29.620]  Why do you think they're banning all forms of hunting in England?
[56:29.620 --> 56:32.620]  To destroy that culture.
[56:32.620 --> 56:35.620]  They hate.
[56:35.620 --> 56:39.620]  Anyone who's self-sufficient.
[56:39.620 --> 56:44.620]  Why didn't the British government in 97 launch the foot and mouth bio attack?
[56:44.620 --> 56:46.620]  Oh, they were caught.
[56:46.620 --> 56:51.620]  I'm with a switchblade knife for $43.
[56:51.620 --> 56:57.620]  I don't want you being able to stand up and be independent.
[56:57.620 --> 57:02.620]  They want you in the city where they can suck off you.
[57:02.620 --> 57:08.620]  Now they've got the animal ID and the premise society to shut down the farms.
[57:08.620 --> 57:13.620]  We've got to stand up against them and let them win.
[57:13.620 --> 57:16.620]  Cause you can't stop them out and you can't make them run.
[57:16.620 --> 57:19.620]  Cause with them old boys raise old shotguns.
[57:19.620 --> 57:21.620]  You can't make us run and you don't like that, do you?
[57:21.620 --> 57:24.620]  We say grace, we say man.
[57:24.620 --> 57:30.620]  And you ain't into that, but don't give a damn.
[57:30.620 --> 57:34.620]  We're from North California and South Alabama.
[57:34.620 --> 57:42.620]  And little towns all around this land.
[57:42.620 --> 57:48.620]  We can scan a book and run a trot line and a country boy can survive.
[57:48.620 --> 57:51.620]  Country folks can survive.
[57:51.620 --> 57:54.620]  Country boys can survive.
[57:54.620 --> 58:05.620]  Country folks can survive.
[58:05.620 --> 58:07.620]  Now I never played the whole thing.
[58:07.620 --> 58:13.620]  This here, Hillbilly, stump jumping tobacco chewing, what's that thing Willie always says?
[58:13.620 --> 58:14.620]  I just love it once I start playing.
[58:14.620 --> 58:16.620]  I mean, we need to queue up later.
[58:16.620 --> 58:22.620]  The old East bounding down, that little smokey and the bandit for you.
[58:22.620 --> 58:23.620]  Yeah, we're not going to stop.
[58:23.620 --> 58:27.620]  We're not going to back down from anybody.
[58:27.620 --> 58:28.620]  You pick a fight with the American people.
[58:28.620 --> 58:30.620]  You pick a fight with me.
[58:30.620 --> 58:33.620]  You're going to get one right back.
[58:33.620 --> 58:37.620]  So don't sit there and whine while you get your butt kicked.
[58:37.620 --> 58:42.620]  Just realize you're a punk.
[58:42.620 --> 58:45.620]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:45.620 --> 58:51.620]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.620 --> 58:53.620]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[58:53.620 --> 58:56.620]  I've come with a message of information.
[58:56.620 --> 58:58.620]  9-11 was an inside job.
[58:58.620 --> 58:59.620]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[58:59.620 --> 59:01.620]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[59:01.620 --> 59:04.620]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[59:04.620 --> 59:05.620]  Was it engineered by you?
[59:05.620 --> 59:08.620]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.R.?
[59:08.620 --> 59:10.620]  He said I had to shut up.
[59:10.620 --> 59:17.620]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[59:17.620 --> 59:23.620]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[59:23.620 --> 59:25.620]  An inside job?
[59:25.620 --> 59:27.620]  How dare you?
[59:27.620 --> 59:30.620]  I don't think what the comments are suggesting is that you're a 9-11.
[59:30.620 --> 59:34.620]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:34.620 --> 59:37.620]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:37.620 --> 59:42.620]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[59:42.620 --> 59:43.620]  Please rise.
[59:43.620 --> 59:46.620]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[59:46.620 --> 59:48.620]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:48.620 --> 1:00:00.620]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:00:18.620 --> 1:00:38.620]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:38.620 --> 1:00:49.620]  Now into hour number two, Jonathan Elanoff is going to be joining us in one hour to talk about the latest police state developments in Denver ahead of this giant police state promotion that is the DNC.
[1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:54.620]  Then Wayne Madsen, 30 minutes after that, dealing with threats to bloggers.
[1:00:54.620 --> 1:00:57.620]  The NSA reportedly talking about killing bloggers.
[1:00:57.620 --> 1:00:59.620]  Why don't we just, quote, kill them?
[1:00:59.620 --> 1:01:00.620]  That's what they do in Iraq.
[1:01:00.620 --> 1:01:02.620]  We just kill alternative newspaper people.
[1:01:02.620 --> 1:01:08.620]  And Peter Del Scott in the fourth hour, Ron Paul, scheduled to be calling in the next five minutes.
[1:01:08.620 --> 1:01:12.620]  And also Paul Watson at the bottom of this hour, 4.30 as well.
[1:01:12.620 --> 1:01:13.620]  Got Steve coming on.
[1:01:13.620 --> 1:01:18.620]  I like to, later in the week, I like to have them pop in and visit with us.
[1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:27.620]  Really the big news is on the military front is that NATO has suspended formal contacts with Russia, kicking their Russian ambassador to NATO out.
[1:01:27.620 --> 1:01:31.620]  That is always a foreshadowing of intensifying physical conflict.
[1:01:31.620 --> 1:01:34.620]  They've always been in the past, a very serious movement.
[1:01:34.620 --> 1:01:38.620]  They say because of Russia's unwarranted sneak attack on Georgia.
[1:01:38.620 --> 1:01:39.620]  That's why they're doing that.
[1:01:39.620 --> 1:01:44.620]  I am knowing that the public think that Georgia USA was attacked.
[1:01:44.620 --> 1:01:48.620]  Meryl Wachovia in danger of failing.
[1:01:48.620 --> 1:01:52.620]  Top strategist says huge news there.
[1:01:52.620 --> 1:01:59.620]  Also, MSNBC reporting a police state is being set up.
[1:01:59.620 --> 1:02:05.620]  Also, New York City settles with anti-war protesters for $2 million.
[1:02:05.620 --> 1:02:08.620]  They would not allow anyone in the city to have anti-war signs anywhere.
[1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:10.620]  The city would not, quote, issue permits.
[1:02:10.620 --> 1:02:14.620]  See, first they say, oh, you got to have a permit to protest and be on the sidewalk.
[1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:19.620]  The permits were just first for parades blocking streets, which sounds reasonable in big cities.
[1:02:19.620 --> 1:02:22.620]  But then it's, well, you got to have a permit period and we're not issuing them.
[1:02:22.620 --> 1:02:25.620]  And then they arrested thousands and beat them and everything else.
[1:02:25.620 --> 1:02:27.620]  And they've lost a whole bunch of lawsuits there.
[1:02:27.620 --> 1:02:29.620]  They just lost another $2 million lawsuit.
[1:02:29.620 --> 1:02:37.620]  But don't worry, they'll just squeeze it out of slaves on the streets of New York.
[1:02:37.620 --> 1:02:42.620]  Continuing with just amazing report here in front of me.
[1:02:42.620 --> 1:02:46.620]  The FBI admits it has no case against Dr. Ivins.
[1:02:46.620 --> 1:02:49.620]  The FBI admitted it has no case against Ivins.
[1:02:49.620 --> 1:02:51.620]  It summarized in an article in the Washington Post.
[1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:56.620]  And they also accidentally destroyed the only samples and anthrax from the government lab.
[1:02:56.620 --> 1:03:01.620]  But they had to do that because then they couldn't have proof and link it up to the anthrax
[1:03:01.620 --> 1:03:03.620]  that was sent out that was weaponized in the U.S. government.
[1:03:03.620 --> 1:03:06.620]  So they had to claim someone else and made this in their basement.
[1:03:06.620 --> 1:03:08.620]  I mean, just incredible lying.
[1:03:08.620 --> 1:03:14.620]  And even my mother-in-law, who's a smart but somewhat establishment, believes in the system,
[1:03:14.620 --> 1:03:19.620]  calls up yesterday going, oh, my God, the government's covering up what really happened with the anthrax.
[1:03:19.620 --> 1:03:20.620]  What do you think?
[1:03:20.620 --> 1:03:21.620]  You think they did it, basically.
[1:03:21.620 --> 1:03:23.620]  I mean, everybody's waking up.
[1:03:23.620 --> 1:03:25.620]  I mean, this is getting too obvious.
[1:03:25.620 --> 1:03:28.620]  Then they said he's always been the only suspect.
[1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:34.620]  They knew he did it four years ago, but they were busy just six months ago, still persecuting Dr. Stephen Hatfield.
[1:03:34.620 --> 1:03:37.620]  See, there's some people still have a memory.
[1:03:37.620 --> 1:03:44.620]  Some people still pay attention and are going, wait, the lives are just getting so thick here.
[1:03:44.620 --> 1:03:52.620]  Meanwhile, the government weapons expert who broke in after he'd been fired a fortnight into the area with the anthrax,
[1:03:52.620 --> 1:04:00.620]  he's working in another bio weapons lab in New Mexico, and no one is even talking about him, Dr. Phillip Sack.
[1:04:00.620 --> 1:04:03.620]  But we are, and it is covered.
[1:04:03.620 --> 1:04:04.620]  Oh, I forgot.
[1:04:04.620 --> 1:04:05.620]  How timely.
[1:04:05.620 --> 1:04:06.620]  Fabled enemies.
[1:04:06.620 --> 1:04:11.620]  Jason Bermas' new film that comes out in just 10 days.
[1:04:11.620 --> 1:04:18.620]  We're going to release it a little early on the 31st, but officially it'll be out September 1st at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:04:18.620 --> 1:04:27.620]  There is a whole, I'd say, 15 minute segment in the two hour film on the anthrax, and guess who one of the presenters in the film is?
[1:04:27.620 --> 1:04:31.620]  One of the experts interviewed on the Israeli connection, also the anthrax and the rest of it.
[1:04:31.620 --> 1:04:35.620]  That is good old Mike Rivera of whatreallyhappen.com.
[1:04:35.620 --> 1:04:43.620]  So I had forgotten to let you know that we also in the new film cover the anthrax attack and who really launched that.
[1:04:43.620 --> 1:04:50.620]  We'll be right back with Congressman Ron Paul, who just called in from the hospital with his beloved Carol,
[1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:52.620]  and we really appreciate him taking the time out to do that.
[1:04:52.620 --> 1:04:55.620]  We'll be back in three minutes with the Congressman.
[1:05:01.620 --> 1:05:08.620]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:05:08.620 --> 1:05:10.620]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:05:10.620 --> 1:05:12.620]  But who is the enemy?
[1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:13.620]  Bin Laden.
[1:05:13.620 --> 1:05:14.620]  This is his MO.
[1:05:14.620 --> 1:05:17.620]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:05:17.620 --> 1:05:24.620]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:05:24.620 --> 1:05:31.620]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:05:31.620 --> 1:05:35.620]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:05:35.620 --> 1:05:40.620]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:05:40.620 --> 1:05:45.620]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:05:45.620 --> 1:05:46.620]  Fabled Enemies.
[1:05:46.620 --> 1:05:54.620]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:05:54.620 --> 1:05:58.620]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:06:01.620 --> 1:06:04.620]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[1:06:04.620 --> 1:06:09.620]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[1:06:09.620 --> 1:06:13.620]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients.
[1:06:13.620 --> 1:06:15.620]  Most of which are synthetic.
[1:06:15.620 --> 1:06:16.620]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:26.620]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[1:06:26.620 --> 1:06:28.620]  Now compare a cow bin pure soap.
[1:06:28.620 --> 1:06:32.620]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:11.620]  But there is still one place to find everything from gas masks to ammo cans and find it cheap.

[1:08:00.620 --> 1:08:08.620]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:08:08.620 --> 1:08:26.620]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. We have Congressman Ron Paul with us. We'll be posting this interview in full at infowars.cominprisonplanet.com.
[1:08:26.620 --> 1:08:31.620]  He joins us to give us an update on his wife, Carol, wonderful person we're all praying for,
[1:08:31.620 --> 1:08:38.620]  then the Russia-Georgia situation, the economy, and the upcoming police state situation with the microwave guns,
[1:08:38.620 --> 1:08:40.620]  the secret FEMA camp now exposed.
[1:08:40.620 --> 1:08:48.620]  In Denver, we've got him for one segment because he's obviously got to be there at the hospital in South Texas with his wife, Carol.
[1:08:48.620 --> 1:08:55.620]  Congressman, thank you for breaking your silence after the last week of your wife being so ill here on this radio show.
[1:08:55.620 --> 1:08:56.620]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:08:56.620 --> 1:09:01.620]  Well, it's good to be back with you, and I feel a lot better even though we had some tough days.
[1:09:01.620 --> 1:09:09.620]  She was on a breathing machine for 12 days, and she got off the machine yesterday, and they got her out of bed yesterday,
[1:09:09.620 --> 1:09:12.620]  so I'm feeling a lot better, and I appreciate everybody's concerns.
[1:09:12.620 --> 1:09:19.620]  Well, you're a medical doctor, but for those that don't know, getting someone off a respirator and getting them up, this is huge news.
[1:09:19.620 --> 1:09:26.620]  Yeah, it is, it's really a big, big step, and you can imagine what's like to lie flat on your back for 12 days.
[1:09:26.620 --> 1:09:31.620]  One thing she said was, wow, I'm weak, but she's doing well.
[1:09:31.620 --> 1:09:33.620]  Well, I've talked to people that have been on respirators.
[1:09:33.620 --> 1:09:36.620]  It's also very painful to have it pushing your lungs full of it.
[1:09:36.620 --> 1:09:37.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:09:37.620 --> 1:09:38.620]  Wow, she's a true borrower.
[1:09:38.620 --> 1:09:42.620]  I'm sure the prayers had a great effect, and folks keep those prayers up.
[1:09:42.620 --> 1:09:50.620]  Now, to kill any rumors, you are currently going to be at the Big Rally for the Republic with Jesse Ventura and all these huge musical guests.
[1:09:50.620 --> 1:09:53.620]  You're going to be there barring some turn for the worse.
[1:09:53.620 --> 1:09:56.620]  That is right, and things are looking better there for a couple days.
[1:09:56.620 --> 1:10:01.620]  I didn't know what I could do or would do if you were like that, but she isn't.
[1:10:01.620 --> 1:10:05.620]  She's getting better, and she'd want me to be there, so I have all the plans.
[1:10:05.620 --> 1:10:11.620]  I've been talking to staff more now about the details of the schedule, and it's all coming together.
[1:10:11.620 --> 1:10:15.620]  You know, throughout the campaign, I was worried about the rally.
[1:10:15.620 --> 1:10:21.620]  Some days we only had three days to put things together, and yet the people always showed up.
[1:10:21.620 --> 1:10:24.620]  So I'm optimistic that the people are going to show up.
[1:10:24.620 --> 1:10:32.620]  You want to see your crowd, and you want to fill it, because if it's slightly less full than it could be, then me to say,
[1:10:32.620 --> 1:10:33.620]  I didn't show up.
[1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:35.620]  Well, I mean, you don't have that sort of thing.
[1:10:35.620 --> 1:10:36.620]  There's 14,000 tickets.
[1:10:36.620 --> 1:10:38.620]  I mean, you don't have many more to sell here, do you?
[1:10:38.620 --> 1:10:42.620]  No, a couple thousand, and we're going to probably get...
[1:10:42.620 --> 1:10:50.620]  The students come back into town that day, I think, September 1st, and that's where we get a lot of support.
[1:10:50.620 --> 1:10:52.620]  You know how many young people have joined us.
[1:10:52.620 --> 1:10:58.620]  I think the young people, when they come back to town and realize that there are still some standing room positions,
[1:10:58.620 --> 1:10:59.620]  they're going to come.
[1:10:59.620 --> 1:11:03.620]  Well, there's no doubt that it's going to oversell.
[1:11:03.620 --> 1:11:07.620]  I mean, it's going to be a barn burner, and people always wait the last minute.
[1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:13.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, a week and a half out, they've only got about 20% or 15% of the tickets left.
[1:11:13.620 --> 1:11:16.620]  You're not going to get them if you don't buy them very, very soon.
[1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:20.620]  And before the Congressman leaves us, we'll tell you where to get those tickets.
[1:11:20.620 --> 1:11:22.620]  Now, let's get into the really big issues here.
[1:11:22.620 --> 1:11:29.620]  You have been talking about how the West has been encircling Russia, moving weapons systems in, the neocons,
[1:11:29.620 --> 1:11:33.620]  Israel NATO, moving advisors in, clearly ordering the sneak attack.
[1:11:33.620 --> 1:11:34.620]  That's now come out.
[1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:37.620]  The media spinning it, saying that Russia attacked.
[1:11:37.620 --> 1:11:40.620]  I mean, total contempt for the public and the facts.
[1:11:40.620 --> 1:11:45.620]  Can you give us your geopolitical analysis, Congressman, on what we're looking at here with Georgia,
[1:11:45.620 --> 1:11:51.620]  and now the Russian ambassadors kicked out of NATO this morning, according to the Associated Press?
[1:11:51.620 --> 1:11:56.620]  Well, you know, I think this is a good example of why we argue the case for non-intervention.
[1:11:56.620 --> 1:12:00.620]  We are in places where we shouldn't be and it just leads to a lot of problems.
[1:12:00.620 --> 1:12:08.620]  But also, it shows you how the two parties are just thinking exactly like both McCain and Obama,
[1:12:08.620 --> 1:12:14.620]  says the same thing, send them more money, send them more support, send them troops if necessary,
[1:12:14.620 --> 1:12:16.620]  and being very aggressive.
[1:12:16.620 --> 1:12:21.620]  And that, to me, is just so typical of the problems that we face.
[1:12:21.620 --> 1:12:29.620]  And you were right in your opening statement there that it was the Georgians that started the military attack.
[1:12:29.620 --> 1:12:34.620]  And yet, when you think about what's happened in the last week or so from the media,
[1:12:34.620 --> 1:12:41.620]  how many reports that we heard even suggest that maybe there was a balanced position on this.
[1:12:41.620 --> 1:12:47.620]  It was 100% essentially said, you know, it was all the Russians' fault.
[1:12:47.620 --> 1:12:53.620]  And all they should start thinking about is, how would we react if the Russians were in Mexico
[1:12:53.620 --> 1:12:58.620]  stirring up trouble on the borders and claiming New Mexico for as part of Mexico?
[1:12:58.620 --> 1:13:00.620]  You know, something like that.
[1:13:00.620 --> 1:13:06.620]  We'd be livid and, period, yet we are up butting against the boundaries all around the Soviets.
[1:13:06.620 --> 1:13:10.620]  We're taking that oil from the Caspian Sea and running it through Georgia,
[1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:12.620]  and we have a puppet government there.
[1:13:12.620 --> 1:13:17.620]  And these are the unintended consequences maybe intended by some people who knows.
[1:13:17.620 --> 1:13:25.620]  But it's about oil and it's about our empire and it's about the establishment running roughshaw over the American people.
[1:13:25.620 --> 1:13:29.620]  What do you think the New World Order crowd, because it's not just the neocons,
[1:13:29.620 --> 1:13:35.620]  NATO's behind it, Israel, their foreign minister and their defense minister are not even Georgians
[1:13:35.620 --> 1:13:37.620]  and are Israel bragged in herats.
[1:13:37.620 --> 1:13:41.620]  They had 1,000 troops involved, 1,000 Israeli mercenaries.
[1:13:41.620 --> 1:13:47.620]  I mean, what were they thinking to gain from launching a dead of night sneak attack on South Ossetia
[1:13:47.620 --> 1:13:51.620]  and even having, this is confirmed, Georgian peacekeepers and with the Russian peacekeepers
[1:13:51.620 --> 1:13:55.620]  actually stabbing them in special forces maneuvers in the back?
[1:13:55.620 --> 1:13:59.620]  Well, obviously they condoned it and encouraged it.
[1:13:59.620 --> 1:14:03.620]  And why, you know, because it doesn't work out so well even from their viewpoint,
[1:14:03.620 --> 1:14:05.620]  you wonder why they do it.
[1:14:05.620 --> 1:14:08.620]  I mean, I guess they deceived themselves.
[1:14:08.620 --> 1:14:12.620]  I mean, look at the mess they, they probably actually believe that they could conquer Iraq
[1:14:12.620 --> 1:14:16.620]  and solidify power there, permanently control the oil,
[1:14:16.620 --> 1:14:18.620]  but it didn't work out exactly that way.
[1:14:18.620 --> 1:14:22.620]  And I'm sure they are just distorted thinking,
[1:14:22.620 --> 1:14:27.620]  but now we, the people, will have to suffer the consequences.
[1:14:27.620 --> 1:14:29.620]  I mean, when Obama comes up and says,
[1:14:29.620 --> 1:14:31.620]  well, what we need to do is immediately send him a billion dollars.
[1:14:31.620 --> 1:14:32.620]  I'm all for that.
[1:14:32.620 --> 1:14:35.620]  Does he ever say, where are we going to get the billion dollars?
[1:14:35.620 --> 1:14:37.620]  How are we going to squeeze it out of the American people?
[1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:40.620]  How are we going to take it out of the pockets of the American people?
[1:14:40.620 --> 1:14:43.620]  And they're all in big trouble.
[1:14:43.620 --> 1:14:44.620]  Well, we'll print them out.
[1:14:44.620 --> 1:14:45.620]  We'll print them out.
[1:14:45.620 --> 1:14:48.620]  Then your, all your bills are going to go up because the dollar is going to go down.
[1:14:48.620 --> 1:14:50.620]  They, they never talk about that.
[1:14:50.620 --> 1:14:53.620]  And that's why our revolution is going on now.
[1:14:53.620 --> 1:15:00.620]  It just has to be successful because I think is a growing number of us who are just sick and tired of what we're getting.
[1:15:00.620 --> 1:15:01.620]  Absolutely.
[1:15:01.620 --> 1:15:03.620]  What would you do as president?
[1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:04.620]  I mean, you're not no longer running now,
[1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:09.620]  but what would you advise if they would listen to you and obviously our listeners can then go out on the campaign trail
[1:15:09.620 --> 1:15:13.620]  and call the media and then this can be put in an article and then we can push it to the public.
[1:15:13.620 --> 1:15:16.620]  What would you do in a relationship with Russia?
[1:15:16.620 --> 1:15:23.620]  What would you do in hindsight, but now currently since this new, the new Cold Wars men started?
[1:15:23.620 --> 1:15:28.620]  Well, we should talk to the Russians and we should deal with them and be friends with them and trade with them
[1:15:28.620 --> 1:15:33.620]  and tell them that we have no intention of intimidating you.
[1:15:33.620 --> 1:15:39.620]  We don't want to put missiles right up at your border claiming that we're going to protect Europe against the Iranians.
[1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:41.620]  The Iranians don't have missiles.
[1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:42.620]  They have no nuclear weapons.
[1:15:42.620 --> 1:15:45.620]  They can't even make gasoline for themselves.
[1:15:45.620 --> 1:15:48.620]  So it's just a farce for us to say that we're there.
[1:15:48.620 --> 1:15:52.620]  And I tell the Soviets or the Russians that we have no intention.
[1:15:52.620 --> 1:15:56.620]  We're going to take those missiles out and we're getting out of NATO.
[1:15:56.620 --> 1:15:57.620]  We don't even care about NATO.
[1:15:57.620 --> 1:16:03.620]  Instead of expanding NATO and trying to get Europe to intimidate you and surround you,
[1:16:03.620 --> 1:16:08.620]  I would say that we ought to just back off if we don't get out of NATO the first week to say,
[1:16:08.620 --> 1:16:14.620]  look, we're not going to keep pressing to get all Eastern Europe to belong to NATO.
[1:16:14.620 --> 1:16:21.620]  Fortunately, the other European nations didn't accept the membership of Georgia or our problems would be much worse.
[1:16:21.620 --> 1:16:22.620]  All right.
[1:16:22.620 --> 1:16:26.620]  A few final questions moving quickly here.
[1:16:26.620 --> 1:16:32.620]  The economy, they're talking about MSNBC, CNBC top analyst about Merrill Lynch collapsing,
[1:16:32.620 --> 1:16:38.620]  Wachovia collapsing, they're saying now, after telling us six months ago that the worst was over,
[1:16:38.620 --> 1:16:40.620]  that the worst is to come.
[1:16:40.620 --> 1:16:43.620]  We have a respite and dollar plunging, but it's still low.
[1:16:43.620 --> 1:16:45.620]  Where do you see all this going?
[1:16:45.620 --> 1:16:46.620]  I think we have a long way to go.
[1:16:46.620 --> 1:16:49.620]  They can prop things up and they can sort of fool the markets.
[1:16:49.620 --> 1:16:54.620]  And, you know, the plunge protection team can get in there and buy and sell and manipulate markets.
[1:16:54.620 --> 1:16:56.620]  But ultimately, the market is all powerful.
[1:16:56.620 --> 1:17:02.620]  I would say that at the very, very most, we've only had 25% of the correction that is necessary.
[1:17:02.620 --> 1:17:04.620]  So I think we have a long way to go.
[1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:10.620]  And as long as government does everything to prop up bad investments, it makes it that much longer.
[1:17:10.620 --> 1:17:14.620]  And the longer they allow weight for these directions to make, the worse they are.
[1:17:14.620 --> 1:17:16.620]  And I think this is what we're witnessing right now.
[1:17:16.620 --> 1:17:23.620]  Instead of a small number of companies and banks going bankrupt now, they're going to prolong this.
[1:17:23.620 --> 1:17:26.620]  And it's going to be very, very painful.
[1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:30.620]  I think this could last a decade or longer before all this correction.
[1:17:30.620 --> 1:17:32.620]  Japan took a long time.
[1:17:32.620 --> 1:17:34.620]  Their market collapsed in, I think, was 1989.
[1:17:34.620 --> 1:17:40.620]  And they still essentially haven't recovered the financial benefits of their markets yet.
[1:17:40.620 --> 1:17:43.620]  So this is going to worsen the long term?
[1:17:43.620 --> 1:17:44.620]  Pardon me?
[1:17:44.620 --> 1:17:46.620]  You think this will worsen the long term?
[1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:47.620]  Oh, yeah.
[1:17:47.620 --> 1:17:49.620]  I think it's going to get much worse.
[1:17:49.620 --> 1:17:56.620]  Even though on this short term, they may be able to prop up and fool some people, but I think what they're doing is just prolonging the agony.
[1:17:56.620 --> 1:18:00.620]  To me, it's sort of, and I use the analogy of a drug addict.
[1:18:00.620 --> 1:18:04.620]  You know, they just keep, and given the drug addict another fix.
[1:18:04.620 --> 1:18:07.620]  It feels better, but eventually the patient dies if you do that.
[1:18:07.620 --> 1:18:10.620]  Do you think we're going to kill the dollar?
[1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:12.620]  Is this being propped up for the election?
[1:18:12.620 --> 1:18:15.620]  Oh, I think they always do that.
[1:18:15.620 --> 1:18:28.620]  And also, I think maybe this Georgia incident could be part of the goal of the most radical neocons claim that McCain benefits from this.
[1:18:28.620 --> 1:18:30.620]  Congressman, we only have a minute and a half left.
[1:18:30.620 --> 1:18:36.620]  Folks need to go to rally for the republic.com or to the other Ron Paul websites, link through and get tickets.
[1:18:36.620 --> 1:18:39.620]  Keith Overman admits we're now going into a police state.
[1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:45.620]  The Justice Department is now announcing they want to turn local police totally into federal spies spying on Americans.
[1:18:45.620 --> 1:18:51.620]  They've now discovered a secret camp for 5,000 people in Denver with local police running a secret camp.
[1:18:51.620 --> 1:18:53.620]  And now MSNBC says we're going into a police state.
[1:18:53.620 --> 1:18:56.620]  Everything you've been warning us about, what should we do on that front?
[1:18:56.620 --> 1:18:58.620]  Well, we have to confront them.
[1:18:58.620 --> 1:19:07.620]  And this is difficult because if you confront right now with all your rights guaranteed by the Constitution, you're liable to end up in prison.
[1:19:07.620 --> 1:19:17.620]  You know, if you protest a tax code, which in the way they collect taxes unconstitutional, and they have all the guns, they put you in prison, same way with the monetary system.
[1:19:17.620 --> 1:19:20.620]  So I have resorted to doing what I do.
[1:19:20.620 --> 1:19:27.620]  I mean, I've been fighting for the enforcement of our Constitution through the legislative process, and hopefully we can have a change.
[1:19:27.620 --> 1:19:40.620]  That's why I'm working so hard with the campaign for liberty and putting this organization throughout the country so that we can galvanize and energize an army of people to bring about changes peacefully.
[1:19:40.620 --> 1:19:47.620]  But if it doesn't happen, just because of what they're doing, I'm afraid it could lead to violence.
[1:19:47.620 --> 1:19:51.620]  Should we physically stand up instead of go into a total Nazi Germany if that happens?
[1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:58.620]  Well, no, I think eventually we will, and I probably will be talking about this at the convention, is when...
[1:19:58.620 --> 1:20:01.620]  Hold on Congress, hold on, hold on.
[1:20:01.620 --> 1:20:03.620]  Our love republic is on her knees.
[1:20:03.620 --> 1:20:09.620]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[1:20:09.620 --> 1:20:12.620]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:20:12.620 --> 1:20:18.620]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:20:18.620 --> 1:20:22.620]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:20:22.620 --> 1:20:27.620]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[1:20:27.620 --> 1:20:30.620]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[1:21:01.620 --> 1:21:05.620]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:21:05.620 --> 1:21:10.620]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:10.620 --> 1:21:16.620]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the US.
[1:21:16.620 --> 1:21:23.620]  Though the people of the US where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility for reining them in and bringing them to justice,
[1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:27.620]  all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:21:27.620 --> 1:21:31.620]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:21:31.620 --> 1:21:34.620]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:34.620 --> 1:21:37.620]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:21:37.620 --> 1:21:42.620]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established,
[1:21:42.620 --> 1:21:46.620]  the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[1:21:46.620 --> 1:21:50.620]  we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:23:00.620 --> 1:23:03.620]  Gold. It's like nothing else on earth.
[1:23:03.620 --> 1:23:07.620]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the industrial age to the space age,
[1:23:07.620 --> 1:23:09.620]  gold has weathered the test of time.
[1:23:09.620 --> 1:23:13.620]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[1:23:13.620 --> 1:23:18.620]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:26.620]  The age is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:10.620]  Ron Paul's campaign manager died of pneumonia working himself to death and his wife has had a pacemaker put in and now fought for her life.
[1:24:10.620 --> 1:24:14.620]  No doubt the campaign trail is grueling. He sacrificed so much for us.
[1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:17.620]  Finishing up in one minute because you've got to go back to your wife.
[1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:24.620]  Finishing up with the idea of if they ignore the Constitution, Bell of Rights, our votes, the states, what do we then do?
[1:24:24.620 --> 1:24:26.620]  Do we stand up physically?
[1:24:26.620 --> 1:24:32.620]  Well, there's always that possibility that that time will come. I am working hard to try to avoid that.
[1:24:32.620 --> 1:24:39.620]  But I do believe that in the near future, many of us will have to make a decision whether we'll practice civil disobedience.
[1:24:39.620 --> 1:24:46.620]  And of course, I believe in that. I believe that Gandhi and Martin Luther King did bring about positive changes and they weren't violent people.
[1:24:46.620 --> 1:24:51.620]  But when the state goes off track, you usually do have to stand up.
[1:24:51.620 --> 1:24:52.620]  Excuse me.
[1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:56.620]  And you're going to be talking about that at the rally for the Republic?
[1:24:56.620 --> 1:25:03.620]  Well, yeah, and just when civil disobedience should be practiced, it's an individual personal decision.
[1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:07.620]  But yes, this is an historic event coming up September 2nd.
[1:25:07.620 --> 1:25:12.620]  And I expect that we're going to have a grand rally.
[1:25:12.620 --> 1:25:17.620]  RonPaul.org, RonPaul.org, or rallyforrepublic.com.
[1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:22.620]  Congressman, we're praying for you. Thank you for your steadfast defense of humanity and liberty. Take care.
[1:25:22.620 --> 1:25:23.620]  Thank you very much.
[1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:28.620]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen. RonPaul there joining us.
[1:25:28.620 --> 1:25:36.620]  One of the first interviews he's done since he basically had to rush his wife to the hospital with very serious intestinal problems.
[1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:39.620]  And she came very close to not making it.
[1:25:39.620 --> 1:25:42.620]  She was on a ventilator for eight days, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:25:42.620 --> 1:25:47.620]  And they finally got the tube out of her nose yesterday, got her up and walking around.
[1:25:47.620 --> 1:25:51.620]  So this is one of the first interviews. He just came back to the airwaves last night and today.
[1:25:51.620 --> 1:25:54.620]  So here he is with us and we really appreciate him.
[1:25:54.620 --> 1:26:02.620]  And I'm not going to the rally for the Republic because I'm going to be going to Denver, hanging out with Luke Radowski and the We Are Changed guys and Jonathan Elanoff out there.
[1:26:02.620 --> 1:26:04.620]  Jonathan Elanoff joins us in about 35 minutes.
[1:26:04.620 --> 1:26:20.620]  But Jason Bermas will be sitting in here as the pilot while I'm co-pilot out in an Info War bombing run peacefully spreading knowledge and information in the Info War, destroying the lies and propaganda of the New World Order,
[1:26:20.620 --> 1:26:27.620]  getting a close up look at that FEMA camp, the microwave guns, the sound cannons, everything in Denver.
[1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:35.620]  And I'll be leaving this weekend and coming back the next weekend. Jason Bermas will also be sitting in on the Sunday show this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:26:35.620 --> 1:26:40.620]  And I'll be calling in with a report from Denver for you there as well.
[1:26:40.620 --> 1:26:46.620]  There's a big concert with the Rage Against the Machine and Flowbots and others. That's where the rubber bullets might fly.
[1:26:46.620 --> 1:26:52.620]  We'll be there covering that. We'll be there basically sneaking around, videotaping the police, tracking them.
[1:26:52.620 --> 1:27:02.620]  We need you to come out in Mass to Denver and just nonchalantly, some of you, we need, you know, we need Info War agents.
[1:27:02.620 --> 1:27:13.620]  We need Liberty defenders to counter the military operatives, the defense establishment, the defense intelligence people that will be out provocaturing.
[1:27:13.620 --> 1:27:17.620]  We need people to follow the worst anarchists back to where they're staying.
[1:27:17.620 --> 1:27:25.620]  We need to catch them on video, being given orders by police. When they arrest provocateurs, we need to try to stay on them no matter what you miss.
[1:27:25.620 --> 1:27:31.620]  You want to bring them down, folks. We've already done this in Canada and other places, in Italy, in Europe, and in the U.S.
[1:27:31.620 --> 1:27:35.620]  And it's really hurting them bad. Be wearing a suit and tie.
[1:27:35.620 --> 1:27:48.620]  Act like you're Obama-oid. Have a little camera. You know, be inside the convention center, inside the main lines. Bivouac yourself near police.
[1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:53.620]  Hang out and you'll see little anarchists come over and they'll look around.
[1:27:53.620 --> 1:27:59.620]  An intelligence officer will stand out and a lot of times, even in uniform, they'll give them orders and they'll slip out.
[1:27:59.620 --> 1:28:04.620]  And then you'll have on video them getting orders, then you'll see them provocaturing. It hurts them. It is devastating.
[1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:08.620]  It's a form of terrorism. It's against our First Amendment.
[1:28:08.620 --> 1:28:16.620]  They stage these events and they stage and hire provocateurs to try to discredit and give the image of protestors as violent masked people,
[1:28:16.620 --> 1:28:22.620]  breaking things so the police have a pretext, a lot of times not even knowing, to attack peaceful demonstrators,
[1:28:22.620 --> 1:28:28.620]  to then create a chilling effect to destroy rallies and demonstrations and petition for redress of grievances.
[1:28:28.620 --> 1:28:36.620]  Also, if you see somebody hitting cops and starting fights, you see them drag them off. Do whatever you have to calmly.
[1:28:36.620 --> 1:28:44.620]  This is hunting to get through the line or to set up somewhere with a far zoom to see them take them behind a truck
[1:28:44.620 --> 1:28:50.620]  and then later they'll take their mask off. It'll be the same person, same boots, and then show them come out from behind.
[1:28:50.620 --> 1:28:54.620]  We did that in the Montobello. That's been done.
[1:28:54.620 --> 1:28:58.620]  Our people, our great folks have done that in Seattle.
[1:28:58.620 --> 1:29:04.620]  I mean, for now, eight, nine years we've been catching them and it's so vital to defeat enemy operations.
[1:29:04.620 --> 1:29:10.620]  Before we could report this in 99, I could make a self-made film by police state to the takeover
[1:29:10.620 --> 1:29:18.620]  and it would get some circulation and wake some up and then it was one of the first videos to go viral on the web.
[1:29:18.620 --> 1:29:23.620]  But it isn't enough. Now the alternative media is so big that if we catch provocaturing,
[1:29:23.620 --> 1:29:29.620]  and I can't do it all, I need your help. I've been meaning to enlist people and I just haven't thought to do it on air.
[1:29:29.620 --> 1:29:33.620]  That doesn't mean get orders from me. It doesn't mean even get to me and give me the video.
[1:29:33.620 --> 1:29:39.620]  Don't wait. Get it up, explain what it is, link it to other videos of the police being caught doing it.
[1:29:39.620 --> 1:29:44.620]  This can really hurt them bad. This can really defend the First Amendment.
[1:29:44.620 --> 1:29:51.620]  That's our job, defending the Bill of Rights, defending America, defending our birthright, defending liberty.
[1:29:51.620 --> 1:29:55.620]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.

[1:32:01.620 --> 1:32:08.620]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:12.620]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:32:12.620 --> 1:32:14.620]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:32:14.620 --> 1:32:17.620]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.

[1:32:35.620 --> 1:32:54.620]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[1:33:11.620 --> 1:33:25.620]  Paul Watson, the man that runs prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv, my websites, under his tutelage. He has just really done a great job with the sites, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.net.
[1:33:25.620 --> 1:33:48.620]  He's with us for the next 30 minutes to talk about Georgia, the police state, the economy, all the key issues that are most important in the mind of Paul Watson, then the front lines of the New World Order activities with Jonathan Allen off next hour in Denver, warming up for continual on-the-ground coverage there, including live video feed coverage at infowars.com.
[1:33:48.620 --> 1:33:50.620]  Paul Watson, a lot is happening.
[1:33:50.620 --> 1:34:01.620]  Hello, Alex. Good to be back. Good to have you here with us. All right, give us your analysis, your take on where the Russia situation is going. Let's get into the economy, the police state, all of it.
[1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:20.620]  Well, the Russia situation basically started for me when a couple of Fridays ago, we were updating the websites in the morning, and we read stories about Georgian forces attacking and killing Russian peacekeepers.
[1:34:20.620 --> 1:34:35.620]  But by the time we went and looked at the news again in the afternoon, it became the fact that Russia had attacked Georgia, and the original stories about Georgia attacking the Russian peacekeepers had all but disappeared.
[1:34:35.620 --> 1:35:00.620]  And of course, that was time to coincide with the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. So by the time that Saturday morning came around, it was the evil Russians that had started the war, killed civilians, and they were being painted as the villains of the entire peace by the western media.
[1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:03.620]  And that's ongoing now. Break that down.
[1:35:03.620 --> 1:35:22.620]  Well, there's numerous examples. BBC, Sky News, CNN have all used footage of the ruins of the South Ossetian provincial capital, which was destroyed, 70% destroyed.
[1:35:22.620 --> 1:35:36.620]  They've all used footage of that destruction and said in the narrative that the footage represents the aftermath of the Russian attack on Gory, the Georgian town of Gory.
[1:35:36.620 --> 1:35:48.620]  And to have three separate western news networks carry out that scam is telling about the way in which the propaganda war is being waged.
[1:35:48.620 --> 1:36:03.620]  Yeah, they're not liberal. They're not conservative. They are Pentagon run, and that's come out in past years. This is just complete and total lies and contempt for the people to lie at this magnitude.
[1:36:03.620 --> 1:36:25.620]  Right, and I mean, it's not as if we haven't seen it before with the fake concentration camp in the Bosnia situation back in the mid-90s, where ITN, which is another British news organization, filmed a refugee camp from the inside looking out,
[1:36:25.620 --> 1:36:37.620]  and then splashed it across the newspapers the next day that it was a concentration camp, and that, of course, started the massacre of the Serbians, which was a NATO operation.
[1:36:37.620 --> 1:36:57.620]  But from the perspective from outside the US in this Russia-Georgia situation is that it's basically the decline and the next stage in the decline and fall of the Anglo-American Empire, because every time that Bush or Condoleezza Rice comes out and orders the Russians to pull their troops out
[1:36:57.620 --> 1:37:17.620]  or do anything else, come to the table, the Russians simply ignore them and do whatever is on their agenda. So the result of that is that it completely discredits the American Empire as it has been created and makes America look weak.
[1:37:17.620 --> 1:37:27.620]  And now the unprecedented move, I mean, this normally is a prelude to war, they have kicked the Russian ambassadors out of NATO.
[1:37:27.620 --> 1:37:38.620]  Right, so it's basically a redrawing of the lines. It's the emergence of Russia and China as the new empire and the decline and fall of the Anglo-American Empire.
[1:37:38.620 --> 1:37:52.620]  But even during the Cold War, Russia had ambassadors to NATO. That's part of daytime, part of talking. This is unprecedented. This is a message as they roll weapons and troops into the region surrounding Russia.
[1:37:52.620 --> 1:38:04.620]  And now we have the number two general in Russia coming out and saying that they are getting intel that you reported yesterday at prisonplanet.com that a false flag attack may be in the offing. Tell folks about that.
[1:38:04.620 --> 1:38:16.620]  Yeah, that was the Russian general, Staff Anatoly Noguz being difficult to pronounce. But yeah, he's the top general in the Russian military.
[1:38:16.620 --> 1:38:40.620]  And he said on Monday that Georgia was possibly planning to commit a false flag terror attack by using mercenaries with slavic appearance, clad in the uniform of the Russian military, which is why they station troops around sensitive areas like hydroelectric plants and so forth.
[1:38:40.620 --> 1:38:53.620]  Because they think that Russia, that Georgia's sorry, is about to attempt a false flag attack, which would then be blamed on either Chechen separatist or whatever you want.
[1:38:53.620 --> 1:39:01.620]  And let's be clear, there's already been a false flag attack, an attack on Russia, and then the media claiming Russia did it. That is a false flag right there.
[1:39:01.620 --> 1:39:08.620]  And so when they say they're getting intel, that they may blow stuff up and blame on the Russians, I mean this is getting really serious.
[1:39:08.620 --> 1:39:25.620]  Yeah, I mean the original attack claimed it was indiscriminate in targeting civilian areas, universities and hospitals and so forth, killed over, I mean the conservative estimate is 1400 civilians in South Asetia.
[1:39:25.620 --> 1:39:43.620]  While that was taking place, the world was transfixed with the Olympics, and I mean it took about six or eight hours for the mainstream media to even report on what was going on and when they did it was about the evil Russian aggressors.
[1:39:43.620 --> 1:39:54.620]  Well that tells us right there, the western media is completely evil, the governments are completely criminal, and we already knew this but it's just more validation that you can believe nothing they say or do.
[1:39:54.620 --> 1:39:59.620]  It is a criminal enterprise going for broke.
[1:39:59.620 --> 1:40:20.620]  Exactly, I mean it was exemplified when they had that 12 year old American girl on Fox News who was talking about how the Russians were the aggressors and I mean how the Georgians were the aggressors and she was saved by the Russian troops and they just cut her off.
[1:40:20.620 --> 1:40:42.620]  And I mean Sky News and others have used actual clips of South Asetian civilians screaming and crying and mourning their loved ones and said that they were Georgian citizens mourning the loss of their loved ones after the Russian attacks so they'll completely flip it around.
[1:40:42.620 --> 1:40:58.620]  They've even shown Georgian troops attacking, as you said, South Asetia and then saying that they're Russian, they've shown South Asetian hospitals and said that it's Georgians, total contempt, total deception.
[1:40:58.620 --> 1:41:00.620]  Do you know what this means listeners?
[1:41:00.620 --> 1:41:03.620]  Do you know what it means the average yuppie out there listening, laughing right now?
[1:41:03.620 --> 1:41:10.620]  And this isn't cute, these levels of lies are very, very dangerous.
[1:41:10.620 --> 1:41:23.620]  And then another thing that's dangerous is the fact that you've got this Sarkash Vili character who is so clearly mentally unstable.
[1:41:23.620 --> 1:41:37.620]  There was footage of him which we posted on Monday where he's on live television, he's talking to Bush or Condoleezza Rice on the phone and he literally starts eating his own tie.
[1:41:37.620 --> 1:41:41.620]  And it's not as if it's, you know, it's not a clear thing, he's actually eating his tie.
[1:41:41.620 --> 1:41:46.620]  It was like a Monty Python skit of showing a crazy person on a mental institution.
[1:41:46.620 --> 1:41:57.620]  He crams the red tie in his mouth and then like a child with a crazy look starts chewing on it and just keeps going on live TV going, oh, I mean just nuts.
[1:41:57.620 --> 1:42:06.620]  Exactly, and then there's that other footage of him scampering away after a plane flies over and it's just pathetic.
[1:42:06.620 --> 1:42:15.620]  There are people behind him are pathetic that, you know, NATO and the Anglo-American Empire, every time they make a statement and Russia ignores it, it just makes them look weaker.
[1:42:15.620 --> 1:42:24.620]  So it's the next stage in the collapse of that empire and the advance of a new one and that's obvious for everyone to see.
[1:42:24.620 --> 1:42:33.620]  Well, I mean the Russians aren't good, their government's corrupt, most governments are bad, the Chinese government's horrible, but the point is when we're worse than them
[1:42:33.620 --> 1:42:44.620]  and when we have leaders that are, I mean, Condoleezza Rice is a complete moron, Bush is a complete joke, and we're all being blamed for this, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:44.620 --> 1:42:55.620]  The world knows we're lying, it's all over foreign news, look at the American media, they are congenital liars, look how dumb their people are, you know, they say Russia attacked Georgia.
[1:42:55.620 --> 1:43:00.620]  I mean, we are a laughing stock, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:43:00.620 --> 1:43:19.620]  Yeah, I mean, there's been global polls about, you know, which side people believe and the overwhelming majority believe the Russians and it's not as if the Russians haven't been, you know, fingering the fact that the entire western media is engaged in,
[1:43:19.620 --> 1:43:33.620]  I mean, Lavrov came out the Russian foreign minister and he called it a propaganda scam that is attempting to present an aggression on the part of the Georgian army against its own citizens as a conflict between Georgia and Russia.
[1:43:33.620 --> 1:43:48.620]  I mean, what do they expect Russia to do? They came in, they pushed the military out, the Georgians kept firing while saying cease fire, cease fire, begging for help and announcing that Russia had invaded and the Russians have pulled back.
[1:43:48.620 --> 1:44:12.620]  I mean, yeah, exactly, then you've got, I think it was last Friday, repeated reports about Russia attacking or advancing towards in preparation to attack the Georgian capital Tbilisi and other areas which the media was reporting that they were attacking.
[1:44:12.620 --> 1:44:25.620]  The next day the news completely disappeared because it was completely made up and the Russians were trying to point this out and, you know, nobody mentions it the next day when it disappears from the headline.
[1:44:25.620 --> 1:44:32.620]  What we are is a delusional country and what extent is it in England? I know your media is almost worse than the US media.
[1:44:32.620 --> 1:44:43.620]  I have to say on this subject, you know, later they'll claim they weren't part of it, it's a little bit slicker in England, but at the time their justices are worse at twisting and lying. Are the British people buying it?
[1:44:43.620 --> 1:45:02.620]  Not as much as the Americans, that's for sure. I mean, there were headlines in the newspaper the day after it happened saying, you know, the pipeline war and people began to learn that it was about this BTC pipeline that passes just underneath Russia.
[1:45:02.620 --> 1:45:18.620]  But what's good about Britain is that Russia today, which has carried all the most precise news about this entire conflict is on the satellite broadcasting system along with Sky News, BBC and all the others.
[1:45:18.620 --> 1:45:34.620]  And I mean, we've been accused of parroting Russian propaganda, but the fact is that Russia today have had on, for interviews, Paul Craig Roberts, you know, people from Lurotwell.com,
[1:45:34.620 --> 1:45:52.620]  who are on your show regularly. Well, I have to say, I mean, Russia today is incredibly accurate. I mean, it's thought provoking. I mean, I wish we had TV like that here. I'm watching it and I've got research from other sides.
[1:45:52.620 --> 1:46:00.620]  I'm not even just believing it, and it's accurate. I mean, it blows me away.
[1:46:00.620 --> 1:46:08.620]  Yeah, to say that the Russian media is more independent than the British or the American just highlights how much trouble we're in.
[1:46:08.620 --> 1:46:20.620]  Because I mean, they'll even quote show both sides, but there isn't really any both sides about it. I'm worried, Paul. It's getting crazier and crazier.
[1:46:20.620 --> 1:46:36.620]  Exactly. Whereas, you know, everybody in America or if you take Yahoo.com as the news agenda in America, they're concerned about a plastic monkey suit that people claim is Bigfoot and that's been top of the news all this week.
[1:46:36.620 --> 1:46:38.620]  I mean, what is going on in people's minds?
[1:46:38.620 --> 1:46:52.620]  You've got two scam artist corrections officers running around with this monkey suit that I identified in five minutes. Exactly. They want to know about a monkey suit. I'm sorry, the Russian media, the people there, they don't want to know about monkey suits, folks.
[1:46:52.620 --> 1:47:02.620]  The Japanese, we have, well, in my own private life, I deal with people making up stuff about me that's just whole cloth made up and our own movement buys it.
[1:47:02.620 --> 1:47:14.620]  And it's like, answer for this, answer for that. I'm like, it's not even true. I'm, you know, it's just so incredible. I mean, we really, I keep repeating it, but it is, it is a wanton delusion.
[1:47:14.620 --> 1:47:18.620]  People are delusional, Paul.
[1:47:18.620 --> 1:47:34.620]  Well, exactly. It gives them refuge, doesn't it, from facing real issues. I mean, it's been that way for a while, but the level of wanton mindlessness, which is evident when you read the news every day.
[1:47:34.620 --> 1:47:56.620]  And what is top of the news is just baffling when a fake monkey suit can be top of the news while we may be on the verge of World War Three, or at the very least, you know, a future nuclear conflict, and people are obsessing about a plastic monkey suit for an entire week.
[1:47:56.620 --> 1:47:58.620]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[1:47:58.620 --> 1:48:12.620]  Well, over that weekend, 888, 889, 810, the top story was celebrity hairdos and a car wreck by some Hollywood star.
[1:48:12.620 --> 1:48:22.620]  I just don't, I mean, folks, this is life and death. This isn't a game. This isn't a game having a criminal media that tells you Russia attacked Georgia.
[1:48:22.620 --> 1:48:32.620]  It isn't a game having a criminal media. The government staged terror attacks, folks. It's now come out mainstream news that Dick Cheney wanted to stage more and blow up our ships.
[1:48:32.620 --> 1:48:40.620]  They're not playing games. We're all in danger here. I'm sorry, monkey suits aren't important.
[1:48:40.620 --> 1:48:56.620]  And as Ron Paul was talking about earlier, both McCain and Obama are fully behind the U.S. NATO client state, Georgia. Today, people are tipping, I don't know if it's being announced yet, it was set to be announced today or tomorrow.
[1:48:56.620 --> 1:48:58.620]  Hillary.
[1:48:58.620 --> 1:49:12.620]  The favorite, or one of the favorites, part of Hillary is this guy from Indiana, this senator, Evan Byte, who is the most virulent neocon you could ever imagine.
[1:49:12.620 --> 1:49:23.620]  He was actually on the Liberation, the committee for the liberation of Iraq with John McCain in 2003, which propagandized for the invasion of Iraq.
[1:49:23.620 --> 1:49:25.620]  Oh, so you're talking about who McCain's about to tip.
[1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:28.620]  No, I'm talking about Barack Obama.
[1:49:28.620 --> 1:49:32.620]  I didn't know that. He's looking at, oh my God.
[1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:45.620]  This is a U.S. News and World Report said yesterday, quote, top Democratic Party officials are expecting Barack Obama to select Indiana senator Evan Byte as his running mate as early as midweek.
[1:49:45.620 --> 1:49:56.620]  I don't know if it's going to be him, but he said that he's the favorite. And he voted for the reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2006.
[1:49:56.620 --> 1:50:07.620]  He's repeatedly said that Iran has got a nuclear weapons program despite the fact that the National Intelligence Agency and the CIA said that's not true.
[1:50:07.620 --> 1:50:14.620]  He's a keen supporter of APEC, the pro-Israel lobby group, and he's potentially going to be Obama's running mate.
[1:50:14.620 --> 1:50:19.620]  Hi there. Let's talk more about it with Paul Watson, prisonplanet.com.
[1:50:19.620 --> 1:50:32.620]  This is dangerous times, ladies and gentlemen. A bunch of hardcore criminals doing whatever they want in a public just completely lobotomized.
[1:50:32.620 --> 1:50:41.620]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:50:41.620 --> 1:50:48.620]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:50:48.620 --> 1:50:57.620]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:50:57.620 --> 1:51:05.620]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:51:05.620 --> 1:51:14.620]  He was handed over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[1:53:46.620 --> 1:53:52.620]  I've got it. Simone, I'm going to put a letter in the next hour of Connellisa Rice on TBS News demonizing Russia and lying.
[1:53:52.620 --> 1:54:00.620]  And I've been reading during the break every comment. These are people in the U.S. who are saying your complete liars, Russia attacked.
[1:54:00.620 --> 1:54:14.620]  No one. Georgia attacked them. And you're saying your pack of liars. I think the New World Order is really, really starting to destroy all their credibility.
[1:54:14.620 --> 1:54:25.620]  But going back to Paul Watson, Paul, you were bringing up the neocon that Barack Obama, I've got the U.S. News and World Report here.
[1:54:25.620 --> 1:54:35.620]  It certainly does say that he's probably going to pick a neocon warmonger as his VP. I mean, that's just part of the course. Go ahead.
[1:54:35.620 --> 1:54:51.620]  Yeah. And there's a quote, which is from yhouse.gov, which says on October 2, 2002, by joint president George W. Bush and congressional leaders in a rose garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution
[1:54:51.620 --> 1:54:59.620]  authorizing the Iraq war and was thanked by Bush and Senator John McCain, Obama's deposed adversary, for cosponsoring the resolution.
[1:54:59.620 --> 1:55:08.620]  And he's also brought into force these resolutions against Iraq. I mean, Iran, sorry.
[1:55:08.620 --> 1:55:15.620]  But most of these Democrats who voted for the Iraq war, you know, later recant or supposedly recant.
[1:55:15.620 --> 1:55:26.620]  But Senator Biden even recant in February 2006. He refused to renounce his support for the war in Iraq in an interview with the Washington Post.
[1:55:26.620 --> 1:55:43.620]  And he also voted for the reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act in 2006, having also declared his, quote, lifelong affection for the state of Israel, APEC luncheon in the same year.
[1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:50.620]  So he's a complete neocon. He sat on the commission with McCain to propagandize for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
[1:55:50.620 --> 1:55:59.620]  And he's also a Bilderberg member who gave a keynote speech at the 1999 Bilderberg meeting in Portugal.
[1:55:59.620 --> 1:56:05.620]  And this is the person that they're tipping to become Obama's essential future VP.
[1:56:05.620 --> 1:56:14.620]  So this empty platitude of change is once again, you know, revealed for the reality of what it is, which is the status quo.
[1:56:14.620 --> 1:56:21.620]  Well, look at the Obama campaign going after Jerome Corsi for 9-11 Truth.
[1:56:21.620 --> 1:56:28.620]  So see now the Democrats, oh, you better not talk about 9-11 Truth. I mean, there's just no difference.
[1:56:28.620 --> 1:56:36.620]  Well, I read the news that McCain's five points ahead and I couldn't care less, to be honest, because Obama would be more dangerous.
[1:56:36.620 --> 1:56:45.620]  You know, we had a fresh-faced young contender here in 1997 who promised change.
[1:56:45.620 --> 1:56:49.620]  And his name was Tony Blair. Look what happened after that.
[1:56:49.620 --> 1:57:01.620]  And the same kind of mindless idolatry of Blair is what I'm seeing now with Obama in 2008.
[1:57:01.620 --> 1:57:14.620]  So if he's the man, then you can only expect things to get worse because they'll bring in the left fist of the socialist encroachment on your private lives just as they have in Britain.
[1:57:14.620 --> 1:57:18.620]  And the Democrats are piling on to strengthen all the police state.
[1:57:18.620 --> 1:57:24.620]  And I want to see what liberals are going to do. Are you just going to now hail it and go, yes, it's, you know, it's good.
[1:57:24.620 --> 1:57:27.620]  But it was bad when Bush was doing it. Oh, man.
[1:57:27.620 --> 1:57:33.620]  You know, I'm tired of being called a right-winger, then a left-winger. Now I'm going to be a right-winger again if Obama gets elected.
[1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:39.620]  I just can't imagine McCain. I mean, the vast majority, I've seen the statistics.
[1:57:39.620 --> 1:57:45.620]  It's 90-plus percent of those that get that type of cancer that McCain had.
[1:57:45.620 --> 1:57:51.620]  They end up dying within 10 years. And he had it nine years ago.
[1:57:51.620 --> 1:57:57.620]  His heads, his cheeks are always swollen, his neck's always swollen. He looks like he's about to die.
[1:57:57.620 --> 1:57:59.620]  Oh, God.
[1:57:59.620 --> 1:58:04.620]  And it's all this evil scum running everything. It's never going to end, these people.
[1:58:04.620 --> 1:58:08.620]  Paul Lawson, stay there. I want to do five more minutes with him. We're going to get Jonathan Ellen off.
[1:58:08.620 --> 1:58:25.620]  We are Change Colorado as we look deeply into police state developing in Denver, but I'll be right in the middle of next week.
[1:58:25.620 --> 1:58:32.620]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:32.620 --> 1:58:36.620]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:58:36.620 --> 1:58:41.620]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:58:41.620 --> 1:58:48.620]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:58:48.620 --> 1:58:55.620]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:58:55.620 --> 1:58:59.620]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:58:59.620 --> 1:59:09.620]  Lawson's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:59:09.620 --> 1:59:18.620]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:18.620 --> 1:59:27.620]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:27.620 --> 1:59:34.620]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:34.620 --> 1:59:47.620]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:59:47.620 --> 2:00:07.620]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:07.620 --> 2:00:14.620]  We had Ron Paul on in the second hour, ladies and gentlemen. We're talking to Paul Watson right now.
[2:00:14.620 --> 2:00:19.620]  Paul, I'm about to get into the microwave guns and the sound cannons and secret FEMA camps.
[2:00:19.620 --> 2:00:25.620]  And local police saying, oh, we built a secret 5,000-man camp, but we can't tell you about it.
[2:00:25.620 --> 2:00:32.620]  Now our local police are secret. Even Keith Urban admits they've been secretly federalized.
[2:00:32.620 --> 2:00:38.620]  I mean, it's a fake media, nothing but lies. Four plus trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[2:00:38.620 --> 2:00:45.620]  I mean, it is completely lawless. The government's completely illegitimate.
[2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:51.620]  And it's only getting worse. And then meanwhile, I read about England with the frisk, the checkpoints,
[2:00:51.620 --> 2:00:56.620]  stopping your brother, putting him in a terror database. I got stopped when I was over there.
[2:00:56.620 --> 2:01:03.620]  Just tattletales everywhere. More and more police. Total control. You take a picture of the cops, they come and beat you up.
[2:01:03.620 --> 2:01:10.620]  I mean, the whole western world is sliding into tyranny, especially England and the US.
[2:01:10.620 --> 2:01:21.620]  Yeah, the latest round of the police day in Britain was started with the aid of a media scaremongering campaign about knife crime,
[2:01:21.620 --> 2:01:26.620]  which the official figures show that violent crime is in fact down.
[2:01:26.620 --> 2:01:30.620]  But notice how they call it knife crime and gun crime. Go ahead.
[2:01:30.620 --> 2:01:36.620]  Yeah, and now on the back of this supposed epidemic of knife crime,
[2:01:36.620 --> 2:01:44.620]  which on the news at six o'clock in the evening, they show people running up to other people on CCTV cameras
[2:01:44.620 --> 2:01:47.620]  and violently stabbing them in the chest and so forth.
[2:01:47.620 --> 2:01:51.620]  And that's what the cameras are used for, is to show you and scare you more.
[2:01:51.620 --> 2:01:58.620]  Yeah, so in response now, they've got random police checkpoints where police will just randomly show up on mass
[2:01:58.620 --> 2:02:04.620]  in riot vans to a train station, for example, which happened in a town not far from me.
[2:02:04.620 --> 2:02:07.620]  And they're doing it in the nice areas. They come over to old people and stuff.
[2:02:07.620 --> 2:02:12.620]  Just like TSA goes crazy when they see a World War II vet on a walker. Go ahead.
[2:02:12.620 --> 2:02:20.620]  Yeah, so the police will turn up on mass and just start frisking people and harassing people in the name of stopping knife crime.
[2:02:20.620 --> 2:02:23.620]  It's completely random. It would have no effect.
[2:02:23.620 --> 2:02:30.620]  And now they've actually brought a law in which says that if you are caught possessing a knife,
[2:02:30.620 --> 2:02:38.620]  it's instantly three years in prison, which came into effect the Monday after I got back from Switzerland
[2:02:38.620 --> 2:02:43.620]  where I had bought my dad a Swiss army knife as a gift.
[2:02:43.620 --> 2:02:44.620]  Oh.
[2:02:44.620 --> 2:02:49.620]  So if I'd have been going back a week later, I could have been locked up for three years
[2:02:49.620 --> 2:02:52.620]  for the crime of possessing a Swiss army knife.
[2:02:52.620 --> 2:02:55.620]  I don't think we're joking. One guy had been robbed three times.
[2:02:55.620 --> 2:02:59.620]  He had an old shotgun and shot one of them. He spent more than a decade in prison.
[2:02:59.620 --> 2:03:03.620]  They got his farm in lawsuits. He didn't want them raping his wife.
[2:03:03.620 --> 2:03:08.620]  People have used a butcher knife against attackers. They get charged.
[2:03:08.620 --> 2:03:14.620]  The state doesn't want you defending yourself, especially in England.
[2:03:14.620 --> 2:03:19.620]  And I remember the BBC what five years ago the government called for registering all knives in the home.
[2:03:19.620 --> 2:03:21.620]  Is that next, Paul?
[2:03:21.620 --> 2:03:27.620]  That's on the agenda. And exactly as you said, they don't want anyone being able to defend themselves.
[2:03:27.620 --> 2:03:30.620]  They don't want any form of self-sufficiency.
[2:03:30.620 --> 2:03:35.620]  You know, in England now they've got adverts on the TV threatening people with jail time.
[2:03:35.620 --> 2:03:42.620]  If they don't get a license for their fishing rod, not just that you have to have a license to fish in certain areas,
[2:03:42.620 --> 2:03:46.620]  but you have to have a license just to own a fishing rod now in England.
[2:03:46.620 --> 2:03:48.620]  That's how bad it's getting.
[2:03:48.620 --> 2:03:53.620]  Total control, total scum government. I mean, the Soviet Union was never this bad.
[2:03:53.620 --> 2:04:00.620]  Just humiliation, domination, just the opposite of freedom, fat, stupid, evil cops stumbling around everywhere,
[2:04:00.620 --> 2:04:05.620]  armed felons in the military, just urinating and defecating all over us,
[2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:10.620]  just laughing and smiling and giggling as everything goes to hell in the handbasket
[2:04:10.620 --> 2:04:16.620]  with a pack of media liars and criminals sucking the currency dry, blowing everything out.
[2:04:16.620 --> 2:04:18.620]  That's what we're up against.
[2:04:18.620 --> 2:04:21.620]  Oh, dear God. Paul, stay there. We're getting Ellen off on the line,
[2:04:21.620 --> 2:04:25.620]  but I want to cross over with you and Ellen off for a segment about any other police state news in England.
[2:04:25.620 --> 2:04:28.620]  You know what, government? You're illegitimate. You're criminal.
[2:04:28.620 --> 2:04:32.620]  You're not legitimate to me. You're nothing but criminal scum.
[2:04:32.620 --> 2:04:35.620]  You're put on notice. Declaration of Independence.
[2:04:35.620 --> 2:04:39.620]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:04:39.620 --> 2:04:44.620]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world of government.
[2:04:44.620 --> 2:04:50.620]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:04:50.620 --> 2:04:53.620]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:04:53.620 --> 2:04:56.620]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[2:04:56.620 --> 2:05:01.620]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:05:03.620 --> 2:05:09.620]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[2:05:16.620 --> 2:05:19.620]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:05:19.620 --> 2:05:21.620]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[2:05:30.620 --> 2:05:43.620]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[2:05:43.620 --> 2:05:47.620]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[2:05:47.620 --> 2:05:51.620]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[2:05:51.620 --> 2:06:01.620]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries costs last year.

[2:07:35.620 --> 2:07:38.620]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:07:38.620 --> 2:07:53.620]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:53.620 --> 2:07:58.620]  You've got to have a license for a TV set, a license for your fishing rod.
[2:07:58.620 --> 2:08:05.620]  England has now implemented a license to be able to change baby diapers to hug your children or be able to take them to events.
[2:08:05.620 --> 2:08:09.620]  It's pedophilia to hug your child, your child.
[2:08:09.620 --> 2:08:13.620]  Of course the pedophiles that run the government are the ones doing that and I'm not joking.
[2:08:13.620 --> 2:08:15.620]  That's who runs the New World Order.
[2:08:15.620 --> 2:08:17.620]  It's the total destruction of the family.
[2:08:17.620 --> 2:08:21.620]  They're a few years ahead of us in England but they're trying to push all the same things here.
[2:08:21.620 --> 2:08:27.620]  Paul, some of the other fun things, the scumbag criminals that rule over you in England,
[2:08:27.620 --> 2:08:31.620]  where you're a subject, are now doing to you.
[2:08:31.620 --> 2:08:37.620]  In England over the past two years there's always been a big controversy about bins,
[2:08:37.620 --> 2:08:44.620]  which is trash cans, because now they're moving less and less towards collecting them once weekly
[2:08:44.620 --> 2:08:50.620]  and are now imposing fines for people who either leave them out on the wrong day
[2:08:50.620 --> 2:08:55.620]  or if the lid on the trash can is slightly a jaw.
[2:08:55.620 --> 2:08:58.620]  I mean, I had this happen to me personally.
[2:08:58.620 --> 2:09:04.620]  I put an extra bin in the trash can and the lid was slightly a jaw,
[2:09:04.620 --> 2:09:07.620]  so they slapped a sticker on the bin thing.
[2:09:07.620 --> 2:09:14.620]  If you don't close the bin lid, we won't collect your trash can and you leave the subject to a fine.
[2:09:14.620 --> 2:09:16.620]  People are being arrested for that now, but this is the point.
[2:09:16.620 --> 2:09:20.620]  Petty, tiny, small things now, you're going to go to jail.
[2:09:20.620 --> 2:09:22.620]  That's the New World Order system.
[2:09:22.620 --> 2:09:29.620]  Yeah, and they've got these environmental crime units with hundreds of tattletales running around
[2:09:29.620 --> 2:09:34.620]  waiting for people to drop tiny pieces of food so they can slap fines on them.
[2:09:34.620 --> 2:09:37.620]  Oh yeah, who was the guy that dropped an apple core and got arrested?
[2:09:37.620 --> 2:09:40.620]  Yeah, there was a guy that, well, he didn't even drop an apple.
[2:09:40.620 --> 2:09:44.620]  They claimed he dropped an apple core even though he said he didn't.
[2:09:44.620 --> 2:09:50.620]  So then they pursued him halfway across the town and then finally arrested him
[2:09:50.620 --> 2:09:55.620]  and held him in a cell for hours on end for the crime of allegedly dropping an apple core.
[2:09:55.620 --> 2:09:56.620]  And this was at an outdoor cafe.
[2:09:56.620 --> 2:09:58.620]  It was found off the table.
[2:09:58.620 --> 2:10:00.620]  I mean, when I go to a restaurant, I got little children.
[2:10:00.620 --> 2:10:01.620]  There's always stuff under the table.
[2:10:01.620 --> 2:10:03.620]  That's it, jail time.
[2:10:03.620 --> 2:10:09.620]  And there was a woman who was bought a sausage roll and fed a piece to a young daughter
[2:10:09.620 --> 2:10:14.620]  and a tiny bit of pastry dropped off and immediately pigeon swooped down to eat it.
[2:10:14.620 --> 2:10:20.620]  But these environmental crime unit officers came running across the road to harass her
[2:10:20.620 --> 2:10:25.620]  and gave her a fine for the crime of dropping a tiny piece of pastry.
[2:10:25.620 --> 2:10:30.620]  Now again, when you're in England, you'll see hordes of third world people doing whatever they want.
[2:10:30.620 --> 2:10:35.620]  But when you see citizens, they just run over and harass you.
[2:10:35.620 --> 2:10:37.620]  It's to let you know because they know you pay the taxes.
[2:10:37.620 --> 2:10:38.620]  They know you're the cow.
[2:10:38.620 --> 2:10:43.620]  They know you're the milk cow and they're letting you know you work for us now.
[2:10:43.620 --> 2:10:46.620]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[2:10:46.620 --> 2:10:49.620]  Yes, to send a message saying where the boss is.
[2:10:49.620 --> 2:10:52.620]  As you mentioned before, it's like the panopticon.
[2:10:52.620 --> 2:10:57.620]  People are told and it's reinforced constantly that they're under surveillance, that they're harassed.
[2:10:57.620 --> 2:11:02.620]  And so they self-regulate their own behavior so people just don't go out anymore
[2:11:02.620 --> 2:11:09.620]  and they don't talk to their neighbors in the fear that they might say something suspicious or whatever.
[2:11:09.620 --> 2:11:13.620]  Now in England, they pull up with vans and make people randomly walk through them looking for weapons.
[2:11:13.620 --> 2:11:17.620]  They make you register with a thumbprint at almost all the big bars in London
[2:11:17.620 --> 2:11:21.620]  and then, quote, a tissue test you for drugs when you go in.
[2:11:21.620 --> 2:11:26.620]  I mean, think of a science fiction movie 20 years ago where they DNA test you to go in a bar.
[2:11:26.620 --> 2:11:29.620]  But see, it's commonplace now.
[2:11:29.620 --> 2:11:32.620]  Like that guy at the Hard Rock Cafe in London, he said, I don't see those cameras.
[2:11:32.620 --> 2:11:33.620]  They don't exist.
[2:11:33.620 --> 2:11:34.620]  He wasn't joking.
[2:11:34.620 --> 2:11:37.620]  He said, I choose not to see them.
[2:11:37.620 --> 2:11:44.620]  That's right, people just try and live their lives without the knowledge that eventually all of this is going to impact them directly.
[2:11:44.620 --> 2:11:47.620]  Well, they're all being injected with cancer viruses.
[2:11:47.620 --> 2:11:50.620]  That's why you got 25, 35-year-old women all getting cancer.
[2:11:50.620 --> 2:11:51.620]  The numbers exploded.
[2:11:51.620 --> 2:11:56.620]  People dying everywhere and it's just the government still inject, inject, inject, inject.
[2:11:56.620 --> 2:11:57.620]  Eugenics, eugenics.
[2:11:57.620 --> 2:12:01.620]  We've killed tens of thousands of you and other tests we've been caught doing.
[2:12:01.620 --> 2:12:03.620]  But trust us now, Alex Jones is lying.
[2:12:03.620 --> 2:12:04.620]  Take the shots.
[2:12:04.620 --> 2:12:05.620]  We love you.
[2:12:05.620 --> 2:12:09.620]  Russia really did attack Georgia and there were WMDs.
[2:12:09.620 --> 2:12:10.620]  Everything's fine.
[2:12:10.620 --> 2:12:19.620]  What's happening now in the UK is that parents are so suspicious of the vaccines that governments are openly saying,
[2:12:19.620 --> 2:12:25.620]  right, we're going to start an education campaign about the fact that the MMR shot it really is safe.
[2:12:25.620 --> 2:12:32.620]  So they're openly saying that they're going to start a PR campaign because they know that people are skeptical of the vaccines now.
[2:12:32.620 --> 2:12:34.620]  So that's the benchmark of our success.
[2:12:34.620 --> 2:12:38.620]  Yeah, because the child takes it and goes into a convulsion and never comes back.
[2:12:38.620 --> 2:12:40.620]  Then they swat him for that.
[2:12:40.620 --> 2:12:42.620]  I'm sorry, what were you saying?
[2:12:42.620 --> 2:12:47.620]  Mass fluoridization of British drinking water supplies.
[2:12:47.620 --> 2:12:54.620]  People are eating the MSG-filled crisps and chips and all this kind of stuff.
[2:12:54.620 --> 2:12:55.620]  It's an attack.
[2:12:55.620 --> 2:12:57.620]  It's an attack on the mind.
[2:12:57.620 --> 2:12:59.620]  Well, here's an example.
[2:12:59.620 --> 2:13:04.620]  Big red chewing gum, Wrigley's spearmint.
[2:13:04.620 --> 2:13:06.620]  They all have aspartame even if they're not sugar-free.
[2:13:06.620 --> 2:13:07.620]  Everything has it.
[2:13:07.620 --> 2:13:08.620]  You can't find gum.
[2:13:08.620 --> 2:13:09.620]  I challenge you.
[2:13:09.620 --> 2:13:15.620]  Go to a store in the US and if it's a big candy aisle, you might find one gum that doesn't have it.
[2:13:15.620 --> 2:13:16.620]  Maybe.
[2:13:16.620 --> 2:13:18.620]  Before it wasn't there.
[2:13:18.620 --> 2:13:23.620]  Now, MSG admittedly attacks the brain, causes inflammation, retardation over time.
[2:13:23.620 --> 2:13:24.620]  It's in everything.
[2:13:24.620 --> 2:13:29.620]  In the sodium fluoride, they haven't fluoridated your water until now.
[2:13:29.620 --> 2:13:33.620]  They even have studies in England where they first fluoridated some cities 30 years ago.
[2:13:33.620 --> 2:13:39.620]  20% IQ is lower in the city than to a town right next door that doesn't have it.
[2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:41.620]  Same thing with Amish communities.
[2:13:41.620 --> 2:13:44.620]  It is a fact and that's why we're so dumb in this country.
[2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:46.620]  Soon, Paul, you're going to be joining us.
[2:13:46.620 --> 2:13:53.620]  There's a stereotype in Britain which says that Midland is people who live around Birmingham.
[2:13:53.620 --> 2:13:57.620]  That area are the most dumbest people in Britain.
[2:13:57.620 --> 2:14:01.620]  Coincidentally, guess who's had fluoridated water for decades?
[2:14:01.620 --> 2:14:04.620]  Midland is people around that area.
[2:14:04.620 --> 2:14:06.620]  It's a multiple level attack.
[2:14:06.620 --> 2:14:08.620]  As he said, wriggly chewing gum.
[2:14:08.620 --> 2:14:10.620]  They've got a monopoly in Britain.
[2:14:10.620 --> 2:14:17.620]  You can't get any other brand of chewing gum and it's filled to the brim with aspartame.
[2:14:17.620 --> 2:14:23.620]  You know how I discovered that because I was eating something and I got a headache.
[2:14:23.620 --> 2:14:27.620]  That was a double blind.
[2:14:27.620 --> 2:14:28.620]  It wasn't placebo.
[2:14:28.620 --> 2:14:29.620]  It wasn't psychosomatic.
[2:14:29.620 --> 2:14:34.620]  I got a headache like a Diet Coke and I looked and it was aspartame.
[2:14:34.620 --> 2:14:36.620]  I had the same experience.
[2:14:36.620 --> 2:14:38.620]  I used to chew it all the time.
[2:14:38.620 --> 2:14:44.620]  I finally found some on the internet that I have to get in bulk on mail order.
[2:14:44.620 --> 2:14:47.620]  It doesn't have aspartame in it.
[2:14:47.620 --> 2:14:51.620]  I think it's slowly, people are getting educated about it.
[2:14:51.620 --> 2:14:55.620]  It was even in the film Shooter where the guy makes the joke about,
[2:14:55.620 --> 2:15:02.620]  oh yeah and there were WMDs in Iraq and artificial sweeteners are perfect for your health.
[2:15:02.620 --> 2:15:06.620]  I think it's getting out there and slowly people are starting to wake up.
[2:15:06.620 --> 2:15:09.620]  Now you're getting industries that are catering in this country
[2:15:09.620 --> 2:15:14.620]  towards MSG free crisps and completely GM free food.
[2:15:14.620 --> 2:15:19.620]  So if people start waking up about it then it becomes a business opportunity as well.
[2:15:19.620 --> 2:15:20.620]  So that's a good thing.
[2:15:20.620 --> 2:15:24.620]  Well let me say something to the police listening all over the country in the world.
[2:15:24.620 --> 2:15:29.620]  If I walked up to you and hit you in the head with a hammer and brain damage you
[2:15:29.620 --> 2:15:32.620]  and you lost 20 IQ points, you'd be pretty mad at me wouldn't you?
[2:15:32.620 --> 2:15:36.620]  But your loving government puts in your water that you breathe,
[2:15:36.620 --> 2:15:39.620]  you breathe, you go through your skin and you drink, something that hurts you
[2:15:39.620 --> 2:15:41.620]  and your children and I know you don't care about yourself
[2:15:41.620 --> 2:15:45.620]  and you've bought into the evil so you're going to deny what I'm saying is true.
[2:15:45.620 --> 2:15:49.620]  But at least for your children check into what I'm saying.
[2:15:49.620 --> 2:15:53.620]  Thousands of government university studies on average at 20% IQ reduction.
[2:15:53.620 --> 2:15:55.620]  I mean you don't want to do that to yourself.
[2:15:55.620 --> 2:15:58.620]  I mean even if you're really stupid and already had a low IQ and wrecked a lot of fluorides
[2:15:58.620 --> 2:16:04.620]  to your borderline retarded, please, please don't do it to your children.
[2:16:04.620 --> 2:16:07.620]  I'm going to talk slow to them and I'm being serious.
[2:16:07.620 --> 2:16:15.620]  There is a bad thing in the water.
[2:16:15.620 --> 2:16:26.620]  The water you drink, the tap water, it is bad for you.
[2:16:26.620 --> 2:16:37.620]  It was put there to make you stupid and easy to control, to fool you.
[2:16:37.620 --> 2:16:47.620]  You have children, those little ones.
[2:16:47.620 --> 2:16:54.620]  Don't give them the tap water.
[2:16:54.620 --> 2:17:13.620]  At the grocery store, the water for babies and children has had fluoride put in it.
[2:17:13.620 --> 2:17:26.620]  By design, the studies by the scientists clearly show fluoride is more deadly
[2:17:26.620 --> 2:17:30.620]  and causes greater per capita.
[2:17:30.620 --> 2:17:34.620]  Hurts children worse.
[2:17:34.620 --> 2:17:39.620]  Don't hurt your baby.
[2:17:39.620 --> 2:17:42.620]  I am your friend.
[2:17:42.620 --> 2:17:49.620]  I get mad at you because you don't listen.
[2:17:49.620 --> 2:17:52.620]  Please.
[2:17:52.620 --> 2:17:54.620]  Paul would you like to talk to him the same way?
[2:17:54.620 --> 2:17:56.620]  Yeah, you need to.
[2:17:56.620 --> 2:17:57.620]  That's too fast.
[2:17:57.620 --> 2:17:58.620]  I'm not joking.
[2:17:58.620 --> 2:17:59.620]  It's slower.
[2:17:59.620 --> 2:18:01.620]  That's how politicians talk to us now.
[2:18:01.620 --> 2:18:02.620]  Go ahead.
[2:18:02.620 --> 2:18:13.620]  He is your friend, sodium fluoride, bad, MSG, bad, organic, good.
[2:18:13.620 --> 2:18:20.620]  But seriously, I saw the Saturday Night Entertainment, which was on the BBC.
[2:18:20.620 --> 2:18:25.620]  I obviously don't watch it, but my parents came around and they do.
[2:18:25.620 --> 2:18:27.620]  They drink their fluoride.
[2:18:27.620 --> 2:18:34.620]  And the Saturday Night Entertainment is either children's birthday party level
[2:18:34.620 --> 2:18:42.620]  or old people's senile home level, happy, clappy, karaoke thingalong entertainment.
[2:18:42.620 --> 2:18:44.620]  And it's shocking to me.
[2:18:44.620 --> 2:18:48.620]  It was absolutely shocking because I hadn't seen anything like that for years and years.
[2:18:48.620 --> 2:18:53.620]  But it's aimed at people who are getting dumber and the news has been dumbed down.
[2:18:53.620 --> 2:19:02.620]  Everything on television has been dumbed down to the point where it's almost like that film.
[2:19:02.620 --> 2:19:05.620]  What was it called by the guy who made...
[2:19:05.620 --> 2:19:06.620]  Idiocracy.
[2:19:06.620 --> 2:19:07.620]  Idiocracy.
[2:19:07.620 --> 2:19:12.620]  Where you have things like, you know, Owl My Balls and programs like that actually do
[2:19:12.620 --> 2:19:14.620]  exist now and they're being shown.
[2:19:14.620 --> 2:19:16.620]  Oh, that's nothing.
[2:19:16.620 --> 2:19:20.620]  In that video of the guy in Fayetteville, Arkansas, asking police whether there's a
[2:19:20.620 --> 2:19:25.620]  heartless checkpoint, they go, he knows how to talk.
[2:19:25.620 --> 2:19:27.620]  Take to jail.
[2:19:27.620 --> 2:19:31.620]  Paul Watson, thanks for the great job you're doing at prisonplanet.com and also
[2:19:31.620 --> 2:19:32.620]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:19:32.620 --> 2:19:35.620]  We're going to bring Jonathan Ellen off right now.
[2:19:35.620 --> 2:20:01.620]  Let's stay there, Paul.
[2:20:01.620 --> 2:20:05.620]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:20:05.620 --> 2:20:09.620]  Everyone has told me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:20:09.620 --> 2:20:10.620]  healthier I feel.
[2:20:10.620 --> 2:20:12.620]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:20:12.620 --> 2:20:17.620]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventive
[2:20:17.620 --> 2:20:38.620]  to keep their cardio vascular system healthy.
[2:20:38.620 --> 2:20:50.620]  Like any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this
[2:20:50.620 --> 2:20:51.620]  country.
[2:20:51.620 --> 2:20:52.620]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:20:52.620 --> 2:20:54.620]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:20:54.620 --> 2:20:58.620]  Fayetteville's enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[2:20:58.620 --> 2:21:01.620]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:21:01.620 --> 2:21:08.620]  U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:21:08.620 --> 2:21:09.620]  in and on the U.S.
[2:21:09.620 --> 2:21:11.620]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:11.620 --> 2:21:16.620]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:21:16.620 --> 2:21:20.620]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and
[2:21:20.620 --> 2:21:22.620]  much, much more, fabled enemies.
[2:21:22.620 --> 2:21:27.620]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other
[2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:30.620]  titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:21:30.620 --> 2:21:38.620]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:21:38.620 --> 2:21:42.620]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[2:21:42.620 --> 2:21:43.620]  dollar has been devaluating.
[2:21:43.620 --> 2:21:47.620]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[2:21:47.620 --> 2:21:50.620]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[2:21:50.620 --> 2:21:52.620]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[2:21:52.620 --> 2:21:55.620]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[2:21:55.620 --> 2:22:02.620]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them
[2:22:02.620 --> 2:22:07.620]  both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[2:22:07.620 --> 2:22:11.620]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[2:22:11.620 --> 2:22:13.620]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[2:22:13.620 --> 2:22:20.620]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[2:22:31.620 --> 2:22:37.620]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[2:22:37.620 --> 2:22:40.620]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[2:22:40.620 --> 2:22:46.620]  American Free Press, the only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[2:22:46.620 --> 2:22:51.620]  American Free Press, written by patriots, for patriots.
[2:22:51.620 --> 2:22:54.620]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[2:22:54.620 --> 2:22:57.620]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[2:22:57.620 --> 2:22:59.620]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[2:22:59.620 --> 2:23:02.620]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[2:23:02.620 --> 2:23:06.620]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists.
[2:23:06.620 --> 2:23:10.620]  And the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang head on.
[2:23:10.620 --> 2:23:14.620]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from American Free Press.

[2:23:23.620 --> 2:23:25.620]  It's just like it sounds.
[2:23:25.620 --> 2:23:28.620]  American Free Press, all one word, dot net.
[2:23:28.620 --> 2:23:32.620]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[2:23:32.620 --> 2:23:37.620]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[2:23:42.620 --> 2:23:47.620]  I knew I had seen this headline before.
[2:23:47.620 --> 2:23:51.620]  And I don't care that it's our story without credit.
[2:23:51.620 --> 2:23:53.620]  It's just interesting.
[2:23:53.620 --> 2:23:55.620]  George Washington blog, great blog.
[2:23:55.620 --> 2:24:00.620]  Advisor to Anthrax Investigations' attack was false flagged terror.
[2:24:00.620 --> 2:24:02.620]  You reported that over a year ago on this show.
[2:24:02.620 --> 2:24:06.620]  All places hustler published the transcript of the radio show.
[2:24:06.620 --> 2:24:07.620]  You can laugh at it.
[2:24:07.620 --> 2:24:10.620]  It's like the ninth largest magazine in the world.
[2:24:10.620 --> 2:24:15.620]  We all know that the bio weapons expert who actually drafted the current bio weapons law,
[2:24:15.620 --> 2:24:19.620]  Francis Boyle, has said that he has convinced the October 2000 attacks.
[2:24:19.620 --> 2:24:21.620]  I'm going to get him back on.
[2:24:21.620 --> 2:24:25.620]  The killed five people were perpetrated and covered by the criminal elements of the U.S. government.
[2:24:25.620 --> 2:24:35.620]  The motive was to foment a police state by killing off and intimidating opposition to the post 9-11 legislations of the Patriot Act and later military commissions act.
[2:24:35.620 --> 2:24:38.620]  And you click on it.
[2:24:38.620 --> 2:24:44.620]  And it's afterdowningstreet.org has the article.
[2:24:44.620 --> 2:24:49.620]  And it's Paul Watson's article.
[2:24:49.620 --> 2:24:50.620]  Not linking to us.
[2:24:50.620 --> 2:24:51.620]  I don't care.
[2:24:51.620 --> 2:24:52.620]  Fine. Have fun.
[2:24:52.620 --> 2:24:55.620]  Hey, in fact, if people want our news, you can just take our names off of it and use it.
[2:24:55.620 --> 2:24:56.620]  I don't care.
[2:24:56.620 --> 2:24:58.620]  As long as the information gets out to everybody, that's what matters.
[2:24:58.620 --> 2:25:00.620]  And that's what we're here for.
[2:25:00.620 --> 2:25:05.620]  The problem is, is I've had cases where people take our stories and others say we took it from them.
[2:25:05.620 --> 2:25:06.620]  It's kind of a reverse deal.
[2:25:06.620 --> 2:25:08.620]  So it's a little funny, but I'm glad that's out.
[2:25:08.620 --> 2:25:14.620]  Now, speaking on the anthrax story, Paul, and I'm going to go to Jonathan Elanoff.
[2:25:14.620 --> 2:25:16.620]  I mean, that's waking up the general public.
[2:25:16.620 --> 2:25:20.620]  Even the fluoride heads here in the U.S. are saying, yeah, that's crazy.
[2:25:20.620 --> 2:25:25.620]  They destroy the only samples they had so they could say it wasn't government anthrax.
[2:25:25.620 --> 2:25:27.620]  But all the experts that have looked at it say it is.
[2:25:27.620 --> 2:25:30.620]  And now they admit they have no evidence on this Ivan's guy.
[2:25:30.620 --> 2:25:31.620]  And then they covered everything up.
[2:25:31.620 --> 2:25:33.620]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[2:25:33.620 --> 2:25:40.620]  Well, yeah, a lot of people in this country woke up to there being a wider agenda behind that after they murdered Dr. David Kelly,
[2:25:40.620 --> 2:25:51.620]  which the evidence for his murder and his link to those same bioweapons programs was so obvious that it woke a lot of people up,
[2:25:51.620 --> 2:25:59.620]  as well as the fact that there have been dozens and dozens of top microbiologists around the world who have died in mysterious circumstances.
[2:25:59.620 --> 2:26:01.620]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[2:26:01.620 --> 2:26:06.620]  And now he dies in government hands, but the media buries that.
[2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:09.620]  I mean, they murdered him bottom line, folks, 98% chance.
[2:26:09.620 --> 2:26:12.620]  And what do you do when they're just such criminals?
[2:26:12.620 --> 2:26:13.620]  All right.
[2:26:13.620 --> 2:26:18.620]  Well, Paul, I know you're gearing up at PrismPlanet.tv for the release of fabled enemies.
[2:26:18.620 --> 2:26:20.620]  Fabled enemies will be out.
[2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:26.620]  Can't hint from my listeners really the evening of the 31st, but I get back from Colorado that day.
[2:26:26.620 --> 2:26:32.620]  So I'm going to be able to coordinate that, but in the evening or guaranteed on September 1st, fabled enemies, the new film,
[2:26:32.620 --> 2:26:38.620]  the anthrax attacks, the Israeli connection, the Pakistani connection, how it all ties together, the shadow government running the attacks,
[2:26:38.620 --> 2:26:42.620]  using operatives from Israel and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
[2:26:42.620 --> 2:26:46.620]  It is all there in the new film, Fable Enemy, son of a PrismPlanet.tv today.
[2:26:46.620 --> 2:26:50.620]  And what else do they get, Paul, when they sign up at PrismPlanet.tv?
[2:26:50.620 --> 2:26:58.620]  They get a live streaming video of the Alex Jones show every day. They get archives of that as well in multiple download formats.
[2:26:58.620 --> 2:27:02.620]  Every Alex Jones film in multiple download formats.
[2:27:02.620 --> 2:27:06.620]  The quality is getting better and better for each new release.
[2:27:06.620 --> 2:27:10.620]  We got streaming flash as well, so you don't have to sit there and wait for it to download.
[2:27:10.620 --> 2:27:12.620]  You can just play it straight away.
[2:27:12.620 --> 2:27:22.620]  And we launched it four years and four months ago for $5.95 a month, and it's still $5.95 a month.
[2:27:22.620 --> 2:27:24.620]  And you get three months free signing up for a year.
[2:27:24.620 --> 2:27:26.620]  Paul, thanks for the great work. Take care.
[2:27:26.620 --> 2:27:28.620]  All right. Thanks, Alex.
[2:27:28.620 --> 2:27:32.620]  You bet. I apologize for having Ellen off whole the last 10 minutes or so, but we got him on a bit late,
[2:27:32.620 --> 2:27:36.620]  and I wanted to keep Watson on for those other issues, bill with us for the rest of the hour.
[2:27:36.620 --> 2:27:40.620]  Jonathan's one of the most prolific we are changers out there, just like Luke Radowski.
[2:27:40.620 --> 2:27:46.620]  500-something members, I think he was telling me last week, and they're all over the place in Colorado taking action.
[2:27:46.620 --> 2:27:52.620]  He's gotten all over the Denver Post and international media exposing provocateur plans at the events.
[2:27:52.620 --> 2:27:56.620]  And what I got him on today about is the secret camp, new developments there,
[2:27:56.620 --> 2:28:00.620]  the fact that the police lied and said it didn't exist, and then we're proven wrong.
[2:28:00.620 --> 2:28:07.620]  But more importantly, we don't have a lot of time, but I've got this idea to not just have we are change, 500 members,
[2:28:07.620 --> 2:28:13.620]  and myself out there, but we need people covertly sitting back, videotaping provocateurs,
[2:28:13.620 --> 2:28:20.620]  videotaping the anarchist, following the anarchist home, and really exposing their government operatives.
[2:28:20.620 --> 2:28:25.620]  We've done this before, but we can really have a big victory here. Jonathan, what do you say?
[2:28:25.620 --> 2:28:30.620]  Absolutely. We've had meetings for like the past year planning for this.
[2:28:30.620 --> 2:28:35.620]  All of my members are prep ready. They've gone through training for this.
[2:28:35.620 --> 2:28:40.620]  We have hidden cams, pen cameras, tie cameras, button cams, pinhole cams, you name it.
[2:28:40.620 --> 2:28:48.620]  Plus, cameras on our back. We have four cameras that are going to be hooked up to laptops streaming live on the Internet,
[2:28:48.620 --> 2:28:53.620]  on WeAreChangeColorado.org, also on the We Are Change Hub site.
[2:28:53.620 --> 2:29:00.620]  And we have teams that are set up. We even give them walkie-talkies, because we're not sure if cell phones are going to be used.
[2:29:00.620 --> 2:29:06.620]  And they can be going around the BNC. There's three groups. Stay there. Stay there.
[2:29:06.620 --> 2:29:10.620]  And the mere fact, I'm glad you guys are doing this. See, great minds think alike.
[2:29:10.620 --> 2:29:15.620]  The mere fact that we're even announcing this, they may not launch false flags there.
[2:29:15.620 --> 2:29:18.620]  We've already caught them in a bunch of other places and made mainstream news.
[2:29:18.620 --> 2:29:21.620]  It's really hurting the criminal murderers of America.
[2:29:21.620 --> 2:29:25.620]  The criminal murderers of America are going to be brought to justice. We'll be right back.
[2:29:25.620 --> 2:29:35.620]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:38.620 --> 2:29:45.620]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:29:45.620 --> 2:29:48.620]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:29:48.620 --> 2:29:55.620]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was the stage. It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout commission, the CAF.
[2:30:04.620 --> 2:30:09.620]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:30:10.620 --> 2:30:14.620]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:30:14.620 --> 2:30:20.620]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:30:20.620 --> 2:30:23.620]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:30:23.620 --> 2:30:29.620]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[2:30:38.620 --> 2:30:41.620]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:30:41.620 --> 2:30:47.620]  First, I get the best parking space at work. Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[2:30:47.620 --> 2:30:50.620]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[2:30:50.620 --> 2:30:54.620]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[2:30:54.620 --> 2:31:00.620]  Online from my desk with WebEx. WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:31:00.620 --> 2:31:05.620]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[2:31:05.620 --> 2:31:09.620]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[2:31:09.620 --> 2:31:16.620]  Travel less. Meet online with WebEx for as little as $59 a month about the price of a tank of gas.

[2:31:19.620 --> 2:31:24.620]  WebEx from Cisco, used by more than 7 million people every month.

[2:31:38.620 --> 2:31:41.620]  Alabama State Code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[2:31:41.620 --> 2:31:45.620]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[2:31:45.620 --> 2:31:49.620]  In Minnesota, you can be fine for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[2:31:49.620 --> 2:31:54.620]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[2:31:54.620 --> 2:31:57.620]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.

[2:32:38.620 --> 2:33:02.620]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[2:33:02.620 --> 2:33:08.620]  We are Change Colorado. We have Wayne Madsen and the Wings. We double booked some guests.
[2:33:08.620 --> 2:33:10.620]  We're going to let Jonathan go here in a few minutes.
[2:33:10.620 --> 2:33:15.620]  But Jonathan, you've seen provoca turning, you've seen the local anarchists wanting to stir up trouble,
[2:33:15.620 --> 2:33:19.620]  you've stopped them, you've gone out to the little FEMA camp.
[2:33:19.620 --> 2:33:23.620]  I mean, you guys are really having a big effect and I salute you.
[2:33:23.620 --> 2:33:31.620]  Thank you, yes. I went into two of the core meetings out here of the groups I think that are going to be starting up most of the problems.
[2:33:31.620 --> 2:33:35.620]  And when I arrived, I had a hidden recorder.
[2:33:35.620 --> 2:33:38.620]  They weren't letting people videotape.
[2:33:38.620 --> 2:33:46.620]  And what was being discussed was property destruction, roadblocks, surrounding cars,
[2:33:46.620 --> 2:33:53.620]  disguising people's faces, shields, basically a complete nightmare.
[2:33:53.620 --> 2:34:01.620]  And that was months ago when I first wrote an article up on Truth Alliance about provoca turning at the DNC.
[2:34:01.620 --> 2:34:09.620]  And from there, the entire Denver community just split and it became open, which up until that point was quiet.
[2:34:09.620 --> 2:34:12.620]  It was being kept secret. It was being kept under wraps.
[2:34:12.620 --> 2:34:18.620]  And we broke that out and got people talking about it, educated them about provocateurs, handed out martial laws,
[2:34:18.620 --> 2:34:21.620]  educated people about inforce.
[2:34:21.620 --> 2:34:29.620]  Tons of people found out who you were and it just created this huge war, basically, in the activist community out here.
[2:34:29.620 --> 2:34:36.620]  And we ended up getting a lot of members and two of the groups basically broke up, but they're still going to be down there.
[2:34:36.620 --> 2:34:41.620]  This Sunday, as a matter of fact, is the end the occupations rally in Denver,
[2:34:41.620 --> 2:34:47.620]  which is the one we're really concerned about because they don't have a permit for it, the groups that are doing it.
[2:34:47.620 --> 2:34:51.620]  They've been asked to stop. They're continuing to do this demonstration.
[2:34:51.620 --> 2:34:56.620]  They're going to continue marching onto the Pepsi Center and this is before the DNC even starts.
[2:34:56.620 --> 2:35:04.620]  And so we've got members that are going to be at our park with us, but most of our members want to be in the crowd,
[2:35:04.620 --> 2:35:10.620]  videotaping it on the ground because they really, really, really think the stuff is not going to go down.
[2:35:10.620 --> 2:35:13.620]  And you've got all the details on your websites. Give people the websites.
[2:35:13.620 --> 2:35:19.620]  Yes, we are changed. Colorado.org. They can find out everything we're setting up for the DNC.
[2:35:19.620 --> 2:35:25.620]  They can go there and sign up. We need money. We need help. We need supplies.
[2:35:25.620 --> 2:35:29.620]  We're trying to get signs. We're trying to get big models set up.
[2:35:29.620 --> 2:35:34.620]  And we also have all the information about the streaming video there.
[2:35:34.620 --> 2:35:41.620]  And we also are going to be showing Truth Rising here in Denver the week of the DNC.
[2:35:41.620 --> 2:35:47.620]  Tickets are on sale there as well. So we're going to try to really, really have a large 9-11 Truth presence.
[2:35:47.620 --> 2:35:50.620]  We're inviting everyone to come out and join us and stand with us.
[2:35:50.620 --> 2:35:55.620]  I know Willie Nelson is going to be in town. I know a lot of artists are going to be in town,
[2:35:55.620 --> 2:36:00.620]  Raging Info Machine is here at Dead Press. And many of these people are Truthers.
[2:36:00.620 --> 2:36:03.620]  So they invite us to everybody. We have no idea who's going to come.
[2:36:03.620 --> 2:36:08.620]  We don't know who knows about what we're doing, but we know it's a large event here in Denver
[2:36:08.620 --> 2:36:11.620]  and there's a lot of people here and many of them are Truthers.
[2:36:11.620 --> 2:36:14.620]  Well, I'm going to be there in an RV out at your park.
[2:36:14.620 --> 2:36:19.620]  And I'm going to be getting there Sunday afternoon. And we're going to talk to you again on Friday.
[2:36:19.620 --> 2:36:22.620]  I'm going to have you on longer. But Jonathan, we'll talk to you then. Thank you.
[2:36:22.620 --> 2:36:24.620]  Absolutely. No problem.
[2:36:24.620 --> 2:36:28.620]  You better take care. Okay. Going to Wayne Madsen now.
[2:36:28.620 --> 2:36:32.620]  The NSA security officer. We should just kill these people.
[2:36:32.620 --> 2:36:34.620]  And I don't think Wayne Madsen makes things up.
[2:36:34.620 --> 2:36:39.620]  And he's got a lot of good sources, put a lot of good information in the past.
[2:36:39.620 --> 2:36:44.620]  And he's saying he now has this information from a good source.
[2:36:44.620 --> 2:36:49.620]  And not surprisingly, his name is on the list. He didn't give out the entire list.
[2:36:49.620 --> 2:36:51.620]  He said there were more on the list.
[2:36:51.620 --> 2:36:53.620]  Wayne, what is going on?
[2:36:53.620 --> 2:36:58.620]  Well, this is a story I was covering for a couple of years now.
[2:36:58.620 --> 2:37:05.620]  I discovered back in 2005 that there was a database maintained by NSA
[2:37:05.620 --> 2:37:09.620]  that had the code name FirstFruits.
[2:37:09.620 --> 2:37:12.620]  Your phone's really breaking up. I want you to start over.
[2:37:12.620 --> 2:37:17.620]  NSA database, FirstFruits. You obviously worked with the NSA before. Go ahead.
[2:37:17.620 --> 2:37:21.620]  Right. It was called FirstFruits. And it was a database that...
[2:37:21.620 --> 2:37:25.620]  Originally, it was a database that contained a newspaper article
[2:37:25.620 --> 2:37:31.620]  written by individuals who were writing about NSA, signals intelligence,
[2:37:31.620 --> 2:37:37.620]  communications intelligence, but apparently it's expanded since O5
[2:37:37.620 --> 2:37:42.620]  to now include signals intelligence intercepts, wiretaps of journalists' phones
[2:37:42.620 --> 2:37:46.620]  to find out who their sources are, who they're talking to.
[2:37:46.620 --> 2:37:51.620]  So this has become quite a surveillance-oriented database from its original intention,
[2:37:51.620 --> 2:37:56.620]  appeared to be nothing more than a classified clipping service.
[2:37:56.620 --> 2:37:59.620]  Well, let's say hi to those listening.
[2:37:59.620 --> 2:38:02.620]  They're violating federal, international, common-sense law.
[2:38:02.620 --> 2:38:06.620]  You're enabling a criminal government, a criminal media to continue its activity.
[2:38:06.620 --> 2:38:09.620]  And I don't care if the criminals above you say it's okay.
[2:38:09.620 --> 2:38:11.620]  What you're doing is wrong.
[2:38:11.620 --> 2:38:13.620]  Wayne Madsen, what do you want to say to those listening right now?
[2:38:13.620 --> 2:38:18.620]  Well, I think everyone should realize that journalists
[2:38:18.620 --> 2:38:23.620]  who have been investigative journalists have never had it easy in Washington.
[2:38:23.620 --> 2:38:28.620]  As a matter of fact, Jack Anderson, there was a plot being discussed
[2:38:28.620 --> 2:38:31.620]  back during the Nixon White House by Gordon Lindy.
[2:38:31.620 --> 2:38:33.620]  They were talking about killing Jack Anderson.
[2:38:33.620 --> 2:38:37.620]  But I mean, either they were serious or not,
[2:38:37.620 --> 2:38:40.620]  and who knows if Lindy probably was.
[2:38:40.620 --> 2:38:42.620]  But it looks like we're back to the future
[2:38:42.620 --> 2:38:46.620]  because I understand that there was a discussion
[2:38:46.620 --> 2:38:51.620]  when this database was first revealed in an article I wrote.
[2:38:51.620 --> 2:38:52.620]  No, fine.
[2:38:52.620 --> 2:38:56.620]  Someone in NSA Security just globally stated,
[2:38:56.620 --> 2:38:59.620]  why don't we just kill these guys?
[2:38:59.620 --> 2:39:02.620]  And for that kind of, those kinds of individuals,
[2:39:02.620 --> 2:39:05.620]  we work in an agency like that, I think,
[2:39:05.620 --> 2:39:09.620]  as rather chilling to say the least.
[2:39:09.620 --> 2:39:12.620]  And I heard my name was in there,
[2:39:12.620 --> 2:39:17.620]  so the usual people you could imagine are the usual suspects
[2:39:17.620 --> 2:39:22.620]  for them, Psyhurst, Jim Bamford, Jim Ryzen,
[2:39:22.620 --> 2:39:26.620]  who is facing a grand jury investigation right now
[2:39:26.620 --> 2:39:31.620]  for leaking information about the warrantless wiretask being conducted
[2:39:31.620 --> 2:39:33.620]  by NSA and the FBI.
[2:39:33.620 --> 2:39:37.620]  So it's obvious that Bush administration doesn't want anything else there.
[2:39:37.620 --> 2:39:39.620]  You leak that they're committing crimes,
[2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:42.620]  and then they criminally come after you for trying to stop crime.
[2:39:42.620 --> 2:39:44.620]  That's essentially what they're doing.
[2:39:44.620 --> 2:39:46.620]  The database itself is illegal,
[2:39:46.620 --> 2:39:51.620]  and they're trying to say that anyone who leaked that information
[2:39:51.620 --> 2:39:54.620]  has committed a national security offense.
[2:39:54.620 --> 2:39:59.620]  I understand that the level of the investigation of the leak
[2:39:59.620 --> 2:40:03.620]  is being called espionage and treason,
[2:40:03.620 --> 2:40:06.620]  and I looked up in the Federal Census and Guidelines
[2:40:06.620 --> 2:40:10.620]  that the maximum penalty for treason and espionage
[2:40:10.620 --> 2:40:13.620]  is that it's a death penalty.
[2:40:13.620 --> 2:40:15.620]  That's high treason.
[2:40:15.620 --> 2:40:19.620]  Now, isn't it high treason to be spying illegally on the American people
[2:40:19.620 --> 2:40:23.620]  for political control to block their free speech and First Amendment?
[2:40:23.620 --> 2:40:25.620]  Why are we doing that, though?
[2:40:25.620 --> 2:40:27.620]  They are the tyrants, they're the traitors,
[2:40:27.620 --> 2:40:29.620]  they're the people who are destroying America,
[2:40:29.620 --> 2:40:32.620]  and you know, all they can do is hire a crud now,
[2:40:32.620 --> 2:40:36.620]  hire these bully boys, I ran into them bad in Chantilly,
[2:40:36.620 --> 2:40:40.620]  covering Bilderberg, and I mean, they would come right up and threaten you.
[2:40:40.620 --> 2:40:49.620]  These people are real thugs.
[2:40:49.620 --> 2:40:51.620]  I've always faced a lot of pressure
[2:40:51.620 --> 2:40:54.620]  in doing the kind of writing and investigating that I do,
[2:40:54.620 --> 2:40:58.620]  but to just hear somebody say,
[2:40:58.620 --> 2:41:00.620]  why don't we just kill these guys?
[2:41:00.620 --> 2:41:04.620]  Well, in fact, there have been many journals killed by our side in Iraq
[2:41:04.620 --> 2:41:06.620]  and in Afghanistan and other places.
[2:41:06.620 --> 2:41:08.620]  Well, let's talk about that, but let me stop you, Wayne Madsen.
[2:41:08.620 --> 2:41:11.620]  You've seen No Way Out with Kevin Costner, right?
[2:41:11.620 --> 2:41:13.620]  Oh, absolutely. A long time ago.
[2:41:13.620 --> 2:41:15.620]  Remember when he's saying, who are these gentlemen
[2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:19.620]  and they're saying men that formerly associated with special forces in the suits?
[2:41:19.620 --> 2:41:21.620]  You know, like 45 years old,
[2:41:21.620 --> 2:41:24.620]  that is exactly what the guys in Virginia look like.
[2:41:24.620 --> 2:41:27.620]  I mean, it was like out of central casting.
[2:41:27.620 --> 2:41:31.620]  Well, I also remember the movie, there was a movie,
[2:41:31.620 --> 2:41:36.620]  I think it had Robert Redford in it about NSA
[2:41:36.620 --> 2:41:40.620]  and there were some NSA agents going around killing people,
[2:41:40.620 --> 2:41:43.620]  and it was, of course, enemy of the state, which was the same thing.
[2:41:43.620 --> 2:41:46.620]  And having worked in NSA, I said, oh, come on, you know,
[2:41:46.620 --> 2:41:49.620]  having worked there, I know they don't have people to go around and kill people.
[2:41:49.620 --> 2:41:51.620]  Well, let me just change that now,
[2:41:51.620 --> 2:41:54.620]  because for what I understand now, there are people,
[2:41:54.620 --> 2:41:57.620]  there's one individual who worked there who entertained the notion
[2:41:57.620 --> 2:42:00.620]  of killing the journalists who were on their database.
[2:42:00.620 --> 2:42:02.620]  Now, you don't make, I mean, again, Wayne,
[2:42:02.620 --> 2:42:04.620]  you're a very credible source, you've been reporting on these security issues
[2:42:04.620 --> 2:42:06.620]  that you got out of the NSA and consulting for others.
[2:42:06.620 --> 2:42:09.620]  I mean, I've all the time watching Capitol Hill videos
[2:42:09.620 --> 2:42:11.620]  and there you are in the background, you know, with your dope ad.
[2:42:11.620 --> 2:42:13.620]  Why are they so mad at you?
[2:42:13.620 --> 2:42:16.620]  I mean, obviously, Cy Hirsch, they want to know who in the White House knows,
[2:42:16.620 --> 2:42:20.620]  you know, and reported that Dick Cheney was planning to blow up Navy ships
[2:42:20.620 --> 2:42:22.620]  two months ago and blame it on Iran.
[2:42:22.620 --> 2:42:24.620]  I mean, obviously, that's why they're so upset.
[2:42:24.620 --> 2:42:28.620]  And I know you don't want to give away your moat,
[2:42:28.620 --> 2:42:30.620]  you know, your ways of doing things,
[2:42:30.620 --> 2:42:32.620]  but it's certainly not just going to the park and meeting with them
[2:42:32.620 --> 2:42:34.620]  like they did back in the 60s.
[2:42:34.620 --> 2:42:36.620]  How are you guys still getting your information
[2:42:36.620 --> 2:42:38.620]  when you're constantly being followed?
[2:42:38.620 --> 2:42:40.620]  Well, now it's very, very difficult,
[2:42:40.620 --> 2:42:44.620]  because of the technology that we have.
[2:42:44.620 --> 2:42:48.620]  I have conversations with sources where we just,
[2:42:48.620 --> 2:42:50.620]  it's agreed, batteries out,
[2:42:50.620 --> 2:42:52.620]  the battery comes out of the cell phone.
[2:42:52.620 --> 2:42:56.620]  When that happens, it can't be used as a transmitting device,
[2:42:56.620 --> 2:42:58.620]  but also the GPS is disabled,
[2:42:58.620 --> 2:43:00.620]  so it can't be used as a tracking device.
[2:43:00.620 --> 2:43:05.620]  So, you know, and, yeah, the lengths to which I'm going now
[2:43:05.620 --> 2:43:08.620]  to meet with people are much different than what,
[2:43:08.620 --> 2:43:10.620]  you know, the precautions I used to take.
[2:43:10.620 --> 2:43:16.620]  I will stagger my travel and, you know,
[2:43:16.620 --> 2:43:18.620]  in the event that I'm being followed,
[2:43:18.620 --> 2:43:21.620]  which I have to assume is probably taking place.
[2:43:21.620 --> 2:43:23.620]  Well, we talked to Sai Harsha a week and a half ago,
[2:43:23.620 --> 2:43:25.620]  and he said he's coming on when he breaks something big
[2:43:25.620 --> 2:43:27.620]  in early fall, but he told us,
[2:43:27.620 --> 2:43:29.620]  I don't want to go into too much detail.
[2:43:29.620 --> 2:43:31.620]  He didn't say don't tell it, but the point is,
[2:43:31.620 --> 2:43:34.620]  he says he's having to literally slither around
[2:43:34.620 --> 2:43:36.620]  and sneak around to meet his sources now,
[2:43:36.620 --> 2:43:38.620]  constantly being followed.
[2:43:38.620 --> 2:43:43.620]  Well, I can emphasize and sympathize with him,
[2:43:43.620 --> 2:43:46.620]  because that's exactly what I have to do myself.
[2:43:46.620 --> 2:43:51.620]  There's, you know, and obviously the people
[2:43:51.620 --> 2:43:54.620]  in the Bush administration are trying to find out
[2:43:54.620 --> 2:43:58.620]  who's talking about these illegal surveillance tactics,
[2:43:58.620 --> 2:44:01.620]  and they'll go to no end.
[2:44:01.620 --> 2:44:05.620]  There was one individual in NSA who wrote a report
[2:44:05.620 --> 2:44:07.620]  that Saddam had no WMDs,
[2:44:07.620 --> 2:44:09.620]  and he trumped up charges against him
[2:44:09.620 --> 2:44:12.620]  playing a classified document in his house,
[2:44:12.620 --> 2:44:15.620]  and he's serving a six-year prison term
[2:44:15.620 --> 2:44:18.620]  up in Lewisburg Federal Prison in Pennsylvania.
[2:44:18.620 --> 2:44:21.620]  The guy's innocent, but it doesn't matter.
[2:44:21.620 --> 2:44:23.620]  This is what they're prepared to do,
[2:44:23.620 --> 2:44:27.620]  to send a message to anyone who's thinking about
[2:44:27.620 --> 2:44:29.620]  disagreeing with this administration.
[2:44:29.620 --> 2:44:32.620]  It's the most fuggish administration I've ever seen.
[2:44:32.620 --> 2:44:35.620]  These guys make Richard Nixon look like Snow White.
[2:44:35.620 --> 2:44:37.620]  Well, let's come out in the mainstream media
[2:44:37.620 --> 2:44:39.620]  about one of the top generals
[2:44:39.620 --> 2:44:41.620]  got in the car with a two-star general
[2:44:41.620 --> 2:44:43.620]  investigating Abu Ghraib and said,
[2:44:43.620 --> 2:44:45.620]  basically, we're going to get you, boy.
[2:44:45.620 --> 2:44:47.620]  And then, you know, he said at that time,
[2:44:47.620 --> 2:44:49.620]  he realized that this was not a military,
[2:44:49.620 --> 2:44:52.620]  this was a mafia, and the White House just brags
[2:44:52.620 --> 2:44:55.620]  that they don't just make donations to people's countries.
[2:44:55.620 --> 2:44:58.620]  They pay people off and pay leaders off,
[2:44:58.620 --> 2:45:01.620]  and now I've learned that all over the country,
[2:45:01.620 --> 2:45:04.620]  they are paying off mayors and county commissioners
[2:45:04.620 --> 2:45:07.620]  and sheriffs and police chiefs with millions in cash apiece.
[2:45:07.620 --> 2:45:09.620]  And I confirmed this back in the late 90s,
[2:45:09.620 --> 2:45:11.620]  but now it's widespread.
[2:45:11.620 --> 2:45:13.620]  These people aren't playing games, man.
[2:45:13.620 --> 2:45:17.620]  This is a completely criminal rogue government.
[2:45:17.620 --> 2:45:19.620]  Well, the other thing that I'm picking up,
[2:45:19.620 --> 2:45:23.620]  also, is the fact that with this surveillance technology,
[2:45:23.620 --> 2:45:26.620]  warrantless wiretaps, it's quite apparent
[2:45:26.620 --> 2:45:28.620]  that our members of Congress, one of the reasons
[2:45:28.620 --> 2:45:31.620]  they've been extremely silent on impeachment
[2:45:31.620 --> 2:45:33.620]  and bringing this administration to justice
[2:45:33.620 --> 2:45:35.620]  is because they're doing blackmail.
[2:45:35.620 --> 2:45:38.620]  Some of their phone calls have been listening
[2:45:38.620 --> 2:45:42.620]  and then whispering campaigns have been launched by these people,
[2:45:42.620 --> 2:45:46.620]  and it's obviously these whispering campaigns
[2:45:46.620 --> 2:45:49.620]  are launched against those who are their political enemies
[2:45:49.620 --> 2:45:51.620]  as a way to neutralize them.
[2:45:51.620 --> 2:45:54.620]  Six months ago, it was reported that every member of the parliament
[2:45:54.620 --> 2:45:58.620]  is being spied on by the, quote, MI6 Queens branch,
[2:45:58.620 --> 2:46:02.620]  where you just have the military-industrial vested interest
[2:46:02.620 --> 2:46:04.620]  that is not just waging war on the people,
[2:46:04.620 --> 2:46:07.620]  but also the legitimate government.
[2:46:07.620 --> 2:46:09.620]  That's literally, you know, this...
[2:46:09.620 --> 2:46:14.620]  And from what I gather, you know, there was a Bible in NSA
[2:46:14.620 --> 2:46:18.620]  after the abuses of the 60s and 70s.
[2:46:18.620 --> 2:46:22.620]  It's called United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18.
[2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:23.620]  You said 18.
[2:46:23.620 --> 2:46:25.620]  People can find it on the internet.
[2:46:25.620 --> 2:46:26.620]  There's excerpts.
[2:46:26.620 --> 2:46:28.620]  It was classified, but there's excerpts.
[2:46:28.620 --> 2:46:30.620]  But it basically says, it always said,
[2:46:30.620 --> 2:46:32.620]  look, this is what you can do.
[2:46:32.620 --> 2:46:36.620]  This is what you can't do anytime you run across a U.S. person
[2:46:36.620 --> 2:46:38.620]  to reject the NSA surveillance.
[2:46:38.620 --> 2:46:41.620]  You've got to minimize that, which means the name has to be removed.
[2:46:41.620 --> 2:46:45.620]  Well, I get the impression from people I speak to.
[2:46:45.620 --> 2:46:47.620]  I'm not cleared anymore.
[2:46:47.620 --> 2:46:48.620]  I'm not there.
[2:46:48.620 --> 2:46:50.620]  I don't know, but I've talked about people to know
[2:46:50.620 --> 2:46:54.620]  that that U18 has basically been torn up and shredded.
[2:46:54.620 --> 2:47:01.620]  There are no control checks on the surveillance being conducted by NSA.
[2:47:01.620 --> 2:47:05.620]  And a lot of this happened under the regime of General Michael Hayden,
[2:47:05.620 --> 2:47:07.620]  who is now the CIA director.
[2:47:07.620 --> 2:47:13.620]  So because of what he did at NSA and his violations of the law,
[2:47:13.620 --> 2:47:16.620]  he has been promoted to the CIA director.
[2:47:16.620 --> 2:47:22.620]  So he's been rewarded quite nicely for what he did for this administration.
[2:47:22.620 --> 2:47:25.620]  Let's talk about the compartmentalization,
[2:47:25.620 --> 2:47:27.620]  which I know a lot of even the employees in NSA
[2:47:27.620 --> 2:47:29.620]  and National Reconnaissance Office
[2:47:29.620 --> 2:47:31.620]  and the 15 other big ones that we know of,
[2:47:31.620 --> 2:47:36.620]  and now the private ones that they have go dial into the systems and spy
[2:47:36.620 --> 2:47:38.620]  and then send that to higher ups.
[2:47:38.620 --> 2:47:41.620]  They're using contractors for that more and more.
[2:47:41.620 --> 2:47:43.620]  I've seen some estimates that more than half is now
[2:47:43.620 --> 2:47:47.620]  private contractors gathering intelligence and making up intelligence
[2:47:47.620 --> 2:47:50.620]  that they then stovepipe in or cherry-pick in.
[2:47:50.620 --> 2:47:53.620]  But the average person in NSA would say,
[2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:56.620]  has the job of listening to my phone calls, which we know they do,
[2:47:56.620 --> 2:48:00.620]  and listening to your phone calls because they want to know who's calling.
[2:48:00.620 --> 2:48:03.620]  Do they know they're traitor criminals or are they just trying to get their pension?
[2:48:03.620 --> 2:48:06.620]  They're scared. They've seen other people murdered.
[2:48:06.620 --> 2:48:11.620]  They are scared to death because what has happened with these security departments
[2:48:11.620 --> 2:48:13.620]  and divisions within these intelligence agencies
[2:48:13.620 --> 2:48:17.620]  is that these security groups are acting like the Stasi.
[2:48:17.620 --> 2:48:22.620]  In other words, those who are conducting the surveillance are also being surveilled.
[2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:27.620]  So you've got a really East Germany-type situation here.
[2:48:27.620 --> 2:48:32.620]  Even if they say they don't want to do what they're doing,
[2:48:32.620 --> 2:48:35.620]  well, they dare not say anything or complain about it
[2:48:35.620 --> 2:48:40.620]  because they're going to find themselves that subject to an investigation.
[2:48:40.620 --> 2:48:43.620]  And it's not pretty when they get called.
[2:48:43.620 --> 2:48:46.620]  They throw all kinds of charges at you.
[2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:51.620]  It's very similar to the scene in the first Matrix movie
[2:48:51.620 --> 2:48:54.620]  where Nioh's there and the guy saying,
[2:48:54.620 --> 2:48:59.620]  well, we know you help your linen lady out with the trash and you pay your taxes,
[2:48:59.620 --> 2:49:02.620]  but we also know who you've been dealing with.
[2:49:02.620 --> 2:49:05.620]  So this is what's going on.
[2:49:05.620 --> 2:49:12.620]  And it's an incredibly morale-rolling situation within these agencies
[2:49:12.620 --> 2:49:16.620]  for these intelligence professionals to have to work in.
[2:49:16.620 --> 2:49:18.620]  Well, that's where I was going next,
[2:49:18.620 --> 2:49:20.620]  but isn't that part of the method of the madness?
[2:49:20.620 --> 2:49:25.620]  They'll run out the good people and they can roll in the hunchback gorillas.
[2:49:25.620 --> 2:49:26.620]  Yeah.
[2:49:26.620 --> 2:49:31.620]  Yeah, maybe the good people either went out or they were tired.
[2:49:31.620 --> 2:49:34.620]  And they know they see the abuses.
[2:49:34.620 --> 2:49:36.620]  Even once they're out, they're afraid to talk
[2:49:36.620 --> 2:49:40.620]  because they know they could be sanctioned.
[2:49:40.620 --> 2:49:44.620]  And these political U.S. attorneys have no problem
[2:49:44.620 --> 2:49:49.620]  with trumping up charges against dissidents
[2:49:49.620 --> 2:49:52.620]  and then they'll do some judge shopping
[2:49:52.620 --> 2:49:57.620]  and find a judge who will go along with whatever they plan to do.
[2:49:57.620 --> 2:50:02.620]  What's that movie, the true story about the East German spying on people
[2:50:02.620 --> 2:50:05.620]  and he stops doing it and then they basically shell him
[2:50:05.620 --> 2:50:07.620]  and then kill some other people?
[2:50:07.620 --> 2:50:08.620]  Exactly.
[2:50:08.620 --> 2:50:09.620]  I forget the name of that movie.
[2:50:09.620 --> 2:50:10.620]  It's a very good movie.
[2:50:10.620 --> 2:50:14.620]  Yeah, but it showed how East Germany was a total surveillance society.
[2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:19.620]  And at least in that case, they had a high-ranking person
[2:50:19.620 --> 2:50:23.620]  and they basically helped out the dissidents.
[2:50:23.620 --> 2:50:26.620]  And I think we have those people here too,
[2:50:26.620 --> 2:50:29.620]  but we're in a very similar situation in East Germany
[2:50:29.620 --> 2:50:30.620]  when it comes to that type of thing.
[2:50:30.620 --> 2:50:31.620]  Stay there, Wayne Madsen.
[2:50:31.620 --> 2:50:34.620]  This is riveting power pack info.
[2:50:34.620 --> 2:50:35.620]  Folks, they want to kill us.
[2:50:35.620 --> 2:50:36.620]  Stay with us.
[2:50:38.620 --> 2:50:41.620]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[2:50:41.620 --> 2:50:43.620]  Matthew 24 states four times,
[2:50:43.620 --> 2:50:45.620]  in the last days, many will be deceived.
[2:50:45.620 --> 2:50:49.620]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[2:50:49.620 --> 2:50:52.620]  What do you know about the beast, its mark and the antichrist?
[2:50:52.620 --> 2:50:56.620]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[2:50:56.620 --> 2:51:01.620]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card or 666?
[2:51:01.620 --> 2:51:04.620]  Is the antichrist a person, title or both?
[2:51:04.620 --> 2:51:06.620]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[2:51:06.620 --> 2:51:08.620]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[2:51:08.620 --> 2:51:12.620]  First John states, the antichrist is already in the world.
[2:51:12.620 --> 2:51:14.620]  What is the truth and what is a lie?
[2:51:14.620 --> 2:51:16.620]  Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[2:51:16.620 --> 2:51:18.620]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[2:51:18.620 --> 2:51:21.620]  For free books, DVDs and Bible studies,
[2:51:21.620 --> 2:51:24.620]  exposing the antichrist, the beast and its mark,
[2:51:24.620 --> 2:51:25.620]  right to the Bible says,
[2:51:25.620 --> 2:51:28.620]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee,
[2:51:28.620 --> 2:51:34.620]  37771, or call 888-211-1715.
[2:51:34.620 --> 2:51:37.620]  That's 888-211-1715.
[2:51:37.620 --> 2:51:41.620]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[2:51:41.620 --> 2:51:45.620]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:51:45.620 --> 2:51:47.620]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[2:51:47.620 --> 2:51:49.620]  But who is the enemy?
[2:51:49.620 --> 2:51:50.620]  Bin Laden.
[2:51:50.620 --> 2:51:51.620]  This is his MO.
[2:51:51.620 --> 2:51:52.620]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:51:52.620 --> 2:51:54.620]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:51:54.620 --> 2:51:57.620]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[2:51:57.620 --> 2:51:59.620]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[2:51:59.620 --> 2:52:01.620]  inside the United States.
[2:52:01.620 --> 2:52:04.620]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again,
[2:52:04.620 --> 2:52:08.620]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:52:08.620 --> 2:52:12.620]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:12.620 --> 2:52:14.620]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[2:52:14.620 --> 2:52:16.620]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[2:52:16.620 --> 2:52:17.620]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:17.620 --> 2:52:19.620]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:52:19.620 --> 2:52:20.620]  warnings in war games,
[2:52:20.620 --> 2:52:21.620]  the shadow government,
[2:52:21.620 --> 2:52:22.620]  and much, much more.

[2:53:56.620 --> 2:53:59.620]  Rogue government
[2:53:59.620 --> 2:54:01.620]  is the only way to describe it.
[2:54:01.620 --> 2:54:04.620]  Completely hijacked by foreign interest.
[2:54:04.620 --> 2:54:06.620]  I have to say, Wayne Madsen, the Democrats,
[2:54:06.620 --> 2:54:08.620]  as Keith Overman said,
[2:54:08.620 --> 2:54:10.620]  are going to go along with every bit of this,
[2:54:10.620 --> 2:54:13.620]  cheer-leaded, Barack Obama.
[2:54:13.620 --> 2:54:16.620]  I mean, do you see George Bush,
[2:54:16.620 --> 2:54:19.620]  Mr., this would be much better if it was a dictatorship,
[2:54:19.620 --> 2:54:20.620]  leaving office,
[2:54:20.620 --> 2:54:22.620]  and then what do you see happening with the election?
[2:54:22.620 --> 2:54:24.620]  Well, I think they're going to...
[2:54:24.620 --> 2:54:27.620]  I'm the one guy I'm worried about is Dick Cheney, of course.
[2:54:27.620 --> 2:54:31.620]  And what I'm concerned about is if the Democrats come in,
[2:54:31.620 --> 2:54:33.620]  and there's this feeling like,
[2:54:33.620 --> 2:54:35.620]  well, we want to look to the future.
[2:54:35.620 --> 2:54:37.620]  Let's not go over the past.
[2:54:37.620 --> 2:54:40.620]  And that means all these criminals are going to get away with,
[2:54:40.620 --> 2:54:42.620]  literally, with murder.
[2:54:42.620 --> 2:54:45.620]  I think there's got to be something that came to a truth
[2:54:45.620 --> 2:54:47.620]  and reconciliation commission.
[2:54:47.620 --> 2:54:49.620]  More the truth and the reconciliation with these guys,
[2:54:49.620 --> 2:54:51.620]  because I do feel they've committed treason,
[2:54:51.620 --> 2:54:54.620]  and I think they should be held accountable.
[2:54:54.620 --> 2:54:58.620]  I think that we should try to resist efforts
[2:54:58.620 --> 2:55:00.620]  by the Democrats to try to say,
[2:55:00.620 --> 2:55:04.620]  well, we don't want to go over these old stalls
[2:55:04.620 --> 2:55:07.620]  and look at the past eight years.
[2:55:07.620 --> 2:55:10.620]  I think it's actually necessary to look at the past eight years,
[2:55:10.620 --> 2:55:13.620]  or otherwise, the Obama administration is going to have
[2:55:13.620 --> 2:55:15.620]  a very tough four years ahead of it.
[2:55:15.620 --> 2:55:17.620]  Well, Wayne Living in Maryland,
[2:55:17.620 --> 2:55:19.620]  being in and around these people working with them,
[2:55:19.620 --> 2:55:21.620]  the ideologues,
[2:55:21.620 --> 2:55:24.620]  the gung-ho, I'm fighting for America.
[2:55:24.620 --> 2:55:27.620]  I've got to kill American citizens and spy on them
[2:55:27.620 --> 2:55:31.620]  and be evil to protect America from the godless cretins.
[2:55:31.620 --> 2:55:34.620]  It doesn't seem there's as many of those now in the administration
[2:55:34.620 --> 2:55:37.620]  as there are just pirates, mercenaries,
[2:55:37.620 --> 2:55:39.620]  just guys that don't care.
[2:55:39.620 --> 2:55:43.620]  I mean, what's it made up of with their core operatives?
[2:55:43.620 --> 2:55:45.620]  Well, I'll tell you what we see now.
[2:55:45.620 --> 2:55:48.620]  We do see a mass exodus to the political parties,
[2:55:48.620 --> 2:55:51.620]  especially in Justice Department,
[2:55:51.620 --> 2:55:54.620]  because we're all trying to land a nice job.
[2:55:54.620 --> 2:55:57.620]  They know their time is limited.
[2:55:57.620 --> 2:56:00.620]  What that's doing in the Justice Department
[2:56:00.620 --> 2:56:03.620]  is that some of the career attorneys,
[2:56:03.620 --> 2:56:07.620]  the career prosecutors are now getting some authority
[2:56:07.620 --> 2:56:11.620]  that they've not had since Bush came into town,
[2:56:11.620 --> 2:56:14.620]  and we see a little bit of movement there
[2:56:14.620 --> 2:56:17.620]  like the prosecution of Ted Stevens.
[2:56:17.620 --> 2:56:19.620]  This quote from Alaska.
[2:56:19.620 --> 2:56:21.620]  I'm not sure that would have happened
[2:56:21.620 --> 2:56:24.620]  deep within the Bush administration.
[2:56:24.620 --> 2:56:26.620]  We see a little bit more of this movement now
[2:56:26.620 --> 2:56:30.620]  because the clear guys are starting to become acting
[2:56:30.620 --> 2:56:33.620]  at least what normally would be political appointment jobs.
[2:56:33.620 --> 2:56:35.620]  And for those that don't know,
[2:56:35.620 --> 2:56:38.620]  Ted Stevens was just robbing and stealing in front of everyone.
[2:56:38.620 --> 2:56:40.620]  He wasn't even hiding it.
[2:56:40.620 --> 2:56:43.620]  He was robbing the bank with the jewels dripping behind him.
[2:56:43.620 --> 2:56:47.620]  And the other thing is that Secretary of Defense Gates,
[2:56:47.620 --> 2:56:52.620]  I think, deserves some credit because he has basically fired
[2:56:52.620 --> 2:56:54.620]  the entire Air Force leadership,
[2:56:54.620 --> 2:56:57.620]  including suspending the Air Force Cyber Command,
[2:56:57.620 --> 2:57:00.620]  which I had reported earlier this year,
[2:57:00.620 --> 2:57:03.620]  was the ultimate chain of command for Dick Cheney
[2:57:03.620 --> 2:57:05.620]  to start moving nuclear weapons around,
[2:57:05.620 --> 2:57:07.620]  including those six MOOCs.
[2:57:07.620 --> 2:57:10.620]  He authorized the movement out of North Dakota.
[2:57:10.620 --> 2:57:17.620]  So the evil but more restrained James Baker, George Schultz types
[2:57:17.620 --> 2:57:20.620]  are actually hacking up some neocontentacles?
[2:57:20.620 --> 2:57:22.620]  Well, definitely Gates is.
[2:57:22.620 --> 2:57:24.620]  And I know Gates is basically, you know,
[2:57:24.620 --> 2:57:27.620]  an old man Bush's guy within this administration
[2:57:27.620 --> 2:57:31.620]  to provide some adult supervision for the boy.
[2:57:31.620 --> 2:57:34.620]  And Gates has put his own people now,
[2:57:34.620 --> 2:57:38.620]  at least people who are loyal to him in charge of the Air Force.
[2:57:38.620 --> 2:57:41.620]  So I think we can breathe a little bit easier about that
[2:57:41.620 --> 2:57:42.620]  over the chain of command.
[2:57:42.620 --> 2:57:44.620]  That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
[2:57:44.620 --> 2:57:47.620]  It's just had its wings clipped a bit.
[2:57:47.620 --> 2:57:49.620]  Wayne, I want to come back in a final segment with you
[2:57:49.620 --> 2:57:51.620]  and talk about WayneMatsonReport.com
[2:57:51.620 --> 2:57:53.620]  and what you're doing there, your great material,
[2:57:53.620 --> 2:57:56.620]  how folks can get involved with that.
[2:57:56.620 --> 2:57:59.620]  And also the D.C. Maddam, some kind of closing chapters
[2:57:59.620 --> 2:58:02.620]  in that and the Carnegie situation.
[2:58:02.620 --> 2:58:04.620]  Five minutes left with our guests.
[2:58:04.620 --> 2:58:06.620]  Then we've got Professor Peter Del Scott
[2:58:06.620 --> 2:58:08.620]  on the Russia situation,
[2:58:08.620 --> 2:58:09.620]  government narcotics trafficking,
[2:58:09.620 --> 2:58:12.620]  the police state, death squad, secret camps.
[2:58:12.620 --> 2:58:16.620]  He is quite a fount of knowledge when we're talking to him.
[2:58:20.620 --> 2:58:22.620]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:59:48.620 --> 2:59:51.620]  Live on PrismPlanet.tv with a video feed
[2:59:51.620 --> 2:59:53.620]  out of my studio.
[2:59:53.620 --> 2:59:56.620]  Live in the document camp.
[2:59:56.620 --> 2:59:58.620]  And a lot more for PrismPlanet.tv members.
[2:59:58.620 --> 3:00:04.620]  WayneMatsonReport.com is our guest.
[3:00:04.620 --> 3:00:06.620]  Just finishing up briefly,
[3:00:06.620 --> 3:00:08.620]  NSA security officer,
[3:00:08.620 --> 3:00:10.620]  we should just kill these people.
[3:00:10.620 --> 3:00:12.620]  And this is being picked up
[3:00:12.620 --> 3:00:15.620]  and reported by Richard Voller at OpEd News.
[3:00:15.620 --> 3:00:17.620]  But you're confirming that indeed
[3:00:17.620 --> 3:00:19.620]  you've gotten this from your sources.
[3:00:19.620 --> 3:00:21.620]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:00:21.620 --> 3:00:26.620]  And I wasn't the only one on the list.
[3:00:26.620 --> 3:00:29.620]  Certainly other names mentioned were Sy Hirsch,
[3:00:29.620 --> 3:00:33.620]  Jim Bamford, Jim Reisen of the New York Times.
[3:00:33.620 --> 3:00:35.620]  And this was 05.
[3:00:35.620 --> 3:00:38.620]  I have to assume that this list has been added to,
[3:00:38.620 --> 3:00:41.620]  especially with people like Ron Suskin,
[3:00:41.620 --> 3:00:45.620]  whose book about Cheney is out now,
[3:00:45.620 --> 3:00:47.620]  and people like Tom Ricks,
[3:00:47.620 --> 3:00:52.620]  all those people who had sources about how foolish
[3:00:52.620 --> 3:00:54.620]  this administration was with Iraq
[3:00:54.620 --> 3:00:57.620]  and how foolish they may be soon with Iran
[3:00:57.620 --> 3:00:59.620]  and these other issues.
[3:00:59.620 --> 3:01:02.620]  What do you think of their little Russian foray?
[3:01:02.620 --> 3:01:04.620]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[3:01:04.620 --> 3:01:08.620]  I mean, here we have this regime in Georgia
[3:01:08.620 --> 3:01:10.620]  installed by George Soros,
[3:01:10.620 --> 3:01:16.620]  which has neocons all throughout this Georgian government.
[3:01:16.620 --> 3:01:19.620]  And you know, talk about poking the Russian bear
[3:01:19.620 --> 3:01:22.620]  and now they're upset because the bear used its claw
[3:01:22.620 --> 3:01:24.620]  to swipe them back.
[3:01:24.620 --> 3:01:26.620]  I think it's incredible.
[3:01:26.620 --> 3:01:28.620]  Yeah, they ran up to a grizzly bear
[3:01:28.620 --> 3:01:30.620]  and jammed an ice pick in its rear end,
[3:01:30.620 --> 3:01:32.620]  and it just simply swatted them off
[3:01:32.620 --> 3:01:34.620]  and they're whining and belly aching.
[3:01:34.620 --> 3:01:36.620]  It's just unbelievable.
[3:01:36.620 --> 3:01:37.620]  The DC Madame,
[3:01:37.620 --> 3:01:39.620]  Geraldo sent me back up for the show
[3:01:39.620 --> 3:01:41.620]  and then canceled me while I was about to go live.
[3:01:41.620 --> 3:01:43.620]  They killed that.
[3:01:43.620 --> 3:01:45.620]  I've had detectives calling me.
[3:01:45.620 --> 3:01:47.620]  It's come out that her lawyer says that she said
[3:01:47.620 --> 3:01:49.620]  she wanted all her material to come out of.
[3:01:49.620 --> 3:01:51.620]  They said she was suicide and she told me
[3:01:51.620 --> 3:01:53.620]  if she was ever suicide, it would be murder.
[3:01:53.620 --> 3:01:55.620]  She told everybody this.
[3:01:55.620 --> 3:01:56.620]  She told you that.
[3:01:56.620 --> 3:01:58.620]  And then magically some crime reporter
[3:01:58.620 --> 3:02:01.620]  she never talked to says that she said she was
[3:02:01.620 --> 3:02:02.620]  in hindsight.
[3:02:02.620 --> 3:02:04.620]  What happened there?
[3:02:04.620 --> 3:02:06.620]  Well, I don't believe...
[3:02:06.620 --> 3:02:08.620]  First of all, I know how much
[3:02:08.620 --> 3:02:11.620]  she was worried about her elderly mother
[3:02:11.620 --> 3:02:13.620]  who had a heart condition.
[3:02:13.620 --> 3:02:15.620]  I just don't think she would have put her
[3:02:15.620 --> 3:02:17.620]  in a position of having to find her body
[3:02:17.620 --> 3:02:19.620]  hanging there.
[3:02:19.620 --> 3:02:21.620]  Where she was found hanging from
[3:02:21.620 --> 3:02:25.620]  it was one of these cathedral-type roofs.
[3:02:25.620 --> 3:02:27.620]  She wasn't told enough
[3:02:27.620 --> 3:02:29.620]  to reach that center beam.
[3:02:29.620 --> 3:02:31.620]  So obviously she would have had to have
[3:02:31.620 --> 3:02:33.620]  some assistance and I believe she did have
[3:02:33.620 --> 3:02:35.620]  some assistance.
[3:02:35.620 --> 3:02:37.620]  And they did that even to be mean to her mother.
[3:02:37.620 --> 3:02:39.620]  She told the condo guy,
[3:02:39.620 --> 3:02:40.620]  I'm paying six months ahead.
[3:02:40.620 --> 3:02:42.620]  I'll be out in a few years.
[3:02:42.620 --> 3:02:43.620]  I'm going to fight this.
[3:02:43.620 --> 3:02:44.620]  I'm going to write a big book.
[3:02:44.620 --> 3:02:45.620]  And they're like, no, you're not.
[3:02:45.620 --> 3:02:47.620]  I wish she had just let out all the names
[3:02:47.620 --> 3:02:48.620]  and they wouldn't have killed her
[3:02:48.620 --> 3:02:49.620]  like Jennifer Flowers did.
[3:02:49.620 --> 3:02:50.620]  But she didn't.
[3:02:50.620 --> 3:02:52.620]  They killed her dead in a hammer.
[3:02:52.620 --> 3:02:53.620]  Right, right.
[3:02:53.620 --> 3:02:56.620]  But I think if there are some papers
[3:02:56.620 --> 3:02:58.620]  I've just spoken to an attorney also
[3:02:58.620 --> 3:03:00.620]  and I know there's a book in the works
[3:03:00.620 --> 3:03:01.620]  from him.
[3:03:01.620 --> 3:03:03.620]  So he's also taking very extreme
[3:03:03.620 --> 3:03:05.620]  precautions with his own safety.
[3:03:05.620 --> 3:03:07.620]  He needs to not wait for the book.
[3:03:07.620 --> 3:03:10.620]  He needs to release that right now.
[3:03:10.620 --> 3:03:12.620]  Well, I agree.
[3:03:12.620 --> 3:03:15.620]  But I guess it's one of those things
[3:03:15.620 --> 3:03:17.620]  where I'll try to struggle to stay
[3:03:17.620 --> 3:03:18.620]  afloat financially.
[3:03:18.620 --> 3:03:20.620]  But I think I have been told
[3:03:20.620 --> 3:03:22.620]  that when it comes out it's going to have
[3:03:22.620 --> 3:03:25.620]  some amazing revelations in it.
[3:03:25.620 --> 3:03:27.620]  Well, yeah, maybe after they're gone.
[3:03:27.620 --> 3:03:29.620]  But, you know, that's like jumping into
[3:03:29.620 --> 3:03:31.620]  the water with 50 bowling balls tied
[3:03:31.620 --> 3:03:32.620]  to your legs.
[3:03:32.620 --> 3:03:34.620]  I mean, the guy is, he's got to let out
[3:03:34.620 --> 3:03:36.620]  the key info and then say a book's coming
[3:03:36.620 --> 3:03:37.620]  out later.
[3:03:37.620 --> 3:03:38.620]  I mean, I know you know that.
[3:03:38.620 --> 3:03:39.620]  I don't think these people realize,
[3:03:39.620 --> 3:03:41.620]  I mean, his client's been murdered.
[3:03:41.620 --> 3:03:43.620]  Do they realize how dangerous this is?
[3:03:43.620 --> 3:03:46.620]  I, you know, I absolutely, I'm just
[3:03:46.620 --> 3:03:48.620]  seeing on the wire now of the
[3:03:48.620 --> 3:03:50.620]  Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones
[3:03:50.620 --> 3:03:52.620]  from Ohio did so much in trying to
[3:03:52.620 --> 3:03:53.620]  get to the bottom of the election
[3:03:53.620 --> 3:03:55.620]  fraud in 2004.
[3:03:55.620 --> 3:03:57.620]  And her state is that now suffered
[3:03:57.620 --> 3:03:59.620]  an aneurysm and she's in critical
[3:03:59.620 --> 3:04:01.620]  condition in a Cleveland hospital.
[3:04:01.620 --> 3:04:04.620]  So, you know, the police said they
[3:04:04.620 --> 3:04:06.620]  stopped her because she was driving
[3:04:06.620 --> 3:04:07.620]  her radically.
[3:04:07.620 --> 3:04:09.620]  So, you've got to wonder, you've got
[3:04:09.620 --> 3:04:11.620]  to wonder about the kinds of things
[3:04:11.620 --> 3:04:12.620]  in the kind of society we're in.
[3:04:12.620 --> 3:04:14.620]  And in Carnaby where the police
[3:04:14.620 --> 3:04:16.620]  gun him down in broad daylight.
[3:04:16.620 --> 3:04:18.620]  Exactly, and that one's not over
[3:04:18.620 --> 3:04:19.620]  by any stretch.
[3:04:19.620 --> 3:04:21.620]  So, there's a lot more, I think,
[3:04:21.620 --> 3:04:23.620]  that's going to come out on that one.
[3:04:23.620 --> 3:04:25.620]  Well, Wayne Madsen, I want to talk
[3:04:25.620 --> 3:04:26.620]  to you again in the near future
[3:04:26.620 --> 3:04:28.620]  with the WayneMadsenReport.com,
[3:04:28.620 --> 3:04:29.620]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[3:04:29.620 --> 3:04:31.620]  Thank you so much, sir.
[3:04:31.620 --> 3:04:32.620]  Glad to be right here.
[3:04:32.620 --> 3:04:33.620]  You bet.
[3:04:33.620 --> 3:04:34.620]  We'll be right back with
[3:04:34.620 --> 3:04:36.620]  Peter Dale Scott. Stay with us.
[3:04:38.620 --> 3:04:40.620]  Here I am at a gathering of friends
[3:04:40.620 --> 3:04:41.620]  minding my own business.
[3:04:41.620 --> 3:04:42.620]  When one of our buddies, Bob,
[3:04:42.620 --> 3:04:44.620]  walks up to me, very concerned,
[3:04:44.620 --> 3:04:46.620]  he says, wow, have you seen the
[3:04:46.620 --> 3:04:47.620]  gasoline crisis lately?
[3:04:47.620 --> 3:04:48.620]  I said, oh, of course.
[3:04:48.620 --> 3:04:49.620]  Woo, they're high.
[3:04:49.620 --> 3:04:50.620]  He says, yeah, he says, what am I
[3:04:50.620 --> 3:04:51.620]  going to do?
[3:04:51.620 --> 3:04:52.620]  I've got a truck.
[3:04:52.620 --> 3:04:53.620]  There's no waiting.
[3:04:53.620 --> 3:04:54.620]  Anyway, he's going to buy my
[3:04:54.620 --> 3:04:55.620]  truck in this market.
[3:04:55.620 --> 3:04:56.620]  I really need the truck for my
[3:04:56.620 --> 3:04:57.620]  job.
[3:04:57.620 --> 3:04:58.620]  It uses more gas than I can
[3:04:58.620 --> 3:04:59.620]  afford.
[3:04:59.620 --> 3:05:00.620]  I've got to find a way to come
[3:05:00.620 --> 3:05:01.620]  up with some extra money.
[3:05:01.620 --> 3:05:02.620]  I've got a wife with four kids
[3:05:02.620 --> 3:05:03.620]  at home.
[3:05:03.620 --> 3:05:04.620]  I don't know what to do.
[3:05:04.620 --> 3:05:05.620]  I said, Bob, relax.
[3:05:05.620 --> 3:05:06.620]  I know what to do.
[3:05:06.620 --> 3:05:08.620]  Call efoodsdirect.com
[3:05:08.620 --> 3:05:09.620]  or go up on the web at
[3:05:09.620 --> 3:05:10.620]  efoodsdirect.com.
[3:05:10.620 --> 3:05:12.620]  They will deliver food, really
[3:05:12.620 --> 3:05:13.620]  good, high-quality, nutritional,
[3:05:13.620 --> 3:05:15.620]  delicious food to your door,
[3:05:15.620 --> 3:05:17.620]  your door now, right there
[3:05:17.620 --> 3:05:18.620]  in front of your house,
[3:05:18.620 --> 3:05:19.620]  for about half the price
[3:05:19.620 --> 3:05:20.620]  that you were paying for
[3:05:20.620 --> 3:05:21.620]  groceries last year.
[3:05:21.620 --> 3:05:22.620]  You can take the savings from
[3:05:22.620 --> 3:05:23.620]  that offset the cost of your
[3:05:23.620 --> 3:05:25.620]  fuel and use it to buy more
[3:05:25.620 --> 3:05:26.620]  inexpensive food to hedge
[3:05:26.620 --> 3:05:27.620]  against tomorrow's
[3:05:27.620 --> 3:05:28.620]  increasing food prices.
[3:05:28.620 --> 3:05:29.620]  Why don't you do that,
[3:05:29.620 --> 3:05:30.620]  Bob?
[3:05:30.620 --> 3:05:31.620]  He said, efoodsdirect.com.
[3:05:31.620 --> 3:05:32.620]  I said, yep.
[3:05:32.620 --> 3:05:33.620]  Call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[3:05:33.620 --> 3:05:34.620]  That's 800-409-5633.
[3:05:34.620 --> 3:05:35.620]  Do it now.
[3:05:35.620 --> 3:05:37.620]  More than 700 chemicals have
[3:05:37.620 --> 3:05:38.620]  been found in our drinking
[3:05:38.620 --> 3:05:39.620]  water.
[3:05:39.620 --> 3:05:40.620]  And did you know that you have
[3:05:40.620 --> 3:05:41.620]  greater exposure to these
[3:05:41.620 --> 3:05:42.620]  chemicals while taking hot
[3:05:42.620 --> 3:05:43.620]  showers than when drinking the
[3:05:43.620 --> 3:05:44.620]  water?
[3:05:44.620 --> 3:05:45.620]  That's because many chemicals
[3:05:45.620 --> 3:05:46.620]  are inhaled when they evaporate
[3:05:46.620 --> 3:05:47.620]  and others are inhaled.
[3:05:47.620 --> 3:05:48.620]  That's because many chemicals
[3:05:48.620 --> 3:05:51.620]  are inhaled when they evaporate
[3:05:51.620 --> 3:05:52.620]  and others are absorbed into
[3:05:52.620 --> 3:05:53.620]  the skin.
[3:05:53.620 --> 3:05:54.620]  The KDF Dual Media Shower
[3:05:54.620 --> 3:05:55.620]  Filter works with both hot and
[3:05:55.620 --> 3:05:57.620]  cold water and is designed to
[3:05:57.620 --> 3:05:59.620]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury
[3:05:59.620 --> 3:06:00.620]  and iron, and it inhibits the
[3:06:00.620 --> 3:06:02.620]  growth of bacteria, mold, algae
[3:06:02.620 --> 3:06:04.620]  and fungus.
[3:06:04.620 --> 3:06:05.620]  The KDF Dual Media Shower
[3:06:05.620 --> 3:06:07.620]  Filter typically lasts 10,000
[3:06:07.620 --> 3:06:08.620]  gallons or one year,
[3:06:08.620 --> 3:06:09.620]  whichever comes first.
[3:06:09.620 --> 3:06:10.620]  Hospitals, restaurants and
[3:06:10.620 --> 3:06:11.620]  water treatment facilities use
[3:06:11.620 --> 3:06:13.620]  this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:06:13.620 --> 3:06:14.620]  iron, heavy metals and
[3:06:14.620 --> 3:06:15.620]  bacteria.
[3:06:15.620 --> 3:06:16.620]  What about you?
[3:06:16.620 --> 3:06:18.620]  Order your KDF Shower Filter
[3:06:18.620 --> 3:06:20.620]  normally, $49 for our special
[3:06:20.620 --> 3:06:22.620]  price of only $39.99 with free
[3:06:22.620 --> 3:06:23.620]  shipping.
[3:06:23.620 --> 3:06:24.620]  Call the Berkey Guy and order
[3:06:24.620 --> 3:06:28.620]  now by calling 1-877-886-3653.

[3:06:37.620 --> 3:06:39.620]  Today, unlike any other in the
[3:06:39.620 --> 3:06:41.620]  long course of American history,
[3:06:41.620 --> 3:06:43.620]  a terrorist act of war against
[3:06:43.620 --> 3:06:44.620]  this country.
[3:06:44.620 --> 3:06:46.620]  The enemy struck America on
[3:06:46.620 --> 3:06:47.620]  September 11th.
[3:06:47.620 --> 3:06:48.620]  But who is the enemy?
[3:06:48.620 --> 3:06:49.620]  bin Laden.
[3:06:49.620 --> 3:06:50.620]  This is his MO.
[3:06:50.620 --> 3:06:51.620]  We have to look to the
[3:06:51.620 --> 3:06:52.620]  Middle East.
[3:06:52.620 --> 3:06:53.620]  We have to look to Osama bin
[3:06:53.620 --> 3:06:54.620]  Laden.
[3:06:54.620 --> 3:06:55.620]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11
[3:06:55.620 --> 3:06:57.620]  film to take a close look at the
[3:06:57.620 --> 3:06:58.620]  terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:06:58.620 --> 3:07:00.620]  networks inside the United
[3:07:00.620 --> 3:07:01.620]  States.
[3:07:01.620 --> 3:07:02.620]  Some U.S. investigators believe
[3:07:02.620 --> 3:07:03.620]  that there are Israelis again
[3:07:03.620 --> 3:07:05.620]  very much engaged in spying in
[3:07:05.620 --> 3:07:07.620]  and on the U.S.
[3:07:07.620 --> 3:07:09.620]  I'm aware that some Israeli
[3:07:09.620 --> 3:07:11.620]  citizens have been detained.
[3:07:11.620 --> 3:07:12.620]  Bin Laden's connections to the
[3:07:12.620 --> 3:07:14.620]  CIA, the hijackers ties to the
[3:07:14.620 --> 3:07:16.620]  FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[3:07:16.620 --> 3:07:17.620]  connection, the Israeli
[3:07:17.620 --> 3:07:18.620]  Intelligence Network,
[3:07:18.620 --> 3:07:19.620]  warnings and war games, the
[3:07:19.620 --> 3:07:21.620]  shadow government, and much,
[3:07:21.620 --> 3:07:22.620]  much more.
[3:07:22.620 --> 3:07:23.620]  Fabled enemies.

[3:07:25.620 --> 3:07:27.620]  or see it in super high quality

[3:07:28.620 --> 3:07:50.620]  titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:08:05.620 --> 3:08:06.620]  Well, for the rest of this
[3:08:06.620 --> 3:08:08.620]  hour, we're joined by professor,
[3:08:08.620 --> 3:08:09.620]  author Peter Dale Scott.
[3:08:09.620 --> 3:08:11.620]  Always enjoy interviewing him
[3:08:11.620 --> 3:08:13.620]  over the last 12 years or so
[3:08:13.620 --> 3:08:14.620]  that I've had a chance to have
[3:08:14.620 --> 3:08:15.620]  him on a couple of times a
[3:08:15.620 --> 3:08:16.620]  year.
[3:08:16.620 --> 3:08:18.620]  And Peter Dale Scott is a
[3:08:18.620 --> 3:08:19.620]  Canadian poet and former
[3:08:19.620 --> 3:08:20.620]  English professor at the
[3:08:20.620 --> 3:08:22.620]  University of California,
[3:08:22.620 --> 3:08:23.620]  Berkeley.
[3:08:23.620 --> 3:08:26.620]  And he has been an advisor to
[3:08:26.620 --> 3:08:28.620]  the United States.
[3:08:28.620 --> 3:08:29.620]  I mean, the bio is so long, it
[3:08:29.620 --> 3:08:30.620]  would take hours.
[3:08:30.620 --> 3:08:31.620]  And I go over all of his
[3:08:31.620 --> 3:08:32.620]  literary works, his
[3:08:32.620 --> 3:08:33.620]  investigations, and the
[3:08:33.620 --> 3:08:35.620]  government drug trafficking
[3:08:35.620 --> 3:08:36.620]  into the deep state, you know,
[3:08:36.620 --> 3:08:38.620]  the shadow government, the
[3:08:38.620 --> 3:08:40.620]  true ruling elite.
[3:08:40.620 --> 3:08:42.620]  He has got a new book out
[3:08:42.620 --> 3:08:44.620]  right now, always out there on
[3:08:44.620 --> 3:08:46.620]  the forefront of research.
[3:08:46.620 --> 3:08:48.620]  And today, I wanted to get his
[3:08:48.620 --> 3:08:49.620]  take on the Russia situation
[3:08:49.620 --> 3:08:51.620]  briefly, who the true shadow
[3:08:51.620 --> 3:08:52.620]  government is, who the deep
[3:08:52.620 --> 3:08:54.620]  state is, past Barack Obama,
[3:08:54.620 --> 3:08:56.620]  John McCain, George Bush, and
[3:08:56.620 --> 3:08:57.620]  the neocons.
[3:08:57.620 --> 3:08:58.620]  Because we see this police
[3:08:58.620 --> 3:09:00.620]  state control grid, the spying
[3:09:00.620 --> 3:09:02.620]  apparatus on citizens just
[3:09:02.620 --> 3:09:04.620]  growing, expanding decade after
[3:09:04.620 --> 3:09:06.620]  decade, year after year, now
[3:09:06.620 --> 3:09:08.620]  really coming to a climax, it
[3:09:08.620 --> 3:09:10.620]  seems, and what the deep state
[3:09:10.620 --> 3:09:12.620]  wants, where it's going, and
[3:09:12.620 --> 3:09:14.620]  ways to stop it.
[3:09:14.620 --> 3:09:15.620]  And so I'm very honored to have
[3:09:15.620 --> 3:09:17.620]  Peter Dale Scott on with us.
[3:09:17.620 --> 3:09:18.620]  Peter Dale Scott, why don't
[3:09:18.620 --> 3:09:19.620]  you tell the listeners your
[3:09:19.620 --> 3:09:21.620]  own bio, what you think is
[3:09:21.620 --> 3:09:22.620]  most important for listeners
[3:09:22.620 --> 3:09:23.620]  that don't know who you are
[3:09:23.620 --> 3:09:25.620]  instead of me, just, you know,
[3:09:25.620 --> 3:09:27.620]  picking and choosing what to
[3:09:27.620 --> 3:09:28.620]  talk about.
[3:09:28.620 --> 3:09:29.620]  Well, first of all, I want to
[3:09:29.620 --> 3:09:31.620]  say I'm pleased and honored to
[3:09:31.620 --> 3:09:33.620]  be back on your show.
[3:09:33.620 --> 3:09:35.620]  And I guess what I want people
[3:09:35.620 --> 3:09:37.620]  to know most is that in the last
[3:09:37.620 --> 3:09:39.620]  two years, I've come out with
[3:09:39.620 --> 3:09:41.620]  not one, but two new books, one
[3:09:41.620 --> 3:09:43.620]  called The Road to 9-Eleven,
[3:09:43.620 --> 3:09:45.620]  and the other one, a vastly
[3:09:45.620 --> 3:09:47.620]  expanded reissue of my
[3:09:47.620 --> 3:09:49.620]  first book, The War
[3:09:49.620 --> 3:09:51.620]  Conspiracy, and rather than
[3:09:51.620 --> 3:09:53.620]  subscribing at length, people
[3:09:53.620 --> 3:09:55.620]  can just Google for me, and at
[3:09:55.620 --> 3:09:57.620]  the very top, they'll see
[3:09:57.620 --> 3:09:59.620]  Google for Peter Dale Scott.
[3:09:59.620 --> 3:10:01.620]  You'll see my website, which is
[3:10:01.620 --> 3:10:05.620]  www.peterdalescott.net,
[3:10:05.620 --> 3:10:07.620]  and I have a politics page on
[3:10:07.620 --> 3:10:08.620]  there that begins with
[3:10:08.620 --> 3:10:10.620]  description of these two books.
[3:10:10.620 --> 3:10:12.620]  So thank you for giving me a
[3:10:12.620 --> 3:10:14.620]  chance to work all that in.
[3:10:14.620 --> 3:10:15.620]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:10:15.620 --> 3:10:17.620]  Let's get into currently what's
[3:10:17.620 --> 3:10:18.620]  happening.
[3:10:18.620 --> 3:10:19.620]  Just a basic synopsis from your
[3:10:19.620 --> 3:10:21.620]  perspective, and whether you
[3:10:21.620 --> 3:10:23.620]  think the elite is in crisis, or
[3:10:23.620 --> 3:10:24.620]  whether things are going well
[3:10:24.620 --> 3:10:25.620]  for them, and then who that
[3:10:25.620 --> 3:10:27.620]  deep state is, who the shadow
[3:10:27.620 --> 3:10:29.620]  government are, who controls it,
[3:10:29.620 --> 3:10:31.620]  where we're going, what their
[3:10:31.620 --> 3:10:32.620]  goals are.
[3:10:32.620 --> 3:10:34.620]  Well, because it is a deep
[3:10:34.620 --> 3:10:36.620]  state in the shadow government,
[3:10:36.620 --> 3:10:38.620]  I'm very much on the outside
[3:10:38.620 --> 3:10:40.620]  and just trying to
[3:10:40.620 --> 3:10:42.620]  put together clues.
[3:10:42.620 --> 3:10:44.620]  But I think that
[3:10:44.620 --> 3:10:46.620]  in a sense we've had one
[3:10:46.620 --> 3:10:48.620]  since World War II,
[3:10:48.620 --> 3:10:50.620]  and particularly the
[3:10:50.620 --> 3:10:52.620]  decision, you know, there was a
[3:10:52.620 --> 3:10:54.620]  kind of mood of panic right
[3:10:54.620 --> 3:10:55.620]  after World War II about the
[3:10:55.620 --> 3:10:57.620]  Russians, and I remember it.
[3:10:57.620 --> 3:10:59.620]  I didn't, as a Canadian, I
[3:10:59.620 --> 3:11:01.620]  didn't really participate in it,
[3:11:01.620 --> 3:11:03.620]  but I remember friends
[3:11:03.620 --> 3:11:05.620]  whom I respected who were
[3:11:05.620 --> 3:11:07.620]  sincere in their fear that if
[3:11:07.620 --> 3:11:09.620]  America didn't fight to dominate
[3:11:09.620 --> 3:11:11.620]  the world, then Russia would,
[3:11:11.620 --> 3:11:13.620]  the Soviet Union would take it
[3:11:13.620 --> 3:11:14.620]  over.
[3:11:14.620 --> 3:11:15.620]  And then they built that tool to
[3:11:15.620 --> 3:11:17.620]  quote, save us, and it
[3:11:17.620 --> 3:11:19.620]  inevitably turned into the right
[3:11:19.620 --> 3:11:20.620]  tyranny.
[3:11:20.620 --> 3:11:22.620]  Well, what they did specifically,
[3:11:22.620 --> 3:11:24.620]  I mean, I'm trying to be
[3:11:24.620 --> 3:11:26.620]  hard-edged and narrow in my
[3:11:26.620 --> 3:11:28.620]  facts here, they created this
[3:11:28.620 --> 3:11:30.620]  special adjunct to the, well,
[3:11:30.620 --> 3:11:32.620]  they created the Central
[3:11:32.620 --> 3:11:34.620]  Intelligence Agency for one
[3:11:34.620 --> 3:11:36.620]  thing, but then they went beyond
[3:11:36.620 --> 3:11:38.620]  that, at least the CIA was
[3:11:38.620 --> 3:11:40.620]  created by a statute, although
[3:11:40.620 --> 3:11:42.620]  the powers that now exercises
[3:11:42.620 --> 3:11:44.620]  were not envisaged in that
[3:11:44.620 --> 3:11:46.620]  statute, but when they went
[3:11:46.620 --> 3:11:48.620]  further and created something
[3:11:48.620 --> 3:11:50.620]  called OPC, the Office of
[3:11:50.620 --> 3:11:52.620]  Policy Coordination, such an
[3:11:52.620 --> 3:11:54.620]  innocent title, but in
[3:11:54.620 --> 3:11:56.620]  fact a very heavy agency
[3:11:56.620 --> 3:11:58.620]  whose
[3:11:58.620 --> 3:12:00.620]  function was defined
[3:12:00.620 --> 3:12:02.620]  as the subversion of other
[3:12:02.620 --> 3:12:03.620]  governments.
[3:12:03.620 --> 3:12:05.620]  Well, if you create an apparatus
[3:12:05.620 --> 3:12:07.620]  that's very skilled at subverting
[3:12:07.620 --> 3:12:09.620]  other governments, it's not at all
[3:12:09.620 --> 3:12:11.620]  surprising if you get some blowback
[3:12:11.620 --> 3:12:13.620]  and that one of the governments
[3:12:13.620 --> 3:12:15.620]  that's being subverted is our own.
[3:12:15.620 --> 3:12:17.620]  What I refer to as the deep state
[3:12:17.620 --> 3:12:19.620]  is the, its
[3:12:19.620 --> 3:12:21.620]  origins are in
[3:12:21.620 --> 3:12:23.620]  that it was actually a huge
[3:12:23.620 --> 3:12:25.620]  apparatus at one point larger
[3:12:25.620 --> 3:12:27.620]  than the CIA, and eventually
[3:12:27.620 --> 3:12:29.620]  was creating many, many
[3:12:29.620 --> 3:12:31.620]  problems for America.
[3:12:31.620 --> 3:12:33.620]  And then it simply became
[3:12:33.620 --> 3:12:35.620]  continuity of government. I know I'm
[3:12:35.620 --> 3:12:37.620]  oversimplifying it, and now that's...
[3:12:37.620 --> 3:12:39.620]  You're jumping a bit, but yes,
[3:12:39.620 --> 3:12:41.620]  to shorten the whole narrative,
[3:12:41.620 --> 3:12:42.620]  you began...
[3:12:42.620 --> 3:12:44.620]  Well, I don't want to shorten it,
[3:12:44.620 --> 3:12:45.620]  but...
[3:12:45.620 --> 3:12:47.620]  No, no, that was a good thing you said that.
[3:12:47.620 --> 3:12:49.620]  In the 40s, it was OPC,
[3:12:49.620 --> 3:12:51.620]  and in the, in our decade
[3:12:51.620 --> 3:12:53.620]  at COG, we've gone
[3:12:53.620 --> 3:12:55.620]  from one set of misleading
[3:12:55.620 --> 3:12:57.620]  initials to another, because continuity
[3:12:57.620 --> 3:12:59.620]  of government, as I always
[3:12:59.620 --> 3:13:01.620]  say, if you know, if
[3:13:01.620 --> 3:13:03.620]  you're planning for COG involves
[3:13:03.620 --> 3:13:05.620]  suspending the Constitution, well,
[3:13:05.620 --> 3:13:07.620]  then it's better to call it change your
[3:13:07.620 --> 3:13:09.620]  government than continuity of government.
[3:13:09.620 --> 3:13:11.620]  And then we
[3:13:11.620 --> 3:13:13.620]  look at who's involved bringing
[3:13:13.620 --> 3:13:15.620]  robotics in, who's involved staging
[3:13:15.620 --> 3:13:17.620]  terror attacks, who's involved paying off
[3:13:17.620 --> 3:13:19.620]  local police chiefs.
[3:13:19.620 --> 3:13:20.620]  Let's zoom in.
[3:13:20.620 --> 3:13:22.620]  Can I pick up on what you just
[3:13:22.620 --> 3:13:24.620]  said, that one of
[3:13:24.620 --> 3:13:26.620]  the real elements of continuity
[3:13:26.620 --> 3:13:28.620]  through all of this is
[3:13:28.620 --> 3:13:30.620]  the fact that OPC
[3:13:30.620 --> 3:13:32.620]  got involved, not just
[3:13:32.620 --> 3:13:34.620]  in dealing with drug traffickers, but
[3:13:34.620 --> 3:13:36.620]  actually in the Far East
[3:13:36.620 --> 3:13:38.620]  building up a drug traffic
[3:13:38.620 --> 3:13:40.620]  as a kind of
[3:13:40.620 --> 3:13:42.620]  capitalist resource against
[3:13:42.620 --> 3:13:44.620]  communism in China
[3:13:44.620 --> 3:13:46.620]  and OPC. And again, there's that very
[3:13:46.620 --> 3:13:48.620]  deeply evil idea of
[3:13:48.620 --> 3:13:50.620]  Injustifies the Means. Well,
[3:13:50.620 --> 3:13:52.620]  if the Soviets are making money running child
[3:13:52.620 --> 3:13:54.620]  kidnapping rings, we better. Well, if the
[3:13:54.620 --> 3:13:56.620]  Soviets are dealing cocaine and heroin,
[3:13:56.620 --> 3:13:58.620]  we better take control of it. You know,
[3:13:58.620 --> 3:14:00.620]  it's always, we're doing all this evil
[3:14:00.620 --> 3:14:02.620]  because we have to
[3:14:02.620 --> 3:14:04.620]  guard the truths for the bodyguard of lies.
[3:14:04.620 --> 3:14:06.620]  Well, as I say, it began
[3:14:06.620 --> 3:14:08.620]  in, in, it
[3:14:08.620 --> 3:14:10.620]  began in a mood of fear, but it went
[3:14:10.620 --> 3:14:12.620]  down to a mood of global
[3:14:12.620 --> 3:14:14.620]  dominance. It changed.
[3:14:14.620 --> 3:14:16.620]  At the beginning, it was a question
[3:14:16.620 --> 3:14:18.620]  of fear that
[3:14:18.620 --> 3:14:20.620]  if we didn't control
[3:14:20.620 --> 3:14:22.620]  the flow of opium
[3:14:22.620 --> 3:14:24.620]  in Southeast Asia, then
[3:14:24.620 --> 3:14:26.620]  the Chinese communists
[3:14:26.620 --> 3:14:28.620]  would. Whether that was true or not, I
[3:14:28.620 --> 3:14:30.620]  actually doubt what that it was
[3:14:30.620 --> 3:14:32.620]  because, you know, opium
[3:14:32.620 --> 3:14:34.620]  had been such a scourge
[3:14:34.620 --> 3:14:36.620]  to China that one of the things
[3:14:36.620 --> 3:14:38.620]  that was really motivating
[3:14:38.620 --> 3:14:40.620]  the Chinese communists very powerfully
[3:14:40.620 --> 3:14:42.620]  was to end the
[3:14:42.620 --> 3:14:44.620]  scourge of opium. That had been used
[3:14:44.620 --> 3:14:46.620]  by the Western powers to control, to get
[3:14:46.620 --> 3:14:48.620]  into China, to then break it up. And
[3:14:48.620 --> 3:14:50.620]  let's not forget Skull and Bones,
[3:14:50.620 --> 3:14:52.620]  which predominantly founded the CIA
[3:14:52.620 --> 3:14:54.620]  in 1947, was founded
[3:14:54.620 --> 3:14:56.620]  with opium money
[3:14:56.620 --> 3:14:58.620]  out of the Russell. So far enough back, that's
[3:14:58.620 --> 3:15:00.620]  quite true. So we all know
[3:15:00.620 --> 3:15:02.620]  it was never good.
[3:15:02.620 --> 3:15:04.620]  I mean, they sold the young men that
[3:15:04.620 --> 3:15:06.620]  went and joined and murdered and killed
[3:15:06.620 --> 3:15:08.620]  and did all this evil to fight communism.
[3:15:08.620 --> 3:15:10.620]  But up top, the big boys knew
[3:15:10.620 --> 3:15:12.620]  what it was really about.
[3:15:12.620 --> 3:15:14.620]  Well, you know, it was
[3:15:14.620 --> 3:15:16.620]  an ugly situation in Asia.
[3:15:16.620 --> 3:15:18.620]  The communists were doing ugly things
[3:15:18.620 --> 3:15:20.620]  too.
[3:15:20.620 --> 3:15:22.620]  And
[3:15:22.620 --> 3:15:24.620]  as I say, rightly or wrongly
[3:15:24.620 --> 3:15:26.620]  the decision was made.
[3:15:26.620 --> 3:15:28.620]  But because it was made in secret,
[3:15:28.620 --> 3:15:30.620]  it was never made with
[3:15:30.620 --> 3:15:32.620]  rational reassessment. Most
[3:15:32.620 --> 3:15:34.620]  policies of the government
[3:15:34.620 --> 3:15:36.620]  are ones which are reassessed
[3:15:36.620 --> 3:15:38.620]  from time to time, but
[3:15:38.620 --> 3:15:40.620]  the involvement with the drug
[3:15:40.620 --> 3:15:42.620]  traffickers was so secret
[3:15:42.620 --> 3:15:44.620]  that there was no
[3:15:44.620 --> 3:15:46.620]  overview, no
[3:15:46.620 --> 3:15:48.620]  reassessment
[3:15:48.620 --> 3:15:50.620]  and
[3:15:50.620 --> 3:15:52.620]  it turned
[3:15:52.620 --> 3:15:54.620]  Burma, which
[3:15:54.620 --> 3:15:56.620]  before the war
[3:15:56.620 --> 3:15:58.620]  had not been a major part of the global
[3:15:58.620 --> 3:16:00.620]  opium scene,
[3:16:00.620 --> 3:16:02.620]  it turned Burma
[3:16:02.620 --> 3:16:04.620]  into the major supplier
[3:16:04.620 --> 3:16:06.620]  of opium and heroin for the world.
[3:16:06.620 --> 3:16:08.620]  And then, ironically
[3:16:08.620 --> 3:16:10.620]  as the Vietnam War
[3:16:10.620 --> 3:16:12.620]  scaled down and
[3:16:12.620 --> 3:16:14.620]  the Americans pulled out
[3:16:14.620 --> 3:16:16.620]  one of the consequences was
[3:16:16.620 --> 3:16:18.620]  that the Burmese
[3:16:18.620 --> 3:16:20.620]  opium production
[3:16:20.620 --> 3:16:22.620]  also scaled down and we might
[3:16:22.620 --> 3:16:24.620]  have actually been able
[3:16:24.620 --> 3:16:26.620]  to lick the heroin
[3:16:26.620 --> 3:16:28.620]  problem in the world except that
[3:16:28.620 --> 3:16:30.620]  well, within
[3:16:30.620 --> 3:16:32.620]  a decade, there we were
[3:16:32.620 --> 3:16:34.620]  the CIA was
[3:16:34.620 --> 3:16:36.620]  in Afghanistan
[3:16:36.620 --> 3:16:38.620]  and helping now to
[3:16:38.620 --> 3:16:40.620]  build up opium
[3:16:40.620 --> 3:16:42.620]  well, to
[3:16:42.620 --> 3:16:44.620]  helping to build up is a bit strong.
[3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:46.620]  But backing
[3:16:46.620 --> 3:16:48.620]  the people who
[3:16:48.620 --> 3:16:50.620]  energetically built up
[3:16:50.620 --> 3:16:52.620]  opium and heroin production
[3:16:52.620 --> 3:16:54.620]  in... Well, you gotta have some way
[3:16:54.620 --> 3:16:56.620]  to put our young people in prisons and have cops
[3:16:56.620 --> 3:16:58.620]  in black uniforms stomping around
[3:16:58.620 --> 3:17:00.620]  searching everyone, I mean, you know.
[3:17:00.620 --> 3:17:02.620]  It is, it has become
[3:17:02.620 --> 3:17:04.620]  part of the social fabric of this
[3:17:04.620 --> 3:17:06.620]  country, in particular
[3:17:06.620 --> 3:17:08.620]  of course, it weighs very
[3:17:08.620 --> 3:17:10.620]  heavily on the ethnic populations
[3:17:10.620 --> 3:17:12.620]  blacks and Hispanics.
[3:17:12.620 --> 3:17:14.620]  A very high percentage
[3:17:14.620 --> 3:17:16.620]  of young blacks are
[3:17:16.620 --> 3:17:18.620]  in prison
[3:17:18.620 --> 3:17:20.620]  even for possession
[3:17:20.620 --> 3:17:22.620]  of, say, crack, which
[3:17:22.620 --> 3:17:24.620]  is treated far more
[3:17:24.620 --> 3:17:26.620]  punitively because it's
[3:17:26.620 --> 3:17:28.620]  an ethnic drug
[3:17:28.620 --> 3:17:30.620]  than regular cocaine, which
[3:17:30.620 --> 3:17:32.620]  is used by the upper middle class
[3:17:32.620 --> 3:17:34.620]  of the white population. Well, in
[3:17:34.620 --> 3:17:36.620]  Russia, Limbaugh can take 100 oxy-cottons
[3:17:36.620 --> 3:17:38.620]  a day, that's synthetic heroin, that's
[3:17:38.620 --> 3:17:40.620]  alright, he doesn't get in trouble. But a
[3:17:40.620 --> 3:17:42.620]  young black man or anybody else is found
[3:17:42.620 --> 3:17:44.620]  with a cocaine, they're going to go to prison
[3:17:44.620 --> 3:17:46.620]  for a very, very long time and, you know,
[3:17:46.620 --> 3:17:48.620]  they need slaves in the prisons and
[3:17:48.620 --> 3:17:50.620]  I've looked... Well, I'm very
[3:17:50.620 --> 3:17:52.620]  worried about this policy, just from a
[3:17:52.620 --> 3:17:54.620]  national security point of view.
[3:17:54.620 --> 3:17:56.620]  You know, in this country
[3:17:56.620 --> 3:17:58.620]  we have two kinds of Muslims.
[3:17:58.620 --> 3:18:00.620]  We have
[3:18:00.620 --> 3:18:02.620]  ironically
[3:18:02.620 --> 3:18:04.620]  some of the most
[3:18:04.620 --> 3:18:06.620]  affluent Muslims outside
[3:18:06.620 --> 3:18:08.620]  of the Islamic areas
[3:18:08.620 --> 3:18:10.620]  are in this country and
[3:18:10.620 --> 3:18:12.620]  are basically very well
[3:18:12.620 --> 3:18:14.620]  assimilated.
[3:18:14.620 --> 3:18:16.620]  But the
[3:18:16.620 --> 3:18:18.620]  prisons are recruiting grounds
[3:18:18.620 --> 3:18:20.620]  for the black Muslims and there are
[3:18:20.620 --> 3:18:22.620]  different trends among them. Some of them
[3:18:22.620 --> 3:18:24.620]  again, I think most of the black
[3:18:24.620 --> 3:18:26.620]  Muslims, their aspirations
[3:18:26.620 --> 3:18:28.620]  are to be middle class and
[3:18:28.620 --> 3:18:30.620]  to join the American mainstream.
[3:18:30.620 --> 3:18:32.620]  But there are some deviant
[3:18:32.620 --> 3:18:34.620]  elements
[3:18:34.620 --> 3:18:36.620]  recruiting in the prisons
[3:18:36.620 --> 3:18:38.620]  and actually getting
[3:18:38.620 --> 3:18:40.620]  people to go over to these
[3:18:40.620 --> 3:18:42.620]  training camps in Afghanistan and
[3:18:42.620 --> 3:18:44.620]  I think that
[3:18:44.620 --> 3:18:46.620]  because all of our policies are
[3:18:46.620 --> 3:18:48.620]  so irrational, so crazy in
[3:18:48.620 --> 3:18:50.620]  this area, there's no
[3:18:50.620 --> 3:18:52.620]  rational assessment of the dangers
[3:18:52.620 --> 3:18:54.620]  that I'm aware of
[3:18:54.620 --> 3:18:56.620]  of the dangers that
[3:18:56.620 --> 3:18:58.620]  this presents
[3:18:58.620 --> 3:19:00.620]  for our country. Well,
[3:19:00.620 --> 3:19:02.620]  we come back, I want to get more into drug
[3:19:02.620 --> 3:19:04.620]  trafficking with Peter Del Scott but also
[3:19:04.620 --> 3:19:06.620]  deep government, continuity government
[3:19:06.620 --> 3:19:08.620]  in and around the 9-11 attacks
[3:19:08.620 --> 3:19:10.620]  and what you think the
[3:19:10.620 --> 3:19:12.620]  continuity government system are
[3:19:12.620 --> 3:19:14.620]  private owners, what are they planning
[3:19:14.620 --> 3:19:16.620]  for us in the future? From the
[3:19:16.620 --> 3:19:18.620]  activities you're charting and what they're doing,
[3:19:18.620 --> 3:19:20.620]  I've never seen a build up
[3:19:20.620 --> 3:19:22.620]  this big domestically, I mean this is
[3:19:22.620 --> 3:19:24.620]  massive, it's industrial, it's
[3:19:24.620 --> 3:19:26.620]  focused on the average people.
[3:19:26.620 --> 3:19:28.620]  What are they planning, Peter Del Scott?
[3:19:28.620 --> 3:19:30.620]  Jim Newcomer
[3:19:30.620 --> 3:19:32.620]  from Midas Resources, August
[3:19:32.620 --> 3:19:34.620]  20th, 2008. Gold opened today
[3:19:34.620 --> 3:19:36.620]  at 8-11-10. One ounce gold coins
[3:19:36.620 --> 3:19:38.620]  can be purchased for 8-35-48,
[3:19:38.620 --> 3:19:40.620]  4-11-75 for half
[3:19:40.620 --> 3:19:42.620]  ounce and 2-0-5-88 for quarter
[3:19:42.620 --> 3:19:44.620]  ounce. That's 8-35-48,
[3:19:44.620 --> 3:19:46.620]  4-11-75 and 2-0-5-88.
[3:19:46.620 --> 3:19:48.620]  The Chinese government
[3:19:48.620 --> 3:19:50.620]  has begun a campaign of economic threats against
[3:19:50.620 --> 3:19:52.620]  the U.S. hinting liquidation of its vast
[3:19:52.620 --> 3:19:54.620]  holdings of U.S. Treasuries, responding to
[3:19:54.620 --> 3:19:56.620]  Washington's trade sanctions forcing
[3:19:56.620 --> 3:19:58.620]  beyond revolution. Communist party bodies
[3:19:58.620 --> 3:20:00.620]  are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33
[3:20:00.620 --> 3:20:02.620]  trillion reserves as a political
[3:20:02.620 --> 3:20:04.620]  weapon causing bond yields to spike,
[3:20:04.620 --> 3:20:06.620]  hammering the U.S. housing market and throwing
[3:20:06.620 --> 3:20:08.620]  the economy into a recession. Russia,
[3:20:08.620 --> 3:20:10.620]  Switzerland and several other countries have
[3:20:10.620 --> 3:20:12.620]  reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[3:20:12.620 --> 3:20:14.620]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard
[3:20:14.620 --> 3:20:16.620]  published the report, China Threatens

[3:20:30.620 --> 3:20:32.620]  On September 11th, 2001,
[3:20:32.620 --> 3:20:34.620]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[3:20:34.620 --> 3:20:36.620]  I went to Ground Sierra and we knew
[3:20:36.620 --> 3:20:38.620]  what to do.
[3:20:38.620 --> 3:20:40.620]  At least we thought we did.

[3:20:42.620 --> 3:20:44.620]  that finally gives first responders

[3:20:46.620 --> 3:20:48.620]  Whitman,
[3:20:48.620 --> 3:20:50.620]  EVA director
[3:20:50.620 --> 3:20:52.620]  on the ATD made a statement
[3:20:52.620 --> 3:20:54.620]  that the air
[3:20:54.620 --> 3:20:56.620]  was safe to breathe. This film follows
[3:20:56.620 --> 3:20:58.620]  the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth

[3:21:00.620 --> 3:21:02.620]  take action against their global masters.
[3:21:02.620 --> 3:21:04.620]  He had his hand over the radio
[3:21:04.620 --> 3:21:06.620]  while he was getting a countdown. He takes
[3:21:06.620 --> 3:21:08.620]  his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1
[3:21:08.620 --> 3:21:10.620]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[3:22:30.620 --> 3:22:32.620]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[3:22:32.620 --> 3:22:34.620]  Look, up there in the sky
[3:22:34.620 --> 3:22:36.620]  it's non-X-man.
[3:22:36.620 --> 3:22:38.620]  He's in a dive.
[3:22:38.620 --> 3:22:40.620]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[3:22:40.620 --> 3:22:42.620]  Let's go look.
[3:22:42.620 --> 3:22:44.620]  I'm non-X-man and your toenails
[3:22:44.620 --> 3:22:46.620]  need non-X nail gel.
[3:22:46.620 --> 3:22:48.620]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[3:22:48.620 --> 3:22:50.620]  Take them out, let's see them.
[3:22:50.620 --> 3:22:52.620]  Oh,
[3:22:52.620 --> 3:22:54.620]  I'm so embarrassed.
[3:22:54.620 --> 3:22:56.620]  Don't worry, now there's non-X nail gel.
[3:22:56.620 --> 3:22:58.620]  Use it on your toenails regularly
[3:22:58.620 --> 3:23:00.620]  and they'll look fantastic
[3:23:00.620 --> 3:23:02.620]  in sandals.
[3:23:02.620 --> 3:23:04.620]  I will non-X-man.
[3:23:04.620 --> 3:23:06.620]  Great. Well,
[3:23:06.620 --> 3:23:08.620]  I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[3:23:10.620 --> 3:23:12.620]  Don't let non-X-man find you with
[3:23:12.620 --> 3:23:14.620]  unsightly toenails.
[3:23:14.620 --> 3:23:16.620]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed
[3:23:16.620 --> 3:23:18.620]  non-X nail gel.
[3:23:18.620 --> 3:23:20.620]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters,
[3:23:20.620 --> 3:23:22.620]  Walgreens, CVS, Lawns,
[3:23:22.620 --> 3:23:24.620]  Meyer, Giant Eagle,
[3:23:24.620 --> 3:23:26.620]  Car Drug, Sniders,
[3:23:26.620 --> 3:23:28.620]  Dwayne Reed, Bylo
[3:23:28.620 --> 3:23:32.620]  and David Aide.
[3:23:32.620 --> 3:23:34.620]  Peter Dale Scott is our guest,
[3:23:34.620 --> 3:23:36.620]  really a top academic studying
[3:23:36.620 --> 3:23:38.620]  the shadow government,
[3:23:38.620 --> 3:23:40.620]  government narcotics traveling.
[3:23:40.620 --> 3:23:42.620]  But to say government, it's private industry
[3:23:42.620 --> 3:23:44.620]  that takes control of government.
[3:23:44.620 --> 3:23:46.620]  And when they call it
[3:23:46.620 --> 3:23:48.620]  continuity of government, they're being honest.
[3:23:48.620 --> 3:23:50.620]  This means continuing the shadow government,
[3:23:50.620 --> 3:23:52.620]  continuing the corporate ownership of our government,
[3:23:52.620 --> 3:23:54.620]  continuing using it to tax us,
[3:23:54.620 --> 3:23:56.620]  regulate us, control us,
[3:23:56.620 --> 3:23:58.620]  maintaining us as
[3:23:58.620 --> 3:24:00.620]  really a commodity.
[3:24:00.620 --> 3:24:02.620]  And that's what we are.
[3:24:02.620 --> 3:24:04.620]  To them, a very cheap commodity,
[3:24:04.620 --> 3:24:06.620]  blood is cheap, life is very cheap,
[3:24:06.620 --> 3:24:08.620]  and destroying our freedom is
[3:24:08.620 --> 3:24:10.620]  foremost, dumbing us down.
[3:24:10.620 --> 3:24:12.620]  It's an ongoing corporate takeover
[3:24:12.620 --> 3:24:14.620]  of everything, our minds, you name it.
[3:24:14.620 --> 3:24:16.620]  So let's get into this shadow government,
[3:24:16.620 --> 3:24:18.620]  the continuity of government system,
[3:24:18.620 --> 3:24:20.620]  and where do you see it going, Peter Dale Scott?
[3:24:20.620 --> 3:24:22.620]  Well, I actually
[3:24:22.620 --> 3:24:24.620]  know very little
[3:24:24.620 --> 3:24:26.620]  about the continuity of government,
[3:24:26.620 --> 3:24:28.620]  like everybody else.
[3:24:28.620 --> 3:24:30.620]  I think the first thing to understand is
[3:24:30.620 --> 3:24:32.620]  it's so secret that even
[3:24:32.620 --> 3:24:34.620]  Congress isn't allowed to know
[3:24:34.620 --> 3:24:36.620]  what continuity of government means.
[3:24:36.620 --> 3:24:38.620]  And we had kind of a showdown,
[3:24:38.620 --> 3:24:40.620]  or we should have had a showdown
[3:24:40.620 --> 3:24:42.620]  in Congress
[3:24:42.620 --> 3:24:44.620]  just exactly a year ago
[3:24:44.620 --> 3:24:46.620]  when
[3:24:46.620 --> 3:24:48.620]  Congressman DeFazio
[3:24:48.620 --> 3:24:50.620]  was on the Homeland Security Committee,
[3:24:50.620 --> 3:24:52.620]  he noticed that
[3:24:52.620 --> 3:24:54.620]  the National Security
[3:24:54.620 --> 3:24:56.620]  Presidential Memorandum
[3:24:56.620 --> 3:24:58.620]  under 51
[3:24:58.620 --> 3:25:00.620]  had renewed
[3:25:00.620 --> 3:25:02.620]  the state of emergency
[3:25:02.620 --> 3:25:04.620]  and there were some secret annexes
[3:25:04.620 --> 3:25:06.620]  which contained provisions
[3:25:06.620 --> 3:25:08.620]  about continuity of government, COG.
[3:25:08.620 --> 3:25:10.620]  So he asked
[3:25:10.620 --> 3:25:12.620]  to see them and was told he couldn't see them.
[3:25:12.620 --> 3:25:14.620]  And then his whole committee,
[3:25:14.620 --> 3:25:16.620]  Homeland Security Committee
[3:25:16.620 --> 3:25:18.620]  asked in writing to see them
[3:25:18.620 --> 3:25:20.620]  and were told that
[3:25:20.620 --> 3:25:22.620]  the committee did not have the clearances
[3:25:22.620 --> 3:25:24.620]  to see this.
[3:25:24.620 --> 3:25:26.620]  Well, when you consider that one of the few things
[3:25:26.620 --> 3:25:28.620]  that has been repeatedly said
[3:25:28.620 --> 3:25:30.620]  about COG and it was said
[3:25:30.620 --> 3:25:32.620]  way back in the 1980s
[3:25:32.620 --> 3:25:34.620]  they always claim that Congress is involved.
[3:25:34.620 --> 3:25:36.620]  Congress is co-equal, but now
[3:25:36.620 --> 3:25:38.620]  some shadowy military
[3:25:38.620 --> 3:25:40.620]  corporate executive thing says no, no, no.
[3:25:42.620 --> 3:25:44.620]  Yeah, I want to say that in the 1980s,
[3:25:44.620 --> 3:25:46.620]  the news stories
[3:25:46.620 --> 3:25:48.620]  all over North
[3:25:48.620 --> 3:25:50.620]  was working on them at that time
[3:25:50.620 --> 3:25:52.620]  and all over North
[3:25:52.620 --> 3:25:54.620]  had created some enemies
[3:25:54.620 --> 3:25:56.620]  in the government
[3:25:56.620 --> 3:25:58.620]  and there were some leaks
[3:25:58.620 --> 3:26:00.620]  about COG and the main leak
[3:26:00.620 --> 3:26:02.620]  was that it was
[3:26:02.620 --> 3:26:04.620]  plans for the suspension of the U.S.
[3:26:04.620 --> 3:26:06.620]  Constitution.
[3:26:06.620 --> 3:26:08.620]  So we have, this is the line in the sand
[3:26:08.620 --> 3:26:10.620]  that Congress
[3:26:10.620 --> 3:26:12.620]  is asking about
[3:26:12.620 --> 3:26:14.620]  a program which is said to involve
[3:26:14.620 --> 3:26:16.620]  suspension of the Constitution
[3:26:16.620 --> 3:26:18.620]  and is told that Congress doesn't have
[3:26:18.620 --> 3:26:20.620]  the authority to look at it.
[3:26:20.620 --> 3:26:22.620]  Which is a suspension.
[3:26:22.620 --> 3:26:24.620]  That is a suspension.
[3:26:24.620 --> 3:26:26.620]  That is prima facia.
[3:26:26.620 --> 3:26:28.620]  He's saying that under the Constitution
[3:26:28.620 --> 3:26:30.620]  the Congress is co-equal.
[3:26:30.620 --> 3:26:32.620]  Well, particularly because Congress
[3:26:32.620 --> 3:26:34.620]  failed, if Congress had done something about it
[3:26:34.620 --> 3:26:36.620]  maybe we could have got things back
[3:26:36.620 --> 3:26:38.620]  on a more level keel
[3:26:38.620 --> 3:26:40.620]  and back to normal, but
[3:26:40.620 --> 3:26:42.620]  so far Congress has done nothing
[3:26:42.620 --> 3:26:44.620]  about this challenge to its authority
[3:26:44.620 --> 3:26:46.620]  which is very discouraging for me.
[3:26:46.620 --> 3:26:48.620]  It is.
[3:26:48.620 --> 3:26:50.620]  Well, I've reverse engineered a lot
[3:26:50.620 --> 3:26:52.620]  of what COG is doing
[3:26:52.620 --> 3:26:54.620]  just from interviewing local police chiefs
[3:26:54.620 --> 3:26:56.620]  where the rubber meets the roads
[3:26:56.620 --> 3:26:58.620]  where you pick up the most intelligence
[3:26:58.620 --> 3:27:00.620]  and for at least 30 years
[3:27:00.620 --> 3:27:02.620]  I discovered it 10 years ago
[3:27:02.620 --> 3:27:04.620]  they go to every major police chief
[3:27:04.620 --> 3:27:06.620]  and Special Forces, CIA, Delta Force
[3:27:06.620 --> 3:27:08.620]  and it's always over something innocuous
[3:27:08.620 --> 3:27:10.620]  they corrupt them
[3:27:10.620 --> 3:27:12.620]  and they say here's $100,000
[3:27:12.620 --> 3:27:14.620]  this little favor
[3:27:14.620 --> 3:27:16.620]  and they'll go well that's a little bitty favor
[3:27:16.620 --> 3:27:18.620]  just calling the fire chief and asking
[3:27:18.620 --> 3:27:20.620]  to let you do something in an old building
[3:27:20.620 --> 3:27:22.620]  we just want to be your friend take the 100 grand
[3:27:22.620 --> 3:27:24.620]  and that's how they
[3:27:24.620 --> 3:27:26.620]  that's just one little window in
[3:27:26.620 --> 3:27:28.620]  or in the late 80s
[3:27:28.620 --> 3:27:30.620]  they were doing gun confiscation raids
[3:27:30.620 --> 3:27:32.620]  using Marines and police uniforms
[3:27:32.620 --> 3:27:34.620]  or we learned almost three years ago
[3:27:34.620 --> 3:27:36.620]  and it came out mainstream news a year after I reported it
[3:27:36.620 --> 3:27:38.620]  we got the secret FEMA documents
[3:27:38.620 --> 3:27:40.620]  where they recruited 26,000 preachers
[3:27:40.620 --> 3:27:42.620]  to give their flock sermons
[3:27:42.620 --> 3:27:44.620]  written by FEMA about going to camps
[3:27:44.620 --> 3:27:46.620]  giving up your guns
[3:27:46.620 --> 3:27:48.620]  Romans 13
[3:27:48.620 --> 3:27:50.620]  so what I'm saying is on the ground
[3:27:50.620 --> 3:27:52.620]  it's everywhere I mean they are working like busy bees
[3:27:52.620 --> 3:27:54.620]  not just with Hollywood scripts
[3:27:54.620 --> 3:27:56.620]  or TV propaganda
[3:27:56.620 --> 3:27:58.620]  but I mean they're everywhere engaging
[3:27:58.620 --> 3:28:00.620]  in hardcore criminal activity
[3:28:00.620 --> 3:28:02.620]  well there's some of what you've talked about
[3:28:02.620 --> 3:28:04.620]  actually anti-dates
[3:28:04.620 --> 3:28:06.620]  this current COG planning
[3:28:06.620 --> 3:28:08.620]  that I'm talking about
[3:28:08.620 --> 3:28:10.620]  the current phase of it
[3:28:10.620 --> 3:28:12.620]  began in the
[3:28:12.620 --> 3:28:14.620]  second year of the Reagan presidency
[3:28:14.620 --> 3:28:16.620]  when Cheney and Rumsfeld
[3:28:16.620 --> 3:28:18.620]  were empowered to plan it
[3:28:18.620 --> 3:28:20.620]  and they planned it for 20 years
[3:28:20.620 --> 3:28:22.620]  but before that there were older programs
[3:28:22.620 --> 3:28:24.620]  and one of them of course was
[3:28:24.620 --> 3:28:26.620]  the CIA
[3:28:26.620 --> 3:28:28.620]  which is supposed to work overseas
[3:28:28.620 --> 3:28:30.620]  and have no domestic
[3:28:30.620 --> 3:28:32.620]  security assignments
[3:28:32.620 --> 3:28:34.620]  but in fact has worked very closely
[3:28:34.620 --> 3:28:36.620]  with police departments
[3:28:36.620 --> 3:28:38.620]  some more than others
[3:28:38.620 --> 3:28:40.620]  but a great many of them
[3:28:40.620 --> 3:28:42.620]  and giving
[3:28:42.620 --> 3:28:44.620]  police
[3:28:44.620 --> 3:28:46.620]  recruiting police to serve overseas
[3:28:46.620 --> 3:28:48.620]  for the CIA
[3:28:48.620 --> 3:28:50.620]  so there's a great deal going on
[3:28:50.620 --> 3:28:52.620]  that you know we only
[3:28:52.620 --> 3:28:54.620]  get little glimpses of
[3:28:54.620 --> 3:28:56.620]  but you've interviewed people
[3:28:56.620 --> 3:28:58.620]  what I've done is just
[3:28:58.620 --> 3:29:00.620]  work with documents
[3:29:00.620 --> 3:29:02.620]  and news stories
[3:29:02.620 --> 3:29:04.620]  and what I see as being
[3:29:04.620 --> 3:29:06.620]  the core of the COG planning
[3:29:06.620 --> 3:29:08.620]  under Rumsfeld and Cheney
[3:29:08.620 --> 3:29:10.620]  has three elements
[3:29:10.620 --> 3:29:12.620]  the first one is
[3:29:12.620 --> 3:29:14.620]  stay there got a break
[3:29:14.620 --> 3:29:16.620]  yeah there's an expansion
[3:29:16.620 --> 3:29:18.620]  let's get your analysis on that
[3:29:18.620 --> 3:29:20.620]  long segment coming up
[3:29:30.620 --> 3:29:32.620]  the pressures of everyday life can deliver
[3:29:32.620 --> 3:29:34.620]  a serious blow to your health
[3:29:34.620 --> 3:29:36.620]  stress increases blood pressure
[3:29:36.620 --> 3:29:38.620]  potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers
[3:29:38.620 --> 3:29:40.620]  depression and insomnia
[3:29:40.620 --> 3:29:42.620]  stress suppresses your immune system
[3:29:42.620 --> 3:29:44.620]  and inhibits weight control

[3:32:42.620 --> 3:32:44.620]  the governors
[3:32:44.620 --> 3:32:46.620]  they're not in control anymore
[3:32:46.620 --> 3:32:48.620]  but in case they ever
[3:32:48.620 --> 3:32:50.620]  try to take their rightful
[3:32:50.620 --> 3:32:52.620]  authority of the people
[3:32:52.620 --> 3:32:54.620]  through the people
[3:32:54.620 --> 3:32:56.620]  they're being bypassed secret prisons are being
[3:32:56.620 --> 3:32:58.620]  built assassins are being put in every city
[3:32:58.620 --> 3:33:00.620]  the CIA is moving into emergency
[3:33:00.620 --> 3:33:02.620]  management centers with local police
[3:33:02.620 --> 3:33:04.620]  they're hiring police as hit men
[3:33:04.620 --> 3:33:06.620]  so they can kill people like Carnaby down
[3:33:06.620 --> 3:33:08.620]  in Houston when they need it
[3:33:08.620 --> 3:33:10.620]  I mean they mean business
[3:33:10.620 --> 3:33:12.620]  and they're getting ready for something
[3:33:12.620 --> 3:33:14.620]  really big why are they gearing up
[3:33:14.620 --> 3:33:16.620]  when the public is already their slaves
[3:33:16.620 --> 3:33:18.620]  don't even know what continent they're on
[3:33:18.620 --> 3:33:20.620]  don't even know they're on a planet half of them
[3:33:20.620 --> 3:33:22.620]  some people don't most kids now don't know
[3:33:22.620 --> 3:33:24.620]  the sun sets and the world's around
[3:33:24.620 --> 3:33:26.620]  total disconnection from reality
[3:33:26.620 --> 3:33:28.620]  why then is the COG, the social engineers
[3:33:28.620 --> 3:33:30.620]  so worried
[3:33:30.620 --> 3:33:32.620]  we'll talk to Peter Del Scott about that in just a few minutes
[3:33:32.620 --> 3:33:34.620]  first off
[3:33:34.620 --> 3:33:36.620]  a cola blue
[3:33:36.620 --> 3:33:38.620]  is a wonderful atmospheric water generator
[3:33:38.620 --> 3:33:40.620]  for your home, pays for itself in one year
[3:33:40.620 --> 3:33:42.620]  if you buy your water from the store
[3:33:42.620 --> 3:33:44.620]  pure clean water without the fluoride
[3:33:44.620 --> 3:33:46.620]  ultimate water from the humidity and the air
[3:33:46.620 --> 3:33:48.620]  know exactly what you're drinking
[3:33:48.620 --> 3:33:50.620]  machine produces up to 28 liters of water
[3:33:50.620 --> 3:33:52.620]  in 24 hours or 7.5 gallons
[3:33:52.620 --> 3:33:54.620]  produces about 2.5-3 gallons
[3:33:54.620 --> 3:33:56.620]  even in the really dry desert
[3:33:56.620 --> 3:33:58.620]  and you can plug it into a solar panel
[3:33:58.620 --> 3:34:00.620]  or into the wall, we have one and love it
[3:34:00.620 --> 3:34:02.620]  low operating cost
[3:34:02.620 --> 3:34:04.620]  on average it costs 12 cents a gallon
[3:34:04.620 --> 3:34:06.620]  great tasting pure H2O
[3:34:06.620 --> 3:34:08.620]  exactly the way nature makes it
[3:34:08.620 --> 3:34:10.620]  no chemicals, pollutants or toxins
[3:34:10.620 --> 3:34:12.620]  neutral pH
[3:34:12.620 --> 3:34:14.620]  866-585-4044
[3:34:14.620 --> 3:34:16.620]  866-585-4044
[3:34:16.620 --> 3:34:18.620]  or colablue.com
[3:34:18.620 --> 3:34:20.620]  colablue.com
[3:34:20.620 --> 3:34:22.620]  and that is one of the great sponsors
[3:34:22.620 --> 3:34:24.620]  that makes so much of this radio show possible
[3:34:24.620 --> 3:34:26.620]  alright I've been jumping in
[3:34:26.620 --> 3:34:28.620]  I always want to get Peter Del Scott on
[3:34:28.620 --> 3:34:30.620]  and not interrupt but I want to back up everything he's saying
[3:34:30.620 --> 3:34:32.620]  I want to add pieces of info
[3:34:32.620 --> 3:34:34.620]  I want to and he knows so much
[3:34:34.620 --> 3:34:36.620]  but
[3:34:36.620 --> 3:34:38.620]  getting more into COG
[3:34:38.620 --> 3:34:40.620]  and we know now it's full congress you're nothing
[3:34:40.620 --> 3:34:42.620]  even though congress is co-equal
[3:34:42.620 --> 3:34:44.620]  really the founder said it was above the executive
[3:34:44.620 --> 3:34:46.620]  it makes the laws and
[3:34:46.620 --> 3:34:48.620]  the executive executes
[3:34:48.620 --> 3:34:50.620]  I mean that is a constitutional crisis
[3:34:50.620 --> 3:34:52.620]  but it just goes forward
[3:34:52.620 --> 3:34:54.620]  we know the NSA spying on congress
[3:34:54.620 --> 3:34:56.620]  I just had Wayne Madsen on about that last hour
[3:34:56.620 --> 3:34:58.620]  we know they're really gearing up
[3:34:58.620 --> 3:35:00.620]  there's a huge build up
[3:35:00.620 --> 3:35:02.620]  so just whatever you think is most important
[3:35:02.620 --> 3:35:04.620]  on this subject Peter
[3:35:04.620 --> 3:35:06.620]  well I'm going to first of all dispel
[3:35:06.620 --> 3:35:08.620]  the illusion that I know
[3:35:08.620 --> 3:35:10.620]  what COG is doing
[3:35:10.620 --> 3:35:12.620]  because I'm
[3:35:12.620 --> 3:35:14.620]  quite sure of what I do know but it's also
[3:35:14.620 --> 3:35:16.620]  quite limited
[3:35:16.620 --> 3:35:18.620]  what I know
[3:35:18.620 --> 3:35:20.620]  about COG is based on
[3:35:20.620 --> 3:35:22.620]  reports from the 1980s
[3:35:22.620 --> 3:35:24.620]  when it was the same planning only with
[3:35:24.620 --> 3:35:26.620]  Oliver North
[3:35:26.620 --> 3:35:28.620]  and there are three major ingredients
[3:35:28.620 --> 3:35:30.620]  of which the third is the most important
[3:35:30.620 --> 3:35:32.620]  the first is
[3:35:32.620 --> 3:35:34.620]  warrantless surveillance
[3:35:34.620 --> 3:35:36.620]  and we've now seen this
[3:35:36.620 --> 3:35:38.620]  embodied into law really
[3:35:38.620 --> 3:35:40.620]  with the amendments to the FISA Act
[3:35:40.620 --> 3:35:42.620]  and the second is
[3:35:42.620 --> 3:35:44.620]  warrantless detention
[3:35:44.620 --> 3:35:46.620]  and you know I wrote a news story
[3:35:46.620 --> 3:35:48.620]  a couple of years back about
[3:35:48.620 --> 3:35:50.620]  a $400 million
[3:35:50.620 --> 3:35:52.620]  contract to KBR
[3:35:52.620 --> 3:35:54.620]  which was back in those days
[3:35:54.620 --> 3:35:56.620]  still a subsidiary
[3:35:56.620 --> 3:35:58.620]  of Cheney's old
[3:35:58.620 --> 3:36:00.620]  corporation Halliburton
[3:36:00.620 --> 3:36:02.620]  to build detention camps
[3:36:02.620 --> 3:36:04.620]  as part of what the
[3:36:04.620 --> 3:36:06.620]  Homeland Security Department said on their website
[3:36:06.620 --> 3:36:08.620]  was a 10-year
[3:36:08.620 --> 3:36:10.620]  project endgame
[3:36:10.620 --> 3:36:12.620]  to deal with the problem
[3:36:12.620 --> 3:36:14.620]  of illegal immigrants in this country
[3:36:14.620 --> 3:36:16.620]  that's how they described it
[3:36:16.620 --> 3:36:18.620]  but when you consider that there are almost
[3:36:18.620 --> 3:36:20.620]  12 million illegal immigrants
[3:36:20.620 --> 3:36:22.620]  in this country it's obviously a very
[3:36:22.620 --> 3:36:24.620]  ambitious
[3:36:24.620 --> 3:36:26.620]  program of which this
[3:36:26.620 --> 3:36:28.620]  $400 million budget was only
[3:36:28.620 --> 3:36:30.620]  for one stage of the program
[3:36:30.620 --> 3:36:32.620]  the third and the most
[3:36:32.620 --> 3:36:34.620]  important part
[3:36:34.620 --> 3:36:36.620]  which has been planning
[3:36:36.620 --> 3:36:38.620]  for some time how
[3:36:38.620 --> 3:36:40.620]  to get around the Posse-Cometatis
[3:36:40.620 --> 3:36:42.620]  Act
[3:36:42.620 --> 3:36:44.620]  and normalize
[3:36:44.620 --> 3:36:46.620]  conditions of
[3:36:46.620 --> 3:36:48.620]  martial law military operations
[3:36:48.620 --> 3:36:50.620]  in this country and some very significant
[3:36:50.620 --> 3:36:52.620]  steps have now been taken
[3:36:52.620 --> 3:36:54.620]  publicly in that respect
[3:36:54.620 --> 3:36:56.620]  we are now a military
[3:36:56.620 --> 3:36:58.620]  district we have a north column
[3:36:58.620 --> 3:37:00.620]  for the United States
[3:37:00.620 --> 3:37:02.620]  because the U.S. Army
[3:37:02.620 --> 3:37:04.620]  has a south column to deal with
[3:37:04.620 --> 3:37:06.620]  South America
[3:37:06.620 --> 3:37:08.620]  and when we had
[3:37:08.620 --> 3:37:10.620]  Katrina
[3:37:10.620 --> 3:37:12.620]  Hurricane
[3:37:12.620 --> 3:37:14.620]  the federal government tried very hard
[3:37:14.620 --> 3:37:16.620]  to get Governor Blanco of Louisiana
[3:37:16.620 --> 3:37:18.620]  to allow them to take over
[3:37:18.620 --> 3:37:20.620]  and federalize the National Guard
[3:37:20.620 --> 3:37:22.620]  she resisted
[3:37:22.620 --> 3:37:24.620]  but I think that
[3:37:24.620 --> 3:37:26.620]  maybe in the future
[3:37:26.620 --> 3:37:28.620]  they're just going to take that power
[3:37:28.620 --> 3:37:30.620]  by asking
[3:37:30.620 --> 3:37:32.620]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[3:37:32.620 --> 3:37:34.620]  1997 said that
[3:37:34.620 --> 3:37:36.620]  and said that for insurrection
[3:37:36.620 --> 3:37:38.620]  for rebellion for governor's
[3:37:38.620 --> 3:37:40.620]  rebellion it states the president is
[3:37:40.620 --> 3:37:42.620]  basically a dictator
[3:37:42.620 --> 3:37:44.620]  so I know that you knew that
[3:37:44.620 --> 3:37:46.620]  but for the audience
[3:37:46.620 --> 3:37:48.620]  and one of the things about this
[3:37:48.620 --> 3:37:50.620]  last proclamation
[3:37:50.620 --> 3:37:52.620]  of
[3:37:52.620 --> 3:37:54.620]  extending the emergency
[3:37:54.620 --> 3:37:56.620]  was that Bush has now
[3:37:56.620 --> 3:37:58.620]  taken the responsibility for that
[3:37:58.620 --> 3:38:00.620]  right inside the White House
[3:38:00.620 --> 3:38:02.620]  so it isn't even in the hands
[3:38:02.620 --> 3:38:04.620]  of Homeland Security and FEMA
[3:38:04.620 --> 3:38:06.620]  anymore
[3:38:06.620 --> 3:38:08.620]  it's the direction comes
[3:38:08.620 --> 3:38:10.620]  centrally from
[3:38:10.620 --> 3:38:12.620]  this kind of inner
[3:38:12.620 --> 3:38:14.620]  bureaucracy inside the bureaucracy
[3:38:14.620 --> 3:38:16.620]  and that's
[3:38:16.620 --> 3:38:18.620]  when I talk about the deep state
[3:38:18.620 --> 3:38:20.620]  I'm talking about all of these ways
[3:38:20.620 --> 3:38:22.620]  in which
[3:38:22.620 --> 3:38:24.620]  a regular
[3:38:24.620 --> 3:38:26.620]  which has a certain degree
[3:38:26.620 --> 3:38:28.620]  of openness to it
[3:38:28.620 --> 3:38:30.620]  is being supplanted by
[3:38:30.620 --> 3:38:32.620]  special arrangements which are secret
[3:38:32.620 --> 3:38:34.620]  in which we cannot see the details
[3:38:34.620 --> 3:38:36.620]  but doesn't that say the fact
[3:38:36.620 --> 3:38:38.620]  that they take over
[3:38:38.620 --> 3:38:40.620]  25 agencies and dealing with
[3:38:40.620 --> 3:38:42.620]  intelligence and law enforcement and security
[3:38:42.620 --> 3:38:44.620]  put into Homeland Security
[3:38:44.620 --> 3:38:46.620]  but then Bush doesn't even trust that
[3:38:46.620 --> 3:38:48.620]  the executive drags it in even closer
[3:38:48.620 --> 3:38:50.620]  to a tiny eye of authority
[3:38:50.620 --> 3:38:52.620]  and then he's got all the cronies
[3:38:52.620 --> 3:38:54.620]  and special interests behind him
[3:38:54.620 --> 3:38:56.620]  I mean that shows to me
[3:38:56.620 --> 3:38:58.620]  and we've also seen the news
[3:38:58.620 --> 3:39:00.620]  that that is a byproduct of resistance
[3:39:00.620 --> 3:39:02.620]  within the bureaucracy
[3:39:02.620 --> 3:39:04.620]  I suspect that the real
[3:39:04.620 --> 3:39:06.620]  center of power there is going to be
[3:39:06.620 --> 3:39:08.620]  the vice president's office
[3:39:08.620 --> 3:39:10.620]  because one of the changes
[3:39:10.620 --> 3:39:12.620]  since 9-11 has been
[3:39:12.620 --> 3:39:14.620]  the expansion of the vice president's
[3:39:14.620 --> 3:39:16.620]  office into a kind of
[3:39:16.620 --> 3:39:18.620]  nerve center
[3:39:18.620 --> 3:39:20.620]  for the whole of government
[3:39:20.620 --> 3:39:22.620]  which it would never was
[3:39:22.620 --> 3:39:24.620]  remotely anything like that before
[3:39:24.620 --> 3:39:26.620]  and then the second thing
[3:39:26.620 --> 3:39:28.620]  is the outsourcing
[3:39:28.620 --> 3:39:30.620]  I think you mentioned yourself earlier on
[3:39:30.620 --> 3:39:32.620]  in this show
[3:39:32.620 --> 3:39:34.620]  how functions like surveillance
[3:39:34.620 --> 3:39:36.620]  of American citizens
[3:39:36.620 --> 3:39:38.620]  are now being outsourced
[3:39:38.620 --> 3:39:40.620]  to private companies
[3:39:40.620 --> 3:39:42.620]  like SAIC
[3:39:42.620 --> 3:39:44.620]  and San Diego
[3:39:44.620 --> 3:39:46.620]  No, I didn't hear the first hour
[3:39:46.620 --> 3:39:48.620]  but I think you made a quick
[3:39:48.620 --> 3:39:50.620]  reference to it when you were talking
[3:39:50.620 --> 3:39:52.620]  about the first hour
[3:39:52.620 --> 3:39:54.620]  and yes, this is extremely important
[3:39:54.620 --> 3:39:56.620]  when we have black water
[3:39:56.620 --> 3:39:58.620]  in a sense
[3:39:58.620 --> 3:40:00.620]  conducting warfare overseas
[3:40:00.620 --> 3:40:02.620]  and not only that
[3:40:02.620 --> 3:40:04.620]  but you know black water was armed
[3:40:04.620 --> 3:40:06.620]  and in the streets
[3:40:06.620 --> 3:40:08.620]  of New Orleans
[3:40:08.620 --> 3:40:10.620]  after Katrina
[3:40:10.620 --> 3:40:12.620]  certainly Congress never had
[3:40:12.620 --> 3:40:14.620]  any say in that that I know of
[3:40:14.620 --> 3:40:16.620]  and
[3:40:16.620 --> 3:40:18.620]  then you've got
[3:40:18.620 --> 3:40:20.620]  the surveillance
[3:40:20.620 --> 3:40:22.620]  of Americans being entrusted to
[3:40:22.620 --> 3:40:24.620]  private corporations
[3:40:24.620 --> 3:40:26.620]  there's a real conflict of interest
[3:40:26.620 --> 3:40:28.620]  here there because
[3:40:28.620 --> 3:40:30.620]  it's then their interest to magnify
[3:40:30.620 --> 3:40:32.620]  the perceived threat to
[3:40:32.620 --> 3:40:34.620]  government so that they can magnify
[3:40:34.620 --> 3:40:36.620]  their budget to go on
[3:40:36.620 --> 3:40:38.620]  surveilling us and Alex I imagine
[3:40:38.620 --> 3:40:40.620]  that they listen to your phone in mind
[3:40:40.620 --> 3:40:42.620]  and they aren't even the government
[3:40:42.620 --> 3:40:44.620]  and they make money out of it
[3:40:44.620 --> 3:40:46.620]  they are for profit
[3:40:46.620 --> 3:40:48.620]  corporations
[3:40:48.620 --> 3:40:50.620]  and again I am so
[3:40:50.620 --> 3:40:52.620]  disappointed that
[3:40:52.620 --> 3:40:54.620]  Congress has been very lethargic
[3:40:54.620 --> 3:40:56.620]  in dealing with these very rapid changes
[3:40:56.620 --> 3:40:58.620]  which
[3:40:58.620 --> 3:41:00.620]  are
[3:41:00.620 --> 3:41:02.620]  you see what really counts
[3:41:02.620 --> 3:41:04.620]  at bottom of all this is
[3:41:04.620 --> 3:41:06.620]  that there are some people who feel
[3:41:06.620 --> 3:41:08.620]  that America should run an empire
[3:41:08.620 --> 3:41:10.620]  in every continent
[3:41:10.620 --> 3:41:12.620]  of the world
[3:41:12.620 --> 3:41:14.620]  and have U.S. troops
[3:41:14.620 --> 3:41:16.620]  in places like Georgia
[3:41:16.620 --> 3:41:18.620]  in Kyrgyzstan which is on the Chinese
[3:41:18.620 --> 3:41:20.620]  border
[3:41:20.620 --> 3:41:22.620]  and you know
[3:41:22.620 --> 3:41:24.620]  if there was democratic discussion of this
[3:41:24.620 --> 3:41:26.620]  I think
[3:41:26.620 --> 3:41:28.620]  saner voices would establish
[3:41:28.620 --> 3:41:30.620]  that this is not in our interest
[3:41:30.620 --> 3:41:32.620]  I mean what's happened in Georgia
[3:41:32.620 --> 3:41:34.620]  in the last month
[3:41:34.620 --> 3:41:36.620]  is a clear illustration
[3:41:36.620 --> 3:41:38.620]  of the madness the insanity
[3:41:38.620 --> 3:41:40.620]  of sticking
[3:41:40.620 --> 3:41:42.620]  our troops in remote corners
[3:41:42.620 --> 3:41:44.620]  where we can't
[3:41:44.620 --> 3:41:46.620]  ultimately back them up with anything
[3:41:46.620 --> 3:41:48.620]  short of a nuclear war
[3:41:48.620 --> 3:41:50.620]  these policies aren't discussed
[3:41:50.620 --> 3:41:52.620]  they're just done by
[3:41:52.620 --> 3:41:54.620]  small inter bureaucracies
[3:41:54.620 --> 3:41:56.620]  and
[3:41:56.620 --> 3:41:58.620]  in order to maintain
[3:41:58.620 --> 3:42:00.620]  the fabric of empire
[3:42:00.620 --> 3:42:02.620]  you've ultimately got to contain
[3:42:02.620 --> 3:42:04.620]  and curtail the forces
[3:42:04.620 --> 3:42:06.620]  of democracy
[3:42:06.620 --> 3:42:08.620]  in the whole country
[3:42:08.620 --> 3:42:10.620]  they have to seize control of the central empire
[3:42:10.620 --> 3:42:12.620]  of the homeland
[3:42:12.620 --> 3:42:14.620]  to ensure that they have this engine
[3:42:14.620 --> 3:42:16.620]  to go around dominating the planet
[3:42:16.620 --> 3:42:18.620]  and that was my next question
[3:42:18.620 --> 3:42:20.620]  there is such a contempt by government
[3:42:20.620 --> 3:42:22.620]  and the orders we know
[3:42:22.620 --> 3:42:24.620]  have gone out, it's even come out in New York
[3:42:24.620 --> 3:42:26.620]  to squeeze and boss and push
[3:42:26.620 --> 3:42:28.620]  and not be like servants
[3:42:28.620 --> 3:42:30.620]  and to let the public know the government's the boss
[3:42:30.620 --> 3:42:32.620]  and I've been in D.C., New York
[3:42:32.620 --> 3:42:34.620]  other places but also in London
[3:42:34.620 --> 3:42:36.620]  and you'll just watch
[3:42:36.620 --> 3:42:38.620]  police walk over rudely to a crowd in the middle
[3:42:38.620 --> 3:42:40.620]  of a park doing nothing and just yell at them
[3:42:40.620 --> 3:42:42.620]  like they're scum
[3:42:42.620 --> 3:42:44.620]  so that order has gone out
[3:42:44.620 --> 3:42:46.620]  and I know you just covered scientifically
[3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:48.620]  what you can
[3:42:48.620 --> 3:42:50.620]  from a sociological perspective cover
[3:42:50.620 --> 3:42:52.620]  but
[3:42:52.620 --> 3:42:54.620]  you can see it, they're gearing up for
[3:42:54.620 --> 3:42:56.620]  something big and the indigenous
[3:42:56.620 --> 3:42:58.620]  populations of the empire, the empire
[3:42:58.620 --> 3:43:00.620]  Oceania and of course
[3:43:00.620 --> 3:43:02.620]  North America, some parts of Europe
[3:43:02.620 --> 3:43:04.620]  is the main target
[3:43:04.620 --> 3:43:06.620]  and there's this larger global deep state
[3:43:06.620 --> 3:43:08.620]  putting in the same control
[3:43:08.620 --> 3:43:10.620]  grids, the same surveillance, the same biometrics
[3:43:10.620 --> 3:43:12.620]  internationally
[3:43:12.620 --> 3:43:14.620]  standardized with the UN, the UN likes
[3:43:14.620 --> 3:43:16.620]  to act like, they're separate from the US
[3:43:16.620 --> 3:43:18.620]  but founded by the deep state in 55
[3:43:18.620 --> 3:43:20.620]  I mean
[3:43:20.620 --> 3:43:22.620]  it's
[3:43:22.620 --> 3:43:24.620]  I'm not as apocalyptic about this
[3:43:24.620 --> 3:43:26.620]  as you are Alex
[3:43:26.620 --> 3:43:28.620]  because you know
[3:43:28.620 --> 3:43:30.620]  I've lived in many countries
[3:43:30.620 --> 3:43:32.620]  and it's still true
[3:43:32.620 --> 3:43:34.620]  of America
[3:43:34.620 --> 3:43:36.620]  as it was when I first came here
[3:43:36.620 --> 3:43:38.620]  in 61
[3:43:38.620 --> 3:43:40.620]  1961, it may not be quite as
[3:43:40.620 --> 3:43:42.620]  true now as it was then
[3:43:42.620 --> 3:43:44.620]  but this is still basically a country
[3:43:44.620 --> 3:43:46.620]  that I feel more secure
[3:43:46.620 --> 3:43:48.620]  in these of these of the police
[3:43:48.620 --> 3:43:50.620]  I agree with you what I'm saying is the direction
[3:43:50.620 --> 3:43:52.620]  it's going, okay listen
[3:43:52.620 --> 3:43:54.620]  it's apocalyptic to me that the majority
[3:43:54.620 --> 3:43:56.620]  of narcotics are shipped in here
[3:43:56.620 --> 3:43:58.620]  by government approved
[3:43:58.620 --> 3:44:00.620]  groups and the people they go attack
[3:44:00.620 --> 3:44:02.620]  or raid overseas
[3:44:02.620 --> 3:44:04.620]  or down south are the cartels that don't
[3:44:04.620 --> 3:44:06.620]  play ball I mean that's
[3:44:06.620 --> 3:44:08.620]  I mean that's apocalyptic to have them
[3:44:08.620 --> 3:44:10.620]  putting people in prison for drugs they shipped in
[3:44:10.620 --> 3:44:12.620]  it's apocalyptic to me to have them
[3:44:12.620 --> 3:44:14.620]  sneak attacking Russia
[3:44:14.620 --> 3:44:16.620]  two weeks ago I mean
[3:44:16.620 --> 3:44:18.620]  a million two dead Iraqis is apocalyptic
[3:44:18.620 --> 3:44:20.620]  and
[3:44:20.620 --> 3:44:22.620]  they admitted in the Houston Chronicle
[3:44:22.620 --> 3:44:24.620]  those FEMA camps were also for
[3:44:24.620 --> 3:44:26.620]  you know American citizens too
[3:44:26.620 --> 3:44:28.620]  and I mean I agree that
[3:44:28.620 --> 3:44:30.620]  we still got a lot of good left in this country
[3:44:30.620 --> 3:44:32.620]  and that other nations are bad or worse
[3:44:32.620 --> 3:44:34.620]  I'm saying I was saying it's global
[3:44:34.620 --> 3:44:36.620]  well you know if you go back
[3:44:36.620 --> 3:44:38.620]  the first big plan
[3:44:38.620 --> 3:44:40.620]  for massive detention
[3:44:40.620 --> 3:44:42.620]  was Oliver North
[3:44:42.620 --> 3:44:44.620]  and Oliver North
[3:44:44.620 --> 3:44:46.620]  he ran into
[3:44:46.620 --> 3:44:48.620]  opposition from
[3:44:48.620 --> 3:44:50.620]  Reagan's own attorney general
[3:44:50.620 --> 3:44:52.620]  now it's true that that attorney general
[3:44:52.620 --> 3:44:54.620]  then quickly resigned
[3:44:54.620 --> 3:44:56.620]  and another one came
[3:44:56.620 --> 3:44:58.620]  was that nice
[3:44:58.620 --> 3:45:00.620]  and were put on hold
[3:45:00.620 --> 3:45:02.620]  and
[3:45:02.620 --> 3:45:04.620]  Congress
[3:45:04.620 --> 3:45:06.620]  role there is
[3:45:06.620 --> 3:45:08.620]  very iffy on the one hand
[3:45:08.620 --> 3:45:10.620]  North was asked about this
[3:45:10.620 --> 3:45:12.620]  in the Iran contrary hearings
[3:45:12.620 --> 3:45:14.620]  is it true you're praying for the suspension
[3:45:14.620 --> 3:45:16.620]  of the American Constitution
[3:45:16.620 --> 3:45:18.620]  and the amazing
[3:45:18.620 --> 3:45:20.620]  response of the chairman
[3:45:20.620 --> 3:45:22.620]  who was a Democrat senator in Noyan
[3:45:22.620 --> 3:45:24.620]  by the way basically
[3:45:24.620 --> 3:45:26.620]  a fairly decent senator
[3:45:26.620 --> 3:45:28.620]  but his response was
[3:45:28.620 --> 3:45:30.620]  if we're going to talk about that
[3:45:30.620 --> 3:45:32.620]  we have to go into a secret session
[3:45:32.620 --> 3:45:34.620]  so he in a sense
[3:45:34.620 --> 3:45:36.620]  was protecting the secret system
[3:45:36.620 --> 3:45:38.620]  giving it priority
[3:45:38.620 --> 3:45:40.620]  over the importance
[3:45:40.620 --> 3:45:42.620]  of exposing it by the public
[3:45:42.620 --> 3:45:44.620]  but then Congress was let in
[3:45:44.620 --> 3:45:46.620]  on it now they're not
[3:45:46.620 --> 3:45:48.620]  which shows a major shift
[3:45:48.620 --> 3:45:50.620]  I just don't know to what extent
[3:45:50.620 --> 3:45:52.620]  I suspect that there are a few people
[3:45:52.620 --> 3:45:54.620]  in the intelligence committees
[3:45:54.620 --> 3:45:56.620]  but again
[3:45:56.620 --> 3:45:58.620]  all I know is
[3:45:58.620 --> 3:46:00.620]  that there is a problem and there is no
[3:46:00.620 --> 3:46:02.620]  very little public response
[3:46:02.620 --> 3:46:04.620]  and particularly in
[3:46:04.620 --> 3:46:06.620]  August of 2007
[3:46:06.620 --> 3:46:08.620]  Congress should have said
[3:46:08.620 --> 3:46:10.620]  Homeland Security Committee has the right
[3:46:10.620 --> 3:46:12.620]  to see those things
[3:46:12.620 --> 3:46:14.620]  and in not saying that
[3:46:14.620 --> 3:46:16.620]  it was virtually
[3:46:16.620 --> 3:46:18.620]  acknowledging that we're in a new era
[3:46:18.620 --> 3:46:20.620]  where secret papers
[3:46:20.620 --> 3:46:22.620]  have taken priority over
[3:46:22.620 --> 3:46:24.620]  the American Constitution
[3:46:24.620 --> 3:46:26.620]  well you say
[3:46:26.620 --> 3:46:28.620]  that you don't see it as apocalyptic
[3:46:28.620 --> 3:46:30.620]  as I see it how do you see the future
[3:46:30.620 --> 3:46:32.620]  is it rosy or
[3:46:32.620 --> 3:46:34.620]  what do you see happening
[3:46:34.620 --> 3:46:36.620]  well
[3:46:36.620 --> 3:46:38.620]  it depends which day of the week
[3:46:38.620 --> 3:46:40.620]  Alex
[3:46:40.620 --> 3:46:42.620]  some days I am
[3:46:42.620 --> 3:46:44.620]  very pessimistic
[3:46:44.620 --> 3:46:46.620]  but you know I think it's healthy
[3:46:46.620 --> 3:46:48.620]  to have powerful ability
[3:46:48.620 --> 3:46:50.620]  capacity
[3:46:50.620 --> 3:46:52.620]  for denial
[3:46:52.620 --> 3:46:54.620]  that's what makes me write my books
[3:46:54.620 --> 3:46:56.620]  as long as I can go on writing my books
[3:46:56.620 --> 3:46:58.620]  and here's an even more important public thing
[3:46:58.620 --> 3:47:00.620]  as long as the internet
[3:47:00.620 --> 3:47:02.620]  is allowing us
[3:47:02.620 --> 3:47:04.620]  to discuss these things
[3:47:04.620 --> 3:47:06.620]  openly then we are not
[3:47:06.620 --> 3:47:08.620]  in a fascist state
[3:47:08.620 --> 3:47:10.620]  but you know now they're moving
[3:47:10.620 --> 3:47:12.620]  with a multi-headed Hydra openly saying
[3:47:12.620 --> 3:47:14.620]  they want to shut down what we know
[3:47:14.620 --> 3:47:16.620]  is the web today with a cocktail of attacks
[3:47:16.620 --> 3:47:18.620]  that's quite true
[3:47:18.620 --> 3:47:20.620]  that there are some people who want to do this
[3:47:20.620 --> 3:47:22.620]  but the nice thing about this litmus test
[3:47:22.620 --> 3:47:24.620]  for our society is
[3:47:24.620 --> 3:47:26.620]  that if that does happen
[3:47:26.620 --> 3:47:28.620]  if they shut it down and we can't
[3:47:28.620 --> 3:47:30.620]  communicate with each other
[3:47:30.620 --> 3:47:32.620]  we at least will know it
[3:47:32.620 --> 3:47:34.620]  now you might say that's when it's too late
[3:47:34.620 --> 3:47:36.620]  and you can fold your tents
[3:47:36.620 --> 3:47:38.620]  but it's not too late
[3:47:38.620 --> 3:47:40.620]  at present I think that
[3:47:40.620 --> 3:47:42.620]  the real test ultimately
[3:47:42.620 --> 3:47:44.620]  is going to be how much do the American people care
[3:47:44.620 --> 3:47:46.620]  you care
[3:47:46.620 --> 3:47:48.620]  and I care and there are really
[3:47:48.620 --> 3:47:50.620]  thousands of people who care
[3:47:50.620 --> 3:47:52.620]  but then there are millions of people
[3:47:52.620 --> 3:47:54.620]  who don't care and the question
[3:47:54.620 --> 3:47:56.620]  is whether we can reach those millions
[3:47:56.620 --> 3:47:58.620]  that are enough of them
[3:47:58.620 --> 3:48:00.620]  to create a change
[3:48:00.620 --> 3:48:02.620]  mentality in congress and I think
[3:48:02.620 --> 3:48:04.620]  that you know it's really important
[3:48:04.620 --> 3:48:06.620]  to be talking about this right now
[3:48:06.620 --> 3:48:08.620]  because we have an election
[3:48:08.620 --> 3:48:10.620]  we've got candidates who are coming
[3:48:10.620 --> 3:48:12.620]  and talking to the people I think
[3:48:12.620 --> 3:48:14.620]  everyone who knows about COG
[3:48:14.620 --> 3:48:16.620]  should be asking
[3:48:16.620 --> 3:48:18.620]  the candidates in their district
[3:48:18.620 --> 3:48:20.620]  what is their position on COG
[3:48:20.620 --> 3:48:22.620]  make it a big issue
[3:48:22.620 --> 3:48:24.620]  I totally agree with you
[3:48:24.620 --> 3:48:26.620]  excellent point
[3:48:26.620 --> 3:48:28.620]  and this is where
[3:48:28.620 --> 3:48:30.620]  every now and then the American people
[3:48:30.620 --> 3:48:32.620]  are part of the system
[3:48:32.620 --> 3:48:34.620]  and between now and November
[3:48:34.620 --> 3:48:36.620]  they have the power to ask these questions
[3:48:36.620 --> 3:48:38.620]  and to punish
[3:48:38.620 --> 3:48:40.620]  the candidates
[3:48:40.620 --> 3:48:42.620]  in a strong position
[3:48:42.620 --> 3:48:44.620]  against the super
[3:48:44.620 --> 3:48:46.620]  the overriding of the Constitution
[3:48:46.620 --> 3:48:48.620]  by a set of secret orders
[3:48:48.620 --> 3:48:50.620]  Peter Dell Scott is our guest
[3:48:50.620 --> 3:48:52.620]  Peter I'm going to skip this break
[3:48:52.620 --> 3:48:54.620]  for the network
[3:48:54.620 --> 3:48:56.620]  and the infowars.com
[3:48:56.620 --> 3:48:58.620]  streams you'll be able to hear this little final three minute
[3:48:58.620 --> 3:49:00.620]  segment with Peter
[3:49:00.620 --> 3:49:02.620]  and we'll come back in the final segment for the full audience
[3:49:02.620 --> 3:49:04.620]  here in just a moment but before we go to this break
[3:49:04.620 --> 3:49:06.620]  and then
[3:49:06.620 --> 3:49:08.620]  just address the infowars.com listeners
[3:49:08.620 --> 3:49:10.620]  and prismbond.tv viewers
[3:49:10.620 --> 3:49:12.620]  as I don't want to waste any time with you Peter
[3:49:12.620 --> 3:49:14.620]  give out your website talk about those two new books
[3:49:14.620 --> 3:49:16.620]  I want to have you back soon
[3:49:16.620 --> 3:49:18.620]  to talk just about the road to 9-11
[3:49:18.620 --> 3:49:20.620]  okay are we saying goodbye at this point?
[3:49:20.620 --> 3:49:22.620]  no no no no
[3:49:22.620 --> 3:49:24.620]  I'm now skipping breaks
[3:49:24.620 --> 3:49:26.620]  just on the internet side
[3:49:26.620 --> 3:49:28.620]  and so that
[3:49:28.620 --> 3:49:30.620]  I have full time and then we put it on the web
[3:49:30.620 --> 3:49:32.620]  it's live too but no
[3:49:32.620 --> 3:49:34.620]  we're on the air right now we're not saying bye
[3:49:34.620 --> 3:49:36.620]  and so if you're inviting me to say
[3:49:36.620 --> 3:49:38.620]  first of all I want to repeat that
[3:49:38.620 --> 3:49:40.620]  my website is
[3:49:40.620 --> 3:49:42.620]  www.peterdalescot.net
[3:49:42.620 --> 3:49:44.620]  where I have a lot more
[3:49:44.620 --> 3:49:46.620]  about these things but
[3:49:46.620 --> 3:49:48.620]  you can just google for me
[3:49:48.620 --> 3:49:50.620]  if you google for Peter Dale Scott
[3:49:50.620 --> 3:49:52.620]  the first thing that comes up
[3:49:52.620 --> 3:49:54.620]  is my website
[3:49:54.620 --> 3:49:56.620]  now in my newest
[3:49:56.620 --> 3:49:58.620]  book the war conspiracy
[3:49:58.620 --> 3:50:00.620]  first of all in the road to 9-11
[3:50:00.620 --> 3:50:02.620]  I lay out
[3:50:02.620 --> 3:50:04.620]  the conditions
[3:50:04.620 --> 3:50:06.620]  under which
[3:50:06.620 --> 3:50:08.620]  COG planning has gone on
[3:50:08.620 --> 3:50:10.620]  for twenty years
[3:50:10.620 --> 3:50:12.620]  and how it
[3:50:12.620 --> 3:50:14.620]  instituted on
[3:50:14.620 --> 3:50:16.620]  September the 11th
[3:50:16.620 --> 3:50:18.620]  a lot of people who are studying
[3:50:18.620 --> 3:50:20.620]  9-11 are not aware
[3:50:20.620 --> 3:50:22.620]  that the chief political consequence
[3:50:22.620 --> 3:50:24.620]  of it was COG
[3:50:24.620 --> 3:50:26.620]  and this is absolutely key we're going to keep talking about it right now
[3:50:26.620 --> 3:50:28.620]  exclusively
[3:50:28.620 --> 3:50:30.620]  for infowars.com listeners
[3:50:30.620 --> 3:50:32.620]  Peter please continue
[3:50:32.620 --> 3:50:34.620]  on the internet feed right now
[3:50:34.620 --> 3:50:36.620]  but it's hundreds of thousands
[3:50:36.620 --> 3:50:38.620]  listening for free and over 10,000 watching
[3:50:38.620 --> 3:50:40.620]  now I understand
[3:50:40.620 --> 3:50:42.620]  and that's what I should have you back up about
[3:50:42.620 --> 3:50:44.620]  for a full hour
[3:50:44.620 --> 3:50:46.620]  without getting into
[3:50:46.620 --> 3:50:48.620]  you're right it was implemented then
[3:50:48.620 --> 3:50:50.620]  we are currently under COG
[3:50:50.620 --> 3:50:52.620]  explain that to people
[3:50:52.620 --> 3:50:54.620]  I've only had two favorable reviews
[3:50:54.620 --> 3:50:56.620]  and both of them
[3:50:56.620 --> 3:50:58.620]  didn't believe me when I said it
[3:50:58.620 --> 3:51:00.620]  but it's an absolute matter of fact
[3:51:00.620 --> 3:51:02.620]  twice in the 9-11 report
[3:51:02.620 --> 3:51:04.620]  that it was instituted
[3:51:04.620 --> 3:51:06.620]  and we can even time it
[3:51:06.620 --> 3:51:08.620]  to shortly before 10 o'clock
[3:51:08.620 --> 3:51:10.620]  on the morning of
[3:51:10.620 --> 3:51:12.620]  September the 11th
[3:51:12.620 --> 3:51:14.620]  and we know the five big aircraft that run it
[3:51:14.620 --> 3:51:16.620]  the doomsday planes were flying around
[3:51:16.620 --> 3:51:18.620]  yes give us the proof the facts
[3:51:18.620 --> 3:51:20.620]  that it was implemented
[3:51:20.620 --> 3:51:22.620]  well no I'd rather talk a bit about my
[3:51:22.620 --> 3:51:24.620]  because I've really sort of shot my bolt on that
[3:51:24.620 --> 3:51:26.620]  you know I have many other things
[3:51:26.620 --> 3:51:28.620]  to say in the road to 9-11
[3:51:28.620 --> 3:51:30.620]  but my knowledge about
[3:51:30.620 --> 3:51:32.620]  what happened on that day
[3:51:32.620 --> 3:51:34.620]  contained in two chapters
[3:51:34.620 --> 3:51:36.620]  no but I meant specifically about
[3:51:36.620 --> 3:51:38.620]  continuity of government being implemented
[3:51:38.620 --> 3:51:40.620]  well there was a
[3:51:40.620 --> 3:51:42.620]  a three part order
[3:51:42.620 --> 3:51:44.620]  Richard Clark
[3:51:44.620 --> 3:51:46.620]  talks about it in his book
[3:51:46.620 --> 3:51:48.620]  Against All Enemies
[3:51:48.620 --> 3:51:50.620]  but the 9-11 report echoes
[3:51:50.620 --> 3:51:52.620]  him on this
[3:51:52.620 --> 3:51:54.620]  there was an order the first part is
[3:51:54.620 --> 3:51:56.620]  innocuous which was to provide
[3:51:56.620 --> 3:51:58.620]  a rescord for the president's plane
[3:51:58.620 --> 3:52:00.620]  the second one
[3:52:00.620 --> 3:52:02.620]  was
[3:52:02.620 --> 3:52:04.620]  the important thing
[3:52:04.620 --> 3:52:06.620]  was that the second one was to
[3:52:06.620 --> 3:52:08.620]  implement COG
[3:52:08.620 --> 3:52:10.620]  and so there's
[3:52:10.620 --> 3:52:12.620]  no doubting that it happened
[3:52:12.620 --> 3:52:14.620]  if I could say a word about my other
[3:52:14.620 --> 3:52:16.620]  book the war conspiracy
[3:52:16.620 --> 3:52:18.620]  a lot of it's about
[3:52:18.620 --> 3:52:20.620]  Vietnam and is historical
[3:52:20.620 --> 3:52:22.620]  but the end of it
[3:52:22.620 --> 3:52:24.620]  is about
[3:52:24.620 --> 3:52:26.620]  disturbing similarities
[3:52:26.620 --> 3:52:28.620]  between the assassination
[3:52:28.620 --> 3:52:30.620]  of President Kennedy
[3:52:30.620 --> 3:52:32.620]  and the way in which
[3:52:32.620 --> 3:52:34.620]  9-11 was instituted
[3:52:34.620 --> 3:52:36.620]  and I talk about
[3:52:36.620 --> 3:52:38.620]  designated suspects
[3:52:38.620 --> 3:52:40.620]  I say that Oswald was a designated
[3:52:40.620 --> 3:52:42.620]  suspect because the CIA
[3:52:42.620 --> 3:52:44.620]  had been doing something with him
[3:52:44.620 --> 3:52:46.620]  and whoever was responsible
[3:52:46.620 --> 3:52:48.620]  for the Kennedy assassination
[3:52:48.620 --> 3:52:50.620]  knew
[3:52:50.620 --> 3:52:52.620]  that there would not be a proper
[3:52:52.620 --> 3:52:54.620]  investigation because of the
[3:52:54.620 --> 3:52:56.620]  intelligence involvement with Oswald
[3:52:56.620 --> 3:52:58.620]  and the same is true
[3:52:58.620 --> 3:53:00.620]  of 9-11
[3:53:00.620 --> 3:53:02.620]  now I'm telescoping a great many similarities
[3:53:02.620 --> 3:53:04.620]  but a key one
[3:53:04.620 --> 3:53:06.620]  is that at least two
[3:53:06.620 --> 3:53:08.620]  and probably more of the alleged
[3:53:08.620 --> 3:53:10.620]  assassins
[3:53:10.620 --> 3:53:12.620]  I mean hijackers
[3:53:12.620 --> 3:53:14.620]  were of
[3:53:14.620 --> 3:53:16.620]  such interest to the CIA
[3:53:16.620 --> 3:53:18.620]  that in both cases
[3:53:18.620 --> 3:53:20.620]  Oswald in
[3:53:20.620 --> 3:53:22.620]  2003 and
[3:53:22.620 --> 3:53:24.620]  Al-Nidar and Al-Hazmi
[3:53:24.620 --> 3:53:26.620]  in 2000 information
[3:53:26.620 --> 3:53:28.620]  that the CIA ought to have given
[3:53:28.620 --> 3:53:30.620]  to the FBI they didn't give
[3:53:30.620 --> 3:53:32.620]  stay there, stay there we'll come back
[3:53:32.620 --> 3:53:34.620]  to the full audience I've got to have you back in the near future
[3:53:34.620 --> 3:53:36.620]  here we go
[3:53:40.620 --> 3:53:42.620]  well I got to have
[3:53:42.620 --> 3:53:44.620]  Peter Dell Scott back soon for another hour
[3:53:44.620 --> 3:53:46.620]  just to get into his war conspiracy
[3:53:46.620 --> 3:53:48.620]  book he was talking about similarities
[3:53:48.620 --> 3:53:50.620]  between the way they ran the JFK assassination
[3:53:50.620 --> 3:53:52.620]  and the way the Black Ops ran
[3:53:52.620 --> 3:53:54.620]  9-11 all those telltale signs
[3:53:54.620 --> 3:53:56.620]  the cover-ups, the activities
[3:53:56.620 --> 3:53:58.620]  the supposed assassin, the hijackers
[3:53:58.620 --> 3:54:00.620]  Springman
[3:54:00.620 --> 3:54:02.620]  you know the head of the
[3:54:02.620 --> 3:54:04.620]  VISA section he's in our new film Fabled Enemies
[3:54:04.620 --> 3:54:06.620]  you can pre-order right now comes out in about a week and a half
[3:54:06.620 --> 3:54:08.620]  again
[3:54:08.620 --> 3:54:10.620]  at infowars.com
[3:54:10.620 --> 3:54:12.620]  you have Springman right there and he's going I'm not letting him in
[3:54:12.620 --> 3:54:14.620]  they're listed as terrorists and he's told no no no
[3:54:14.620 --> 3:54:16.620]  that's a cover for their
[3:54:16.620 --> 3:54:18.620]  national security jobs
[3:54:18.620 --> 3:54:20.620]  this is CIA let him in
[3:54:20.620 --> 3:54:22.620]  I mean that and trained at the
[3:54:22.620 --> 3:54:24.620]  defense bases and in spy training
[3:54:24.620 --> 3:54:26.620]  and that's all admitted
[3:54:26.620 --> 3:54:28.620]  and the government just says well we're not going to talk about that
[3:54:28.620 --> 3:54:30.620]  and boy I've got to read your two
[3:54:30.620 --> 3:54:32.620]  new books I read
[3:54:32.620 --> 3:54:34.620]  one of your books it must have been 10 years ago
[3:54:34.620 --> 3:54:36.620]  you know just about
[3:54:36.620 --> 3:54:38.620]  the government shipping and the drugs
[3:54:38.620 --> 3:54:40.620]  and then I read it I mean you've written so many
[3:54:40.620 --> 3:54:42.620]  books but these two new ones

[3:54:44.620 --> 3:54:46.620]  read my best books
[3:54:46.620 --> 3:54:48.620]  you know I used to the other books I was teaching
[3:54:48.620 --> 3:54:50.620]  then I wrote them
[3:54:50.620 --> 3:54:52.620]  late at night in my spare time
[3:54:52.620 --> 3:54:54.620]  these books I
[3:54:54.620 --> 3:54:56.620]  spent six years on the road to 9-11
[3:54:56.620 --> 3:54:58.620]  and
[3:54:58.620 --> 3:55:00.620]  all of my decades of
[3:55:00.620 --> 3:55:02.620]  thinking has gone into the reissue
[3:55:02.620 --> 3:55:04.620]  of the war conspiracy
[3:55:04.620 --> 3:55:06.620]  so thank you Alex
