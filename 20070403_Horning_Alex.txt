[00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:18.425]  Alright, coming up, we'll continue with your calls, get into the Fox News, O'Reilly slash Rosie slash Charlie Sheen slash Loose Change soap opera.
[00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:24.266]  But right now, we're joined by Diane Horning.
[00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:30.448]  Kurt Horning and his wife Diane Horning of Scotch Plains, whose son Matthew was killed on 9-11.
[00:00:32.046 --> 00:00:32.446]  We're good.
[00:00:53.462 --> 00:00:57.444]  That the remains of victims of 9-11 were being used in potholes.
[00:00:57.444 --> 00:01:02.306]  Associated Press reported 9-11 remains possibly used on roads, court papers.
[00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:17.172]  I remember all the video of them loading the trucks with the quote, aggregate, with like bone pieces and they've now found, just a few months ago, they found bones in nearby buildings that were blown out of the buildings.
[00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:18.472]  How'd that happen with a collapse?
[00:01:18.472 --> 00:01:19.433]  Man, bodies...
[00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:25.303]  I hate to talk like this, her son died in the horrible attacks.
[00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:27.284]  But I mean, this is the facts here.
[00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:35.026]  And they won't let anybody into the landfills, but now photos have been snuck out of, you know, piles of, you know, shoes and parts and what looks like bones.
[00:01:35.026 --> 00:01:38.186]  And they filed suit over it.
[00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:40.487]  The government's trying to throw the suits out.
[00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:42.107]  I mean, this just shows how cold-blooded they are.
[00:01:42.107 --> 00:01:45.728]  They don't even want to give a proper burial to these people.
[00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:49.169]  And then, hey, we're going to use it to cover the roads, mix in with the asphalt.
[00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:59.540]  It just goes to the mind, and of course, not give treatment for those that have breathed the asbestos and concrete when the EPA's own internal reports that they were going to die.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.382]  And they just said, you're not sick, go home and die.
[00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:03.503]  And they do go home and die.
[00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:09.746]  So it's just government again, just like Katrina, anywhere else, this is who's going to supposedly take care of you.
[00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:11.347]  Now that's my intro.
[00:02:11.347 --> 00:02:14.529]  Diane Horning, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:15.230]  Oh, thank you.
[00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.651]  Thank you for including our mission.
[00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:23.554]  Yeah, the Fresh Kills landfill has human body parts in it.
[00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:44.582]  I think that our court papers very clearly, through affidavits of people who worked there during this ten months that it was operational, have told us that in the first, specifically the first five weeks, they were planning to do this as a salvage operation.
[00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:46.783]  They were not even thinking of human remains.
[00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:56.814]  Giuliani wanted the World Trade Center site emptied out as quickly as possible, as cheaply as possible, so he could look like the can-do guy.
[00:02:56.814 --> 00:03:00.115]  And in doing that, he scooped and dumped.
[00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:06.078]  Instead of hunting for remains where they were, they took it to the landfill and essentially set up to salvage.
[00:03:06.078 --> 00:03:08.479]  In other words, they were separating out metals.
[00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.079]  What was going to go to the salvage yards?
[00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.020]  What was going to get out of there fast and furious?
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.822]  And in doing that, in the first five weeks or so, suddenly,
[00:03:17.812 --> 00:03:26.698]  Seagulls started to inundate the area, and they began to realize that there was only one thing the seagulls were after, and that was human bodies.
[00:03:26.698 --> 00:03:36.564]  And so it was at that point that someone, a firm from Rockland County, New York, or Orange County, New York, came down, said, look, we've got sifting equipment.
[00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:38.105]  We could do a better job.
[00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:39.145]  Let us demonstrate.
[00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:39.886]  They did.
[00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:44.949]  And after about five weeks, they began a sifting process, which helped make it better.
[00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.570]  But in those initial five weeks,
[00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:54.919]  They were just dumping things over the edge into the landfill and it was the most recently used part of the landfill.
[00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.342]  It had been accepting household waste as recently as March of 01.
[00:04:00.342 --> 00:04:03.863]  So they had no regard for what they were doing.
[00:04:03.863 --> 00:04:14.948]  Others of our affidavits show that workers asked that they wash what was coming in so that they could differentiate human remains from the other debris and they were told that would take too long and they wouldn't let them
[00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:22.750]  We have another affidavit where one of the workers tells us that they were given rakes and shovels and told to hit the piles.
[00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:32.757]  Now, by the way, that was all a crime scene, too, how they cut up the steel and hauled it under guard to China and South Korea, how they guarded it, didn't want anybody to get any samples.
[00:04:32.757 --> 00:04:34.138]  I wonder why.
[00:04:34.138 --> 00:04:37.160]  Well, I wonder what's being hidden at Fresh Kills myself.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:45.065]  And in fact, one of the affidavits mentioned that there was a cadaver dog, and to give the cadaver dog some rest,
[00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:55.735]  His handler took him over to where the steel beams were lined up to be shipped over to the recycling area in Jersey City, and the dog started going crazy, and he couldn't figure it out.
[00:04:55.735 --> 00:05:11.340]  So he called in one of the police detectives who was kind enough to do this affidavit, and he went and looked where the dog was just going crazy, and they found a part of a human body in the steel that was being shipped out to Jersey City.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.981]  I mean, they were not checking the steel.
[00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:14.561]  They were not
[00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.410]  I think so.
[00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:44.238]  Journalists have never been allowed to go with us to see the mess that's up there, and now we can show.
[00:05:44.238 --> 00:05:47.841]  But I mean, how in a free country can now journalists not go to a landfill?
[00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:48.502]  I don't know.
[00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:50.623]  See, I mean, this is such a free country.
[00:05:50.623 --> 00:05:57.589]  Now, expanding out from there, I remember a few months ago the report of a building across the street, they found a thigh bone in it.
[00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:05.715]  I mean, to me, how are bones being blown and having the flesh removed across the street?
[00:06:07.682 --> 00:06:09.863]  This is amazing.
[00:06:09.863 --> 00:06:10.883]  Well, this is the building.
[00:06:10.883 --> 00:06:15.125]  It was the 130 Liberty Street, which is also known as the Deutsche Bank.
[00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.826]  And it's not just a matter of one bone.
[00:06:16.826 --> 00:06:21.528]  To date, they've found 785 pieces of human remains there.
[00:06:21.528 --> 00:06:27.510]  Yeah, that was the building declared free and clear of all human remains.
[00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.693]  And then in September of 05, working on the roof, some workers accidentally found pieces of human remains.
[00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:42.421]  And it was at that point that it started to escalate and as recently as last week they found 30 pieces in that same building.
[00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:48.263]  Now that building has twice been declared free of human remains and they're still finding them.
[00:06:48.263 --> 00:06:59.046]  That whole area, I think worse than that building is the fact that Con Ed workers found human remains in October in a manhole right at the edge of the site.
[00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:14.442]  And this was an area that the Department of Design and Construction, under Rudy Giuliani's guidance and dictates, had decided they would take World Trade Center material without inspecting it and make a roadbed out of it.
[00:07:14.442 --> 00:07:16.323]  And it was a service road.
[00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:22.608]  And out of that service road, that haul road, they have found 272 human remains.
[00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:26.191]  They found another 209 in manholes.
[00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:27.832]  And this has all been since October.
[00:07:28.544 --> 00:07:37.472]  So, you know, these are the people who are telling me... Well, I mean, why don't they just fence off the area of the landfill, put a memorial there and a road into it?
[00:07:37.472 --> 00:07:41.976]  Why do they have to go, nope, shut up, and we're going to use it to fill potholes?
[00:07:41.976 --> 00:07:47.221]  Well, I've got to tell you that if we wanted them to do that, they probably would.
[00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:49.363]  But it's more complicated than that.
[00:07:49.363 --> 00:07:51.866]  To begin with, it's on top of household waste.
[00:07:53.937 --> 00:07:57.559]  That can never be what we consider a decent burial site.
[00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:00.020]  And it's going to shift and fall and move.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.060]  Absolutely.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:14.185]  And then they also cannot really do anything with that land for 30 to 50 years because of the methane gas, because of the settling, because of polluted waters that have to dissipate.
[00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:18.387]  So to us, it's a totally unacceptable location.
[00:08:18.923 --> 00:08:21.105]  And we're open to other suggestions.
[00:08:21.105 --> 00:08:22.946]  We've given them plans for other suggestions.
[00:08:22.946 --> 00:08:30.092]  Yeah, I mean, they should have hauled the waste, you know, to some nearby national park and created a big parkland for it.
[00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:32.073]  I mean, that would be the common sense.
[00:08:32.073 --> 00:08:34.335]  Well, and we've given them some suggestions.
[00:08:34.335 --> 00:08:37.217]  I mean, one of them is Governor's Island.
[00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.259]  The city paid a dollar for it.
[00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:41.080]  They're raising it.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.925]  But they want to put up some kind of, you know, a wealthy theme park there with a boutique
[00:08:48.067 --> 00:08:52.095]  Well, they also don't want people 50 years from now digging into those sediments and
[00:08:52.802 --> 00:09:08.915]  And doing investigations, because I'm just going to tell you right now, Diana, I'm sure you've heard the discussions, but it's not just people on the news talking about it, it's firefighters, it's police, and even the NIST report is now talking about something else in Building 7.
[00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:14.939]  They're having to say that explosives could have been involved.
[00:09:14.939 --> 00:09:19.763]  Do the families you talk to discuss that, about why there's a cover-up?
[00:09:19.763 --> 00:09:20.804]  Some do, some don't.
[00:09:21.641 --> 00:09:22.901]  Some do, some don't.
[00:09:22.901 --> 00:09:31.363]  I have to say that mostly the group that we founded and that we deal with are dealing with the treatment of the human remains.
[00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:40.746]  And certainly, when you see that human remains are treated in this fashion, you have to know that they're cavalier about other things as well.
[00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:46.347]  And I have to wonder, what else are they hiding if they will not let us take them out of this dump?
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.442]  And inspect it and bury them properly.
[00:09:49.442 --> 00:09:50.863]  Do you know Bill Doyle?
[00:09:50.863 --> 00:09:55.085]  He's the head of the biggest victims family group.
[00:09:55.085 --> 00:10:01.109]  He said on the show last year that he now believes that 9-11 is a inside job.
[00:10:01.109 --> 00:10:08.234]  He says he doesn't know to what extent, but he says that over half the families in his group believe that.
[00:10:08.234 --> 00:10:11.796]  What percentage would you say in your group believe there's a cover-up?
[00:10:11.796 --> 00:10:15.739]  I really can't answer that because I've never really polled them on something like that.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:23.666]  I will say that they feel that the mistreatment of the dead has certainly been covered up.
[00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:27.249]  And if one thing is covered up, why not something else?
[00:10:27.249 --> 00:10:37.218]  I think it's important for us to realize that we're often being told that this is a political issue, and our feeling is that both that independence
[00:10:38.678 --> 00:10:41.981]  Republicans, Democrats, they all died there.
[00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:49.287]  Well, your son, and I hate to say this, your son and the people he lies with are being used to pay highways.
[00:10:49.287 --> 00:10:49.667]  Yes.
[00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:50.828]  So that's unacceptable.
[00:10:50.828 --> 00:10:55.832]  If my son would have died there, I would get violently angry about this.
[00:10:55.832 --> 00:10:57.474]  I am very angry about it.
[00:10:57.474 --> 00:10:58.415]  I am very angry.
[00:10:58.415 --> 00:11:05.921]  And I have been to meetings where the Planning Commission is talking about what a wonderful thing they're doing with this piece of land.
[00:11:06.594 --> 00:11:11.097]  And we've been told that we are being rude and we have to be quiet.
[00:11:11.097 --> 00:11:11.758]  So you're right.
[00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:13.679]  We're not able to express our views.
[00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:20.924]  When Mayor Bloomberg had family meetings and we wanted to bring up this issue, we were not allowed to attend those family meetings.
[00:11:20.924 --> 00:11:22.785]  Yeah, so-called free country, folks.
[00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:24.186]  Well, I mean, that's my point.
[00:11:24.186 --> 00:11:25.707]  They're saying you're being political.
[00:11:25.707 --> 00:11:26.888]  No.
[00:11:26.888 --> 00:11:30.130]  They're running this country like a whorehouse.
[00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.752]  Well, they're certainly abusing my dead son.
[00:11:32.752 --> 00:11:35.514]  And I think enough has happened to him.
[00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.272]  That I don't think he needs to suffer the indignity.
[00:11:39.272 --> 00:11:43.874]  The worst indignity most cultures can think of is not letting you bury your dead.
[00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:46.656]  You know, when I saw... I traveled out... Well, I tell you what, stay there.
[00:11:46.656 --> 00:11:47.276]  Stay there, please.
[00:11:47.276 --> 00:11:49.958]  I want to do one more little five-minute segment with you on the other side.
[00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.039]  Talk about the organization, the website.
[00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:52.419]  Stay with us.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.902]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:11:59.902 --> 00:12:08.246]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:12:08.246 --> 00:12:15.289]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:22.934]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:12:22.934 --> 00:12:28.138]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:12:28.138 --> 00:12:37.284]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:12:37.284 --> 00:12:41.867]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[00:14:04.736 --> 00:14:08.137]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[00:14:08.137 --> 00:14:12.098]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[00:14:12.098 --> 00:14:20.421]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:48.221]  With a $25 love offering to Two Witness Ministries, get the book, The Rider of the White Horse, at Box 2453, Abilene, Texas, 79604.
[00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:52.205]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[00:14:54.574 --> 00:14:55.094]  Attention!
[00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:58.216]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:14:58.216 --> 00:15:02.839]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:04.480]  Listen closely.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:11.925]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:15:11.925 --> 00:15:20.691]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:26.793]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:36.176]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:42.281]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:15:42.281 --> 00:15:46.084]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:15:46.084 --> 00:15:48.987]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:15:48.987 --> 00:15:50.268]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:15:50.268 --> 00:16:01.277]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:01.277 --> 00:16:03.579]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:08.706]  Diane Horning is our guest.
[00:16:08.706 --> 00:16:12.288]  She lost her son Matthew in the tragic attacks of 9-11.
[00:16:12.288 --> 00:16:18.032]  And his remains have been taken to a landfill.
[00:16:18.032 --> 00:16:26.297]  They're now using some of those remains to pave roads.
[00:16:26.297 --> 00:16:31.660]  And the government will block the families from even complaining here in the land of the free and home of the brave.
[00:16:33.835 --> 00:16:37.257]  Diane, what would you like to see happen?
[00:16:37.257 --> 00:16:46.001]  I mean, obviously, people should get in trouble for this, and the remains should be removed and taken somewhere for a proper memorial for those that died.
[00:16:46.001 --> 00:16:49.723]  Preferably, I would imagine, you'd like a pastoral setting, like a cemetery.
[00:16:49.723 --> 00:16:51.343]  I mean, what would you like to see happen?
[00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:53.104]  What needs to happen?
[00:16:53.104 --> 00:16:58.827]  We are actually in court and hoping that our case is not dismissed.
[00:16:58.827 --> 00:17:03.529]  We're not asking for any financial compensation, and that's important to note.
[00:17:04.093 --> 00:17:10.860]  We're not even asking that anyone be punished because we know what happens.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:17.206]  We are asking for the removal of the remains from the landfill and a proper burial.
[00:17:17.206 --> 00:17:19.208]  And yes, we would like a cemetery.
[00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:21.590]  We don't want it to pretend to be anything else.
[00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.332]  We don't want it to be a Freedom Tower.
[00:17:23.332 --> 00:17:24.453]  We don't want it to be a
[00:17:25.111 --> 00:17:25.811]  A museum.
[00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.493]  We don't want anything but what you get at a cemetery.
[00:17:28.493 --> 00:17:30.494]  You don't want it to be a political statue.
[00:17:30.494 --> 00:17:32.035]  They're saying you're political.
[00:17:32.035 --> 00:17:33.415]  You don't want it to be political.
[00:17:33.415 --> 00:17:34.076]  Not at all.
[00:17:34.076 --> 00:17:37.778]  Like with a gold statue of Bush holding Giuliani or something.
[00:17:37.778 --> 00:17:39.979]  Oh, wouldn't that be horrible?
[00:17:39.979 --> 00:17:45.041]  Yeah, we would like to have markers that people can have names.
[00:17:45.041 --> 00:17:47.883]  You know, the memorial at Ground Zero is going to be a farce.
[00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.812]  The memorial they're building there has nothing to do with the dead.
[00:17:51.812 --> 00:17:57.675]  The memorial at Ground Zero has stripped everyone of their rank, has stripped them of their ages.
[00:17:57.675 --> 00:18:00.476]  You will never know that one little girl was two years old.
[00:18:00.476 --> 00:18:02.117]  You know what makes me mad, too?
[00:18:02.117 --> 00:18:12.823]  And I want to get your take in closing before you tell us about the websites people can support you guys and get the word out about this travesty of just, you know, insult the families and the victims.
[00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:24.880]  That the White House and the media and the military wrap themselves in the dead of 9-11 and constantly use them, but then they wouldn't even give them a mass grave.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.521]  They would put them in a trash heap.
[00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:33.487]  Well, I gotta tell you, Mr. Bush claims, whether you believe it or not, that we went to war because these people died.
[00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:36.129]  And yet, he considers them garbage.
[00:18:36.129 --> 00:18:37.951]  And yes, he does know where they are.
[00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:41.834]  We have put and delivered our information to him three times.
[00:18:42.341 --> 00:18:43.982]  So he knows all about it.
[00:18:43.982 --> 00:18:45.484]  He's choosing to ignore it.
[00:18:45.484 --> 00:18:47.545]  He doesn't even respond to us.
[00:18:47.545 --> 00:18:49.687]  But the point is, would you go to war?
[00:18:49.687 --> 00:18:50.488]  Now see, Bush is dumb.
[00:18:50.488 --> 00:18:53.370]  He could say, oh, we didn't know about this.
[00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.171]  We're going to fix it.
[00:18:54.171 --> 00:18:55.512]  That'd be a great PR.
[00:18:55.512 --> 00:18:56.533]  They just don't care.
[00:18:56.533 --> 00:18:58.134]  It would be a beautiful PR.
[00:18:58.134 --> 00:18:58.294]  No!
[00:18:58.294 --> 00:19:00.556]  I mean, it's like he wouldn't meet with Cindy Sheehan.
[00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.097]  My son is expendable.
[00:19:02.097 --> 00:19:03.699]  My son was expendable.
[00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:06.381]  And let me tell you, the memorial they're building at Ground Zero,
[00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:08.528]  You talk about the military.
[00:19:08.528 --> 00:19:10.710]  They're stripping the military of their rank.
[00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:17.916]  The military will be listed that died at the Pentagon, but their rank and their affiliations will not be listed.
[00:19:17.916 --> 00:19:27.045]  They will be listed in random order, there will not be an American flag, and there will not be anything that has the date September 11, 2001.
[00:19:27.045 --> 00:19:28.487]  And you know why they do that?
[00:19:28.487 --> 00:19:30.869]  It's because the bureaucracy is so lazy now.
[00:19:32.819 --> 00:19:35.840]  Well, I think it's just because they want it to go away.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.422]  They don't want a remembrance of what happened there.
[00:19:39.422 --> 00:19:50.746]  It will be historically inaccurate, and as my husband said, in a few short years, people will be looking at these names, and they'll think these are the names of people who paid to have bricks put in.
[00:19:50.746 --> 00:19:54.368]  Because there's nothing there that's going to tell you who they were.
[00:19:54.368 --> 00:19:54.968]  Nothing at all.
[00:19:55.936 --> 00:20:01.399]  It'll also be near impossible to find the name of the loved one you lost if it's not in order.
[00:20:01.399 --> 00:20:02.499]  Absolutely.
[00:20:02.499 --> 00:20:04.880]  And the families have nothing to say about that.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.501]  But now they won't even let us bury the dead.
[00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:14.605]  And if they let us bury our dead, we can each have a marker, a place where we can go for solace, a place like Normandy.
[00:20:14.605 --> 00:20:17.086]  You know, 91 nations lost people.
[00:20:17.086 --> 00:20:19.307]  The Canadians are livid.
[00:20:19.307 --> 00:20:24.229]  We're heading for the House of Commons in Canada, because only half of their people were returned.
[00:20:24.964 --> 00:20:32.530]  Well, I'm looking at photos from the last photos there with the shoes and what looks like bones and clothes.
[00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.573]  I mean, they just dump it all right in there.
[00:20:35.573 --> 00:20:39.456]  It's WTCfamiliesforproperburial.com.
[00:20:39.456 --> 00:20:42.418]  WTCfamiliesforproperburial.com.
[00:20:42.418 --> 00:20:47.342]  Well, our prayers go with you and we're going to bring the perpetrators one way or another to justice.
[00:20:47.922 --> 00:20:54.985]  And I have to tell you, bottom line, I know you're focused just on this issue, Diane, but I am the father of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:20:54.985 --> 00:21:00.827]  I'm the guy who, from the start, knew about this two months before it was going to happen, this type Alex Jones, warrants of 9-11.
[00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:16.574]  I said they were going to attack the World Trade Center and that Bin Laden was a CIA asset, and I put that out, and I really want to pray for you and your husband that you get through this pain, and I'm really sorry that you lost your son, and I hope the people will help you at least get a proper burial for him.
[00:21:17.174 --> 00:21:21.478]  On our website, they can go to the petition online and sign, which would be great.
[00:21:21.478 --> 00:21:24.481]  We've got 65,000 signatures already.
[00:21:24.481 --> 00:21:29.445]  And maybe the criminals that have done this will accept those and do the right thing.
[00:21:29.445 --> 00:21:31.547]  We'll watch this as it develops.
[00:21:31.547 --> 00:21:32.928]  God bless you and take care, Diane.
[00:21:32.928 --> 00:21:34.109]  Say hi to your husband for me.
[00:21:34.109 --> 00:21:35.370]  Thank you so much.
[00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.691]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:21:36.691 --> 00:21:37.132]  Stay with us.
