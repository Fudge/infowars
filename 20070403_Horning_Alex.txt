[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]  Alright, coming up, we'll continue with your calls, get into the Fox News O'Reilly slash
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:18.520]  Rosie slash Charlie Sheen slash Loose Change soap opera.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:27.640]  But right now, we're joined by Diane Horning, Kurt Horning and his wife Diane Horning of
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.160]  Scotch Plains, whose son Matthew was killed on 9-11, and are co-founders of WTC Families
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.240]  for Proper Burial, were recognized for their efforts at the 2006 Voices Luncheon, along
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.160]  with other honorees of 9-11 family members who have been active since 9-11 and have remained
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.680]  active in support of the victims and survivor families.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.080]  Now, remember Reuters last week had the headline that the remains of victims of 9-11 were being
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.440]  used in potholes.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.200]  Associated Press reported 9-11 remains possibly used on roads, court papers.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.840]  Now, remember all the video of them loading the trucks with the quote aggregate, with
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.800]  like bone pieces, and they've now found, just a few months ago, you know, they found bones
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.200]  in nearby buildings that were blown out of the buildings.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.200]  How'd that happen?
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200]  With a collapse.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.400]  Man, bodies blown into the, I hate to talk like this, her son died in the horrible attacks,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.320]  but I mean, this is the facts here, and they won't let anybody into the landfills, but
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.600]  now photos have been snuck out of, you know, piles of, you know, shoes and parts and what
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.600]  looks like bones, and they filed suit over it, the government's trying to throw the suits
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600]  out.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.160]  I mean, this just shows how cold-blooded they are.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.320]  They don't even want to give a proper burial to these people, and then, hey, we're going
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.240]  to use it to cover the roads mixing with the asphalt.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.640]  It just goes to the mind, and of course, not give treatment for those that breathe the
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.640]  asbestos and concrete, when the EPA's own internal reports that they were going to die,
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.560]  and they just said, hey, you're not sick, go home and die, and they do go home and die,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.600]  so it's just government again, just like Katrina, anywhere else, this is who's going to supposedly
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600]  take care of you.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600]  Now, that's my intro.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.400]  Diane Horning, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]  Oh, thank you.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400]  Thank you for including our mission.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.240]  Yeah, the Fresh Kills landfill has human body parts in it.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.480]  I think that our court papers, very clearly through affidavits of people who worked there
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.440]  during this 10 months that it was operational, have told us that in the first, specifically,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.600]  the first five weeks, they were planning to do this as a salvage operation.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.240]  They were not even thinking of human remains.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.320]  Giuliani wanted the World Trade Center site emptied out as quickly as possible, as cheaply
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.160]  as possible, so he could look like the can-do guy, and in doing that, he scooped and dumped,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.920]  instead of hunting for remains where they were, they took it to the landfill and essentially
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920]  set up to salvage.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.600]  In other words, they were separating out metals.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.160]  What was going to go to the salvage yards?
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.080]  What was going to get out of there fast and furious?
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.240]  And in doing that, in the first five weeks or so, suddenly seagulls started to inundate
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.880]  the area, and they began to realize that there was only one thing the seagulls were
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.760]  after, and that was human bodies.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.280]  And so it was at that point that someone, a firm from Rockland County, New York, or
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.560]  Orange County, New York, came down, said, look, we've got sifting equipment.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.200]  We can do a better job.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.200]  Let us demonstrate.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.240]  They did, and after about five weeks, they began a sifting process, which helped make
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.240]  it better.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.000]  In those initial five weeks, they were just dumping things over the edge into the landfill,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.960]  and it was the most recently used part of the landfill.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.880]  It had been accepting household waste as recently as March of 2001, so they had no regard for
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.000]  what they were doing.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.800]  Others of our affidavits show that workers asked that they wash what was coming in so
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.200]  that they could differentiate human remains from the other debris, and they were told
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.840]  that would take too long, and they wouldn't let them.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.480]  We have another affidavit where one of the workers tells us that they were given rakes
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.480]  and shovels and told to hit the piles.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.920]  Now, by the way, that was all a crime scene, too, how they cut up the steel and hauled
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.280]  it under guard to China and South Korea, how they guarded it, didn't want anybody to get
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.680]  any samples.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680]  I wonder why.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.160]  Well, I wonder what's being hidden at Fresh Kills myself, and in fact, one of the affidavits
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:46.120]  mentioned that there was a cadaver dog, and to give the cadaver dog some rest, his handler
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.600]  took him over to where the steel beams were lined up to be shipped over to the recycling
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.960]  area in Jersey City, and the dog started going crazy, and he couldn't figure it out, so he
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.400]  called in one of the police detectives who was kind enough to do this affidavit, and
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.560]  he went and looked where the dog was just going crazy, and they found a part of a human
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.360]  body in the steel that was being shipped out to Jersey City.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.000]  I mean, they were not checking the steel.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.340]  They were not interested in the human remains.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.960]  They were interested in get it out of here fast, get it out of here cheap, and make it
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.000]  look like Giuliani got us back quickly, and then Bloomberg came in and adopted the same
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.760]  pose, exactly the same pose.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.000]  We know there were human remains there.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.160]  We know they were abusive with them.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.840]  Journalists have never been allowed to go with us to see the mess that's up there, and
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.360]  now we can show.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.680]  But I mean, how in a free country can now journalists not go to a landfill?
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.680]  I don't know.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.680]  See, I mean, this is such a free country.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.120]  Now expanding out from there, I remember a few months ago the report of a building across
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.120]  the street.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.520]  They found a thigh bone in it.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:06.600]  I mean, to me, how were bones being blown and having the flesh removed across the street?
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600]  This is amazing.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.920]  Well, this is a building.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.800]  It was the 130 Liberty Street, which is also known as the Deutsche Bank, and it's not just
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.880]  a matter of one bone.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.960]  To date, they've found 785 pieces of human remains there.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.600]  Yeah, that was the building declared free and clear of all human remains.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.340]  And then in September of 2005, working on the roof, some workers accidentally found
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.280]  pieces of human remains, and it was at that point that it started to escalate.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.240]  And as recently as last week, they found 30 pieces in that same building.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.520]  Now that building has twice been declared free of human remains, and they're still finding
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520]  them.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.920]  I think worse than that building is the fact that Con Ed workers found human remains in
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:01.520]  October in a manhole right at the edge of the site, and this was an area that the Department
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.680]  of Design and Construction under Rudy Giuliani's guidance and dictates had decided they would
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.520]  take World Trade Center material without inspecting it and make a roadbed out of it.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.400]  And it was a service road.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.680]  And out of that service road, that hall road, they have found 272 human remains.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.320]  They found another 209 in manholes.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.640]  And this has all been since October.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.160]  So you know, these are the people who are telling us they...
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.560]  Why don't they just fence off the area of the landfill, put a memorial there and a road
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560]  into it?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.760]  Why do they have to go, no, shut up, and we're going to use it to fill potholes?
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.320]  Well, I've got to tell you that if we wanted them to do that, they probably would.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.400]  But it's more complicated than that.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.840]  To begin with, it's on top of household waste.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.640]  And so that can never be what we consider a decent burial site.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.640]  And it's going to shift and fall and move and...
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.640]  Absolutely.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:08.000]  And then they also cannot really do anything with that land for 30 to 50 years because
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.800]  of the methane gas, because of the settling, because of polluted waters that have to dissipate.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.080]  So to us, it's a totally unacceptable location.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.240]  And we're open to other suggestions.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.640]  We've given them plans for other suggestions.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.380]  They should have hauled the waste to some nearby national park and created a big park
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.380]  land for it.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.000]  I mean, that would be the common sense.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.280]  Well, and we've given them some suggestions.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.280]  I mean, one of them is Governor's Island.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.400]  The city paid a dollar for it.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.160]  They're raising it.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:48.600]  But they want to put up some kind of a wealthy theme park there with boutique hotels.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.280]  They also don't want people 50 years from now digging into those sediments and doing
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.360]  investigations because I'm just going to tell you right now, Diana, I'm sure you've heard
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.760]  the discussions, but it's not just people on the news talking about it.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.720]  It's firefighters, it's police.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.000]  And then even the NIST report is now talking about something else in Building 7.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.960]  They're having to say that explosives could have been involved.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.880]  I mean, do the families you talk to discuss that about why there's a cover-up?
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.780]  Some do, some don't.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.780]  Some do, some don't.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:28.540]  I have to say that mostly the group that we founded and that we deal with are dealing
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.440]  with the treatment of the human remains.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.600]  And certainly, when you see that human remains are treated in this fashion, you have to know
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.840]  that they're cavalier about other things as well.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.080]  And I have to wonder, what else are they hiding if they will not let us take them out of this
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.480]  dump and inspect it and bury them properly?
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.980]  Do you know Bill Doyle?
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.120]  He's the head of the biggest victims family group.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:01.120]  He said on this show last year that he now believes that 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.720]  He says he doesn't know to what extent, and he says that over half the families in his
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.320]  group believe that.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.680]  What percentage would you say in your group believe there's a cover-up?
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.240]  I really can't answer that because I've never really polled them on something like that.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:24.080]  I will say that they feel that the mistreatment of the dead has certainly been covered up.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.200]  And if one thing is covered up, why not something else?
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.840]  I think it's important for us to realize that we're often being told that this is a political
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.840]  issue.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:41.880]  And our feeling is that both that independents, Republicans, Democrats, they all died there.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880]  And far enough-
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.960]  Well, your son, and I hate to say this, I mean, your son and the people he lies with
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.720]  are being used to pay the highways.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.720]  So that's unacceptable.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.600]  If my son would have died there, I mean, I would get violently angry about this.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.360]  I am very angry about it.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.480]  I am very angry.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.120]  And I have been to meetings where the planning commission is talking about what a wonderful
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.640]  thing they're doing with this piece of land.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.760]  And we've been told that we are being rude and we have to be quiet.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.800]  So you're right, we are not able to express our views.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.560]  When Mayor Bloomberg had family meetings and we wanted to bring up this issue, we were
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.720]  not allowed to attend those family meetings.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.520]  Yeah, so-called free country, folks.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.280]  Well, I mean, that's my point.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.000]  They're saying you're being political.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.640]  No, they're running this country like a whorehouse.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.840]  Well, they're certainly abusing my dead son.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:39.320]  And I think enough has happened to him that I don't think he needs to suffer the indignity,
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.960]  the worst indignity most cultures can think of is not letting you bury your dead.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.960]  You know, when I saw-
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.720]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]  Stay there, please.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.320]  I want to do one more little five-minute segment with you on the other side, talk about the
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.120]  organization on the website.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.880]  Stay with us.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.120]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.560]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere,
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.520]  which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.080]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.320]  feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.080]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.040]  iodine.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.580]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.920]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.400]  upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:43.960]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.680]  at 888-803-4438.

[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.520]  Half Dollar.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.880]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.960]  bring upon you sudden terror.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.000]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.120]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.580]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his White Horse, waging wars
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.560]  and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.440]  Get Two Witness Ministries' next shocking revelation.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.000]  The Rider of the White Horse, George W. Bush in Prophecy.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.200]  Visit the website, twowitnessministries.com.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.960]  King George II beats the war drums for his next invasion, Iran and Syria.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.280]  More nations are to follow, including the draft of your children.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:43.560]  With a $25 love offering to Two Witness Ministries, get the book The Rider of the White Horse
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.240]  at Box 2453, Aveline, Texas 79604.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.560]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:58.280]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.640]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.880]  you will ever hear.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.080]  Listen closely.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.400]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.960]  considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on earth.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.480]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.720]  this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory and even
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.000]  reproductive health.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.720]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720]  healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.760]  However, it is still legal to own this compound and right now a very small amount is being
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.720]  made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.520]  offer ever made on radio.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.240]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.040]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.200]  you move quickly.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:52.480]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:16:01.840]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.720]  a war on for your mind.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.360]  Diane Horning is our guest.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:17.240]  She lost her son Matthew in the tragic attacks of 9-11, and his remains have been taken to
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.240]  a landfill.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:28.960]  She's now using some of those remains to pave roads, and the government will block the families
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.880]  from even complaining here in the land of the free and home of the brave.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.080]  Diane, what would you like to see happen?
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.200]  I mean, obviously, people should get in trouble for this, and the remains should be removed
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.440]  and taken somewhere for a proper memorial for those that died, you know, preferably
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.720]  I would imagine you like a pastoral setting and like a cemetery.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.480]  I mean, what would you like to see happen?
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.200]  What needs to happen?
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:59.000]  We are actually in court and hoping that our case is not dismissed.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000]  We're not asking for any financial compensation, and that's important to note, and we're not
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.940]  even asking that anyone be punished, because we just don't, you know, we know what happens.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:17.380]  We are asking for the removal of the remains from the landfill and a proper burial, and
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.260]  yes, we would like a cemetery.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.660]  We don't want it to pretend to be anything else.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.400]  We don't want it to be a Freedom Tower.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.900]  We don't want it to be a museum.
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.540]  We don't want anything but what you get at a cemetery.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.620]  You don't want it to be a political statue.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.140]  They're saying you're political.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:37.060]  You don't want it to be political like with a gold statue of Bush holding Giuliani or
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.060]  something.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.620]  Oh, wouldn't that be horrible?
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.620]  Yeah.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.140]  We would like to have markers that people can have names.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.620]  You know, the memorial at Ground Zero is going to be a farce.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.860]  The memorial they're building there has nothing to do with the dead.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:57.100]  The memorial at Ground Zero has stripped everyone of their rank, has stripped them of their
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.100]  ages.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.540]  You will never know that one little girl was two years old.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.580]  You know what makes me mad, too, and I want to get your take in closing before you tell
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.620]  us about the website so people can support you guys, and I'll get the word out about
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:14.660]  this travesty of just, you know, insult the families and the victims that the White House
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:21.220]  and the media and the military wrapped themselves in the dead of 9-11 and constantly used them,
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.940]  but then they wouldn't even give them a mass grave.
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.220]  They would put them in a trash heap.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.060]  Well, I got to tell you, Mr. Bush claims, whether you believe it or not, that we went
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:37.000]  to war because these people died, and yet he considers them garbage, and yes, he does
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  know where they are.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.560]  We have put and delivered our information to him three times, so he knows all about
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560]  it.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.560]  He's choosing to ignore it.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.760]  He doesn't even respond to us, but the point is, would you go to war...
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.760]  Now, see, Bush is dumb.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.480]  He could say, oh, we didn't know about this.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.480]  We're going to fix it.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.480]  That would be a great PR.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.480]  They just don't care.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480]  It would be beautiful PR.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.480]  No.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.440]  I mean, it's like he wouldn't meet with Cindy Sheehan.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.440]  His top political...
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.440]  My son is expendable.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.200]  My son was expendable, and let me tell you, the memorial they're building at Ground Zero,
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.640]  it's talking about the military.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.760]  They're stripping the military of their rank.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.120]  The military will be listed that died at the Pentagon, but their rank and their affiliations
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.960]  will not be listed.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.300]  They will be listed in random order.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.640]  There will not be an American flag, and there will not be anything that has the date September
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.640]  11, 2001.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.560]  Now, you know why they do that.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.800]  It's because the bureaucracy is so lazy now.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.920]  Well, I think it's just because they want it to go away.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.480]  They don't want a remembrance of what happened there.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:45.520]  It will be historically inaccurate, and as my husband said, in a few short years, people
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.960]  will be looking at these names, and they'll think these are the names of people who paid
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:54.640]  to have bricks put in, because there's nothing there that's going to tell you who they were.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.640]  Nothing at all.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.400]  It'll also be near impossible to find the name of the loved one you lost if it's not
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.400]  in order.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.000]  Absolutely, and the families have nothing to say about that.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.760]  Now, they won't even let us bury the dead, and if they let us bury our dead, we can each
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.280]  have a marker, a place where we can go for solace, a place like Normandy.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.080]  You know, 91 nations lost people.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.400]  The Canadians are livid.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.560]  We're heading for the House of Commons in Canada, because only half of their people
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.560]  were returned.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.560]  Well, I'm looking at photos from the last photos there with the shoes and what looks
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.760]  like bones and clothes.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.680]  They just dump it all right in there.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:42.680]  It's wtcfamiliesforproperburial.com, wtcfamiliesforproperburial.com.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.760]  Our prayers go with you, and we're going to bring the perpetrators, one way or another,
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.080]  to justice.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.920]  I have to tell you, bottom line, I know you're focused just on this issue, Diane, but I am
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.880]  the father of the 9-11 truth movement.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.080]  I'm the guy who, from the start, knew about this two months before it was going to happen.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.600]  Type Alex Jones, Warrens of 9-11, I said they were going to attack the World Trade
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.800]  Center and that bin Laden was a CIA asset, and I put that out, and I really want to pray
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.840]  for you and your husband that you get through this pain, and I'm really sorry that you lost
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.200]  your son, and I hope that people will help you at least get a proper burial for him.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.520]  On our website, they can go to the petition online and sign, which would be great.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.560]  We've got 65,000 signatures already.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:29.520]  And maybe the criminals that have done this will accept those and do the right thing.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.520]  We'll watch this as it develops.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.960]  God bless you and take care, Diane.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.960]  Say hi to your husband for me.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960]  Thank you so much.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.960]  All right.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.460]  Stay with us.
