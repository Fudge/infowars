[02:17.080 --> 02:21.480]  was live yesterday Flynn was watching I didn't know that and the first thing he
[02:21.480 --> 02:25.600]  said when he came on is Alex you're right you're trying to crash the banks
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.640]  you're right they've done this Silicon Valley bank collapse to create the
[02:30.640 --> 02:36.880]  collapse but we should not panic and let them do that well today CNN ABC news
[02:36.880 --> 02:41.720]  the BBC I've got the articles right here they're like it's over all the banks are
[02:41.720 --> 02:45.720]  collapsing run for the hills bigger than 2008 don't worry though we've got
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.440]  central bank digital currencies there and we're gonna save you with these all
[02:49.440 --> 02:54.040]  there's only a couple hundred billion left in the FDIC after they bailed out a
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.800]  hundred fifty two hundred billion they haven't been clearing yet on Silicon
[02:58.800 --> 03:02.280]  Valley Bank the second largest independent lender in the country that
[03:02.280 --> 03:07.520]  he loans to people but that's okay because they're they're gonna have a new
[03:07.520 --> 03:10.640]  system they haven't told us yet but you know it's central bank these will
[03:10.640 --> 03:14.360]  currency they've been prepping it they've been getting it ready this is so
[03:14.360 --> 03:17.560]  important so I've been saying for months the next shoot a drop is a bank around a
[03:17.560 --> 03:21.080]  bank collapse because you can see him teaming it up on Wednesday last week
[03:21.080 --> 03:24.880]  Biden about his new national director the most important thing is central bank
[03:24.880 --> 03:28.760]  digital currencies to deal with volatility in the market stock market took
[03:28.760 --> 03:32.840]  cues on that sort of plunging Thursday and Friday they are artificially like
[03:32.840 --> 03:36.680]  they locked down our houses locked down our businesses locked us down in the
[03:36.680 --> 03:40.120]  last few years and imploded the third world with two plus years of lock downs
[03:40.120 --> 03:45.800]  they're now getting a new one ready just cutting off liquidity in the market and
[03:45.800 --> 03:51.200]  I get we've got zombie banks and inflation and all of it but the Federal
[03:51.200 --> 03:54.880]  Reserve's already raised interest rates five six times last year if they don't
[03:54.880 --> 03:59.080]  cut them now you know they're deliberately trying to put the economy
[03:59.080 --> 04:03.800]  into cardiac arrest and I'm not saying that's even a good way to go but that's
[04:03.800 --> 04:09.400]  the lesser of two evils so we've got all of this and more ladies and gentlemen to
[04:09.400 --> 04:14.640]  cover tonight meanwhile the globalist leftist pope comes out against

[06:07.200 --> 06:16.200]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[06:16.200 --> 06:19.840]  Well the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and former Chief
[06:19.840 --> 06:24.320]  National Security Advisor to President Trump is a very humble man but yesterday
[06:24.320 --> 06:27.160]  I had him on for an hour and a half for a commercial free emergency
[06:27.160 --> 06:30.960]  senator transmission and I said I'm gonna try to stand down and not talk too
[06:30.960 --> 06:34.880]  much can you really give a steep analysis and let me tell you it's as hard
[06:34.880 --> 06:39.320]  core as it gets the full interviews and man up video info wars commies go viral
[06:39.320 --> 06:44.680]  we're near a big excerpt sub it here tonight but first let's hit the big
[06:44.680 --> 06:50.440]  issue it's clear that the corporate media around the world is trying to create a
[06:50.440 --> 06:54.520]  bank panic and a rush on banks there's not enough cash in the banks there's
[06:54.520 --> 06:58.240]  plenty of digital money and the central private banks are not gonna prop up the
[06:58.240 --> 07:03.720]  regional and local banks and credit unions so they all go down and they can
[07:03.720 --> 07:08.400]  bring in the central bank digital currencies the centralized system that
[07:08.400 --> 07:12.600]  totally controls every fast-year life we've been predicting this I asked the
[07:12.600 --> 07:16.640]  archivist yesterday to look into it he put out a 20-minute video with more
[07:16.640 --> 07:21.920]  than 15 clips of myself the last two years predicting they would shut down
[07:21.920 --> 07:27.040]  regional banks with bank runs and do all this it's an obvious next move but
[07:27.040 --> 07:35.200]  here's some of the headlines right now on this front all starting all starting
[07:35.200 --> 07:46.360]  zoom in a bit on that place all starting with Silicon Valley Bank that Kramer and
[07:46.360 --> 07:51.240]  all the rest of them were telling people was absolutely invincible just two
[07:51.240 --> 07:54.640]  weeks ago and when it but Kramer's job in my view and he always does over and
[07:54.640 --> 07:59.560]  over again is they need to get the old investors the rich investors out he'll
[07:59.560 --> 08:03.320]  go and push and say the best deal is something that's about to implode to get
[08:03.320 --> 08:07.560]  your new money to pay out the old money or to prop up the Ponzi scheme before
[08:07.560 --> 08:13.200]  they pull the plug so I took Carlson said if if Kramer endorses something you
[08:13.200 --> 08:18.080]  need to run the other direction but after all that's what NBC and MSNBC and
[08:18.080 --> 08:24.560]  CNBC are all about US banks sitting on unrealized losses of six hundred and
[08:24.560 --> 08:33.560]  twenty billion that's what CNN's reporting entire US Congress most
[08:33.560 --> 08:38.520]  declassified cover 19 origins that's a good piece of news Swift one of the
[08:38.520 --> 08:45.720]  biggest international banking consortium networks to conduct more tests with CB
[08:45.720 --> 08:52.160]  DC central bank digital currencies due to the situation with Silicon Valley Bank
[08:52.160 --> 08:55.440]  told you yesterday that was coming they announced it today they already got it
[08:55.440 --> 08:58.800]  all set up oh we can't give you your money back but we'll give you a new
[08:58.800 --> 09:06.240]  digital currency back that we control and it just goes on from that point so
[09:06.240 --> 09:12.280]  this is big big news CDC FDA send letter to Florida Surgeon General warning he
[09:12.280 --> 09:16.480]  is endangering lives with coming back seen risk advice even though those risks
[09:16.480 --> 09:21.800]  are admitted we'll get to that a little bit later but let's get back into the
[09:21.800 --> 09:26.400]  banking situation Silicon Valley Bank imploded in a single day it could be just
[09:26.400 --> 09:32.480]  the tip of the iceberg Yahoo news this is the scared tactic they're using just
[09:32.480 --> 09:37.320]  like they triggered the 2008 crash to bring in Obama the government has 48
[09:37.320 --> 09:41.560]  hours billionaire investor Bill Ackerman calls on Biden to bail out SVB on
[09:41.560 --> 09:45.640]  Monday morning or face catastrophic market meltdown and loss of tens of
[09:45.640 --> 09:51.120]  thousands of jobs Silicon Valley Bank employees receive bonuses hours before
[09:51.120 --> 09:56.800]  government takeover the director and CEO of it took out 3.6 million dollars the
[09:56.800 --> 10:01.320]  day before it imploded SVV fallout spreads around the world from one into
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.160]  Singapore bank runs all over the planet in Yahoo news British tech sector a
[10:06.160 --> 10:13.880]  serious risk after SVB collapse says the government France 24 it goes on and on
[10:13.880 --> 10:17.960]  Silicon Valley Bank crisis will force the Fed to slash rates by 100 basis points
[10:17.960 --> 10:23.360]  to prevent contagion says market guru Yahoo news Yellen no federal bailout for
[10:23.360 --> 10:31.240]  collapse Silicon Valley Bank and it goes on from there so they're going after
[10:31.240 --> 10:36.600]  regional banks they're going after local banks to the big central banks and the
[10:36.600 --> 10:41.800]  big private equity groups and poses the saviors this is it they've got all the
[10:41.800 --> 10:45.960]  C central bank digital currencies ready they've got the central currencies
[10:45.960 --> 10:50.720]  ready this is a historic moment ending Bretton Woods bringing in a global
[10:50.720 --> 10:56.280]  consortium run by the UN run by the big central banks to bring in a new global
[10:56.280 --> 11:01.920]  set standard very very serious and we're recovering it live but I want to
[11:01.920 --> 11:08.240]  illustrate something right now that in international polls and national polls
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.880]  upwards of 90% of people don't trust the government and don't like it so this
[11:12.880 --> 11:18.960]  illegitimate system does not have the people support here's Joe Rogan just a
[11:18.960 --> 11:25.040]  few days ago talking about that it's a it's a very strange time where we don't
[11:25.040 --> 11:31.840]  think people have a lot of faith right now in institutions and I don't think
[11:31.840 --> 11:36.800]  they have a lot of faith in authority I don't think they really believe that
[11:36.800 --> 11:42.880]  there is someone who is wiser than them that has a grand plan that's logical
[11:42.880 --> 11:49.160]  that's that's workable where they're looking out for all of us so I think
[11:49.160 --> 11:53.240]  there's like a feeling of chaos that exists today that I don't think has
[11:53.240 --> 11:56.880]  ever existed in my life like this before even back during like the Bush
[11:56.880 --> 11:59.640]  administration when they thought you know everybody thought Bush was a moron
[11:59.640 --> 12:06.560]  they they still thought there's a good cabinet and they they're following all
[12:06.560 --> 12:09.160]  the checks and balances even though they're probably extracting too much
[12:09.160 --> 12:12.800]  money and they probably it's probably a lot of cronyism and a lot of
[12:12.800 --> 12:16.960]  undercover deals and a lot of like no bid contracts with Halliburton and that
[12:16.960 --> 12:20.480]  kind of nonsense he still thought they they have things pretty under control
[12:20.480 --> 12:24.360]  it's a very solid institution nobody believes that now you see Pete
[12:24.360 --> 12:29.120]  Buttigieg and Kamala Harris and and Biden can't get a sentence out like this
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.400]  is madness these people are utter fools and these are the people that are
[12:33.400 --> 12:37.200]  running everything and these are the people that are getting us on the brink
[12:37.200 --> 12:40.880]  of war with Russia and I don't have any faith in them and I think most people
[12:40.880 --> 12:46.520]  don't but why is that being done because Kamala Harris and Barack Obama's third
[12:46.520 --> 12:54.520]  administration or Biden are puppets fall guys to take the fall which I told you
[12:54.520 --> 12:58.520]  two plus years ago and that's where we are that's why this is so dangerous I
[12:58.520 --> 13:03.560]  want to play a clip that's all over the news that just happened two days ago a
[13:03.560 --> 13:09.640]  robbery of a gun store a man comes in with a gun to a gun store with men with
[13:09.640 --> 13:14.440]  guns on their hips and instantly gets killed now why am I playing this well
[13:14.440 --> 13:19.680]  it's the Darwin Awards folks and and and the globalist that we have running our
[13:19.680 --> 13:25.240]  society radio listeners can't see this obviously TV viewers can need to
[13:25.240 --> 13:29.800]  understand our so-called elites are like an idiot robbing a gun store starting a
[13:29.800 --> 13:34.720]  war a kinetic war a nuclear wars where it's going with Russia is equivalent of
[13:34.720 --> 13:40.560]  robbing a gun store at noon when you've got five employees armed who are trained
[13:40.560 --> 13:49.040]  retired police officers you're dead you might kill one of them you are dead it's
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.400]  like attacking a police station I mean these people are in it's like a hundred
[13:53.400 --> 13:56.640]  antifa last week came and just started trying to burn down a police station I
[13:56.640 --> 14:01.480]  mean is that they're just crazy or they know the judges are bought off they're
[14:01.480 --> 14:05.920]  going out of jail like the SPLC lawyer that was involved the whole thing $5,000
[14:05.920 --> 14:12.440]  bond it's insane so I tie that into this next clip this is the German foreign
[14:12.440 --> 14:18.920]  minister asked if there's any way and any chance of Ukraine being safe and
[14:18.920 --> 14:25.880]  Putin is still leading Russia and she says well if Putin does a 360 then
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.960]  Ukraine will be safe no no it's a 180 dumbass again these people do not have
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.760]  two-dimensional thinking not much less one-dimensional they certainly don't have
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.920]  two-dimensional a 360 takes you the same place let me let me draw a little
[14:40.920 --> 14:48.840]  diagram real quick for you here is a diagram okay so if you're right here and
[14:48.840 --> 14:57.120]  Putin's right here and this is a 180 so you want Putin to change where he's at
[14:57.120 --> 15:01.440]  but you're up here and you say a 360 so you don't like where Putin is you want
[15:01.440 --> 15:11.080]  to do them a 180 you don't want a 360 a 360 takes you back to the same place a
[15:11.080 --> 15:18.320]  180 is at the six watch your six this is a 12 this is where you want to be you
[15:18.320 --> 15:22.680]  want Putin to reverse his policies but the German German foreign minister can't
[15:22.680 --> 15:30.520]  even understand that okay you want a 180 not a 360 a 360 brings you right back
[15:30.520 --> 15:36.240]  where you are play the clip like on a break
[15:36.240 --> 15:43.080]  I've been asked before but I would still like to hear your answer is it is there
[15:43.080 --> 15:49.080]  any chance of Ukraine being safe in the long term if Vladimir Putin is still
[15:49.080 --> 16:02.280]  leading Russia if he doesn't change by what 360 degrees no right now I'm not
[16:02.280 --> 16:06.480]  talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone info or store.com and

[20:02.160 --> 20:13.840]  the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones if if rush invades that means
[20:13.840 --> 20:23.440]  tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again then there will be there
[20:23.440 --> 20:28.400]  will be no longer a Norse team too we will bring it into it but how will you
[20:28.400 --> 20:33.920]  do that exactly since the project and control of the project is within
[20:33.920 --> 20:39.440]  Germany's control I promise you we'll be able to do it tonight sabotage at sea
[20:39.440 --> 20:42.960]  that's what President Biden is calling the leaks and explosions on the Nord
[20:42.960 --> 20:49.480]  Stream pipelines like a boiling cauldron the busy Baltic Sea bursting with gas
[20:49.480 --> 20:54.200]  from rupture Russian Nord Stream reinforced pipelines first on CNN
[20:54.200 --> 20:59.400]  sources telling us that European security officials observed Russian Navy ships
[20:59.400 --> 21:04.200]  earlier this week in the vicinity of those leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines
[21:04.200 --> 21:08.520]  that were likely caused by underwater explosions here's what we know we know
[21:08.520 --> 21:13.240]  that Russian support ships Russian Navy support ships were spotted in the vicinity
[21:13.240 --> 21:17.560]  of the leaks on these pipelines we were also told by a source familiar with the
[21:17.560 --> 21:21.320]  intelligence that Russian submarines were spotted in the general area last
[21:21.320 --> 21:27.400]  week I think this is clearly an active sabotage of some sort and Russia is
[21:27.400 --> 21:32.840]  certainly the most likely suspect it's incredibly alarming president Vladimir
[21:32.840 --> 21:37.400]  Putin has blamed the United States and its allies for blowing up the undersea
[21:37.400 --> 21:42.760]  Nord Stream pipelines it was a deliberate act of sabotage and now the
[21:42.760 --> 21:46.960]  Russians are pumping out disinformation lies if Russia wanted to shut off the
[21:46.960 --> 21:50.360]  pipeline they would flip the button they would twist the knob they don't need to
[21:50.360 --> 21:54.320]  blow it up it's theirs it starts in Russia so it was pretty obvious to us the
[21:54.320 --> 21:58.040]  Biden administration was involved in this they have been lying to us all along
[21:58.040 --> 22:02.760]  about this there's no way the United States was not either involved or knew
[22:02.760 --> 22:07.400]  about this or at the very minimum approved it today a senior US government
[22:07.400 --> 22:11.600]  official rejected a new claim by Russia's defense minister he claimed that
[22:11.600 --> 22:16.160]  Ukraine is preparing to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb with Western
[22:16.160 --> 22:20.960]  health on its own territory this is the first time the 101st Airborne Division
[22:20.960 --> 22:25.200]  has deployed to Europe since World War two the idea that we're gonna send in
[22:25.200 --> 22:30.360]  offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American
[22:30.360 --> 22:35.680]  pilots and American crews just understand don't kid yourself no matter what
[22:35.680 --> 22:43.800]  y'all say that's called World War three the US will have to send their sons and
[22:43.800 --> 22:49.480]  daughters exactly the same way as we are sending their sons and daughters to war
[22:49.480 --> 22:54.920]  and they will have to fight and they will be dying
[22:54.920 --> 23:00.760]  air sirens blaring across much of central and eastern Ukraine today as
[23:00.760 --> 23:05.400]  Putin's forces ramp up Washington has placed more than 8,000 US based troops
[23:05.400 --> 23:10.640]  on a heightened state of alert today the US sent in the cavalry bound for
[23:10.640 --> 23:15.320]  Romania right along the Ukrainian border if we continue down this path we may
[23:15.320 --> 23:29.920]  end up with a nuclear holocaust
[23:29.920 --> 23:34.360]  CNN has learned that the US is developing contingency plans for possible
[23:34.360 --> 23:39.880]  Russian escalation in its war in Ukraine including the potential use of
[23:39.880 --> 23:43.480]  tactical nuclear weapons Russian President Vladimir Putin today making it
[23:43.480 --> 23:46.840]  official he just formally suspended Russia's involvement in its last
[23:46.840 --> 23:50.520]  remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the United States the prospect of
[23:50.520 --> 23:55.520]  nuclear conflict once and thinkable is now back within the realm of
[23:55.520 --> 24:01.160]  possibility every actuary every historic war game every analysis shows this
[24:01.160 --> 24:16.040]  leads to total thermal nuclear war it's Saturday March 11th we're now into our
[24:16.040 --> 24:21.280]  number two and General Flynn a combat veteran former head of defense
[24:21.280 --> 24:28.040]  intelligence agency and of course the top advisor to President Trump as the
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.000]  national security advisor joins us commercial free for the next 55 minutes
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.360]  he's a very busy man we appreciate him coming on we're an inflection point
[24:37.360 --> 24:41.320]  across roads and crossroads I asked him before he went live just minutes ago
[24:41.320 --> 24:45.640]  what he wants to hit first he said it's all interconnected and so he's got
[24:45.640 --> 24:49.840]  understanding of this from perspectives that really very few do on our side the
[24:49.840 --> 24:53.480]  bad guys have lots of command and control experience but this guy they're
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.400]  definitely scared of him but they weren't able to remove him Trump would still be
[24:57.400 --> 25:01.960]  in office today everybody even our enemies agree with that so we're gonna
[25:01.960 --> 25:05.040]  look at Russia and the escalation there we're looking at the bank runs that have
[25:05.040 --> 25:08.680]  begun we're going to look at the open borders we're gonna get the January 6
[25:08.680 --> 25:12.960]  bombshells coming out the huge gain of function dr. Redfield coming out saying
[25:12.960 --> 25:17.720]  no it was basically run by Obama through Fauci it was all illegal it was gain of
[25:17.720 --> 25:21.880]  function the deep states in trouble but they will strike back so he's a very
[25:21.880 --> 25:26.040]  polite and humble man but the time we've got him I'm gonna try as much as possible
[25:26.040 --> 25:31.000]  to just let him talk because if I jump in he'll let me go forever so general
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.600]  Flynn of general Flynn dot-com we salute you and your family and all your
[25:35.600 --> 25:38.760]  supporters what we've gone through together but you particularly we thank
[25:38.760 --> 25:44.080]  you for never backing down and you we had lunch a few years ago and then met
[25:44.080 --> 25:47.600]  again about a year ago and you kept saying if we don't totally push we're
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.600]  gonna lose in the next two years but I think it's safe to say we haven't won we
[25:51.600 --> 25:56.440]  haven't lost but it looks like a lot of really good signals right now everywhere
[25:56.440 --> 26:01.000]  that there's a huge meltdown in the deep state all their operations are being
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.880]  blown right now but that comes to me because they're not gonna give up
[26:04.880 --> 26:08.440]  without a fight and I just said last week I bet they do bank runs or a cyber
[26:08.440 --> 26:12.040]  attack to bring in their central bank digital currencies looks like we're
[26:12.040 --> 26:16.000]  there so you've got the floor serve you give us your overview and then we can
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.240]  drill into these different subjects thank you for joining us well two things
[26:20.240 --> 26:25.440]  immediately this year and I've been saying this for quite some time now I've
[26:25.440 --> 26:29.840]  been probably talking about this for the last year that this particular year
[26:29.840 --> 26:36.040]  2023 I've been saying that it is going to have two transitions one of those
[26:36.040 --> 26:41.920]  transitions is the financial transition of the of the global economic system
[26:41.920 --> 26:46.680]  okay and I'll describe that here in a second the second transition is the
[26:46.680 --> 26:52.000]  health system the global health system and and Alex and one of your in your
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.640]  lead into you know in the break when you were talking about some of the things
[26:56.640 --> 27:00.520]  that you're showing a couple of me there you know it's really I'd been you know
[27:00.520 --> 27:04.200]  watching you off and on but one of the things and I and I think it was like
[27:04.200 --> 27:10.400]  2010 it may have even been before that maybe 2007 where you were talking about
[27:10.400 --> 27:16.880]  you know the health the scares that they were that they were bringing forward and
[27:16.880 --> 27:20.840]  maybe at the time that we might have had some bird flu or some Ebola but I think
[27:20.840 --> 27:27.640]  the the intuition that you had then to talk about where we are now is was
[27:27.640 --> 27:32.360]  really prescient I mean it was really really you know talk about visionary and
[27:32.360 --> 27:38.120]  understanding what was possible by our own government and frankly you know the
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.920]  deep state is not just these unelected bureaucrats I mean we'll and we need to
[27:41.920 --> 27:44.720]  talk a little bit about that for your audience today you know who this deep
[27:44.720 --> 27:50.800]  state is we clearly define who the globalist elites are and and where they
[27:50.800 --> 27:54.760]  exist on the planet because it's not just in Washington DC they're they're all
[27:54.760 --> 28:01.120]  over the world and and they and honestly at the the big push behind all of this
[28:01.120 --> 28:06.560]  Alex and for your audience is coming from the the Chinese Communist Party so
[28:06.560 --> 28:11.720]  there's no doubt about that and I I know what their their 100 year plan is
[28:11.720 --> 28:16.400]  which essentially started in 1949 and they're executing it and they're
[28:16.400 --> 28:19.840]  actually speeding it up that's number one and then and then the other part of
[28:19.840 --> 28:27.080]  that is that this idea this notion of unrestricted warfare in 1998 99 timeframe
[28:27.080 --> 28:31.280]  I was in a military school at that time for one year and I had the chance to
[28:31.280 --> 28:36.520]  meet the authors of the of the of the manual called unrestricted warfare to
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.720]  Chinese colonels that came over to the United States of America on a bit of an
[28:40.720 --> 28:47.080]  exchange and I sat in and listened to them speaking about how they were going
[28:47.080 --> 28:49.960]  to fight this thing they called unrestricted warfare and it's their
[28:49.960 --> 28:53.720]  doctrine people can go find it online
[28:58.800 --> 29:03.840]  ladies and gentlemen this book the great reset in the world is a historic

[29:08.160 --> 29:12.000]  hellish future now you'll be always while they stole our books I guess they're

[32:47.040 --> 32:51.320]  neurological systems your brain your joints your bones as well or real Red
[32:51.320 --> 32:55.640]  Bull Plus just go try the product fund the info war and help us defeat the
[32:55.640 --> 33:03.480]  ruler together infowarstore.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[33:03.480 --> 33:17.440]  world order it's Alex Jones. Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to
[33:17.440 --> 33:25.040]  you live from the front lines of the info war. But before we go into some of
[33:25.040 --> 33:29.680]  that at the very tail end of the video that you showed prior to me coming on
[33:29.680 --> 33:35.440]  you showed a nuclear explosion and one of the things that is it is a major it's
[33:35.440 --> 33:39.400]  a falsehood and I want your entire audience and anybody that gets this
[33:39.400 --> 33:44.000]  piece of that gets this clip to understand there is no such thing as a
[33:44.000 --> 33:49.200]  tactical nuclear weapon we will describe nuclear weapons and people will
[33:49.200 --> 33:52.400]  say that's a tactical nuclear weapon we're going to use tactical nuclear
[33:52.400 --> 33:56.880]  weapons there's no such thing that explosion that you showed that right
[33:56.880 --> 34:01.200]  prior to me coming on that's the yeah there you go that's the result of a
[34:01.200 --> 34:06.040]  tactical nuclear weapon okay so don't think for a second that a tactical
[34:06.040 --> 34:09.640]  nuclear weapon is only going to blow up the hillside of a mountain we can do
[34:09.640 --> 34:13.680]  that with a lot of other munitions that we have but when we start to use
[34:13.680 --> 34:17.840]  tactical nuclear weapons which which are our administration has already talked
[34:17.840 --> 34:22.560]  about and I actually think when I when I look back if we really did the research
[34:22.560 --> 34:26.160]  we were probably the ones first talking about the use of nuclear weapons and
[34:26.160 --> 34:30.480]  not necessarily the Russians although now both of us both sides are talking
[34:30.480 --> 34:34.280]  about the use of nuclear weapons once we go to nuclear weapons and once that
[34:34.280 --> 34:37.720]  sort of you know when you when you talk about strategic bombers which they
[34:37.720 --> 34:43.160]  which the the Russians have already moved to four operating bases and they
[34:43.160 --> 34:47.400]  start to strategically minute move them around to protect them it you know as a
[34:47.400 --> 34:52.600]  security measure we know that they that the Russian submarine fleet is inside
[34:52.600 --> 35:00.160]  of the the the Black Sea and and probably in parts of of the Mediterranean
[35:00.160 --> 35:04.160]  and I can tell you one other piece there that somebody one of the media experts
[35:04.160 --> 35:08.120]  talks about was you know there was Russian submarines spotted in the area
[35:08.120 --> 35:14.080]  where the Nord Stream pipeline was was blown up you know excuse my Irish you
[35:14.080 --> 35:18.800]  know to your audience but that is total bullshit the Russian the Russian
[35:18.800 --> 35:24.080]  submarine fleet up in the Baltic seas there they they are they are so secret
[35:24.080 --> 35:28.160]  and they know how to sneak in and out of there because they know they're they
[35:28.160 --> 35:30.640]  know they're always being tracked in and out there so they're not going to do
[35:30.640 --> 35:36.680]  something as dumb as what we are trying to say that they did just like I think
[35:36.680 --> 35:40.000]  one of the guys from your show one of your members of your team said all they
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.640]  got to do is just turn the spigot off and and once they do that you know because
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.000]  they're not suffering from it it's going to be Europe that suffers from it so so
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.240]  there's there's so many things to unpackage here but one of the things I
[35:52.240 --> 35:56.720]  want to I want to start with is I want to start with because this is the here
[35:56.720 --> 36:00.640]  and now and you know this show on a Saturday you do these shows on Saturday
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.040]  sometimes in there they're so important I mean and and this particular one
[36:05.040 --> 36:10.960]  because of what happened yesterday with this Silicon Valley Bank so let's just
[36:10.960 --> 36:15.920]  spend a little bit I'm not a I'm not an economic expert but I have I have enough
[36:15.920 --> 36:25.000]  expertise in financial warfare right and then the the idea of of what we do with
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.000]  with our country and how we manipulate the the various things going on our
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.920]  country and I clearly paid very close attention in 2008 to the collapse and
[36:34.920 --> 36:39.560]  like I said I joked with you guys off camera before we came on about you know
[36:39.560 --> 36:43.400]  you have some real experts with you but I really think that people need to
[36:43.400 --> 36:48.240]  understand a couple things this is what this is Mike Flynn talking number one I
[36:48.240 --> 36:52.520]  actually think everybody needs to take a step back and take a deep breath and I
[36:52.520 --> 36:58.680]  mean take a deep breath and you know to a degree I want to see how this
[36:58.680 --> 37:02.200]  particular administration responds to this because the way that the Obama
[37:02.200 --> 37:08.320]  administration responded to the 2008 collapse was they basically they
[37:08.320 --> 37:13.320]  basically paid everybody off and they let everybody off okay and right now like
[37:13.320 --> 37:19.040]  just as an example the CEO the CFO and the CMO I guess the chief management
[37:19.040 --> 37:23.040]  officer the chief financial officer and the chief executive officer for Silicon
[37:23.040 --> 37:28.520]  Valley Bank they were selling their stock within you know within only a last
[37:28.520 --> 37:32.560]  couple of weeks I understand and maybe in the last couple of months those three
[37:32.560 --> 37:35.760]  days before they had to be arrested they ought to be arrested they ought to be
[37:35.760 --> 37:39.080]  arrested they ought to be thrown in the in the same clink that we're keeping
[37:39.080 --> 37:43.320]  these poor J sixers in that's what they ought to do right now throw them in the
[37:43.320 --> 37:48.160]  throw them in jail let them go get their high-priced lawyers and try to and try to
[37:48.160 --> 37:52.520]  you know try to get get them out on bail or bond but those three people if they
[37:52.520 --> 37:57.400]  did that and then they allowed their customers you know and they're we're
[37:57.400 --> 38:01.100]  talking the numbers that I'm hearing the numbers that I'm here now and I'm
[38:01.100 --> 38:04.840]  gonna I'm gonna get us back to where I want people to take a step back because
[38:04.840 --> 38:09.520]  because I you know if people all of a sudden show up Monday or Tuesday and
[38:09.520 --> 38:13.520]  start to freak out it's not going to help any of us what I want to do is I
[38:13.520 --> 38:17.480]  want to put pressure we need to put pressure on this administration right
[38:17.480 --> 38:20.800]  now and by putting pressure on this administration we're putting pressure on
[38:20.800 --> 38:24.560]  the deep state we're putting pressure on the the unelected bureaucrats we're
[38:24.560 --> 38:28.960]  putting pressure on the institutions that handle this economic situation this
[38:28.960 --> 38:32.960]  economic crisis that we are going through we're not in a military crisis
[38:32.960 --> 38:36.800]  right now you know and again we can we can spend a little bit of time on on
[38:36.800 --> 38:39.880]  the military side because I do believe that we need to talk about what's
[38:39.880 --> 38:43.080]  happening in Europe we need to talk about what's happening in the South
[38:43.080 --> 38:46.400]  China Sea we need to talk about what's happening in North Korea but right now
[38:46.400 --> 38:51.080]  the the American people I tell you I just I you know I'm one of these guys that
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.560]  goes around the streets here right in my own hometown and and I'm just I'm in a
[38:54.560 --> 38:59.760]  regular hometown of America I'm down in Florida but I I'm asking people so what
[38:59.760 --> 39:02.200]  do you think what do you think what do you think I'm at the gas station I'm at
[39:02.200 --> 39:06.320]  the you know the Wawa station I'm at a I'm at a 7-eleven I went into an office
[39:06.320 --> 39:10.360]  to go talk to some other people today and I met and just asked some I'm trying
[39:10.360 --> 39:16.640]  to get a just a basic feel a anecdotal feel if if nothing else what do you
[39:16.640 --> 39:19.080]  believe and they're all talking to me about how they're gonna go take their
[39:19.080 --> 39:24.560]  money out of the bank I'm like let's wait a second let's just wait and see come
[39:24.560 --> 39:28.200]  Monday Tuesday Wednesday because we're all gonna be in this together and what I
[39:28.200 --> 39:34.160]  want is I want the the exposure because the way we beat this globalist elite
[39:34.160 --> 39:39.280]  crowd the way we beat the deep state is we continue to expose them I mean one of
[39:39.280 --> 39:43.640]  the one of the beauties of info wars and one of the one of the the great the
[39:43.640 --> 39:48.360]  greatness of your show and you in particular and you know and I get it
[39:48.360 --> 39:52.600]  all kinds of grief or say even saying that Alex but the what the great thing
[39:52.600 --> 39:58.760]  is is is you expose things good bad or ugly you expose things and that's how
[39:58.760 --> 40:05.280]  you you you know that's how we we bring evil out into the into the light right
[40:05.280 --> 40:08.600]  well general Flynn let me just back you up because we didn't talk before he came
[40:08.600 --> 40:11.720]  on today we haven't talked in you know months in person but we're talking here
[40:11.720 --> 40:16.600]  live on air one of my notes was to ask Flynn how do we how do we not let them
[40:16.600 --> 40:20.200]  stampede us into bank runs because they could have propped this one bank up I
[40:20.200 --> 40:23.640]  said that you weren't watching probably the start of the last hour I said right
[40:23.640 --> 40:28.000]  they could have prop this one up they're letting this create a domino and create
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.320]  fear to bring in their whole new system so how do we thread that needle and you
[40:32.320 --> 40:37.180]  already addressed that before I asked it yeah so okay and really what you're
[40:37.180 --> 40:41.280]  talking about is you're talking about and for the people that don't know some to
[40:41.280 --> 40:47.280]  bring it to a source I want people to go read executive order one four zero six
[40:47.280 --> 40:53.840]  seven executive order one four zero six seven signed by Uncle Joe the 8th of March
[40:53.840 --> 40:59.800]  of 2022 and it went into effect 13 December 2022 so just this past December
[40:59.800 --> 41:05.160]  and there are already corporations and elements of our US government that are
[41:05.160 --> 41:09.720]  already beta testing what's called central bank digital currency central bank
[41:09.720 --> 41:13.440]  digital currency that's what that executive order is all about now the
[41:13.440 --> 41:18.160]  central bank digital currency there you go and the central bank digital
[41:18.160 --> 41:23.760]  currency is already a global system so it there's or it's already in effect so
[41:23.760 --> 41:29.400]  to speak the Chinese use it they use this you know their you want system but
[41:29.400 --> 41:33.360]  this is a way to control whether or not you can spend the money that you
[41:33.360 --> 41:38.320]  actually earn so you know and I'll just give a basic example of how far this
[41:38.320 --> 41:43.320]  could go so you could go down to the gas station to fill up fill up your car a
[41:43.320 --> 41:48.480]  second time in a month and you go to print you put your card into the gas pump
[41:48.480 --> 41:53.240]  there and the gas pump comes back and says denied and the reasons that is not
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.640]  because you don't have money in the bank it's because the this this environmentalist
[41:57.640 --> 42:03.360]  crowd this this Nazi common commune social whatever this you know and I say
[42:03.360 --> 42:06.840]  communists you know and the hardcore of them are Marxist and there are Marxists
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.240]  and it's a cult of power well it's a there are Marxists in in in the world
[42:12.240 --> 42:15.880]  economic forum there are Marxists in the intelligence community and there are
[42:15.880 --> 42:19.520]  Marxists in the Department of Defense in the Department of State especially the
[42:19.520 --> 42:23.880]  Department of State and and one other element there because I do want to maybe
[42:23.880 --> 42:27.240]  spend you know a few minutes talking about the Department of just us or the
[42:27.240 --> 42:30.920]  Department of injustice however you want to call but this central bank digital
[42:30.920 --> 42:35.440]  currency Alex and I know you you have spoken about this at times many others
[42:35.440 --> 42:40.120]  in the media they know that the I would say others who wouldn't touch this in
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.320]  the past are now starting to talk about this the mainstream media is not talking
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.760]  about it they won't talk about it but because they're they're all in but they
[42:48.760 --> 42:53.120]  but the other the other you know Fox I think you know there's been a one or two
[42:53.120 --> 42:57.240]  of their guests there that have talked about it

[46:58.840 --> 47:05.040]  action now. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's
[47:05.040 --> 47:19.280]  Alex Jones. But because they're they're all in but they but the other the other
[47:19.280 --> 47:23.600]  you know Fox I think you know there's been a one or two of the guests there
[47:23.600 --> 47:27.680]  that have talked about it I know that Glenn Beck has talked about it but only
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.640]  recently and I would say Glenn probably in the last couple months this is
[47:31.640 --> 47:34.720]  something that I know you've been talking quite a bit about and I know I've
[47:34.720 --> 47:38.840]  been talking about this for the last couple of years because once you control
[47:38.840 --> 47:44.120]  the the economic system you know the global economic system where where now
[47:44.120 --> 47:50.000]  the the US currency is no longer the currency of choice for for global trade
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.960]  around the world because right now the US currency is the is the currency of
[47:53.960 --> 47:59.120]  choice for global trade and the English language is the language of choice for
[47:59.120 --> 48:04.600]  global trade so that has been shifting now how do we so how do we defeat it
[48:04.600 --> 48:08.520]  well you know what's gonna have to happen this is really to the people right
[48:08.520 --> 48:13.520]  back to the people of of not only your audience but of this country a couple of
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.640]  states right now are putting into into bills and I know that there's gonna be
[48:18.640 --> 48:21.880]  at least one or two states that are gonna have it as law where you're where
[48:21.880 --> 48:27.280]  they're not gonna accept this form of currency so so the way to fight it back
[48:27.280 --> 48:31.360]  is expose it understand it make sure that we're talking about it and make
[48:31.360 --> 48:34.000]  sure that we're talking about it in the right in the you know with the right
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.880]  facts the right formats or right process the right ideas and then we have to
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.360]  talk about how do we how do we stop how do we block and tackle because will it
[48:42.360 --> 48:46.440]  last forever I don't know I don't know how long we can last in this battle but
[48:46.440 --> 48:50.840]  in this particular battle we can block and tackle a lot by making sure that we
[48:50.840 --> 48:56.840]  push not only those those in Washington DC but I kind of I've said a lot of
[48:56.840 --> 49:00.640]  times quit worrying about them if you can't worry about them worry about what
[49:00.640 --> 49:03.480]  you can do at your local level and definitely worry about what you can do
[49:03.480 --> 49:07.120]  at your state level so I know a couple of states Oklahoma is one of them who
[49:07.120 --> 49:11.720]  has who has got a bill going into their into their governor and once that
[49:11.720 --> 49:14.440]  happens and it's gonna happen here pretty soon because because this
[49:14.440 --> 49:18.080]  transition is not gonna happen on Monday and that's my point about taking a
[49:18.080 --> 49:22.360]  deep breath not gonna happen on Monday this is gonna happen over a period of
[49:22.360 --> 49:26.560]  time they are trying to move it faster they are trying to now I'm talking about
[49:26.560 --> 49:31.760]  the Chinese and in coordination with the World Bank and in coordination with
[49:31.760 --> 49:35.960]  the Klaus Schwab and team at the World Economic and General let's quantify that
[49:35.960 --> 49:39.720]  in layman's terms I agree there's a giant alliance of traders in our
[49:39.720 --> 49:42.920]  government the majority at the top who are chai common one in the dollar
[49:42.920 --> 49:47.360]  they're using this bank fear and they've said and Biden on Wednesday put out his
[49:47.360 --> 49:51.200]  new plan for a central bank digital currency that removes the English
[49:51.200 --> 49:54.720]  language from the communication which removes the dollar and makes it all
[49:54.720 --> 49:58.200]  digital when right now communications in English which is a human intelligence
[49:58.200 --> 50:02.160]  program what you're saying is very sophisticated I want to be lost on people
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.480]  we don't want them to stampede us with these bank runs into accepting the
[50:06.480 --> 50:10.720]  central bank digital currencies we want to prosecute the people that actually
[50:10.720 --> 50:16.240]  did this and control the contagion yeah so and now I'm speaking to the American
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.520]  people so if the American people all of a sudden go on a bank run then they then
[50:20.520 --> 50:24.080]  this government is going to turn right around and go see everybody's afraid we
[50:24.080 --> 50:27.880]  have to transition okay and this is what we're gonna do and here's our plan and
[50:27.880 --> 50:32.640]  we've already got it in place you know we it's just like COVID folks I mean some
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.640]  of the patents for COVID we're back in 2015 some of the stuff that that was
[50:36.640 --> 50:41.160]  developed in order to be ready and when they wanted it to use it which was in
[50:41.160 --> 50:45.640]  early 2020 late night 2019 early 2020 the patents for some of that stuff was back
[50:45.640 --> 50:50.160]  in 2015 you can't have a patent doesn't take you know it takes like 10 years to
[50:50.160 --> 50:54.400]  get a pat they already had them so now they already have this this idea in
[50:54.400 --> 50:58.160]  place I just mentioned the executive order they're already doing some some
[50:58.160 --> 51:03.480]  but what we call beta testing so if the American people can remain rock steady
[51:03.480 --> 51:08.800]  and I mean remain rock steady and place demands be prepared place start placing
[51:08.800 --> 51:12.200]  demands yeah I'm gonna tell you if we start to raise our voices up and we raise
[51:12.200 --> 51:16.040]  them through shows like info wars we raise them through some of these other
[51:16.040 --> 51:20.040]  people that are actually now getting it and now talking about it believe me that
[51:20.040 --> 51:24.920]  they're really so what are the demands we don't want the FDIC's deposit or
[51:24.920 --> 51:30.120]  insurance corporation is already saying this to pay people above $250,000 in
[51:30.120 --> 51:33.960]  central bank digital currency they're already rolling that out we have to say
[51:33.960 --> 51:40.080]  no we have to pay it back via the Treasury so so no no no no central bank
[51:40.080 --> 51:46.000]  digital currency response to this crisis yeah I mean so that this cut this
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.840]  government our government can they can use they can use bonds they can use
[51:51.840 --> 51:56.520]  gold they can use silver they can back everything right now without saying
[51:56.520 --> 52:00.480]  we're gonna go to a dig you know some type of digital currency right we're
[52:00.480 --> 52:05.880]  gonna accept a global system which is total bullshit I mean it is I'm you
[52:05.880 --> 52:11.880]  know and I'm sorry it is total bullshit it is and so so what the other thing is
[52:11.880 --> 52:17.160]  so that's number one the second thing is we must we must demand accountability
[52:17.160 --> 52:22.400]  and I want to see I want to see these out that CEO that CFO that CMO these
[52:22.400 --> 52:27.600]  people have to be held to account they must be brought in he knew was coming he
[52:27.600 --> 52:31.080]  jerked his money out they knew it was coming and there's many more those are
[52:31.080 --> 52:34.880]  just three that have popped up on the screen right those are just three that
[52:34.880 --> 52:38.560]  have popped up on the screen you know that are they're gonna be the faces of
[52:38.560 --> 52:42.480]  this thing but there's many many more faces and names and so what we have to
[52:42.480 --> 52:46.920]  do is look at look at the totality of this and let's not have any bailouts if
[52:46.920 --> 52:50.960]  this government starts to bail things out that means that that means that that
[52:50.960 --> 52:56.600]  we probably have lost this particular battle folks okay that's why I say it's
[52:56.600 --> 53:00.400]  like you know when somebody early on we have something in the military called
[53:00.400 --> 53:04.680]  rules of engagement and it comes it comes out of the very famous phrase you
[53:04.680 --> 53:07.920]  know don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes right and there's a
[53:07.920 --> 53:11.760]  ranger manual and there's all this kind of stuff about rules of engagement on the
[53:11.760 --> 53:14.800]  battlefield well I'm giving you a rule of engagement that rule of engagement is
[53:14.800 --> 53:21.120]  stay steady and let's let's see let's see what this enemy is about to attempt
[53:21.120 --> 53:26.600]  to do and even when that happens stay steady because what will happen is they
[53:26.600 --> 53:31.680]  will take total control of our lives our government so let's just jump for a
[53:31.680 --> 53:35.680]  second too because that's that's financial you know unless you want to
[53:35.680 --> 53:39.840]  jump in on add anything else let's go to the health side because in the in the
[53:39.840 --> 53:47.160]  in December they had what's called the G20 summit and in this particular G20
[53:47.160 --> 53:51.600]  summit there was only G19 because Russia decided to give them the you know the
[53:51.600 --> 53:55.560]  Russian salute and not show up and there's a reason why one of the main
[53:55.560 --> 54:00.600]  reasons was because the keynote speaker at the G20 summit which is a big deal
[54:00.600 --> 54:03.640]  and I don't expect your audience to have paid too much attention to it but the
[54:03.640 --> 54:07.200]  keynote speaker there was Klaus Schwab you know here Klaus Schwab this is the
[54:07.200 --> 54:13.480]  real council of global governance this is key yes this is key and so when we
[54:13.480 --> 54:18.320]  talk about so what is there what is their cabinet right what is their staff
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.640]  look like well their staff is somebody like a like a Klaus Schwab their their
[54:22.640 --> 54:26.920]  global staff looks like the World Bank the World Health Organization the World
[54:26.920 --> 54:31.520]  Trade Organization the International Monetary Fund organizations like the
[54:31.520 --> 54:36.520]  United Nations organizations like the European Union now all those people in
[54:36.520 --> 54:40.000]  the media will go oh this is all belong to these you know that's their tools of
[54:40.000 --> 54:46.960]  state power they don't have world government summits and that is how they function so so the
[54:46.960 --> 54:51.600]  World Health Organization Klaus Schwab G20 summit Klaus Schwab during the
[54:51.600 --> 54:56.320]  during the G20 summit back in December so only only a couple of months ago you
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.160]  made this you know this big statement about the direction that the world needs
[55:00.160 --> 55:04.840]  to take he was he was almost like it like a finger in their chest of the most
[55:04.840 --> 55:09.400]  powerful countries in the world this is one of the reasons why why the Russians
[55:09.400 --> 55:14.320]  didn't go because Putin and I because I do want to touch on Elon Musk here in a
[55:14.320 --> 55:19.440]  little bit Putin has has made a decision a very conscious decision and he's no
[55:19.440 --> 55:24.120]  longer going to be part of this idea of the world economic form he's just he's
[55:24.120 --> 55:28.600]  done with it he's done with it and he's done with it because he sees that his
[55:28.600 --> 55:33.200]  civil his you know that the Russian society is threatened but one of the
[55:33.200 --> 55:36.920]  things that came out of this Bali summit and our government just did a just
[55:36.920 --> 55:42.280]  did a little a little quiet kind of signatory of it is this World Health
[55:42.280 --> 55:47.640]  Organization global vaccination card okay so all those nations that attended
[55:47.640 --> 55:52.520]  the the G19 summit they all signed off on we're gonna have a global vaccination
[55:52.520 --> 55:57.520]  identification card so what does that mean what does that mean is that a is
[55:57.520 --> 56:02.800]  that a stamp on your passport is it a is it a is it a plastic card that every
[56:02.800 --> 56:07.520]  single human being on the planet has to carry around and so if I want to travel
[56:07.520 --> 56:11.360]  to a state let's say I'm in the United States and I'm I want to travel to a
[56:11.360 --> 56:15.640]  blue state but I want to travel to a state that's currently controlled by by a
[56:15.640 --> 56:19.280]  Democratic governor Democratic leadership let's just take the state of
[56:19.280 --> 56:22.720]  Michigan as an example so if I want to go into mission is Michigan gonna now
[56:22.720 --> 56:27.040]  stop me or stop me from buying products or stop me from visiting my relatives
[56:27.040 --> 56:31.800]  in Michigan or my relatives in whatever state that is because I can't cross the
[56:31.800 --> 56:35.680]  border or I because I don't have my full vaccination and what I'm telling you
[56:35.680 --> 56:40.560]  folks is don't get that damn vaccination don't do it and so now I'm gonna be you
[56:40.560 --> 56:45.320]  know labeled again a vax a vax denier I'm telling you there's no there's or
[56:45.320 --> 56:49.960]  there's very very few people in your audience and you have millions across
[56:49.960 --> 56:52.920]  the world that listen to you there's very few people that have had as many
[56:52.920 --> 56:58.320]  vaccinations or shots stuck in their arms or their rear ends as I have I have a
[56:58.320 --> 57:03.480]  I have a you know a list of shot I've shot record that goes probably 12 feet
[57:03.480 --> 57:10.640]  long so I'm not denying vaccinations of what I deny what I'm in against as I'm
[57:10.640 --> 57:17.040]  against this this murder weapon that we have called these these these vaccinations
[57:17.040 --> 57:20.880]  that these quote-unquote vaccinations these jabs they've been given
[57:20.880 --> 57:26.160]  everybody I mean it's undeniable it is undeniable so I don't want to argue you
[57:26.160 --> 57:29.360]  know that particular well that's all another subject I want to give you that
[57:29.360 --> 57:33.480]  because we got right what about the total vindication of all of us from the
[57:33.480 --> 57:36.960]  beginning three years ago it's all come out it doesn't work it hurts people you
[57:36.960 --> 57:40.120]  got the former head of the CDC coming out saying it's gain of function about
[57:40.120 --> 57:42.880]  seeing all them around yeah it's a gain of function which means a gain of
[57:42.880 --> 57:52.960]  function means weaponization weaponization it's hard to believe that
[57:52.960 --> 57:58.720]  we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane place World War
[57:58.720 --> 58:02.600]  3 has already started Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders there's

[59:49.640 --> 01:00:11.400]  One of the subordinate commands that I had was the national intelligence medical
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:18.560]  command NIMC and it's up and it's on the east coast okay and one of the one of
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.400]  the missions of them so I went and visited these folks because they were
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.320]  they were a subordinate command of mine they were they were an organization that
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.840]  I was responsible for and one of the things that they were responsible for
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.920]  was examining biological capabilities of other countries and how they would use
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.120]  them to weaponize them so so I have that that background as well as other
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.200]  background on just an intelligence aspects of my life that I got involved in
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:52.600]  that look at nuclear chemical radiological and biological warfare okay so I
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:58.840]  have some background in this but more than I want to have when we say gain a
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.400]  function and when we talk about what was happening between different labs right
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.000]  in the different undergraduate graduate level programs here that's UPenn or
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.480]  Pennsylvania Harvard was doing some stuff MIT's been doing some stuff and
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.160]  there's meant them there's been other you know universities particularly down
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.120]  North Carolina that have been doing some things in coordination with with the
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:25.160]  Chinese government so so we can't that's not deniable anymore and we have
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:30.760]  people that must be held accountable so the the the World Health Organization is
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:36.560]  imposing a global vaccination card our government is all for this this
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.120]  digital central bank digital currency our government is all for this so this is
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:47.640]  why I say we have to push back so much when I tell people they go they say to
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.920]  me what what should I do what can I do I don't want you to go do a run on the
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.600]  bank I don't want you to go take a vaccine I don't want you know I don't
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.360]  want you to go run out and say I got to go get a vaccine because somebody says
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.160]  we have the you know an H5N1 virus now breaking out in in West Africa and it's
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.800]  gonna you know jump over the ocean to the United States right now I mean
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.280]  they're gonna they're gonna try to put fear into us okay and and you said it a
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.320]  little bit in the in the tail end of your last segment one of the things that
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.880]  they fear and and they being this globalist elite they fear what they
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.720]  cannot control and so for your audience you're listening to somebody that they
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:30.280]  cannot control and now now how would how might they deal with me maybe they'll
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.480]  just go boom and and I'm done I've had enough threats in my life I you know I
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:40.680]  know what sacrifice can be and I know what the sacrifice is to a to a degree
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:46.240]  because I experienced you know combat operations and such I will tell you that
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.600]  you know we have people that have given their lives for this country you know
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.760]  over the years of the history throughout the history of this country and so we
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.640]  have to understand that the point is generally interrupt you you've made the
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.320]  commitment and people need to make the commitment that if you submit to this
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.680]  things are far worse the children deserve to stand up we gotta take action
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.720]  and listen you're on fire today you're always on fire but I've never seen you
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:12.320]  like on like this this is amazing well I'm out you know I mean I want to tell you
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:17.600]  stuff but I hope you'll do an overview because I agree with you that the
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.160]  globalist set up China as their laboratory control it was then used to
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.840]  infiltrate us now it's taking over the globalist to a certain extent so it's a
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.480]  little bit of our military and government waking up but I'd say that's a
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.240]  minority I agree with you who was the guy that went to Trump before that went to
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:37.560]  Obama and they admit was responsible for the pivot towards China so you warned
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.160]  you're the guy they admit even the establishment does that was right about
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.120]  China years before they double-crossed us that warned the globalist you're not as
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.880]  a trader you're like warning the government which was run by globalist
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:51.800]  they know you were right you tried to get them to stand up you've been
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.280]  vindicated well long before Trump got in and so you're a world expert on China
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.440]  and their hundred-year plan that we're now 60 years into so if you please please
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:07.000]  okay talk about the overview the 100,000-foot view because I think that's
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.660]  critical to understand what's happening yeah so so there is a there is a no
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.760]  kidding hundred-year plan that the Chinese have had they've started by
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:21.600]  Mao Zedong you know and and now with with Xi who's leading China now he's
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.640]  only the he's only the really the sixth leader that they've had in in that 60
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.760]  years right so they keep these guys you know there they have leaders in there for
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:36.520]  a long time and and so they're able to do things as a dictatorship as a
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:43.920]  communist dictatorship to their society to move their economy to move their
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:51.040]  people and to and to take things and do them over a longer period of time instead
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.040]  of the madness that we you know that we currently go through with with back and
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:01.800]  forth back and forth with star with the Joe everybody's thousands of former
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.560]  Nazis went to work for the United States government applying this has been found
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.800]  and is now in the possession of the army there is a full of news from CBS news
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:18.040]  President Kennedy has been shot this is a different time the war the USS Liberty
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.800]  had just been attacked by Israeli jets and Peter birds the CIA could manipulate
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.760]  the news in the United States they took the babies and let the children to die
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:36.240]  on the phone it was almost as if it were a plan if you go into the capital
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.840]  you will always have conspiracy theories they are nothing but distract you guys
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.920]  censored Harvard educated doctors silence those voices what we want to do
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:57.280]  in Davos is push to reset but as soon as we start exposing the great reset the sooner these globalists start going to prison
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:15.320]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:22.960]  to alex jones we have got to stop because we're right now we're gonna we're in a
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:28.000]  crisis period and the and the Chinese you might have shown it either a little
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.920]  while ago or on the on an earlier clip where you showed the South China Sea so
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.400]  let's talk first of all alliances okay because I think this is really important
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.520]  one of the things that's part of the hundred year war for the Chinese is to
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:47.960]  put put is to divide those who are allied with the United States of America
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:53.360]  divide those alliances and then build trust with the other side right so divide
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.520]  us from some partner that we had and then and then they become their part their
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:03.040]  new partner right so how do they do that they do that very very shrewdly they do
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:08.360]  that over time and they do that they've done that economically you know I I don't
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.160]  want to get into too much detail about the Belt and Road Initiative which is a
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.680]  which is a huge economic plan it goes all the way from really from the South
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:22.520]  China Sea the the East China Sea and from the you know the port city of Ukraine
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:28.360]  war energized the Belt and Road big time big and bingo so the so the northern
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.000]  part of that goes all the way into Europe it actually goes through through
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.440]  Ukraine goes all the way into Europe and when I say into Europe not just the
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.240]  mainland but it also goes into places like London and then you have the southern
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.080]  these are these are big deals and and these are things that the Chinese have
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:47.560]  been putting together for a long time okay a long time and now they're moving
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.400]  it much faster so the so the southern route from China yeah you have a great
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:56.960]  picture up there the southern route is really a a blue water route but then it
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:02.800]  connects into it connects into Africa and it actually now that those those blue
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.800]  lines now go all the way around Africa and they tie into places like Nigeria and
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.440]  the West Coast of Africa which are filled with resources filled with
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:15.320]  commodities that the Chinese need to sustain their own people right now one
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.280]  of the key points here one of the big connectors because you have a beautiful
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:23.640]  map up there right now that line that goes from the Arabian Sea and it goes up
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.880]  through the suit you know the Red Sea into the Suez Canal and into the
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:33.440]  Mediterranean okay that's a big big deal the United States of America we built
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:38.680]  the Suez Canal you know decades ago right we built it well guess who built a
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.680]  second Suez Canal and and you know nobody will talk about this but the
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.080]  Chinese went up there years ago during the Obama administration and they
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.480]  actually built a second Suez Canal there is a second canal there with locks
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.280]  that allow you know allow ships to go up and up and through that that very
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.400]  critical choke point into the Mediterranean so so that's those are
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:04.200]  alliances in order for the Chinese the Chinese to gain a foothold as they
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.200]  had to break alliances away from the United States and they had to then gain
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.400]  those alliances and they did that through Africa they've done that through the
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.720]  Middle East they've done that through Europe in a huge way and and of course
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:23.280]  the two big alliances and one that just recently came is starting to to show its
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.560]  skin so to speak there's a new alliance that's starting to grow and that's the
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.400]  alliance this is a dangerous one for us the alliance between China and the
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.000]  South and Saudi Arabia okay and I was gonna ask you that question that's in my
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.200]  list and Saudi Arabia is suddenly making an alliance with Iran yeah so yes so now
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.600]  so you have these a lot these are you know remember you're right I mean the
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:51.240]  enemy of my enemy is my friend so China and Saudi Arabia just affected really an
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:57.240]  economic alliance that's not good for us China and Russia already have an
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:02.400]  economic alliance China and Iran have an economic alliance Russia and Iran have
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:08.040]  an economic alliance Russia and many parts of South of Southwest Asia which
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:13.400]  is basically the Arabian Peninsula have economic alliances many of the North
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.960]  African countries have economic alliances help the Chinese just built the
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:24.160]  largest mosque in the world in on the on the coastline of Algiers in Algiers I
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:31.880]  actually saw I was actually visited there years ago on a military visit and I
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.440]  said who the hell is building this thing it's giant giant so giant mosque and
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.760]  they told me the Chinese and I said really and that was that was almost 10
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.680]  years ago Alex so so the Chinese have been very shrewdly and they've been
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.720]  doing this over time so let me do a quick minute on what's called the bricks
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:55.040]  because this has to do with economic conditions it has to do with alliances
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.400]  and it has to do with everything else going on globally particularly when we
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.000]  talk about World War 3 which we are we are smack dab in the middle of World
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.960]  War 3 right now so the bricks Brazil Russia India China and South Africa those
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:17.560]  five nations have have created a basically a coordinating body an economic
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:22.200]  coordinating body for trade and such there you go beautiful and those four
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.360]  nations right they leave that picture up those four nations right there they
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:32.760]  represent 47% of the global population so half the damn planet is represented in
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:39.440]  those people right those five leaders right there right Brazil Russia India China
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.800]  and and South Africa there have been another I would just say another ten
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:53.040]  countries that have recently moved shifted over to join these this element
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.400]  this bricks element one of the more important countries that I paid attention
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.840]  to is which way the Saudis were going and why why is that important because in
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:05.760]  the world of the in the Arab world the you know the the Egyptians have a
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:11.080]  historic leadership role and I wish Al Sisi would play a bigger role and he he
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:16.320]  does and I and I have given Al Sisi the leader of Egypt a lot of credit but the
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.440]  Saudis have a have an even greater role particularly now with the way that
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:25.280]  they're there with the way that they exist in the world their access to the
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:32.240]  old petrodollars their ability and their not only their their the the relationship
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.680]  that they have within the Arab world sort of sort of the ideological
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.200]  underpinnings but they also have a critical geo strategic position on the
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.600]  planet okay so where they sit the Arabian Sea Persian Gulf Red Sea as I as I
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.960]  mentioned as you showed in that other that other map so there's been a new
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.560]  move by the Saudis to align with with China so when that happens when that
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.600]  happens now we're talking about not just the Saudis but there's a couple of
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:03.080]  other nations Venezuela's one Iran I we are we already mentioned and there's a
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:09.160]  couple of others this these couple of other nations with the bricks they now
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:15.000]  represent about 75% of the planet and all of this has happened so when I say
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.640]  hundred years right so there's been this this has been going on for decades and
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.400]  at the same time there's been this infiltration into our our body like a
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:30.760]  cancer right I mean our body like is like a is right now has a cancer like in
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.920]  our education system in our in our in you know a lot of our institutions our
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.080]  Department of Justice right so there's a cancer in there and that cancer is part
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.560]  and parcel to the infiltration of people in the Democratic Socialist Party of
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.520]  America in the Communist Party of America and how they are how they are
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:54.480]  influenced and supported by frankly the CCP the CCP I believe made a very
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.800]  conscious decision back in the late 80s and in the in the early 90s at the tail
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.520]  end of the Cold War when it looked like when Russia was basically the loser in
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.800]  the Cold War China made a big decision to basically that they were going to rise
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.080]  they that they then took that as their opportunity to say now is our chance and
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:20.080]  and I could go through so many examples that are that are publicly available
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.960]  examples of how the Chinese have infiltrated every single institution of
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:32.200]  our of our society since the mid 90s okay and in particular our education
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.040]  system and they started at the highest level of graduate degrees and
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.000]  undergraduate degrees to the tune of no less than a hundred thousand a year and
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.960]  they got they got up to at least five hundred thousand a year and we look at
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.680]  the ideology general Flynn of the left it's very Maoist how they're executing
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:58.360]  attacks against the US so there's a you know and there's a you know a different
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:02.200]  types of communism right there's a Chinese version Russia has it has a
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.720]  version America is going to be imposed if we're not smart there you go if we're
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.800]  not smart you know there is a there is an imposition of a type of socialism
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:17.400]  being brought into America's society and frankly because people have asked me
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.480]  well Jesus you know these people are already there they already have power
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.160]  they're already wealthy what the hell more do they want they want more power
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.680]  particularly power and they and they want more wealth and they want your
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:32.600]  wealth so this is why we have to continue and again I want people to you
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:37.600]  know like me I mean I'm I'm and I appreciate your team and the patients
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.440]  that you guys have had with me you know come on today but this is important I
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.280]  mean this is a you know this is exhausting and Alex you know how
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.680]  exhausting this can be this is exhausting and I want your because I'm
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:52.920]  being brutally honest with your with you your audience and anybody else that
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:58.160]  listens to this this is exhausting but we have to do this
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.360]  every time I talk to you you're either like on the border exposing the
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:06.400]  cartels in like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.720]  city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.800]  zero of a massive chemical spill are you addicted to the danger Savannah have you
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.560]  ever considered that for a second now I'm addicted to helping my fellow
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:21.160]  Americans I'm addicted to spreading the truth and again I you know I have

[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:21.080]  this is exhausting but we have to do this I do what I do you do what you do
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:25.520]  those people that are sitting in hometown USA right now that'll listen to
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.080]  this or that will see this in the next couple of days I want you to start
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:33.880]  thinking about what more can you do what more can you do and I'm telling you I
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:38.760]  attended it because I do stuff locally because I want to lead by example so I
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:43.320]  attended a hospital a community hospital board meeting because it just so
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.800]  happens that in the county that I live in there's only two in this in the state
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.360]  of only two county hospitals in the state of Florida that are owned by the
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:54.520]  taxpayers I happen to live in one of those counties so we we tried to fill
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.840]  the the the hearing up when they were trying to tell us about how they you
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.760]  know everything's wonderful and there's no problems here folks nothing to see
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.840]  here you know nothing under the carpet right and but and we know that people
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.320]  went in there and died and the and the hospital made a ton of money we're going
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:13.160]  to continue to put pressure at the local level on that hospital that's this
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:18.920]  that's the Sarasota Memorial Hospital what are solutions you're saying get
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.560]  informed locally engaged because that's where the war is happening and I want to
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.600]  know whether it's the time we have left general flakers there's you've done a
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:31.160]  great job so much to cover here but but but bottom line how do we quantify this
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.960]  we we know that the global the Anglo-American establishment allied
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.240]  with China in 49 they gave them all the rarest minerals they have all the jobs
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.480]  they gave them internal tariffs against America they set them up we know that you
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:47.520]  briefed Obama and others and told the truth and said China's about to take
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.720]  over they're gonna double cross you you were proven right you were vindicated
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.480]  while they're so scared of you so the there's kind of a schizophrenic thing
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.600]  with the elite where they've invested in China they're in bed with China but
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:03.080]  China's now pushing them around how do we get Western elites that are even
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.800]  still globalist to finally get the American people aren't the enemy get off
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.800]  our backs let's deal with China but as you said they have this communist
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:15.000]  inclination there's so much chicom influence Hollywood is literally trying
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.640]  to tear the country apart we know for the big six Hollywood a big production
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.400]  houses are owned by the chicom's how do we get off the Chinese Communist
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:31.160]  poison okay so part of this is what you know again because you talked about it
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:36.240]  earlier in your previous segment I really appreciate that there's a time to
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:41.840]  pray and there's a time to stand okay so doesn't it doesn't mean that you can't
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:46.040]  pray while you're standing but there now is the time to stand and that time and
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:50.360]  when I say stand I mean I want people and this is everybody and there's a
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:55.480]  you know I'm trying to hit a target of people in this country that represent
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:01.720]  probably 50 million people that that are sort of left of center and they look at
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:05.960]  everything and they go oh no this is politics as usual this is not politics
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:11.600]  as usual this is this is the the existence of America as we know it is at
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:17.720]  risk we are in a moment of peril we are in a moment of historic peril so if you
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.920]  you know like people I ask if you can't do anything else say a prayer if you if
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.600]  you if you can pray you don't pray but if you can't do anything other than that
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:31.160]  and maybe or maybe what you can do is you you can send money into these
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:35.920]  different organizations that are fighting for us right fighting for for those
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.600]  that are that can't they that don't want to put their their head into the breach
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:43.680]  right that don't want to jump over the wall and say follow me I mean there's
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:48.240]  gonna be those of us and frankly we'll never outspend the the enemy in this
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:52.280]  case but we but we certainly can use the help so I just I throw that out there
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.160]  because that's important that's a that's an important aspect of being able to do
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:01.040]  the things that we need to do the third thing is is I want people to start and I
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:05.800]  want them to take a you know let 24 hours sink in and start to think you
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:09.000]  know talk to your neighbor talk to your family and start to think about what
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.360]  more can you do right where you're at maybe you pick up you know you pick up
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:17.240]  the telephone you get on your phone you start calling you start email I mean go
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.480]  to these meetings don't sit there and say it's just all baloney now those
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.240]  politicians are all crook crook and a crook they're there because we put them
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.080]  there and we have to change that we have to change that we have to go and get
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.280]  involved I I have talked to so many people over these last couple years and
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.080]  I say to them why aren't you running because they're telling me how what
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.520]  needs to be fixed and this you know this and that and they're and I'm looking
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.520]  at and I'm saying geez you're a business per your business man business woman
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:47.680]  why don't you get in there and run and and I have been able to convince a fair
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.400]  number of them to run for school boards to run for county commissioners to change
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:55.840]  the nature of the kinds of things that we are up against because I want I want
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.640]  our federal government to know that we the people we're not going to put up with
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.760]  it when they start to impose things they're going to feel a tension coming
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:07.920]  from we the people and they need to feel that tension they need to show the
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.480]  military parlance general that military parlance you're explaining
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:15.800]  everything is boots on the ground everything is every square mile and so
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:21.560]  they'll never get away with this in general public's mobilized yeah and I'm
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.520]  telling you you know what would I like I would like to you know this would be
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:28.920]  done peacefully I would like to pick a date on the wall sometime in the next
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.240]  you know couple months maybe it's the 4th of July because it's a it's a good
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.960]  date maybe it's a flag day or maybe it's Memorial Day and say I want rallies at
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:41.800]  all 50 state capitals I want I want is thousands and thousands of people to go
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:47.880]  rally and just basically say we've had enough you know fix these problems but
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:51.880]  now that I so I say that I say that because this is what they tried to do
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.520]  that's why the January 6th happened because they wanted to put the fear of
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.280]  God into every single red-blooded American out there that ever felt like
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.960]  they wanted to just go to the nation's capital and see it and you know in
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.800]  peacefully protest you know they went around trying to arrest grandmas right
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:12.560]  I mean this is insane so so they put that they did that purposely so these
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.640]  kinds of things like I just said won't happen but if we go there and we do that
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.280]  people are going to realize and the governors we have still I think I think
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.760]  26 Republican governors I mean none of these Republican governors I mean some
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:29.360]  some I shouldn't say none but but few of them are really not changing the
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.720]  narrative on our elections they really aren't I mean they're starting to push
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.360]  some of these systems out and stuff like that but that the bigger the bigger
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:42.200]  issue is we we have to create tension at the bottom to those at the top and
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.680]  that when I say those at the top the top might be county commissioners the top
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.760]  might be you know clearly are your state legislatures who are probably in some
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.560]  cases some of the people that we got to put the master on the ground with the
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.600]  issues in the info I totally agree general total genius interview today we've
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:02.640]  only got like 15 minutes left let me then move into some of the other areas
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.280]  listeners really want to know about you've given us incredible information
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:10.200]  as a former you know top army general a guy that actually ran things there are
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:13.720]  a lot of the generals just kind of sit around you were a doer and a guy that
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.200]  actually warned the world about China even got Obama to recognize it and
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:20.200]  actually change us policy that's that's a huge thing you did right there that's
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.240]  why they respected you so much because you predicted they would double cross and
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.480]  they did you did it as a loyal American even though the globalists thought they
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.240]  controlled China they literally feared you because you were you know over the
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.740]  horizon seeing it what about Russia where do you see that going back moot
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:38.280]  falling to the Russians sure the Russians have lost hundreds of thousands
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:42.000]  they're fighting NATO but they keep pouring more in the threat escalation
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.120]  ladder keeps going up and up and up and up you've got Zelensky and you've got
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.880]  his adjuncts his defense minister saying we'll use nukes you've got other
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.080]  European leaders saying nukes are okay to use they're clearly trying to push
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:56.640]  this where did Biden go from six months ago saying we can't put in front line
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.720]  battle tanks that's World War three and the escalation ladder to doing it where
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:06.160]  is that going what what's your overall view on the Russia situation now well
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:12.600]  first of all the war is a failure of politics right it's a failure of policy
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:18.440]  and so that's number one number two the Russians know how to know how to
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:23.880]  sacrifice but believe me I mean as I've studied Russian history I've studied you
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:28.480]  know the history of warfare I've studied the Europeans I mean the Russians
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:33.560]  know how to sacrifice that they and they're not losing right now and the
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:39.320]  the West the West particularly the United States we're supporting a fascist
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:46.280]  a fascist regime regime in Ukraine and I always I always say this you know let's

[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:41.680]  $100 billion if you've divided $100 billion by 435 congressional districts
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:46.320]  in this country that equals $200 million per congressional district do you
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.160]  think that there's that there's $200 million that could have been spent in
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.520]  every single congressional district instead of spending it over in the
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.480]  Ukraine nobody cares about the no American even though this this president's
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.920]  gonna say our Americans are all behind this war in Ukraine no we're not we're
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:04.760]  not behind this war Joe Biden has yet to stand in front of the American people
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:10.600]  and say here are our three or four vital national national security interests
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:16.560]  that we have not not one time has he done that and wars not been declared so
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:19.840]  should Biden how do we stop it do we impeach Biden or as you said the New
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.160]  World Times a big study and said oh my god the Russians now are behind the war
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.520]  they were against it as more Russians die they get more pro-war well I mean
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:32.320]  anybody that studies anybody knows that the British World War two or the
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:38.160]  Russians I mean the Russians are only getting more pissed so yeah but plus if
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.520]  the Russians were losing so badly which is a narrative that we're being told
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:46.840]  why do we have to keep you know flowing money and troops and all kinds of act
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:50.720]  you know and intelligence and everything into into Ukraine I mean it's
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:55.640]  because the Russians aren't losing this is this is a this is a losers war okay
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:01.000]  this is this is a losers war and everybody's gonna lose and and we're
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.200]  gonna lose big time we are going to use this as an excuse so we now the United
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.880]  States government this administration specifically those in the White House
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:14.360]  are going to use this war as an excuse to do this this financial transition and
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.480]  this health transition this coming year that's what I believe and they're
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:23.640]  gonna and they're gonna use war to do it because war is a great excuse when
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:28.520]  when everything else around you is failing and right now the exposure of
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:34.200]  of the sort of the globalist elite and what they are attempting to do to take
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.840]  over the world I mean that I'm not just you know I'm not kidding when I say this
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:42.840]  and and don't think for one second folks that they're gonna wake up tomorrow
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.840]  morning and go you know what we've just simply we've screwed the American people
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.680]  too much let's turn on our energy let's close the border let's you know hold
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:56.000]  people accountable no they're gonna triple down they are going well general
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.320]  that was my first question to get to let me ask you that when in history have
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.000]  you seen an elite that runs a powerful world dominant country undermine its
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.320]  dollar undermine its borders undermine its people poison its people create race
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:15.320]  war cut off its pipelines so the globalist or war with America that they've
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:22.560]  gotten a war with Russia why are they attacking their own power base yeah and
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:28.160]  so I'll just you know I'll say that no no country that lost its character ever
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:34.200]  kept its liberty okay and so the character of the United States of America
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:39.440]  is in the DNA of every single American and I want every single American to
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:45.960]  understand that that in our DNA is the idea of freedom and the idea of respect
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:50.760]  and the idea of what my father taught me right treat others like you like to be
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:55.320]  treated that's called the golden rule and until you treat me differently that's
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.000]  the way I'm gonna treat you and once you start treating me differently especially
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.600]  as an American we know how to fight back we might get bloodied you know on the
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.360]  in the first battle that's a very it was a very famous book called America's
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:11.480]  first battles where where the where the blood runs from Americans first until
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:15.960]  we you know get off our knees and stand up and realize we better we better get
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:19.880]  into the fight and when we do you know Katie bar the door because we're gonna
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:25.600]  we're going to win and so what I do know is that we we have not lost our
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.200]  character as a nation yet they are trying their damnedest by flooding the
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:35.040]  country with illegals by stuffing down the you know down the throats of our
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.480]  children these this fentanyl and some of these other drugs I mean they're
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:43.720]  trying their damnedest to to destroy the fabric of our society to destroy our
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.880]  culture and I want people to understand again that no country that lost its
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:52.680]  its character ever kept its liberty and they're gonna try to destroy that so we
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:57.400]  have to we have to take a stand we have to understand that you know the idea of
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:02.320]  it nothing don't believe for a second that that you're that anything is going
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:06.840]  to be handed to you right people know that people that work hard they know
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:11.720]  that nothing is gonna nothing comes without sacrifice right and so it's
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:17.280]  going to take sacrifice for us to be able to to elevate ourselves and to
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:21.520]  push back and to get healthy it's like a body right we got to get back into shape
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.640]  I want America to get back into shape and the way that we're going to get back
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:29.640]  into shape is by more and more people standing up and speaking up and standing
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:34.840]  firm and never giving up I mean you know I if I want to be an example of
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:39.160]  anything because I always looked at what was happening to me in the
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:43.360]  persecution that I went through this was really not about me this was about
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:48.000]  America I mean yeah they attacked Mike Flynn but they were attacking the
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.960]  country they they were getting rid of they were getting rid of somebody who
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.160]  knew a lot about what was going on and could have stopped a lot of what happened
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.800]  over the four years of the Trump administration and in fact I can be
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.320]  Trump's worst nightmare but I'm not because he didn't really know he really
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:08.520]  did he even even he is as smart as he is he was naive to think that what these
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.480]  people were doing they were actually going to do and they did and they did so
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:16.880]  I'll tell you let me say this yeah in the five six minutes we have left I know
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.560]  you're busy this is an amazing interview you mentioned January 6 earlier Elon
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:25.920]  Musk calls for Q shaman who it turns out they let in let in the Senate he told
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:31.240]  people leave he's spending four years in jail Elon Musk says release him we got
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:35.440]  documents four days ago they're now all of the news that the FBI suppressed
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:38.760]  documents the proud boys trial they were actually running the attack on the
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.040]  Capitol they're so scared of January 6 because they're branding the American
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:46.680]  people as terrorists and trying to turn the whole national security apparatus
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:50.800]  against us that's falling apart the head of the CDC as we mentioned earlier but
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:53.720]  then you said I'll get back to that later can you speak to that I mean that
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.840]  to have a redfield out saying gain a function this happened I want to explain
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:02.760]  this he's saying look leadership of the military but that's under you know
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.760]  globalist control because we know Obama even when Trump got in never got full
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:10.960]  control so I'm not saying China isn't involved in the attack but it's one
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:14.320]  level first they say it's China but it's globalist but above that it's
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.400]  globalist with China looking at that because now Congress has bills saying
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.160]  China launched the attack I hate the chai comms and I know they want to attack
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.520]  us and I know they wrote papers about bio weapons against us but their allies
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:31.320]  are going to pose inside the government as if that was the chai comms doing it
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:34.920]  I think the globalists are just as guilty as the chai comms and that chai
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:40.640]  comm globalist and combine must be identified so that the general American
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.200]  people don't think our government did this I think we have to educate people
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:48.640]  that a criminal group with China released the virus and the shots to collapse
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:53.720]  our civilization so how do we explain that complex issue yeah so first of all
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:57.320]  don't don't allow anybody I'm talking to your entire audience don't allow
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:01.680]  anybody to call you a conspiracy theorist I'm not talking about you Alex Jones
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:05.480]  I'm talking about you as an individual who I'm speaking to right now you know
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:09.360]  don't allow anybody to label you as anything other than who you are as a
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:13.240]  person you define yourself number one the second thing is is there is a
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:17.240]  relationship it is a clear a clear relationship between the Chinese
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:22.200]  Communist Party leadership particularly Xi and his team he's got a very small
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.680]  team of individuals who support every single thing that they're doing and
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:32.200]  this globalist group of people you know sorted by the face of them is the world
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:36.280]  economic forum that's claus Schwab and that's people like George Soros's Bill
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.960]  Gates is involved in this I mean there's there is a body of them you can go look
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:44.200]  at their website they're so public about it it's insane and they have this other
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.280]  advisor you've all know a Harari who they float around the this country and they
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.360]  float around the world talking about how how people are going to be machines and
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.400]  that God is something in the clouds and it's and now God is in Silicon Valley I
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:01.200]  mean these people are psychopaths all of them and the other thing is that you're
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.040]  going to hear people in our own government particularly the State
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:08.440]  Department oh China's not our enemy China's our competitor bullshit China is
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.080]  our adversary China wants global domination they see this century back to
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:17.120]  the hundred year war they see this century as this as the Chinese century
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:21.160]  you know last year might have been the American century this year is going to
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:25.600]  be the Chinese century and they have already begun to dominate right I
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.840]  mentioned relationships with Saudi Arabia I mentioned and these are economic
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:31.520]  relationships these are real things people can go read them read about them

[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:47.400]  think of I don't want to think of the worst case because I'm as an
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:53.080]  intelligence officer in my my years of being on the battlefield we would go
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:57.800]  worst case best case you know most likely most probable the kinds of things

[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:14.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.680]  Things happening in the middle the most probable right now for me what we
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:24.560]  really need to be doing right here in our country is I keep going back to it
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.600]  is I call it local action will have a national impact and people go ah that's
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:34.360]  not because the people in Washington DC I mean the weaponization subcommittee
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.000]  should have already issued 500 subpoenas. No it's just let me stop you let me
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.080]  leave back it was it was doctors and scientists and others it was locals
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.480]  nurses doctors saying no it was people at city council saying no the feds are
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.280]  so scared of people at school board saying no the critical race theory and
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:55.080]  drag queen pedophile time and all the rest of it it really is us not submitting
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:48:01.920]  is what defeats the system. It's the one mom it's the one mom that stands there
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:05.760]  for and gets her three minutes in front of a school board and dresses them down
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:10.720]  okay it's the father who goes in front of a school board or a committee and
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:16.680]  dresses them down because his daughter was just raped by a by a boy who was
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:21.520]  allowed to go into the girls room I mean this and and that that actually happened
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:27.640]  up in up in Virginia so I mean he right he right two when he went to girls in
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:34.960]  Virginia. Yeah there was two assaults that I'm aware but it's it's it's that
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:39.560]  one mom I look at a crowd of 5,000 people when I when I'm out speaking in
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:43.760]  different places and I look around and I as I'm as I'm trying to you know get my
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.680]  points across to the audience and I say to the audience look I don't need all of
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:51.920]  you to go out and do that I just I'm looking for one I'm looking for one
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:57.440]  because sometimes that's all it takes it takes one but what if what if 20% what
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:03.000]  if imagine if everybody just mobilized exactly it's over exactly exactly I may
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.920]  not like I say I mean I would I would love to have leaders in all the states
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:11.920]  that we have you know you know it I mean in all 50 states but certainly maybe
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:15.320]  there's some more important states politically you know from an election
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.120]  perspective but maybe we have you know maybe we have giant rallies I mean we've
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:23.360]  got to mobilize the you know we the people right and and you can mobilize
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.560]  when there's a school board hearing you can mobilize when there's a county
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.280]  commission hearing you can when there's an open seat I can tell you that there
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.760]  are there are hundreds of thousands of volunteer positions that are still
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:38.080]  unfilled because the American people and I hate to say it folks but we've been
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:43.840]  lazy and apathetic as a society over the last 20 30 years and we've let the you
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.920]  know all this griping I've heard all this you know BS about all those
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:51.720]  politicians are all corrupt well it's our fault we've been putting them in
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:55.840]  there so we got to stop that General Flynn I totally agree in the few minutes
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:01.480]  general Flynn calm few of us we have left big picture though I'm optimistic I
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.280]  see a huge awakening I see all these talk show hosts that were scared now
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:07.840]  telling the truth I see all these hearings were gain of functions coming
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.800]  out and the illegal spy combine with all these agencies I mean things are a lot
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:16.280]  better than they were two years ago it seems like the awakening curve the
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:20.960]  educational curve is going straight up right now in closing comments you get
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.760]  the last five minutes you've got the floor other key points you'd like to
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:27.680]  have I really want to thank you for your time yeah thank you Alex and thank you
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.960]  to your great audience and thank you for just being you know I say courage is a
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:37.320]  decision it becomes contagious after you make a decision to be courageous and I
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:41.160]  appreciate the decision that you made to continue to be courageous for this
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:49.200]  country so it kind of big picture I actually see things in a very you know
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:55.720]  very like lit or lighted way I have my path is lighted and part of it is because
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:02.080]  I have a very strong basis of faith so I you know like God wins right and I
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:06.680]  believe that you know I wear it on my sleeve but I that the path in front of
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:11.600]  me is a very bright path and it's bright because of what I try to address
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:16.880]  earlier what is in the character of each one of us and I think it was my
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:20.120]  belief strongly in fact what's in the character of every American is we're
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:25.600]  just not gonna we're not gonna allow this country to be stolen from us you know
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.760]  in in in plain sight and how we're going to do that we're gonna create
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:35.080]  alternative ideas we're gonna create alternative paths we like like a lot of
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:38.920]  these doctors have already started to stand up other alternative medical
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:43.320]  capabilities I think this banking system this banking crisis that we're
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.960]  involved in right now I actually think that we're gonna see a lot of good come
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:50.720]  out of this but part of what the government and we need to demand this
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:54.000]  we need to demand that people are held accountable don't start closing banks
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.400]  don't start making a run take a deep breath to be studied there's got to be
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:01.840]  accountability but all these things are going to start to happen and they're
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.240]  gonna happen even more so because we're going to continue to expose these
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:09.240]  bastards and they need to be exposed and the more we expose them like guys like
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:14.920]  Fauci he's the face of this disastrous murderous you know COVID nightmare that
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:20.000]  the at the world went through right so we have to hold these people accountable
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.320]  and we have to we have to demand that to be held accountable and I think that
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:28.920]  that exposure the the education the understanding of who these globalist
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:33.880]  elites are who they are are really important I think I you know I'm gonna
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:38.840]  put a plug in here for because you're showing my my Twitter site there for
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:44.120]  Elon Elon Musk I actually think you know I'm gonna stop this is incredible my
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:48.360]  last question was what do you make of Elon Musk I mean I judge his rebots
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:51.960]  fruits I don't trust him but man is he kicking their ass I was about to ask you
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:56.480]  will you call an Elon Musk to take what would general Flynn say to Elon Musk we
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:59.840]  should get you guys together sorry this is incredible my next thing was was
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:05.920]  Elon Musk yeah well I actually think that Elon Musk is doing a service for
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:10.880]  the world now you know I've met Elon Musk briefly a number of years ago
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:14.800]  whether or not he would he remembers that meeting but it was it was a good
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:21.000]  meeting actually so what Elon Musk is doing for the world right now is he's
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.840]  opening up and exposing like I mean like we've never seen exposed the the deepest
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:32.600]  of it and darkest of the of the state that exists right this deep state and
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:36.560]  this is not just America we're learning a lot of things about America you know
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:40.520]  one of the things and and you could put it on there the this Schellenberger
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:44.520]  report Schellenberger is one of the guys that did the Twitter Twitter files his
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:50.240]  his I read I read excerpts from his it's about a 60 some page document or maybe
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:55.880]  longer I read excerpts of it from it you know what what Elon is doing yeah this
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:59.400]  is another one this guy right here Kramer he Kramer says there you go you
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:03.240]  got to go invest in in Silicon Valley Bank only a couple of weeks ago and
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:07.880]  they're in there collapse that guy right there I he did the same thing in 2007 so
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:13.960]  I'm sorry I'm I'm on a tangent but what I was gonna play that clip it's insane he
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:17.840]  obviously when groups about to go down he tries to get new investors in so the
