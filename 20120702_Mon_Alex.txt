[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.860]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.860 --> 00:35.080]  strap yourselves in my friends because we are going in to the rabbit hole and
[00:35.080 --> 00:39.040]  going all the way to the bottom today worldwide broadcast thank you so much for
[00:39.040 --> 00:46.280]  joining us there is so much news up at info wars.com right now but I also
[00:46.280 --> 00:53.960]  want to out of the gates give the phone number out because I tend to listen to
[00:53.960 --> 00:59.540]  my rebroadcast sometimes and it's unlistable other times it is absolute
[00:59.540 --> 01:08.860]  on-target crystalline veritas but a lot of the times I am so overheated so
[01:08.860 --> 01:15.100]  angry that it's almost like a gibbering and it's the callers and the guests that
[01:15.100 --> 01:18.820]  really make the show now I don't go off with radio consultants tell me I don't
[01:18.820 --> 01:22.500]  go off what the news says to me I go off when I listen when I think of the
[01:22.500 --> 01:27.500]  broadcast now undoubtedly the broadcast is authentic and it's expanding and it's
[01:27.500 --> 01:32.980]  very popular which is good because we face great adversity and great threats
[01:32.980 --> 01:37.700]  to our liberties and basic freedoms we don't overturn this globalist system and
[01:37.700 --> 01:44.180]  effected awakening but I am fully aware of the fact that we are not even
[01:44.180 --> 01:48.940]  beginning to maximize the true potential of this platform that we have
[01:48.940 --> 01:59.500]  here I need to find that quiet focused place where I can really articulate
[01:59.500 --> 02:04.940]  what's happening but then others say oh no don't don't stop ranting don't stop
[02:04.940 --> 02:09.260]  blowing up that's what we like well yeah you can't argue with success but I don't
[02:09.260 --> 02:16.100]  like it I don't like it people think oh this is an act when you're blowing up
[02:16.100 --> 02:20.740]  no no no it's not an act I believe me I wish it was and I think it has a
[02:20.740 --> 02:24.340]  physical effect on me as well I mean there's a reason I look like I'm 45 or
[02:24.340 --> 02:29.940]  50 and I'm 38 it's because I get really angry a lot and get extremely exhausted
[02:29.940 --> 02:32.940]  later in the day because of it I've learned when I don't blow up a bunch or
[02:32.940 --> 02:39.740]  I'm not on the radio that I feel great and I'm happy and then when I go into a
[02:39.740 --> 02:46.500]  long diatribe of ranting I'm exhausted now we have victories against tyranny I
[02:46.500 --> 02:50.180]  feel great I I think it's the the feeling of being
[02:50.180 --> 02:56.220]  suffocated or buried alive by bureaucrats and other control freaks that is
[02:56.220 --> 03:01.020]  having this effect on me I think it's having the effect on a lot of people a
[03:01.020 --> 03:04.780]  lot of people just feel overwhelmed by the tyranny so they give up learned
[03:04.780 --> 03:12.300]  helplessness and roll over we cannot do that as a society we can't because we
[03:12.300 --> 03:16.100]  have a very virulent nasty form of corruption on our hands and it must be
[03:16.100 --> 03:20.060]  defeated so I think the answer is stop frustrating ourselves that we can't
[03:20.060 --> 03:24.540]  bring them all down at one time focus on the victories we're having and there are
[03:24.540 --> 03:28.620]  a lot of them and learn from those victories and learn from our defeats and
[03:28.620 --> 03:34.580]  just start prosecuting a war against the tyrants in the info war discrediting
[03:34.580 --> 03:38.940]  them videotaping them when they're out in public catching them in crimes even of
[03:38.940 --> 03:42.660]  the corrupt court system won't go after them so-called justice system we can
[03:42.660 --> 03:47.380]  destroy them in the court of a public opinion start really going after these
[03:47.380 --> 03:52.540]  people our our our people that is free humanity people that recognize good from
[03:52.540 --> 03:56.020]  evil we're everywhere that's what they're scared of it's why they want this big
[03:56.020 --> 03:59.580]  control grid in place and the surveillance system our people are
[03:59.580 --> 04:04.580]  everywhere I want to talk about this when we come back and it's time for us to
[04:04.580 --> 04:11.060]  start behaving like it and sabotaging the globalist through peaceful lawful
[04:11.060 --> 04:21.340]  means everywhere we can now is the time now is the time I mean if you're a
[04:21.340 --> 04:25.780]  caddy on a golf course and some globalist is sitting there talking about
[04:25.780 --> 04:29.980]  cheating on their wife if you can get the intel get the data get it out put it
[04:29.980 --> 04:34.900]  on YouTube destroy them if you catch somebody to engage in corruption that's
[04:34.900 --> 04:40.300]  a globalist rat them out and if that doesn't work report it on the media I
[04:40.300 --> 04:44.020]  mean just get whatever you can you won't get them every time but just hurt
[04:44.020 --> 04:49.060]  these people hurt these people hurt these people we are the counter revolution
[04:49.060 --> 04:55.140]  against tyranny we are 1776 I'll boil down the big news when we come back tell

[08:09.980 --> 08:13.460]  GCN radio network
[08:21.460 --> 08:28.860]  thank you for joining us it is the second day of July 2012 we are going to be
[08:28.860 --> 08:33.860]  here for the next three hours I am your host Alex Jones dedicated to exposing
[08:33.860 --> 08:39.540]  corruption and the global government that is establishing a kleptocratic
[08:39.540 --> 08:46.140]  planetary dictatorship to engage in whatever abuses of humanity they wish I
[08:46.140 --> 08:51.420]  do not want to be a slave I know most of you don't want to be slaves so I am
[08:51.420 --> 08:56.660]  rising up through the technocracy using their control grid system against them
[08:56.660 --> 09:04.620]  this is a 21st century slave revolt if you want freedom fight for it now or be
[09:04.620 --> 09:09.860]  a slave now I want to just give the number out right now first-time callers
[09:09.860 --> 09:17.020]  I'm gonna go to your calls in two minutes the number is 8002599231 on the
[09:17.020 --> 09:20.660]  health care debacle what do you think is the worst part of it that it's run by
[09:20.660 --> 09:24.580]  the IRS that they'll garnish your wages that it gives government control of the
[09:24.580 --> 09:29.140]  type of health care you get that it's a direct tax to the banksters and their
[09:29.140 --> 09:35.500]  dependent servant class that Elena Kagan helped package what Mitt Romney wrote
[09:35.500 --> 09:39.860]  and then she ruled on it totally illegal I mean what is the worst facet
[09:39.860 --> 09:46.540]  that's a question for you 8002599231 because I know people are chomping at
[09:46.540 --> 09:49.700]  the bit so I want to go to calls early before I get to a bunch of the news
[09:49.700 --> 09:52.900]  because then I'll probably never get to your calls if I start getting to all
[09:52.900 --> 09:58.540]  the news speaking of news here is some of the news but again the number is
[09:58.540 --> 10:11.900]  8002599231 if you go up to info wars.com if you go there to the site you
[10:11.900 --> 10:18.660]  will notice new socialist French nanny state mandates breathalyzers in all
[10:18.660 --> 10:24.060]  cars move to install similar devices in American cars underway I told you ten
[10:24.060 --> 10:27.540]  years ago they're gonna have cameras that watch you in your car they're already
[10:27.540 --> 10:31.700]  all over the outside of the cars you pay for it they claim it's a safety
[10:31.700 --> 10:39.540]  feature and that they are going to expand on that with breathalyzers and
[10:39.540 --> 10:44.580]  this is again just the incredible control all over the country local police
[10:44.580 --> 10:48.740]  departments are getting giant armored vehicles used in Iraq that's another
[10:48.740 --> 10:55.340]  report DHF gives UC Berkeley armored personnel carrier used in the battlefield
[10:55.340 --> 11:02.220]  in Iraq look at this report Olympic whistleblower fears for safety reveals
[11:02.220 --> 11:08.580]  identity and we are going to be talking to him just briefly with an update in
[11:08.580 --> 11:13.940]  about 20 minutes and we'll go back into your calls and news but he's now revealed
[11:13.940 --> 11:22.220]  who he is he's a famous director and TV show producer but this is a big deal and
[11:22.220 --> 11:26.180]  I know Tony Gosling who first broke this on his radio showing on as a
[11:26.180 --> 11:31.580]  credible guy so that's why we went with it and now he's been basically been
[11:31.580 --> 11:38.820]  threatened so he's gone public he also worked with this director who was going
[11:38.820 --> 11:46.300]  by the gnome to plume Lee Hazel Dean has now released what his real name is and
[11:46.300 --> 11:53.100]  that's up in the story breaking at info wars dot com and he says that he fears
[11:53.100 --> 11:59.700]  for his safety he was the guy that was able to infiltrate he was able to
[11:59.700 --> 12:07.660]  infiltrate a g4 s security and talk about how they're saying there will be a
[12:07.660 --> 12:12.220]  giant event London will be evacuated this is a very credible guy this is what
[12:12.220 --> 12:16.060]  they're telling the security guards doesn't mean it's gonna happen they
[12:16.060 --> 12:20.140]  routinely do this just to just to sigh off the police and military because they
[12:20.140 --> 12:24.500]  found by telling him it will happen the brain actually registers it as if it's
[12:24.500 --> 12:29.580]  already happened and so it creates this culture of absolute hysteria in fact I
[12:29.580 --> 12:36.820]  was reading the statistics of murders on college campuses and statistically they're
[12:36.820 --> 12:40.380]  one of the safest places in the country but now they're getting all these SWAT
[12:40.380 --> 12:45.060]  teams armored vehicles you name it and the excuse out in California for the
[12:45.060 --> 12:50.260]  wheeled tanks is somebody thought they saw a gun last year oh my gosh thought
[12:50.260 --> 12:54.220]  they saw a gun better have men with machine guns in big black tanks that's
[12:54.220 --> 12:58.420]  what you ought to be afraid of in history the founders told us that history
[12:58.420 --> 13:02.900]  shows that let me read part of this now we'll go to your calls Olympics whistle
[13:02.900 --> 13:06.300]  blower fears for safety reveals identity I'm now afraid that I might be in
[13:06.300 --> 13:10.900]  physical danger the undercover journalist who blew the whistle on g4 s the
[13:10.900 --> 13:15.060]  security company responsible for the 2012 Olympics along with shocking plans for
[13:15.060 --> 13:20.020]  an evacuation of London has revealed his identity after following fears for his
[13:20.020 --> 13:24.980]  safety Lee Hazel Dean the whistleblower who exposed how he infiltrated the g4s
[13:24.980 --> 13:30.700]  as an employee and undercover how security and uncovered how security
[13:30.700 --> 13:35.980]  preparations for the Olympics were so poor that they were inviting a terrorist
[13:35.980 --> 13:39.820]  attack has revealed himself to be Ben Fellows an acclaimed director who has
[13:39.820 --> 13:43.360]  worked with Stanley Kubrick fellows has also appeared in numerous popular
[13:43.360 --> 13:48.820]  television and theater shows produced him you name it so he's a famous guy in
[13:48.820 --> 13:53.060]  England just look him up that's who came on our show that's who whistleblower
[13:53.060 --> 13:58.220]  and he had a TV show in England that exposed corruption that basically got
[13:58.220 --> 14:01.980]  censored and taken off the air because the government controls broadcast they
[14:01.980 --> 14:06.100]  they charge you a tax for your for your television by the way France charges
[14:06.100 --> 14:09.340]  attacks and now it's going to be on every computer screen including your
[14:09.340 --> 14:14.300]  smartphone and of course here we get forced Obama announcements over the
[14:14.300 --> 14:17.620]  phones they're now testing in New York and New Jersey that takes your phone
[14:17.620 --> 14:22.500]  over and has its own ring the bureaucratic state knows you're starting to
[14:22.500 --> 14:28.660]  wake up so they are throwing everything at us now see see folks it isn't going
[14:28.660 --> 14:31.580]  to take a majority to defeat tyranny it took three percent to start the
[14:31.580 --> 14:37.180]  Revolutionary War five percent to win it we've got way more than that twenty
[14:37.180 --> 14:40.580]  thirty percent are really awake another thirty percent are starting to wake up
[14:40.580 --> 14:44.820]  that's what the system is panicking so what a thirty forty percent want to suck
[14:44.820 --> 14:49.380]  their thumbs and only go to ball games and we'll put up with anything I mean I
[14:49.380 --> 14:54.580]  see grown men when police pull them over just start groveling in fear and
[14:54.580 --> 14:59.900]  begging I mean this is a nation that's filled with great people but also a lot
[14:59.900 --> 15:03.660]  of weirdo cowards and it's always the same type of guys that'll bow up to you
[15:03.660 --> 15:11.700]  for no reason at the gym or whatever or strut around will grovel to corruption
[15:11.700 --> 15:15.300]  they'll sit there while the CPS takes their two-year-old for no reason to
[15:15.300 --> 15:18.300]  just drug them up and probably rape the living daylights out of them they won't
[15:18.300 --> 15:21.500]  even speak up or fight back they'll just say I don't know why the government did
[15:21.500 --> 15:25.460]  this to me but they'll strut around sticking their chest out acting real
[15:25.460 --> 15:36.020]  tough all day this is the type of garbage that we are dealing with and that we
[15:36.020 --> 15:41.420]  are facing as a society I mean last night I worked till 10 o'clock at night
[15:41.420 --> 15:47.540]  up here and I was driving home and I saw cop cars all over the place it must
[15:47.540 --> 15:51.580]  have been some Travis County thing as it happened out in the county but I went
[15:51.580 --> 15:55.780]  down one major road and there were police cars pulling out behind people
[15:55.780 --> 15:59.460]  who were doing the speed limit I normally speed about 5-10 miles over the
[15:59.460 --> 16:03.260]  speed limit sometimes more though I was real tired and relaxed listen to music
[16:03.260 --> 16:06.940]  back and forth would talk radio I'm driving all about in the country so it
[16:06.940 --> 16:11.260]  takes about 35 minutes to get out there and I'm driving and I see cars that are
[16:11.260 --> 16:15.540]  almost unmarked you know what I'm talking about where they have you know
[16:15.540 --> 16:19.140]  like dark blue but then they says police on the side you can't really see other
[16:19.140 --> 16:24.980]  black and it says police but it's barely a shade lighter and two different times
[16:24.980 --> 16:33.060]  a cop would pull out behind me get behind me and and then speed off around
[16:33.060 --> 16:36.620]  me and then pull somebody else over they pulled a Cadillac and then some little
[16:36.620 --> 16:44.020]  Honda over and I watched it I'm like those cars weren't speeding both times
[16:44.020 --> 16:48.180]  they were just randomly pulling people over or I guess pulling up maybe they

[18:03.620 --> 18:08.660]  since there's all gun ammo accessory results we posted the firearms blog
[18:08.660 --> 18:11.460]  report and I went and checked we've got a Google store we never used I went and
[18:11.460 --> 18:16.820]  checked it we got the notice three days ago back on Friday and confirmed it
[18:16.820 --> 18:20.460]  posted it dredgerport.com picked it up it wasn't a lower right hand corner
[18:20.460 --> 18:24.620]  earlier when I was looking the point is is that it's here it's happening okay I
[18:24.620 --> 18:27.940]  said I'd go to your calls and of course I didn't I'm gonna come back and go to
[18:27.940 --> 18:33.620]  Adam then I'm gonna go to Tom and a few others so have your point ready we're
[18:33.620 --> 18:37.700]  gonna try to move quick which means sloth speed when it comes to me taking
[18:37.700 --> 18:44.540]  calls and then we're gonna have the film director TV host producer who
[18:44.540 --> 18:50.340]  infiltrated the Olympic security team and says that they're mashing trips
[18:50.340 --> 18:53.660]  secretly but it's admitted they've actually I looked up what he said it's
[18:53.660 --> 19:00.180]  actually been blurbed that that there is no security basically and that it's all
[19:00.180 --> 19:04.860]  a big joke people tried to selling drugs when he was in there and it's just all
[19:04.860 --> 19:11.740]  a complete scam and that he's been told there will be a giant event at the end
[19:11.740 --> 19:16.100]  of the Olympics now I'm seeing all these rumors being pumped out about the
[19:16.100 --> 19:21.100]  Olympics and I went and look where they came from it comes from the mainstream
[19:21.100 --> 19:24.980]  media in the last six months and the Rockefeller Foundation looking up saying
[19:24.980 --> 19:30.620]  there'd be a terror attack they wrote a future plan perspective predicting a
[19:30.620 --> 19:34.820]  terror attack three years ago at this Olympics we wrote an article about that
[19:34.820 --> 19:39.620]  a few weeks ago the point is then BBC is coming out with reports as Paul Watson
[19:39.620 --> 19:43.980]  was contacted by him and I've seen other reports saying conspiracy theorists are
[19:43.980 --> 19:47.940]  saying it's gonna be attacked so they put out there's gonna be an attack create
[19:47.940 --> 19:52.340]  all this fear then don't have an attack and then blame us for saying there'd be
[19:52.340 --> 19:57.100]  an attack when we never said that of course the media also says there's no
[19:57.100 --> 20:03.340]  drones either when I hear about natural disasters and the danger of having no
[20:03.340 --> 20:07.900]  water I'm not worried why because I have an aquapod got it from my patreon

[24:23.540 --> 24:29.780]  control freaks let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Ohio listening on 770 a.m. w.a.i.s
[24:29.780 --> 24:34.540]  thank you for joining us Adam thanks for having me Alex it's an honor and a
[24:34.540 --> 24:39.180]  pleasure to speak with you you're chatting about the Supreme Court two
[24:39.180 --> 24:42.540]  things on that I just wanted to mention there real quick of course on the
[24:42.540 --> 24:46.780]  affordable health care thing you know there's no sense in picking out a
[24:46.780 --> 24:50.100]  specific the whole thing's garbage but the point that I've been trying to make
[24:50.100 --> 24:53.940]  the folks and it seems to work pretty well is to make the point that you know
[24:53.940 --> 24:57.500]  when the conversation on this issue started it was about how we were all
[24:57.500 --> 25:01.580]  paying too much and by the time it was over it was about how we're not paying
[25:01.580 --> 25:07.660]  them enough and that seems wow I mean in days of ranting I haven't made that
[25:07.660 --> 25:13.140]  point and unbelievably clear and consistent to the heart of the matter
[25:13.140 --> 25:17.060]  issue that you just raised remember how it was going to lower prices they've
[25:17.060 --> 25:21.740]  already gone up over 25% the insurance companies wrote this to rip people off
[25:21.740 --> 25:26.380]  the stupid gullible gimme gimme gimme class of course a lot of them just lost
[25:26.380 --> 25:30.780]  their jobs deindustrialization or people that are also you know just hoping
[25:30.780 --> 25:34.860]  thought they'd get something good but all they're gonna get is a giant screw
[25:34.860 --> 25:39.100]  job that's right and that seems to go pretty well over people I haven't heard
[25:39.100 --> 25:43.140]  a good response from Obama supporters from that one that's a good stumper there
[25:43.140 --> 25:46.220]  if you're talking to folks the other thing I thought was interesting in the
[25:46.220 --> 25:49.900]  rulings that were released last week if I understood it correctly there was a
[25:49.900 --> 25:54.380]  case involving Montana where the state of Montana had said you know we got a
[25:54.380 --> 25:58.220]  hundred-year-old law against the corporation you know corporate
[25:58.220 --> 26:01.860]  personhood and the Supreme Court I believe said that well we don't care
[26:01.860 --> 26:06.260]  citizens united stands we're trumping your you know assertion of states right
[26:06.260 --> 26:11.380]  so I'd be curious to see what the state of Montana is going to do given that you
[26:11.380 --> 26:14.660]  know they had a century of legal precedent in their state that no
[26:14.660 --> 26:19.780]  corporations are not people and the Supreme Court you know last week said
[26:19.780 --> 26:23.820]  well you know too bad for you so you know that'll be interesting to see how
[26:23.820 --> 26:27.820]  that plays out and the only other thing I was going to mention I'm down here in
[26:27.820 --> 26:31.380]  southern Ohio we just had them big storms come in most areas around here
[26:31.380 --> 26:35.460]  haven't had power in days and told we're not going to have it for a week I'll
[26:35.460 --> 26:39.980]  tell you what this is a good good test to see I mean I try to be prepared and I
[26:39.980 --> 26:44.140]  realized how little prepared I was and you know I went to the grocery store as
[26:44.140 --> 26:47.500]  soon as the power went off thinking I'd get some stuff and you know most of the
[26:47.500 --> 26:52.700]  young people were just crowding in the liquor store it is it's wake-up call you
[26:52.700 --> 26:56.100]  know what I mean it's time to get ready now before it's more serious than just a
[26:56.100 --> 26:59.580]  storm knocking some lines down you know I'm glad you wow what an amazing call
[26:59.580 --> 27:03.980]  I'm I'm glad you raised that point because that's next in my stack after we
[27:03.980 --> 27:09.140]  take some calls and I have our guest on is that this shows you government can't
[27:09.140 --> 27:13.900]  and won't protect you and the federal government is criticizing right now the
[27:13.900 --> 27:18.340]  power companies when they got hit basically by an inland hurricane and
[27:18.340 --> 27:22.740]  the government is working to shut down power plants to jack up prices and
[27:22.740 --> 27:27.580]  saying consumptions bad so that a few insiders make more money who are exempt
[27:27.580 --> 27:32.380]  like General Electric that Obama gave a waiver to over two years ago or no I
[27:32.380 --> 27:36.500]  guess it was in February of last year since year and a half ago I mean it's
[27:36.500 --> 27:41.020]  just off the charts the level of corruption and DC's without power
[27:41.020 --> 27:46.140]  cell phones are off and I feel bad for the people of DC but wouldn't it be nice
[27:46.140 --> 27:50.060]  if the White House and Congress the power was off forever I mean think of
[27:50.060 --> 27:54.140]  how good our lives would be without those criminals taking our tax money our
[27:54.140 --> 27:58.660]  labor and then giving us 30 cents on the dollar back and telling us it's free
[27:58.660 --> 28:02.220]  money and how great they are thank you for the points and we're gonna be
[28:02.220 --> 28:05.340]  covering that and for people that are able to call will be taking your calls
[28:05.340 --> 28:10.220]  in the second hour on that subject and others I'd like to hear how it is there
[28:10.220 --> 28:14.460]  it's one of some of the worst power outages in the last 50 years because
[28:14.460 --> 28:19.540]  of the record heat Tom in Maryland a KU band satellite listener yeah we're on
[28:19.540 --> 28:28.780]  the KU bands TV as well thank you Tom for joining us good afternoon Alex I
[28:28.780 --> 28:34.100]  noticed some time ago you were wanting our nicknames for the media I have a few
[28:34.100 --> 28:40.700]  if you haven't gotten a moron media Molok media Mickey Mouse media I wanted to
[28:40.700 --> 28:45.100]  mention something that Obama supporters seem to have a bad case of
[28:45.100 --> 28:54.820]  Obamianism I think Obama supporters are obamunists I got two songs I want to
[28:54.820 --> 28:59.020]  recommend for you because I know you're gonna like them on one is from a artist
[28:59.020 --> 29:03.580]  named Bruce Dickinson the vocalist from Iron Maiden put out a song in the 1990s
[29:03.580 --> 29:08.820]  called I will not accept the truth and that's a perfect song for you and your
[29:08.820 --> 29:14.460]  show and there's another song by Ingve Malmsteen called rise up and I believe
[29:14.460 --> 29:21.420]  you will absolutely positively love both of those songs and that's really all I
[29:21.420 --> 29:26.380]  wanted to say was throw the terms Obamianism and Obamianist statue you
[29:26.380 --> 29:30.380]  know we've been on a KU band for more than a decade I always forget the
[29:30.380 --> 29:35.500]  frequencies we're on what frequency are you listening to us on KU band

[30:03.380 --> 30:07.700]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[30:07.700 --> 30:11.860]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[30:11.860 --> 30:15.900]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:15.900 --> 30:19.780]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.780 --> 30:23.900]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:23.900 --> 30:28.220]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.220 --> 30:32.540]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.540 --> 30:36.260]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[33:29.860 --> 33:34.620]  know me when you see me well it's big giant offshore banks that publicly
[33:34.620 --> 33:43.180]  bragging hundreds of publications and of course on CNBC that they own us and
[33:43.180 --> 33:48.100]  how did they do it they took mortgages and other financial instruments and
[33:48.100 --> 33:53.620]  leverage them to close to the power of infinity creating fraudulent paper to
[33:53.620 --> 33:58.100]  buy up the world through fraud and when the Ponzi scheme went into retrograde
[33:58.100 --> 34:01.980]  they had the governments of the world that they had gotten their personnel
[34:01.980 --> 34:06.860]  into the highest positions of shine the public on to the debt but wait there was
[34:06.860 --> 34:11.700]  more they had the dinosaur prostitute media lie to everyone while wearing
[34:11.700 --> 34:17.380]  $3,000 suits with info babes licking their lips and told you that it was your
[34:17.380 --> 34:22.140]  debt and that you were lazy and stupid mad they had to raise taxes and set up
[34:22.140 --> 34:27.900]  some checkpoints and put the army on the streets and have the TSA abuse you in
[34:27.900 --> 34:32.260]  your family because terrorists were hiding under every table meanwhile they
[34:32.260 --> 34:40.420]  publicly funded Al Qaeda now shifting gears ladies and gentlemen last week we
[34:40.420 --> 34:47.460]  had a an anonymous whistleblower on but we did not just have the anonymous
[34:47.460 --> 34:54.220]  whistleblower on the broadcast without first doing some checking and Tony
[34:54.220 --> 35:02.300]  Gosling of Builderburg dot org he has a radio show in England and has broken a
[35:02.300 --> 35:07.540]  lot of big stories over the years as a journalist he said no I can vouch for
[35:07.540 --> 35:11.900]  this guy he's the real deal and his story also fit into things we've seen in
[35:11.900 --> 35:17.380]  other big events G20 NATO you name it they're always used to attack the
[35:17.380 --> 35:21.860]  general public have military on the streets I have daytime nighttime curfews
[35:21.860 --> 35:26.580]  have badges so they can get the police and media all trained basically on hot
[35:26.580 --> 35:34.140]  martial law as they ease the rest of the country's outlying areas into a softer
[35:34.140 --> 35:40.580]  martial law and he made some amazing allegations that I'll have him repeat
[35:40.580 --> 35:46.820]  here today but he went by Lee Hazel Dean and when he was on the show I think he
[35:46.820 --> 35:50.660]  said a little too much about himself you know he said yeah I worked on this
[35:50.660 --> 35:54.620]  national TV show I worked on that national TV show yes he appeared in them
[35:54.620 --> 36:05.340]  he he worked on him he produced some of them his real name of course is not Lee
[36:05.340 --> 36:12.780]  Hazel Dean the whistleblower exposed how he had infiltrated g4s security as an
[36:12.780 --> 36:17.100]  employee and undercover how security preparations for the Olympics were so
[36:17.100 --> 36:20.940]  poor that they were inviting a terrorist attack how they were massing troops in
[36:20.940 --> 36:25.340]  the area he also revealed that they were saying there'd be a big event he has
[36:25.340 --> 36:32.020]  now at the end of the Olympics it would be the biggest event in in in recent
[36:32.020 --> 36:36.420]  times he revealed himself to be Ben Fellows and acclaimed director who has
[36:36.420 --> 36:40.780]  worked with Stanley Kubrick that actually gets me a little bit envious
[36:40.780 --> 36:45.140]  it's very hard for me to get envious fellows has also appeared in numerous
[36:45.140 --> 36:51.420]  popular television and theater shows and he's made the decision to reveal his
[36:51.420 --> 36:55.100]  identity after having gone under a pseudonym for the purposes of radio
[36:55.100 --> 36:59.420]  interviews conducted over the last week because of fears for his safety we'll
[36:59.420 --> 37:03.940]  find out why he's fearing for his safety and he will recap what's happened to him
[37:03.940 --> 37:07.700]  at the article with all the bullet points and why this is so important is up
[37:07.700 --> 37:11.300]  at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com right now
[37:11.300 --> 37:17.420]  Olympics whistleblower fears for safety reveals identity and he joins us now
[37:17.420 --> 37:23.700]  from from England. Ben good to have you on the broadcast with us. Hi Alex it's
[37:23.700 --> 37:30.780]  really good to be back with you. Well recap who you are what you discovered
[37:30.780 --> 37:34.380]  and and then now what started happening to make you think that you may be in
[37:34.380 --> 37:41.380]  danger. Okay well I wanted to do an expose on G4S I'd heard a lot of horror
[37:41.380 --> 37:45.380]  stories and I was looking for an opportunity to basically go and work
[37:45.380 --> 37:48.260]  for them and see what they were like and see if these horror stories were true
[37:48.260 --> 37:51.820]  because you never can really believe what other people say you have to go and
[37:51.820 --> 37:55.860]  look it on the internet and and join these organizations and actually find
[37:55.860 --> 37:59.940]  out so when the Olympics came up it was a perfect opportunity to go and see
[37:59.940 --> 38:05.020]  exactly what their working practices were like and and and see you know what
[38:05.020 --> 38:09.860]  this organization was about and really you know I got there and it was a
[38:09.860 --> 38:16.660]  catalog of disasters you know the x-ray machine operators didn't know what
[38:16.660 --> 38:19.740]  they were looking at they said they were going to turn off the metal detectors in
[38:19.740 --> 38:23.540]  peak times I was asked to take a knife through a metal detector that didn't go
[38:23.540 --> 38:26.980]  off and they said add more metal to your body like the keys or a mobile phone
[38:26.980 --> 38:30.620]  which I did and then it went off so really they're not very sensitive and
[38:30.620 --> 38:34.500]  as far as I'm concerned the key job of the metal detector is to pick up metal
[38:34.500 --> 38:39.860]  and they weren't they told us about an evacuation of London that if this was to
[38:39.860 --> 38:44.500]  happen that we would be responsible for looking after the members of the public
[38:44.500 --> 38:50.580]  they talked about 200,000 casket linings and when I asked them what the casket
[38:50.580 --> 38:54.980]  lining they said it's like a plastic coffin that fits four people and that
[38:54.980 --> 39:00.420]  to me got me thinking of like well why would you have that okay on one hand you
[39:00.420 --> 39:05.300]  could say all right it's the Olympics you never know what's gonna happen there
[39:05.300 --> 39:09.140]  might be a huge natural disaster and earthquake that's never happened in
[39:09.140 --> 39:14.220]  Stratford or something I don't know so you might need these on the other hand it
[39:14.220 --> 39:20.180]  just it reminded me of you know preparations for false flags so you
[39:20.180 --> 39:24.860]  know this is what G4S was like so after being there and doing the training I
[39:24.860 --> 39:30.180]  went to Andy Davis who's the Home Affairs Correspondent for Channel 4 News
[39:30.180 --> 39:35.180]  and I pitched him the story I emailed him he called me back we had a
[39:35.180 --> 39:40.340]  conversation he said look you know Channel 4 wouldn't be interested in this
[39:40.340 --> 39:43.500]  there's kind of a pressed blackout I'm doing anything negative about the
[39:43.500 --> 39:47.340]  Olympics we're not gonna be interested so thanks a lot and that was it that was
[39:47.340 --> 39:51.660]  the end of the call anyway I mentioned his name on the radio in that exact same
[39:51.660 --> 39:58.220]  context anyway last night Sunday night he rang me at home on my private home
[39:58.220 --> 40:04.300]  number and basically pretended that he had never spoken to me but I didn't know
[40:04.300 --> 40:10.020]  him and that I was just one big liar and this was a major lie and you know I'm
[40:10.020 --> 40:13.500]  in real trouble now and I to be honest you know I could have handled myself
[40:13.500 --> 40:17.940]  better on the call but I've got so angry at what that the audacity of this man
[40:17.940 --> 40:22.700]  anyway I can prove that our relationship goes back to 2010 I've got emails I
[40:22.700 --> 40:26.980]  called him for something he then he emailed me I emailed him back we've
[40:26.980 --> 40:33.340]  got correspondence both you know how does he figure that one out and so he
[40:33.340 --> 40:37.580]  knows who I really am which is why I've had to come out as Ben Fellows which is
[40:37.580 --> 40:43.980]  who I am and it's I'm actually worried now that he's gone to G4S to tell them
[40:43.980 --> 40:50.460]  who I am and you know and and so now I'm actually fearing for my safety so I
[40:50.460 --> 40:54.300]  thought look you know the best thing to do is come out tell everyone who you are
[40:54.300 --> 40:58.620]  why you did it and be the front I'd be the face of this thing open it because
[40:58.620 --> 41:02.500]  that's what it's all about really in the day I've got to leave G4S now that's it
[41:02.500 --> 41:06.500]  I'm done because I've been burned really or I don't know that I have so it's a
[41:06.500 --> 41:09.700]  possibility so in that way you can't ever go back in because you know I don't
[41:09.700 --> 41:14.700]  want to be on private property with G4S guys sure days after you came on Tony
[41:14.700 --> 41:19.860]  Gosling show and the day after you came on our broadcast there was a national TV
[41:19.860 --> 41:25.380]  report or several of them admitting oh security problems and confirming some of
[41:25.380 --> 41:30.380]  what you were saying do you think that was damage control yeah I think so
[41:30.380 --> 41:36.700]  really they had the the managing director of global events on and you know
[41:36.700 --> 41:40.500]  the hardest question that he the journalist asked but said well are you
[41:40.500 --> 41:43.900]  sure we're going to be ready and he said well I can't categorically say that
[41:43.900 --> 41:48.100]  we'll be ready well why not if the Olympics you've got to categorically say
[41:48.100 --> 41:52.580]  we're ready we're going to go at this date it starts you know so you know I
[41:52.580 --> 41:56.540]  think that was damaged control I don't think they wanted to to do that I spoke
[41:56.540 --> 42:01.420]  to a journalist this afternoon who's thinking about doing the story and you
[42:01.420 --> 42:05.860]  know he thought that it was the same sort of thing as well damage control and
[42:05.860 --> 42:08.940]  what have you we spoke a little bit about it so yeah I think it was quite
[42:08.940 --> 42:11.180]  honestly
[42:14.020 --> 42:21.540]  we're gonna have to continue to track this as it unfolds but what were you
[42:21.540 --> 42:26.780]  originally doing this for me what gave you the instinct or the idea to try to
[42:26.780 --> 42:33.780]  the inclination I should say to try to infiltrate this well several things
[42:33.780 --> 42:39.380]  really I've heard anecdotally of some horror stories with people who work for
[42:39.380 --> 42:43.340]  the cash delivery services and things like that you know keys go missing you
[42:43.340 --> 42:49.980]  know there's general mistakes I spoke to a mother of a soldier via someone else
[42:49.980 --> 42:57.220]  have to say it was second hand however she had said that her son had been in
[42:57.220 --> 43:00.940]  Iraq as a private soldier with G4 and come out of a bar and killed two of his
[43:00.940 --> 43:05.780]  colleagues and she was claiming or she said that he should never have been
[43:05.780 --> 43:10.420]  hired by G4S because after he worked for the British Army he had post-traumatic
[43:10.420 --> 43:17.300]  stress disorder and G4S it was irresponsible for G4S to hire him so I
[43:17.300 --> 43:21.300]  thought you know okay I'm not gonna sign up and go to war with these people I'll
[43:21.300 --> 43:25.260]  sign up and do something else now I was I was interested in doing the events
[43:25.260 --> 43:29.740]  team and being part of that because it's ad hoc you know I could be in the event
[43:29.740 --> 43:33.820]  team for a year you know it's odd weekends you know event or in the week
[43:33.820 --> 43:36.580]  and I can still do all my other things because sometimes you have to be in
[43:36.580 --> 43:40.820]  organizations for a year or more before you start really you know getting into
[43:40.820 --> 43:44.700]  things the Olympics has given me an opportunity you know it's been very
[43:44.700 --> 43:50.060]  intense and so I've seen G4S up close and personal as they've tried to get the
[43:50.060 --> 43:55.980]  10,400 you know people who are basically long-term and employed quickly through a
[43:55.980 --> 44:02.380]  training course okay so it is literally right out of Clockwork Orange yeah now
[44:02.380 --> 44:07.940]  expanding on that now that you're revealing your name who specifically or
[44:07.940 --> 44:13.420]  what was the date of them talking about some huge event is coming at the end of
[44:13.420 --> 44:20.300]  the Olympics that's right right okay so I'm in this training class and one of
[44:20.300 --> 44:26.300]  the trainers says that we are going to be involved in a I don't have my notes
[44:26.300 --> 44:29.620]  here with me so I'm not quoting you exactly but you know an historic event
[44:29.620 --> 44:32.540]  in London is going to happen and we're going to be involved actually it was a
[44:32.540 --> 44:37.260]  defining moment in the history of London thank you so that was what was
[44:37.260 --> 44:41.340]  said and then I said oh what do you mean that's like the Paralympics right
[44:41.340 --> 44:45.380]  because Paralympics Paralympics and then she went no no this is not to do with
[44:45.380 --> 44:48.140]  the Olympics this is something else but it would be a defining moment in the
[44:48.140 --> 44:50.460]  history of London and she wouldn't expand anything more she says but you know
[44:50.460 --> 44:54.620]  you would be involved so I took that two ways again as I usually do one version
[44:54.620 --> 44:58.220]  could be well okay we all work for G4S afterwards and we will have permanent
[44:58.220 --> 45:01.980]  jobs fantastic right that's the legacy that they're they're going to leave
[45:01.980 --> 45:05.340]  Stratford which would be a good thing you know you're employing the long-term
[45:05.340 --> 45:09.660]  and employed and all that kind of thing the other thing was oh my god what do
[45:09.660 --> 45:13.300]  they mean that we're going to be involved in in marshalling the general public
[45:13.300 --> 45:17.020]  you know dealing with the general public what disaster could make people leave
[45:17.020 --> 45:22.780]  London do you think that's just part of the training to see what you'd say or
[45:22.780 --> 45:26.900]  do or did you see any other signs that they may be actually planning to
[45:26.900 --> 45:33.820]  evacuate London well as far as what happened in the room this was they have
[45:33.820 --> 45:37.900]  800 people a day go through this school I don't know if this is the schools doing
[45:37.900 --> 45:41.700]  the same thing they may be maybe so they have 800 people a day go to this place
[45:41.700 --> 45:46.220]  what these trainers say is just written down for them they they're doing off a
[45:46.220 --> 45:50.140]  PowerPoint presentation and you know all the commentary they they do it's all
[45:50.140 --> 45:53.140]  exactly the same it's to the book you know they've got a script and they stick to it
[45:53.140 --> 45:59.660]  so what they say is what they say I've got a contact who is an army major in
[45:59.660 --> 46:06.300]  the British Army who is posted at Woolwich barracks and he told me that
[46:06.300 --> 46:09.460]  there was from January to Stephen Fix there's gonna be a hundred thousand
[46:09.460 --> 46:13.260]  troops coming into London through Woolwich barracks and the idea is they
[46:13.260 --> 46:17.300]  get helicoptered in by general helicopter they then they go into Woolwich
[46:17.300 --> 46:20.940]  barracks they have some sort of you know a medical or something like that which is
[46:20.940 --> 46:24.180]  why he knows about this and then they all get dispatched off to wherever they're
[46:24.180 --> 46:28.020]  going next you know it's like a gateway kind of and you were saying it was you
[46:28.020 --> 46:33.740]  in NATO foreign troops all right well we're gonna continue to watch this we
[46:33.740 --> 46:38.060]  appreciate you coming on the broadcast and hopefully down the road are you
[46:38.060 --> 46:41.900]  gonna be able to release any audio any video of anything that happened inside
[46:41.900 --> 46:48.340]  of the United Nations PR event at the Olympics or is this gonna be basically
[46:48.340 --> 46:55.100]  the end of this well you know I don't know who I am now so you know I'll
[46:55.100 --> 47:00.500]  certainly be releasing the conversation I've had with Andy Davis as for the
[47:00.500 --> 47:07.020]  training thing not really I'm gonna have to play by you I think and then see how
[47:07.020 --> 47:14.220]  it goes but what I don't want to do now is sort of upset people so much that I
[47:14.220 --> 47:19.620]  actually get physically harmed you know I'm actually a bit worried now well
[47:19.620 --> 47:23.100]  yes if what you're saying is completely accurate or what they told you is
[47:23.100 --> 47:28.940]  accurate then you are a key witness to something that is so big they may not be
[47:28.940 --> 47:33.700]  able to even reverse it despite the fact it's been exposed but we've gotten
[47:33.700 --> 47:38.900]  whistleblowers before other big events I hope that the people you were talking
[47:38.900 --> 47:43.860]  to were misinformed but I doubt that's the case thank you so much for the time
[47:43.860 --> 47:51.140]  there goes Ben Fellows whistleblower and a director TV producer out there in the
[47:51.140 --> 47:55.740]  United Kingdom working on that okay here's why I want to do now I want to go
[47:55.740 --> 47:59.980]  to your phone calls for this little part of the segment the next segment and then
[47:59.980 --> 48:03.580]  continue for a while with calls I really want to go to a lot of calls those two
[48:03.580 --> 48:06.460]  calls we took earlier were amazingly informed and brought up really good
[48:06.460 --> 48:10.500]  points everybody wants to talk about government-run health care where the
[48:10.500 --> 48:14.140]  government sets the type of care so the insurance companies make you buy their
[48:14.140 --> 48:19.540]  product but then they control what the product is a monopoly of service and
[48:19.540 --> 48:24.060]  where they then have the IRS come after you if you don't buy the private
[48:24.060 --> 48:31.900]  product a new level of corruption but I mean is it really they're now taking
[48:31.900 --> 48:35.260]  people's houses that the banks never had the mortgage to that were paid for in
[48:35.260 --> 48:39.460]  cash there they're not just reselling mortgages over and over again and then
[48:39.460 --> 48:43.140]  you haven't paid off your house and some bank you never knew I've came and said
[48:43.140 --> 48:47.340]  you we're taking your home even though you're not even behind I mean I mean
[48:47.340 --> 48:50.180]  they're taking houses where they're not even behind I was just thinking this
[48:50.180 --> 48:54.020]  morning about that again because I was reading some news articles about how
[48:54.020 --> 48:58.100]  they're admitting that with a different mirror system and different systems they
[48:58.100 --> 49:03.780]  use in banking and use with the mortgages that that that it's totally
[49:03.780 --> 49:07.420]  illegal but they don't care the courts aren't doing anything about it I mean
[49:07.420 --> 49:12.860]  I'm digressing off into that area it's just a wall of criminality and we're
[49:12.860 --> 49:18.020]  losing all our checks and balances and protection and it's not that I even
[49:18.020 --> 49:22.060]  dislike police themselves individually because I know there's real crime and
[49:22.060 --> 49:28.020]  real things going on but it's just the feeling of driving home at night and
[49:28.020 --> 49:33.220]  having police randomly get behind me twice and run my plates or whatever at
[49:33.220 --> 49:38.540]  10 o'clock at night driving down the highway and then speed off around me and
[49:38.540 --> 49:45.980]  just randomly pull over somebody else just out hunting just randomly meanwhile
[49:45.980 --> 49:49.860]  there's all this real crime going on I could drive to multiple spots in Austin
[49:49.860 --> 49:55.260]  Texas where I'm broadcasting from and show you crack dealers and crackhead
[49:55.260 --> 50:01.820]  prostitutes out on the street but then if I drive home at 7 8 9 10 at night I've
[50:01.820 --> 50:08.900]  got to have cops behind me and then so many police or listeners that almost
[50:08.900 --> 50:14.540]  every time I get pulled over they're like oh hi Alex like the show you can go I
[50:14.540 --> 50:21.460]  got pulled over with Dave Mustang and his wife at about midnight because I was
[50:21.460 --> 50:25.780]  taking over my house after a show he was staying with me not name dropping I'm
[50:25.780 --> 50:30.820]  just telling you a story and I guess I was one five miles over the speed limit
[50:30.820 --> 50:35.100]  he pulls me over comes over looks in goes all right Alex how you can go I'm
[50:35.100 --> 50:38.940]  just like Friday I'm going over my grandmother's and I shouldn't have
[50:38.940 --> 50:42.500]  probably done it but I mean I took a wrong turn so I drove over the meeting
[50:42.500 --> 50:50.300]  and down the grass over and then he pulls me over and he was a listener but
[50:50.300 --> 50:55.820]  I mean so I'm I'm trying to figure this out I guess it's just the job you just
[50:55.820 --> 51:01.140]  shark around getting on people's bumper running their place I don't know let me

[54:18.980 --> 54:28.980]  they did a bad bad thing made a lot of bad things but they turned over health
[54:28.980 --> 54:33.380]  care completely not just to a corrupt government but to the banks that own
[54:33.380 --> 54:37.340]  the big insurance companies and so they're calling this socialist health
[54:37.340 --> 54:40.820]  care and I guess it is for some of the people that get the death care the death
[54:40.820 --> 54:45.940]  panels the chicken feed watered down national health service stuff they get
[54:45.940 --> 54:51.700]  in England but for everybody else now the IRS is your doctor they get your
[54:51.700 --> 54:57.300]  medical records everything and I saw earlier this year Obama had his people
[54:57.300 --> 55:01.620]  announcing that they're gonna share your IRS records amongst agencies of course
[55:01.620 --> 55:05.620]  that's illegal that's why they want to make it law that they can so they can
[55:05.620 --> 55:10.860]  you know you use that for dirty tricks I mean it's just why not why not I mean
[55:10.860 --> 55:18.380]  they ship guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment why not why not kill
[55:18.380 --> 55:21.860]  us citizens why not get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution why not put
[55:21.860 --> 55:25.780]  breathalysers and face-scanning cameras in all the cars because that's what's
[55:25.780 --> 55:29.760]  next Toyota is talking about oh if you're not authorized it's all
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.100]  computerized it will recognize your face as a felon or a wanted person your
[55:34.100 --> 55:39.600]  phone turns off your car turns off you can't buy or sell that's what the
[55:39.600 --> 55:43.900]  government of the world is saying they want through the technocracy not the
[55:43.900 --> 55:48.100]  Bible people like I don't believe the Bible okay well you better believe what's
[55:48.100 --> 55:51.500]  happening in the real world and then the churches say well good that means I'll
[55:51.500 --> 55:58.460]  be raptured out soon you think you're gonna be raptured out where any of the
[55:58.460 --> 56:01.980]  Christians in the Bible raptured out doesn't even say that I know your
[56:01.980 --> 56:05.580]  preacher teaches you that and it's all these groups push it there's a reason
[56:05.580 --> 56:10.560]  they got big movies on television about how you're gonna be raptured because the
[56:10.560 --> 56:16.980]  Bible says you're raptured after after after Christ returns I mean a five-year-old
[56:16.980 --> 56:20.500]  could read that and tell that but the last hundred and fifty years the
[56:20.500 --> 56:23.420]  globalist preachers have taught you I mean I hear these church ladies all the
[56:23.420 --> 56:29.160]  time praise God they're trying to make us take the chip we're gonna be in
[56:29.160 --> 56:35.060]  heaven soon oh we're not gonna go through nothing oh really and then still
[56:35.060 --> 56:38.460]  more preachers on government payroll to the World Council of Churches and the
[56:38.460 --> 56:42.860]  rest of it Baptist Catholic you name it going we're slaves of the government I
[56:42.860 --> 56:46.340]  actually have clips of preachers on TV going to be a Christian is to be a
[56:46.340 --> 56:51.340]  slave the Christians would not bow down to the idols and would not do what they
[56:51.340 --> 56:57.140]  were told and the God was angry with them in Rome and that is the complete
[56:57.140 --> 57:03.540]  opposite of what actually happened in fact I sent that clip to last week to
[57:03.540 --> 57:10.140]  Rob and I got so busy we never played it on the nightly news but do is do the
[57:10.140 --> 57:14.620]  nightly news tonight I'm gonna do it tomorrow but tomorrow I'm gonna take
[57:14.620 --> 57:19.020]  some exercise clips out of these videos well on YouTube they're called clergy
[57:19.020 --> 57:24.100]  response teams have arrived or are here there's a bunch of videos of preachers
[57:24.100 --> 57:30.220]  on TV saying the Christians were bad because they did not worship the idols
[57:30.220 --> 57:35.860]  you're going excuse me it was of the Lord to do what the Roman government said
[57:35.860 --> 57:39.980]  and they should have and the Lord was angry with them we are slaves of the
[57:39.980 --> 57:50.260]  government I mean whoa I mean the entire Bible is about standing up against
[57:50.260 --> 57:55.860]  evil Daniel on the lion's den didn't worship like he was told putting the
[57:55.860 --> 58:03.100]  lion's den over and over again the fiery furnace because they wouldn't worship
[58:03.100 --> 58:06.540]  like they were told to do or they wouldn't pay a tax or they wouldn't and
[58:06.540 --> 58:10.140]  Jesus wouldn't do what he was told by the Pharisees they were the religious
[58:10.140 --> 58:15.980]  government and almost all the disciples were killed and John the Baptist they
[58:15.980 --> 58:20.940]  are of the devil the Jesus is the devil according to these modern preachers and
[58:20.940 --> 58:26.860]  the devil is Jesus and David Rockefeller is a loving man who wants to take good
[58:26.860 --> 58:30.460]  care of you and your family and again I'm not getting into Bible thumping here
[58:30.460 --> 58:34.140]  it's just that we claim we're a Christian nation no we're not we're a
[58:34.140 --> 58:39.780]  nation going straight to Hades and everybody knows it
[58:39.780 --> 58:49.220]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[1:00:25.340 --> 1:00:31.460]  the hour than a big news blitz and then best-selling author economist researcher

[1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:41.900]  renowned economic forecaster talk about what's happening in Europe what's

[1:00:56.820 --> 1:01:01.860]  you're on the air Dave hello Alex hey buddy hey thanks a lot for taking my
[1:01:01.860 --> 1:01:05.700]  call first-time caller long-time listener welcome sir hey I got a few
[1:01:05.700 --> 1:01:09.940]  comments quickly in two questions if I can sneak it all in sure so for waking
[1:01:09.940 --> 1:01:13.380]  people up a good litmus test that I found to do is see if people are sheeple
[1:01:13.380 --> 1:01:17.500]  or not as I asked them if the feds part of the government and about 95% of the
[1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:21.820]  time you know I hear oh yeah it's part of the government so then I then I tell
[1:01:21.820 --> 1:01:25.860]  them otherwise tell them about info wars and then my biggest thing is I tell
[1:01:25.860 --> 1:01:31.620]  them watch the Obama deception I've gotten more people to watch that and wake
[1:01:31.620 --> 1:01:36.820]  up and that's that's really good in the other thing like Gerald Salente I like
[1:01:36.820 --> 1:01:40.940]  his comment where he says if all the people in Washington you know we're in
[1:01:40.940 --> 1:01:44.340]  their own state that would probably help things out a lot politically but I
[1:01:44.340 --> 1:01:48.420]  don't think that's ever gonna happen but it's a good dream my two questions I
[1:01:48.420 --> 1:01:52.940]  got and one that I'd never really heard you talk about if everything were to you
[1:01:52.940 --> 1:01:57.420]  know collapse and hit the fan so to speak I mean how would the how would the
[1:01:57.420 --> 1:02:02.780]  rich and the elite survive I mean would they still need us to do things grow
[1:02:02.780 --> 1:02:08.660]  food you know run waste treatment plants sure sure no no no they plan to shut
[1:02:08.660 --> 1:02:15.020]  off the economy they will pull back to big armored high-tech redoubts while we
[1:02:15.020 --> 1:02:18.420]  live out here in a wasteland and kill each other off and they have drones
[1:02:18.420 --> 1:02:23.140]  flying over releasing different chemicals and biologicals on us actually
[1:02:23.140 --> 1:02:27.860]  there's an article that we read links yesterday at info wars.com by Suzanne
[1:02:27.860 --> 1:02:33.260]  Puzzle UN asked how many people could live on planet Earth it has links to the
[1:02:33.260 --> 1:02:41.700]  UN think tanks and it goes on to say fortress world by 2100 they always say
[1:02:41.700 --> 1:02:45.340]  further out than it actually is it's very closer than that a lot closer than
[1:02:45.340 --> 1:02:49.020]  that the global society will be controlled by an authoritarian government
[1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:52.820]  in order to control distribution of resources economic social and
[1:02:52.820 --> 1:02:56.740]  environmental downgrades would cause the wealth of your retreat to protected
[1:02:56.740 --> 1:03:01.300]  areas this is what they say in literally every publication that they talk about
[1:03:01.300 --> 1:03:05.700]  this in leaving the masses to fend for themselves in the wastelands implementing
[1:03:05.700 --> 1:03:10.340]  family planning services would be near impossible leaving the global population
[1:03:10.340 --> 1:03:14.420]  to rise to 10.2 billion it's set to plane off at about 8 billion the UN's own
[1:03:14.420 --> 1:03:17.860]  numbers are so they always put this out the average income would be reduced to
[1:03:17.860 --> 1:03:22.740]  two cents on the dollar and again but then they want a post-industrial world
[1:03:22.740 --> 1:03:29.420]  water securitization would control 46% of the world's water supplies global
[1:03:29.420 --> 1:03:33.780]  hunger could sort of nearly 15% of the entire population that's why they don't
[1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:36.620]  want you collecting your own water because they're going to securitize it
[1:03:36.620 --> 1:03:41.500]  like like housing markets and turn it into derivatives to jack up the price
[1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:47.460]  and then it goes on to talk about UN population family planning all the
[1:03:47.460 --> 1:03:51.460]  things they're going to do to people it is a hellish program that they have
[1:03:51.460 --> 1:03:56.220]  ready for us sir are you still on HF radio because I'm a ham operator and I
[1:03:56.220 --> 1:04:00.580]  used to listen to you but I can't find you where you're used to be at I know
[1:04:00.580 --> 1:04:05.860]  that WWCR changes frequencies from time to time if you tried going to WWCR and
[1:04:05.860 --> 1:04:10.180]  finding out where I'm on it no I haven't but I'm I'll have to do that but I'm
[1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:13.380]  definitely glad I got my ham license because everyone with their smartphone
[1:04:13.380 --> 1:04:17.980]  that can all be shut off and in fact I know I have a very good friend that works
[1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:23.100]  for Verizon and actually told me that they have special phones and they're
[1:04:23.100 --> 1:04:29.620]  actually phones that will only that the government has and they'll only work if
[1:04:29.620 --> 1:04:32.940]  you have one of them phones they do have the ability that to turn off the whole
[1:04:32.940 --> 1:04:37.660]  cell network of course they do and your and your smartphone is useless I mean
[1:04:37.660 --> 1:04:41.820]  I I don't even have one I have just a regular cell phone and everyone laughs
[1:04:41.820 --> 1:04:45.900]  at me about my ham radio stuff but as soon as the power goes out like we had
[1:04:45.900 --> 1:04:50.460]  that big power outage in 2003 in 20 minutes I was on the air with a
[1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:53.400]  generator and talking to a guy in Pennsylvania and he's telling me he's
[1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:58.260]  got no power well it wasn't well I know people know exactly it's bad to be

[1:06:07.020 --> 1:06:10.500]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:14.140]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and
[1:06:14.140 --> 1:06:17.980]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so

[1:10:51.100 --> 1:10:57.860]  keep the money for myself the goal is to build an organization to change history
[1:10:57.860 --> 1:11:05.140]  to actually affect the outcome for the better to be involved as a history's
[1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:09.660]  actor you know it was Carl Rove told the New York Times five years ago six years
[1:11:09.660 --> 1:11:13.260]  ago that oh the general public of the mainstream media you're not involved in
[1:11:13.260 --> 1:11:17.340]  history now you don't control your own destiny we in the government class tell
[1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:21.700]  you what the reality is even if it isn't true and then you go along with that we
[1:11:21.700 --> 1:11:28.500]  are history's actors now we control reality well yeah I guess Jim Jones
[1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:33.380]  controlled reality out of his jungle compound in Guiana and they all drank
[1:11:33.380 --> 1:11:37.860]  the Kool-Aid but I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid so you don't control my reality
[1:11:37.860 --> 1:11:41.420]  and I don't like what you're doing and you can say drones looking through our
[1:11:41.420 --> 1:11:45.380]  walls are constitutional or highway checkpoints are constitutional or face
[1:11:45.380 --> 1:11:50.180]  scanning cameras are constitutional or TSA trolling in our wives and children's
[1:11:50.180 --> 1:11:55.500]  pants is constitutional and robbing our bags and waving background checks and
[1:11:55.500 --> 1:11:59.220]  hiring criminals is constitutional you can say having open borders is
[1:11:59.220 --> 1:12:04.460]  constitutional you can say this new Asia Pacific group they're setting up that's
[1:12:04.460 --> 1:12:09.220]  a global union is constitutional it's not you can say the president coming out
[1:12:09.220 --> 1:12:14.340]  and saying the UN commands our military is constitutional it's not it's illegal
[1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:19.980]  and it's treason this is a designed global collapse by the mega banks who
[1:12:19.980 --> 1:12:24.980]  have announced themselves controllers of the planet JP Morgan Chase came out in
[1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:33.020]  Bloomberg last week 77% of their profit was government money okay I'm tired of
[1:12:33.020 --> 1:12:39.300]  it and you're not gonna hear on neocon radio about corporate welfare you're
[1:12:39.300 --> 1:12:43.220]  gonna hear about welfare moms and people who are dependent they have
[1:12:43.220 --> 1:12:47.540]  destroyed the economy the society paid to ship the jobs overseas so that there
[1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:51.860]  is this massive dependent people where they will get their police officers and
[1:12:51.860 --> 1:12:57.460]  their spies and their TSA and their enforcers so we are in trouble and the
[1:12:57.460 --> 1:13:02.420]  welfare class is deadly now a lot of them are handicapped or their troops
[1:13:02.420 --> 1:13:06.540]  that have been injured whatever but I'm talking about the people from childhood
[1:13:06.540 --> 1:13:10.620]  taught the government's gonna pay for your food it's gonna pay for your lunch
[1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:15.620]  it's gonna do all of this and by the way you're gonna be a SWAT team commander I
[1:13:15.620 --> 1:13:19.220]  mean that's or you're gonna be a CPS worker you're gonna go out and take
[1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:22.180]  people's kids you're gonna go out and shoot people's kids up at the school
[1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:27.740]  without even telling the parents that's now going on from Alabama to California
[1:13:27.740 --> 1:13:32.700]  this is a lawless government that lets foreign banks come in and take people's
[1:13:32.700 --> 1:13:35.620]  houses in fact guys we haven't played this in about a year can you guys look
[1:13:35.620 --> 1:13:40.900]  it up the headline was because every time I mention it people don't believe it
[1:13:40.900 --> 1:13:49.820]  Bank of America gets repossessed and it's a police in Florida where Bank of
[1:13:49.820 --> 1:13:53.900]  America took a 1.2 million dollar paid-in-cash home that they never owned
[1:13:53.900 --> 1:13:57.940]  that the people don't for a decade and they took it and the people over two
[1:13:57.940 --> 1:14:02.020]  years in court finally beat them and even the corrupt court said wait a minute
[1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:05.620]  it's not like you came and claimed you had a fake mortgage and took the house
[1:14:05.620 --> 1:14:10.060]  that even though they weren't you know behind that goes on or somebody was
[1:14:10.060 --> 1:14:13.860]  behind but it was all fraud so you don't have the deed you just came and took a
[1:14:13.860 --> 1:14:18.060]  house they said yeah it's ours so they send the police in to take the money out
[1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:21.860]  of the Bank of America till and then Bank of America finally gives them a check
[1:14:21.860 --> 1:14:26.380]  but the point is is that ladies and gentlemen people always say well that's
[1:14:26.380 --> 1:14:31.060]  not fair this is happening yeah because a bunch of crooks are gonna run you over
[1:14:31.060 --> 1:14:35.500]  if you don't demand your rights and fight for him you'll be a slave the reason
[1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:38.820]  this country that isn't perfect by the way has more freedom than the other
[1:14:38.820 --> 1:14:42.940]  nation the history of the world is because our ancestors for all the
[1:14:42.940 --> 1:14:48.060]  problems they had would kill you if you tried to enslave them our ancestors
[1:14:48.060 --> 1:14:51.980]  were mean I don't care what color you are where you came from this was a
[1:14:51.980 --> 1:14:56.140]  swashbuckling rough place and people didn't come here if they weren't rough
[1:14:56.140 --> 1:15:01.500]  okay and people weren't putting up with Jack Diddly squat and that's the only
[1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:05.580]  reason we've got any freedom you better thank the Second Amendment all you
[1:15:05.580 --> 1:15:08.540]  people that hate it out there because if we didn't have that the government would
[1:15:08.540 --> 1:15:13.020]  have already moved to take everything collectivize all farming let 50 million
[1:15:13.020 --> 1:15:17.060]  of a starve to death as they did in Russia and Ukraine and China this is
[1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:24.820]  their plan this is an exact program they're gonna follow okay so understand
[1:15:24.820 --> 1:15:29.180]  this is a life-and-death situation it doesn't get more real as you can now
[1:15:29.180 --> 1:15:33.140]  see the tanks are being delivered to every local police department the SWAT
[1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:36.980]  teams are being expanded the bullets the armored personnel carriers the mobile
[1:15:36.980 --> 1:15:46.260]  checkpoint pillboxes the arming to the teeth against us is on meanwhile they're
[1:15:46.260 --> 1:15:49.180]  taking people's houses all over the country if they fall behind on the
[1:15:49.180 --> 1:15:53.900]  income tax mainly old people who can't pay oh you went bankrupt oh you lost your
[1:15:53.900 --> 1:15:57.100]  job oh you're living in some little you know two-bedroom house with three kids
[1:15:57.100 --> 1:16:01.820]  we don't care we're taking your home because we say ten years ago or five
[1:16:01.820 --> 1:16:05.700]  years ago you didn't pay $500 in taxes now with penalties in interest it's
[1:16:05.700 --> 1:16:11.340]  $35 $40,000 we're taking it meanwhile the big banks are all exempt from it
[1:16:11.340 --> 1:16:15.780]  because they get paid the income tax they shut up in 1913 the year they
[1:16:15.780 --> 1:16:18.980]  established the fellow reserve the income tax it's in the communist
[1:16:18.980 --> 1:16:25.540]  manifesto it's paid to them and they want to bankrupt you they want they
[1:16:25.540 --> 1:16:29.140]  don't care if they write you so many tickets you go bankrupt they don't care
[1:16:29.140 --> 1:16:32.460]  if you can't pay it that's the plan in fact they want you to not be able to pay
[1:16:32.460 --> 1:16:37.300]  it that's the whole program is annihilate this country and it's going
[1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:45.140]  very very well very very well because they're in control of the bureaucracy
[1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:50.020]  it's not going well in public relations but they don't care about that they're
[1:16:50.020 --> 1:16:54.700]  there they're holding us down it's called being raped we're being raped

[1:18:00.980 --> 1:18:05.700]  Times last week and it is true in the past they had a jail inside the
[1:18:05.700 --> 1:18:11.300]  Congress and they could have somebody arrested they were in contempt just like

[1:18:22.380 --> 1:18:28.340]  Congress has become so emasculated so castrated that they let the United
[1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:32.620]  Nations march in and tell them that they have no power over war or taxes and
[1:18:32.620 --> 1:18:37.820]  now they've handed over taxes to the private banks through their health care
[1:18:37.820 --> 1:18:41.260]  they're gonna start expanding it into all sorts of other new things you've got
[1:18:41.260 --> 1:18:47.180]  to pay them so yes a house could arrest holder within parent contempt power but
[1:18:47.180 --> 1:18:51.220]  really the they could also go to the District Attorney of the District of
[1:18:51.220 --> 1:18:55.100]  Columbia but the problem is that's a holder minion the Justice Department has
[1:18:55.100 --> 1:18:58.900]  moved to shield him within the Justice Department for prosecution so I mean
[1:18:58.900 --> 1:19:03.660]  these are terrorists he shipped guns into Mexico along with his boss Obama and
[1:19:03.660 --> 1:19:08.180]  others to demonize the Second Amendment this is a stage terror attack that we've
[1:19:08.180 --> 1:19:12.860]  exposed and that's just the end of it they are terrorist and and I think you
[1:19:12.860 --> 1:19:16.340]  should take all the vaccines though because they care about you know another
[1:19:16.340 --> 1:19:23.140]  thing want to say brown I could do deep fun Obamacare today if he called the
[1:19:23.140 --> 1:19:27.420]  session they get the funded that'd be one step if they were right you're right
[1:19:27.420 --> 1:19:35.180]  but you're talking about boner or Boehner the name is German it's a nice
[1:19:35.180 --> 1:19:40.940]  name it's pronounced boner and his whole life even had a ad campaign saying
[1:19:40.940 --> 1:19:46.060]  it's Boehner not boner hey if your if your name is boner go with it and I'm
[1:19:46.060 --> 1:19:50.940]  not doing that for childlike jokes his name is boner that's the name of the
[1:19:50.940 --> 1:19:54.980]  speaker of the house boner but you don't see boner trying to defund it right
[1:19:54.980 --> 1:19:58.900]  now he says he will though so put pressure on boner we'll be right back

[1:24:12.980 --> 1:24:18.380]  criticize the utility companies as FEMA gets very angry with the utility
[1:24:18.380 --> 1:24:23.100]  companies that the power is not back on we wave our magic wand of government and
[1:24:23.100 --> 1:24:30.300]  say do you is good for troops we wave our magic wand and say pay Al Gore money
[1:24:30.300 --> 1:24:38.760]  and he make weather be nicer let's talk to Jim in New Mexico Jim you're on the
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:45.380]  air welcome hey Alex take my call I got one comment for you and then I have a
[1:24:45.380 --> 1:24:51.100]  question about the healthcare bill you know the criminals that are doing this
[1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:56.500]  we all know that they can't do it alone and how compartmentalized everything is
[1:24:56.500 --> 1:25:02.340]  and I will tell you that if you want to be privy to some info you get your
[1:25:02.340 --> 1:25:06.380]  people to talk to some of these interstate truck drivers that are moving
[1:25:06.380 --> 1:25:11.260]  the goods between California the American Southwest you can find out a
[1:25:11.260 --> 1:25:17.660]  lot of information you know they move everything in this country from our food
[1:25:17.660 --> 1:25:24.100]  to military contract goods and that's just a bit of information for you but
[1:25:24.100 --> 1:25:28.100]  my question is I've been reading this health care bill this weekend and maybe
[1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:33.820]  I am not educated enough to understand it off but especially some of these
[1:25:33.820 --> 1:25:38.980]  subheadings are very vague and I want to know what you can tell me and the
[1:25:38.980 --> 1:25:44.660]  listeners about these RFID chips in this health care bill and you know no no no
[1:25:44.660 --> 1:25:52.220]  it's simply saying that RFID chips in a baby's belly button when it's born or in
[1:25:52.220 --> 1:25:57.660]  new pills that are coming out that have RFID in them that goes through your body
[1:25:57.660 --> 1:26:03.180]  that it's going to be paid for medically so it just basically says
[1:26:03.180 --> 1:26:07.820]  government people are saying oh my gosh this means forced chipping well no but
[1:26:07.820 --> 1:26:12.100]  it leads to that because now it's saying that will be paid for and look that is a
[1:26:12.100 --> 1:26:16.500]  big part of technology there are a lot of RFID uses computer chip uses in the
[1:26:16.500 --> 1:26:20.380]  body where they're getting to where people that were blind can partially see
[1:26:20.380 --> 1:26:25.700]  the technology is neutral it's that they're always back-doring and piggy
[1:26:25.700 --> 1:26:31.900]  backing very draconian systems into it and so yes that is in the the
[1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:35.980]  legislation look the biggest problem is Tom Daschel wrote a book and admitted
[1:26:35.980 --> 1:26:40.060]  death panels and they've got technical names for them but it is these federal
[1:26:40.060 --> 1:26:44.300]  boards that will decide the care you get and we'll cut back on the amount of
[1:26:44.300 --> 1:26:50.620]  procedures test and everywhere they've had this in Canada in England they I mean
[1:26:50.620 --> 1:26:55.180]  it's in the news they don't deny that they don't give people surgeries that
[1:26:55.180 --> 1:26:59.620]  would save their lives and let them die and they say stuff like well you've
[1:26:59.620 --> 1:27:03.340]  paid it attacks is your whole life but you don't get the free health care that
[1:27:03.340 --> 1:27:09.380]  you paid for again another oxymoron because you smoked 20 years ago or oh
[1:27:09.380 --> 1:27:14.540]  you know you had you know a sports injury and that's elective that you
[1:27:14.540 --> 1:27:17.420]  played sports so we're not going to fix your knee I mean this is actually
[1:27:17.420 --> 1:27:21.940]  happening in England this is not my opinion they have top doctors coming
[1:27:21.940 --> 1:27:27.860]  out I mean just last week the headline was 130,000 old people killed killed I
[1:27:27.860 --> 1:27:30.540]  mean we're not talking about somebody in a coma that's under state care they
[1:27:30.540 --> 1:27:36.380]  unplug I'm talking about people see see folks don't know about how bad the
[1:27:36.380 --> 1:27:40.820]  evil's gotten I appreciate your call they don't understand folks that the
[1:27:40.820 --> 1:27:45.740]  Wall Street Journal a decade ago had a series of articles about people who
[1:27:45.740 --> 1:27:53.820]  were talking but in state care and who were belted down and dehydrated to death
[1:27:53.820 --> 1:27:56.780]  that's their favorite way to kill you because they say well we didn't give you
[1:27:56.780 --> 1:28:02.620]  anything to kill you so we just let you die and they claim legally it's okay and
[1:28:02.620 --> 1:28:06.620]  it takes like 14 days generally you start bleeding out your eyes and nose and
[1:28:06.620 --> 1:28:10.820]  mouth and the membranes all shrivel up down to core organs I mean it is hellish
[1:28:10.820 --> 1:28:14.460]  way to be killed and that's how they like to murder people I could open the
[1:28:14.460 --> 1:28:19.260]  phones up right now and have it filled with hospital workers and nursing home
[1:28:19.260 --> 1:28:24.220]  workers going there's a woman in bed a seven right now you want to go in there
[1:28:24.220 --> 1:28:29.620]  and you go in there and almost like that actually happened once I mean they're
[1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:32.260]  actually in there killing them and they're like oh no they're killing them
[1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:35.140]  right here right here at the hospital right now the average American listings
[1:28:35.140 --> 1:28:40.820]  like oh yeah right okay you'll find out Caleb in Texas you're on the air go
[1:28:40.820 --> 1:28:45.060]  ahead thank you for taking my call Mr. Jones I'm a first-time caller and a
[1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:50.060]  relatively new listener I've had a quick question kind of a got the broad
[1:28:50.060 --> 1:28:56.380]  overview of some of the things you say why you know I see a lot of your info
[1:28:56.380 --> 1:29:00.460]  warriors online posting different articles and links in those links to
[1:29:00.460 --> 1:29:05.820]  YouTube and why if there's a new world order why would that you know control
[1:29:05.820 --> 1:29:09.940]  the media and the corporations and big business why would they allow YouTube
[1:29:09.940 --> 1:29:16.060]  video but it would just be treated to delete them well there's such a problem
[1:29:16.060 --> 1:29:21.100]  with what you say because you say if there was a new world order I'm gonna
[1:29:21.100 --> 1:29:25.140]  put you on hold and come back to you and then I'm gonna get into the whole power
[1:29:25.140 --> 1:29:31.140]  out of situation but and what that illustrates about government but that's
[1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:36.900]  such an amazing statement the open world corporate government is now public I
[1:29:36.900 --> 1:29:40.980]  know the media said it didn't exist I'll ever getting it ready so they get the
[1:29:40.980 --> 1:29:46.060]  jump on you but it's now admitted they now admit they want to start censoring

[1:33:11.180 --> 1:33:16.460]  receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:33:21.380 --> 1:33:28.460]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide
[1:33:28.460 --> 1:33:32.260]  it's Alex Jones
[1:33:35.460 --> 1:33:40.780]  finish up with this caller go through a ton of news including the ongoing
[1:33:40.780 --> 1:33:50.180]  aftermath of the blackouts in many areas of the east into areas of the central
[1:33:50.180 --> 1:33:55.180]  eastern area the United States and the floundering that is taking place there
[1:33:55.180 --> 1:34:00.180]  but responding to the caller Caleb in Texas so I'm gonna go back to here in
[1:34:00.180 --> 1:34:03.900]  just a moment and I'm not trying to be condescending or mean to him because he
[1:34:03.900 --> 1:34:09.580]  asked the question politely and I shouldn't get irritated but this is what
[1:34:09.580 --> 1:34:14.380]  happens throughout history people say well where's the proof of the tyranny I
[1:34:14.380 --> 1:34:18.900]  mean if we had this incredible new world order you wouldn't be allowed to be on
[1:34:18.900 --> 1:34:26.300]  air or how are you able to put up YouTube videos if this new world order is so
[1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:31.420]  big and bad and powerful well Google has helped work with the Chinese
[1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:37.700]  government to censor their population Microsoft has done it even more and
[1:34:37.700 --> 1:34:40.620]  some of the other big technology companies so the point is they know how
[1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:44.820]  to do it and even congressional hearings have had to admit and the
[1:34:44.820 --> 1:34:51.900]  Electronic Frontier Foundation and even CNET and that CBS have all come out and
[1:34:51.900 --> 1:34:56.540]  said the cyber security legislation will end freedom as we know it allow the
[1:34:56.540 --> 1:35:03.100]  tracking and taxing of the web internet IDs the feds have been rating hundreds
[1:35:03.100 --> 1:35:07.500]  of thousands of website server domains and taking them without even court
[1:35:07.500 --> 1:35:12.620]  orders in some cases and turning them off even if you just have message boards
[1:35:12.620 --> 1:35:18.300]  on your site that link to where people might be able to find pirated music or
[1:35:18.300 --> 1:35:24.620]  movies or things like that so it even mainline universities don't deny that
[1:35:24.620 --> 1:35:29.980]  the entire Western world is accelerating into authoritarianism the ran
[1:35:29.980 --> 1:35:33.940]  corporation 20 years ago 18 years ago 15 years ago because I've read the
[1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:37.820]  reports on air you can look them up shed they would move into an authoritarian
[1:35:37.820 --> 1:35:43.540]  system you can see this everywhere it's kind of like I said the TSA will be at
[1:35:43.540 --> 1:35:47.420]  highway checkpoints now it's happening it's like Alex what's the big deal with
[1:35:47.420 --> 1:35:52.140]  a TSA checkpoint you know it's just illegal it's warrantless it's the feds
[1:35:52.140 --> 1:35:55.520]  out of their jurisdiction what you oh you said it was coming and it came
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:59.340]  fear monger you're right man that's shameful that you're right I'm like but
[1:35:59.340 --> 1:36:04.980]  I'm right how is I mean they announced in hundreds of publications just that video
[1:36:04.980 --> 1:36:11.140]  we played last week CNBC host admit that world government is run by bankers
[1:36:11.140 --> 1:36:14.660]  and were slaves to him but it was a paraphrase of the headline you can pull
[1:36:14.660 --> 1:36:18.980]  it up with that in fact guys we can't put that on screen I want to show people
[1:36:18.980 --> 1:36:23.980]  me a chance under it's like 40 articles just that the computer saw that were
[1:36:23.980 --> 1:36:30.060]  similar that we posted financial times you video clips of the head of the EU
[1:36:30.060 --> 1:36:34.500]  Herman von Roompi saying world government new world order run by banks a
[1:36:34.500 --> 1:36:42.100]  economist magazine and then you call up and say like the national media does I
[1:36:42.100 --> 1:36:46.020]  mean I had CBS news here just last week and they said so you believe there's a
[1:36:46.020 --> 1:36:48.940]  global government being formed I was like I don't believe anything it's it's
[1:36:48.940 --> 1:36:52.500]  public it's like when I had a nightline here I think you believe there's a world
[1:36:52.500 --> 1:36:55.700]  government you where did you imagine this and I'm like let me go show you a
[1:36:55.700 --> 1:37:00.260]  bunch of documents and you know parliament and Congress let me show you
[1:37:00.260 --> 1:37:03.420]  they're like no we don't need to look at that Alex we want to hear your opinion
[1:37:03.420 --> 1:37:11.460]  so they can say it's my opinion and so okay I mean if people become one of you
[1:37:11.460 --> 1:37:14.820]  called in and you said what's your proof that abortions are taking place in the
[1:37:14.820 --> 1:37:21.500]  US it's so well known there's been 50 plus million abortions since 1973 Roe v.
[1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:26.100]  Wade do I need you to prove to you there are abortions taking place or like
[1:37:26.100 --> 1:37:30.660]  Alex I heard you say there are McDonald's in the United States prove to me
[1:37:30.660 --> 1:37:35.380]  there are McDonald's and I'm just like I don't even know what to say to that you
[1:37:35.380 --> 1:37:39.180]  know I understand they said none of this existed so now that they've emerged
[1:37:39.180 --> 1:37:44.060]  with it it's kind of freaking folks out so any mental gymnastics that are needed
[1:37:44.060 --> 1:37:48.260]  to get you over that hump work but let me just give you two examples of
[1:37:48.260 --> 1:37:53.820]  censorship today in front of me one of them secret service shuts down fire
[1:37:53.820 --> 1:38:00.860]  Eric Holder protest folks I have been outside the White House with a national

[1:38:09.300 --> 1:38:12.820]  least that's the shot they want with the White House in the background and had
[1:38:12.820 --> 1:38:17.700]  police and security guards come over and say in America I can't even have a
[1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:21.940]  camera and threaten to arrest us over and over and over again I've been at the
[1:38:21.940 --> 1:38:27.140]  Washington Monument not even up by it on the steps but but down the green
[1:38:27.140 --> 1:38:32.060]  grass shooting video time-lapse that you see in films like fall the Republic

[1:38:55.660 --> 1:38:59.540]  have satisfaction when they tell you and it wasn't just me I saw I'm doing it to
[1:38:59.540 --> 1:39:03.060]  little families little families were walking around in front of the White
[1:39:03.060 --> 1:39:10.260]  House and they would come over just get in their face they'd have like secret
[1:39:10.260 --> 1:39:13.820]  service guys but in like a little t-shirt pants uniforms right up on a bike
[1:39:13.820 --> 1:39:18.060]  come on go can't do that can't film and they'd be like oh we're fair from
[1:39:18.060 --> 1:39:22.860]  Indiana can't do it turn it off turn it off and the cops would run over I mean
[1:39:22.860 --> 1:39:28.100]  this is what our kind it's like North Korea it's like North Korea side issue
[1:39:28.100 --> 1:39:35.580]  here it is Beltway confidential blog at the Washington Examiner US Secret
[1:39:35.580 --> 1:39:40.180]  Service officer shut down a student led protest calling for President Obama the
[1:39:40.180 --> 1:39:46.700]  fire attorney general Eric Holder this morning going to report from in front of
[1:39:46.700 --> 1:39:53.260]  the White House and it goes on ever discovering a suspicious package I know
[1:39:53.260 --> 1:39:57.860]  they always use that the Secret Service ended the protest see Putin just says
[1:39:57.860 --> 1:40:02.540]  hey I'm authority earning in and I don't like protests against me so I'll have
[1:40:02.540 --> 1:40:06.140]  you arrested because they won't issue the permit here it's always suspicious
[1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:10.580]  package yeah right several agents seemed hostile to our margin seemed anxious
[1:40:10.580 --> 1:40:14.060]  for us to leave the area Maurice Lewis University California student told campus
[1:40:14.060 --> 1:40:17.740]  reform the discovery of the end of it package came just as the protest began
[1:40:17.740 --> 1:40:21.980]  to gain traction oh yes again that's the National Security State the US House
[1:40:21.980 --> 1:40:25.780]  representative cited Holder for contempt of Congress on Thursday after he defined
[1:40:25.780 --> 1:40:30.100]  a subpoena demanding documents pertaining to operation fast and furious
[1:40:30.100 --> 1:40:34.180]  let me go forward when I was at and we have this on video we could go pull up
[1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:37.700]  the raw video I'm at the Supreme Court I'm like oh the Supreme Court's over
[1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:41.300]  there let's get some foul footage of that so we pull up and park in a
[1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:46.900]  designating parking space down the street walk up and I hadn't even crossed
[1:40:46.900 --> 1:40:53.380]  the street yet to try to get footage of the Supreme Court but it's really a
[1:40:53.380 --> 1:40:56.580]  small building so we wanted to be back across the street so we could get the
[1:40:56.580 --> 1:41:01.140]  whole thing and one of their federal officers and these were actually
[1:41:01.140 --> 1:41:06.300]  federal officers runs over and says you can't film the Supreme Court building
[1:41:06.300 --> 1:41:11.100]  and so I said okay well we're just gonna move along and then later I came back
[1:41:11.100 --> 1:41:14.060]  because we went up and shot some more video and then I went up to the steps and
[1:41:14.060 --> 1:41:17.900]  I got jumps out of the shadows now I was on it starts yelling at me but I tried
[1:41:17.900 --> 1:41:21.540]  like the Obi-Wan Kenobi angle I said wow well we're just doing this for our show
[1:41:21.540 --> 1:41:25.460]  in Austin and it sure would be neat I mean I knew it I knew he couldn't stop
[1:41:25.460 --> 1:41:28.740]  me from filming I knew it was public property I hadn't gone inside none of it
[1:41:28.740 --> 1:41:33.340]  but instead of doing that I just talked to him like he was a five-year-old and
[1:41:33.340 --> 1:41:38.140]  I went gee I'm from Austin I just really need oh and I just really would like to
[1:41:38.140 --> 1:41:43.300]  give footage can I just have one minute and I and I kind of bowed a little just
[1:41:43.300 --> 1:41:50.140]  literally I just you know he was like no yeah you can but just one minute I went
[1:41:50.140 --> 1:41:54.980]  okay guys get your footage just one minute
[1:41:54.980 --> 1:42:02.180]  so this is my country but it's like oh there's a new world order I mean how
[1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:04.700]  could you be on YouTube if they're you know we're set up with government
[1:42:04.700 --> 1:42:08.260]  funding because the government wanted to dominate the web and they want everyone
[1:42:08.260 --> 1:42:13.540]  on the platform first Google and this subsidiary YouTube in advertising
[1:42:13.540 --> 1:42:18.340]  telecommunications everything so they can control it and track everything you're
[1:42:18.340 --> 1:42:22.420]  doing because it's a it's a two-way I saw an article yesterday your Kindle is
[1:42:22.420 --> 1:42:26.140]  reading you it's reporting on what you're doing and tracking what you read
[1:42:26.140 --> 1:42:31.540]  all of this stuff does it it's designed to two-way I'll use a Lord of the Rings
[1:42:31.540 --> 1:42:36.460]  analogy you're looking into the crystal you know one of the Hobbits has got one
[1:42:36.460 --> 1:42:40.540]  of the crystal balls he's like oh I can see what's going on just it lands and
[1:42:40.540 --> 1:42:45.580]  Gandalf throws a hood over it goes it sees both ways you don't know who else is
[1:42:45.580 --> 1:42:52.620]  watching you understand that well that's a Google calls it a crystal ball
[1:42:52.620 --> 1:42:56.820]  back about 10 years ago I developed this term I don't know if it's a loopback or
[1:42:56.820 --> 1:43:01.020]  whatever but mines think the same thing but I said it's a crystal ball over the
[1:43:01.020 --> 1:43:05.940]  horizon predictor that was that was predicted by Isaac Asimov and his
[1:43:05.940 --> 1:43:11.620]  foundation series back in the 1940s genius they just come up with the laws of
[1:43:11.620 --> 1:43:15.660]  robot didn't develop the name didn't just develop the name robot Isaac see now
[1:43:15.660 --> 1:43:19.020]  I'm ranting son you asked me a question I can give you the answer it's about a
[1:43:19.020 --> 1:43:24.180]  50-year treatise on the nature of reality history integrated field systems of
[1:43:24.180 --> 1:43:28.820]  human development sociology anthropology psychology but when you're let me
[1:43:28.820 --> 1:43:31.540]  answer your questions quickly because I got to get the news we have a guest
[1:43:31.540 --> 1:43:34.780]  coming up and I want to get the calls let me just give you the long and short of
[1:43:34.780 --> 1:43:40.980]  it Google is running censorship models for other governments Google once
[1:43:40.980 --> 1:43:45.340]  everybody on board so at first it's free and open until they dominate now
[1:43:45.340 --> 1:43:48.700]  they're moving into the phase of censorship and we've had the Obama
[1:43:48.700 --> 1:43:53.900]  deception taken down we've had countless things blocked we've had footage we show
[1:43:53.900 --> 1:43:56.940]  that everybody else is allowed to show they take our channel down I have filed
[1:43:56.940 --> 1:44:01.380]  in federal court I don't make a big deal out of this it's got to be like ten
[1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:03.980]  times now
[1:44:04.900 --> 1:44:09.780]  swearing in federal court and things that because when they take you down for
[1:44:09.780 --> 1:44:13.940]  copyright you have to go file and you're swearing in that jurisdiction and I've
[1:44:13.940 --> 1:44:19.220]  had to have lawyers I've had to go through hell to stay on YouTube okay and
[1:44:19.220 --> 1:44:24.420]  then you call in here and go there's a new world order as if there isn't one
[1:44:24.420 --> 1:44:28.540]  being announced and as if our definition of the new world order isn't exactly what
[1:44:28.540 --> 1:44:34.820]  I said it was for 17 years because I read none dare call it conspiracy not
[1:44:34.820 --> 1:44:41.500]  because I discovered this written in 1971 before I was born Gary Allen whose son
[1:44:41.500 --> 1:44:44.820]  is it Politico working for the new world order now I tell you he's gonna be rolling
[1:44:44.820 --> 1:44:47.780]  over his grave I'm not I mean that really is hurtful Gary Allen and Larry
[1:44:47.780 --> 1:44:53.180]  Abraham they write this book explaining how the mega bankers control big
[1:44:53.180 --> 1:44:57.340]  government to shut down their competition and how the whole program would
[1:44:57.340 --> 1:45:00.820]  work and how they would set up a global government oven for the banksters that
[1:45:00.820 --> 1:45:05.940]  you pay your taxes to it's now here they now admit it on the news this book by
[1:45:05.940 --> 1:45:12.300]  the way is available at info wars.com right now or m4 shop.com but my point
[1:45:12.300 --> 1:45:19.420]  is that here is today or yesterday this is in the news Google shopping sensors
[1:45:19.420 --> 1:45:26.140]  all gun ammo accessories results we did Google shopping two years ago with the
[1:45:26.140 --> 1:45:32.060]  oh I just remember that's why I don't have an active Google account I still
[1:45:32.060 --> 1:45:37.460]  have it but posting to it was suspended two years ago when I had an Obama Joker
[1:45:37.460 --> 1:45:42.500]  poster and Google found it to be racist that I was selling shirts talking bad
[1:45:42.500 --> 1:45:49.220]  about the president and so my Google account was suspended I forgot and it
[1:45:49.220 --> 1:45:53.220]  was put to some hold function that's why I get emails from them but we can't use
[1:45:53.220 --> 1:45:57.820]  it that's why I forgot I forgot it's worse than just this article I just
[1:45:57.820 --> 1:46:04.020]  remembered we were kicked off Google shop I forgot because I was trying to
[1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:10.460]  operate in this monopoly and it is a monopoly more and more a do a oligopoly
[1:46:10.460 --> 1:46:15.860]  with other combines but more and more an internet monopoly bordering it's an
[1:46:15.860 --> 1:46:21.100]  oligopoly do oppoly bordering on monopoly that I have been censored by
[1:46:21.100 --> 1:46:26.780]  them bonafide over the Joker in fact we even did an article about that and here
[1:46:26.780 --> 1:46:32.300]  it is from firearms blog breaking it all down Google shopping sensors all gun
[1:46:32.300 --> 1:46:36.380]  ammo accessories results and the letter and the link and their new policy that's
[1:46:36.380 --> 1:46:41.980]  public saying no but you know scopes holsters nothing nothing and
[1:46:41.980 --> 1:46:45.340]  newspapers are saying you can't shell guns and I'm or even advertise your gun
[1:46:45.340 --> 1:46:54.260]  shop and then all of this and you call in you call in saying if there was this
[1:46:54.260 --> 1:46:58.380]  authoritarian system here's the final point sir they're not in full control
[1:46:58.380 --> 1:47:02.340]  yet as I've said about a hundred times in the last few months they're trying to
[1:47:02.340 --> 1:47:06.700]  get a global government they're trying to get a carbon tax they're trying to get
[1:47:06.700 --> 1:47:13.140]  forced inoculation in they're trying and we're battling them as hard as we can
[1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:17.940]  over every square inch of this and and we need you to wake up to what's
[1:47:17.940 --> 1:47:21.060]  happened and to pick an issue and to fight for it or we're gonna lose
[1:47:21.060 --> 1:47:28.180]  everything okay authoritarianism is spreading worldwide no real historians

[1:47:42.900 --> 1:47:48.220]  meeting that yes they are putting tech in all the new products to spy on us

[1:48:02.060 --> 1:48:06.900]  stop it the new world order is nine months pregnant and mama looks like a
[1:48:06.900 --> 1:48:11.340]  giant demonic piranha with hundreds of millions dead under her belt in the last
[1:48:11.340 --> 1:48:16.620]  century and her baby if it gets born is going to kill billions and she's
[1:48:16.620 --> 1:48:21.060]  squatting on us right now about to give birth to this monstrosity and I hope to
[1:48:21.060 --> 1:48:24.900]  God you'll wake up and realize that and do something about it they don't let you
[1:48:24.900 --> 1:48:28.620]  protest in DC now you can go get a permit if you jump through months of
[1:48:28.620 --> 1:48:33.460]  hoops and go get a little stage on a green field somewhere if they feel like
[1:48:33.460 --> 1:48:37.660]  it they're ordering armored personnel carriers everywhere checkpoints all of
[1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:42.940]  this and you're asking me you know well I mean it's such feeble stuff but I
[1:48:42.940 --> 1:48:46.540]  remember that's programming whether he's one of the operatives or been
[1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:51.900]  programmed by an operative program that's thing about programming it's a
[1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:56.620]  repeat is that they always say that it's like well if it's such a big new world
[1:48:56.620 --> 1:49:01.460]  order the daily caller as soon as I arrived at Builder but runs up and says

[1:49:05.380 --> 1:49:09.060]  well the British Empire was so powerful how are we able to defeat it because our
[1:49:09.060 --> 1:49:13.060]  forebears would walk through the snow when their shoes had worn off and then
[1:49:13.060 --> 1:49:16.180]  with the blood trails behind them because we because we used to be men
[1:49:16.180 --> 1:49:19.780]  because people understand that we're all flesh and blood that's why the elite
[1:49:19.780 --> 1:49:24.020]  want to build up this giant technocracy against us so that they can
[1:49:24.020 --> 1:49:29.300]  overwhelm society that's why they drug the water to make us more submissive this

[1:54:28.940 --> 1:54:34.300]  much of what you said is true and I'm just trying to figure out how big this
[1:54:34.300 --> 1:54:38.500]  thing really is I mean I see the monster on the hill it's coming towards me I
[1:54:38.500 --> 1:54:42.340]  was you know part of it for a little bit and I had to you know get away from it
[1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:47.100]  I'm just trying to figure out how big if there's any institution we can try no
[1:54:47.100 --> 1:54:51.700]  we can't trust religion can't trust banks the military that's a frickin joke you
[1:54:51.700 --> 1:54:55.540]  know the government you know don't waste your time is there anything we can
[1:54:55.540 --> 1:55:02.540]  trust I mean how well good people over time let bad people who want power and
[1:55:02.540 --> 1:55:06.180]  want to control others get into positions everywhere and create a new
[1:55:06.180 --> 1:55:11.340]  national spirit we're worshiping tyranny and worshiping government is the new
[1:55:11.340 --> 1:55:15.820]  patriotism and so all the curses that come with it are here and it's just
[1:55:15.820 --> 1:55:20.140]  gonna get worse we've just got to discredit the system and point out it's
[1:55:20.140 --> 1:55:24.260]  illegitimate and that our country's been occupied I mean the bankers get on TV
[1:55:24.260 --> 1:55:30.660]  and brag they've occupied us and the yuppies are too they're on too big of
[1:55:30.660 --> 1:55:35.340]  power trips themselves to admit they've been slaves so they play this mind game
[1:55:35.340 --> 1:55:40.580]  where they decide to join the system well you don't join with this this is
[1:55:40.580 --> 1:55:46.420]  evil turned loose but you know individuals that make up the system are
[1:55:46.420 --> 1:55:50.780]  all that is holding it back right now that's why they want total mindless
[1:55:50.780 --> 1:55:56.660]  compliance or zero tolerance it's why they make a store clerk at the grocery
[1:55:56.660 --> 1:56:01.500]  store and I've seen it 80 something year old men buying pipe tobacco old women
[1:56:01.500 --> 1:56:06.500]  buying a bottle of wine look like great-grandma's grandma and they got
[1:56:06.500 --> 1:56:11.860]  some is it faced 18 year old demanding to see their ID and an old woman's hand
[1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:16.260]  shaken giving it to her it's just about the store clerk isn't allowed to think
[1:56:16.260 --> 1:56:19.580]  for themselves the police aren't allowed to make a decision themselves
[1:56:19.580 --> 1:56:24.660]  everybody's got to do what they're programmed the system wants programming
[1:56:24.660 --> 1:56:30.460]  how do we beat programming we start being our own person that's how you deal
[1:56:30.460 --> 1:56:33.860]  with this that's how you that's how you defeat the new order that's why all of
[1:56:33.860 --> 1:56:36.860]  the country yeah I told people years ago because it was in the local paper
[1:56:36.860 --> 1:56:40.460]  people didn't believe it because they had one of the city councilmen go they
[1:56:40.460 --> 1:56:45.380]  could be growing marijuana and all these gardens coming up and they're getting
[1:56:45.380 --> 1:56:49.740]  chickens too that could be unsanitary we need to make people get licenses to
[1:56:49.740 --> 1:56:54.300]  have gardens to make sure they're not growing marijuana this from the
[1:56:54.300 --> 1:56:59.220]  government well where did they go with court code enforcement in the woman's
[1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:05.660]  old woman's backyard and cut down a few weeks ago she's suing them but and they
[1:57:05.660 --> 1:57:09.140]  said well we do this to everybody our code says whatever we feel is
[1:57:09.140 --> 1:57:12.620]  objectionable remember the woman with the garden up in Michigan they said we
[1:57:12.620 --> 1:57:16.420]  find it objectionable nice pretty little garden but this old woman had one in the
[1:57:16.420 --> 1:57:21.740]  backyard and not even the law there's no law against it they went in there cut
[1:57:21.740 --> 1:57:26.140]  it down and gave her a bill this is who these people are because we're
[1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:31.500]  prisoners to them we're prisoners and we've got it we're all guilty until
[1:57:31.500 --> 1:57:37.540]  proven slave and that's why last night I got to have cops run up behind me run my
[1:57:37.540 --> 1:57:42.300]  lice's plate and then run around me and I thought well maybe you know maybe
[1:57:42.300 --> 1:57:47.100]  they're looking for somebody in a truck I thought that for about 10 seconds till
[1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:49.780]  I saw him just speed up to the next person and pull them over they were
[1:57:49.780 --> 1:57:54.700]  just randomly pulling people over and that's not what America supposed to be
[1:57:54.700 --> 1:58:00.060]  about and I guess if I work late tonight I'm not going to but if I did work late
[1:58:00.060 --> 1:58:04.580]  tonight I just get to like go well I'm getting in my car now I get to go out

[2:02:03.660 --> 2:02:06.660]  know a lot people don't want to admit that even though it's it just proves
[2:02:06.660 --> 2:02:10.740]  everywhere because it's scary and no but they're already planning to release
[2:02:10.740 --> 2:02:14.260]  bio weapons anyway so we might as well fight them on our terms that don't mean
[2:02:14.260 --> 2:02:19.780]  start a fight because they want to start a fight so they can have a civil war we
[2:02:19.780 --> 2:02:23.300]  need to just totally in the info or while we still have somewhat of a free
[2:02:23.300 --> 2:02:29.100]  internet absolutely discredit these people so that they are so paralyzed with
[2:02:29.100 --> 2:02:34.140]  exposure they can't stage big events and then poses the saviors we're in a death

[2:02:38.700 --> 2:02:42.700]  almost punched myself in the face every day after the show that I wasn't hard
[2:02:42.700 --> 2:02:46.660]  core enough I wasn't focused enough I didn't have enough eloquence to really
[2:02:46.660 --> 2:02:51.260]  get it across to people that were two seconds to midnight that these are the
[2:02:51.260 --> 2:02:57.060]  most vicious murdering killers the United Nations on record is in Honduras
[2:02:57.060 --> 2:03:05.580]  and what's that Uganda and other countries lining up villagers in shooting
[2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:10.940]  and to take their property and the United Nations is on record kidnapping kids

[2:04:00.420 --> 2:04:04.940]  about 9-11 more that's the that's the only thing that I would offer you as
[2:04:04.940 --> 2:04:10.180]  constructive criticism and the only thing that I can see us breaking you
[2:04:10.180 --> 2:04:15.220]  know this this evil just pure evil is you know Martin Luther King and Gandhi
[2:04:15.220 --> 2:04:19.700]  we need non-violence there's a better way to live life now I agree with you you
[2:04:19.700 --> 2:04:24.660]  know clearly they blew up building seven the rest of it and I mean did you know
[2:04:24.660 --> 2:04:29.620]  I was the guy that day one said it was an inside job I did about a year ago my
[2:04:29.620 --> 2:04:33.300]  friend a good friend of mine sends you a lot of music and he's been he's been
[2:04:33.300 --> 2:04:35.740]  turning me no but I mean I just have people contact me going did you know
[2:04:35.740 --> 2:04:40.500]  9-11 was an inside job and I'm kind of like really didn't know that I I said
[2:04:40.500 --> 2:04:44.300]  it's six months before two months before I said they bought the World Trade
[2:04:44.300 --> 2:04:50.380]  Center before it happened and blaming on bin Laden everybody focuses on the
[2:04:50.380 --> 2:04:53.940]  control demolition I think that's important but we should I should make a
[2:04:53.940 --> 2:05:01.580]  new film on 9-11 because just just oh it's incredible let me ask you a

[2:06:02.780 --> 2:06:07.220]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[2:06:07.220 --> 2:06:11.220]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[2:06:11.220 --> 2:06:15.140]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[2:06:15.140 --> 2:06:19.180]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:06:19.180 --> 2:06:23.740]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:06:23.740 --> 2:06:28.380]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[2:06:28.380 --> 2:06:32.140]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[2:06:32.140 --> 2:06:35.580]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:06:35.580 --> 2:06:39.540]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:06:39.540 --> 2:06:42.700]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:06:42.700 --> 2:06:46.540]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can

[2:06:59.540 --> 2:07:05.180]  five hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[2:07:05.180 --> 2:07:09.860]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[2:07:09.860 --> 2:07:13.780]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[2:07:13.780 --> 2:07:17.660]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[2:07:17.660 --> 2:07:22.580]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:07:22.580 --> 2:07:27.860]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[2:07:27.860 --> 2:07:32.500]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[2:07:32.500 --> 2:07:36.700]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[2:07:36.700 --> 2:07:41.620]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[2:07:41.620 --> 2:07:46.340]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to

[2:08:00.460 --> 2:08:05.900]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[2:08:05.900 --> 2:08:18.580]  because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:18.580 --> 2:08:23.100]  all right in a moment we're gonna go to Harry S. Dent best-selling author
[2:08:23.100 --> 2:08:27.820]  economist friends forecaster has made a lot of very accurate predictions and
[2:08:27.820 --> 2:08:32.980]  breakdowns I'm gonna get his view on the unfolding meltdown that's taking place
[2:08:32.980 --> 2:08:38.460]  that CNBC says is setting up a global private government where where mega
[2:08:38.460 --> 2:08:43.020]  banks rule us gee I said that 17 years ago we need to dredge up all of those
[2:08:43.020 --> 2:08:47.220]  quotes because that's what this world government is that's what none dare call
[2:08:47.220 --> 2:08:53.380]  a conspiracy by Gary Allen covers back in print from 1971 available at info wars
[2:08:53.380 --> 2:08:58.340]  calm we're about to go to our guests but let me infomercial here for a moment
[2:08:58.340 --> 2:09:01.580]  because that's how we fund ourselves but most importantly I've done two hours of
[2:09:01.580 --> 2:09:05.820]  broadcast here so far really haven't plugged much we're gonna get Matthew
[2:09:05.820 --> 2:09:09.620]  Stein who's written when technology fails that we cover and carry an info
[2:09:09.620 --> 2:09:14.020]  or shop on the next few days and also author of when disaster strikes as well
[2:09:14.020 --> 2:09:18.300]  as Joel Scalzen who's warned about the power grid not being able to handle big
[2:09:18.300 --> 2:09:24.620]  storms much less some type of magnetic pulse or big or coronal mass ejection
[2:09:24.620 --> 2:09:29.780]  out of the sun all of these books deal with the fact that our industrial
[2:09:29.780 --> 2:09:35.940]  society is is is on a very precarious tightrope and we've seen this
[2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:44.260]  illustrated by within hours of what they call a hurricane on land huge storms in
[2:09:44.260 --> 2:09:48.860]  the Midwestern eastern area right to the eastern seaboard right through
[2:09:48.860 --> 2:09:53.700]  Virginia power off now for a couple days three million still without power
[2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:57.740]  part of DC dark actually some good in that maybe they won't be able to do as
[2:09:57.740 --> 2:10:03.980]  much mischief catastrophic damage to the power grids unscheduled leave for
[2:10:03.980 --> 2:10:11.180]  federal workers hell commute thousands of lights have stopped well maybe if
[2:10:11.180 --> 2:10:19.460]  government maybe if the government would spend less time buying armored
[2:10:19.460 --> 2:10:24.860]  personnel carriers even in small towns and drones and all the rest of it maybe
[2:10:24.860 --> 2:10:29.980]  then we could get the country going again but again this whole predatory
[2:10:29.980 --> 2:10:35.620]  monopolistic system wants a cratered society where only they have the high
[2:10:35.620 --> 2:10:40.220]  ground politically and militarily to consolidate control now that's my view on
[2:10:40.220 --> 2:10:44.420]  the situation joining us via video Skype is the best-selling author of the
[2:10:44.420 --> 2:10:50.420]  great crash ahead Harry S. Dent Jr. and he has an interesting bio I'm not going
[2:10:50.420 --> 2:10:54.780]  to go over the whole thing but he's the founder of H. S. Dent and economic
[2:10:54.780 --> 2:10:58.940]  research firm specializing in demographic trends his mission is helping
[2:10:58.940 --> 2:11:03.460]  people understand change using years of hands-on business experience in the late
[2:11:03.460 --> 2:11:07.220]  1980s Dent developed a new way of understanding the economy and forecasting
[2:11:07.220 --> 2:11:11.980]  what lies ahead based on consumers which he outlined in his book the great boom
[2:11:11.980 --> 2:11:17.660]  ahead in late 92 and that book he stood virtually alone and accurately
[2:11:17.660 --> 2:11:22.500]  forecasting the unanticipated boom of the 1990s and even called for the next
[2:11:22.500 --> 2:11:27.580]  great depression to start in oh a he sure did then has offered several best
[2:11:27.580 --> 2:11:31.740]  selling books including the Great Depression ahead in 2008 and he keeps
[2:11:31.740 --> 2:11:36.780]  his audience informed through his monthly newsletter the H. S. Dent forecast in his
[2:11:36.780 --> 2:11:41.420]  latest 2011 book the great crash ahead he outlines why government stimulus is
[2:11:41.420 --> 2:11:47.940]  doomed to failure and the economic havoc that lies ahead and he joins us he
[2:11:47.940 --> 2:11:52.300]  graduated from the University of South Carolina and earned his MBA from Harvard
[2:11:52.300 --> 2:11:58.460]  Business School where he was a Baker scholar okay we're gonna go to him now
[2:11:58.460 --> 2:12:01.780]  thank you for holding while I was ranting about what's happened with the
[2:12:01.780 --> 2:12:06.380]  storms and FEMA is angry at the power companies they say get it back on or
[2:12:06.380 --> 2:12:12.740]  you're in trouble but I mean FEMA is totally incompetent look at what
[2:12:12.740 --> 2:12:16.380]  happened with Katrina do you have any comments on the current state of things
[2:12:16.380 --> 2:12:22.300]  before we get into your larger world view of what's coming I mean there's
[2:12:22.300 --> 2:12:25.860]  cycles and everything there's cycles and like solar activity and stuff and that's
[2:12:25.860 --> 2:12:30.780]  tending to affect things on the grid now so I mean you know anything you can
[2:12:30.780 --> 2:12:34.220]  study in cycles and the most important thing is to understand what drives those
[2:12:34.220 --> 2:12:38.380]  cycles when do they come and go but more importantly and when the economy we
[2:12:38.380 --> 2:12:42.780]  look at demographic trends predictable things people do as they age drive
[2:12:42.780 --> 2:12:47.700]  almost all the key cycles over time our economy so anybody can understand it and
[2:12:47.700 --> 2:12:55.180]  economists really don't have a clue what tell us about yourself because I've
[2:12:55.180 --> 2:12:58.940]  you know read one of your books I've read the excerpts that you did indeed you
[2:12:58.940 --> 2:13:03.500]  know make in some cases decades before things did unfold how were you able to
[2:13:03.500 --> 2:13:10.300]  look off into the future and basically develop your system of research and
[2:13:10.300 --> 2:13:15.940]  forecasting well you know first Alex I wasn't trained as an economist I was a
[2:13:15.940 --> 2:13:18.860]  business consultant coming out of Harvard Business School working with Bain
[2:13:18.860 --> 2:13:23.540]  and Company consulting the Fortune 100 companies on strategic change how are
[2:13:23.540 --> 2:13:28.380]  their markets and industries changing where do they need to go and I did the
[2:13:28.380 --> 2:13:32.060]  same thing with new ventures on the more innovative side so I've seen the
[2:13:32.060 --> 2:13:36.980]  economy from a real-world point of view and out of that experience I developed
[2:13:36.980 --> 2:13:41.540]  some simple tools for predicting the macro economy not just one industry or
[2:13:41.540 --> 2:13:45.940]  one consumer product but what do people do in general as they age how do they
[2:13:45.940 --> 2:13:50.340]  create inflation how do they spend money how do they raise their families how do
[2:13:50.340 --> 2:13:54.380]  they invest money when do they retire all these things and when you look at
[2:13:54.380 --> 2:13:59.500]  that especially with new generations and especially a generation the size of the
[2:13:59.500 --> 2:14:04.340]  baby boom which is unprecedented in size of the generation the baby boom is
[2:14:04.340 --> 2:14:10.580]  driven a boom from 1983 to 2007 it's just a 46 year lag on the birth index for
[2:14:10.580 --> 2:14:14.220]  the peak and spending it's that simple and now they're going to be spending
[2:14:14.220 --> 2:14:19.900]  less paying down borrowing and buying less houses so the government stimulus
[2:14:19.900 --> 2:14:24.500]  doesn't have a chance of working and they're only racking up more debt after
[2:14:24.500 --> 2:14:29.140]  the greatest debt bubble in history but I look at the United Nations and
[2:14:29.140 --> 2:14:33.580]  Goldman Sachs and others they talk about a post-industrial nation and how they
[2:14:33.580 --> 2:14:37.820]  want to have less population but they know full well that a boom in
[2:14:37.820 --> 2:14:42.340]  population actually generally in history creates a boom in the economy over time
[2:14:42.340 --> 2:14:47.180]  now the baby boomers are getting ready to retire so right on time the banksters
[2:14:47.180 --> 2:14:51.220]  are making sure that everything implodes so whatever's paid back is paid back in
[2:14:51.220 --> 2:14:56.780]  inflated dollars what do you expect to see in the future you've accurately
[2:14:56.780 --> 2:15:01.780]  predicted these trends what's happening in Europe what's happening here a lot of
[2:15:01.780 --> 2:15:04.420]  metrics say we're already in a depression they claim we were out of a
[2:15:04.420 --> 2:15:09.980]  recession three years ago and that pigs fly what do you see coming in the
[2:15:09.980 --> 2:15:16.220]  future well first of all Japan proves this point that slowing population and
[2:15:16.220 --> 2:15:21.020]  aging is not good for the economy you need young people to innovate when they're
[2:15:21.020 --> 2:15:25.780]  young into the workforce raise families work hard earn money and they're the
[2:15:25.780 --> 2:15:31.420]  ones that support the older people anyway Japan baby boom peaked just before
[2:15:31.420 --> 2:15:35.860]  and right after World War two a decade or more ahead of Europe United States and
[2:15:35.860 --> 2:15:39.940]  guess what their economy started to tank they had their real estate bubble their
[2:15:39.940 --> 2:15:45.140]  stock bubble everything we've seen a decade or so ahead of us and now we're
[2:15:45.140 --> 2:15:48.900]  going into the same thing so Japan proved if you don't have more young people
[2:15:48.900 --> 2:15:54.020]  if people don't have kids and raise kids or if you don't encourage qualified
[2:15:54.020 --> 2:15:58.620]  immigrants it's hard to continue to grow because older people slow down and
[2:15:58.620 --> 2:16:04.660]  young people rev up so Japan is already in a long-term downturn all the
[2:16:04.660 --> 2:16:07.740]  stimulus in the world has not turned around their economy it's eased the
[2:16:07.740 --> 2:16:11.660]  pain but it has not turned around economy Europe is now the next southern
[2:16:11.660 --> 2:16:15.740]  Europe is the next fastest aging and then East Europe and Russia and then the
[2:16:15.740 --> 2:16:20.980]  US and ultimately even China is going to age faster than the US coming ahead and
[2:16:20.980 --> 2:16:26.060]  the in the world ahead is going to boom largely in the emerging countries from
[2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:31.060]  Southeast Asia and India around the world but but all developed countries as
[2:16:31.060 --> 2:16:37.020]  we've gotten richer and more urban we have less kids and then kids on a 46 year
[2:16:37.020 --> 2:16:40.620]  lag tell you where the economy is going and most economies are going sideways
[2:16:40.620 --> 2:16:46.820]  at best in America and down in places like southern Europe and Japan and here
[2:16:46.820 --> 2:16:50.380]  in the United States there are really I guess three different types of people
[2:16:50.380 --> 2:16:53.620]  there are folks that are willing to work three or four jobs live a middle-class
[2:16:53.620 --> 2:16:59.940]  life or did you know try to survive and not go on welfare there are you know
[2:16:59.940 --> 2:17:03.460]  kind of the nouveau riche types that want to sit around lazy and don't want to
[2:17:03.460 --> 2:17:09.860]  you know work and then I guess you've got kind of the whole bureaucratic class and
[2:17:09.860 --> 2:17:12.460]  I guess you got the welfare class too and there's more than three groups the
[2:17:12.460 --> 2:17:16.300]  point is there's less and less people that are willing to work and the
[2:17:16.300 --> 2:17:21.380]  government and the bureaucrats and the welfare people look at us with hate they
[2:17:21.380 --> 2:17:25.860]  talk bad about us all day they say we're trash we're filth there's never
[2:17:25.860 --> 2:17:31.100]  enough money we can pay them so what's going to happen is it all collapses and
[2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:35.860]  there's not enough of us to you know to pay for armored vehicles on every
[2:17:35.860 --> 2:17:39.220]  corner or drones to watch us because the government wants to keep their milk cows
[2:17:39.220 --> 2:17:44.140]  behaving well you know basically it takes crisis for people to get reality and
[2:17:44.140 --> 2:17:47.780]  we're not there yet we started in 2008 but the government bailed us out of all
[2:17:47.780 --> 2:17:54.060]  of that stimulated out we've had debt growing almost three times the rate of
[2:17:54.060 --> 2:17:58.700]  our economy since the early 1980s we've had constant government deficits since
[2:17:58.700 --> 2:18:04.180]  the early 1970s constant trade deficits we and most other countries in Europe
[2:18:04.180 --> 2:18:07.500]  especially southern Europe have been living off of debt not just our own
[2:18:07.500 --> 2:18:12.660]  natural work habits and increase and productivity and GDP we've been living
[2:18:12.660 --> 2:18:17.540]  off debt so this downturn will bring reality and people start to realize that
[2:18:17.540 --> 2:18:22.180]  the entitlement systems we have are not even remotely affordable decades in the
[2:18:22.180 --> 2:18:25.660]  future young people have no chance of getting the benefits that older people
[2:18:25.660 --> 2:18:31.140]  have gotten even older people will get less our support systems for people who
[2:18:31.140 --> 2:18:34.220]  don't work are gonna have to come into some question I mean you need some
[2:18:34.220 --> 2:18:38.380]  safety net but not an endless safety net so I think you're getting a big reality
[2:18:38.380 --> 2:18:42.940]  crisis in the next well I agree with you but I mean what about what about but I
[2:18:42.940 --> 2:18:47.020]  mean look the social engineers know this I mean they they put out one type of
[2:18:47.020 --> 2:18:51.540]  economic forecast for the for the slaves for the cattle as they see us but I mean
[2:18:51.540 --> 2:18:54.460]  they just said they're gonna euthanize all the old people that's how they're
[2:18:54.460 --> 2:19:00.940]  gonna pay for it I mean their answer is just to shrink the economy and instead
[2:19:00.940 --> 2:19:07.340]  of trying to build it up well I mean you know one real in health care is is
[2:19:07.340 --> 2:19:12.060]  anywhere between 33 and 50% of the cost or in the last year of life so we're
[2:19:12.060 --> 2:19:15.340]  gonna have to come to grips with that you can't publicly pay for that people
[2:19:15.340 --> 2:19:19.140]  privately can pay to extend their lives for six or 12 months but you can't pay
[2:19:19.140 --> 2:19:23.860]  hundreds of thousands of dollars so health care needs a major and I mean a
[2:19:23.860 --> 2:19:30.060]  major restructuring but yeah it doesn't mean euthanizing people and the truth
[2:19:30.060 --> 2:19:35.340]  is you just we have too much debt accumulated over decades we need to
[2:19:35.340 --> 2:19:41.020]  restructure private debt 42 trillion public debt of 16 trillion and rising in
[2:19:41.020 --> 2:19:43.940]  the US and then off the charts and parts of Europe and then we have these
[2:19:43.940 --> 2:19:49.380]  unfunded entitlements for social security and health care that are like 66 to 82
[2:19:49.380 --> 2:19:54.620]  trillion dollars by two different Harry Harry Dent amazing I want to come back
[2:19:54.620 --> 2:19:57.940]  and talk to you about what will the collapse look like we know we're in the
[2:19:57.940 --> 2:20:02.860]  beginnings of it now but how bad is it gonna get hi this is Alex Jones did you
[2:20:02.860 --> 2:20:06.340]  know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[2:20:06.340 --> 2:20:09.580]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[2:20:09.580 --> 2:20:13.540]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[2:20:13.540 --> 2:20:16.700]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[2:20:16.700 --> 2:20:20.620]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[2:20:20.620 --> 2:20:24.740]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[2:24:16.900 --> 2:24:20.500]  quote one terrorist so that and now they're oppressing Congress to allow
[2:24:20.500 --> 2:24:24.980]  more weaponized drones to other countries to start a drone race and they
[2:24:24.980 --> 2:24:29.940]  want 30,000 armed drones here in the US I mean what a joke taking our money
[2:24:29.940 --> 2:24:34.780]  military industrial complex feeding on us best-selling author Harry S. Dent
[2:24:34.780 --> 2:24:40.340]  joins us author of the great crash ahead and it is certainly beginning to
[2:24:40.340 --> 2:24:46.820]  unfold today look I see governments and their white papers and admissions
[2:24:46.820 --> 2:24:56.020]  getting in a very aggressive acclimation and and posture towards the
[2:24:56.020 --> 2:25:01.380]  populations standard unified program worldwide I see them going for more
[2:25:01.380 --> 2:25:05.900]  taxes which they know shut down economies what do you expect to happen
[2:25:05.900 --> 2:25:10.300]  from your you know very well researched and accurate predictions how will this
[2:25:10.300 --> 2:25:15.660]  collapse look how far along are we into it is there any way out of it then we're
[2:25:15.660 --> 2:25:18.220]  going to go to break I want to come back and find out what you would do
[2:25:18.220 --> 2:25:21.900]  individually go ahead well you know there is no easy way out of it they've
[2:25:21.900 --> 2:25:27.500]  been taking the easy way thus far you know QE 1 and QE 2 and operation twist
[2:25:27.500 --> 2:25:31.860]  and shout and all this sort of stuff this is just short-term stimulus to avoid
[2:25:31.860 --> 2:25:35.980]  dealing with the massive debt and bubbles that we created the government
[2:25:35.980 --> 2:25:39.740]  did a lot to help create those bubbles so did the private sector everybody did
[2:25:39.740 --> 2:25:44.540]  in a sense but you have to get out of the bubble to recover from this you have
[2:25:44.540 --> 2:25:48.340]  to restructure debt you have to let the economy slow down you'll have to let
[2:25:48.340 --> 2:25:53.220]  businesses get more efficient so it's a natural free market process that they
[2:25:53.220 --> 2:25:57.100]  are preventing by just keeping the economy stimuli they're keeping the
[2:25:57.100 --> 2:26:01.020]  bubble going the government puts money in the banking system the banks turn
[2:26:01.020 --> 2:26:04.540]  around and reinvest that money since they're not lending it to businesses and
[2:26:04.540 --> 2:26:08.740]  people into their the government bonds to keep their interest rates low so they
[2:26:08.740 --> 2:26:13.020]  can keep borrowing and running deficits it's not a sustainable situation it's
[2:26:13.020 --> 2:26:18.460]  very irresponsible we created the first crisis in 2008 in the U.S. with our
[2:26:18.460 --> 2:26:22.740]  subprime lending crisis that started to blow up Europe is now starting to blow
[2:26:22.740 --> 2:26:27.900]  up oh they just had this big breakthrough you know last Friday about oh
[2:26:27.900 --> 2:26:33.100]  we're gonna directly recapitalize banks from the ECB with free money and not
[2:26:33.100 --> 2:26:38.060]  put it on the governments that that won't even start to take a into account
[2:26:38.060 --> 2:26:43.300]  until late this year number one and number two the short-term debt pressures are rising
[2:26:43.300 --> 2:26:47.660]  they did this out of crisis they didn't do this out of normal agreement they did
[2:26:47.660 --> 2:26:51.020]  it out of a crisis is building I think Europe's getting ready to blow up and
[2:26:51.020 --> 2:26:56.540]  start to blow up like our subprime crisis did in late 2008 in the next two
[2:26:56.540 --> 2:27:00.420]  to four months so I think you're gonna see another at least many stock crash
[2:27:00.420 --> 2:27:04.260]  some problems in Europe is gonna spill off the United States and ultimately it
[2:27:04.260 --> 2:27:09.100]  hits China so you're gonna see this cascade of effects European crisis U.S.
[2:27:09.100 --> 2:27:13.620]  slows down we have a crisis our big crisis is still in real estate loans and
[2:27:13.620 --> 2:27:18.340]  banking loans foreclosures piled up to the moon that are gonna have to hit the
[2:27:18.340 --> 2:27:22.740]  market sooner or later and then China has the biggest overbuilding top-down
[2:27:22.740 --> 2:27:28.060]  government strategy for overstimulating an economy ever and they're going to
[2:27:28.060 --> 2:27:32.380]  bust as their exports are cratering so I think we have a world crisis developing
[2:27:32.380 --> 2:27:37.020]  over the next two two and a half years and it's gonna start this summer again
[2:27:37.020 --> 2:27:42.180]  and it's just gonna cascade you know late I think the most dangerous time for
[2:27:42.180 --> 2:27:46.780]  investors and businesses second half of this year and the second half of 2013
[2:27:46.780 --> 2:27:52.660]  and again mid to late 2014 before we shake out all this debt get down to
[2:27:52.660 --> 2:27:57.060]  reality about our entitlements and everything else and and and get to a
[2:27:57.060 --> 2:28:01.380]  position where we grow again you cannot grow with all this debt in our economy
[2:28:01.380 --> 2:28:04.620]  in Europe or in the United States or anywhere it's like trying to run again
[2:28:04.620 --> 2:28:08.580]  with a 300 pound weight on your back you have to deleverage the debt the free
[2:28:08.580 --> 2:28:13.620]  market systems did this rapidly in the early 1930s and after three years we came
[2:28:13.620 --> 2:28:18.340]  roaring out of the Great Depression Iceland already was forced to confront
[2:28:18.340 --> 2:28:21.980]  their debt and restructure it and now they're booming while the rest of Europe
[2:28:21.980 --> 2:28:26.300]  is sinking so it's better to let free market systems with some government
[2:28:26.300 --> 2:28:31.700]  system deal with this don't try to put it off government is just putting off the
[2:28:31.700 --> 2:28:36.020]  inevitable and making it worse by adding more debt to debt you can't solve a debt
[2:28:36.020 --> 2:28:41.660]  crisis with more debt it's that simple but look I mean you're a smart guy you're
[2:28:41.660 --> 2:28:45.740]  saying you're saying oh it's not gonna work well it's gonna work giving
[2:28:45.740 --> 2:28:48.940]  trillions and bailout money to the bankers and wrecking the rest of the
[2:28:48.940 --> 2:28:52.500]  economy so they're the last one standing I mean what about all their
[2:28:52.500 --> 2:28:54.980]  documents if you haven't seen them I can send them to you where they talk about a
[2:28:54.980 --> 2:28:59.940]  post-industrial world it's Goldman Sachs JP Morgan funding all this global
[2:28:59.940 --> 2:29:05.180]  government business I mean they plan on using this implosion as their takeover
[2:29:05.180 --> 2:29:11.140]  well yeah I mean the bubble gave banks more power and all this sort of stuff
[2:29:11.140 --> 2:29:14.100]  that's why they don't want the bubble you got the governments and the banks
[2:29:14.100 --> 2:29:18.500]  kind of colluding to keep this thing going the point is the more you stretch
[2:29:18.500 --> 2:29:22.100]  the system with all the stimulus the more vulnerable it gets and then you get
[2:29:22.100 --> 2:29:26.180]  a shock like Europe blowing up or foreclosures being dumped on the US
[2:29:26.180 --> 2:29:30.140]  market by banks because they just can't hold back any farther or China's
[2:29:30.140 --> 2:29:33.620]  unbelievable real estate bubble the greatest in the world by far most
[2:29:33.620 --> 2:29:37.580]  people aren't aware of this that starts to implode once things like that start
[2:29:37.580 --> 2:29:41.820]  to implode the system can't handle the shock okay stay there long long segment
[2:29:41.820 --> 2:29:46.060]  coming up Harry S. Dent Jr amazing gas is gonna be right back with him he's been
[2:29:46.060 --> 2:29:49.380]  very accurate and predicting what's coming up we're gonna ask you more on
[2:29:49.380 --> 2:29:55.340]  the other side we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[2:29:55.340 --> 2:29:58.820]  GCN radio network

[2:33:16.980 --> 2:33:31.420]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance as our society careens
[2:33:31.420 --> 2:33:37.140]  towards the edge California bill would allow child to have more than two
[2:33:37.140 --> 2:33:43.620]  parents and Anderson Cooper told us something we didn't know that he's gay
[2:33:43.620 --> 2:33:50.300]  really Anderson Cooper we couldn't tell you know my whole issue is I'm just
[2:33:50.300 --> 2:33:53.940]  sick of hearing about it I don't care try to turn it on the television every
[2:33:53.940 --> 2:33:57.540]  time I turn on CNN it's Anderson Cooper talking about gay people I mean it's
[2:33:57.540 --> 2:34:05.180]  just like is there anything else in the universe other than this I mean there is
[2:34:05.180 --> 2:34:10.940]  so many amazing things happening so many incredible things happening and also
[2:34:10.940 --> 2:34:15.220]  so many bad things happening and you tune into these TV shows and the culture
[2:34:15.220 --> 2:34:21.380]  and it's so dumb down and I think about our ancestors not even our ancestors a
[2:34:21.380 --> 2:34:24.380]  lot of these folks are still alive like my grandmother almost 90 years old
[2:34:24.380 --> 2:34:31.020]  during the Great Depression upwards of 85 to 89% depending on which university
[2:34:31.020 --> 2:34:35.780]  study lived in rural areas and most of them were somewhat self-sufficient now
[2:34:35.780 --> 2:34:42.700]  we're right at 90% urban or quasi urban and half of the 10% that are living in
[2:34:42.700 --> 2:34:48.300]  the farming areas are self-sufficient look at what's happened with just these
[2:34:48.300 --> 2:34:53.900]  big summer storms ripping through the east coast and areas of the power out and
[2:34:53.900 --> 2:35:00.620]  all the rest of it imagine if we have a Great Depression like event you know
[2:35:00.620 --> 2:35:05.580]  that's that bad we already have almost 50 million people on food stamps those
[2:35:05.580 --> 2:35:13.700]  are high-tech soup lines imagine what it's going to be like because I'm not
[2:35:13.700 --> 2:35:16.620]  nostalgic for the past but I've looked at some of the sociology the
[2:35:16.620 --> 2:35:20.580]  anthropology the history people were a lot more moral in the 20s and 30s and
[2:35:20.580 --> 2:35:25.540]  they were more self-sufficient so I want to ask Harry S Dent best-selling
[2:35:25.540 --> 2:35:31.460]  author of The Great Crash Ahead and he is a very well-known trends forecaster
[2:35:31.460 --> 2:35:35.140]  and heads up his own organization best-selling author renowned economic
[2:35:35.140 --> 2:35:39.980]  forecaster Harry S Dent Jr. has observed economic trends for decades and accurately
[2:35:39.980 --> 2:35:46.020]  predicted many of them and he's on with us I mean you just heard my little my
[2:35:46.020 --> 2:35:51.420]  little breakdown there I mean and I see governments all over the world not just
[2:35:51.420 --> 2:35:57.460]  here digging in the Chinese communists are buying huge gatling guns on the
[2:35:57.460 --> 2:36:01.460]  backs of armored vehicles for their public same things happening here I
[2:36:01.460 --> 2:36:04.420]  talked to police and military I don't have the phones up right now but it's
[2:36:04.420 --> 2:36:08.980]  even in the news where they're gearing up from unprecedented civil unrest I don't
[2:36:08.980 --> 2:36:16.940]  see a way out of this once the what are the numbers on how fast this could move
[2:36:16.940 --> 2:36:21.540]  because you were implying that you it could happen in big fits and starts it
[2:36:21.540 --> 2:36:26.500]  could be gradual there could be trigger events I mean in your gut here how do
[2:36:26.500 --> 2:36:30.500]  you see this going how do you see this shaking out because I was reading a UN
[2:36:30.500 --> 2:36:35.140]  report yesterday where they talk about total collapse of society and a
[2:36:35.140 --> 2:36:42.860]  fortress world where the elites retreat behind protected areas leaving the masses
[2:36:42.860 --> 2:36:48.580]  defend for themselves in the wastelands that is a quote out of the UN report
[2:36:48.580 --> 2:36:52.420]  what do you make of that well you know I don't study that to that degree but I do
[2:36:52.420 --> 2:36:57.860]  know that every crisis in history tends to have a first phase where something
[2:36:57.860 --> 2:37:03.420]  goes wrong and then people actually go into denial it's a human quality where
[2:37:03.420 --> 2:37:06.820]  something you can't take you just deny it and the governments are in denial now
[2:37:06.820 --> 2:37:11.060]  they're trying to keep this bubble going it's in the second stage that you get
[2:37:11.060 --> 2:37:15.020]  the real impacts we won't know how bad this crisis is going to be until the
[2:37:15.020 --> 2:37:19.340]  stimulus in the first stage of denial ends and I think that's going to happen
[2:37:19.340 --> 2:37:23.580]  between late 2012 and late 2014 maybe a little later I think it's going to happen
[2:37:23.580 --> 2:37:26.820]  the next few years and it's certainly going to be deeper than the first crisis
[2:37:26.820 --> 2:37:30.580]  there's certainly going to be more economic downturn more banks failing
[2:37:30.580 --> 2:37:33.980]  more businesses failing higher unemployment that's what has stopped and
[2:37:33.980 --> 2:37:38.860]  there's going to be more civil unrest I don't know how much it depends on how it
[2:37:38.860 --> 2:37:43.020]  shakes out but you do have to be expecting worse than less there's no
[2:37:43.020 --> 2:37:47.460]  way that the second crisis is not going to be worse than the first because we've
[2:37:47.460 --> 2:37:51.500]  basically kicked the can down the road and made it worse by adding more debt
[2:37:51.500 --> 2:37:56.100]  and stretching our system with all this stimulus and all these things the banks
[2:37:56.100 --> 2:37:59.740]  have been doing so I think people are better to be on the safe side say look
[2:37:59.740 --> 2:38:04.020]  I got to protect my investments I got to be as safe as possible I'd rather live
[2:38:04.020 --> 2:38:09.500]  farther from downtown areas than closer in safer communities than I'd rather live
[2:38:09.500 --> 2:38:14.540]  more inland than on the coast all these sort of things it's really hard to tell
[2:38:14.540 --> 2:38:18.300]  that the reason it's hard to tell exactly because we haven't had a crisis like
[2:38:18.300 --> 2:38:22.620]  this before we've never seen a totally global crisis including emerging
[2:38:22.620 --> 2:38:27.100]  countries in China we've never seen governments with the stimulus tools they
[2:38:27.100 --> 2:38:30.940]  didn't have this in the Great Depression they didn't do all this QE and stuff
[2:38:30.940 --> 2:38:34.860]  the first time we really did this was in Japan in the 90s and now in US and
[2:38:34.860 --> 2:38:40.340]  Europe so we've never seen a situation to me this stimulus is like taking more
[2:38:40.340 --> 2:38:45.060]  and more of a drug until you basically pass out you're just you don't want to
[2:38:45.060 --> 2:38:48.260]  come down from the bubble see take more the drug but it takes more and more the
[2:38:48.260 --> 2:38:52.900]  drug to end with less and less impact until you die from the drug so I think
[2:38:52.900 --> 2:38:56.900]  there's a big range of how bad it can be but I can tell you one thing the next
[2:38:56.900 --> 2:39:01.540]  two to three years is very likely to be a lot worse in everything from economics
[2:39:01.540 --> 2:39:08.900]  and unemployment investments and civil unrest than we saw in 2008 2009 and by
[2:39:08.900 --> 2:39:13.260]  the way all the big government reports UN reports we've sourced them read them
[2:39:13.260 --> 2:39:17.700]  here they all agree with what you've just said but then separately the mainstream
[2:39:17.700 --> 2:39:23.180]  media calls it pessimism porn attacks myself Gerald Salente you know people
[2:39:23.180 --> 2:39:28.820]  like you occasionally Ron Paul others who say that this is unsustainable but
[2:39:28.820 --> 2:39:33.140]  oh then they come out separately but say though there is a global meltdown but
[2:39:33.140 --> 2:39:37.340]  global government run by the megabanks is the answer I want to play a clip from
[2:39:37.340 --> 2:39:42.060]  two weeks ago on the Cutlow report on CNBC I'm gonna play the whole clip but
[2:39:42.060 --> 2:39:46.740]  they basically say we're ruled by megabanks global governance but you know
[2:39:46.740 --> 2:39:51.180]  what that's the way it is so they've gone from denying all this throwing it in
[2:39:51.180 --> 2:39:57.300]  our face I'm gonna get your take on it here's a clip and then we'll come back
[2:39:57.300 --> 2:40:03.140]  to you mostly what they do is hold summits I think that right now the
[2:40:03.140 --> 2:40:07.020]  question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I want to address
[2:40:07.020 --> 2:40:12.020]  to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it one world the
[2:40:12.020 --> 2:40:16.980]  central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've got some downside here a
[2:40:16.980 --> 2:40:21.460]  correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just living and dying for
[2:40:21.460 --> 2:40:25.060]  what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's
[2:40:25.060 --> 2:40:30.500]  a Bernanke putt putt and that we won't go any lower than say five percent down
[2:40:30.500 --> 2:40:35.260]  from here of course we are because if we look at the economic and they all go
[2:40:35.260 --> 2:40:38.100]  on and agree we're slaves the bankers but thank god they've got global
[2:40:38.100 --> 2:40:43.420]  government to save us one guy's a little critical the Federal Reserve I mean
[2:40:43.420 --> 2:40:48.180]  Harry I know you've probably seen the media attack folks like myself who talk
[2:40:48.180 --> 2:40:53.300]  about this being an engineered crisis and then predicting it more than a
[2:40:53.300 --> 2:40:58.460]  decade ago but regardless of whether it's engineered or not it is going
[2:40:58.460 --> 2:41:02.220]  towards global government it is globalism that helped this become a global
[2:41:02.220 --> 2:41:07.260]  problem what's your take on that overall statement well I mean we've grown
[2:41:07.260 --> 2:41:11.780]  forever over centuries from smaller communities into states and nation
[2:41:11.780 --> 2:41:16.860]  states and nations and then now globalism but but you know you have to go in
[2:41:16.860 --> 2:41:20.140]  fits and starts and you have to learn I mean we had this global boom and
[2:41:20.140 --> 2:41:25.260]  unfortunately there it kind of got out of control with so much cross-lending and
[2:41:25.260 --> 2:41:28.940]  governments and businesses and banks around the world and so much
[2:41:28.940 --> 2:41:32.620]  interdependence that now we're very vulnerable because simply because it was
[2:41:32.620 --> 2:41:39.540]  overdone there's nobody to regulate foreign commerce in the way we do domestic
[2:41:39.540 --> 2:41:42.540]  I mean you do need to have some restrictions on how much debt can be
[2:41:42.540 --> 2:41:47.580]  created and what people and businesses can do or things get out of control and
[2:41:47.580 --> 2:41:51.500]  then you have big burst we've had these depressions and debt bubbles and asset
[2:41:51.500 --> 2:41:56.300]  bubbles throughout history and they never end well whenever an economy grows
[2:41:56.300 --> 2:42:01.260]  a lot faster I mean debt grows a lot faster in the economy you're stressing
[2:42:01.260 --> 2:42:04.380]  yourself beyond your means and you're going to have to have a correction and
[2:42:04.380 --> 2:42:08.980]  get back in the balance that is human nature whether any part of the world
[2:42:08.980 --> 2:42:12.980]  this has happened over and over again so we've just done this globally now and we
[2:42:12.980 --> 2:42:17.700]  actually need to have a global slowdown we need to restructure a lot of things
[2:42:17.700 --> 2:42:20.180]  and we're going to need to have some better global agreements you can't get
[2:42:20.180 --> 2:42:23.900]  away from the fact that we're in a global world but you can't have some
[2:42:23.900 --> 2:42:29.580]  bureaucratic giant thing that tries to control this these banks and central
[2:42:29.580 --> 2:42:33.260]  banks have tried to keep this thing going since the early 70s when the
[2:42:33.260 --> 2:42:37.220]  economy started to melt down after the last and they've been picking winners
[2:42:37.220 --> 2:42:42.020]  and losers which is inherent monopolistic garbage and and I agree
[2:42:42.020 --> 2:42:45.860]  with the statement you just made and correct me if I'm wrong because I'm
[2:42:45.860 --> 2:42:49.980]  interpreting what you said here but there is this global combine but they
[2:42:49.980 --> 2:42:55.860]  got so greedy with the derivatives and things and selling you know package
[2:42:55.860 --> 2:43:01.380]  mortgages ten times over that that now they're endangering their own system I
[2:43:01.380 --> 2:43:07.060]  think this this global corporate is takeover that in their zest to fund it
[2:43:07.060 --> 2:43:10.940]  all they've probably destroyed themselves because I don't think the world's
[2:43:10.940 --> 2:43:16.620]  going to go along with the very bankers that engineered so much of where we are
[2:43:16.620 --> 2:43:23.100]  today now posing as the saviors I mean what do you make of what I just said
[2:43:23.100 --> 2:43:27.900]  A and then B what do you make of that clip I just played we I mainly think
[2:43:27.900 --> 2:43:32.100]  once a system gets going we had this bubble developing again to me
[2:43:32.100 --> 2:43:36.380]  everybody did it even a lot of us consumers borrowed money against our
[2:43:36.380 --> 2:43:40.500]  homes that were rising in value to get our kids in private school we bought
[2:43:40.500 --> 2:43:45.220]  homes we couldn't afford we speculated in homes we speculated in tech stocks the
[2:43:45.220 --> 2:43:49.300]  rating agencies turned a blind eye when all these debt leveraging and new
[2:43:49.300 --> 2:43:54.940]  things were happening government we took debate everybody did it we took the
[2:43:54.940 --> 2:44:00.860]  bait though once a bubble gets going nobody wants it to stop especially the
[2:44:00.860 --> 2:44:05.580]  people most in control which are the governments and the financial institutions
[2:44:05.580 --> 2:44:09.580]  they benefited the most especially financial institutions and then I agree
[2:44:09.580 --> 2:44:13.540]  with it in the sense that the very if you created this bubble and you benefited
[2:44:13.540 --> 2:44:17.660]  the most you're going to be the ones to get hurt the most when it goes down
[2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:23.300]  that's why they're trying so hard if we let this bubble deflate home prices
[2:44:23.300 --> 2:44:26.140]  going to become affordable the young people again debt's going to be
[2:44:26.140 --> 2:44:29.620]  restructured down health care costs are going to stop going up at the speed of
[2:44:29.620 --> 2:44:33.260]  life there's going to be a lot of great long-term benefits the problem is the
[2:44:33.260 --> 2:44:36.980]  people who created this bubble and benefited are going to lose the most so
[2:44:36.980 --> 2:44:40.700]  they're going to try to stop it from happening against the broader interests
[2:44:40.700 --> 2:44:45.500]  of people that's why to me I'm like bring on the crisis we will not get clear
[2:44:45.500 --> 2:44:49.660]  until we get a crisis in fact even the European leaders they can't agree on
[2:44:49.660 --> 2:44:53.580]  anything but it's gotten so bad in Europe in the last few weeks that they're
[2:44:53.580 --> 2:44:57.140]  suddenly agreeing on things that they wouldn't agree on it's not a sign of
[2:44:57.140 --> 2:45:01.140]  strength it's a sign that they're falling into a deeper crisis and they have no
[2:45:01.140 --> 2:45:04.900]  choice but to get real and do the right thing we need to get real here we are
[2:45:04.900 --> 2:45:08.540]  way out of kilter on all types of stuff and we're not going to be able to grow
[2:45:08.540 --> 2:45:14.660]  again until we restructure our entire systems and get rid of all this debt and
[2:45:14.660 --> 2:45:18.700]  start again anew and then this happens once in a lifetime it happened in the
[2:45:18.700 --> 2:45:23.340]  1930s and we had unbelievable boom after that especially in the United States
[2:45:23.340 --> 2:45:27.300]  it's going to happen again but we got but we're not the kind of people we were
[2:45:27.300 --> 2:45:31.980]  in the 30s I mean I'm sorry but I live in a very nice city one of the best in
[2:45:31.980 --> 2:45:37.820]  the country Austin myself included people are slobs now I mean people are
[2:45:37.820 --> 2:45:43.140]  incredibly baby like lazy slobs and then you've got folks that are actually
[2:45:43.140 --> 2:45:48.060]  working but more and more there's this slob class what is going to happen to
[2:45:48.060 --> 2:45:57.260]  the lazy slacker trending know-it-alls and people when when things implode and
[2:45:57.260 --> 2:46:01.940]  the welfare check they get the welfare check but because of inflation it won't
[2:46:01.940 --> 2:46:08.660]  buy anything I mean this is going to be hellish well the roaring 20s you were
[2:46:08.660 --> 2:46:11.300]  for later people are different the roaring 20s and 30s no they were
[2:46:11.300 --> 2:46:16.060]  different from the 30s on roaring 20s people were dancing on tables they we
[2:46:16.060 --> 2:46:19.620]  got in this la la land world the 30s brought us back to reality in World
[2:46:19.620 --> 2:46:23.660]  War two and then we became an industrialist nation again this we call
[2:46:23.660 --> 2:46:27.900]  it the winter season you know there's spring like the 40s 50s and 60s there's
[2:46:27.900 --> 2:46:32.780]  summer like the 60s and 70s there's the fall boom bubble boom like the 80s 90s
[2:46:32.780 --> 2:46:36.620]  and 2000 and then there's winter like the next decade or so brings you back
[2:46:36.620 --> 2:46:39.980]  down to reality if you're lazy you're gonna have to get off your ass and do
[2:46:39.980 --> 2:46:44.500]  something if systems are out of balance or home prices are too high or
[2:46:44.500 --> 2:46:48.060]  government deficits and debt are too high it's going to be correct if that is
[2:46:48.060 --> 2:46:53.460]  what the winter season does it brings reality again fall booms like the roaring
[2:46:53.460 --> 2:46:57.580]  20s and in the last two decades bring a lot of innovation and new stuff but we
[2:46:57.580 --> 2:47:01.820]  can't take advantage of that until we get back into reality again so I think
[2:47:01.820 --> 2:47:04.860]  you're going to see people change I don't think you're going to see people
[2:47:04.860 --> 2:47:08.620]  change until you see a crisis and I think the younger generation today
[2:47:08.620 --> 2:47:14.180]  actually is more conservative than the baby boomers and more grounded if you
[2:47:14.180 --> 2:47:18.820]  just get this crisis and and get a new system where they can do well again I
[2:47:18.820 --> 2:47:22.300]  actually it's funny you say that I mean I know you follow statistics and things
[2:47:22.300 --> 2:47:26.140]  but younger generations are anti-abortion they're more pro-second
[2:47:26.140 --> 2:47:32.260]  amendment they're more anti-big government that's true it is more even
[2:47:32.260 --> 2:47:38.780]  like people 40 to 60 or so that's more of the trendy group I mean there's some
[2:47:38.780 --> 2:47:42.460]  young people that are in La La Land but I agree with you it's what do you call
[2:47:42.460 --> 2:47:46.860]  the group right below the baby boomers well there's the baby busters they
[2:47:46.860 --> 2:47:50.540]  call them generation X and then there's that that's the downward generation then
[2:47:50.540 --> 2:47:55.940]  the next growing generation is generation Y or the millennials the generation Y
[2:47:55.940 --> 2:48:00.340]  the millennials and the generation cycle over history is more like the Bob
[2:48:00.340 --> 2:48:03.340]  Hope generation that grew up in the Great Depression and fought World War
[2:48:03.340 --> 2:48:07.620]  War II they will be the opposite of their parents they will not be like the baby
[2:48:07.620 --> 2:48:13.300]  boom look at what the so-called hippies have done I mean they claim they want
[2:48:13.300 --> 2:48:18.380]  liberty and things that are a bunch of tyrants well again though I mean they
[2:48:18.380 --> 2:48:22.140]  have a place to every I mean think people like don't like winter they don't
[2:48:22.140 --> 2:48:25.980]  like depressions they like booms they don't like bust all of these things we
[2:48:25.980 --> 2:48:30.300]  have four seasons the creator didn't create these four seasons for no reason
[2:48:30.300 --> 2:48:35.460]  we see four seasons and everything we study each season has its place the kind
[2:48:35.460 --> 2:48:39.780]  of the the baby boom you know hippie types they they're very creative they
[2:48:39.780 --> 2:48:43.300]  create a lot of breakthrough technologies because they're like kids they
[2:48:43.300 --> 2:48:48.300]  start anew but then you have to grow up and then the next generation is going
[2:48:48.300 --> 2:48:53.940]  to be more mature and it's going to be different the Henry Ford generation was
[2:48:53.940 --> 2:48:59.860]  before the Bob Hope they were the people who were you know roaring 20s and all
[2:48:59.860 --> 2:49:02.980]  this stuff and artists and stuff they were more creative and they created
[2:49:02.980 --> 2:49:06.940]  cars and automobiles and all these things and phones but it was the Bob Hope
[2:49:06.940 --> 2:49:10.780]  generation that brought it into mainstream practical applications so
[2:49:10.780 --> 2:49:15.060]  these generations are different they're supposed to be but the baby boomers are
[2:49:15.060 --> 2:49:18.900]  aging in there they're waning the the next generation is going to have more
[2:49:18.900 --> 2:49:23.940]  influence but they need to get all of this access from the past all of this
[2:49:23.940 --> 2:49:28.700]  debt all of these excessive regulations and structures out of the way so they
[2:49:28.700 --> 2:49:33.420]  can move forward we'll see what they're like when the baby boomers in the past
[2:49:33.420 --> 2:49:36.740]  gets out of the way I think sure sure but these cycles are studied and if you
[2:49:36.740 --> 2:49:40.980]  look at governments militaries they're all addressing what you're talking about
[2:49:40.980 --> 2:49:44.700]  mr. Dent but they're saying that they're going to artificially with
[2:49:44.700 --> 2:49:49.660]  technology and propaganda manipulate it and use this crisis to be the final
[2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:55.540]  season a scorched earth are like a volcanic eruption and bring in a tyranny
[2:49:55.540 --> 2:49:59.180]  from a conscious perspective I mean you're an informed guy certainly you've
[2:49:59.180 --> 2:50:04.500]  run across those writings and plans and stuff that's being developed yeah I
[2:50:04.500 --> 2:50:09.180]  don't see it as a turn it it's natural for people in power to increase their
[2:50:09.180 --> 2:50:12.900]  power that's happened through all history but the opposite trend and I've
[2:50:12.900 --> 2:50:18.100]  studied history for thousands of years not just decades or years the trend in
[2:50:18.100 --> 2:50:22.620]  history has been greater economic freedom greater individual freedom and
[2:50:22.620 --> 2:50:27.500]  more wealth being pushed down the system you go back 200 years you go back a
[2:50:27.500 --> 2:50:31.340]  thousand years you go back five no we're living like kings compared to people
[2:50:31.340 --> 2:50:35.700]  relations controlled everything way more tyranny in the past way more no no I
[2:50:35.700 --> 2:50:40.420]  agree with you we're living like kings we have godlike technology what we have
[2:50:40.420 --> 2:50:45.340]  today would be magic a hundred years ago I agree with you Liberty is on the
[2:50:45.340 --> 2:50:49.060]  March but I'm telling you the control freaks are gonna try to block us I want

[2:54:39.140 --> 2:54:47.700]  is HSdent just the initials HSdent.com HSdent.com and I agree with him
[2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:52.180]  the cycle is towards liberty but I've read and shown you Bertrand Russell
[2:54:52.180 --> 2:54:55.780]  you know globalist documents where they were 80 years ago saying this and
[2:54:55.780 --> 2:55:00.900]  talking about how they would construct this system to socially engineer us but
[2:55:00.900 --> 2:55:05.220]  they're bucking the course of history and I believe they're going to fail but
[2:55:05.220 --> 2:55:09.700]  it's going to be a war in the process I want to jam in a few quick questions from
[2:55:09.700 --> 2:55:13.140]  callers but Mr. Dent is you want to add anything to the statement you said
[2:55:13.140 --> 2:55:17.980]  earlier about the history. I agree it is towards freedom but there are these
[2:55:17.980 --> 2:55:22.540]  battles that the internet allows greater decentralization of information
[2:55:22.540 --> 2:55:25.900]  you're already seeing major dictators fall around the world we predicted this
[2:55:25.900 --> 2:55:30.540]  five or ten years ago so that's the trend but you're right it is a battle let's
[2:55:30.540 --> 2:55:35.260]  quick questions here Charles in Ohio you're on the air with our guests go
[2:55:35.260 --> 2:55:43.340]  ahead yes sir now I don't know a whole lot about the trend setting but I mean
[2:55:43.340 --> 2:55:48.260]  obviously if you guys have watched the trends long enough why haven't you guys
[2:55:48.260 --> 2:55:54.020]  been able to stop this economic crisis for happening well I mean like I like
[2:55:54.020 --> 2:56:00.740]  I'm gonna do that I mean I don't understand I mean I bet you get that
[2:56:00.740 --> 2:56:04.420]  question sometimes where people say you need to fix it Mr. Dent what's your
[2:56:04.420 --> 2:56:09.380]  comment to the caller well I can't I mean I've had people recommending me to
[2:56:09.380 --> 2:56:12.540]  leading politicians and people they're not gonna listen to me because what I
[2:56:12.540 --> 2:56:16.980]  say isn't acceptable then they're trying to defend the system they're doing what
[2:56:16.980 --> 2:56:20.180]  they do in fact I tell people we've been been able to predict all the trends in
[2:56:20.180 --> 2:56:24.620]  the economy broadly without looking at politics the politicians don't matter
[2:56:24.620 --> 2:56:28.660]  that much longer they don't want to hear that either so no yeah what we tell
[2:56:28.660 --> 2:56:32.820]  people individually you got to do what you can do you know you can't change the
[2:56:32.820 --> 2:56:36.220]  winds but you can reset your sales is what I would say yeah none of us is
[2:56:36.220 --> 2:56:39.620]  in charge that's how you're gonna beat this is getting self-sufficient waking
[2:56:39.620 --> 2:56:46.140]  those up around you so that as things go into this cycle of collapse you're
[2:56:46.140 --> 2:56:49.780]  ready you know the best thing you can do is take care of yourself Charles and
[2:56:49.780 --> 2:56:53.900]  and try to wake up some people along the way so that people aren't caught flat
[2:56:53.900 --> 2:56:58.620]  footed you understand that yes sir I had one other thing I wanted to talk to you
[2:56:58.620 --> 2:57:02.380]  about okay we're almost out of time I'm gonna put you on hold and come back in
[2:57:02.380 --> 2:57:07.620]  overdrive I'm gonna go to Janet to a New York listing on WASB 1310 but let's
[2:57:07.620 --> 2:57:13.660]  real quick Malcolm in Texas you got about 30 seconds go okay yeah I just wanted
[2:57:13.660 --> 2:57:17.580]  to ask you how much you think the downgrade of the banking system are
[2:57:17.580 --> 2:57:22.580]  because of a foreign bond exposure and also how much do you think the shadow
[2:57:22.580 --> 2:57:26.140]  banking system is going to start affecting the the real retail side of
[2:57:26.140 --> 2:57:31.980]  things great question well I mean you know clearly I mean the shadow banking
[2:57:31.980 --> 2:57:35.740]  system was how we created so much more debt than in past cycles and all
[2:57:35.740 --> 2:57:40.620]  countries private and government systems have created more debt two to three
[2:57:40.620 --> 2:57:45.700]  times more debt than at any time compared to the economy and GDP than any
[2:57:45.700 --> 2:57:50.260]  time in history we can't even find a debt bubble in history to compare to this so
[2:57:50.260 --> 2:57:54.340]  it all happened together it's all going to break down together and so all these
[2:57:54.340 --> 2:57:57.980]  things are interdependent that's why nobody can really control this they're
[2:57:57.980 --> 2:58:01.460]  trying to control it but I what we're said we said in the Great Depression ahead
[2:58:01.460 --> 2:58:05.780]  and again the great crash ahead these governments are gonna lose control of
[2:58:05.780 --> 2:58:09.980]  this before it's over and they're going to break down as well exactly and
[2:58:09.980 --> 2:58:14.140]  they're trying to sign us on to their derivatives that's that's impossible to

[3:00:29.380 --> 3:00:36.300]  New York a WASB 1310 AM we've been on that station about 12 years Janet good
[3:00:36.300 --> 3:00:42.060]  to have you calling in today welcome thank you very much amen to you my
[3:00:42.060 --> 3:00:47.540]  brother you are absolutely correct regrettably we are a different group of
[3:00:47.540 --> 3:00:54.580]  people and one of the questions I had for your guest is about the Obamacare
[3:00:54.580 --> 3:00:59.220]  going back to the question at the top of the hour asking us to call in with our
[3:00:59.220 --> 3:01:06.140]  concerns my concern is the text that will be levied against some people who the
[3:01:06.140 --> 3:01:14.420]  government decides choose not to be able to pay or to afford for health care
[3:01:14.420 --> 3:01:18.060]  they're healthy they don't want to buy health care so the government is going
[3:01:18.060 --> 3:01:22.660]  to tax them here's my question how long is it going to take for people to
[3:01:22.660 --> 3:01:28.860]  recognize the Ponzi scheme and say gee if I don't have a job not only do I not
[3:01:28.860 --> 3:01:34.980]  get a tax but I get my health care for free well that's a really great point
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:38.060]  and you've hit the nail on the head in fact you made me just think of the one
[3:01:38.060 --> 3:01:42.420]  point I had made that many others have made it nauseam this is designed and
[3:01:42.420 --> 3:01:47.260]  Michael Moore pretty much admitted it to bankrupt health care you know it's
[3:01:47.260 --> 3:01:52.340]  a tax the insurance companies it'll be the the illegals are going to pour in
[3:01:52.340 --> 3:01:56.020]  already do they get their kids paid for and then the child's a US citizen it's
[3:01:56.020 --> 3:02:01.820]  designed to bankrupt things and it's a tax also to the IRS because they get
[3:02:01.820 --> 3:02:04.980]  penalties and interest and they keep that part so it's the government in our
[3:02:04.980 --> 3:02:09.020]  health care but it's designed to bankrupt things on purpose and it will do
[3:02:09.020 --> 3:02:12.780]  it and it's got tens of thousands of doctors are quitting because they know
[3:02:12.780 --> 3:02:16.580]  what this means it's not about them making money specialist doctors make
[3:02:16.580 --> 3:02:20.700]  millions your average doctor you can look this up or Dennis is making less than
[3:02:20.700 --> 3:02:24.820]  they were making 20 years ago a lot less I mean you think a regular person
[3:02:24.820 --> 3:02:30.220]  has bills it's like a half million bucks for a medical degree on average the eight
[3:02:30.220 --> 3:02:34.580]  years and then with interest you're talking over a million dollars I mean I
[3:02:34.580 --> 3:02:41.420]  know Harvard doctors that have been you know doctors out of college for 20 years
[3:02:41.420 --> 3:02:47.860]  and they just now paid off their loans and all the rest of it 20 years later so
[3:02:47.860 --> 3:02:52.060]  everybody's like all the rich doctors they're greedy okay folks best health
[3:02:52.060 --> 3:02:55.140]  care system the world been screwed up by government now it's going down the
[3:02:55.140 --> 3:02:59.180]  drain good to hear from you great point Janet John and Illinois I know you were
[3:02:59.180 --> 3:03:04.820]  for the guest but he had to leave us go ahead make a point yeah well I just said
[3:03:04.820 --> 3:03:09.740]  a quick thing for regarding Max Kaiser's rant a couple months ago when he
[3:03:09.740 --> 3:03:15.860]  when he spoke about how Jamie Diamond threatened MFL MF Globals John Corsi so
[3:03:15.860 --> 3:03:20.500]  that she just asked Kerry if he agreed with that if it was in fact actual and
[3:03:20.500 --> 3:03:25.300]  then also does that have anything to do with the two billion loss that JPMorgan
[3:03:25.300 --> 3:03:28.580]  Chase recently admitted to I mean is there a connection between that or what's
[3:03:28.580 --> 3:03:33.180]  going on with that yes I believe that loss was connected and of course we knew
[3:03:33.180 --> 3:03:38.100]  it was JPMorgan got the two billion over to London and then denied it but it was
[3:03:38.100 --> 3:03:41.620]  already in the news was already in Bloomberg and then Forbes that they got
[3:03:41.620 --> 3:03:45.860]  the two billion and then it was 800 million a billion three a billion six
[3:03:45.860 --> 3:03:48.740]  that was owed back when we heard all these different numbers but best I can
[3:03:48.740 --> 3:03:55.900]  tell they gave back about a billion to investors farmers and people that were
[3:03:55.900 --> 3:04:01.060]  hedging their beds and kept the rest of it so I don't think it would be a two
[3:04:01.060 --> 3:04:03.700]  billion dollar loss but look look now they're saying they're sitting on top
[3:04:03.700 --> 3:04:09.940]  nine billion in losses folks the derivatives overhang in the Washington
[3:04:09.940 --> 3:04:13.820]  post two years ago which the only reason I'm quoting Washington post is it fits
[3:04:13.820 --> 3:04:17.380]  into other economists we've had on it's what Tarpley says he said that a year
[3:04:17.380 --> 3:04:24.020]  before they said it that's pretty smart 644 trillion is what the US owes in the
[3:04:24.020 --> 3:04:29.340]  global derivatives market that's the crud our criminal banks created it's over
[3:04:29.340 --> 3:04:34.780]  1.5 quadrillion 1500 trillion worldwide so we've got a little less than half of
[3:04:34.780 --> 3:04:40.860]  that so can you imagine how big that is how bad that is how impossible that is
[3:04:40.860 --> 3:04:46.540]  to pay back I mean it's a fraud they're just using our sign on to that debt as
[3:04:46.540 --> 3:04:50.820]  a way to get us more and more indebted to them so when they bankrupt everything
[3:04:50.820 --> 3:04:54.700]  right off their debt we'll be little guys and can't get out from under the
[3:04:54.700 --> 3:04:58.140]  debt they've gotten this into you understand their exempt were not
[3:04:58.140 --> 3:05:24.940]  that's the fraud arrest them arrest them arrest them arrest them
