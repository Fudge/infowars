[00:00.000 --> 00:25.200]  It's Tuesday, April 5th, the year is 2022.
[00:25.200 --> 00:28.560]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from Connecticut.
[00:28.560 --> 00:32.640]  Owen Stroyer is about to be taking over from the ATX here in just a few minutes, and I've
[00:32.640 --> 00:37.840]  got several extremely informative reports coming up in this hour as well that I taped
[00:37.840 --> 00:38.840]  earlier.
[00:38.840 --> 00:42.160]  But first, I want to make this perfectly clear.
[00:42.160 --> 00:46.680]  We warned the world four and a half years ago when I got de-platformed, de-banked and
[00:46.680 --> 00:53.960]  persecuted at communist Chinese levels, that the reason I was being demonized was because
[00:53.960 --> 01:00.200]  M4 Wars was seen as a symbol of the American populist and a symbol of resistance worldwide.
[01:00.200 --> 01:07.560]  And if we continued to succeed, 1776 worldwide would occur with people declaring their independence
[01:07.560 --> 01:12.160]  against the World Economic Forum and the globalist New World Order.
[01:12.160 --> 01:14.200]  That's why I'm enemy number one.
[01:14.200 --> 01:19.000]  And understanding why I'm enemy number one is the key to bringing them down.
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.320]  And supporting and keeping us on air is critical because the enemy is obsessed with destroying
[01:23.320 --> 01:29.000]  us and taking us off air so they can steal our identity and misrepresent who we are worldwide
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.920]  and kill the idea of the American rugged individualist and populist.
[01:32.920 --> 01:35.400]  So we are all at the tip of the spear.
[01:35.400 --> 01:38.040]  The viewers and listeners of the show are so precious.
[01:38.040 --> 01:41.960]  We told you first they came for Alex Jones, then they came for everybody else.
[01:41.960 --> 01:46.400]  And now here in Connecticut with literally kangaroo trials where I can't defend myself
[01:46.400 --> 01:50.520]  and I'm already guilty when it goes to the jury.
[01:50.520 --> 01:55.240]  They are literally setting the precedent and bragging to get rid of populist and conservatives
[01:55.240 --> 01:59.680]  and veterans and police officers and you name it, due process.
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.240]  So this is an authoritarian reign of terror taking place to shut down free speech and
[02:04.240 --> 02:05.240]  silence opposition.
[02:05.240 --> 02:10.640]  So this is the next level of the takeover is now physically bankrupting people and putting
[02:10.640 --> 02:12.040]  them in jail for their speech.
[02:12.040 --> 02:17.040]  Look at the January 6 people, some of them totally peaceful, still in jail.
[02:17.040 --> 02:21.320]  But Kamala Harris was bailing people out that were burning down people's buildings including
[02:21.320 --> 02:23.720]  attacking federal buildings of Molotov cocktails.
[02:23.720 --> 02:25.520]  That's all mostly peaceful and good.
[02:25.520 --> 02:28.880]  But when conservatives walk in the Capitol peacefully they get arrested.
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.120]  This is the new world order future where the prisons are emptied of criminals and filled
[02:33.120 --> 02:34.420]  with good people.
[02:34.420 --> 02:38.240]  This is the judicial tyranny and that's why now more than ever you must override them
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.400]  with your word of mouth spreading this live feed because it is the tip of the spear.
[02:42.400 --> 02:47.480]  It is the bat signal fired out to humanity to awaken and say no in full words is the
[02:47.480 --> 02:49.080]  standard of resistance.
[02:49.080 --> 02:52.040]  You are the standard of resistance and that's why our work is so critical.
[02:52.040 --> 02:54.080]  I am honored to be enemy number one.
[02:54.080 --> 02:56.240]  I am honored to have the enemy come after me first.
[02:56.240 --> 03:00.240]  But understand as Trump always says they're trying to get through me to get to you.
[03:00.240 --> 03:06.000]  So please keep us on air, keep us in your prayers and financially support us at infowarstore.com.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.680]  Owen Schroyer takes over.
[03:07.680 --> 03:13.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, and we will be hearing from Alex.
[03:13.560 --> 03:14.840]  He's already filed some reports.
[03:14.840 --> 03:21.600]  We're going to be airing through the transmission here today on this Tuesday, April 5, 2022.
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.840]  We've also got a great guest coming on who was one of the first people to break the story
[03:26.840 --> 03:34.520]  about the biolabs in Ukraine and we're going to get his take on the biolabs, Russia targeting
[03:34.520 --> 03:41.160]  the biolabs, the Biden involvement in the biolabs and all of that.
[03:41.160 --> 03:46.040]  And then here's what I have on my desk before we come back when the Alex Jones report.
[03:46.040 --> 03:54.440]  Big news is breaking when it comes to the election theft that took place in 2020, the
[03:54.440 --> 03:56.840]  presidential election theft.
[03:56.840 --> 03:59.600]  We've got big breaking news on that.
[03:59.600 --> 04:05.040]  There are some developments in the Russia versus the globalist narrative, and that's
[04:05.040 --> 04:06.040]  what it is.
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.320]  Yeah, you have Russia going into Ukraine and they've got their agenda there, but then
[04:10.320 --> 04:15.800]  you have the globalist agenda that's anti-Russia and they're making moves right now just stealing
[04:15.800 --> 04:18.480]  Russian's property, just saying, oh, you're a Russian billionaire, we're just going to
[04:18.480 --> 04:21.720]  take all your money, we're going to take your property, just, oh, okay.
[04:21.720 --> 04:25.480]  So that's the globalists doing that.
[04:25.480 --> 04:30.960]  Here's a slew of news stories today discussing mental health in this country and what's going
[04:30.960 --> 04:32.320]  on with women and children.
[04:32.320 --> 04:38.320]  Ah, well, what is the left targeted more than anything else culturally in this country,
[04:38.320 --> 04:39.480]  the women and children?
[04:39.480 --> 04:43.000]  Why are their suicide rates and mental health rates skyrocketing?
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.560]  Because that's what liberalism is, it's a mental disorder.
[04:45.560 --> 04:49.440]  We do also have some COVID news, some just incredible political news.
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.280]  When it comes to what Biden and Harris are up to, it's really quite an embarrassment.
[04:54.280 --> 05:00.600]  All that and more coming up on today's Alex Jones show.
[05:00.600 --> 05:08.840]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[05:08.840 --> 05:12.120]  Coin, and it sold out in 10 days.
[05:12.120 --> 05:16.560]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[05:16.560 --> 05:20.000]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.320]  Now the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered and it will probably sell
[05:25.320 --> 05:27.400]  out in 10 days again.
[05:27.400 --> 05:29.880]  It certainly needs to in front of operation.
[05:29.880 --> 05:34.900]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[05:34.900 --> 05:38.760]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more.
[05:38.760 --> 05:42.760]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[05:42.760 --> 05:45.000]  It's also at infowarstore.com.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  It's amazing.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.800]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[05:47.800 --> 05:51.320]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something
[05:51.320 --> 05:55.800]  very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[05:55.800 --> 06:23.800]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[06:23.800 --> 06:46.760]  Government, buy the people, off the people, for the people.
[06:46.760 --> 06:56.160]  But the people are retarded.
[06:56.160 --> 07:17.440]  So let us say government buy the retarded, for the retarded, off the retarded.
[07:17.440 --> 07:27.160]  Even the famous cult leader guru, Osho, understood the danger of the mad how of pure democracy
[07:27.160 --> 07:33.280]  that the author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, warned the world about.
[07:33.280 --> 07:40.560]  In a republic, you generally have two parties so that the people can balance power between
[07:40.560 --> 07:41.560]  those.
[07:41.560 --> 07:46.640]  You try to separate the government into different factions in our country.
[07:46.640 --> 07:50.480]  You have the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
[07:50.480 --> 08:01.680]  And it is that separation of powers that stops cults or gangs or organized crime syndicates
[08:01.680 --> 08:05.280]  or dictators, oligarchies, to be able to get control.
[08:05.280 --> 08:09.840]  Because you don't just split up the federal government into three branches.
[08:09.840 --> 08:12.160]  You then separate federal and state power.
[08:12.160 --> 08:17.960]  And then you have state and local power because it all comes from we the people.
[08:17.960 --> 08:25.040]  It's all designed to stop the type of tyrannies that have been seen destroying amazing civilizations
[08:25.040 --> 08:27.760]  throughout history.
[08:27.760 --> 08:33.120]  And so when we see what's happening in the world today under radical leftist bullying,
[08:33.120 --> 08:37.880]  it's mega corporations coming in and taking over governments, getting their politicians
[08:37.880 --> 08:44.160]  and operatives into place, who swear allegiance to the code of the Davos group, which is the
[08:44.160 --> 08:45.160]  Bilderberg group.
[08:45.160 --> 08:46.960]  Klaus Schwab heads up both.
[08:46.960 --> 08:51.760]  And their goal, you're now seeing it, is a post-industrial world, feudalism making you
[08:51.760 --> 08:53.280]  very, very poor.
[08:53.280 --> 08:55.960]  And that's just the people that are allowed to survive.
[08:55.960 --> 08:59.680]  They want at least a 90% population reduction.
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.400]  Then the globalists have their private jets, their huge estates, their fabulous wealth.
[09:04.400 --> 09:06.240]  They enjoy all the technology.
[09:06.240 --> 09:07.960]  They enjoy all the medicine.
[09:07.960 --> 09:10.040]  They enjoy the culture.
[09:10.040 --> 09:13.260]  You get starved to death and killed.
[09:13.260 --> 09:16.000]  So this is really the issue of our age.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.480]  And this is the issue for all of human history now, if we allow ourselves to go under this
[09:22.480 --> 09:24.600]  incredible tyranny.
[09:24.600 --> 09:28.640]  Just a few weeks ago, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright died.
[09:28.640 --> 09:34.280]  And the media around the world celebrated her as just the most wonderful thing ever
[09:34.280 --> 09:38.080]  because she was the first Secretary of State who was a female.
[09:38.080 --> 09:41.880]  But if you look at what she actually did, she supported wars.
[09:41.880 --> 09:46.520]  She supported sanctions that killed millions and millions of people.
[09:46.520 --> 09:53.720]  And just in Iraq, it was estimated by the UN, 500,000-plus children, just under the sanctions
[09:53.720 --> 09:59.400]  that she put on Iraq during Bill Clinton's administration.
[09:59.400 --> 10:01.440]  Herbert Walker had already put some sanctions on them.
[10:01.440 --> 10:08.120]  But the Clintons tripled it at her suggestion, and they wouldn't even let basic antibiotics
[10:08.120 --> 10:11.040]  get into the country, and a half million children died.
[10:11.040 --> 10:16.040]  And she famously said that it was a good price to pay.
[10:16.040 --> 10:19.200]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.880]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[10:24.880 --> 10:28.640]  And is the price worth it?
[10:28.640 --> 10:34.080]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price we think the price is worth it.
[10:34.080 --> 10:42.880]  It's important on this April 5, 2022, Tuesday broadcast, to pull back at a 35,000-foot view
[10:42.880 --> 10:50.240]  and ask yourself, why is the entire leftist media, the corporate media from Japan to Europe
[10:50.240 --> 10:55.400]  to the UK, Australia to the US, praising this woman two weeks after she died?
[10:55.400 --> 10:57.400]  It's still all over television.
[10:57.400 --> 11:00.360]  It's still all over the newspapers, why?
[11:00.360 --> 11:05.840]  Because they're rewriting history, ladies and gentlemen, while they pick out other individuals
[11:05.840 --> 11:10.320]  and groups who they want to villainize, who they want to demonize.
[11:10.320 --> 11:15.280]  And it's only when the public has very short attention spans and doesn't know about history
[11:15.280 --> 11:19.000]  that they're able to be manipulated with this information.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.480]  Here's a case point example.
[11:21.480 --> 11:27.160]  If you go out and ask the general public about Sandy Hook 10 years ago, a bunch of children
[11:27.160 --> 11:32.640]  being shot to death in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, people are going to say, Alex Jones.
[11:32.640 --> 11:36.680]  Believe me, I'm Alex Jones, I experienced it on the street.
[11:36.680 --> 11:40.240]  Some people walk up to me and say, you killed the children.
[11:40.240 --> 11:41.640]  That's mind control.
[11:41.640 --> 11:43.360]  That's a dumb-down population.
[11:43.360 --> 11:47.160]  But that's how the Democratic Party in Hillary Clinton five years ago, six years ago when
[11:47.160 --> 11:49.200]  Trump was winning, got upset.
[11:49.200 --> 11:52.520]  They knew that I was leading a major populist movement.
[11:52.520 --> 11:53.520]  They said, what do we do?
[11:53.520 --> 11:57.000]  Well, we look at Jones' history, things he's covered, things he's questioned.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.960]  And we make him the Sandy Hook man.
[12:00.960 --> 12:06.880]  And then any time people talk about Alex Jones, we get to bring Sandy Hook back up and go
[12:06.880 --> 12:08.600]  after everybody's guns again.
[12:08.600 --> 12:14.120]  But more importantly, use the attack on Alex Jones to set the precedent to then take people's
[12:14.120 --> 12:15.600]  free speech away.
[12:15.600 --> 12:20.720]  And again, this should only be done with an extremely dumb-down public.
[12:20.720 --> 12:25.440]  And so what's happened is we don't have a separation of powers to a great extent anymore.
[12:25.440 --> 12:33.160]  And we have the judicial branch that is becoming its own tyranny and that is engaging in any
[12:33.160 --> 12:40.240]  type of activity they wish because there's no real checks and balances on them.
[12:40.240 --> 12:47.800]  So when you have the perfect storm of a dumb-down, historically illiterate population with mega-corporations
[12:47.800 --> 12:55.880]  that are extremely predatory, you get a perfect storm of what they call technocratic tyranny.
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.080]  And that's what this whole cashless society, programmable money systems that are being
[13:01.080 --> 13:04.800]  announced and the world government that's being announced is actually rolling out right
[13:04.800 --> 13:05.800]  now.
[13:05.800 --> 13:08.640]  Now, remember that same corporate media for decades told you, world government doesn't
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.880]  exist, new world order doesn't exist, there's no Bilderberg group, and now it's all out
[13:14.880 --> 13:20.520]  in the open because they're going from beta accelerating into operational, and everybody
[13:20.520 --> 13:27.880]  needs to be concerned about this going into operational because its plan is at least 80%
[13:27.880 --> 13:32.360]  depopulation by 2030, and you can see how that's now beginning all over the world.
[13:32.360 --> 13:37.840]  So humanity must become the checks and balances again, we must identify who the enemies are,
[13:37.840 --> 13:41.960]  we must understand how they manipulated us, and we've got to say, why is Marilyn Albright,
[13:41.960 --> 13:46.440]  a hero, when she gave the orders to kill a half a million children and sat on TV, she
[13:46.440 --> 13:48.040]  was proud of it?
[13:48.040 --> 13:53.440]  How is George Soros, the admitted Nazi collaborator that bankrupted more than 20 nations systems
[13:53.440 --> 13:55.240]  and stole old people's pension funds?
[13:55.240 --> 13:58.600]  How is he a hero, but Alex Jones is bad?
[13:58.600 --> 14:02.360]  This is bigger than Alex Jones, but just think about the power of the corporate media to
[14:02.360 --> 14:08.120]  demonize someone for questioning events, when there's been so many staged events in history,
[14:08.120 --> 14:12.400]  and that's the ultimate crime, is questioning the official narrative, but when you actually
[14:12.400 --> 14:17.040]  kill a half million children deliberately, it's now a good thing.
[14:17.040 --> 14:19.360]  That is nothing less than mind control.
[14:19.360 --> 14:25.480]  So when we see men posing as women wearing admiral outfits, and men in women's wrestling
[14:25.480 --> 14:31.040]  choking out women, and when we see open borders and we see the Supreme Court justice nominee
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.600]  since you can't say what a woman is, and we witness the devaluation of our currency and
[14:35.600 --> 14:41.880]  all of this, this is the checks and balances of good people not being involved, being removed,
[14:41.880 --> 14:46.120]  and into that vacuum comes all the tyrants, all the criminals, all the evil people.
[14:46.120 --> 14:49.440]  Thomas Jefferson was asked, what is the level of tyranny humans will live under?
[14:49.440 --> 14:52.560]  And he said it is the level to which you will accept.
[14:52.560 --> 14:58.120]  There's always someone more evil to come into the vacuum when good people don't stand up,
[14:58.120 --> 15:04.560]  and so it's accelerating, it's getting worse and worse by the day, and people have to understand
[15:04.560 --> 15:09.200]  that being lazy, not being engaged, going along with political correctness is basically
[15:09.200 --> 15:12.920]  sucking the oxygen out of the room and it's going to destroy us, and that having courage
[15:12.920 --> 15:18.400]  and questioning and being involved and standing up against censorship is the answer.
[15:18.400 --> 15:22.640]  There's an article on infowords.com today by Paul Watson, where the Big National Museum
[15:22.640 --> 15:30.560]  of Art in the UK is changing the names of art, taking any names that basically say Russian
[15:30.560 --> 15:31.800]  off of them.
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.240]  We have to decide who we are and what we stand for.
[15:35.240 --> 15:40.080]  We're going to lose our entire culture, our entire civilization, it really just comes
[15:40.080 --> 15:41.080]  down to that.
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.440]  It's the decision that all of us have to make because things are only going to get worse
[15:44.440 --> 15:45.440]  the more we live in denial.
[15:45.440 --> 15:48.320]  It's only going to get better by standing up doing the right thing.
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.080]  Some of us will be demonized who are at the tip of the spear, that's okay, I volunteered
[15:52.080 --> 15:59.360]  for this because not standing up and being a total slave is a fate far worse.
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.120]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[16:03.120 --> 16:07.760]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[16:07.760 --> 16:15.480]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered
[16:15.480 --> 16:20.040]  and I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins
[16:20.040 --> 16:24.280]  and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the
[16:24.280 --> 16:26.560]  front lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[16:26.560 --> 16:34.280]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty tree coin.
[16:34.280 --> 16:36.320]  It is powerful.
[16:36.320 --> 16:41.920]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part
[16:41.920 --> 16:47.720]  of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future.

[17:23.480 --> 17:25.600]  of the globalist making their main move.

[19:04.320 --> 19:07.920]  is now available at info wars store.com.
[19:07.920 --> 19:12.200]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it
[19:12.200 --> 19:17.360]  has been used for hundreds of years in the pacific islands for its relaxation and euphoric
[19:17.360 --> 19:18.360]  effects.
[19:18.360 --> 19:24.040]  According to ancient simoan legend kava was given as a gift by the sun god tagaloa, who
[19:24.040 --> 19:28.280]  they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[19:28.280 --> 19:33.000]  The simoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.200]  loosen up a little.
[19:34.200 --> 19:38.720]  Nowadays kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[19:38.720 --> 19:45.080]  The new kava chill by dr. jones naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava but other
[19:45.080 --> 19:51.800]  herbs including but not limited to german chamomile, organic skullcap and ballerian root.

[20:27.200 --> 20:32.360]  We are back on this special Tuesday, April 5th edition of the alex jones show.
[20:32.360 --> 20:35.800]  Thank you for tuning in and again thank you for spreading the word about the broadcast.

[20:44.560 --> 20:47.160]  nail to suppress the voice of the people.
[20:47.160 --> 20:51.560]  So together we are going to defeat these globalists and I again thank you all for taking action
[20:51.560 --> 20:55.800]  and realizing how important your word of mouth is to override your tyranny.
[20:55.800 --> 21:01.320]  Separately I want to remind listeners that we are fighting the globalist at point blank
[21:01.320 --> 21:06.760]  range with every ounce of energy and will and finances we have and without you we will
[21:06.760 --> 21:08.680]  not be able to continue on.
[21:08.680 --> 21:11.600]  Plus we have great products at info wars store.com.
[21:11.600 --> 21:13.160]  Take advantage of them now.
[21:13.160 --> 21:16.400]  Palm and block has been sold out for 11 months.
[21:16.400 --> 21:22.920]  It is a natural system that is wonderful for allergies and hay fever and so much more.

[21:27.240 --> 21:32.000]  off at info wars store.com right on time for spring.

[21:37.480 --> 21:38.960]  It is a three part series.
[21:38.960 --> 21:40.240]  It is limited edition.
[21:40.240 --> 21:44.000]  There will only be 10,000 of this coin made, there will be 10,000 of the next coin made
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  and then that is it, the three part series.
[21:47.000 --> 21:53.200]  It is a founder coin meaning it is being used to really energize our operation and ensure
[21:53.200 --> 21:57.400]  that we are not taking off the year and then everybody that does become a founding member
[21:57.400 --> 22:02.040]  by buying the coin, if you put your email in when you get the coin you will be sent
[22:02.040 --> 22:06.880]  in the future, very near future, a lot of really, really special exclusive things unless
[22:06.880 --> 22:10.520]  there is a nuclear war or I get assassinated or put in prison and taken off the year.
[22:10.520 --> 22:15.840]  But if we are able to keep fighting, founding members will definitely be pleased.
[22:15.840 --> 22:20.320]  And then finally there is a lot of other great products at infowarstore.com but we were doing
[22:20.320 --> 22:23.200]  a lot of accounting trying to find money to pay the payroll and they are like hey Alex
[22:23.200 --> 22:27.240]  we keep telling you keep designing new shirts all the time but never really promoting them
[22:27.240 --> 22:34.360]  so some shirts sell some don't but we have 63,000 shirts and it just sell them at cost
[22:34.360 --> 22:37.960]  and we will move about the door and then only have a few shirts that are limited edition
[22:37.960 --> 22:42.040]  here and there that are popular that way we don't have half the warehouse full of stuff,
[22:42.040 --> 22:43.040]  it is killing us.
[22:43.040 --> 22:46.640]  We are absolutely right and the listeners have really come through, we started this
[22:46.640 --> 22:54.120]  special deal on Wednesday of last week and we have now sold 13,000 t-shirts as of this
[22:54.120 --> 22:55.120]  morning.

[23:37.920 --> 23:39.960]  so please pray for us.
[23:39.960 --> 23:47.800]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, more coming up from Alex this hour and then a great guest
[23:47.800 --> 23:50.040]  in the second hour.
[23:50.040 --> 23:55.480]  Let me just hit some of the news right now before we come back with Alex, COVID cases
[23:55.480 --> 23:59.760]  in China hit record as Shanghai extends lockdown.
[23:59.760 --> 24:06.360]  So yeah, they locked down an entire, basically it would be like locking down an entire city
[24:06.360 --> 24:12.280]  or even state, they are trying to test 26 million in Shanghai as their goal to COVID
[24:12.280 --> 24:15.360]  test 26 million.
[24:15.360 --> 24:19.480]  More than 80% of the country's latest daily cases were in Shanghai where millions of people
[24:19.480 --> 24:20.640]  were confined to their home.
[24:20.640 --> 24:26.640]  So again, COVID cases hit record, but is that the story?
[24:26.640 --> 24:27.640]  No.
[24:27.640 --> 24:35.400]  The story is that they locked down the entire city of Shanghai, tested or plan on testing
[24:35.400 --> 24:41.760]  26 million individuals and then they say, oh, look, 80% of the COVID cases are in Shanghai.
[24:41.760 --> 24:43.080]  Oh, no kidding.
[24:43.080 --> 24:46.240]  Where you tested every single person?
[24:46.240 --> 24:48.720]  Wow.
[24:48.720 --> 24:50.360]  Who could have guessed that would have been the case.
[24:50.360 --> 24:54.680]  Folks, you can shut down New York City right now.
[24:54.680 --> 24:56.120]  Forget about COVID.
[24:56.120 --> 24:58.920]  You could test for any disease.
[24:58.920 --> 25:01.120]  How about herpes?
[25:01.120 --> 25:07.720]  You could go and shut down New York City and test however many million people reside there
[25:07.720 --> 25:14.640]  or however many million people you want in New York City and you can get a large number
[25:14.640 --> 25:19.760]  of people to test positive for herpes and you can say massive herpes outbreak in New
[25:19.760 --> 25:25.440]  York City and then say 90% of new herpes cases are in New York City.
[25:25.440 --> 25:27.200]  Well, what's the real story there?
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.400]  It's not that there's herpes in New York City or that herpes is all of a sudden spreading
[25:32.400 --> 25:35.880]  wild like wildfire or maybe that might be the case, but they're not making a big deal
[25:35.880 --> 25:37.040]  of it.
[25:37.040 --> 25:43.680]  The point is you can go to any city you want, test millions of people and get positive test
[25:43.680 --> 25:48.180]  results and then the media can just say, oh, look, it's an outbreak.
[25:48.180 --> 25:53.240]  You could do it with any disease, any virus, anything and then say, oh, wow, most of the
[25:53.240 --> 26:00.400]  new cases are in this city that we locked down and test everybody in.
[26:00.400 --> 26:03.160]  That should be common sense.
[26:03.160 --> 26:08.560]  I shouldn't have to explain that, but I do because when the Wall Street Journal reports
[26:08.560 --> 26:13.560]  on it, when all the mainstream news reports on it, they presented it face value like,
[26:13.560 --> 26:15.920]  wow, COVID has really hit Shanghai hard.
[26:15.920 --> 26:17.480]  It is just brutal there.
[26:17.480 --> 26:23.840]  No, what's brutal is the oppression of the people.
[26:23.840 --> 26:32.120]  What's brutal is the fake news media's coverage of it saying that there's a massive outbreak
[26:32.120 --> 26:35.640]  even though they essentially shut down the city so that they could get the numbers to
[26:35.640 --> 26:39.360]  say there was a massive outbreak.
[26:39.360 --> 26:43.840]  You'd think it'd be pretty common sense stuff to understand, but it's not and so we have
[26:43.840 --> 26:45.000]  to explain it.
[26:45.000 --> 26:53.400]  And now Fauci is crawling out of his rat hole and he's saying, get ready for more lockdowns
[26:53.400 --> 26:54.400]  here.
[26:54.400 --> 26:58.680]  I guess he loves what he's seeing in China and he says, it's a good thing.
[26:58.680 --> 27:00.520]  It's a positive thing to lockdown.
[27:00.520 --> 27:03.560]  It's a good thing to be a prisoner in your own country.
[27:03.560 --> 27:06.800]  Nobody likes a free country.
[27:06.800 --> 27:10.480]  I bet Fauci would like everybody locked down because he's afraid that he's going to get
[27:10.480 --> 27:13.920]  a lifelong prison sentence for his crimes against humanity.
[27:13.920 --> 27:20.080]  But you know, speaking of that, and I'll just go off on a jag real quick, I happened to
[27:20.080 --> 27:28.160]  rewatch the movie Dallas Buyer's Club this weekend and I don't know when it came out.
[27:28.160 --> 27:29.800]  I saw it when it came out.
[27:29.800 --> 27:31.960]  It was always a good film.
[27:31.960 --> 27:36.480]  It's not really my type of film, not really my genre or cinematic experience, but the
[27:36.480 --> 27:40.280]  movie is truly fantastic.
[27:40.280 --> 27:45.800]  And when you consider that that is based on a true story, and you now have a better idea
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.880]  of Fauci's involvement in the AIDS epidemic in the 80s, and you have a better idea of
[27:50.880 --> 27:57.660]  what the government did during COVID to just us in the last two plus years, and you rewatch
[27:57.660 --> 28:04.080]  that movie with that context and that perspective, it really hits even harder.
[28:04.080 --> 28:05.520]  Our government hates us, folks.
[28:05.520 --> 28:06.520]  They hate us.
[28:06.520 --> 28:08.040]  They want us dead.
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.120]  But I'll have to come back to this news because I just got to make this point.
[28:12.120 --> 28:14.080]  You got to understand something.
[28:14.080 --> 28:20.240]  The rulers of this planet, the people that believe they own this planet, you got to understand.
[28:20.240 --> 28:25.000]  I mean, to be honest, I'm really not even their enemy.
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.080]  They just hate me for my free speech and my pro-human views.
[28:28.080 --> 28:31.720]  They actually look at me like, hey, you're educated, you're smart, you're in good shape.
[28:31.720 --> 28:33.040]  They really don't want to kill me.
[28:33.040 --> 28:35.040]  They'd rather have a bunch of people like me running around.
[28:35.040 --> 28:40.000]  They see gay people, they see trans people, they see old people, they see fat people.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.360]  They literally want you dead.
[28:42.360 --> 28:46.640]  And in case you haven't noticed, that's why all the propaganda is aimed at you and aimed
[28:46.640 --> 28:49.600]  at women's wombs and children.
[28:49.600 --> 28:53.800]  It's a population control agenda, and when they see gay people having gay sex, like
[28:53.800 --> 28:57.920]  in the 80s, they literally wanted you dead, so they gave you a killer drug.
[28:57.920 --> 29:07.320]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder Series at 1776coin.com
[29:07.320 --> 29:11.600]  or m4store.com, and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[29:11.600 --> 29:15.120]  Thomas Jefferson, quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[29:15.120 --> 29:16.120]  It's a coin I designed.
[29:16.120 --> 29:20.160]  I'm very, very proud of it, and it will end up being a collectible.
[29:20.160 --> 29:25.240]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[29:25.240 --> 29:26.560]  we sold it.
[29:26.560 --> 29:32.240]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly, and I appreciate listeners getting
[29:32.240 --> 29:33.240]  over half of them now.
[29:33.240 --> 29:35.360]  I'd like to lose them out very quickly.
[29:35.360 --> 29:39.080]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[29:39.080 --> 29:43.680]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[29:43.680 --> 29:45.760]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems.
[29:45.760 --> 29:49.240]  So it was a limited edition, collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and
[29:49.240 --> 29:52.840]  freedom, and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[29:52.840 --> 29:59.600]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776coin.com.
[29:59.600 --> 30:04.160]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true, that Info Wars
[30:04.160 --> 30:12.200]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[30:12.200 --> 30:16.880]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[30:16.880 --> 30:23.720]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[30:23.720 --> 30:24.720]  done.
[30:24.720 --> 30:30.800]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at InfoWarsTour.com.
[30:30.800 --> 30:33.880]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[30:33.880 --> 30:38.520]  And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified, don't
[30:38.520 --> 30:42.080]  need me to tell you that at InfoWarsTour.com.
[30:42.080 --> 30:46.080]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[30:46.080 --> 30:50.440]  These have been sold out for a long time, like InfoWarsLife, Fizzy Magnesium Mix that's
[30:50.440 --> 30:54.920]  so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[30:54.920 --> 31:00.240]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at InfoWarsTour.com right now.
[31:00.240 --> 31:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[31:02.000 --> 31:05.440]  I need your help keeping InfoWars on the air and strong.
[31:05.440 --> 31:09.440]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[31:09.440 --> 31:10.600]  I was born for this.
[31:10.600 --> 31:11.600]  You were born for this.
[31:11.600 --> 31:16.440]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[31:16.440 --> 31:20.800]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[31:20.800 --> 31:25.480]  And now with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[31:25.480 --> 31:31.040]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content
[31:31.040 --> 31:32.280]  free of charge.
[31:32.280 --> 31:37.160]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[31:37.160 --> 31:41.680]  InfoWars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[31:41.680 --> 31:42.680]  movement worldwide.
[31:42.680 --> 31:48.360]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[31:48.360 --> 31:49.800]  of thousands of dollars a month.
[31:49.800 --> 31:54.080]  So the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[31:54.080 --> 31:59.800]  sale up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keeping InfoWars as strong as ever.
[31:59.800 --> 32:04.600]  April 2022 just kicked off and it's already been incredible.
[32:04.600 --> 32:10.680]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, they along with many other New World Order operatives
[32:10.680 --> 32:17.200]  have gone on national television and announced that we are now under a world government.
[32:17.200 --> 32:22.160]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit and
[32:22.160 --> 32:24.920]  they are announcing incredible tyranny.
[32:24.920 --> 32:28.680]  Everything we've talked about is now coming true and the globalists want to take us off
[32:28.680 --> 32:29.680]  air.
[32:29.680 --> 32:35.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of InfoWars right now.
[32:35.480 --> 32:41.600]  In our 28 years, all InfoWars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone
[32:41.600 --> 32:46.080]  and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps at InfoWars flags again.
[32:46.080 --> 32:49.680]  We may have t-shirts and apparel in the future, but I don't even know.
[32:49.680 --> 32:52.800]  We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[32:52.800 --> 32:57.800]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at infowarstore.com right
[32:57.800 --> 32:58.800]  now.
[32:58.800 --> 33:00.400]  It's going to cost.
[33:00.400 --> 33:20.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.440 --> 33:22.160]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:22.160 --> 33:23.920]  Well, so does he.
[33:23.920 --> 33:25.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:25.840 --> 33:28.920]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:28.920 --> 33:32.880]  Now look, I've got all the news here in front of me.
[33:32.880 --> 33:37.400]  I've got the political developments, I've got the COVID developments, I've got the cultural
[33:37.400 --> 33:41.080]  rot of the left developments, I've got election fraud developments.
[33:41.080 --> 33:45.640]  I mean, I've got all the news here, I've got the video clips, I've got the left sexually
[33:45.640 --> 33:46.640]  grooming your children.
[33:46.640 --> 33:51.240]  I mean, it's all here.
[33:51.240 --> 33:54.840]  And I'll cover all of it today.
[33:54.840 --> 34:01.320]  But see, it really just all comes down to an understanding that people need to have
[34:01.320 --> 34:12.560]  and a worldview that you may not like, but you have to accept it because it's the reality.
[34:12.560 --> 34:19.040]  We have a current state of affairs on this planet where the, I don't even, you can call
[34:19.040 --> 34:26.160]  them the elite, but truly not even that, you can talk about the satanic sex cults or the
[34:26.160 --> 34:28.040]  satanic death cults and all that stuff.
[34:28.040 --> 34:37.480]  But what it comes down to, and this has been recorded throughout modern human history since
[34:37.480 --> 34:40.160]  the founding of this country, I mean, George Washington would write his journals about
[34:40.160 --> 34:43.720]  the Illuminati and Sheikah societies and all this stuff.
[34:43.720 --> 34:50.040]  But as the world evolves, so do these secret societies and so do other factions that want
[34:50.040 --> 34:52.840]  to compete with them.
[34:52.840 --> 34:58.280]  But at the end of the day, call it whatever you want, the Illuminati, secret societies,
[34:58.280 --> 35:00.960]  shadow government.
[35:00.960 --> 35:08.640]  These groups of people have reached intellectual conclusions that if you're a deep thinker,
[35:08.640 --> 35:14.680]  if you're an intellectual person, if you're a logician, we'll say, you've had these same
[35:14.680 --> 35:18.440]  patterns of thought and you may have reached different conclusions, you may have reached
[35:18.440 --> 35:22.080]  the same conclusions, but you may have a heart, you may have a soul, you may have a Christian
[35:22.080 --> 35:29.760]  ethos or some other religious ethos that makes you have love instead of hate and believe
[35:29.760 --> 35:33.360]  in good instead of evil and believe in a creator and that's the ultimate power, that's the
[35:33.360 --> 35:37.840]  be all end all, not you or whatever humans do on this planet.
[35:37.840 --> 35:42.080]  But see, this group of elite don't go off of that logic.
[35:42.080 --> 35:48.200]  They don't believe in divine creation or your divine existence.
[35:48.200 --> 35:55.120]  Instead, they look at the planet like it's a business.
[35:55.120 --> 36:00.920]  The best analogy I could make for you to try to understand this mindset, and this may go
[36:00.920 --> 36:07.320]  over many people's heads, but for me, we grew up with video games like SimCity.
[36:07.320 --> 36:12.200]  Or, basically, these games that just simulate life in some form and you're in charge of
[36:12.200 --> 36:16.400]  a city or you're in charge of a civilization or something and you have to make decisions
[36:16.400 --> 36:19.360]  to make sure the civilization blossoms or whatever.
[36:19.360 --> 36:22.640]  The point is, that's how they look at the planet.
[36:22.640 --> 36:28.960]  The whole planet is a commodity to them and the daily operations or yearly operations
[36:28.960 --> 36:35.440]  or whatever on the planet are of major concern or cause to them, so if they think that there's
[36:35.440 --> 36:39.280]  too many humans on earth, then they're going to try to call the population.
[36:39.280 --> 36:42.680]  If they think there's a limited amount of resources and they want them for themselves
[36:42.680 --> 36:47.920]  to sustain themselves or their bloodlines or their lineage or their secret groups, then
[36:47.920 --> 36:52.760]  they're going to make sure that you're not consuming those resources.
[36:52.760 --> 36:58.240]  So when you understand that mindset, which I don't know if I'm properly presenting, but
[36:58.240 --> 37:02.720]  when you understand that mindset and you look at the world through that perspective, you
[37:02.720 --> 37:07.400]  understand the globalist so much better, you understand their operating procedure, you
[37:07.400 --> 37:17.680]  understand their motives, and when you tie that into the response to COVID or the whole
[37:17.680 --> 37:23.920]  entire story of COVID, it actually makes sense.
[37:23.920 --> 37:31.200]  Now why do I use the movie Dallas Buyers Club as a prospectus on how to understand this?
[37:31.200 --> 37:37.080]  Because you watch that movie and you would say, huh, because just like with COVID, it
[37:37.080 --> 37:43.160]  was the same story, it's like, huh, so we have an AIDS epidemic going on, we have drugs
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.400]  that we know help people that have AIDS, help extend their life, give them a higher quality
[37:47.400 --> 37:52.120]  of life, and then we have these drugs over here that are getting pushed by the FDA that
[37:52.120 --> 37:57.120]  people in high places have investments in that are killing all the AIDS patients, we're
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.480]  going to go with that drug instead, and you would say, well, why the heck would that be
[38:01.480 --> 38:03.680]  going on?
[38:03.680 --> 38:05.880]  That doesn't make any sense.
[38:05.880 --> 38:14.000]  No, you see, it does make sense when you look at the planet as a commodity of yours with
[38:14.000 --> 38:23.680]  scarce resources and a growing consumer base that you need to call.
[38:23.680 --> 38:27.680]  And so there's a certain level of evil to it, and quite frankly, there's a certain level
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.440]  of survival of the instincts and humanity to it.
[38:32.440 --> 38:36.240]  I'm not promoting this idea, I'm just telling you how they think.
[38:36.240 --> 38:46.040]  So in their minds, their logic, their reasoning is, if you're running around and you're engaging
[38:46.040 --> 38:54.040]  in sodomy and you're getting AIDS because of your gay sex, then you deserve to die.
[38:54.040 --> 39:00.360]  You deserve to die, and we're going to give you a drug that's going to kill you even faster
[39:00.360 --> 39:03.800]  because you've made those life decisions.
[39:03.800 --> 39:09.280]  And so that's how they feel morally about it in this black magic that they engage in,
[39:09.280 --> 39:16.160]  is, hey, you chose this lifestyle, now you chose to come to us for help, we're going
[39:16.160 --> 39:18.520]  to kill you.
[39:18.520 --> 39:20.000]  That happened in the 80s.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.840]  Now you've got COVID, the exact same story.
[39:22.840 --> 39:25.960]  Now maybe AIDS was made in the lab just like COVID?
[39:25.960 --> 39:26.960]  I don't know.
[39:26.960 --> 39:28.600]  I'm not here to have that discussion.
[39:28.600 --> 39:32.400]  I've seen the arguments before.
[39:32.400 --> 39:37.000]  In fact, I think it was Will Smith even, guys, look that up.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.960]  Will Smith actually said at one point in time that AIDS was made in a lab.
[39:41.960 --> 39:44.040]  That's just an old memory that popped up in my head.
[39:44.040 --> 39:46.160]  Will Smith claimed AIDS was made in a lab.
[39:46.160 --> 39:48.320]  So I'm not here to make that argument.
[39:48.320 --> 39:51.280]  We know COVID was made in a lab.
[39:51.280 --> 39:59.040]  We know that the treatment that was promoted by Fauci and others was deadly with the Remdesivir
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.960]  and with the blowing your lungs out on a ventilator and now with the vaccines.
[40:02.960 --> 40:04.160]  All those things are deadly.
[40:04.160 --> 40:09.600]  So you've got to understand, in their mind, it's like an IQ test.
[40:09.600 --> 40:16.840]  So maybe it's not a moral test of are you going to go out and engage in sodomy and anal
[40:16.840 --> 40:20.400]  sex which is a bad life choice.
[40:20.400 --> 40:21.400]  No judgment here.
[40:21.400 --> 40:23.920]  I mean, it's just true.
[40:23.920 --> 40:27.960]  And they say, okay, well, you're going to die for that decision.
[40:27.960 --> 40:32.880]  Well now it's, oh, if you're dumb enough to get a vaccine, if you're dumb enough to go
[40:32.880 --> 40:36.500]  to the hospital and get put on a ventilator in Remdesivir and you're not going to do any
[40:36.500 --> 40:39.600]  of your research into this, then you deserve to die.
[40:39.600 --> 40:40.920]  And that's how they look at it.
[40:40.920 --> 40:44.560]  And they have no qualms in this mindset.
[40:44.560 --> 40:50.760]  Why do you think they operate with such confidence when they launch these operations?
[40:50.760 --> 40:57.080]  Because in their eyes, from their perspective, their worldview, they're doing a good thing.
[40:57.080 --> 40:59.480]  They're saving the planet from sodomites.
[40:59.480 --> 41:02.840]  They're saving the planet from people that are too stupid that will go put something
[41:02.840 --> 41:03.840]  in their arms.
[41:03.840 --> 41:08.320]  Like that lady said from the NAACP, I'm not learning about the infusion, I don't care
[41:08.320 --> 41:11.640]  what's in the infusion, I'm just going to take the infusion.
[41:11.640 --> 41:14.880]  Well that's stupid, that's death.
[41:14.880 --> 41:17.800]  So they think, okay, you believe that, you're going to die.
[41:17.800 --> 41:23.080]  Yeah, Will Smith launches homophobic anti-age rant in unheard footage.
[41:23.080 --> 41:27.120]  He actually guys, he went on 60 minutes, I think it was in the 90s with Leslie Stahl,
[41:27.120 --> 41:29.240]  I think it was.
[41:29.240 --> 41:32.040]  I don't remember who it was, but he went on 60 minutes and they brought it up, they're
[41:32.040 --> 41:34.240]  like, so do you believe age was made in a lab?
[41:34.240 --> 41:37.800]  And he basically refused to answer the question, meaning he probably still believes that, but
[41:37.800 --> 41:39.320]  didn't want to say it on 60 minutes.
[41:39.320 --> 41:45.040]  I mean it was Barbara Walters actually, I forget who it was.
[41:45.040 --> 41:48.520]  It was Barbara Walters, thank you crew.
[41:48.520 --> 41:57.640]  So you have to understand this is the world that you live in.
[41:57.640 --> 42:04.640]  And in their eyes, people that believe they own this planet, probably been in power for
[42:04.640 --> 42:11.800]  generations of bloodlines, generations, generations, dating back centuries, who knows, even millennia.
[42:11.800 --> 42:17.480]  In their eyes, they really think they're doing a good thing, and maybe they're really worshiping
[42:17.480 --> 42:22.040]  Satan or thinking they're getting messages from Satan, maybe it's total demonic possession.
[42:22.040 --> 42:24.400]  That's their logic.
[42:24.400 --> 42:27.520]  You're on a lifeboat in space called Planet Earth.
[42:27.520 --> 42:30.560]  There's not enough room and resources for everybody.
[42:30.560 --> 42:34.440]  And so they're gonna, they're gonna be the protectors of this planet and they're gonna
[42:34.440 --> 42:38.260]  call the population and they're gonna keep it as they say in the Georgia guide stones
[42:38.260 --> 42:41.360]  at a permissible human population of 500 million.
[42:41.360 --> 42:44.520]  Now I don't believe any of that.
[42:44.520 --> 42:48.960]  God made this planet, God made this life, God made this experience.
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.560]  His will will be done and we've got plenty of space for everybody, but see that's how
[42:52.560 --> 42:53.560]  the globalists think.
[42:53.560 --> 42:57.160]  So just understand, when you see Dallas Buyers Club and what they do for COVID, yeah, they
[42:57.160 --> 43:00.040]  want you dead, folks.
[43:00.040 --> 43:08.320]  In December of 2021, InfoWars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[43:08.320 --> 43:11.600]  Coin, and it sold out in 10 days.
[43:11.600 --> 43:16.160]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[43:16.160 --> 43:19.560]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[43:19.560 --> 43:24.920]  Now the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered and it will probably sell
[43:24.920 --> 43:26.960]  out in 10 days again.
[43:26.960 --> 43:29.440]  It certainly needs to, it's under operation.
[43:29.440 --> 43:34.480]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[43:34.480 --> 43:38.360]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more.
[43:38.360 --> 43:42.360]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[43:42.360 --> 43:44.600]  It's also at infostore.com.
[43:44.600 --> 43:48.920]  It's amazing, there's only 10,000 of them and as a founding member, if we're able to
[43:48.920 --> 43:54.040]  stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps
[43:54.040 --> 43:55.400]  us go to the next level.
[43:55.400 --> 43:59.560]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[43:59.560 --> 44:02.000]  So I did it.
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.160]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[44:04.160 --> 44:08.840]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[44:08.840 --> 44:10.840]  and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[44:10.840 --> 44:17.040]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need to
[44:17.040 --> 44:18.040]  get going.
[44:18.040 --> 44:22.760]  You know, besides the energy Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin
[44:22.760 --> 44:28.360]  C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[44:28.360 --> 44:31.200]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[44:31.200 --> 44:34.840]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[44:34.840 --> 44:37.160]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[44:37.160 --> 44:41.800]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[44:41.800 --> 44:44.200]  support and extra flexibility.
[44:44.200 --> 44:48.760]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[44:48.760 --> 44:53.440]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, Turbo Force that can
[44:53.440 --> 44:57.480]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you
[44:57.480 --> 45:00.320]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[45:00.320 --> 45:05.720]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[45:05.720 --> 45:07.760]  a healthier life.
[45:07.760 --> 45:11.600]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[45:11.600 --> 45:13.240]  that contains both.
[45:13.240 --> 45:18.200]  This info wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[45:18.200 --> 45:19.760]  from the info wars store.
[45:19.760 --> 45:24.560]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[45:24.560 --> 45:27.280]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[45:27.280 --> 45:32.120]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[45:32.120 --> 45:36.800]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[45:36.800 --> 45:37.800]  shown.
[45:37.800 --> 45:42.120]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.680]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[45:46.680 --> 45:51.800]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[45:51.800 --> 45:52.800]  like here in America.
[45:52.800 --> 45:57.620]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise
[45:57.620 --> 46:00.200]  our rose hips don't lie.
[46:00.200 --> 46:07.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarsstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20
[46:07.240 --> 46:13.400]  year history and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding,
[46:13.400 --> 46:19.560]  the supply chains have broken down and infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll
[46:19.560 --> 46:24.200]  and paying for operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the
[46:24.200 --> 46:26.320]  globalist making their main move.
[46:26.320 --> 46:30.240]  Infowars is paradoxical, it is more popular than ever, it is reaching more people than
[46:30.240 --> 46:35.360]  ever despite the censorship but because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure
[46:35.360 --> 46:39.680]  and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[46:39.680 --> 46:46.280]  So listen, up to 75% off at infowarsstore.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that
[46:46.280 --> 46:52.040]  help spread the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films, everything
[46:52.040 --> 46:58.120]  is 25 to 75% off right now, the biggest sell in our history at infowarsstore.com.
[46:58.120 --> 47:00.520]  Thank you for your support.
[47:00.520 --> 47:28.880]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer is about to take over again in a moment and
[47:28.880 --> 47:33.280]  he's got some special guests, a lot of news and of course your phone calls coming up here
[47:33.280 --> 47:38.280]  today, really appreciate Owen sitting in and doing a fabulous job here on the main infowarshow.
[47:38.280 --> 47:43.080]  Of course you can tune into his extremely informative and powerful transmission, weekdays
[47:43.080 --> 47:49.480]  3pm central and that is the war room with Owen Schreuer and another very important broadcast,
[47:49.480 --> 47:53.920]  weekday mornings with Harrison Smith, American Journal, also has a lot of great guests and
[47:53.920 --> 48:00.040]  just amazing analysis by Harrison Smith so please continue to spread the word about that.
[48:00.040 --> 48:05.160]  We are massively censored, we are massively de-platformed but because of listeners and
[48:05.160 --> 48:10.320]  viewers with human intelligence, you've been able to overpower the censors in the last
[48:10.320 --> 48:16.160]  four years and infowars has become the model and the standard of resistance and victory
[48:16.160 --> 48:22.120]  against the deep state of persevering so thank you and I mean that from the bottom of my
[48:22.120 --> 48:29.920]  heart for helping us all persevere together through what's happening now I don't want
[48:29.920 --> 48:33.920]  to talk about this subject and I know listeners are sick of hearing about it but it's very
[48:33.920 --> 48:40.520]  important to the big picture and to your life and to what the future of our country and
[48:40.520 --> 48:45.520]  the world is going to be like if we don't become aware of this so sit back for a moment
[48:45.520 --> 48:52.840]  and think as you're tuning into the Alex Jones show here today, why would you have to be
[48:52.840 --> 49:01.200]  living in a cave to not hear about Alex Jones every day in the news being demonized?
[49:01.200 --> 49:02.200]  Why is that happening?
[49:02.200 --> 49:03.600]  Why do they hate me so much?
[49:03.600 --> 49:06.800]  And why is their main tool of demonization against me?
[49:06.800 --> 49:13.480]  Not that I'm a racist like they use on mainline Republicans and conservatives, no, no, that
[49:13.480 --> 49:19.000]  I'm a horrible person because I ask questions about big events that start wars.
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.160]  I popularize the term false flag that's been around for hundreds of years.
[49:24.160 --> 49:31.200]  I get people to look at things closely in question and that's why I'm the big bad wolf.
[49:31.200 --> 49:35.280]  If you look at what's happening in Ukraine, obviously the Russians are doing bad stuff.
[49:35.280 --> 49:37.200]  Obviously the Ukrainians are doing bad stuff.
[49:37.200 --> 49:38.200]  It's a war.
[49:38.200 --> 49:39.200]  It's terrible.
[49:39.200 --> 49:40.700]  It's horrible.
[49:40.700 --> 49:46.000]  The footage has poured out that's been proven to be fake by the Ukrainian side.
[49:46.000 --> 49:54.240]  We've not really caught the Russians doing any type of fake stunts or fake massacres
[49:54.240 --> 49:58.480]  because I think the Russians know that they're not sophisticated enough to get away with
[49:58.480 --> 49:59.960]  it.
[49:59.960 --> 50:05.080]  The Ukrainians have a very sophisticated movie propaganda system.
[50:05.080 --> 50:07.720]  Even mainstream media has talked about Zelensky's propaganda machine.
[50:07.720 --> 50:11.120]  He's been an actor all his life.
[50:11.120 --> 50:16.160]  They've been caught staging all these fake massacres and these fake events and now when
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.760]  you hear them talk, you don't know whether they're telling the truth or not.
[50:20.760 --> 50:26.560]  They have been caught using famous actors from Ukraine in battle scenes as victims over
[50:26.560 --> 50:27.560]  and over again.
[50:27.560 --> 50:32.720]  They've been caught using what's basically movie sets with Russian tanks they've captured
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.600]  to stage other events and claim that, oh, look, there's all these dead people on the
[50:36.600 --> 50:40.040]  street and they're actors, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:40.040 --> 50:41.040]  There's no blood.
[50:41.040 --> 50:42.040]  They're not even rotting.
[50:42.040 --> 50:44.920]  They supposedly have been dead there for weeks.
[50:44.920 --> 50:47.520]  We're not saying there aren't real people being killed.
[50:47.520 --> 50:52.640]  We're not saying this isn't really terrible that Putin invaded, in my view, but it's even
[50:52.640 --> 50:56.840]  worse that NATO started the fight to lure Russia in.
[50:56.840 --> 51:02.040]  What I'm saying is it's our birthright and its common sense to be able to question the
[51:02.040 --> 51:09.080]  Gulf of Tonkin or question WMDs in Iraq or question anthrax and Colin Powell to UN and
[51:09.080 --> 51:16.560]  to question Jesse Smollett and Bubba Wallace and almost all these hate crimes against black
[51:16.560 --> 51:23.680]  people that turn out to be completely staged by leftists to, again, politically make everybody
[51:23.680 --> 51:26.920]  guilty and to follow their directive.
[51:26.920 --> 51:35.440]  So when you see in the news on Fox and CNN and ABC News every day, and I mean, I can't
[51:35.440 --> 51:39.960]  even go to CNN's website without seeing articles every day demonizing me, you've got to ask
[51:39.960 --> 51:47.400]  why that is, because they want everybody else out there to be scared to question events.
[51:47.400 --> 51:52.160]  They want everybody else out there to think that little people can't question official
[51:52.160 --> 51:56.360]  narratives, going back to the case with Ukraine and Russia.
[51:56.360 --> 51:59.000]  I said that I thought Russia was probably going to invade.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.920]  I also thought China was going to invade Taiwan because that information had been leaking
[52:02.920 --> 52:05.800]  out and the Chinese government said that they might do it.
[52:05.800 --> 52:11.400]  I think they're watching first, though, to see what Russia does.
[52:11.400 --> 52:19.840]  And I famously, of course, back in October of last year made the prediction that by February
[52:19.840 --> 52:21.000]  that would happen.
[52:21.000 --> 52:26.240]  And then we saw Vladimir Putin lie and say that he wasn't going to invade while he
[52:26.240 --> 52:28.440]  was massing troops.
[52:28.440 --> 52:32.560]  Now that's not him staging a false flag, that's not him staging dead bodies or massacres,
[52:32.560 --> 52:37.720]  but that's him lying and saying I'm not going to invade so that when he invaded he had the
[52:37.720 --> 52:38.720]  element of surprise.
[52:38.720 --> 52:45.080]  Again, it's okay to question Putin and just say I'm just not going to believe what he
[52:45.080 --> 52:47.040]  officially says.
[52:47.040 --> 52:52.880]  But we're told by the US media, don't believe anything Putin says, but believe everything
[52:52.880 --> 52:59.760]  our media says when they have a much worse track record of Vladimir Putin when it comes
[52:59.760 --> 53:00.760]  to lying.
[53:00.760 --> 53:05.320]  So again, the most valuable thing we have is questioning narratives and not buying what
[53:05.320 --> 53:07.320]  we're officially told.
[53:07.320 --> 53:10.200]  Now we have Biden running around saying he wants war crimes.
[53:10.200 --> 53:15.600]  He wants escalated military hardware sent against Russia because of supposed massacres
[53:15.600 --> 53:16.600]  in this town.
[53:16.600 --> 53:21.520]  And we have articles on infowords.com and the videos that clearly show a lot of this
[53:21.520 --> 53:22.520]  is fake.
[53:22.520 --> 53:24.920]  Plus remember the ghost of Kiev wasn't real.
[53:24.920 --> 53:27.600]  Remember the Snake Island massacre wasn't real.
[53:27.600 --> 53:31.760]  And it's okay to point out that that's those are lies.
[53:31.760 --> 53:36.320]  Now sometimes we're going to question events and they're going to turn out to be real.
[53:36.320 --> 53:38.200]  We've seen that with mass shootings.
[53:38.200 --> 53:41.960]  But it's okay and it's healthy to question those things.
[53:41.960 --> 53:46.920]  But that's why you see it all over the news that Alex Jones is the worst person on earth
[53:46.920 --> 53:52.240]  because the idea of someone questioning the establishment is the ultimate crime when it's
[53:52.240 --> 53:53.680]  the bedrock of freedom.
[53:53.680 --> 53:57.840]  The ability to say two plus two equals four is freedom.
[53:57.840 --> 54:02.480]  George Arwell was right when he wrote that and it's still true today.
[54:02.480 --> 54:08.920]  Everyone watching or listening to this broadcast today instinctively knows there's not hundreds
[54:08.920 --> 54:14.560]  of articles demonizing Alex Jones today and scores of TV programs on every major channel
[54:14.560 --> 54:19.480]  saying he's a horrible bad person because it's really all just about Alex Jones.
[54:19.480 --> 54:21.480]  It's about you.
[54:21.480 --> 54:24.120]  They want to demonize the common man, the common woman.
[54:24.120 --> 54:30.560]  They want to demonize populist movements and they see info wars and our operation as the
[54:30.560 --> 54:34.640]  example of the folk hero, of the little guy standing up.
[54:34.640 --> 54:38.560]  And so they can take something I've done in my past questioning a shooting here at Sandy
[54:38.560 --> 54:43.180]  Hook, exaggerate it, lie about it and then demonize me.
[54:43.180 --> 54:45.520]  People don't even remember Adam Lanz's name.
[54:45.520 --> 54:50.680]  They remember Alex Jones and they come up to me on the street and they say you killed
[54:50.680 --> 54:53.240]  those kids or leave those kids alone.
[54:53.240 --> 54:56.760]  And then now the lawyers up here, Democratic Party lawyers are basically under the command
[54:56.760 --> 54:59.480]  of Senator Blumenthal.
[54:59.480 --> 55:06.360]  They are openly saying that, oh, we're going to show his shopping cart and now he made more
[55:06.360 --> 55:08.440]  money on Sandy Hook days.
[55:08.440 --> 55:11.520]  By the way, how were we defaulted?
[55:11.520 --> 55:15.520]  When we gave them all that and then they say they have nothing and now they want to double
[55:15.520 --> 55:20.800]  default where they have a trial where I'm guilty already defaulted, a trial where you're already
[55:20.800 --> 55:25.600]  guilty just deciding how guilty and now a trial where we can't talk or put on evidence
[55:25.600 --> 55:27.880]  to show that they weren't damaged.
[55:27.880 --> 55:29.960]  You understand how that works?
[55:29.960 --> 55:35.320]  So literal show trials at a level where the other side can't talk, where the defendants
[55:35.320 --> 55:38.320]  can't talk and can't even defend themselves.
[55:38.320 --> 55:42.800]  Oh yes, you're guilty, but now you can't defend yourself on how you're not as guilty as they
[55:42.800 --> 55:46.160]  say you are, you're not this horrible villain.
[55:46.160 --> 55:49.640]  They are stealing your birthright of a fair trial.
[55:49.640 --> 55:54.600]  They're destroying the Eighth Amendment against cruel, unusual punishment and excessive fines.
[55:54.600 --> 56:00.080]  They are raping everyone's birthright right now and it is a triangle of a corrupt judiciary
[56:00.080 --> 56:06.000]  with a corrupt corporate media system and lawyers that are part of that whole tryout
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  of control.
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.840]  And this is a case point test example they admit on MSNBC and other channels to take
[56:12.840 --> 56:15.720]  Tucker Carlson and everybody else off air.
[56:15.720 --> 56:20.800]  The idea that you sell products and that you're lying on air to sell the products is just
[56:20.800 --> 56:23.000]  absolutely insane.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.720]  You tell the truth on air, people know you tell the truth, you have a big audience, then
[56:26.720 --> 56:31.320]  you sell products that people want and need, that's a totally separate deal.
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.720]  I am talk radio on TV, that's our model.
[56:35.720 --> 56:39.160]  But again, they're selling the idea that when anybody that's populist or anybody that's
[56:39.160 --> 56:45.160]  conservative or Christian has their own outlet, has their own economy, has their own listeners
[56:45.160 --> 56:49.080]  and their own financial ecosystem, that that's the ultimate sin.
[56:49.080 --> 56:52.960]  And that came out in Clinton documents a few years ago when the Western Journalism Center
[56:52.960 --> 56:55.360]  sued and got them out of their federal papers.
[56:55.360 --> 56:59.680]  It was a Clinton's when they first got elected in 1993 saying our main mission is shutting
[56:59.680 --> 57:04.080]  down conservative ecosystems that are selling VHS tapes and books.
[57:04.080 --> 57:07.760]  We've got to silence them or they're going to form their own ecosystem and their own
[57:07.760 --> 57:11.040]  economy and then the populist will take America back.
[57:11.040 --> 57:12.040]  And that's what this is.
[57:12.040 --> 57:18.200]  These are globalist dictators, world economic forum tyrants that have penetrated our governments,
[57:18.200 --> 57:23.000]  put their people into control and now they don't want a peaceful political uprising of
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.720]  the populist that question them and remove them.
[57:25.720 --> 57:26.720]  Well, guess what?
[57:26.720 --> 57:30.920]  They failed and we're never going to be silenced and the people are awakening and humanity
[57:30.920 --> 57:35.560]  will come together and we will have peace and we will have justice and we will bring
[57:35.560 --> 57:36.840]  the criminals to justice.
[57:36.840 --> 57:38.040]  God bless and good luck.
[57:38.040 --> 57:44.040]  Hour number two coming up.
[57:44.040 --> 57:57.040]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three part Founder Series at 1776coin.com
[57:57.040 --> 58:02.920]  and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty Thomas Jefferson quote must be watered
[58:02.920 --> 58:04.920]  with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[58:04.920 --> 58:05.920]  It's a coin I designed.
[58:05.920 --> 58:09.840]  I'm very, very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible.
[58:09.840 --> 58:14.960]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[58:14.960 --> 58:16.240]  we sold it.
[58:16.240 --> 58:21.920]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly and I appreciate listeners getting
[58:21.920 --> 58:22.920]  over half of them now.
[58:22.920 --> 58:25.040]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[58:25.040 --> 58:29.720]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days and without the last coin
[58:29.720 --> 58:33.360]  sale we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[58:33.360 --> 58:35.440]  We've had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem.
[58:35.440 --> 58:39.600]  So it was a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom
[58:39.600 --> 58:42.520]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[58:42.520 --> 58:49.360]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776coin.com.
[58:49.360 --> 58:54.200]  The newest product from Fowler's Life is now available exclusively at infowarsdoor.com.
[58:54.200 --> 58:59.840]  It is concentrated known herbs and compounds that will supercharge your body's natural
[58:59.840 --> 59:04.920]  defenses, your immune system, all at the same time, fun in the infowar.

[59:51.120 --> 1:00:07.240]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:20.520]  Now you can't say with 100% certainty that if the election wasn't stolen from Donald
[1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:24.400]  Trump and the American people in 2020 that the situation in Ukraine wouldn't be happening
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:34.480]  but what we can say with 100% certainty is that the last two times Biden has been in
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:41.080]  the White House Russia has invaded Ukraine that is a fact.
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:47.480]  Now remember when they first started peddling the fake PP gate dossier the Hillary Clinton
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:52.800]  paid for opposition research fake PP dossier.
[1:00:52.800 --> 1:01:04.480]  The claim at the time was that Russia had blackmail on Trump, Russia was controlling
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:14.640]  Trump because of said blackmail and the blackmail was the alleged PP gate Trump dossier which
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:19.800]  was all made up in fact it may have actually been actually a Hunter Biden story that they
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:25.560]  just said was Trump instead probably maybe the case folks that it was actually a Hunter
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:32.160]  Biden or Joe Biden story that they just did a Indiana Jones switch and just put Trump's
[1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:37.960]  name in it instead that it was going to be used to get Biden out of the out of the race
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:42.040]  and it was actually the New York Times that was reporting that Hillary Clinton had dirt
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:46.840]  on Biden that the Clinton campaign was going to release that was going to cause Biden to
[1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:51.920]  drop out of the race well he dropped out they never released it then all of a sudden the
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:56.360]  PP gate Trump dossier came out which was totally fake we now know it.
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:03.240]  So the last two times Biden's been in the White House Russia has invaded Ukraine that
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:05.720]  is undeniable.
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:09.440]  Now again can I say with confidence that if Trump was in the White House it wouldn't happen
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:15.160]  well I can say that with confidence is it 100% certain maybe not 100% certain but it's
[1:02:15.160 --> 1:02:23.680]  about as close as you can get now why do I say that well why doesn't Democrat liberal
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:30.360]  logic ever get applied equally because it's not logic it's propaganda.
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:38.400]  So if said tape existed against Donald Trump that would cause Trump to be compromised by
[1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:49.120]  the Russians well then what does Hunter Biden's laptop equal ah ah now it would be very reasonable
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:57.200]  to assume not just the Hunter Biden laptop that we've seen or that we know about then
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:01.940]  there's the second Hunter Biden laptop that got stolen from him by Russian or Ukrainian
[1:03:01.940 --> 1:03:06.220]  drug dealers where we have a phone conversation that leaked of Hunter Biden saying he was
[1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:12.000]  concerned because these drug dealers in Ukraine maybe they're Russian maybe they're Ukraine
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:17.080]  stole one of his laptops that had sensitive information on it and after what we've seen
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:21.880]  from the laptop I think we have an idea what kind of sensitive information that is.
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:30.120]  So who's to say given the Democrat liberal logic from 2015 and 2016 who's to say that
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:36.000]  Biden is not the one being controlled by Russia right now and if you look at how the geopolitical
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:43.400]  picture has changed since Biden has been in office well it really shakes out with that
[1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:49.960]  logic doesn't it Russia has never been more relevant as a world power Russia has never
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:54.480]  been thrust to the top of the geopolitical power structure in such a short time as they
[1:03:54.480 --> 1:04:04.240]  have since Biden got into office and now we're looking at a situation where gas natural gas
[1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:10.800]  transactions are going to be made in ripples and not the US dollar and we're just looking
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:15.260]  around the corner at that being the future.
[1:04:15.260 --> 1:04:20.400]  So please to all the Democrats and the Libs and the media out there that said Trump was
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:24.000]  going to be compromised and controlled by Russia for the PP gate dossier which we now
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:31.560]  know is fake tell me where is your logic where is your fair and balanced coverage using that
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:38.680]  same conclusion towards the Hunter Biden laptop story oh see it doesn't exist because
[1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:44.360]  your liars your frauds your phonies now we're going to get into the latest situation in
[1:04:44.360 --> 1:04:49.600]  Ukraine with my guest coming up independent journalist Jacob Creech who's been breaking
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:54.280]  a lot of news when it comes to the bio labs the Russian strikes on the bio labs and the
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:05:02.960]  Biden involvement in the bio labs.
[1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:27.160]  First coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days now the second coin
[1:05:27.160 --> 1:05:36.000]  go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty tree coin it is powerful witness

[1:05:53.200 --> 1:06:07.840]  air and also gives you a real piece of history at 1776coin.com the answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:28.400]  your listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Owen shroyer well you know
[1:06:28.400 --> 1:06:34.640]  all you liberal democrats out there that want to stop the war in Ukraine well you could
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:39.800]  have done that by stopping Biden from getting into office but you let him steal the election
[1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:43.800]  and so now you're dealing with the consequences.
[1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:50.720]  You know it's just so outrageous I'm watching I don't even know what I was watching last
[1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:56.600]  night I was watching something on television non non political maybe sports or like a movie
[1:06:56.600 --> 1:07:04.600]  or TV show or something and I don't usually it's just full on news on my TV's all day
[1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:09.760]  but I'm just I'm sick of looking at the left destroying America 24 seven so I've been trying
[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:17.520]  to just divert my attention with sports and comedy and stuff and then it's little pictures
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:22.840]  or pictures of little kids in Ukraine and this is like on all the networks it's like
[1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:31.040]  comedy central ESPN ABC who's ever broadcasting the men's college basketball tournament and
[1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:37.280]  I see the same stuff all these different groups that would raise money for Africa raise money
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:41.840]  for Jews or raise money for this and raise money for that all of them are now raising
[1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:48.000]  money for Ukraine and they're all showing you the plight of the Ukrainian people and
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.920]  then they have pictures of little Ukrainian kids up there you know saying they're starving
[1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:58.680]  they need your help they need your money they need your support and I'm just sitting there
[1:07:58.680 --> 1:08:04.760]  and I'm just watching this and it's just stunning when you when you've put on the glasses when
[1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:09.000]  you've put on or when you've taken the red pill and you see this stuff it just it hits
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:14.600]  so much different and you realize most of the people probably watching this tuned in
[1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:19.680]  to watch a comedy event or tuned in to watch a college basketball game have no clue what's
[1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:25.120]  going on and they just see this propaganda and it's just like oh wow really bad in Ukraine
[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:31.720]  wow you know maybe they give a little money maybe just the propaganda hits home but it's
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:39.640]  just you sit there and you look back at it you're like wow these organizations have been
[1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:49.240]  running these scams yes scams for years that's all it is and and and again it's like the
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:53.400]  same thing with the hospital I don't want to come on air and be anti hospital I don't
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:58.840]  want to be anti doctor that's like the last thing I want to be but I'm going to tell it
[1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:07.120]  like it is you get COVID you go to the hospital you're asking to die you got one of these doctors
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:14.760]  promoting the the death shot yeah I'd avoid that doctor I'd avoid that hospital does that
[1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:18.680]  make me feel good that I'm telling you you can't trust our health institutions no that
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:25.520]  sucks so it's the same thing with all these charities that just pop up and the latest
[1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:30.560]  the latest cause the latest craze the latest trend they fundraise for it and you know the
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:37.920]  only reason they do that is because they're making millions and millions of dollars and
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:42.040]  because think about it why would they pay millions of dollars for advertising unless
[1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:46.520]  they were set to make millions of dollars and they've already come out with all these
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:53.000]  groups CEOs like the Red Cross and what's the other big one it's like Gateway or something
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.200]  they sponsor the NFL they've already come out they're all making buku dollars the CEOs
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:03.200]  all of them making millions of dollars tiny tiny fraction of your donation like 10% actually
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:12.360]  goes to the cause and it's just scam after scam after scam and I'm just sitting here
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:17.000]  like I'm trying to watch a bat I'm trying to watch a basketball game and I'm get boom
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:23.400]  COVID propaganda boom gay propaganda boom Ukraine propaganda and this is just all in
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:31.640]  a two three minute break and it just sucks like just the propaganda is everywhere and
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:37.920]  you have to fully remove yourself from the establishment from the corporate establishment
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:41.600]  you have to fully remove yourself otherwise you're just sitting there consuming this propaganda
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:45.560]  all day long and that's the problem is most people here are just tuning in to watch a
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:53.440]  ball game and they have no I clue they have no clue they are just getting bombarded with
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:59.560]  propaganda the entire time even when the game's on with all the black lives matter stuff people
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:03.720]  wearing blue and yellow for Ukraine I mean this is during the game then you go to the
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:10.080]  break and again it's you're gay your kids are gay everyone's gay give money to Ukraine
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:18.560]  it's just it's nonstop with it so we've got Jacob Creech on air with us he's an independent
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:23.360]  journalist he's been the tip of the spear on many of the breaking stories revolving
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:30.280]  around the bio labs in Ukraine the Biden involvement and the Russian attacks on said bio lab so
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:35.080]  I bring Jacob in now Jacob just what is the beginners course for this what is kind of
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:41.440]  the introductory course to the bio labs in Ukraine the Biden involvement and the Russian
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:50.760]  assault on them yes oh and thanks for having me on kind of for starters the US DOD does
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:56.680]  have a biological threat reduction program in Ukraine with which they tried to cover
[1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:01.640]  up excessively once I started kind of breaking the news I wasn't the first one to know about
[1:12:01.640 --> 1:12:06.200]  bio labs in Ukraine I was the first one to make the connection that the Ukrainians excuse
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:14.520]  me the Russians were moving into Ukraine to attack and or take over these bio labs due
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:20.160]  to the fact that they have been accusing United States of creating biological weapons and
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:26.200]  doing dangerous research on pathogens in these labs in Ukraine so I was kind of censored
[1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:31.960]  and heavily attacked for bringing all this information to the forefront and since since
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:36.880]  then all the information has come out to support everything that I have been pushing with which
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:41.480]  the Russians are moving into Ukraine to attack bio facilities in the United States or excuse
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:45.640]  me in Ukraine which was funded by the United States Department of Justice excuse me Department
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:53.760]  of Defense now what is the involvement with Rosemont Seneca or one of these other Biden
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:59.720]  shell corporations that they launder money out of what what's the involvement there yes
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:06.560]  so this information was brought forth actually from the Russian military to the United Nations
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:13.880]  it was presented that there was connections between Hunter Biden the DNC via his investment
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:21.480]  firm Rosemont Seneca to funnel US DOD funds into one of their own bio labs that they own
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:26.920]  in Ukraine known as a metabiota and there's so much more digging to be done in that situation
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:33.360]  what in what research metabiota is digging into and creating genome specific pathogens
[1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:38.800]  to attack nationalities and races so you can understand why Russia might be a little bit
[1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:43.640]  upset about that but yes Hunter Biden and the Kerry family as well as the Pelosi family
[1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:49.920]  and the Romney family all have family members sitting on the board of Rosemont Seneca involved
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:58.080]  in this funneling of US funds into US bio labs in Ukraine I want to get back to those names
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:02.760]  but I want to know if you've noticed this pattern too and if there's if there's something
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:10.440]  significant about this why was Barack Obama so intent on having all these bio labs weapons
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:15.560]  going or bio labs going whether he knew they were for weapons or not I guess you could
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:20.880]  say he didn't know but it was Obama that made sure when the lab in North Carolina was shut
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:24.880]  down that all that research got sent to the Wuhan lab in China it was one of the last
[1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:29.320]  things they did in the Obama administration to make sure that there was more funding into
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:34.280]  Ukraine not just for neo-nazis but for these bio labs what is the Obama connection with
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:40.480]  that is it significant or is that just something he happened to be there and oversee well I
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:45.440]  would definitely say that it's significant given the fact that in 2005 Obama along with
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:52.360]  one other senator was sent to Ukraine to observe and in place the biological threat reduction
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:59.480]  program so there's definitely a connection there and the fact that they made sure to
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:07.000]  do this on Obama's way out was kind of sketchy in the sense that the deep state was utilizing
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:12.200]  these locations in Ukraine to circumvent US congressional oversight to conduct their
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:21.440]  black site activities and create pathogens with increased lethality and transmissibility
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:26.360]  so I would definitely say there's a connection there given the deep state and the activity
[1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:31.800]  and Obama being smack dab in the middle of all of this he most certainly played a part
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:39.000]  in creating and generating this opportunity for the deep state to create these pathogens
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:44.960]  like I said outside of the scope of US congressional oversight so yeah there's definitely a connection
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:50.480]  there I can't necessarily confirm any direct involvement like I can with the hunter Biden
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:57.640]  Pelosi's carries and Romney's so let's pick it up there on the other side of this break
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:03.600]  we are only offering three coins in the series the first coin was released in December of

[1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:16.960]  April 2022 is now being offered and I believe it will sell out in just a few days again

[1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:38.920]  it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mothership promoting the pro
[1:17:38.920 --> 1:17:44.560]  human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars

[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:11.320]  as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against their
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:18.440]  transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is really right now hitting the most

[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:25.880]  incredible tyranny everything we've talked about is now coming true and the globalist
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:31.560]  want to take us off air ladies and gentlemen we are running the biggest sale in the history

[1:19:56.440 --> 1:20:05.120]  at cost leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:32.240]  we're talking about the bio labs in ukraine and and and really jacob i think that if we
[1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:37.200]  understand this story we understand so much of the geopolitical corruption specifically
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:42.080]  that that the american government officials are involved in we know that there's corruption
[1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:47.160]  all over the planet but we got to clean up our own front yard first before we point fingers
[1:20:47.160 --> 1:20:53.560]  at others and so we were discussing the clear obama involvement of all this i mean literally
[1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:57.200]  from the time he got into the senate in the early 2000s to the time he left the white
[1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:03.520]  house in 2016 he was all over bio labs in ukraine china everything but was he directly
[1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:09.320]  involved or these just projects he was overseeing you could have the debate but with polosi romney
[1:21:09.320 --> 1:21:14.480]  carry biden and their family members there is direct involvement there are receipts it's
[1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:20.080]  all on paper the media won't cover it so so let's talk about that and and how this really
[1:21:20.080 --> 1:21:26.960]  shows the overall geopolitical corruption that our politicians are involved in yeah absolutely
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:31.080]  so what's really going on here is these these major political families are utilizing their
[1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:40.000]  family members as proxies to carry out their black site operations to like i said circumvent
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:46.640]  oversight from their constitutional bodies with which are supposed to govern these activities
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:52.720]  so for example the reason why we do this research in ukraine is because it's illegal
[1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:57.440]  here in the united states and it's also much easier to cover up these kinds of things if
[1:21:57.440 --> 1:22:01.560]  they're being taken or they're taking place in ukraine as opposed to the u.s. so these
[1:22:01.560 --> 1:22:08.280]  families are utilizing their own investment firms in their own biological research facilities
[1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:13.200]  which why do politicians own biological research facilities in other countries let alone our
[1:22:13.200 --> 1:22:20.040]  own countries what the hell they're doing if you are willing to believe that it's benevolent
[1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:24.160]  in any manner than your ignorant it's 100% nefarious there's no reason why they would
[1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:28.440]  want to do this other than to get their hands into something with which they could use to
[1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:35.000]  enact control on the population so yes our u.s. politicians are utilizing corrupt methods
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:42.320]  quasi legal and legal methods to create pathogens to attack certain nationalities and genome
[1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:47.600]  specific sequences and the russians found out about it the russians went to war for
[1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:54.680]  it the russians moved into ukraine for it and the media and the left-wing media complex
[1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:59.640]  has gone to extreme lengths to cover this up with which has now been proven to be 100%
[1:22:59.640 --> 1:23:04.880]  true to include victoria newland confirming about these biolabs in ukraine and being
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:08.880]  concerned about the russians getting their hands on the information and the research
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:14.440]  they were conducting of course that was newland confirming that in congress under oath while
[1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:19.000]  gensaki was saying that they don't exist in the same hour so that just shows how they
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  lie to us but i am curious i mean what is the motive here for the poloses the romneys
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:29.880]  that carries the bidens to get involved in these labs i mean the obvious reason would
[1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:35.960]  be money but i mean is there some sort of anti russian sentiment that they carry i mean
[1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:41.720]  are they making a bunch of money i mean what's their real motive here do you think well now
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:47.120]  you're asking me to imply intent which i can't prove and legally can get me into trouble
[1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:52.320]  but i can infer as to what i think is going on and i don't really care if they seek legal
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:57.760]  action against me bring it on these people are well let's start with the reason why
[1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:03.840]  russia is mad about it is because the russians have put forth information showing that we
[1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:11.320]  were conducting research specifically asking for dna and mrna samples of white russians
[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:16.120]  so the russians believe that we are creating biological weapons specifically designed to
[1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:23.720]  target their people with which is why putin came on and said that he had to invade ukraine
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:31.000]  to neutralize a threat with which was a threat to his population and his people so is it
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:35.760]  just about money i i really don't believe so there's so many other avenues of which
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:42.560]  these people just just destroy and utilize our us taxpayer dollars as their slush fund
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:48.520]  to enrich themselves which they could do that strictly just from the their inside inside
[1:24:48.520 --> 1:24:55.000]  trading they don't necessarily need to have bio labs in ukraine just for money it's nefarious
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.440]  and given the fact that cova just happened and given the fact that they're now admitting
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:05.040]  that it came from a lab it's it's pretty cut and dry as to what's happening here and if
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:10.640]  you can't see it i can't help you but there are corrupt politicians creating pathogens
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:15.120]  and they're getting out while i'm ruining the world yeah and and you just said it right
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:20.720]  there it's pretty obvious what's going on any any neutral observer seeing this can can
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:25.400]  say whether you like russia hate russia think rush is the good guy or the bad guy you cannot
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:30.160]  deny these bio labs were there you cannot deny that that's a dangerous threat there's a reason
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:34.360]  why they shut them down in america you cannot deny that it was a similar bio lab that caused
[1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:39.200]  a covert outbreak whether you think it was intentional or not so so i guess then the
[1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:46.400]  next question is for these individuals getting involved in this i mean is there some sort
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:51.000]  of agreement like hey we have to be anti russia is it a protection against russia do they
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:56.840]  did i mean or i guess the better question is this because we don't know their motives
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:01.120]  how about the medias motive why is the media so interested in covering this information
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:06.080]  up they fall for fake news all the time they give themselves awards for covering fake news
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:10.320]  like the the trump russian collusion or dossier which never happened they give themselves awards
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:17.360]  for that why the blatant cover up of this story do you think well one hundred percent
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:23.720]  i can confirm as to why this is is because the realization that we are conducting nefarious
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:28.320]  and or questionable research in different countries and bio labs across the world will
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:35.200]  eventually lead us to the confirmation that the usnih created coveted and either let it
[1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:40.560]  out or it escaped you're welcome to believe whichever one you like i believe it's quite
[1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:46.000]  obvious as to which one that is um so the reason why they're covering up is because
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.400]  as soon as we get back to the fact that they created coveted the entire narrative of everything
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:54.640]  they've been covering for years completely collapses they tried to cover up the fact
[1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:59.120]  that coveted came from a lab in wuhan they said it came from a bat and some peasant
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:04.880]  eating bat soup and they which leads to all the other crimes they committed such as covering
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:11.360]  up viable treatments for the bio weapon they released in order to enable emergency use
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:16.800]  authorization for their vaccines that didn't work and were neither help for harm excuse
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:23.080]  me were neither safe nor effective um and it leads back to the fact that they infringed
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:29.040]  on the nineteen seventy two bio weapons convention which is agreed upon by all but four nations
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:36.240]  in the world with which you cannot stockpile or create biological weapons so the reason
[1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:39.240]  why the media is so help in uncovering all this up and making sure that everything is
[1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:46.360]  pushed pro ukraine the reason why they made the entire country support a literal nazi
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:51.000]  military installation in ukraine just because it's not the russians is all to cover up the
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:56.400]  fact that they created coveted they let it out and they utilized it to implement a medical
[1:27:56.400 --> 1:28:04.320]  police state on the entire world jacob creche is our guest bio clandestine dot substack
[1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:09.720]  dot com is where you can follow his great news coverage he's been on this since day one folks
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:14.640]  and when we come back from this break jacob i want to get into more of what's going on
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:19.720]  in ukraine because my biggest problem is i want to know how you deal with this my biggest
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:25.120]  problem is whenever i go and i try to look for the latest news coming out of ukraine
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:29.280]  it's literally two there's literally two sides to every story oh that's russians torturing
[1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:33.720]  ukrainians no that's ukrainians torturing russians and it's the same video two completely
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:39.480]  separate takes so my question for you when we come back jacob is how do you differentiate
[1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:45.320]  what's real and what's fake how do you differentiate if it's a ukrainian army or a russian army
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:49.440]  or do you just kind of say hey look there's no way for me to be completely positive so
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:53.880]  i'm just going to cover what i know for fact jacob creche coming back on the other side
[1:28:53.880 --> 1:29:11.320]  of this break
[1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:39.380]  of

[1:31:57.540 --> 1:32:02.020]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to malcom in tennessee. Welcome. Hello, alex
[1:32:02.100 --> 1:32:06.820]  Yes, malcom. All right. I will make this quick and real short where the other patricks can get on the line
[1:32:07.140 --> 1:32:11.380]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-host oan shroyer
[1:32:11.940 --> 1:32:17.220]  Supermail volatility and brain force plus mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank
[1:32:17.220 --> 1:32:23.940]  Supermail volatility really really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up
[1:32:24.100 --> 1:32:29.700]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[1:32:29.780 --> 1:32:34.820]  But just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. It's it's it's in fact each batch is different
[1:32:34.900 --> 1:32:40.500]  Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes if the batch isn't strong
[1:32:40.580 --> 1:32:42.580]  That's just how it is. It's how it works
[1:32:42.580 --> 1:32:46.820]  Uh, so it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong
[1:32:46.900 --> 1:32:50.820]  But yeah, if you want the rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it
[1:32:50.820 --> 1:33:15.460]  Clearly you don't need to start selling rolls towards a small price even though we've got
[1:33:15.460 --> 1:33:25.320]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is The Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:33.020]  We got one more segment here with Jacob Preach and you know, I've seen the American media's
[1:33:33.020 --> 1:33:40.060]  wag the dog technique for years now and it's very apparent with the Ukraine situation.
[1:33:40.060 --> 1:33:42.820]  The media sets a narrative, the brainwashed public goes along with it.
[1:33:42.820 --> 1:33:49.140]  Now, I don't want to be on the opposite side of that but yet still being in a wag the dog
[1:33:49.140 --> 1:33:53.820]  situation where whenever I see the mainstream media or the American media covering something
[1:33:53.820 --> 1:33:58.140]  or forcing a talking port or a narrative, I just assume it's fake because in a way that's
[1:33:58.140 --> 1:34:03.140]  me being wagged by the dog as well, even if that is probably the best way to approach
[1:34:03.140 --> 1:34:04.140]  the situation.
[1:34:04.140 --> 1:34:09.020]  But Jacob, I'm sure you're having the same problems or rather frustrations that I'm
[1:34:09.020 --> 1:34:14.180]  having where there's videos, there's reports, there's all this stuff and it's literally
[1:34:14.180 --> 1:34:15.580]  two sides to every story.
[1:34:15.580 --> 1:34:18.020]  Hey, that's Russians torturing Ukrainians.
[1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:20.140]  Hey, that's Ukrainians torturing Russians.
[1:34:20.140 --> 1:34:22.380]  Same video, two different stories.
[1:34:22.380 --> 1:34:29.020]  So how do you try to sort through all the propaganda, all the wag the dog to try to find out what's
[1:34:29.020 --> 1:34:33.060]  really going on in Ukraine with all the headlines and the videos coming out?
[1:34:33.060 --> 1:34:36.260]  What's your technique or what advice do you give to people that are trying to follow this
[1:34:36.260 --> 1:34:37.260]  story?
[1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:44.340]  Well, for starters, I definitely agree with your sentiment with if it's coming from the
[1:34:44.340 --> 1:34:50.900]  mainstream media in the Western media complex, there's a good chance based on recent proof
[1:34:50.900 --> 1:34:52.060]  that they are lying.
[1:34:52.060 --> 1:34:56.460]  So that's the reason why I started looking into the biolab situation in Ukraine was because
[1:34:56.460 --> 1:35:01.900]  during the initial airstrikes, I figured this out within about three hours.
[1:35:01.900 --> 1:35:07.940]  They were pushing that it was all from Donetsk and Crimea in the East, yet there were random
[1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:13.740]  individuals, airstrikes going on in locations all the way in Lviv, in the West, in Kiev,
[1:35:13.740 --> 1:35:14.740]  in the capital.
[1:35:14.740 --> 1:35:17.740]  So immediately I knew what they were telling me wasn't right.
[1:35:17.740 --> 1:35:21.180]  And that carries on with all these videos and such.
[1:35:21.180 --> 1:35:27.060]  You can go back to the Snake Island and the Ghost of Kiev and all the nonsense stories,
[1:35:27.060 --> 1:35:31.420]  the bombing of the maternity ward, which wasn't true and was actually overtaken by Nazis
[1:35:31.420 --> 1:35:34.980]  utilizing that as a foreign operating base.
[1:35:34.980 --> 1:35:39.420]  But the way I go about it is I know for a fact, if it's coming from the TVs, a good
[1:35:39.420 --> 1:35:40.660]  chance that it's a lie.
[1:35:40.660 --> 1:35:43.620]  So I have to compile all the facts that I can to the best of my knowledge.
[1:35:43.620 --> 1:35:47.220]  When it comes to interpreting the videos and such, to be quite frank, I don't pay attention
[1:35:47.220 --> 1:35:48.220]  to any of those videos.
[1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:54.020]  It's so easy to stage those, easy to stage fake bodies, chemical attacks, like the actor
[1:35:54.020 --> 1:36:00.180]  that got caught in the gas explosion that they tried to push as also being bombed by
[1:36:00.180 --> 1:36:01.180]  Putin.
[1:36:01.180 --> 1:36:02.900]  It's just impossible to confirm any of that.
[1:36:02.900 --> 1:36:11.340]  So I only deal with the facts that I can verify via documentation, like I did with the Ukrainian
[1:36:11.340 --> 1:36:16.140]  Biolabs as I found the source material on the US Gov sites.
[1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:19.780]  So I just find stuff that I can prove and verify.
[1:36:19.780 --> 1:36:23.660]  But when it comes to videos and stuff going on in Ukraine, you have to have a discerning
[1:36:23.660 --> 1:36:28.300]  eye and understand that we really don't know what's going on over there and it is a propaganda
[1:36:28.300 --> 1:36:33.220]  war, US versus Russia, and to be quite frank, I don't know who to believe, who I should
[1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:36.020]  believe or why I should believe either side.
[1:36:36.020 --> 1:36:37.220]  Well said.
[1:36:37.220 --> 1:36:42.660]  And an example would be the most recent video that I'm seeing all over the news, Fox News,
[1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:47.500]  CNN, MSNBC, they're all playing the same one where it's an individual with a camera
[1:36:47.500 --> 1:36:51.020]  walking down the street and there's a dead body here, a dead body there.
[1:36:51.020 --> 1:36:52.540]  And I mean, they zoom in.
[1:36:52.540 --> 1:36:54.980]  It's like they show you the body, they zoom into the blood.
[1:36:54.980 --> 1:36:59.020]  I mean, it's like, so clearly there's a narrative they're trying to push there.
[1:36:59.020 --> 1:37:03.620]  And again, it's like, I don't want to be the one that just doubts everything I see on TV
[1:37:03.620 --> 1:37:05.740]  at the risk of being considered a lunatic.
[1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:06.900]  But again, it's the same problem.
[1:37:06.900 --> 1:37:12.020]  It's like, I know they've staged videos, we've seen them stage videos in Syria and other
[1:37:12.020 --> 1:37:16.180]  places where they have people in body bags and they start moving around or they sneeze
[1:37:16.180 --> 1:37:17.180]  during the film.
[1:37:17.180 --> 1:37:21.260]  And it's like, oh, hey, we got to reshoot this fake dead guy scene or like videos where
[1:37:21.260 --> 1:37:26.700]  they show Ukrainians supposedly doing minesweeps and the cameraman is in front of the guy doing
[1:37:26.700 --> 1:37:27.700]  it.
[1:37:27.700 --> 1:37:30.420]  So he's going to get blown up and that's, so I mean, there's obvious stuff that you
[1:37:30.420 --> 1:37:31.420]  can tell it's fake.
[1:37:31.420 --> 1:37:33.140]  Then there's other stuff that's nuanced.
[1:37:33.140 --> 1:37:39.420]  But I guess my question is this because it was not too long ago, 10, 20 years ago, whether
[1:37:39.420 --> 1:37:43.380]  it's the babies and incubator moment or all this other stuff where when the American media
[1:37:43.380 --> 1:37:48.700]  would show something like a bunch of dead bodies on the streets in Ukraine, all of America
[1:37:48.700 --> 1:37:52.300]  would jump and say, this is awful, we have to do something about this.
[1:37:52.300 --> 1:37:54.900]  It seems to me America is less sensitive to this now.
[1:37:54.900 --> 1:37:58.340]  Specifically, let's say the Fox News audience for obvious reasons.
[1:37:58.340 --> 1:38:01.460]  Most Fox News audience doesn't even trust Fox News, but they just at least consider it
[1:38:01.460 --> 1:38:06.380]  more fair and balanced than anything else they're going to see where usually they would
[1:38:06.380 --> 1:38:10.900]  show all these videos of dead people and it'd be like knee jerk, we're going to war.
[1:38:10.900 --> 1:38:14.260]  It doesn't seem to have the impact that it's had in years past.
[1:38:14.260 --> 1:38:15.660]  Would you agree with that?
[1:38:15.660 --> 1:38:20.700]  Yeah, that's an excellent point and that just goes to prove that now more than ever there
[1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:24.500]  is less trust in the media than there has ever been.
[1:38:24.500 --> 1:38:31.460]  That is due to the fact that we as a citizen intelligence apparatus have massively expanded
[1:38:31.460 --> 1:38:36.500]  in our reach and our ability to provide a counter narrative to just the absolute nonsense
[1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:38.860]  that they've been pushing us for years.
[1:38:38.860 --> 1:38:43.980]  I give credit to this to social media and the fact that we have a voice even despite
[1:38:43.980 --> 1:38:50.060]  and all of the censorship and deep platforming, we're still able to get this message out and
[1:38:50.060 --> 1:38:54.020]  now more than ever people are listening to citizens as opposed to what's coming through
[1:38:54.020 --> 1:38:55.020]  the news.
[1:38:55.020 --> 1:38:58.460]  So yes, I agree with you 100% that the people to be quite frank, I don't know if I'm allowed
[1:38:58.460 --> 1:38:59.460]  to curse on your show.
[1:38:59.460 --> 1:39:00.460]  We're not buying the BS anymore.
[1:39:00.460 --> 1:39:03.780]  We're just not buying it and we're going to figure it out on our own and we're not listening
[1:39:03.780 --> 1:39:06.500]  to a single word anyone's got to say about it.
[1:39:06.500 --> 1:39:12.820]  I'm hearing mixed conclusions just from going through the waterfront of media.
[1:39:12.820 --> 1:39:14.340]  I'm hearing mixed conclusions.
[1:39:14.340 --> 1:39:16.660]  Some people think this war will be over in a couple months.
[1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:18.700]  Some people think it will be years.
[1:39:18.700 --> 1:39:22.860]  I tend to believe it's going to be years because that's what the West wants.
[1:39:22.860 --> 1:39:24.180]  That's what the Biden regime wants.
[1:39:24.180 --> 1:39:25.740]  They want this war to go on forever.
[1:39:25.740 --> 1:39:27.180]  It helps their stock portfolio.
[1:39:27.180 --> 1:39:28.820]  It helps the weapons manufacturers.
[1:39:28.820 --> 1:39:33.980]  It helps them have a scapegoat on all the problems going on in America and the world.
[1:39:33.980 --> 1:39:36.580]  So the West to me wants this to go on as long as possible.
[1:39:36.580 --> 1:39:38.260]  I don't think that's what Russia wants.
[1:39:38.260 --> 1:39:40.380]  I think Russia has a pretty clear agenda here.
[1:39:40.380 --> 1:39:44.500]  De-nazify, get rid of the biolabs, get rid of the Western corruption.
[1:39:44.500 --> 1:39:49.980]  But knowing all this, weighing all this, how long do you think this war is set to go on?
[1:39:49.980 --> 1:39:54.780]  How much resistance can Ukraine really put forth over a long period of time?
[1:39:54.780 --> 1:39:58.220]  Or will Russia eventually just be spun out?
[1:39:58.220 --> 1:40:04.780]  I'm going to go ahead and confirm for you right now that anything going on in Ukraine
[1:40:04.780 --> 1:40:08.500]  is 100% at the mercy of Russia.
[1:40:08.500 --> 1:40:13.420]  Any of these narratives that are trying to say that Ukraine is standing up to Russia,
[1:40:13.420 --> 1:40:14.420]  that is simply not the case.
[1:40:14.420 --> 1:40:17.660]  Russia is operating under a specific set of rules and engagement.
[1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:20.420]  If they wanted to flatten Ukraine, they could have done that in the first week.
[1:40:20.420 --> 1:40:23.700]  They could have completely leveled the entire country, moved in, taken over, slaughtered
[1:40:23.700 --> 1:40:26.540]  all the civilians, and we wouldn't have any questions about it.
[1:40:26.540 --> 1:40:31.060]  But they're conducting a specific military operation as per Putin and their Russian military.
[1:40:31.060 --> 1:40:38.180]  So they're acting in a diplomatic fashion and they presented these things through the proper
[1:40:38.180 --> 1:40:43.700]  diplomatic channels, through the UN, accusing the US of creating biological weapons on their
[1:40:43.700 --> 1:40:45.180]  border.
[1:40:45.180 --> 1:40:48.620]  So honestly, this is entirely up to Russia.
[1:40:48.620 --> 1:40:52.100]  Russia hasn't really advanced any farther in the media, doesn't really seem to want
[1:40:52.100 --> 1:40:53.100]  to talk about that.
[1:40:53.100 --> 1:40:55.900]  They just want to keep showing you all these dead bodies and such.
[1:40:55.900 --> 1:41:03.580]  But Russia has been rather reserved, in a sense, as opposed to this dictatorial narrative
[1:41:03.580 --> 1:41:05.260]  they've painted on Putin.
[1:41:05.260 --> 1:41:07.860]  But it's entirely up to Russia.
[1:41:07.860 --> 1:41:09.940]  Whenever Russia wants to end this, they will end it.
[1:41:09.940 --> 1:41:13.300]  Whenever Russia feels like they have neutralized the threat which they view as a threat to
[1:41:13.300 --> 1:41:15.980]  their people, they'll stop.
[1:41:15.980 --> 1:41:21.260]  Quickly, what is your just view of Zelensky?
[1:41:21.260 --> 1:41:30.500]  Well, he's a former actor and he's clearly either in control of or loyal to the globalists.
[1:41:30.500 --> 1:41:35.500]  I don't know if he's an actor for good forces that's just playing a part to take down the
[1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:41.220]  deep state, or if he's just a complete rat that obviously is under control of the deep
[1:41:41.220 --> 1:41:42.220]  state.
[1:41:42.220 --> 1:41:46.060]  I do not know, but I know he's acting and he's playing a role and he's not really any
[1:41:46.060 --> 1:41:50.700]  sort of militaristic or presidential force in Ukraine.
[1:41:50.700 --> 1:41:54.540]  He's controlled via proxies via the NATO in the U.S.
[1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:56.700]  Jacob Creech, great interview.
[1:41:56.700 --> 1:41:57.900]  We thank you for joining us.
[1:41:57.900 --> 1:42:01.180]  Tell people where they can follow you and get all this information.
[1:42:01.180 --> 1:42:06.940]  Yes, so as you know, I've probably been de-platformed everywhere, but I'm currently operating on
[1:42:06.940 --> 1:42:07.940]  Telegram.
[1:42:07.940 --> 1:42:11.460]  You can find my channel at Bioclindestine on Telegram.
[1:42:11.460 --> 1:42:16.700]  My sub-stack where you can get my newsletter is bioclindestine.substack.com.
[1:42:16.700 --> 1:42:19.860]  And I just recently got on the true social, I'm still on the waiting list.
[1:42:19.860 --> 1:42:23.460]  You can find me at clandestine on true social.
[1:42:23.460 --> 1:42:25.740]  Jacob Creech, excellent breakdown.
[1:42:25.740 --> 1:42:30.340]  Great work there with Bioclindestine, and we thank you for joining us here today.
[1:42:30.340 --> 1:42:31.340]  Of course, Owen.
[1:42:31.340 --> 1:42:32.340]  Thank you so much.
[1:42:32.340 --> 1:42:33.340]  I appreciate it.
[1:42:33.340 --> 1:42:34.340]  All right, there goes Jacob Creech.
[1:42:34.340 --> 1:42:35.340]  And you heard him, folks.
[1:42:35.340 --> 1:42:36.340]  I mean, he gets de-platformed.
[1:42:36.340 --> 1:42:39.940]  If you don't go along with the mainstream narrative, if you do your own investigative
[1:42:39.940 --> 1:42:44.460]  research and you put out facts that the globalists don't want out there on their social media
[1:42:44.460 --> 1:42:47.060]  platforms, they remove you.
[1:42:47.060 --> 1:42:51.340]  But we're glad that Jacob was able to come on air with us today and speak his mind.
[1:42:51.340 --> 1:42:54.500]  We like people to get banned by the corrupt establishment.
[1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:57.780]  That's a good sign.
[1:42:57.780 --> 1:43:02.340]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm upragging when I say it, it's just true, that InfoWars
[1:43:02.340 --> 1:43:10.380]  is seen by the globalists as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[1:43:10.380 --> 1:43:15.060]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[1:43:15.060 --> 1:43:21.900]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[1:43:21.900 --> 1:43:22.900]  done.
[1:43:22.900 --> 1:43:27.780]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at
[1:43:27.780 --> 1:43:28.780]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:43:28.780 --> 1:43:34.020]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you, and so now we need to support more
[1:43:34.020 --> 1:43:36.700]  than ever because this fight has intensified.
[1:43:36.700 --> 1:43:40.300]  Don't need me to tell you that at InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:43:40.300 --> 1:43:44.300]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[1:43:44.300 --> 1:43:48.660]  These have been sold out for a long time, like InfoWarsLife, Fizzy Magnesium Mix that's
[1:43:48.660 --> 1:43:53.140]  so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[1:43:53.140 --> 1:43:57.940]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at InfoWarsTour.com right now.
[1:43:57.940 --> 1:44:02.620]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[1:44:02.620 --> 1:44:07.980]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalists on the other,
[1:44:07.980 --> 1:44:11.300]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:44:11.300 --> 1:44:16.060]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[1:44:16.060 --> 1:44:19.740]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:44:19.740 --> 1:44:25.180]  That's why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of Build
[1:44:25.180 --> 1:44:26.940]  Back Better.
[1:44:26.940 --> 1:44:32.940]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy, and because
[1:44:32.940 --> 1:44:37.220]  they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is
[1:44:37.220 --> 1:44:42.540]  the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon
[1:44:42.540 --> 1:44:43.540]  on us.
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:47.500]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:44:47.500 --> 1:44:48.500]  It's that simple.
[1:44:48.500 --> 1:44:52.940]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine
[1:44:52.940 --> 1:44:56.140]  released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history.
[1:44:56.140 --> 1:45:02.260]  Expose this paradigm, and we win.
[1:45:02.260 --> 1:45:03.260]  Randy Dewright.
[1:45:03.260 --> 1:45:04.260]  Randy Dewright.
[1:45:04.260 --> 1:45:05.260]  Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[1:45:05.260 --> 1:45:06.260]  Go ahead.
[1:45:06.260 --> 1:45:08.700]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:45:08.700 --> 1:45:14.220]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[1:45:14.220 --> 1:45:19.700]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or H-spots, as they're lovingly called.
[1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:24.940]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[1:45:24.940 --> 1:45:25.940]  actually.
[1:45:25.940 --> 1:45:29.020]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:45:29.020 --> 1:45:33.060]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:45:33.060 --> 1:45:37.340]  what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[1:45:37.340 --> 1:45:42.340]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started
[1:45:42.340 --> 1:45:48.500]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:53.900]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully,
[1:45:53.900 --> 1:45:58.180]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:45:58.180 --> 1:46:02.940]  April 2022 just kicked off, and it's already been incredible.
[1:46:02.940 --> 1:46:09.220]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, they, along with many other new order operatives,
[1:46:09.220 --> 1:46:15.620]  have gone on national television and announced that we are now under a world government.
[1:46:15.620 --> 1:46:20.580]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit, and
[1:46:20.580 --> 1:46:23.340]  they are announcing incredible tyranny.
[1:46:23.340 --> 1:46:27.100]  Everything we've talked about is now coming true, and the globalists want to take us off
[1:46:27.100 --> 1:46:28.100]  air.
[1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:33.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of Info Wars right now.
[1:46:33.820 --> 1:46:39.380]  In our 28 years, all Info Wars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is
[1:46:39.380 --> 1:46:43.980]  gone, and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps at Info Wars flags
[1:46:43.980 --> 1:46:44.980]  again.
[1:46:44.980 --> 1:46:48.020]  We may have t-shirts and apparel in the future, but I don't even know.
[1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.140]  We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[1:46:51.140 --> 1:46:56.140]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at infowarstore.com right
[1:46:56.140 --> 1:46:57.140]  now.
[1:46:57.140 --> 1:46:58.540]  That's at cost.
[1:46:58.540 --> 1:47:26.300]  Thank you.
[1:47:28.540 --> 1:47:36.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final 2,000.
[1:47:36.020 --> 1:47:37.700]  In fact, it's going to be less than that.
[1:47:37.700 --> 1:47:40.380]  That was the number as of this morning.
[1:47:40.380 --> 1:47:49.580]  We're now under 2,000 of our limited edition number two coin in the set of three tree of
[1:47:49.580 --> 1:47:53.260]  Liberty coin at infowarstore.com.
[1:47:53.260 --> 1:48:00.100]  You go to the store front, you click on the image that we have there of the limited edition
[1:48:00.100 --> 1:48:07.700]  coin, and that will take you to 1776 coin or Patriot Collectibles to purchase your limited
[1:48:07.700 --> 1:48:10.980]  edition, which we also now have on sale.
[1:48:10.980 --> 1:48:14.060]  Originally it was 150, now 130.
[1:48:14.060 --> 1:48:23.260]  This pure silver coin is a limited edition run, less than 2,000 left, and it is an investment.
[1:48:23.260 --> 1:48:30.220]  Now, yes, silver is a precious metal that a lot of people think is being synthetically
[1:48:30.220 --> 1:48:35.260]  kept down, the price of it, that is, by the central banks, but no, I'm not talking about
[1:48:35.260 --> 1:48:41.140]  making an investment in precious metals or silver here, though there is an inherent value.
[1:48:41.140 --> 1:48:45.500]  You're investing in free speech, you're investing in free press, you're investing in keeping
[1:48:45.500 --> 1:48:47.060]  infowars on the air.
[1:48:47.060 --> 1:48:53.700]  That's the investment that you make when you purchase the limited edition tree of Liberty
[1:48:53.700 --> 1:48:57.260]  silver coin from infowarstore.com.
[1:48:57.260 --> 1:49:02.180]  And I got to tell you, folks, because, look, I'm human just like anybody else.
[1:49:02.180 --> 1:49:06.540]  I can have a range of emotions like anybody else a lot of times that pours out here on
[1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:07.540]  the air.
[1:49:07.540 --> 1:49:14.020]  But let me just tell you, I want to have a moment here with this crew and this audience
[1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:20.300]  to celebrate and say, we're still here.
[1:49:20.300 --> 1:49:22.060]  That is a victory.
[1:49:22.060 --> 1:49:26.300]  So free speech is not dead yet in this country.
[1:49:26.300 --> 1:49:33.980]  And when you go and you invest in the second set of three limited edition silver coins from
[1:49:33.980 --> 1:49:38.740]  infowarstore.com, you're keeping us alive, you're keeping free speech alive.
[1:49:38.740 --> 1:49:39.980]  So yeah, you know what?
[1:49:39.980 --> 1:49:45.220]  Free speech in America right now is bloody, it's battered, it's bruised, it's got limbs
[1:49:45.220 --> 1:49:50.020]  blown off, it's it's gimping up and down just trying to just trying to move with a crutch
[1:49:50.020 --> 1:49:54.300]  that's also been blown up, but it's not dead yet.
[1:49:54.300 --> 1:49:59.700]  And we're still fighting for it and you're and you're and you're hoisting it up.
[1:49:59.700 --> 1:50:02.640]  Infowars as an example of free speech.
[1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:04.740]  So we appreciate that.
[1:50:04.740 --> 1:50:08.140]  And it is this coin that's going to fund us for the next couple months.
[1:50:08.140 --> 1:50:11.940]  And then just selling out of everything we have on the website is we're basically just
[1:50:11.940 --> 1:50:13.340]  looking to get the funds in, folks.
[1:50:13.340 --> 1:50:17.860]  And it's, I mean, we really don't know what's going to go down with the legal stuff.
[1:50:17.860 --> 1:50:20.820]  That's always kind of a mystery, except that we know they just want to destroy us and that's
[1:50:20.820 --> 1:50:21.940]  why they do it.
[1:50:21.940 --> 1:50:30.860]  Folks, I'll tell you, you know, Alex is a little more transparent, I'll say, with some
[1:50:30.860 --> 1:50:34.140]  of the legal stuff and you still really only get the tip of the iceberg.
[1:50:34.140 --> 1:50:39.100]  But man, oh, man, let me tell you, if and when all this is behind us, there are going
[1:50:39.100 --> 1:50:42.100]  to be stories to tell.
[1:50:42.100 --> 1:50:51.340]  I mean, I got something that happened to me yesterday morning that is just insane.
[1:50:51.340 --> 1:50:54.100]  Just insane.
[1:50:54.100 --> 1:50:59.300]  But I'm not going to say on air and I'm going to withhold it and and eventually, you know,
[1:50:59.300 --> 1:51:02.460]  I imagine eventually this stuff's going to be behind us and it might not go well, but
[1:51:02.460 --> 1:51:04.700]  it'll eventually be behind us.
[1:51:04.700 --> 1:51:11.460]  And we'll tell the stories and I mean, look, I'm dealing with, we're dealing with, you're
[1:51:11.460 --> 1:51:18.340]  dealing with full on authoritarian, tyrant style censorship and attack on free speech
[1:51:18.340 --> 1:51:20.140]  in this country.
[1:51:20.140 --> 1:51:24.100]  But together, we're still here, we're still on air, we're still getting the great guests,
[1:51:24.100 --> 1:51:26.440]  we're still breaking the news and information.
[1:51:26.440 --> 1:51:28.340]  And so that alone is a victory.
[1:51:28.340 --> 1:51:32.700]  So I salute you in the audience, I salute this crew and we will continue to fight for
[1:51:32.700 --> 1:51:37.420]  truth and freedom in America using our free speech to do it until they rip our larynx
[1:51:37.420 --> 1:51:40.780]  out, put a bullet through us, through our head or throw us in a prison.
[1:51:40.780 --> 1:51:43.900]  And believe me, they're considering all three.
[1:51:43.900 --> 1:51:49.740]  But man, oh man, I'll tell you, when all this is behind us, whether for good or bad, it's
[1:51:49.740 --> 1:51:55.380]  just the stories that Alex and myself and others are going to be able to tell.
[1:51:55.380 --> 1:52:01.340]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, it's just mind blowing, because I really, I mean, obviously
[1:52:01.340 --> 1:52:04.500]  you got to have an ego to talk to yourself on air for three hours a day.
[1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:07.900]  I'm not denying I have a massive ego here, but like, I don't really think of myself as
[1:52:07.900 --> 1:52:10.380]  that big of a deal.
[1:52:10.380 --> 1:52:14.800]  I think the world will turn just fine without me, whether I'm here or not.
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:18.700]  But then you go through the crap that we're going through here and you're like, wow, I
[1:52:18.700 --> 1:52:26.200]  mean, boy, they really want me gone, like they really hate little old me.
[1:52:26.200 --> 1:52:29.260]  And it's just, it's just wild.
[1:52:29.260 --> 1:52:31.020]  But I'm going to leave it right there.
[1:52:31.020 --> 1:52:36.260]  Just know, I mean, you're seeing a little maybe more than the tip of the iceberg just
[1:52:36.260 --> 1:52:40.420]  because of the recent stuff getting into the news and Alex being a little bit more transparent
[1:52:40.420 --> 1:52:43.020]  about some of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes here.
[1:52:43.020 --> 1:52:47.060]  But just overall, you're seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the attack info
[1:52:47.060 --> 1:52:51.020]  wars is under, regardless, you've kept us on air.
[1:52:51.020 --> 1:52:52.460]  Quite frankly, you're a miracle.
[1:52:52.460 --> 1:52:53.820]  You're our lifeblood.
[1:52:53.820 --> 1:52:55.260]  And we thank you for it.
[1:52:55.260 --> 1:52:57.740]  So we're trying to sell out of everything at infowarstore.com.
[1:52:57.740 --> 1:53:00.660]  That's why all the t-shirts and apparel is on sale at cost.
[1:53:00.660 --> 1:53:06.540]  That's why we're selling the supplements top rated supplements at a discounted price at
[1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:08.620]  infowarstore.com.
[1:53:08.620 --> 1:53:09.860]  We just want to be here, folks.
[1:53:09.860 --> 1:53:11.740]  I don't need a million dollars.
[1:53:11.740 --> 1:53:20.620]  Okay, this platform right here, this ability to come on air and talk to you is worth trillions
[1:53:20.620 --> 1:53:21.620]  of dollars to me.
[1:53:21.620 --> 1:53:25.300]  There's no amount of money that could ever fulfill that.
[1:53:25.300 --> 1:53:28.340]  There's no amount of money that could ever match that.
[1:53:28.340 --> 1:53:29.860]  Okay?
[1:53:29.860 --> 1:53:31.980]  So I thank you.
[1:53:31.980 --> 1:53:33.340]  I don't need to be a millionaire.
[1:53:33.340 --> 1:53:34.500]  I don't need gobs of money.
[1:53:34.500 --> 1:53:36.060]  I don't need a bunch of big fancy houses.
[1:53:36.060 --> 1:53:37.060]  Yeah, that's nice.
[1:53:37.060 --> 1:53:38.060]  I'm a capitalist.
[1:53:38.060 --> 1:53:39.060]  I'm all for that.
[1:53:39.060 --> 1:53:40.060]  You've got that.
[1:53:40.060 --> 1:53:43.180]  But that's not what we're here for, and you know it.
[1:53:43.180 --> 1:53:44.180]  And that's why you're here.
[1:53:44.180 --> 1:53:49.620]  All right, let me just put away the rest of this news when it comes to Russia and Ukraine,
[1:53:49.620 --> 1:53:53.100]  and then we'll get into the rest of this news in the second, or excuse me, the third hour
[1:53:53.100 --> 1:53:55.020]  of today's transmission.
[1:53:55.020 --> 1:54:02.460]  FBI seizes $90 million yacht owned by Putin ally Victor Wecklesburg in Spain.
[1:54:02.460 --> 1:54:06.820]  So now the feds and the global government, which they say doesn't exist, oh, really?
[1:54:06.820 --> 1:54:11.220]  And why are they all going after these Russian millionaires' yachts?
[1:54:11.220 --> 1:54:18.140]  Hey, look, you want to complain about people being too rich and buying these ridiculous
[1:54:18.140 --> 1:54:20.660]  yachts that they probably use like four times a year?
[1:54:20.660 --> 1:54:23.180]  Hey, fine, complain all day.
[1:54:23.180 --> 1:54:28.820]  But let's not sit here and act like Americans don't do that.
[1:54:28.820 --> 1:54:34.020]  And let's not sit here and act like it's a good thing that there's some sort of global
[1:54:34.020 --> 1:54:43.020]  government faction or that the FBI can go over to Spain and steal a Russian's yacht.
[1:54:43.020 --> 1:54:45.780]  Do you think that's a smart move by the U.S. government?
[1:54:45.780 --> 1:54:47.620]  No, that's saber rattling.
[1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:51.180]  That's adding to the war front.
[1:54:51.180 --> 1:54:55.260]  That's adding to the strife between Russia and the West.
[1:54:55.260 --> 1:54:56.260]  And it's just totally illegal.
[1:54:56.260 --> 1:54:59.140]  What if the FBI just goes see someone's yacht?
[1:54:59.140 --> 1:55:00.140]  I don't care.
[1:55:00.140 --> 1:55:03.700]  I don't care how bad this billionaire Russian might be.
[1:55:03.700 --> 1:55:07.820]  He's not chopping up kids or having pedophile island like Epstein, then leave him the damn
[1:55:07.820 --> 1:55:08.820]  hell alone.
[1:55:08.820 --> 1:55:13.180]  But oh, he's a Russian now and being Russian is a crime now.
[1:55:13.180 --> 1:55:15.820]  So that's what they do.
[1:55:15.820 --> 1:55:20.300]  They just put this marker on you like, oh, you're a Russian, therefore you're a criminal.
[1:55:20.300 --> 1:55:21.300]  No.
[1:55:21.300 --> 1:55:24.620]  Oh, you're a Trump supporter, therefore you're a criminal.
[1:55:24.620 --> 1:55:25.980]  No.
[1:55:25.980 --> 1:55:27.380]  But that's the mindset.
[1:55:27.380 --> 1:55:32.820]  And the reason why the left buys into that just head over heels is because it's such
[1:55:32.820 --> 1:55:38.220]  an intellectual, an unintellectual position to take, and it's the easy way in.
[1:55:38.220 --> 1:55:40.340]  So they just go with the easy way in.
[1:55:40.340 --> 1:55:45.260]  The most unintellectual, oh yeah, Russian bad, oh yeah, a Trump supporter bad, yeah.
[1:55:45.260 --> 1:55:49.260]  And they just jump on board with that because it requires zero intellect, zero critical
[1:55:49.260 --> 1:55:54.940]  thinking, which at this point, I'm not even sure if they have the capacity to do honestly.
[1:55:54.940 --> 1:55:58.780]  These people have been so soul sucked and so demonically possessed and so brainwashed.
[1:55:58.780 --> 1:56:03.500]  I mean, we've seen it.
[1:56:03.500 --> 1:56:07.460]  So this is just going to probably continue to happen.
[1:56:07.460 --> 1:56:12.100]  And then the goal here is for the West to isolate Putin, and they want all of these
[1:56:12.100 --> 1:56:16.020]  millionaires and billionaires in Russia to turn against Putin, which folks, this just
[1:56:16.020 --> 1:56:18.100]  shows you it's not working.
[1:56:18.100 --> 1:56:23.020]  So the more you see this activity from the corrupt feds, the more you know that Russia's
[1:56:23.020 --> 1:56:24.020]  actually winning.
[1:56:24.020 --> 1:56:25.020]  Okay?
[1:56:25.020 --> 1:56:26.580]  Let me tell you.
[1:56:26.580 --> 1:56:31.340]  If Russia was losing, they wouldn't feel the need to go steal a bunch of Russian millionaires'
[1:56:31.340 --> 1:56:33.340]  property and yachts.
[1:56:33.340 --> 1:56:39.380]  But because Russia and Putin are winning, they have to go do that to try to isolate Putin
[1:56:39.380 --> 1:56:41.380]  from his own people.
[1:56:41.380 --> 1:56:43.220]  And it's not working, folks.
[1:56:43.220 --> 1:56:50.500]  And our chicken-necked, nelly, pencil-needled dick, Merrick Garland, like, oh my gosh.
[1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:56.180]  See, and that's the thing is, Merrick Garland wants my head on a stick.
[1:56:56.180 --> 1:57:00.460]  So it's like, I realize now, oh, I go on air and I say something bad about Merrick Garland.
[1:57:00.460 --> 1:57:05.700]  He literally has the power and the will to destroy me.
[1:57:05.700 --> 1:57:10.860]  But you tell me who's the bad guy.
[1:57:10.860 --> 1:57:18.980]  So that's just going to continue to happen, and it's not going to help peace efforts.
[1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:20.660]  And it's certainly not hurting Putin.
[1:57:20.660 --> 1:57:23.700]  Airbnb cancels all reservations in Russia and Belarus.
[1:57:23.700 --> 1:57:27.980]  Yes, if you have an account based out of Russia or Belarus, you can no longer use Airbnb.
[1:57:27.980 --> 1:57:29.860]  Oh, that's funny.
[1:57:29.860 --> 1:57:31.260]  Neither can I.
[1:57:31.260 --> 1:57:32.820]  I was banned from Airbnb.
[1:57:32.820 --> 1:57:37.420]  It doesn't matter I had about 30, 40 perfect five-star ratings.
[1:57:37.420 --> 1:57:38.420]  Never anything negative.
[1:57:38.420 --> 1:57:40.100]  They banned me.
[1:57:40.100 --> 1:57:41.100]  So that's it.
[1:57:41.100 --> 1:57:42.100]  You're a Russian.
[1:57:42.100 --> 1:57:43.100]  You're a Trump supporter.
[1:57:43.100 --> 1:57:44.100]  You're a criminal.
[1:57:44.100 --> 1:57:48.380]  No, that's not how justice works in this planet, you liars.
[1:57:48.380 --> 1:57:56.620]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[1:57:56.620 --> 1:57:59.900]  Coin, and it sold out in 10 days.
[1:57:59.900 --> 1:58:04.500]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[1:58:04.500 --> 1:58:07.900]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[1:58:07.900 --> 1:58:13.220]  Now the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered and it will probably sell
[1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:15.300]  out in 10 days again.
[1:58:15.300 --> 1:58:17.780]  It certainly needs to the front of operation.
[1:58:17.780 --> 1:58:22.820]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[1:58:22.820 --> 1:58:26.700]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more.
[1:58:26.700 --> 1:58:30.700]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:30.700 --> 1:58:32.940]  It's also at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:32.940 --> 1:58:33.940]  It's amazing.
[1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:38.460]  There's only 10,000 of them and as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air,
[1:58:38.460 --> 1:58:43.100]  we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next
[1:58:43.100 --> 1:58:44.100]  level.
[1:58:44.100 --> 1:58:48.860]  You can get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:48.860 --> 1:58:57.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20-year history.
[1:58:57.780 --> 1:59:02.700]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[1:59:02.700 --> 1:59:08.500]  have broken down, and Info Wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying
[1:59:08.500 --> 1:59:13.260]  for operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists
[1:59:13.260 --> 1:59:14.700]  making their main move.
[1:59:14.700 --> 1:59:18.820]  Info Wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[1:59:18.820 --> 1:59:23.420]  ever despite the censorship, but because of cost increasing and having to run our own
[1:59:23.420 --> 1:59:28.220]  infrastructure, pay for our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money.
[1:59:28.220 --> 1:59:34.860]  So listen up to 75% off at infowarstore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that
[1:59:34.860 --> 1:59:40.580]  help spread the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films.
[1:59:40.580 --> 1:59:46.740]  And it's 25 to 75% off right now, the biggest sell in our history at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:46.740 --> 1:59:48.500]  Thank you for your support.
[1:59:48.500 --> 1:59:56.620]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:59:56.620 --> 2:00:06.580]  Alright, we're in the third hour of the Alex Jones show here today and I am just going
[2:00:06.580 --> 2:00:12.300]  to focus and I'm going to try to get all of this news off my desk as quickly as possible
[2:00:12.300 --> 2:00:15.820]  and then play the video clips that I have for you today.
[2:00:15.820 --> 2:00:20.500]  So without any further hesitation, let me just move on here Berserker style into this
[2:00:20.500 --> 2:00:22.900]  news.
[2:00:22.900 --> 2:00:29.740]  Pope Francis removes cross from event in Malta so not to upset illegal Muslim migrants isn't
[2:00:29.740 --> 2:00:30.740]  that nice.
[2:00:30.740 --> 2:00:37.860]  The Pope removes the cross, the Pope removes the cross at a public event.
[2:00:37.860 --> 2:00:42.580]  You still think this is the Pope that you're told he is, you still think this is the Catholic
[2:00:42.580 --> 2:00:45.260]  church as you're supposed to believe it is?
[2:00:45.260 --> 2:00:53.860]  No, ladies and gentlemen, this is a communist, globalist Pope that helps cover up child abuse
[2:00:53.860 --> 2:00:58.300]  stories that come out of the Vatican.
[2:00:58.300 --> 2:00:59.820]  Evil evil everywhere.
[2:00:59.820 --> 2:01:04.140]  Here's up, Orban wins Hungary despite massive Soros assault.
[2:01:04.140 --> 2:01:08.060]  That folks, I mean, I'm not going to sit here and tell you what to think about Orban but
[2:01:08.060 --> 2:01:15.100]  he's a nationalist and he's against the globalist agenda of sexualizing kids and getting rid
[2:01:15.100 --> 2:01:16.620]  of borders.
[2:01:16.620 --> 2:01:23.540]  So Soros did everything he possibly could to stop Orban from getting in, probably not
[2:01:23.540 --> 2:01:29.060]  near the effort of what they undertook to keep Trump from getting in again but it's
[2:01:29.060 --> 2:01:36.220]  a similar story just at a smaller grade but he was able to overcome and his party is doing
[2:01:36.220 --> 2:01:39.100]  quite well in Hungary.
[2:01:39.100 --> 2:01:46.420]  So that's a very, very important asset, Hungary as a country to have against the new world
[2:01:46.420 --> 2:01:50.980]  order agenda in that region of the world.
[2:01:50.980 --> 2:01:56.860]  So again, whether you like Orban or hate him, the globalists are your enemy and they don't
[2:01:56.860 --> 2:02:00.580]  like Orban and so that's good news.
[2:02:00.580 --> 2:02:06.380]  The reason for Zelensky's surprise, Grammy's appearance, you know, people are so sick of
[2:02:06.380 --> 2:02:12.860]  Hollywood garbage and arrogance and it's so bad that they have to fake a slap with Will
[2:02:12.860 --> 2:02:18.340]  Smith and Chris Rock just to drum up any hype or any ratings at all.
[2:02:18.340 --> 2:02:20.820]  And so now it's the same thing at the Grammys.
[2:02:20.820 --> 2:02:25.940]  They have to have Zelensky Skype in.
[2:02:25.940 --> 2:02:29.660]  I didn't watch the Grammys, I did see some stories about it.
[2:02:29.660 --> 2:02:35.900]  The same typical stuff, okay, here's your war propaganda and then they had a nice little
[2:02:35.900 --> 2:02:44.260]  satanic performance from their favorite satanist Lil Nas who does videos depicting sex with
[2:02:44.260 --> 2:02:50.020]  Satan and who claims to be, I guess, a non-binary man who gets pregnant too.
[2:02:50.020 --> 2:02:52.580]  I mean, it's all satanism.
[2:02:52.580 --> 2:02:55.940]  Lil Nas delivers satanic performance during Grammys.
[2:02:55.940 --> 2:02:56.940]  He loves it though.
[2:02:56.940 --> 2:03:00.820]  I mean, he loves the attention and quite frankly, he's probably an idiot.
[2:03:00.820 --> 2:03:06.140]  He probably has an IQ of about 13 and so they just take advantage of him and they say, alright,
[2:03:06.140 --> 2:03:11.260]  here's what you're going to do and you're going to make millions of dollars and that's
[2:03:11.260 --> 2:03:13.500]  how they buy your soul.
[2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:18.140]  They say, you're going to be rich and famous and they find enough people that like that
[2:03:18.140 --> 2:03:21.780]  and so that's what you see where they do like, oh, here's all the commentary, here's all
[2:03:21.780 --> 2:03:25.740]  the negative tweets, here's everything bad that they say about Lil Nas X but look, here
[2:03:25.740 --> 2:03:31.780]  I am still sexualizing your kids, here I am still doing satanic performances and I'm rich
[2:03:31.780 --> 2:03:36.100]  and famous and he has no idea what's going on.
[2:03:36.100 --> 2:03:42.380]  He just is fulfilling his duty of performing and getting on tracks and then doing satanic
[2:03:42.380 --> 2:03:47.860]  performances and sexualizing the children.
[2:03:47.860 --> 2:03:51.740]  It's really just sad, isn't it?
[2:03:51.740 --> 2:03:56.220]  It's really just sad.
[2:03:56.220 --> 2:04:04.180]  But see, this is why when you watch movies like The Fifth Element and they have the character
[2:04:04.180 --> 2:04:10.060]  portrayed by, what's the actor's name, who's the host and he's just totally goofy, dresses
[2:04:10.060 --> 2:04:16.380]  like a whack job, acts like a whack job, yeah, Chris Tucker, because that's the future they
[2:04:16.380 --> 2:04:17.380]  want.
[2:04:17.380 --> 2:04:23.220]  So these movies are all projection or just like a warning or even just foresight, which
[2:04:23.220 --> 2:04:27.420]  is like, yeah, this is where they want you to take you, this is where they're taking
[2:04:27.420 --> 2:04:32.100]  you, I mean, Hunger Games, it's the same thing everywhere, it doesn't matter whether it's
[2:04:32.100 --> 2:04:36.740]  a movie from the 80s or the 90s or just a couple of years ago, it's the same thing.
[2:04:36.740 --> 2:04:42.020]  How come in these dystopian futures with the caste system, the elite are all dressed like
[2:04:42.020 --> 2:04:49.220]  alien freak shows, non binary sex addicts, because that's what they're promoting to children.
[2:04:49.220 --> 2:04:53.720]  That's what they're telling the kids is cool and in that's what they're trying to create.
[2:04:53.720 --> 2:04:58.380]  We reject that.
[2:04:58.380 --> 2:05:02.140]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[2:05:02.140 --> 2:05:06.740]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[2:05:06.740 --> 2:05:14.580]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered.
[2:05:14.580 --> 2:05:19.180]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days again, because these are historic coins and
[2:05:19.180 --> 2:05:23.620]  because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep in full wars at the front
[2:05:23.620 --> 2:05:25.580]  lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[2:05:25.580 --> 2:05:33.300]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[2:05:33.300 --> 2:05:39.980]  This is powerful, witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history
[2:05:39.980 --> 2:05:45.540]  and be part of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near
[2:05:45.540 --> 2:05:46.540]  future.
[2:05:46.540 --> 2:05:52.300]  Thanks to your support of this project, get a historic memento that helps keep info wars
[2:05:52.300 --> 2:06:03.260]  on the air and also gives you a real piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[2:06:03.260 --> 2:06:21.660]  Yeah, you're a far cry removed from the days of Johnny Cash and Johnny Carson, aren't you?
[2:06:21.660 --> 2:06:32.500]  No, now you got Lil Nas X, sucking Satan's D, and Zelensky promoting war propaganda
[2:06:32.500 --> 2:06:42.420]  and Stephen Colbert not funny, but promoting vaccines all day and a spokesman for the Democrat
[2:06:42.420 --> 2:06:43.420]  Party.
[2:06:43.420 --> 2:06:48.700]  And see, I want you to understand something I'm going to eventually get to this stack
[2:06:48.700 --> 2:06:51.780]  of news over here, but I kind of want to build up to it because you need to understand where
[2:06:51.780 --> 2:06:53.660]  all of this funnels.
[2:06:53.660 --> 2:06:58.820]  So let me just give you these headlines and then retreat back to it.
[2:06:58.820 --> 2:07:01.740]  This is where all of this funnels.
[2:07:01.740 --> 2:07:05.580]  All the stuff that I'm going to cover, the cultural rot, the political rot, all the corruption,
[2:07:05.580 --> 2:07:09.540]  all the propaganda, this is where it all funnels.
[2:07:09.540 --> 2:07:17.180]  And when you have the prospectus of the death cult and the eugenics that run this planet,
[2:07:17.180 --> 2:07:18.540]  you get it.
[2:07:18.540 --> 2:07:20.660]  It's like two plus two equals four.
[2:07:20.660 --> 2:07:21.660]  And that's the problem.
[2:07:21.660 --> 2:07:22.740]  See, because that's what it is.
[2:07:22.740 --> 2:07:29.540]  When you go through life and you know two plus two equals four, but you keep experiencing
[2:07:29.540 --> 2:07:33.700]  two plus two equals five or two plus two equals three or two plus two equals 10, and you're
[2:07:33.700 --> 2:07:35.300]  like, this doesn't make sense.
[2:07:35.300 --> 2:07:37.500]  You go insane.
[2:07:37.500 --> 2:07:40.380]  You become suicidal.
[2:07:40.380 --> 2:07:45.820]  Why so many women in middle age are on antidepressants, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, a cry
[2:07:45.820 --> 2:07:50.900]  for help, CDC warns of steep decline in teen mental health, New Yorker, the mystifying
[2:07:50.900 --> 2:07:58.140]  rise of child suicide, former French intelligence chief, all multicultural societies are doomed.
[2:07:58.140 --> 2:08:02.700]  So just understand, all the stuff, everything I'm covering, it funnels into the same eugenics
[2:08:02.700 --> 2:08:04.940]  program.
[2:08:04.940 --> 2:08:08.660]  They don't have to just drop a bomb on you if they can make you so miserable that you
[2:08:08.660 --> 2:08:10.780]  kill yourself.
[2:08:10.780 --> 2:08:13.660]  Now whether that's literally jumping off a building or putting a bullet through your
[2:08:13.660 --> 2:08:16.980]  brain, no, you'll kill yourself with the poison food.
[2:08:16.980 --> 2:08:18.820]  You'll kill yourself with the poison water.
[2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:21.820]  You'll kill yourself with the poison drugs.
[2:08:21.820 --> 2:08:24.860]  Or you'll literally kill yourself.
[2:08:24.860 --> 2:08:29.460]  Or if you're able to survive all of this, you'll plug into some false synthetic reality
[2:08:29.460 --> 2:08:34.620]  matrix that they'll be in total control of like the metaverse, which is being totally
[2:08:34.620 --> 2:08:37.580]  rejected by the way.
[2:08:37.580 --> 2:08:40.180]  So that's where all of this funnels.
[2:08:40.180 --> 2:08:44.220]  Now let's cover the rest of this news.
[2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:48.580]  Amy Schumer reveals the Alec Baldwin shooting joke she wasn't allowed to make at the Oscars.
[2:08:48.580 --> 2:08:51.580]  So apparently I guess the Oscars checks all the jokes.
[2:08:51.580 --> 2:08:52.580]  That's nice.
[2:08:52.580 --> 2:08:53.580]  You guys are really about freedom of speech, huh?
[2:08:53.580 --> 2:08:57.900]  No, it's all a controlled corporate event.
[2:08:57.900 --> 2:09:02.540]  So she was going to make a joke about the movie Look Up.
[2:09:02.540 --> 2:09:07.420]  And so she said the joke was going to be, it's better to look up than to look down at
[2:09:07.420 --> 2:09:09.740]  the barrel of Alec Baldwin's gun.
[2:09:09.740 --> 2:09:11.980]  That was actually a pretty good one.
[2:09:11.980 --> 2:09:14.500]  That would probably be the funniest joke of the night.
[2:09:14.500 --> 2:09:15.500]  Not allowed to say it.
[2:09:15.500 --> 2:09:18.300]  So Alec Baldwin is under complete and total protection.
[2:09:18.300 --> 2:09:22.380]  Alec Baldwin literally, he denies actually.
[2:09:22.380 --> 2:09:26.820]  The gun is in his hand, the bullet goes out of the gun and through a woman's head and
[2:09:26.820 --> 2:09:27.820]  kills her.
[2:09:27.820 --> 2:09:30.140]  And he says he didn't pull the trigger.
[2:09:30.140 --> 2:09:31.220]  Amazing.
[2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:37.060]  But I guess if you believe all the lies that the liberal left tells you, then yeah, guns
[2:09:37.060 --> 2:09:38.220]  do whatever they want.
[2:09:38.220 --> 2:09:39.220]  Guns think for themselves.
[2:09:39.220 --> 2:09:42.100]  Guns shoot themselves even.
[2:09:42.100 --> 2:09:47.100]  So I guess that's Alec Baldwin's argument is that guns shoot themselves.
[2:09:47.100 --> 2:09:49.380]  It doesn't matter whose hand he's in, whose hand the gun is in.
[2:09:49.380 --> 2:09:52.700]  So I guess all people that killed someone or shot a gun should be innocent like Alec
[2:09:52.700 --> 2:09:53.900]  Baldwin, right?
[2:09:53.900 --> 2:09:56.580]  No, that's called liberal Democrat privilege.
[2:09:56.580 --> 2:09:57.940]  That's called Hollywood privilege.
[2:09:57.940 --> 2:10:04.340]  And then he gets protected by the Oscars producers and they say, you can't make a joke about
[2:10:04.340 --> 2:10:06.220]  Alec Baldwin.
[2:10:06.220 --> 2:10:11.180]  I have never harmed a person in my life and I've spent more time in jail than Alec Baldwin
[2:10:11.180 --> 2:10:15.780]  who shot a woman dead.
[2:10:15.780 --> 2:10:20.780]  Now at the very least, it's involuntary manslaughter, is it not?
[2:10:20.780 --> 2:10:22.220]  It doesn't matter.
[2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:29.340]  Alec Baldwin is a good liberal Democrat Hollywood star, so he's above the law.
[2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:34.940]  Me for walking outside of the Capitol, I'm dealing with millions of dollars in legal
[2:10:34.940 --> 2:10:35.940]  fines.
[2:10:35.940 --> 2:10:38.220]  Feds spending millions of dollars to come up with me.
[2:10:38.220 --> 2:10:42.820]  Feds pouring through all my electronic devices right now as we speak.
[2:10:42.820 --> 2:10:45.420]  I'm facing huge jail time.
[2:10:45.420 --> 2:10:50.700]  I've already been locked up multiple times, but see, I should not have stepped on grass
[2:10:50.700 --> 2:10:51.700]  outside of the Capitol.
[2:10:51.700 --> 2:10:54.980]  I should have been like Alec Baldwin, a good liberal progressive Hollywood actor and I
[2:10:54.980 --> 2:10:56.540]  should have shot a woman in the head.
[2:10:56.540 --> 2:10:58.500]  Oh wait, I'm sorry, the gun did that.
[2:10:58.500 --> 2:10:59.500]  He had nothing to do with it.
[2:10:59.500 --> 2:11:02.100]  The gun acted on its own.
[2:11:02.100 --> 2:11:05.780]  I demand that gun be put on trial.
[2:11:05.780 --> 2:11:08.980]  Just unbelievable stuff.
[2:11:08.980 --> 2:11:12.780]  Ukrainian MP claims Russian soldiers burned Swastika into woman's belly, so it's the
[2:11:12.780 --> 2:11:13.780]  same thing.
[2:11:13.780 --> 2:11:16.220]  Russia says it was the Ukrainians that did that.
[2:11:16.220 --> 2:11:18.420]  Ukrainians say it was Russia that did it.
[2:11:18.420 --> 2:11:25.140]  You know, who knows folks, but like our guest said, there are things we do know.
[2:11:25.140 --> 2:11:29.900]  The U.S. was running at least 20 biological weapons labs, Hunter Biden's business, family
[2:11:29.900 --> 2:11:36.420]  business was involved in it, as were other family members of American politicians.
[2:11:36.420 --> 2:11:42.380]  The media lied about it and the lab in China that did the same thing was responsible for
[2:11:42.380 --> 2:11:44.500]  the COVID outbreak.
[2:11:44.500 --> 2:11:48.380]  Now think about this though.
[2:11:48.380 --> 2:11:55.940]  It came out that the U.S. government was taking the results from PCR tests for your
[2:11:55.940 --> 2:12:05.220]  nose, the nose swab, that the U.S. government was taking DNA samples from those tests and
[2:12:05.220 --> 2:12:07.900]  putting it into a database.
[2:12:07.900 --> 2:12:16.580]  It was already well known that companies that were doing DNA testing, oh yeah, you get your
[2:12:16.580 --> 2:12:21.500]  DNA tested, they tell you whether you're African or Native American or Italian or whatever
[2:12:21.500 --> 2:12:23.140]  if you even believe that crap.
[2:12:23.140 --> 2:12:26.260]  Quite frankly, I'm not even sure if I believe it, but whatever people have done, it's fun,
[2:12:26.260 --> 2:12:27.260]  it's curious.
[2:12:27.260 --> 2:12:30.900]  It came out that they were selling that information.
[2:12:30.900 --> 2:12:33.660]  So think about it like this.
[2:12:33.660 --> 2:12:39.260]  You go in innocent enough, you want to take a COVID nose swab test to see if you got COVID.
[2:12:39.260 --> 2:12:44.740]  Okay, that DNA sequencing may have been sold, may have been passed along, did you sign off
[2:12:44.740 --> 2:12:46.660]  on that?
[2:12:46.660 --> 2:12:50.580]  You submit a sample of your DNA, I'm not sure how they do it, they do hair or spit or
[2:12:50.580 --> 2:12:55.540]  whatever, I don't know, I would never do it.
[2:12:55.540 --> 2:12:59.700]  And you submit your DNA to these companies and they say, okay, yeah, here's your results,
[2:12:59.700 --> 2:13:05.980]  you're African or you're European, whatever, and then that gets shared or that gets sold.
[2:13:05.980 --> 2:13:14.820]  And now your DNA somehow is out there in the marketplace being sold, traded, bought, everything.
[2:13:14.820 --> 2:13:24.500]  And now you've got biological weapons labs that make DNA specific weapons.
[2:13:24.500 --> 2:13:28.180]  That was the plot of the latest James Bond movie, by the way.
[2:13:28.180 --> 2:13:32.460]  No spoiler here just telling you.
[2:13:32.460 --> 2:13:37.340]  I mean, folks, we are not in Kansas anymore, can't you understand the dangerous implications
[2:13:37.340 --> 2:13:38.340]  of all of this?
[2:13:38.340 --> 2:13:44.420]  Russia certainly does, Putin certainly does, hell, you can say Putin is the worst person
[2:13:44.420 --> 2:13:50.660]  on the planet, but he gets the dangers of that, Putin understands the dangers of having biological
[2:13:50.660 --> 2:13:56.780]  weapons labs that make DNA specific weapons with all these people volunteering unwittingly
[2:13:56.780 --> 2:14:05.900]  their DNA out on the marketplace to be bought and sold, however, however, it's fit, yeah.
[2:14:05.900 --> 2:14:10.740]  Should you be worried about somebody making a biological weapon specifically to kill you?
[2:14:10.740 --> 2:14:16.620]  Probably not, but it's out there, could be done.
[2:14:16.620 --> 2:14:17.620]  Kind of a big deal.
[2:14:17.620 --> 2:14:23.060]  Putin knows that the American media doesn't want you to know what's going on.
[2:14:23.060 --> 2:14:28.340]  And of course, they're bringing back the COVID fear mongering.
[2:14:28.340 --> 2:14:33.620]  Fauci is all excited because he saw the lockdowns in Shanghai, and then the massive testing of
[2:14:33.620 --> 2:14:36.140]  millions of people which drove case numbers up.
[2:14:36.140 --> 2:14:37.900]  Go figure.
[2:14:37.900 --> 2:14:43.580]  Testing 25 million people drove case numbers up, who would have thought?
[2:14:43.580 --> 2:14:48.500]  And so now Fauci say, yeah, we're probably gonna have to bring back lockdowns, and China's
[2:14:48.500 --> 2:14:50.420]  doing a good job there.
[2:14:50.420 --> 2:14:54.140]  These people are being held prisoner in China, folks, you understand?
[2:14:54.140 --> 2:14:58.460]  They're literally being held prisoner, and they can't even get food.
[2:14:58.460 --> 2:15:02.620]  And it's been two weeks now, and if you've run out of food or you've run out of stuff
[2:15:02.620 --> 2:15:04.140]  to drink, guess what?
[2:15:04.140 --> 2:15:05.140]  You're SOL.
[2:15:05.140 --> 2:15:08.860]  Yeah, you can try to call the government hotline to have food dropped off.
[2:15:08.860 --> 2:15:10.780]  You can try to call someone to have food dropped off.
[2:15:10.780 --> 2:15:15.300]  How do you think that's gonna go with 25 million people starving just looking for a couple
[2:15:15.300 --> 2:15:16.900]  thousand people to bring them food?
[2:15:16.900 --> 2:15:18.340]  How do you think that's going for them?
[2:15:18.340 --> 2:15:20.100]  Not well.
[2:15:20.100 --> 2:15:21.500]  And you watch.
[2:15:21.500 --> 2:15:25.740]  When all of this is said and done in Shanghai, they're gonna be going into people's apartments
[2:15:25.740 --> 2:15:32.860]  and they're gonna find dead bodies, people that starved out, people that killed themselves.
[2:15:32.860 --> 2:15:36.780]  But hey, man, we're stopping COVID.
[2:15:36.780 --> 2:15:39.060]  I'm gonna kill you so you can't spread COVID.
[2:15:39.060 --> 2:15:44.660]  I'm gonna put you in a cage and lock you up so you can't spread COVID.
[2:15:44.660 --> 2:15:45.660]  Unbelievable stuff.
[2:15:45.660 --> 2:15:51.700]  Man, made virus, Anthony Fauci knew about it, the American media knew about it.
[2:15:51.700 --> 2:15:52.700]  They covered it up.
[2:15:52.700 --> 2:15:58.380]  They're complicit in this mass manslaughter.
[2:15:58.380 --> 2:16:00.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[2:16:00.260 --> 2:16:03.660]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[2:16:03.660 --> 2:16:07.700]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[2:16:07.700 --> 2:16:08.860]  I was born for this.
[2:16:08.860 --> 2:16:09.860]  You were born for this.
[2:16:09.860 --> 2:16:14.700]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[2:16:14.700 --> 2:16:19.020]  because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[2:16:19.020 --> 2:16:23.700]  And now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[2:16:23.700 --> 2:16:29.660]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[2:16:29.660 --> 2:16:30.660]  of charge.
[2:16:30.660 --> 2:16:35.420]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[2:16:35.420 --> 2:16:39.900]  Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[2:16:39.900 --> 2:16:46.260]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[2:16:46.260 --> 2:16:48.020]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[2:16:48.020 --> 2:16:52.300]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[2:16:52.300 --> 2:16:58.060]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[2:16:58.060 --> 2:16:59.860]  So I did it.
[2:16:59.860 --> 2:17:02.020]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[2:17:02.020 --> 2:17:06.660]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[2:17:06.660 --> 2:17:08.740]  and thank goodness for info wars store.com.
[2:17:08.740 --> 2:17:14.820]  Before I start out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[2:17:14.820 --> 2:17:15.820]  to get going.
[2:17:15.820 --> 2:17:20.300]  You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like
[2:17:20.300 --> 2:17:25.460]  vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained
[2:17:25.460 --> 2:17:29.060]  energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[2:17:29.060 --> 2:17:32.700]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore list.
[2:17:32.700 --> 2:17:34.300]  I have bad joints.
[2:17:34.300 --> 2:17:35.300]  Thanks mom.
[2:17:35.300 --> 2:17:39.660]  This is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[2:17:39.660 --> 2:17:42.060]  support and extra flexibility.
[2:17:42.060 --> 2:17:46.620]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[2:17:46.620 --> 2:17:51.300]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can
[2:17:51.300 --> 2:17:55.300]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep
[2:17:55.300 --> 2:17:58.420]  you moving and feeling great at any age.

[2:03:46.540 --> 2:20:53.980]  info wars world headquarters here in Austin, Texas with you here today.
[2:20:53.980 --> 2:21:00.360]  So again though, the media celebrating Fauci celebrating everybody celebrating how China
[2:21:00.360 --> 2:21:06.580]  treats its citizens like slaves where they're in their prison camps.
[2:21:06.580 --> 2:21:10.300]  You remember, oh no, it's just your apartment, but you're out of food.
[2:21:10.300 --> 2:21:11.860]  You can't even get food now.
[2:21:11.860 --> 2:21:18.900]  Remember what it was like in Australia where they had the quarantine camps and it was like
[2:21:18.900 --> 2:21:23.580]  you couldn't leave your house, they had these people in hazmat suits delivering you food.
[2:21:23.580 --> 2:21:27.620]  If you stepped outside on the patio at the wrong time of day, they extended your lockdown,
[2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:28.620]  your imprisonment.
[2:21:28.620 --> 2:21:32.180]  I mean, who would ever support this garbage?
[2:21:32.180 --> 2:21:37.700]  But see, Fauci's out supporting it because he wants to use China as the example, as the
[2:21:37.700 --> 2:21:43.340]  standard so that Fauci and the Democrats can run the same operation here in America locking
[2:21:43.340 --> 2:21:48.660]  you down, treating you like a prisoner under the guise of protecting you from a virus,
[2:21:48.660 --> 2:21:53.020]  just a total lie, a virus that they made in a lab, by the way.
[2:21:53.020 --> 2:21:56.100]  And so here's my problem.
[2:21:56.100 --> 2:22:01.780]  When I see stories like this, I can't tell you how frustrated I get because it's the
[2:22:01.780 --> 2:22:09.860]  same level of, I don't even know what you would call it, ignorance, stupidity, where
[2:22:09.860 --> 2:22:15.900]  they say, look at what COVID did, COVID shut down the schools, COVID closed my business,
[2:22:15.900 --> 2:22:19.940]  COVID did this, COVID did that, COVID did none of that.
[2:22:19.940 --> 2:22:24.500]  And the government did all of it.
[2:22:24.500 --> 2:22:30.220]  That is a, I mean, even the lowest IQ people should have that understanding, and they don't.
[2:22:30.220 --> 2:22:38.020]  It's supposed intellectuals that go on TV, academics, politicians, and they come out
[2:22:38.020 --> 2:22:42.340]  and they say, COVID did this, COVID did this because of the virus, because of the virus.
[2:22:42.340 --> 2:22:47.940]  No, government did this, period, end of story, end of sentence, stop.
[2:22:47.940 --> 2:22:50.260]  Stop saying COVID.
[2:22:50.260 --> 2:22:55.060]  So this, this, this story has that same energy, has that same vibe.
[2:22:55.060 --> 2:23:03.020]  COVID horror, virus may cause brain damage, even in patients with mild respiratory symptoms.
[2:23:03.020 --> 2:23:09.380]  So you hear all this stuff about long COVID and COVID does this, COVID, COVID makes your
[2:23:09.380 --> 2:23:13.780]  penis shrink and COVID makes you lose hair and COVID makes you have brain damage and
[2:23:13.780 --> 2:23:21.740]  all this stuff, and, and I understand the immediate reaction to all of this, which, which I tend
[2:23:21.740 --> 2:23:28.140]  to have as well, which is, hey, we've been lied to you so much about COVID, you've done
[2:23:28.140 --> 2:23:33.340]  so much fear mongering over COVID, I don't believe any of this crap.
[2:23:33.340 --> 2:23:39.460]  So part of me says, oh, brain damage from COVID, probably just fear mongering BS like
[2:23:39.460 --> 2:23:40.620]  everything else.
[2:23:40.620 --> 2:23:46.340]  But see, here's the problem, and this is why I say it's the same energy as COVID did this,
[2:23:46.340 --> 2:23:49.260]  COVID did this, no, the government did this.
[2:23:49.260 --> 2:23:58.180]  Let's say everything they tell you about COVID is true in regards to long COVID or brain damage
[2:23:58.180 --> 2:24:02.140]  or penis shrinkage or all this other stuff, they tell you, let's say it's all true.
[2:24:02.140 --> 2:24:10.460]  Well, again, COVID was made in a lab, it's a man made virus.
[2:24:10.460 --> 2:24:15.220]  So if you're going to be talking about how this virus acts differently than every other
[2:24:15.220 --> 2:24:20.820]  virus known in human history, and you're going to be talking about all these horrific long
[2:24:20.820 --> 2:24:23.860]  term effects, and that's why you can't get it, and that's why you should always wear
[2:24:23.860 --> 2:24:27.260]  the mask and never leave your house again and all this other stuff.
[2:24:27.260 --> 2:24:28.260]  Okay.
[2:24:28.260 --> 2:24:33.820]  So why aren't we mad at the people that created and released this on us?
[2:24:33.820 --> 2:24:36.500]  So what is the breakdown here?
[2:24:36.500 --> 2:24:38.660]  What is the boiled out?
[2:24:38.660 --> 2:24:46.100]  The frustration is not placing blame and responsibility where it belongs.
[2:24:46.100 --> 2:24:48.860]  That's what it is.
[2:24:48.860 --> 2:24:53.900]  Blaming COVID for the kids wearing masks, blaming COVID for school closures, business
[2:24:53.900 --> 2:24:57.220]  closures, all this other stuff, that is not the proper blame.
[2:24:57.220 --> 2:24:59.460]  This is zero percent accuracy right there.
[2:24:59.460 --> 2:25:03.100]  Blaming COVID for any of it, zero percent accuracy, zero.
[2:25:03.100 --> 2:25:09.020]  Blaming the government and the corporations and everybody did that, 100% accuracy.
[2:25:09.020 --> 2:25:10.820]  But what do you get from the media and your politicians?
[2:25:10.820 --> 2:25:12.420]  They say COVID is to blame.
[2:25:12.420 --> 2:25:14.620]  COVID has zero percent responsibility.
[2:25:14.620 --> 2:25:19.780]  The government actors and the corporate actors that foisted all the COVID madness upon us,
[2:25:19.780 --> 2:25:21.900]  they bear 100% possibility.
[2:25:21.900 --> 2:25:26.820]  If I try to go get on an airplane right now, is a virus going to pop up and tell me to
[2:25:26.820 --> 2:25:27.820]  wear a mask?
[2:25:27.820 --> 2:25:28.820]  No.
[2:25:28.820 --> 2:25:33.500]  Is some airline attendant going to tell me to wear a mask?
[2:25:33.500 --> 2:25:34.900]  Yes.
[2:25:34.900 --> 2:25:36.700]  So it's the same thing.
[2:25:36.700 --> 2:25:42.060]  Oh, COVID is causing long term problems and brain damage and all this stuff.
[2:25:42.060 --> 2:25:43.500]  Okay, well who's responsible?
[2:25:43.500 --> 2:25:46.540]  Who made the virus?
[2:25:46.540 --> 2:25:49.500]  Who released the virus?
[2:25:49.500 --> 2:25:51.300]  So it's all this fear mongering.
[2:25:51.300 --> 2:25:56.140]  If you get COVID, your penis is going to shrink and you're going to have brain damage so that
[2:25:56.140 --> 2:25:57.900]  you're scared to death forever.
[2:25:57.900 --> 2:25:59.300]  You never take the mask off.
[2:25:59.300 --> 2:26:03.220]  You never give control of your life or take control of your life back from the government.
[2:26:03.220 --> 2:26:08.980]  You give it to them permanently in this state of permaphore and then you never blame the
[2:26:08.980 --> 2:26:12.060]  parties responsible, the individuals that made it in a lab.
[2:26:12.060 --> 2:26:13.780]  So just remember this.
[2:26:13.780 --> 2:26:19.380]  When they tell you stories about long COVID and lung damage and brain damage and genital
[2:26:19.380 --> 2:26:25.300]  damage and all this stuff, thanks Anthony Fauci and Peter Dossick and everybody else
[2:26:25.300 --> 2:26:31.260]  that knew that this came in a lab and funded this research in a lab and it's just, oh fear
[2:26:31.260 --> 2:26:32.260]  over COVID.
[2:26:32.260 --> 2:26:33.260]  Oh my gosh.
[2:26:33.260 --> 2:26:34.260]  Oh, COVID does this.
[2:26:34.260 --> 2:26:35.260]  COVID does that.
[2:26:35.260 --> 2:26:39.180]  Well, why aren't you holding the people responsible that made COVID?
[2:26:39.180 --> 2:26:43.060]  The frustration is going to go on, I'm sure.
[2:26:43.060 --> 2:26:48.300]  And then there's the vaccines, which are also killing people.
[2:26:48.300 --> 2:26:51.340]  Killing more people than they help and it's not even close by the way.
[2:26:51.340 --> 2:26:56.940]  But so, so again, I don't want to be the person that sees every story and says, oh, vaccine,
[2:26:56.940 --> 2:27:04.500]  vaccine, vaccine, but it's a fair argument, like when I see this, doctors stunned by baby
[2:27:04.500 --> 2:27:09.500]  born with two heads, three hands and one torso.
[2:27:09.500 --> 2:27:14.460]  So obviously the debate is raging was the mother vaccinated, but you're not allowed to
[2:27:14.460 --> 2:27:15.460]  ask that question.
[2:27:15.460 --> 2:27:17.220]  You're not allowed to get that answer.
[2:27:17.220 --> 2:27:23.260]  You just see this baby that you just feel so bad for it, just a total mutant, a mutant
[2:27:23.260 --> 2:27:24.260]  baby.
[2:27:24.260 --> 2:27:28.620]  And yeah, if we start seeing more of this pop up, I think it's pretty fair to say it's
[2:27:28.620 --> 2:27:34.100]  probably the vaccines, but you'll never get that fair and open debate.
[2:27:34.100 --> 2:27:36.300]  You'll never, you'll never get that.
[2:27:36.300 --> 2:27:37.780]  Here was another example last night.
[2:27:37.780 --> 2:27:39.140]  I saw this in live time.
[2:27:39.140 --> 2:27:44.020]  I remember texting my friends, final four basketball game, North Carolina player holds
[2:27:44.020 --> 2:27:48.140]  his chest, can't catch breath, sinks the floor, throws up in final minutes.
[2:27:48.140 --> 2:27:55.500]  Now, I remember watching this and this individual player started grasping at his heart and his
[2:27:55.500 --> 2:28:00.060]  chest about 60 seconds before he fell over.
[2:28:00.060 --> 2:28:02.220]  And if you go back and watch the game, you can do this.
[2:28:02.220 --> 2:28:05.380]  And it's just stunning how unobservant people are when dealing with this.
[2:28:05.380 --> 2:28:06.660]  This is the aftermath.
[2:28:06.660 --> 2:28:09.860]  That was about 60 seconds after he was grabbing his heart.
[2:28:09.860 --> 2:28:15.140]  He grabbed at his heart two possessions before that and up and down the court twice on two
[2:28:15.140 --> 2:28:19.420]  possessions was grabbing his heart and then he kills over and starts vomiting.
[2:28:19.420 --> 2:28:24.220]  Now, they said he had the wind knocked out of them.
[2:28:24.220 --> 2:28:25.860]  Folks, I've played sports my whole life.
[2:28:25.860 --> 2:28:28.660]  I've had wind knocked down me plenty of times.
[2:28:28.660 --> 2:28:31.700]  Everybody knows when you get the wind knocked out of you, that's it.
[2:28:31.700 --> 2:28:32.700]  You're on the floor.
[2:28:32.700 --> 2:28:36.100]  You can't breathe and you need at least 60 seconds to get your wind back.
[2:28:36.100 --> 2:28:39.180]  You're certainly not running up and down the court for two possessions.
[2:28:39.180 --> 2:28:43.580]  I've never seen anybody vomit from having the wind knocked out of them either.
[2:28:43.580 --> 2:28:48.460]  Now, maybe that could happen, but clearly this kid had something going on in his chest.
[2:28:48.460 --> 2:28:49.660]  He was pointing to his chest.
[2:28:49.660 --> 2:28:51.220]  He was grabbing his chest.
[2:28:51.220 --> 2:28:55.220]  It wasn't he had the air knocked out of him, but that's just what they say because you
[2:28:55.220 --> 2:28:59.060]  can't ask about the vaccines and the heart problems.
[2:28:59.060 --> 2:29:09.420]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three part Founder's Series at 1776coin.com
[2:29:09.420 --> 2:29:11.380]  or in for store.com.
[2:29:11.380 --> 2:29:13.740]  And the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[2:29:13.740 --> 2:29:17.940]  Thomas Jefferson quote must be watered with the blood of Patriots and tyrants to coin
[2:29:17.940 --> 2:29:18.940]  I designed.
[2:29:18.940 --> 2:29:19.940]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[2:29:19.940 --> 2:29:22.260]  And it will end up being a collectible.
[2:29:22.260 --> 2:29:27.380]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[2:29:27.380 --> 2:29:28.660]  we sold it.
[2:29:28.660 --> 2:29:34.340]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly and I appreciate listeners getting
[2:29:34.340 --> 2:29:35.340]  over half of them now.
[2:29:35.340 --> 2:29:37.460]  I'd like to lose them out very quickly.
[2:29:37.460 --> 2:29:41.180]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[2:29:41.180 --> 2:29:45.780]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[2:29:45.780 --> 2:29:47.860]  We've had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems.
[2:29:47.860 --> 2:29:52.020]  So it was a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom
[2:29:52.020 --> 2:29:54.940]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[2:29:54.940 --> 2:30:01.780]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new world order at 1776coin.com.

[2:31:07.380 --> 2:31:11.380]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[2:31:11.380 --> 2:31:12.580]  I was born for this.
[2:31:12.580 --> 2:31:13.580]  You were born for this.
[2:31:13.580 --> 2:31:18.660]  People are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure because
[2:31:18.660 --> 2:31:22.740]  of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[2:31:22.740 --> 2:31:27.420]  And now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[2:31:27.420 --> 2:31:33.300]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[2:31:33.300 --> 2:31:34.300]  of charge.
[2:31:34.300 --> 2:31:39.100]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[2:31:39.100 --> 2:31:43.620]  InfoWars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[2:31:43.620 --> 2:31:44.620]  movement worldwide.
[2:31:44.620 --> 2:31:50.300]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[2:31:50.300 --> 2:31:51.740]  of thousands of dollars a month.
[2:31:51.740 --> 2:31:56.020]  So the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[2:31:56.020 --> 2:32:02.180]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keep InfoWars as strong as ever.
[2:32:02.180 --> 2:32:06.780]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[2:32:06.780 --> 2:32:10.820]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[2:32:10.820 --> 2:32:15.300]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true today.
[2:32:15.300 --> 2:32:22.420]  We see the entire global corrupt into human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to
[2:32:22.420 --> 2:32:29.020]  collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[2:32:29.020 --> 2:32:35.500]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[2:32:35.500 --> 2:32:41.580]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID area, their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon
[2:32:41.580 --> 2:32:44.220]  tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[2:32:44.220 --> 2:32:49.380]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[2:32:49.380 --> 2:32:50.900]  silenced and gas lit.
[2:32:50.900 --> 2:32:55.100]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[2:32:55.100 --> 2:32:59.500]  And that's why it's hard to share InfoWars links and Band-Aid video.
[2:32:59.500 --> 2:33:15.900]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:15.900 --> 2:33:28.700]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[2:33:28.700 --> 2:33:42.100]  Let's say I released a billion mosquitoes in Texas that were known to cause seizures
[2:33:42.100 --> 2:33:45.620]  if you got bit by it.
[2:33:45.620 --> 2:33:52.940]  And then all of a sudden in Texas, you had all of these seizure events happening, numbers
[2:33:52.940 --> 2:33:54.940]  of seizure events skyrocketing in Texas.
[2:33:54.940 --> 2:34:00.380]  Well, it'd be pretty obvious, wouldn't it, you'd say, okay, had you been bitten by this
[2:34:00.380 --> 2:34:03.380]  mosquito any time recently, have you had a mosquito bite any time recently?
[2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:07.580]  Oh, yes, it's like, hum, okay, I think your seizure may have something to do with it.
[2:34:07.580 --> 2:34:08.980]  That's common sense.
[2:34:08.980 --> 2:34:15.900]  But when it comes to the vaccine, oh, no, no, no, no, you don't get to ask that.
[2:34:15.900 --> 2:34:19.380]  So it's like, okay, known side effects of the vaccine, blood clots, heart problems.
[2:34:19.380 --> 2:34:22.580]  It's like, oh, wow, a lot of these people are having blood clots and heart problems.
[2:34:22.580 --> 2:34:28.300]  Don't ask about the vaccine, though, like, oh, yeah, kids have always had blood clots
[2:34:28.300 --> 2:34:29.300]  and heart attacks.
[2:34:29.300 --> 2:34:32.500]  That's been a normal thing is what they say.
[2:34:32.500 --> 2:34:34.940]  Clearly it's the vaccine.
[2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:37.540]  Let me just try to get as much of this news off my desk as possible.
[2:34:37.540 --> 2:34:41.540]  I'm probably not even going to have time for all of it or these clips, exclusive army captain
[2:34:41.540 --> 2:34:45.820]  place in mental hospital for accusing commanding general Patrick Donahue of pushing a legal
[2:34:45.820 --> 2:34:53.060]  vaccine, oh, army captain put in mental hospital because he believes in medical freedom.
[2:34:53.060 --> 2:34:55.900]  This country is so evil.
[2:34:55.900 --> 2:34:58.860]  Just so evil that this goes on here.
[2:34:58.860 --> 2:35:05.280]  Federal judge blocks Air Force on giving punishment for members who refuse to take COVID-19 vaccines.
[2:35:05.280 --> 2:35:08.380]  So that's a judge in Cincinnati, good for him.
[2:35:08.380 --> 2:35:14.660]  But oh, so one judge does the right thing, but then an army captain correctly calls it
[2:35:14.660 --> 2:35:19.580]  an illegal vaccine mandate and he's told he needs to be placed in mental, a mental institution.
[2:35:19.580 --> 2:35:25.540]  That's a Chinese style reeducation camp right here for our army members in America.
[2:35:25.540 --> 2:35:29.180]  Mother who confronted New York City mayor Adams over toddler mask mandate fired from
[2:35:29.180 --> 2:35:30.180]  city job.
[2:35:30.180 --> 2:35:31.500]  Oh, and I love it.
[2:35:31.500 --> 2:35:33.380]  New York's like moved to New York.
[2:35:33.380 --> 2:35:40.300]  We believe in free speech because we say gay, oh, you criticize the mayor, you're fired.
[2:35:40.300 --> 2:35:42.180]  These are evil people.
[2:35:42.180 --> 2:35:46.860]  It's beyond any shadow of it out that the vaccines are causing large numbers of deaths.
[2:35:46.860 --> 2:35:50.140]  That is the latest from Dr. Peter McCullough.
[2:35:50.140 --> 2:35:57.140]  Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, moving on, the Democrats and the Republicans are going to
[2:35:57.140 --> 2:36:03.820]  confirm a pedophile protecting judge to put it another way.
[2:36:03.820 --> 2:36:08.820]  If you were a pedophile and you ended up in a courtroom and you saw that contingent Brown
[2:36:08.820 --> 2:36:11.660]  Jackson was on the bench, you're feeling good.
[2:36:11.660 --> 2:36:12.660]  You're celebrating.
[2:36:12.660 --> 2:36:13.660]  Your lawyers are celebrating.
[2:36:13.660 --> 2:36:14.780]  You know you're going to get a light sentence.
[2:36:14.780 --> 2:36:19.140]  The pedophile protector is there on the bench.
[2:36:19.140 --> 2:36:23.420]  Politico deletes tweet claiming Judge Jackson will be first black Supreme Court justice.
[2:36:23.420 --> 2:36:24.700]  Isn't that hilarious?
[2:36:24.700 --> 2:36:31.340]  They literally claimed that Jackson would have been the first black Supreme Court justice
[2:36:31.340 --> 2:36:35.940]  ignoring Judge Clarence Thomas because that's how their mind works, folks.
[2:36:35.940 --> 2:36:38.660]  These people are mentally ill.
[2:36:38.660 --> 2:36:42.500]  They don't count Justice Clarence Thomas as the first black Supreme Court justice because
[2:36:42.500 --> 2:36:46.660]  he's not a deranged mentally ill leftist liberal.
[2:36:46.660 --> 2:36:47.660]  I'm telling you this.
[2:36:47.660 --> 2:36:52.020]  You need to understand this about the race-baiting liberal movement right now.
[2:36:52.020 --> 2:36:53.740]  It's not about skin color.
[2:36:53.740 --> 2:36:56.020]  It's all about politics.
[2:36:56.020 --> 2:37:00.540]  They love to use tokenism for their political agenda.
[2:37:00.540 --> 2:37:03.900]  But if you're black or you're this or you're that and you don't support their agenda,
[2:37:03.900 --> 2:37:09.180]  then you don't count, including Clarence Thomas, and they just showed you their hand with that
[2:37:09.180 --> 2:37:10.700]  story in Politico.
[2:37:10.700 --> 2:37:12.260]  It has nothing to do with skin color, folks.
[2:37:12.260 --> 2:37:15.340]  It's all about politics, all of it.
[2:37:15.340 --> 2:37:20.340]  The same reason why I can't go walk into a girl's bathroom or a girl's locker room at
[2:37:20.340 --> 2:37:22.940]  the gym because I'm not a liberal.
[2:37:22.940 --> 2:37:26.620]  But if I was a good liberal and I said, I'm a woman, I'm going into the woman's room,
[2:37:26.620 --> 2:37:27.620]  then I'd be fine.
[2:37:27.620 --> 2:37:28.620]  It doesn't matter.
[2:37:28.620 --> 2:37:29.620]  I don't have to shave.
[2:37:29.620 --> 2:37:31.120]  I don't have to chop off my dingling, anything.
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:32.620]  I mean, I just go right in.
[2:37:32.620 --> 2:37:34.700]  I say, I'm a good progressive liberal.
[2:37:34.700 --> 2:37:35.700]  I'm a woman now.
[2:37:35.700 --> 2:37:38.900]  I go in the woman's locker room, I go shower with them, and it's all good.
[2:37:38.900 --> 2:37:43.140]  But no, because I'm not a brainwashed liberal, I couldn't do that.
[2:37:43.140 --> 2:37:45.780]  That's nothing to do with science or anything.
[2:37:45.780 --> 2:37:47.620]  It's always politics.
[2:37:47.620 --> 2:37:52.100]  Contenji Brown Jackson shows leniency even in baby sex torture cases.
[2:37:52.100 --> 2:37:55.940]  Yeah, they're torturing little children, little babies.
[2:37:55.940 --> 2:38:00.580]  These cases end up on Judge Jackson's desk, and she gives them a tiny little slap on the
[2:38:00.580 --> 2:38:02.780]  wrist, a slap on the wrist.
[2:38:02.780 --> 2:38:09.740]  I've dealt with worse punishment for what I've done, an innocent man, a political prisoner.
[2:38:09.740 --> 2:38:14.420]  I've dealt with worse punishment, and I've gone through more torture than pedophiles
[2:38:14.420 --> 2:38:19.220]  and child sex abusers have whose cases ended up on Judge Jackson's bench.
[2:38:19.220 --> 2:38:20.220]  Think about that.
[2:38:20.220 --> 2:38:21.220]  Actually, probably don't.
[2:38:21.220 --> 2:38:22.220]  It's pretty sad.
[2:38:22.220 --> 2:38:24.740]  It's pretty painful to think about.
[2:38:24.740 --> 2:38:28.020]  But it's the truth.
[2:38:28.020 --> 2:38:32.660]  Going on, an organized crime perpetrated on Americans, experts claim in testimony at
[2:38:32.660 --> 2:38:39.980]  least 4.8 million ballots trafficked in the 2020 election.
[2:38:39.980 --> 2:38:43.620]  I mean, seriously, how many illegal votes did Biden get to get to, what, 83 million?
[2:38:43.620 --> 2:38:45.660]  I mean, give me a break.
[2:38:45.660 --> 2:38:48.260]  Give me a break.
[2:38:48.260 --> 2:38:52.660]  Democrats implicated Georgia ballot traffickers were using Democrat officials' offices as
[2:38:52.660 --> 2:38:55.620]  stopping points during ballot drop runs.
[2:38:55.620 --> 2:39:03.140]  And remember, in the Wisconsin hearing, they actually got the information.
[2:39:03.140 --> 2:39:09.500]  So they found, I believe it was 14 individuals, and they did it in Georgia too, but they found
[2:39:09.500 --> 2:39:15.460]  the individuals who were going to ballot drop boxes multiple times a day, and they were
[2:39:15.460 --> 2:39:19.660]  able to locate their device to track their movements, and they were going to multiple
[2:39:19.660 --> 2:39:25.580]  ballot drop boxes every day, going to Democrat Party headquarters every day, and it also
[2:39:25.580 --> 2:39:31.300]  just so happens, they were at the riots in Kenosha as well.
[2:39:31.300 --> 2:39:37.020]  Hundreds of suspects filmed stuffing multiple ballots into Pennsylvania County drop boxes.
[2:39:37.020 --> 2:39:40.940]  Republican DA won't prosecute any of these suspects because not everyone has been identified.
[2:39:40.940 --> 2:39:45.220]  So I mean, folks, they're on tape, they're on camera stealing the election.
[2:39:45.220 --> 2:39:46.620]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[2:39:46.620 --> 2:39:48.420]  I mean, come on, man.
[2:39:48.420 --> 2:39:52.340]  Do we really have to explain that Biden didn't get 83 million votes?
[2:39:52.340 --> 2:40:00.340]  The guy that didn't even campaign, the guy that couldn't even have a debate?
[2:40:00.340 --> 2:40:03.420]  President Trump requests Clinton judge who was assigned to oversee his Russiagate lawsuit
[2:40:03.420 --> 2:40:04.740]  against Hillary Clinton be removed.
[2:40:04.740 --> 2:40:06.540]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:40:06.540 --> 2:40:11.740]  That Clinton judge is going to make sure that Trump does not get a fair case.
[2:40:11.740 --> 2:40:15.420]  Believe me, believe me.
[2:40:15.420 --> 2:40:21.160]  Final suspect in Detroit-based multimillion-dollar credit card fraud ring sentenced to prison.
[2:40:21.160 --> 2:40:24.820]  Have you guys noticed that this is happening more and more?
[2:40:24.820 --> 2:40:25.820]  Credit card fraud.
[2:40:25.820 --> 2:40:33.140]  I have now, for the third time this year, my credit card or my debit card, rather, has
[2:40:33.140 --> 2:40:40.980]  been involved in what they call a mass compromise event third time this year.
[2:40:40.980 --> 2:40:45.460]  But we should all have the government-run digital currency because it's really safe,
[2:40:45.460 --> 2:40:49.180]  you know, it's really safe.
[2:40:49.180 --> 2:40:54.060]  This arrest 26-year-old suspect over Sacramento mass shooting, did you hear about this one?
[2:40:54.060 --> 2:40:56.540]  You didn't hear about that one, did you?
[2:40:56.540 --> 2:41:00.100]  Mass shooting in California yesterday?
[2:41:00.100 --> 2:41:01.420]  Any news on it?
[2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:03.340]  Any big stories about it?
[2:41:03.340 --> 2:41:04.340]  No.
[2:41:04.340 --> 2:41:05.340]  No.
[2:41:05.340 --> 2:41:08.700]  Oh, there's one in Dallas, too.
[2:41:08.700 --> 2:41:11.860]  By the way, six people died in the one in California.
[2:41:11.860 --> 2:41:12.860]  Did you hear any news about that?
[2:41:12.860 --> 2:41:14.180]  Did they make a big story about that?
[2:41:14.180 --> 2:41:15.940]  No, they didn't, did they?
[2:41:15.940 --> 2:41:19.820]  Because there's never any consistency from our media because they're just a bunch of
[2:41:19.820 --> 2:41:23.620]  liars that have an agenda.
[2:41:23.620 --> 2:41:26.180]  The southern border is just absolutely wide open, folks.
[2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:27.180]  It's really incredible.
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:30.180]  I'm talking to a couple of journalists that are on the ground down there.
[2:41:30.180 --> 2:41:32.220]  It's kind of penetrating the news.
[2:41:32.220 --> 2:41:34.060]  Word is out around the world.
[2:41:34.060 --> 2:41:36.420]  The U.S. border is wide open.
[2:41:36.420 --> 2:41:40.620]  And Ben Bergquam and others are down there reporting it's just unbelievable.
[2:41:40.620 --> 2:41:45.660]  It's just this country is under complete attack, like the inflation, which is just crushing
[2:41:45.660 --> 2:41:52.020]  people, going to record highs, continuing to rise, 20 facts about the emerging global
[2:41:52.020 --> 2:41:54.140]  food shortage that should chill you to the core.
[2:41:54.140 --> 2:41:58.460]  Yeah, they're bringing in all these people into America that you're going to be forced
[2:41:58.460 --> 2:42:01.820]  to feed while there's a food shortage.
[2:42:01.820 --> 2:42:02.820]  And plus your inflation.
[2:42:02.820 --> 2:42:06.700]  I mean, you are getting broken right now.
[2:42:06.700 --> 2:42:12.300]  America is having its back broken right now by the Biden administration and the globalist.
[2:42:12.300 --> 2:42:17.220]  I mean, it's just total crushing of America right now.
[2:42:17.220 --> 2:42:24.860]  Days at or worse than 56% disapproval for their entire terms, Biden already has the record
[2:42:24.860 --> 2:42:30.900]  and he hasn't even finished one term yet with 125 days lower than 56% disapproval.
[2:42:30.900 --> 2:42:35.180]  That's much worse than Trump who had the entire media lying about him all day too.
[2:42:35.180 --> 2:42:37.660]  Here's rich liberal Democrat Shannon Sharp.
[2:42:37.660 --> 2:42:43.100]  I'd rather pay 20 bucks a gallon than have Trump in office, but then he can be seen complaining
[2:42:43.100 --> 2:42:46.540]  about high gas prices just 10 years ago.
[2:42:46.540 --> 2:42:51.060]  Another liberal that owns himself because that's what they do because modern day liberals
[2:42:51.060 --> 2:42:54.340]  are frauds, phonies and liars.
[2:42:54.340 --> 2:42:56.300]  How many times does this have to be proven?
[2:42:56.300 --> 2:43:04.740]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three part Founder Series at 1776coin.com
[2:43:04.740 --> 2:43:10.660]  and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty, Thomas Jefferson quote must be watered
[2:43:10.660 --> 2:43:13.860]  with the blood of patriots and tyrants, the coin I designed.
[2:43:13.860 --> 2:43:17.580]  I'm very, very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible.
[2:43:17.580 --> 2:43:22.700]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[2:43:22.700 --> 2:43:23.980]  we sold it.
[2:43:23.980 --> 2:43:29.660]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly and I appreciate listeners getting
[2:43:29.660 --> 2:43:30.660]  over half of them now.
[2:43:30.660 --> 2:43:32.780]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[2:43:32.780 --> 2:43:37.460]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days and without the last coin
[2:43:37.460 --> 2:43:41.100]  sale we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[2:43:41.100 --> 2:43:43.180]  We'd have had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem.
[2:43:43.180 --> 2:43:47.340]  So as a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom
[2:43:47.340 --> 2:43:50.260]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[2:43:50.260 --> 2:43:57.900]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776coin.com.
[2:43:57.900 --> 2:44:03.420]  Bone broth is back and better than ever and 20% off plus free shipping and double Patriot
[2:44:03.420 --> 2:44:05.100]  points for our new sale.
[2:44:05.100 --> 2:44:08.460]  After years of being off the shelves we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite
[2:44:08.460 --> 2:44:12.140]  formulas ever and it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[2:44:12.140 --> 2:44:18.580]  It's ultimate bone broth plus it's got concentrated high quality chicken broth protein, turmeric
[2:44:18.580 --> 2:44:23.940]  root that's so amazing, chaga musher, beef pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, then
[2:44:23.940 --> 2:44:29.060]  it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes, it's got real organic cocoa
[2:44:29.060 --> 2:44:33.860]  bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[2:44:33.860 --> 2:44:38.060]  It even tastes better than last formula and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:44:38.060 --> 2:44:44.180]  Again it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder for better flavor
[2:44:44.180 --> 2:44:45.180]  and solvability.
[2:44:45.180 --> 2:44:48.740]  You're going to love this and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body,
[2:44:48.740 --> 2:44:52.700]  it does for your bones, it's simply amazing and it helps funding info war.

[2:44:57.460 --> 2:45:02.300]  April 2022 just kicked off and it's already been incredible.
[2:45:02.300 --> 2:45:08.380]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, they along with many other New World Order operatives
[2:45:08.380 --> 2:45:14.900]  have gone on national television and announced that we are now under a world government.
[2:45:14.900 --> 2:45:19.860]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit and
[2:45:19.860 --> 2:45:22.660]  they are announcing incredible tyranny.
[2:45:22.660 --> 2:45:26.380]  Something we've talked about is now coming true and the globalists want to take us off
[2:45:26.380 --> 2:45:27.380]  air.
[2:45:27.380 --> 2:45:33.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of info wars right now.
[2:45:33.140 --> 2:45:39.300]  In our 28 years, all info wars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone
[2:45:39.300 --> 2:45:43.700]  and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps and info wars flags again.
[2:45:43.700 --> 2:45:47.340]  We may have t-shirts and apparel in the future but I don't even know.
[2:45:47.340 --> 2:45:50.460]  We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[2:45:50.460 --> 2:45:55.420]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at infowarstore.com right
[2:45:55.420 --> 2:45:57.820]  now they're at cost.
[2:45:57.820 --> 2:46:06.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history
[2:46:06.540 --> 2:46:11.620]  and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[2:46:11.620 --> 2:46:17.980]  have broken down and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and for operations
[2:46:17.980 --> 2:46:22.580]  and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main
[2:46:22.580 --> 2:46:23.580]  move.
[2:46:23.580 --> 2:46:27.460]  In full wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people
[2:46:27.460 --> 2:46:32.140]  than ever despite the censorship but because of cost increasing and having to run our own
[2:46:32.140 --> 2:46:36.500]  infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of
[2:46:36.500 --> 2:46:37.500]  money solicit.

[2:46:58.780 --> 2:47:14.980]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:14.980 --> 2:47:18.740]  Alright let's continue here with the news coverage and if I can get all the news off
[2:47:18.740 --> 2:47:22.020]  my desk I'll play some of these video clips in the next segment before Wayne Allen Root
[2:47:22.020 --> 2:47:24.220]  takes over.
[2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:29.280]  So what do you do if you're the Democrats and your popularity is plunging and your approval
[2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:34.100]  rating is plunging everywhere and everybody knows how evil lying scum, what evil lying
[2:47:34.100 --> 2:47:35.100]  scum you are.
[2:47:35.100 --> 2:47:41.020]  Chicago to provide free gas and transit cards, so now this is California and Illinois that
[2:47:41.020 --> 2:47:45.580]  have the highest deficit spending rates, the states are actually broke with all their giveaways
[2:47:45.580 --> 2:47:51.340]  and Democrat financial policy just crushing these states and so but what are they gonna
[2:47:51.340 --> 2:47:57.180]  do as they're dead broke, they're giving things away because nobody likes them, that's what
[2:47:57.180 --> 2:48:02.580]  you do, nobody likes you, you just give things away, massive nationwide campaign to take
[2:48:02.580 --> 2:48:09.540]  on Nancy Pelosi and insider trading by Congress, Kevin Freeman, host of economic war room on
[2:48:09.540 --> 2:48:14.180]  the blaze, oh another war room that took our name, that's hilarious, launched a national
[2:48:14.180 --> 2:48:19.420]  campaign slamming Pelosi for protecting corrupt insider trading by members of Congress, almost
[2:48:19.420 --> 2:48:23.380]  two million emails have already been sent to Congress, you know nothing will ever probably
[2:48:23.380 --> 2:48:27.780]  be done about that until we get new leaders elected but it's at least something to let
[2:48:27.780 --> 2:48:31.260]  Congress know where we stand on it.
[2:48:31.260 --> 2:48:37.420]  More of the timeless propaganda for the Illuminati here, maskless Kamala Harris poses for photos
[2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:42.540]  with masked children during visit to DC elementary school, now I've explained why they do this
[2:48:42.540 --> 2:48:48.820]  folks, I'll try to make it brief, you say why do these political leaders go and take
[2:48:48.820 --> 2:48:54.140]  their mask off and pose for pictures with everybody else wearing their mask on, it's
[2:48:54.140 --> 2:49:02.340]  a symbol of dominance is what it is, it's an act of dominance so that a hundred years
[2:49:02.340 --> 2:49:07.260]  from now, just like you can look at photos from a hundred years ago during the Spanish
[2:49:07.260 --> 2:49:12.300]  flu pandemic and you'll see the elites not wearing masks, people in suits and ties not
[2:49:12.300 --> 2:49:17.340]  wearing masks and then everyone else around them in hazmat suits, it's the same thing,
[2:49:17.340 --> 2:49:22.900]  they're marking their territory, they're displaying their dominance so that when they
[2:49:22.900 --> 2:49:29.300]  run the same gambit in 50 or 100 years they can show their agents, see we run this stuff,
[2:49:29.300 --> 2:49:38.860]  we do this, here we did it in the 20s, here we did it in the 2020s, we dominate this planet,
[2:49:38.860 --> 2:49:43.900]  you are now slave owners and all those around you wearing the mask are your slaves and that's
[2:49:43.900 --> 2:49:50.460]  how they promote themselves, that's how they mark their territory in a timeless fashion.
[2:49:50.460 --> 2:49:57.820]  Another has left Kamala Harris' staff, the deputy chief of staff quits 11th aid to leave
[2:49:57.820 --> 2:50:01.660]  Kamala Harris' staff, yeah these people suck, no one wants to work for them and it's now
[2:50:01.660 --> 2:50:08.660]  considered a blithe on your resume or a blight rather than a good thing, confused puppet
[2:50:08.660 --> 2:50:14.060]  Joe Biden end speech, ask handlers what to do now and then creeps on a little girl, that's
[2:50:14.060 --> 2:50:18.020]  what he does, there he is right there getting up in that little girl's face because he's
[2:50:18.020 --> 2:50:22.900]  a creepo, his daughter wrote about it in his diary, how he would get in the shower with
[2:50:22.900 --> 2:50:26.820]  her and be inappropriate, I mean you know this is the Biden's after all, in fact let's
[2:50:26.820 --> 2:50:31.940]  go here, here's another confused Biden in clip 9, I mean this is a joke, the guy doesn't
[2:50:31.940 --> 2:50:34.780]  even know where he is, he doesn't even know who he is, here's another example in clip
[2:50:34.780 --> 2:50:48.380]  9, what do we do now, what do we do now, he has no idea, look at him running around, he
[2:50:48.380 --> 2:50:54.740]  doesn't know what's going on, that's the president they said, Biden tells bizarre story about
[2:50:54.740 --> 2:51:01.140]  big mama and how he used to drive an 18 wheeler, Biden has never driven an 18 wheeler, it's
[2:51:01.140 --> 2:51:05.300]  not an easy thing to do, you need training, he's never done it, he just lies, he lies
[2:51:05.300 --> 2:51:08.780]  about, remember his Amtrak story that he's lied about like five times now, that even
[2:51:08.780 --> 2:51:14.140]  he's been caught lying about it, the guy he claims said this to him has been dead, the
[2:51:14.140 --> 2:51:18.060]  guy's an, but he has dementia, he doesn't even know where he is half the time, he's
[2:51:18.060 --> 2:51:25.260]  got crap running down his leg half the day, Joe Biden takes a knee in official photo with
[2:51:25.260 --> 2:51:30.380]  sailors for some reason, nobody knows why he took the knee, not even him, he just photo
[2:51:30.380 --> 2:51:34.340]  shoot posing with people in the Navy, just decided no, I'm going to take a knee, hey
[2:51:34.340 --> 2:51:41.220]  the George Floyd thing was two years ago, Joe, or more now, but he takes the knee, Hunter
[2:51:41.220 --> 2:51:45.180]  becomes the hunted, Senator Grassley warns of national security concerns surrounding
[2:51:45.180 --> 2:51:52.020]  Biden crime family, says new revelations will be presented to Senate this week, we'll see
[2:51:52.020 --> 2:51:59.220]  how that goes, Biden seemed to be above the law and above any media scorn either, so this
[2:51:59.220 --> 2:52:05.380]  is where it all goes folks, this is what I said earlier, you need to understand this
[2:52:05.380 --> 2:52:13.100]  is where it all goes, so when you ask why this is going on, remind yourself who controls
[2:52:13.100 --> 2:52:18.100]  the culture, who controls the education system and who currently controls the government,
[2:52:18.100 --> 2:52:24.500]  the globalists and the radical left wingers that are destroying our culture, destroying
[2:52:24.500 --> 2:52:31.100]  our country and destroying our people, they did this, all of their logic or illogic, all
[2:52:31.100 --> 2:52:36.100]  of their propaganda, all of their culture, all of it is destructive and deadly and they
[2:52:36.100 --> 2:52:40.620]  know it, they're a death cult, so you want to know why you see stories like this, look
[2:52:40.620 --> 2:52:50.780]  no further than the left, the radical, communist, progressive, sycophant, pedophile left controlling
[2:52:50.780 --> 2:52:57.700]  culture, controlling the education system, this is what you get, why are so many women
[2:52:57.700 --> 2:53:02.140]  in middle ages on antidepressants because the left wing culture has turned them into
[2:53:02.140 --> 2:53:09.260]  mental basket cases, CDC warns of steep decline in teen mental health because the mentally
[2:53:09.260 --> 2:53:16.180]  ill left is indoctrinating them, the mystifying rise of child suicide, again folks this is
[2:53:16.180 --> 2:53:24.380]  all left wing culture destroying people's minds, destroying their psyches, leading them
[2:53:24.380 --> 2:53:29.980]  to suicide and antidepressants, 100% the globalist left wing agenda, that's why they do the
[2:53:29.980 --> 2:53:34.980]  gaslighting, that's why they tell you men aren't women or men are women rather, that's
[2:53:34.980 --> 2:53:38.660]  why they tell you men are women, men can get pregnant, men can have periods, that's why
[2:53:38.660 --> 2:53:42.740]  they tell you all this nonsensical stuff, they want you to go mentally insane so that
[2:53:42.740 --> 2:53:48.300]  you then have to go on their killer pills or you just kill yourself, and that's why
[2:53:48.300 --> 2:53:54.220]  the former French intelligence chief is correct Pierre Brochard when he says all multicultural
[2:53:54.220 --> 2:54:01.300]  societies are doomed, the real quote, the real thing is all diversified left wing liberal
[2:54:01.300 --> 2:54:08.060]  progressive societies are doomed, that's why America's doomed, we've gotten away from
[2:54:08.060 --> 2:54:14.220]  traditionalism, we've gotten away from, it's not even about conservatism or anything about,
[2:54:14.220 --> 2:54:23.100]  it's just what works traditionalism, what works a man and a woman and the nuclear family
[2:54:23.100 --> 2:54:28.940]  and the free market society with good honorable people with integrity, that works, the left
[2:54:28.940 --> 2:54:34.980]  is anti all of that, that's why you have mass suicide rates, children suicide rates, women
[2:54:34.980 --> 2:54:40.420]  on antidepressants, women whoring themselves out on the internet because the left engages
[2:54:40.420 --> 2:54:46.700]  in stuff like this where they say move to New York where you can say gay and they're
[2:54:46.700 --> 2:54:52.340]  just obsessed with, they're just obsessed with sexualizing the children, Seattle museum
[2:54:52.340 --> 2:55:00.060]  hosting sex theme drag camp for children, unbelievable and they're grooming these children
[2:55:00.060 --> 2:55:05.860]  starting at age 12 at this camp on how to be sexual perverts, so it's not sports camp
[2:55:05.860 --> 2:55:12.060]  or arts camp, no it's sex camp for kids now, sex camp for kids brought to you by liberals
[2:55:12.060 --> 2:55:16.460]  and you watch these people all grow up to be pill headed suicide people because that's
[2:55:16.460 --> 2:55:23.100]  what the left wing does folks, they know it, it's a satanic death cult, they put this crap
[2:55:23.100 --> 2:55:31.300]  up in the classrooms, how to be gay, I mean it's just unbelievable, I cannot teach in
[2:55:31.300 --> 2:55:37.100]  Florida, LGBTQ educators, fear fall out from new school law, following the enactment of
[2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:41.580]  what critics call the don't say gay bill, some LGBTQ teachers have quit the profession
[2:55:41.580 --> 2:55:45.340]  all together saying they can't teach now, so what does that tell you folks, it tells
[2:55:45.340 --> 2:55:49.620]  you everything you already knew, all they're teaching is their sexual agenda, all they're
[2:55:49.620 --> 2:55:56.300]  teaching is their left wing indoctrination, they're not educating children, they are indoctrinating
[2:55:56.300 --> 2:56:01.500]  them, they are perverting them, and so Rhonda Sanchez just simply says hey, we're not going
[2:56:01.500 --> 2:56:06.020]  to teach kids about sex up to fourth grade and then all these teachers say well I can't
[2:56:06.020 --> 2:56:12.180]  teach here anymore because it's all they teach, the kid gets there at 9am, salutes and prays
[2:56:12.180 --> 2:56:16.700]  to a gay flag, they get lectured about how gay their teacher is for eight hours, wearing
[2:56:16.700 --> 2:56:23.420]  a mask and then they go home with their gay homework assignment, and so the teachers say
[2:56:23.420 --> 2:56:29.220]  oh, I really don't know how to teach my kids anymore since I can't sexualize them, because
[2:56:29.220 --> 2:56:37.700]  it's all they do, the left, student loans should be forgiven because 18 year olds were
[2:56:37.700 --> 2:56:42.740]  too young to fully understand what they were doing, society failed them, oh okay, also
[2:56:42.740 --> 2:56:46.780]  the left, kids know their true selves, their identity should be affirmed no matter the
[2:56:46.780 --> 2:56:52.900]  cost, discussion and asking questions are hate crimes, so yeah, so 18 year olds that
[2:56:52.900 --> 2:56:57.380]  get a student loan got preyed upon by society, they didn't know what they were doing taking
[2:56:57.380 --> 2:57:02.460]  out a student loan, but hey, if you're an 8 year old kid, you're old enough to be taught
[2:57:02.460 --> 2:57:06.700]  how to masturbate and have anal sex and play with sex toys, because that's the liberal
[2:57:06.700 --> 2:57:12.260]  logic don't you see, GOP congressional candidate believes abortion is a human sacrifice to
[2:57:12.260 --> 2:57:19.980]  demons, Tom Reichert running in Colorado's 7th district is right, parents of high school
[2:57:19.980 --> 2:57:25.780]  track star, sucker punch during race are considering lawsuit against attacker after they were stopped
[2:57:25.780 --> 2:57:30.780]  from pressing charges by cops, so everybody pressed all the clip, the guy racing down
[2:57:30.780 --> 2:57:35.140]  the track, punches out the guy ahead of him, just so happened it was a black guy punching
[2:57:35.140 --> 2:57:39.620]  a white guy, and the parents wanted to press an assault charge, by the way they let the
[2:57:39.620 --> 2:57:43.540]  kid finish the race and win it after he knocked the guy out, and the police said we'll arrest
[2:57:43.540 --> 2:57:47.580]  you if you press charges.

[2:58:51.940 --> 2:59:00.020]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[2:59:00.020 --> 2:59:07.620]  resistance against their transhumanist anti human program and man our work is really right

[3:00:54.420 --> 3:00:58.900]  Let me run through the biggest stories of the day that I think have the most importance
[3:00:58.900 --> 3:01:00.780]  to all of you.
[3:01:00.780 --> 3:01:03.460]  Just turning some lights off here, there we go.
[3:01:03.460 --> 3:01:06.660]  Alright so the biggest stories of the day that I think have importance to all of you.
[3:01:06.660 --> 3:01:11.700]  Number one, there's a Hunter Biden grand jury going on and the witness was asked about a
[3:01:11.700 --> 3:01:17.940]  deal with the big guy, big guy, Joe Biden.
[3:01:17.940 --> 3:01:23.340]  And so for the first time Joe Biden's name has come up in a criminal investigation, an
[3:01:23.340 --> 3:01:29.740]  official grand jury criminal investigation and don't forget Hunter Biden has come up
[3:01:29.740 --> 3:01:34.980]  his name in all of the media stories, the New York Times, Washington Post over the last
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:41.140]  month for the first time ever, there was an admission that the Hunter Biden laptop is
[3:01:41.140 --> 3:01:46.740]  real and I was literally banned for life from Twitter because I brought up Hunter Biden's
[3:01:46.740 --> 3:01:53.260]  laptop and the stolen election and the censorship and the banning and the book burning of liberals
[3:01:53.260 --> 3:01:54.980]  trying to destroy us all.
[3:01:54.980 --> 3:01:59.780]  And Twitter confirmed that I'm right by banning me for life and it turned out everything I
[3:01:59.780 --> 3:02:00.780]  said was right.
[3:02:00.780 --> 3:02:05.060]  Like there were three things I brought up that I felt led to my banning for life from
[3:02:05.060 --> 3:02:06.060]  Twitter.
[3:02:06.060 --> 3:02:09.540]  Number one, the election was rigged and stolen in 2020.
[3:02:09.540 --> 3:02:14.700]  Number two, Hunter Biden's laptop was covered up and number three, lockdowns are massive
[3:02:14.700 --> 3:02:21.740]  failures and did not work in 2020 against COVID and all three resulted in suspensions
[3:02:21.740 --> 3:02:26.540]  of me by Twitter and eventually they banned me for life.
[3:02:26.540 --> 3:02:32.540]  So no question in my mind, I was right on all three, proven right on all three.
[3:02:32.540 --> 3:02:35.060]  But the big news story is Joe Biden's being brought up.
[3:02:35.060 --> 3:02:36.060]  Why?
[3:02:36.060 --> 3:02:40.140]  Why is the Hunter Biden laptop finally being acknowledged as real a year and a half after
[3:02:40.140 --> 3:02:41.140]  the election?
[3:02:41.140 --> 3:02:45.260]  Why is Joe Biden's name being brought into a criminal investigation?
[3:02:45.260 --> 3:02:47.700]  Well, number one, because it's all true.
[3:02:47.700 --> 3:02:53.500]  And number two, because for the first time, the liberal left is realizing that Joe Biden's
[3:02:53.500 --> 3:02:56.300]  leading them to a massive defeat.
[3:02:56.300 --> 3:02:58.540]  I mean, a landslide massive defeat.
[3:02:58.540 --> 3:03:00.820]  So they're looking to get rid of Joe Biden.
[3:03:00.820 --> 3:03:03.700]  And the first guy in the country said that was me months ago.
[3:03:03.700 --> 3:03:05.380]  I said, Joe Biden's gone.
[3:03:05.380 --> 3:03:09.100]  I made a guess that maybe Hillary Clinton would be the one to somehow replace him.
[3:03:09.100 --> 3:03:13.140]  I'm not sure how they're going to do it, but they're going to replace Joe Biden and Kamala
[3:03:13.140 --> 3:03:17.820]  because Kamala is the most hated human being in the history of the world.
[3:03:17.820 --> 3:03:23.420]  Everybody knows that she's unqualified for the presidency, incompetent, incredibly not
[3:03:23.420 --> 3:03:24.420]  bright.
[3:03:24.420 --> 3:03:30.020]  I'll say stupid, but I'll try to be nice and just say not a very bright person and that
[3:03:30.020 --> 3:03:31.860]  she is just disliked by everyone.
[3:03:31.860 --> 3:03:34.580]  I don't know why it took them till now to figure it out.
[3:03:34.580 --> 3:03:37.140]  She's black, a half black, half Indian.
[3:03:37.140 --> 3:03:41.940]  And yet in the Democrat primary, where blacks make up a huge portion of the electorate, she
[3:03:41.940 --> 3:03:45.820]  got no black votes and had to drop out before the first primary.
[3:03:45.820 --> 3:03:48.980]  She was completely disliked by black Democrat voters.
[3:03:48.980 --> 3:03:51.020]  So why anyone thought she'd make a good VP?
[3:03:51.020 --> 3:03:52.020]  I have no idea.
[3:03:52.020 --> 3:03:57.740]  The end result is if the media is on your side, they can lie about anything and everything.
[3:03:57.740 --> 3:04:05.100]  So they're finally acknowledging Hunter and Joe Biden for a specific reason, and Hunter
[3:04:05.100 --> 3:04:09.060]  Biden's laptop for a specific reason, Hunter Biden's corruption and Joe Biden being the
[3:04:09.060 --> 3:04:10.060]  big guy.
[3:04:10.060 --> 3:04:11.460]  They got to get rid of Joe Biden.
[3:04:11.460 --> 3:04:13.060]  They got to bury Joe Biden.
[3:04:13.060 --> 3:04:16.620]  They got to throw grandpa from the train or the plane.
[3:04:16.620 --> 3:04:20.980]  Was that the Sly Sloan movie that was a big bomb about 30 years ago, throw grandpa from
[3:04:20.980 --> 3:04:21.980]  the train?
[3:04:21.980 --> 3:04:22.980]  I think it was.
[3:04:22.980 --> 3:04:26.460]  And so I'm telling you, Joe Biden needs to be thrown under the bus.
[3:04:26.460 --> 3:04:32.420]  If they have any chance at surviving the midterms and after that, any chance of winning in 2024,
[3:04:32.420 --> 3:04:35.940]  the whole country's a raid against the Democrat party now.
[3:04:35.940 --> 3:04:40.580]  They've got to get rid of Biden and they've got to somehow figure out the game plan to
[3:04:40.580 --> 3:04:45.460]  replace him and his vice president because Kamala is incompetent and hated even more
[3:04:45.460 --> 3:04:46.460]  than Biden.
[3:04:46.460 --> 3:04:48.940]  All right, we're heading out for a break when I get back.
[3:04:48.940 --> 3:04:51.260]  I've got a commentary called defund Disney.
[3:04:51.260 --> 3:04:59.340]  I bet you can't wait defund Disney when we get back introducing the newest product from

[3:05:55.540 --> 3:06:04.180]  All right, we're back, Wayne Elleruth for Alex Jones.
[3:06:04.180 --> 3:06:06.740]  We jumped in so quickly in segment one.
[3:06:06.740 --> 3:06:09.260]  I was in the process of just getting ready.
[3:06:09.260 --> 3:06:10.260]  Now I'm settled in.
[3:06:10.260 --> 3:06:11.980]  Now I know what I've got to talk about.
[3:06:11.980 --> 3:06:16.900]  So I wanted to jump to Disney, jump for the big story about Joe Biden being the big guy
[3:06:16.900 --> 3:06:18.660]  and the end of the Joe Biden administration.
[3:06:18.660 --> 3:06:24.180]  It's coming fast, fast and furious as the movie says they've got to get rid of Joe Biden.
[3:06:24.180 --> 3:06:27.780]  But let's jump to Disney because I've never in my life seen anything like this.
[3:06:27.780 --> 3:06:30.100]  You know, I've never been an anti gay guy.
[3:06:30.100 --> 3:06:31.780]  I've always been a live and let live guy.
[3:06:31.780 --> 3:06:36.940]  I've been a lifelong Republican conservative, but with libertarian leanings on some social
[3:06:36.940 --> 3:06:37.940]  issues.
[3:06:37.940 --> 3:06:43.060]  And as an example, I was the libertarian vice presidential nominee in 2008.
[3:06:43.060 --> 3:06:47.940]  So some of you may not know it, but I was on the ticket in 2008 when McCain ran against
[3:06:47.940 --> 3:06:50.460]  Obama was Bob Barr and Wayne Elleruth.
[3:06:50.460 --> 3:06:51.460]  And that's me.
[3:06:51.460 --> 3:06:55.140]  And when it comes to gay issues, I'm not programmed that it's a gay.
[3:06:55.140 --> 3:06:57.320]  I just say live and let live.
[3:06:57.320 --> 3:06:59.540]  You want to be gay, be gay.
[3:06:59.540 --> 3:07:01.420]  You want to be lesbian, be lesbian.
[3:07:01.420 --> 3:07:02.980]  You want to be transsexual.
[3:07:02.980 --> 3:07:03.980]  It's weird.
[3:07:03.980 --> 3:07:04.980]  It's strange.
[3:07:04.980 --> 3:07:05.980]  It's confused.
[3:07:05.980 --> 3:07:07.380]  I think it's mental illness.
[3:07:07.380 --> 3:07:09.060]  And if you want to be, be it.
[3:07:09.060 --> 3:07:10.260]  You just changed my screen.
[3:07:10.260 --> 3:07:11.260]  So there we go.
[3:07:11.260 --> 3:07:12.260]  There we go.
[3:07:12.260 --> 3:07:13.260]  It's back.
[3:07:13.260 --> 3:07:14.260]  Now I can see what I'm looking at.
[3:07:14.260 --> 3:07:18.340]  So, okay, you want to be transsexual, be transsexual.
[3:07:18.340 --> 3:07:22.700]  But number one, if it affects me, it's a different story.
[3:07:22.700 --> 3:07:25.100]  If it doesn't affect me, if you're gay in your bedroom, I don't see it.
[3:07:25.100 --> 3:07:26.100]  I don't care.
[3:07:26.100 --> 3:07:27.100]  None of my business.
[3:07:27.100 --> 3:07:29.380]  But you have no right.
[3:07:29.380 --> 3:07:31.980]  First of all, I've always argued about transsexual issues.
[3:07:31.980 --> 3:07:35.900]  You have no right to stuff men down by throat in a women's bathroom.
[3:07:35.900 --> 3:07:40.380]  You have no right to stuff men down little girl's throats in a locker room setting, in
[3:07:40.380 --> 3:07:43.860]  a sports setting, on a field trip setting.
[3:07:43.860 --> 3:07:45.140]  Men can't be women.
[3:07:45.140 --> 3:07:46.740]  Little boys can't be girls.
[3:07:46.740 --> 3:07:48.660]  And I had all my daughters.
[3:07:48.660 --> 3:07:53.620]  And you have no right to take little girls' scholarships away and trophies away when boys
[3:07:53.620 --> 3:07:55.300]  start playing girl sports.
[3:07:55.300 --> 3:07:57.280]  All of that is nuts.
[3:07:57.280 --> 3:08:01.540]  Number two, you have no right to stuff transgenders down the military's throat.
[3:08:01.540 --> 3:08:05.140]  You have no right to say transgender should be in the military because if they're in
[3:08:05.140 --> 3:08:11.580]  the military, the reason why isn't because they're brave heroes, it's because they want
[3:08:11.580 --> 3:08:20.060]  free transgender surgery, sex change surgery costs 100 to $150,000.
[3:08:20.060 --> 3:08:21.060]  Look at your screen.
[3:08:21.060 --> 3:08:22.660]  Aren't you proud of that?
[3:08:22.660 --> 3:08:24.820]  There's your military dollars in action.
[3:08:24.820 --> 3:08:26.460]  But here's the deal.
[3:08:26.460 --> 3:08:27.740]  You could be what you want to be.
[3:08:27.740 --> 3:08:32.860]  This person could be whoever they want to be, strange, weird to normal people, but you
[3:08:32.860 --> 3:08:38.900]  have no right to take my taxpayer money and have a sex change operation in the military
[3:08:38.900 --> 3:08:40.580]  or in prison.
[3:08:40.580 --> 3:08:45.140]  No taxpayer dollars should ever be spent because a person's mixed up and confused what their
[3:08:45.140 --> 3:08:46.980]  sexual identity is.
[3:08:46.980 --> 3:08:48.580]  So I'm not anti-gay.
[3:08:48.580 --> 3:08:51.660]  I'm anti-all of that, which is ridiculous.
[3:08:51.660 --> 3:08:58.060]  Now along comes this new stuff that I had no idea, that our children were being groomed
[3:08:58.060 --> 3:09:01.660]  in kindergarten, first grade, second grade, and third grade.
[3:09:01.660 --> 3:09:08.540]  It's literally to be gay, to be lesbian, to be transgender, to change their sexual identity
[3:09:08.540 --> 3:09:11.260]  and to think that's a good thing.
[3:09:11.260 --> 3:09:14.820]  And I don't believe there's very many parents in America who approve of that.
[3:09:14.820 --> 3:09:19.020]  Liberal or conservative, I think the Virginia election proved that while the mama bears
[3:09:19.020 --> 3:09:24.220]  came out and they elected the Republican governor of Virginia that no one thought was possible.
[3:09:24.220 --> 3:09:26.180]  No one thought it was even possible.
[3:09:26.180 --> 3:09:29.260]  Virginia's become not purple, but a blue state.
[3:09:29.260 --> 3:09:33.700]  But yet it turned big time red, they elected a Republican governor and an old Republican
[3:09:33.700 --> 3:09:40.100]  legislature over the issues of critical race theory in school, school closures for COVID,
[3:09:40.100 --> 3:09:45.300]  masks in school, vaccines in school, and transgender sexual identity education taught
[3:09:45.300 --> 3:09:46.300]  in school.
[3:09:46.300 --> 3:09:51.380]  All of that led to all the mothers of Virginia switching to the Republican Party.
[3:09:51.380 --> 3:09:56.980]  So if Democrats want to make this their hill to die on, as the saying goes, fame is saying,
[3:09:56.980 --> 3:10:01.260]  and I'm not talking about violence here, I'm not talking about murdering anybody, please
[3:10:01.260 --> 3:10:06.780]  don't misconstrue my words, a hill to die on is one of the most famous sayings in history.
[3:10:06.780 --> 3:10:12.220]  And if Democrats want to make this issue their hill to die on, I'm talking about the political
[3:10:12.220 --> 3:10:17.620]  party's death, I'm talking about their campaigns being destroyed, then you make it the hill
[3:10:17.620 --> 3:10:24.100]  to die on, I'm all for it, I'm cheering you, I'm gonna high five you, it's great, make
[3:10:24.100 --> 3:10:33.100]  it the hill to die on, make it the centerpiece issue of the Democrat Party, that transsexuality,
[3:10:33.100 --> 3:10:42.780]  transgender identity, changing your sexual identification, gay and lesbian education
[3:10:42.780 --> 3:10:48.060]  from kindergarten through third grade should be taught in all the schools, you do that
[3:10:48.060 --> 3:10:52.780]  and you watch what happens in November, you're gonna lose all 50 states, you're not gonna
[3:10:52.780 --> 3:10:59.820]  lose 50, 60 seats in a house landslide, you're gonna lose 80 to 100 seats in a house landslide,
[3:10:59.820 --> 3:11:05.540]  you're gonna lose the Senate by 10 seats, you're gonna be slaughtered politically, destroyed,
[3:11:05.540 --> 3:11:12.060]  demolished, the end of the Democrat Party, because American parents don't support this
[3:11:12.060 --> 3:11:18.300]  kind of mental illness, they don't support grooming and brainwashing their children.
[3:11:18.300 --> 3:11:25.220]  And so shocking to me was Disney deciding to get involved in this thing, and it's interesting
[3:11:25.220 --> 3:11:30.500]  because I wrote a book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book, that identifies all the
[3:11:30.500 --> 3:11:36.260]  companies in America that take our dollars as conservatives, patriots, Christians, people
[3:11:36.260 --> 3:11:40.700]  who love this country and American exceptionalism, they take our dollars, they get rich, their
[3:11:40.700 --> 3:11:45.580]  stocks go up, they make a lot of money, everybody gets rich on us, and then they spit in our
[3:11:45.580 --> 3:11:51.660]  faces, and I identified 116 woke companies that do that, and Disney was right at the
[3:11:51.660 --> 3:11:57.100]  top of the list, and I gave you the phone number and the names of Disney CEO and chairman
[3:11:57.100 --> 3:12:01.220]  of the board and board of directors, and I give you their email, their phone number,
[3:12:01.220 --> 3:12:06.460]  their social media sites and their physical address for snail mail to go after them, to
[3:12:06.460 --> 3:12:11.460]  let them know we're gonna boycott them, never buy from them again and put them out of business
[3:12:11.460 --> 3:12:17.300]  with their sick mentally ill political views, and Disney's right at the top of the list,
[3:12:17.300 --> 3:12:22.140]  so please check out my book, Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book, it's the perfect
[3:12:22.140 --> 3:12:27.220]  book for the perfect time to defund Disney, the worst idea in the history of the world
[3:12:27.220 --> 3:12:32.100]  was to defund the police, and the result is all over the United States, blue cities run
[3:12:32.100 --> 3:12:42.020]  by Democrats are being destroyed by crime, violent crime, murders, gangs, gang rapes,
[3:12:42.020 --> 3:12:47.740]  home invasions, shoplifting, not just shoplifting like I'm grabbing one bottle of soda, I'm
[3:12:47.740 --> 3:12:59.260]  talking as you all know, gangs of thugs running into stores and with hammers and axes and
[3:12:59.260 --> 3:13:04.220]  pickaxes and whatever they've got their hands on, they're breaking the case, they're stealing
[3:13:04.220 --> 3:13:09.980]  a million dollars in jewelry, or they're cleaning out drugstores of $1500 worth of goods, because
[3:13:09.980 --> 3:13:16.420]  anything below 1500 is just a ticket, an appearance ticket or anything below 1200 or 1000, every
[3:13:16.420 --> 3:13:21.900]  city has a different number, but they basically all these Democrat cities have legalized crime
[3:13:21.900 --> 3:13:27.620]  and they've legalized shoplifting, so what's happened is Democrat cities have been just
[3:13:27.620 --> 3:13:33.140]  destroyed, destroyed, it's a terrible thing, and our country is being destroyed by the
[3:13:33.140 --> 3:13:34.140]  Democrat Party.
[3:13:34.140 --> 3:13:40.060]  When I get back, we got about what, two minutes to go, I'm gonna read you defund, gonna read
[3:13:40.060 --> 3:13:46.260]  you defund Disney, my latest commentary, what we've got to do to defund Disney and how wrong
[3:13:46.260 --> 3:13:51.340]  they are, but on the way out here, I wanna mention the funniest story of the week, because
[3:13:51.340 --> 3:13:56.620]  it involves what Disney believes in, that they've gotta stop this new Florida law at
[3:13:56.620 --> 3:14:02.420]  all costs, Disney will put all their prestige and credibility and power and money behind
[3:14:02.420 --> 3:14:07.460]  stopping the wonderful new law in Florida by Governor Ron DeSantis, that should be the
[3:14:07.460 --> 3:14:11.520]  law of the land, it should not be the law of Florida, it should be the law of every
[3:14:11.520 --> 3:14:17.060]  state in America that you cannot groom and brainwash children between kindergarten and
[3:14:17.060 --> 3:14:21.260]  third grade, and it should be the law, you can't brainwash them between kindergarten
[3:14:21.260 --> 3:14:28.260]  and 12th grade in all 50 states, it's not a school's job to say gay is bad, transgender
[3:14:28.260 --> 3:14:35.020]  is bad, or gay is good, transgender is good, public schools should stay completely out
[3:14:35.020 --> 3:14:42.140]  of politics and religion, it's none of their business, it's parents' job to teach children
[3:14:42.140 --> 3:14:48.220]  whether gay is good or gay is bad, none of your business, and transgenders, kindergartners
[3:14:48.220 --> 3:14:51.500]  don't need to know about it, and it shouldn't be taught anymore.
[3:14:51.500 --> 3:14:57.620]  But the mayor, one minute to go, the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, who was supposed
[3:14:57.620 --> 3:15:02.540]  to be a moderate Democrat, is now paying for a billboard campaign in Florida, that if you
[3:15:02.540 --> 3:15:07.460]  don't like how they're treating you as a gay person, please move to New York, and I'm
[3:15:07.460 --> 3:15:12.980]  just laughing, first of all, there's no parent, no normal parent in America that doesn't like
[3:15:12.980 --> 3:15:19.380]  this new law in Florida, none, so it shows that Eric Adams was a liar and a fraud, he's
[3:15:19.380 --> 3:15:24.180]  not a moderate, and he has bad taste, he has no clue what people believe in, he's on the
[3:15:24.180 --> 3:15:29.700]  wrong side of this issue, by a mile, by a landslide, but more importantly, if you live
[3:15:29.700 --> 3:15:35.660]  in Florida and you want children to be brainwashed, to change their sexual identity, like I change
[3:15:35.660 --> 3:15:39.540]  a pair of socks, then it's the best thing that ever happened to Florida, that all those
[3:15:39.540 --> 3:15:44.820]  people believe that should move to New York, good luck to New York, goodbye New York, have
[3:15:44.820 --> 3:15:45.820]  a nice life.
[3:15:45.820 --> 3:15:51.620]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root, and I'll be right back, guest host for Alex Jones today, rootforamerica.com,
[3:15:51.620 --> 3:16:20.940]  Wade Root at gmail.com.
[3:16:22.620 --> 3:16:29.220]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless, they need all their
[3:16:29.220 --> 3:16:34.180]  propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death, because
[3:16:34.180 --> 3:16:39.900]  they know we are strong, and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world,
[3:16:39.900 --> 3:16:44.060]  who is a loser, and that's why it's so important that everybody keep in full wars in the air
[3:16:44.060 --> 3:16:48.940]  now more than ever, because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting
[3:16:48.940 --> 3:16:53.820]  setting up is they can, and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the
[3:16:53.820 --> 3:16:55.500]  beast they just announced.
[3:16:55.500 --> 3:17:03.780]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[3:17:03.780 --> 3:17:09.740]  Coin, and it sold out in 10 days, and if it wasn't for listeners getting this original,
[3:17:09.740 --> 3:17:14.820]  powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[3:17:14.820 --> 3:17:20.100]  But now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered, and it will probably
[3:17:20.100 --> 3:17:22.420]  sell out in 10 days again.
[3:17:22.420 --> 3:17:24.900]  It certainly needs to be front of operation.
[3:17:24.900 --> 3:17:29.940]  It is so historic, and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[3:17:29.940 --> 3:17:33.780]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more.
[3:17:33.780 --> 3:17:41.020]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com, it's also at infowarstore.com, it's amazing,
[3:17:41.020 --> 3:17:45.540]  there's only 10,000 of them, and as a founding member if we're able to stay on the air, we're
[3:17:45.540 --> 3:17:50.820]  planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[3:17:50.820 --> 3:17:55.980]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[3:17:55.980 --> 3:18:04.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20-year history,
[3:18:04.820 --> 3:18:09.780]  and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[3:18:09.780 --> 3:18:15.700]  are broken down, and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[3:18:15.700 --> 3:18:20.620]  operations, and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making
[3:18:20.620 --> 3:18:21.620]  their main move.
[3:18:21.620 --> 3:18:25.900]  Info wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[3:18:25.900 --> 3:18:30.380]  ever despite the censorship, but because of the cost increasing and having to run our
[3:18:30.380 --> 3:18:35.300]  own infrastructure, pay for our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money.
[3:18:35.300 --> 3:18:41.980]  So listen, up to 75% off infowarstore.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that
[3:18:41.980 --> 3:18:47.740]  help spread the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films, everything
[3:18:47.740 --> 3:18:53.900]  is 25 to 75% off right now, the biggest sell in our history at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:53.900 --> 3:18:55.660]  Thank you for your support.
[3:18:55.660 --> 3:19:03.820]  In December of 2021, info wars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 anti-tire
[3:19:03.820 --> 3:19:07.180]  cent coin, and it sold out in 10 days.
[3:19:07.180 --> 3:19:11.740]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[3:19:11.740 --> 3:19:15.180]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[3:19:15.180 --> 3:19:20.500]  Now the second coin, the Liberty Tree coin is being offered and it will probably sell
[3:19:20.500 --> 3:19:22.560]  out in 10 days again.
[3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:25.060]  It certainly needs to in front of operation.
[3:19:25.060 --> 3:19:30.060]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the tree of liberty
[3:19:30.060 --> 3:19:33.940]  being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[3:19:33.940 --> 3:19:37.940]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[3:19:37.940 --> 3:19:40.220]  It's also at infowarstore.com.

[3:19:45.700 --> 3:19:50.980]  planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[3:19:50.980 --> 3:19:56.740]  So get your new tree of liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[3:19:56.740 --> 3:20:03.740]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:03.740 --> 3:20:14.380]  All right, I'm back, Wayne Alleroot back for segment number three.
[3:20:14.380 --> 3:20:18.860]  Great to be guest host on Tuesdays for the Alex Jones show on a regular basis.
[3:20:18.860 --> 3:20:23.660]  Thank you, Alex, for a wonderful opportunity to get my views out there to the whole world
[3:20:23.660 --> 3:20:27.060]  and I know the whole world's watching, I've mentioned this on your show before.
[3:20:27.060 --> 3:20:28.860]  Years ago, I used to go on Fox News a lot.
[3:20:28.860 --> 3:20:33.460]  I was on a lot of big Fox News shows from Glenn Beck to Sean Hannity to you name it,
[3:20:33.460 --> 3:20:37.020]  all the big names on Fox and Friends in the morning all the time.
[3:20:37.020 --> 3:20:44.740]  And every time I went on, I would get 20 to 30, once in a while as many as 50 text emails
[3:20:44.740 --> 3:20:51.940]  and phone calls from friends and fans, many of whom were friends from high school, junior
[3:20:51.940 --> 3:20:56.180]  high school, elementary school, who hadn't seen me or spoken to me in years and say,
[3:20:56.180 --> 3:21:01.860]  oh my gosh, you're famous, I just saw Wayne on Fox News, I can't believe it, you're great.
[3:21:01.860 --> 3:21:02.860]  And that would be great.
[3:21:02.860 --> 3:21:06.700]  That was the proof to me how powerful Fox News was.
[3:21:06.700 --> 3:21:13.460]  Nothing else I ever went on would get me 30 to 50 people saying, Wayne, I just saw you
[3:21:13.460 --> 3:21:18.860]  until I did Alex Jones as guest host and as a guest on Alex Jones.
[3:21:18.860 --> 3:21:22.620]  And suddenly, everyone I've ever known in my life comes out of the woodwork and says,
[3:21:22.620 --> 3:21:24.780]  I saw you at Alex Jones today.
[3:21:24.780 --> 3:21:31.500]  That just tells you that Alex Jones is kind of the secret passion of so many people in
[3:21:31.500 --> 3:21:35.700]  this country who maybe don't brag to everyone in the world, they watch him because they're
[3:21:35.700 --> 3:21:37.820]  nervous of what people think.
[3:21:37.820 --> 3:21:39.900]  They're nervous to say I'm a Trump fan.
[3:21:39.900 --> 3:21:42.740]  They're nervous to say I'm a Republican or a conservative.
[3:21:42.740 --> 3:21:49.300]  They're nervous to say I don't support transgender education to kindergartners.
[3:21:49.300 --> 3:21:51.460]  They're scared to lose their jobs.
[3:21:51.460 --> 3:21:53.860]  And Alex Jones is high up on that list.
[3:21:53.860 --> 3:22:00.940]  They may be scared to tell the world I watch Alex Jones every day, but they do clearly
[3:22:00.940 --> 3:22:07.180]  because I get as many people seeing me on this as I've ever gotten on Fox News or anything
[3:22:07.180 --> 3:22:09.420]  else I've ever done in my entire life.
[3:22:09.420 --> 3:22:12.140]  So that's the deal.
[3:22:12.140 --> 3:22:14.580]  Some of the stories that are important out there, remember I said at the beginning of
[3:22:14.580 --> 3:22:20.140]  the show that I said the election was rigged and stolen in 2020.
[3:22:20.140 --> 3:22:25.300]  And of course, the media ignored it and told me I'm a terrible person and I'm a fool and
[3:22:25.300 --> 3:22:26.900]  I'm a liar.
[3:22:26.900 --> 3:22:31.540]  So many things came out in the last week that would back up my claims.
[3:22:31.540 --> 3:22:39.500]  First of all, an organized crime was perpetrated on Americans, experts on voting fraud, testified
[3:22:39.500 --> 3:22:43.100]  in Wisconsin in front of the state legislature yesterday.
[3:22:43.100 --> 3:22:47.500]  And they said an organized crime was perpetrated on Americans.
[3:22:47.500 --> 3:22:55.420]  At least 4.8 million ballots were trafficked in the 2020 election.
[3:22:55.420 --> 3:23:00.620]  This was Catherine Inglebrecht and Greg Phillips from True the Vote testified in front of the
[3:23:00.620 --> 3:23:08.740]  campaign and elections committees in Wisconsin about ballot drop boxes and ballot trafficking.
[3:23:08.740 --> 3:23:15.580]  And they've got the proof that there were so many fraudulent by the millions ballots
[3:23:15.580 --> 3:23:17.620]  trafficked in the United States.
[3:23:17.620 --> 3:23:22.580]  The exact thing I warned about and reported on and said happened is true.
[3:23:22.580 --> 3:23:29.180]  Here's a Pennsylvania story, hundreds of suspects filmed stuffing multiple ballots into Pennsylvania
[3:23:29.180 --> 3:23:34.260]  County drop boxes and they've got them on tape.
[3:23:34.260 --> 3:23:39.460]  So again, and the stories keep coming up and coming up and coming up, I have so many in
[3:23:39.460 --> 3:23:45.900]  front of me, I'm trying to find more of them breaking exclusive.
[3:23:45.900 --> 3:23:52.260]  The U.S. Postal Service is withholding investigative report on the whistleblower truck driver who
[3:23:52.260 --> 3:24:01.940]  says he hold 288,000 suspicious ballots across state lines before the 2020 election implicated
[3:24:01.940 --> 3:24:03.620]  Democrats in Georgia.
[3:24:03.620 --> 3:24:10.900]  Georgia ballot traffickers were using Democrat officials offices as their home base during
[3:24:10.900 --> 3:24:12.220]  ballot drop runs.
[3:24:12.220 --> 3:24:15.300]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[3:24:15.300 --> 3:24:19.820]  The election was stolen, the election was stolen, the election was stolen.
[3:24:19.820 --> 3:24:26.060]  And the number one thing you need to ask every Republican running for every office in America
[3:24:26.060 --> 3:24:32.740]  in every GOP primary coming up this year in the coming few weeks and months is do you believe
[3:24:32.740 --> 3:24:39.620]  the 2020 election was rigged and stolen against President Trump and any candidate who says
[3:24:39.620 --> 3:24:45.620]  no or who hymns and hoes or whose talks in a circle and won't give you an answer, knock
[3:24:45.620 --> 3:24:48.140]  them out, never let them win.
[3:24:48.140 --> 3:24:53.220]  We don't want one candidate running for office as a Republican who won't admit the election
[3:24:53.220 --> 3:24:54.220]  was stolen.
[3:24:54.220 --> 3:24:56.980]  And why did they rig and steal the election?
[3:24:56.980 --> 3:25:04.060]  It's happening right now so they can brainwash your children with transgender and with sexual
[3:25:04.060 --> 3:25:05.980]  identity education.
[3:25:05.980 --> 3:25:09.380]  And so they could brainwash your children with critical race theory.
[3:25:09.380 --> 3:25:14.860]  And so they can mask us and vaccine mandate us and lock us down for the rest of our lives.
[3:25:14.860 --> 3:25:18.300]  And so they can open the borders and let everyone in.
[3:25:18.300 --> 3:25:23.900]  So no Republican will ever win an election again and you change the demographics of America.
[3:25:23.900 --> 3:25:26.820]  So America isn't filled with Americans anymore.
[3:25:26.820 --> 3:25:32.700]  It's filled with foreigners who actually hate America and hate you and want to outvote
[3:25:32.700 --> 3:25:37.780]  you and give themselves welfare for the rest of their lives while you starve and the money's
[3:25:37.780 --> 3:25:42.060]  redistributed from you to them as an American citizen to an illegal alien.
[3:25:42.060 --> 3:25:45.220]  That's why they rigged and stole the election.
[3:25:45.220 --> 3:25:49.020]  And I don't know if even winning big in November will change that.
[3:25:49.020 --> 3:25:50.540]  But sure, we've got to do it.
[3:25:50.540 --> 3:25:54.740]  We have no choice because the alternative is to lose in November if Republicans don't
[3:25:54.740 --> 3:25:58.060]  win in a landslide whiteout in November.
[3:25:58.060 --> 3:25:59.540]  It's all over.
[3:25:59.540 --> 3:26:00.540]  America's finished.
[3:26:00.540 --> 3:26:02.980]  And America may be finished right now.
[3:26:02.980 --> 3:26:05.020]  May 23rd is the date.
[3:26:05.020 --> 3:26:06.980]  Title 42 will be removed.
[3:26:06.980 --> 3:26:11.580]  And Joe Biden is going to let the entire world overrun America.
[3:26:11.580 --> 3:26:17.780]  And we found out today from Homeland Security leak documents, this is their plan.
[3:26:17.780 --> 3:26:21.380]  I keep trying to tell you this is their plan.
[3:26:21.380 --> 3:26:23.860]  I learned it at Columbia University.
[3:26:23.860 --> 3:26:30.740]  I graduated, I was attended Columbia 79 through 83, graduated class of 83 with my supposed
[3:26:30.740 --> 3:26:35.540]  classmate, Barack Hussein Obama.
[3:26:35.540 --> 3:26:38.900]  And what did I learn at Columbia, clowered piven.
[3:26:38.900 --> 3:26:45.020]  Clowered piven is a plan to destroy the United States by overwhelming the system with people
[3:26:45.020 --> 3:26:46.460]  on welfare.
[3:26:46.460 --> 3:26:50.740]  And they figured out all these years later that if they can't do it with Americans on
[3:26:50.740 --> 3:26:56.740]  welfare, they will open the borders and let every foreigner in the world in and destroy
[3:26:56.740 --> 3:27:03.660]  America by getting every foreigner, every illegal alien they let in on welfare and food stamps
[3:27:03.660 --> 3:27:08.620]  and housing allowances and aid to dependent children and free medical that will wipe us
[3:27:08.620 --> 3:27:14.380]  out and destroy our hospitals and free public schools for their kids that will wipe us out
[3:27:14.380 --> 3:27:18.380]  and bankrupt the school system and give them free college.
[3:27:18.380 --> 3:27:23.740]  Being free, you can ever give them, they'll give them insanity, insanity.
[3:27:23.740 --> 3:27:24.740]  What's our time?
[3:27:24.740 --> 3:27:25.740]  How much time we have left?
[3:27:25.740 --> 3:27:26.740]  One third.
[3:27:26.740 --> 3:27:27.740]  Minute or so.
[3:27:27.740 --> 3:27:32.580]  All right, here's another story I got right.
[3:27:32.580 --> 3:27:38.620]  I said that Democrat cities are going to be overwhelmed with crime and homelessness.
[3:27:38.620 --> 3:27:44.980]  Seattle's crime surge spreads statewide thanks to Democrats progressive policies.
[3:27:44.980 --> 3:27:52.140]  Should I tell you that George Soros was putting money to elect Democrat district attorneys
[3:27:52.140 --> 3:27:57.020]  who are really communist and they're going to let every criminal out, even murderers
[3:27:57.020 --> 3:28:01.380]  and rapists and violent carjackers and violent home invaders.
[3:28:01.380 --> 3:28:07.100]  And that will lead to a massive surge of crime like nobody has ever seen before.
[3:28:07.100 --> 3:28:11.060]  And that's exactly what's happening in every big city in this country.
[3:28:11.060 --> 3:28:14.860]  You think of Chicago, you think of Baltimore, you think of Detroit, you think of New York,
[3:28:14.860 --> 3:28:19.340]  you think LA, but you think of Newark or Camden or New Orleans.
[3:28:19.340 --> 3:28:22.860]  You don't really think of Seattle as being one of those cities.
[3:28:22.860 --> 3:28:27.740]  Seattle is overrun with crime because every criminal gets out.
[3:28:27.740 --> 3:28:31.700]  You don't think of my hometown as Las Vegas as being overrun with crime.
[3:28:31.700 --> 3:28:36.500]  Our strip is overrun with crime and a homeless vagrant stamped to death an off duty police
[3:28:36.500 --> 3:28:40.340]  officer just days ago on the Vegas strip.
[3:28:40.340 --> 3:28:45.660]  If a police officer isn't safe walking the Vegas strip among crowds, what hope is there
[3:28:45.660 --> 3:28:47.220]  for the rest of us?
[3:28:47.220 --> 3:28:50.340]  That's how bad it's getting in the United States of America.
[3:28:50.340 --> 3:28:53.700]  Thanks to lenient criminal policies by Democrats.
[3:28:53.700 --> 3:28:54.700]  We'll be right back.
[3:28:54.700 --> 3:28:56.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[3:28:56.820 --> 3:29:00.260]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[3:29:00.260 --> 3:29:04.260]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[3:29:04.260 --> 3:29:05.460]  I was born for this.
[3:29:05.460 --> 3:29:06.460]  You were born for this.
[3:29:06.460 --> 3:29:11.580]  People are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure because
[3:29:11.580 --> 3:29:15.620]  of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[3:29:15.620 --> 3:29:20.300]  And now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[3:29:20.300 --> 3:29:26.220]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[3:29:26.220 --> 3:29:27.220]  of charge.
[3:29:27.220 --> 3:29:33.700]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22 info wars and Band-Aid video have
[3:29:33.700 --> 3:29:39.220]  become a mothership promoting the pro human liberty movement worldwide, but the expenses
[3:29:39.220 --> 3:29:43.700]  in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[3:29:43.700 --> 3:29:44.700]  of dollars a month.
[3:29:44.700 --> 3:29:48.900]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout

[3:29:54.020 --> 3:30:00.940]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three part founder series at 1776 coin

[3:30:07.980 --> 3:30:09.860]  with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[3:30:09.860 --> 3:30:14.900]  It's a coin I designed, I'm very, very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible.
[3:30:14.900 --> 3:30:20.020]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[3:30:20.020 --> 3:30:21.300]  we sold it.
[3:30:21.300 --> 3:30:26.980]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly and I appreciate listeners getting
[3:30:26.980 --> 3:30:27.980]  over half of them now.
[3:30:27.980 --> 3:30:30.100]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[3:30:30.100 --> 3:30:33.780]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[3:30:33.780 --> 3:30:38.100]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[3:30:38.100 --> 3:30:40.500]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem.
[3:30:40.500 --> 3:30:44.660]  So it was a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom
[3:30:44.660 --> 3:30:47.580]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[3:30:47.580 --> 3:30:53.540]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776 coin dot

[3:33:05.980 --> 3:33:14.780]  All right, wait on the route back again a little housekeeping to let you know where
[3:33:14.780 --> 3:33:15.780]  you can reach me.
[3:33:15.780 --> 3:33:18.380]  You can always find me at root for America dot com.
[3:33:18.380 --> 3:33:19.380]  That's my website.
[3:33:19.380 --> 3:33:22.860]  What do I do all day a route for America easy to remember.
[3:33:22.860 --> 3:33:25.860]  I love this country for America dot com.
[3:33:25.860 --> 3:33:27.420]  How much do I love this country.
[3:33:27.420 --> 3:33:31.940]  My political career began at the age of three when I was handing out literature for Barry
[3:33:31.940 --> 3:33:37.260]  Goldwater in my father's arms at a train station in Malvern in New York.
[3:33:37.260 --> 3:33:38.260]  That's where I was born.
[3:33:38.260 --> 3:33:43.180]  Malvern in New York, Malvern hospital on the Bronx borderline and America was a very different
[3:33:43.180 --> 3:33:46.700]  country back then but I was a big fan of Barry Goldwater at the age of three.
[3:33:46.700 --> 3:33:50.660]  So my patriotic roots go back an awful long way.
[3:33:50.660 --> 3:33:51.980]  I'm 60 years old.
[3:33:51.980 --> 3:33:54.100]  That was 57 years ago.
[3:33:54.100 --> 3:33:59.380]  I started as a Republican at the age of three Republican conservative.
[3:33:59.380 --> 3:34:00.700]  My dad by the way was a butcher.
[3:34:00.700 --> 3:34:05.660]  I'm an SOB son of a butcher and my dad the butcher answered an ad in the New York City
[3:34:05.660 --> 3:34:09.580]  newspaper in 1962 when I was two years old.
[3:34:09.580 --> 3:34:15.500]  If you think the Republican party is too liberal and a bunch of sellouts so rhinos come to the
[3:34:15.500 --> 3:34:20.460]  very first meeting of the conservative party of New York and my dad attended and became
[3:34:20.460 --> 3:34:24.300]  one of the founders and leaders of the New York State conservative party even though he's
[3:34:24.300 --> 3:34:25.300]  a butcher.
[3:34:25.300 --> 3:34:30.500]  It was a bunch of big shot lawyers and businessmen and one blue collar butcher David Root and
[3:34:30.500 --> 3:34:34.940]  my mom Stella Root who founded the New York State conservative party and they became the
[3:34:34.940 --> 3:34:37.140]  leaders of Westchester County.
[3:34:37.140 --> 3:34:40.980]  And I grew up handing out literature for Republican candidates who had the endorsement of the
[3:34:40.980 --> 3:34:46.420]  conservative party and and literally running campaigns for candidates at the age of 15
[3:34:46.420 --> 3:34:48.820]  and 16 and 17 and 18.
[3:34:48.820 --> 3:34:52.980]  There were a lot of big shots who are very unhappy about that at the time and very jealous
[3:34:52.980 --> 3:34:57.140]  of me but I actually was named the campaign manager for a guy running for United States
[3:34:57.140 --> 3:35:03.380]  Congress at the age of 18 and a lot of people were upset but I did a great job anyway.
[3:35:03.380 --> 3:35:04.580]  That's my background.
[3:35:04.580 --> 3:35:08.660]  I was on a roll letting you know some of the big issues going on in America today that
[3:35:08.660 --> 3:35:10.460]  I was right about.
[3:35:10.460 --> 3:35:13.260]  You know I hate to say I told you so but I told you so.
[3:35:13.260 --> 3:35:18.100]  I said that Black Lives Matter was a fraud from day one and the reason they're a fraud
[3:35:18.100 --> 3:35:23.900]  is that every day black Americans including kids are killed on the streets of every big
[3:35:23.900 --> 3:35:27.140]  city in America by other black Americans.
[3:35:27.140 --> 3:35:29.820]  So how is the most important issue in the world?
[3:35:29.820 --> 3:35:37.140]  The one time a year a white cop shoots a black guy even if he's a criminal with a long record
[3:35:37.140 --> 3:35:43.460]  who was once convicted of murder or in jail for drug dealing or beating women or putting
[3:35:43.460 --> 3:35:49.300]  a gun against a pregnant woman's belly and that guy gets in a fight with cops and that
[3:35:49.300 --> 3:35:54.700]  causes nationwide rioting and billions of dollars by American corporations to go to
[3:35:54.700 --> 3:36:00.540]  Black Lives Matter but all the thousands of black people murdered by other black criminals
[3:36:00.540 --> 3:36:01.540]  in America.
[3:36:01.540 --> 3:36:05.420]  Remember 99% of black people are nice people.
[3:36:05.420 --> 3:36:11.500]  1% of these big cities are thugs and criminals and they're holding the 99% hostage and the
[3:36:11.500 --> 3:36:17.980]  police are there to protect the 99% of good black people who don't want to be held hostage
[3:36:17.980 --> 3:36:22.340]  in their homes, can't walk out at night, can't step out in their cars.
[3:36:22.340 --> 3:36:24.180]  They can be shot on a street corner.
[3:36:24.180 --> 3:36:26.660]  They can be shot drug dealers everywhere.
[3:36:26.660 --> 3:36:31.060]  They want to be just like you and me safe.
[3:36:31.060 --> 3:36:35.340]  Cops doing a great job to keep them safe but a couple of times a year a white cop
[3:36:35.340 --> 3:36:41.900]  shoots a black guy who maybe was unarmed or maybe was trying to grab the gun at a cop
[3:36:41.900 --> 3:36:46.540]  while the black guy was unarmed and that becomes the biggest racist issue in the world but
[3:36:46.540 --> 3:36:50.100]  Black Lives Matter couldn't care less when thousands of black people killed thousands
[3:36:50.100 --> 3:36:51.100]  of black people.
[3:36:51.100 --> 3:36:52.100]  It's fraud.
[3:36:52.100 --> 3:36:53.500]  It's complete fraud.
[3:36:53.500 --> 3:36:56.300]  They don't care when a black guy's killed.
[3:36:56.300 --> 3:36:59.420]  They only care a nice black person killed by a criminal.
[3:36:59.420 --> 3:37:04.980]  They only care if a white cop shoots somebody and now you find out Black Lives Matter purchased
[3:37:04.980 --> 3:37:09.340]  $6 million Los Angeles mansion with their donors money.
[3:37:09.340 --> 3:37:11.700]  This is not the first time this has come out in the news.
[3:37:11.700 --> 3:37:16.580]  This was in the news this morning but I've seen it 20 times in the last few months that
[3:37:16.580 --> 3:37:21.820]  the founders of Black Lives Matter who started out with nothing, who are all communists,
[3:37:21.820 --> 3:37:28.100]  mostly communist lesbians who hate men and don't want men to head households and they,
[3:37:28.100 --> 3:37:32.900]  communist lesbian, black lives matter founders, suddenly have multi-million dollar homes.
[3:37:32.900 --> 3:37:33.900]  Lots of them.
[3:37:33.900 --> 3:37:35.820]  Where do you think the money came from?
[3:37:35.820 --> 3:37:38.020]  It's all fraud.
[3:37:38.020 --> 3:37:39.020]  Complete fraud.
[3:37:39.020 --> 3:37:41.260]  Here's another great story.
[3:37:41.260 --> 3:37:48.540]  California city to give universal income to transgender residents and non-binary residents
[3:37:48.540 --> 3:37:50.940]  regardless of earnings.
[3:37:50.940 --> 3:37:58.220]  So Palm Springs has decided to give basically $1,000 a month to anyone who's transgender
[3:37:58.220 --> 3:38:00.660]  even if you make a million dollars a year.
[3:38:00.660 --> 3:38:06.100]  Because if you're transgender somehow they believe you deserve it, I don't know.
[3:38:06.100 --> 3:38:07.900]  It's so bizarre.
[3:38:07.900 --> 3:38:15.940]  I always said affirmative action is absolutely absurd because if it's racist to say you can't
[3:38:15.940 --> 3:38:20.260]  have a job because you're black, it's just as racist to say you can't have a job because
[3:38:20.260 --> 3:38:24.340]  you're white and I'm going to give it to a black person who may not be qualified for
[3:38:24.340 --> 3:38:30.180]  the job but I gave it to him because the color of their skin and this is the exact same story.
[3:38:30.180 --> 3:38:35.540]  Because you're born transgender or because you think you've changed your identity and
[3:38:35.540 --> 3:38:39.260]  now you are non-binary, someone please Google for me.
[3:38:39.260 --> 3:38:41.140]  What does non-binary mean?
[3:38:41.140 --> 3:38:42.820]  Are you a fish?
[3:38:42.820 --> 3:38:44.620]  Are you a frog?
[3:38:44.620 --> 3:38:51.180]  Do you think you could change from male to female depending on your mood of the day and
[3:38:51.180 --> 3:38:54.420]  tomorrow you're a man and the next day you're a woman?
[3:38:54.420 --> 3:38:56.460]  That must be what non-binary means.
[3:38:56.460 --> 3:39:00.020]  It's a frog or a fish is can go from one to the other.
[3:39:00.020 --> 3:39:03.020]  How people think they could go from one to the other.
[3:39:03.020 --> 3:39:06.420]  See being gay is not a mental illness, being gay is what you are.
[3:39:06.420 --> 3:39:07.740]  You're born gay.
[3:39:07.740 --> 3:39:14.820]  But being a person who believes you can change from man to woman is pure mental illness and
[3:39:14.820 --> 3:39:22.140]  we are starting to celebrate the absurd and the perverse in America and trying to make
[3:39:22.140 --> 3:39:27.820]  it seem normal and we're trying to make normal people seem weird and Disney's the king of
[3:39:27.820 --> 3:39:28.820]  that.
[3:39:28.820 --> 3:39:30.180]  What do I have left now time wise?
[3:39:30.180 --> 3:39:31.860]  Do I have enough for three minutes?
[3:39:31.860 --> 3:39:33.500]  Not enough to read to fund Disney.
[3:39:33.500 --> 3:39:38.500]  So I've been promising, I've been threatening, I'm going to read you D-Fund Disney.
[3:39:38.500 --> 3:39:44.180]  I will get to it to start the next segment so you can hear my plan to D-Fund Disney.
[3:39:44.180 --> 3:39:47.340]  But I need about six minutes to read it, not three minutes.
[3:39:47.340 --> 3:39:52.860]  So in the last three minutes I will mention the number one issue in America today.
[3:39:52.860 --> 3:39:55.540]  It's a new show I'm looking to put on the air by the way.
[3:39:55.540 --> 3:40:00.260]  I'm negotiating with several different online TV networks and real TV networks to put my
[3:40:00.260 --> 3:40:04.380]  show on the air and the show is going to be called America's Top 10 Countdown.
[3:40:04.380 --> 3:40:06.460]  I think what we need is like Casey Kasem.
[3:40:06.460 --> 3:40:08.820]  I want to be the conservative Casey Kasem.
[3:40:08.820 --> 3:40:13.980]  He counted down America's Top 40 and this is my podcast every week by the way on Fridays
[3:40:13.980 --> 3:40:20.020]  and you can find that at root4america.com, root4america.com and you can email me anytime
[3:40:20.020 --> 3:40:28.820]  weighingrootatgmail.com but every Friday and there's my website root4america.com.
[3:40:28.820 --> 3:40:32.820]  There's my book on the website, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book and we can
[3:40:32.820 --> 3:40:34.540]  lead the boycott of Disney.
[3:40:34.540 --> 3:40:35.540]  We all can.
[3:40:35.540 --> 3:40:39.260]  Grab a copy of my book and I'll show you how because I'll give you the phone number of
[3:40:39.260 --> 3:40:43.220]  Disney's CEO and chairman of the board and important board members and their address
[3:40:43.220 --> 3:40:47.700]  and their social media, all of that in my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott
[3:40:47.700 --> 3:40:53.420]  Book, which has been number one, by the way, at amazon.com and at Barnes and Noble quite
[3:40:53.420 --> 3:40:54.820]  a few times in the last few months.
[3:40:54.820 --> 3:40:57.500]  So grab a copy and I'll show you how to defund Disney.
[3:40:57.500 --> 3:41:00.540]  My new book is coming up, by the way, it should be out in about 60 days.
[3:41:00.540 --> 3:41:07.060]  It's called The Great Patriot Boycott, not Boycott, Boycott Book because I'm going to
[3:41:07.060 --> 3:41:12.700]  show you the companies to buy from instead of Disney and Coca-Cola and Ben and Jerry's
[3:41:12.700 --> 3:41:18.300]  Ice Cream, instead of all the Delta Airlines, instead of all the bad companies that support
[3:41:18.300 --> 3:41:24.660]  communist causes and causes that are against American exceptionalism, I will show you how
[3:41:24.660 --> 3:41:29.340]  to support companies that support patriots and Christians and conservatives and people
[3:41:29.340 --> 3:41:33.620]  who are family oriented and believe in Judeo-Christian values.
[3:41:33.620 --> 3:41:40.060]  The Great Patriot Boycott Book, that'll be out in about 60 days, but the way they're
[3:41:40.060 --> 3:41:48.220]  destroying America is through this Title 42 plan to eliminate Title 42 and leaked Homeland
[3:41:48.220 --> 3:41:51.220]  Security documents came out today.
[3:41:51.220 --> 3:41:59.460]  Border Chief Alejandro Mayorkas is directing this plan to let every single illegal in the
[3:41:59.460 --> 3:42:05.500]  world into America and to eliminate all chances to ever send them back.
[3:42:05.500 --> 3:42:11.220]  This is a purposeful, as I've said from day one, communist attack on the United States
[3:42:11.220 --> 3:42:15.660]  of America to destroy America once and for all and to wipe out the middle class, that's
[3:42:15.660 --> 3:42:20.340]  you, to wipe out the silent majority, that's you, and it's happening and we've got it in
[3:42:20.340 --> 3:42:21.340]  writing.
[3:42:21.340 --> 3:42:25.420]  I always said it was part of clowered pivot that I learned at Columbia University alongside
[3:42:25.420 --> 3:42:29.860]  my communist classmate, Barack Hussein Obama.
[3:42:29.860 --> 3:42:34.220]  This is how they're destroying the United States by overwhelming this country and this
[3:42:34.220 --> 3:42:39.140]  economy with foreigners on welfare who don't believe in American exceptionalism, who don't
[3:42:39.140 --> 3:42:44.220]  know American history, who don't speak English, and who want welfare from cradle to grave.
[3:42:44.220 --> 3:42:45.220]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[3:42:45.220 --> 3:42:46.220]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:46.220 --> 3:42:55.140]  I'm guest host of The Alex Jones Show right now.
[3:42:55.140 --> 3:42:58.900]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[3:42:58.900 --> 3:43:03.540]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[3:43:03.540 --> 3:43:11.300]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered
[3:43:11.300 --> 3:43:15.820]  and I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins
[3:43:15.820 --> 3:43:20.100]  and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the
[3:43:20.100 --> 3:43:22.340]  front lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[3:43:22.340 --> 3:43:30.060]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[3:43:30.060 --> 3:43:36.740]  It is powerful, witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history
[3:43:36.740 --> 3:43:42.260]  and be part of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near
[3:43:42.260 --> 3:43:45.700]  future thanks to your support of this project.
[3:43:45.700 --> 3:43:51.780]  Get a historic memento that helps keep info wars on the air and also gives you a real
[3:43:51.780 --> 3:44:21.500]  piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[3:44:21.900 --> 3:44:25.540]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[3:44:25.540 --> 3:44:29.900]  to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very
[3:44:29.900 --> 3:44:34.820]  compliant meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[3:44:34.820 --> 3:44:40.740]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[3:44:40.740 --> 3:44:45.180]  Again we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[3:44:45.180 --> 3:44:50.340]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads, it's all there at infowarstore.com.
[3:44:50.340 --> 3:44:55.700]  So protect your privacy today and support the info war at infowarstore.com.
[3:44:55.700 --> 3:45:03.380]  In December of 2021, info wars offered the first in a three part series, the 1776 anti
[3:45:03.380 --> 3:45:09.940]  tyrant coin and it sold out in 10 days and if it wasn't for listeners getting this original
[3:45:09.940 --> 3:45:15.220]  powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[3:45:15.220 --> 3:45:20.580]  Now the second coin, the Liberty Tree coin is being offered and it will probably sell
[3:45:20.580 --> 3:45:22.660]  out in 10 days again.
[3:45:22.660 --> 3:45:25.140]  It certainly needs to be front of operation.
[3:45:25.140 --> 3:45:30.160]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the tree of liberty
[3:45:30.160 --> 3:45:34.020]  being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[3:45:34.020 --> 3:45:41.260]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com, it's also at infowarstore.com, it's amazing,
[3:45:41.260 --> 3:45:45.780]  there's only 10,000 of them and as a founding member and were able to stay on the air, we're
[3:45:45.780 --> 3:45:51.060]  planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[3:45:51.060 --> 3:45:55.660]  So get your new tree of liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.

[3:46:56.380 --> 3:47:10.460]  Feeding a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:10.460 --> 3:47:11.460]  All right, welcome back.
[3:47:11.460 --> 3:47:17.980]  Wayne Alleruk, guest host for Alex Jones on Tuesdays from noon to one PM Pacific time,
[3:47:17.980 --> 3:47:21.340]  which would be three to four o'clock East Coast time.
[3:47:21.340 --> 3:47:25.300]  Most Tuesdays, not next Tuesday, because I'll tell you what's coming up, something really
[3:47:25.300 --> 3:47:31.260]  special in my life is coming up next Monday, and I'll be flying back all day on Tuesday,
[3:47:31.260 --> 3:47:34.940]  so I'll miss this show Tuesday, but I'll be here the week after.
[3:47:34.940 --> 3:47:37.300]  But I'm flying to Florida on Sunday.
[3:47:37.300 --> 3:47:42.180]  First of all, I haven't been here on the Alex Jones show for about two weeks because I had
[3:47:42.180 --> 3:47:48.300]  my honeymoon with my lovely wife Cindy at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump's estate, and we
[3:47:48.300 --> 3:47:49.300]  had a wonderful time.
[3:47:49.300 --> 3:47:50.460]  I wrote a commentary about it.
[3:47:50.460 --> 3:47:56.780]  You can find it at rootforamerica.com, and I wrote how, for all the Trump haters of
[3:47:56.780 --> 3:48:01.500]  the world out there, you'll be very upset to learn that President Trump was looking
[3:48:01.500 --> 3:48:08.780]  confident and strong and carefree, and absolutely, in my opinion, will be running for president
[3:48:08.780 --> 3:48:14.660]  again in 2024 as the clear frontrunner, not just to win the Republican nomination.
[3:48:14.660 --> 3:48:15.940]  That's a fate of complete.
[3:48:15.940 --> 3:48:18.180]  He will be the Republican nominee if he runs.
[3:48:18.180 --> 3:48:22.460]  But to win the election, and he looks the best of his life, he looks fantastic.
[3:48:22.460 --> 3:48:25.340]  So all the Trump haters, heads will explode when they hear that.
[3:48:25.340 --> 3:48:30.940]  I had a great time in Mar-a-Lago, and if you want to know the full story, go to rootforamerica.com,
[3:48:30.940 --> 3:48:33.540]  and I've got the whole commentary there.
[3:48:33.540 --> 3:48:34.640]  But here's what happened.
[3:48:34.640 --> 3:48:41.180]  I was booked about two months ago to be the speaker at Club 45 in Florida, Palm Beach,
[3:48:41.180 --> 3:48:42.780]  Florida, to be exact.
[3:48:42.780 --> 3:48:48.780]  On April 11th, that's next Monday night, that is the biggest Trump club in the world.
[3:48:48.780 --> 3:48:54.980]  And every month, they have the biggest Republican politicians and Republican stars in America,
[3:48:54.980 --> 3:48:56.180]  conservative stars.
[3:48:56.180 --> 3:49:00.980]  They fly them in, and they give a speech in front of thousands at their events for Club
[3:49:00.980 --> 3:49:02.100]  45.
[3:49:02.100 --> 3:49:05.780]  So I was booked for about two months now to give that speech.
[3:49:05.780 --> 3:49:11.220]  But President Trump found out I was giving that speech, and he's never gone to a Club
[3:49:11.220 --> 3:49:16.260]  45 event before, and he's never spoken at a Club 45 event.
[3:49:16.260 --> 3:49:19.900]  And so he found out I was speaking, and he said, Wayne Root speaking, count me and I'll
[3:49:19.900 --> 3:49:20.980]  be there.
[3:49:20.980 --> 3:49:26.000]  So it's now a Wayne Root Donald Trump event, and a Wayne Root Donald Trump speech, or as
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:31.660]  Trump would probably want it said, a Donald Trump Wayne Island Root speech, an event.
[3:49:31.660 --> 3:49:34.940]  And it sold out every ticket in 20 minutes.
[3:49:34.940 --> 3:49:40.780]  And so 6 p.m. East Coast time on Monday night in Palm Beach, Florida, I will be speaking
[3:49:40.780 --> 3:49:43.180]  with alongside President Trump.
[3:49:43.180 --> 3:49:48.660]  It'll be just the two of us on stage as a tag team, like the World Wrestling Federation.
[3:49:48.660 --> 3:49:49.860]  And we'll have the time of our lives.
[3:49:49.860 --> 3:49:53.940]  I'll bet you that audience will hear two of the most passionate, high-energy Republican
[3:49:53.940 --> 3:49:55.980]  speeches they've ever heard.
[3:49:55.980 --> 3:50:00.700]  And God bless America, the son of a butcher speaking alongside the former leader of the
[3:50:00.700 --> 3:50:03.220]  free world, President Donald J. Trump.
[3:50:03.220 --> 3:50:04.220]  What a great honor.
[3:50:04.220 --> 3:50:06.700]  Thank you for coming to my event, President Trump.
[3:50:06.700 --> 3:50:10.940]  Where he speaks, he will be listening to my speech, and that is a great honor to have
[3:50:10.940 --> 3:50:13.740]  him in the audience while I deliver my speech.
[3:50:13.740 --> 3:50:17.340]  There it is up on the screen, Club 45, Wayne Island Root, and President Trump.
[3:50:17.340 --> 3:50:20.940]  All right, I promised you D-Fund Disney, and I promised I'd get to it.
[3:50:20.940 --> 3:50:21.940]  Here it is.
[3:50:21.940 --> 3:50:23.020]  I wrote this commentary.
[3:50:23.020 --> 3:50:27.300]  My columns are naturally syndicated by newspapers and conservative websites.
[3:50:27.300 --> 3:50:32.300]  My great friend and co-author Nikki Ballew and I recently released our first book together,
[3:50:32.300 --> 3:50:35.020]  The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[3:50:35.020 --> 3:50:41.540]  It's a book that lists 116 woke corporations and condemns their fear-driven assault on
[3:50:41.540 --> 3:50:44.100]  normal traditional Americans.
[3:50:44.100 --> 3:50:48.940]  We show conservatives, Christians, capitalists, and patriots how to fight back against these
[3:50:48.940 --> 3:50:54.580]  gigantic woke anti-American corporations who are spinning at our faces while we make them
[3:50:54.580 --> 3:50:57.780]  rich by buying their products.
[3:50:57.780 --> 3:51:02.420]  And one of the companies on our list right at the top is Disney Corporation.
[3:51:02.420 --> 3:51:03.980]  I must have had a crystal ball.
[3:51:03.980 --> 3:51:08.220]  I knew that Disney would become the center of attention.
[3:51:08.220 --> 3:51:14.980]  And lo and behold, Disney just became the poster child for our struggle to save America.
[3:51:14.980 --> 3:51:21.540]  They have got to be our Mona Lisa, our great masterpiece, proving that we, conservatives,
[3:51:21.540 --> 3:51:27.980]  Christians, and patriots can successfully cancel woke companies that offend and spit
[3:51:27.980 --> 3:51:30.380]  in the face of conservatives.
[3:51:30.380 --> 3:51:35.500]  Once we hurt Disney in the pocketbook and bring them to their knees, this will serve
[3:51:35.500 --> 3:51:39.940]  as exhibit A for how the silent majority can take back America.
[3:51:39.940 --> 3:51:43.900]  Disney could very well be the worst offender we've ever seen.
[3:51:43.900 --> 3:51:48.380]  With their arrogance and radical beliefs, they've made themselves the target of 80 million
[3:51:48.380 --> 3:51:50.580]  plus Trump conservatives.
[3:51:50.580 --> 3:51:53.180]  And yes, I said that for a reason.
[3:51:53.180 --> 3:51:59.500]  Trump got 74 million votes, I believe he has 80 million votes in the last election.
[3:51:59.500 --> 3:52:01.900]  Disney has made it easy to hate Disney.
[3:52:01.900 --> 3:52:04.940]  They have no one but themselves to blame.
[3:52:04.940 --> 3:52:10.220]  Disney has chosen a hill to die on, there's that famous saying again, they want to overturn
[3:52:10.220 --> 3:52:17.620]  the new Florida law that stops the indoctrination of little children from pre kindergarten through
[3:52:17.620 --> 3:52:25.980]  third grade with woke sexual gender identity, brainwashing and transgender equality education.
[3:52:25.980 --> 3:52:30.140]  Keep in mind, we're only talking about five to eight year olds.
[3:52:30.140 --> 3:52:36.220]  What parent could possibly disagree with stopping the brainwashing of kindergarten through third
[3:52:36.220 --> 3:52:38.260]  grade five to eight year olds?
[3:52:38.260 --> 3:52:44.620]  What parent visiting Disney could possibly disagree, whether it's Disney World or Disneyland?
[3:52:44.620 --> 3:52:45.760]  What parent could disagree?
[3:52:45.760 --> 3:52:46.920]  They couldn't.
[3:52:46.920 --> 3:52:49.260]  But Disney doesn't care.
[3:52:49.260 --> 3:52:54.340]  They are intent on alienating the tens of millions of parents who don't believe that
[3:52:54.340 --> 3:52:59.300]  five to eight year olds should be sexualized at school and who also don't believe those
[3:52:59.300 --> 3:53:05.180]  same five to eight year olds should be taught to change their sexual identity like I change
[3:53:05.180 --> 3:53:07.060]  a pair of sneakers.
[3:53:07.060 --> 3:53:11.780]  Can you imagine, Disney has chosen this hill to die on.
[3:53:11.780 --> 3:53:12.780]  They're crazy.
[3:53:12.780 --> 3:53:13.780]  They're out of their minds.
[3:53:13.780 --> 3:53:18.140]  They're risking their entire company and they made a very bad bet.
[3:53:18.140 --> 3:53:20.100]  Let's call them on it.
[3:53:20.100 --> 3:53:25.100]  The president of Disney recently bragged that she will make sure that half of all characters
[3:53:25.100 --> 3:53:33.220]  in Disney movies and television shows and videos are either gay, lesbian, trans or minorities.
[3:53:33.220 --> 3:53:34.660]  I have no problem with that.
[3:53:34.660 --> 3:53:35.660]  You want to do that?
[3:53:35.660 --> 3:53:36.660]  Do it.
[3:53:36.660 --> 3:53:37.660]  America's a free country.
[3:53:37.660 --> 3:53:42.700]  But I hope she and her Disney board of directors and her Disney CEO and her Disney chairman
[3:53:42.700 --> 3:53:48.220]  of the board have no problem if I have free speech and if conservatives like me, tens
[3:53:48.220 --> 3:53:54.620]  of millions of us and Christians and patriots decide to never again visit any Disney theme
[3:53:54.620 --> 3:53:55.620]  park.
[3:53:55.620 --> 3:53:58.580]  There is the president of Disney television on the screen right now.
[3:53:58.580 --> 3:54:02.420]  She made a point of bragging that she has two children.
[3:54:02.420 --> 3:54:06.460]  One is transgender and the other is gender fluid.
[3:54:06.460 --> 3:54:10.860]  Folks, I don't even know what these mentally ill people are talking about and I don't really
[3:54:10.860 --> 3:54:11.860]  care.
[3:54:11.860 --> 3:54:14.860]  I just want them to keep their education away from my children.
[3:54:14.860 --> 3:54:16.900]  They're brainwashing away from my children.
[3:54:16.900 --> 3:54:18.100]  And you know what else?
[3:54:18.100 --> 3:54:21.580]  They're strange children away from my children.
[3:54:21.580 --> 3:54:23.260]  This is weird stuff.
[3:54:23.260 --> 3:54:29.580]  So if no patriot and no Christian and no conservative ever again goes to a Disney theme park or
[3:54:29.580 --> 3:54:34.420]  ever again spends a dime on a Disney product, I wonder how Disney will feel about our free
[3:54:34.420 --> 3:54:36.460]  speech.
[3:54:36.460 --> 3:54:38.660]  All is fair in war, right?
[3:54:38.660 --> 3:54:44.580]  And this is a war between Disney and America, American values, American exceptionalism and
[3:54:44.580 --> 3:54:46.780]  Judeo-Christian values.
[3:54:46.780 --> 3:54:53.380]  This is a far cry from the vision of Disney's founder, the iconic Walt Disney, a true American
[3:54:53.380 --> 3:54:58.500]  patriot and hero who wanted to create movies and television shows that were family-oriented
[3:54:58.500 --> 3:55:01.740]  and wholesome to entertain the whole family.
[3:55:01.740 --> 3:55:07.500]  Disney made billions of dollars from brilliantly executing on Walt Disney's vision.
[3:55:07.500 --> 3:55:12.820]  My co-author, Nikki Blue and I, outlined in our book exactly what to do.
[3:55:12.820 --> 3:55:18.100]  We provide the names of Disney's chairman of the board, Disney's CEO, their phone numbers,
[3:55:18.100 --> 3:55:22.980]  their email addresses, their social media addresses and their physical addresses.
[3:55:22.980 --> 3:55:28.020]  All of this information is provided in a directory in the back of our book called The Great Patriot
[3:55:28.020 --> 3:55:35.020]  Protest and Boycott Book for 116 woke companies that you can protest, boycott, strike and put
[3:55:35.020 --> 3:55:36.380]  out of business.
[3:55:36.380 --> 3:55:38.460]  Disney just became our number one target.
[3:55:38.460 --> 3:55:43.780]  First, I want you to look up the email address and the address for Disney and its key senior
[3:55:43.780 --> 3:55:51.580]  executives and then bombard them with polite, be polite, but firm messages that you will
[3:55:51.580 --> 3:55:55.340]  choose to boycott Disney for their woke choices.
[3:55:55.340 --> 3:55:59.580]  Secondly, and if you go to my website, Root for America, I'll show you an example of a
[3:55:59.580 --> 3:56:01.060]  letter you should send them.
[3:56:01.060 --> 3:56:04.900]  Secondly, follow through, stop doing business with Disney.
[3:56:04.900 --> 3:56:09.500]  Don't buy anything from Disney, don't watch anything from Disney, post on social media
[3:56:09.500 --> 3:56:13.860]  and encourage others to stop doing business with the make Disney pay.
[3:56:13.860 --> 3:56:20.620]  Third, sign up to our email list at rootforamerica.com and join the army of God fearing patriotic
[3:56:20.620 --> 3:56:26.180]  Americans who are fed up with woke corporations who take our money and then spit in our faces.
[3:56:26.180 --> 3:56:31.980]  Businesses exist to serve their customers, to solve our problems, to make our lives better.
[3:56:31.980 --> 3:56:38.060]  They do not exist to promote woke ideology or brainwash our children to change their
[3:56:38.060 --> 3:56:39.900]  sexual identity.
[3:56:39.900 --> 3:56:41.860]  Disney is now the poster child.
[3:56:41.860 --> 3:56:43.820]  It's time for Disney to pay.
[3:56:43.820 --> 3:56:46.300]  It's time to bring Disney for their knees.
[3:56:46.300 --> 3:56:49.100]  It's time to defund Disney.
[3:56:49.100 --> 3:56:53.500]  Let's start by treating Disney like the feds once treated Al Capone.
[3:56:53.500 --> 3:56:56.060]  Disney is now our public enemy number one.
[3:56:56.060 --> 3:56:57.380]  They richly deserve it.
[3:56:57.380 --> 3:56:58.540]  Defund Disney.
[3:56:58.540 --> 3:57:03.700]  If we succeed in making Disney go to their knees and apologize and change their corporate
[3:57:03.700 --> 3:57:10.900]  policy, then there's 115 other corporations in my book, The Great Patriot Protest.
[3:57:10.900 --> 3:57:12.780]  We can go work on them next.
[3:57:12.780 --> 3:57:16.860]  Let's make Disney public enemy number one and prove that it works.
[3:57:16.860 --> 3:57:18.100]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[3:57:18.100 --> 3:57:19.740]  Show is coming to an end for today.
[3:57:19.740 --> 3:57:21.660]  I'll see you in two Tuesdays.
[3:57:21.660 --> 3:57:25.180]  I'm headed to my speech with President Donald Trump next Monday.
[3:57:25.180 --> 3:57:28.100]  I'm flying back home to Las Vegas on Tuesday.
[3:57:28.100 --> 3:57:29.100]  Love y'all.
[3:57:29.100 --> 3:57:30.100]  Appreciate y'all.
[3:57:30.100 --> 3:57:33.540]  God bless every single one of you, the Patriots of America.
[3:57:33.540 --> 3:57:34.540]  Root for America.com.
[3:57:34.540 --> 3:57:36.540]  Wade Root at gmail.com.
[3:57:36.540 --> 3:57:47.020]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it.
[3:57:47.020 --> 3:57:53.220]  It's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty
[3:57:53.220 --> 3:58:01.700]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[3:58:01.700 --> 3:58:08.380]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[3:58:08.380 --> 3:58:09.380]  done.
[3:58:09.380 --> 3:58:15.380]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowarstore.com.
[3:58:15.380 --> 3:58:20.620]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you, and so now we need to support more
[3:58:20.620 --> 3:58:23.300]  than ever because this fight has intensified.
[3:58:23.300 --> 3:58:26.900]  Don't need me to tell you that at infowarstore.com.
[3:58:26.900 --> 3:58:30.900]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[3:58:30.900 --> 3:58:35.220]  Things have been sold out for a long time, like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's
[3:58:35.220 --> 3:58:39.740]  so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[3:58:39.740 --> 3:58:53.700]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarstore.com right now.
[3:58:53.700 --> 3:58:57.180]  William in California, people are asleep and program controlled.
[3:58:57.180 --> 3:58:58.180]  I agree.
[3:58:58.180 --> 3:58:59.700]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[3:58:59.700 --> 3:59:00.700]  Hi, Alex.
[3:59:00.700 --> 3:59:01.700]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:59:01.700 --> 3:59:03.700]  Can I plug, uh, Alex, real quick?
[3:59:03.700 --> 3:59:04.700]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:59:04.700 --> 3:59:09.340]  Hey, I'm in my sixties, uh, and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds.
[3:59:09.340 --> 3:59:11.620]  And I worked them into the ground and you wanted to know why.
[3:59:11.620 --> 3:59:14.500]  And I've tested this and I've taken your B12.
[3:59:14.500 --> 3:59:17.420]  And let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[3:59:17.420 --> 3:59:18.420]  I really do.
[3:59:18.420 --> 3:59:21.460]  I take that B12 and I am electric, man.
[3:59:21.460 --> 3:59:22.700]  I can run 10 miles.
[3:59:22.700 --> 3:59:27.780]  I do some pretty heavy work, uh, with a highway department and my friends will attest to the
[3:59:27.780 --> 3:59:33.740]  fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing 70, I'm, and I'm not just
[3:59:33.740 --> 3:59:50.940]  blowing smoke here, the B12 saves my life if you are receiving this transmission, you
[3:59:50.940 --> 4:00:06.260]  are the resistance.
