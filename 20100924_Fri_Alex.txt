[00:44.120 --> 00:50.000]  with his second amendment group as potential terrorist this Pittsburgh Tribune review has
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.600]  been writing on this we've had our own detailed reports before this was even in the mainstream
[00:54.600 --> 00:59.720]  news Pennsylvania Homeland Security targeted tea parties second amendment group made terror
[00:59.720 --> 01:07.080]  threat list in Pennsylvania that is all coming up because remember the 9 11 attacks whether
[01:07.080 --> 01:11.560]  you think it's an inside job or you really think men in a cave made norad stand down
[01:11.560 --> 01:16.880]  and blew up building seven along with the Easter bunnies help even if you believe that
[01:16.880 --> 01:23.240]  fable you cannot deny they've used the 9 11 attacks to set up Homeland Security for gun
[01:23.240 --> 01:30.360]  owners conservatives libertarians returning veterans okay period period you cannot debate
[01:30.360 --> 01:36.560]  that the people at red state everywhere else living in denial about this need to wake up
[01:36.560 --> 01:41.520]  and understand this now I've got all this incredible news and I'm gonna shoot a special
[01:41.520 --> 01:47.920]  video today that'll be up Sunday or Monday and I've had brainstorm after brainstorm
[01:47.920 --> 01:52.120]  the last two days have written page after page of notes and I'm not gonna do it live
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.360]  here on air until Monday but I'll put a video out on it this weekend I've really had to
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.040]  do some soul searching about Glenn Beck I mean Glenn Beck is a phenomenon tens of millions
[02:02.040 --> 02:07.440]  of listeners millions of viewers and I've seen him do a lot of bad things like supporting
[02:07.440 --> 02:13.720]  the Patriot Act supporting the Banker bailout demonizing Ron Paul but saying that I was
[02:13.720 --> 02:17.920]  gonna make a film about the neocons trying to come back into power which we are still
[02:17.920 --> 02:24.360]  going to make we've been doing something I've never done before I mean I'll be honest
[02:24.360 --> 02:30.160]  with you folks I really never watch Glenn Beck I would see YouTube boil downs of things
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.400]  he was doing that were terrible and I would criticize him for it but in the last few months
[02:35.400 --> 02:40.760]  I've had crew and myself they watch it every day I don't have time and they show me selects
[02:40.760 --> 02:50.640]  and I this is unprecedented his show Wednesday on Fox TV and Thursday nothing this truthful
[02:50.640 --> 02:54.120]  has ever been put out on national television I mean I'll just say that right now I mean
[02:54.120 --> 02:58.920]  see it's like Michael Savage I give him credit for coming out in the last year and saying
[02:58.920 --> 03:03.600]  Obama will probably stage terror attacks in America we can play those clips you can just
[03:03.600 --> 03:07.760]  search him if you want we've written articles about it I disagree with Savage on you know
[03:07.760 --> 03:12.840]  some issues I agree with him on most the point is when somebody has that type of courage
[03:12.840 --> 03:21.520]  you've got to give him credit and we've engaged in a deep analysis of what Glenn Beck is doing
[03:21.520 --> 03:27.440]  and I have to say that if he continues on the trend getting more hardcore every week
[03:27.440 --> 03:32.720]  and we've been monitoring his radio as well he will be Alex Jones hardcore within one
[03:32.720 --> 03:39.240]  year and then I'll I mean if that ever happened I'll never completely trust him like I do
[03:39.240 --> 03:45.320]  Ron Paul Ron Paul is the same 30 years ago 10 years ago a year ago this week a real patriot
[03:45.320 --> 03:50.920]  across the board exposing the world government the New World Order the Fabian Socialists
[03:50.920 --> 04:00.320]  the bankers I can never completely trust Glenn Beck I can never completely trust him because
[04:00.320 --> 04:04.600]  I've seen so much double speak and treachery in the past but I understand why a lot of
[04:04.600 --> 04:08.320]  our listeners and viewers are like why are you saying he's bad Alex aren't you watching
[04:08.320 --> 04:17.840]  well no I really wasn't and it's incredible I mean I mean that's all I can say and and
[04:17.840 --> 04:24.960]  the biggest issue and message here is this the fact that the things we talk about are
[04:24.960 --> 04:34.400]  now mainstream television shows how far as a society we've come and you notice that Roger
[04:34.400 --> 04:40.320]  Ailes is still in at Fox record ratings and Zuckerman and NBC is gone Jonathan Klein leaving
[04:40.320 --> 04:46.360]  CNN they're falling apart I mean yesterday Beck was talking about stuff we wrote about
[04:46.360 --> 04:51.240]  two years ago dealing with the federal government admitting they're setting up world government
[04:51.240 --> 04:57.560]  all right I'm not getting into it today I'm a little bit later it was just amazing but

[09:24.800 --> 09:32.400]  america on sale and it goes on to admit that it means that as the dollars devalued foreigners
[09:32.400 --> 09:38.960]  can come in and buy up our assets that much cheaper it's a widespread business or corporate level
[09:38.960 --> 09:47.680]  model of being able to go to mexico you know 20 years ago for 100 bucks and stay a week get
[09:47.680 --> 09:54.080]  hotels food everything because the peso was worth maybe less than one tenth of the dollar depending
[09:54.080 --> 10:02.080]  on what you know currencies were trading at the time and it's the same thing but instead
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.760]  these foreign corporations and groups are able to come in and buy up our infrastructure our
[10:05.760 --> 10:13.360]  companies you name it warren buffett says that we still are in a recession and he went on to add
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.560]  that we need to get over our anger dealing with tax increases yeah you got to love the
[10:20.560 --> 10:25.520]  fact that warren buffett's companies got tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer banker bailout
[10:25.520 --> 10:32.880]  money but his response to people that don't want to pay taxes to these criminal banks that sold
[10:32.880 --> 10:38.240]  all these derivatives is that we need to get over our anger buffett the taxpayers get over
[10:38.240 --> 10:47.040]  your anger that's from omaha.com that is just some of the news on the economy that we're going to be
[10:47.040 --> 10:55.040]  going over uh today another report here forget a recession the empire is crumbling uh in some
[10:55.040 --> 11:00.800]  other interesting news uh glenn beck yesterday on fox and we're glad to see this happening
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.760]  and we've put out public messages to beck saying please stop denying that the government wants to
[11:05.760 --> 11:10.560]  put americans in FEMA camps he talked about how the government has put americans in camps before
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.760]  and said it was a danger last night uh he talked about world population reduction and how that's
[11:15.760 --> 11:20.720]  the world government's plan and then he's going to expose it all week long next week and talk about
[11:20.720 --> 11:26.240]  how eugenics was created in the united states and exported to nazi germany it's not exactly right
[11:26.240 --> 11:33.680]  it was started in england expanded here then sold to the germans and uh he went over this report
[11:33.680 --> 11:40.160]  global trends 2025 that we wrote no fewer than seven articles on two years ago uh where the pentagon
[11:40.160 --> 11:47.200]  and the national intelligence council admits we're going into a planetary government and beck got up
[11:47.200 --> 11:54.160]  and said look this isn't a conspiracy theory this is a fact the government is saying this themselves
[11:54.160 --> 11:58.880]  but then cast sunstein comes out and says you should be arrested if you talk about this and
[11:58.880 --> 12:04.480]  he actually read cast sunstein quotes and said cast sunstein is a very dangerous man in fact the
[12:04.480 --> 12:10.400]  most dangerous in america i don't agree with that he's got bosses but i'm just dumbfounded by what
[12:10.400 --> 12:19.760]  i'm seeing but it shows why fox has got top ratings and is growing while uh both the nbc head and the
[12:19.760 --> 12:26.880]  cnn heads have quit today been fired basically been run out because they'll have one of their
[12:26.880 --> 12:32.720]  bill berg host on there uh telling you that there is no bill berg group and in the next day telling you
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.880]  how great the bill berg group is and so all of this stuff's out in the open and so if the dinosaur
[12:38.880 --> 12:44.560]  media continues to lie about this and call people conspiracy theorist they're going to lose what
[12:44.560 --> 12:54.480]  credibility they've got left which isn't much so fox is in is very smart to take on some of the
[12:54.480 --> 13:02.000]  patriot movements political spots or or colors to camouflage themselves but this could be bigger
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.480]  this could be a internal fight between the elite there's a lot of new vorice a lot of new wealth
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.440]  a lot of new billionaires who are upset about what's going on i've talked to some of them off record
[13:11.440 --> 13:17.120]  a lot of the big monies leaving the u.s realizes that this tyranny is so hardcore they didn't mind
[13:17.120 --> 13:23.120]  tyranny to and and corporate welfare to get filthy rich but now they realize this is a vertical
[13:23.120 --> 13:29.120]  integration and that they are open season as well so this could be a complete paradigm shift within
[13:29.120 --> 13:35.120]  the establishment realizing that they can't beat us the patriots join us again i'm going to make a
[13:35.120 --> 13:39.520]  video about this today it's going to be out this weekend i'm going to make a big announcement next
[13:39.520 --> 13:45.600]  week concerning my view on all this i'm really quite frankly still cogitating on it but in the
[13:45.600 --> 13:50.480]  last two months since i decided to make a film about the neocons and the liberals and how the
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.920]  whole left-right paradigm works and and looking at the co-opting of the tea parties that i've
[13:55.920 --> 14:02.000]  really immersed myself in studying glenn beck and that means not just watching boil downs on youtube
[14:02.000 --> 14:11.040]  of him but actually watching him and he's getting more hardcore every day and at current rates in
[14:11.040 --> 14:16.160]  less than a year really he will be as hardcore as alex jones if this continues fine if that happens
[14:16.160 --> 14:21.600]  i'll say hey he's great like ron paul he should come out and say i was wrong when i was for the
[14:21.600 --> 14:25.600]  patriot act i was wrong when i was with the banker bailouts i was wrong when i said there
[14:25.600 --> 14:30.640]  wasn't a new world order i was wrong when i made fun of people and then we could even trust him
[14:30.640 --> 14:39.680]  perhaps uh i mean it's it's incredible i mean but i'm going to make a whole video a 15 minute
[14:40.240 --> 14:46.000]  press video release on the subject today we'll shoot it today erin'll add documentation to it
[14:46.000 --> 14:53.840]  um again i don't trust these people as far as i can throw them but the issue is they're
[14:53.840 --> 15:01.040]  coming out with hardcore truth there's a global government it wants to kill you and then he's
[15:01.040 --> 15:07.120]  reading cast sunstein public quotes about we need to make conspiracy theories illegal or tax them
[15:07.120 --> 15:12.960]  we know that most of conspiracy theories are true but even if they are true we still say their lies
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.000]  i mean and then beck says don't believe me check it out for yourself and then he
[15:18.000 --> 15:28.560]  he goes on to talk about how we're rats in a rat maze with controlled choices ladies and gentlemen
[15:28.560 --> 15:35.120]  most of what you hear me talk about are epiphanies understandings connections i've made i've coined
[15:35.120 --> 15:40.800]  hundreds of terms now in popular use left right paradigm propaganda placement
[15:40.800 --> 15:50.880]  and he literally i kept wondering why newsweek time new york times salon hundreds of publications
[15:50.880 --> 15:56.560]  in the last year and a half kept saying glenn beck is riffing off of alex jones glenn beck
[15:56.560 --> 16:01.040]  is copying alex jones and even though i've got nightline doing pieces on us and even though
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.040]  i have higher internet ratings than beck and limbaugh combined you can go look those up at
[16:05.040 --> 16:11.760]  the google trends or you can go look that up at lexa or you know any of the major sites i still
[16:11.760 --> 16:15.680]  think of myself as little i still think because i mean it's my little office i literally carry
[16:15.680 --> 16:22.400]  the trash out many days i mean we're a small operation and so i thought oh the media is
[16:22.400 --> 16:29.600]  trying to demonize beck by you know saying i'm more of an extremist and so they're claiming he's
[16:29.600 --> 16:39.120]  copying me no he really is and you know at the end of the day i don't really mind that
[16:40.320 --> 16:47.040]  if glenn beck was for real if he didn't take my message and then mix into it pro war pro torture
[16:47.040 --> 16:53.600]  jack bowers a hero you know we need to take the gloves off ron paul supporters might be violent
[16:54.560 --> 16:56.240]  global warming might be real
[16:56.240 --> 17:07.360]  on and on and on i don't mind i mean imitation is this is the most sincere form of flattering
[17:10.640 --> 17:17.200]  but it also kind of shakes me up to hear him word for word now remember he's got a
[17:17.200 --> 17:25.920]  15 million dollar studio we've got a hundred thousand dollar studio he's got a bunch of writers
[17:25.920 --> 17:30.160]  that goes write his books and fill his teleprompters you notice people always see obama reading
[17:30.160 --> 17:34.720]  teleprompters and they're shocked well where are the images of beck i mean he's reading off teleprompters
[17:34.720 --> 17:39.760]  so it's whoever's doing his writing at fox news and i actually have this from two high level
[17:39.760 --> 17:44.160]  people that work at fox and i was told this over a year ago and couldn't hardly believe it separately
[17:44.160 --> 17:51.040]  and then i was told by another radio executive who knows beck and knows his bodyguards who were
[17:51.040 --> 17:57.840]  retired fbi agents that bet believes in the new world order is freaked out is building a bunker
[17:57.840 --> 18:04.880]  is scared uh and watches my show listens to it daily so i want to say to glenn beck i challenged
[18:04.880 --> 18:09.040]  you a few years ago when you were saying fema camps didn't exist when we sent you all the evidence of
[18:09.040 --> 18:19.920]  it i challenged you to not continue with what you were doing and i'm not just here griping and
[18:19.920 --> 18:26.320]  yelling about glenn beck being a judo scott or a benedict arnold because i'm mad that he reaches
[18:26.320 --> 18:30.960]  millions of more people than i do on television i don't care at the end of the day i'm about the
[18:30.960 --> 18:37.520]  mission of my children living in a free country i want to believe in michael savage i want to
[18:37.520 --> 18:45.280]  believe in rush limbaugh i want to believe in glenn beck but i i can't forget sean hannity saying
[18:45.280 --> 18:50.480]  all malet all militia should be arrested that's a quote every child in america needs an implantable
[18:50.480 --> 18:57.680]  microchip that's a video quote it's in now what police state three total enslavement
[19:00.240 --> 19:06.240]  i mean i remember savage saying six years ago anybody that criticizes the war is aiding al-qaeda
[19:06.240 --> 19:13.200]  and needs to be put in a forced labor camp well i mean mr savage the patriot act
[19:13.840 --> 19:17.920]  even if the muslims are evil bloodthirsty demons that do want to kill us i mean if your
[19:17.920 --> 19:21.520]  paradigm is accurate for the case of debate let's say it might be

[24:12.320 --> 24:18.240]  all right i'm gonna finish up with this whole fox news situation you've got the fifth avenue sixth
[24:18.240 --> 24:26.000]  avenue bloodbath going on NBC CNN chiefs out but why is fox not just holding on to the ratings but
[24:26.000 --> 24:32.080]  even growing with some of its programs because they at least will admit there's a world government
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.440]  all over the european press all over the foreign press and even some of the us publications admit
[24:37.440 --> 24:42.640]  there's a world government now but they say it's a good thing now the neocons and republican
[24:42.640 --> 24:49.280]  hosts for decades said it didn't exist they were the gatekeepers it was the kook detector if you
[24:49.280 --> 24:55.120]  talked about the cfr you were a lunatic glenn back on wednesday admitted that a member of
[24:55.120 --> 25:01.360]  british intelligence edward mandel house helped set up the council on foreign relations and the
[25:01.360 --> 25:07.840]  federal reserve to take over this country i mean that's incredible what is fox news doing talking
[25:07.840 --> 25:15.360]  about that lou dobs didn't even go that far and he of course was forced out of cnn at the end of the
[25:15.360 --> 25:21.520]  day it's a complex issue and again i'm gonna do a report on it it mainly shows how we've caused a
[25:21.520 --> 25:27.840]  huge awakening you have caused a huge awakening where the controlled left has to now admit world
[25:27.840 --> 25:33.680]  governments real but say it's a good thing and the controlled right has to come out and
[25:33.680 --> 25:40.000]  limitedly admit there's a world government and that it's authoritarian and tyrannical but they
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.720]  still support the main goals of the globalist and here's the key but he gets better and better
[25:46.720 --> 25:55.360]  so we're hoping you know he's going in the right direction he tells you that van jones is the top
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.560]  of this he puts their photos up and that this is the elite and that it's cast sunstein those are
[26:00.560 --> 26:07.360]  mid-level minions on the left arm of the controlled system and they know that and the writers for glenn
[26:07.360 --> 26:12.800]  back and others are showing that they have a high level of understanding of the eugenics planetary
[26:12.800 --> 26:20.800]  dictatorship that they're now setting up and so that means they understand the rest of the paradigm
[26:20.800 --> 26:27.200]  and they're not telling you it's the fortune 100 that are openly calling for world government the banks
[26:27.200 --> 26:32.960]  the oil companies all of it they're telling you it's a bunch of professors and leftists
[26:32.960 --> 26:39.120]  who are only carrying out one piece of the overall agenda and that's the big issue
[26:39.120 --> 26:47.840]  but this is going to be good for my radio show my websites that this information is becoming
[26:47.840 --> 26:54.560]  so widespread they can take baby steps now with back and others and then they can find
[26:55.920 --> 26:59.360]  the deep analysis in the full spectrum breakdown here on this show
[27:02.080 --> 27:06.800]  but to actually be really watching now and really listening something i hadn't been doing but off
[27:06.800 --> 27:15.120]  and on is freaking me out because i'm literally producing i had said 30 40 of back show inadvertently
[27:15.120 --> 27:20.640]  they take what i do and then change it but but but use it word for word in many cases
[27:21.440 --> 27:26.560]  that now what i talk about is going to be on glenn back in two three weeks the guests we have on
[27:26.560 --> 27:32.880]  are going to be on in two three weeks word for word what i say is taken changed slightly and
[27:32.880 --> 27:40.640]  put out on his radio and tv show it's amazing the responsibility i've got and i've always
[27:40.640 --> 27:44.320]  you know said it's not about alex jones all of us are leaders we've got to take action
[27:44.320 --> 27:49.760]  that's the power of my great audience but i have to face up the fact that i've got to go to the
[27:49.760 --> 27:54.240]  next level i've got to be more professional i've got to be more focused because i mean nobody's
[27:54.240 --> 28:01.120]  telling alex jones what to do i say hang that light here put a camera there i gather the news
[28:01.120 --> 28:07.840]  news my crew brings me news i go over it there's no teleprompters there's no makeup person there's
[28:07.840 --> 28:13.920]  there's no nothing what does that say about my message and and and my perspective and my
[28:13.920 --> 28:20.880]  analysis of the new world order that the most powerful news network in the world and i have
[28:20.880 --> 28:28.400]  this confirmed from people inside but you can see it every night takes what i do even down to the
[28:31.840 --> 28:41.040]  props he uses the the the words he i mean everything it's got to be 60 of what he says on
[28:41.040 --> 28:49.280]  the radio and tv is directly from this show i mean i mean imagine if you were alex jones and
[28:49.280 --> 28:54.880]  whatever you talk about glenn beck has people literally taking and then putting out
[29:01.520 --> 29:05.600]  and erin dykes while i was sitting there watching wednesday show and thursday show last night that
[29:05.600 --> 29:10.880]  they taped for me they were fast forwarding and showing me selects of it in our editing booth
[29:12.160 --> 29:17.280]  i was watching it up on the big screen tv in that room and erin looked at me very knowingly and he
[29:17.280 --> 29:25.520]  said looks like you got co-opted even though you never sold out and erin says this is a and i tend
[29:25.520 --> 29:29.440]  to agree with him a complex psi op if they can't meet us they'll join us they're playing the part
[29:29.440 --> 29:34.160]  of opposition all the republicans are out of power as soon as they get into power it'll be just like
[29:34.160 --> 29:39.920]  keith uberman was anti-territy when bush was in now he's pro-territy and i tend to agree but this
[29:39.920 --> 29:45.040]  is bigger than what keith uberman did i mean this is unprecedented what's being put on television
[29:45.040 --> 29:50.000]  i mean i'm literally on television every night through glenn beck it's bizarre
[29:51.200 --> 29:57.920]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:19.120 --> 33:29.520]  okay let's blitz through news now starting with some info wars.com news
[33:32.240 --> 33:40.240]  tim our office manager came into me after the radio show yesterday and he said i've got uh
[33:40.240 --> 33:47.280]  some bad news for you now give me a document cam shot on this guys thank you department of transportation
[33:47.280 --> 33:55.120]  delaware sent to our office first defense warning it says the next time i'll be fined
[33:55.920 --> 34:03.920]  and it has a photo of a homemade info wars.com sign on a telephone pole and they say they have
[34:03.920 --> 34:10.240]  proof that i posted this and of course uh i wrote a little comment on curtain imo's story
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.760]  dealing with this note from alex jones this is asinine the sign in question is clearly homemade
[34:15.760 --> 34:21.200]  if an obama sign was put on my utility pole with the state issue obama a citation if somebody
[34:21.200 --> 34:27.040]  made a homemade obama sign and posted it would they send a citation or a ticket to obama this is
[34:27.040 --> 34:30.960]  something straight out of Stalinist Russia or mouse china where you're guilty for something somebody
[34:30.960 --> 34:36.560]  else does i am out of the state's jurisdiction the next time a sign is put up they will find me
[34:36.560 --> 34:41.600]  they say if i don't pay the fine they will issue an arrest warrant then i'll be forced to sue them
[34:41.600 --> 34:47.520]  they will undoubtedly lose and have to pay me money taken from delawareans so i've called their
[34:47.520 --> 34:55.920]  office their phone numbers are on this flyer scanned in uh up at info wars dot com the headline is
[34:55.920 --> 35:03.040]  delaware sends info wars dot com first defense warning for sign now we do tell people to post
[35:03.040 --> 35:08.800]  flyers in public legal areas check your local laws to expose dangerous fluoride in the water
[35:08.800 --> 35:14.240]  and things like that i i guess it's a good idea to put up info wars dot com signs but do it on
[35:14.240 --> 35:19.840]  your own property or do it in areas where it's legal or lawful to post signs uh i mean we've
[35:19.840 --> 35:27.440]  had cases of people spray painting info wars dot com uh in oregon and then another case in colorada
[35:27.440 --> 35:32.880]  and i got threatening calls from local officials telling me to stop it or they'd come after me
[35:32.880 --> 35:38.480]  criminally i'm not spray painting things on road signs in colorada i got a threatening email from
[35:38.480 --> 35:42.480]  government in new zealand a local government we're in abandoned building somebody spray
[35:42.480 --> 35:46.880]  painted info wars dot com on it but you know at the end of the day we have banks stealing
[35:46.880 --> 35:52.480]  trillions of dollars from us they're trying to start world war three uh there's all sorts of
[35:52.480 --> 35:57.360]  corruption going on in government and they should have better things to do than worry about somebody
[35:57.360 --> 36:03.760]  putting up a sign for info wars dot com but it just shows how crazy government is i mean in the
[36:03.760 --> 36:07.840]  past government would use common sense and no i don't have offices in delaware i don't think
[36:07.840 --> 36:11.840]  i've ever been to delaware i've been on some long road trips my parents took me onto the east coast
[36:11.840 --> 36:15.680]  but i don't think i've ever been in delaware i think i'm pretty sure i have it i asked my dad
[36:15.680 --> 36:22.320]  last night he says no we've never taken you there i've never been there uh and uh you know they
[36:22.320 --> 36:28.160]  they're just sending me tickets and it's it's it's why federal and state courts have thrown out
[36:28.160 --> 36:35.600]  red light tickets over and over again under state law you've got to have an officer sworn
[36:35.600 --> 36:41.360]  and bonded who's a witness to show up in court write you a ticket you can't have a computer
[36:41.360 --> 36:47.200]  and a hook to a camera run by some defense contractor send you tickets they're illegal
[36:47.200 --> 36:51.600]  they're unlawful they need to be removed and they are being removed in places like arizona
[36:51.600 --> 36:57.280]  and southern california a few months ago in texas a state court told the company that runs
[36:57.280 --> 37:02.720]  red lights at austin that they hadn't gotten a private investigator permit they claim they have
[37:02.720 --> 37:09.520]  to get that too if they're going to be issuing these tickets you're not offered court to challenge these
[37:12.800 --> 37:18.720]  and the agency that's doing this this private agency is just continuing so it's another
[37:18.720 --> 37:26.800]  example of lawlessness that's going on i wanted to get into uh some good news today
[37:26.800 --> 37:33.360]  uh for folks as well the disclose act which makes mccain feingold's restrictions on free
[37:33.360 --> 37:39.440]  speech look tame uh has been defeated it would make any public interest group like gun owners of
[37:39.440 --> 37:45.040]  america uh disclose the names of donors in certain political advertisements so the
[37:46.080 --> 37:53.680]  massive attack on free speech uh continuing with other good news uh we have of course a
[37:53.680 --> 37:58.000]  few days ago the dream act to legalize a bunch of illegal aliens and give them free college
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  tuition and put them in the military that's been defeated meanwhile the republicans are back
[38:02.000 --> 38:08.320]  with their contract on america part two gop pledged to america laced with tea party slogans
[38:08.320 --> 38:13.760]  and you notice that baner and the scores of other congress people that stood with him with their
[38:13.760 --> 38:21.040]  pledge uh for america pledged to america they were not wearing ties oh they're the common people
[38:21.040 --> 38:27.280]  it shows how coordinated all of this is they all got together and said don't wear ties dress down
[38:28.480 --> 38:37.440]  it's form over reality and if we have people like newt genrich leading this conservative
[38:37.440 --> 38:42.720]  revolution we're going to end up the same place we were in the mid-1990s it's going to be sabotaged
[38:42.720 --> 38:50.560]  from within and that is exactly what's going on with this today and i frankly am sick of it i am
[38:50.560 --> 38:58.080]  tired of it and that watching two of glenbeck shows yesterday evening there was a lot of little
[38:58.080 --> 39:02.240]  red flags i did see i'm trying to encourage the fact that he's getting better but that's the game
[39:02.240 --> 39:06.720]  people's trust no doubt because the neocons know how powerful this anti-globalist movement is and
[39:06.720 --> 39:10.720]  they know they can't tell us it doesn't exist anymore so they have decided to have high ratings
[39:10.720 --> 39:15.120]  and be successful and tell part of the truth but again i'm hoping it moves in the right direction
[39:15.120 --> 39:21.760]  so i'm trying to be positive here but he got up there and he said there are real conspiracy theories
[39:22.960 --> 39:28.960]  and by that things that are not true and he said there is no truth to the berther story
[39:28.960 --> 39:33.520]  hillary clinton created that story which there's not a lot of evidence of that there's a little bit
[39:33.520 --> 39:37.920]  that some democrats did question you know where he was really from because that was the scuttlebut
[39:37.920 --> 39:45.840]  within the party and he went on to say basically that newt genrich was good somehow and that newt
[39:45.840 --> 39:51.440]  genrich had never said that the berther issue was real this is a guy who wants global taxes global
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.880]  carbon taxes and one world government he's written multiple books on it he has tv ads promoting carbon
[39:56.880 --> 40:03.600]  taxes and i had to hear about how newt genrich was good and the berthers are bad look the berthers
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.880]  have legitimate concerns and going back a year ago i said i didn't know if it was true or not
[40:08.880 --> 40:12.720]  but there was some evidence and that it looked like a cover-up was going on because he never
[40:12.720 --> 40:20.160]  released the original birth certificate but since then i've researched it in depth he was an indonesian
[40:20.160 --> 40:26.400]  citizen he changed his name to barry sataro and under federal law that made him ineligible to be
[40:26.400 --> 40:33.360]  president now you notice that that will never be touched by fox news oh they'll sit there all day
[40:33.360 --> 40:39.680]  long saying the berther issue is a fraud and that it's run by hillary hillary is in the white house
[40:39.680 --> 40:46.560]  she's she's a cabinet member she is the head of the state department okay she's the secretary of
[40:46.560 --> 40:54.720]  state hillary rodin clinton i mean the clintons are puppeteering obama so now they're claiming
[40:54.720 --> 40:59.840]  that there are these fishers within the democratic party itself i mean this is an asinine joke so
[40:59.840 --> 41:05.920]  newt genrich's good berther's bad but a side issue it's just ladies and gentlemen don't let anybody
[41:05.920 --> 41:12.000]  tell you flat out with no evidence there's that there's no evidence without giving any proof
[41:12.000 --> 41:17.040]  that there's nothing to the berther issue there is a lot to the berther issue and he does have a
[41:17.040 --> 41:21.600]  grandmother saying he was born there there is a statue there saying he was born there we've
[41:21.600 --> 41:28.320]  got three different video clips uh michelle sataro aka michelle obama saying he is kenyan born and is
[41:28.320 --> 41:36.880]  a kenyan but forget that forget the berther issue what we've got to push because then everything he's
[41:36.880 --> 41:42.880]  done will then be struck down in the courts everything he's done retroactively will be thrown out
[41:44.160 --> 41:48.880]  is the fact that he committed treason violating article one section nine when he seated himself
[41:48.880 --> 41:55.040]  as the head of the united nation security council that had never been done and that is treason
[41:55.040 --> 42:01.600]  according to the constitution period we covered my film fall the republic and we've also
[42:02.320 --> 42:07.920]  to double edged uh prong here we've got to get it out to everybody that his real name is berri
[42:07.920 --> 42:13.600]  sataro he's got another name too i mean there's a whole bunch of these names and he did live in
[42:13.600 --> 42:20.080]  indonesia he did give up a citizenship look if if you moved to iran and gave up your u.s
[42:20.080 --> 42:24.560]  citizenship or you moved to indonesia and you gave up your citizenship you couldn't come back
[42:24.560 --> 42:31.120]  here and run for president it is completely elementary it is a fact and you know if beck
[42:31.120 --> 42:36.160]  wants to bash hillary clinton all day which is fine with me i won't lose any sleep over that
[42:36.160 --> 42:43.440]  remember uh fundraisers being held for hillary clinton when they were trying to get her into power
[42:43.440 --> 42:49.920]  in 2007 by rupert murnock multi-million dollar fundraisers held at his private penthouse that
[42:49.920 --> 42:54.000]  guys google that people won't remember it rupert murnock held fundraisers for hillary pull it up
[42:55.440 --> 43:06.000]  let's pull that up for people now i do know some navy seals retired who did guard uh mr
[43:06.000 --> 43:13.360]  ailes the head of news corps the head of fox news a division of news corps and this goes back 15
[43:13.360 --> 43:19.120]  years ago when he was scared to death with multiple bodyguards this is directly from the source
[43:20.800 --> 43:22.240]  with multiple bodyguards
[43:24.960 --> 43:30.560]  afraid of of the clinton's killing him and i'm trying to get one of these guys on the
[43:30.560 --> 43:37.360]  year or i may be able to get one of their associates on who was also witness to this
[43:37.520 --> 43:41.840]  you might be able to imagine where i learned things from navy seals but i'll just leave it at that
[43:42.480 --> 43:49.920]  the point is that there are some fissures in this whole power structure so people are enemies
[43:49.920 --> 43:54.000]  then they become allies later but yeah there was the ms nbc headline let's put it back up the guys
[43:54.000 --> 44:01.440]  found it very quickly great job uh murdoch fundraiser for clinton creates a buzz ms nbc
[44:01.440 --> 44:14.000]  running an ap article and let's blow up that screen so i can see the year that was in 2006 2006
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.040]  2006 2007 i remember he had multiple that was just one of the big ones one of the first ones
[44:19.040 --> 44:24.800]  so there you have it the point is that when these people get behind closed doors together
[44:24.800 --> 44:29.680]  more often than not they're on the same team they're the ruling class and one group the
[44:29.680 --> 44:34.400]  democrats gets back into power playing the part of anti-establishment under bush
[44:35.920 --> 44:43.280]  no bush is anti-establishment he gets in from clinton then the democrats poses anti-establishment
[44:43.280 --> 44:48.640]  with obama he gets into power but they're all financed by the very same interest
[44:48.640 --> 44:55.680]  but there is some truth to in the mid 1990s ailes was completely paranoid shaking in fear
[44:56.320 --> 45:05.760]  and hiding from the clinton's with multiple navy seals protecting him 24 7 and i've confirmed
[45:05.760 --> 45:15.520]  that about beck beck has fbi retired fbi protecting him from the government from assassins beck's
[45:15.520 --> 45:23.120]  main fear is a the government and then b patriot groups i guess he's afraid of my listeners or
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.200]  something because i've criticized him beck we wish no harm upon you okay all right i'm already
[45:27.200 --> 45:33.360]  digressing here and i've got all this all this news to get to it's just crazy okay covered some of
[45:33.360 --> 45:41.200]  that good news there you know the bad news the democrats have decided to punt and they are not
[45:41.200 --> 45:48.800]  going to vote this year ahead of the election 2010 on uh keeping some of the bush era tax cuts
[45:48.800 --> 45:54.320]  that were across the board for the poor the middle class the rich and the ultra rich and so everyone
[45:54.320 --> 46:00.400]  will have massive tax increases obama breaking his promise for not just keeping it the same but
[46:00.400 --> 46:07.760]  middle class tax cuts uh coming into play next year so and the republicans aren't squealing too
[46:07.760 --> 46:12.160]  much about this they think they're going to get big political bonus points and let's see if once
[46:12.160 --> 46:18.880]  they're in power if they actually get rid of tax cuts across the board or or bring the tax cuts back
[46:18.880 --> 46:26.800]  across the board okay let's see if they actually get rid of these tax increases let's see if that
[46:26.800 --> 46:32.000]  happens let's remember let's not get so happy feeling like we're winners i remember trying to
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.800]  talk to bill clinton supporters when i was first on air in 95 and i'd say bill clinton is sold out
[46:36.800 --> 46:41.520]  to the communist chinese he's a globalist strobe talbot his undersecretary of state wants world
[46:41.520 --> 46:46.240]  government here's all the quotes and they'd say you're just mad republican that you lost and i'd
[46:46.240 --> 46:54.560]  say look i'm not a republican i am a constitutionalist and the republicans do at least give window
[46:54.560 --> 46:59.840]  dressing more you know to that view but i said it's a controlled left right paradigm bill clinton
[46:59.840 --> 47:04.160]  works for the globalist his mentor carol quigley wrote a book about this and admitted they control
[47:04.160 --> 47:08.080]  both parties and that there isn't a dime's worth the difference at the leadership levels
[47:08.080 --> 47:17.760]  they just laugh and say you're angry you lost get over it they were associating their personal
[47:17.760 --> 47:24.080]  power and their identity with bill clinton who they saw basically as their daddy and that everybody
[47:24.080 --> 47:29.920]  gets mad after clinton of eight years so bush comes in and republicans i said look you know he's
[47:29.920 --> 47:38.160]  trying to pass the assault weapons ban reauthorize it you know he's expanding nafta and gat uh he's
[47:38.160 --> 47:43.200]  not really fighting carbon taxes he's doing all these things the patriot acts been written for
[47:43.200 --> 47:49.200]  the american people section 802 on and on and on look at these federal reports they're training
[47:49.200 --> 47:53.120]  almost all their training is not to fight foreign muslims it's for the american people
[47:53.120 --> 48:00.320]  and they say shut up liberal shut up you're just mad that uh george bush beat al gore
[48:01.680 --> 48:07.840]  and i'd say i hate al gore they don't know you don't don't try to trick me you know don't try
[48:07.840 --> 48:15.280]  to trick me uh you know you uh liberal you're just mad that george w bush you know beat your
[48:15.280 --> 48:23.760]  guy al gore and i said no no no i said look at election fraud the machines are cheating whoever
[48:23.760 --> 48:28.640]  the anti-establishment candidate is or whoever the elite wants to get in they cheat for them
[48:28.640 --> 48:34.080]  because it's part of a sharing of power in the left right paradigm these machines are questionable
[48:34.080 --> 48:44.240]  let's just look at the evidence they go shut up you're mad that al gore lost and then obama came
[48:44.240 --> 48:50.720]  to power and i said look at his advisors he's for the bailout he's for the wars he's against the
[48:50.720 --> 48:56.640]  constitution uh he may be a foreigner we know he gave up a citizenship and they'd say shut up right
[48:56.640 --> 49:02.480]  wing fox news you know glenn beck copycat and i'd say i don't even watch glenn beck anything glenn
[49:02.480 --> 49:10.640]  beck copycats me no no no no so remember when the republicans take the house maybe even the senate
[49:10.640 --> 49:14.880]  and definitely by 2012 unless obama stages a nuke attack neclerz marshal law and that could
[49:14.880 --> 49:18.800]  always happen his handlers could do that they're certainly hyping it right now they're sending
[49:18.800 --> 49:23.520]  up travel ends but but but barring world war three or a stage nuke attack or something along those
[49:23.520 --> 49:30.160]  lines obama and all of the progressives are out of power the globalist eugenesis is what they are
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.320]  and then they'll put in eugenics light the republicans and they'll pay a little lip service
[49:36.320 --> 49:42.720]  change a few things but obama takes us a hundred miles the republicans take half of that away
[49:42.720 --> 49:49.360]  but we're still all the way down the rat hole we don't want we don't want republicans to just
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.160]  repeal some of it they've got to get rid of everything that's been done since 1913 they've
[49:56.160 --> 50:00.800]  got to get rid of the federal reserve they've got to criminally charge these big central bankers
[50:00.800 --> 50:06.720]  or they're going to destroy our economy in our society that's their plan and beck was admitting
[50:06.720 --> 50:10.800]  that that the mega elite want to destroy our economy by design but he was saying the mega
[50:10.800 --> 50:17.760]  elite were little communist professors no it's the mega corporations that fund collectivism
[50:17.760 --> 50:25.520]  and becks handlers know this his latest faction book fiction that's fact admits it all they have
[50:25.520 --> 50:31.040]  a high level of understanding they know all of this and they knew this stuff 10 years ago when
[50:31.040 --> 50:37.760]  limbaugh and others were saying none of this existed so don't two years from now when i'm
[50:37.760 --> 50:43.280]  saying look the republicans are not repealing all this stuff don't sit there and go shut up
[50:43.280 --> 50:51.840]  kami okay i'm a kami when a republicans in i'm a fascist when a democrat's in no i'm a

[54:21.120 --> 54:29.840]  establishment feigns outrage at akmed denigads 9-1-1 ran key article by paul joseph wantson
[54:29.840 --> 54:37.120]  up at prison planet dot com and i want to go ahead and play a video clip of his speech
[54:37.680 --> 54:40.320]  yesterday at the united nations in new york here it is
[54:44.960 --> 54:49.920]  there were three viewpoints first that a very powerful and complex terrorist group able to
[54:49.920 --> 54:55.040]  successfully cross all layers of the american intelligence and security carried out the attack
[54:55.040 --> 54:59.280]  this is a prevalent viewpoint which has been supported and mainly advocated by american
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.440]  statesmen second that some segments within the u.s. government orchestrated the attack
[55:03.440 --> 55:08.240]  to reverse the declining american economy and its grips in the middle east in order to save
[55:08.240 --> 55:13.280]  designers regime the majority of the american people as well as most nations and politicians
[55:13.280 --> 55:20.800]  around the world agree with this view all right now if you look at the new york times angerson
[55:20.800 --> 55:25.920]  reid poll from five years ago 84 percent of americans questioned who really carried out the
[55:25.920 --> 55:31.600]  attack i mean our government admits they staged the gulf of the tonkin they have operation north
[55:31.600 --> 55:37.200]  woods that's declassified to stage 9-11 style attacks these corporate groups have taken over
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.800]  our country have stolen 28 trillion dollars the last two years bloomberg admits and reports
[55:42.800 --> 55:47.600]  in multiple reports prudential admits that they basically took the death benefits of six million
[55:47.600 --> 55:53.680]  veterans and the u.s. government made a secret deal with them the v.a. to steal it now i i mean
[55:53.680 --> 56:02.640]  the globalist didn't just kill a million iraqis uh in the last seven eight years in iraq and stop
[56:02.640 --> 56:08.720]  there we have corporate interests that control our government and they also have financed and
[56:08.720 --> 56:15.280]  protected radical muslim groups that's on record and so they create the crisis and then offer the
[56:15.280 --> 56:20.240]  solution i mean the smoking guns of 9-11 i'm going to write a story about that we've written many
[56:20.880 --> 56:28.480]  but dealing with the whistleblowers sabelle edmonds translator days before heard quote al-qaeda working
[56:28.480 --> 56:34.880]  for the u.s. government she told the 9-11 commission that enclosed hearings you want whistleblowers
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.920]  what about the police we've had on like bartmer and others who heard the countdown to blow up
[56:39.920 --> 56:43.920]  building seven then we have seen in with the video with the cops saying get back they're
[56:43.920 --> 56:51.120]  going to blow it up that building's coming down i mean the evidence goes on and on and on we know
[56:51.120 --> 56:56.080]  the official stories alive six of the 10 commissioners have said that and so they go find somebody
[56:56.080 --> 57:05.360]  unpopular like akmed denigine he comes out and says this but mixes israel into it and then they say
[57:05.360 --> 57:10.800]  oh my gosh see if you're a 9-11 truth or you're with akmed denigine no if you're 9-11 truth or
[57:10.800 --> 57:18.560]  you're someone who looks at the facts and lets the chips fall where they may and i was on the year
[57:18.560 --> 57:22.800]  years before 9-11 saying the government was going to stage major terror attacks two months before
[57:22.800 --> 57:26.400]  specifically saying they'll probably blow up the world trade center and blame it on their asset
[57:26.400 --> 57:31.760]  bin laden how did i know that i saw the media saying here's bin laden he's going to get you
[57:31.760 --> 57:36.800]  when he attacks we're going to take your rights to keep you safe i saw them priming it getting the
[57:36.800 --> 57:43.120]  public ready just like they primed that day and put out a secret roiders report this was later
[57:43.120 --> 57:49.760]  confirmed i even predicted it'd be roiders so who feeds the bbc and singing in that building seven
[57:49.760 --> 57:56.480]  fell in its own footprint from fires before it fell they did a full start kind of like new zealand
[57:56.480 --> 58:01.360]  australian and other papers reporting lee harvey oswald had been arrested for shooting kennedy
[58:01.920 --> 58:07.360]  it was published before he was even arrested and his name was in the news here they got their time
[58:07.360 --> 58:16.400]  zones off they made mistakes it's a false start just like they ran drills of the very trains and the
[58:16.400 --> 58:22.720]  very bus being attacked at the very same locations in the same time that day with the metro underground
[58:23.440 --> 58:30.000]  and visor consultancy they ran drills on 9 11 of the exact same targets being attacked the exact
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.400]  same time why because if the government or corporate groups staging the attacks get caught
[58:34.400 --> 58:39.360]  they tell the rest of the government that doesn't know oh we were part of a drill that's their cover
[58:39.360 --> 58:48.400]  they always have a drill you are listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today

[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.280]  we got the myack and homeland security reports from state and federal law enforcement separately
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.480]  and it reported that the number one threat is returning veterans gun owners conservatives
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:08.720]  libertarians ron paul supporters bob bob bob bar supporters second amendment groups and now
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:15.200]  they're out in the open they say yes homeland security is for the american people they sold
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.240]  it to you in the name of al qaeda but it's really for the american people this is the big issue

[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:48.240]  his second amendment group was listed by this private group that was paid 125 000 to spy on
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.160]  quakers anti-war groups groups against gas drilling second amendment groups tea parties
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.160]  he's basically everybody being spied on and he joins us now representative metcalfe thanks
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.040]  for coming on good to be where you think you're at me today let's start at the beginning when
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:11.360]  you first learned about this how your groups listed the group the the head of state homeland
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.320]  security for two weeks the pittsburgh post and others are reporting as in hiding won't talk to
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.880]  the media the governor's apologized there's lawsuits have been filed many are saying this
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.880]  is illegal what happened i mean let's start from the beginning well we actually had a taxpayer
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:33.040]  protest uh to protest on the budget situation here in pennsylvania back in june on june 8 and that's
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:40.160]  the first time that we were alerted that somebody has put out information that our rally that we
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:46.000]  were having on behalf of taxpayers in june to invite taxpayers to come to state capital pennsylvania
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.440]  share with their legislators that they're fed up with the excessive spending the excessive
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.720]  debt that they want to see less spending less taxes that that rally was actually announced on
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:00.880]  this institute of terrorism research and response and we had actually received a contact from our
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:07.920]  security people to capital back in june to let us know that there was this elevated terrorism
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:14.720]  alert that was sent out from this institute of terrorism with research and response and they
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.840]  had admitted misidentified another group being said that another group was associated with
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.560]  sponsoring the rally that i was actually sponsoring as a state legislator with some
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.320]  concerned citizens from around the state of pennsylvania concerned about state spending
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.880]  um and they write these reports for law enforcement to basically prejudice them
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:39.040]  against uh second amendment tea party groups you name it uh representative are you aware
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:43.040]  last year of the myack and homeland security reports where the federal government is writing
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:50.000]  these reports for the states demonizing returning veterans and gun owners i am exactly i find on
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.040]  to a letter with one of my colleagues here in pennsylvania to uh to uh let the administration
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:01.200]  know of uh um how offensive that was and how wrong it was so i that i'm a veteran the us army
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.800]  veterans might better myself i am a gun owner i have been uh for many many years since the age
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.960]  of uh i think 13 or 14 when i bought my first shotgun is a the young uh uh aspiring hunter in
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.960]  upstate new york so i i certainly fell into that list as a as a christian as a gun owner as a
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.720]  veteran uh which was a very offensive list that should have alerted every american that our
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:30.400]  government had gone off the track and uh and actually allowing this type of uh um assessment to be
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:37.520]  made about uh their citizens um especially uh law-abiding citizens and now we learn representative
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:43.600]  met calf that it's more widespread than we had previously known let's talk about the head of
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:50.240]  your state homeland security who's in hiding uh where he's hiding uh how do we find out uh lawsuits
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.880]  that are being filed over this and we'll talk about the private group that was hired with taxpayer

[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:33.360]  quakers anti-war rallies on alert list pennsylvania homeland security targeted tea parties and
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:36.880]  basically everybody under the sun and it turns out they were involved with the g20
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.160]  fingering groups that were arrested ahead of the summit one of my reporters was arrested
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:46.640]  while they were there in the police ask them are you a terrorist i mean this is insane
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:55.360]  and uh so specifically representative um we're hearing reports about lawsuits being filed uh
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.320]  that this could be criminal what do we know about this private group that was paid 125 000
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:08.880]  just last year to compile these lists well what i what i know is that this group compiled lists that
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:14.240]  they um targeted two of my rallies that i hosted one was a second amendment rally that you had
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.680]  mentioned uh which was actually our fifth annual rally for the right to keep and bear arms here
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:25.360]  in pennsylvania we've had speakers here to speak yet such as uh uh embass former bachender ellen
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.200]  keys we had winglock here from the one nr a larry craft from gunners america has been at all five
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.920]  of our rallies and spoke at all five of our rallies over the years had coalition a coalition
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.160]  of second amendment groups from across the state that have participated in these rallies we've had
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.880]  upwards of over a thousand attendees at last year's rally and probably seven eight hundred at this
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:51.600]  year's rally so our rallies appeared a rally that i've been the key um organizer of our second
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.720]  amendment pennsylvania that said five years in a row was on this list of the institute of
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.840]  terrorist and research and response they were employed by the pennsylvania homeland security
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:08.240]  to generate this type of information the director of homeland security um i sent a letter to just
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:14.800]  uh yesterday a day before yesterday um calling on the director of homeland security to is to
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:20.480]  give me information on what types of investigations or surveillance may have been an outworking
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.680]  of this alert as they uh did they play phone caps on any of my phone lines that were they
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.480]  surveilling the uh the rally or any of the participants of the rally that i hosted and
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.880]  organized how many of my advisors have been uh have come under the scrutiny of pennsylvania
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:40.320]  homeland security because of it so there's a whole host of questions that well they told my reporters
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.360]  in pittsburgh that you're going to be on list for the rest of your life literally for no reason
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:51.360]  they had done i mean and that's outrageous for law fighting citizens law fighting americans
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.880]  to uh to become out of scrutiny a big brother like this is uh is you know is there is the
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:02.400]  wrong use as an abuse of power um is it an abuse of our constitutional and a violation of our
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:07.600]  constitutional rights uh we we are going to be having a hearing uh the state senate in pennsylvania
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.680]  is going to have a hearing the uh veterans affairs emergency preparedness committee i believe the
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.640]  name of the official name of the committee under senator uh lisa baker next monday will convene
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:21.680]  a hearing that they've granted uh to themselves to be the power to try and get to the bottom of
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:27.360]  what's going on here and i just uh send the letter to uh senator baker yesterday to ask her to help
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.960]  me because it is a senate hearing i'm a member of the pennsylvania also presented so i won't be
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.080]  in attendance at that or able to participate in that hearing but i've asked senator baker to
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.280]  take my letter take my questions and pose those to those that they're uh questioning and and to
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.200]  those that they're trying to obtain the information from on monday to hopefully i'll have to get to
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.640]  the bottom of it but besides myself as an elected official um from uh you know elected by tens of
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.440]  thousands of citizens in pennsylvania to send me here to be their voice and take government and
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.680]  that my name uh rallies that i've been associated with actually um you know under my name uh appears
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.960]  on uh on this institute of a terrorism research group which and then we find out from looking at
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:12.320]  their at their website that one of their uh primary officers in this uh in this company is
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.760]  is an american hearing in york county pennsylvania but that's one of their key officers is a uh you
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:23.040]  know isn't as rarely um and it really appeared more that uh that this company more is based out
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.440]  of israel than it is out of the state um so you know there's questions concerning you know how much
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:33.360]  of this um you know i mean what's what's the link here between uh it's really defense forces that
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.280]  this company's claiming to uh work with and um what what's the contact with them aside i mean
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:44.720]  you know there's there's just a real theory feeling that people get um when you start hearing about
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:50.320]  this type of scrutiny this type of surveillance by a government that's supposed to be a servant
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.800]  instead of a master well representative met camp i know you're on the road today and you were nice
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.240]  to come on with us while you're on the road uh but i want people to really be able to clearly
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.280]  hear you it's intelligible we're having a little bit of a problem are you on a hands-free with your
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:10.960]  cell phone is that any better that's a hundred percent better all right i had a head and ear
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:16.160]  piece there that no i could i could tell we probably should have but okay now we can now
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:21.120]  i want you to start over with the israeli defense force connections because we've done some in-depth
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.720]  research on this and if so in pennsylvania papers this is clearly an israeli company
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.280]  now that the state head of homeland security this former special forces member of the army
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.640]  he will not do press interviews he's missing in action the press is reporting he's disappeared
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.120]  so that should be in the hearings as well but recap what you were just saying about the eerie
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:48.160]  feeling knowing that basically a foreign connected group to a foreign government is spying on second
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.880]  amendment rallies that a member of the state legislature has i mean this sounds like something
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.560]  out of selvia russia or something but it does it's uh it's it's something that you just seen
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.760]  see written in uh in some of those uh science fiction spy type novels or maybe something
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:09.360]  that you did hear about that happened in reality uh in in russia or in the eastern block countries
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:15.920]  of yesterday um but uh for for this company to uh it has a has one of their officers as
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:21.440]  revealed on their website that's out of york uh the york area here in pennsylvania york county area
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:25.840]  but then one of the other primary officers being a an individual who is in israeli and
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.040]  and really from the website looks more like it's an israeli based company than an american
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:35.440]  based company claiming that they have ties with them with the israeli defense forces um it really
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:42.800]  it really creates that eerie feeling that so many americans um express when you talk about big
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.520]  government or government infringing your constitutional rights um starting to uh starting to persecute
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.400]  american citizens because of their beliefs or their values and as someone who's elected by tens of
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.440]  thousands of pennsylvania and sent to the capital to be their voice to express their will in government
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.200]  to be their government to serve them in government and then to come under this type of scrutiny for
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:08.640]  rallies that i'm setting up with law-abiding citizens from across the state is uh is is
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:14.960]  outrageous and uh it needs to be um thoroughly investigated and needs to be uh prosecuted
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:20.240]  um to um ensure that doesn't happen again well clearly this is an attempt to intimidate people
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.880]  and to expand the israeli connection the southern property law center has some connections but the
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:31.600]  adl has been caught working with misad and more and more appears to be a foreign intelligence
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:39.760]  group operating in the united states and now this further connection uh in uh pennsylvania
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:46.720]  and and the the groups they listed mirrors the adl reports where we know the federal government
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.840]  gives them grants to come in and help write these reports what i'm saying is the public
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:59.440]  adl reports mirror the mayak the homeland security the secret now published uh pennsylvania reports
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.240]  and so what is israel i mean if england was doing this if china was doing it we'd be angry
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:09.280]  why is the federal government and the state government contracting with israeli groups
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:15.280]  to spy on american citizens well the answer is to chill political speech and i think there
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:20.640]  should be congressional hearings about this i i i agree with you 100 you know it's it's
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:28.880]  first of all i mean let no one um be mistaken in what they're hearing if this was a an american
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:34.560]  owned company it was doing the same exact thing it would it would be a violation of our rights
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:40.400]  a violation of our trust an abusive power i mean it would be outrageous and classic tyranny
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.520]  classic classic tyranny oh and that's that's exactly right it it's tyrannical and and when
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:52.640]  you and then when you involve a foreign owned company in this type of tyrannical behavior
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:59.600]  it it really gives that that eerie feeling of a mercenary type approach to hiring mercenaries in
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:05.520]  to actually try and intimidate and uh and and push your citizens back into a corner well let me
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.560]  expand representative metcalfe if you're at a computer or when you get out of your car uh type
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:18.880]  in in le national level exercise oh nine you will read from fema dot gov that 14 countries
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.120]  including israel but british and others were involved in a homeland security drill of tracking
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:32.240]  domestic extremists in a simulated war with the american people so this we know this is going on
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:37.680]  i've been covering this for specifically for more than 13 years or so but on air 15 but we know
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.160]  i mean i have watched in post articles where they've signed north american union agreements
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.200]  to use mexican and canadian troops to quote deal with american terrorist and then we have the
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:52.240]  homeland security reports where they say the number one enemy is returning veterans christians gun
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.240]  owners people that want to end the federal reserve i mean this is really happening and our brigade
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:04.480]  homeland army times reports is being trained by israelis uh i mean uh you could really expose
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.520]  this with these hearings when are these hearings coming up the the senate hearings are going to
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.480]  start on monday this coming monday and uh as i said i'm a member of the pennsylvania house that's
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:19.200]  not going to be hearing about not joint hearing it's just a hearing of one of the uh standing
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.600]  committees from the pennsylvania senate but it's but it's the beginning to try and try and get the
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:29.120]  bottom of this and try and gather more information i've sent my own my own request to the director
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.920]  of homeland security i'll be subsequently uh it looks like filing up here with some right to no
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:39.360]  request if you have information we can gather there but ultimately you know you're just uh you're
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:44.640]  just doing a you know follow-up on the abuse that's already occurred um that's certainly important
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:49.040]  to try and stop any future abuse but the abuses that have occurred i should be prosecuted the
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.520]  full extent of the law and as you said the congress and our state legislatures should
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:59.360]  investigate this to ensure that doesn't happen again now we put we we stop it now reportedly
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:05.920]  with this israeli foreign group uh the pittsburgh papers are reporting that they were involved in
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:13.440]  law enforcement uh wiretapping uh anti g20 groups uh so i think the the point you raise about where
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:19.360]  you being wiretapped your second amendment group i think that is very important i i i agree i mean
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.400]  we have individuals involved in our second amendment coalition from second amendment groups
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.040]  and sportsmen's groups that are across pennsylvania from east to west north the south we we have
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.920]  thousands tens of thousands of pennsylvania that are represented by the uh the groups that are
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:39.120]  involved with our coalition that's been uh the uh the catalyst for our second amendment rallies
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:44.160]  that we've held now five years in a row and we started these trying to stave off the attacks by
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:51.280]  the liberal gun grabbing uh governor that we have that came out of philadelphia at rindell um and and
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.720]  our i mean our we were very successful with it uh you know my work to try and uh bring an end to
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.800]  the illegal alien invasion working with state legislators for legal immigration dot com and
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.600]  senator pierce from arizona and many others uh we actually were noted um our work as state
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:10.720]  legislators for legal immigration uh in evasion pa reports that put together was noted in a un report
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:16.720]  back in early 2008 and that that kind of uh set you back on your heels a little bit when you realize
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.480]  that the that the un is uh is you know issuing reports with your name and it is a state legislator
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.680]  from the state of pennsylvania but then uh even furthermore when you realize that the not only
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.880]  you know is the un doing some of these sorts of big brother uh you know oversight tactics trying to
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.240]  trying to intimidate trying to uh push us back on our heels from standing up for the
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.640]  rights of americans for standing up for our nation but uh that we have individuals have
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:48.720]  been contracted out of country by our own government to do the same it's an outrage well
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:54.000]  representative met calf we know why they're contracting with the un and the israelis and others
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:04.800]  because many police are refusing to break the law and to spy on citizens without warrants to spy on
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:11.680]  mainline nonviolent uh groups that represent the majority of americans on top of it i mean over
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:16.320]  70 percent major polls are pro second amendment over 70 percent and gallant polls want to completely
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:24.240]  shut down the border so here they are trying to intimidate mainline dissent that's also constitutional
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:30.720]  and nonviolent of course they're having to contract with foreign groups uh to do this well
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.520]  that's what you know every one of our military personnel takes a note to uphold and defend
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:41.440]  our constitution and and our local elected to state elected our law enforcement certainly has
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:46.960]  the same responsibilities so in the majority of our law enforcement the majority of our military
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:53.600]  or patriotic citizens serving their neighbors um and can't be corrupted by uh by the tyrannical hands
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.000]  of that that would like to move them in this direction by representative met calf i want to
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.840]  ask a few more questions only got about eight minutes left with you and we appreciate uh the
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:08.720]  time here today uh but you know pulling back from this and looking at the big wide spectrum
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:14.880]  of what's going on what is happening to you is happening everywhere i know what's happening
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:21.280]  here in austin i know there's israeli groups and others spying on citizens uh i know that ron paul
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:27.040]  it came out in the news and tea parties have been spied on by the army the army leaked yours truly and
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:33.120]  others this stuff uh back in 2008 when our in the fed rallies had the army at them and the army
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:38.560]  reports said don't let them know your army they may attack you and and of course the army personnel
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:44.080]  were so upset by this they leaked the information to myself and others uh but this is outrageous and
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:50.080]  police and military and others need to know when you've got foreigners or the un or the israelis
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:57.040]  or anybody else telling you to spy on american citizens you have a duty i think to go public
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:02.160]  not just leak the information because this is a crime and i'm really pleased to see major
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:08.400]  pencil vanya papers talking about this being illegal right right i i i agree with you and that's but uh
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:13.440]  that's the only way that we're going to defeat this type of activity and protect american
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.280]  live liberty and properties of american citizens standing up whether they're in the military or
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.800]  whether they're in law enforcement or if they're average citizens that are being targeted by this
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.040]  type of activity people need to stand up and speak out not be intimidated well after all
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:32.080]  the united states is done for israel why do you think israel's so happy uh to have the adl demonizing
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:37.280]  gun groups and blue dobs in myself why do you think that there's other israeli groups you know
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:42.240]  running around spying on you i mean this is outrageous well that that was one of my one
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:49.520]  of my first thoughts was you know as as a as american citizen as a former soldier as one who
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:56.400]  has been very supportive of uh standing with israel against the uh the attacks that they have endured
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:03.520]  um by terrorists in in their area of the world that uh you know how how is it that they would be
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:08.480]  linked into this type of an activity for people from israel being linked in this type of activity
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:14.400]  that uh is targeting uh you know the very majority of the very people that would have been supportive
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:20.720]  of israel over the years if they had the question well it's outrageous and i'm glad you've got the
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:27.120]  courage uh to to to criticize it but i mean we can't more and more we see mercenaries being
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:33.200]  used domestically foreign groups this is not the mark of a society going into more liberty
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:40.960]  it's the sure sign of a society degrading into despotism that's that's exactly right and that's
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:47.200]  that's what americans people have to understand have to grasp have to have to get hold of before
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:52.960]  they become like that uh that frog that's fully cooked and that's the ever increasing temperature
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:58.000]  of the posture and um we we have to recognize in order to hold on to america to hold on to the
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.800]  freedoms that we cherish to hold on to those god-given liberties that are affirmed in our constitution
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:08.320]  that we're going to have to be vigilant they were going to have to be um very uh vocal and very
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.440]  active in standing up uh to our government to ensure that our government understands
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.360]  you weren't elected to be a master you were elected to be a servant now get into your
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:22.960]  servant's role serve us protect our freedom and stop screwing with us well representative you know
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.280]  i know a lot of police come up and shake my hand all over the country they're you know they're good
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:33.200]  men and women but just yesterday i saw in a neighborhood a warrantless checkpoint i pulled
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.720]  over on a side street got out politely walked over to the state police and i said hey troopers
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:44.400]  well what's going on out here and they just said none of your business i mean screamed at me this
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.200]  one guy bared his teeth and said get back in your car and leave and it wasn't a uh an arrest going
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.120]  on nothing happening they were just all out there setting up a checkpoint putting up a tent
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:57.840]  blocking part of the road uh you know i drove through and they were looking at me looking in
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.600]  my car so i thought well i'm not going to be scared of this i'm going to go confront this
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:05.360]  and ask polon and they and the guy and i said well i have a right to ask you what you're doing
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.120]  and he said no you don't and you're parked illegally and i wasn't i was in a neighborhood
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.760]  parked by you know at somebody's house and i didn't argue with him i just said man you're
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:19.360]  really treating me bad and you know more and more there's this attitude of we work for the
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:24.320]  government and we shouldn't ask the government any questions and as thomas jefferson said
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.440]  when the people are afraid of the government you have tyranny when the government's afraid
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:32.640]  of the people we have liberty that's exactly right and you know that as you mentioned the
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:38.720]  majority of our law enforcement are good men and women who are are interested in serving
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:45.760]  their fellow citizens um but but as with anything whether it's your politicians your ballplayers
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.920]  law enforcement wherever you find yourself working there's always someone that's going
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:54.000]  to be in that position that's going to allow the power to go their head well that was the issue
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.760]  i mean i mean i said what's your name trooper and he said it's sergeant baker to you and the
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:04.240]  other ones were kind of looking and smiling or you know looked uncomfortable because i literally
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:10.080]  walked up in a charming way and talked to him and uh in fact i hadn't even gotten near him he came
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:15.600]  over to me and i was real polite and i was about 20 feet from the other troopers and he just went
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:22.720]  crazy on me like i was his slave or something right well that's it it's important for our
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:29.760]  citizenry to uh support our law enforcement support our military uh but at the same time to uh just
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.920]  to make sure that they stand with the majority of those folks yeah and yeah they shouldn't act
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:37.760]  by the unlawful actions or unconstitutional actions of those that are in office or those that
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.320]  are in the bureaucracy that are violating the constitution or violating the law well exactly
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.800]  i mean he was acting like cops i've seen in third world police states i mean we know what
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:53.680]  tyranny looks like we know how it walks we know how it quacks and it's just scary but we know why
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:00.080]  it's happening most of the homeland security training over 90 percent is for mr metcalf
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.880]  representative metcalf it's for alex jones and i think people better understand that this was
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.760]  bipartisan these reports that we saw under obama sir i can send you the reports that were issued
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:16.080]  under bush he obviously didn't issue them himself but the bureaucracy at the top sees the american
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:23.280]  people as the enemy right well i think that's i think that's a uh a very a very uh good point
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.640]  i think it's one that people have to take the hard one that people have to recognize so that
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:31.360]  when they're exercising they're right to vote in november second when they're when they're
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:35.840]  carrying out and going through their lives they understand that you can't let your elected
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.840]  officials just get elected on november second they have a free ride the next two years or four
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.840]  years or six years whatever that term of office that we need american citizens to step forward
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:47.040]  to start holding their elected officials accountable so the elected officials actually
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.480]  hold the bureaucrats the bureaucracy that's gone so out of control accountable and to reign them back
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:57.440]  into being a servant of the people absolutely they are the servants and they're out of control on
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:01.840]  every front and they're given a green light to go wild and that's what's fueling this massive
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:07.520]  political awakening uh in closing i'd like to get you back on after the hearings and i hope that you
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:13.360]  will call uh for serious criminal investigations and i hope people realize this is going on everywhere

[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:23.520]  group targeted by basically israeli massad front group with the state and the feds of course erecting
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:29.760]  the whole situation it's all illegal they're in hiding hoping this all blows over his website
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:37.440]  is rep metcalf dot com you can also go to state legislatures for legal immigration dot com a group
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:42.400]  that he helps head up you got cut off by the break sir i wanted you to be able to finish your
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:49.280]  statements well thanks thanks for having me on alex but we're going to continue to try and
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:54.240]  uh dig the bottom this find out what's happened find out that what type of surveillance uh was
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:58.880]  taking place on myself and others that have been associated with me and working on trying to
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:04.240]  end up for the freedom that we enjoy as american citizens and you are the elected
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:09.520]  representative so homeland security bureaucracy had better not try to keep the legislature
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.720]  from finding out what they're doing that's the problem this is a state agency doing this that's
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:18.960]  exactly right that's exactly right uh we are the voice of the people we've been elected to serve the
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:24.160]  people and we're going to work to try and find out what's happened here uh in closing any other
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.720]  points you wanted to make uh and uh some of the other groups they were spying on as well
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:34.640]  why i think it's not even important for uh for all of your listeners to to become more actively
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.360]  involved in their government there's we do not have enough citizens that are actively involved
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:43.440]  in holding our elected officials accountable if we did have we wouldn't have this kind of out of
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:50.640]  control bureaucracy taking place absolutely and and this is across the political spectrum i mean if
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:59.920]  you are involved in lobbying for anything i mean such mainline groups left right libertarian religious
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:04.640]  i mean this group was spying on everybody and it wasn't even the state doing it because they
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.800]  clearly couldn't get their own people to break the law they hired a foreign group probably of
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.080]  massade operators to do it this is incredible that that's exactly right so when you when you have uh
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:18.800]  have the state department the home state department of homeland security contracting with
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:25.040]  an outside company that has strong Israeli ties uh it really makes you wonder just how far off the
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.760]  track our government's gone well we better pull up the floorboards and see what's buried under there
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.560]  and it certainly stinks and it's going to get a lot worse from here but it's going to get better
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:39.200]  in the end thanks to people like you out there representative metcalf god bless you and i look
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.240]  forward to getting you on uh next week from a landline after you've had these hearings sounds
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.480]  good all have a great day thank you so much god bless you folks pray for him and others
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:55.440]  and for the courage he's got uh this is just outrageous and the adl has said that i'm the
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:00.960]  number one enemy and you know why because i expose the feds are running the white supremacist groups
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.440]  that they then try to tie into patriot groups to demonize anybody who's for the constitution
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:13.760]  and that's something that that you know that information that the federal government has
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:19.280]  been caught in other groups over and over again funding white supremacists funding other organizations
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:27.120]  to then scare the left and scared jews and others into supporting tyranny and homeland security
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:34.560]  so they can get their donations this is a full spectrum dominance operation i told you how
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:40.160]  turner a decade ago was a fed it's admitted high-level national security asset of the fbi
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:48.880]  why do you think that within two hours in pittsburgh pennsylvania with that three dead cops
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:53.920]  that the media was saying the guy did it because he liked alex jones we searched the guy's name
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:37:00.560]  there he was on my own message board attacking us there he was saying i was bad for years they
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:09.040]  lied and said that to try to sick police on us why does the adl hate me so much because i'm not
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:17.680]  anti-semitic and i don't fight the new world order from that position the media wants to make it all
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:25.120]  about bashing jews so that it's politically divisive and destructive and that's why all
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:30.960]  of the major white supremacist organizations that the media gives attention to are even calling for
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:39.600]  my death and they're doing that because they work for the feds and many of these people
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:45.440]  then have camp followers who are not feds but are weak-minded who then buy into lies i got
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.680]  sent this morning a clip where somebody was saying i supported the israeli attack on the flotilla i was
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:55.040]  totally against that said it was wrong and tried to avert further things it's just it's lies it's
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.800]  lies about what i stand for lies about what i do and i've noticed i get this feedback hey go
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:08.160]  after israel more and when i do because the evidence is there i get attacked by these groups even more
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:14.560]  what's going on there what's happening there i got this representative on to expose this i'm
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:20.480]  going to get him on next week we've been reporting on this from day one pennsylvania is a hotbed of
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:25.600]  this my one of my reporters was arrested the police came to them and said we think you wanted to
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:32.800]  blow up a military base you're in terrorist databases now rob do was there at a military base
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:38.160]  was military and police at an old armory with people coming off trucks with hoods on their heads
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.880]  there were groups there snatching and grabbing citizens and forcing them into cars unmarked
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.280]  cars and it came out that it wasn't the army even though they're wearing army uniforms
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:52.880]  national guard uniforms that it was quote private contractors for the g20 a foreign multinational
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:59.280]  consortium of central bank heads comes to the united states same thing in canada a few months ago
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:07.200]  and in front of news cameras they jump out of unmarked cars and vans grab citizens and drag
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:15.200]  them into vehicles in fact youtube snatching grab g20 canada toronto snatching grab g20
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.680]  pittsburgh pennsylvania we can show quick clips of that for prison planet dot tv viewers we're
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:27.920]  not just radio folks were tv at prison planet dot tv because they want to scare you they want you to
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:32.480]  think if you go out to a demonstration sound cannons are going to blast you they want you to
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:36.240]  think that you're going to be snatched off the street and thrown into a truck and driven away
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:43.280]  they hire provocateurs admitted in denver denver post 2008 we said it looked like cops but we
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:48.560]  couldn't prove it turned out it was cops dressed up as anarchists attacking their own people
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:53.760]  same thing in montobello or monticello excuse me uh up in canada three years ago
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:02.080]  and here's the snatch and grab uh footage right now this is in pittsburgh pennsylvania men jumping
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.440]  out in military uniforms dragging an innocent person into a vehicle and it turned out those
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:12.720]  were private contractors probably for this israeli company it's admitted they were the main
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:18.800]  commanders of the operation we don't know if that was their people there so so so this is america
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:26.080]  now you can pull up the canada snatch and grab or uh private security grabs people off the streets
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:32.240]  at g20 that'll pull it up for you in canada it doesn't matter if it's england doesn't matter
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:35.840]  if it's canada doesn't matter if it's the united states doesn't matter if it's idly when they have
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:43.360]  these events the same thing is done it's global it's global they hire provocateurs they hire
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:49.280]  white supremacists to demonize the groups they hire cops to attack their own police to demonize
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.760]  demonstrations and that's why as the public gets angry and angrier they're still smaller and smaller
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.960]  protests because now you brave microwave guns sound cannons you have to go through literal
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:07.920]  hate ease on earth bob Chapman talked about 30 years ago being harassed by massad for no reason
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:12.400]  he wasn't even bashing israel at the time he wasn't even getting into those issues he was
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.880]  anti-fella reserve but see they want you to hate them they want you to come out so that they can
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:24.080]  then have that fight go on and they think the general public won't know what's happening it's
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:32.000]  it's very very scary ladies and gentlemen very very scary to to have all of this going on
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:42.960]  and it's just intensifying and that's why we need your prayers that's why we need your support
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.960]  because if i'm going to do this if i'm going to put it on the line i want to win and i know we

[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.160]  head of his political science department uh you know me and mainstream news says that one of the
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:22.080]  top experts in the world on communist china and he agreed with me that we're going into tyranny
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:30.720]  here he agreed that this is happening worldwide this is really going on and it's going to affect
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:35.440]  the enforcers you are the group in the greatest danger those of you that carry this out remember
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:39.680]  people being ordered to torture into the white house memos to the pentagon confirm john you
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.240]  albert consolage george w bush dick cheney the minutes of the meetings ordering the torture
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.360]  pentagon saying we don't want to do this we're not going to be able to complain when our people
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.760]  get tortured in the future it'll destroy them around the military and it will be a horrible
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:58.000]  pr problem and it's illegal and they said you do it not to stop terrorists they fund the real
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.880]  terrorist they fund those groups it's on record to create terror to create fear and to set the
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:10.160]  precedent for torture and then bush comes out three months ago and says yeah i ordered torture
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:15.600]  i do it again while there are scores of people in prison private contractors in us military
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.480]  who carried out the torture is ordered and i'm not saying they shouldn't go to prison they should
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.440]  but the biggest prison sentences should be for those that ordered it these people are in prison
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  for following orders and meanwhile bush is admitting he ordered torture and glenn beck is
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.440]  saying jack bowers a hero we need more torture now maybe he should apologize for that you know
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.600]  if beck would apologize for all this stuff he's promoted look you can't be the good guys and
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:48.720]  promote torture but you're put in a psychological position where you're put into fear so you'll
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:52.640]  go along with this but the good news is they had a gallop poll was it a gallop or was it a
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:44:00.480]  script tower news service well you guys search the term national poll only one percent of Americans
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:04.960]  think terrorism is the most important issue or is an important issue only one percent think
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:10.160]  terror is the most important issue and it was 40 what was it four percent just a few years ago
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:15.120]  we'll pull it up see my memory serves i know it was one percent i think it was 44 46 just two years
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:20.960]  ago in the same poll they do every year thought it was a number one issue gallop poll i was right
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.560]  let's let's put it on screen then please um i'm just showing you people hear me rattle all this off
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:30.480]  and think i'm just making it up because you know nobody could just rattle off all these statistics
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:35.760]  numbers and facts uh but i do the research i mean this is what i do this is how i live
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:43.360]  and the the globalists are trying to radicalize the patriot movement to make it fail and to make
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:51.360]  it be limited and and to make it not have a big tent for everybody divide and conquer is the program
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:45:01.600]  and it's sad and it's hurtful now there it is poll one percent see terrorism as top problem
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:05.200]  and it says 46 percent
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:12.960]  and previously thought it was the top issue right after 9 11 and i think later it reports
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:18.880]  similar numbers just a few years ago so i was correct okay memory serves uh before i go any
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.920]  further and get into a bunch of other economic news police state news media shake-up news global
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:29.760]  was to openly announcing again their one world government currency news uh i want to just remind
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.920]  listeners that we're listeners supported we don't have news core behind us we don't have big tax-free
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:39.440]  foundations we don't have the tens of billions a year and that's just what we know about a propaganda
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:46.640]  placement where the federal government takes your tax money and gives it to cnn nbc fox all of them
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:52.800]  remember i'd tell you about that over a decade ago i first learned about it because i hear local
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:58.400]  radio stations promoting in in one case this is actually 14 years ago austin air force
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:04.400]  austin air force isn't the isn't the military it was a government funded federally funded
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:11.760]  slash un funded group preparing everyone for carbon taxes uh and for increased emissions cost
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.200]  and they also want tracker boxes in your cars now they're openly announcing that so i heard
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:22.240]  in the news it being promoted that they were at different gas stations so i got in a car
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.800]  with my kanson in fact he has this video he can dig it out you put it on youtube the hundreds of
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:32.080]  the hundreds of great reports we filed in fact hanson i know you're listening right now will you
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.160]  please get that up on the mike hanson archives at youtube so much great stuff i know he's busy but

[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:47.680]  out we walk over and i said let me guess uh you paid for those newscasts that wasn't real news
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:53.120]  and he said yep sure did alex knew who i was and oh you know i am yeah i know who you are i said
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:58.560]  you're here to condition people to accept carbon taxes this is gotta be 12 13 maybe i think it was
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:06.000]  like 1997 i got 13 years ago and he just admitted it all on tape and so i called that local station
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.680]  up and i got a whole program director and i said uh were you paid to run that as if it was news he
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:17.760]  said yeah but i'm not going to talk to you about it i that's how i learned that most of the news

[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.960]  the money bombs coming up october 14th we've had hackers publicly saying hack our websites attack
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.840]  our sites to shut us down we've got death threats flowing in we've got other stuff behind the scenes
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:09.440]  that i'm not at liberty to talk about because it only encourages it my wife's a tough lady folks

[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.840]  literally stealing all our material and twisting it it's because we've got the truth we've got

[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:51.360]  television studio we're trying to do it as cheaply as possible but tim the guy didn't want his name
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:57.280]  known so i won't show it tim came in during the break with a ten thousand dollar donation for the
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:01.600]  money bomb coming up in october that drives it to over thirty thousand dollars we've raised
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:09.440]  but that sounds like a lot not when you've got 20 employees or contractors the equipment the 20
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:14.320]  plus thousand dollar bandwidth bill a month all of it we are having a huge effect thanks to you
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:19.200]  and thank you for the support uh to keith i'm just going to say that we have now raised because
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.280]  we haven't updated in a few days it was at 19 000 it's really about 23 000 we've raised

[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:43.120]  money bomb none of it goes to alex jones because obviously i keep some of the funds that come in
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.040]  here to fund my operation to have money in case we ever get sued to defend ourselves which has
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:56.560]  happened and i'm not going to get into it the point is is that is that i did this for the last
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:01.440]  two money bombs it's put separately and then it's used all of it for the equipment all of it for the

[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:55.200]  i'm sure that's what it is but the point is this film is word for word on his tv show yesterday

[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:12.720]  radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:22.320]  so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:31.840]  we are now into hour number three and boy he said it would happen a few months ago
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:42.560]  and it happened 1300 dollar gold today and bob Chapman is rarely wrong he hedged his bet though
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:48.720]  last week he said it'll probably back off he said it might hit 1300 but then back off we'll
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:54.720]  see in the next hour if he's right about that in fact what is gold right now but bob Chapman
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:01:02.560]  certainly called it max keiser was on what was it a few days ago and he said we're in a bear market
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:08.000]  for gold once the only one percent are actually buying gold right now of yuppies of the general
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.080]  public institutions banks are hoarding it buying it up but once two three four percent start buying
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:21.120]  it which is beginning some analysts on msnbc are talking about and cnbc 11 000 an ounce gold
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:27.280]  but i'll take 1300 of course for inflation it should be 25 or more 100 an ounce for 1980 numbers
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:33.760]  but bob of the international forecaster dot com you've been proven right yet again well i thank
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:40.640]  you and it's nice being that way and i have a very strong hand in my shoulder evidently
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:50.400]  and i'm appreciative of that today we fiddled around close to the 1300 area although october's
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:57.120]  still trading and the spot market i think was up close to four dollars so that puts it around
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:05.120]  1295 and it's very surprising that we would get this kind of result and the reason why is that
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:11.680]  normally uh this week wednesday thursday friday and then monday a gold should have been backing
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:20.880]  off and the reason why is that on monday it's gold and silver option expiration and at 1300
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:30.720]  are higher there's 46 000 contracts that are in the money and uh if gold on monday closes above
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:40.320]  1300 uh there's going to be billions of dollars lost by the commercials on comics who happen to be
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:47.840]  big banks so we could see some real we could see some real fireworks next week we certainly could
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:54.160]  and the gold is telling us that it's it's going higher uh even with all the selling that's going
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:03:05.120]  on by the commercials who have record positions in the short side net uh in gold and silver bullion
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:12.080]  as well as the shares and so i think what we're going to see here is a good chance of a closing
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:19.920]  over 1300 and uh if that happens there'll be big losses and then i think gold and silver will take off
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:28.240]  now go higher bob i interrupted you there when you talked about who is going to be uh short
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:32.800]  who's going to be in trouble next monday if it closes above or right at 1300 you were saying
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:38.000]  the big mega banks that have been trying to suppress it that's right now how much trouble
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:45.120]  on the net basis spread out among the firms you know remains to be seen uh but the players
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:54.240]  are the big ones jp morgan chase goldman sacks city group uh dutch banks hsbc and there's others but
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:01.520]  they are the biggies and they probably have the largest uh net short positions and they
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:10.160]  will lose the most amount of money on those uh long gold and silver options uh silver has
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:17.760]  been trading uh quite strongly today uh early early this morning uh around four o'clock
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:27.920]  it was up 16 cents and recently it was up 19 so it it it held its gains all day which
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:35.440]  again is surprising but it's terrific especially if you have been buying gold and silver coins
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:40.960]  or bullion from mitis well stay there we got to go to break bob chapman we'll find out why this
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:45.440]  happened obviously you said net last week if on monday and tuesday the federal reserve
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:49.600]  announces they're going to start monetizing more debt more quantitative easing that this was going
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:54.160]  to happen they did do that what does that mean for the overall economy we know what's happening
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:59.360]  with commodities like gold but what does this mean overall for me it means an acceleration
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:04.160]  of implosion stay with us this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:09.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your

[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:20.480]  of the resistance you're listening to the alex jones show i know our audience is very sophisticated
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:25.040]  bob Chapman but we're on so many am and f of affiliates and have new listeners they're like
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:32.080]  why should i care about gold or why should i care of the dollar c value or why should i care if the
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:36.560]  stock market plunges well if the stock market plunges that then destroys a lot of companies
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:41.360]  that employ americans if gold's going up it means the dollar's being devalued and there's
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:46.320]  monetization of debt going on the same thing that happened in the weimar republic
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:55.600]  mexico argentina i mean the list goes on and on nigeria zimbabwe uh i mean this is a big deal
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:01.360]  that they openly congress has admitted tried to suppress the price of gold the big central banks
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:08.720]  and they're failing and now that it's touched 1300 an ounce this morning uh you know even though the
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:13.840]  big banks were betting against gold and and trying to push it down they're failing uh
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:20.800]  uh what does this overall signify in the economy and where do you see gold going uh you know ask
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:26.240]  the same question that bloomberg put out a month ago that the majority of the futures on gold
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:33.440]  in the us in the month of december at 1500 dollars or more i mean why would they be betting on 1500
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:39.520]  in december if it's not going to go there well they think it's going there and that's why they are
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:49.520]  and if you look at the uh go long option positions uh there's 46 000 contracts that are that would be
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:58.880]  in the money so to speak on monday if gold closes among about 1300 and i would guess that part of
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:06.160]  those contracts that were purchased were purchased by people who are a long gold bullion and uh
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:12.080]  it's my suspicion that they're going to try to kick it over 1300 so they'll be able to collect on
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:17.520]  their bet and of course the commercials are fighting back as hard as they can but it's not
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:24.320]  working okay but for new listeners explain what short and long means explain this short is when
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:32.880]  you bet something is going down whether it's gold or silver or the market or a particular stock
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:43.040]  when you're long you are betting that the security of the gold or the commodity is going up and so
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:52.480]  what the commercials which are the banks on comics do is they will sell long contracts to other people
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:58.960]  and they will try to continue to suppress the price in this case of gold so that it doesn't
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:08.320]  go over 1300 because of the 46 000 contracts about 25 000 of them are at 1300 or higher
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:15.760]  and this is why this is titanic battle going on right now it'll be over on monday but the price
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:22.640]  of gold and silver both are showing that they want to go higher and of course this is terrifying
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:28.000]  the commercials because they're representing the united states government who are actively
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.840]  and have been actively suppressing the price of gold and silver for a long long time like back to
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:42.960]  1988 and so this is a big event and once it breaks up which i believe it will silver could go to
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:48.560]  thirty dollars pretty easily because there's a monstrous short position in silver by jp morgan
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:12:00.240]  chase and hsbc which makes up about 42 of the net shorts and also in the price in the futures of
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:08.000]  gold and silver they're very prominent as well and they continue or have continued for the past
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:14.160]  several weeks to increase their net short position and so if gold breaks out over 1300
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:23.200]  and silver continues upward uh there's going to be short covering meaning that they have to buy back
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:29.840]  what they sold and when they do that they make the price go higher so silver could go to 30
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:36.640]  dollars in the next several weeks and gold could go to 1500 and that's why you'd see the december
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:43.600]  contracts at 1500 are loaded up because there's a lot of people out there and most of these people
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:49.760]  who are in that market are professionals on the long side and the banks are on the short side
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:58.000]  and and they think it's going there and i do too i mean if you go back to 1980 and you use the
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:05.600]  formula used by the u.s. government for inflation gold should be selling close to 2400 an ounce
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:12.720]  if you use real inflation without the government bogus figures that they've been putting out since
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:20.960]  then uh you've got 7700 an ounce i mean this is fundamentals i mean this is not something
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:26.560]  we're guessing about this is a reflection of what really has gone on so gold and silver are going to
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:39.360]  go higher i you know we went long in june of 2000 and gold was about 260 coins were selling for
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:48.240]  uh somewhere in the vicinity of 270 dollars a piece and now they're selling for over 1200
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:55.760]  stocks that we had people purchase was selling at 85 cents and four dollars and five dollars
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:03.440]  now they're at 20 and and 45 and 70 dollars a share and we don't we don't encourage people
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:09.840]  to trade you're in a trend you go with the trend it's your friend the biggest bull market in history
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:16.320]  is right before our eyes massive amounts of money being made made in the gold and silver
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:23.120]  related asset market and this is only the end of phrase phase one we've got phases two three
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.680]  and four to go these are waves that are coming and so people should be in there and they should
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:36.240]  be out of the stock market in general except for gold and silver shares and bonds the bond market
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:41.520]  is a bubble one it's going to break i don't know but somewhere along the way it is
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:49.920]  now what does that signify overall about the health of the economy we saw on monday bob
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:55.040]  the federal government came out and said to the recession this is a good joke ended in june of
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:15:00.960]  last year so 15 months ago uh when every major economic indicator the feds put out which are
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:07.520]  cooked themselves shows we're in a deep ongoing recession and most analysts even mainline analysts
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:12.880]  are saying we're going into a depression well it just shows you how evil they are and how
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:20.720]  badly construed the propaganda is and how blatant they are and what they do desperate people do
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:27.680]  desperate things and they are in serious trouble because there's no way back after june of two
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:34.800]  double oh three the dye was cast there was no turning back for the people who were involved in
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:42.400]  bringing the the markets down and and doing what they did within the economy with real estate
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:50.320]  that really kicked this thing off and so uh what can we expect uh we can expect inflation will be
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:58.320]  higher uh we can also expect that it could turn over the next two or three years into hyperinflation
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:06.320]  maybe even quicker than that and we also can expect that the economy and this is the question
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:13.600]  really that you asked the economy even if they inject another 2.5 trillion dollars including
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:24.080]  any legislative stimulus like they did uh in the last 17 months the best they can do is grow gdp
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:30.160]  by 1 percent and it may be worse than that and so what are we looking at we're looking at a sideways
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:38.000]  movement that's not going to improve employment uh you should see the letters i get from people
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:44.160]  they're heartbreaking i just got one from montario the man's been out of work for seven years because
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:51.440]  his job was outsourced to uh china and he was in the automobile industry and it goes on and on and on
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:57.360]  i mean people who've worked all their lives who are retired they don't have anything
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:04.960]  you know can you lend me some money i i can't pay my bills i can't even shop for groceries
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:10.720]  and this is only the beginning of this nasty disaster can you imagine when it's going to
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:16.160]  going to be like a year or two from now and so it's not good well they're just going to come on a
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:19.840]  year was wrong well they're going to come out in a year or two and just tell us the economy is
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:24.800]  wonderful we could both be homeless in the streets like the great depression they'll say it's great
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:32.800]  well if you look at the homeless centers and if you look at the centers where they give out free
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:38.800]  food people are lining up at midnight and two in the morning to be there when they open at night
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:46.320]  o'clock uh i just put a tape uh a link into the forecast of a tomorrow where i viewed these people
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:53.040]  and then the galaxy people just like you and i normal everyday hardworking people
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:18:02.160]  who lost their jobs are retired or they're ill and they don't have anything i mean what is it
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:07.360]  going to be like two years from now never mind mind what you know fall four or five years from now
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:12.880]  it's going to be awful and they're not doing anything to fix it they're just throwing money
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:18.800]  at it and most of the money is being thrown into the hands of wall street and banking
[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:29.920]  and it's just getting worse and worse and worse by the minute i bob i want to go to break
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:34.960]  and i want to later get into some other news and get your take on it dealing with the economy and
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:41.680]  some geopolitical developments but i want to open the phones up specifically for economic
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:47.040]  questions for you now folks a lot of times we have totally open phones on any subject or i say first
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:53.360]  time callers but sometimes i say specifically for our guest on the economy that's the questions
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:19:04.400]  we're going to be taking for bob Chapman 1-800-259-9231-1800-2599-9231 on any questions or comments
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:10.480]  you have on the economy with this quantitative easing with the announcements they're going to
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:17.440]  monetize more debts where do you and your gut expect gold to be in december bob oh i think it'll
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:24.720]  be 15 1600 and silver could be as high as 30 dollars announced but 25 to 30 would be a good gain
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:31.120]  and you know we announced on this program 10 weeks ago that we were going to have quantitative
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:36.080]  easing and nobody came out with that besides me and now we're going to have it and another very
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:43.040]  important event was the loss of larry summers who is one of the architects of the suppression of
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:47.680]  gold and silver which means if anything we're going to have a better chance of beating the
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:54.720]  government at their own game because their brilliant architect is now leaving but there it is replacing
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:59.680]  him with some other puppet we'll be right back with bob Chapman on the other side your phone calls

[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:19.840]  let's go directly to your phone calls for bob chatman on this friday edition i'll be back
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:23.840]  sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central for the very early broadcast don't forget about that
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:29.040]  eric in illinois you're on the air with bob chatman go ahead hey bob chatman just a quick
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:35.840]  question just wondering uh what percentage would you recommend uh to put uh for someone to put
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:40.880]  their investment into gold you know a lot of people say diversify but you know is this or we
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:45.520]  had a point where we should diversify just between gold and silver and that's about it or what would
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:51.200]  you recommend for something like this well i feel uh gold and silver is the only place to be it's
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:57.200]  the only place your money is safe and there's no guarantees of anything of course but i've
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:05.680]  done this for a long long time and uh my assets are totally in gold and silver and so uh and i
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:14.640]  continue to buy all it you know whenever i can and so uh for those of you who think about diversification
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:20.560]  how can you diversify diversify safely when you get a bond market that's in a bubble and you don't
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:26.720]  know when it's going to burst and you got a stock market that's overpriced uh the pensions for
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:33.520]  these fortune 500 country companies are all underfunded they're going to have to take that off of
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:41.120]  their uh earnings next year in order to fund them up so to speak and then if the market goes down
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:47.280]  in the coming year they're going to have to fund them further and that means less profits
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:53.440]  and so if there's less profits coming next year that means that the stock market will go down
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:58.720]  and that all feeds on itself so if the market went down to where it was a year and a half ago
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:07.040]  on the data 6550 you would be looking at major companies that weren't making very good earnings
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:13.440]  and that would mean that there would be tremendous pressure on the general stock market on bonds
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:18.160]  and the only place to go would be commodities of gold and silver so the answer is
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:23.760]  gold and silver all the way all right well you know I listened to you pretty intently and
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:31.280]  Alex Jones pretty intently uh so uh looks like uh you know as soon as uh i get off this unemployment
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:34.960]  start making some real money i guess it's all going to go into golden silver so i want to thank
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:39.200]  you guys for what you do thank you yeah you know i bought a lot of silver because it's
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:43.600]  inexpensive comparatively and a lot of the silver i bought was at five six seven you know eight
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:48.320]  dollars an ounce i've bought i haven't bought a lot since it went up is having you know really had
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:57.280]  the funds but i mean you know the silver i've got has all gone up three four times what it was
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:02.800]  previously and bob am i correct in saying that silver is even more suppressed than what it should
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:08.400]  be than gold yes that's correct because jp mogen chase in hong kong shanghai bank
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:14.720]  and have made a life's work out of suppressing the silver price now that's breaking away to the upside
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:19.600]  they're going to have to cover their short positions and that's going to propel silver
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:28.560]  probably more strongly than than any propulsion that gold would have and so uh there's probably
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:35.440]  much more upside at least in the short term in silver uh than there is in gold although i think
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:41.680]  they'll go over time in tandem and so what you do is just split your investment put part in both
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:47.920]  yeah i want to be specific though you know i'm no financial guru like bob chatman or even a lot of
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:53.920]  the mainline analyst agreeing with the things he's saying or somebody like max keiser but when i bought
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:59.440]  gold at 300 an ounce and it went up to 500 and went down a little bit i didn't sell it and when i
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:05.120]  bought gold at 900 an ounce and it went up to a thousand i didn't sell it and when it dropped back
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:11.920]  down to 900 i didn't sell it and when i bought gold you know at 800 and now it's 1300 i'm not
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:15.760]  selling it and if they manipulate things for a while when it goes down a little bit i'm not
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:20.800]  going to sell it then i'm in this for the long haul and if you look at a 10-year graph on golden
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:26.400]  silver it's going straight up correct bob now that's my take on it and i've been doing this for over
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:32.640]  50 years and at one time for 28 years i was the largest gold service stockbroker in the world
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:38.720]  so i certainly have a lot of experience in the area and i know every blip for the past 50 years
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:45.440]  that's happened in that genre so to speak and so yes you're right it's going to go up because all
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:51.600]  the currencies in the world and are in trouble they have all fallen for the last seven years
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:59.440]  against gold if you look at compound increases in the price of gold over the last nine years
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:05.920]  it's just under 20 percent of year a year no other investment has returned that over that
[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:12.000]  last nine years and it's going to continue and wall street isn't even in on it the public
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:18.320]  isn't even in on it yet i mean wait'll buying starts in earnest well what do we got two percent
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:23.840]  of the public in the united states and gold and silver what's going to happen when we replicate
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:32.480]  what went on in 1980 when we had about 15 percent of the population in gold and silver
[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:36.560]  if they're going to go ballistic all right uh we gotta go to break i want to try to hurry through

[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:20.720]  run it know the big mega corporations run it that's the big secret okay uh but i briefly wanted
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:26.480]  to bring ted anderson up while bob Chapman was here uh because i keep explaining this week to week
[02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:31.120]  with folks you know going back two months ago when gold was way down when they artificially
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:34.960]  depressed it and bob said it would pop up like a beach ball because of all the fundamentals
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:38.560]  and the other analyst and we have a bunch of analysts on who basically concur
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:44.240]  ted was then didn't raise gold prices he sold out of that golden silver at the lower price
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:49.280]  now in the last three weeks or so he's bought more golden silver when it was
[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:56.080]  you know something like a hundred dollars less in gold several dollars less in silver per ounce
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:01.360]  now he's passing on those savings but i talked to ted this morning it's going to run out this
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:05.360]  weekend there'll be another price increase then you're getting gold he got two weeks ago it'll

[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:38.880]  joining us thanks for having me up again again 800 686 237 i'll just ask you uh those are some
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:45.040]  pretty good deals bob i personally i can't find stuff lower what's your take on it well i think
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:50.560]  you're right uh they're certainly competitive and in many many instances they're lower than what the
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:57.200]  general market is but you know prices vary all over the place but they're goodbyes and you should
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:04.160]  take advantage of them you know my feeling is this every month i buy and i don't care what it costs
[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:09.520]  i don't even ask what it costs i just say look this is how much money i've got and this is what i
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:16.880]  think i want to buy it in this genre this week and uh and get it for me and that's what happens
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:24.400]  and so when you're in a long-term bull market even though prices might be super that ted is offering
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:30.800]  that's great but more importantly you just keep on buying because it's the only safe place to be
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:39.040]  absolutely 800 686 237 i i feel really good uh bob i mean if it wasn't for ted i wouldn't have had
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:45.040]  this platform for this radio show i think god i got with ted now almost 14 years ago and i feel
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:49.840]  good that 10 years ago when gold was 260 an ounce that i looked at all the evidence and i thought it
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:55.440]  was good for me and so i tell people what i think is good and look what's happened i i feel good
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:01.280]  about telling folks in ron was a scam two years before it came out i feel good talking about
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:06.960]  bernie made off before it came out i feel good you know just continuing to be accurate because
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:12.960]  really it's not rocket science the mainstream media lies and spins and they know the truth as well
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:17.680]  i mean look the neocons knew about world government 20 years ago when they were telling you it didn't
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:21.280]  exist now they're letting you in on the big secret that there's a world government but
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:25.520]  they're going to be the gatekeepers and they'll tell you what's a conspiracy theory and what isn't
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:31.040]  come on folks look you've done your own research out there and we're spot on with what we've put
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:35.440]  out what we've said let's go to ed and louisiana then woody taylor brian david and others ed you're
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:40.880]  on the air with bob javin ellis thank you for taking my call bob it's a pleasure speaking to both
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:46.160]  you gentlemen and listen i have been talking to people in certain circles and uh when i tell them
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:51.360]  about this gold frenzy and i ask them about it they laugh at me they tell me that uh people are
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:57.120]  being tricked into buying out the coffers of the baxter gaster so that when they crash the world
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:03.840]  economy will need to use gold to purchase their new currency therefore keeping them in power
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:10.080]  after the phoenix rises from the ashes they say that gold you what do you make with gold gold the
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:16.560]  only purpose of it is to make jewelry so i mean if you're if the world economy crashes are you
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:21.280]  going to want earrings and necklaces for your children or you don't want food and water if you
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:26.480]  keep buying and selling gold you're keeping the same baxter gasters that are going to crash this
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:32.320]  world economy in power you keep going that's a good rant i'm going to let you counter and i'm
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:40.160]  glad you called but let me be specific here i heard that when gold was 260 an ounce 300 400 500
[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:48.400]  600 700 800 900 1100 1200 1300 and people then say they could come and confiscate it like 33 well
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:52.800]  most people didn't turn it in they could come and take your kids today if you let them they could
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:58.560]  i mean you know the italy suspended naked body scanners yesterday and is pulling them out because
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:05.920]  of mass revolt now do we have you know the same machismo or whatever it is the italians have got
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:10.400]  i mean i mean our our americans as good as the italians i know the italians actually don't
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:14.800]  put up with a lot of bull i'm a you know we're about to get the naked body scanners removed
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:19.040]  they're in deep trouble the airlines don't want them it's admitted they're saving the image and
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:24.640]  now you're saying what's that to do with gold well i mean we we have to say no to this of course
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:29.120]  they can manipulate gold down the road they're doing it right now they're trying to suppress it
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:34.080]  they're demonizing it they're having congressional hearings with the people supported by the federal
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:38.560]  reserve with weiner and others let me finish this is i want to get bobs taken then you'll get your
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:43.760]  take ad but you you know you threw all this out you're full of adrenaline that's fine the globalists
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:50.560]  are buying up a lot of gold because they understand that they've sold all these derivatives is gold
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:57.360]  perfect no is silver perfect no but more gold's being sold every year now than can be mined
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:03.840]  than they can find okay gold is devalued from where it should be this is that really i agree with
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:10.480]  the kaiser of a bear market we haven't even seen the bull yet it should be 2,500 or more for 1980
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:17.360]  adjusted inflation okay so we've been right all along and then we have arguments you know should
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:22.080]  we have a gold back currency should we not have a gold back currency i've had both groups on
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:29.040]  to promote both perspectives but it is sheer lunacy i get these emails that you know that i'm bad
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:35.040]  because i okay okay i'm bad i told listeners that 200 to 60 to get gold and it just hit 1300
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:38.480]  i'm bad that i said they're going to blow up the world trade center and blame it on their asset
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:44.640]  been lied i'm bad because i said that the copenhagen you know treaty was going to be shot down
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:50.640]  because we got those emails i people for two weeks said it was fake that i had the myack report
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:58.080]  okay look we're real we have a track record and i just don't know what to say to you when it's up
[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:05.360]  400 in the last 10 years and a meteorite could hit the planet and kill us all tomorrow you could be
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:10.720]  struck by lightning i mean anything could happen but but but but to say that the that this is a
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:16.080]  big setup with the banksters the banksters are out demonizing gold and in all their global
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:22.480]  stock market moves trying to drive it down but you're saying no they wanted up bob chatman your
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:29.760]  comments on this well they certainly do not want it up and yes they do own gold the central banks
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:36.960]  don't own own as much as they had before and out of 32 000 tons they probably get 5000 tons left
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:42.880]  maybe as much as 10 but no more than that they spent more than half of its suppressing prices
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:49.360]  gold production and silver production continue to drop every year because there was no investment
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:56.560]  in uh gold is used in so many industries and silver is used i've seen all the major market
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:02.400]  analysis that they're not getting enough silver for all the semiconductors i mean what is listen
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:06.160]  briefly briefly because i got to be fair to woody and taylor and brian i always keep people
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:12.320]  that disagree on longer ed you sound so angry you sound so angry yo i guess we're the new world order
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:17.280]  we're the bad guys here i mean are you saying people shouldn't have got gold at 260 an ounce
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:25.200]  and made a 400 profit alex i'm not saying that at all all i'm saying is then believe you me you
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:30.080]  have come up and you have made me aware of a lot of things by listening to you and researching what
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:37.040]  you say i have been uh enlightened by your work i have to tell you that i'm not saying your new
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:43.680]  world order i'm saying but i'm saying your friends no but i get these emails where where it's a
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:48.880]  globalist plan to drive up gold when they're on record and with their actions look your friends
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:55.280]  are wrong and and and and that's all i can say i appreciate your call uh ed a brief response uh
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:03.440]  to to what ed was saying bob Chapman how i can say is uh your friends better not show up at my house
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:10.560]  when they don't have any money because uh they didn't buy any buy any gold and silver well i mean
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:15.040]  no one ever said it was going to be perfect if things completely collapse and that's why we
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:23.280]  say food guns gold silver but more importantly gardens knowing your neighbors having a plan
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:29.040]  again i mean we cover it all all we give is solutions states rights getting active standing
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:36.000]  up to tyranny it's it's just i mean we i just don't get how we've been completely right about
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:40.640]  everything bob frighteningly so because we know history and we know our enemy and
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:46.960]  but i guess i guess it is the messengers that always get their heads chopped off bob
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:54.000]  and that's okay and that is perfectly okay uh because our only motive here is to help people
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:48:00.320]  and what is very disconcerting and very disappointing to me is that so many others
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:06.720]  don't have the perspective that we have and understand very simply how this all happened
[02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:12.880]  and who is behind it well i i mean i get this all day that i'm supporting a gold standard because
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:18.400]  i've had ron paul on with his von mis institute view and i've had other groups on and i promote
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:24.320]  films like the secret of oz with a fiat version and i'm just we're having a debate we're i mean
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:31.600]  we're having a discussion it's it's amazing sometimes but i'm not mad at ed i just frustrated
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:37.760]  let's talk to woody in seattle woody you're on the air hey thanks alex i just want to say that

[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:57.360]  many cops have sent me letters i mean i don't want to get into the whole story but one of the cops
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:04.880]  that sent me the mayak report said that all of the state police in his group are totally into
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:08.960]  the show now you know why he convinced them six years ago to start buying gold and they're all

[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:28.800]  middle also you're an officer too i'm retired 25 years uh fab where's the sovereign debt crisis
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:33.840]  going i know it's out of the news now i know it hasn't gone away and uh where do you see that
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:39.840]  leading in the next uh the next 12 months so you see it reemerging uh you see it uh coming back in
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:44.160]  the spotlight and uh and where it's ugly head and it's so where's it going to take us with regards
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:50.720]  to gold and uh and our currency are you referring to grief and the others that are in trouble over
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:56.960]  in europe the pigs that's right that's right right well you know it's it's fluid it's ongoing
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:03.760]  and uh they've had demonstrations for the last couple of weeks uh particularly this past week
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:12.240]  and i was on uh greek radio again this uh past week and uh and told them you know what i thought
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:20.160]  and i think first of all germany says we're not going to put up any more money now there's a group
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:25.760]  of nations that put up almost a trillion dollars uh it's not going to be enough now they'll need three
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:34.480]  or four trillion uh and and it's not going to be forthcoming so ultimately the sovereign nations
[02:50:34.480 --> 02:50:40.800]  in europe and then in england and then in the united states are all going to default they have to
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:45.120]  there is no way who do you think's next i mean is it going to start in asia europe here
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:53.840]  oh i think it'll definitely start uh in europe and england and then here okay i hope that answers

[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:39.840]  hi hi bob y'all are a beacon of light in a dark world i like what y'all are doing for us um i just
[02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:45.760]  wanted to ask uh bob a couple of questions well two real quick questions one you know as the uh as
[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:52.080]  the economy gets worse and as gold rises and you know as this whole you know situation degrades
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:57.120]  itself are there any certain commodities that we should be looking at as well you know their
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:03.120]  increase as well as gold you know against the the the waning decline of the dollar and second
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:08.560]  i have a father who owns a uh a sheet metal aluminum manufacturing business manufacturers
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:12.880]  like metal panels and stuff like that and they get all of their steel from either mexico china
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:17.920]  overseas you know that dropping dollars should help him because he'll more manufacturing will
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:23.280]  happen that's the one the silver lining was it was was that your question yes sir okay bob a quick
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:29.680]  answer please sir uh the first part of it while you get sidetracked in the second part because
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:36.320]  they started thinking about other things the first part was what was the first uh looking at at
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:41.600]  different uh commodities versus the dollar oh i got the answer for you first of all oil and
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:50.000]  petrochemical uh uh products are are dicey and and so where do you go you go to the food the
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:58.080]  softs and the beans you go to corn wheat soy beans no russian food and no russian wheat exports this
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:02.720]  year that'll that should drive weed up right well wait a minute how about where they get a 40 the
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:10.560]  worst drought in 47 years in brazil i mean that that is a big producer and of course coffee as well
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:17.520]  will be cut back but go into the food items and i've been recommending that since the beginning
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:22.560]  of the year and the reason i did is i had farmers come to me who was subscribers and they said what
[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:28.400]  do i do i get silos full of this stuff and i said you hold on to it in the summer and into the fall
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:34.080]  the prices will be much higher and fortunately i was right again no right again that's why you're
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:43.520]  so evil no devil trade from you now they just hate us because we're so right bob hey god bless
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:47.600]  you uh taylor one more and i'm sorry to david and jam will go to brian and south carolina
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:53.920]  you're our tail gunner brian hit us and hit us hard hey alexa hey um bob first questions for bob
[02:56:54.480 --> 02:57:00.240]  do you think that the demand for silver and gold increases or decreases the price of gasoline i just
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:04.080]  want to get your opinion on that well that's a controlled mega cartel that's what he just said
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:10.960]  it's dicey but generally it's an uptrend correct bob well yeah i think platinum is used in the
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:20.320]  cracking process is it not i'm not sure about uh gasoline i'm not sure but other than that um platinum
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:26.960]  and palladium uh they operate on their own and they've done quite well quite frankly in fact better
[02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:31.120]  than silver and gold have and the main reason is that they're not suppressed by government
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:37.680]  anything else brian yeah well one more question for bob and then i got one quick one for you
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:43.520]  um i guess what i'm coming from is as you see people begin to choose and juggle the two different
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:48.240]  options as far as currency when they look at gold silver and dollars and all of these things
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:53.120]  what i was thinking was you know what effect does that have on the value of silver compared to the
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:59.600]  dollar compared to the price of gas because you can see sometimes you know the price of gasoline
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:04.320]  it almost seems is what is holding our economy together that's what's in the back of currency
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:09.360]  yeah well generally when other commodities go up you'll see fuel go up but bob is that correct
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:17.200]  that's correct and don't forget if gold and silver are going up if gasoline stays the same or even
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:22.320]  if it goes up it's not going to go up at least in the last 10 years that's what we've learned
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:27.440]  it's not going to go up more than what the value of your gold and silver are i'm out of time ryan
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:32.320]  what was your quick question for me it's this um you're talking about flow out in the water
[02:58:32.960 --> 02:58:38.240]  i've got a theory on that i feel like there we our bodies are being chlorinated because they're
