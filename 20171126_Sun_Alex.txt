[00:00.000 --> 00:18.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.200 --> 00:30.800]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones ladies and
[00:30.800 --> 00:36.840]  gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide on this November 26 2017
[00:36.840 --> 00:42.760]  Sunday edition thank you for joining us I am your host Alex Jones news wars.com
[00:42.760 --> 00:49.120]  and info wars.com or the main news sites present planet.com is the backup I hope
[00:49.120 --> 00:55.080]  you don't take this broadcast for granted because quite frankly I do and I'm my
[00:55.080 --> 00:59.760]  own best bellwether of the problems we face I'm our best friend our worst friend
[00:59.760 --> 01:03.120]  I think we all are our best friend our worst friend at certain times in our
[01:03.120 --> 01:10.720]  lives respectively because we really do have our finger on the pulse we really
[01:10.720 --> 01:15.240]  have studied how they're operating we're aware of the gargantuan massive nature
[01:15.240 --> 01:20.120]  of the attempted crime they're engaged in against humanity and the type of scum
[01:20.120 --> 01:24.320]  that have been recruited into these societies of evil to carry out
[01:24.320 --> 01:30.400]  unspeakable activities against their fellow humans but then I forget to get
[01:30.400 --> 01:35.680]  on air and really point out to you the massive effect that we're all having
[01:35.680 --> 01:46.480]  together rebooting this republic and bringing up common sense information
[01:46.480 --> 01:53.080]  my head is spinning quite frankly right now on where to go and what to cover
[01:53.080 --> 02:00.040]  because I've got too much news here if we look at black Friday and grown men
[02:00.040 --> 02:07.000]  fighting over toy trucks and people getting seriously injured over fake deals
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.400]  and then you realize that they wouldn't stand up and they wouldn't fight for
[02:11.400 --> 02:17.640]  their own family or their own country and you see the arrogance you see the
[02:17.640 --> 02:26.960]  soullessness you see the sickness in so many people's eyes out there a lot of
[02:26.960 --> 02:34.840]  it because modern civilization is so easy it automatically corrupts us and I
[02:34.840 --> 02:38.720]  don't sit back and see the decadence of the general public and feel like I'm on
[02:38.720 --> 02:45.360]  some proverbial high mountain like Moses looking down at the centers running
[02:45.360 --> 02:48.280]  around with their golden calf
[02:48.280 --> 02:59.640]  I just wonder what it's like to not know you're fallen and to not be aware of it
[02:59.640 --> 03:10.680]  and to wonder why you're not fulfilled because all you do is chase after things
[03:10.680 --> 03:15.560]  of this world and it's not that things of this world are overall bad it's that
[03:15.560 --> 03:20.480]  if you're only chasing after them and that and that's your goal it's it's
[03:20.480 --> 03:27.280]  empty and you're easily controlled by it and the globalists know that they want
[03:27.280 --> 03:32.000]  control of your mind they want control of your intellect they want control of
[03:32.000 --> 03:40.560]  your worldview they want control over your will and what we're talking about
[03:40.560 --> 03:46.680]  here with the globalist are individuals that want control of our wills and
[03:46.680 --> 03:53.240]  that's so fundamental that we have to really guard our wills and guard our
[03:53.240 --> 04:00.000]  spirit and not let people control and run our destinies we have to ask where
[04:00.000 --> 04:09.520]  is this all coming from what is the agenda here what is its endgame and when
[04:09.520 --> 04:19.520]  you realize that it's so incredibly empowering but also at the same time
[04:19.520 --> 04:26.200]  very very painful you know I watch mainstream media say that Trump's a
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.840]  liar about this and Trump's a liar about that and Trump is so refreshingly honest
[04:31.840 --> 04:36.800]  and almost everything he's done but it isn't about worshiping Trump or some
[04:36.800 --> 04:43.160]  cult of personality it's about the refreshingness of how honest Trump's
[04:43.160 --> 04:48.200]  been and then it's just so disgusting to see how they lie and and also the
[04:48.200 --> 04:53.720]  optimism but also delivering on the optimism his Thanksgiving message versus
[04:53.720 --> 05:01.440]  somebody like Bernie Sanders that's coming up as well stay with us I'm
[05:01.440 --> 05:07.960]  driving home here about to take off few days for Thanksgiving and I just want
[05:07.960 --> 05:11.280]  to impart my message to the listeners and viewers how much I appreciate you
[05:11.280 --> 05:17.240]  and how thankful I am and I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if
[05:17.240 --> 05:21.000]  you weren't there taking action and if you weren't there spreading the word
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.360]  globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other
[05:24.360 --> 05:30.480]  nations and globalism is a completely anti-individual anti-God anti-family
[05:30.480 --> 05:38.640]  anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control
[05:38.640 --> 05:43.880]  society and that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide
[05:43.880 --> 05:47.640]  but the enemy's tracking back so just please we should all be so thankful to
[05:47.640 --> 05:52.800]  God and thankful to each other for taking action also girt ourselves and get
[05:52.800 --> 05:56.520]  ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening so for
[05:56.520 --> 06:01.800]  myself and my family God bless you all have a great Thanksgiving
[06:04.880 --> 06:11.840]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[06:11.840 --> 06:17.480]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind
[06:17.480 --> 06:23.080]  there was something so pleasant about that place even your emotions have an echo
[06:23.080 --> 06:27.560]  and so much space I'm Alex Jones your host thank you so much for joining us on
[06:27.560 --> 06:35.840]  this live Sunday global transmission the last Sunday show of November 2017
[06:35.840 --> 06:43.640]  hard to believe only a month and four days left and we are into 2018 I remember
[06:43.640 --> 06:46.720]  being a little kid it seemed like Christmas never came or my birthday never
[06:46.720 --> 06:52.360]  came or a school trip that I wanted to go on a field trip never came or a date
[06:52.360 --> 06:55.220]  with a girlfriend you know it was coming up in a couple weeks whenever come the
[06:55.220 --> 07:02.960]  prom my parents would say enjoy the slow passage of time my son because the
[07:02.960 --> 07:08.800]  older you get the faster it goes but it's not just that I'm getting older
[07:08.800 --> 07:12.680]  they have a lot of different studies and logarithmic analyses out there that
[07:12.680 --> 07:17.840]  show because of computers and technology and just how fast-paced things are the
[07:17.840 --> 07:28.160]  rate of change and also the fact we have less and less quiet time is creating the
[07:28.160 --> 07:37.160]  perception that time is moving much much quicker that said before I get into all
[07:37.160 --> 07:42.840]  this huge news and what happened on Black Friday and John Conyers stepping
[07:42.840 --> 07:50.640]  down and just how crazy all of this is getting and the next big shoot a drop
[07:50.640 --> 07:59.880]  that we're gonna break here to watch the media call President Trump a liar or
[07:59.880 --> 08:05.400]  question everything he says and everything he does when it's the known
[08:05.400 --> 08:13.440]  liars the known discredited groups that are the ones doing the questioning by
[08:13.440 --> 08:17.520]  the way I think it's absolutely right to question Trump and do not believe what
[08:17.520 --> 08:21.840]  he says like Ronald Reagan said trust would verify that's what keeps the
[08:21.840 --> 08:26.600]  politicians honest not just Trump but the people around him a lot of times
[08:26.600 --> 08:31.040]  he's not aware of somebody going sideways on him until he gets told about
[08:31.040 --> 08:38.680]  it I have personally witnessed it at least five or six times where I've
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.240]  directly told the president about something he says I've written it down
[08:42.240 --> 08:46.480]  I'm gonna look into it are you sure that's right Alex and I'm like yes sir
[08:46.480 --> 08:53.920]  and then days later word for word he researches it he comes out and he
[08:53.920 --> 08:58.240]  addresses it they call that easily influenced or he believes the last thing
[08:58.240 --> 09:08.280]  he heard no when he gets told about a Harvard study showing millions of
[09:08.280 --> 09:15.880]  illegals voted he goes and looks into it and finds out it's true I mean that's
[09:15.880 --> 09:20.520]  what Trump does you notice he'll be on the campaign trail people are handing
[09:20.520 --> 09:24.320]  him stuff or he'll he'll start writing things down just talking to an old black
[09:24.320 --> 09:29.200]  lady or old white guy or a young woman you see Trump writing things down he's
[09:29.200 --> 09:39.000]  obsessed with what people tell him at his hotels and his condos Trump routinely
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  would just walk around for hours and just write down what people think and what
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.600]  they say and then blow up at people about you didn't do this you didn't do that
[09:45.600 --> 09:53.040]  you didn't respond fast enough when their water heater was out I was reading a
[09:53.040 --> 09:57.600]  story years ago years ago I was first looking into Trump about Trump when he
[09:57.600 --> 10:01.160]  had a new hotel opening he went through every hotel room in the building
[10:01.160 --> 10:06.160]  because he'd paid for white and black marble and sure enough he had a feeling
[10:06.160 --> 10:11.000]  that they might and on a few of the smaller rooms inside areas they had
[10:11.000 --> 10:22.120]  cheap green quote Chinese is what the quote was marble and he blew up and he
[10:22.120 --> 10:25.720]  said that's not the armoires I've paid for and that's not the marble I've paid
[10:25.720 --> 10:29.960]  for and he goes and my customers are gonna get the white marble and the
[10:29.960 --> 10:35.360]  point is is that he's the type of OCD when it comes to details that we need
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.840]  and the fact that he's listing the people isn't some negative thing he wants
[10:39.840 --> 10:43.280]  to actually hear what you're saying and what's going on with you so it's not
[10:43.280 --> 10:46.840]  like something special that I've told Trump stuff he's gone and looked into it
[10:46.840 --> 10:50.400]  and then when he found that it was true responded because he does that on the
[10:50.400 --> 10:56.760]  campaign trail you'll see him talking to somebody he'll go pulls out a yellow pad
[10:56.760 --> 11:00.480]  with a marker and starts riding on it and he'll just have pockets full of it
[11:00.480 --> 11:04.560]  he gets on his jet and then just pulls him out and starts looking at it and
[11:04.560 --> 11:08.800]  then talks to an aide has them go look it up for him and bring it back to him
[11:08.800 --> 11:12.560]  it's not just people bringing the president news clippings he says I want
[11:12.560 --> 11:16.360]  this looked into I want that looked into I want this looked into I want that
[11:16.360 --> 11:22.960]  looked into until 2 in the morning most nights he's in there checking stuff now
[11:22.960 --> 11:26.280]  why is all this so important
[11:26.920 --> 11:33.240]  they're taking everything he does now and questioning it like is it true when
[11:33.240 --> 11:37.400]  even the mainstream media up until now had to admit okay at least we've got
[11:37.400 --> 11:41.080]  somebody actually doing what he said he do he's crazy he's bad blah blah blah
[11:41.080 --> 11:45.320]  but he's actually believes in what he's doing and he's actually trying to do all
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.680]  these things no one has really denied that Trump they've had British
[11:49.680 --> 11:53.120]  Parliament hearings about it about this is the first time he's someone's gonna be
[11:53.120 --> 11:59.600]  hated and loathed for doing what they said they do he's executed 50% of what
[11:59.600 --> 12:06.920]  he said he'd do not even one year in office he's 11 months in office right
[12:06.920 --> 12:14.400]  now like ten and a half January 20th will be a year he's not even a year into
[12:14.400 --> 12:19.640]  office he's gotten half done what he said he would but they have new shows
[12:19.640 --> 12:24.120]  going Trump lied again saying the economy turned around they don't show facts
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.840]  they don't show statistics they show nothing they just move on like he lied
[12:28.840 --> 12:34.840]  you're like but but it take me an hour to rattle off all the accomplishments I've
[12:34.840 --> 12:40.000]  got a whole bunch of new ones here today but again that's them hoping you're not
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.400]  paying attention when lies so fast or it's well known how time magazine
[12:45.400 --> 12:49.480]  operates they call you up a month before the the new issue comes out in
[12:49.480 --> 12:53.080]  January or late December and they say we'd like you to be our person of the
[12:53.080 --> 12:57.600]  year are you gonna give us interviews and post for photos list like he did last
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.920]  year he was person of the year and Trump said they and I'm familiar with how time
[13:02.920 --> 13:06.760]  does it it's well known it's been prestigious until about a decade ago
[13:06.760 --> 13:11.120]  now it's a joke but everybody knows you post for a photo you do a big exclusive
[13:11.120 --> 13:16.240]  interview and Trump said no thank you I don't want to give you big exclusives I
[13:16.240 --> 13:20.680]  don't have time they came out they didn't call him a liar they said well
[13:20.680 --> 13:25.040]  that's not exactly how we do it we didn't tell him he was picked exactly
[13:25.040 --> 13:28.640]  well that's what he said he said we think you're the one there's so many lies
[13:28.640 --> 13:33.280]  here the media then runs with it says Trump got caught lying saying he was time
[13:33.280 --> 13:39.240]  man of the year if they didn't pick him it'd be a joke but the point is they're
[13:39.240 --> 13:43.360]  not prestigious they laid off half their employees this year four years ago
[13:43.360 --> 13:51.680]  they laid off 40% that means they're 10% of what they were four years ago they
[13:51.680 --> 13:57.480]  need Trump time magazine needs Trump Trump doesn't need them it but again they
[13:57.480 --> 14:03.120]  make this much it do about nothing about how Trump wants to be time magazine
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.320]  man of the year and he's obsessed with it when in truth he told you he was being
[14:07.320 --> 14:10.600]  spied on illegally they said it was all a big lie turned out it was true told you
[14:10.600 --> 14:14.000]  he'd win because the polls internally showed he was he did win told you he'd
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  get 3% growth rate they said he never would he did it should I list all the
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.040]  other things he's been right about on the Supreme Court ruling on the unvetted
[14:24.040 --> 14:30.200]  Islamic countries on and on and on he's been winning nine times out of ten he's
[14:30.200 --> 14:35.960]  gotten half his agenda through Reagan didn't get half his agenda through in
[14:35.960 --> 14:42.040]  eight years he stalled out already greater than Reagan just a fact if you
[14:42.040 --> 14:46.960]  look at real real numbers I can't believe he's gone this far but they make a
[14:46.960 --> 14:53.640]  huge thing about oh he claims he's time magazine but oh that's ridiculous
[14:53.640 --> 15:00.240]  who's next the dog catcher he already was last year he knows it's a fraud he
[15:00.240 --> 15:07.000]  knows it's a joke he knows it's stupid he says no you've been lying about me
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.080]  they turn around and say well we did call him but we don't remember the
[15:11.080 --> 15:14.720]  conversation like that oh yeah right of course they wanted him to be time
[15:14.720 --> 15:19.840]  magazine man of the year here's another one again this is all petty stuff but it
[15:19.840 --> 15:25.440]  shows how petty they are and what liars they are how hashtag pie gate is the
[15:25.440 --> 15:28.440]  latest example the Trump administration's credibility being called into
[15:28.440 --> 15:36.920]  question LA Times pie gate all Trump's been doing is delivering and being open
[15:36.920 --> 15:42.040]  and telling the truth over and over again he said coming was the leaker it
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.440]  was true he said Mueller killed a criminal investigation of the Clintons
[15:45.440 --> 15:50.080]  uranium one it was true all of it but again they turn into a thing about did
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.880]  she really bake a pie for her family because the left hates family more than
[15:54.880 --> 16:00.840]  anything we'll talk about that straight ahead stay with us America is an
[16:00.840 --> 16:05.160]  information-based civil war that's why now more than ever we've got to hit the
[16:05.160 --> 16:09.200]  streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.600]  down from their bully we're only intensifying our operations in the face
[16:13.600 --> 16:19.520]  of their wannabe dictatorship being a conservative a nationalist a libertarian
[16:19.520 --> 16:25.360]  are simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture the real punk

[16:30.600 --> 16:35.960]  who at the same time is tolerant modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas

[20:01.480 --> 20:06.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:06.800 --> 20:09.800]  you
[20:09.800 --> 20:24.800]  you
[20:24.800 --> 20:28.800]  it's Alex Jones
[20:28.800 --> 20:44.920]  so I have incredible important news medically economically socially
[20:44.920 --> 20:49.600]  militarily to cover across the board we've got major Islamic terror attacks
[20:49.600 --> 20:57.280]  killing hundreds a day taking place for a week straight bombings in Nigeria huge
[20:57.280 --> 21:04.760]  bombings in Egypt bombings in Iraq bombings in Syria mass shootings thousands
[21:04.760 --> 21:09.920]  of dead total hundreds and hundreds per attack and nowhere in the media does it
[21:09.920 --> 21:17.760]  ever say it's Islamic and it gets worse I saw this headline yesterday on CNN
[21:17.760 --> 21:23.760]  where is sexual harassment worse than the world and before I even read the
[21:23.760 --> 21:30.480]  article it's a big thick report I knew it would never say under Islam and it
[21:30.480 --> 21:35.560]  actually says curiously we have no data out of the Middle East we have no data
[21:35.560 --> 21:41.320]  out of North Africa I mean you even know how sick they are look at that there it
[21:41.320 --> 21:45.960]  is sexual harassment how it stands around the globe and you actually read
[21:45.960 --> 21:50.520]  it because there's a total prohibition against showing any black on white crime
[21:50.520 --> 21:56.280]  or showing any Islamic attacks on women when women can't drive cars have their
[21:56.280 --> 22:03.560]  jet their vaginas cut off the front of their vagina cut off I mean and I knew
[22:03.560 --> 22:08.280]  before I read it I said they will not talk about Islam wholesale enslaving
[22:08.280 --> 22:14.160]  women and it didn't it talked about America being the worst
[22:14.160 --> 22:19.600]  whoa America is where women are treated the best in the world hands down
[22:19.600 --> 22:27.960]  except maybe Switzerland or England I mean you go to the war memorials in
[22:27.960 --> 22:32.920]  Germany or the war memorials in France or Britain and it's all a goddess
[22:32.920 --> 22:38.240]  standing with her hand outstretched to a huge pylon that's got the number of
[22:38.240 --> 22:42.320]  dead on it and it's all a sacrifice to her you want to get into the real
[22:42.320 --> 22:51.620]  religion of the West Columbia Diana all of it I mean it's goddess worship the
[22:51.620 --> 22:56.840]  West has put women on a pedestal and now that's all being torn down you want
[22:56.840 --> 23:04.840]  the whole mystery school what's you know what's out at the little little church
[23:04.840 --> 23:10.280]  in England and the whole holy grail and what is it and all that and then that's
[23:10.280 --> 23:15.040]  what's sick about this is the true movement to put women on a pedestal is
[23:15.040 --> 23:25.040]  under attack because that's what the West is that's the truth I mean any
[23:25.040 --> 23:30.800]  initiate of the mystery schools knows that that's why this whole attack
[23:30.800 --> 23:34.080]  claiming that they're the globalists are taking the West over to empower women
[23:34.080 --> 23:40.480]  is the greatest fraud the world has ever seen it's a raving joke so you read
[23:40.480 --> 23:51.440]  that article in CNN and it literally says strangely North Africa is quiet we
[23:51.440 --> 23:55.960]  don't know how it is for women there oh no they're sold on slave blocks their
[23:55.960 --> 23:58.960]  genitals are cut off they have no rights are seen as animals I mean you don't
[23:58.960 --> 24:03.200]  fool well what it is CNN you won't show the women being sold as slaves you might
[24:03.200 --> 24:09.960]  show the men being sold in Tripoli see I said I'd cover that later and I'm kind
[24:09.960 --> 24:14.080]  of covering it now but I've got my stack of news but but but see oh they're
[24:14.080 --> 24:21.920]  equating somebody hitting on a woman or somebody walking around in their dressing
[24:21.920 --> 24:28.280]  room out towards the edge of the dressing room in their underwear they're
[24:28.280 --> 24:35.520]  equating that with pedophilia and rape and men being forcibly grabbed on or
[24:35.520 --> 24:41.120]  women or total blackout on Islam and that's what's so frustrating that
[24:41.120 --> 24:46.840]  before I even read an article on CNN I know they won't touch Islam or if they
[24:46.840 --> 24:50.160]  mentioned anything happening to women in a country they won't tell you by the way
[24:50.160 --> 25:00.720]  it's out of the Qur'an now that said let's get into attacks on the family I
[25:01.320 --> 25:06.960]  didn't even do this on purpose but my wife said hey you know your listeners
[25:06.960 --> 25:12.440]  love to see you doing family stuff your biggest tweet ever was you it fourth is
[25:12.440 --> 25:16.360]  you lie a couple years ago Alice never do it send out a tweet so I pulled the
[25:16.360 --> 25:20.600]  turkey out of the oven at my parents house I said okay here it is I tweeted
[25:20.600 --> 25:25.080]  that I wasn't even thinking she said hey let's tweet another one of you know
[25:25.080 --> 25:31.360]  less than the family I didn't check it till later in the evening it was the
[25:31.360 --> 25:37.440]  most vile hate I've ever seen from the left oh are you by yourself on
[25:37.440 --> 25:42.000]  Thanksgiving you had your kids taken away like the media said totally made up
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.040]  fake news oh yeah and I hadn't even tweeted the picture of the kids on
[25:46.040 --> 25:52.120]  purpose to counter that I'd done it right after that they didn't respond to
[25:52.120 --> 25:58.320]  the one with me and my children you see the photos at real Alex Jones they
[25:58.320 --> 26:01.920]  responded to the one where I pulled a turkey out and to them it was a
[26:01.920 --> 26:06.280]  celebration saying you don't have a family you're all alone well what does the
[26:06.280 --> 26:10.360]  Facebook algorithm say what does Sean Parker talk about confirmed last month
[26:10.360 --> 26:15.680]  I guess earlier this month he said our algorithm is to exploit you keep you
[26:15.680 --> 26:20.360]  alone desperate not have family but also attack family and hate anyone that has
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.760]  one that's what it is it's a zombie horde of people that don't have family
[26:25.760 --> 26:31.280]  that hate you have family and then that reveled in a photo of me alone right
[26:31.280 --> 26:36.920]  next to one with me with family in a simulated victory that I didn't have my
[26:36.920 --> 26:43.520]  children which again is total fake news just like the Joe Barton news we didn't
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.720]  put out video with Joe Barton naked then I saw the media spinning and lying about
[26:48.720 --> 26:54.000]  it I took it down because they would just use the fact that even posted the
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.080]  fact that there was video I said look here we have the video of Joe Barton
[26:57.080 --> 27:01.000]  here's his face you can see it moving but I'm not gonna show it to you had
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.400]  paper all over it even the neoconsights saw it lied and said oh
[27:06.400 --> 27:12.960]  Jones showed it because again they want to pray on you they want to manipulate
[27:12.960 --> 27:16.400]  they've been taught like Gruber was teaching at universities had a lot of
[27:16.400 --> 27:19.720]  the public and had all the professors and graduate students there saying please
[27:19.720 --> 27:23.480]  teach us how to lie teach us how to pray on people they think that's how you
[27:23.480 --> 27:28.560]  get ahead not being honorable not telling you know you know lies telling the
[27:28.560 --> 27:34.240]  truth they think that's all bad they think telling lies being a fraud they
[27:34.240 --> 27:40.520]  think that's a good thing now the media says I posted the still images no we
[27:40.520 --> 27:47.920]  didn't didn't do that either but again that's how desperate they are so you
[27:47.920 --> 27:53.080]  have pie gate with Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying you know my family loved
[27:53.080 --> 28:00.240]  my pie and they said oh you don't have a family event you know you don't cook
[28:00.240 --> 28:05.600]  pies lady attacking her womanhood attacking the fact I mean we bought some
[28:05.600 --> 28:09.520]  pies we also cook some pies we love cooking pies my daughters and my son we
[28:09.520 --> 28:17.560]  love making apple strudel or we love making pumpkin pie or strawberry pie or
[28:17.560 --> 28:23.240]  cherry pie I mean we do it all the time but the point is they can't imagine that
[28:23.240 --> 28:28.160]  people actually sit there and do that they want to say she's a liar because
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.120]  she doesn't want to show her private family and just puts out an image of a
[28:32.120 --> 28:36.640]  pie they want to hijack her on her family and say it doesn't exist because
[28:36.640 --> 28:40.960]  that's what they don't have and that's what the zombies don't have brains they
[28:40.960 --> 28:44.840]  want your brains see the allegory the parallel the archetype they don't have
[28:44.840 --> 28:48.960]  families they want your family gone that's why they're so dangerous all right

[33:17.440 --> 33:26.240]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[33:26.240 --> 33:32.840]  front lines of the info war by the way I wasn't joking earlier when I said that
[33:32.840 --> 33:38.440]  CNN had a big cover story sexual harassment how it stands around the
[33:38.440 --> 33:44.360]  globe and there's nothing about oppression of women murder of women
[33:44.360 --> 33:49.960]  women being sold women being gang raped women being mutilated it's all about
[33:49.960 --> 33:56.360]  men asking women out that's now worse than rape and I said this months ago and
[33:56.360 --> 34:00.160]  all this started breaking I said the pedophile news is breaking it's breaking
[34:00.160 --> 34:03.960]  all of the world how they're using it to control governments Trump is busting
[34:03.960 --> 34:07.720]  them in mass they're getting busted in mass in Europe they're gonna change the
[34:07.720 --> 34:13.080]  subject into sexual harassment and sexual assault then they're gonna move
[34:13.080 --> 34:18.800]  that on to just men asking women out and toxic masculinity and now you see the
[34:18.800 --> 34:23.600]  TV ads and the shaving ads attacking women and I'm attacking men and the
[34:23.600 --> 34:30.480]  rollouts this is how they try to change the subject so here's CNN sexual
[34:30.480 --> 34:35.560]  harassment how it stands around the globe nothing about women in seven
[34:35.560 --> 34:41.600]  different Muslim countries being sold at slave auctions anybody can search
[34:41.600 --> 34:46.280]  engine that and find mainstream news but CNN will not touch it they finally
[34:46.280 --> 34:51.680]  showed some men being sold last week in Libya at a slave auction but they've
[34:51.680 --> 34:56.840]  had late-night comics go what's Jones talking about slave blocks women being
[34:56.840 --> 35:01.680]  sold on blocks what's that mean it means up on a march up on top of block it's
[35:01.680 --> 35:06.040]  called a slave block but but make a joke about it see and it's funny and as long
[35:06.040 --> 35:10.080]  as you're liberal making jokes about women and sex slavery then it's cute
[35:10.080 --> 35:14.560]  because after all Obama and Hillary funded the Arab Spring to run around and
[35:14.560 --> 35:18.200]  murder all the non-radical Muslims and Christians and put hundreds of thousands
[35:18.200 --> 35:21.400]  of women into sex slavery conservatively and kill hundreds of thousands of
[35:21.400 --> 35:28.720]  Christians it's okay though as long as it's liberal but if you control F this
[35:28.720 --> 35:37.400]  article and keyword search Islam or Muslim zero zero zero in an eight-page
[35:37.400 --> 35:43.440]  article sexual harassment how it stands around the globe nothing about
[35:43.440 --> 35:48.920]  Islam imagine my shock when it's the industrial use of interpretations of
[35:48.920 --> 35:56.520]  Islam that is oppressing women and it says nothing about it in fact they say
[35:56.520 --> 36:00.400]  oh North Africa we don't have any numbers sorry we don't know women are
[36:00.400 --> 36:05.520]  abused there that's where women are lower than dogs
[36:06.200 --> 36:11.480]  Middle East and North Africa one region where the me too campaign has been
[36:11.480 --> 36:20.640]  somewhat quieter is the Arab world you mean the Muslim world they say experts
[36:20.640 --> 36:25.440]  believe in that it's as rife as other regions oh but that there's no data as
[36:25.440 --> 36:30.800]  rife there's more abuse of women going on under Islam than the whole rest of
[36:30.800 --> 36:34.960]  the planet combined but the globalists have looked at demographics there's a
[36:34.960 --> 36:41.920]  billion 500 million Muslims the average Muslim has six children by 2025 three
[36:41.920 --> 36:49.080]  billion Muslims and they border Europe the deals been made and it goes on
[36:49.080 --> 36:55.240]  nothing about Muslims talk about control then CNN that helped cover up for
[36:55.240 --> 37:01.320]  everybody and their dog abusing women they're now gonna sit there and tell you
[37:01.320 --> 37:06.360]  about how oh we've got to go after all the unwanted advances not the pedophilia
[37:06.360 --> 37:11.280]  not the raid not the child sex slavery the unwanted advances that's what
[37:11.280 --> 37:21.080]  mammals do but they again they've conflated that meanwhile I'm gonna play
[37:21.080 --> 37:27.640]  one of these clips Nancy Pelosi calls Roy more a child molester no videos no
[37:27.640 --> 37:33.560]  photos him saying that he did court 17 year old women that's old-fashioned I
[37:33.560 --> 37:36.400]  think it's a little creepy but you know if you had a story about Islam and nine
[37:36.400 --> 37:40.640]  year olds being in a range marriages and how bad it was and next up Roy more
[37:40.640 --> 37:49.560]  is a creep then I'd listen you got girls double the age or more of what the
[37:49.560 --> 37:54.240]  Muslims are involved in and then you want me to just Roy more Roy more Roy
[37:54.240 --> 37:59.480]  more and then meanwhile oh my gosh 17 year old women who've been having their
[37:59.480 --> 38:03.120]  periods for three four years I still think it's a little creepy but you're
[38:03.120 --> 38:07.920]  gonna nothing about Islam though nothing about imams in the US sexually
[38:07.920 --> 38:11.520]  mutilating thousands of girls nothing about arranged marriages here in the
[38:11.520 --> 38:19.520]  US or the UK you have no credibility CNN and Pelosi who came to Congress with
[38:19.520 --> 38:23.440]  nothing her husband had nothing when she got to Congress her husband's worth
[38:23.440 --> 38:27.800]  two billion dollars she's worth hundreds of millions and that's not counting
[38:27.800 --> 38:31.480]  what she put in tax-free foundations because she's a philanthropist like
[38:31.480 --> 38:36.360]  everybody else that doesn't pay taxes there's three times the millionaires
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.800]  and billionaires in Congress than there is Republicans that are Democrats
[38:39.800 --> 38:43.280]  they're the rich people they're the elites they're the control arm they're
[38:43.280 --> 38:47.760]  the boss they're the scum they're the problem they're the cancer they want the
[38:47.760 --> 38:54.400]  monopoly Pelosi defends Clinton Conyers Franklin calls Roy Moore a child
[38:54.400 --> 39:00.560]  molester calls John Conyers an icon what of destroying Michigan and being a
[39:00.560 --> 39:06.840]  blithering idiot we're not finished yet LAPD predicts even bigger named stars
[39:06.840 --> 39:11.280]  will face sex crime probes as it reveals there are 28 open investigations in
[39:11.280 --> 39:18.640]  Hollywood LAPD chief expects more high-profile Hollywood sex crime
[39:18.640 --> 39:24.840]  allegations Weinstein inquiry police department likely to join forces a
[39:24.840 --> 39:30.000]  panic's not the answer we're at imminent risk of turning this me too movement
[39:30.000 --> 39:38.120]  into a rush to blame all men well that's the plan Al Franken shame but back to
[39:38.120 --> 39:43.600]  work on and on and on again they're mixing asking women out with raping men
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.440]  and women and children they're mixing it all together representative John Conyers
[39:47.440 --> 39:52.000]  steps down from committee leadership position I'm in harassment accusations
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.760]  it's far worse than that it's sex allegations it's flying women on the
[39:56.760 --> 40:02.960]  dime it's corruption I got big Robert Mueller news coming up too but let's go
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.320]  ahead and play that clip since I mentioned it here's Pelosi who usually
[40:06.320 --> 40:09.560]  can't even get a word in edgewise who can't even hardly talk another
[40:09.560 --> 40:17.480]  doddering corrupt poster child for corruption saying Roy Moore is a child
[40:17.480 --> 40:21.440]  molester meanwhile Bill Clinton flew around on an airplane with kidnapped
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.920]  children the Secret Service agent Dan Bongino is threatening to release the
[40:25.920 --> 40:31.400]  information that broke Friday in full wars.com and they're the ones surrounded
[40:31.400 --> 40:34.840]  by pedophiles and it's Hillary supporting pedophiles and representing
[40:34.840 --> 40:39.000]  pedophiles and making jokes about pedophiles that rape little girl so hard
[40:39.000 --> 40:48.120]  it shattered their cervix and made their body come out on the ground but again
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.760]  it's all a big joke to these people seeing in and Meryl Streep the defense
[40:51.760 --> 40:55.760]  pedophiles and all of them but the chickens are coming home to roost scum

[41:02.040 --> 41:06.240]  give up and that's what's even better is because Hillary and Pelosi and all of you

[50:21.720 --> 50:25.440]  of the products you're getting great products and supporting an organization
[50:25.440 --> 50:30.040]  that is people always say can't believe you're still alive why are you still alive
[50:30.040 --> 50:34.400]  because of the grace of God and because if they kill me it'll highlight
[50:34.400 --> 50:38.440]  everything I've ever said or done but they're trying to kill my name they're
[50:38.440 --> 50:41.160]  trying to assassinate my character and they're trying to financially take us
[50:41.160 --> 50:44.760]  down and if they can get that done and then kind of minimize me then they'll
[50:44.760 --> 50:49.120]  have some guys drop by but but here's the thing I've already done a lot of
[50:49.120 --> 50:52.920]  damage they can't just make it about Alex Jones and I think they kind of figure
[50:52.920 --> 50:58.440]  that out now that's over we're really turning the tide and you know I've had
[50:58.440 --> 51:01.320]  the head of the Kissinger group one time trying to get me to go join them and
[51:01.320 --> 51:06.160]  I've had that happen now I'm getting contacts from the highest levels of the
[51:06.160 --> 51:12.480]  global system not to sell out but yeah okay we're winning how do we help so
[51:12.480 --> 51:17.880]  people know what's going on behind the scenes to us as well and there's a lot
[51:17.880 --> 51:22.520]  of forces in the world so people should know that but I'm ready for the fight I
[51:22.520 --> 51:26.920]  want to see where this battle leads I want to go on to the end to quote the
[51:26.920 --> 51:32.160]  great Winston Churchill in World War two we shall fight on the landing fields we
[51:32.160 --> 51:36.640]  shall fight in the valleys we shall fight in the cities we shall fight with
[51:36.640 --> 51:39.760]  growing strength and confidence in the air somebody pull up that famous speech
[51:39.760 --> 51:43.720]  always tried to find the full speech you can't like an iron maiden ace is high
[51:43.720 --> 51:47.880]  they have one version we're at intros it we shall fight we shall never surrender
[51:47.880 --> 51:52.640]  but just Winston Churchill speech we shall go on to the end we shall never
[51:52.640 --> 51:55.720]  surrender I think you probably find the full speech I want to read it on air
[51:55.720 --> 52:00.920]  because it's not about showing off that you're tough it's not about having all
[52:00.920 --> 52:04.160]  the answers it's not about being pigheaded it's about I know the globalist
[52:04.160 --> 52:08.000]  are evil I know they're out to hurt society I know they have committed to
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.440]  corruption because they believe that will give more power they think the fact
[52:11.440 --> 52:14.520]  that I have a conscience or you have a conscience that we're weak and I'm
[52:14.520 --> 52:19.640]  committed I believe in God I believe in justice I've already seen providence and
[52:19.640 --> 52:25.280]  whatever happens I know that I'm committed to this fight and I ask God on
[52:25.280 --> 52:31.920]  air many times the last 20 30 years you heard me 22 years say God I don't tell
[52:31.920 --> 52:35.120]  you what to do just help me fight the evil help me be stronger help me be good
[52:35.120 --> 52:39.840]  lead God and direct me whatever happens to me I'm ready for that I'm ready to be
[52:39.840 --> 52:43.640]  sacrificed give it's for the greater good because that's what my spirit wants
[52:43.640 --> 52:49.880]  and now I look at this it's like God is giving me exactly what I asked for it's
[52:49.880 --> 52:53.720]  even more humbling so it's not like I have a death wish or any of that but
[52:53.720 --> 52:59.040]  it's like the more danger we get in the deeper we go the stronger we fight it's
[52:59.040 --> 53:02.600]  like I get closer and closer to God as I'm doing it as I get closer to the
[53:02.600 --> 53:06.680]  enemy at the same time whatever amount of power we needed to feed the enemy God
[53:06.680 --> 53:11.600]  just keeps ramping it up and it's like unbelievable it's so spiritual it's so
[53:11.600 --> 53:16.360]  real it's so powerful it's so archetypal
[53:17.920 --> 53:22.240]  I look at these lost people out there all arrogant and tied into themselves and
[53:22.240 --> 53:25.920]  they have no idea that just turning loose into God the universe is theirs now
[53:25.920 --> 53:30.000]  take Trump he's delivered on the economy delivered on the border delivered on
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.440]  NAFTA get TPP and so much more they say he's a liar he's a fraud because they're
[53:34.440 --> 53:38.200]  frauds and then he gives a positive message to the troops saying things have
[53:38.200 --> 53:41.760]  changed things are better you're doing a great job I'm you know I'm working hard
[53:41.760 --> 53:46.160]  they turn that around like he's bragging compare that to the Democrats here's
[53:46.160 --> 53:51.680]  Trump in his message to the troops on Thanksgiving hello everybody and happy
[53:51.680 --> 53:56.320]  Thanksgiving you're very very special people to me and to everybody in this
[53:56.320 --> 54:01.600]  country that I can tell you and I've got five deployed units bravely
[54:01.600 --> 54:08.000]  representing each branch of our armed forces and we're going on live right now

[54:35.280 --> 54:41.720]  time of the year we're doing well at home the economy is doing really great
[54:41.720 --> 54:45.880]  when you come back you're going to see with the jobs and companies coming back
[54:45.880 --> 54:50.760]  into our country and the stock market just had a record high unemployment so
[54:50.760 --> 54:55.200]  lowest it's been in 17 years so you're fighting for something real you're
[54:55.200 --> 54:59.040]  fighting for something good a lot of things have happened with our country
[54:59.040 --> 55:04.440]  over the last very short period of time and they're really good they're really
[55:04.440 --> 55:08.800]  good I especially like saying that companies are starting to come back now
[55:08.800 --> 55:13.440]  we're working on tax cuts big fat beautiful tax cuts and hopefully we'll
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.400]  get that and then you're going to really see things happen so as we give thanks

[55:55.400 --> 56:00.760]  said be oh Trump's taking credit for things being better
[56:01.320 --> 56:04.600]  meanwhile what do you think people overseas want to hear you're helping

[56:10.240 --> 56:15.760]  you've done and they just can't stick meanwhile Bernie Sanders is in this gray
[56:15.760 --> 56:20.600]  frumpy atmosphere you know he's got huge mansions and all this wealth with
[56:20.600 --> 56:23.520]  being a communist it's all about looking like he's all frumpy you know and he's
[56:23.520 --> 56:27.520]  sitting there he's like oh things are terrible America's horrible worst thing
[56:27.520 --> 56:31.680]  ever's happened blah blah blah it just goes on and on with some weird like
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.400]  upbeat cult music in the background here's a few clips of that I don't have
[56:36.400 --> 56:43.080]  to tell anybody that from a political point of view this has been a horrendous
[56:43.080 --> 56:47.080]  year it appears that almost every day there's something coming out of the
[56:47.080 --> 56:52.240]  White House that is embarrassing that is destructive that is horrific our job
[56:52.240 --> 56:59.040]  now is we enjoy this holiday with our family and our friends is not only to
[56:59.040 --> 57:04.200]  take on Trump's divisive actions is desired to divide us up based on the
[57:04.200 --> 57:08.440]  color of our skin or our sexual orientation or where we were born or
[57:08.440 --> 57:11.640]  religion or whatever not only do we have to take them on we have to do
[57:11.640 --> 57:17.960]  something else and that is move this country forward forward as a communist
[57:17.960 --> 57:23.000]  term now I mean specifically what he uses he knows what he's doing this is a guy
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.280]  that New Hillary stole the nomination from him and rolled over this is a

[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:42.560]  rules folks they they want to assault the American system they know what they're
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:49.240]  doing during a segment this is on info wars.com on Saturday's broadcast MSNBC
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.200]  am joy the liberal network allowed a Democratic bolster to call for his
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.760]  political enemies to be arrested and put in prison for failing to adhere to the
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.120]  variety of left-wing viewpoints well hey bro go to Venezuela where they're
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.640]  eating their own dogs or I guess they already ate those I mean go there where

[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:52.200]  bleeding filthy lies here it is. What has the Republican Party in the last 10 years
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.800]  done to help the American people what have they done this is not a political
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:06.040]  party back it up you've been in power turd bag what has Venezuela done for
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.200]  people what has Cuba done what has China done where they have top generals
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.880]  that are building in areas and slave factories I mean if you talked about
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.840]  Apple and slave factories and suicide nets and if you talked about Islam
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.960]  cutting women's genitals off and then you wanted to bitch about the Republican
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:25.440]  blue blood scum I listen to you but you sit here in this free society bitching
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:30.840]  all day you have no credibility you don't have the moral high ground snot
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:37.760]  nose and they sit up there with all these anachronisms and all these these
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.720]  fossils that don't mean because they're old I mean they're all sit up they're
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:47.240]  all pissed like we're upset we have moral high ground this country sucks screw

[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.720]  let's go ahead and play this guy is the Republican Party in the last 10 years
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:09.280]  done to help the American people what have they done this is not a political
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.240]  party this is a domestic terror group and what I think the American people
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.680]  should consider when they ask themselves that question where they party that has
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.120]  done nothing to help the American people is to vote them out and consider
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:28.440]  possibly afterwards locking them up joy so Democrat poster calls for locking
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.280]  conservatives up calls for mass arresting conservatives I mean that's
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:41.240]  that's what you just heard you Democrat poster MSNBC calling for arresting
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.120]  Republicans well that's what they want they want to claim Russian stole the
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.200]  election kick out all the Republicans that got elected have new fake elections
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.800]  like Venezuela they have a new permanent state and they said shut down the
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.240]  independent press and arrest their opposition it'll be like Venezuela
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:59.960]  though you you don't work so you'll start death you little bastard I'm driving
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:06.080]  home here about to take off few days with Thanksgiving and I just want to
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.480]  impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:15.440]  how thankful I am and I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.160]  weren't there taking action and if you weren't there spreading the word
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:22.400]  globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:28.520]  nations and globalism is a completely anti-individual anti-God anti-family
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:36.680]  anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:41.920]  society and that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.680]  but the enemy's tracking back so just please we should all be so thankful to
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:50.880]  God and thankful to each other for taking action but also girt ourselves and get
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.640]  ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening so for
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.800]  myself and my family I bless you all have a great Thanksgiving
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:16.160]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:45.760]  listening to Alex Jones for Nand are Monday a Democratic Party Ulster let
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:55.080]  it slip yesterday on MSNBC of what he really thinks of the American people
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:02.080]  and what he thinks of conservatives who are roughly about 45% of the population
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:06.600]  got about 35% they call themselves liberal there's 15 20% that won't say
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:12.880]  who they are but a large portion close to half consider themselves
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.720]  conservative and it is in countries that are more free market or what you call
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:22.600]  conservative I call that quite liberal in a modern sense very Renaissance very
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:29.320]  enlightenment based he says it's time to vote them out and then once they're back
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:37.160]  in power arrest us now what did the weathermen back in the 70s get caught in
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:42.040]  federal court doing that their plan to bring in a collapsed economy have an
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:47.520]  emergency reorganization take control the military and then arrest 50 million
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:54.040]  people and they said 25 million would have to be killed and and everywhere you
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.040]  hear the left say we want violent revolutions we want violent overthrows
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.480]  they had a failed attack November 4th that they had planned to go out and
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.480]  kill cops and overthrow things there were some shootings there were some
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:10.960]  stabbings there were some attacks but it was a dud but when you hear the MSNBC
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.840]  guest hosts say Republicans are domestic terrorists it's time to arrest them
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:20.920]  remember Antifa funded by George Soros is calling for the overthrow of the
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:24.800]  government and violence they're calling for all this they've been listed as
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.080]  terrorists by the feds and the multiple states because they've done it they wear
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:36.600]  masks they attack people but this guy he shows up and he says arrest people once
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.600]  we get the power we want to end the political system and not let there be
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.240]  debate we know you want to ban words we know you want to ban the family we know
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:51.120]  you're a power cult and we know you hate the producers and that's God's logic
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.720]  because people like this in Venezuela and in North Korea and everywhere else
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.120]  once they get full control everybody starves to death because they won't
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.080]  produce they just march around bitching all day and complaining in the freest
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.000]  most open country in the world not to mean we're perfect but to look at this
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.280]  type of seditious garbage these people are authoritarian cancer they tried
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.320]  cop till a nationwide with their whole leftist black lives matter movement
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.000]  hundreds of cops got killed to have the strong cities come in with the Loretta
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.040]  Lynch to intimidate local government to have the UN takeover policy of local
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.400]  police departments turning cops into SJWs and they said it will stop having our
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.760]  people kill you it took the police from being kind of establishment being
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:42.080]  anti-New World Order you idiots think the cops on average are cowards like you
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.360]  and that killing a bunch of them or shooting a bunch of them are intimidating
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.880]  him saying give in to us or we'll kill you and we'll indict you and we'll arrest
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.960]  you and we'll set you up you thought the intimidation worked all it did was
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.960]  fully convert the police out of being somewhat awake to totally awake does that
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.160]  mean there's bad apples absolutely that mean cops are perfect no the point is
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:08.760]  they're local they're diverse they're different they're not globalist they
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:16.720]  still have American values and now they know who you are scum so let's play this
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:27.040]  guy who openly says who openly says that he wants to politically take over and
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.720]  then arrest everybody just like they said overthrow the election have
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.920]  Mueller say it's frauds say all Republicans elected we're Russian
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.560]  influence have a new election Homeland Security before Obama left already
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.480]  federalized elections that's in place then have new elections a one-party
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.560]  system they have a plan it's been an Atlantic monthly and it's been in
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.960]  salon and it's been in all the establishment tripe publications where
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.040]  they communicate openly I tell you what they're writing and then other MSM says
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.400]  it's insane it's not happening trying to keep you in the dark it's up to you you
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.760]  been warned the good news is we're starting to route them so they're getting
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:09.480]  more desperate and more open about what they want to do he wants to arrest every
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:14.360]  Republican every conservative and get you in a dungeon and he's in a black
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:19.240]  uniform and he comes in there and he's in charge and finally he gets to be a man
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:25.080]  because you're chained up against the wall it's what he says he goes I want you
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:30.840]  in prison I want to have my way with you this is a flaming authoritarian dirtbag
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.320]  let me give you a new scumbag you'll never crush our spirit you'll never
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.160]  defeat us this isn't the poor Russians you dominated or in the poor Cuban this
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.720]  is America and you may have turned half the public into zombies but you didn't
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:47.720]  get us all boy so here he is what has the Republican Party in the last ten
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.200]  years done to help the American people what have they done this is not a
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.480]  political party this is a domestic terror group and what I think the American
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.920]  people should consider when they ask themselves that question with a party
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:05.040]  that has done nothing to help the American people is to vote them out and
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:11.240]  consider possibly afterwards locking them up joy so there you go arrest them
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:15.480]  I mean I should compile all the clips where they say arrest us for our views
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.320]  arrest they have a law that if you don't say G or Z or whatever the weird word is
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.960]  for a transsexual or whatever the new term is I'm supposed to use that you get
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:30.680]  arrested this is about you use the word mother and father you're arrested
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:35.760]  we're a cult that if you want to trigger them bake a pie you want to trigger them
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.320]  have a family you want to trigger them love God you want to trigger them work
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.720]  hard you want to trigger them be good they are a collection of spoiled rotten
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:52.280]  narcissistic people who literally want to dominate alphas they don't understand
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.360]  alphas just want to build us a civilization these false alphas want to
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:04.000]  pull it all down they are cancer look at this right here this is Soros

[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:05.360]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:19.600]  we are on the march the empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:27.200]  all right I'm not gonna give president Trump a pass when he betrays his
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:33.440]  constituents even if it's being done because the bureaucracy is blocking his
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:40.520]  agenda still doesn't matter we have to draw attention to it because it's so
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:46.520]  incredibly important the squeaky wheel gets the grace and we're not Democrats
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.280]  here that are just cult like following a party or a leader feeling like we're
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:57.680]  part of the power structure feeling like our team is in office Trump has been
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.600]  delivering on the economy he's been delivering on our sovereignty he's been
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:07.280]  delivering on America first and all the different criminal special interests that
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:13.480]  have hijacked this country are incredibly upset about that but that said
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:18.320]  Trump said that he was for decriminalization of marijuana now I
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.720]  think marijuana is really strong I think it's become a serious drug but I
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:26.000]  believe we should decriminalize drugs because statistics show just like making
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.160]  liquor illegal it only makes there be a larger profitable black market in it
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.720]  it actually proliferates the use of whatever you turn into a black market
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.120]  and makes it sexy and history's shown that well he's got Attorney General
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.320]  Sessions in there who would like to dial back to the days of reefer madness and
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:49.800]  give you 20 30 years in prison if you're caught with a marijuana cigarette while
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:56.160]  they're handing out billions of pills every year of serious weaponized opium
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:01.960]  10 times stronger than heroin but as long as it's from a doctor it's okay
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:07.120]  that's what Elvis Presley always thought is he injected speed and took pain pills
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:12.000]  and took injections in his back every day he called it an attack multiple times
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.480]  a day a doctor came with a big old envelope full of pills and shots but
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:24.720]  boy he was part of the Nixon a task force to fat drugs and he was a deputy and
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.520]  even had a little little federal marshal badge and he was big on that there's a
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:36.320]  famous photo of Elvis Presley with Nixon in the White House is black on my
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:40.960]  photo their heads are by each other and Elvis Presley looks like he's bombed out
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:48.360]  of his gourd but he's there part of an anti gun anti drug event I mean it is
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:53.680]  just it is just amazing and I'm not bashing Elvis Presley but give me a
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:59.200]  break half these hillbillies are on heroin type drugs that are over the
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.960]  counter or prescription that they get from a pharmacy but they're the ones
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:07.680]  that want to throw you in jail for marijuana so that's a big hypocritical
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.280]  issue that we're dealing with and there's some other areas but bigger than
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.840]  that is this Trump administration picks pro vaccine CDC director who's even
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:24.600]  talked about making it mandatory after backing candidate Donald Trump last year
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:29.600]  anti-vaccine activists may feel betrayed and his administration's latest mood
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:35.400]  name vaccine advocate Brenda Fitzgerald around the CDC at the same time the
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:40.680]  medical community will likely breathe a sigh of relief on the nomination and it
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:47.000]  goes on how the person is pro forced vaccine now here's an article from
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.240]  earlier this year when he was president elect Donald Trump appoints vaccine
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:58.520]  conspiracy theorist Robert Kennedy Jr. to lead vaccine committee so if you read
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:03.120]  the inserts where it's admittedly caused deaths and miscarriages and all the
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:07.040]  rest of it there's all these horrible side effects if you read that that comes
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.960]  with the vaccine you are a conspiracy theorist
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:19.000]  Robert Kennedy Jr. said family that was damaged by it Baron Trump reportedly got hurt pretty bad but bounced back from a
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.840]  vaccine he's running around 18 months old they get that third round of shots he
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.200]  has a convulsion he was talking and running around now he did he wasn't
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:32.560]  talking for a while that'll wake you up real quick but when you go to the clinic
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.280]  or go to the Walgreens or go to the wherever they don't tell you there's
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:42.080]  an insert that's got thousands of words on it that folds out on little thin Bible
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.440]  paper that tells you all the horrible side effects and all the horrible things
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.200]  it can do to you and the fact that they are telling you they have no liability
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:56.040]  when you take it so it's like signing a contract in blood your body but you never
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.120]  see it then they have all these vaccine fact what all these vaccine fact
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:08.320]  websites that don't tell you anything except that a vaccine's never hurt
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.640]  anybody but they're not scientific they're not the vaccine inserts they're
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:18.000]  not the studies they're not the facts they're there to lie to you here's an
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.320]  example I was at lunch today and one of my mother's friends was there a nice
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.920]  person I've known for decades and they were talking about how my newest daughter
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:34.440]  has glowing eyes and is so alert at six months old and they've never seen a
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.520]  baby this smarter alert and I said actually babies were like this before
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:45.200]  before all the vaccines and I've interviewed nurses all over the country
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.280]  and this has been in the news before even mainstream news where until about six
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:54.920]  years ago they would never give a premium of vaccine and until six years ago the
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:00.000]  policy changed federally there's no law just policy through the health system
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.440]  that you never gave a pregnant woman a vaccine because it's set on the insert
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:07.120]  can cause miscarriage now since they started giving vaccines to women when
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.440]  they're pregnant a few years later they've had a massive increase in miscarriages
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:18.400]  in the US tied to vaccines that's mainstream news so they don't even know
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:24.280]  how to cover this up properly but the issue I'm getting in here is six years
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:30.520]  ago they started giving premies shots didn't matter they weighed three pounds
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.760]  or two pounds so they started noticing they were dying when they were giving
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:41.920]  them the shots many times there it is NBC study linking early miscarriage to flu
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:48.240]  vaccine puzzles doctors puzzles you the inserts say it can cause miscarriage
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.520]  you don't you you have some outside thing enter the body the body has an
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:58.760]  autoimmune response then it rejects the baby everybody knows that if a pregnant
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.480]  woman gets stung by a bee many times they'll have a miscarriage because the
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:07.480]  body goes into autoimmune response it's the same thing most of vaccine damages
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:14.480]  again are just like what you see happening with bee stings but it's a
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.280]  lot more toxins a lot more chemicals a lot more pathogens and your body is
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:23.160]  slipping out and that's why you have one vaccine damage you have a bad reaction
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:27.000]  once now they'll quietly tell adults you might not want to take it again it
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.160]  happened to one of our crew members a few months ago the doctor said you can't
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:34.560]  ever take vaccines again it'll make kill you now you've had this response but see
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:39.000]  babies they can't talk so they just say hey it's fine your kid never talked yeah
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.600]  my kid did talk well no that's a conspiracy theory your 18 month old
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:48.520]  never talked now will be in diapers the rest of your life so this is the
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:51.720]  reality of what we're dealing with ladies and gentlemen when we come back I'll
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:56.040]  get into this report out of the Daily Mail don't tell me what to put in my
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.640]  body more than 50 hospital employees fired for refusing to get flu shots
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:07.520]  even clerks who don't see patients but here's the bigger news vaccines they
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.000]  admit flu shots don't protect you from the flu and now people are getting
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.480]  measles bumps rubella and flu who have the flu shot in fact lowering your
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:21.360]  immunity and they want to force people to do this so these big companies can
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:25.600]  force things into our bodies and set that dangerous precedent just like all
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:32.560]  the secret testing that's gone on in this country and across the world so when
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:36.920]  we come back one of the biggest forces of tyranny and oppression we face is
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:42.280]  medical tyranny and we're gonna talk about most nurses you talk to will tell
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:46.240]  you they just say they gave each other the shots but don't really take them
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:51.280]  because they see the adverse results not just in children and babies but adults

[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:27.400]  it is Sunday the 26th of November 2017 coming up tomorrow at 8 a.m. central we

[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.840]  of declassified secret studies many of which were lethal against foster
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:34:00.280]  children US troops poor black people poor white people usually disenfranchised
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:04.400]  groups that can't speak for themselves as easily or who don't have the money to
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:10.960]  stand up for themselves well think about newborn babies who get on average about
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:17.560]  eight shots at birth by the time they're 18 months old they get about 45 to 50
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:24.160]  shots now I believe in learned immunity I know it's a scientific fact it has a
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:29.520]  lot of side effects 600 years ago they learned in England with a toothpick how
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:35.920]  to take the cowpox or the smallpox and put it into a person under the skin and
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:40.440]  they knew if you get it in the skin that's your immune system they just do
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.760]  from wives tales that it was better to get it through the skin and end up
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.600]  breathing and enter something and then you get it internally and all over your
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.520]  body and or you get it when you were already run down and it would end up
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.560]  killing you but if you got it when you were well then a lot of times it didn't
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:58.800]  kill you so we know that's a real science so it's about five years ago I
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.080]  got really sick of allergies so I went into a medical allergy place I had a
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:09.000]  nice female doctor there MD and they scratch my back for a couple hours with
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.680]  hundreds of different allergens and it was all the stuff I knew I was allergic
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:18.840]  to elm and oak and cedar and hay fever and you know just certain grasses and
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.320]  frankly enough it's a lot of northern grasses I never even really been in the
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:28.120]  north but I was allergic to a bunch of those and I had to buy an epi pin that I
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:32.880]  sat with and I went there for about a year and it helped some little tiny needle
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:38.160]  you know in the fat of the stomach with just a little bit of stronger and
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.680]  stronger dosages that they'd mixed up at the time I first did it kept in a
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:47.360]  refrigerator of what I was allergic to and they built up the dose and some days
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:52.320]  it made me turn red not itch and few times it kind of you know made my maybe
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.320]  get red spots on my body I mean I was having an autoimmune response and it
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:01.360]  helped some about a year into it it didn't help a time but it helped some I
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:08.600]  quit doing it but I had to have an epi pin things like $300 I had to have that
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:12.160]  epi pin with me and I had to sit for 10 minutes after each time that they did it
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:18.560]  to make sure I didn't have an autoimmune response and my trachea clothes and and
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:25.240]  my brain swell up and I die now you know all the vaccine inserts dozens and
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.560]  dozens of times per insert I've shown these here many times you can pull them
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:34.560]  up online the actual vaccine inserts go to a Walgreens go to a CVS and say can I
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:38.760]  have an insert for that flu vaccine or from it for MMR and by law they're
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.840]  supposed to give it to you though they never want to and if you get it and you
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:48.840]  sit there and you read it and it'll say autoimmune this autoimmune that may
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:52.960]  cause pancreatitis it's so bad you may lose your pancreas and then they'll
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:37:02.320]  call it type 1 diabetes or genetic diabetes not sugar induced so think
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:09.400]  about that it says will cause autoimmune responses now your baby at the
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:13.000]  third round generally when they really hammers them and baby boys doctors have
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.200]  done for thousands of years at the time of apocrates aren't as strong as little
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:21.240]  girl babies they have center blood brain barriers men can't take as many men are
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:26.800]  physically stronger but metabolically not as strong as women and you can see why
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.720]  women have to have childbirth before in primitive conditions so women are tough
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.320]  as nails compared to men when it comes their whole metabolic system
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:38.680]  endocrine systems gunshot wounds everything women can take bigger car
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:43.160]  wrecks whole nine yards so that's why 80 plus percent of the autistic
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:47.960]  children are boys because environmentally pesticides everything else
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.040]  that males are getting hit with in utero they found as well is having a bigger
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:57.880]  effect on boys but it's getting the girls to so this is all scientific fact
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.400]  look it up for yourself and I know most of you know this but your friends and
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:08.480]  family don't you've got to talk to them you've got to educate them because just
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:15.360]  getting an allergy shot can kill an adult and they make you have an EpiPen
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:19.560]  but they don't tell you when you go in to give your children hey they may have a
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:24.800]  convulsion from an autoimmune response or their trachea may well shut and you
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:28.280]  see the stories of kids dying on the way home in the car swelling up red can't
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.720]  breathe hospital acts dumb they had an autoimmune response just like peanuts can
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:41.600]  kill somebody of course and that's the number one thing there's a bunch of
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.880]  other things that happen a lot of the autoimmune response that happens in the
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:49.880]  gut and then it creates whatever's in the vaccine an autoimmune response in the
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:58.400]  gut to the child so whatever the vaccine was grown on eggs animal tissue you'll
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.080]  have an allergy against meat that's now happening and they know that vaccines
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:07.760]  are directly leading to much of the new allergies that we see that are skyrocketing
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:11.800]  and children's cancers was skyrocketing and again I'm not a medical doctor or
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:18.200]  scientist I can read their own reports so we're being bombarded so imagine the
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:23.800]  nurses they know you give preemie shots the bioethics board of the hospital
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:28.440]  orders them to big pharma runs it they give them the shots then they put them
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:33.320]  on respirators or they get defibrillators out when their heart stopped and we've
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:37.160]  had the nurses on this has been in the news now do you think those nurses know
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:41.960]  what's bad I've had four children they knew by the third time to not even say
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.600]  anything to me but by the third time they went we know none of us want to take
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:53.960]  them to we've all gotten sick we've all gotten sick and I've had the last medical
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:40:02.560]  doctor that delivered my latest daughter knew all about it they said I agree
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.880]  with Trump it we're giving too many too early they need to be tested more and we
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:10.760]  displace them out I've seen the problems and then I separately went in for a
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:15.560]  medical checkup or some insurance and the nurse lady knew who I was but didn't
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:18.800]  really know what I covered she was saying whatever you do I used to work in a
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:24.880]  preemie ward this is a couple months ago don't ever give you know you don't
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.000]  give your new daughter any vaccines it'll it'll it'll cause an autoimmune
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:35.200]  response they all know folks they know this stuff and I'm not Mr. Goodie two
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.080]  shoes up here but I care about kids if they had clean good vaccines for you
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:46.480]  name it I want them I mean I went to a clinic once a week for a year and got
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:51.200]  natural vaccines and I had an FB pen with me and a couple times I was went and
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:55.200]  said doc I'm getting red spots all over me you know do I do I can jam this in my
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.600]  thigh they said no you have trouble breathing and I said think you know put
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.760]  put the blood pressure deal on me and everything that's just a little bit of
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:10.160]  pollen that they mixed into some clean water
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.000]  imagine what all those attenuated viruses and bacteria and these dirty labs
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.520]  and since the mid 80s they've got a vaccine damage fund that's paid out
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.800]  billions of millions of dollars they have secret courts that even handle it
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:27.720]  we've had MK ultra mind control we've had Tuskegee injecting black people in
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:31.560]  the vaccines telling them it's a vaccine and giving them syphilis we've had the
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:36.800]  troops radiated and given deadly vaccines and then they go oh conspiracy
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.760]  vaccines never hurt anybody but everybody knows they took the flu shot
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:44.360]  they got sick everybody knows they took the tetanus shot they almost died my
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:50.920]  grandmother who died in January they told her she got polio from the polio
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:55.920]  vaccine they gave her the first one a month later they said you need this new
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:00.400]  strain they gave her the new strain and a week later she got that strain my
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:07.560]  grandmother was in a wheelchair for 50 plus years they told her back then the
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:14.200]  swine flu they gave in the 70s killed more than 15,000 people and now they're
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:20.040]  firing nurses one company just fired 50 all over the country every day even if
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.040]  they work in the front office doing paperwork because they want the cult
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.440]  members forced to do it so they'll force you to do it so they started making
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:32.080]  cops of years ago have GPS in their cars and I said watch soon they're gonna do
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:38.240]  it to everybody because that's what all of this is about and we're is a medical
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:42.760]  tyranny of social engineers manipulating and controlling us they just admitted
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:46.120]  that the anthrax shot hurt tens of thousands of not hundreds of thousands
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:50.280]  of troops and was experimental any legal and they knew it didn't work but they
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:54.400]  were testing it on the troops because it was all a big medical experiment that

[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:13.440]  organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:19.040]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.200]  in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war

[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:20.600]  close the transmission out with a piece by Paul Joseph Watson titled creepy Joe
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:24.520]  Biden now the video is extremely powerful there's hours of him groping
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:28.520]  children parents swatting his hand away very general session swatting his hand
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:33.960]  away but imagine if judge Roy Moore was on video groping women and children like
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:38.320]  this and we have secret service agents that have gone public now and said that
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:43.920]  he was all over women and children as bad as Weinstein so as all this comes out
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:49.800]  it just shows how power mad these out of control individuals are we're gonna air
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:53.720]  this report you can see the video at infowars.com for its last show right now
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:57.720]  it has a whole other dimension to it in an unfortunate way we also got Don
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:02.160]  Bongino or Dan Bongino coming out former high-level secret service agent
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:05.440]  saying the Clintons better watch it or he'll release the info about them and
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:10.600]  the pedophile airplane the Lolita Express so that's an important story up on
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:15.920]  infowars.com this whole house of cards literally Kevin Spacey included is
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:20.720]  coming down with the police saying more criminal investigations ongoing of more
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.720]  sex abuse in Hollywood as the dominoes begin to fall and then I'll be back
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:29.520]  tomorrow live kicking off at 8 a.m. central at infowars.com for its last
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:35.840]  show and stasis across the country with a special 34 hour global transmission but
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:39.720]  my broadcast is always 11 a.m. the 3 p.m. central want to thank all the
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.400]  affiliates and more and all the great listeners and crew thank God for all of
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:47.800]  you here's Paul Joseph watches report in light of the sexual abuse scandal
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:52.560]  sweeping the entertainment industry the media and Washington DC we need to talk
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:57.600]  about creepy Uncle Joe but that's not my invention that's what the Washington
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.120]  Post labeled him back in 2015 although written in a weird tongue-in-cheek style
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:07.040]  the article cites numerous instances where Joe Biden made women uncomfortable by
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.640]  touching and grabbing them but here's something way creepier than that the way
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:17.080]  Uncle Joe behaves around children now let's be clear Joe Biden has admitted no
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:21.480]  wrongdoing no accusations of sexual harassment have been leveled against him
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:26.280]  at least publicly everyone is innocent until proven guilty but we need to talk
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:30.600]  about this because one Twitter thread alone posted by activist and commentator
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:36.200]  Richard Mills highlighting the subject has been retweeted nearly 20,000 times
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.360]  this is going viral Biden is also signaling that he plans to run for
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:46.720]  president in 2020 current polls show that Biden would be Trump this could
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:51.880]  become a major issue on the campaign trail so let's take a look this is
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.720]  probably the most famous example Biden leans uncomfortably close to a 13 year
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.920]  old girl whispers something in her ear then tries to kiss her as she
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:19.600]  instinctively jerks away all right nice to see you guys
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:24.960]  now this one actually made the news at the time they said the 13 year old girl
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:30.880]  Margaret Coons didn't think what Biden said or did was creepy except she didn't
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:36.040]  say anything it was her father senator Christopher Coons who claims she said
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:40.080]  that I reached out to Margaret Coons to clarify whether or not she thought it
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:45.720]  was creepy and to ask her what Biden said I received no response the official
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:50.080]  stories that Biden was reassuring the girl that his own daughter was 13 when
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.960]  he was sworn in and not to be nervous about being in front of cameras except
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:00.640]  that in all the years Biden was sworn in as senator his daughter was never at the
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:05.560]  age of 13 but I'm sure that that's all completely normal in this clip Biden
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:10.000]  appears to grope the chest area of a little girl the close-up shows her
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.760]  visibly pull away right as it happens
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:22.520]  but I'm sure that's completely normal Biden seems to have a thing for touching
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:32.040]  smelling and stroking girls hair as seen in this clip but I'm sure that's
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:37.000]  completely normal in this clip Biden strokes the girls hair before whispering
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.520]  something in her ear
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:53.320]  he then asks for a picture with the girl alone
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:52:10.200]  senator Jim rich then says dad's going to stand pretty close dad's gonna stand
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:24.240]  pretty close Biden appears to tell the girl quote if I was young but I'm sure
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:29.160]  that's all completely normal in this clip Biden kisses a young girl three times
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:45.320]  as she squirms uncomfortably while he says don't tell anybody but I'm sure
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:50.640]  that's completely normal in this clip Biden tells a girl quote no serious guys
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:53:02.760]  until your 31 which is one of his favorite things to say to children he then
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:15.920]  poses with the girl for a photo while putting his hand around her midriff and
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:24.880]  then whispers something into her ear but I'm sure that's completely normal in
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:33.160]  this clip Biden asks another of his favorite questions how old the child is
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:46.280]  before weirdly stroking the face of her younger sister the mother seems keen to
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:51.640]  leave quickly but I'm sure that's all completely normal in this clip Biden
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:56.840]  again tells a young girl no dating until your 30 before putting his hand near
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:23.640]  her breast but I'm sure that's completely normal in this clip a young girl
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:33.880]  catches Biden's attention he then asks the six-year-old girl if she's 17 then
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:37.840]  begins stroking the girl's face before her mother draws attention to the
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:45.080]  cameras Biden then strokes the girls hair again and tells her you guessed it no
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:51.360]  dates or boys he then strokes her hair and kisses her again he then grabs on
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:56.600]  her face and hair again but I'm sure that's completely normal in this clip
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.800]  where Biden is meeting three teenage girls he trots out his favorite line
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:22.680]  one girl then calls out for her dad appears in a rush to leave the room but
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.800]  I'm sure that was completely normal the former vice president's behavior appears
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:31.960]  to extend to females of all ages his uncle Joe grabbing Ashton Carter's
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:37.280]  wife Stephanie before smelling her hair she's obviously uncomfortable but I'm
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.680]  sure that's completely normal but seriously imagine how the left would
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:47.120]  react if it was President Trump behaving like Joe Biden did they'd be up in arms
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:51.440]  they'd be calling for an investigation remember they freaked out and Trump said
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:57.000]  he date his own daughter which admittedly was a bit odd so what about this last
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.040]  week a secret service agent told Cassandra Fairbanks that Biden would quote
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:05.840]  mess with every single woman or teen and that a Christmas get-together at the
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:10.000]  VP's house had to be canceled quote because Biden would grow pull of our
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.680]  wives and girlfriends asses he also said that the service often had to protect
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:19.080]  female agents from him and that Biden was prone to parading around the VP
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:25.000]  residence late at night with no clothes on I mean stock naked Weinstein level
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:30.600]  stuff said the agent during one alleged incident in 2009 Biden cupped the breast
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:35.000]  of a secret service agents girlfriend during a photo prompting the agent to
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.760]  shove Biden and almost hit him the agent was subsequently suspended for a week
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:43.840]  according to the source men would often stand in front of female agents and
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.600]  Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just to get
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:52.560]  them away from Biden according to the agent best selling author Ronald
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:56.520]  Kessler previously claimed in his book that Biden was fond of swimming naked
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:00.480]  and that female secret service agents found that offensive Congress has paid
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:04.920]  out 70 million dollars in secret settlements to victims of sexual
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:08.960]  harassment now again this is just an accusation but former Trump campaign
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:13.440]  official James Brower claims that Joe Biden is one of the individuals named in
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:17.440]  these sealed settlement deals it would be incredibly naive to think that this
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:22.600]  isn't going to come up if Biden runs for president in 2020 indeed many on the
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:27.640]  left are terrified that it could sink Biden's campaign and hand Trump a second
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:31.800]  term the Huffington Post salon dot com and the Daily Beast have all published
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:37.320]  articles recently begging Biden not to run for office and again no evidence of
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:41.240]  actual wrongdoing has been brought forward but when you watch these clips
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:48.040]  and considering the current climate you can begin to understand how Joe Biden
